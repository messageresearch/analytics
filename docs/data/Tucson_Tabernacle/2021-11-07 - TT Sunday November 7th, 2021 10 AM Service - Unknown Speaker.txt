be with the family of god so thank you to everyone and god bless you so we do have some needs and some things that i need to bring to your attention as a the needs of the children today part of the family of god and i'm glad to be part of that family you know i i was at a homeowner appointment just the other day and there's a first for everything i they asked me to leave the house that was the first time somebody told me to leave and then escorted me out and they got this notion in their head about me um because of the situation was not an issue with our cabinets it was an issue of something else any any question my my experience and i said well if you if you want to talk with the employees of the company here the builder they could tell you you know that i i do my work and he goes oh you're going to throw names at me are you i said no he goes i know names too but of all the names to know i do know one that in his name all demons are cast out all evil presence is removed all sicknesses are gone as i walked out the door i said lord i said you were cast out of places people didn't want you there's nothing to be heard about yeah it's humiliating you get embarrassed but i'm glad that he took took our place amen brother ed turned into a prayer request here for that his son nathanael brother nate says please pray for two persons who were just diagnosed with cancer they're asking for a touch from the lord and for a father who his son is going down the wrong road with a gang and asking the god down would reach down and turn his son around so you know there was a prodigal son that went out on his way but the father desired him back and with that draw on that pull and i'm glad god has looked at us that way we've gone down a wrong road a time or two but the father's love reaches out to us sisters sister zumbrunnen says please pray for my little sister annette she's in the hospital for so swelling leg that is bleeding she has congestive heart failure and she won't stop smoking so you know greater is he than everything that you know we we we try hard we do our best we we try to lord today i'm i'm gonna do but he let him get in there and he causes that to happen listening to brother lonnie jenkins testimony when he was trying hard to stop smoking but when he turned over to god he said from that day on never again so our god is more than able to do that brother robert circonus i have a doctor's appointment uh for to have the eyes checked and praying that all would go well so that's what god's word says so that's what we'll believe together so my sister kathy they prayed for her a few days back but she called this morning and she got a hold of my father and i know he prayed for her but she's having a difficult time breathing this morning and i called her back and you could hear she was having a hard time breathing and she was asking for prayer brother and sister brother lyle sister heather johnson both not feeling well this morning my daughter elizabeth was not feeling well and brother peter mcfadden so the sunday school teachers are not here so there was no sunday school and brother peter was not feeling well along with jonas and then brother matthew mcfadden is on a trip him and his sister are in germany for a couple of weeks a little trip taken together so let's remember them if you'll stand with me how many have a need brother ahead if you make your way and brother had had something he wanted to share a testimony also so if we can take god and take him at his word lord your word says my feelings say this but your word says that my body fills this but your word says that and you stand on it and it pleases the lord or faith gets god and it catches him right on his tracks so amen so brother ed here i don't want to take a lot of time but um our son nate has another gentleman and they were doing bible studies and which turned into a prayer meeting and it came back that there was a cousin of somebody i don't remember how it's all interacted but it the testimony reminds me of that of sister barbara yarbel with jeffrey and this individual has down syndrome was in the hospital was given less than seven days to live and it came back and they felt well let's in this prayer meeting let's let's pray for this person we don't nate has grown up knowing that you don't have to accept that bag of rattlesnakes and so they went to prayer and these individuals sought to face the lord for this individual with down syndrome that had less than seven days to live and it came back that they were released from the hospital and that they were completely well it's we still serve a living savior he's still on the throne and he's touched by the feeling of our infirmities so if he can do it for someone that's a non-believer how much more does he want to do it for his children so let's approach the throne of the lord our gracious heavenly father we are deeply touched that you are still on the throne and that you you love us in such a way that words don't have can't be expressed lord how do how much we love you and lord you've heard these requests this morning you've you knew that they would be written out and the needs of each of your children lord those that are at home suffering whether it's a cold whether it's a touch of the flu whether it's back pain lord whatever it may be having a need for good results from the doctor those that are traveling that would like traveling mercies lord lord you said to ask and we need to receive lord so we commit all these requests into your hands lord one more time to show your mercy upon your children father that you receive honor and glory for the work that's already been accomplished and we commit our brothers and sisters your children and each of the needs that haven't been spoken into your hands and we thank you in advance lord for what you're accomplishing in jesus christ's name amen [Music] [Music] i'm sorry is [Music] come to this water there is a vast there is a river that net worship have the verse to that song [Music] there came a sound from heaven [Music] their hearts [Music] it gave them peace [Music] the prophet gave his promise the

amen you may be seated for a few moments this morning brother nathan erickson is with us as uh god saw this day already god had to reordain this day so whatever your need is whatever your desire is god will meet that a a word spoken in due time and the lord allows that and i appreciate it it's been good good to love him and maybe yesterday was a day you struggled through and mastered maybe yesterday was a day of battles but today you're in the house of the lord draw from that well receive from that well amen i was thinking about this song and had it not been for a place called mom calvary we have the words to that brother jordan just opposed god's search through heaven and couldn't find one willing to be on this day sometimes it's him lord now she will lord what about you saying i will lord amen just suppose god searched [Music] and couldn't find one willing to be a supreme sacrifice that was me that would buy eternal life for you and me [Music] [Applause] [Music] had it not been for the old rugged crown had it not been for a man call jesus and forever i'm so glad he was willing to drink his bitter gum although he prayed fatherless [Music] angels [Music] you appreciate that he went through all that for you oh had it not been for a place called mount calvary had it not been for the old [Music] had it not been for a man called jesus and forever my soul would be lost [Music] had it not been for him where would we be today amen i love you lord as as brother nathan prepares whatever god has placed in his heart i know if if you'll be hungry god will feed if you'll draw and the servant will just yield himself then god can speak [Music] worship you oh my soul [Music] and what you hear may it be a sweet sweet sign let's stand one more time [Music] oh to worship you oh my [Music] take soul my king [Music] amen let's sing that together once again with all sincerity with all reverence i love you and i lift my voice to worship [Music] take joy mighty in what you hear [Music] maybe a [Music] amen i believe he inhabits the praises of his people amen god bless you saints it's real good to be with you again amen we just want to greet you in the name of the lord jesus christ and we bring greetings from the home church there brother ray erickson our pastor and grandfather sends you his greetings all his old friends here amen my family certainly has a lot of sentiment in this church in this congregation my grandfather came into the message and this church was ordained to preach here my dad was baptized in your baptismal pool and so amen so we feel a kinship amen we feel uh amen we feel a connection i know that uh brother ray has a burden for the people here uh just a just a familial bond amen and and uh we're praying for you amen we're standing with you in love and in unity amen we appreciate the the history of this church and its stand for this message amen which is a living word amen even today amen certainly want to open up with paying respects to brother greene amen all that he's been to the bride of jesus christ but if we'll go right to the word with that said if you'll turn with me to proverbs the 18th chapter amen but we do greet you amen and say god bless you in the name of jesus proverbs chapter 18 and we're going to turn to the 10th verse and uh just ask that you'll bear with me this morning i just uh i've got a little thought here and uh wrestling a little bit trying to find which way to go so we're just trusting in the leadership of the lord but but this morning i just want to do a little simple preaching on this thought just to lay a foundation for something that i have for this evening heavy on my heart here but we're going to title this sermon we're going to read two scriptures here one brother branham use brother brahm use both these scriptures when he preached letting off the pressure amen which i think is a timely message for the day that we're living in amen is we have a need to let off the pressure and so my title this morning god willing is are you alive in there are you alive in there amen proverbs chapter 18 and verse 10 the name of the lord is a strong tower the righteous runneth into it and is safe amen the righteous runneth into it and is safe and we'll also turn over to isaiah the 32nd chapter and take the two first two verses there from letting off the pressure and in uh studying for this um i've spent quite a bit of time in in uh the the sermons brother branham preached on letting off the pressure as well as i believe there's three of them where brother branham preached on a hidden life in christ a hidden life in christ amen and i believe that's where we can escape the pressures of this world amen is to be hidden in him isaiah 32 1 behold a king shall reign in righteousness and princes shall rule in judgment and a man shall be as a hiding place from the wind and a covert from the tempest that word means a shelter as rivers of water in a dry place as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land amen could we have a word of prayer heavenly father i just want to thank you lord for another opportunity lord to come before this living word this message father to us lord it's no dead letter but father it's the word of life into this age god how that you have sent your word for father and not only that but there's a promise that accompanies lord the prophecy of this message lord that you would not let your word return unto you void father but that there would be a seed that would be sown into this laodicean age father and it would take root in the hearts lord of an elected people father and so we're standing here father not on the basis of our own efforts or our merits father or anything that we would be able to achieve but we're standing here father as an achievement of your living word father of the holy ghost bringing it to life father in a people lord a light to this dark generation father we pray that once more your holy spirit would come and anoint this word may it have an effect in our lives father may it may it not fall short lord but may it accomplish lord which you sent it to accomplish father and i'm your empty vessel lord with nothing to offer asking lord that you lead and guide father may nothing be said outside of your perfect will but may you just take complete control lord and anoint the speaker and the hearer alike father to receive the word of god this morning come and meet us lord and fellowship with us along the way in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you you're seated this morning and again we're just laying a little foundation with just just some simple preaching on this thought amen of letting off the pressure and i think if we were to ask for a show of hands uh who amongst us uh has is is feeling the pressure of this day i think that all of us would be able to witness amen we would have to admit that in this particular time in this particular season there's a pressure that's on the people it's on the hearts of the people brother branham said in that message letting off the pressure he said there is a pressure on the people today and i and i thought it's quite wonderful how he says he says that pressure has no limitation or any denominational lines amen so it's not just for one church or another it's not on this people but not this people or it's on the unbelievers or only on the believers it's it's on everybody everybody's feeling the pressure amen co-workers are feeling the pressure our associates in this world are feeling the pressure of this day amen you you just fellowship with people out here and there's something in the human consciousness that we're coming to a time where it's getting tight it's getting there's gonna be a lot of friction there's gonna be a lot of pressure on the hearts of the people and we feel those things as christians we feel that pressing down amen brother braham said it has no age line it has no respect of person this pressure is on young and old it's on good and it's on bad it's on everybody a pressure amen amen and we're all quite familiar with brother brandon preaching these things in the 1960s but i i think it would not be a stretch to say amen if the people were under a pressure then how much more it is now a pressure that's on the people amen and we find that the reason that the reason that life is that way the reason this existence that we're carving out here in this layout of seeing time the reason that that we're feeling that pressure is because we're living in a world that a prophet a vindicated prophet has called this world satan's eden amen it's satan's eden amen that so there's an ownership there there's a possession there amen which is of the devil amen amen and what am i saying i'm saying that the key thing to realize about the pressures of this life and trying to eke out a a life in this world today and feeling that pressure people become discouraged they become disheartened because they're trying to find something down here that satisfies and they can't do it and so people become discouraged but what you've got to realize as a child of god by this message amen is that this world was not built for us amen it was not built with you in mind this society this world this eden it was not created for you it was created amen it was it was it was perverted for the purposes of the devil it's for the devil's glory it's for the devil's purpose it's for his worship it's for his lifestyle it's for his society and his culture it's not for us amen so all of the pressures that we're feeling in this world and in this in this rat race amen and amen in just the cycle of this life and we pursue things down here we try to build houses and lands and we find that there's no reward in it there's no satisfaction and people become discouraged wondering where there would be a refuge amen but but it gives us peace as christians to find out amen that this world is not our inheritance it is not our realm it's not our place amen but and that's why we don't seem to fit in here amen christians do not seem to fit into this world amen you think of all the pressures of the rat race you brothers know that you work a job you know and you you work and you work and you put in effort and someone else profits and and you try to build something and it seems like it's always taken away and we're always chasing after something always stuck in the cycle week in a week out amen we find no satisfaction there amen because we find that all the ways that this world measures success what this world calls success amen is not uh it is not true satisfaction uh wealth and fame and popularity amen and and and material possessions we know that biologically that those things don't satisfy scientifically the world knows those things don't satisfy but we know what it is as christians it's been revealed to us that here we have no continuing city no inheritance but we're abraham's seed amen we wander and we sojourn here and we try to make our life but we're seeking a city that's not made with hands it has no material wealth it has no amen it has no uh it has no earthly beauty it's of another realm it's of another place amen but i don't want to get ahead of myself amen we want to go that direction tonight amen but when we just think of the pressures that's on the people today amen look at how society has become we we find that people are more connected than they ever have because of the technology that we have we have we have social media and yet we're more anti-social we're more connected and yet more apart more divided more more separated amen uh it seems like the way that that that our our culture is conducted that everything is poisoned all affection is poison with with jealousy with competition with trying to make my life present my life as something that's you know that's something that's beyond yours and amen everybody's putting on a front putting on a face amen and yet we find that the hearts are empty amen amen the scripture said it would be the scripture said the love of many would wax cold amen amen we find that we have more entertainments we have more satisfaction for our uh we have more to occupy our minds than we've ever had we've we have more access to these things than we ever have but we find that all the entertainment turns out to be entertainment is a drug amen young people remember that entertainment is is a the entertainment of this world is attractive amen but but what it serves to do is it it's a little shot in the arm to get you through the day or to get you down to get your mind to relax in the evening time so that you can fall asleep and then in the morning go back to the same vicious cycle but there's no satisfaction in it amen amen it's satan's eden everything coming and going is working against god's people and all the people amen to bring it to a place where everyone's under pressure not all the traps of the enemy are to destroy god's people some of them are to make you settle for less to compromise to amen to to go without but you know entertainment dulls the pain of a life without purpose and without meaning i'm just laying a foundation here you bear with me okay amen the fashions of this life amen you know how it is that you got to dress a certain way amen and what the world promises you is that if you conform to the fashion then the world will accept you amen but then a couple years down the line the fashions change and you have to change amen or or or or be an outcast amen and amen uh to to live a life a holiness in this time to live a life of of modesty before the lord is it's not accepted amen but the world and the world promises that if we compromise and we begin to look like the world and try to keep up with the fashions of the world amen then we'll be accepted but then what happens when the fashions change you know it's a cycle it's a it's a you're chasing something that that that promises but it never delivers amen and it's such a cycle of materialism amen and consumerism and that that's what layadacia is for it's for you to consume and consume and consume and purchase and conform and dress and achieve and buy amen and never be satisfied satisfaction never comes amen so we find what we find in this world that we're living in is we find a people that have wealth like never before we're a society that has beauty like never before we have pleasures like never before we have comforts like never before and yet on the inside people are dead dying it's a dying generation dead hearts dead lives emptiness dissatisfaction oh my but all this is a contrast brother sister satan's eden is a contrast amen to a to a deeper life a higher experience in christ this world is dead all that it offers is death all that's in the hearts of the people is death and a spiritual death the last plague that brother brahm said would be poured out even in the churches but in christ is promised life amen there is a place there is an experience with god which which is is is is meant to be an escape from the pressures of this world amen the bible said we read it that he is a strong tower amen he's a shelter christ is a refuge what does that mean it means that when you have experienced christ and you come to this this uh life that i'm talking about then you're on the inside with christ and the world is on the outside so there's a division there is a defense there's a refuge there's something that is sheltering you from the cultures of this world amen oh we find that we're in a world where these cold layouts seeing winds are blowing like never before amen amen uh what are those winds it's winds of influence winds of lukewarm uh uh cultures and lukewarm ideas amen and everywhere that we go in this world we're being bombarded day by day our young people are being bombarded moment by moment amen everything that they're touching everything that they're doing everywhere that they're going they're hearing the voices amen of this life and amen voices that are trying to bring in influence friends and and we find that many people are coming under the influence of these voices influences people have been the church has been touched by the culture the churches the church has been touched by the fashions of this world amen many people have come under political voices amen under under doctrinal voices under the influence of kingdom builders or amen or or or or church builders amen and everyone's being everyone is being exposed to these voices because that's the word that we're living in it's layout asia it's a time of confusion it's a time when there's many conflicting ideas and all of that is being poured out on the people to bring a pressure of which way will i go which way amen which way will i conform and it brings a pressure friends i believe with all my heart that in especially in this day like never before there's only one way to survive the exposure amen if any of you brothers are outdoorsman you're in a good part of the country for that you know that you know that when it gets to nighttime out in the desert and those cold winds start coming in amen one thing that a survivalist has to keep in mind it's more pressing it's more urgent than food more urgent than water amen is that you've got to get out of the exposure amen it's the exposure that will kill you first if when those cold winds are blowing you've got nothing to hide behind you'll fall as certain as anything amen you will succumb to the coldness of the environment amen amen and today with these cold layout of seeing winds blowing amen i would maintain to the church of the living god that there's only one way to survive lay out a sea and exposure that's to get into this strong tower amen by a true experience with god that will shut you in to the holy of holies amen shut you in where the presence of god is hallelujah to get in this shelter amen amen oh we find that that because it's such a subtle age it's so deceitful amen though all of the world is uniting under different voices and different movements amen even the churches are trying to bring a unity as brother branham said well they would even use a scripture that jesus prayed that we would all be one he said not that kind of one but the kind of one that the bride will be is i and my father are one you're shutting with god you're connected to something that's not of this world and so there's a become a division there's become a shelter from this world amen i believe the church is to be separate from the world we're not of its culture we're not of its creeds we're not of its movements or it's ideas we belong to christ amen we're called out we're elected we're separated amen i and my father are one i'm in you and you're in me brother brant said what a beautiful picture it is today of a consecrated life who once he enters in with christ is dead to the things of the world hid away with god and the veils drop down around and all the worlds shut off doesn't that appeal to the christian heart and escape from this world and escape from its culture from its chaos from its influence a hiding place brother brown said then christianity and religion become a pleasure to every believer a pleasure to every believer but today he said people have just enough religion to make them miserable knowing that they ought to do this but they're trying to escape hell he said if that's the way i felt about it brother i don't know what i would do isn't that quite a statement just enough religion to make you miserable amen just enough religion to make you miserable you know we've got plenty of that kind of religion around this message plenty of people that know enough to dress the part and they can swap the quotes and they can recount the stories and they attend the churches amen and go to the meetings and things like this but brother branham made the statement are we really getting the people to christ are we just getting them to church amen just enough religion to make you miserable but friends you found that that there's something there are many people around this uh message many young people and even older ones that have been around a little while they're they're they're familiar with the message they're familiar with the teaching they're familiar with the doctrine amen they they know the stories they're part of the culture they're part of the church they've joined the movement amen but we find it there we have people that have never met christ amen amen even in 2021 there are people sitting on the pews of message churches that are not familiar with what i'm explaining and so we find that people are miserable amen can you imagine what a fate that would be amen to be right on the banks of the living water amen and die of thirst of this laodicean wilderness amen to be hearing the words of life you know what this message is to you what it is to me we know what it is amen but many people are hearing it but they've not come to an experience with jesus christ amen amen and that's what makes the difference friends amen when you begin to check your own life and you say well am i have i come to the church or have i really met christ amen i'll tell you how you'll know it once you have a hidden life in christ nobody else is in there with you friends this experience is not on the basis of a church or a group or a movement or a culture amen but it's you have passed the triple veil amen past the court of sanctification of public worship of church joining of holy living amen and you've gone in there where the shekinah glory is amen you're in christ and the world is not in there with you your parents are not there in there with you the pastor is not in there with you the prophet cannot enter there with you but you have entered into a fellowship with god amen that's on an individual basis amen there are many quotes for brother branham explains this message as a message to the individual it's not to the churches it's not to the nations it's to you it's to you amen personally god trying to reveal himself to you amen oh friends you in the kind of glory and nobody else figures into it then you'll be alive in there there's life in there but paul spoke of he said having therefore brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of jesus by a new and living way which he hath consecrated for us through the veil through the veil that's where christ is he's through the veil amen the bible said he's outside the camp amen when uh when the tabernacle was set up amongst children of israel in exodus the 33rd chapter it was outside the camp amen and all the people were part of the camp amen all the people the bible says that all the people of israel would come out into the door of their tent and they would watch as as moses would leave his tent and he would walk down the aisle of the congregation amen and he would go outside the gates to where the tabernacle of the congregation was amen and everybody was there to watch moses's walk everybody was there and they and when they when he went to that place the pillar of fire and the cloud came down and hovered over there and god spoke to his prophet face to face and the miraculous was witnessed the supernatural was seen amen uh you may be sitting here maybe you were in houston amen when the pillar of fire came and vindicated a message maybe you've maybe you're familiar with the stories you've seen the miracles say man you're you you can you can give an account friends amen but there was something that made the difference amen there was a there was a there was a point of contrast amen because when moses left that that sanctuary and he went back to the camp all the people that had one foot out into the aisle everybody was part of the meetings everybody was part of the church everybody believed god sent a prophet everybody witnessed the supernatural but they had one foot out and one foot back in their own tent and that's the problem that we've had around the message that it's the root of all of our problems brother aaron amen as people they got one foot in this message but one foot back in their own ideas or their own background amen or the way their old pastor used to teach it or the way they learned it in seminary or their old opinions or their own lifestyle or their own desires amen amen but you know there was somebody that was in that encampment amen that was called not only to be a witness to moses but he was actually called to be a fulfiller of everything that moses prophesied amen we know that was joshua amen joshua had a commission not just to believe god sent a prophet not just to be a part of his ministry not to just be a beneficiary of his teaching amen but he was called and elected amen who was and and position of the lord to be a possessor of everything god promised by the prophet moses that's a type of the bride of jesus christ amen and there was a difference when it came to joshua because the bible said when everybody else came and they had one foot in the camp one foot back in their own tent amen and watch what god did through a prophet then they went right back to their own tent but the bible says in that same chapter amen that joshua never departed from the tabernacle of god's presence amen amen that's the kind of life it will take to live this message to see this message fulfilled to take a rapture to witness the third poll amen to see all these things fulfill amen it will never be fulfilled amen by quote quotas and church joiners and people that were part of the movement or can tell the story's friends but but yet god is marching on god has raised up a joshua move amen but what we need is a caleb amen amen who will go with this word amen and go wherever it takes you friends and what is trying to what what god is trying to do through this message is call out to the individual to go beyond the camp as paul said as brother branham preached going beyond the camp amen beyond the crowd the social gathering and you as an individual got to go like joshua did into that holy of holies and never leave a true experience with god a true communion i i tell you friends there's a lot of people trying to quote their way into heaven a lot of people uh trying to get into heaven on what they witnessed in their life i mean no disrespect to those things i love those stories i reverence them but friends have we really got the bride to christ or have we built another church one thing i believe with all my heart is that this bride will not be a slightly better church with slightly better doctrine amen but she will be a people she will be made up of individuals amen who have gone beyond the court of religion gone beyond sanctification beyond a holy life beyond the knowledge of the word amen and come to know her husband jesus christ through a personal experience that's the bride that's the message friends oh brother braham said get in with christ shut off from the things of the world for to commune with him his pleasure amen it's beautiful friends so oh my i deal with so many young people that that are in that in that that that cycle of sanctification brother random talked about where he said you've got just enough religion to make yourself miserable amen there are miserable people trying to just live a religious life on their own trying to live up to a message and the dues and the don'ts amen and stuck in that cycle of sanctification friends and many of them make the mistake that because they are miserable that everyone else is miserable too and putting on a front friends but i believe there's a witness amongst the bride of jesus christ of the people that know the pleasures of a hidden life in christ the joys of his presence amen all the power of a life that's shut in with god amen the world is shut out and you're shut in with him it doesn't matter what society says what culture says what the churches are doing what what the critics are saying you're shut out from all those things you're in there with christ that's where the pleasures are that's where the man is always fresh that's where a dry branch that's been discouraged and damaged by the oh my what what what caused that branch to be dried out was the exposure to the environment of that desert amen and we've got a lot of people that have been exposed around this message to a lot of fake religion to a lot of hypocrisy we've seen churches rise and fall ministries rise and fall doctrines rise and fall and a lot of people got burnt out dried out oh my discouraged but in this experience in this presence in that holy of holies it doesn't matter what brother so and so did doesn't matter how she hurts you or he hurts you doesn't matter what you've been through it doesn't matter how damaged you've been how dried out you feel in there a dry branch brings forth buds and it brings forth an original fruit amen uh it has nothing to do with the environment it has nothing to do with the earth it's just the presence of god that's enriching that life and putting life and sap and greenness through that branch a god that can restore a god that can heal a god that can put the broken pieces together oh friends we need that i don't care how long you've been around how old you are how long ago you got the baptism the holy ghost and how far your experience goes day after day moment after moment we have a need to exist and persist in that presence of that shekinah it's the only thing that will help us to survive this world always said it's pleasure to commune with him as pleasure it's beautiful it's something that fills and satisfies the soul gives you peace that passes understanding all the crosses become flying wings all the burdens are chariot wheels oh you can fly away my burdens are light brother brown said yoke up with him the yoke is all padded with hallelujahs i think that's wonderful when when you're once inside the veil with him he becomes your life he becomes your life he's our source amen he's our uh he's our source like aaron's rod and the reason that many of our churches and many of our people are not bearing fruit the reason we're not seeing maybe the move of god like some of us remember it we're not seeing the supernatural like some remember it amen why why is it because amen that fruit only comes forth amen in the presence of the shekinah amen but many people have shut off amen they've shut off from the moving of the spirit amen it seemed like the holy ghost can't drop in a meeting like it used to hearts can't be moved like they used to there's a coldness there's a dryness a moment in his presence will take care of that amen a moment in his presence and a dead branch gives forth life amen we need that friends we need the real thing not an artificial believing not just belonging to a church amen but the bride of jesus christ amen of all people in this world ought to have a reality of an experience with god we ought to be witnessing the supernatural we ought to be seeing the reality of of of the life of christ amen here's why brother brahm said he's speaking of sanctification and hidden life in christ of course sometimes we make the mistake of thinking that all of our young people and our young believers understand all these things but brother bram's preaching about the tabernacle the old testament how it had three courts and the outer court was a public place where people would come and they would come and they would make sacrifice and things like that and people would mingle there would be fellowship there amen even unbelievers would would come into there at times and amen but that was that outer court brother braham said which represented justification is that right but then there's an inner court that people come to amen there's an inner court of sanctification and the only people in there was the priesthood the religious leaders the the ones that didn't dress like the world they they had a different dress they had a different mannerisms they had different actions amen and it was a it was a special people amen but there's a lot of deception in that inner court amen because in that inner court yeah everybody looks religious everybody everybody uh everybody uh can quote the qua everybody's familiar with the ritual of religion amen but that's not where god was god was not in the religious life god was not in the court of religion god was past that amen in the holy of holies where the shekinah was and brother branham and so it becomes very deceptive brother bran spoke about it how that sanctification he said that inner court had light that he said they had light too amen but it was artificial light it was artificial light he said now what was that artificial light of the of the experience of sanctification he said it was a seven point lamp to give them light amen it was a seven point lamp amen but the lights got low he said they would get smoked up the lights would go out they had to be relit because it was an artificial light in the court of sanctification brother sister and that's right where we make our mistake where the deception is because what we have around churches and what we have around religions brother braham said the most deceitful thing is for somebody to think they're a christian but they're not and why would they think they're a christian why they belong to the church and they pay their tithes and they sing the songs and they're familiar with the doctrine and they dress the part and they act the part and so and so well i'm i'm part of a church i'm living this religious life but it's sanctification masquerading as the baptism of the holy ghost amen bro and that's and yeah it looks the part it dresses the part and it can talk to talk friends amen you see what that artificial light was under those seven candlesticks and so we've seen many people rise up that they can quote the quotes and all their diagrams are right and they can explain all the mysteries and the doctrines and intellectually they've got such a grasp of this message but what's lacking is life life on the inside life that can that can hold that life and keep it out of a backslidden condition and can bring forth the works of this message and bring it to pass and fulfill it in a real and a tangible way not just knowledge of the word friends i'll tell you what that is you may be up to date on your doctrine but you're still living in the glare of another age amen talking about that you can talk about doctrines and the reformations of the church ages and fellowship in the inner court you've got your candlesticks arranged and your diagrams drawn amen you can quote all the quotes but be artificial friends there's more for us there's more for the bride of jesus christ friends i don't believe god sent a prophet to educate us about seven church ages but he came to usher us in amen to experience with god he called it a bright age amen we're in the middle of laodicea there would be a people amen that that we're not part of this culture part of this world not under this laodicean curse not naked not wretched not poor amen but married to her husband one with christ in a real experience with god friends a reality amen it doesn't matter your pedigree it doesn't matter your knowledge of the word if you've fallen short amen of our true experience with god personally friends then there's not enough not enough sanctification in this world not enough quotes that can save you amen but salvation amen rapture the third poll power supernatural amen to be the bride it's all in christ it's all in him the message came to introduce us to him it's my appeal to the church are we really getting the people to christ or are we just getting them to the message amen yeah i know you're an experienced church he said no amen this is not a strange thing that i'm speaking to you you've witnessed it some of you maybe have experienced it friends but i'm not content to live a layouty in existence i'm not trying to take this message and cause it to be compatible with the age that i'm living in the society or the culture that i'm living in i'm not trying to i i when i approach the ministry when i approach preaching this word preaching this message i'm not trying to move it along in a way that'll just build a church or or or we'll just try to bring things up to date or make it make it more acceptable amen to this world friends but i'm clinging to this word amen because what it is to me is more than a system of belief it's more than what daddy believed or mama believed or pastor believed it's more than what what this brother preacher that one or what that church stood for it's christ amen it's christ in me the hope of glory it's his reality it's his fellowship amen it's his presence in my life it is the shekinah glory brother brahm said it's the same pillar of fire amen but it's not hanging over a camp now it's not hanging over a nation or a people or even a church amen but he said on the day of pentecost that pillar of fire broke itself up and now those little those little licks of fire have been tabernacled in individuals in this day friends what am i talking about i'm talking about that old-fashioned baptism of the holy ghost friends amen but more than what the pentecostals have more than what luther or wesley had but by the light of the message we understand what the baptism of the holy ghost is it is the person of jesus christ his literal life tabernacled in the individual christ in you the hope of glory what an offer what a privilege to be his temple to be his tabernacle to dwell there with him between the wings of the cherubim you say brother nathan i'm nothing everything that i've tried has failed everything i've gone after has fallen apart and i'm nothing in my flesh that's the point amen amen but you are that of wood of the old testament amen that now glee desert wood not good for much amen but but but the but the prophet took that word and shaped it just right amen amen and then what did he do he poured it over with gold the ark of the covenant on it oh well on the exterior it's just the wood which is representing humanity it has flaws it has knotted up places it's rough friends it's not valuable but because god poured his glory out on that wood he has made this bride the very tabernacle of his deity he has covered you with himself his character is of you his attributes are of you his name amen is your identification what a message hallelujah i'm not content with laodicea i want to be in there in that little room amen where the shekinah glory is i want to dwell between the wings of the cherubim amen in an experience with god amen that doesn't need refreshed on sunday morning amen i don't need my fire i don't want to get smoked up and need relit and smoke up and relit i don't want the i don't want the flickering light of just knowing about the church ages and just getting all my candlesticks right i want to be in there in the shekinah glory where there's a supernatural glow of his presence and christ is the light the very pillar of fire himself an eternal flame that never flickers it never is extinguished it burns on monday on tuesday on wednesday on thursday on friday and saturday it burned through it burned way back before there was a world and as eternity rolls it will burn on amen and the very flame that's in me by the baptism of the holy ghost when what a statement this is i believe it by election to be a part of that original flame it cannot burn out friends oh it's what we need brother brown said the man who entered in and the veil fell behind him he didn't depend on the sunlight the starlight or the moonlight or the seven golden candlesticks amen friends that's what'll that's what'll get you somewhere with god is not what you know or how you got all the mysteries figured out and you could look at the blood moons and the star arrangements and conspiracy theories and and all of those kind of things no but in there the shekinah glory of the lord was in there and he lived whether the clouds were going on whether the rain was falling whether thunder was rolling whether an army was coming it didn't mean a bit of difference to him he was protected he was in the shekinah glory living in the presence of god brother braham gets excited he says hallelujah he said you think i'm a holy roller maybe i am let me tell you something brother this is the words of a prophet now if it takes a call to a holy roller to live in the shekinah glory let me stay with god in the shekinah glory and call it what you want to friends that's kind of how i feel about it you know i would rather be called a whooping hollering fanatic and know that i've got something real amen then have all of my candlesticks polished and all of my constellations named and be an artificial life friends but what i'm looking for and what this message has promised with me and what i've experienced in the message of the hour is a reality of the knowledge of god personally oh friends i'm not talking about shouting with the crowd i'm talking about being shut in with god oh brother grant said no matter how much you shout or how or what you try to do if you haven't got a life that your neighbor knows you're a christian there's something wrong somewhere sure we've seen a lot of people that can shout and they can jump and dance but they got no life behind it amen we know these things but here's what a prophet said he said but there's nobody in the world believes in any old time shouting and blessing god and praising god than i do amen i'm coming to something here i believe that a baby that's born and it doesn't move it doesn't whimper it doesn't do anything he said you know what the doctor does he gives it a good spank that gets some breath in him he said that's the matter what's with the church when people say yeah i'm born again he said you know what it is it's a stillborn dead baby it needs a little gospel spanking once in a while that'll wake it up and get it to whining and crying and get some life into it friend you just excuse me amen but i i i personally believe that in this lukewarm age that we're living in we need a little bit of fiery preaching that will that will uh smack that spiritual deadness out of the church we need a we need our minds stirred to remember it sometimes amen amen of the glory of this word that we have received amen amen you know there's a lot of people shouting and they got nothing in them amen nothing in them really but if the bride of jesus christ doesn't have something to shout about amen then oh where of all men most miserable amen but you know what we need to do is find out whether we're alive or not that's my title this morning aren't you alive in there amen oh because in there brother brahms said that's a place in that strong tower where you can let off the steam you can let off the pressure amen and we find that we've got people that are so pressured by this age so under the so under the just the weight and the heaviness of this of this time that we're living in until the people just gotten closed up and dried out and cooled off friends oh god amen but oh amen uh but there is a there is an experience with god amen where you can just let that off friends that's why we find many times uh with our young people you know that uh that that that will get them into meetings and the holy ghost starts to move and falling on lives and people tend to get a little noisy brother aaron amen why because they're under so much pressure amen and they're so bound up by the chains of laodicea when those chains fall it makes a noise amen i'm a witness personally friends amen that that uh that's the reason sometimes we see noise in our we have noise in our services we got people saying amen we got smiles we've got we've got rejoicing we've got dancing we've got all those things amen what is it because people are under pressure amen and they've found a place where they can let it off hallelujah i i i wrestled with the lord to go in this direction because i i wanted to give a testimony from our youth camp we had over there and it's just not in my nature to to come off like self-promoting but i'll trust in your discernment to see my spirit tonight but we had a we had a we had a youth camp and this this year earlier this year amen oh my the lord met us there amen it was just uh it was a wonderful time and we had a little screaming and shouting and and whooping hollering and dancing and all those things and of course when you have meetings like that then criticisms come and you know we're accustomed to those things and we aren't really bow into those things but but you know there was one young person that went home and gave a testimony in their church and it meant quite a lot to me and i think even out of the words of a young person it's an example to many of our older ones he said that how he's there at camp and then this one would take off screaming her this one would get get under the anointing and begin to you know make a noise or a dance or something like that and he said i was so critical he said until i was looking around and i would see this one get touched and i'd say is that right is that right is that right is that right is that right you know because we're believers we know a lot we've been taught a lot we've seen a lot of false we've seen a lot of fanaticism we've seen a lot of wildfire friends and so he's so under that until i like the phrase that he was for it he said i was micromanaging god until you and then that the way that we get we get so super spiritual till god can't touch somebody unless god does it the way that we think is appropriate amen but god is not bound by those things he said you know and so they say there he is saying is that right is that right is that right until sunday morning the preacher said something over the pulpit he said it was the voice of god spoke directly to me spoke directly to me and next thing he knew said i was out there dancing with him amen amen friends uh uh here here's here's a life that that that so part of the group so much in sanctification and legalism and religion until here god's pouring a spirit out and all that's in this heart to do is is that right is that right is that one right is that is that correct is that appropriate friends but here's how you know when you're shutting with god it doesn't matter what anyone else is doing amen because nobody's in there with you oh but in the presence of god amen let them shout or not shout let them criticize or not criticize the beauty of it is here this brothers under this weight of criticism a critical spirit and legalism and criticizing everybody but they weren't thinking about him they were in shut in with god with a worship with a praise friends and i've got enough testimonies come in to know that something real was done it wasn't wildfire to me france but that's when you've gone past the veil that's what i'm talking about when you're in christ and it doesn't matter what anyone else thinks or does you're in there with him nobody can go in there with you nobody can enter there with you it's you and god look at the lame man at the gate amen you might have been walking down the street that day and here comes some man whooping and hollering and jumping around and you say my that brother got a little emotional amen and you might have thought that that he got a little bit in the flesh unless you'd seen him the day before friends you might think brother nathan you're you're just really an emotional young preacher and give it a few years you'll cool off and you'll mature and all those things oh friends you don't know where i've been you don't know where i've come from you don't know what i've experienced amen see don't throw my experience out because it doesn't match yours and i won't do for the same for you there's a lot of people sitting in churches you know it's just not in their nature to shout or dance or things but they can say amen and a quiet amen amen has an anointing on it that brings a uh it brings a presence it brings in it brings a an atmosphere into the church where lives can be touched because of a quiet solid amen but it's got to be genuine it's got to be genuine it's got to be an honest and sincere reaction to the presence of god amen it's easy to dismiss the hour is this okay it's easy to dismiss the outward manifestation until you know the full story amen amen and again forgive me for i i don't mean to talk about the home church there but we're really excited about what the lord's done since this youth camp the number of young people that have been baptized in the church has entered the double digits i think our 10th and 11th and maybe 12th are being baptized this morning at home and and and and friends that's something sovereign that's something that only god can do but we need it amen we need the moving of the spirit in the church we need lies and we need people to encounter christ because the knowledge of this message as wonderful and and as precious as these doctrines and these teachings are to us there's they cannot transform they cannot take you and usher you from sanctification into the holy of holies only a an experience with the shekinah glory can do it you got to come like moses and moses was a message believer moses was a young person who was raised in the message as we would say he cut his teeth on a message pew as i would say he was a message brat amen he was familiar with the teaching his mother taught him the message for his day he was from a young age he was instructed and he sincerely brother aaron with all his heart believed that message he believed he was to be the deliverer he believed he was to lead the children of israel out of bondage that's what he was taught his whole life but when he took it into his own hands to try to live something and here's where young people stumble try to take this message and live it in our own efforts by virtue of who we are because we're a deacon or because we're a preacher or because we're whatever we are amen then we find that you you'll end up like moses you'll kill about one egyptian what a deliverance and it'll take sometimes years in the backside of the wilderness getting all that pride beat out of you until you come to the knowledge and some people come late i had a brother just just a couple weeks ago it's why i'm preaching these things but i was preaching along this line a brother came up and this brother been around the message for decades and he came up to the altar at the end of service he said brother nathan i know a lot about god i know a lot i've been around a long time but i don't know him i thought that was quite something for for a veteran brother to admit i don't know him and there are a lot of people in the pressures of this world the pressures of laodicea trying to eke out in existence down here amen but you don't know him and that's why it's miserable oh but in his presence our joys forevermore a day in his courts is better than a thousand elsewhere there's a real experience with god to be had i don't know if i've been lengthy or not i haven't been watching the clock please excuse me amen but you know uh uh brother braham said we don't have to get some kind of emotional or mental makeup he said we can get not only a mouthful but a soulful of the original baptism of the holy ghost on the day of pentecost and it'll bring the same results as it did on the day of pentecost you know that the pentecostal experience is for today amen i know that people around this message and teachers have tried to put it in the past brother branham said uh uh it was 1964 1965 he said that uh that the i believe that uh he said i believe pentecost is to all times it began without an ending he said the pentecostal blessings must remain among some people amen 1964 brother branham said that yeah the church is today they don't want a lot of they don't want a lot of emotion they don't want the moving the spirit they don't want these things brother branham said it was like a woman amen who doesn't want to bring forth children because it will ruin her body he said that's the churches of today have become so dignified until they don't want any moving of the spirit and this is and the shame of it is this is describing many of our message churches and many of the teaching that goes on around this message but brother branham said amen she don't want any of those whooping crying hollering tongue-talking pentecostal babies but he said it's the only kind the word of god produces 1964. i got several hundred more if you're interested but we're trying to move on with a different thought here amen amen you know brother branson said his first time amongst the pentecostals he saw a lot of the young preachers preaching and he said i thought they were kind of noisy he said but you know if you're not a little noisy it's a sign that you're dead amen oh my anything without emotion is dead i know that's the evangelist's favorite quote but it's true amen but you know speaking of this holy of holies brother branson spoke about aaron and aaron was the high priest he was he's the type of the true believer because he's the one that went past the religious people past the priesthood past the rights of religion and he was the one who had the privilege to enter beyond the veil into the holy of holies and witness the shekinah glory and we find that there were there was a holiness there was a there was a sanctification that was required he had to eat right he had to dress right he had to walk right he had to he had to dress a certain way amen there was things required of him religious uh things amen but those things were for the purpose of of of of of permitting him to go into that presence and when he went in brother braham said he had he had something on his robe a bell and a pomegranate and he had to walk a certain way brother brown said amen so that it would make a noise it would make a noise his walk would cause a noise brother bram said it would play a song of holy holy holy unto the lord amen and and he said and he had to walk and he had to make that noise any brother man said the only way the people outside knew that he was alive in there was because he made a noise friends amen so i'm challenging you with this word tonight are you alive in there amen is do you have the joy of the lord like you used to can you say amen to the word like you used to is the is there a movement there is there a reaction is there a noise in your life is there a worship or have you succumbed to the cold winds of this lay out of cn age old friends are you alive in there see that's what i'm going after i'm not trying to just be noisy or work up some emotion i it's a genuine question to the church are you alive in there amen oh my then if you're alive in the air then we ought to ring that bell and pomegranate if there's a life there ought to be a noise because it's a witness to the church it's a witness to this world that there's something going on in when this world's as dead as it can be when people are wandering in this wilderness friends i'm shutting with god and there's life in there there's joy in there there's peace in there that's why i make a noise that's why my life has a worship it has a reaction to the word of god why because i'm alive friend so i so i ring my bell amen just like that old liberty bell one of the great symbols of our country you know that old liberty bell is an old landmark of freedom that we know very well as americans but you know that bell has been cracked and worn down and they don't ring it anymore but all around the country there's there's there's there's there's duplicates that have been struck off of that original bell and when it comes to independence day they began to ring those bells as a testimony not that we were free but we ring the liberty bells to testify to this world that we're still free we are free we have liberty amen that's what i believe the bride of christ has a right to to liberty to worship god liberty to to pull on the word liberty to express her joy and her peace and it's a testimony to this dying world amen when men are so miserable just like israel at the red sea brother man said you know what happened moses danced in the spirit and miriam beat a tambourine and all the daughters of israel and they ran up and down the banks dancing in the spirit he said if that ain't a pentecostal meaning i don't know what one is oh somebody's came to me said brother branham you're preaching this new kind of salvation aren't you i said no sir he said ain't you got this new salvation he said no i got a new case of the old salvation amen i he said this i said this is the oldest religion there is they said well how old is it when was it started when was it formed i said before the world was ever founded oh when the morning stars sang together and the sons of god shouted for joy friends you know what this message means to me where were those sons of god shouting they were in the mind of god before the foundation of the world and you're going to tell me that to believe this message believe that i am a seed of god god knew me before the foundation of the world i'm part of him i'm part of his word i've been spoken into this world to be an overcomer i'm predestined to take a rapture and i but i'm not happy about it i'm not emotional about it amen you keep that religion give me that old-time religion that all the prophets of the old testament had every time they came into the presence of god they fainted they they they passed out they were overcome they were awestruck by the presence of god and here we're preaching the literal life of jesus christ present in the bride of jesus christ and trying to strip the bride to strip the churches of any emotion god forbid isaiah saw him isaiah witnessed amen which you and i have witnessed by this message he saw the lord upon his throne a throne type in the heart of the bride of jesus christ amen he saw him on his throne there amongst all the seraphims and in his presence the seraphims cried out holy holy holy unto the lord his the earth is full of his glory amen even the posts of the door were shaken by the noise of their worship amen smoke filled the sanctuary you say it's oh brother brother nathan all this emotion and whooping hollering that's out of order amen i'll tell you what's in order in the presence of jesus christ before his throne is holy holy worthy unto the lamb amen a new song a new worship a new zeal a new joy if the bride of jesus christ can't be free to worship her husband who can what kind of a marriage some of our teachers must have around this message amen brother aaron you know when i spend a little time with my beloved bride she's everything to me she's my world she's my wife she's part of me and when we're together i don't mind if she enjoys it in fact it pleases me when she's pleased to be in my presence it pleases me when she has when she has good things to say about me when she when she begins to open her heart to me and i believe it pleases the lord for his people to worship him i believe it gives him pleasure amen isaiah saw this isaiah came into the presence of the lord and there was an emotion he was overcome he said woe is me i'm a man of unclean lips friends you talk about this message what it means to me as a young man when i when i went past amen just the message that that that my parents taught me when they became more than what i heard over the pulpit since i was a little boy and i began to crack these the books of this message open for the first time and see the words the words just jump off the page and become a reality to me when i re i remember where i was amen where i was going what i was feeling the first time i read christ the mystery of god revealed and saw the revelation of christ in me the hope of glory friends it's everything to me amen and and and i i'm here to tell you there's a genuine reaction in my heart what an all there is i'll never forget it friends over and over time i've been moved to tears by this message amen why because to me it's not more than a teaching it's more than the beliefs of a man or the thoughts of a man but it's the body word of the son of man becoming a reality to me it's everything to me it gives me joy it gives me peace it causes me to so some days it causes me to shout some days it causes me to to dance some days it causes me to cry some days it causes me to bow my head in meditation amen but one thing i am is free free to express back to god the genuine and honest reactions of my heart amen to the revelation of this word friends anything else oh oh when when the joy begins to fill me when i when i begin to see the victory of the church when i begin to see the inevitability of this bride of the potential in her that will be realized to take a rapture to overcome laodicea how could i not shout it would be a sin not to shout because it would be a dishonesty because it's in my heart and so what i'm teaching this morning is don't be anybody you're not don't try to copy anyone else or imitate anyone else's experience but be free be free to express to god amen the genuine reaction of of this word and you know people will criticize it but amen after the way that's called heresy so worship by the god of my fathers brother brahm said criticism is on account of the word of god is only growing pains of his grace amen there will be a reaction every prophet that experienced this presence was affected brother branham said brother braham said oh he said those revelations in the presence of that ball of fire hanging there in the room he said brother since i was a child every time it comes near me it alarms me it almost puts me in an unconscious condition you never get used to it you can't it's too sacred give me that religion a god that can be experienced a god that can come down a godda can speak to me you know when i'm discouraged how many times amen brother aaron has he come to you in the car or in the shower or in your bedroom or in your prayer closet or whatever it is brother ed he comes and amen you're not even thinking about god you've got your mind on maybe the the pressures of this life or the duties of a of a husband and a father and those things are weighing heavy on you and all of a sudden your mind just goes to a scripture or a quote or to a song and the presence of god comes down right where you are and speaks to you that's real that's true that's that's him you don't get used to that amen there's a lot of people trying to masquerade sanctification as a real experience with god but friends if it's a real experience with god amen it doesn't get it doesn't it it's not cold it's not unfeeling it's real it's real i know this message has gotten so religious and complicated to people where the teaching has become so advanced and things until they become afraid of any emotion like it would be it would be pentecostal which is apparently a dirty word now or that it would be wildfire it'd be fanaticism you know there's an old song that does away with all those teachings and doctrines and it makes it real simple and the words go like this i sing because i shout because i dance because i'm happy hey man and brother sister to be here with you believe in this message hearing this word i'm so happy and that's that's who i am friends what do you call somebody who's excited but he can't shout he's happy but he can't dance or he's moved but he can't cry that's not mature that's dead amen amen but you know i think i'm getting maybe to the age you know i know what it's like as a young person to have an experience with god maybe get a little emotional or something and then be under the weight of what somebody might think or the criticism or something but i think i'm getting to be a big boy now and i'm not worrying so much about what somebody else thinks i just want to experience god i want something real friends and brother if you're you might be sitting here today and i know this is quite a challenging statement and i'm not here to be combative i'm really just here to lay a foundation for for a more positive direction tonight but you're stuck in that sanctification court and you can talk about all the candlesticks and the church ages and the teachings but you haven't got your bells yet amen you might be smarter than me but you're not deeper i'm in there i'm in there i've gone past the triple veil the world's shut out to me churches are shut out to me what people think what people say i'm not listening to it i can't hear it i'm in there i'm in that shekinah and in his presence his fullness of joy amen oh friends he talked about the third poll amen what was it the lord told him he showed him this he showed him this tabernacle he showed him that inner place that holy of holies that little room he said i'll meet you in there amen hell amen brother brother nathan you're trying to be deep no but we'll never see that third pole unless we get in there get in there amen i trust the lord has has used this broken up servant service amen to help somebody you say well brother nathan i got you preachers figured out you know you want to have a you want to get everybody jumping and shouting you know and get everybody all worked up and emotional so you can feel like a big preacher feel like you did something can i be real frank with you i'm not that shallow of a person hey man i'm not that small i i want god's people to be free i'm here to preach this word i want it to be a word of substance i want to be a word that will change a life whether they shout or not whatever it is i'm here to preach the word of life amen but yet i believe the people of god should be free i'll stand to deliver but oh it would be we'd have a much better time if you were free amen and i believe you are free amen he that the son sets free is free indeed so my purpose here i'm just his servant today amen just like in the bible amen there was a man named lazarus who died he was in a condition of death typing this age of spiritual death amen but the voice of god amen called him out of that condition and brought life into that body brought life where there was death what a picture of the new birth what a picture of the baptism of the holy ghost but you know though he was as live as he could be he came he came hobbling out of that tomb amen why because he still had those grave clothes and so jesus not only raised him to life but he gave the servants the commission go and loose him and let him loose him and let him go amen and so i'm here today amen preaching the word of life and my desire is to uh you say brother nathan i've got the holy ghost i had an experience with god decades ago before you were born brother nathan i met god amen but are you are you loose today are you free are you as loose as you could be or as the pressures of this life just just pressed in on you a little bit you can't raise your hands like you used to can't you just don't have that pep in your step hey man you don't have the joy of lord you need a restoration friends amen that's what he's here to do that's what the word that has come is all about i'm just here to i'm here to to ask you lazarus are you alive in there let's all stand amen i appreciate your i appreciate the open spirit of the church tonight not bringing a rebuke of course but hopefully an encouragement amen we've got something real we've got something real a life in a time of death shall we just bow our heads i feel bow our heads and close our eyes and i feel to i feel to make a call amen if there's somebody here in the honesty or heart you say brother nathan it may be one way or the other maybe you've never met this god you're acquainted with religion you're acquainted even with this message you know the quotes you've been taught you've been instructed you belong to a good church with good people but you've never met him could be that way or it could be could be someone who's had experiences with god you know that you're a christian you know you've been born again but the pressures of this life have oppressed you have restricted you have have wrapped you up tight oh brother nathan i just need a release i need a release somebody by the lifting a hand would you would you bear witness to that amen oh the words had an effect on the hearts of the people amen and now there's a desire in the heart amen feeling the pulling of this word amen feeling it tugging on you saying it's it's it's him he's he he he's he's sent a message i've not preached my own thoughts i've preached the message of the hour and it's pulling on you it's drawing on you that's him trying to draw you onto himself back into fellowship back into a restoration or maybe for the first time you're pressing beyond that triple veil and saying god i gotta get past the group past the church past religion i've got to meet you today oh heavenly father father you see the insufficiency of humanity god how do we try and we work and we put in effort we live religious lives but it falls flat lord under our own efforts but god you've promised in your word that this bride lord even in this end time even in this miserable age would have life she'd have peace she'd have joy she'd have a real experience with you a true fellowship with you god may it be reality to everyone that's gathered here today father may somebody be baptized with this holy ghost be born again into this new and living way be shut in with you lord in a real experience father where wouldn't be just the manna lord the temporary manna of a church service lord working on their emotions but that they come into a fellowship with you where the man is always fresh and it never goes stale oh god make it a reality and to those of us lord that have stood through time lord we've taken damage we've gone through trials lord we've gone this church lord as lord as seeking your will for a pastor lord they've gone up they've gone some time now lord it's it's hard it's it's a it's a it's a testing lord it's a tribulation but oh god may you renew lord their strength may there be a restoration of life may there be a re-baptism of the holy ghost may none of us leave this place the same o god but may we press sin behind the veil lord and fellowship with you and your shekinah may there be a noise in every heart lord a reaction to your presence holy holy unto the lord we seek you lord we worship you we love you god bless you saints if you're desiring prayer this morning i'm happy to pray with you but i'll turn it over to brother aaron god bless you there's a holy hush in the building i believe his presence has come to have
