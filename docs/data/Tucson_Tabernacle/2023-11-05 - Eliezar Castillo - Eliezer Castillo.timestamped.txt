[0:00] 40 he says things that are to
[0:02] be things that are now that's where
[0:06] we're at right now things that are now
[0:08] are only
[0:10] potential calling for uh calling for the
[0:14] things that are to
[0:17] be and and my message is what I am to
[0:22] be so what I am now I'm only potential
[0:28] of what I'm going to be amen
[0:30] and you are all living in a potential
[0:34] right
[0:34] now and and the the the the word
[0:38] potential is the existing
[0:42] impossibility it's capable of
[0:44] development in into
[0:47] actuality what it is it's a a dormant
[0:51] power it's a hidden strength that hasn't
[0:54] been manifested
[0:56] yet but it's in each and every person
[0:59] and and and right now we are only the
[1:02] potential of what we are going to
[1:06] be but it's not so much in the future
[1:09] the way we think it's going to be when
[1:10] we see Jesus when we're in the Rapture
[1:13] but I believe that we are potentially
[1:16] manifesting it every single day the
[1:18] closer we get to the
[1:20] Lord and the only reason is not to
[1:23] glorify ourselves not to say oh I'm this
[1:25] or I'm that but it's so that we could
[1:27] give to other people yes so that we
[1:30] could display Jesus Christ to those that
[1:33] are less
[1:34] fortunate so that we could be that
[1:37] reflection and brother Bram I know he
[1:39] would always say about that old black
[1:42] sister that she would say I'm I'm not
[1:46] what I ought to be and I'm not what I
[1:49] want to be but I'm so glad that I'm not
[1:53] what I used to
[1:55] be and and for every Christian when
[1:58] brother bam says this comforted by those
[2:01] words because we see our failures we see
[2:05] everything we are and we we have an
[2:08] expected end and we see our condition
[2:10] and sometimes it's
[2:11] overwhelming to see our expected end or
[2:14] to see the vision and yet see our
[2:18] condition and we say ah man I'm not what
[2:20] I I'm supposed to
[2:23] be but I'm glad that I'm not what I used
[2:26] to be
[2:27] am and I started to think think about
[2:30] that about we rejoice in that I'm not
[2:33] I'm glad that I'm not what I used to
[2:37] be but if you think about that the first
[2:40] words brother bam says
[2:42] that I'm glad that I'm not what I used
[2:45] to be that shows that God has saved
[2:49] us and that that shows that by grace and
[2:53] only by Grace God has took us out of the
[2:57] place that we used to be
[3:00] so in thinking about those words and
[3:03] thinking about that thing that brother
[3:05] brandham says that I'm so glad that I'm
[3:07] not what I used to be then I I I'm
[3:10] comforted by the words I'm not what I'm
[3:12] supposed to
[3:13] be and I'm not what what I'm what I want
[3:17] to be because if God has taken me by
[3:21] Grace from what I used to be to what I'm
[3:23] now I know by Grace he's gonna take me
[3:26] on I know by Grace he's gonna allow me
[3:30] to develop because because the I'm not
[3:34] what I'm supposed to be is means that
[3:36] you still got
[3:37] potential it means you still got dormant
[3:41] power in you it means that you haven't
[3:44] hidden strength
[3:46] still and that there's still development
[3:48] that needs to be
[3:50] done I'd rather be that than say I'm all
[3:54] finished in this broken up condition I
[3:57] might look nice in my suit I might look
[4:00] like this and that but I'm still broken
[4:02] up to compare to what I'm supposed to be
[4:05] so I don't want to be satisfied of who I
[4:09] am right now I want more I want more and
[4:12] I want more and I want more of
[4:16] God I want more and what that means is
[4:19] each and every one of us has potential
[4:22] inside of
[4:23] us and that potential is a hidden
[4:26] strength from
[4:28] God it's a hidden power that is not
[4:31] developed yet well brother I've been in
[4:34] the message 50 years it doesn't matter
[4:36] if you're Paul Paul said I press toward
[4:40] the mark of the High Calling he says I
[4:43] haven't come I haven't apprehended yet
[4:46] imagine that man saying
[4:47] that that man that that the Bible says
[4:50] he went up to the third Heavens yet he
[4:52] says I count not myself to apprehend it
[4:56] yet but I I forget about those things
[4:59] that are in the past and I press towards
[5:03] the mark of the High
[5:05] Calling that's where we're at today
[5:08] whether you're a new Christian whether
[5:11] you started your your journey in the
[5:12] Lord or you've been here for 20 years
[5:16] we're marching on you still have
[5:19] potential because you still have Breath
[5:22] of Life in you and that means there's
[5:25] more of God to receive and there's more
[5:27] of God to give to other people
[5:31] that's where we're at
[5:33] today
[5:35] potential is not what's already been
[5:38] done potential means there is more to
[5:42] come brothers and
[5:43] sisters and all of that potential of
[5:47] Eternity is in you
[5:51] now sometimes I look here and I look
[5:54] there to find a fulfillment of
[5:58] God but all all of that
[6:00] potential the Bible said he that
[6:04] predestinated you has already called you
[6:08] and he that has called you has already
[6:09] Justified you and he that has Justified
[6:12] you has already glorified you so
[6:16] everything that that you need for your
[6:19] journey
[6:20] today everything that you're going to
[6:23] have to go through is already inside you
[6:26] right
[6:27] now brother brandham says in the Easter
[6:30] seal preached in 1965 in paragraph 97 he
[6:33] says now notice it's the earnest or the
[6:39] potential the quickening power of your
[6:41] Resurrection when you receive the holy
[6:44] spirit is dwelling in you the potential
[6:47] of
[6:49] it brother we're waiting for that
[6:52] Resurrection we're waiting for those
[6:54] body changes and he says it's already in
[6:57] you potentially
[7:00] you've got the potential in it when you
[7:02] receive the Holy Spirit but but if we
[7:05] continue on even before the Holy Spirit
[7:08] you already have the potential in
[7:11] you let's see what brother brandham says
[7:14] he says in the exposition of the seven
[7:16] Church ages in the sard sardan church
[7:19] age he says and the way it was done was
[7:22] by God's perfect will and
[7:25] programming now he's going to talk about
[7:28] Lutheran Methodist
[7:29] and Pentecostal and he's going to talk
[7:32] about how the seven Church ages they
[7:34] went from these
[7:37] stages historically he says the way it
[7:40] was done was by God's perfect will and
[7:43] programming the lutherans had the Holy
[7:46] Ghost potentially under
[7:50] justification the Methodist had it
[7:53] potentially under sanctification and
[7:56] today it is brought back a restoration
[7:59] the Holy Ghost is
[8:02] here and now we are living those Church
[8:06] ages
[8:08] individually when somebody gives their
[8:10] heart to the Lord they have been
[8:15] Justified and if you've been Justified
[8:17] it means you were predestinated in the
[8:20] beginning that's what the Bible says in
[8:23] Romans so so whenever you've already
[8:26] received justification you already have
[8:29] have the
[8:31] potential and whenever you're Sanctified
[8:34] you're potentially receive the Holy
[8:38] Ghost but he says now the Holy Ghost is
[8:41] here there's no more waiting there's no
[8:45] more waiting and waiting and waiting you
[8:47] could receive the Holy Ghost as you sit
[8:49] here today you could receive it you
[8:53] could receive eternal
[8:56] life now he says
[9:01] God the great God if you've got eternal
[9:04] life The Germ of Life Of God was in God
[9:09] at the beginning so if you've got
[9:11] eternal
[9:12] life that eternal life was already in
[9:15] God and that's a piece of God and that's
[9:19] you
[9:21] okay and you were there you were in his
[9:24] thinking your name and all and he by
[9:27] Foreign knowledge or dained you to see
[9:30] this he already knew what kind of color
[9:34] of hair I would have my name how what I
[9:38] would do all of my
[9:42] mistakes sometimes we think that things
[9:44] are just happened coincidentally or or
[9:48] or by accident we do not live as
[9:51] Christians by
[9:53] accident it could be a surprise for me
[9:56] and you but it's not accident to God
[9:58] it's for
[10:02] ordained he says we did not become seed
[10:05] see we are the germ or we are seeds
[10:08] today each and every person that has
[10:11] believed in Jesus Christ we are
[10:13] seeds and he says we did not become seed
[10:17] by the
[10:18] rebirth we are seed and therefore we
[10:21] were
[10:22] reborn only the elect can be reborn
[10:26] because we were seed and is the reason
[10:29] we could be
[10:31] quickened so you already have the seed
[10:34] in
[10:35] you and and whenever you receive the
[10:38] holy spirit all the holy spirit is doing
[10:40] is quickening that life that was there
[10:43] in the beginning with
[10:45] God that's who you are and no matter
[10:49] what the devil says no matter what your
[10:51] own mind tries to tell you of who you
[10:53] are you were there in the beginning and
[10:56] everything is on purpose
[10:59] that's what I love about God's word that
[11:02] if you
[11:04] truly understand that every single word
[11:08] every single period every single cross
[11:10] te and dotted eye in the word is on
[11:13] purpose this Bible becomes a new Bible
[11:16] and nothing is by accident so all of the
[11:20] begats so and so begat that person so
[11:23] and so God begat him and them and that's
[11:25] all on purpose and there is a message
[11:28] there too
[11:29] amen every single word in this Bible is
[11:32] on
[11:33] purpose and as far as I know we were in
[11:36] this
[11:37] word and you are on purpose you are
[11:41] intentional God has predestined you the
[11:44] Bible
[11:46] says I want to read it again it's in
[11:48] Romans 8:30 he says moreover whom he did
[11:54] predestinate them he also called and
[11:57] whom he also called them he also
[12:00] Justified and whom he justified them he
[12:04] also
[12:06] glorified that word
[12:08] predestined is a very very amazing word
[12:11] for us because pre means before
[12:16] destination means
[12:19] end even before we
[12:22] were a twinkle in God's eye even before
[12:27] there was an Adam there we were already
[12:32] predestinated pre means before
[12:35] destination means end that means that
[12:37] that when he had you in his
[12:40] thinking he already set your end before
[12:44] you even
[12:46] started he already put everything that
[12:49] you're going to need for the journey
[12:52] inside you before you even were born in
[12:55] this
[12:56] earth that's what predestined means
[13:00] that we are packed we're
[13:03] full of
[13:05] life what our healing that we're waiting
[13:08] on God for is in us
[13:11] already the holy ghost that we're asking
[13:14] for that peace of God it's already in us
[13:17] and that seed that already brother Bram
[13:19] says already has the transforming power
[13:22] inside of
[13:23] itself it just needs the word it just
[13:26] needs the gospel preached to it and
[13:29] something happens to
[13:32] it brother brandham
[13:35] says or I'm going to go to Genesis 1:1
[13:39] and
[13:40] 12 it says and God said let the Earth
[13:43] bring forth grass and the herb yielding
[13:47] seed and the fruit
[13:50] tree yielding fruit after its kind whose
[13:54] seed is in
[13:57] itself so the fruit of after his kind
[14:00] whose seed is already inside of it upon
[14:04] the Earth and it was so and the Earth
[14:06] brought forth grass and Herb yielding
[14:08] seed after its kind and the tree
[14:10] yielding fre fruit whose seed was in
[14:13] itself after his kind and God saw that
[14:17] it was
[14:18] good when God in the beginning laid
[14:22] forth the seeds he said every single
[14:26] seed is going to have every single tree
[14:28] that you see here
[14:31] today all the forest that you see
[14:34] started with the
[14:36] seed sometimes the seed doesn't look too
[14:39] pretty I I was um forgive me Brothers
[14:43] but I was there just rumaging there in
[14:45] the in the office and I saw the mustard
[14:47] seats there you guys have sitting there
[14:50] little tiny mustard seat right
[14:52] there tiny tiny tiny if I drop it I'm
[14:55] going to lose it if I had one in my hand
[14:58] that's how how tiny it is but inside of
[15:02] that seed holds one of such a large
[15:07] large
[15:08] tree and within that tree holds
[15:12] thousands and thousands more
[15:15] seeds and inside of every individual
[15:18] seed holds more another tree that holds
[15:21] more seeds that holds more trees that
[15:23] holds more seeds that holds more
[15:25] trees all the way to the end
[15:29] inside one
[15:31] seed that's who we
[15:34] are Jesus says in Revelations 1 18 he
[15:37] says I am the Alpha and the
[15:40] Omega I am beginning and I am end inside
[15:45] that man had the beginning and the end
[15:49] inside of
[15:50] him he was a stoop shouldered man when
[15:53] they saw him nobody um cared about who
[15:56] he was yet inside of him was everything
[16:00] all life all of God's attributes
[16:03] everything that God wanted to express to
[16:06] you and I was in that man Jesus
[16:09] Christ my
[16:12] salvation everything that I needed that
[16:15] was in
[16:18] him when God created the seed he put its
[16:21] purpose in it and it put the a potential
[16:24] to achieve that
[16:26] purpose whatever you might be whatever
[16:29] God has called you to do God has put a
[16:33] purpose inside
[16:34] you an eternal
[16:37] purpose sometimes we feel like oh well
[16:40] maybe I'm not supposed to do anything no
[16:42] God wants you to be working amen when
[16:46] you have a purpose in your heart he'll
[16:48] put every potential he'll put his power
[16:51] in you so that you could fulfill that
[16:53] potential or that
[16:56] purpose and whenever we have that Vision
[16:58] whenever we have that goal inside of us
[17:02] it gives us a clear path of where to go
[17:06] because when we don't have Vision when
[17:08] we don't have a goal we're not we're not
[17:10] going to know where to
[17:12] go I can come to church every single
[17:15] Sunday every single Wednesday and and
[17:17] still if I don't have a purpose of God
[17:20] if God is not in my vision Jesus Christ
[17:24] then I'm just I'm just wandering around
[17:27] I'm taking any path I can can take even
[17:29] though I I look like a
[17:30] Christian even though I look good in a
[17:33] suit even though I have my family here
[17:36] if I don't have my purpose as Jesus
[17:39] Christ then I'm wandering Any Which
[17:42] Way But when you have Jesus Christ in
[17:46] Your Vision many of us have many
[17:49] Ambitions and we have a purpose to be
[17:52] successful that's great brother brandham
[17:55] says let's be sane Christians and work
[17:58] to the the very
[17:59] minute and let's do what we have to do
[18:02] if you're a mechanic if you're this he
[18:04] said if you're hoing potatoes or if
[18:07] you're planting wheat he says God will
[18:10] find me
[18:12] there until the very
[18:15] end so that that's what we should be
[18:18] doing but then we should be centered in
[18:21] the greatest ambition the greatest
[18:24] Vision which is Jesus
[18:26] Christ and whenever we have that all of
[18:29] our our family our work our successes
[18:33] our adventures whatever we want to do if
[18:36] it's centered in Jesus Christ oh man
[18:40] you're going to be the best at what you
[18:42] do you're going to have everything that
[18:45] that you need for the
[18:48] journey so God when he created all those
[18:52] seeds the Bible says in that seventh day
[18:55] he
[18:56] rested he didn't have to plant no
[18:59] more he didn't have to work and continue
[19:01] to work and continue to uh to bring
[19:04] forth seed and trees no everything that
[19:07] was
[19:09] in that seed that seed had everything to
[19:14] transform
[19:16] itself and that's why we have this
[19:19] beautiful desert that's why we have
[19:21] beautiful forests and jungles and all of
[19:23] that because those seeds had all the
[19:25] power and the transforming power brother
[19:28] brandham says and what is that
[19:30] transforming power where is
[19:34] it we we come to church so we can we can
[19:37] receive something but from God we go go
[19:40] here we go to conventions we go there
[19:42] but the transforming power is in you
[19:46] already that's where it's at where
[19:48] wherever you might be you might be in
[19:50] your closet in your
[19:52] room you might be at work you might be
[19:55] driving and that transforming power can
[19:58] transform you where you are
[20:00] at it's not a
[20:03] location it's not some some great
[20:06] preacher here and there it's
[20:08] you God already put everything inside of
[20:15] you when God told Adam to
[20:19] multiply Adam already had everybody
[20:22] inside of
[20:24] him he had all the
[20:27] potential was once he told Abraham he
[20:29] said he said your your seed is going to
[20:32] be like the Sands of the
[20:34] sea and and like the stars in the
[20:37] sky your seed from one man he had the
[20:41] all of Israel in
[20:44] him and and when he told Adam that Adam
[20:47] was supposed to do that he was supposed
[20:49] to bring forth not only life naturally
[20:52] but he was supposed to bring forth
[20:54] eternal life yes through him
[20:58] he was supposed to that spoken word he
[21:01] was supposed to give that life to each
[21:03] and every person but we know that he
[21:05] failed and and he multiplied sin in
[21:09] everything that's what he gave to
[21:12] everybody was sin was failure was
[21:16] problems and the Bible says that through
[21:18] one man all are Fallen under sin because
[21:22] he that's what he multiplied because he
[21:25] fell and it was all in him when that
[21:29] came out sin came
[21:31] out but then Jesus fulfilled God's
[21:36] desire the Bible says that we were in
[21:40] him we were in Jesus
[21:43] Christ I I've heard many many people say
[21:47] and I think even brother bradam said
[21:49] that man Jesus lived a solitary
[21:53] life Jesus didn't have the pleasures
[21:56] that we could have
[21:58] he he he couldn't have a girlfriend he
[22:02] couldn't have a wife and
[22:04] family he couldn't have a great
[22:07] career because because he had a purpose
[22:11] to be
[22:13] done but but I
[22:16] realized in the message things that are
[22:18] to be that his bride he that's all he
[22:22] was doing was working for his
[22:26] bride getting things
[22:28] ready see when you're about to get
[22:31] married you start getting the house
[22:33] ready you make sure she has a home to
[22:36] live under you make sure everything is
[22:39] good before you guys say your idos you
[22:42] prepare a
[22:43] mansion might be a little home might be
[22:47] a little humble place there it might be
[22:49] a nice place but you're preparing your
[22:52] Mansion Jes Jesus says I go to prepare a
[22:55] mansion I go to prepare a place for you
[22:59] I'll come back and as Jesus as he was
[23:03] walking even though he seemed alone the
[23:06] Bible says and the message declares that
[23:08] the bride was already in
[23:11] him just like Adam Adam was all alone
[23:14] and God says it is not good for man to
[23:16] be
[23:17] alone so he didn't go and get another
[23:20] piece of dirt out of
[23:23] Adam out of him because he's a seed out
[23:26] of him produce his
[23:29] bride and Jesus whenever he was being
[23:32] when the spirit of God left him in
[23:34] Gethsemane it says that the bride was
[23:37] there with
[23:38] him the bride was there and when he died
[23:41] he died for her and the Bible says that
[23:45] that if the if the uh corn of wheat fall
[23:49] into the ground and it die it biteth
[23:52] alone but if it die it bringeth forth
[23:56] much fruit amen he was alone but inside
[24:01] of him had all the life and he had to
[24:03] die he had to be planted so much fruit
[24:06] can come out of him he was that seed and
[24:09] now we are the result of Jesus
[24:13] Christ maybe we lived a certain life
[24:17] back then maybe we're we're still
[24:19] struggling to be Christians maybe we're
[24:21] solid in the Lord but God has called
[24:24] each and every
[24:26] seed and we are a product of that man
[24:30] Jesus
[24:31] Christ he died alone but inside of him
[24:34] had millions and millions and millions
[24:36] of souls waiting and crying and saying
[24:39] praise the Lord there has been a lamb
[24:42] worthy to open up that book who was he
[24:45] he was the slame lamb he was the only
[24:47] one worthy because he paid the price for
[24:50] you and
[24:52] I that was Jesus Christ for us he
[24:56] suffered and we suffered with him we
[24:59] died with him we were buried with him
[25:02] and now you are risen with him and
[25:05] manifests his attributes of God setting
[25:09] in Heavenly places brother brandham says
[25:12] that in the things that are to be that
[25:14] right now we're manifesting his
[25:20] attributes and he was able to say it is
[25:23] finished and now you have all that power
[25:28] in you but remember it's it's dormant
[25:31] it's a hidden and it's inactive and it
[25:34] needs to be
[25:36] developed you have to act on it you have
[25:39] to take your step of Faith you have to
[25:42] believe that God by his grace he could
[25:46] offer more within
[25:49] you
[25:51] now all we have to do is accept it
[25:54] brother brandham said that if Jesus
[25:57] Christ was here to this morning or when
[25:59] he was talking he said if Jesus Christ
[26:02] was here tonight he can't do no more for
[26:04] you
[26:05] amen imagine Jesus Christ with with his
[26:09] blood and his
[26:11] nails and and brother baram says he
[26:14] can't do no more for
[26:15] you because he did everything on the
[26:19] cross everything that you need has
[26:22] already been done brothers and
[26:25] sisters if you need the Holy Ghost it's
[26:28] here amen if you need healing if you
[26:31] need restoration if you need your family
[26:34] amen it's already
[26:37] here and he's ready to give it to you we
[26:41] have to step up and say lord it's for
[26:45] me we have to take that that purpose and
[26:49] that potential and move on with it and
[26:52] say Lord I'm gonna grab it I'm gonna
[26:54] take everything that you have to offer
[26:57] me and and I'm going to be greedy about
[26:59] it we we have to be greedy about what
[27:02] God has given us because the more we
[27:05] give the more he has to give God is
[27:09] never exhausted in power he's never
[27:11] exhausted in
[27:13] healing the more you take the more he
[27:16] wants to give believe me on
[27:18] that I'm I'm a testimony of that my wife
[27:21] is a testimony if if if God wouldn't
[27:24] have healed her I don't know where I
[27:25] would be at if God wouldn't have saved
[27:28] me I don't know where I would be at but
[27:30] because of his healing power because of
[27:33] his salvation I'm standing here
[27:35] today just as a little
[27:38] testimony just as a little light for
[27:41] those that are in my work or somebody
[27:43] some of my family I'm there as a little
[27:46] light showing the the manifested glory
[27:49] of
[27:50] God maybe it sounds tremendous oh you
[27:53] are the manifested word no it's your
[27:56] daily life
[27:58] your little light that you give to
[28:00] people that's manifesting the word of
[28:02] God
[28:03] today everything that you do every word
[28:07] that you speak you're giving life to
[28:11] somebody there was a story in the Bible
[28:14] it's it's in Matthew 25 and he talks
[28:17] about a
[28:19] man this this this great man that go
[28:22] went to another country because he was
[28:25] going to get his kingdom
[28:28] and and he had all these servants and he
[28:31] said you know what I'm going to a far
[28:33] country but I'll be back to receive my
[28:36] kingdom and he says I'm going to give
[28:39] you talents I'm going to give you coins
[28:42] I'm going to give you money I'm going to
[28:43] give you
[28:45] something and he the Bible says that he
[28:48] one he gave five talents and the other
[28:51] he gave two and the other one he gave
[28:53] one and he said he given it to them
[28:55] according to their
[28:58] ability God will give you the potential
[29:02] according to your
[29:04] ability he'll give you something a
[29:06] purpose in your life a gift in your life
[29:10] according to your
[29:12] ability each and every one of us God has
[29:15] given us something and that's the Holy
[29:18] Ghost the Bible says that the Holy Ghost
[29:21] is a
[29:22] gift and when I think about gifts oh man
[29:26] I who doesn't love
[29:28] gifts that's mine that's that's for my
[29:34] salvation that's for my restoration
[29:37] that's for my my mind to be sane that's
[29:40] for my healing that's for my protection
[29:44] that's he is my comforter he is
[29:46] everything to me that's for
[29:48] me but whenever he said he given the
[29:51] gift of the Holy Spirit and he's given
[29:54] the Holy Spirit as a gift he also INSP
[29:57] Spanish they call it
[29:59] Thon it means that he it it's it's a
[30:06] responsibility it's it's a gift a talent
[30:11] that God has given you every single
[30:14] thing and that kind of gift it's not
[30:17] just for us now it's to give to other
[30:20] people it's to be put into work amen and
[30:25] when God has given us the holy spirit
[30:27] it's just not so that I can stay
[30:29] home come to church go home go to work
[30:32] come to church go home go work and
[30:35] that's
[30:36] it but it's for me to
[30:39] use and me to work with and whenever I
[30:43] know that there's somebody that is in
[30:45] need
[30:47] nobody's nobody's uh talked to them but
[30:50] God has put that in your heart God is
[30:53] doing something God's saying here I gave
[30:56] you this Talent
[30:57] I giving you this gift to use it Lord
[31:01] I'm not a preacher Lord I'm not a singer
[31:03] Lord I I don't know what to do but you
[31:05] can give them your
[31:08] testimony you can just be an open ear to
[31:11] them a lot of people just need somebody
[31:14] to sit there and and sympathize and
[31:17] empathize with
[31:18] them what I've realized is one of the
[31:21] greatest
[31:22] gifts I I heard this from a brother and
[31:25] it hit me like a ton of bre bricks he
[31:28] said one of the greatest gifts you can
[31:30] have is
[31:33] empathy but empathy comes with a great
[31:36] price
[31:37] yes the brother that was talking about
[31:41] this just lost his
[31:44] son he lost his son from
[31:48] drugs and instead of saying why why did
[31:51] God take my child why did God do this he
[31:55] said God gave me a gift
[31:58] that I could empathize with those that
[32:00] have lost their
[32:02] children and I know exactly what they're
[32:04] going through and now I can be the help
[32:06] for them what a
[32:09] gift brother brandham says there there
[32:12] was never one crosseyed person come to
[32:15] him without being
[32:17] healed that came with a
[32:19] price every time he would see that
[32:22] person he thought of his little baby
[32:24] girl how she was suffering so much much
[32:27] that her eyes
[32:29] crossed and now every time somebody
[32:32] would come he would see her and he say
[32:35] that's that's my
[32:37] baby whenever he would see the old
[32:40] Spanish man he said without shoes he
[32:42] said that's my dad he didn't say oh
[32:45] there's this man oh he didn't say oh
[32:47] well I don't know who this person is he
[32:50] started to look at his father how he was
[32:52] 50 some years old and he died because he
[32:55] was a drunk but yet he gave his heart to
[32:57] the Lord at the very end he saw his dad
[33:01] and he said that man had to be
[33:04] healed why because he had the gift of
[33:07] empathy he
[33:10] suffered he suffered so that he could
[33:13] give and brothers sometimes our
[33:16] suffering we don't know why we're going
[33:18] through it sometimes we don't know why
[33:20] our Trials Come A like waves they come
[33:25] like waves not knowing God is preparing
[33:28] you to give eternal life to somebody
[33:32] else to to give Li words of
[33:35] encouragement to somebody that needs it
[33:38] and only you can understand that person
[33:41] so he gave these people talents
[33:44] according to their ability according to
[33:47] their
[33:48] purpose he gave them this
[33:51] potential and God will give you a
[33:53] certain amount of potential according to
[33:55] your purpose and one one he went with
[33:58] that five and what did he do he doubled
[34:00] his
[34:01] propit and whenever the king came back
[34:04] as the king the righteous King he said
[34:07] what have you done with my talents he
[34:08] said I've doubled it for you
[34:10] Lord the two came and he doubled it to
[34:13] four and he said praise
[34:15] God he doubled
[34:18] it then he went to the one that had the
[34:21] one the gift that he gave
[34:24] him and he went and he hid it
[34:28] he said he said I don't want to lose it
[34:30] I I don't want anything to happen to it
[34:32] I'm going to hide
[34:34] it the gift that God gave him the
[34:38] potential God gave him with his ability
[34:41] God knew he had the ability to do it but
[34:44] he instead he hid
[34:47] it and when he said well why didn't you
[34:50] do anything with it the Bible actually
[34:54] says he says I was
[34:55] afraid
[34:57] I was afraid Lord I didn't know what to
[35:00] do with it I was
[35:02] afraid many times we we hide from what
[35:06] God has called us to
[35:08] do it's easier to hide from the gift
[35:11] that God has called us when you know
[35:13] there is a call a deep deep calling
[35:16] coming from Heaven to your
[35:19] soul but we're hide we're hiding from
[35:22] our gift we're hiding from the potential
[35:25] that God giv potential that God has
[35:28] given
[35:30] us and when God one day has to come he
[35:33] says what have you done with what I've
[35:35] given you Lord I'm I was just too
[35:38] afraid I was too scared to use my gift I
[35:42] was too scared to testify I was too
[35:45] scared to tell that person before they
[35:47] got into that car and started drunk
[35:49] driving I was too
[35:52] scared but today is the day we still
[35:57] alive brothers and sisters and each and
[35:59] every one of you have potential
[36:01] according to your
[36:03] ability you God has given you his
[36:06] eternal
[36:08] power not not when you were born not
[36:11] when you accepted Christ he
[36:13] predestinated that potential in you he
[36:16] already knew who you were going to be he
[36:18] already knew all of your plans all of
[36:21] your detours everything you were going
[36:23] to do and he says I'm going to place it
[36:25] in them because they are my faithful
[36:28] servant they are the ones to carry on
[36:30] this Mission God has missions for each
[36:33] and every one of you wherever it might
[36:36] be whatever whoever it might be to God
[36:39] has given it to
[36:40] us the worst feeling for me is not
[36:43] making mistakes Brothers Brothers we
[36:47] make well I won't include you in that
[36:50] you guys might be perfect but I make so
[36:52] many
[36:54] mistakes I make too many
[36:57] sometimes it hurts other
[36:59] people sometimes sometimes I I I just
[37:02] make these little mistakes that I
[37:04] shouldn't have made him but you know
[37:06] what that's not the worst
[37:08] feeling my worst feeling is the should
[37:11] have would have could
[37:12] have that's the worst feeling I'd rather
[37:16] go I'd rather go to God's purpose
[37:19] knowing that I'm just a baby and I'm
[37:22] going to fall and I'm going to get back
[37:24] up and I'm I'm not going to make the
[37:26] right decision ision sometimes but I'm
[37:28] going and I'm fulfilling God's purpose
[37:31] I'd rather do that than say man I should
[37:33] have done that I could have done that I
[37:35] would have done that but I didn't do it
[37:39] I was afraid Lord no I'd rather
[37:43] go as much as I can and I know by Grace
[37:47] if he has taken me out of the World by
[37:49] Grace he's going to take me
[37:51] on that's what that's our life
[37:54] today mistakes we make
[37:57] brother Bram says a Christian backslides
[38:00] every
[38:01] day it's getting back up and going it's
[38:05] saying God has a purpose for me I have a
[38:08] mission to do I'm going to do it whether
[38:11] it's to bring your whole family in or
[38:14] it's to preach to thousands or it's to
[38:16] go here or to go there to the sick go to
[38:19] the needy it's whatever it might be
[38:22] maybe it's to suffer so other people
[38:24] don't have to yeah whatever it might be
[38:28] I always sympathize with with Jeremiah
[38:31] because God promised him so much you're
[38:34] going to speak to Kings you're going to
[38:36] speak to monarchs you're going to preach
[38:38] to Nations and he was a little boy
[38:41] saying oh praise God then he finds
[38:44] himself in a dungeon not anybody's
[38:47] dungeon but his own
[38:50] people's tied
[38:52] up
[38:53] suffering nobody listened to him
[38:57] when he said Babylon is coming Babylon
[39:01] is coming Babylon is
[39:03] coming nobody listened to him and then
[39:07] he was there saying Lord you lied to me
[39:09] Lord Lord you promised me all these
[39:12] things
[39:13] Lord and then when he said Lord I don't
[39:16] want to do this anymore I I give up I
[39:19] don't want to do anything no more in
[39:21] that dungeon the Bible says that the
[39:24] word of God came up like fire in his
[39:26] bones and he said I couldn't help but to
[39:30] prophesy that gift is coming out one way
[39:33] or
[39:34] another and and now we are blessed
[39:37] because of that man thousands and
[39:39] thousands of years of people have been
[39:41] blessed and saved because of those
[39:45] books that's
[39:47] us whether you live a good life whether
[39:50] you got to live a hard life we are here
[39:53] to give and and and knowing that that in
[39:56] US is all of eternity inside of each and
[39:59] every
[40:00] person there was that Young Rich
[40:05] ruler as I'm going to just take a little
[40:08] bit more time but there was a young Rich
[40:10] ruler just in his name he was an
[40:14] ambitious
[40:15] man he was rich and he was a
[40:19] ruler so he had Ambitions he had
[40:22] purposes in his life he he if he had a
[40:26] goal he would achieve it he was a young
[40:30] Rich ruler but the Bible says he was
[40:32] lacking
[40:34] something he was still missing
[40:38] something so he goes to the very best
[40:41] person to go to he went to the Fountain
[40:45] of eternal life and he says Jesus I've
[40:49] done everything I could do he said he
[40:53] said how can I receive eternal life
[40:57] I've accomplished this and I
[40:59] accomplished that see a potential is
[41:01] something that has not happened yet him
[41:05] he fulfilled his
[41:07] potential I've done this and I've done
[41:09] that and and I'm successful but Lord I'm
[41:13] still lacking something
[41:15] Lord he
[41:17] says drop
[41:19] everything he looked at that man and he
[41:22] saw all the potential that was in that
[41:25] young man
[41:27] he saw his gift inside of him and he
[41:31] says you drop everything and come and
[41:34] follow
[41:35] me and that man looked and he said all
[41:39] my success and
[41:41] everything no I can't do
[41:43] it and he dropped eternal life and he
[41:47] left and the Bible says that he in the
[41:50] end of his life he had many many
[41:54] storehouses and he had many many many
[41:56] riches and he sat there
[42:00] happy and he said oh my soul is
[42:06] satisfied I I have storehouses here I
[42:09] have this and I am satisfied you know
[42:11] what satisfied means there's no more
[42:15] potential I've completed everything I
[42:18] wanted to
[42:19] do I I'm I'm depleted of potential
[42:24] everything that I've wanted to do on
[42:26] Earth has been
[42:28] done he said I'm
[42:32] satisfied then the next look we see and
[42:35] his eyes are looking up in
[42:38] hell and brother he goes and he cries
[42:42] out to to Abraham says just give me a
[42:46] drink and brother brandham he says in
[42:48] the message come follow me he says that
[42:51] his
[42:53] gift begin to rise up with in him and he
[42:57] wanted to be an evangelist
[43:01] then Jesus when he saw him he saw his
[43:04] gift he saw his potential but whenever
[43:07] he was there in Hell his potential began
[43:09] to rise up and he said go and and I've
[43:13] got Brothers out there in the world that
[43:14] are are not saved please send somebody
[43:18] what his potential begin to rise up
[43:20] inside of
[43:21] him the very potential brother bam says
[43:24] Jesus was going to call him to be an
[43:28] evangelist but he pushed that down so
[43:31] that he could do his Earthly Ambitions
[43:33] that's okay but do what God has called
[43:37] you to do because one soul is worth all
[43:40] of the money that we're going to make is
[43:43] worth more than all the success more
[43:45] than everything all the adventures we're
[43:48] going to take God's going to bless you
[43:50] don't worry but put him
[43:53] first put him first
[43:58] he says people try to put the finger on
[44:02] someone that goes too
[44:05] high he said well it's true we find many
[44:08] people who try to jump instead of fly
[44:10] and they make a wreckage there on the
[44:12] side of the shore but they never try to
[44:15] point the finger to those who doesn't go
[44:18] high
[44:19] enough I encourage you to go
[44:23] jump go as hard as you can for the Lord
[44:27] yes I'd rather that than saying I should
[44:31] have I could have and I would have but I
[44:36] didn't he says that many people here on
[44:40] Earth are living under the god-given
[44:43] privilege and he says I'm not saying
[44:45] that you're
[44:46] lost he says but you're you're you're
[44:50] son and daughter of God you're living
[44:51] under your under your privilege and your
[44:54] conduct each day as the Holy Spirit
[44:57] brings forth it before the father and
[44:59] gives away these things the way that you
[45:01] do and you're still a son and daughter
[45:03] but you'll never be brought up to the
[45:05] place where you should
[45:08] be now each and every one of us have a
[45:12] responsibility and it's not to be the
[45:15] best here or there it's just to give God
[45:18] your very
[45:20] best that God has placed eternal life
[45:23] inside of you and potential Brothers God
[45:28] has potential still well God is God he
[45:32] has everything already no God the Bible
[45:34] says he's
[45:35] omnipotent you know what that
[45:38] means all powerful potent
[45:43] potential he has all potential in him
[45:47] even though he's got eternity to
[45:49] Eternity he still got
[45:52] potential when he created all the
[45:55] galaxies the huge Sun that you see and
[45:58] the great big stars that are greater
[46:00] than this sun all of the galaxies and
[46:03] all of the the the Milky Way that we see
[46:05] and all of the stars and moons and
[46:08] planets and everything and once he did
[46:10] all of that he still had
[46:14] potential he still had more to give yes
[46:17] then he began to create everything on
[46:19] this Earth he created the animals he
[46:21] created the fish the sky he created the
[46:24] birds he created everything creeping
[46:26] thing and all every crawling thing and
[46:28] still yet was he depleted no he still
[46:31] had potential am he still had more in
[46:34] the
[46:35] chamber he still had
[46:38] more and us we have that potential
[46:41] because we are a peace of God today you
[46:44] have everything every Power that he used
[46:47] to create all of that you have it inside
[46:50] you
[46:51] now and the way you receive or you
[46:54] ignite that potential is whenever you
[46:56] see Jesus Christ as a resurrected King
[47:00] when you see him in the Holy
[47:03] Ghost then that Resurrection life has
[47:07] opened up and has re you've received
[47:10] that
[47:11] potential you've received that Awakening
[47:14] Jesus says I am the resurrection and
