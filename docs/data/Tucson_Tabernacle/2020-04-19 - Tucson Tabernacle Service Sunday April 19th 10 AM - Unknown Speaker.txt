the name of the Lord this morning amen I trust that that you are an expectation for what the Lord has for us today and I appreciate all of the singing there from brother Matthew and the church amen and I appreciate your prayers for us here in Buford we're under a tornado watch right now so just continue to pray amen I'm glad I'm able to continue the service at a lot of my heart that I wanted to say to you today and just unburden myself so I just keep us in in remembrance today as we just have some severe weather but we just want to pour our hearts out to you this morning and unburden ourself from what the Lord has given us amen I know that you were there an expectation at home and you in church and so I just believe that we have the great Shepherd amongst us and he is the feeder of the Sheep Amen it's not man who feeds us amen but it's the Holy Spirit and he doesn't give us a natural food food but he gives us a spiritual food amen and I believe that's what our souls are longing for today is that spiritual appetite to be quenched amen so we just want to say God bless you and greet you in the name of the Lord and and and we're looking forward to the time when we can gather again all together today we'd like to just say that we'd like to dis minister to you this morning on something and I'm going to just say that you know through this livestream that we have we're grateful for it we know it's not like Church it's not like Gathering it's very different some of you are disjointed there and we're we're disconnected some at home some you know in their offices this morning in their living rooms some gathered at church I'm here today in a building preached into a camera and and and no no life people here you know to to pull on the Word of God no music for an atmosphere live music but but you know let me just say this brother Branham said and brother Arne sent me this quote and it's meant so much to me since he sent it to me and brother Branham says the distance means nothing to God he said brother Branham said that some of the greatest miracle that ever took place in his ministry were over the phone on a telephone praying for somebody who was sick somebody who was in need and so so this morning we know that distance means nothing to God and God I believe God has given us grace in these kind of times I believe that he's I've I've witnessed that myself here preaching excuse me preaching and yet I feel like there's a crowd of people even though just here by myself I can feel the pull of the word I can feel the pull upon your hearts it's been incredible to me just how amazing it is we know that a building is not a church people as what make up a church so I'm thankful for the grace of God that he's given us I'd like to say that through this live streaming our services I'm gonna try to stay away from teaching as much as possible and just preach what the Lord's put upon my heart I know that I'm coming into homes and coming into living rooms and there's great distractions and homes and you know and it's easier to be distracted and try to keep the children so I just want to keep things direct I want to keep things simple I don't want to get into anything deep I just want to just give you what the Lord's put upon my heart I'm also gonna be careful about my time and just be real studious about that and not go over alone a long long time because we are in a virtual set up here and and our attention Kelly can only last so long so just more than anything just come hungry come with an expectation and I believe the Lord Jesus will say something to you amen so let's just go before him here this morning before we do let's turn to our scripture and then we'll pray first Peter chapter 2 if you have your Bible we'll have you turn this morning I'd also like to say that because of the severe weather we don't know what will happen I may lose power mate we may lose this stream I've already given a tape of the Prophet for the brothers to play if that was to happen and they just play a portion of that that would be appropriate so that's already we're just just saying that that just in case this goes down on my end don't turn it off that tape will be playing so first Peter chapter two I'd like to speak to you what the Lord just stirred upon my heart and would it begin to stir fresh to me again a message that I'm gonna title in the footsteps of Christ in the footsteps of Christ first Peter chapter 2 more just read some verses and we'll skip some of this wherefore laying aside all malice and all guile and all hypocrisy xand envies and all evil speakings as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that you may grow thereby if so be you have tasted that the Lord is gracious to whom coming as unto a living stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of God and precious you also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ wherefore also it is contained in the scripture behold I lay in Zion a chief Cornerstone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded glad for that unto you therefore which believe he is precious he says unto you therefore which believe he is precious but unto them which be disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed the same has made the head of the corner and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient wherein - also they were appointed but you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people that you should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light I'm so glad he's called me of chosen generation and called me out of Darkness let's move on down to verse 11 dearly dearly beloved I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul having your conversation honest among the Gentiles that whereas they speak against you as evildoers that may be that they may by your good works which they shall behold glorify God in the day of visitation verse 15 for so if the will of God that with well doing you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men as free and not using your liberty for a cloak of maliciousness but as the servants of God honor all men love the Brotherhood fear God honor the King Lord that's my desire I believe it's yours this morning verse 21 for even hereunto were you called because Christ also suffered for us leaving us an example notice this that you should follow his steps now that's my message to you today in the footsteps of Christ and I'm gonna get on this verse here let's read it one more time verse 21 for even hereunto you were you called because Christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that you should follow his steps who did no sin neither was guile found in his mouth who when he was reviled reviled not again when he suffered he threatened not but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously self bore our sins in his own body on that tree that we being dead to sins here's why should live unto righteousness by whose stripes you were healed for you were a sheep going astray but are now returning to the Shepherd and Bishop of our souls Lord Jesus were so thankful Lord are our heart just rejoices reading these words father that you in your body you bore our sins you bore our transgressions Lord upon you was that lay the chastisement of our peace Lord the chastisement of our peace was laid upon you Father and by your stripes we are healed Lord your word says that you set you left an example Lord it means you left an impression Lord and that we should follow in your steps Lord down the footprints of the sands of time Lord it's our desire to be pleasing to you this morning we already feel your unction Lord an anointing of the Holy Spirit Lord and may you do the impossible today God may your spirit come Lord and just feel welcome in this building may it feel welcome in every home may it feel welcome in the tabernacle their Lord with those that are gathered Lord we come with an expectation now may you meet it may you be the speaker Lord may you be the Shepherd as your word says the bishop and the Shepherd of our souls this morning we ask it Lord in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen you can be seated this morning those of you at church I want to read a quote just before we begin brother Branham says in the message forsaking all he says therefore you must forsake all to follow Christ you must forsake your own ideas you must cope with his word and never will you will the Holy Ghost even deny ever deny any word it ever spoke and the Bible is wrote by the Holy Spirit the Bible said the Bible is the Word of God in the beginning was the word the Word was with God the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us now the word is made spirit dwelling in us for I will be with you even in you to the end of the world the consummation now that same God that wrote the Bible is in you you're not your own you're dead to the things of the world you're dead to your own thoughts and the mind let the mind which was in Christ being you there then you're forsaking all to follow him not your own thoughts what he's not what you say but what he says he says not my will but thine be done Lord then you're beginning to line up with God's Word I'm preaching to you this morning on a thought the Lord gave me in the footsteps of Christ the Bible is filled with examples it's filled with the historical accounts of the lives and times of men and women you can read it all the way from the Old Testament going all through the stories of Israel all the way from the beginning with Adam and Eve all the way down through the act through the life and time of Jesus through the Acts of the Apostles and those that were in the first church all the way to the book of Revelation and what you'll find is is that both old and new were filled with the life lifes of men their choices that they made the word highlights their strengths and it also highlights their weaknesses it doesn't leave out the low parts but the Bible actually says there was a purpose that they all went through this we see the inspiration of the Bible is where our inspiration is comes from our inspiration to live a Christian life every single day comes from the inspiration of the word that we read in the word that we hear there a prophet in it is the consummation of all the lives of all men and all women down throughout history those that had good times and those that had bad times those that went through the flood and those that went through the fire and those that stood for Christ those fell away for Christ the Bible doesn't doesn't leave out the negative things but we see in the picture of the word we see a contrast we see types and shadows in the Old Testament that would point to a fulfillment in the New Testament the Bible says that that we see a law that in the Bible we find a law of contrast we see men who stood for for Jehovah we see men who fell away we we have every example that you could think of we have a table and a cane we have a we have a Seth and then we have a Nimrod we have a we have a Jacob and an E soul we have a Jesus and a Judas throughout the entire Bible there's always this law of contrast there's always this good and this bad and what we find is that this was an impression that was left for us this was a pathway the were footsteps that we could follow in the scripture actually says in 1st Corinthians chapter 10 verse 11 that that that we that there was a purpose for all of this there was a purpose that the Bible chose to record not only the successes of a man like David but it also in vivid detail gave us the mistakes of that same man it gave us the same failures of his son Solomon and it highlighted the the mistakes of a man like Jacob it also told us the good things in all of it we find an inspiration we find out we find a message we find a purpose and everything that God did 1st Corinthians chapter 10 verse 11 says that there was a purpose that God actually orchestrated notice what it says here it says in verse 11 of first Corinthians 10 now all these things happen unto them for our examples for examples and they are written for our admonition so the word actually says something pretty profound here that it actually says that these people went through these things in their life now I'm not adding to scripture I'm only telling you exactly what it says it says all these things happened unto them for a purpose for example so God would literally take people through what we would call lowlights through mistakes through failures down pathways maybe that they couldn't understand we take men like Joe why did Jobe have to lose a family why did he have to lose his children why did he have to have boils and and the skin disease that he had it was all for an eternal purpose the Bible says that these things happen unto them for examples and it says they are written for our admonition for you for me and it says upon whom the ends of the world are come that's me friend that's you my brother my sister that these things were literally written for an example for a pathway for us to follow that says in another place it says that they were written for our examples that we should not lust as they lusted we should not complain and murmur as they complained and murmured the Bible says this word and the Greek and admonition it says they were written for our admonition that word admonition means a loving attempt to correct another's attitude or behavior so they were written as a loving attempt think about this that these stories in these examples that we could read were written as a loving attempt to correct our attitude and our behavior why did God put them in the Bible because they would be a message to you they would be a warning to you they would they could be an encouragement to you they could be something positive to you they could be speak as chastisement to you maybe they would they could speak to you it's your load times to give you joy when you're sad to give you correction when you need correction they were written as an example even the Old Testament the Bible says it's considered a treasure we have a modern church world today who wants to is almost ashamed of the story stories you read of the Old Testament they don't want to talk about the God who destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah because it doesn't fit in the modern scientific age of a loving God they're almost ashamed of the Old Testament stories but let me say this you can't have a revelation of the New Testament without a revelation of the Old Testament because brother Branham said that Jesus Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of the New Testament I believe you can say amen to that Matthew chapter 13 verse 52 Jesus says that the old is like a treasure notice this in Matthew 13 verse 52 then he said unto them therefore every scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a householder which bringeth the which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old so what is Jesus referring to here that the kingdom of heaven the mystery of God the revelation of Jesus Christ brother Branham would say it this way and I have this quote here in his love so much brother Branham says the entire your Bible this is out of Christ as revealed in his own word in 65 he says the entire Bible is the entire revelation of Jesus Christ making himself known to every age notice what he says there the entire Bible is the entire revelation of Jesus Christ not just Jesus of Nazareth it was more than just a man who walked in Galilee I'm glad for that I'm glad for that x-ray I'm glad I'm going on diminishing that here today but you can't take that and then leave out Jehovah it's the entire revelation because why my brother my sister it was to be a guide for our life it was to be a North Star to point us in the right direction God left this imprint both an amen in the old men in the new Christ Jesus himself it was to follow after his example to walk in his very footsteps and I want to walk in his footsteps in my life you see the Old Testament you can take up there you can take the types and the shadows and and if we're not careful we can we can almost become theologians and we could we can miss the entire point of what the law was given for we can miss the entire point of the stories of the Old Testament we can miss that they were a shadow they were pointing to an object they weren't they they stand alone by themselves but there was a reason why they were written you see the Old Testament you can take the old types the old shadows of the Old Testament and then you can you can you can you notice here remember Jesus says he says that's like a householder who takes from his treasure both old and new let me say it this way my friend the New Testament is in folded in the Old Testament catch that the New Testament is in folded or hidden between the lines in the Old Testament and and likewise the Old Testament is unfolded in the New Testament let me say that again in case you lost it the New Testament is in folded in the Old Testament and the Old Testament is unfolded in the New Testament you can't understand the Book of Leviticus unless you read the book of Hebrews you the book of Hebrews gives light the book of Hebrews gives light to what the Book of Leviticus is you can't understand the Book of Daniel chapter 11 specifically chapter 7 all the way through chapter 12 you couldn't understand the Book of Daniel in the Old Testament without the book of Revelation it was the unfolding of what Daniel seemed you couldn't understand the Passover lamb you couldn't even understand Isaiah 53 without their coming of Christ who would come to fulfill that scripture without the crucifixion you never understand the scapegoat you never understand the revelation of the Passover the value of the types is the anti-type not just the type but the fulfillment of that type they they they give us the inspiration of the scripture you could we could use this and and I could get lost here just for a moment and I want to be careful just to make sure that the point is clear but not to get too bogged down in it because that's not what we're preaching on today but the typology the shadows of the Old Testament it's the picture language in which the doctrines of the New Testament are understood all of it was a type and all of it was a shadow it was all I was all a sham an object and that object was not a law it was Christ Christ was the shadow of the Old Testament you notice here that that the the the as we said it's the picture language of the examples notice what he says here now all these things happened unto the unto them four examples so everything we read about was an example it was pointing to something it was written for our admonition which is our instruction upon whom the ends of the world or the end of the ages are come that's where we've come to my brother and my sister that's where you're at today we're at the end of the age Oh at the very end of all of the ages so the the Hebrews tells us that the shadows that they were shadows of good things to come and not the very image of the thing so it wasn't just written just for their life specifically but their life would play out a pattern it would speak to us in 2020 that's why we can glean from the life of Esther that's why it means something to us more than what it meant to any other age that's why the story of Isaac and Rebecca means more to you as the bride of Jesus Christ than it did for any other age than it did for even Isaac and Rebecca themselves these things happen to them for our examples glory he says Sarah he says here it's it's a shadow of good things to come but there was a good thing to come there was something real coming and we have that today you can look at this and we could use example after example I just want to use one here let me just find my place here and make sure that I don't I don't miss it I I could I could use many examples to to display this but I wanted to use the example of Christ let me let me let me show you these this word as and this word so it's very important because it's a structure you see here four types in the Bible it would always use the comparative words as and so the word as is used for the type and the word so is used for the anti-type the first is historic the second is prophetic let me give you some examples in 1st Corinthians 15 as in Adam as what does it mean historic it's a pre figure he says as it has an Adam all die even so prophetic in Christ shall all be made alive Matthew 24 Jesus says as the days of Noah were so shall also the coming of the Son of Man be as Moses lifted up the servant and the serpent in the wilderness even so must the Son of Man be lifted up as Jonah was three days and three nights in the whales belly so shall the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth so we see the as and the so it was a type you you all of the men of God you take Abraham Abraham was a type of God Isaac was a type of Christ look at this look at this example both Isaac I'm just gonna give you one both Isaac and Christ were a child of promise Genesis chapter 15 verse 4 and behold the word of the Lord came unto him saying this shall not be thine heir but he that shall come forth out of thy own bowels shall be thine heir what does it say prophetically about Jesus in Isaiah chapter 7 therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel so Isaac was a child of promise Christ was a child of promise the birth of both of these men were pre announced in Genesis 1810 and he said I will certainly return unto the according to the time of life and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son and Sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him Luke chapter 1 verse 30 and the angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou has found favor with God and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name Jesus look at the type and the anti-type both Isaac and Jesus were named even before they were born in Genesis 17 and God said Sarah thy wife shall bear a son thou shalt call his name Isaac and Jesus in Luke chapter 1 verse 31 behold thou shalt conceive in that womb praying for the son and shall call his name Jesus so the birth of both of these notice this you'll see this here and it's it's very clear both are called and only son Genesis chapter 22 verse 2 and he said take missus God saying to Abraham take now thy son thine only son whom thou lovest and get the into the land of Moriah all for him there for a burnt offering notice what Hebrews chapter 11 verse 17 says by faith Abraham when he was tried offer up to Isaac and he that and he says and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten Son what is John 3:16 safe for God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son it was a type it was an anti-type to a type it was a prayer was a pathway it was leading to something it was it was pointing to something these things were for our examples Oh glory both were mocked and persecuted by their own kindred you think of Sarah when she was mocked and by Hagar and the Bible says cast out this bondwoman because it says when Sarah saw the Hagar the Egyptian mocking her notice exactly what Galatian says now we brethren as Isaac was are the children of promise but as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the spirit even so it is now notice this Isaac you can think of the most practical examples the Bible says that Isaac carried the wood upon which he was to be sacrificed Genesis 22 verse 6 and Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon Isaac his son and he took the fire in his hand and a knife and they went both of them together my brother my sister Abraham might not have husband but he was under the inspiration of the Almighty God to take that wood and lay it upon Isaac and make Isaac carry up the wood why because he was fulfilling an hour type of an anti-type coming that's why the Bible says in John 19 and he Jesus bearing his cross went forth into a place of the skull he carried his own course Isaac carried his own wood to his own sacrifice the Bible says Isaac went willingly Jesus went willingly it says here in Genesis 22 about Abraham and Isaac they came to a place which God had told him of and Abraham built an altar there laid the wood in the order bound his son Isaac and laid him upon the altar oh the Bible says that Jesus went willingly like a lamb to the slaughter the Bible says that both of them even Abraham and forsook his own son took the knife back to slay him and then the angel of God stops him and says now I know you love me Abraham seeing that they'll sacrifice the your only Son you say why would God ever do that why would God put Abraham through that because his life was going to be an example it was going to be written for a purpose it was going to have a fulfillment in Christ God does everything with the purpose he does nothing aimless nothing happens to you that's out of God's control nothing happens in the world that's out of God's order everything has a purpose we don't have time to go and bow and in these so much but we can just go type after type after type all of these things were written for an example every single bit of it the entire Bible it's constantly pointing us to what we should do and what we shouldn't do how we should live well how we shouldn't live now it's always an example of what to run to and what to flee from in the Word of God it's it's the very desire in all of us to live like Christ it's your desire it's my desire but where do we get that desire my brother my sister from an inspiration from the word because others have already walked down this pathway this pathway you're not owning it for the first time there's generations of people who've walked after the footsteps of Christ it's specific it's written in the hut to highlight the examples of error and truth the Bible is written to give instruction for learning just stay with me here I got something upon my heart but I just want to lay this foundation the Bible is written to give instruction for learning apprehension to that which we can apprehend Christ it's it's written in order you say brother Matt what's your greatest desire I believe my greatest desires the same desire as any believer I'm preaching to you today you could you could have your doctrine or you could have a perfect understanding you can have a perfect understanding of the mysteries have a perfect understanding even revelation of the Word of God but my brother what is the might what is what is it all to bring us to let us not lose sight of everything that was written let us not lose sight of everything that we understand no had no matter how great our doctrine is no matter how great our understanding is it's to bring us to one thing and that's to be like Jesus Christ oh I just want to preach to you today and I believe you're pulling on the Word of God from your home in a church there's nothing I desire greater than to be like Jesus than to walk in his footsteps than to have his character all my doctrine all my understanding everything that I do in my life hey it's it's secondary to this one thing that let it let all of my understanding let all of my knowledge let it lead me to be like Jesus Christ oh I just feel today to say that I want to walk in his footsteps I want to think like Christ the whole I want to act like he thought I want to react like he reacted that's really what Christian living is really about the Bible says they were first called Christians at Antioch what was it they didn't give themself the label of Christians they didn't say we're Christians but the Bible says the world labelled them Christians because Christian means to be like Christ oh my friend today I want to say to the Lord Lord I want to walk like you I want to walk in your very footsteps I want to think like Jesus I want to act like Jesus I want my reactions to be like him I want my discipline I want to be tempered like Christ was tempered I want my disposition how did he look at humanity how did he look at the at the at the sick how did he look at those that were in sin let me look through his eyes let me think like he thought let me speak like he spoke Lord that's my desire today to be like Jesus alright a note of that you said no matter how do I be like Jesus you've got to walk in his footsteps you've got to walk after his pathway you've got to read the Word of God and see the examples of men and women who left us an example of how not to live of how to live of where to go where not to go of what to do of what not to do I want to say Lord I want to be like you I want to live like you I want to follow in your footsteps Oh I want to thank like Jesus I want to have his mind I want to react like he reacted I'm talking about the man Christ Jesus what was it he was the perfect embodiment of the word living in a human vessel he was 100% human 100% God it was the god man oh and I want to say Lord let me think like you let me talk like you let me feel as you felt Oh Lord let me walk as you look uh as you walked I want to have your patience I want to have I want to have your love Lord I want to have your temper I want want to have your eyes I want to have your ears oh when I hear the sirens sound of the world and calamity how would Jesus react oh it's very simple message this morning but I believe it's striking the heart of you today that the sameness is cliche what would Jesus do but I believe the bride of Jesus Christ is the one who truly has a desire to say Lord and everything in my life in every aspect of my life let my let my life follow in the footsteps of Christ I want to be like Jesus I want his life living through me oh that's why we have the life of st. Paul recorded he was a man who followed in the footsteps of Christ that's why he said follow me as I follow Christ he was a man who learned contentment oh we see this resounding cry from the Apostle Paul that I may know him in the power of his resurrection you know there's a song that has a very profound meaning and we sing it at church all of you know it it says Jesus has a tablespread where the saints of God are fed he invites his chosen people come and dine it's speaking of a table and you'll find this all throughout scripture here that table is in the heavenly places and the Bible says that by faith you're to be seated with Christ in heavenly places in your daily life Paul says this in Ephesians chapter 2 verse 6 he says we have been raised up and made to sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus let me take this jacket off just getting just a little bit warm here today he says we've were sitting together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus so jesus said to his disciples in Luke chapter 22 verse 29 he says I appoint unto you a kingdom as my father has appointed unto me that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom men like Moses and Aaron and Nate AB and Abihu the elders of Israel all of these men ate at the Lord's table what does it mean to eat at the Lord's table we see that word table throughout all of the Bible G David speaks evidence AAM's 23 says now prepares the table before me in the presence of my enemies at Mount Sinai I the Bible says and they saw the God of Israel and this is Exodus 24 verse 9 and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of sapphire stone and as it were the body of heaven and clearness and upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand also they saw God and noticed this and did eat and drink what an awesome picture the Bible paints for us here 74 men of God seated with him eating and drinking what was it it wasn't an actual table and it wasn't a natural food it was a spiritual table with spiritual food and there was a spiritual appetite that they had oh the Bible says that Moses couldn't take it it was it was though the scripture says here that that not only only Moses could take it it was over their heads Aaron comes down from that table and what does he do he makes a golden calf they'd have an Abba who offer strange fire but the Bible says Moses ate at the table of God he aid and he drank and the presence of God the king of Israel noticed this it was a great honor to be assigned a seat at the special table even the kings of Israel had a royal table David assigned a seat at his table thermofit mephibosheth do you read that in the Bible the scripture says in 2nd Samuel chapter nine verse seven and David said unto Him fear not for I will surely show thee kindness for Jonathan thy father's sake and will restore the all the land of Saul I noticed what he says and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually your your mind could go to the queen of sheba where my mind went the Bible says that this queen of sheba marveled at the glory of solomon marveled at his royal table Eliz men came up and how they went down how they said at feasts and how they ate and how they drank the bible says it left her breathless notice in second chronicles 9 verse 4 the meat of his table and the sitting of his servants the attendants of his ministers and their apparel and his cupbearers also the queen of sheba seen something she she says him she says happy are they men and happy are thy servants which stand before thee and hear thy wisdom the Bible says that Nehemiah said in Nehemiah 5:17 there were at my table 150 of the Jews and rulers besides those that came unto us from among the even and they're about us so it was Royal tables you'll find this all the way we just quoted David thou preparest a table there was something special about eating at the table of the Lord there was something special about the food and the meat that he was going to give I'm trying to show you that in the Old Testament there was a type and there was a shadow it was of a royal table a heavenly table and the people that were assigned to seated that kingly table called a great honor to be part of that royal table David was assigned a seat at Saul's royal table you read the story of his life he was to sit at the table of Saul and it was a very dangerous spot to sit this jealous King like Saul so David gets with Jonathan to leave his seated it to see whether or not Saul really sought to kill him and Jonathan says thou shalt be missed because thy seed will be empty and David's definitely left that seat and it was an empty seat and the Bible says in the King sat upon his seat by the wall and David's place was empty so last wherefore cometh none of the son of Jesse to the table neither yesterday nor today I thought it was so amazing the spiritual significance you could draw out of this we know Saul wasn't a type of Christ at all nor was his table a type of the table we're speaking of today but in the Old Testament the table of kings and a type and a shadow was it was a picture of the Lord's table the kingly table the Royal table Paul speaks of this in first Corinthians 5 verse 8 he says let us keep the feast in other words he was saying that we've been we've been assigned a seat we've been given a seat at the table of God to eat of the Lord oh don't leave your seat empty don't don't don't don't don't be assigned a seat at the table of God and then never eat at it never find yourself there feasting upon it but Paul says let us keep the feast I say Lord let it never be said unto me thy seed is empty but let me eat it your feast that you've prepared unto me let it never be said o my brother my sister I think of this here and I just want to make sure I don't lose myself in this because I have something else I want to come to but you notice this that this heavenly table that he speaks of ever since the that Jesus was crucified at Calvary you notice all of the every every man of God who lived for God and every el you take Paul you take Peter you take anybody in the Bible they become they then there was a desire and over whelming desire in their life all the way up to their death where they were lamenting and crying to say all want to know him by the power of his resurrection Paul says to know Christ to live for Christ is game to live in this world as lost it was his greatest desire to know God to know him in the power of his resurrection it was the same way with his disciples and all the early church fathers you look at Luther look at swingley the Puritans they no matter what you who you want to read about her men you want to read about like what John Wesley a Whitfield and and and and T Austin sparks it was it was the desire of this early church to know him above all revelation above all mystery above all doctrine above all dress code above all knowledge there was an overwhelming desire that could that that was in the foreground of all of that and it was this that I may know him in the power of his resurrection that I may be like him that I may have the Fellowship of his sufferings it was the desire it was it was a powerful force that drove them it was a ruling passion it was an it was an ever increasing desire to know God by revelation to know him in the power of his word on not earthly things not earthly successes not earthly fame not earthly ambition oh they prayed for a lot of things but but they didn't pray just for blessings but they that there was a prayer for more revelation of the glory and the greatness of God that's why brother man said there's nothing greater you can ask for than for more revelation what was he saying more knowledge that wasn't what he was saying revelation of what of Christ to know him in a greater way than I've known him before it should be your desire it should be my desire every single day to say Lord I want to increase in my relationship with you I want to know you greater Lord in a greater way than what I knew you yesterday in a greater way of what at what I knew you when I was first Saved I should be ever-increasing the bight the disciples said increase our faith I'm saying Lord and crucem I increased my faith increase my love increase my knowledge Lord oh let me let me say today I want to know him in the power of his resurrection I want to know what it means to be like Jesus I want to have his desires I want to walk in his footsteps I want to know him as a brother branham was toto you don't know your Bible he says I may not know my Bible really well but I know the author really well and I say Lord more than any of my knowledge more than any of my understanding do I know you do I know the author do I know that the inspiration behind all the stories that I read about in the Bible behind all the doctrine behind all the truth and had no matter how great it is and it's a great truth that we hold but behind it all is a person who's longing for a relationship is a person who longs more than you long to know him he wants to know you he wants to fill himself he wants to fill you with his love to fill you with his power to fill you with his inspiration to fail you with his vision to fill you with his thoughts to fill you with his word fresh every day my brother my sister you need a fresh inspiration from God every day of your life and God wants to give it to you more than you want it today oh it was an overwhelming and call encompassing filling from the Apostle Paul that I may know him in the power of his resurrection in the power of his immeasurable 'ti he's a limitless God he's an immense God he's boundless he's overwhelming he's greater than you could ever know that's why brother Branham said even in in the even even in in in eternity he'll still be unfolding himself he'll still be revealing himself I'm so glad for that and I want to know him in every way that I could know him today Paul says in him we live and move and have our being in him we live in who for the believer in his life is life all their life all their existence is wrapped up in one interest and that's Christ one desire and that's to live like Jesus oh that's to have his Holy Spirit drawing us that's the Hiva spirit calling us that's his Holy Spirit wanting his Holy Spirit to enable us all I believe it's the cry of a true believer today to say Lord let your spirit have full sway in my life and let my mind and not not be so contaminated with the things of the world let it be filled with the love of Jesus let it be filled with the revelation and the knowledge of God oh let it not be something of yesterday let it be something fresh for today a true and living revelation more than anything that's what I want in my life oh the Apostle Paul was a man who walked after the Lord he was a man who knew what it was to be content Philippians chapter 4 verse 11 it says now not that I speak in respect of want for I have learned in whatsoever state I am therewith to be content I know both how to be abased I know how to abound everywhere and all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry both to abound and to suffer need he was he was showing us the law of contrasts of life and he says and I can do all things verse 13 through Christ which strengthens me Paul that you look at a state that he had in his life it's anything but we will it's it's anything but desirable a man who lived constantly under pressure the temporary key temporal condition of Paul was anything but desirable yet he was he was it was far from dissatisfied what you find out of the letters of PO is a man who was satisfied with life he was satisfied with Christ though afflicted those scores though beaten though thrown in jail yet he himself could learn to be content my brother my sister covetousness and contentment are diametrically opposed to each other covetousness and contentment are two opposites there's something in the world today it's a constant desire it's its greed is what it is it's for what everyone wants more than what they had yesterday it's never enough how much is enough it's never enough let me say this to you today my brother and my sister if you are not content if we are not content with those things which we have we will never be content even if we've succeed in obtaining everything we desire if you're not content with what God has given you your station and life with what you have with what he's allowed you to have you got to realize my brother my sister your earthly lot is designed by God it's given by God it's your vocation that you didn't choose now I'm speaking of Christians here your earthly lot is appointed by God the Bible says that he fixes the bounds of our habitations he fixes the bounds of our habitation what does that mean that means he's not just a creator he's also the governor huh that's a very big difference between the creator and the governor God is not just the Creator he's also the governor of all things everything is controlled in the world by him every circumstance which transpires is under his watch he's uh knits under his control it's under his order he said brother how do I see that for my life everything in your life is governed by God everything that happens to you in your life job said there's nothing what we learn from the story of job is the Satan couldn't do anything because God had put a hedge around him unless God gave him permission to do it so he's not just the creator of your lot in life he's also the governor he's also the protector he's also the orchestrator he's the keys the he's the conductor of everything that's happening and you've got to hear his voice in order to see his hand in your life you've got to hear his voice in your life you've got to hear that still small voice to say whatever comes your way child I I counted the sparrows I know every Sparrow that falls I've numbered the hair of your head in other words I'm intricately acquainted with everything that happens in your life some people don't think God is concerned with every little thing that happens God is concerned with every little detail in your life day to day life say brother Matt how can that be because he's big enough he's great enough to be involved not only in every big thing but also every little thing because even in the mind of God there's no there's really no distinction in your life between great we haven't we measure of great and small vast and minut but to God the Bible says that then that he numbers the stars of the heaven you say that's great that's numerous the stars of the heaven but it also says he also numbers the hair on your head so he's not just in the great he's also in the small it's showing that God it's showing that to God everything is the same size or let me say it this way everything is just as important the big things and the little things are important to God in your life the same God who commissions angels and Seraphim z-- to stand before his throne saying to them come and he comes into another and he goes the same one who controls the vastness of the universe this great mighty by large incomprehensible God regards with tender compassion even the poor little sparrow which falls unnoticed to the ground how much more does he care for you and care for me today you see friend there's nothing there's no such thing as chance there is in the world and luck there's no such thing as chance in the kingdom of God God the Bible says it's God who makes rich it's God who makes poor it's God who brings low it's God who lifts up whatever happens to us is by his appointment you say brother Matt why is that important because that's how you can learn to be content with whatever you have and wherever you find yourself when you know it's your heavenly Father who has called the shots in your life you can be content no matter what you have or what you don't have oh that's why God gave us the story of Job you notice job falls from the greatest to the lowest just overnight the Bible says he he an adversity he spun yet he somehow he saw the hand of God in everything that happened in his life he'll he falls to his knees and prays to God and says I naked I came into the world from my mother's womb and naked I'll return the Lord gave me everything I had and the Lord has taken to the way praise the name of the Lord huh the Bible says and all these things job's sinned not you know to murmur against God and I was going this way intentionally because the Holy Spirit directed me this way to murmur at God to be dissatisfied with the lot which has been appointed to us to always be complaining over one circumstance or another is to charge God with wrongdoing it's to attribute failure to Him who is the only one with wisdom and knowledge and understanding he is the only one who is in finite infinite is the infinite God let me just say this to you and I'll just make it real simple whatever the Lord has given us let us learn to be content why are you preaching on contentment because Paul said and all things I've learned to be content and what was Paul he was a footstep that we could follow him said I want to be like Jesus then be like Paul even brother branham said all the messengers to all seven ages he says that that last messenger would be just like Paul be just like him in every way because Paul followed Christ and he says as I follow follow me as I follow Christ imitate me as I'm imitating Christ whatever he gives us thankfully receive it and be content whatever he denies us let us be satisfied without whatever it was he denied whatever he takes from us let us part with it whatever trial he lays on us let us patiently bear it oh can you say man to the Word of God today we shall thus be still and know he is God and we shall honor and magnify and bless his name what does the Bible say says will eat the but we may have to eat the bread of trouble we may have to drink the waters of affliction we may not understand our affliction but we don't have to when we have a real revelation that God never makes a mistake that he's too perfect to ever mess up that he's too kind and too loving and compassionate to ever hurt his children nothing he ever does is to hurt us my brother when you get this revelation you can say like the Apostle Paul I am a possessor of all things glory no matter what pressure you have no matter what trials or afflictions no matter what you have in your life you can say I possess all things because I possess Christ because I'm a son or daughter of God and I am an heir of eternal life 1st Peter 1:3 what we read blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ which according to his abundant mercy has begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead what does that lively hope give us it gives us contentment instead of covetousness it gives us steadfastness instead of instability it gives us humility in the place of pride it gives us it but we we please God rather than pleasing men it gives us unity rather than division we look to the things of heaven rather than the things of earth and where there's timidity where you're timid God gives you courage oh where there's the works of the flesh he replaces the works of the flesh with the fruits of the Spirit and instead of murmuring he gives us submission and contentment instead of lukewarmness we have zeal instead of pride we have humility you know the Bible says pride goeth before the fall and a haughty spirit before destruction that's why first Peter 5:5 says be clothed in humility I say Lord let me be clothed in humility and not arrogance and pride that's what the Apostle Paul describes the the Apostles disposition how they lived were preaching on in the footsteps of Christ it says not to think of ourselves more highly than we ought to think but to think soberly according as God has dealt to every man the measure of faith I read a writer and it was amazing what he said he said upon this subject too much stress cannot be laid for without humility true religion cannot possibly exist a proud Christian is a contradiction in terms we might as well speak of a wise fool of a wicked saint of a sober drunkard of a chaste harlot as of a proud Christian we may as soon expect delicate flowers to flourish in the frozen and barren regions of Serbia as that true priety should grow in the heart that is proud and haughty a vine might as well thrive when a worm is knowing at its root as that the soul should prosper and be in health when its arrogance and pride are not subdued oh I say lord give me humility that I may flourish replace my pride and arrogance with humility and submission to God you can see the footsteps of a man like David we follow his footsteps who speaks of himself as a worm job cried out and says behold I am vile the Apostle Paul said if anyone could be proud it would be me but what were the Apostle Paul's views about himself and when you when you when Paul references himself he says I above all should be I should be gloating in arrogance and pride Oh Paul says I'm not even worthy to be called an apostle in another place he says I'm less than the least of all of God's people even when he's writing the but the lie one of the last epistles he designates himself as the chief of sinners Paul had an estimation of himself remember Paul was one who walked in the footsteps of Christ he was brought to know himself a knowledge the Bible says he says Paul says I am the chief of sinners he was brought to know himself a knowledge we are told in which all wisdom sinners if we know ourselves as Paul did pride and self delight would find no room within us I say Lord let it not find any room within me but about all of that you said brother Matt Paul Paul's a good example but above all of that let's look to the chief Shepherd let's consider the one who said take my yoke upon you and learn from me for I am gentle and humble in heart all the Bible says all the heavens couldn't declare him all the heavens couldn't contain him all the fullness of the Godhead was bodied in this man Christ Jesus everything that was in God he poured into Christ o devils trembled at the words of Jesus Christ are they flew from his presents Oh though yet but yet how great this man was but yet how gentle and how humble how lonely all want to say Lord let me conform to that image of Christ let my life be an example in his humility Oh in the words of the Apostle Paul he would say do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit but in humility consider others better than your self the Word says not to look after your own interest that's what the Bible says but to look after the interest of others your attitude should be the same my attitude should be the same as Jesus's attitude and I say Lord let me walk in those footsteps notice these Christians as we close here these believers are there in the book of Acts that we read about we know this was the ephesian church the Bible describes such a group that was so fervent they were so zealous for the Lord they they were so what we could say we're so close to the Lord Jesus they they they walked so closely ah the letter their to the Lord I you can read the the Paul's letters to the Ephesians and notice what Paul is Paul begins to compliment them in Ephesians 1 verse 1 and 80 addresses them and says you're the faithful in Christ Jesus you're blessed this is the Ephesians you're blessed with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ you're chosen before the foundation of the world predestinated unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will Paul describes this group is faithful this is the Ephesians now he describes them as faithful blessed chosen in another place he says that there are forgiving people he says that having the mystery of Christ being sealed with the Spirit of promises verse 13 and he further prays that they would have the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know him the exceeding greatness of his power to us word who believe the Bible makes it clear these believers who had been quickened they had been made alive in Christ he says in chapter 2 of Ephesians verse 5 you've been quickened with Christ who has raised this up together made us to sit in heavenly places in Christ Jesus krempe Paul calls him the workmanship of Christ created in Christ Jesus unto good works verse 13 and are made nigh by the blood of Jesus Christ he says that by God's grace and verse 21 they're growing into a holy temple in the Lord through the spirit what a description of a blessed chosen cold people a holy people holy nation a peculiar priesthood even in the Book of Revelations we know this is speaking of the age jesus also says I know thy works and thy labour verse 2 and thy patience in other words he's saying all the good deeds all the good things in your life your patients that you labor for me without complain and you'll do anything for others you give up anything for anybody you're diligent and your good works and I'm commending you for it say brother Matt what are you trying to point out I'm trying to point out to you that as they were the Alpha so are we the Omega as they were that first seed church so that church comes again in the last age that's who you are my brother my sister we are the Omega of the first age we are the continuation of the book of Acts church we are that Pentecostal church and our life should be wretch our life should be reflective of their lives and good deeds and blessings and in their patience and their virtue in their knowledge and their temperance in their wisdom and their joy in their forgiveness this wasn't a group of novices this was a group of people Jesus begins to examine this well-grounded they were grounded in the gospel of Paul they approved it in their life by sacrificing laboring and standing from the for the truth I see all your works Jesus said your hatred for sin your love for the truth your courage that you have yet in all of that somehow in all your labor you've allowed your first love to wither and he says nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou has left thy first love you said brother Matt what are you trying to say today I'm trying to get you to see a picture here trying to say to get you a picture here that the most important thing more than more than all of your doctrine more than all of your good works should be a life that's following the footsteps of Jesus Christ constantly following we shall know if we continue on to know it's not enough for you to be caring giving diligent serving those grieving over sin preaching the truth it's not enough for you to uphold good moral standards it's not enough just to endure hardness or I'll consider this way it's not enough to even be burned at the stake to give your very life it's all part that's all part of you living as a Christian you can do all these things in 9 and my name but if in the process of doing them your affection for me for who Jesus decreases and doesn't increase if I'm not being more diligent in my heart and my River if I'm not being more and more in the delight of my heart than let me just be honest my brother my sister I've left my first love if my knowledge if my desire to be more like Jesus if your affection if my affection is no longer a great concern than Jesus says I have something against you you've left your first love you've left your first love Oh consider what David says he says in Psalm 73 verse 25 whom have I in heaven but thee and there is none upon the earth that I desire beside thee notice these words of David David's not saying I don't have human love he knows God blesses good human love but David is saying there's no one I love exclusively in my heart as I love the Lord I desire him above all others he says in Psalm 6 verse 3 you know this very well o God my soul thirsteth for thee my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land where there know wot where no water is Psalms 42 is the heart as the deer panteth after the water Brooks own panic my soul after the old God my soul thirsteth for God for the Living God David saying I thirst for the Living God the way a deer thirst for after it's been chased a deer will go past the point of exhaustion to find water that it seeks because it's seeking something it's seeking something daily to live like Jesus to walk like Jesus to be in harmony with the spirit to be in harmony with his love to live constantly for him to think like him to walk in his very footsteps and all my brother and my sister today as I closed this message out to you today I say Lord let me walk in the footsteps of Christ Oh what his first Peter say he says in verse 21 for here and who you were called because Christ also suffered leaving us an example that you should follow his steps who did no sin neither was guile found in his mouth who when he was reviled reviled not again when he suffered he threatened not but committed himself to Hume that judged righteously I say Lord let my life be a portrait of Jesus beyond all my knowing beyond all my all my standards all my good standards all my dress code beyond all of my knowledge but I want to challenge I want to challenge you here today my brother my sister I want you to ask as the Holy Spirit is it's just real close right now I want you to scare to say Lord do I live like Jesus do I talk like Jesus do I do act like you do I live like you is my temper like you or am I find myself with pride when there should be humility do I find myself with a temper when there should be meekness and lowliness and humility do I find my compassion for others to find myself compassionate for those that are less fortunate or do I find myself looking with arrogance and with pride what would Jesus do how would Jesus act we see the life of Paul we could follow the life of his footsteps we could follow his footsteps we could follow the life of brother branham oh the life of a prophet who we had in our generation the messenger to this age Oh were we could we can see that he was we can see that he had mistakes he he he got in a truck one data to go kill a boy took a gun loaded gun to go Bo's brains out what was it God was showing not just the highlights but the lowlights he could get on a telephone call and under pressure he could tell a lie and tell him I'm not here tell him I'm gone away but yet the same Holy Spirit could come and begin to convict that man and could begin to speak to that man that same Spirit of God who spoke through that man that the same Spirit of God who came in correction the same Holy Spirit who come to draw that man to a closer walk to correction and to obedience and humility is the same spirit that can take you in all of your mistakes and all your faults and all your fellow failures and I'm here today to say Lord I'm so glad you can still speak to me in spite of all my imperfection in spite of all the times I've walked away and died in spite of all the times where I've not followed after the footsteps of Christ yet that tender Holy Spirit can come and chastise me can come and rebuke me and I could say Lord I'm gonna be zealous I'm gonna repent Lord of it let me let me know you as Paul said let me know you in the power of your resurrection Oh Paul makes it clear that Christ was revealed to him not Galatians 1:16 notice what he says here he says here he says that I may know him in the power of his resurrection what was Paul saying I want to know Christ above all things let me know Jesus above everything let me know him and truly a means there's one purpose I have for living let me ask you that today my friend my brother my sister what's driving you every single day what's pushing you what's motivating you what's motivating your life do you want Christ more than anything Christ more in your life Christ more in your attitude more in your temperance more in your patience more in your jaw you'll want to say today maybe as the musicians can return here today's we just close this service out to say Lord more than anything let my
