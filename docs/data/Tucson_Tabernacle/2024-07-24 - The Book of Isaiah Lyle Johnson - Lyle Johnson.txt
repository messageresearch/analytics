[Music] salvation on C is that true for you tonight it's true for me tonight God bless you thank you I'm excited to be here tonight amen I trust you are too this evening our topic is is the book of Isaiah as we continue our series on the books of the Bible you may already know this but Isaiah is one of the most controversial books of the entire Bible and and I need to warn you I'm probably going to be five or 10 minutes longer than I normally am there's a lot of material to compress down and uh so I could speak a lot faster we can get done on time but I don't think you follow everything's so very well so I'm going to go at my normal pace and we'll just take a little bit longer if that's okay we're fortunate tonight not only to have this book but the author of the book is here with us so let's ask for his guidance as we once again go to him in prayer Lord Jesus we are completely insufficient and inadequate in ourselves Lord we're not worthy to open the pages of this Bible but it's a love letter that you've sent to us Lord that we could know your will and Lord that we could follow after you Lord in spirit and in truth Lord we just pray Lord that your spirit would continue to be present tonight Lord I pray that Lord there's nothing I have to say that anyone needs to hear but Lord we're here to hear from you speak to our hearts each one Lord questions that there may be whatever it might be Lord have your will have your way amongst us tonight and Lord for these requests that have been spoken Lord Lord I just don't know what to say except Lord our sufficiency lies in you and we trust you for the outcome according to your perfect will in each one of these requests and we thank you and that precious mighty name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen see if we could get the there we are thank you Isaiah is the first of what we call the Major Prophets they're called major because of the volume or quantity of their writings Isaiah is such an all-encompassing book it's hard provide a synopsis in a sentence or two it's not possible to cover it in one night or or two or 10 so please read it at home alone or together with your family tonight we're just going to skem over some little brief portions just some tiny selections um some of the scriptures you're going to hear tonight you already heard on on the WhatsApp my opening scripture Our Pastor read this morning even though he didn't know it was going to be our opening scripture and a chunk of what I'm going to say not long after that he just read to you from here just a moment ago without knowing that that was what I was going to do so so I I'll accept that intrusion brother so I'd like to open with a very familiar passage from Isaiah a prophecy concerning the Messiah some of you may recognize recognize this as part one movement 12 of handles Messiah For unto us a child is born unto us a son is given the government shall be upon his shoulder his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace of the increase of his government in peace there shall be no end upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom to order it and to establish it with Justice and judgment from henceforth even forever and how do we know it's going to happen the Zeal of the Lord of hosts will accomplish this then a few verses from chapter 40 starting at verse 28 a response to Israel's complaint that Lord you're ignoring our plight you don't really see what's going on hast thou not known hast thou not heard the Everlasting God the Lord the creator of the heavens the creator of the ends of the Earth fainteth not neither is weary he doesn't get tired there's no searching of his understanding we we can't fathom it he he gives power to the faint to them that have no might he increases strength another translation reads he invigorates the exhausted he gives strength to the powerless but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint if you're taking notes this ties in with Hebrews 12: 1-3 please be seated when you came in there was a small card or text for you with a short length of twine attached if you didn't get one when you came in please take one when you leave if raise your hand maybe someone will bring one to you I I don't know it has Isaiah 4031 printed on it and again a length of twine attached to it um and we already talked about the quiz so I'll skip that it's been a while since we met and discussed the structure of the Old Testament so let's just review for a moment this is how the Hebrew Bible called the Tanakh is structured Tanakh from the from Tor the N from neim the from Kim tanak Torah neim intervene the Torah means direction or instruction it begins with the story of creation and ends with the Deliverance of the Jewish Nation From Slavery the giving of the law and the end of the wandering in the desert these five books are also known as the pentet written by Moses the second division neim means prophets the events or Ministries contained in these books occurred at least in part and the land of promise Joshua and judges Samuel and kings are included in this section prophets there were prophets in the times of the judges Samuel was an important Prophet who transitioned Israel from a collection of towns to a nation with the centralized government and ultimately anointed David as their King many prophets are mentioned in Kings including Nathan Elijah Elisha these prophets left us no specific writings or Scrolls what we know of them and their words and Ministries are recorded here they're sometimes called the earlier prophets those which left nothing in writing the prophets which left writings are sometimes called the later prophets there are 15 of them contained in four books and the first of these is Isaiah our subject this evening the third division Kim is Hebrew word that means writings here here we find poetry wisdom history other books not part of the Torah or considered part of the prophets notably Lamentations written by a major Prophet Jeremiah is not included in the writings of the prophets and Daniel certainly a prophet is here and not included in the second section because his ministry was conducted entirely outside the land of Israel and after the destruction of Jerusalem here's the Old Testament as organized in our Christian Bible the same content as the tanak but ordered differently there are four major divisions in 39 books not 24 because Samuel Kings Chronicles Ezra Nehemiah are split into two books and the Minor Prophets one book on the Tanakh are broken out into 12 individual books not shown is the New Testament with 27 books for a total of 66 books in our Christian Bible we've covered the law history and poetry sections earlier in this series tonight we start the last section prophets the last 17 books of our Old Testament about onethird of its length are the writings of these Prophets You may be asking yourself what is a prophet what did they do how did God use them in the Old Testament and who is Isaiah when did he live why is he called a prophet prophets were usually men there were women as well such as Deborah one of the judges we looked at a few months ago in holda whom we met in Second Kings and 2 Chronicles though again neither of them left us writings as mentioned a moment ago the sections we call law and history include prophets like Abraham Moses Samuel Elijah and holda the focus of the last section of our Old Testament the section that we call the prophets was on the nations of Israel and Judah after the kingdom was established God raised up prophets to rebuke to correct to redirect his people when they went astray so as no surprise the prophets moved to the Forefront of scripture when the nation of Israel splits into two kingdoms and remain so until the return to Jerusalem after the Exile then they go silent for about 500 years until John the Baptist arrives on the scene in our new testament God primarily communicated To His prophets through dreams Visions visits of angels miracles he gave them messages for their own time messages for predicted future times he gave them words of Timeless principles of right and wrong Isaiah the first of the Major Prophets is perhaps the greatest of them all following the division of the Kingdom he introduces himself at the beginning of his book let's turn to the opening verse Isaiah 1:1 the vision of Isaiah the son of Amos which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah yam ahaz and Hezekiah Kings of Judah from this we learn that Isaiah's dad was named Amos Isaiah's visions and prophecy concerned the people of the kingdom of Judah and its capital Jerusalem his Vision or Ministry commenced near the end of uzziah's Reign and ended sometime during the reign of Hezekiah it's thought it's commonly thought his ministry began around 740 BC within a year of the death of King Uzziah and ended around 700 BC though there is certainly disagreement about the end so this begins nearly 200 years after the kingdom split in 931 BC during his ministry the northern Kingdom of Israel was conquered by Assyria in 723 BC and the people exiled and replaced with people from other territories conquered by Assyria about a 100 years after Isaiah Judah was conquered by Babylonia and about 18 years later Jerusalem was destroyed and don't take from this verse that he was in some sort of a continuous Vision trance state for all of those years the division doesn't mean one experience of a division but it's what he saw what the Lord showed him over that time Isaiah didn't seek to be popular or ingratiate himself to people so they would listen to what he was sharing he was blunt he was direct he was often very offensive the rest of chapter one is a call re form in Judah and Jerusalem let's take a look at some of the rest of this short chapter see how the Lord describes the sin of and then presents a path to Mercy and righteousness for the people of Judah one two hear o heavens and give ear o Earth listen up pay attention everyone for the Lord has spoken I have nourished and brought up children the nations of Israel in Judah and they have rebelled against me the ox knoweth his owner and the ass his master's crib but Israel doth not know my people doth not consider what's he saying you're dumber than an ox you don't even have the brains of a donkey not a way to make friends and influence enemies right not what we would call politically correct or sensitive speech a sinful Nation a people Laden with iniquity loaded not just a little a seed of evildoers your fathers were evil children that are corruptors and so are you they speaking of the people have forsaken the Lord they've provoked the Holy One of Israel to anger they have gone away backward why should you be stricken anymore I'll tell you why you will Revolt more and more this is how I see you the whole head is sick the whole heart Fain from the soul of the foot even to the head there's no soundness in it but wounds and bruises putrifying sores they have not been clothed neither bound up neither mollified with ointment who who what do you mean look your country is desolate your cities are burned with fire your land strangers devour it in your presence it's desolate overthrown by strangers and the daughter of Zion Jerusalem and its inhabitants is left as a cottage in a Vineyard as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers as a besieged city except the Lord of hosts had left unto us a very small Remnant we should have been as Sodom and we should have been like unto Gomorrah if the audience was passive until now they'd be seething with either anger or shock at being compared to Sodom and Gomorrah hear the word of the Lord ye rulers of Sodom give ear unto the law of God you people of gomor you can imagine their reaction well what are you talking about Isaiah our King Uzziah he's a descendant of David we honor him we worship at the temple built by Solomon which was filled with the glory of the Lord we preserve the word we're righteous we do the Commandments of Moses who are you to speak to us in such a manner to speak against God's anointed and the children of Israel that have kept the faith the Lord replies to these thoughts and reactions to what purpose is the multitude of your sacri sacrifices unto me sayith the Lord I'm full of the burnt offerings of rams the fat of fed beasts I Delight not in the blood of Bullocks or Lambs or he goats when you come to appear before me who has required this at your hand to tread my courts bring no more vain oblations incense is an Abomination unto me the new moons and sabbaths the coloring of assembl I Cann out away with its iniquity even the solemn meeting you're new moons and your appointed Feast my soul hateth there are trouble unto me I am weary to Bear them I'm sick and tired of your religious ritual it cannot conceal your empty hearts and careless lives and when you spread forth your hands I will hide mine eyes from you yet when you make many prayers I will not hear why your hands are full of blood but wait it doesn't need to be like this you need a change of heart repentance it's not about you and what you do it's about what I can do for you listen to me wash you make you clean put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes I see everything everything you can't hide from me cease to do evil don't just change your thoughts or your words change your ways just like Jesus said go and sin no more learn to do well seek judgment relieve the oppressed judge the fatherless plead for the Widow come let us reason together saith the Lord though your sins be as Scarlet they shall be white as snow though they be red like Crimson they shall be as wool if he be willing and obedient you shall eat of the good of the land but if you refuse and rebel you shall be devoured with the sword for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it the parallel we see for ourselves of course is that we are Sinners by Nature I'm talking about this guy but if we accept the Lord and seek his will not just with our words but demonstrated by our actions he's ready to forgive and though our sins be as Scarlet they shall be white as snow though they be red like Crimson they shall be as wool when I read this chapter it almost seems like an overview of brother brandom's Ministry crying out against religious form without the substance without the life or a Paul decrying those that have a form of godliness but deny the power of God or the ministry of Jesus himself in chapter six we see a flashback to the start of Isaiah's calling as a prophet remember the Bible is not focused necessarily on chronological sequences there are lots of flashbacks and Flash forwards in the year that King Uzziah died 740 BC I saw also the Lord sitting upon the throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple what do you suppose Isaiah's reaction was when he saw that he's terrified Moses said Lord let me see you Exodus 33:20 the Lord said you can't see my face no man shall see me and live and Isaiah sees the Lord he is terrified above it above the Lord's Throne stood the sarapin each had six wings with two he covered his faith to his feet and two he did fly and one sarif whispered no one Cried unto another and said holy holy holy is the Lord of hosts the whole Earth is full of his glory and the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke then said I Isaiah speaking wo is me I'm undone I'm a man of unclean lips I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips mine eyes have SE seen the king the Lord of hosts then flew one of the seraphim unto me having a live coal in his hand which he be taken with the tongs from The Altar and he laid it upon my mouth and said Lo this has touched thy lips and thine iniquity is taken away and thy sin purged also I heard the voice of the Lord saying whom shall I send who will go for us then said I here I am send me and he said go and tell this people hear ye indeed but understand not see ye indeed but perceive not make the heart of this people fat make their ears heavy shut their eyes Li lest they see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and convert and be healed here we see Isaiah going through exactly the same process we do conviction woe is me I am undone I'm a sinner confession mine eyes have seen the king the Lord of host I'm a man of unclean lips I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips followed by cleansing Mercy salvation thine iniquity is taken away thy sin purged the Lord asked for a messenger in Isaiah now Sanctified cleansed set aside for service recognizing the grace and mercy of God towards him responds he volunteers to serve a perfect parallel to our experiences as Christians and these last verses reveal the concept of election sadly some are destined to hear without understanding to see without really seeing moving on Isaiah did some really strange things if you lived in Judah during his ministry you would have probably been shocked not only in his direct language but but consider this for example in Isaiah 20 in the year that tarton came unto ashdod when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him and fought against ashdod and took it that was in 713 BC 27 years into his ministry 10 years after the destruction of the northern kingdom by Assyria at the the same time the Lord spake the Lord by Isaiah the son of Amos saying go and loose a sackcloth from off thy loins and put off thy shoe from thy foot and he did so walking naked and Barefoot well how long did this go on and the Lord said like as my servant Isaiah hath walked naked and Barefoot three years for a sign and wonder upon Egypt and upon Ethiopia so shall the king of Assyria lead away the Egyptians prisoners and the Ethiopians captives young and old naked and Barefoot even with their buttocks uncovered to the shame of Egypt note that Judah at times sought to Ally themselves with Egypt for protection against a common enemy like Assyria they're warned about this again in Chapter 30 the Lord is showing them that Egypt won't be able to help them but can you imagine the gossip that went around for those three years put yourself in their place would you have understood would I would I AE with Isaiah or would I think there goes that crazy guy again he just never likes us and now he's running around Buck Naked his behavior it's disgusting well moving on in chapter 36 we read of the invasion and near conquest of Judah by sakb King of Assyria you can read about this as well in 2 Kings 18 and 19 now it came to pass in the 14th year of King hezakiah so this is about 701 BC Isaiah's been ministering for about 39 years now that sakb king of Assyria came up against all the defensed cities of Judah and took them he conquered most of Judah just 20 years after Israel was conquered and carried off into captivity by his predecessors Shaner IV and Sargon II and the king of Assyria sent rabsha from Leakes Lakes is the second largest city in Judah at that time which he had just conquered sent rabsha from Lakers to Jerusalem under King Hezekiah with a great Army he stood by the conduit of the upper pool and the highway of the Fuller's field and he he starts psychological warfare he stands up and shouts in Hebrew so everybody can hear boasting the sex of the Assyrian army telling Jerusalem to surrender surrender become slaves but live or resist and will kill you nobody has withstood us yet and you can't either none of your other cities of Judah have withstood you your God hasn't protected them and he won't protect you Isaiah 37 it came to pass when King Hezekiah heard it that he rent his clothes covered himself with sackcloth burlap and went into the house of the Lord and he sent El aim who was over the household and shebna the Scribe and the Elders of the priests covered with sackcloth unto Isaiah the prophet the son of Amos notice Isaiah Hezekiah doesn't sit down with his war council he doesn't run to the Armory for more arrows he comes in humility he takes off his Royal robes comes in humility to the temple and sends word not to the high priest but to the prophet Isaiah we skipped over most of the book but Isaiah had made a number of short-term prophecies before this year is over thus and so will happen which came to pass precisely as he had declared them Hezekiah knew this and the king's Messengers said to Isaiah thus sayith Hezekiah this day is a day of trouble and of rebuke and of blasphemy for the children are come to the birth and there's not enough strength to bring forth it may be that the Lord thy God will hear the words of rabsha whom the king of Assyria his master has sent to reproach the Living God and will reprove The Words which the Lord thy God hath heard wherefore lift up thy praise PR for the remnant that's left and so the Servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah and Isaiah said unto them thus shall ye say to your master King Hezekiah thus saith the Lord be not afraid of the words that thou Hast heard wherewith the Servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me behold I will send a blast upon Him He Shall hear a rumor and return to his own land and I will cause him to Fall by The Sword in his own land well the Assyrians continue to threaten skipping to verse 14 Hezekiah received a letter from the hand of The Messengers of the king of Assyria and read it and Hezekiah went up under the house of the Lord and spread it before the Lord Lord read this and Hezekiah prayed unto the Lord saying oh lord of hosts God of Israel that dwelleth between the Cherub beam Thou Art God even thou alone of all the kingdoms of the earth thou Hast made Heaven and Earth incline thine ear O Lord and hear open thine eyes oh Lord and see hear all the words of sakra which he has sent to reproach the Living God of a truth Lord the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations and their countries and have cast their gods Into the Fire for they were no Gods but the work of men's hands wood and stone therefore have they destroyed them now therefore oh Lord Our God save us from his hand that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the Lord even thou only then Isaiah the son of Amos sent unto Hezekiah saying thus saith the Lord God of Israel whereas thou Hast prayed to me against sakb king of Assyria you didn't go to your captains you didn't go to your generals you didn't go to your Armory you came to me this is the word which the Lord has spoken concerning him the Virgin the daughter of Zion hath despised thee and laugh thee to Scorn the daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at thee whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice and lifted up thine eyes on high even against the Holy One of Israel skipping to verse 33 therefore thus saith the Lord concerning the king of Assyria he shall not come into this city nor shoot an arrow here nor come before it with shields nor cast a bank against it by the way that he came by the same shall he return and shall not come into this city saith the Lord Lord for I will defend this city to save it for my own sake and for my servant Isaiah oh no no for my servant Hezekiah oh no no for my servant David's sake then the angel of the Lord went forth and smokee in the camp of the Assyrians 104 score and 5,000 and when they arose the rest of them early in in the morning behold they were all dead corpses so sakb king of Assyria departed and went and returned and dwelt at Nineveh notice his Palace is at Nineveh and it came to pass as sakra was worshiping in the house of nisr his God that adrc and sherzer his sons smote him with a sword they killed him they escaped into the land of Armenia and Es had and his son reigned in his stead what why why are you pointing that out brother l in the various objects celebrating sakib's conquests he admits he never conquered Jerusalem instead he exacted a ransom so we have corroborating testimony from Antiquity as to the saving of Jerusalem at that time by the very King the Lord defeated the only city he didn't conquer excuse me I'm a little excited have you seen the news lately something just came to light in the past few weeks about this very event Isaiah chapter 37 was in the news maybe the Lord was saving it for us tonight I like to to think so many of the towns and cities the Assyrians conquered in Isaiah's day are lost to history their locations are uncertain and where exactly did this Army encamp against Jerusalem using information from this relief on the wall of a palace in Nineveh showing sakib's Army attacking lakish a gentleman named Steven Compton an independent scholar specializing in eastern archaeologies believes he's identified the site of the lakish encampment as well as many other sites of Assyrian encampments in sarb's campaign some 2,700 years ago he details these finds are you ready for this in the June 2024 edition of the publication near Eastern archaeology this just came out I think that makes it news notice the Syrian Camp is an oval in shape just like this one north of the old city of Jerusalem a location known as ammunition Hill this is likely one of the sites of sarb's army until now this location was long thought to have been a Roman military Camp uh-uh Roman camps are always rectangular if you've been to Mada and looked down at the traces of the camps from nearly 2,000 years ago you can plainly see their shapes as rectangles and not just near Mada this was standard practice in the Roman army I've included a URL in this slide in case you want to read an article you don't got to write the whole thing down patterns of evidence one word.com search there and you'll you'll find some more information about this if you wish well that's very interesting brother Lyall but one of our stated purposes in going through the books of the Old Testament in our Bibles is to show places that speak of the Messiah of Jesus Isaiah is filled with such references many of them are so familiar to us just a sampling of them Isaiah 7 the Lord himself shall give you a sign Behold a virgin shall conceive bear a son shall call his name Emanuel the Fulfillment Matthew 1 now all this was done why that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet Isaiah saying Behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name Emmanuel which being interpreted as God with us we say Emmanuel but it's m another prophecy Isaiah 9 nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation when at the first he lightly Afflicted the land of zebulun and the land of nephal those were two sons of Jacob and afterward did more grievously a afflict her by the way of the sea which is the Sea of Galilee Beyond Jordan and Galilee of the Nations Galilee of the nations of the Gentiles I thought this was Israeli territory the people that walked in darkness have seen a great light they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death upon them hath the light shined I I think he's talking about Herod at this point but in Matthew 4 we read a fulfillment now when Jesus had heard that John the Baptist was cast into prison he departed into gallilee leaving Nazareth he came and dwelt at Capernaum which is upon the Sea Coast it's on the shore of the Sea of Galilee in the borders of zebulun and Napalm naftali why did he go there that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet saying the land of Z and the land of nephine by the way of the sea the the lake Beyond Jordan Galilee of the Gentiles the people which sat in darkness saw a great light and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up another one I really like this one I like all of them but Isaiah 40:3 the voice of him that crith in the wilderness prepare the way of the Lord make straight in the desert a highway for our God every Valley shall be exalted Every Mountain and Hill should be made low the Crooked shall be made straight the rough places plain smooth the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and All Flesh shall see it together for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it and it's fulfillment Matthew 3 in those days Came John the Baptist preaching of the Wilderness of Judea and saying repent ye the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah saying the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare you the way of the Lord make his path straight Mark and Luke also report this and so does John John's gospel is even more direct and when the representatives sent from the Pharisees asked John the Baptist oh what then art thou Elias and he said I am not art thou that Prophet spoken by Moses and he answered no so they said to him who are you that we may give an answer to them that sent us what sayest thou of thyself and John said I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness make straight the way of the Lord as said the prophet Isaiah it wasn't just others that identified him he identified himself that was pretty bold in front of those Pharisees another prophecy Isaiah 42 behold my servant whom I uphold my elect and whom my soul delighteth I have put my spirit upon him he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles he shall not cry nor lift up nor cause his voice to be heard in the street a bruised Reed shall he not break and the smoking flax shall he not quench he shall bring forth judgment unto truth he shall not fail nor be discouraged till he have set judgment in the earth and the Isles the coasts the Gentiles the other nations shall wait for his law the Fulfillment but when Jesus knew it he withdrew himself from F and great multitudes followed him and he healed them all and charged them that they should not make him known why why that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet saying behold my servant whom I have chosen my beloved in whom my soul is well pleased I will put my spirit upon him and he shall show judgment to the Gentiles he shall not strive nor cry neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets a bruised Reed shall he not break smoking flax shall he not quench till he send forth judgment under Victory and in his name shall the Gentiles trust perfect fulfillment another prophecy Isaiah 42 I the Lord have called thee in righteousness and will hold thine hand and will keep thee in give thee for a covenant of the people for a light of the Gentiles to open the blind eyes to bring out the prisoners from the prison and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house and we see a fulfillment as Jesus is asked by John's followers John's been in prison for a while he scratching his head and wondering did that really happen at that baptism John's Messengers said unto Jesus art thou he that should come or do we look for another Jesus answered and said unto them go and show John again those things which you do hear and see the blind receive their sight the lame walk lepers are cleansed the deaf here the dead are raised up the poor have the gospel preached to them and blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me another one I'm sure that you're all familiar with Isaiah 61 the spirit of the Lord is upon me because the Lord hath anointed me to preach Good Tidings unto the meek he hath sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord the day of the Vengeance of our God to comfort all that mourn and in Luke's gospel Jesus came to Nazareth his hometown where he' been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for to read There was delivered unto him the book SC of the prophet Isaiah and when he opened the book he found the place where it was written Jesus speaking the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives recovering of sight to the blind to set at Liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and Jesus closed the book and gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him note when you're reading in the gospels always pay attention to Jesus when he sits and speaks because he's about to teach and he began to say unto them this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears something else about the book of Isaiah it it it parallels the Bible I mentioned Isaiah is a controversial book in the late 18th century there arose a method of research sometimes referred to as higher criticism or historical criticism it's a way to de construct and examine ancient texts including the books of the Bible looking for Clues from language idiom and style as to their era perhaps their authorship as a result of this approach Isaiah is often broken into two sections Isaiah's name is mentioned over and over in chapters 1 through 39 and his name is not mentioned again chapters 40- 66 the writing style is also different in this second part some say that Isaiah stopped writing after chapter 39 for perhaps a period of 15 years or so and and then wrote the last part of the book others suggest and some insist the second part was written in one or two stages a century or more later partly because of the Precision he he predicts a Babylonian guy named Cyrus a couple hundred years before Cyrus existed and when Assyria was the ascendant thing and Babylonia was just a Backwater regardless of the controversy of when or by whom let's take a quick look at this point of division consider the opening lines first of all the first part is 39 chapters corresponds to 39 books of the Old Testament the second from 40 through 66 would then correspond to the New Testament well if that's true then let's take a look at the beginning of chapter 40 which would correspond to the beginning of the New Testament the gospels right comfort you comfort ye my people saith your God speak you comfortably Jerusalem cry unto her that her Warfare is accomplished her iniquity is pardoned she hath received of the Lord's hand double for all her sins the voice of him that crith in the wilderness prepare ye the the way of the Lord make straight in the desert a highway for our God every Valley shall be exalted Every Mountain and Hill shall be made low the Crooked shall be made straight the rough plac is plain the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and All Flesh shall see it together for the mouth of the Lord ha spoken it what an introduction to the gospels of the New Testament the good news bringing comfort and eventually the comforter to the people and we saw in each of the Gospel accounts the first part of the New Testament all begin with quotes from this section identifying John the Baptist at a minimum it's a fascinating parallel in placement consider how the New Testament ends in Revelation with a description of a new Heaven and a new Earth Revelation 21 I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first half Heaven and the first Earth were passed away there was no more Sea and the bride of Christ is described as being Jerusalem verse n there came unto me one of the Seven Angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues and talked with me saying come hither I'll show Thee the bride the Lamb's wife and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and showed me that great City the holy Jerusalem descending Out of Heaven from God now look at the end of Isaiah the last two chapters Isaiah 65 say for behold I create new heavens and a new Earth the former shall not be remembered nor come into mind be ye glad and rejoiceful forever and that which I create for behold I create Jerusalem a rejoicing at her people a joy and I will rejoice in Jerusalem and joy in my people and the voice of weeping shall be heard no more in her nor the voice of crying Isaiah concludes in chapter 66 as the new heavens and the new Earth which I will make shall remain before me saith the Lord so shall your seed and your name remain it shall come to pass that from one new moon to another from one Sabbath to another shall All Flesh come to worship before me saith the Lord wow what about some of this I mean that these parallels are just amazing amen one of the objections or criticism raised about Isaiah is its disturbing accuracy its Precision naming Cyrus as a conqueror a couple hundred years before he came to power oh that's just history written as if it were prophecy and higher criticism gives us evidence that this part of Isaiah was not written by Isaiah or during his lifetime well the oldest Hebrew manuscripts were for centuries from around 1,000 ad who knows if they were accurate or if they'd been altered the oldest Greek seagan Scrolls or parchments are from about 400 ad and these were from Christian monasteries it's easy to Discount some of the prophecies especially of Isaiah concerning the Messiah they were often considered likely to be the result of later Christian influence or manipulation well in this time of skepticism and rejection you believe the Bible you're kind of silly in 1947 came the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls you may recall my telling the story of how Dr elazer sukenik of the chair of Palestinian archaeology at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem came into possession of three of the first Scrolls on November 29th 1947 he began to read from them in his home that same day at the very hour the radio was playing a broadcast of the live vote at the UN that created the state of Israel one of the three Scrolls in sukenik possession that fateful night when a Hebrew scholar again read ancient Hebrew writing that had Lain dormant for nearly 2,000 years was a partial copy of the book we're reviewing this evening Isaiah and not only that but of all the Scrolls eventually found there's only one that is a complete book of the Bible as one scroll and not collections of fragments from various caves a scroll reli dated to about 150 BC long before the time of Jesus 24 ft long 17 sheets of parchment each 10 or 10 and a half inches tall about the same as a standard sheet of paper 54 Columns of text it's the book of Isaiah it's not one of the Books of Moses but the book that proclaims the Messiah moving the calendar back over a thousand years and the accuracy of the copies from 1,000 ad when compared testify to the Integrity of the scribes who labored painstakingly copying the biblical texts through centuries and Millennia from the time of Moses to the present day the Dead Sea schools how God preserved these to come to light in an age of unparalleled skepticism of times of challenge to simple faith in the god of the Bible the one true God the creator of the universe the lover and Redeemer of our souls I just think of that song how I love him how I adore him my breath my sunshine my all in all the great Creator became my savior and all God's fullness dwells in him let's consider Isaiah chapter 53 now that we know its historical accuracy dated to well before the time of Christ it's only 12 verses let's read the whole chapter who hath believed our report to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of a dry ground he speaking of Jesus he hath no form nor cess and when we shall see him there's no beauty that we should desire him he's despised rejected of men a Man of Sorrows acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did asse him stricken smitten of God and Afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him him with his stripes we are healed all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way right he's talking about me and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all he was oppressed he was afflicted he opened not his mouth he's brought as a lamb to the slaughter as a sheep before her shearers as dumb he opened not his mouth he was taken from prison and from judgment who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people for the transgression of wildy Johnson was he stricken he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him Heath put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand he shall see the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquities therefore will I divide him a portion with the great and he shall divide the spoiler with the strong because he ha poured out his soul unto death he was numbered with the transgressors he be the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors the suffering servant I want to share something with you this this is is a photo of Dr Seth pastell raised in a devout Jewish Home challenged by scripture and being told by his peers that he didn't really understand Hebrew he became a Hebrew scholar eventually obtaining a PhD in Hebrew Bible is now a recognized Authority Biblical Hebrew he's the chair of of of Hebrew language at a university in natanya Israel now he's the author of reading Moses seeing Jesus that I referred to when we looked at the Book of Numbers several months ago I want to play an 80c audio clip of part of his testimony telling how he came to faith in Christ I grew up in New Jersey very well aware of our Jewish identity I do remember that whenever my dad was really really angry the worst thing he could ever say was Jesus Christ my mom started to become more and more spiritual and she started to read the Bible she started to read the Old Testament what we called it or the the Hebrew Bible she became more and more Curious intellectually with Jesus she came home with the very good news to tell my father maray I've been searching the scriptures I've been reading I've been studying and Jesus is the Messiah my father started to cry he said I thought I married a Jew how could you betray our people how could you do this please tell me why do you believe in Jesus but please don't show me the New Testament because of course we knew Christians hate Jews Christians believe in the New Testament the New Testament must be anti-semitic as she read to him Isaiah 53 my father got very angry and he stopped her and he said I told you Lorraine I don't want to hear the New Testament and she stopped and she said well muray this is our side of the book this is this is not the New Testament there was this is a prophecy from 700 years before Jesus was born well my father was in shock just in case you're wondering his father eventually came to faith in Christ as well God let's take a closer look there's so much in this book Let's Take just one lesson from it that we can apply to our lives every day uh please look at the card with the verse that you were given they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint this is a very familiar scripture to us but what does that mean they that wait on the Lord Lord I've prayed it's in your hands now I'm going to take a nap and when you get it done come and let me know I'm just gonna wait is that what it means I I I don't think so so I I thought what what are you saying here Lord so go to the Hebrew what is the Hebrew that the King James translates say but they that wait upon others use trust in hope in wait for turns out it's a single Hebrew word two syllables three letters kava strong tells us as a primitive root to bind together perhaps by twisting that is collect figuratively to expect gather together look patiently Terry wait for Honor upon like most words it has many meanings why is there brother Lyle on this that you've given us not a thread or a ribbon or a string but twine twine is made by twisting so you could say they that are entwined with the Lord shall renew their strength not to replace the concepts of patiently waiting or hoping or trusting but the goal is to become entwined Inseparable isn't that where our strength in the Lord comes from our Unity with our cleaving to him to be entwined Inseparable Jesus said in one of his last prayers a prayer that specifically includes us includes you includes me musicians if you would please come John 17 Jesus is praying as thou sent me into the world even so have I also sent them my disciples into the world and for their sakes I sanctify myself that they also might be Sanctified through the truth neither pray I for these alone but for them also which Shall Believe on me through their word that's Jesus praying for you that's Jesus praying for me do you think God heard the prayers of Jesus that they that's us we all may be one as thou father art in me and I in thee that they also may be one in US Ecclesiastes tells us a three-fold C three-fold cord is not quickly broken that the world may believe that thou has sent me and the glory which thou gavest me I have given them why to what end for what purpose the that they may be one entwined even as we are one utterly intwined Inseparable he emphasizes this and I in them and thou in me that they may be made perfect complete in one and that the world may know that thou Hast sent me and H has loved them as thou has loved me with that thought with that context let's close this portion of the service and pass it back to brother Daniel as we worship and song from Isaiah chapter [Music] 40 they that wait upon the shall reew the their strength they shall Mount up with W as eal they shall love andly wey they shall walk and not teach me Lord teach me more wait teach me more to wa down on my kns tilling your own good time you answer my PL teach to rela on what others do but to wait in prayer for an answer from you they that wait upon the Lord shall Ral their strength they shall M up with way as he goes they shall R and not be weary they shall walk and not teach me Lord teach me Lord to wait Teach Me Lord to wait while hearts are a flame and may humble my God and pour on your name keep my fath
