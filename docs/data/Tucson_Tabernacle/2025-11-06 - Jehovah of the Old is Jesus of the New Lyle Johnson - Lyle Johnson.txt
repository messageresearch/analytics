[applause] You may be seated. Um Sarah, are you you ready to sing? And we got a couple of song specials. And you want to take the request right now while she's getting ready. &gt;&gt; Brother Ernie, could you check in the in the front for please? Sister Crystal, is Izzy not here? Oh, there you are. Okay. Uh, the reason I'm saying Sister Izzy, she has a very important prayer request here. First, we'll start with our praise report. Sister Crystal says this, "My nephew Christopher Collins is doing better. still sore, trouble walking, the swelling is going down, and the pain is getting better. The doctor says it is going to take four weeks to heal. And thank you all for all the prayers. Sister Chris Maria, I appreciate sister Crystal giving us a report on on everything that um we pray about something and you don't hear about it and you want to hear a report. Um couple prayer requests here. Um, Lydia Peterson, young Lydia writes this, "My step cousin's mom was recently diagnosed with stage four cancer. Although I don't know her name, I know that she is not a Christian and her daughter Elena is only 13. Please pray that she will receive complete healing and salvation for her." And Elelliana, I'm sorry, I said Elena. Elelliana. It's a young mother with a child only 13 years old. So, I'm sure that we can all relate to that. And then Izzy writes this. Please pray for the Nut family. Stephen, my friend, he took his own life. Please remember the family in prayer at this difficult time. Sister, that is that the one that you and I prayed for before or is that okay? This is a different one. Let's all stand. Friends, I do appreciate these two young ladies, Izzy and Lydia. I can see a burden that they have for other people. And can you imagine going through life, being born, and going all the way to your death, and no one has ever prayed for you. And I I look at these these young ladies and they have a burden for these other people. And if nothing else, and I think it's a very very important thing that these people have been prayed for. And I believe that God has required our prayers. That's the way that he does things. He set prayer in order. And we are when we pray for one another, we are being obedient to his word. Let's bow our heads. If you would have a request on your heart that you would like to make known to the Lord Jesus, either for yourself or someone else, if you would lift up your hand before him, sees all things and said that wherever two or three are gathered in my name, there will be in the midst of them. Friends, if we believe that to be true, then we believe that he is here with us and he sees our hands go up before him. Our father, we pray, Lord, for salvation and for healing, for this mother and and this daughter, Lord, that you'd comfort the family and that you'd strengthen them. And Lord, we know that when you heal us of our sicknesses, that if time goes on, we would just get sick again. But Lord, when you heal our soul and when you change our soul, Father, it it never gets sick again. And we live all we can live through eternity, Lord, in your presence. We pray for salvation of this woman with cancer, Lord, that you'd help her. Most of all, Lord, we we pray for the healing of her body. But Lord, when she receives that healing, we pray that she would look her eyes up to Calvary and see where her healing comes from. Lord, pray for this family that lost this boy, took his own life. Can imagine the hardship, suffering that this family is going through. Lord to pray that you would comfort them and heal their hearts, Father. And may they find somehow someway may they find Christ in this situation. For every uplifted hand, Lord, we pray that you would answer each request. You saw them, Lord. We do. We do it in obedience to you. And now Lord, we ask that our prayers would come up before you as a sweet smelling savor as the the altar incense came up before you in times of old. Lord, let our prayers come up before you in the same way. Father, most of all, very most, and really the only thing is we ask for your will in our prayers in all these situations because we know that your will is better than our will. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. God bless you. I felt like these songs needed a little bit of an explanation. Um, it's a medley of songs that we used to sing here. One of them we all know for sure, but the other ones it's been a long time. Um, but we used to sing these. I remember growing up in the tabernacle here singing these songs and they're just a focus on the coming of the Lord and keeping our hearts and minds looking ahead and pressing the battle. So, I hope you're blessed. Oh my comrades, see the signal [music] waving in the sky. Reinforcements [music] now appearing. Victory [singing] is mine. Hold the fort [music] for I am coming. Jesus signal still wave [singing] the answer back to heaven. By thy grace we will fierce and long the [music and singing] battle rages but our help is near. Onward comes [music] our great commander cheer. My comrades cheer and hold the fort for I am coming. [music] Jesus signal still [singing] wave the answer back to heaven. [singing] By thy grace [music] we will hold the fort for I am coming. [music] Jesus signal still wave the answer [music] back to heaven by thy grace we will [singing] when Jesus breaks [singing] the morning the host of heaven will sing [music] hosana in the highest. Christ is our conquering king. We'll clasp our hands [singing] together around that great white throne and join the angels [singing] singing. At last, at last we're home. [singing] When Jesus breaks the morning, the host of heaven [singing] will sing. Hosana in the highest. Christ [music] is our conquering king. We'll clasp our hands together around that great [music] white throne. and join the angels [singing] singing. At last, at last we're home. It will be worth [singing] it all. When we see Jesus, [music] life's trials, [singing] they'll seem so small. [music] When we see Christ, [singing] one glimpse of his dear face, all sorrow will erase. Oh, bravely [singing and music] run the race till we see Christ. It will be worth it all. [singing] When we see Jesus, [singing] life's trials, they'll seem so small. When we see Christ, [singing] one glimpse of his dear face, all [singing] sorrow will erase so [singing] bravely from [music] the race. Till [singing] we see Christ so bravely [singing] run this race till we [singing] see Christ. &gt;&gt; It will be worth it all. Amen. &gt;&gt; We we look at some of the things we've gone through or things that happened, but on that other side to say, "Lord, it was all for a reason." &gt;&gt; Brother Daniel just got a message, Brother John Loker and Sister Annie's wife, his wife's father just passed away. So, let's just bow our heads for a moment here. Lord, there's a a family that's hurting right now, but you're the great comforter, Lord. You took upon yourself wounds and brokenness and hurts so that you could be touched by the feeling of our infirmation. You're the great comforter, Lord. We don't have to always know the reasons why, Lord. We just want to trust in your peace and your rest, Lord. So go to the Logger family and all those associated even now and comfort them we pray in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. It's if as Lydia and AA come ready get ready. Let's sing that [clears throat] I claim the blood of course. I don't claim any goodness. I don't claim any self-righteousness. I claim what he's done for me. I claim the blood Jesus shed on Calary. Those preious [singing] [music] blood stains were made there just for me. for all [singing] my sins, [music] my sickness, and [singing] my pain. When I need healing, I claim [music] those precious blood stain. Claim them as you're singing. I claim the [music] blood Jesus shed on Calary. [singing and music] Those [music] precious blood stains [music] were made there just for [singing] me. for all [singing] my sins, [music] my sickness, and my pain. When I [singing] healing, [music] I claim those pre Have you ever stepped down a mountain too tall to climb? No way to get over no matter how hard you try. But somehow the Lord got you [music] to the other side. Can I get [singing] a witness? [music] Have you stood on the banks of a [music] Red Sea [singing] wrestling down? Cuz it's [music] too far [singing] to swim and too wide to get around. But the good Lord brought you [music] through walking on dry ground. Can I get [singing] a witness? [music] Can I get a witness? Can I get [singing] a hand raised high? Can I get a [singing] witness? Anybody [music] want to testify? If you [music] cried out [singing] for a mold and you've seen him do the impossible. [singing and music] Can I get a witness? [music] Are you standing in a fire and the flames won't let you go? But you're still holding [music and singing] on to a single thread of hope. &gt;&gt; Yeah. The Lord can [music] deliver and you won't even [singing] smell like smoke. Can I get a witness? Can I get [singing and music] a witness? Can I get a hand raised? Can I get a witness? Anybody [music and singing] want to testify? If you cried out for [singing] a miracle and you've [music] seen him do the impossible, can I get a witness? [singing] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; If you can't [singing] stay silent, if you can't keep [singing] quiet, then here's your [music] chance. Can I get a witness? [singing] Can [music] I get a witness? Can I get a hand raised? [music and singing] Can I get a witness? Anybody [music] want to testify? If you cried out [singing] for a miracle and you've seen them do the impossible, [music] [singing] can I get a witness? Can I [singing and music] get a witness? It's they've been practicing after service after a lot of people have gone. So, Sister Lydia, thank you and God bless you and That's from brother Aaron. From Papa Brown. Hi, Papa Brown. My niece, my great niece here. Thank you and God bless you, Sean. Wasn't it good? Good to see you back. You know, our children could be somewhere else, but by the grace of God, they're here. There are many that wish or pray to have their children still around. So, when they're still here, you can thank God and be grateful. Amen. Let's sing as brother Lyall prepares to come on out to worthy worthy the lamb that was slain of course this whole thought process in in the songs I was just thinking about what he's done for me because really what have I done for him nothing to ear I can I can present this to you, Lord. It's worth this. No. Jesus paid it all. Worthy. [music] Worthy. Worthy. The lamb that was slain. Worthy, [music] worthy, worthy. [singing] The lamb that was slain. One more time. You're worthy, [music] worthy, worthy. The lamb that was slain. Worthy. Worthy. Worthy is [singing] the lamb that was slain. Worthy. [music] Worthy, worthy. The [singing] lamb that was slain, worthy, worthy, worthy. the lamb that was slain. [singing] How true. How true. He's the one that was worthy. And it's through his righteousness that we're able to approach the Lord, that we're able to gather together this evening in his name and around his word. I'll start with my usual good evening and thank you so much. We've been speaking of praise and worship of the Lord for several weeks. Last time, brother Josiah AO taught from John 4 that God is a spirit and must be worshiped in spirit and in truth. We realize that Jesus was a man. It was also God. Have you ever asked yourself how Jesus Christ of the New Testament could be a Jehovah God of the Old? In the Old Testament, the the Hebrew Bible, we read of the flood in Noah's time, the destruction of Sodom and Abraham's. The command to utterly destroy certain cities during the conquest of Canaan under Joshua, later under Saul. In the New Testament, we read that God so loved the world, he gave his only begotten son that whoever believed in him would not perish but have everlasting life that he forgave the very ones crucifying him. Doesn't the God of the Old Testament sometimes seem violent and harsh? Well, Jesus seemed to reach out in mercy and love to everyone. How can we reconcile this seeming contradiction of God's nature? Or is God really a committee of two or maybe three beings? A angry, vengeful one complimented by a merciful and forgiving one. Who is it that we are to worship? Before addressing this, let's approach our Lord once more together in prayer. Lord Jesus, we're in awe of you. We're so grateful, Lord, as we just sang, "Worthy, worthy is the lamb that was slain." Lord, we pray that you'd help us this evening, Lord, to lay aside anything that we may have brought in with us that's unpleasing to you. Help us to set aside the the weights, the cares of this world, the troubles, the the the things that, Lord, just just pull at us, Lord. and and again thinking of uh the locers and sister Anne and how she was able to go out there on Monday so she could be there at the time that her father passed. What a what a wonderful token of your love to that family, Lord. Lord, we just pray now as we're together this evening that you'd move by your spirit. That you'd answer questions, Lord, and Lord, stop me from saying anything that would cause people to stumble or to doubt, but Lord, that questions might be answered, Lord. And that and Lord, that you just draw us ever closer together to yourself and in yourself, Lord, that love of Christ shed or brought in our hearts. You said, Lord, that by this will all men know you're my disciples. Not by doctrines, not by [snorts] this and that, but by the love that we have one for another. Bring that to full fruition on our lives. Lord, we pray as we commit the remainder of this evening into your hands in Jesus precious name. Amen. For our opening scriptures, please turn with me to the first page in the biblical text, Genesis chapter 1. And by the way, the title screen image is of Genesis 1:1 and part of verse two from the Lengrad CEX. The same verses that Brother Joseph Hokensson recited to us in Hebrew at the conclusion of last Sunday evening service, but we'll do it in English. In the beginning, God Elohim created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form and void. Darkness was where? Upon the face of the deep. And the spirit of God moved, literally hovered. The perspective of the narrator moves from a distant observer who sees the universe from afar in verse one to the surface of the third planet in orbit around a star we call the sun in verse two. The spirit of God hovered upon the face of the waters. And God from the surface of the planet said, "Let there be light." And there was light. And God saw the light that it was good. And God divided the light from the darkness. God called the light day and the darkness he called night. The evening and the morning were the first day. From this we see that there was a beginning that God created the universe that his focus then moved to the surface of our planet. It was all created by God. Elohim, one of the name references of God in the Old Testament. Well, let's move to a another narrative of the creation. This time from the first chapter of the gospel according to John. In the beginning was the word. The word was with God. The word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made. Tracks perfectly with the first verses of Genesis 1. In him was life, and the life was the light of men. The light shined in darkness. The darkness comprehended it not. Skipping down to verse 10. He was in the world. The world was made by him. The world knew him not. He came unto his own. His own received him not. But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name, which were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. And the word, which verses 1 to3 declared is the creator, and in fact is God, was made flesh and dwelt among us. And we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the father, full of grace and truth. Please be seated. These two passages seem to confirm that Jesus of the New Testament is God of the Old Testament. We see in Genesis 1 that God Elohim created everything. And in John 1, we see that the God who created everything became flesh and a man we call Jesus. In Jesus we read was life and light. We see evidence of this in the Old Testament. life. Genesis 2 tells us, "The Lord God formed man of the dust of the earth and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul, light." When Moses led his people out of Egypt, we read in Exodus 13, "And the Lord," who? The Lord Yahweh went before Moses and the Israelites by day in a pillar of a cloud to lead them the way and by night. Huh? And a pillar of fire to give them light to go by day and night. He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night from before the people. Here we see God in a light described as a pillar of fire. Many centuries later in the book of Acts chapter nine, we we read about Saul, a devout Pharisee, deeply knowledgeable about the Old Testament based on his understanding of the scriptures. He was an ardent persecutor of the early followers of Jesus. On a campaign to arrest more Christians, he was in route from Jerusalem to Damascus. And as Saul, later called Paul, journeyied, he came near Damascus, and suddenly there shined about him a light from heaven. He later says it was brighter than the noonday sun. And he and the company with him, he tells us later, fell to the earth. And only Saul heard a voice saying unto him, and he tells us later in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? Sha Sha lane. And Saul said, Who are you, Lord? Lord, he recognized the light had to be supernatural from God and knew of Moses' journey of old. Lord, hidden in the light, who are you? And who? The Lord said, I am Jesus of Nazareth, he says later, whom thou persecutest, it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks. and Saul trembling and astonished. Astonished. You can be sure he was astonished to discover that the God he worshiped and served was the very one he was trying to destroy. Trembling and astonished, Saul said, "Lord, what will you have me do?" Paul recognized at that moment that Jesus Christ was Jehovah God. You know, I like to mix things up, not fall into a pattern. So, tonight I'm going to share with you a number of comments that were made by Brother Brandham related to the topic of tonight's lesson. Brother Brandham talked about this event in an absolute January of 1963. He said, "Oh, brother, do you see what I mean? That same Jesus that went up came back again on the day of Pentecost in the form of the Holy Ghost and fire. It should be upon the people doing the same thing he did because he said it would do it. Where are we at? See what I mean? Moses, the fire was in Moses. It left the bush. Come on, Moses. We tried to put the fire in the furnace. It's about all we got. What we need is Holy Spirit fire. The same pillar of fire that led Israel. Sure. Oh, you say, "Now, [clears throat] Brother Brandham, I'd be careful about that." Now wait a minute. When Paul, the great theologian that had plenty of experience, but on the road to Damascus, he was stricken down. He looked up. There was that pillar of fire. He knew that was God. He'd seen it vindicated in the Bible. It was God. Paul called him Lord. Said, "Lord, who are you? What can I do?" He said, "I am Jesus." That settled it. Paul had an absolute. He knew that the God of the Old Testament was Jesus Christ of the New. There he was anchored. Nothing should move him. Sure, he had the vindication. Why? The same pillar of fire that led his people out of Egypt into Israel into Palestine, that same pillar of fire was standing there claiming to be Jesus Christ. Then he knew where he was at. Then he was ready. Soon as he got healed and filled with the Holy Ghost, he was ready to go. See, one more little comment from July 1952. It's the same today. Both new and old testaments, God of the Old Testament was Jesus of the New and the Holy Spirit of today. You know that. Don't you believe that? Let's move on then. How do we reconcile the apparent nature of the God of the Old Testament with the nature of Jesus Christ of the New? For example, God tells Abraham in Genesis chapter 15, "Thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace. Thou shalt be buried in a good old age. But in the fourth generation, they your descendants who will have been in a place where they will have been oppressed shall come hither again. For the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full. How do we interpret this statement to Abraham? One perspective is that God is saying, "The Amorites aren't quite bad enough for me to have them all killed, but they will be in another few hundred years, and I can't hardly wait to destroy them. Or is it God extending mercy? Abraham, this entire population is really, really evil. But they're part of my creation. I want to extend to them every opportunity to repent and change their ways. I'm a merciful God, not an uncaring tyrant. Let me give them a few hundred more years of mercy while I form your descendants into a nation. Which is more likely given that this is really the spirit of Jesus? When the time passes, Moses is leading the Israelites to the threshold of Canaan. God speaks through Moses to the people. Deuteronomy 9. Speak not thou in thy heart, after that the Lord thy God hath cast them out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness the Lord hath brought me into possess this land. But for the wickedness of these nations, the Lord doth drive them out from before thee. And we know in the Old Testament and in Hebrew, when something is repeated immediately, it's for extra emphasis. And the very next verse, not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thine heart dust thou go to possess their land, but for the wickedness of these nations, the Lord thy God doth drive them out from before thee, and that he may perform the word which the Lord swear unto thy fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. This emphatically tells us that God's motive was what? removing evil. If the time gap between Abraham and Moses was to give the Amorites an opportunity to repent and turn to God, you may ask, "Why did he set things up for their destruction?" Some would say, "Well, they were predestinated to be destroyed." Implying they had no choice, no free will, that God created them for the purpose of destroying them. Not so. Again, brother Brandham, now there's a doctrine of predestination which is rotten nonsense. But there really is a true predestination. God by fornowledge could predestinate because he has fornowledge. God's not willing that any should perish. But being the infinite God, he knew who would perish and who would not. So God, as is his nature, was extending mercy, but in his heart, not being constrained by time, but able to look ahead, he knew they would not. So we set things up to limit the evil, not let it spread. If you liken it to an infection, the people Moses were leading were the white blood cells to attack and remove an infection. Except, of course, white blood cells aren't motivated by ethics or concern or love or hate. They're more like robots that just do. What about when there's a motive? Consider one year ago, I found myself in a strange place. I'd never been there before. People took my ID and money, made me sit in a chair in a room with only one way in or out. Soon, a man with a knife approached me. Fortunately, he was a surgeon, and the knife was to remove a cancer from my left ear. His motive was to help me, not harm me, even though he would have to inflict pain in the process. His goal was to remove and destroy the cancer. before it could spread its influence in my body and eventually destroy me. Let's look at another event in the Bible again from the time of Abraham. We'll spend a few minutes on this one because it not only shows an example of containing and limiting evil, it also shows God's mercy and compassion while doing so. a skilled surgeon. God had told Abram to separate himself from his old family. But Abram was still looking after his nephew, Lot. He finally told Lot, "Look, you go one way, I'll go the other. You choose." Genesis 13, we read, "Lot lifted up his eyes and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was wellwatered everywhere before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zor." Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan. And Lot journeyed east. And they, Abram and Lot, separated themselves, the one from the other. Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan. Lot dwelt in the cities of the plain and pitched his tent toward Sodom. But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the Lord exceedingly. Years later, three men came to Abraham and he called them God, my Lord, singular. He served them as we related a few weeks ago. Two of the men then went down the hill to Sodom. Abraham knew the intent was to destroy the place. Abraham was concerned about Lot and asked God if there were a certain number of righteous, would he withhold his hand of judgment? And kind of went back and forth. Eventually, he stopped asking when God said, "If there were 10 righteous, he would not destroy." From this within Judaism, there's a tradition to have 10 men pray together called Dominion. But the God of the Old Testament was more merciful than requiring even 10 righteous. Let's read Genesis 19. There came two angels to Sodom at even. Lot sat in the gate of Sodom. And Lot, seeing them, rose up to meet them and bowed himself with his face toward the ground. And Lot said, "Behold now my lords. Turn in, I pray you, into your servants's house, and terry all night, and wash your feet, and you shall rise up early and go on your ways. And they said, "Nay, we'll abide in the street all night." And Lot, knowing this was a very bad idea, pressed upon them greatly. And they turned in unto him, and entered into his house. And he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat, very similar to how Abraham had entreated and treated the three that came to him earlier that same day. While at Lots, some locals came to abuse the new arrivals, and the angels supernaturally deterred them. Skipping down to verse 12. And the men, the two angels, said unto Lot, "Hast thou here any besides, son-in-law, thy sons, thy daughters, whosoever thou hast in the city?" In other words, Lot, do you have any other family in this place besides the ones that are in your house? Bring them out of this place, for we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxed great before the face of the Lord, and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it." Lot went out, spake to his sons-in-law, which married his daughters, and said, "Up, get you out of this place. The Lord will destroy this city." But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons-in-law. They and their wives, Lot's own daughters, will remain in the city along with their husbands and and any children they may have had were not told. And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, "Arise, take thy wife and thy two daughters which are here, lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city." And while Lot lingered, we're not told why. Perhaps he was trying to think of a way to rescue his married daughters. Perhaps he had grandchildren in the city. While he delayed, the men laid hold upon his hand the hand of his wife and on the hand of his two daughters. The Lord being merciful to them. Do you see the nature we associate with Jesus and they brought him forth and set him without the city, literally dragged them out. Mrs. Lot looked back again. We're not told why. Perhaps there was a mother's love and concern for her family left behind. But having been specifically told to not look back, she died on the spot. Lot didn't want to travel very far, asking to be released to go into a nearby little city. I don't want to go all the way to that mountain. Just let me go to this little town right here. The angels, probably with reluctance, agreed. They told him hasty. Okay, Lot, hurry up. Escape thither. I cannot do anything till thou become thither. Therefore, the name of the city was called Zoir, which means small. The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered Zoir. Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah, brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven. He overthrew those cities and all the plain and all the inhabitants of the cities which grew upon the ground. He removed the cancer. In his mercy and care for humankind, God excised a cancer which had spread such it infected every person in that area except for Lot, his wife, and his two unmarried daughters. You may be asking, why did God let it get so bad in the first place? I'd have to answer that if if it's the same God that was present in Christ, he was giving the people a chance, time to repent, to be saved. He he did this even to the point of sending Lot there to be a witness to them. We read in second Peter, turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes, condemned them with an overthrow, making them an example unto those that after should live ungodly. An example. Anybody here ever heard of Sodom and Gomorrah? It wasn't done in a corner, but in part his warning to us. 4,000 years later, we can still learn from this example. And there's more. Peter goes on, "And delivered just Lot vexed with the filthy filthy conversation of the wicked. For that righteous man dwelling among them in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with her unwful deeds." Let's unwrap that a little bit. The New King James reads, "And delivered righteous lot, who was oppressed by the filthy conduct of the wicked, for that righteous man dwelling among them tormented his righteous soul from day to day by seeing and hearing their lawless deeds." They had a witness. God sent a witness. I mentioned earlier about the cancer on my ear. Those of us who have been here for a while recall our founding pastor, Brother Perry Green. He also had a cancer on his left ear, but it wasn't detected or treated soon enough. In spite of the best efforts of the surgeons and oncologists and the many prayers for his healing, the cancer spread and eventually took his life. We see a kind of example or parallel of this in the story of Noah. God's extreme patience that by analogy allowed the cancer to spread throughout the body of humanity. Genesis 6 we read, "And God saw that the wickedness of man," note the singular man here means mankind, all of humanity. The wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his all of mankind's what? heart was occasionally. No, only evil how often? Continually. God looks on the heart always. And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth and it grieved him at his what? At God's very heart. And the Lord said, "I will destroy man who I have created from the face of the earth, both man and beast, the creeping thing, the fowls of the air. It repents me that I made them." Man was so corrupt that his continued presence even corrupted the animal life around him. But wait, look. In spite of his grieving, the coming judgment, he was still the God of the New Testament. even in the book of Genesis. Why? But Noah found what? Grace in the eyes of the Lord. Grace, the attribute we so often associate with Jesus. These are the generations of Noah. Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations. And Noah walked with God. Noah walked with God. This is also said of one of Noah's ancestors when things were bad but not quite as bad. We we read in the previous chapter Genesis 5, Enoch walked with God just like Noah and he was not for God took him. Same God, same description of his relationship. You can't put God in a box. He's not constrained by our doctrines or our concepts of his nature or ability or or what he might do in a given situation. He's not a tool at our beck and command. He's not a genie in a bottle. He's not there when it's convenient for us to reach into our toolbox and have him serve us or tools in his toolbox to worship and praise and serve him. We've been reading from Genesis and Revelation. We read, "Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power for thou hast created all things." Who are we talking about? And for what purpose? For thy pleasure they are and were created. Back to Noah. The earth also was corrupt before God. And the earth was filled filled with violence. God looked upon the earth and behold it was corrupt. For all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth. And God said unto Noah, "The end of all flesh has come before me. The earth is filled with violence through them. Behold, I will destroy them with the earth." He then tells Noah to build a giant boat in the midst of the plains where he lived. Skipping down to verse 17. "And behold, I, even I, to bring a flood of waters upon the earth to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life from under heaven, and everything that is in the earth shall die. it with thee I will establish my covenant and thou shalt come into the ark, thou and thy sons and thy wife and thy sons wives with thee. And the Lord said unto Noah, "Come thou and all thy house into the ark, for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation." The entire human race had become violent thoughts continually evil. In Enoch's case, God rescued Enoch from a world going very bad. In Noah's case, I think it's even more special. God not only rescued him, but preserved him and his immediate family in such way as to give humanity a reset, to carry out his plan for the creation and for mankind. Was Noah perfect? Far from it. But Noah found what? Grace, favor in God's sight. Why? When virtually everyone constantly imagined only evil in their hearts, God who looks on the heart. So Noah was the exception. No one except his family accepted his invitation to get on the ark. Second Peter 2:5 tells us Noah was a preacher of righteousness. He was telling people what was going to happen. It took a while to build that boat. And it was a big boat. We got room for you. Come on. When the flood came, Noah couldn't open the door to any who pounded on it, screaming for mercy and rescue. God had closed it. Genesis 7:16 tells us the Lord shut him in. It was then too late for those outside the ark. God didn't just rescue Noah and his family. God rescued the human race. We are each one a descendant of Noah. Little sidebar. You don't believe the story? It's just a myth. It it No, that didn't happen. Molecular biology studies of mitochondrial DNA which comes from the female indicates that we are all descended from one female ancestor or a small group of female ancestors at some point in the distant past. The Bible calls the female ancestor Eve. Similar studies of the Y chromosome, which comes only from the male side and is passed from father to son, indicate that we are all descended from a single male ancestor or small group of male ancestors which occurred much later in human history. In other words, our DNA suggests, some might say indicates that there was a near extinction event in early human prehistory and only one male survived. The Bible calls this the flood and that this happened before the great migration of humans across the globe. The Bible tells us this later common male ancestor was Noah. These molecular biology studies, by the way, are not social media inspired speculation, but serious academic research. The book pictured here has hundreds of footnoted references to scientific research papers, if that's your thing. We could illustrate many other examples of the nature of God in the Old Testament being the same as the nature of Jesus in the New or the realization that Jesus did nothing without the guidance of the father of the spirit of God within him. We recognize that the terrible judgment and violence we see in the Old Testament is a result of evil and its suppression. So we must ask why allow evil in the first place. Why not make man with less propensity to do bad things or have swifter swifter reckoning? Brother Brandham tells us many times that for example God had the attribute of being a healer. To express that there had to be a need for healing likewise for salvation and so forth. God gave us free will. We spoke last time even Cain could have overcome sin if he had chosen to do so. God told him he could. What value is there in forgiveness if there's nothing to forgive? Let's turn to the Gospel according to Luke chapter 7. Simon, one of the Pharisees, desired Jesus that he would eat with him. Jesus went into the Pharisees house and sat down to meet. And behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisees house, brought an alabaster box of ointment, and stood at Jesus' feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment. A few years ago, someone in the church asked me how this was possible. If Jesus sat at a table eating, how could a woman stand behind him and wash his feet? In the summer of 2022, Heather and I went to England and visited the British Museum. I saw this statue from the Roman era and took a picture to show how a person might sit at meat while someone could then stand behind the diner and wash his feet. Context is so important. The meaning of words not always what comes to our minds when we read. Sat at meat we think of a table a chair. In this case it means reclined to eat a meal. Now when the Pharisee who had bidden Jesus saw it, he spake out loud to the fellow next to him, no Simon spoke within himself, saying, "This man, if he were a prophet, he would have known who and what manner of woman this is that touches him, for she's a sinner." And Jesus answering said unto him,"Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee." And Simon said, "Master," meaning teacher, "Say on." And Jesus said to Simon, there was a certain creditor, had two debtors. Simon, one owed him 500 p, 500 bucks, 500,000, 500 somethings, and the other 50, only a tenth. When they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore which of them will love him most. And Simon answered and said, I suppose that he to whom he forgave most. Jesus said unto him, Yeah, you got it. Das rightly judged. And Jesus turned to the woman, but said to Simon, "Do you see this woman? I entered into your house. You gave me no water for my feet, but she's washed my feet with tears, wiped them with the hairs of her head. Thou gavest me no kiss, but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet, my head with oil, thou did not anoint, but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment. Wherefore I say unto thee, Simon, her sins which are many are forgiven, for she loved much, but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little. And Jesus said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven. What they that sat meet with him began to say within themselves, who is this that forgives sins also? That's the right question and it's right to ask that question. Jesus said to the woman, "Thy faith has saved thee. Go in peace." Who can forgive sins? The people there knew exactly the answer. Only Jehovah God of the Old Testament. There was an entire ritual or process for a person to make a sin offering. The priest who offered the sacrifice on behalf of the petitioner did not have the power to forgive only to perform the sacrifice. There was an annual offering for the community on yum kipur the day of atonement. But this was all in order that God would forgive or cover their sins. So who was this Jesus who forgave sins? Paul tells us in Philippians, "Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus, who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God." For our closing scriptures, I I'd like to read the testimony of the first person recorded in the New Testament to recognize and state that Jehovah God of the Old Testament was Jesus Christ of the New Testament. The first one to declare Jesus was in fact God. Wasn't Paul, wasn't Peter. Peter called Jesus the anointed, but didn't call him God. Who did? Well, let's read. The context is Jesus appearing to his disciples after his resurrection and before his ascension. Let's turn to the Gospel of John, chapter 20, starting at verse 24. But Thomas, one of the 12 called Ditimus. Little sidebar. I always find that curious. Ditimus means twin. Does that mean he had a twin brother? Sometimes I wonder if he wasn't just a dead ringer for Jesus. If he wasn't just a lookalike and so they called him the twin. That's just my own personal speculation. Thomas was not with them when Jesus came. The other disciples therefore said to Thomas, "Thomas, we've seen the Lord." Thomas said unto them, "Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails and put my finger in the print of the nails and thrust my hand to his side, I don't believe you guys. You You just were imagining it. You're hallucinating or something." No. After eight days again, Jesus disciples were within that. They're hiding, right? They're afraid of things at that point. And Thomas with them. Then came Jesus. the doors being shut and stood in the midst and said, "Peace be unto you." Then saith he, who? Jesus, to Thomas, "Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands. Reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side. Be not faithless, but believing." And Thomas answered and said unto him, "My Lord and my God. Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed. Blessed are they that have not seen and yet have believed. Anybody here? Yeah. Yeah. The worship team would please come. In addition to these scriptures we've read tonight, we also know that Jesus will sit in judgment. We read some of those scriptures last time. The nature of God has not changed. From Genesis 1:1 through Revelation 22:21, he's the same. He's consistent. I'll let brother Brandon summarize. He says, "Man lost his origin and he back there and fell from grace. And when he did that, God came down and was made in the image of man to redeem man back to God. God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself. And the God of the Old Testament, Jesus Christ of the New, and the Holy Spirit of this day, is the same Jehovah God living down through the age. It's the same grace we read about in Noah's day that's extended to us today through the cross of Calvary. I often think of the verse of Hebrews 13:8, Jesus Christ. The same yesterday, Adam's day, Abraham's day, Noah's day, Moses day, Paul's day, and today, November the 5th, 2025, and forever, reliable, dependable, always there. As we pass the service over to our pastor, Let's stand if you would and worship and we'll sing. Brother Aaron, we're going to sing down from His Glory. Let me let me just read some of the words here as we prepare to sing. Down from His Glory, ever living story. Who my God and Savior came? Jesus was his name.
