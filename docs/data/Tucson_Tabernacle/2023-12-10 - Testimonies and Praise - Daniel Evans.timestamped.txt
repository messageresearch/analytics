[12:55] amen it's good to be in the house of the
[12:57] Lord today for a praise and worship
[13:00] service to give honor and glory to our
[13:03] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ you know
[13:06] there was a time when they asked us who
[13:10] had a testimony and just a young girl
[13:12] there in that Welsh Revival she raised
[13:15] her hand and said I just want to say I
[13:18] love the Lord Jesus and that started
[13:21] such a
[13:22] move because when you give God honor
[13:25] glory and praise he comes in the midst
[13:27] so that's his promise for us today amen
[13:33] so a prayer request we have a couple of
[13:36] requests uh to bring to your attention
[13:38] here uh sister Marlene Henry asked us to
[13:42] remember brother Wilson he had hip
[13:44] surgery so we'll remember for a quick
[13:48] recovery and my older brother Fred had
[13:52] my dad called me and said that he had
[13:53] been with a cold and fever and was
[13:56] asking for prayer and then we had made a
[14:00] request for a little 8-year-old girl
[14:02] named scarlin Scarlet my cousin's
[14:06] granddaughter and um the the Physicians
[14:10] were were uh happy with the way all the
[14:13] surgery went they they felt they were
[14:15] able to do what they wanted to do but it
[14:17] was still in a critical situation as
[14:20] they took a portion of the bone off of
[14:22] the leg and replaced a portion of the
[14:24] bone in the arm but now they were
[14:26] watching the blood flow and everything
[14:29] I asked him how was she Scarlet was
[14:31] doing he said well when she came out of
[14:33] surgery she was in pain and she was
[14:36] cranky and that would be about what you
[14:38] would expect the doctors were able to
[14:41] take care of the pain and then the
[14:42] picture he showed me later she looked
[14:44] happy she's just an eight-year-old young
[14:46] girl with
[14:48] cancer but I know a God and I know if
[14:52] you'll raise your hand I know that same

[18:16] sister Jessica is coming up can I I'll
[18:19] give I'll give the first testimony this
[18:21] one's a this one's a story that uh
[18:24] someone sent to
[18:26] me May uh I don't know 10 years ago or
[18:31] so and uh it's it's a bit of a
[18:33] parody but uh I think it's it's um more
[18:38] true than um than we might we might give
[18:41] it credit for reads like this as I said
[18:45] I I um took this from someone sent it to
[18:48] me and and I uh made a few changes but
[18:52] it says this a few years after I was
[18:54] born my dad met a stranger who is new to
[18:57] our small Texas town from the beginning
[19:01] dad was fascinated with this enchanting
[19:03] newcomer and soon invited him to live
[19:06] with our family The Stranger was quickly
[19:08] accepted and was around from then on as
[19:11] I grew up I never questioned his place
[19:14] in my family in my young mind he had a
[19:17] special Niche my parents were
[19:19] complimentary instructors mom taught me
[19:22] good from Evil and dad taught me to obey
[19:25] but the stranger he was our storyteller
[19:29] he would keep us Spellbound for hours on
[19:31] end with adventures and Mysteries and
[19:34] comedies if I wanted to know anything
[19:36] about politics history or
[19:40] science he always knew the answers about
[19:43] the past he understood the present and
[19:46] even seemed able to predict the
[19:49] future he took my family to the first
[19:51] major league ball
[19:53] game he made me laugh he made me cry The
[19:57] Stranger never never stopped talking but
[20:00] Dad Dad didn't seem to
[20:03] mind sometimes mom would get up quietly
[20:06] while the ref rest of us were shushing
[20:08] each other to listen to what he had to
[20:12] say and she would go to the kitchen for
[20:14] peace and quiet I wonder now if she ever
[20:17] prayed for the stranger to
[20:20] leave dad ruled our household with
[20:23] certain moral convictions but the
[20:24] stranger never felt obligated to honor
[20:27] them profanity for example was not
[20:30] allowed in our
[20:31] home not from
[20:33] us our friends or any
[20:36] visitors our longtime visitor however
[20:39] got away with four-letter words that
[20:41] burned my ears made my dad squirm and my
[20:44] mother
[20:46] blush my dad didn't permit the use of
[20:49] alcohol but on a regular basis The
[20:51] Stranger encouraged us to try
[20:55] it he made cigarettes look cool and
[20:58] cigars manly and pipes
[21:01] distinguished his comments were
[21:03] sometimes blatant sometimes suggestive
[21:06] and generally
[21:09] embarrassing I now know that my early
[21:12] Concepts about relationships were
[21:14] influenced strongly by this
[21:16] stranger time after time he opposed the
[21:18] values of my parents yet he was seldom
[21:22] rebuked and never was he asked to
[21:27] leave more than 50 years have
[21:30] passed since the stranger moved in with
[21:33] our
[21:34] family he has Blended right in and is
[21:38] not nearly as fascinating as he was at
[21:42] first
[21:44] still if you walk into my parents' Den
[21:47] today you will find him sitting over in
[21:49] his Corner waiting for someone to listen
[21:52] to him talk and to watch him draw his
[21:56] pictures his name
[21:59] we call him
[22:01] television he a wife now we call her

[22:08] and Android go everywhere with

[25:37] [Applause]
[25:43] me how long did it take you to figure
[25:46] out who that stranger
[25:49] was I can I remember when Dad allowed a
[25:53] TV in our home we were just young
[25:56] kids
[25:58] and something we had never had in our
[26:01] lives and it didn't last that
[26:04] long he came home and found the house
[26:07] not
[26:08] clean and my sister and my mom watching
[26:11] the TV and me and my brother watching
[26:14] Saturday mornings and not cleaning the
[26:16] yard and he said you're out of here and
[26:20] I thank God for
[26:22] that now sometimes I wish I could toss
[26:25] the phone when I'm driving down the road
[26:26] but it has its
[26:29] place and if you allow God to govern
[26:31] your life the things in your life that
[26:35] are are
[26:36] necessary are able to you're able to
[26:38] keep
[26:41] so there's a song in we'll sing a verse

[28:56] FL
[29:01] brother Ron Glide well if you would make
[29:04] your way up I'll give a short testimony
[29:07] as brother Ron's coming up my
[29:10] um grandfather my uncle
[29:13] Ronnie um and a couple other brothers
[29:16] were standing outside my
[29:18] grandpa's um service station down here
[29:20] on Park Avenue many many years
[29:24] ago and brother brand they were talking
[29:27] about this new fighter named Cashes
[29:32] Clay and this Cashes Clay he
[29:37] um was uh if you've ever heard some of
[29:40] the old videos of Muhammad Ali had just
[29:43] a mouth constantly talking and
[29:46] constantly just taunting and all that
[29:50] and brother brandham they were talking
[29:53] they were standing on the corner outside
[29:54] the the service station there brother
[29:56] brandham
[29:58] came driving up not
[30:00] knowing anything about what they were
[30:03] talking about obviously he couldn't have
[30:04] known rolls down his
[30:08] window and he says this he says Cash's
[30:12] Clays GNA get his mouth shut with a
[30:15] broken jaw and a left
[30:18] hook and the next fight was
[30:22] against a boxer named Ken
[30:25] Norton who broke Muhammad Ali's jaw with
[30:28] a left
[30:30] hook amazing it was just amazing that he
[30:34] knew what they were talking about and
[30:36] amazing that he said even such a little
[30:38] thing as that he was still a prophet God
[30:41] bless you brother Ron if you
[30:43] come you're okay coming up here right
[30:47] you feel
[30:55] comfortable well I comp
[30:58] thought about maybe not doing this
[31:00] because I don't seem to be able to tell
[31:01] a short
[31:03] story but everything is
[31:05] connected
[31:07] and how I got to my recent testimony is
[31:12] so many other connected
[31:15] testimonies but
[31:17] uh here recently I had uh well I go in
[31:21] every year to get a u an x-ray of my
[31:24] kidneys because I'm prone to kidney
[31:25] stones I've had them wow I can't
[31:28] remember how many and operated it on two
[31:30] or three times
[31:32] and it's uh quite a
[31:36] trial but anyway my last x-ray my my
[31:40] cat's
[31:41] can uh the radiologist he reads the uh
[31:45] report and then he'll he'll call you and
[31:47] I'm from radl TD and how you doing make
[31:50] sure who a yard and he reads you the
[31:54] report and um
[31:58] so they said you know we uh we'd like to
[32:01] have
[32:03] another uh a special x-ray called the
[32:06] Pet Scan he said we've uh we noticed you
[32:08] have three small kidney stones on on
[32:10] your left side he said they're they're
[32:12] just very small he said they shouldn't
[32:15] be a problem for a long time but we
[32:18] found
[32:24] a a spec on your left
[32:33] lung and we want to look at it deeply we
[32:36] we want to uh inject a radioactive dye
[32:40] into your bloodstream and we want to
[32:42] look at it well I I my mother's had
[32:45] these these she's had part of her lung
[32:47] removed from lung
[32:50] cancer and you know
[32:53] you you look at others when they go
[32:56] through this and you go man why are they
[32:58] so afraid well you know why you say that
[33:00] because you never been through
[33:03] it and I'll tell you
[33:07] what the enemy comes to
[33:10] you and brother Bown talked about Satan
[33:13] talking to
[33:15] him and you know why we know he's
[33:18] talking because it's always negative
[33:20] it's always hurtful amen he always
[33:23] lies and if you have the Holy Spirit and
[33:26] I know I do I knew he was talking but
[33:29] you know I'm still in this carnal
[33:33] flesh okay let's do
[33:36] this so they made a schedule and I went
[33:39] down and had
[33:41] this terrible x-ray I I never thought of
[33:44] myself of being claustrophobic but I'm
[33:46] telling anybody that's been through this
[33:48] I'm very sympathetic to you now and they
[33:52] put me in there and because my arms were
[33:55] hanging over this little table that
[33:56] slides back and forth in the CAT scan I
[33:59] don't know if anybody's ever been in it
[34:01] but it's very
[34:02] intimidating well they put this Vel curl
[34:05] belt about this thick around my arms I
[34:07] couldn't
[34:08] move I had to lay still for 25
[34:12] minutes and I'm already
[34:16] anxious and I had a panic
[34:19] attack there you go here I go I've been
[34:21] critical of those of panic attack well I
[34:24] got a panic attack so if you have a pan
[34:27] attack I'm
[34:30] sympathetic and I just laid there and my
[34:33] I can't take this
[34:35] anymore but I remembered every time I've
[34:39] had a nightmare or been in trouble Lord
[34:41] Jesus help me with
[34:43] this and I'd have to
[34:46] say something happened to take the fear
[34:51] away something happened to take whatever
[34:54] situation I was in a way I I can't
[34:57] explain it but I know what
[34:58] happened and I open my
[35:03] eyes and something says you have to
[35:06] finish this you can't stop or you'll
[35:08] have to come and do it
[35:09] again
[35:11] oh
[35:13] okay
[35:16] anyway so we waited for the the
[35:19] radiologist they have a specialist that
[35:21] he reads these X-rays and he calls you
[35:24] personally I get the phone call my wifei
[35:27] the living room and I go Susie this is
[35:29] it so I put it on speaker phone and Mr
[35:32] glidewell I'm so and so and I've read
[35:35] your
[35:37] X-ray and he went on about we found the
[35:40] three little nodules of kidney stones he
[35:42] says there nothing to worry about said
[35:43] you should never have to worry about
[35:45] that and he said that uh little nodule
[35:50] in your lung he said it's uh 5.57 CM you
[35:53] know whatever he said it's rather small
[35:56] right now
[35:58] he says I guess you're wanting to hear
[36:00] this he goes uh don't worry it's not
[36:04] cancerous praise God thank God but I had
[36:07] went through the fear and this is the
[36:10] testimony to help you I'm not here
[36:13] really to talk about me I want you to if
[36:16] you go through this I I want to give you
[36:19] an experience that he's real he's there
[36:23] yes amen and
[36:25] that I told my wife I said you know
[36:28] mom's had this very same thing and I
[36:30] said now I'm so sympathetic to what she
[36:33] went
[36:34] through and she suffered so greatly
[36:37] she's cancer free
[36:39] now but she went through her time of
[36:43] troubles and I thought
[36:45] well I've been through a lot of other
[36:47] stuff I'm not going to really go through
[36:49] everything here and lay it out
[36:52] but I said you know Lord whatever it is
[36:55] I'm willing to go through it
[36:59] whatever is going to
[37:02] happen I know it's in your
[37:06] hands but I tell you what when he said
[37:09] there's no
[37:11] cancer my I'm glad I didn't have to go
[37:14] through
[37:15] that and everything I think we can find
[37:18] I know we can in the
[37:20] Bible one of the every situation you go
[37:23] through you can find another situation
[37:25] similar and it'll help
[37:28] you you remember the Apostle Paul he was
[37:31] always getting beaten and whipped and
[37:34] and hurt and lied on everywhere he went
[37:37] and yet he kept
[37:39] going and I remember this one place in
[37:42] the Bible where an angel says don't
[37:45] worry Paul they're not going to hurt you
[37:48] this place is going to be a place you
[37:49] can
[37:51] rest my how satisfying that was for him
[37:55] because it you know he he
[37:58] had been a witness against Christians
[38:01] and we know that his heart was to give
[38:04] us life you know and to prove himself
[38:07] but even that burden for Apostle Paul
[38:09] must have been
[38:10] great the Lord knew he couldn't take it
[38:13] again we're just human we can only take
[38:17] so much but you know he always makes a
[38:20] way for
[38:22] us my whole life has been like this I've
[38:26] learned everything the hard way I don't
[38:29] encourage you to do
[38:31] it my
[38:33] I've been with friends and they roll the
[38:36] car over
[38:38] and they were drunk and people were
[38:40] laying on top of me and the gasoline was
[38:42] the engine was still running and I
[38:45] thought well this is
[38:46] it somehow or another I got out of it
[38:51] I've been in truck accidents where I
[38:53] leave the truck over I I trained a
[38:55] driver and he went off the road and in
[38:56] West B
[38:58] Indiana we came to off the freeway and
[39:02] ended up in somebody's
[39:05] backyard but I'm still here amen thank
[39:08] God the kidney stones and when I was a
[39:12] young man we were we would go
[39:15] to haml park and find out where all the
[39:18] parties were and carry on and a man
[39:21] there they tried to arrest him and he
[39:23] had a semi-automatic 45 and he just
[39:27] started shooting randomly bullets were
[39:29] going
[39:31] everywhere none of them hit me it just
[39:34] goes on and on and on and on like
[39:38] this oh
[39:40] God what do you want me to
[39:44] do I've come so close to death I had
[39:47] sepsis I was in the hospital 5 days my
[39:50] left hand I got sepsis in it and it was
[39:52] rotting had a red line running all the
[39:54] way up my arm the doctor says you came
[39:57] this close to dying I said what do you
[39:59] mean he said you see that rotted hand he
[40:01] says if that septus would have got to
[40:03] your heart that's what your heart would
[40:04] have looked like
[40:07] my I was operated on
[40:11] twice I'm still
[40:14] here and I have to say that each time I
[40:17] recover I recover completely wow I see
[40:22] so many people that don't recover so
[40:24] well oh God
[40:27] when can I help in any way and that's
[40:31] that's my motive today amen because I
[40:34] was the child that I I failed into this
[40:37] class because I was so shy and so
[40:39] embarrassed and
[40:41] so I was ashamed of myself and I I
[40:43] wouldn't get up in front of the class or
[40:45] say a
[40:46] word and I would fail a class before I
[40:49] would do
[40:50] it so we don't know what we're going to
[40:53] be God does we say I'm not this I'm not
[40:58] that it really doesn't matter it's what
[41:01] God
[41:03] thinks and and we're here
[41:05] tonight and I believe that each and
[41:08] every one of us has a story and we're
[41:11] going to go through
[41:12] trials maybe this is to help you we're
[41:15] going through trials if you're a son and
[41:17] daughter of
[41:19] God and you haven't went through trials
[41:21] yet you're going to
[41:23] amen when I came back to the Lord and
[41:27] brought my wife with me and she was
[41:29] baptized and for a long time I heard the
[41:32] pastor talk about trials you know
[41:35] brother
[41:36] green I'm I wonder if I'm a Son of God
[41:39] or not I I I haven't seemed to go
[41:41] through trials oh
[41:44] my here they
[41:46] come had a wonderful job my wife didn't
[41:49] have to work the insurance paid for all
[41:51] three of our kids I had a pickup and I
[41:54] had a car and a four-wheel drive and we
[41:56] were buying a house and I got laid off
[41:58] and lost
[42:00] everything then I was helping my dad
[42:03] Landscape Maintenance got my first
[42:04] kidney stone attack spent three days in
[42:07] the
[42:10] hospital and you
[42:13] know I have I I
[42:16] believe that each one of my
[42:20] trials has been for a
[42:23] reason I was forced to get a new Prof
[42:26] passion I became a truck driver which I
[42:28] loved and I retired from that and I was
[42:31] just a natural I can stay up for days
[42:34] without sleep I can go and I just my I
[42:38] can endure pain like you've never known
[42:39] I I have no idea how I do it I can plan
[42:43] a trip remember I had a 10th grade 10th
[42:46] grade education I could plan a trip from
[42:48] Los Angeles New York and be there at the
[42:49] very
[42:51] minute I don't know how I do
[42:54] it but he's been so so merciful and kind
[42:57] to
[42:58] me and loving and I was persuaded that
[43:01] if I had to go through lung cancer I
[43:04] still love
[43:05] himen it's for a reason and a purpose
[43:08] but I'm sure glad he
[43:10] chose not to put me through that so I
[43:14] had so much more I could say but I just
[43:17] hope that that this helps you or our
[43:20] friend or someone you know going through
[43:21] because we're going to go through
[43:25] trials
[43:27] just one more little thing brother I was
[43:30] traveling in my my truck and I had
[43:32] loaded it the day before and I left
[43:34] Catalina and I went up Highway 79 goes
[43:37] through Florence and up through Florence
[43:38] Junction then up to Miami to the smelter
[43:41] and there's long stretches and I was
[43:44] just thinking about a sermon I'd heard
[43:45] and man I just I don't feel anything
[43:49] anybody you had that don't feel
[43:52] anything I think brother Brenham told
[43:54] brother idisco says brother Edie bisc
[43:57] was talking about how the Lord is with
[43:59] him he said well next time the Lord
[44:02] comes to you tell him I love him he said
[44:04] it's been a long time since I felt
[44:06] it so if you don't feel it that don't
[44:08] mean you're not a son or daughter of God
[44:11] keep keep moving
[44:13] forward that means that's
[44:16] nothing and I was just having these
[44:18] feelings of
[44:21] rejection unappreciated you know how
[44:24] that something says
[44:28] are you thankful for
[44:30] anything do you believe God speaks to
[44:34] us if we're
[44:38] listening and I thought to myself
[44:42] well yeah you sure gave me a good
[44:47] wife and she loves me I have three
[44:52] beautiful
[44:53] daughters after I was laid off at the
[44:56] Minds he gave me a job that I really
[44:57] like doing and I make more money and I I
[45:00] I'm I'm not beholding anybody and and it
[45:03] just kept going I started finding all
[45:05] these things that God had blessed me
[45:07] with
[45:09] amen and after a while I had my first
[45:12] real
[45:15] experience and that
[45:17] cab was so full of the presence of God I
[45:23] was scared to look at the seat maybe an
[45:25] angel was sitting next to me I was
[45:27] afraid
[45:29] yeah and I'm telling you the
[45:32] truth I said
[45:35] Lord if you're going to call me
[45:37] home I'll pull over right now and walk
[45:40] out in the
[45:42] desert something said not
[45:45] yet I said oh God you're so
[45:49] close I know of your love and in his
[45:53] presence I have to say he was is not
[45:57] judgmental he didn't bring up any of my
[46:00] faults he just loved me
[46:03] am I'm telling you the
[46:05] truth and I felt so condemned about
[46:08] those that I had held in contempt and
[46:14] my the life that I've lived and and how
[46:17] he's had to just beat me to get me to
[46:21] obey him and he loves me just
[46:23] unconditional it was just amazing
[46:27] I I can't explain
[46:29] it I thought if he if this voice said I
[46:32] would pull over well that would be it
[46:34] I'm I'm going ahead and and that's how
[46:36] close that presence was I was in his
[46:40] presence and he said
[46:43] no I said Lord I'm going to fail you
[46:45] again I always do I I can't I can't live
[46:50] it he said don't
[46:53] worry I'll come to you again
[46:58] that was
[47:01] it and I'll never forget that I've had
[47:04] other experiences but that one was just
[47:08] my you know if you've and when you tell
[47:10] somebody
[47:12] this I've learned that when I hear an
[47:14] experience of
[47:16] anyone I believe it you know why because
[47:19] I've had an
[47:20] experience if you want to believe what's
[47:23] being told over this
[47:24] pulpit ask the Lord say Lord I need an
[47:29] experience what we believe is not just
[47:32] words it is not just teaching it's an
[47:36] experience amen you must brother bam
[47:40] said you must meet the Piller of
[47:43] fire and I'll tell you what you'll not
[47:45] be the same it changes
[47:48] you I'm not the same person I was 10
[47:51] years ago I'm not the same person I was
[47:54] five years ago
[47:57] I have a long way to
[48:00] go but I believe that he has provided a
[48:03] way for me and each and every one of you
[48:06] that are one of
[48:08] his the opportunity that you have
[48:12] tonight to know the Lord Jesus Christ
[48:15] and to be with lovely people of like
[48:18] Precious Faith that's
[48:20] precious having the opportunity to
[48:24] praise him he's
[48:26] watching do it with a sincere
[48:30] heart whatever he tells you to do do it
[48:34] amen you know we're we're he's a leader
[48:37] but he's a leader of individual Brides
[48:39] of Christ we each and everyone have to
[48:42] have that individual connection with him
[48:47] you must know you must know what God
[48:49] wants you to do amen ask him he'll tell
[48:54] you wait for his answer well brother Ron
[48:58] I've been waiting a long
[49:01] time what are they what did Jesus tell
[49:04] Peter about going to the other room wait
[49:07] until that's what he said I think that
[49:10] that wait
[49:12] until in his due time he'll reveal
[49:16] himself to
[49:18] you he
[49:19] will I trust
[49:22] him I'd have to say that
[49:27] he's come to me so many times he is a
[49:30] friend so many have misunderstood what I
[49:34] was as a child and I was an odd
[49:39] child but I believe Christ has always
[49:42] been there I believe the Lord Jesus has
[49:45] always loved
[49:47] me and for each and every one of you you
[49:51] need
[49:52] this once you know that he loves you you
[49:56] and that you have a
[49:57] purpose it'll change your direction in
[50:00] your life it'll change your opinion of
[50:04] others and once we realize how
[50:07] insufficient we are and yet he would
[50:10] come to us and love us so much that we
[50:13] have an eternal place waiting for us
[50:17] amen that you will allow that for others
[50:20] also
[50:21] amen amen you know I just if you want to
[50:24] help somebody body don't remind them
[50:27] their faults so you know you're you're
[50:29] doing okay can I show you how to do this
[50:32] and uh you might have a little it might
[50:34] work out a little better for you you
[50:36] know just when you instruct somebody
[50:38] you're not doing that right what's wrong
[50:39] with you that doesn't do any
[50:42] good but I I brother green was I'd have
[50:46] to say that man knowing who I was came
[50:49] to the boy's prison where I was at for a
[50:53] year I've seen him be so rough and
[50:56] callous to people and I was embarrassed
[50:58] to be honest with you he could be that
[51:00] way you know he was never that way with
[51:04] me I asked him one day brother green why
[51:07] are you so nice to
[51:08] me he didn't say anything but I think he
[51:12] saw something in me I didn't
[51:15] see so don't give up on yourselves he
[51:19] loves you thank
[51:24] you
[51:32] the
[51:34] Lord has an appointed time for each of
[51:38] us we don't want to go before that time
[51:42] that he might have mercy on us and take
[51:44] us prematurely if we fall into
[51:47] sin but with brother Ron and the Lord
[51:51] taking care of
[51:53] him he has us on Earth
[51:56] Earth
[51:58] not just to be here for no reason he has
[52:02] each of us on Earth for a specific
[52:06] purpose that God has ordained before the
[52:09] foundation of the world and how many
[52:12] here want to fulfill that purpose in
[52:15] their lives amen I bless you uh Brother

[1:02:46] you appreciate brother
[1:02:50] Joe I'm not
[1:02:52] kidding sister milia you have a
[1:02:55] testimony is this okay to bring it to
[1:02:57] you would you rather be up here
[1:03:05] okay this is kind of embarrassing for me
[1:03:09] but it's my a part of my testimony it's
[1:03:18] been anyway it's been over 20 years
[1:03:21] ago I found myself in a back said
[1:03:25] condition and while I was out there I
[1:03:28] got cancer in my
[1:03:30] tongue and
[1:03:32] uh and uh anyway so I went to the doctor
[1:03:35] and uh they I went to the hospital and
[1:03:38] they took a piece of my tongue off where
[1:03:40] the cancer was and they opened up my
[1:03:43] glands on on my right side and had the
[1:03:46] cancer been there um they would have had
[1:03:49] to open up my vocal cords and though I
[1:03:53] don't say that I'm a great singer or
[1:03:55] anything but I've always liked to sing
[1:03:59] and um and but they didn't pling the
[1:04:02] cancer and my vocal
[1:04:04] cords anyway and so um it impaired my
[1:04:08] speech uh where before I used to speak
[1:04:11] English and Spanish very fluently and
[1:04:14] now well of course I can't roll my ARs
[1:04:17] and as a Spanish or Mexican person you
[1:04:20] got to roll your ARS anyway so um I
[1:04:24] thank God for that that um he healed me
[1:04:27] it's been over 15 years ago that um I've
[1:04:30] been cancer free and and though I like I
[1:04:34] said my speech is a little bit impaired
[1:04:37] but still I thank God for that and
[1:04:39] another thing that I couldn't say was
[1:04:41] the 's um after I had the surgery on my
[1:04:45] tongue but one night I had was having um
[1:04:48] I was still out in the world and I was
[1:04:51] having a nightmare and and in that
[1:04:54] nightmare I'll always remember that
[1:04:56] there was a dog chasing me and I
[1:04:59] couldn't get away from that dog and I I
[1:05:03] found myself saying Jesus Jesus and I
[1:05:07] woke up and and that was a turning point
[1:05:10] in my life I just want to share
[1:05:16] that appreciate sister
[1:05:19] Amelia not only is is she a faithful
[1:05:23] member of the church here but she has
[1:05:26] brought many many people to this church

[1:05:42] Sister Amelia
[1:05:44] wonderful brother
[1:05:47] Angel can you give me
[1:05:51] one all right do you want to you want to
[1:05:53] come up with in front of
[1:05:56] the all
[1:05:59] right in fact um this these ones
[1:06:03] happened here uh when I first came to
[1:06:05] the Lord we had
[1:06:07] um a stay in the upper room and uh all
[1:06:11] the gentlemen gathered for three days um
[1:06:14] I had been in a really bad accident and
[1:06:16] my back was really really bad I couldn't
[1:06:18] really move and stuff and I remember the
[1:06:20] brothers had um notic I wasn't really
[1:06:24] myself for two days and uh they laid
[1:06:27] their hands on me during a sermon and it
[1:06:29] was talking brother Brown was talking
[1:06:30] about just to believe she'd be healed
[1:06:33] and as brother Caleb was walking by he
[1:06:35] was going to lay his hand on other
[1:06:37] brother but for some reason he turned
[1:06:38] around and put his hands on me and at
[1:06:40] that moment um the pain in my back was
[1:06:43] gone completely I could move and
[1:06:45] everything and um they noticed I had a
[1:06:49] shock on my face and he asked me what
[1:06:51] was wrong and I said I said I didn't
[1:06:53] want to say nothing cuz I I didn't want
[1:06:54] to sound like I was complaining or
[1:06:55] crying about it but I had a really bad
[1:06:57] back I explained it I said but when you
[1:06:59] put your hands on me it was instantly
[1:07:01] gone so that was one that happened here
[1:07:04] the other one was when there was a they
[1:07:06] had a Easter Revival here and me and my
[1:07:09] family came up to ask for everybody come
[1:07:11] up and lay hands
[1:07:13] on and I had some thoughts in my mind
[1:07:16] and stuff and I remember I was in line
[1:07:18] and there was a a sister behind me
[1:07:20] holding her her little
[1:07:21] girl and um
[1:07:24] exactly right at this spot that's why I
[1:07:26] sat here but um this gush of wind just
[1:07:30] came through and it circled me and it
[1:07:32] just stayed there for a moment and it
[1:07:35] left and I was just like wow CU I've had
[1:07:38] that happen before and
[1:07:41] um I said Lord I thank you for that and
[1:07:44] um they laid their hands on me and I had
[1:07:45] a lot going on they pray for me and I
[1:07:46] went to go sit down and I remember I
[1:07:49] told my wife I said you're not going to
[1:07:50] believe what just happened to me right
[1:07:51] now and I told her
[1:07:55] and the brother on the stage started
[1:07:57] singing um I am the master of the
[1:08:01] wind so that was amazing that was an
[1:08:04] amazing
[1:08:05] night I tell that too and then this even
[1:08:09] continues further we my wife go home and
[1:08:12] we're excited okay we came for the
[1:08:14] Revival it was all three days and we
[1:08:15] were excited we were just amazed we're
[1:08:17] laying down and we're in a room and we
[1:08:20] live out um by the Desert Museum and um
[1:08:25] we started he singing in the
[1:08:27] room and me and my wife we look at other
[1:08:30] like do you hear that she's like yeah I
[1:08:31] hear that and so I get up CU I thought
[1:08:33] maybe the kids listen some music I was
[1:08:35] going to tell them to lower it or so I'm
[1:08:37] going walk around the house there's
[1:08:38] everyone's asleep so I walk back in the
[1:08:41] room and we're still hearing it so I
[1:08:43] tell her what are you hearing and she
[1:08:45] says I'm hearing like this High just
[1:08:48] beautiful voice singing like
[1:08:50] Hallelujah and I was hearing the same
[1:08:52] thing as well

[1:15:40] Jeffersonville and uh she's uh
[1:15:44] absolutely a precious
[1:15:47] person
[1:15:50] um I'll just read
[1:15:53] her
[1:15:56] testimony I was born one of eight
[1:15:59] siblings in a poverty stricken
[1:16:03] family my father was a hard worker with
[1:16:05] a bad temper he worked but squandered
[1:16:08] his money and oftentimes neglected to
[1:16:12] provide even the Bare
[1:16:13] Essentials we were not sent to school
[1:16:16] but kept at home not educated there
[1:16:20] either I believe I remember right as I
[1:16:23] think
[1:16:23] this sister's from
[1:16:28] Missouri we lived a very secluded we
[1:16:31] lived very
[1:16:33] secluded my dad beat my
[1:16:36] mom and us kids as far back as I can
[1:16:39] remember my mother understandably stayed
[1:16:42] depressed and
[1:16:44] withdrawn at one point my whole head was
[1:16:48] matted in helmet of in a helmet of
[1:16:52] Tangles just completely stuck to my head
[1:16:55] my siblings and I dug in
[1:16:58] dumpsters and were called mean names by
[1:17:01] The Neighborhood kids I was often sad
[1:17:04] about my mom and angry at my
[1:17:08] dad by the time I was
[1:17:10] pre-teen I was headed down a road sure
[1:17:15] to end in my
[1:17:18] destruction one night while my family
[1:17:22] while a family m house I overdosed and
[1:17:24] attempted to just fall asleep
[1:17:26] forever I took a bottle of pills and
[1:17:30] drank a bottle of prescription cough
[1:17:32] syrup that made you sleepy a sibling
[1:17:35] found me on the floor and I was taken to
[1:17:36] the hospital and my stomach pumped I
[1:17:39] spent time in two Mental Hospitals and
[1:17:42] ran away from home I was eventually
[1:17:44] removed from the home and placed in a
[1:17:46] group of Home in a group home for kids I
[1:17:49] lost every person I'd ever
[1:17:52] known
[1:17:53] this made me feel like I was even more
[1:17:58] worthless at this time she was about the
[1:18:02] age of of you young young
[1:18:07] sisters I was beyond
[1:18:09] angry I had no desire to live because I
[1:18:12] had already learned life was way too
[1:18:17] difficult what really complicated
[1:18:20] matters was that my father was a very
[1:18:22] religious
[1:18:25] man he could quote the Bible front and
[1:18:28] back this made me angry with
[1:18:31] God I was very angry and decided God
[1:18:35] must hate me to allow these things to
[1:18:38] happen to me and my mom and my
[1:18:42] siblings I thought that all men who
[1:18:44] claim to be Christians dominated and
[1:18:48] beat their
[1:18:50] wives then I decided that there was no
[1:18:53] God at
[1:18:55] all I carried a lot of pain and soon
[1:18:58] discovered the only escape from it was
[1:19:01] sin in my early 20s I married a man who
[1:19:04] shared shared many qualities of my
[1:19:06] father it happens
[1:19:09] often I was married a short time and
[1:19:13] then divorced
[1:19:14] him I lived in
[1:19:16] Sin from that point
[1:19:20] on well she didn't say here in her
[1:19:22] testimony
[1:19:23] that I know from her is she began living
[1:19:26] a homosexual lifestyle
[1:19:28] also I continued self-medicating through
[1:19:31] my 20s and into my 30s no matter what I
[1:19:33] tried nothing made any of it make sense
[1:19:36] to me I started truly giving up on
[1:19:39] myself I still carried
[1:19:42] around I still carried around the way I
[1:19:45] felt all of those years as a child and
[1:19:47] then as a teen feeling like I was
[1:19:51] unloved
[1:19:53] now it was all just covered with years
[1:19:56] of drug abuse and poor
[1:19:59] choices I felt like the only one I could
[1:20:03] count on was
[1:20:06] myself and I was
[1:20:08] worthless I felt hopeless and like there
[1:20:11] was no point in
[1:20:14] living I lived in a
[1:20:16] tent and went through deep a deep
[1:20:21] depression I do not possess words to
[1:20:23] describe how close to death I
[1:20:27] lived it was then that God started
[1:20:31] dealing with me i' would like to say
[1:20:33] that I submitted right away but I
[1:20:37] ran one day I was deeply troubled and I
[1:20:41] was crying I cried out loud why can't I
[1:20:44] just be
[1:20:46] happy then just as sure as I am typing
[1:20:50] this right now I felt something inside
[1:20:52] of me say you will never be happy living
[1:20:55] this way because I did not make you to
[1:20:57] live this
[1:20:59] way it was not an audible voice but it
[1:21:03] was a
[1:21:04] voice I cannot explain it but it is
[1:21:07] still just as real to me right now as it
[1:21:10] was then I
[1:21:12] knew that was
[1:21:16] God for the very first time in my life I
[1:21:19] saw just how filthy my sins were
[1:21:24] I realized how desperately I needed God
[1:21:27] and I knew he was not at all the god I
[1:21:30] grew up thinking existed and then
[1:21:34] denied I still did not understand him
[1:21:39] but I knew I needed
[1:21:41] him I needed him more than I had ever
[1:21:44] needed anything or
[1:21:47] anyone I did not know what to
[1:21:50] do I was Restless I started trying to
[1:21:53] bargain with God it was very hard to let
[1:21:56] go of that control he continued dealing
[1:21:58] with me years ago my dad had told me
[1:22:01] that God did not hear my
[1:22:03] prayers I'll tell you why he said his
[1:22:08] dad said her dad said that
[1:22:13] well well soon you know it's because she
[1:22:15] had short
[1:22:18] hair years ago my dad had told me that
[1:22:21] God did not hear my prayers so I stopped
[1:22:23] praying in my teens because I had
[1:22:25] believed him I told God that I would
[1:22:28] refrain from my sins but I would not be
[1:22:31] a hypocrite and go to
[1:22:34] church God had different plans for
[1:22:38] me a young sister was attending a
[1:22:42] funeral for someone who had gone to her
[1:22:45] church so I drove her
[1:22:48] there I'm sorry a younger sister this
[1:22:52] girl girl's younger sister so I drove
[1:22:54] her there I stood in the back of the
[1:22:56] funeral par parlor parlor and folded my
[1:22:59] arms I looked at it looked at everyone
[1:23:01] with their long dresses and their long
[1:23:04] hair and I decided that they were all
[1:23:06] judging
[1:23:08] me the devil was really fighting for my
[1:23:12] soul I had stood there and nearly
[1:23:15] convinced myself that this was a bad
[1:23:18] decision being there in that
[1:23:21] place
[1:23:24] when this man standing beside
[1:23:28] me moved to the side to let someone pass
[1:23:34] and he said excuse me sister to
[1:23:42] me it was as it was as if he did not see
[1:23:47] my hair was at best best an inch
[1:23:51] long or that I I wore pants and
[1:23:55] makeup his kindness to me made me have
[1:23:58] to
[1:23:59] admit he had something I
[1:24:03] wanted he had God's love in his
[1:24:07] heart it's softened my spirit enough
[1:24:10] that I listened to what the preacher was
[1:24:11] saying and he was saying some hard
[1:24:14] things but I felt like the things he was
[1:24:17] saying were
[1:24:19] true I went to church with my sister for
[1:24:22] a few weeks I said okay I will go but I
[1:24:25] don't believe God cares what I wear so
[1:24:28] I'm going to wear
[1:24:29] pants and I
[1:24:31] did at the time I didn't even own a
[1:24:34] skirt one day the preacher spoke on the
[1:24:37] chastisement of our peace it was as if
[1:24:40] he was talking directly to me when he
[1:24:43] gave an altar call I could not get to
[1:24:45] the altar fast enough it was as if
[1:24:48] something carried me there I cried and I
[1:24:51] cried but this was not like any other
[1:24:54] time I had cried I was pouring it all
[1:24:56] out to God when I stood up from the
[1:24:58] altar I was a different woman I could
[1:25:02] not wait to get home and get the pants
[1:25:04] out of my
[1:25:06] house I went home and got rid of
[1:25:08] everything I thought was displeasing to
[1:25:10] the Lord I threw away a lot of things
[1:25:12] and I was happy about it I went back to
[1:25:14] work that Monday and my boss asked me if
[1:25:16] I was on
[1:25:20] drugs she was on the thing that these
[1:25:22] drugs are trying to
[1:25:25] impersonate for the first time in a long
[1:25:28] time I was not on
[1:25:34] drugs he told me I lost my Edge and I
[1:25:39] looked washed up without the makeup on
[1:25:42] and my hair not
[1:25:44] spiked he asked me who told me it was
[1:25:47] wrong to spike my hair and I told them
[1:25:49] nobody told me that it was wrong I just
[1:25:51] felt it was wrong belong to
[1:25:56] me he laughed at
[1:25:59] me I was happy though I didn't even care
[1:26:02] what he
[1:26:03] thought I left his office and prayed for
[1:26:09] him I would sit in my vehicle on my
[1:26:12] lunch break and wait for people to come
[1:26:15] out of the store then I would put away
[1:26:17] their buggy just to have an excuse to
[1:26:20] say God bless you to them
[1:26:24] I wanted to tell absolutely everyone
[1:26:27] what the Lord had done for me it made my
[1:26:29] heart turn hurt that people did not know
[1:26:33] God three years
[1:26:36] later I fought a lot of
[1:26:39] battles I have won some and I've lost
[1:26:42] some I learned from each one to depend
[1:26:45] on God I used to be angry about my
[1:26:50] upbringing but I look back now now and I
[1:26:53] see the hand of God in my life all
[1:27:01] along so many things I did not
[1:27:05] understand were the very things that
[1:27:07] brought me to where I needed to be I
[1:27:10] have learned the exact opposite of what
[1:27:13] I was so certain was true before I met
[1:27:17] him I am not the only one I can count on
[1:27:21] when I try to go it alone I mess it up
[1:27:24] but when I lean on him I feel peace I
[1:27:27] have never felt before the world has
[1:27:31] absolutely nothing for me there is
[1:27:34] nothing but heartache and pain out there
[1:27:36] but in him only I find peace that no
[1:27:40] drug could ever
[1:27:43] produce every day I'm amazed at his love
[1:27:46] for me even though I Am So
[1:27:49] Unworthy when I look around and see how
[1:27:52] strong so many of the spirits I was
[1:27:54] bound by our I know it was nothing short
[1:27:57] of his amazing grace that Set Me Free I
[1:28:01] thank the Lord for saving my soul and
[1:28:04] revealing to me the Elijah of this
[1:28:07] age as the song beautifully states he
[1:28:11] knew me yet he loved me amen friends do

[1:31:10] testimony and that is that I was young
[1:31:14] and now I'm old but I've never
[1:31:17] experienced the Lord forsaking me ever
[1:31:19] amen that I want everybody to know that
[1:31:23] any drop of good is something that the
[1:31:27] Lord has done and that he is faithful
[1:31:30] and you don't want to go anywhere else
[1:31:32] but with Jesus he is precious he's
[1:31:35] wonderful he's sweet he's kind he's
[1:31:39] thoughtful I mean he's wonderful and
[1:31:42] sometimes I think there just isn't
[1:31:44] enough adjectives in English so I try in
[1:31:46] Spanish
[1:31:48] Maro es spectacular whatever and then
[1:31:52] let try a little bit of Hebrew you know
[1:31:54] but the thing is he is so
[1:31:57] precious that he I'm just telling you
[1:32:00] don't go any other
[1:32:02] way he is
[1:32:06] marvelous this morning after service I
[1:32:09] was in the parking lot there talking a
[1:32:11] bit with brother Roman so glad that he's
[1:32:13] not in a wheelchair and on crutches and
[1:32:16] that's when I I don't know if that's
[1:32:18] when I thought about this song but I
[1:32:20] it's connected
[1:32:23] I search and I search for the road that
[1:32:27] leads to Glory I wondered if I'd ever
[1:32:32] find the
[1:32:35] way I sat down to rest for the feet had
[1:32:40] grown so weary and then I Heard a Voice
[1:32:45] Within Me
[1:32:47] say you've got to keep on walking just
[1:32:53] keep right on
[1:32:55] walking walking in the light of the
[1:33:00] Lord you'll get to Heaven someday if you
[1:33:06] walk the right way walking in the light
[1:33:11] of the
[1:33:14] Lord I prayed and I prayed for the Lord
[1:33:19] to give me mercy
[1:33:22] I pray for him to brighten up my
[1:33:28] way I was so
[1:33:31] afraid for the road became so lonely and
[1:33:36] then I Heard a Voice Within Me
[1:33:41] say you've got to keep on walking just
[1:33:47] keep right on
[1:33:49] walking walking in the light of the
[1:33:54] Lord you'll get to Heaven someday if you
[1:34:00] walk the right way walking in the light
[1:34:06] of the
[1:34:08] Lord Brother randam was in Memphis
[1:34:11] Tennessee and he says he says uh I I got
[1:34:15] out and started down the street trying
[1:34:17] to find the post office I was walking
[1:34:19] down the street singing that little
[1:34:21] Pentecostal song telling now both far
[1:34:24] and wide his power is yet the same I'm
[1:34:26] so glad I can say I'm one of them and
[1:34:30] and going singing that little song after
[1:34:32] a while I felt something
[1:34:35] going got close I stepped back up behind
[1:34:39] a great big column there I said Heavenly
[1:34:42] Father what would you have your servant
[1:34:44] do it kept
[1:34:46] going I was real still a minute and I
[1:34:49] heard a deep voice say go turn back well
[1:34:53] I turned and I went walking back down
[1:34:56] the street I walked and I walked on past
[1:34:59] the hotel and down through South Memphis
[1:35:01] just walking on and on the sun was way
[1:35:04] high then the sun was up it was a
[1:35:06] beautiful spring morning the fragrance
[1:35:08] of the flowers in the air had perfumed
[1:35:09] the air I thought how beautiful was
[1:35:11] going along that I thought Lord I don't
[1:35:13] know you said walk here I am I'm walking
[1:35:17] I just kept on walking walking walking
[1:35:22] you've got to keep on walking just keep
[1:35:27] right on
[1:35:29] walking walking in the light of the
[1:35:34] Lord you'll get to Heaven someday if you
[1:35:40] walk the right way walking in the light
[1:35:46] of the
[1:35:50] Lord
[1:36:11] I'm gonna
[1:36:12] have we got to close with that
[1:36:16] song all right who has a
[1:36:19] testimony sister
[1:36:28] hi good evening um
[1:36:31] so was debating if I should um share
[1:36:35] this I try not to make it too long
[1:36:37] but so uh
[1:36:40] 2020 um was a hard year for everybody uh
[1:36:45] lot of
[1:36:46] people um went with the Lord a lot of
[1:36:50] losses um
[1:36:52] uh lost my sister in
[1:36:55] 2020 was one of the big
[1:36:59] losses we had in our
[1:37:02] family she was my best
[1:37:04] friend so that really hurt um I thank
[1:37:08] the Lord that well she she battled
[1:37:12] addiction and
[1:37:14] uh um for many years I um and I was
[1:37:18] sharing this testimony with sister
[1:37:20] Jessica
[1:37:22] uh last week um so for many years she
[1:37:25] struggled with addiction
[1:37:27] and I uh I
[1:37:30] always seem to find the strength to uh
[1:37:35] to chase her down and try to help her um
[1:37:39] my husband and I at the
[1:37:41] time um we had just gotten
[1:37:44] married and he was working uh long hours
[1:37:48] and when he would come home I I would
[1:37:51] get calls from my sister and she was
[1:37:54] always like out in the streets or
[1:37:57] something was going on with her and and
[1:38:00] I would wake him up and I would tell him
[1:38:01] she needs our help and we would get up
[1:38:04] 3:00 4 in the morning sometimes and uh
[1:38:08] go pick her
[1:38:09] up after a while I questioned myself why
[1:38:14] I kept doing
[1:38:16] this and
[1:38:19] um it wasn't until she passed away I
[1:38:22] realized that it was the
[1:38:24] Lord so um as years went on WE
[1:38:28] ministered to her we even brought her to
[1:38:31] church one time when we used to go over
[1:38:34] to brother
[1:38:35] Baker's um or was it here um sorry it
[1:38:40] was here we brought her
[1:38:42] here and she um she accepted the message
[1:38:46] right
[1:38:47] away um she had not yet fully
[1:38:49] surrendered to God but I knew was coming
[1:38:53] I just couldn't give up on
[1:38:54] her so
[1:38:58] um in 2019 we had a really bad car
[1:39:02] accident uh we
[1:39:07] almost we almost died uh we had a really
[1:39:10] bad rollover she showed up at the scene
[1:39:14] after it happened all of us were going
[1:39:17] to go we were going into different
[1:39:19] ambulances to the hospital Hospital
[1:39:21] which we were called like the miraco
[1:39:23] family because we I didn't even have my
[1:39:25] seat belt on so I remember her saying to
[1:39:29] me at later that
[1:39:33] day I can't lose you
[1:39:35] guys I prayed that night and this is
[1:39:38] what she told me she told the Lord
[1:39:42] that to spare us
[1:39:45] and to take her
[1:39:49] instead because we have had so many
[1:39:52] children and so much to live for
[1:39:56] here so as time went
[1:39:59] on
[1:40:01] uh my sister my my other sister had
[1:40:04] taken her on a retreat uh to study about
[1:40:07] Ruth and
[1:40:10] uh she called me from there she couldn't
[1:40:13] wait to share the news with me and she
[1:40:16] called me and she said um I gave my life
[1:40:18] to the
[1:40:19] Lord and I was just I just started
[1:40:23] crying and
[1:40:25] um that's when she officially became
[1:40:28] sober and she stayed
[1:40:32] sober uh 2020 came she got
[1:40:36] sick so everybody was really scared of
[1:40:39] covid so we kind of isolated and well we
[1:40:43] were all
[1:40:44] quarantined but she had her own little
[1:40:46] place there and we couldn't really see
[1:40:48] her because she was sick but she didn't
[1:40:51] really get sick she just kind of lost
[1:40:52] her smell and her taste
[1:40:56] so the last time I seen her
[1:41:00] um I took her some food and left it at
[1:41:03] the
[1:41:05] gate and I remember the last thing she'
[1:41:07] told me
[1:41:08] was I wish I could just hug
[1:41:11] you and we kind of just touched fingers
[1:41:14] through the
[1:41:15] gate we had attachment
[1:41:18] issues we had to always be together
[1:41:26] that week she was supposed to go to her
[1:41:27] house and she wasn't
[1:41:30] answering and uh we knew something was
[1:41:33] wrong so I constantly called her she
[1:41:37] didn't answer so then we all decided to
[1:41:40] go to her
[1:41:41] house which
[1:41:44] um we found her in her apartment she had
[1:41:48] passed
[1:41:49] away
[1:41:51] um at first we didn't know what happened
[1:41:54] I I I couldn't understand I thought she
[1:41:57] went back to to um heroin but um my
[1:42:01] daughter Serenity found her
[1:42:03] phone and then we investigated what
[1:42:06] happened a friend gave her a a pill for
[1:42:11] her back pain which was clarified on the
[1:42:14] text message that she was hurting and
[1:42:17] she wanted something to uh help her back
[1:42:20] so so end up being
[1:42:23] fental
[1:42:26] um the reason I'm sharing this is
[1:42:30] because I think that I've been since
[1:42:34] that year I've been very
[1:42:38] angry and even though I've had a
[1:42:41] thousand conversations with the Lord
[1:42:44] I've been feeling out of
[1:42:46] place but I remember one thing that the
[1:42:50] Lord told me that that helped me a
[1:42:54] lot I was sitting in my uh in my room
[1:42:57] one day crying for her and I was angry
[1:43:01] at
[1:43:02] him and I told him why' you take her
[1:43:05] from
[1:43:06] me I spent years chasing her down for
[1:43:09] you and you told me to do this you told
[1:43:13] me don't give up on her just keep
[1:43:15] going just keep showing her
[1:43:19] love and I
[1:43:22] did and as uh years went on I was
[1:43:25] exhausted but I did it for
[1:43:28] you and all you gave me was 15 months of
[1:43:32] her sober to get to know who she really
[1:43:36] really was outside of the
[1:43:39] drugs and I told her why did you why did
[1:43:42] you just give me 15 months after I did
[1:43:45] this for you for so many
[1:43:47] years and I remember just crying and I
[1:43:50] was kneel down by my
[1:43:53] window and I heard the Lord speak to me
[1:43:56] and he said uh you're right I did ask
[1:43:59] you to do all this I had you chase her I
[1:44:01] had
[1:44:02] you take her to rehab all these things
[1:44:06] when and I gave you the strength to do
[1:44:09] that but you tell me you're wrong about
[1:44:11] one
[1:44:12] thing I didn't give you 15 months with
[1:44:15] her amen because you did all this I gave
[1:44:18] her to you for eternity yes amen
[1:44:21] [Applause]
[1:44:28] and so as um we had a lot of losses
[1:44:32] after that my father-in-law passed away
[1:44:35] the next year after
[1:44:38] that and then my my sister's husband
[1:44:41] when my brother-in-law passed away after
[1:44:45] that and then in January of
[1:44:49] 2022 I thought I was next cuz I was in
[1:44:52] the hospital for a
[1:44:54] month I had got diagnosed with
[1:44:57] diverticulitis
[1:44:59] and my husband was like New
[1:45:04] Year someone else we would seem to have
[1:45:07] been losing somebody every
[1:45:10] year um my surgeon was um a very good
[1:45:15] surgeon but she was not compassionate at
[1:45:17] all basically told me my infection was
[1:45:20] too bad I probably wasn't going to
[1:45:22] survive so she
[1:45:25] uh you know we went through the process
[1:45:29] of just what was probably going to
[1:45:32] happen I was if I did wake up which was
[1:45:34] very slim I was going to end up in ICU
[1:45:37] um at that time they weren't really
[1:45:39] allowing people in the hospital still so
[1:45:41] I they gave the exception of all my kids
[1:45:43] coming and say by to me which I didn't
[1:45:47] accept um but I just wanted to see them
[1:45:49] before Sur
[1:45:51] surgery so um we talked and everything
[1:45:54] and I had a church is praying for me um
[1:45:58] I remember people reaching out to me
[1:46:00] telling me that they were praying for me
[1:46:04] and and so uh I went into
[1:46:07] surgery uh she said well you know you
[1:46:10] Pro it's probably going to take a while
[1:46:12] couple hours to wake up you know I it's
[1:46:15] really bad and she just basically I felt
[1:46:19] like that she had no hope hope for me
[1:46:21] and I told her why I have people praying
[1:46:23] for
[1:46:24] me so uh we had
[1:46:27] surgery 5 minutes after surgery I woke
[1:46:31] up and I can actually feel things being
[1:46:34] taken out of my
[1:46:36] throat I think uh the Lord allowed that
[1:46:39] to prove to me that he's more powerful
[1:46:42] than what surgeon was telling me and all
[1:46:46] her
[1:46:47] experience
[1:46:49] um so then at that same week there was
[1:46:53] kind of a little complication where they
[1:46:56] were draining the app the infection in
[1:46:58] my stomach and I had come
[1:47:01] out and uh I had to go back into surgery
[1:47:05] I told my husband the enem is after
[1:47:08] me I need you to go to the Tabernacle
[1:47:11] and get me some prayer
[1:47:13] cloths so he did I don't know who he
[1:47:15] spoke with but he came back gave me a
[1:47:20] prayer ha
[1:47:21] cloth and I said I'm taking this in
[1:47:23] surgery with
[1:47:25] me they didn't let me pin it on my
[1:47:27] clothes because it was the safety pin
[1:47:30] was metal so I had my hair in a bun and
[1:47:34] I stuck it in my my hair I said this is
[1:47:37] going with
[1:47:39] me it was one of the most terrifying
[1:47:42] things I ever
[1:47:45] experienced but the Lord reminded me
[1:47:47] that it
[1:47:49] wasn't it wasn't one of the most painful
[1:47:52] things I've ever experienced because no
[1:47:54] matter how painful how much pain I was
[1:47:59] in I knew what pain was losing someone I
[1:48:05] loved so I woke up again I'm
[1:48:10] here and I just remember God telling me
[1:48:14] right before that second time of surgery
[1:48:16] he
[1:48:17] said do you want to be with your sister
[1:48:20] do you want to see her and I was
[1:48:25] so not confused I was just
[1:48:29] like what do I want to
[1:48:31] do and I felt so selfish thinking that
[1:48:34] because I have a whole family
[1:48:38] here and the Lord
[1:48:40] knew how much I loved my
[1:48:44] sister I said Lord I'm not ready to go
[1:48:48] I'm not ready at all I'm not scared but
[1:48:51] I'm not ready to leave my family please
[1:48:54] don't take
[1:48:56] me and the Lord told me good because I
[1:48:58] wasn't going
[1:49:01] to you just needed to know
[1:49:06] that a lot of other things happened I
[1:49:08] felt like my brother Ron was saying um
[1:49:11] just trials after
[1:49:15] trials even my daughter left home she my
[1:49:18] oldest which we're still praying for to
[1:49:20] come
[1:49:21] back a lot of things that our family
[1:49:24] went through really uh hurt her a lot
[1:49:27] and I think she couldn't handle it
[1:49:31] so my point of all this
[1:49:36] is this whole time I just still I've
[1:49:39] been felt so
[1:49:41] like I guess a little
[1:49:44] lost just with all the losses and the
[1:49:49] trials
[1:49:51] so that's when
[1:49:52] I I reached out to you brother
[1:49:58] Daniel and I called you and I couldn't
[1:50:01] remember who you were but you had
[1:50:03] visited my church when I used to go over
[1:50:06] brother Bennett and then I remembered
[1:50:07] after I seen
[1:50:09] you but when you invited us
[1:50:16] over and you fed our
[1:50:19] family
[1:50:21] you showed us such love I
[1:50:24] knew this was where we had to
[1:50:28] be and that's when I felt God's love
[1:50:32] again and then I remember the first day
[1:50:35] we got here my husband and I went into
[1:50:39] the little back room here with the big
[1:50:42] Bibles and we just cried and I told him
[1:50:46] what do you feel and he said I feel like
[1:50:49] I'm
[1:50:52] home and so that's my
[1:50:56] [Applause]
[1:51:04] testimony
[1:51:06] um I just wanted to I guess remind
[1:51:09] everybody in here just to I don't know
[1:51:11] if you you know all of my history I just
[1:51:14] came back
[1:51:18] oh my name is
[1:51:20] record and I just came back to the Lord
[1:51:23] not too long
[1:51:24] ago and um to uh to put it bluntly it's
[1:51:30] not been the easiest thing it's been
[1:51:32] kind of
[1:51:33] hard
[1:51:35] but at the same time it's been glorious
[1:51:40] too because
[1:51:42] um you know I can
[1:51:46] uh I can really say I feel like I'm
[1:51:48] trying this time
[1:51:51] before I I not not on purpose or
[1:51:54] anything but I think I left a lot of
[1:51:56] things
[1:51:56] out um and even now I blow it all the
[1:52:00] time I screw up I do
[1:52:03] that but God's been merciful to
[1:52:08] me and uh he's showed me a lot of things
[1:52:12] and and he's been there for me like in a
[1:52:16] way I didn't know he was
[1:52:18] before and
[1:52:22] um uh years
[1:52:26] ago I I used to have a a tape player
[1:52:29] that I I would put in my my word vehicle
[1:52:35] I'd play brother brandom's tapes on
[1:52:37] it and
[1:52:40] um uh I was driving one day and I was
[1:52:43] kind of keeping my eye up front and then
[1:52:45] I kind of look down at my map and then
[1:52:48] up front again and then down at my map
[1:52:50] and then oh wow here comes a car you
[1:52:53] know sort of a thing
[1:52:55] and boom I hit it I said oh no what am I
[1:52:59] going to do they're going to fire me now
[1:53:01] and everything
[1:53:03] else and so and when I hit this
[1:53:07] guy I hit him his car went into a
[1:53:10] telephone pole and then that wire you
[1:53:13] know that's on telephone poles came off
[1:53:16] and smacked the guy in the arm pow
[1:53:20] I said oh man this guy's gonna he's
[1:53:24] going to sue me but uh anyways
[1:53:28] um he uh he got out of the car I said
[1:53:31] you all right he said yeah man the thing
[1:53:33] just hit me in my
[1:53:34] arm I said uh well I'm really sorry uh
[1:53:39] he said well just pull over here and we
[1:53:41] pulled over and
[1:53:43] um he said I'll tell you
[1:53:46] what uh we don't have to go to to the go
[1:53:50] through the insurance if you don't want
[1:53:51] to you can just give me a couple hundred
[1:53:53] bucks for the bumper and and I'll fix it
[1:53:56] myself I said whoa uh okay yeah that
[1:54:01] sounds
[1:54:02] fine and um I shook the guy's hand he's
[1:54:07] he was actually a Christian man I shook
[1:54:09] the guy's hand I hopped back in my
[1:54:11] truck and it was really funny I was just
[1:54:13] driving down the street you know
[1:54:15] thanking my lucky stars and the tape
[1:54:17] player was right here
[1:54:20] just uh as as we were driving it was
[1:54:22] like it was like it was pushing me like
[1:54:24] hey push play and so I
[1:54:28] did
[1:54:30] and brother brandham
[1:54:33] said you know sometimes the Lord will
[1:54:36] get you into something just to show you
[1:54:38] he can get you out of it that's good
[1:54:41] amen so that's that's my testimony
[1:54:44] sometimes God will get you into
[1:54:45] something just so he can get you out of
[1:54:47] it amen God bless you guys
[1:54:52] this this guy this guy and me were old
[1:54:55] friends and when I moved from
[1:54:57] Jeffersonville my family can testify of
[1:55:00] this when I moved from Jeffersonville
[1:55:02] there was one person that was really
[1:55:05] really strong in my heart I called um my
[1:55:10] brother-in-law David Carroll and I said
[1:55:12] hey you got Heath's number he gave me a
[1:55:14] number it didn't work and um so then we
[1:55:19] go to brother Po's Church brother po
[1:55:21] invites me to preach one I believe is a
[1:55:23] Sunday night and this guy shows up how
[1:55:27] long it it been since you've been to
[1:55:30] church yeah long time and he just
[1:55:32] happens to show up now we're together
[1:55:36] again real quick we have a couple more
[1:55:38] minutes if somebody else want to show s
[1:55:40] um share a short testimony I get to
[1:55:44] brother
[1:55:48] Rome
[1:55:51] it seemed like a lot of the service
[1:55:53] about MRIs and I want to tell you a
[1:55:55] couple stories about some MRIs that I've
[1:55:58] had I had one in the Oral Valley
[1:56:00] hospital and when I come out uh I asked
[1:56:02] the girl if she knew Jesus she said no I
[1:56:05] said well you you or him one just healed
[1:56:06] me I'm all better and uh so I went back
[1:56:10] to my room and got dressed and
[1:56:12] uh the doctor came in want to give me
[1:56:15] some more tests and I said no I'm
[1:56:16] dressing I'm going home so she signed me
[1:56:19] out and released me I never to find out
[1:56:20] what my problem was but I was
[1:56:22] healed uh 2 weeks ago our 63rd
[1:56:26] anniversary we was November 27th and I
[1:56:29] woke up and I told her we was going to
[1:56:32] go shopping but I didn't feel good so we
[1:56:35] went to the VA first where we were there
[1:56:37] eight
[1:56:38] hours I had two
[1:56:42] MRIs an IV blood pressure checked every
[1:56:47] hour uh what else have
[1:56:50] x-ray uh CT scans whatever they could
[1:56:53] give me they gave me and uh they I came
[1:56:56] out with some vertigo pills well I got a
[1:57:00] call day or two ago they said to come in
[1:57:03] Monday morning they found something on
[1:57:06] my aorta in my neck so I got to go in
[1:57:10] for a consultation tomorrow they said I
[1:57:12] might have to have another MRI so I'd
[1:57:15] like for you all to pray for me that
[1:57:17] they won't find anything that if I have
[1:57:19] to have another
[1:57:21] MRI that that's my testimony and request
[1:57:24] thank you
[1:57:28] amen I think there was there was one
[1:57:31] over here sister s Sister
[1:57:34] Sarah you're busted because you didn't
[1:57:38] sing I didn't know you were
[1:57:41] coming God bless you um as many of you
[1:57:45] know we put it in a prayer request the
[1:57:46] other day hopefully you can make this
[1:57:48] quick but there's a testim Tony I have
[1:57:49] never shared and I hope this is
[1:57:52] encouragement and I think I can Echo
[1:57:53] some of the sentiments that are said
[1:57:55] here tonight we say testimonies because
[1:57:57] these are the things that remind us God
[1:57:58] is present it's also something where we
[1:58:01] can look at each other's lives we think
[1:58:02] we're the only ones going through
[1:58:04] something sometimes and it feels like
[1:58:06] the you know the sky is closing in it's
[1:58:08] Darkness you don't see your way through
[1:58:09] you feel very very isolated very alone
[1:58:12] but you're not and when you hear
[1:58:14] testimonies like this this is when it
[1:58:16] makes you know hey I've been there
[1:58:18] before I also have eye
[1:58:20] stories and I was thinking I hear what
[1:58:23] brother uh brother glod was saying I
[1:58:27] definitely had an incident where I was
[1:58:29] trying not to panic as I have
[1:58:30] claustrophobia you know so I the MRI
[1:58:33] machine is an inch from my nose and I'm
[1:58:35] strapped down in that chair I had
[1:58:36] Belle's paly I could not move my face
[1:58:38] was frozen too and um I remember praying
[1:58:42] and asking the Lord to help me and he I
[1:58:45] felt his arms come around me and I it
[1:58:48] got me through it was just 15 minutes
[1:58:49] and I kept telling myself come on it's
[1:58:51] 15 minutes you can do
[1:58:53] this but it was it's terrifying you know
[1:58:56] and we are just hum so there's that but
[1:58:58] the testimony I wanted to give is when I
[1:59:00] was first diagnosed way back the 2013 I
[1:59:04] went back to the hospital being really
[1:59:07] really sick when I was going to start
[1:59:08] dialysis i' had been told I was going to
[1:59:10] die I'd been off of dialysis three
[1:59:11] months and one of the things that happen
[1:59:14] and I hope this is not too graphic or
[1:59:16] offensive to anyone but one of the
[1:59:18] things that happens when you lose kidney
[1:59:20] function is you use lose the ability
[1:59:22] over time to create urine you actually
[1:59:25] don't even make it your kidneys can't
[1:59:27] make it so all of that toxic waste in
[1:59:30] your body stays in your cells in your
[1:59:32] body and at really high levels that can
[1:59:35] kill you which was where I was it's
[1:59:38] blood Ura nitrogen it begins to leak out
[1:59:41] of your pores and you actually sweat it
[1:59:43] out as the body's like defense last
[1:59:45] emergency measure to get rid of this
[1:59:48] toxicity
[1:59:50] out of your system before you would
[1:59:51] actually die from it and I was
[1:59:54] experiencing something like this what I
[1:59:56] didn't know though is that it also has a
[1:59:59] particular smell as you can imagine and
[2:00:02] when I went in the hospital one of the
[2:00:05] first things I was told um by the
[2:00:07] dialysis nurse doing my emergent care
[2:00:11] she said you know what's really strange
[2:00:13] she said your levels were some of the
[2:00:15] highest levels ever recorded some of the
[2:00:17] nurses said they didn't know the level
[2:00:19] actually went as high on the chart as
[2:00:21] what I had it was over 200 um and you're
[2:00:23] supposed to have a count of a healthy
[2:00:25] person of only 25 and this would be like
[2:00:28] you know deciliters per whatever per
[2:00:30] your bloodstream and um she said their
[2:00:34] thing was you didn't smell she said I've
[2:00:39] I've had patients that you can smell the
[2:00:43] death on them you can smell that
[2:00:46] toxicity the minute you walk in the door
[2:00:49] because it's so strong she goes you
[2:00:52] didn't smell and she had this really
[2:00:54] curious look on her face well for me
[2:00:59] that was first kind of astounding I
[2:01:01] never knew such a thing would be or
[2:01:03] happen and what my mind went to is we
[2:01:07] know of a story in the Bible of three
[2:01:09] Hebrew children in the fire when God
[2:01:12] told them when they went in they said we
[2:01:15] will not bow we will not Bend we will
[2:01:18] not y gued our God is able to deliver us
[2:01:22] but even if he doesn't we're still not
[2:01:25] going to Bow and this has been my
[2:01:27] testimony in my stand I don't give into
[2:01:29] sickness I don't give into death and
[2:01:31] even if the Lord takes me home he is
[2:01:33] still my healer he is still my strength
[2:01:36] and he is still my keeper he's still the
[2:01:38] faithful God and one of the promises he
[2:01:41] gave me he said when you walk through
[2:01:42] the fire you shall not be burned neither
[2:01:45] shall the flame Kindle upon you and in
[2:01:48] that story
[2:01:49] we know the three Hebrew children went
[2:01:51] in there and when they came out their
[2:01:53] hair was not singed and they didn't even
[2:01:55] smell like smoke and for me this has
[2:01:59] been something I've held on in my heart
[2:02:02] and right now today things are you know
[2:02:04] very difficult I'm very exhausted I'm
[2:02:07] I'm struggling but I look at these
[2:02:10] things and I remember them because this
[2:02:13] is the thing that I can look back and
[2:02:14] say Lord if you were faithful then
[2:02:17] you'll be faithful today till the day
[2:02:19] you take me home whether if it's I go in
[2:02:21] the Rapture when you come for us or you
[2:02:23] choose to take me home you are my
[2:02:25] sovereign Lord and I still give my life
[2:02:28] and my heart to you thank you for
[2:02:30] keeping me thank you for strengthening
[2:02:32] me so I hope that encourages you that
[2:02:34] even in the middle of the fire he's
[2:02:36] still in the
[2:02:39] fire and
[2:02:42] that and that faith is why our sister is
[2:02:46] a walking miracle today is that Faith
[2:02:50] right there
[2:02:53] amen good evening tonight I don't think
[2:02:57] uh yes
[2:03:02] ma'am I was debating whether I should um
[2:03:05] say this or not but after Sarah spoke I
[2:03:09] I felt like I
[2:03:10] should sometimes I drop her off at for
[2:03:14] treatment when she hasn't slept all
[2:03:17] night or some whatever reason
[2:03:19] one
[2:03:23] day I watched her walk
[2:03:28] in I said Lord it sure hurts me to see
[2:03:32] my daughter walking
[2:03:36] there
[2:03:37] immediately the thought came to me the
[2:03:41] Lord spoke to me and
[2:03:43] said it hurt me too when I saw my son go
[2:03:47] to Calvary no
[2:03:51] so what comes or goes it's for God's
[2:03:55] glory and we give him
[2:04:03] praise
[2:04:06] only only a parent could say that Amen
[2:04:11] brother Aaron if you could lead us in
[2:04:13] one song before brother ly and sister
[2:04:16] Heather sings
[2:04:22] blessed be the

[2:06:22] inward
[2:06:26] pain but we shall still be
[2:06:32] joined in home and hope to
[2:06:39] me
[2:06:42] again I didn't know that Sarah would be
[2:06:45] here and give that
[2:06:46] testimony but I said we do blessed be
[2:06:50] the tie that binds our hearts it's hard
[2:06:54] sometimes when she comes or we go pick
[2:06:57] her up comes over to the
[2:07:01] house but you take God's
[2:07:06] word and you began to you began to speak
[2:07:09] it you began to say
[2:07:12] it and I remind her and sometimes she
[2:07:16] reminds me and mom and her sister
[2:07:19] what God has done yes amen we were in a
[2:07:22] restaurant one
[2:07:25] day and
[2:07:28] um she had had one of the doctors tell
[2:07:31] her as she was leaving the
[2:07:33] hospital you will be so sick you'll
[2:07:36] either die or they'll be dragging you in
[2:07:40] to the hospital if you don't do what we
[2:07:43] tell
[2:07:45] you so we were sitting at this
[2:07:47] restaurant
[2:07:49] and uh she Taps me on the side and she
[2:07:52] goes there's the doctor that told me
[2:07:55] that and he keeps looking at me like he
[2:07:58] can't believe it amen yes go our God is
[2:08:03] great

[2:08:07] while amen she is a Sarah Gara is a
[2:08:11] walking miracle if you want to see a
[2:08:13] miracle just don't go talk to Sister
[2:08:16] Sarah right there you know
[2:08:19] the Bible
[2:08:20] says that
[2:08:23] Jesus that God would make his enemies
[2:08:27] his foot
[2:08:28] stol and if we are made in the image of
[2:08:31] Christ and we are Sons and Daughters of
[2:08:34] God we have those same rights so that so
[2:08:38] Satan you are under my feet I'm going to
[2:08:41] walk all over you Satan you got nothing
[2:08:44] in part of this body you got nothing
[2:08:46] part of my family you your only Power
[2:08:49] your only Authority is what Jesus Christ
[2:08:52] allows you to have and that's all and
[2:08:55] one day soon you're going to be a cast
[2:08:58] into hell with you and all of your
[2:09:00] angels everyone that makes us sick
[2:09:02] you're going to be gone and you're going
[2:09:03] to be gone forever brother L sister
[2:09:06] Heather let's all
[2:09:08] [Music]
[2:09:12] stand searched and I search for the road
[2:09:17] that leads to Glory
[2:09:19] I wondered if I'd ever find the
[2:09:24] way I sat down to rest for my feet had
[2:09:30] grown so weary and then I Heard a Voice
[2:09:34] Within Me
[2:09:36] say you've got to keep on walking just
[2:09:42] keep right on
[2:09:44] walking walking in the light of the
[2:09:49] Lord you'll get to Heaven someday if you
[2:09:55] walk the right way walking in the light
[2:10:00] of the
[2:10:01] [Music]
