[15:35] has
[15:41] done the red line
[15:46] Mike so I want to say thank you for
[15:48] everybody who's been praying so about
[15:50] two and a half weeks ago my dad
[15:54] started um internally bleeding and so he
[15:59] got taken by ambulance to the
[16:03] hospital seemed like he was doing okay
[16:06] it seemed like you but he got he got
[16:08] taken from Cottonwood because there Inon
[16:09] he got taken from Cottonwood to um where
[16:12] they had an available bed in Phoenix and
[16:15] he's been there ever since for two and a
[16:17] half weeks and he's been bleeding not
[16:20] bleeding bleeding you know and it's kind
[16:22] of been kind of um you know trying to
[16:25] sort out what's going on is it stopping
[16:28] is it you know what's going on and so
[16:30] they were going to move him to a
[16:32] different hospital where the GI doctor
[16:34] that he's been talking to Works in that
[16:38] Network and they were waiting for a bed
[16:40] to come available and finally a bed came
[16:42] available they were supposed to
[16:44] transport him on like Monday night and
[16:48] he was tired he said
[16:50] don't so they came back the next night
[16:53] to transport him and he's like I do not
[16:54] feel well enough to do this like they
[16:56] had just done and um endoscopy where
[17:00] they went down the throat and were were
[17:01] taking pictures and stuff like that so
[17:03] that was Monday night they came to
[17:04] transport him very early Tuesday he
[17:08] started bleeding
[17:11] uncontrollably
[17:13] and the nurse that was taking care of my
[17:17] dad at that point he um started calling
[17:20] some shots this nurse is only about a
[17:21] year and a half into their nursing thing
[17:23] but he was just an absolute Angel he he
[17:26] started doing things he started calling
[17:28] for things
[17:29] whatever um they in eventually if you
[17:32] know my dad uh you'll find this amusing
[17:35] he they eventually had to say date him
[17:37] put him under for him to stop
[17:40] talking but he
[17:42] was he was praying out loud he was just
[17:47] doing whatever he could he was calling
[17:49] on the name of the Lord and finally
[17:51] they're like you got to stop talking
[17:52] they and they put him
[17:53] out and they started pumping blood into
[17:57] him it was not by the unit it was by the
[18:02] box and by the time that they got done
[18:05] with him they had used over 50 units of
[18:09] blood plasma and blood units a unit is
[18:12] about a half a liter so that was
[18:14] approximately five gallons that they
[18:17] used and the hos the hospital staff
[18:21] afterwards said it's an absolute miracle
[18:23] that you lived and talking to my oldest
[18:25] sister who's been a nurse for over 20
[18:27] years she says the all I've only seen
[18:29] that done a few times in my own career
[18:31] and she said that was on gona and trauma
[18:34] victims so they were able to find he it
[18:37] turns out that he had an aneurysm of the
[18:40] spleenic artery which goes so it's the
[18:42] artery that goes straight to the bleed
[18:44] they're able to locate that they were
[18:45] able to plug it
[18:47] up um it's not fun watching somebody
[18:50] intubated and then watching them come
[18:52] out of it but he came out of it he's
[18:54] sitting up he is talking and whatnot so
[18:57] that was just
[18:59] a little thing where we were sitting
[19:00] there going okay the Lord's got his hand
[19:01] on it we did get results back on
[19:03] Thursday that the mass that we thought
[19:05] was just assist is actually a fairly
[19:08] rare cancer and it's
[19:11] massive um so we are you know and then
[19:13] it was like you can't do really can't do
[19:16] radiation we don't have chemo treatment
[19:18] that will really touch it essentially
[19:20] it's our options are kind of like go
[19:23] home and Live Well to the end of your
[19:24] life type of thing except my sister
[19:26] texted a friend
[19:29] and she said my dad has had that cancer
[19:31] for the last number of years this is
[19:32] what we've been using so it's like a
[19:34] little ray of light sitting there're
[19:36] going okay here's here's something that
[19:38] it looks like maybe the Lord has dropped
[19:39] in our laps to say this is an
[19:41] opportunity and a possibility they are
[19:43] looking for other treatments to try for
[19:45] him um to see what they can do to shrink
[19:48] it but we absolutely covet your prayers
[19:51] but just having that little miracle
[19:53] dropped in our lap where even the
[19:54] hospital staff was saying this is a
[19:57] miracle
[19:58] has been enough to sit there and remind
[20:00] us that no matter what we do God's got
[20:03] everything under
[20:07] [Applause]
[20:17] control we serve a God it is more than
[20:20] able sometimes we question sometimes we
[20:23] ask why but he knows what's best
[20:27] amen you know one of these days he's
[20:30] going to call us all home not a sick not

[43:12] direction and meet that and then go back
[43:15] to his sermon I've seen that happen over
[43:18] and over I'll share a testimony I was at

[43:34] that brother if I not and I started to
[43:35] say that in my mind and I'm sitting on
[43:38] that side and he moves over that way and
[43:40] it looks like he's looking directly at
[43:42] me and he said now brother you got to be
[43:45] yourself you got to be who you are you
[43:48] can't be like me just started to say
[43:51] that for about 30 seconds and then he
[43:53] went right back and kept on preaching
[43:55] God knew exactly what I was where I was
[43:57] sitting and what I was thinking so he
[43:59] can meet your your need the same way so

[47:44] you're coming father and Lord we just
[47:47] want to ask you
[47:50] just as sincere as we we can Lord would

[48:00] amen God bless you this morning it's
[48:03] good to be in the house of the Lord this
[48:05] morning how many how many feel the same
[48:10] amen and it's good to come down and be
[48:12] with you here in in Tucson here at the
[48:15] Tabernacle and just uh really do uh
[48:18] don't want it to be just words or really
[48:19] do deem it a privilege to stand before
[48:22] you and um we appreciate the Pastor here
[48:26] brother Dan and his uh invitation and
[48:29] and the the willingness to for you to
[48:31] come and listen and and to be here this
[48:33] morning brother Aaron appreciate the
[48:35] hospitality brother Ed that just taking
[48:38] just such good care of us I I just have
[48:40] nothing but but uh but goodness in my
[48:43] heart toward you and um don't know what
[48:46] uh brother Dan necessarily sees in me
[48:49] but I'll just appreciate it I definitely
[48:51] don't see that in myself and don't think
[48:53] that I'm uh you know most of the time
[48:55] time you get invited and you speak and
[48:56] maybe that's the last time you ever go
[48:58] back so it's a privilege to to stand
[49:00] before you again and that the church
[49:01] wasn't half as full so you know that's a
[49:03] good sign and so just uh want to uh take
[49:07] some time maybe just talk to you this
[49:08] morning from my heart if that's okay and
[49:10] uh let's read a scripture and then you
[49:12] could have your seats thank you to the
[49:13] Musicians I appreciated that special uh
[49:16] sister and brother that was real nice I
[49:18] was in the back and just enjoyed
[49:20] that uh Ephesians
[49:22] 6 let just read a script one scripture
[49:25] here or two and then we'll just let you
[49:27] have your seats how many is feeling okay
[49:29] this
[49:30] morning all right if you're not feeling
[49:32] okay you came to the right place this
[49:33] morning and uh we we serve a God that uh
[49:37] like the brothers said it can turn it
[49:39] around just just instantly and turn it
[49:41] around he could speak to you and you
[49:43] know I I don't have a an if an issue
[49:47] with confidence because you know when
[49:48] there's when there's Believers in the in
[49:50] the congregation who are needing
[49:52] something and when they have uh the
[49:55] faith to pull God is actually obligated
[49:58] to meet their need and so as as a as a
[50:01] person standing up here unworthy to
[50:02] stand before you you know I could worry
[50:04] about what do I what am I going to say
[50:05] to help you and and the answer is
[50:07] nothing I can't say anything to help you
[50:09] but God through his sovereignty can pull
[50:13] from somebody who doesn't know anything
[50:15] about your need and doesn't know
[50:16] anything in general and give you exactly
[50:17] what you have need of and so that is
[50:19] what I want to lean on this morning and
[50:21] I pray that you would lean on that same
[50:22] thing this morning if you came to hear
[50:24] me you're going to be disappointed
[50:25] morning but if you came to hear
[50:26] something from God and receive something
[50:28] that you know it's not just uh well I
[50:30] want this little thing but that that one
[50:32] thing that would just save your life I
[50:35] don't know if you're in the same
[50:36] situation as me but sometimes I just
[50:37] don't need to hear a good a good word
[50:40] but I need something to save my very
[50:42] life and to keep me going that day and
[50:44] the next day and that's what the Lord is
[50:46] willing and able and wanting to give to
[50:48] you this morning so um just if you need
[50:51] have a need pull if you have a need
[50:54] don't just tell God God I'm not leaving
[50:56] this spot until you help me until you
[50:58] give me what it is that I have need of
[51:00] and watch him you know he loves he loves
[51:03] to hear a child of his say that he he
[51:05] doesn't you know he doesn't get offended
[51:07] at that that's what he wants us to do he
[51:09] wants us to pull from him amen let's
[51:11] just read this scripture Ephesians 6 and
[51:13] this is um I think a familiar scripture
[51:15] we'll just read um one or two verses
[51:17] here in uh Ephesians
[51:20] 6 verse 13 wherefore take unto you the
[51:24] whole armor of God that you may be able
[51:26] to withstand in the evil day and having
[51:29] done all to stand stand therefore having
[51:33] your loins GED about with the truth and
[51:35] having on the breastplate of
[51:36] righteousness and your feet Shaw with
[51:38] the preparation of the gospel of peace
[51:41] and above all taking the shield of Faith
[51:44] wherewith you shall be able to quench
[51:46] all the fiery darts of the wicked and
[51:49] take the helmet of salvation and the
[51:51] sword of the spirit which is the word of
[51:54] God praying always with all prayer and
[51:57] supplication to the spirit and watching
[52:00] there unto with all perseverance and
[52:02] supplication for All Saints amen you may
[52:04] be
[52:05] seated and uh well I don't know if of a
[52:08] day that's more applicable to that when
[52:10] it's talking about if you are standing
[52:12] in the evil day I don't think there's a
[52:14] more evil day than we've
[52:16] been um I would say a privilege to live
[52:21] in you say well why do you say that
[52:23] because this this is this is the age
[52:26] that that many people in the Bible
[52:29] brother Brown would tell us long to live
[52:31] in this age even though it's the most
[52:33] evil age this is the age we should be
[52:35] most encouraged and proud to live in and
[52:39] that's because you know it's not because
[52:40] we're special it's because you know in
[52:45] in the darkness as the days get darker
[52:47] you will be
[52:49] brighter and you don't have to do
[52:51] anything more you don't have to be more
[52:53] uh more special than somebody else but a
[52:56] a a light will shine
[52:58] brighter in the darkest day than it will
[53:00] in the daytime and you know the same the
[53:03] same type of faith that we read about in
[53:06] the Bible we have to have that faith and
[53:07] I believe that we do that's why we were
[53:09] placed in this day amen and so in this
[53:11] evil day we we we have this scripture I
[53:13] think we I think most of us are familiar
[53:16] with it but it's talking about the armor
[53:17] of God and I just wanted to to take one
[53:19] of these and um I pray that the Lord
[53:23] will will just guide what want to talk
[53:26] about this morning I I I talked a little
[53:27] bit with brother Dan yesterday and um he
[53:30] kind of told me what uh you know what to
[53:33] expect maybe and and just kind of gave
[53:35] me some encouragement which I
[53:36] appreciated and I I didn't know exactly
[53:38] what I want to talk about but you you
[53:39] forgive me I just want to relax a little
[53:41] bit this morning I'm not a not a great
[53:43] um not a great anything but I'm
[53:45] definitely not a evangelist or I could
[53:47] say I barely even know how to speak a
[53:49] little bit uh but I just want to tell
[53:51] you what's on my heart and I just want
[53:52] to talk to you this morning so you know
[53:54] this this scripture about this this uh
[53:56] this Armor of God it it applies to the
[54:00] Christian applies to you and I and you
[54:04] say it does it applies to whether you
[54:05] are a new Christian or whether you're a
[54:07] Christian that's been in the in in a
[54:09] Christian for 30 40 50
[54:11] years we have to have this Armor of God
[54:16] and and if you don't have this Armor of
[54:17] God you well you're not going to have a
[54:19] very good time in battle and if you
[54:22] decided if you have made the decision to
[54:23] be a Christian you have also at the same
[54:25] time decided to be in a battle and so
[54:28] this Armor of God is important and just
[54:30] wanted to to take one of them out of
[54:32] here that just says above all taking the
[54:34] shield of faith and and uh I had i' done
[54:37] a little bit of study on this and I I
[54:39] had studied what why it was so important
[54:41] and you know it's maybe I don't have a
[54:43] visual for you but you know I I pictured
[54:46] a a an army of soldiers lined up
[54:49] together a picture of an army of
[54:51] soldiers lined up together and they had
[54:52] their armor on brother Aaron but you
[54:54] know one of the most important things
[54:55] that they have is their Shield that's
[54:57] right and you know the shield is
[54:59] important because the shield it it's not
[55:02] necessarily an offenseive weapon but it
[55:03] protects you against the attacks which
[55:05] you are going to be attacked and and I
[55:07] don't know about you but I'm going
[55:08] through attacks myself right now so it's
[55:10] not just something well I'm going to be
[55:11] attacked tomorrow no I'm I'm being
[55:13] attacked right now uh mentally
[55:15] spiritually whatever it might be you're
[55:17] being attacked and this Shield but the
[55:19] beautiful part about the shield and I
[55:20] and I was I was looking at these
[55:22] different armies that that have existed
[55:24] through times use of course we don't use
[55:25] Shields now really but but we're talking
[55:28] about this armor and these these armies
[55:30] that have existed with these shields
[55:32] they would stand in a formation they
[55:35] would stand right next to each other and
[55:37] so their Shields would actually start to
[55:40] overlap into somebody else's Shield yes
[55:42] sir and what would happen is the the
[55:44] armies that were great and the armies
[55:45] that really conquered the world like the
[55:47] Roman armies they stood in a way where
[55:50] their Shield protected them but it also
[55:52] provided protection for the person next
[55:54] to them and you know I started to think
[55:56] about that a little bit as as a as a as
[55:58] a human being although I believe I'm a
[56:00] I'm a soldier of in the army of the of
[56:02] the Lord do you believe that now
[56:05] sometimes we don't feel very soldierly
[56:07] right right sometimes we don't we don't
[56:09] feel like we do the best about fighting
[56:11] sometimes the devil fights us and we
[56:13] lose most of the time I don't know I
[56:16] feel I feel like that sometimes and I
[56:17] wonder am I really an a soldier in the
[56:19] army of the Lord but I I want to
[56:21] encourage you and tell you you might
[56:22] lose and you might you might get injured
[56:26] you might actually make the mistake
[56:28] maybe it's not just the devil who's
[56:29] fighting against you but you might
[56:31] decide to do something you you know you
[56:33] shouldn't do and it's and it's
[56:36] completely your failure but I still want
[56:38] to tell you that you're a soldier in the
[56:40] army of the
[56:42] Lord and that's you could say well that
[56:44] sounds real great but I don't feel like
[56:46] a soldier but I'll take you to the word
[56:48] and I'll take you to the to the message
[56:50] that tells you despite your failings and
[56:53] despite the way that you feel
[56:55] you are a soldier in the army of the
[56:57] Lord and and and I think a lot of times
[56:59] we have these failures and these
[57:02] weaknesses to so that so that God
[57:04] exposes what it is that we're weak
[57:07] to I don't know about you but a lot of
[57:09] times I fail and and immediately I know
[57:11] what I'm vulnerable to what my weak
[57:13] points are and maybe maybe yours are
[57:15] different than mine I'm sure that they
[57:17] are and maybe something I struggle with
[57:19] if I were to tell you about it you would
[57:20] say brother why do you struggle with
[57:22] that right and each one of us if we were
[57:24] to share with one another well I don't
[57:26] struggle with that but that's the whole
[57:27] point of being in the army of the Lord
[57:29] is that brother Aaron I might see your
[57:33] weakness but if I'm a
[57:36] soldier I'm going to cover up your
[57:39] weakness see because I have my shield
[57:42] and my shield you know I want to protect
[57:43] myself I want to live but that Shield is
[57:45] also designed that I could go and stand
[57:47] next to my brother and I could protect
[57:49] his weakness and vice versa you might
[57:52] see mine and you know what we could do I
[57:55] don't know about you this this happens
[57:57] you know we could see somebody's
[57:58] weakness and we could go tell somebody
[58:00] else about
[58:02] it that one never gets as many amens but
[58:05] that's that's usually what happens right
[58:08] we see somebody's weakness you know that
[58:10] person they struggle a little bit with
[58:11] showing up to
[58:12] church maybe that person struggles a
[58:14] little bit with uh with prayer I'm just
[58:17] going to name off the ones that I know
[58:18] are true right maybe that that person
[58:21] struggles a little bit with with uh with
[58:23] with a little bit of gossip we talking
[58:25] about somebody right and we see that and
[58:27] a lot of times we'll go to somebody else
[58:29] and you know it maybe the phrase always
[58:31] starts with I just want to tell you
[58:32] about this so you pray for them right
[58:35] but what we're doing a lot of times and
[58:36] what I've been guilty of is instead of
[58:39] covering up their
[58:41] weakness and to help them with it I
[58:44] expose their weakness even more and then
[58:47] they feel like that're they're not a
[58:48] soldier anymore because somebody instead
[58:51] of saying you know what I see that
[58:52] you're weak here on your side' I'm going
[58:55] to go ahead and stand right here and I'm
[58:56] going to protect you from
[58:58] attack and you can go to that person
[59:00] one-on-one you can say you know what I'm
[59:01] I'm going to pray for you I'm GNA pray
[59:03] not for you I'm going to pray with
[59:06] you I don't know about you but I've I've
[59:08] heard a lot of people tell me I'm GNA
[59:10] pray for you brother and it and it feels
[59:12] good I I appreciate those prayers but
[59:13] it's nothing like when somebody says you
[59:16] know what I'm going to pray with you
[59:17] let's pray right now I don't know about
[59:19] you but but sometimes I you know when
[59:21] you tell somebody something you say well
[59:23] I'll be praying for you I wonder I don't
[59:25] know if you've done it I've definitely
[59:27] been guilty but sometimes I've forgotten
[59:28] to pray about that and I wonder if maybe
[59:31] I just changed my behavior when somebody
[59:33] tells me something rather than say well
[59:34] you know what I'm going to pray for you
[59:35] brother how about we pray right now
[59:38] maybe you're on the phone with them
[59:40] maybe you're talking about over text or
[59:41] or email whatever it might be you know
[59:43] what let's pray right now over this
[59:45] thing rather than let's put it off until
[59:48] later and I think we have good
[59:49] intentions but you know we get busy and
[59:52] I've forgotten but I but if I see that
[59:55] weakness because we certainly see each
[59:57] other's
[59:58] weaknesses right we're human beings
[1:00:00] that's one of the things we're really
[1:00:02] good at is we're really good at seeing
[1:00:03] the weaknesses of somebody else
[1:00:05] sometimes not our own so good right but
[1:00:08] we definitely see the weaknesses of
[1:00:10] somebody else and I think that's
[1:00:11] actually for a purpose now I know this
[1:00:14] isn't a real big exciting message or
[1:00:16] anything but this to me this is what's
[1:00:17] on my heart we see those weaknesses and
[1:00:20] I think that the Lord allows us to see
[1:00:22] those because then we have a chance to
[1:00:24] prove really if we're a soldier in the
[1:00:26] army of the Lord because you could go
[1:00:28] out and fight a battle for yourself and
[1:00:31] that you know you're a soldier but do
[1:00:33] you have the
[1:00:34] shield see do you have a shield if you
[1:00:36] have a shield you're going to go and
[1:00:39] stand at your brother or your sister's
[1:00:42] vulnerable
[1:00:43] side and you're going to say no attack
[1:00:46] is going to get through
[1:00:48] here no attack of Satan is going to get
[1:00:51] through here and you know a lot of times
[1:00:53] the Lord has made made us dependent on
[1:00:56] one another for that exact thing because
[1:00:58] he's made you and he's made me and I
[1:01:00] have weaknesses and I think Lord why did
[1:01:02] you make me with those weaknesses and it
[1:01:04] maybe it's just so another brother or
[1:01:06] sister can find their place as a soldier
[1:01:10] next to me and say I'm going to protect
[1:01:12] this brother's
[1:01:13] weaknesses and when a whole congregation
[1:01:17] can do that that's right when a whole
[1:01:20] church can do that when a whole family
[1:01:22] can do that and you know we could we
[1:01:23] could limit it to these walls but I
[1:01:25] don't want to limit it to these walls
[1:01:27] cuz that's that's a little bit easy
[1:01:28] right well I love this brother and
[1:01:29] they're my family or they get along with
[1:01:31] me and I agree with them but how about
[1:01:33] the Christian who doesn't necessarily
[1:01:35] agree with you all the time I I don't
[1:01:37] know about you but it's a lot easier to
[1:01:39] see the weaknesses of somebody who
[1:01:40] doesn't agree with you right their
[1:01:43] weaknesses become even more apparent but
[1:01:47] guess what as a soldier in the army of
[1:01:50] the Lord it is your duty to go and cover
[1:01:53] their weakness
[1:01:56] now does that mean that we accept all
[1:01:59] wrongdoing
[1:02:01] no but neither does God accept our
[1:02:05] wrongdoing but that's not what I'm
[1:02:07] talking about I'm not talking about
[1:02:08] seeing something that's wrong and
[1:02:09] calling it
[1:02:11] right I'm talking about protecting them
[1:02:15] from an attack of the devil as the Lord
[1:02:18] heals them and works on them and changes
[1:02:21] them like I pray he's doing to you and I
[1:02:25] but sometimes we just need a shield up
[1:02:27] while we're trying to push through in
[1:02:30] prayer trying to hit our knees Lord I'm
[1:02:32] struggling this I'm battling with this
[1:02:34] and at the same time the devil's just
[1:02:36] hammering on you and I think it's I
[1:02:38] think it's our duty and I think really
[1:02:39] it should be our privilege it should be
[1:02:42] our desire to go and cover up our
[1:02:44] brother and our sister with our shield
[1:02:47] and it really will prove if you have
[1:02:48] that Shield or not and if if you find
[1:02:51] that you don't have the ability to cover
[1:02:52] up well guess what you have just found
[1:02:54] out what to pray for you've just found
[1:02:57] Lord I don't I might not have the shield
[1:02:59] Lord give me that shield and I'll tell
[1:03:01] you what Lord I'll use
[1:03:03] it I don't know where you're at but
[1:03:05] that's that's where I'm at if I find
[1:03:08] myself exposing my brother and sister's
[1:03:12] weaknesses and I just want to say that
[1:03:14] sometimes we do that and the way out of
[1:03:16] it is that we actually find a way that
[1:03:19] they're not a brother or a
[1:03:21] sister you know a lot of times when we
[1:03:23] start poting out somebody's mistake and
[1:03:25] we realize that we shouldn't be doing
[1:03:27] that then it's real easy to say well
[1:03:30] maybe they're not a Believer well they
[1:03:32] do believe this kind of crazy thing
[1:03:34] brother Aaron maybe they're not a
[1:03:35] brother and sister and see it's okay for
[1:03:37] me to do that right now that might just
[1:03:39] be a a slim major some of us just a slim
[1:03:42] margin but I know that's the case
[1:03:43] because I've struggled with that de
[1:03:46] christianizing somebody so that I can
[1:03:48] feel better about criticizing
[1:03:51] him and that that is not how a soldier
[1:03:54] operates that that's a that's a oneman
[1:03:56] army and I tell you a oneman army is
[1:03:58] going to
[1:03:59] fail that's not what we were made to be
[1:04:02] we were made to be a many membered body
[1:04:06] many membered body and when one part of
[1:04:09] the body
[1:04:10] hurts the whole body should hurt when
[1:04:13] one soldier even if it's somebody way
[1:04:16] over here that maybe you don't
[1:04:17] fellowship with that much or you don't
[1:04:19] know that much when they are being
[1:04:20] attacked the whole body should feel that
[1:04:23] attack and the whole body should shift
[1:04:26] and cover them until that healing can
[1:04:29] take place or a change can take place
[1:04:32] and
[1:04:33] so and a lot of times it's hard to do
[1:04:35] that because the soldier that's on your
[1:04:37] that's on your side they may not see the
[1:04:39] same view as you in fact hardly any of
[1:04:41] us think the same way we could all read
[1:04:44] the same message or hear the same
[1:04:46] message and you could ask somebody
[1:04:47] afterwards what did you think about that
[1:04:49] and you would get so many different
[1:04:50] perspectives of it right now now there
[1:04:53] isn't one right
[1:04:54] one because your
[1:04:57] perspective from your point of view is
[1:04:59] just as right as mine from my point of
[1:05:01] view man and and and I I actually don't
[1:05:04] even know what's on the uh the front of
[1:05:05] the
[1:05:06] pulpit because I came in from the
[1:05:09] backside there's a cross there no there
[1:05:12] isn't brother
[1:05:15] Aaron yeah see there's no cross on the
[1:05:17] pulpit I see some
[1:05:21] books and some water and a and a light
[1:05:24] and a microphone and you say there's a
[1:05:27] cross well you're off the
[1:05:30] word right it's it's a silly example but
[1:05:36] but that's exactly what we're guilty of
[1:05:38] a lot of times I know I
[1:05:40] am and yet if I were just to walk a mile
[1:05:44] in your shoes on your side I would see
[1:05:47] very clearly that there's a cross on the
[1:05:49] side of on the side of the pulpit and
[1:05:52] somebody come to you and say well you
[1:05:53] know brother Brown said this and this
[1:05:55] what it means no it
[1:05:57] doesn't you know the Bible says this and
[1:05:59] this is what I believe nope you're wrong
[1:06:01] this is what it means and and and I've
[1:06:04] been guilty of doing this it's the same
[1:06:05] thing and I have to realize that in
[1:06:07] order to protect my side I actually need
[1:06:10] a soldier who's facing the enemy a
[1:06:12] different way than I'm facing
[1:06:14] him you know because he's not always
[1:06:17] just going to come and and attack you on
[1:06:19] your front where you're strong actually
[1:06:20] he's rarely GNA do that he's GNA come
[1:06:22] and try to attack you on the side he's
[1:06:24] going to try attack you from the back
[1:06:26] and guess what I need Soldiers with a
[1:06:29] different perspective than me because
[1:06:31] they're facing this direction and
[1:06:33] they're guarding me who is right here
[1:06:36] against an attack that's coming on my
[1:06:37] side and if I go and tell that brother
[1:06:40] well you're wrong because you're looking
[1:06:41] at a the message or the Bible a
[1:06:43] different way than me I'm not I'm doing
[1:06:45] myself a
[1:06:46] disservice because that Soldier was
[1:06:48] placed there you were
[1:06:50] placed with your experience with your
[1:06:53] church with your ministers with your
[1:06:55] everything you were placed a certain way
[1:06:57] so that you can guard the body of Christ
[1:07:00] from a certain
[1:07:01] attack and don't let anybody take that
[1:07:03] away from you don't let anybody say oh
[1:07:05] well you know you're you have this
[1:07:07] certain vision and you're wrong in this
[1:07:08] say brother I'm facing the attack that
[1:07:11] I'm facing today and and Lord willing
[1:07:13] I'm protecting somebody from an
[1:07:16] attack because I'm strong when I'm
[1:07:18] facing this attack but they might not be
[1:07:21] strong because it might be hitting them
[1:07:22] on the side and Lord willing if I'm
[1:07:24] facing this way and and I just we don't
[1:07:26] see the same Lord willing you're
[1:07:27] protecting my side you're protecting me
[1:07:30] from an attack that I might not see
[1:07:32] coming if we have that mentality if we
[1:07:35] have that really in our hearts you know
[1:07:36] that we would be an Unstoppable
[1:07:39] Army we would be an invincible Army
[1:07:41] because we would be protected as the
[1:07:43] Bible says on all sides so even if your
[1:07:47] weaknesses which we have which I I
[1:07:50] believe I don't know about you I believe
[1:07:51] we're going to have those weaknesses
[1:07:52] until we're out of this body
[1:07:55] we're going to have those weaknesses so
[1:07:56] I don't think you can get stronger you
[1:07:59] can overcome but you're always going to
[1:08:01] have weaknesses and I think until until
[1:08:04] we're raptured out of here we're going
[1:08:05] to have and I need somebody to be
[1:08:07] protecting my weaknesses and I promise
[1:08:09] you I'll protect
[1:08:11] yours and if we could make that if we
[1:08:14] could have that attitude towards each
[1:08:16] other and not just the ones that we
[1:08:19] like not just towards the brothers and
[1:08:22] sisters we like but the ones that that
[1:08:25] really need
[1:08:27] protection I believe we would I believe
[1:08:29] it would change the Church of
[1:08:32] God I believe it would transform the
[1:08:35] Church of God into an invincible
[1:08:39] Army now I'm not telling you you don't
[1:08:41] do this I'm just I'm just preaching to
[1:08:43] you I just want to talk to
[1:08:45] you you cannot have if somebody comes to
[1:08:48] you and they have a different
[1:08:48] perspective you your reaction will tell
[1:08:50] you a lot whether you believe they're a
[1:08:53] soldier or not if if they tell you you
[1:08:55] have a different well we just I won't go
[1:08:57] into that but
[1:08:59] but it's it's it's important how we
[1:09:02] react to somebody who doesn't agree with
[1:09:05] us that's what I want to say it's
[1:09:07] important how you react to somebody who
[1:09:11] we believe the same thing but maybe they
[1:09:13] just have a different view of
[1:09:15] it and maybe it's because I'm not in
[1:09:19] position you know maybe that person we
[1:09:21] were talking about this with a brother
[1:09:22] last night and he said he was I I it was
[1:09:25] just it just kind of really touched me
[1:09:27] he said you know there was there was a
[1:09:29] little bit of doctrinal things going on
[1:09:31] in his church and he said he prayed to
[1:09:33] the Lord Lord why do I have this evil
[1:09:34] spirit on me that I can't see where my
[1:09:37] brothers are coming from have you ever
[1:09:39] prayed like that you know most of the
[1:09:41] time I pray Lord my brother's got an
[1:09:44] evil spirit on him you know why don't
[1:09:46] you help him to see my point of view
[1:09:47] right and we were talking about this and
[1:09:49] we were talking a few days ago I was
[1:09:51] talking with the same brother and I was
[1:09:52] you know you know know the the the the
[1:09:55] the message says that the right spirit
[1:09:58] will correct the wrong Doctrine amen we
[1:10:01] we we were familiar with this and and
[1:10:04] I'll just be honest with you this is a
[1:10:05] little bit of confession most of my life
[1:10:08] up until really really recently I
[1:10:10] thought okay if I'm going to go and I'm
[1:10:13] going to talk with a certain brother and
[1:10:14] we don't see eye to
[1:10:15] eye if I have the right
[1:10:20] Spirit there's a chance that his
[1:10:23] Doctrine could be
[1:10:25] corrected and then the Lord was just
[1:10:28] like like knocking on my head and I for
[1:10:32] the first time now maybe you all know
[1:10:33] this but for me it was a revelation if I
[1:10:35] have the right
[1:10:37] Spirit my Doctrine can be
[1:10:41] corrected see instead of me having the
[1:10:43] attitude of the right Spirit here we'll
[1:10:46] correct the wrong Doctrine there it's
[1:10:49] the right Spirit here if I'm willing to
[1:10:52] receive correction will correct the
[1:10:54] wrong Doctrine here and if my brother
[1:10:56] has that same attitude guess what we're
[1:10:58] both going to end up
[1:11:00] unified rather than me coming with the
[1:11:02] attitude well if I have the right
[1:11:05] spirit I I'm you're going to get some
[1:11:07] correction that that doesn't even sound
[1:11:09] right after you think about it that way
[1:11:11] but yet the natural part of us says man
[1:11:13] I just want to have the right spirit so
[1:11:14] that my brother or sister can be
[1:11:16] corrected in a loving way and a right
[1:11:18] way and I think our intentions are good
[1:11:20] but you see how just a simple shift of
[1:11:22] our mind
[1:11:24] and our hearts would change that
[1:11:28] scenario
[1:11:31] and you know somebody you might have you
[1:11:34] might have friends you might have
[1:11:38] family that you think
[1:11:42] are are a
[1:11:45] soldier and and I'm not here to tell you
[1:11:47] who is a soldier of God and who
[1:11:49] isn't but if
[1:11:51] somebody doesn't have a a shield and is
[1:11:54] on your
[1:11:55] side you have to be careful with
[1:11:58] that you have to be careful who you line
[1:12:01] up next
[1:12:04] to because I'm telling you you need to
[1:12:06] have Your Flank
[1:12:09] protected and you might have good good
[1:12:13] friends who have the best intention for
[1:12:16] you but if they don't have a shield in
[1:12:18] their hand that's not somebody you want
[1:12:19] to line up
[1:12:21] with now and I don't mean you have have
[1:12:23] to cut them off I don't mean you have to
[1:12:25] never talk to them again but I'm telling
[1:12:26] you when you go into
[1:12:28] battle don't rely on that person unless
[1:12:31] they have a shield in their hand to
[1:12:33] protect
[1:12:37] you amen I want to read a quote if
[1:12:39] that's okay with you he says in take on
[1:12:41] the whole armor of God he says in
[1:12:43] brother brandom 62 says now watch God
[1:12:45] doesn't have to do anything more to make
[1:12:47] it any more appealing the only thing he
[1:12:50] has to do is raise up a standard of his
[1:12:53] own word against the
[1:12:55] enemy when the Bible the Bible says when
[1:12:57] the enemy comes in like a flood the
[1:12:59] spirit of God raises a standard against
[1:13:01] it what does he do he makes the word
[1:13:05] that he has already said now we've heard
[1:13:07] the word amen we have the word he makes
[1:13:12] the word that he's already said more
[1:13:17] positive he taking his same word and
[1:13:20] just making it more positive and and for
[1:13:22] me what does that mean that means the
[1:13:24] same exact word that you heard and said
[1:13:28] that's the
[1:13:29] truth that's the truth I don't know what
[1:13:31] I don't know what it is but that is the
[1:13:33] truth and I'm going to give my heart to
[1:13:34] the Lord you know that same exact word
[1:13:37] is the same word that you go defeat the
[1:13:38] Devil with you say well now okay now
[1:13:41] that I've given my heart to the Lord and
[1:13:42] now I'm coming to church I need to take
[1:13:45] on and and we we believe in learning we
[1:13:47] we believe in coming and hearing the
[1:13:48] word but now I need to take on this all
[1:13:50] this word in order to go defeat the
[1:13:52] Devil no it's the same exact word that
[1:13:54] you heard you can go and defeat the
[1:13:56] Devil with that same word that one that
[1:13:58] called you and called me out of sin is
[1:14:02] the same exact word you can take right
[1:14:04] to the devil and say no I have this word
[1:14:07] maybe I don't know all of the scripture
[1:14:08] maybe I don't know all the message but I
[1:14:10] know this because this spoke to me and
[1:14:13] I'm going to comat you with this and you
[1:14:14] know that that can beat the
[1:14:16] devil you said no you you have to have
[1:14:19] more than that no you don't need any
[1:14:20] more than that that is the word that's
[1:14:23] been revealed to you and so I I I can't
[1:14:26] stress that enough because I think
[1:14:28] sometimes as a especially as a new
[1:14:30] Christian we feel a little bit you feel
[1:14:32] overwhelmed by the amount of word that
[1:14:34] there is and how much you need to learn
[1:14:35] to go defeat the Devil when it's not
[1:14:38] that way you have been given the word of
[1:14:42] God because he called you out of
[1:14:44] Darkness not into a man's word not into
[1:14:49] a man's light not into a man's Church no
[1:14:51] he called you into his light
[1:14:54] into his word and if you understand a
[1:14:57] portion of his word you can take that
[1:14:59] portion and you can go defeat the Devil
[1:15:01] with it because you understand it and
[1:15:03] you believe it now is there more to
[1:15:05] learn yes there's more to learn is there
[1:15:07] more to believe yes there is but it's
[1:15:09] the same exact word and it won't
[1:15:12] contradict that maybe that you maybe you
[1:15:14] just have one little sentence that that
[1:15:16] called you out of sin you can take that
[1:15:19] sentence to the devil and you can defeat
[1:15:21] him that is the word word of
[1:15:24] God and and I just want to stress that
[1:15:27] because because a lot of times we lose
[1:15:29] battles because we don't believe we have
[1:15:31] enough of the sword of of the word of
[1:15:33] God to go strike the devil and I tell
[1:15:35] you you have it and it's not just this
[1:15:38] isn't just a feel-good message about it
[1:15:40] this is the word of God saying no no no
[1:15:42] you have it you have it yeah but I I
[1:15:46] brother I just no no no no you have it
[1:15:49] don't let this don't let the devil come
[1:15:51] in and tell you Oh no you're weak oh
[1:15:54] you're you know what you're just a new
[1:15:56] recruit and I I want to read you
[1:15:58] something you you got you got a moment
[1:15:59] here I want to read this to you he says
[1:16:02] this and hear ye him no I'm sorry in
[1:16:05] God's covenant with Abraham he says and
[1:16:06] he's talking about Jesus meeting Satan
[1:16:08] in the wilderness he says when he met
[1:16:10] Satan he never used any of his power you
[1:16:12] imagine that imagine that Jesus he act
[1:16:16] Satan comes from him and says you know
[1:16:17] you could turn these rocks into bread
[1:16:19] and Jesus could have done that he could
[1:16:21] have turned those rocks into bread but
[1:16:22] he says he never used any of his power
[1:16:25] listen now he proved Jesus proved that
[1:16:29] the weakest Christian could defeat
[1:16:32] Satan I don't know if that excites you
[1:16:34] but I I don't know what I could be maybe
[1:16:37] I know I'm not the strongest Christian
[1:16:38] brother Aron but I could be the weakest
[1:16:41] Christian I could be
[1:16:43] that you know I I could tell you all the
[1:16:45] things that I'm weak in I could tell you
[1:16:47] all the things I'm not good in but but I
[1:16:49] know that he saved
[1:16:50] me that I know he did I I know that he
[1:16:53] came and he spoke to me and I had an
[1:16:55] experience with him guess what you are
[1:16:57] now qualified to be minimum the weakest
[1:17:00] Christian that there is and guess what
[1:17:02] the weakest Christian this is right out
[1:17:04] of the message the weakest Christian can
[1:17:07] defeat
[1:17:08] Satan when Satan come to him and said
[1:17:10] now I want you're the Son of God you're
[1:17:12] a great miracle worker if you are I want
[1:17:14] you to perform a miracle here for me
[1:17:16] turn stones into bread and and Jesus
[1:17:18] could have used his power but he didn't
[1:17:21] he used the word amen he said it is
[1:17:25] written men shall not live by bread
[1:17:26] alone but by every word that proceeded
[1:17:28] out of the mouth of God he defeated
[1:17:30] Satan on his own
[1:17:32] ground you know he went into Satan's
[1:17:35] territory and he defeated him on his
[1:17:38] territory with the word of God and he
[1:17:40] says and the weakest Christian here
[1:17:42] tonight can defeat Satan
[1:17:45] anywhere any place any time under any
[1:17:51] condition thus th saith the
[1:17:55] Lord now you can take that
[1:18:00] amen and then he goes on to say you just
[1:18:03] believe it God said
[1:18:07] so don't now now if the next words out
[1:18:09] your mouth brother I don't know a lot
[1:18:11] that's I don't care about that that's
[1:18:13] not what he said he said you if you even
[1:18:17] consider yourself the weakest Christian
[1:18:19] are able to defeat the Satan anywhere
[1:18:22] anytime on any grounds under any
[1:18:26] condition now if you if you don't have
[1:18:29] anything else to hold on to hold on to
[1:18:32] that if you don't know a lot of the word
[1:18:35] you can know that word right there and
[1:18:38] you can cut that out and you can keep it
[1:18:39] right in front of you and when the when
[1:18:41] the devil attacks you because he
[1:18:42] certainly is going to attack you you can
[1:18:44] say you know what you're right you're
[1:18:47] right you're right I'm weak over here
[1:18:49] you're right I failed here you're right
[1:18:51] I'm not mentally strong I'm I'm not I'm
[1:18:53] not strong you're right
[1:18:56] but but I am the weakest Christian and I
[1:18:59] can defeat
[1:19:02] you and that will I guarantee you
[1:19:05] because it's the word of God will send
[1:19:07] him
[1:19:08] running because then he knows okay and
[1:19:10] he's going to come back and he's going
[1:19:11] to attack you again and what are you
[1:19:13] going to do take him to the
[1:19:17] word now he might quote work back to you
[1:19:20] like he did with Jesus you know what you
[1:19:22] do take back to this
[1:19:25] word amen let's let's move for I want to
[1:19:28] I want to talk about something if we
[1:19:29] could in Joshua if you could turn to
[1:19:31] Joshua maybe this is a little bit of a
[1:19:33] change but you know I I just personally
[1:19:37] I get so tired of the devil attacking
[1:19:40] Christians and and and him telling them
[1:19:43] that they're not strong enough to defeat
[1:19:44] him and I just feel like to stay right
[1:19:47] there if that's okay let's go to
[1:19:49] Joshua I got to find it myself here
[1:19:55] Joshua
[1:20:01] 10 and I don't know maybe we won't move
[1:20:03] off of that I
[1:20:05] just I just get so tired of the
[1:20:09] devil and it's not just for new
[1:20:11] Christians he does it with he does it
[1:20:12] with seasoned Christians he does it with
[1:20:14] everybody he comes in I don't know about
[1:20:17] you but he attacks by saying you know
[1:20:19] what you've been a Christian for 10
[1:20:21] years 5 years 20 years and you still
[1:20:23] struggle with this you still struggle
[1:20:25] with that it's that same attack that
[1:20:27] he's attacking a new convert with oh you
[1:20:30] still have a problem look at brother so
[1:20:32] and so he doesn't struggle with
[1:20:34] that now he's showing you a Brother's
[1:20:37] strengths to try to deceive
[1:20:39] you that's what he does he'll and then
[1:20:43] by comparison you look at your
[1:20:44] weaknesses and you go oh I must not I
[1:20:46] must not be what I thought I was you
[1:20:48] know maybe I'm not able to handle this
[1:20:50] sword brother brandom says if he can get
[1:20:51] you to disbel believe the
[1:20:54] word he has disarmed
[1:20:58] you which tells me you were armed to
[1:21:01] begin
[1:21:03] with if you if he can get you it's in
[1:21:05] the greatest battle of her fought you
[1:21:07] can read he says about four or five
[1:21:08] times if he can get you to disbelieve
[1:21:11] one word and he goes and he said eve he
[1:21:15] says he got her to disbelieve one word
[1:21:17] and he goes right there she was
[1:21:20] disarmed now I know sometimes you don't
[1:21:24] feel like you're like you're a soldier
[1:21:27] right maybe you don't feel even like
[1:21:29] you're a good Christian or not maybe you
[1:21:30] don't feel like you're a Believer I
[1:21:32] don't know sometimes I feel like I'm a
[1:21:33] make
[1:21:34] believer just with some of the mistakes
[1:21:36] that I make and Lord I'm trying but here
[1:21:38] I go and I do this and here I think this
[1:21:40] thing and here I say this thing that I
[1:21:42] don't want to
[1:21:43] say and then the devil will come and oh
[1:21:46] you're just yeah you're trying but
[1:21:47] you're just one of those make Believers
[1:21:49] and if you stop and you listen to that
[1:21:52] he disarms
[1:21:54] you and now you're in trouble because
[1:21:57] now attacks are going to start to work
[1:21:59] because you've been
[1:22:01] disarmed but I'm going to read something
[1:22:03] to you in a minute here where even his
[1:22:06] attacks are
[1:22:08] lies even his attacks are
[1:22:11] bluffs in Joshua 10 verse1 15 might seem
[1:22:15] like a strange verse to read but this is
[1:22:16] Joshua coming back from a battle he's
[1:22:19] coming back from a battle he says Joshua
[1:22:20] return verse 15 of chapter 10 and all
[1:22:23] Israel with him under the camp to gilgal
[1:22:26] five Kings escaped this
[1:22:28] battle and they fled and they hid
[1:22:31] themselves in a cave and it was told to
[1:22:33] Joshua saying the five kings are found
[1:22:35] in a cave at M
[1:22:38] Mada and and Joshua says to paraphrase
[1:22:41] and to save time he says roll these
[1:22:43] Stones up upon the cave and just just
[1:22:45] leave them in there for a little while
[1:22:47] as the young people would say my son
[1:22:49] would know let him
[1:22:51] cook
[1:22:53] just just just let them let them let
[1:22:55] them sit there for a little
[1:22:57] while and they actually go and have a
[1:22:59] whole another battle and defeat a whole
[1:23:01] another Army and then after the battle
[1:23:03] he comes back and he says in verse 22
[1:23:05] okay now open the mouth of the cave and
[1:23:07] bring out those kings and they did so
[1:23:10] and brought forth five Kings them out of
[1:23:11] the Cave the king of Jerusalem Hebron
[1:23:14] jarmuth lashus and eglon I hope I said
[1:23:17] those right and it came to pass they
[1:23:18] brought out those King under Joshua and
[1:23:20] I love this now he called for
[1:23:24] the
[1:23:27] Warriors the
[1:23:29] ministers right he called for the
[1:23:33] apostles and the prophets that's not
[1:23:35] what my Bible
[1:23:36] says he called for the men of
[1:23:40] Israel you know who he called for
[1:23:44] congregation come over here well brother
[1:23:47] I I just I just got here I just got
[1:23:50] saved yep come over here well brother I
[1:23:54] i' I've been in I've been in the message
[1:23:56] for many years I've but I I'm not a
[1:23:58] preacher I'm not a warrior I'm I'm a I'm
[1:24:00] a good yep come over
[1:24:04] here well you know but
[1:24:06] I I failed a
[1:24:09] lot yeah I got weaknesses I I I I
[1:24:12] struggle in my prayer life I struggle
[1:24:14] overcoming yep come over
[1:24:17] here that's what he's telling
[1:24:20] them called for all the men of Israel
[1:24:24] and then he said unto the captains of
[1:24:25] Men of War which went with him come near
[1:24:28] and put your
[1:24:30] feet on the necks of these
[1:24:35] Kings and they came near and put their
[1:24:37] feet upon the necks and he said unto
[1:24:39] them fear
[1:24:42] not because I think a lot of times we
[1:24:44] don't defeat the enemy because we're
[1:24:46] afraid of the
[1:24:48] enemy and we're afraid that we're not
[1:24:50] Mighty enough to defeat him
[1:24:54] and if you went off of your feelings
[1:24:56] that would be
[1:24:57] true but we're not asked to go off of
[1:24:59] our
[1:25:01] feelings we're asked to go by the word
[1:25:03] of God that and you know when it says
[1:25:05] under any conditions you can defeat the
[1:25:07] Devil I think the condition that most
[1:25:09] keeps us is
[1:25:12] fear it's these conditions that keep me
[1:25:14] from defeating the enemy sometimes it's
[1:25:16] nothing that's external but my own fears
[1:25:18] my own thoughts my own doubts my own
[1:25:21] doubts about myself keep me from
[1:25:23] fighting the devil and defeating him but
[1:25:25] I love this now it's one thing if Joshua
[1:25:27] would have went and and killed these
[1:25:28] Kings everybody would have been like
[1:25:30] well it's Joshua of course he's going to
[1:25:31] kill them right it can I just say this I
[1:25:34] hope it doesn't offend but if brother
[1:25:35] Branham goes and slays the enemy none of
[1:25:39] us would be surprised that's the prophet
[1:25:41] of God and he goes and he casts out
[1:25:44] demons in a prayer line he goes and
[1:25:46] calls this and we can say Amen to that
[1:25:48] but brother bram's trying to get a point
[1:25:50] across this to say no no wait a minute
[1:25:52] it the weakest of you can defeat this
[1:25:55] devil the same
[1:25:57] way and it's in the Bible Joshua says
[1:25:59] okay now I can kill these Kings and you
[1:26:02] could say man what a what a mighty
[1:26:03] warrior Joshua is but he says no no you
[1:26:06] come over here and you put your foot on
[1:26:09] the neck of this King that held you down
[1:26:12] on the neck of this enemy who who who
[1:26:15] enslaved you who was over here you put
[1:26:18] your foot on the neck and he says and be
[1:26:19] not afraid he says fear not nor be made
[1:26:22] be strong and of good courage for thus
[1:26:26] the Lord shall do to all your enemies
[1:26:30] whom who fights
[1:26:34] you if we are waiting
[1:26:37] for I think I know I think you know what
[1:26:39] I mean when I say this but if we're
[1:26:40] waiting for a Ministry to go and fight
[1:26:43] our battles for us we are going to
[1:26:45] lose we are going to lose the minister
[1:26:48] is an important part of of a
[1:26:50] congregation but they are a servant to
[1:26:52] to the people there is a people
[1:26:55] individual people in here that must go
[1:26:58] and fight their battle someone else
[1:27:01] cannot overcome your battle for you I
[1:27:04] can protect your flank you can protect
[1:27:06] mine but you have some overcoming to do
[1:27:09] and guess what when you when you when
[1:27:11] you go forward not with the not because
[1:27:15] you're strong and because you're good
[1:27:16] and because you're just you're a
[1:27:18] powerful work no no no you just go
[1:27:19] forward with a simple word of God that
[1:27:21] says the weakest Christian can defeat
[1:27:25] Satan guess what when you go into battle
[1:27:27] with that you are going to
[1:27:30] win you might get hit you might get
[1:27:32] wounded you might get injured but you
[1:27:34] are going to win and it's not my word
[1:27:37] it's the word that's telling you that
[1:27:39] thus the Lord do to all your enemies
[1:27:42] against whom you fight and afterward
[1:27:44] Joshua smote them and slew them he said
[1:27:47] let me show you exactly how do you do it
[1:27:50] and you imagine a mighty I don't know
[1:27:51] about I don't know if you could picture
[1:27:53] this but imagine just a mighty warrior
[1:27:55] king who had power over you power over
[1:27:58] people and to see him laying on the
[1:28:01] ground with a foot on his
[1:28:04] neck guess what even a child could come
[1:28:07] up and kill
[1:28:09] him even a child in the in the word
[1:28:12] could come up and slay him why because
[1:28:14] he's been defeated
[1:28:16] already and this I'm going to tell you
[1:28:19] all this has already been done this is
[1:28:20] exactly brother what you just said if he
[1:28:23] would have died and went to the Grave
[1:28:26] it'd be a sad day but when he
[1:28:29] Rose when he rose he put his foot on the
[1:28:34] neck of the enemy that holds
[1:28:36] you and in and this entire time all the
[1:28:39] things you battle all the things I
[1:28:42] battle he's standing right there with
[1:28:44] his foot on the neck of that enemy
[1:28:46] saying come over here oh Lord I don't
[1:28:49] feel strong enough I know you're going
[1:28:52] going to feel strong after this you're
[1:28:53] going to feel Mighty after this because
[1:28:55] I've already done the work for you but I
[1:28:58] want you to come and I want you to kill
[1:29:00] this
[1:29:01] enemy and he says and he slew them and
[1:29:04] hang them on five trees and they were
[1:29:06] hanging upon the trees until the evening
[1:29:08] this is not just for
[1:29:10] ministers this is for
[1:29:12] you this is not just for the prophet of
[1:29:15] God who we believe in this is for you to
[1:29:18] do he went
[1:29:20] ahead and BL BL a trail what's the point
[1:29:23] of Blazing a trail if nobody's going to
[1:29:25] walk on that trail he went ahead and
[1:29:28] made a way where God was making a way
[1:29:31] through a man but he made a way so you
[1:29:33] and I could walk on that same path and
[1:29:35] those same enemies that
[1:29:37] seemed
[1:29:39] insurmountable well they seem like
[1:29:41] nothing when you see them
[1:29:43] defeated and I want to tell you that the
[1:29:48] enemy is under your
[1:29:50] foot
[1:29:53] you say it's one thing to picture him
[1:29:55] under Jesus's foot but he's actually
[1:29:57] under your
[1:29:59] foot why well where does where is
[1:30:03] Jesus right well where is Jesus at he
[1:30:07] doesn't have a as far as I know he
[1:30:09] doesn't have this a physical foot that
[1:30:11] he has down in the neck no he has my
[1:30:13] foot he has your foot I'm not strong
[1:30:15] enough to Shield you but if Jesus is
[1:30:19] here then that Shield holds up amen I'm
[1:30:23] not strong enough to defeat the Devil
[1:30:25] but if I have him now I'm at least the
[1:30:28] weakest Christian at the very least I'm
[1:30:30] the weakest Christian and and and he's
[1:30:33] trying to but he's trying I know how he
[1:30:35] works he's trying to disarm you even
[1:30:37] right now he's trying to disarm you you
[1:30:39] say that sounds
[1:30:40] good
[1:30:44] but but you don't know what I struggle
[1:30:47] with if you knew the things I struggle
[1:30:49] with I'm G tell you this I've seen it
[1:30:53] all and there's
[1:30:56] nothing that the Lord can
[1:30:59] overcome and I want to go a step further
[1:31:01] I've seen it all and there's nothing
[1:31:03] that you cannot
[1:31:06] overcome the weakest Christian with the
[1:31:10] most weaknesses the most failures the
[1:31:13] most battles can defeat the devil on any
[1:31:16] ground and any time on any
[1:31:19] condition that's not my word that's the
[1:31:22] word if it was mine you know you might
[1:31:24] not be able to take that to the bank
[1:31:26] brother Aaron but you can take the word
[1:31:27] to the
[1:31:29] bank but he wants to convince you that
[1:31:31] that's not
[1:31:32] true and uh there was
[1:31:34] another there's another quote he says
[1:31:36] and I want you to remember this this is
[1:31:38] for the weakest Christian that there is
[1:31:40] in the
[1:31:41] building you don't have to have
[1:31:49] gifts I was going to say that again you
[1:31:51] do not have have to have
[1:31:54] gifts you don't have to wait until some
[1:31:57] person comes by who prays for the
[1:32:01] sick he says and I'll go on record
[1:32:03] because there's a tape recorder taking
[1:32:05] it here and I'll say this and we know
[1:32:07] this I think we know this quote the
[1:32:08] right mental attitude towards any Divine
[1:32:12] promise of God will bring it to pass if
[1:32:14] you can get the right mental attitude
[1:32:16] towards that promise let's let's let's
[1:32:19] go over to another scripture here in
[1:32:20] Genesis
[1:32:24] doing it right on time
[1:32:27] okay I always tell myself I'm going to
[1:32:29] look at the clock and then it's right in
[1:32:31] front of me and I always forget I
[1:32:32] genuinely forget I I apologize let's go
[1:32:35] over to Genesis 14 I want to maybe just
[1:32:38] on on on the on
[1:32:40] the change turn a little bit of a corner
[1:32:44] but I want to just talk about practical
[1:32:48] application of this that's one thing to
[1:32:52] hear you can do it and it's another
[1:32:54] thing to go do
[1:32:56] it right I think most of the time we we
[1:33:00] leave church I mean I hope I hope so
[1:33:01] anyways we leave church feeling pretty
[1:33:05] good sometimes you're a little bit
[1:33:07] sometimes the Lord comes and you know
[1:33:09] scour you out a little bit and cleans
[1:33:10] out but overall I think we we leave
[1:33:13] church feeling I I hope we do
[1:33:16] encouraged and we we leave church
[1:33:18] feeling like I'm goingon to go do this
[1:33:20] right and then I would say Monday
[1:33:22] morning but sometimes Sunday afternoon
[1:33:24] hit you right in the face right
[1:33:27] sometimes right on the way home it hits
[1:33:30] you and the thing that you just heard
[1:33:33] and the thing that you just learned you
[1:33:34] forget to apply it and then Satan comes
[1:33:36] and goes see you're not a soldier see
[1:33:39] that message wasn't for you you're
[1:33:42] weak what are you going to
[1:33:45] do what are you gonna
[1:33:49] do take him back to the
[1:33:53] word I know it
[1:33:55] sounds it sounds
[1:33:57] cliche but if that's the weapon you've
[1:34:00] been given then use
[1:34:02] it if that's the weapon I've been given
[1:34:04] then use the weapon you might be you
[1:34:07] might be clumsy with
[1:34:08] it not everybody just picks up a sword
[1:34:11] and knows how to swing it skillfully and
[1:34:13] block you might be terrible at it but
[1:34:16] but that sword can defeat
[1:34:20] him yeah you don't have to be eloquent
[1:34:23] you don't have to know exactly where the
[1:34:24] quote is or where the scripture you just
[1:34:26] say you know what this is what I heard
[1:34:27] today I heard that I could be I am weak
[1:34:30] you know what you're right I am weak but
[1:34:32] I could still defeat
[1:34:33] you and that might seem clumsy that
[1:34:36] might seem awkward guess what and I'll
[1:34:38] read it to you he's afraid of somebody
[1:34:41] who wields a sword like
[1:34:43] that because they are somebody who's
[1:34:46] coming into their position as a
[1:34:49] soldier maybe they haven't fought a 100
[1:34:51] battles but it only takes one battle to
[1:34:53] defeat
[1:34:55] him and over here in Genesis let's read
[1:34:58] in 14 I read about we we talked about
[1:35:00] these five Kings over here I want to
[1:35:02] read about four more
[1:35:04] Kings and I just thought this was really
[1:35:06] interesting because of I don't think
[1:35:08] there's any coincidences in the Bible I
[1:35:11] think even your name matters and I just
[1:35:13] went into a little bit of a study on
[1:35:14] what the the names of some of these
[1:35:16] Kings meant and it was like it just the
[1:35:18] Bible just opened up to me verse um
[1:35:21] Genesis 14 we'll start with verse 9 and
[1:35:23] I I know I want to keep you so I'm going
[1:35:24] to skip a few verses here verse 9 now
[1:35:27] I'm I'm I'm going to admit I don't know
[1:35:29] how to pronounce most of these
[1:35:31] names so if you forgive me for a lot of
[1:35:34] things one of them is going to be my
[1:35:35] pronunciation of them but cedor Lor is
[1:35:39] how I would say that the king of Elum
[1:35:42] with tidle the king of Nations amrel the
[1:35:45] king of shinar and arot king of elisar
[1:35:48] Four Kings with the five verse 12 and
[1:35:51] they took took lot Abraham's brother's
[1:35:53] son who dwelt in Sodom and his goods and
[1:35:57] they departed and I love this scripture
[1:35:59] in verse 14 now I know this I just point
[1:36:03] this out because it's really simple but
[1:36:04] Abraham's brother's son what would that
[1:36:06] what is lot to him his nephew right
[1:36:09] Abraham's brother's son but yet in verse
[1:36:12] 14 when Abraham heard that his brother
[1:36:16] was taken
[1:36:18] captive see lot was no longer his nephew
[1:36:22] you know what lot was he was a soldier
[1:36:25] right next to
[1:36:26] him my brother has been taken my sister
[1:36:31] has been
[1:36:32] taken we have some we we need to get out
[1:36:34] of this I say we me included but just I
[1:36:38] I see this in so many churches we need
[1:36:39] to get out of the attitude of my church
[1:36:42] my group my congregation no no no no if
[1:36:45] someone else across town or across a
[1:36:47] state or another state has been taken by
[1:36:49] the enemy if you're you're a soldier of
[1:36:52] God you will say no no my brother's been
[1:36:54] taken my sister's been taken and I'm not
[1:36:57] just going to let that slide I'm not
[1:37:00] anybody I'm not Mighty but you know what
[1:37:02] that's not going to happen because I'm a
[1:37:05] soldier and they're a soldier and and
[1:37:08] I've swore an oath to serve under a
[1:37:10] commander and so have they and guess
[1:37:12] what that makes us
[1:37:13] equal maybe I'm maybe I'm a 10-year
[1:37:16] veteran and they're they're a new
[1:37:19] convert maybe I'm a new convert and
[1:37:20] they're a 20-year veteran in the army
[1:37:22] they cannot be taken without me going
[1:37:25] and pursuing that enemy and again if we
[1:37:27] have that mentality where Church
[1:37:29] boundaries don't matter and church
[1:37:32] attendance don't matter I'm just going
[1:37:33] to say it because I know it's true when
[1:37:35] those things stop mattering anymore and
[1:37:37] all of our doctrines that we have when
[1:37:38] they don't matter anymore and we can
[1:37:40] look across to a Believer and say you're
[1:37:42] a soldier and I'm a soldier I have
[1:37:45] weaknesses and you have weaknesses which
[1:37:47] means I can be wrong and am wrong and
[1:37:49] you are wrong if if we both can
[1:37:51] recognize that I got my shield and I'm
[1:37:54] going to go stand next to
[1:37:56] you and guess what if I'm standing next
[1:37:58] to you with my shield I believe that
[1:38:00] God's going to provide someone else to
[1:38:02] come and stand next to me sure I could
[1:38:04] call up brother Aaron and I could tell
[1:38:06] you all about it brother Aaron oh you
[1:38:08] know brother so and so this and you know
[1:38:09] what he believes but instead I could go
[1:38:12] and put a shield up next to you and if
[1:38:15] we do that
[1:38:17] worldwide it's an Unstoppable
[1:38:20] Army
[1:38:21] and I going to tell you this I believe
[1:38:24] the bride will do
[1:38:26] that it's not just a hopeful I hope that
[1:38:29] we do this I hope we no no I believe
[1:38:31] that God is training and pushing and
[1:38:35] showing us exactly how to do that
[1:38:37] because that's the kind of bride he's
[1:38:40] going to
[1:38:41] Rapture he's not going to Rapture a
[1:38:43] bride who is disjointed who doesn't
[1:38:46] doesn't get now do we have to agree in
[1:38:48] everything I can guarantee you that we
[1:38:51] all in this room don't agree 100% on
[1:38:53] everything and yet we're sitting here
[1:38:55] right yet we're brothers and sisters
[1:38:58] we're not going to agree upon everything
[1:38:59] but if I know despite maybe something I
[1:39:01] disagree with you I'm going to stand
[1:39:03] right next to you and my Shield's up and
[1:39:06] maybe sometimes our disagreements are
[1:39:08] just a different
[1:39:11] perspective right that thing that I'm so
[1:39:13] sure that I'm right on no there is not a
[1:39:16] cross on the front of this Pulpit that
[1:39:18] thing that I just I know I know I know
[1:39:21] God might put me in a
[1:39:24] situation probably against my will let's
[1:39:28] be honest that drags me around to where
[1:39:32] I can see things from your point of
[1:39:34] view and vice
[1:39:38] versa let's read about these Four
[1:39:43] Kings these these Four Kings now now now
[1:39:46] he goes on in in in 14 he says and when
[1:39:48] Abraham heard they took the brother
[1:39:49] captive he armed
[1:39:53] who his
[1:39:55] Warriors
[1:39:57] nope you know what he took
[1:40:00] servants train servants
[1:40:02] brother guess what I can be that I can
[1:40:06] be a
[1:40:07] servant I don't consider myself one of
[1:40:09] these these powerful ministers I don't
[1:40:11] consider myself an apostle or an Evangel
[1:40:14] I could be a trained servant I can do
[1:40:16] that I could be the weakest Christian
[1:40:19] that's who he took
[1:40:22] born in his own house 318 and pursued
[1:40:24] them under Dan and he divided himself
[1:40:26] against them him and his servants by
[1:40:28] night and smoke
[1:40:32] them and he brought back all the goods
[1:40:34] and also brought back again his brother
[1:40:37] lot and his goods and his women also and
[1:40:40] the people when when you go up against
[1:40:42] the devil when you go to rescue somebody
[1:40:45] guess what you get everything
[1:40:48] back there is not a single thing that
[1:40:51] the devil is entitled
[1:40:53] to I I don't care what it is you know a
[1:40:55] lot of times we we we'll give up
[1:40:56] something to well you know the devil he
[1:40:59] gets his shot in the devil's not
[1:41:00] entitled to anything he's not entitled
[1:41:02] to your goods he's not entitled I want
[1:41:05] to tell you this he's not entitled to
[1:41:06] your
[1:41:07] thoughts he's not entitled to those well
[1:41:10] we live in a body of Flesh I I I I
[1:41:12] recognize that I recognize we're humans
[1:41:14] but he's not entitled to those things
[1:41:16] and you don't need to give that
[1:41:17] territory to him he's not entitled to
[1:41:20] your time your thoughts your money your
[1:41:23] fellowship your prayer he's not entitled
[1:41:25] to any of those things and when God when
[1:41:27] you have a revelation of that drop and
[1:41:29] you go after the enemy you realize no no
[1:41:31] no I'm going to take back my time that
[1:41:33] you've been taken up I'm going to take
[1:41:36] back my thoughts that you've been taken
[1:41:38] up I'm going to take that back my family
[1:41:40] oh well they're not Believers I don't
[1:41:42] care if they're Believers you're not
[1:41:44] entitled to them I'm going to take them
[1:41:46] back that's right oh your own weaknesses
[1:41:50] I'm sorry but you're not not entitled to
[1:41:51] those those are mine that's right I know
[1:41:54] this is I know maybe this is just basic
[1:41:56] but I tell you this is where the devil
[1:41:58] tricks us he tricks us into thinking oh
[1:42:00] no those belong to me and so if they
[1:42:02] belong to me I have a little peace in
[1:42:04] your life no you don't have a peace in
[1:42:07] my life you don't have any territory in
[1:42:10] my
[1:42:11] land it's my land it was given to me my
[1:42:13] family they're my family you don't have
[1:42:16] a place in there well you know there
[1:42:18] they have weaknesses I don't care I'm
[1:42:21] the weakest Christian and I can send you
[1:42:23] running and Abraham here we could say a
[1:42:26] lot of things about lot right we could
[1:42:28] say a lot of things about him if you
[1:42:29] read his read his life but Abraham said
[1:42:32] oh no you don't get anything of lots you
[1:42:35] don't get you don't get his family you
[1:42:37] don't get his Goods you don't get his
[1:42:39] land you get nothing I'm taking it all
[1:42:41] back and these Kings and I just want to
[1:42:43] go into this and we're we'll we'll close
[1:42:45] on this but these Kings this first one
[1:42:47] it says his name is tidal I'm not going
[1:42:49] to have these in any particular order
[1:42:51] but I wanted to go into what they mean
[1:42:53] because I want you to know how the enemy
[1:42:54] attacks you which I'm sure you know but
[1:42:56] may maybe just a reminder this word this
[1:42:59] this King his name means
[1:43:04] fearfulness now I want you to know the
[1:43:06] enemy that not only has already been
[1:43:09] defeated but but but your foot your foot
[1:43:13] is on his
[1:43:14] neck he's already been
[1:43:16] defeated fearfulness that's what his
[1:43:19] name means and that's one of the
[1:43:21] greatest weapons that the devil has
[1:43:23] against us is
[1:43:25] fear and and and it's again it goes back
[1:43:28] to that if he can get you to disbelieve
[1:43:30] if he can get you to fear he's disarming
[1:43:33] you um brother R says this there's many
[1:43:37] that pretend to be in there there's many
[1:43:39] Waring themselves anybody ever feel like
[1:43:42] that everybody feel like the greatest
[1:43:44] enemy you have is
[1:43:47] you I think if we're human beings that's
[1:43:49] probably how we feel there's many that's
[1:43:52] Waring themsel and trying to live right
[1:43:55] and trying to press
[1:44:00] in he says but if they're in there it's
[1:44:03] just as easy to live a Christian Life as
[1:44:06] it is to live any life because you're in
[1:44:10] Christ and nothing else but the full of
[1:44:13] the Holy Spirit lead you and guide you
[1:44:15] and direct you and sure you'll make
[1:44:19] mistakes
[1:44:22] yes sure you'll make mistakes and
[1:44:26] fall but you can't stay
[1:44:29] down no more than you can make a stock
[1:44:32] of corn into a sycamore tree you can't
[1:44:36] do it Jesus said by their fruits you
[1:44:37] shall know them you have everlasting
[1:44:40] life and one of the greatest curses on
[1:44:42] the church today is fear Everybody's
[1:44:45] scared to death what's going to happen
[1:44:48] who and what and Jesus said even when
[1:44:51] the fearful sights
[1:44:53] come lift up your head and rejoice for
[1:44:57] great your Redemption is drawing nigh
[1:44:59] when these things
[1:45:01] happen like we see in this day and age
[1:45:05] and he says in Divine love and Sovereign
[1:45:07] Grace the reason you're fearful is
[1:45:10] because the right Temperance of love has
[1:45:12] never entered
[1:45:16] yet you think that the way to combat
[1:45:19] fear is Cur
[1:45:21] courage but he says the way to combat
[1:45:23] fear is
[1:45:26] love love for my brother and sister
[1:45:30] although I see their
[1:45:33] weaknesses in spite of me seeing their
[1:45:36] weaknesses when there is real
[1:45:39] love all fear passes
[1:45:42] away that's what he
[1:45:44] says and I and I don't know where I
[1:45:47] heard this from it might have been from
[1:45:49] um I think it was in discussion we were
[1:45:50] at up in Flag step but Be not Afraid is
[1:45:54] in the Bible
[1:45:56] 365
[1:45:58] times one for every day brother Aaron
[1:46:02] every single day there is a new
[1:46:05] scripture with Be not Afraid in
[1:46:07] it which to me is just it's it's a it's
[1:46:11] a it's a fulfillment of his Mercy is new
[1:46:16] every
[1:46:17] morning and God whenever he even in this
[1:46:20] scripture Joshua is saying hey come over
[1:46:23] here don't be afraid don't be
[1:46:27] afraid and I I thought about
[1:46:30] this if Satan can inflict you with fear
[1:46:35] we can agree that he could do
[1:46:37] that then where does where does Fear
[1:46:40] come
[1:46:41] from from him if fear comes from the
[1:46:46] devil that tells me he's
[1:46:49] afraid
[1:46:51] if he can try to put fear onto you now I
[1:46:54] know this might see so simplistic and
[1:46:56] maybe just but think about it if the
[1:46:59] devil has the ability to put fear on you
[1:47:02] then he has
[1:47:04] fear what he's trying to do is just
[1:47:06] trying to get you to take on his fear
[1:47:09] you to take on his fear because listen
[1:47:12] he knows the word and he knows what his
[1:47:14] end
[1:47:15] is he knows what his end is and guess
[1:47:18] what though he is afraid of that
[1:47:21] end I don't care what he says he's
[1:47:23] afraid of his end and what he wants to
[1:47:26] do is he wants to put his fear on you so
[1:47:29] that you're afraid and he gets a little
[1:47:31] bit of
[1:47:32] Peace but he doesn't have any peace and
[1:47:34] and all these scriptures all these
[1:47:37] quotes should be reinforcing the fact
[1:47:40] that you put fear into
[1:47:42] Satan he is afraid of the weakest
[1:47:45] Christian he is afraid of a trained
[1:47:49] servant in the house of a mighty man
[1:47:51] he's it's not even the Mighty Man a
[1:47:53] trained servant in the house of the
[1:47:55] mighty man he's afraid of
[1:47:56] him that's you that's me at
[1:48:01] least now I'm not I don't know where
[1:48:03] you're at and maybe you're mightier than
[1:48:05] that but I tell you I can be the weakest
[1:48:06] Christian I can be
[1:48:09] that and and he just brother Ram says
[1:48:12] this I'm trying to hurry and close here
[1:48:14] he says
[1:48:15] regardless of how little we
[1:48:18] are so so if you thought you were little
[1:48:21] you can just throw that out regardless
[1:48:23] of how little we are or how low we
[1:48:29] are or how impure we
[1:48:33] are or how Unholy we
[1:48:37] are how sick we
[1:48:40] are or how Afflicted we
[1:48:44] are that should cover everything right
[1:48:47] there the law of God's spirit Spirit by
[1:48:50] his word makes it obey him and forces
[1:48:54] the issue and says give it back and if
[1:48:58] we could just think about that for a
[1:49:00] minute it forces it regardless of the
[1:49:02] condition no matter what the condition
[1:49:05] is the law of God's word forces the
[1:49:07] condition to cope with its word with his
[1:49:10] word it's got
[1:49:13] to this this other king chador LaMore
[1:49:17] his me his name means the one who binds
[1:49:22] you and I don't know about I don't know
[1:49:24] your life I don't know about you I don't
[1:49:27] know you
[1:49:29] personally but I know that people are
[1:49:32] bound with a lot of
[1:49:34] things and we just start just right at
[1:49:37] the obvious ones
[1:49:40] addictions we're bound a lot of times by
[1:49:43] addictions and when I mean bound means
[1:49:45] we feel powerless against them we feel
[1:49:48] like they control us not we control
[1:49:52] them that's what that's this King he
[1:49:55] literally represents that thing that
[1:49:57] binds
[1:49:58] you and the problem is is that that King
[1:50:02] has been
[1:50:05] killed it's been killed already so the
[1:50:08] thing that binds you is already dead and
[1:50:12] defeated what does it take to to realize
[1:50:15] that is that we need to be
[1:50:18] trained we need to be trained servants
[1:50:20] and in order to be trained servants we
[1:50:22] need to spend time in the
[1:50:25] word the word and the message is not
[1:50:29] it's not just for a minister to
[1:50:33] study if you're relying on the minister
[1:50:36] to study the word for you and to preach
[1:50:38] you the
[1:50:39] word you're not doing your due diligence
[1:50:42] as a
[1:50:44] soldier every one of us should be in
[1:50:46] this
[1:50:47] word being a trained servant and that
[1:50:50] way you know when when maybe the a
[1:50:52] minister or the pastor something says
[1:50:54] you know I need I need some I need a
[1:50:56] couple people to go and pray with me
[1:50:57] guess what you've been
[1:50:59] training I'm not saying you're going to
[1:51:01] be Mighty but you could be the weakest
[1:51:03] Christian you say you know what I I've
[1:51:05] been training a little bit and I'm not
[1:51:06] anything great but I I know enough to
[1:51:08] keep the devil running I'm going to go
[1:51:10] with you and I'm going to
[1:51:14] pray but do we train every
[1:51:17] day do we prepare do we spend time in
[1:51:20] prayer I I had to ask myself the same
[1:51:23] thing and and sometimes I don't like
[1:51:25] that answer but we have to we have to
[1:51:28] prioritize that and God said he says
[1:51:31] this he says I believe the most
[1:51:32] important thing in any life is to
[1:51:34] entertain Jesus Christ
[1:51:37] properly in the first place in your
[1:51:39] worship first place in your life first
[1:51:42] place in Everything Jesus Christ
[1:51:44] deserves that place I believe with all
[1:51:46] my heart but if you don't he'll take
[1:51:49] second place
[1:51:52] he'll go down in the basement with you
[1:51:54] if you're ashamed of him when you go
[1:51:56] among the people and you go down in the
[1:51:58] basement to see him he'll still
[1:52:01] come that ought to make you love him
[1:52:04] above everything else in the world Jesus
[1:52:06] in second place Jesus in fourth place in
[1:52:10] 10th place but he'll still come when you
[1:52:12] invite
[1:52:15] him and see I think what it is is
[1:52:17] sometimes we're not bound by Satan we're
[1:52:20] Bound by
[1:52:22] ourself we're Bound by ourself and I I I
[1:52:25] I don't just talk about addictions we're
[1:52:27] Bound by our
[1:52:28] religion we're Bound by our our uh
[1:52:31] whether it be cold and formal and
[1:52:33] starchy or on fire screaming and running
[1:52:36] sometimes we're Bound by our own
[1:52:39] religion if you don't believe it like
[1:52:41] this oh you're guess what you're binding
[1:52:43] yourself to a religion well if you don't
[1:52:46] just believe it the way I believe if you
[1:52:48] don't worship like oh if you don't if if
[1:52:49] you get up and shout there's something
[1:52:51] wrong with you if you don't get up and
[1:52:53] shout there's something wrong with you
[1:52:54] we're binding ourself by our own
[1:52:57] thoughts and our own religion and our
[1:52:59] own know really it's our own it's our
[1:53:02] own religion it's not God's religion
[1:53:05] it's our own idea of what church should
[1:53:06] be and and you know he says brother BR
[1:53:10] says in both places that just
[1:53:12] because you jump and shout and make a
[1:53:14] lot of noise doesn't mean you have
[1:53:17] it we we all read that and then he says
[1:53:20] in other places if the spirit moves
[1:53:22] through the congregation and you sit
[1:53:25] still it means there's no life in
[1:53:28] you so I don't have to take
[1:53:31] one and throw out the other one I can
[1:53:35] take both I can take both and I tell you
[1:53:38] that sounds really simple but that's
[1:53:40] that is the battle you want to know what
[1:53:43] the battle is in our time is to be in
[1:53:45] the middle of the road it's to be able
[1:53:48] to take this side and this side and come
[1:53:52] into the middle and I believe that was
[1:53:53] brother bram's purpose his ministry he
[1:53:56] even said he goes you Brothers over here
[1:54:00] and you Brothers over here you actually
[1:54:01] believe the same thing and you don't
[1:54:03] even know it he goes and what I have
[1:54:05] been sent here to do is to grab you by
[1:54:08] the hand and grab you by the hand and
[1:54:10] join you in the middle as a unified
[1:54:14] church and and we we hear unified church
[1:54:18] and immediately think oh that's the the
[1:54:20] World Council of churches you know
[1:54:22] that's just an imitation of what the
[1:54:24] bride will be doing say there is going
[1:54:26] to be a unified Church of the world but
[1:54:29] that's only he he can't create that's
[1:54:31] not his idea he can only pervert what he
[1:54:34] knows is going to happen anytime you see
[1:54:36] that happening oh well then there must
[1:54:38] be a genuine dollar bill if there's a
[1:54:40] counterfeit dollar bill out there if the
[1:54:42] world is uniting together against the
[1:54:45] church guess what the church is going to
[1:54:47] be
[1:54:48] United and we we're going to come from
[1:54:50] all different backgrounds and all
[1:54:51] different thoughts and all different
[1:54:52] doctrines and some might see a cross and
[1:54:54] some might see no cross but if we unite
[1:54:59] together and if you have the Holy Spirit
[1:55:02] guess what you don't have a
[1:55:05] choice I hate to say that but if you
[1:55:08] have the Holy Ghost living inside of
[1:55:09] your heart the Holy Ghost isn't going to
[1:55:11] disagree with the Holy
[1:55:13] Ghost the Holy Ghost isn't going to
[1:55:15] disagree with the word and that that's
[1:55:18] what I want I don't want it to be up to
[1:55:20] me brothers and sisters if it's up to me
[1:55:22] I'm going to fail I'm going to tell you
[1:55:25] what to do and if it's up to this flesh
[1:55:27] I'm going to go out and it won't be a
[1:55:29] day or a week from now be like ah
[1:55:30] brother so and so sister but the Holy
[1:55:33] Ghost if I let that govern my life if I
[1:55:37] let that take over that does the work
[1:55:39] for
[1:55:40] me it's the surrender that we have to do
[1:55:43] as a
[1:55:45] soldier you got time for you got time
[1:55:47] for two more we got five minutes brother
[1:55:50] arok says this other king like a
[1:55:56] lion I love this because that is the
[1:55:59] definition of his name like a lion but
[1:56:02] he is not a
[1:56:04] lion he's like
[1:56:06] one the Bible says I don't want to
[1:56:09] misquote it but the Bible says he's
[1:56:12] going around roaring as a
[1:56:16] lion what does that tell you he is he's
[1:56:19] a bluff
[1:56:21] even when he attacks you he doesn't have
[1:56:25] power he operates through fear through
[1:56:29] your own your own knowledge of your own
[1:56:32] weaknesses and he gets you to give him
[1:56:37] power that's what he does he doesn't
[1:56:39] have power he's on the ground with your
[1:56:42] foot on his neck but if he can just
[1:56:44] convince you to just lift up that foot a
[1:56:46] little bit and give him back some life
[1:56:49] give him back some
[1:56:51] power he says this brother brandom
[1:56:53] Witnesses that's the way the devil will
[1:56:55] do he'll let you build up a little bit
[1:56:57] of something and then come and knock the
[1:56:58] props out from under you and the reason
[1:57:01] is you let them do
[1:57:03] it there's just nothing like the word of
[1:57:06] God because he just calls it what it is
[1:57:07] you let him do it he's just a bluff and
[1:57:10] he has no legal right he says if you've
[1:57:13] got an experience of God of the
[1:57:14] resurrection of Jesus Christ then he
[1:57:17] strips Satan of every privilege that he
[1:57:20] has and robbed him of everything he had
[1:57:24] took it away from him yes sir he robbed
[1:57:26] him and stripped it and gave the power
[1:57:29] it doesn't say to the ministry it
[1:57:31] doesn't say to the prophet although we
[1:57:33] believe in those things he says he gave
[1:57:35] the power to the church you have the
[1:57:39] power to defeat
[1:57:41] Satan now go do the same things I did he
[1:57:44] says that's right he took the sword out
[1:57:47] of Satan's hand and put it in your
[1:57:50] hand you know you fight a devil that has
[1:57:53] no
[1:57:55] sword oh brother he knows the word you
[1:57:58] know he knows the
[1:58:00] letter real well he knows this letter
[1:58:04] better than you and better than I and
[1:58:06] you could pick up a message book and he
[1:58:07] knows that better than you I but he
[1:58:09] doesn't have the word because it takes
[1:58:11] the Holy Spirit to make this the word
[1:58:14] without the holy spirit this is not life
[1:58:16] this is
[1:58:18] death but if you have the Holy Spirit it
[1:58:20] quickens this
[1:58:22] word and and he doesn't have the ability
[1:58:26] to place the word where it belongs he
[1:58:29] goes and does battle with Jesus in the
[1:58:30] wilderness and he's quoting the word to
[1:58:33] him but he doesn't know where to place
[1:58:35] it he's taking word out of out of Psalms
[1:58:39] and he's saying oh surely if you're cast
[1:58:41] down the angels will sweep you up and
[1:58:42] Jesus is like you don't even know what
[1:58:44] you're talking about it's also written
[1:58:47] and he takes them to the word
[1:58:50] amen that's the way it is every time a
[1:58:52] good meeting started some hypocrite will
[1:58:54] come in and say days and miracles has
[1:58:55] passed might as well stop this he says
[1:58:58] that's the devil anytime you get the
[1:59:00] church going good somebody slips in and
[1:59:02] says oh that's just all enthusiasm
[1:59:04] that's just worked up that's fanaticism
[1:59:06] that's the way they do it same old
[1:59:08] robbers old Philistines coming right
[1:59:10] back that's exactly right and he's
[1:59:11] talking about shamgar in this which I I
[1:59:13] just love that story because shamgar is
[1:59:15] a perfect picture of you and
[1:59:18] I
[1:59:19] that we don't maybe think much of oursel
[1:59:21] right we don't think we're this Great
[1:59:23] Mighty Warrior shamgar was a
[1:59:27] farmer and he just got tired of year
[1:59:30] after year after year the Philistines
[1:59:31] coming in he says his righteous
[1:59:34] indonation got up here they were big
[1:59:36] heavy armor what did he do he says I'm
[1:59:38] an Israelite you know what he was saying
[1:59:41] I'm the weakest
[1:59:42] Soldier I could be at least that in
[1:59:45] other words he's like he says right here
[1:59:46] I'm not a warrior I'm not a fighter and
[1:59:48] there's nothing I can do but I know one
[1:59:51] thing that God's with me that's all I
[1:59:53] know and he reached up and got an old Ox
[1:59:56] goat a stick with a piece of brass on it
[1:59:59] and he jumped out there under the power
[2:00:00] of God of the Holy Ghost knowing he had
[2:00:04] the right and slew 600
[2:00:09] Philistines and that last one is that
[2:00:11] last king is the one who accuses you and
[2:00:13] I know he does
[2:00:15] this he says you're not forgiven
[2:00:21] I mean you I don't I don't know if he
[2:00:23] tells you that you're weak you're
[2:00:26] worthless you're not
[2:00:28] strong God hasn't forgiven you God
[2:00:30] doesn't hear your prayer how about you
[2:00:33] you're sick because you deserve to be
[2:00:35] sick you're bound by addiction because
[2:00:38] you deserve to be bound by that
[2:00:39] addiction you fall down and you fail
[2:00:43] because God isn't with
[2:00:45] you you're
[2:00:47] suffering because of you
[2:00:50] um you're no good you're a s I'll just
[2:00:52] go go down the list you're a sinner
[2:00:53] you're a failure you don't have enough
[2:00:56] Faith you're not in the bride you don't
[2:00:58] deserve forgiveness God doesn't hear you
[2:01:00] God doesn't see you God doesn't know
[2:01:03] you that's the
[2:01:06] accuser and and when presented with this
[2:01:09] Jesus says when the woman is brought to
[2:01:11] him caught in the very Act of sin he
[2:01:14] asks her a question he says Where have
[2:01:15] your accusers
[2:01:17] gone why because he had already defeated
[2:01:20] them with what the
[2:01:22] word and he looked around and he says
[2:01:25] and I don't accuse you
[2:01:34] either and I didn't I didn't have this
[2:01:37] this I had this quote written down maybe
[2:01:38] a few weeks ago but it but when we when
[2:01:41] I was hearing that testimony sister
[2:01:42] Martha just it just came to my mind he
[2:01:44] says he defeated Satan on the word of
[2:01:47] God and it shows no matter what you can
[2:01:49] defeat Satan on the word of God it'll
[2:01:52] defeat him any place anywhere in any
[2:01:54] condition if it's in the belly of the
[2:01:55] whale or if it's in a lion's den or if
[2:01:59] it's laying on a bed with
[2:02:03] cancer weeks ago sister Marth I had this
[2:02:05] written down if it's laying on a bed
[2:02:07] with cancer or if it's laying Yonder
[2:02:09] bleeding to
[2:02:12] death the word of God will defeat Satan
[2:02:15] anywhere and the weakest Christian can
[2:02:18] use it because it's your god-given
[2:02:21] privilege to use
[2:02:23] it amen God bless
[2:02:26] [Applause]
[2:02:35] you amen thank you for the the extra
[2:02:38] time I appreciate that I I actually
[2:02:40] don't know how long I went but I'm sure
[2:02:43] it was more than I more than I was
[2:02:44] allotted so we appreciate
[2:02:47] it bless you take a moment and go put in
[2:02:51] front of
[2:02:54] that oh it is
[2:02:57] there I guess I guess you're on the word

[2:03:11] and knowing we' been ministering tonight

[2:03:27] confusion brother Ed we sang a song If I
