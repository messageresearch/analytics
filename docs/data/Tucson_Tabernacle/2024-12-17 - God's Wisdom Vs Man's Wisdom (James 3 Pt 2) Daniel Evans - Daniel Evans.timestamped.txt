[12:57] Glorious Day
[13:00] oh glorious
[13:04] day um I wanted to mention to I I
[13:07] mentioned it to the
[13:09] Musicians there's been a uh on Sunday
[13:13] night and
[13:15] Wednesday I don't know if I'm sure
[13:17] you've noticed it but the Lord has
[13:19] really been his Spirit has been
[13:23] present and it's just been wonderful I
[13:26] mean it was with brother Lyle brother
[13:28] Lyall was was ministering on Wednesday
[13:30] and I just I felt this
[13:32] anointing on him and and with our
[13:34] worship service last Sunday I mean we
[13:37] did pray for a long time and then and
[13:40] then we come and then the the beautiful
[13:42] worship after service on Sunday night I
[13:46] I've just been so blessed and I I really
[13:48] I expect the same tonight I always
[13:52] expect the Lord Lord to do something and
[13:55] and he always does it may not be what I
[13:58] expect but but he does always do
[14:00] something so I I do have I have high
[14:04] expectations for tonight a very short
[14:07] sermon I want to finish James chapter
[14:10] 3
[14:12] um really James talks about he differ
[14:15] differentiates between the wisdom of
[14:19] God um Godly wisdom and Earthly WIS
[14:23] wisdom which is the wisdom of man and he
[14:25] calls this wisdom of man he calls it
[14:28] devilish and and sensual and this Godly
[14:33] wisdom is is what we're striving for
[14:36] before we get to our scripture I want to
[14:39] give a couple examples of Godly
[14:43] wisdom and Earthly wisdom and these for
[14:47] were from two brothers in the Bible
[14:50] they're half Brothers um one is David
[14:55] both of them their fathers was King
[14:57] David and that is is this young man
[15:00] Solomon Solomon sought for Godly wisdom
[15:04] and the other is this young man named
[15:08] absolum um
[15:11] Solomon David had passed away and he
[15:14] left the kingdom to uh to Solomon his
[15:18] son and Solomon did everything that he
[15:21] knew how to to do things right and do
[15:25] things according to God's word and he
[15:28] couldn't offer off sacrifice in the
[15:30] temple which is what God wanted because
[15:32] there was no Temple yet so what they did
[15:35] what Solomon did is is he brought his
[15:39] sacrifice to what we see in the Bible
[15:42] that's called the high places now we
[15:45] know from reading our Bibles that these
[15:47] high places are generally where idolatry
[15:50] took place and where um they sacrific
[15:53] things to Idols but this young man
[15:56] Solomon he really he wanted to do things
[15:59] right and he thought well the best way
[16:02] that I can do right is I can go to this
[16:05] high place which seems to me the most
[16:07] spiritual place that I know of and we
[16:10] can make our sacrifice there
[16:14] Solomon his young heart was
[16:17] right and what he did is he brought he
[16:22] went to this place and not only did he
[16:25] want to go to a high place he wanted to
[16:27] go to the highest place he wanted to go
[16:30] to the most spiritual place that he
[16:33] could find to offer this sacrifice and I
[16:37] believe it was a thousand animals that
[16:39] he was going to sacrifice so he goes he
[16:42] goes
[16:43] up to do this sacrifice and he
[16:47] sacrifices all all of these animals
[16:50] according to what he believed was the
[16:52] word of God and as I said Solomon's
[16:56] heart was right in all of this I look
[17:00] back
[17:01] at Stephanie and I and raising our
[17:05] children and I was a pretty
[17:09] hard I guess today I would call call it
[17:13] legalistic
[17:14] Dad and I uh we had the the thing that
[17:18] we always had in a bond in our family is
[17:21] we always had such
[17:22] love and we would we would spend each
[17:26] evening together and and uh just talk
[17:30] about things and we would have our Bible
[17:32] studies and we would have our devotions
[17:34] and and the kids would would play their
[17:36] instruments Daniel would play his guitar
[17:38] and meline would play either the piano
[17:40] or mandolin and they'd fight and i' I'd
[17:43] get on them you know it's like kids
[17:44] we're playing chrisan music don't be
[17:45] fighting daddy he's doing it
[17:48] wrong it's supposed to be Daddy She's
[17:51] Doing It Wrong supposed to be in this
[17:52] key and that key boy they would fight I
[17:54] just I would I'd always it would get so
[17:57] bad and they start playing really loud
[18:00] and and and going back and forth and I
[18:02] just start singing peace peace
[18:06] wonderful peace and they
[18:09] just they settle
[18:12] down and it would bring a calmness but
[18:15] we had that love as a family and I look
[18:20] back and on the way to church this
[18:23] morning my wife and I were talking and
[18:27] and we would probably do things
[18:30] differently than we did
[18:32] before and Stephanie said this she said
[18:35] but our heart was
[18:37] right and we did I mean I was I mean
[18:40] there was no TV in my house there were
[18:43] no movies there was no I mean there was
[18:45] there was Bible movies and there was
[18:47] there was no Halloween there was no
[18:49] Sports there was no other youth camps
[18:52] except for our sect um of the message
[18:55] that we were part of there was no other
[18:56] churches there were no other kids no
[18:59] other friends outside of our little
[19:02] group and we were doing the best there
[19:03] wasn't even neighbor kids the kids
[19:04] weren't even allowed to hang out with
[19:06] the neighbor kids we protected them as
[19:09] much as we
[19:11] could and if I had it to do all over I
[19:14] would probably do it different I might
[19:17] send them to more youth camps I
[19:19] might be um a little bit more easygoing
[19:25] because when the kids hit the place
[19:29] of um when they got old enough and they
[19:32] started doing the teenager thing they
[19:35] strayed just like any other
[19:38] kids and I remember it was a a roote
[19:41] Awakening for Stephanie and me and we
[19:44] were just like what did we do wrong we
[19:47] tried to do everything just perfectly we
[19:50] tried to follow every single rule we
[19:52] tried to do everything according to what
[19:55] we thought was right and yet we failed
[20:00] but God who is rich in
[20:03] mercy God saw the hearts of these young
[20:06] parents and he made a way and I I was
[20:10] just sitting in the back and tell I just
[20:11] broke down crying to see to see my son
[20:14] up here leading song serving the lord my
[20:17] daughter serving the lord back in
[20:21] Jeffersonville and I I'm just I'm so I'm
[20:25] I'm grateful really beyond words that
[20:28] even though I'm a failure and even
[20:30] though I'm completely inadequate to
[20:32] really do anything in this world God
[20:35] sees my heart and he he says I'll take
[20:38] care of
[20:40] you maybe like Peter Satan has sought to
[20:43] sift you like
[20:44] wheat but I prayed for you I've got
[20:48] control of it I saw your heart you
[20:51] wanted to do things right and he made a
[20:54] way and it's the same with this Young
[20:57] Solomon he he did the best that he
[21:00] could we
[21:02] um sister hope also comes from uh same
[21:06] place I there there's certain things
[21:09] that that in my past and and certain
[21:12] people that that I harbored some
[21:13] resentment
[21:15] for and lately it's been really strong
[21:18] in the people that have been attacking
[21:21] uh brother
[21:22] Brandon and I'll tell you I don't read a
[21:27] lot of quotes I don't go the message way
[21:32] but I have a fierce loyalty to that man
[21:37] and it's because he pointed me to a
[21:39] living Jesus Christ and and since I was
[21:41] a little boy since I since I can
[21:44] remember I'm
[21:46] talking barely able to
[21:49] walk that voice on those tapes has given
[21:52] me
[21:53] strength and it's it's brought me
[21:56] through it didn't teach me wrong it
[21:58] didn't it didn't send me in the wrong
[22:00] direction it didn't it didn't teach a
[22:02] self-righteous Holiness it didn't do any
[22:05] of that it gave me strength and it gave
[22:07] me Faith and it showed me that these
[22:10] things that that that you need that you
[22:13] pray for you can have those
[22:16] things and there are there is a
[22:20] miraculous there is a
[22:24] supernatural and it's there just to if
[22:29] you would just receive it those things
[22:31] gave me
[22:32] strength and and though I did I went too
[22:35] far I got I I went into a a a sectarian
[22:40] or denominational way of thinking and I
[22:42] fully admit it I I did wrong but my
[22:46] heart was
[22:48] right and and
[22:50] now I I I can see that Lord you brought
[22:53] me through and you've matured me into a
[22:56] man and now I would have never thought
[22:58] thought that I would be the pastor of a
[23:02] church and now that same
[23:07] anger comes up in me and say how dare
[23:11] you say these things that you're saying
[23:13] about that man and I want to go on the
[23:17] offensive and if that's what I was
[23:19] talking about this morning don't go on
[23:22] the offensive no matter how bad you
[23:25] think that person is and even even like
[23:30] Michael the
[23:32] Archangel disputing with
[23:34] Satan and even he didn't bring a railing
[23:39] accusation against him so who am I to
[23:42] bring an accusation against anyone I I
[23:45] feel very confident in playing
[23:48] defense but not going after someone and
[23:51] I thank God that that he's
[23:54] never haven't fallen and gone on the
[23:58] offensive in the past couple
[24:01] years and he's just it's he he's spared
[24:04] me and and now I see I'm grateful Lord
[24:06] thank you and I don't ever want to go
[24:09] there and this man Solomon this young
[24:12] man he went up not to the high place but
[24:17] he went up to the highest of the high
[24:19] places this place called giba and he was
[24:23] going to and he offered these a thousand
[24:25] um sacrifices to the Lord and he wanted
[24:28] wanted to please the Lord and the Lord
[24:31] saw Solomon's heart even though Solomon
[24:35] was doing something that probably wasn't
[24:38] right for him to do but he did it in the
[24:41] right Spirit Solomon's heart was right
[24:46] so Solomon goes up to giba and I'm sorry
[24:51] I uh I'm just I didn't I didn't really
[24:54] prepare for this but if you could go to
[24:56] First Kings chapter 3 and this
[25:00] is
[25:02] Solomon after he had made these
[25:06] sacrifices in this place that was
[25:09] normally reserved for sacrificing Idols
[25:12] but he was doing his best because he did
[25:15] not have this Temple to make this
[25:18] sacrifice yet First Kings CH 3:5 it says
[25:23] this in gibian yes the Lord appeared to
[25:27] Solomon in a Dream by night and God said
[25:31] ask what I shall give thee and Solomon
[25:35] said thou Hast showed unto thy servant
[25:36] David my father great Mercy according as
[25:39] he walked before thee in truth and in
[25:42] righteousness and in uprightness of
[25:44] heart with thee and thou has kept for
[25:47] him this great kindness that thou Hast
[25:49] given him a son to sit on his throne as
[25:54] it is this day he's talking about
[25:57] himself
[25:58] it's like Lord you blessed my dad and
[26:01] you gave my dad me to be able to sit on
[26:05] my father's throne and I know it made my
[26:08] dad so
[26:10] proud and now oh Lord my God thou Hast
[26:15] made thy servant King instead of David
[26:18] my
[26:19] father after
[26:22] David and I am but a little child and I
[26:26] know not how to go out or come in look
[26:30] at look at the sweetness of Solomon he's
[26:32] like Lord I'm doing my best and God
[26:35] honors it brothers and sisters when we
[26:37] do our best God will honor it that's
[26:40] wisdom you put it before God you do your
[26:42] best you try and more often than not
[26:46] you're going to make a mistake but God
[26:50] will take your mistake and he will make
[26:52] you a better person for it
[26:59] and thy
[27:01] servant and thy servant is in the midst
[27:04] of thy people which thou H has chosen a
[27:06] great people that cannot be numbered nor
[27:09] counted for the multitude give therefore
[27:12] thy servant an understanding heart to
[27:15] judge thy people that I may discern
[27:17] between good and bad for who is able to
[27:21] judge this so great a
[27:25] people and the speech pleased the Lord
[27:29] that Solomon had as that had asked this
[27:31] thing and God said to him because thou
[27:34] Hast asked this thing and Hast not asked
[27:37] for thyself a long life neither hast
[27:40] thou asked riches for th thyself nor
[27:43] hast thou nor Hast asked the life of
[27:46] thine enemies but H has asked for
[27:48] thyself understanding to
[27:51] discern
[27:53] judgment behold I have done according to
[27:57] thy words
[27:58] lo I have given thee a wise and
[28:00] understanding heart so that there is
[28:03] none like thee before thee neither after
[28:07] thee shall any arise like unto thee so
[28:09] he's saying Solomon your heart was
[28:12] right I said I'm going to give you
[28:15] anything anything that you
[28:18] want Solomon you just
[28:22] ask imagine if any of us were in that
[28:26] situation and we were praying and God
[28:28] came
[28:29] down and said I'm going to give you
[28:33] anything you just say to me what you
[28:37] want and Solomon and the wisdom I
[28:40] believe was already in him he said Lord
[28:44] give me wisdom that I can judge your
[28:46] people that I can lead your people
[28:49] because it wasn't about
[28:53] Solomon it was about the people that he
[28:56] was leading
[28:59] stark contrast to his brother who I I'll
[29:02] speak about in a
[29:05] minute verse number 12 behold I've have
[29:09] done according to thy words lo I have
[29:11] given thee a wise and understanding
[29:13] heart so that there is none like thee
[29:15] before thee neither after thee shall any
[29:18] arise like unto thee and I have also
[29:20] given thee that which thou Hast not
[29:23] asked look at
[29:25] God he is going to he he never underd
[29:30] delivers I have given you something you
[29:33] didn't ask for fact more a lot of things
[29:36] you didn't ask for both riches and honor
[29:42] so that there shall not be any among the
[29:44] Kings like unto thee all thy
[29:47] days and if thou wil walk in my ways to
[29:51] keep my statutes and my Commandments as
[29:54] thy father David did walk then I I will
[29:58] lengthen thy days so here's this young
[30:01] man Solomon and and he goes up with a
[30:04] pure heart maybe doing the wrong thing
[30:08] but God saw that wonderfully
[30:11] Pure Heart pure motives in that young
[30:16] man and he answered and he gave him the
[30:19] desire of his heart which was for
[30:24] others now we have Solomon brother maybe
[30:28] 13 14 years
[30:31] before he wanted wisdom
[30:34] also but he wanted wisdom for
[30:40] Earthly for worldly things he wanted
[30:44] riches he wanted power he was the best
[30:48] looking of David's Sons he was the most
[30:50] popular he was the most well spoken and
[30:53] he had this great ambition I want the
[30:59] Kingdom my older brother I'm far I'm far
[31:03] better than him I'm far more capable
[31:06] than him so David catches wind of this
[31:09] they have an argument they they have
[31:11] problems over the years Solomon's
[31:14] Solomon's cut out I mean sorry absolum
[31:18] is cut out and then absolum comes back
[31:22] in and he starts waiting by the gate
[31:25] into the into the City and here's ABS
[31:27] he's the King's son great power great
[31:30] Authority just being David's son so he's
[31:33] there and there were disputes and David
[31:35] may have been busy and and maybe his
[31:37] judges were busy and solom or um absolum
[31:40] says I'll judge these disputes for you
[31:42] and he had great wisdom in judging these
[31:46] things and the reason that absum wanted
[31:50] to judge was so that
[31:54] he could lift himself up
[31:58] more and more he gained the Bible says
[32:01] he gained the heart of the
[32:04] people and it was for
[32:07] absolum it was not for the kingdom it
[32:10] was not for his father David it was not
[32:12] out of respect for him it was for his
[32:15] own Earthly selfish
[32:19] Ambitions and look at the difference one
[32:21] was an incredibly well-spoken man born
[32:24] with many gifts and he put himself out
[32:27] out there to take over the kingdom to
[32:30] gain more power and more power and more
[32:32] power and here comes his brother the the
[32:36] the chosen King and he said Lord give me
[32:38] wisdom so I can help your
[32:40] people look at the two
[32:43] differences and that's what this ending
[32:46] of this James chapter 3 is talking about
[32:50] it's talking about two different wisdoms
[32:53] two different
[32:56] desires James chapter 3 well we ended
[32:59] with verse 12 let's start with verse
[33:02] 13 James says this who is a wise man and
[33:08] endued with knowledge among you let him
[33:10] show out of a good conversation his
[33:13] works with meekness of wisdom he's going
[33:16] to talk about two different kinds of
[33:18] wisdoms here you have the Earthly wisdom
[33:21] and you have the Heavenly
[33:24] wisdom but if you have bitter envying
[33:27] and Str life in your hearts Glory not
[33:31] and lie not against the
[33:33] truth this wisdom descends not from
[33:37] above remember absum he was willing to
[33:40] lie he was willing to cheat and he was
[33:44] successful at doing it and so often we
[33:46] see people that it's like wow this
[33:49] person really has a gift and they're
[33:51] very good at moving up the ranks and
[33:53] they move up the ranks because they are
[33:56] thinking about themselves and they do
[33:58] well in the world
[34:00] today but that is Earthly
[34:03] wisdom but you have in but if you have
[34:07] bitter envying and strife in your hearts
[34:09] Glory not and lie not against the truth
[34:13] this wisdom descends not from above but
[34:16] is
[34:16] Earthly sensual that sensual doesn't
[34:20] mean like what we think it means it's
[34:23] unspiritual
[34:26] natural this
[34:28] wisdom that you desire is a natural
[34:31] wisdom like Absalon sought
[34:35] after Earthly
[34:38] sensual
[34:40] devilish
[34:42] demonic for where envying and strife is
[34:46] there is confusion and every evil work
[34:50] so the first part he's describing
[34:52] Earthly wisdom and this wisdom comes
[34:54] from the world absolum thought he was
[34:57] wise and he was wise and he sat outside
[35:00] the gate judging the people for himself
[35:03] and he judged them rightly and he had
[35:05] great wisdom and the people were like
[35:07] wow man this guy's really good he can
[35:10] judge he has he we need to promote him
[35:13] to King because he has reached out to us
[35:16] and abson would say come here come here
[35:18] and he showed him such love he' give him
[35:19] a kiss we're
[35:22] buddies person after person winning the
[35:26] heart of the people but doing it
[35:29] deceptively
[35:31] Isaiah 5 you can keep it on James but
[35:34] Isaiah 5:21 says this woe unto them that
[35:38] are wise in their own eyes and prudent
[35:42] in their own
[35:44] sight James chapter chapter 1 verse 5
[35:49] says this if any of you lack
[35:52] wisdom let him ask of God that giveth to
[35:56] all men liberally and abrath not and it
[35:59] shall be given him so here he is we see
[36:02] Solomon now he's asking for wisdom and
[36:06] he's asking for it this is the Heavenly
[36:08] wisdom that was given to Solomon and
[36:10] he's asking this and and saying Lord
[36:13] help me and this is James saying ask for
[36:16] this
[36:17] wisdom but you got to ask for the right
[36:20] reason verse number six but let him ask
[36:23] in faith not wavering how could I
[36:28] ask for wisdom in faith if I was asking
[36:31] for wisdom for my own benefit I
[36:35] can't I
[36:37] can't but let him ask in faith not
[36:39] wavering for he that wavereth is like a
[36:43] wave of the sea driven with the wind and
[36:47] tossed so if you are asking for wisdom
[36:50] and you're asking for it wrong you're
[36:52] going to be tossed to and fro you're
[36:54] going to be you're going to make this
[36:56] decision or that decision because all of
[36:58] your decisions are you're making this
[37:00] decision on what benefits
[37:04] me and it causes
[37:07] confusion and it really it'll cause
[37:11] failure verse number 17 in James 3 but
[37:15] the wisdom that is from
[37:18] above is Fier is first
[37:21] pure then
[37:23] Peaceable and
[37:25] gentle and easy to be intreated full of
[37:30] mercy and of good fruits without
[37:33] partiality and without hypocracy the
[37:36] musicians can come and we close think
[37:38] about how
[37:40] David it's full of
[37:43] Mercy think about how David was when
[37:47] when he was out in the in the fields out
[37:50] in the in the rocks and and and Saul was
[37:54] seeking him to to find him and to kill
[37:56] him and here David Saul comes into this
[37:59] cave and David has the opportunity to
[38:02] kill him right here and his main man
[38:04] says I'll do it let's kill we have the
[38:07] chance right here you can kill this King
[38:10] and then you can take the kingdom David
[38:12] David had
[38:13] mercy he could have done it right there
[38:17] he could have killed his adversary and
[38:19] taken the kingdom but he had mercy and
[38:22] then it happened again there is Saul
[38:24] asleep with his men David sneaks in
[38:27] he cut off his the skirt of His Garment
[38:30] before he sneaks in and takes his weapon
[38:33] on the next one could have killed him
[38:36] again right there but wisdom is
[38:39] Peaceable and
[38:41] gentle easy to be in treated full of
[38:44] mercy and of good friends of good fruits
[38:46] without partiality and without hypocrisy
[38:49] how
[38:51] beautiful and the fruit of
[38:54] righteousness is sown in peace of them
[38:58] that make peace Jesus said blessed are
[39:01] the
[39:06] peacemakers and I believe that
[39:09] closes Chapter 3 of
[39:12] James I tell
[39:14] you in studying this James chapter
[39:18] 3 has made me examine myself say Lord
[39:24] where am I in your word
[39:27] am I like this young man
[39:30] Solomon or I just Lord I just want
[39:33] wisdom I want to be able to take care of
[39:35] my family I want to be able to take care
[39:36] of my church I want to be able to help
[39:40] them and then the people that come
[39:42] against
[39:44] me Lord I want to have peace with them
[39:47] the people that come
[39:48] [Music]
[39:50] against our church people that come
[39:53] against the people in our church and
[39:55] I'll tell you what you can come against
[39:56] me
[39:58] but you come against these people man I
[40:00] want to pull my sword and start
[40:02] swinging we can't do that
[40:05] either we have to live Peaceable with
[40:08] with those people we have to
[40:10] forgive and we cannot bring a railing
[40:13] accusation against anyone and then this
[40:16] wisdom and you notice how wisdom Falls
[40:18] right
[40:19] after this patience that that James
[40:23] talks
[40:24] about Falls right after that
[40:28] let me just read the whole thing
[40:30] again verse number
[40:33] 13 who is a wise man and endued with
[40:36] knowledge among you let him show out of
[40:38] a good conversation his works with
[40:40] meekness of wisdom but if you have a but
[40:43] if you have bitter envying and strife in
[40:46] your hearts Glory not and lie not
[40:48] against the truth this wisdom descends
[40:51] not from above but is
[40:53] Earthly sensual devilish
[40:58] for where envying and strife is there is
[41:02] confusion and every evil work
[41:06] wow for where there is envying and
[41:08] strife where there's fighting and when
[41:11] when there is Envy
[41:13] Envy
[41:15] is is different than
[41:18] jealousy jealousy caused Cain to kill
[41:22] his brother Abel but envying is coveting
[41:28] you want something someone else
[41:31] has while jealousy you hate that person
[41:35] and where there is envy and
[41:38] strife there is
[41:41] confusion and every evil
[41:47] work but the wisdom that is from above
[41:49] is first pure then Peaceable gentle and
[41:53] easy to be entreated full of mercy and
[41:55] good fruits without
[41:58] partiality and without hypocrisy oh I
[42:00] love that and the fruit of righteousness
[42:03] is sown in peace of them that make peace
[42:08] oh don't you love the word of God oh
[42:12] it's so just I love reading and I
[42:16] say Lord I would like to just open it
[42:20] just step right in and just look around
[42:23] and say oh God I just love I love your
[42:27] word so much do you love the
[42:32] [Music]

[1:00:00] Christ
[1:00:02] according to that which was
[1:00:06] written by
[1:00:08] James we ask for the wisdom of
