scripture Isaiah chapter 9 verse one nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as were in her vexation when at the first he lightly Afflicted the land of zebulun and the land of Nepali and afterward did more grievously afflict her by the way of the sea Beyond Jordan and Galilee of the Nations the people that walked in dark darkness have seen a great light they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death upon them hath the light shined thou has multiplied the nation and H has not increased the joy they Joy before thee according to the joy of the Harvest and as men rejoice when they divide the spoil for thou Hast broken the Yoke of his burden and the staff of his shoulder the rod of his oppressor as in the day of Midian for every battle of the warrior is with confused noise and garments rolled in flood but this shall be with burning and fuel of fire For unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end upon the throne of David and upon on his kingdom to order it and to establish it with judgment and with Justice from hence forth even forever the Zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this amen let's bow our heads our heavenly father Lord it is with a great honor that we come before you in the name of this son that we celebrate his birth today Father we pray that your blessings would be upon our service upon this day and father that you would be pleased and that we could give honor to the Son of God the Lamb of God in Jesus name amen amen you can be seated it's good did you appreciate the plays and everything wasn't it good special thanks special thanks to everybody that was involved I know Sister Angela worked really hard sister Ronnie worked hard um of course sister Jessica not only did sister Jessica get all the choir together but you sang beautifully for us thank you sister Jessica and all those of course that contributed we uh it was was greatly appreciated I think we have a uh a bit of a um tradition we always always have a real baby for baby Jesus here and and this was no different um on Thursday we were rehearsing and and I got to pick up little baby Jesus and I looked at him and he smiled at me and I gave him a little shake and he threw up on me you know thank the Lord you know really the real baby Jesus we don't consider these things but the real baby Jesus did the same thing he was a he was a normal little baby that grew up in this world that got sick and he cried and he got headaches and and he was just he was a baby very special baby the baby that we had today little Evan uh he is a foster child for for the jery and sister Angela and um just a he's a wonderful little guy he few months ago he had chronic seizures and he would was very scary thing for Jeremy and Angela and what they had to go through and it was common that the the seizured would would strike the baby and they felt led to bring the child up to be prayed for and we prayed for little 11 and that was the last seizure that he had and it's been months so that God is still God he's still a Healer he's still he's still everything to us and we we just love him so much we come today to um a few days we'll celebrate the Christmas holiday and it's an important time we know of course that Jesus wasn't born on December 25th it wasn't really possible for him to be born at that time but he was in fact born and this is the day that we celebrate his birth when we celebrate these holidays and especially Christmas we celebrate something that happened in the in the past and this is a Jewish tradition that goes way way back all the way to Moses they celebrated these different things that had happened whether it be crossing the Red Sea or whether it be the Passover when Moses was there and and God smokee Egypt whether it be the Harvest God wants us to bring these things back to our remembrance and we do we do here we celebrate the Passover when we take communion we celebrate the Lord's Day we celebrate the resurrection every Sunday morning when we come together these things ought to be recognized and they bring what happened in the past to our remembrance and Christmas is no different it's the one holiday that actually has Christ in it it's a Christian holiday and we have to understand what it means what what Christmas is or else it is what many people call it is a a pagan holiday or or a holiday that was that was set up by the Romans or or whatever it might be if we don't know but if we do know then we should be able to celebrate this day and we should be able to honor our lord Jesus with this day if we were going to celebrate someone's birthday and we just got a bunch of people together and said let's have a birthday and you might say well whose birthday is it no we're just going to celebrate a birthday well we don't know how to celebrate the birthday well what do you mean well it could be a birthday for a a baby it could be a birthday for an elderly person it could be anybody's birthday we have to know who this person is so we can celebrate their birthday and that's what Christmas is if we don't know who Jesus Christ is then how can we truly celebrate his birthday how can we truly give him Honor on this day how else it turns into what many people said it's just a commercial day where you swap gifts and you have a Christmas tree and it turns into nothing but a bunch of commercial that's not what we're here for we are here to honor the true Christmas that has Christ in it we think about a Christmas tree and I know that a lot of people condemn the Christmas tree and they should if it's not about Christ a Christmas tree according to history first came about with the reformer named Martin Luther Martin Luther was walking home one winter night and he was looking up in the stars and he thought of the one that created the heavens and the Earth stars were there and he was walking and and he took candles and lamps and there was a tradition to bring an evergreen tree in that that would symbolize in in German tradition that would symbolize the promise of a resurrection a promise that they that it would be green once again so Martin Luther takes candles and and ornaments and he places them on this tree and he brings his children to it and he says now you bring people to this tree and you tell them what these stars on this tree what this this represents tell them what the star on the top of the tree represents it represents that Star of Bethlehem that the Wise Men followed tell them what the presence underneath the tree it's not just that you get to swap gifts tell them what these these presents represents how how the wise men brought gifts to this young baby Jesus in honor of the king but we can make it about a worldly celebration where it's just about a tree and it's about who can put what on the on the tree and having a day off but if we truly give Jesus the credit for it it should lift up Jesus Christ and we should be able to bring people into our home and bring people into our our church and say this is why we celebrate Christmas it's about Jesus Christ amen no it was he was not born on this day but we don't know when he was born this is the day that we celebrate his birth we celebrate our birthdays so why can't we celebrate the birth of Christ it is a wonderful wonderful day Hebrews 4:15 says we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points temp tempted as we are yet without sin Let Us therefore come boldly unto the throne throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find Grace to help in time of need this baby that was born as we acted out here the the kids came up there was no room at the end brought the Child Jesus to the lowest of Low Places put him in this manger because there wasn't room for the King of Kings the Lord of lords Mary gives birth and is unsanitary place but God the father chose for his son to be born there he chose for his son to understand what it is when you don't have money to understand what it is when you are sick to understand what it is when your friends don't treat you right to understand what it is to be persecuted and this man this baby Jesus was born in the lowest of the low he was in all points tempted and yet without sin but he was that pre that high priest that came that knows how it is to be me he knows how it is to be you and he was wonderful he was in fact his name is called wonderful a mighty God he came and and suffered in fact let's read it Isaiah chapter 53 start with verse one says this who has believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of dry out of a dry ground he ha no form or comeliness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he even came as a man wasn't the best looking well-dressed most charismatic guy he understands he understands how it is for maybe to be made fun of when you're young he understands how it is to not be the most affluent person he is despised and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteem esteemed him not surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him esteem him stricken smitten out of God smitten of God and Afflicted he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities his the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed you know what the word stripes mean he was beaten down embarrassed and because of those stripes that he went through little Evan can be healed in the name of Jesus Christ all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as sheep before her shears is dumb so he opened not his mouth going going to the Cross he didn't fight he didn't he he he didn't scream and yell he was like a a sheep a humble sheep being led right to his Slaughter skip to verse 12 therefore will I divide him a portion with the great and he shall divide the spoil with the strong because he hath poured out his soul unto death and he was numbered with the transgressors and he be the sin of many and made intercession for the transgress transgressors that is the one that that was prophesied to come long before 700 years before Jesus came this prophet Isaiah told us who he would be and I read Isaiah chap um chapter 9 before this is who was coming this is this baby that is going to be born and he will be bruised he will be beaten but because this happened we can receive our healing we can receive our joy we can receive most of all we can receive our Salvation because of this baby that was born and we have to know why we celebrate Christmas otherwise it's nothing we celebrate Christmas because of Jesus Christ because of this baby that was born Martin Luther lifted him up all the prophets lifted him up and we want to lift him up on this day and in the days to come as you celebrate Christmas Christmas with your families if you have a tree talk about that tree why do we have this if you have a dinner talk about why you're having the dinner if you exchange gifts talk about why you exchange gifts no matter where you are if you're with your friends if you have a gifts exchange or whatever it is mention Jesus Christ because that's why we do it otherwise it's meaningless I'm talking anytime if you have a gift exchange at work talk about Jesus if you have the day off if you have the day off give Jesus credit for it and if you have to work give Jesus credit for it because you have a job Jesus gets credit for it all I was amazed in reading the birth of Christ how many people actually knew the importance of when Jesus was born when he was first born they were celebr celebrating Christmas before Christ was even born months before Jesus was born they were giving God praise for it they knew what Christmas was and we'll read here in Luke how great this Revelation was on these people we know the story Jesus had a cousin named John the Baptist John the Baptist had a mom Elizabeth dad Zachariah dad was a priest and John was before he was even born Zachariah obviously they were old they couldn't have children Zachariah it was his time to to give the um to give the offering and he goes in and to I believe burn incense he goes in behind private area and the angel Gabriel comes down and tells him that he's going to have a son and then this this boy is going to be great Zachariah wondered how this could be and you can imagine an angel coming to you and saying that this is going to happen and then somebody argues with you it's like hey I'm an angel and you're saying that these things I came to you to talk to you and you're saying that these things can't happen so he says I am Gabriel who comes comes from the presence of God you will not speak until this boy is born so then Zachariah can't talk anymore he comes out the people are um wondering what's going on they thought he saw a vision or whatever and and um his his wife Elizabeth she's starts expecting she becomes pregnant she's she's expecting and then the same Angel goes over to Mary and to Joseph and tells them that you are going to have a son in different times that you are going to have a son that you're going to call his name Jesus so you have over here you have Mary and Joseph you have over here you have Elizabeth and Zachariah that sets the stage for Luke chapter 1 let's start with verse 41 this will show us this great Revelation that these people had Luke 1: 41 says this and it came to pass that when Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary so Mary she's expecting she gets up and she leaves town and she goes and stays with her cousin Elizabeth and it came to pass that when Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary so Mary greets and the Babe the Babe leaped in her womb and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost if you listen to that so she's there Mary greets Elizabeth then this baby jumps in her womb that she had there I believe the child was probably I know between three and six months old this baby leaps in her womb so Mary and you'll see in the next verses Mary must have told Elizabeth the testimony of what happened to Mary and Elizabeth was so so grateful the Holy Spirit comes down and remember it says that John the Baptist was was filled with the Holy Ghost I wonder if this was the very moment that he was filled with the Holy Spirit in his mother's womb it says that he would be filled with the Holy Ghost in his mother's womb I wonder if this is the moment because he jumped and he shouted even inside her belly and she spake Elizabeth speaking and she spake with a loud voice and said blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb and whence is this to me that the mother of my Lord should come to me look at the Revelation that Elizabeth had Mary who am I that the mother the child that you're going to have the mother of my Lord would come to me who am I and there's Mary for lo as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in my ears The Babe leaped in my womb for joy and blessed is she that believes for there shall be a performance of these things which were told her from the Lord so she knew Elizabeth knew and she started celebrating Christmas right there seeing I'm not worthy that you would come because this baby that's born in your womb is my Lord that's going to be born out of your womb is my Lord then the Holy Spirit comes down on Mary and she breaks into this prophetic song and Mary said listen to what Mary is is glorifying God worth and Mary said my soul doth magnify the Lord and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my savior for Heath regarded the lowest state of his handmaiden for behold from the hence from hence forth all generations shall call me blessed Mary is celebrating Christmas before this baby's born she's saying I'm going to give birth to God in flesh and from this day forward everybody's going to call me blessed for he that is mighty hath done to me great things and holy is his name and his Mercy is on them that fear Him from generation to generation he has showed strength with his arm he has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts he had put down the mighty from their seats and exalted them of low degree a prophetic voice coming from the mother the prophetic voice saying that he has exalted those of low degree you saw the the the the Shepherds that were here the Shepherds were the lowest of the low and yet they were the first witnesses to the great king that was born he hath filled the Hungry with good things and the rich he has sent empty away he hath helped his servant Israel in remembrance of his Mercy as he spake to our fathers to Abraham and to his seed forever Mary under the inspiration of God gave out this song this prophecy and then she Abode with with her cousin cousin Elizabeth for about 3 months and returned to her own house this is the making of Christmas this is the making of the birth of Jesus let's skip to verse 67 this is after John the Baptist is born remember I told I told you about Zachariah and Zachariah couldn't speak and he was waiting for this this child to be born and then when when John is born everybody's like well call him Zachariah because that's his dad's name and Zachariah he can't talk but he and they're like what and he's like and he gets a pad his name is John and then when he said that all of a sudden John was able to speak or uh Zachariah was able to speak again now listen to what he spoke listen to the prophetic gift now Zachariah is going to give testimony to Christmas the high the priest even his dad even the dad of the greatest Prophet that had ever lived to that point knew it was not not about John listen to this and his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost everybody's getting filled with the Holy Ghost here we have Mary getting filled we have we have Elizabeth getting filed filled and now Zachariah gets oh we have John the Baptist getting filled he got filled inside the tummy and his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost and prophesied saying blessed be the Lord God of Israel for he has v visited and redeemed his people and hath raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David he's not speaking about his son he is talking about the lion of the tribe of Judah the son of David as he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets which have been since the world began that we should be saved from our enemies and from the hand of all th all that hate us to perform the mercy promised to our fathers and to remember His Holy Covenant the oath which he swear to Our Father Abraham that he would Grant unto us that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear and Holiness and righteousness before him in all the days of our life and thou child now he looks down at his own on son he had just introduced he had just gave a a prophetic voice about Christ the one that was to be born now he looks down at his little baby John and now child shall be called the prophet of the highest for Thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways to give knowledge of Salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins through the tender mercy of our God whereby the day spring from on high hath visited us to give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death to guide our feet into the way of peace and then the child John grew and waxed strong in the spirit and was in the deserts till the day of his showing to Israel so we have John the Baptist he raises up his own dad the the prophetic vision of his dad is like it's not about him it's about this other one that's going to be born that he is going to introduce and here is Elizabeth before and she is saying that blessed am I that I'm even I even get to see you Mary because the one that you're going to give birth to is going to deliver us they are preparing for what we are celebrating this week they're preparing for the first Christmas they're preparing for the birth of God in flesh and they all begin to move and and and the power of the Holy Ghost begins and then we see just a few months later we see what we acted out here that this baby is born and is born in the perfect time he's born in the perfect place and he was born exactly the way that God wanted him to be born which was the poorest of the poor we're honored if you have any money in the bank if you have a job you're richer than like 80% of the rest of the world we've got so much if you are able to give a present or to receive a present you've got more than most of the people in this world and make sure that when you receive it that you receive it in the name of Jesus Christ make sure that when you give it you give it in the name of Jesus Christ because it is about Christ it is about Christmas make sure you put up that tree you put it up in the name of Jesus Christ if you don't put up a tree you don't put it up in the name of Jesus Christ if you have dinner you have your dinner in the name of Jesus Christ everything is in the name of Jesus Christ for this day and it should always be but this is the day that we remember it in front of the whole world sister Jessica sang that song Mary Did You Know It Was Written fairly recently It Was Written in the mid 1980s and what I was listening to it as she was practicing the other night and and I couldn't keep the tears from coming out of my eyes putting myself in this woman's Mary's place and the question asked Mary did you know I think she did know I think she knew exactly who was who came out of her womb I think Elizabeth knew I think Joseph knew I think Zachariah knew I just read where they all knew that they celebrated this Christmas and then this man was born and it says Mary did you know that your baby boy would one day walk on water we know that he was out the the the disciples had gone without him they went to go across the the the giant Lake Jesus stayed on the shore the storm comes and the storm is Raging the lightning is going and it's dark and they look out and and they think that they're going to die they think that little boat's going to capsize they look out and here comes the Messiah of God walking on the water Mary did you know that this little baby that you're holding that he would one day walk on water did you know that your baby boy would save our sons and daughters the prophesied Messiah the king of Israel the prophet that that delivered that was likened unto Moses Moses said that God would raise up a prophet like him like him but way better than him far greater did you know that your baby boy has come to make you knew Mary the child that you delivered will soon deliver you that's my favorite part about that song did you know that your baby boy has come to make you new this child that you've delivered will soon deliver you Mary had sin we're not Catholic Mary had sin in her life she was not perfect she needed to deliver in this child that you are giving birth to Mary he is going to be your savior she was maybe the greatest woman that's ever lived but she still was not perfect Mary did you know you know you felt bad you've done things wrong did you know that this baby is going to deliver you too Mary did you know that your baby boy would give sight to a blind man there was a there's a a man named bmus in the Bible he had heard that there was a redeemer that that there was the son of David that was here that there was the Messiah he had heard this and he'd been blind probably his whole life he was just begging he had no money and the hope of Jesus Christ came into bmus oh that I might receive my sight and he must have thought Lord would he pass by me would this man that I've heard so much that Mary gave birth to would he pass by me and if other people can he get healed would I be able to get healed and then Here Comes Jesus walking by somebody must have told bmus he's here can hear him and he did the right thing let me tell you bmus knew exactly who Jesus was he cries out thou son of David the Messiah the lion of the tribe of Judah thou son of David have mer mercy on me Jesus turned and gave bmus his sight Mary did you know that this baby that you gave birth to did you know that the one that you were holding that threw up on his on on on his uncle or his friend did you know that this baby would one day give sight to Blind Mary did you know that your baby boy would calm a storm with his hand there's Jesus and they're they're back on the Sea of Galilee the waves are going again Jesus was so tired from ministering and from Healing The Sick and and the The Virtue the strength that gone from him and he's laying in the boat and his disciples they're they're about to they're about to die the boat's about to go over Jesus we're going to die gets up oh ye of little faith raises his hand says peace be still and the St the storm obeyed him and calmed Mary did you know you Mary I'm Mary knew but I don't think she had any idea how great this was going to be Mary Did You Know that your baby boy would calm a storm with his hand did you know that your baby boy has walked Where Angels trod when you kiss your little baby you've kissed the face of God oh can you imagine this baby boy that that that Mary was so proud of she picks him up and she kisses her baby like all mothers do Mary did you know that when you kiss him you kiss the face of God the Apostle Paul said he is the expressed image of God Isaiah 7:14 says therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and you shall call his name Emmanuel what is Emanuel mean means God With Us Mary when you kiss the this little baby you are kissing the very face of God Matthew 1:22 says speaking of the birth of Jesus now all of this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet saying the scripture I just read saying behold the Virgin shall shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they should call shall call his name Emmanuel being interpreted God With Us W Mary can you imagine this little child is God himself I wonder if she thought how could this be there was a movie years ago called The Nativity beautiful beautiful story and Joseph makes this statement he says can I will I be able to teach him anything he sees this little baby Joseph knew who it was an angel told him Mary who knew who it was and there he is he's like how could I teach him anything the blind will see the deaf will hear They begged Jesus there was a deaf man deaf and and mute man they brought to Jesus They begged him just lay your hands on him Jesus just put your hands on him he'll be healed jesus takes his fingers and puts them in his ears and he couldn't speak either Jesus Takes spittle and puts it on his tongue like wow how would he do that he was God he was God in flesh and then the man started hearing and then the man started speaking the blind will see the deaf will here the dead will live again Jesus's good friend Lazarus died Jesus was out on the field going back and forth and they called for him four days days and days passed Lazarus died four days went by since they put him in the grave the man was dead he was his body smelled everything about Lazar was dead Mary did you know she was probably there Mary did you know that your son will raise the dead Jesus comes up and he's Lazarus in the grave and he gets to the grave and that was his good friend and here's the man the Flesh in Jesus he cries I loved him so much Lazarus we grew up together he was such a good friend and there he is in the grave and rolled the stone back the body smells Jesus straightens up Mary Did You Know imagine if she was there that's my son I saw him turn the water to wine I've seen him do a lot what's he going to do now Lazarus come forth and a dead man came out of that grave Mary Did You Know that your son would raise the dead and let me tell you he's going to raise the dead again there's going to be dead through all of the ages those that died in Christ that are sleeping now in the grave Mary did you know that Jesus is going to raise all of them up again my mom my dad your family those that are gone on Mary did you know that he's going to raise them up too the the lame will leap the dumb will speak the Praises of the Lamb the lame will leap even after Jesus had left he took he took off he ascended up on heaven and he sent his holy spirit down and it filled 120 in the upper room and they went out and this was Jesus working not the men there's Peter and John his two best buddies they're going up to the gate of the temple they walk up there's a lame man right there lame from birth and he's begging he can't work Peter looks down at him looks him right in the face he knew who he had been around he looks down at the man man puts his cup up maybe or his hand up you gonna give me some money so I can eat Peter looks down says Silver and Gold Have I None but what I have I give to you right up and and walk and the man leapt up the lame will leap and this happened after Jesus left the same spirit that was on Jesus Christ came down on his people and they did the same thing and Mary did you know that this was going to happen Mary probably be like whoa I had no idea I knew he was the Messiah I knew he was the son of God but I had no idea God never underd delivers God always exceeds your expectations did you know Mary the lame will leap the dumb will speak the Praises of the lamb and they come up and they're shouting praises to God praises to Jesus Christ Mary did you know that your baby boy is the Lord of all creation as I said Hebrew says he is the express image of God John 316 said that God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son did you know Mary that he is the Lord of all creation Mary did you know that your baby boy is Heavens perfect lamb a lamb without spot or blemish they had been sacrificing since Moses's time and before that they had since since Abel's time time since the beginning of time they had been sacrificing Mary did you know that your son was going to fulfill all of those sacrifices that there would be no more sacrifices that he would be the perfect lamb did you know that you won't have to do it anymore you just get on your knees and you say Lord Jesus forgive me for my sins and that perfect lamb would look down and you place your sins on that lamb in the Old Testament they would take the lamb a perfect lamb without spot and blemish the best that they could get a hold of they would take the lamb they would put their sins on that of the lamb and then the priest would take it and he would slice the Lamb's throat the blood would go out and that would be the atonement for sin Mary did you know that just represented something that wasn't perfect but that your son Mary that you'll walk you'll watch him carrying his cross down the road and you will watch him go up on the mountain nailed to the cross you will watch your son's blood fall onto the ground like you did these perfect lamb the these these Lambs that have been s sacrificed All Through The Years Mary did you know that your son is going to be that lamb did you know that he will be God's perfect lamb that he'll die for all all of creation this sleeping child that you're holding is The Great I Am what a song The Lamb will leap the dumb will speak the Praises of the lamb Mary did you know that your baby boy is the Lord of all creation Mary did you know that your baby boy will one day rule the Nations as King in his Heavenly City Mary did you know that this sleeping child that you're holding is The Great I Am when Moses said had the burning bush and God speaks to Moses he said Lord who are you God looks down says I am that I am Mary did you know that the same one that spoke to Moses that said I am did you know that your son is that great I am Mary did you know that the rock that Mo they were in the wilderness Moses brought them out and the rock that Moses smote with his staff they were dying of thirst and water came out Mary did you know that that rock that was hit with the stick did did you know that was your son did you know that Jesus was that rock in the wilderness and out of him came forth of waters of Life Mary did you know that before Abraham was Jesus even said Mary did you think about Mary did you know that your son would go before the priests and say before Abraham was I am that he is that great I am can you imagine Mary can you imagine how she must have felt she had no idea but imagine how she felt after he died and he was resurrected she was probably thinking as he was dead thinking I held this baby and I saw him do all of these things and now he's dying on the cross I love him he's my boy I held him I took care of him and here he is dying on the cross but Mary you don't know yet but that boy is going to raise from the dead and he is going to conquer death hell in the grave and that is The Great I Am that is Jesus Christ that is he is our all and all amen musicians can come in closing sister Jessica if you would come also Philippians chapter 2 verse 5 says this let this mind be in you which also is in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God Philippians 2:5 who being in the 26 who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation he was born in a manger but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and he and was made in the likeness of men not only made in the likeness of men but made in the likeness of the lowest of the men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the Cross this is why we celebrate Christmas wherefore God also hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name that at the name of that baby that was born in a manger that at the name of that one that we celebrate his birth on December member 25th the one that was born that that we that we exchang gifts this one that was born that we remember him that God hath highly exalted him and given him a name above every name that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow of the things in heaven and the things of the earth and the things under the Earth let me tell you there's many knees that don't bow right now but every knee will bow I'm bowing my knee to him now every day saying Lord Jesus thank you so much that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow of the things in heaven and the things in Earth and the things under the Earth and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the father that's Christmas that's why we celebrate we don't celebrate the the worldly way we don't celebrate this is a holiday that we just get off work we don't celebrate this as as a as a day that that is just giving gifts or or whatever it might be we celebrate this day that this was the birth of our savior born to a lowly Mary and a lowly Joseph his foster parents sister Angela foster parents born to these foster parents that were just honored to be there and just honored to to hold this little baby Zachariah prophesied of his greatness Elizabeth of his greatness Mary of his greatness and here is this little baby that's born we could never say enough about his greatness every knee will bow to that baby that was once in a Manger but he grew up and the spirit of God grew stronger in him and the spirit of God don't leave Jesus in the manger don't just celebrate Christmas the baby Jesus Jesus grew and may he grow within us and may we grow up mature vessels that are able to that the Holy Spirit might dwell within us let us be that don't leave Jesus in a manger let him grow in you as you grow closer to him that's why we celebrate Christmas it was the day that my savior and your savior was born does December 25th whatever date Christmas celebrates the birth of Christ Our Lord I ask sister Jessica now that we've heard now that
