force and power cares enough about each of us to listen to each of our needs no matter how great or how small because he loves us so much that he set he came in the form of a man he didn't send somebody else he came in the form of a man he experienced what we experience and then he sacrificed himself to pay the debt so that we could come into His presence as we are this morning to come into

good day to be alive it's a good day to be in this house it's it's a good day Lord to walk outside and see the sun shining and father this this just beautiful day that you gave us Lord how grateful we

just feel most of all today we just we just want your fellowship Lord we just want to Bow Down and Worship You and we want you to be close with us this morning Father join us in our congregation today we ask father we pray that your will would be done in Jesus Christ's name amen while I while I have everyone standing let's U let's read in our scriptures Hebrews chapter 12 it's one of one of the scriptures I I just love so much I just love reading and it's it's always encouraging to me Hebrews 12:1 reads like this it says wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witness now Hebrews chapter 12 obviously is right after Hebrews chapter 11 but HEB Hebrews chapter 11 it talks about all these great hero Heroes of Faith so he's referring back to that saying that we are surrounded with such such a great cloud of witness let us lay aside every weight and the sin which do easily so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the Throne of God again looking unto Jesus the author of these things you can take your seats I want to talk this morning about setting our eyes on Jesus and following the blueprint that he has he has laid before us in our lives um before I before I get into into my sermon this morning a question came in yesterday and uh I would like to address that question um and it's from The Book of Revelation and it's about these Messengers that were to come in Revelation Chapter 2 and chapter 3 three I I don't want to mention who gave me the question um because the the video and and who's watching I don't want to um maybe put a friend or some something in in a bad spot so I won't mention mention your name but the um the question came in and it was a very very very good question and it was about these Messengers that were to come in Revelation Chapter 2 and chapter 3 three and I'd like to just read if we could Revelation chap 2 and let's start with verse one it says this now now watch who IT addresses it says unto the angel of the Church of Ephesus it's addressed to an angel it's addressed to a messenger that was to come to this church now we believe and most scholars believe believe that this Revelation 2 and Revelation 3 are periods of time it doesn't say Church ages but it's pretty obvious that these are ages that are to come from Jesus up until now and unto the angel of the Church of Ephesus these things saith he that holdeth the Seven Stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven candlesticks seven golden candlesticks now it's saying that who is talking here notice it's in red this person that's talking is the Lord Jesus and he is speaking to this angel or messenger that this man is going to come and deliver this message to this Ephesian age or to this Ephesian church are we together I know it might be um review for most of us but it's a very very important thing so we go through and if you go through Revelation Chapter 2 and chapter 3 it says and unto the angel of the Church of smia and to Angel of the Church of thyra and to pergamos and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to leoda and it's addressed to each of these angels and how many of these angels are there does anyone know seven angels seven Messengers to this this church these churches that this Revelation 2 and Revelation three are talking about we get to the last one in Revelation chapter 3 and I'll read it read it here three um verse four verse 14 and unto the angel of the Church of the leod Deans write these things saith the amen the amen the so be it Jesus Christ speaking sayith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God speaking to this Jesus Christ is speaking to this messenger that he is going to give a message to an age and that man is going to be the most influential person in that entire age now we know that that uh that God had ordained men to start this work in that in that age and I'll tell you something you didn't know sometimes that man may not even be born in that age he may be born just before the age but it was his ministry that influenced that age now there are seven of these and then if you go to Revelation 4 verse1 it's talking about something different it it says it's it's we're be we're beginning the introduction to the Seven Seals here four five six and then the last seal is in chapter 8 so we see that there are not eight Messengers there are seven very very plain so what happens is people have ministers have they have taken different scriptures and different quotes and they have taken these and then they have made it to where they they get a revelation I don't question their Revelation but they get a revelation and that Revelation goes in a certain direction and it starts to lift lift up this Minister and that Minister becomes something more than than he really is in his mind and in the minds of other people so there are doctrines out there that say that there is an eighth messenger but this book right here it's very hard to pull out an eighth messenger out of this book you got to do a lot of twisting and term in and pulling and prodding and and putting things together that uh that would be a not according to to this word but people will get a revelation as I said and that's what my subject is going to be on today people will get a revelation and then they will take that Revelation a place that God didn't wanted to go a place that this it it becomes so self-serving it becomes my Revelation and I am important and now I fulfill these scriptures the Bible says a man not ought to think too highly of himself that's this these kind of things are the extreme saying that I am the eighth messenger or or something like that wow you have very very high aspirations brother but I would come back down down to earth and and I would encourage these Brethren that say something like that you need to come down to this Altar and repent and you've made too much of yourself so I wanted to answer that question I hope it answers it um because it is a very very important question and it's a doctrine that has gone around the world people take have taken certain quotes and and certain scriptures and they'll line up them up and who does it lift up it lifts up me it lifts up us so that's I wanted to wanted to answer that question and uh I also want I want to give a testimony of uh of our service on Wednesday night I was um there was a sister is Sister Priscilla did I see her walk in Sister Priscilla fryo uh she was she was talking with there they are I was just talking about you um sister Priscilla um felt in her heart to witness to a young man that was in the convenience store and it turns out that this young man was on a journey he drove a truck and he was here in Tucson for a certain amount of time I believe to pick up another load and bring it back to his home in Texas and sister pela in invited him to church and the young man I was she gave me his phone number I called him and uh we talked on the phone a little bit and he just seemed like wow this is a a real Christian young man a very fine young man so he ends up coming to church and I look look out the window or I walked out the door and I see him there so I walked out into the parking lot and I said are you George and he sayses I said hi I'm Daniel I'm the I'm the pastor of the church and and we started talking and and I said brother it's you just got a nice spirit it's nice that you came and and join us I said the Lord's really been doing something in our congregation lately I said that that um we've had quite a few baptisms in the church it just feels like the Lord's dealing with us and he looked at me and he said you said it he saysi want to be baptized tonight and I said uh I said whoa like like what and he says he says I made a commitment he says I'm on this journey and he says I feel like there was one thing that I left that that I needed to do and that was to be baptized and he said I made a commitment to the Lord if the pastor mentions baptism then I am going to be baptized tonight wonderful testimony for those of you that were here um he's probably I texted him the service this morning he's probably listening in on the stream right now but I just it it was it was really the Lord that was doing that so I took the pulpit and as I was ministering on Wednesday um things just weren't going right sister Shirley was there smiling like you usually are and I just what had happened is I just didn't feel the anointing when I was here and this has happened to me one time before and and I just know now to to don't just press through if I've done something wrong or if I've grieved the Holy Spirit I want to just stop and that's the best thing to do for all of us if you've done something wrong stop you know the old saying is if you find that you've dug yourself a hole the best thing to do the first thing to do is to stop digging and that's what that's so that's that's what I did is I just stopped and and uh we had prayer and then I went back to ministering and and I felt like things were okay we baptized um brother George up there and after that I just struggled during the week said Lord have I have I done done something really wrong I just felt like up there Lord I felt like I was out of your will I felt I felt like you weren't with me and and so I kept praying and and asking the Lord Lord what have I done that's not a good thing to ask because how many things have I done just in the past week how many things have I done how many times have I failed God in just just a few days so all these things were coming to my mind and I was just say Lord what what is going on and I I'm not a preacher Lord I'm just I don't know what am I doing and and praying and then I wanted to share on Saturday morning at about 3 o'clock in the morning something woke me up just and I just woke up and I felt there was a presence there and that presence was just so beautiful it was so strong and it was it was just a presence of just pure love and I was laying there in bed and I had all these questions on my heart but I didn't want to ask any question I didn't want I I didn't want to do anything all I wanted to do was say oh Lord Jesus I love you so much and there he was and and this presence in the room and I was just I started weeping I was like Lord I just love you I just thank you so much you're so kind and you're so loving and then I was and I just felt like he was saying I know I love you you're my son you're my boy and like he does to so many of us we are failures friends we we can't do really anything right without him and I was as I was praying about this sermon this morning and Lord what do you want me to bring I'm a failure I'm I'm everything and all I was seeing is is failure and then the love came in and and and praying about this thinking on what to present this morning and thinking about that eighth message messenger and what is being presented and what's being presented all over the world from the ministry some of these things are really they're false and they're destructive and they hurt the people and looking at the word and what it says and then we think because we have a revelation that we've got it all finished and it's all done and then it becomes no matter what what it is then it becomes my Revelation not God and then we get this Revelation and everything siners around this Revelation that we have and instead of asking the Lord for more Revelation asking the Lord for more of his word for more love for more faith instead we stop and we become a denomination or a cult right into ourselves and everything from then on has to line up with what God gave us in this Revelation and we take it to a place that God didn't intend it God gives us a little bit and we take a whole bunch like these brothers they may be Anointed with the Holy Ghost they may have received a revelation but they take it too far and and then it becomes destructive and it becomes about control and it becomes hatred and it becomes about themselves and protecting their own Ministry and lifting themselves up and we lose sight of Jesus Christ we lose sight of what he did for us and we want to go down this road and as he gives us revelation we don't want to stop there we want to say thank you Lord and continue praying about it and continue moving and realize friends that we know nothing we're nothing we're not special we're not anything we are we're as I used to say we're zeros Christ is everything and I don't want to know I don't want to know all of these all of these great Revelations and and all of these things Paul said no I have all of that he says I'm nothing without love and that's what is cast out first is love when we have these Revelations and we start lifting ourselves up that's the first thing that goes love leaves and control starts what a mess that we get into the Apostle Paul in his wisdom he addressed it one time and well many many times he addressed it but in 1 Corinthians chap 2 verse1 listen to this he says this and I Brethren when I came to you came not with Excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of God I didn't come to you as some great something some eighth messenger or some big powerful speaker or some anointed prophet of God I didn't come to you in any of that for I am determined not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified that is the man with probably the one of the greatest Revelations that's ever walked the Earth and yet he says himself I don't want anything except to keep my eyes fixed on Jesus Christ and him crucified let me read read that scripture in Hebrews once again it says this Hebrews 12 12:2 looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the sh shame and is sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God always keeping my eye on Jesus always watching him the very first sermon I think I ever preached here I was talking about signs I I told the testimony of Daniel and I driving the car out here and as we were going on the road I 10 as Tucson was getting closer we took we took a a road that was pre-ordained for us to go we took that road it was the most efficient way here and then we get close to Tucson and it said Tucson 50 miles or whatever the sign says and it showed number one it showed we are on the right path we're going there's the sign I can see the sign I am going to get Tucson to Tucson if we just stay on this road but what we don't do is stop and jump up and down and say we made it here's the sign you didn't make it we have nobody here has made it yet I'll tell you that right now none of us have made it it yet because we're still here in these fleshly bodies one day soon we will go up that may be the way of the Grave or it may be the way of the Rapture but we will go up with Christ but don't stop at the sign do what the S what the sign says continue on God has pre-ordained a path for us in this day he has set this path before us and then he has given us the opportunity that we can choose are we going to go on this path or are we going to stray and take side roads I suggest we follow the signs and do what the signs say and stay on those paths I gave a testimony last week gave my testimony I I really kind of let put my myself out there and saying here's here's really how I came to the place that I am right now and I told about a man that had never heard another minister in this message that we believe all he had was this volume of books and it was such a blessing to me to hear his perspective on things and what I forgot to tell last week was when I was driving home that night I made the decision I told this part that I need to decide do I believe this or not I was a kid I was born I was born into this do I really believe this and I said yes the thing that I left out was this I made a commitment I said Lord I am full of doctrines and I felt dirty I said I am full of of all these different these different ways of thinking and I said Lord I want to get rid of all of that and I want to set my eyes on Jesus Christ which is what all the prophets set their eyes on and I want to follow that path I want to follow that road and I want to be able to receive more revelation but I want to get rid of all of these ways of thinking that I had and just think like you want me to think just go along this road that God has set and ordained for me to travel but instead brothers and sisters we get Revelations that are right that are according to God's word god God gives them to us and then we we start living our life around this one Revelation and as I said we take it farther than it should have gone and we draw a circle we make a little cult around ourselves and now we've sealed not only we seal sealed ourselves in we've sealed God out we shouldn't be that way because we often say this is my Revelation and my Revelation is right and it fa fail and I set my salvation on my Revelation guess what brother or sister if it's your Revelation it's wrong if it's a revelation that God sent down and set before you now it's right receive that and continue on and don't stop right there continue on in the grace of God continue on learning more accepting more being more holy you can say okay well I got this little thing right and you look around and maybe some other people don't have that right and here you are looking around say oh look at how great I am I was telling Stephanie probably shouldn't say it I might very well offend half of the people here it wasn't her that said it was me um okay I'll say it you might not say you might not say that I don't have conviction one way or the other on this I'll tell you that but many people many people in this community that we Fellowship in throughout the world really they'll talk about Christmas and Christmas trees and and they'll talk about a certain thing and and they'll say well in their mind we don't have a Christmas tree and look at all these heathens that have Christmas trees as I said I don't have I don't care but what happens is is you start putting down the other people that may do that and by doing that you are exalting yourself over that person and and you are saying I am better than you because of this and and you're cutting them out and then that becomes your Doctrine and this circle is around it and you think you're better and it could be anything I just used Christmas tree because it's coming up on Christmas so what happens many times is that person we're on this path to Christ and if our eyes are set on Christ then we're we're going to go the right way so we're going along and then this person starts drawing a circle with a Doctrine saying that whatever it is and it might be right it probably is many of these doctrines are very very correct and according to God's word but you build this circle and that person you're pointing at they just change lanes and they go right around you and they continue on towards Jesus Christ be and I'm talking to myself here because I've I've made all the mistakes we need to make sure that we're not building a circle around ourselves build those circles around other people and draw those other people's in even though if they might not agree with our doctrines um we look at we look at science science is a good example we've I read a couple days ago we were talking with the kids about the human genome and how they mapped the the human genome it was one of the greatest Feats that science had ever done they M this this double helix the strand of DNA and they are able to with the combinations that are in there they are able to identify every form of life and not only every form of life but every individual form of life within those forms of life amazing amazing thing that they've done and I think they just have filled in all the gaps here recently and as they're going through they're saying okay we figured this out everything we understand now we understand this Human Genome we understand DNA and now they can like they caught the guy that killed those college students just because he touched a a button on the knife sheath that he he he killed the kids with just a little bit of DNA and they were able to nail it down to one person and so science has progressed more in the past 20 years than it has in the first 6,000 years and it's going faster and faster and faster but I'll tell you in 50 years they're going to look back and they're can say they're going to say okay well that was our understanding for that day but we're far beyond that now and same thing with us that's how we should be Paul said when I was a child I thought as a child and I spake as a child and we are children and the same thing with Christianity and with learning about the Lord we learn something Lord this is wonderful this is the greatest thing that's ever happened to me continue on with that and continue on on the path to Christ don't stop don't stop right there follow follow that path that God has set before us again Paul said I am determined not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified Paul's eyes and the reason he was so successful the reason he was such a wonderful man and a wonderful Minister and the reason that we still read his writings today is because his path was set on Christ his eyes were set on on Christ he didn't deviate from that and as if God can have a man like that or a woman like that he will continue to bless us with more Revelation and more Revelation and the more revelation we have the closer we will get to God until one day we will be one with that word we will be one with Christ and that's the day that I look forward to so much and that's the day it's like okay Lord my failures are over right now they're with me every day but I look forward to that day that those those failures will be gone Jesus said he said if you abide in me right and my words abide in you he said ask what you will and it will be done how beautiful if we abide in Christ and we follow that that cross we follow that way keep our eyes on that continue on that path and even Peter himself Jesus's disciple he told us he's like hey keep progressing keep getting better don't just stop because you got something don't just stop because you saw a sign he said in in second Peter chapter 1 verse4 he said whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye might be partake Akers of the divine nature very important divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all deligence add to your faith virtue add you're not there yet Peter's saying add get closer to God add to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge add knowledge keep studying the book keep listening keep praying keep going add knowledge to that you're not done yet and to knowledge Temperance chill out don't get mad Jesus didn't get mad if somebody did him wrong he loved him for it add to your virtue knowledge to knowledge Temperance and to Temperance then add patience keep going don't stop okay you you got temper you got the temper under control but now add patience patience with what patience with each other and patience with God lord your word says if if I abide in you and your word abides in me to ask what you will and it shall be given to you well where is it patience patience it'll come and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and brotherly kindness what's the top charity love that's the top so we are constantly adding to our walk with the Lord don't stop keep moving for if these things be in you and abound not just I didn't lose my temper today they need to abound always just bubbling forth always coming out abounding not just you show it one time but these things are always in your life they abound and they make you that ye shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus the focus is on Christ the focus is on Jesus he gives you Revelation make sure that you continue on going to Jesus but he that lath these things is blind watch this and cannot see a far off it's very very important part of it if you don't have these things you're shortsighted here you're just looking at this little thing that you've created around yourself and you're not seeing the end of the road down there you're not seeing that that this is just a sign that God gave you continue on believe the sign listen to the sign don't ignore it but do what it says and continue on to that cross to Jesus Christ they've forgotten that he Jesus was purged and ha forgotten that he The Sinner by Jesus Christ was purged from his old sins right here again it tells us as Hebrews 121 said in 122 don't neglect Christ he you were purged by Jesus Christ you've been saved don't stop keep going in every aspect of your life now let's get to Romans chapter 8 and this is this is what I wanted to be my subject here Romans chapter 8 ver 26 this is going to encourage you and it's just a a beautiful beautiful chapter likewise the spirit also the Holy Spirit also help helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself make intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered so the Holy Spirit speaking the words to the father for us and he that searches the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercessions for the Saints according to the will of God and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are called according to his purpose it's a famous verse and all all of us I'm sure have found comfort in that that verse but the Apostle here we forget about the rest of it the Apostle here is going to dig deep into what he said about these things for working for the good and watch this for whom he did Forno he also did predestinate to what we say that we are predestinated we are the predestinated seat of God and everything's predestinated we're all listen everyone is predestinated everyone has a path set before them and God knew what every person what turns they were going to take what failures they were going to do and he knew the ultimate D destination of every person so it's beyond just being predestinated predestinated to what listen to this to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren so we are conformed to the image of Jesus Christ that's what predestination is that's what we long for is to be like Jesus for whom he did Forno he did also predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren the Amplified version of that verse says this for those he fornew and loved and chose beforehand he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his son and ultimately share in his complete sanctification so that he Christ would be the firstborn the most beloved and honored among Believers now now the Amplified version remember that's it's Amplified it's added to um but what what the author there is saying he's helping us to understand the context in which this was written verse number 30 moreover whom he did pred destinate now he's talking about the True Believers here them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified I love that word Justified it doesn't mean that I was forgiven of my crime it doesn't mean I was forgiven of my sin as I was standing here on Wednesday night and I was like Lord what did I do and I was praying about it afterwards as I was praying there was all these mistakes that I had made coming into my mind it doesn't mean that I'm forgiven for those mistakes it means that I am justified it means I never did them in the first place I never committed a crime you can't pers prosecute me because I wasn't I didn't do it you know who did it it's a sad story Jesus Christ is the one that took the blame he stood for me he stood for all of us he is the one that was condemned him that was without sin was condemned from me but thank God he did and I love him for it I'm going to try to live my whole life for him because of what he did for me what shall we say then what shall we then say to all these things to these things if God be for us who can can be against us all things are working for the good as he said as he said earlier these things all things are working for the good to them that are called according to his purpose everything's good you may be sick but it's for his purpose you may have listen to this you may have sinned you may have made a mistake but if you are predestinated to the image of God it'll work out for the better it will work out for your own good and it will also work out for the good of others so if I made a mistake in my life if I sinned I'll answer for those sins in the flesh if I sin in the flesh I have to I have to live with my flesh but so I'm not saying that if you've sinned and you've done something wrong then oh it's okay because that was that was um you know what I'm talking about if if you've done something wrong in the flesh you will suffer in the flesh if I go out and get strung out on drugs and I'm shooting up with meth or whatever it is and I give my heart to the Lord and I change I will probably still have the effects of the drugs as long as I live but it's not accounted to me afterwards I am justified I didn't even sin in the spiritual realm so if God allows us to make a mistake many times it is to see what you are going to do about it he'll let you fall all God has to do is take his hand off of you for one moment we'll all fall all of us we are we are are sinners born in sin shaped in the iniquity of the world come to the world speaking lies all of us are it's only by the grace of God that there's any good in any of us and if he takes his hand off of us we'll fall but sometimes he does he'll take his hand off of us and allow us to fall and then we struggle and we get back up and that's why friends sometimes don't when somebody Falls be careful about just pushing them down it's easy when when someone like like my son there a big stocky guy if he's standing toe-to-toe with any of us um we probably none of us would probably do well but if he's on his knees and he's trying to get up it's real easy just to push him down doesn't matter how strong he is and he's trying to get up push him down it doesn't matter how big and strong or how much more powerful Daniel is than me if he's if he's on his knees and he's wobbling and I just push he'll go right over so be careful with that with somebody that is trying to get up that's somebody that's maybe fallen into sin don't push them down grab them and pick them up and then they they can get their feet on the ground and square up to the enemy all of us need that sometime we need that encouragement and that encouragement I read that uh testimony on Sunday night about that that young lady who was she was living in sin in a in a homosexual um lifestyle and and she was in drugs and all of these things and one man in a church she was coming to a funeral and that man there was there was a congestion there he moved over and he said these words excuse me sister and just him calling her a sister that was what changed her life that he respected her enough to call her a sister he didn't condemn her she looked terrible he didn't condemn her you know what he did he reached down he picked her up and she got both feet on the ground and she gave her life to Jesus Christ she set her sights on that cross right there running towards it and God kept filling her and filling her and giving her more and giving him more and she is on the journey today just like all of us are thank God for that man in his one little kind word call her a sister remember how job these these bad things that happened to us and how we can say Lord why did I do why why am I going through this why I didn't I didn't do anything to deserve this this wasn't my fault and God's like looks down but I wrote to you in the from the Apostle Paul all things work together for the good what part of that do you not understand here's job his family was gone his life his whole livelihood was gone even his wife hated him was disgusted by it what job said though he slay me yet will I serve him it doesn't matter I deserve it and all of us do but sometimes he will let us fall so we can get back up and we can have that experience and maybe do you think it's if I've fallen and I see somebody down there I'm G to grab them pick them back up brother I was there I've been there and sometimes if someone needs counseling or if someone's hurting I'll Point them to someone who's gone through it go talk to this brother go talk to this sister and those experiences that we've experienced that we're ashamed of now they can be used for the good to help other people where we at verse number 32 let me read verse number 31 first so we can keep it in context here what shall we what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things give us all things what does that mean well so we're going to maybe have to suffer and we're going through this but all things work together for the good and and brother it's it's easy for you to say but I'm the one suffering right now as as many times our attitude imagine the disciples probably the worst thing that had ever happened to them here they are with Jesus they're Healing The Sick and casting out devils and and people like Mary Magdalene and Mary of Bethany are coming and they're coming and falling down and and giving their hearts to the Lord and you have the woman at the well who was who was in sin and and doing her thing and Jesus converts her and then she goes and she's telling everybody about this man Jesus this prophet and all of this is happening and all of this is great and he comes in to the city and he's riding on this donkey and everybody is is singing hosan and waving the Palm leaves and here he comes and they're walking they're walking with the Lord Lord Jesus and they're happy and then all of a sudden a couple days later he's on the cross dying condemned as the worst vile criminal imagine the disciples that was the worst thing that ever happened to them they're like how could we have been so wrong of course he was a prophet but the Messiah couldn't be hanging on that cross that doesn't make sense the lowest that they could have been was right there at that time but God blessed them all they remembered what Jesus said and they kept their eyes on him even though they failed Peter failed John failed they all ran away from him but yet they still wanted to keep their eyes on Jesus and that friends keeping your eyes on Jesus and conforming to that image of of the Cross conforming to that image of Christ that's the qualification for predestination it's not that God gave you a revelation he gives all of us Revelations he gives everybody Revelations but will you conform to Christ he said if you love me keep my Commandments do what I say some people say oh well nobody can do it yes you can he wouldn't have said it and if you fail what you will keep trying get up keep going verse number 33 what happens if we fail if we sin we're going along our our eyes are on Christ and we totally mess everything up who can lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justifi not the law not that you broke the law and you did your time not any of that it's God that justifieth these things God is working on those who love him we surrender ourselves and our sins to God that's it's it's everything to us as I said with with with me I had to lay down when I was in that car that night and I said I'm full of all these doctrines I'm just I'm I'm filthy I'm sorry I I have all of this way of thinking and I've cut out all of these other people and here I am in my legalistic ways legalistic in a bad term in this way not not legalistic in living a good life and following what God Said but legalistic in exalting myself over someone else and here I am feeling filthy Feeling Just condemned of being a sinner because I did that and what did I have to lay down what did I have to lay down to keep my eyes on Jesus Christ I had to lay down my religion it's a very strange thing I had to lay down my way of thinking I had to revisit these Revelations that I've had and say you know what God those things were true but I took it to a place that God didn't want it to go and what did it do it encircled me and in my mind made me better than someone else that's why I used the analogy of the Christmas tree you can go and have a tongue a mile long running people down and doing all these other things but I don't have a Christmas tree I don't have one either we do oh we have a bush but it's it's meaningless it's ridiculous I have a conviction in my heart about many many things but check it with this word that's the most important thing and sometimes like I did sometimes you have to lay down your religion I heard a song when when I was um going through this time about three years ago I heard this song on the radio and I thought Lord thank you says this it saysi want to know you Lord he says like a friend so I want to know you Lord so I'm laying down all my religion I want to know you Lord I used to think I could box you in but I'm laying down I want to know you lord lord I've been told to be ashamed Lord I've been told I don't measure up Lord I've been told I'm not good enough but you're here with me and I reach out and you find me in the dust you say no amount of untruths can separate us he doesn't say you're laying the word down we don't lay this word down this word we lift up but we lay down our understanding that we lean on so much we lay that down down and because I know that my understanding is flawed and so is everyone else here the Pharisees and Sadducees they all had their religion but friends listen to this they didn't have a relationship they had a religion but it didn't produce a relationship with God what a shame that's not what I want for my life it's not what I want for my family's life or for this Church's life if I could if we could just get to Jesus Christ on that road following that cross keep that in your mind keep that in your in your always in your sight then you'll get there like when you're driving around Tucson Tucson's so great because you're like okay well I need to go over there and it's at the foot of the Catalina is over there so you can just weave around whatever Road you want to go and you'll eventually get there because you can see the destination and that's how we are with the cross just keep your eyes on Christ and know nothing else as Paul said this isn't me Paul I want know anything else just Jesus Christ verse number 34 who is he that condemneth it is Christ Christ that died yay rather is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also maketh intercessions for us it's not of works-based Salvation it's all about Jesus and he is now at the right hand of God making intercessions for you and me so if Jesus is at the right hand of God making intercessions then there's somebody also in that place condemning me we all think of Satan down in hell you know and he flies up and and does his thing and then flies back down the word says he's not the word says he's with God right now and you know what he's saying accusing the Brethren he's saying Daniel Evans lied Daniel Evans had a bad thought surely she did this or that constantly condemning us constantly accusing us you know what let's read it Revelation 12 verse 9 and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan now this is something that's about to come that's about to take place which deceived the whole world he was cast out into the Earth and his angels were cast out with him and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of Christ for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down so he wasn't down he was up which accused them before God day and night this is happening right now as I am speaking it's happening to all of us Satan himself is there accusing each one of us each one of you each in me also and they and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives unto death Satan is now with us was now with God accusing us day and night so what Spirit what spirit is on me if I accuse you think about it if I lay an accusation to you brother Tony what's spirit is on me even though it might be true what spirit is on me it's the spirit of Satan because he's doing it right now now correction is different correction is done out of love because you love the congregation you say stay away from this because this will harm you and you say I might go to one of the brothers or one of the sisters and say don't do this because this will lead to hardships in your life those back to your question about the eighth messenger and what these ministers many of these ministers do they use accusation to rule constantly accusing the members of sin then they use those accusations to put fear in the people and then they hold the sin over their heads and by doing this they remove the blood of Jesus Christ from the congregation and replace it with the with the authority of the Ministry let me ask you do you want the blood of Jesus Christ or do you want the authority of the ministry yes sir me too I want the blood of Jesus Christ I don't want to be under the control of a priest as they've always been I want to be under the control of Jesus Christ and the blood for my sins the um musicians can come and I'll let's go back to Romans 8 I read this last Sunday and I think it Bears repeating so here we are Satan accusing Jesus standing in the Bree between us and Satan saying no Lord wasn't Manny it was me Jesus your son that did this I'm the one that did it I'm the one that took his I'm I'm the one that committed the sin or that sin it wasn't him the father looks down he looks down at the blood of his son Jesus Christ and he says you're Justified you didn't do it there's there's the blood of my son he's the one that suffered he's the one that took the guilt every single one of us Satan there accusing accusing accusing and then who shall separate us as we can say who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or Peril or sword Romans 8:35 as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us I am a predestinated son of God conformed to the image of Jesus Christ everything that he said I want to be for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature no church no Pastor no priest no one shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord wonderful are you happy are you thankful that we are predestinated to conform to the image of Jesus Christ the son of God and as we're walking down friends as we're walking down this road that is laid before us and we're going and we may take a wrong turn and we got to get back to the to the road that God has set before us and we we go through look up don't look at the road look up and you can see the sign the sign and say that these are the last days the sign can say that in before the coming of the son of man it'll be in the it'll be like it was in Sodom it'll be like it was in the days of Noah it's a sign wow Lord the days of Sodom wow we're here the days of Noah the violence and everything that's going on we're here wow I'm looking at two signs right now there's there's there's Sodom and then there's Noah right here in the middle of them keep going with your eye on the cross knowing that you're on the right Road amen friends we are and a step that we have to get there there's many there's many stops on the road but one of the stops on the road is to say Lord I'm wrong Lord I Repent of my sins I have done I I have messed up I've I've done this and this and this this and this and you take those sins we've been going through the Old Testament God bless you Sister Erica good to see you um you take those sins that you have done we've been going through this Old Testament The Book of Leviticus Deuteronomy numbers you take these sin here is that innocent sacrifice you lay your sins on that sacrifice and then that sacrifice is killed you repent of your sins you go back and you say Lord I laid my sin on you once again once again I don't want to do it anymore and you start walking that narrow line always with your face up and looking towards Christ and then one of those steps after you repent after you repent then you are baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of those sins you're placing those sins right on the sacrifice and that's friends you just place them on it you don't have to jump through any Hoops you don't have to yeah you don't have to do all this Penance and all all of that you just lay them on Jesus Christ and he takes them and you make that commitment to serve him and one way one of the stops on that road is to be baptized to say Lord here's my past now I am going to make this step in front of these people I am going to be baptized in the name of your son Jesus Christ to show these people I am a different person and I am not going to sin anymore I'm going to do my best not to lay any more sins on that blessed that blessed sacrifice that's the stop along the road that we must take you may have been baptized before you may have never been baptized but if there was no repentance with that baptism or if there needs to be another repentance saying I am going to stop right now I am going to go right back I'm going to be on that road my mind my eyes will be on that cross my whole life it's a good time right now to be baptized and to make that commitment to walk in that path friends my whole sermon don't look down don't look to the side look up man that cross is right there brother look up because our Redemption is drawing nigh oh I love it you're walking along the road you're going sign sign sign sign the Bible says look up it's time your redemption's here and it's time if you want to be baptized do we still have baptisms praise the Lord if you want to be baptized if you could see um sister G there are some sisters to be baptized or brothers if you could see the brothers in the back let me tell you this predestination thing I got to get closer I love you so much this predestination we are predestinated don't just stop the sentence right there we are pre predestinated to conform to the image of Jesus Christ how great Jesus I want to be like him there is my predestination I want to be like Christ he walked a perfect life if you if you use me as an example or use anybody else in this building as an example they failed but he never failed he is just he is so wonderful when I felt friends when I when I felt that presence when I felt that presence in in the room I was just I was laying in my bed and it was just so wonderful I never wanted it to leave it was such love and just such beauty and I I was like oh God this is great questions I don't care all things are working for the good I'm messing up and I know that I I've failed so many times but it's all for the good just laying there in his presence for as long as it lasted oh don't you just want to be in his presence I wish I could
