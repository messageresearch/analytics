TRANSCRIPT
========================================
his word. &gt;&gt; Can we stand? We'll open our prayer. Our father, we thank you Lord for this day. Thank you for life. Thank you for your word. Lord, I pray that as I expound a little bit on the scriptures this evening and Lord, we worship you in song that father that it would be pleasing to you that you give us wisdom and and Lord give us the proper way to worship you Lord. Right songs, right spirit in Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. You can be seated. I u I've got a couple questions um that I have received and I wanted to address um something that I think has been on the heart of quite a few people especially the people the Sunday night people and the Wednesday night people and I um want to uh maybe give a little explanation in the word about what's I feel is going on and uh then I want to encourage anyone to come to me personally if you have any questions and I'll be happy to answer any questions that you might have. Let's I'm sorry those that are in the back. I uh I'm just going to be doing this the oldfashioned way with my good old King James Scoffield Bible and no notes at all. Can we turn to Ephesians chapter 4? Let's start with verse number 11 if we could. Ephesians chapter 4 verse 11 very common verse that many people are are acquainted with. And he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ, till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. that we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the slate of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in weight to deceive, but speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ, from whom the whole body from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint joint supply according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love. Now let's also turn let's go to 1 Corinthians chapter 12. Hold on to that Ephesians 4 and we'll go back to that. 1 Corinthians chapter 12 and we will start with let's just start with verse one and we'll go through verse number 12. Verse number one. Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant. You know that you were that you were Gentiles carried away unto these dumb idols, even as you were led. Wherefore I give you to understand that no man speaking by the spirit of God calleth Jesus a cursed and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost. Now there are diversities of gifts but the same spirit. And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord. And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which workketh all in all. But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit with all. For to one is given the spirit, given by the spirit the word of wisdom, to another the word of knowledge by the same spirit. To another faith by the same spirit. To another the gifts of healing by the same spirit. He's he's making a point. He keeps referring to the same spirit which is the Holy Spirit. and to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another discerning of spirits, to another diverse kinds of tongues, and and to another the interpretation of tongues. But all these workketh that one and the selfsame spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will. So the Holy Spirit there, he is dividing these gifts among the body of Christ. If we go back to Ephesians 4, these some apostles and some prophets and some teachers and evangelists and pastors, those are gifts that are placed into the church that work for the body of Christ to introduce us to Jesus. Okay, we're together. That's that's pretty mainstream good plain doctrine. Now, one question that has been coming up and it's kind of where all of this craziness this past week happened and that is saying, "Well, brother Daniel, he's just throwing the message away. He's against the message and he's he's trying he's against it or he's a critic of it or something like that." That's not true by any means. But because I am different does not mean that I am against. I just read Ephesians 4:11. He gave some apostles and they're different than prophets and they're different than evangelists and they're different than pastors and teachers. So these gifts are placed into the church. And no, I don't care who you think you are, you don't have all of them. God placed you to fill a certain role in the church. All right? All of us that are in this room today, all of us have a role to play in the church. I'm my role is to be the pastor. And then we have brother Michael. His role to lead the worship. I can't do his role. Wish I could, but I can't. And neither can brother Michael be in my role. We are different. And these are two different gifts that have been placed into the church. Now look at the body of Christ around the world. Now we're going to talk talk about all of the Christians in the whole world. Okay? God sends gifts to those people. And the gifts that God chooses for us are the gifts that he knows we need. If you look at that Ephesians 4, and he gave some apostles and some prophets. So some apostles came to certain people and were able to convert them. Over here, the prophets came and converted them. And you just read the book of Acts and you can see all of this these things are the case. Paul said so people were they were arguing and uh let's go to fe let's go to 1 Corinthians chapter 1. Man this feels good just doing this the oldfashioned way. 1 Corinthians chapter 1 and let's go to verse number 10. And it says this. Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be perfectly joined together in the same mind, and in the same judgment. All right? He's saying that you should be one. You people that believe on Jesus Christ, you should be in agreement. For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them which are of the house of Khloe, that there are contentions among you. Now, think about today. Think about us. Think about uh the the problems that that we have had in the past week. And then think about your history and your whole life, Brother Joe. Think about the the divisions that you've seen over the years. It has been said to me that there that there are contentions among you. Everyone in these contentions thought they were right. Everyone in our contentions today thinks he is right. All right? Or there wouldn't be a contention. You don't knowingly go to battle if you know you are wrong. All right? You everyone thinks they're right. Every man thinks he's right in his own mind. Now verse number 12. Now this I say that every one of you saith. It pretty much covers everybody. Every one of you is saying I am of Paul. Okay. I am of Apollos. I of Cphus which is Peter. and I of Christ. Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul? All right. So, he's saying there are different messengers, different preachers that are sent to different people because we need different things. I am different than you are, brother Joe. There are things that I need that you might need and there's things might not need. There's things that you need that I might not need. God provides those things because this is a just a bouquet of flowers around the world of God's people. And each one of us, God provides. He's made us to where we have a void in our lives. And God makes a way to fill that void. Okay, you with me? So then he gives diversities of gifts and diversities of ministries. And what you are seeing and some one of the things that that you're questioning about my ministry is that why isn't he preaching the way that I'm used to? Why isn't he um up here preaching about brother Brianna? Why isn't he doing that? You've never heard me say that that kind of preaching is wrong. Because I don't say that my ministry is different than this brother's ministry or that brother's ministry because God is using us to fill that void in different people. Do you understand? So in my ministry, the way that the Lord has has um led me is not to preach against anybody. I think that if we preached against someone, we would be doing exactly what Paul said, don't do here, saying, I am of Cphus or I am of Apollos or I am of Paul. He he he says, don't do that. Is Christ divided? And Christ should not be divided. But what he's saying is is God sends different gifts into the church. Go, let's go back to Ephesians 4. Let's read it again. Ephesians 4:11. And he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers. So what is he saying? That there are differences in the ministry. We are not all the same. We are different. But because someone is different, it doesn't necessarily make them wrong. You with me? There are different people called to different um there are different ministers called to those that need different things. For the perfecting of the saints. Okay. Now we see the purpose of it. For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry. Five different offices here. And really it's we don't want to just divide it into five. It's really an infinite number of different callings that we have. Five is just the best this is the best way to pretty much encompass all of them, but there's like there's there's probably someone between an apostle and a prophet. You know, it's like, well, well, this guy, he's not exactly an apostle. He's not exactly a prophet. You don't have to put yourself in one of those categories. God has has or has [clears throat] or ordained you to be the person that you are for a purpose for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till now this is it this is the subject till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ we see that that no matter how many different ministries there are there's Daniel Evans and Israel Poe and Doug Baker and and um Joseph Branom and all of these different ones. All of us have a different ministry but we all should have the same goal and that is the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the son of God. It all comes to Jesus. So here I am and the gift that I have is for evangelical for for to bring people to the Lord. That's my gift. You don't see other message churches with new people coming in. That's not against them. That's just my that's my gift. But then you don't see me breaking down brother Brandham's message and and all of that because that's not my gift. That's someone else's gift. And they are perfectly right in what they are doing as far as I'm concerned. And I believe I am doing what the Lord called me to do. And that's why you see what's happened in our church. God made me in a way. And I've been I've my ministry has kind of done this and this and this. Okay, now it's kind of settled on the way that I teach, which is going into the Bible, going verse by verse, line by line, and applying this Bible to our lives. Okay, pretty simple ministry. And that's what my ministry is. And it's not pulling this quote over here, that quote over there, and putting this in. It's not my calling. If I tried to do that, I'd get outside of my calling. And if somebody else tried to do what I'm doing, they would get outside of their calling. But it all is, put Could you put it back up there? The um Ephesians 4:12. But it is all working for the perfecting of the saints. And a lot of times, I said this morning, when we get defensive is when we make mistakes. I'm pointing to this guy. And sometimes I'll I'll get pressure and pressure and pressure and be like, "No, that is not my ministry. That's not what it is." And then I'll kind of get get strong on it. And I shouldn't do that. I don't mean to do that. What I'm trying to do is just stay within the calling that God has given me. Introduce people to Jesus Christ. Introduce them to the Bible. Encourage them to read their Bible. And move in that direction. That's my calling. I can't be different. I am not any of these other brothers and they're not me. I believe they have just as much of a calling and they are just as right as I am. This is the way that God has placed me here and he is using this church for that purpose for really the evangelical church. evangelical purpose, you know, I mean, Jesus said, "Go out and all go into the world and and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost." And that's that's what we are doing. We are going out and we're bringing in neighbors and we're bringing in friends and they're coming in and they are being delivered from drug addiction. They're being delivered from alcoholism. They're not sleeping with their girlfriends anymore. They're changing their lives. And that's what this church and that's what I am doing now. Other churches are doing something different. It doesn't mean that they are not just as right as we are and there's no competition there. But to have a church like we have, the most important thing that we can do is love one another. It really is as far as evangelical teaching. That is the best thing that we can do is they can come in and they can be loved and they can see that we love one another. But please friends, don't think that I am against anything. And you know what's amazing? I was telling brother Lyle. Brother Lyle actually. So what happened? So this what prompted this is about uh three minutes before we came out, brother Lyall and I were in the back praying and we were talking about this subject. And as uh brother Lyall was praying and I was we had our arms on each other and as brother Lyall was praying I felt like I was kind of like Lord what about these questions? I talked with brother Michael earlier about this very same thing and and I was like Lord I gotta what's am I wrong? I don't think I'm wrong because if I if I felt that I was wrong I wouldn't do it. But what what do you want me to do? What's right? And I felt like something said that this is your calling that we have different callings. And then that that that scripture was so important. Ephesians 4:1, we I think it's misused many times, but it just encompasses the ministry. That's the ministry. That's the guys behind the pulpit. And it encompasses that for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of the faith. You can't have unity with just one person. You have to have to to achieve unity, you have to have something to work with that is not in unity yet. And then you bring it into unity. And that means there's different pieces of the puzzle. Every piece of the puzzle is shaped differently, but they're all just as important as the other one. Merely, if you're doing a puzzle and you have two pieces missing when you're finished, what's the what do you want to do? You look under the table. You look under the chairs. You got to find these two pieces. It's like it's not it's not finished. It doesn't look good. I need to find those two pieces. I'm one of those pieces in the ministry. All right. And I am part of the puzzle. And what God has called me to do is to bring them in. Bring them in. And that's why you see that my ministry is more attractive to a certain group of people as brother Brandham's was attractive to a certain group of people. Brother Brandham's ministry was not attractive to the northern Indiana uh Methodist people. It was just they were too they were very rigid in the way that they were. They wanted somebody up there reading the Bible and then saying a few words and then that was it. Brother Brandham was out there with the oneness apostolic oneness Pentecostals and he was bringing people to be prayed for. He said one time that he said that Billy Graham's group was up there and he said they were all the you know a lot of money and and these rich people and and he says then they started going out and here come my people and he's like the crippled and the lame and the poor and all of those people. They're the ones that came in for brother Brandham but really what about the people that gave their hearts to the Lord under Billy Graham? They're still a soul. They're just different. And here's me. And my ministry really is to those that, as the King James Bible says, those that are without, those that are outside, that we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slate of men and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in weight to deceive, but speaking the truth in love, Now, that is one thing that every ministry should have in common. You notice he doesn't separate just saying that just the evangelist has love or just the pastor has love. They all have love. but speaking the truth in love. And they're all speaking the truth. But speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head, even Christ. Everyone should be moving towards this head which is Jesus Christ. No matter if you're breaking down quotes of brother Brandham or you're reading the Psalms over here, everything should be pointing towards the head which is Christ. From whom? The whole body fitly joined together. So the body has all of these moving parts, but they fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part. Every part. That's an important aspect of the scripture. The effectual working in every part. All right? Each moving part of an engine has a job. One of those parts break. Josiah had uh we fixed his truck I don't know months ago and nothing was working. It was stuck out in my driveway and and it it was just it was like the lights were on. it wouldn't start. It would turn over run, wouldn't start. And what it was is one of the battery terminals, there's there's the the post that the um attachment that goes onto the battery terminal, and then there's another attachment that goes into that post that both of these need power. Well, the small post that was going in on the positive side had some corrosion on it. just that little wire. We took it off. We cleaned it. Start it right up. That whole truck would not run because of that little wire. And that's how all of us are. We all have a role to play. And and Paul is saying here that every part, let's look at car parts. Every part is important. And if you don't have every part, the thing ain't gonna run. every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself once again in love. All right. Now I can answer I can we uh I wanted to get out here early. I can answer any questions. Is any questions friends? This is our small crowd. Any questions that are on your heart that I can answer? Brother Jordan, you're always the one that breaks the ice. Okay. Okay. Do you understand? So, when I'm up here and I'm preaching and I'm saying, "Get your nose in the Bible. Read the Bible." And I'm pointing to Jesus. And I'm saying, "Everything is to about him." And and and this Bible is the fullness. And you can't tell me that I can't preach this word that brother Brandham has to tell me what everything means. It's my ministry. And that brings in a certain group of people. That is not a ministry that brings in other people. It won't work for other groups. But every one of them is just as important. And every one of them is just as right in my opinion. That's why we should never because it and and I say this a lot. And now you know why. We should never condemn something that we don't understand. You with me? All right. We good? I hope I answered that question. Josiah just asked, "At what point does the church become wrong?" Let's use our church. I believe now I'm going to go back to the message for this that a church becomes wrong according to brother Brandham and the way that he taught a church becomes wrong when it organizes his ministry. I listen I still listen to him all the time. I've listened to him since I was born. I know it very very well. And the biggest point that brother Brandham made and he made it in almost every single sermon was against the denominations was against the denominational system. He used that scripture many times. Come out of her my people. And when we organize, what is organization now? How do how do we know when a church gets off? It's when we organize. It's when we say, "Now I am of Apollos." And here is what we teach and everyone else is wrong. To me, that is when a church gets off. That is when you move from the Holy Spirit into legalism and into false doctrines. That's in my opinion and I can back that one up over and over again with brother Brad. Any other questions? God bless you friends. I hope I hope that helped. You are a great blessing to me. I pray for you all the time. I I I think about you all the time and I um I can look in this and he gave some apostles and prophets, evangelists, pastors and teachers. I really think that the Lord called me to be a pastor to be able to um meet the needs of just this church and not go all over. Because if if I tried to go if I if I go to different places and I tried to minister the way I minister here, I don't think it would work all that good. Just it's a it's a different calling. Michael, we got a few song specials tonight. Uh excuse me, my sister Amelia can come up. We're going to sing a song and then um I believe she's got a song. You hold my every moment. You calm my rageing sea. You walk with me through fire. You heal all my disease [music] and I trust in you. Oh Lord, I trust in [singing] you. Cuz I believe [singing] [music] you're my healer. I believe [music and singing] that you are all I need. [music] Oh, I believe [singing] [music] you're my portion. I believe you're more [singing] than enough for me. Jesus, you're all I need. You hold my every moment. You calm my raing sea. [music] You [singing] walk with me through fire. You heal all my disease [music] and I trust in you. Oh Lord, I trust in [singing] you. Oh, I believe [singing] you're my healer. I believe [singing and music] you are all I need. [music] And I believe [singing] you're my portion. I believe [singing] you're more [music] than enough for me. And Jesus, you're all I need. &gt;&gt; God bless you all. You probably heard me a few times saying that I'm looking for a city. Well, guess what? I found that city and one day I will be going there. I'm going I am going to a city where the streets [music and singing] are golden Where the tree of life is [music and singing] blooming and the [singing] roses never fade. Here they [singing] bloom [music] by for a season. Soon their [music] beauty is decay. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; I [singing] am going to a city where the roses never fade. [singing] In this world we have our trles. Satan snares we [singing] must evade. [music] We will free from all temptations. Where the roses never [singing] fade, here they bloom [singing] before a season. Soon their beauty is decay. I am going to a city where the roses never fade. Love gone [music] to be with Jesus [singing] in the robes of wide array. They are waiting for my cup. Where the roses never fade, here they bloom before a season. [singing] Soon their beauty is decay. I am going to a city where the roses never fade. Where the [singing] roses never fade. Amen. I might read a couple scriptures between every song. Um, Elizabeth, I want to go back to your question and and I might, who knows, I might just keep keep doing this. The book of Galatians, what happened here? Galatians chapter 2, verse number two. What's going on here? This is also in the book of Acts. So, Galatians and Acts, there's a certain part that they're happening at the same time. There were two men that came from Jerusalem in James's church. James was the pastor of the church at Jerusalem. These are Christians. These are Jewish Christians. And they saw things a certain way. All right. Paul was very much like me in his doctrine. Very similar. It was um anti-legalism. But that doesn't mean James was not right. James was just as right as Paul was. So it says here James or uh Galatians chapter 2. And I went up by revelation and communicated with them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which are were of reputation, I believe that means the Jews, lest by any means I should run or had run in vain. But neither Titus, now Titus was a Greek, all right? He's not a Jew. Neither Titus was with me. Oh, right there it says being a Greek was compelled to be circumcised. All right, that's a big deal. Huge deal that how come if you are a believer, how come you have not been circumcised or how come you dress this way or how come um you have this way of thinking? All right. And that's what Paul is saying here. He's saying that Titus didn't want to be circumcised. Now, Timothy did, but Titus said no. And that because of false brethren. Now, you see Paul, remember I said being defensive. Now, watch what Paul is saying here. But neither Titus who was with me being a Greek was compelled to be circumcised. And because of those false brethren, unawares, brought in, who came in privy to spy out our liberty, which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us unto bondage, back under bondage. What does that mean? It's like, listen, we are not under the law. We are we we are not following the rules. We're not doing that. That's good, but that is not this church is what Paul is saying here. James is like, no, you have to do that. You have to honor the feast days. You have to uh be circumcised. You have to do that. But do you see the two different gifts in operation? You have James, the pastor of the church at Jerusalem, traditional. And then you have Paul over here who knew the scriptures very very well, but his perspective was different than that of James. So who was right? They were both right. But Paul couldn't have preached his doctrine in James' church. And neither and see you see right here. And later on it says then then Peter totally didn't didn't have a backbone in this. Peter was with the Gentiles one night. Oh, and then these two guys from from James's church showed up, which is probably where Pet where Peter went to church. These two guys from James' church showed up and he's like, "Oh no, I can't eat with the Gentiles because they're unclean." I was like, "Yeah, last night you were eating with them." So, there's two different doctrines, two different perspectives on this. Both are right. I really want to just preach on this for a long time. That's a song service. Go ahead. Go ahead. I believe sister Hope has a song as well. We're going to sing another song and she can make her way up. I know who I am cuz I know who you are. The cross of salvation [singing] was only [music and singing] the start. Now I am chosen, free and forgiven. I have a future and it's worth living. Cuz I wasn't made to be tending a [singing] grave. I was called by name, born and raised back to life again. I was made for more. [singing] [music] So why would I make a bed in my [music] shame when a fountain of grace is running my way? I know I [singing] am yours and I was made for more. [music] I know who I am cuz I know who you are. [singing] The cross of salvation was [music and singing] only the start. Now I am chosen, [singing] free and forgi. Oh, I have a future and it's worth living. Cuz I wasn't [singing] made to be tending a grave. I was called by name, born and raised back to life again. I was made for more. So why would I make a bed in my shame when a fountain of [music] grace is running my way? I know I am yours and I was [singing] made for more. [music] Hallelujah. You called out my [music] name, so I'll sing out your praise. Hallelu. You [music] buried my past and I'm not going back. Hallelujah. You called out my [singing] name, so I'll sing out your [music] praise. Hallelu. [singing] You buried [music] my past, so I'm not going [singing] back. I wasn't made to be tending a grave. I was called by name. Born and raised back to life again. I was made for more. [singing and music] So why [music and singing] would I make a bed in my shame when a fountain of grace is running my way? I know I am yours and I was made for more. Please sing this with me. I'm sorry. The love of God is [music] greater than [singing] tongue or pill. [music] It goes beyond the The high star and kiss the [music] Lord still the guilty bow down with care. God gave his son to him his child. He [music] reconcile you and he oh love of God. How rich, how pure, [music] how meous and strong. It shall ever more endure. My saints [music] and angels sing when worry [music] times shall pass away and earthly thrones and [music] kingoms. When you hear [music] refuse [singing] to pray on rocks and [music] hills and mountain love so shall still endure. [music] Oh major and strong redeeing grace to [music] Adam's race the saints [music] and Oh love of God, how rich, how pure, how great and strong. It shall forever more endure the saints and gent [music] with the Ocean [music] and the skies of parchment made [music] on earth [singing] a queen And every day to write the love of God above. We dream. Or could the scroll contain the stretched from sky to sky? Oh love of God, how rich, how &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; True. True. Did you put that that verse up there? If we could ink or if we could be with ink, the ocean fell. Every man ascribed by trade to write the love of God above. Could we with ink the ocean filled? And were the skies of parchment made, and every stock on earth aquill, and every man ascribed by trade. To write the love of God above drain the ocean dry, nor could the scroll contain the whole stretched from sky to sky. Can you what words? I know that we could never write in words that could truly describe the love of God, but those are about the best I've ever seen. The story behind that is they were nobody knows the author of that verse that it was written on the wall of an insane institution. Um, Mr. Hope, thank you. So [snorts] great. So great. Oh, Brother Jordan sent me a another question. And uh Ephesians 4:11, he gave some apostles and some prophets, some evangelists, some teachers, pastors and teachers. I mentioned in passing, and brother Jordan is very sharp. He listens to everything that some people misinterpret that. And I think that they do. I've heard that the five-fold ministry takes the place of brother Brandham into the future. I've heard that many, many times that now it's the five-fold ministry that carries on this. You can never replace Brother Brand. Never. He came to fill a very very important role and no one should ever try to carry on um try to take his place. You just can't do it. He was something special. He was just different. But we are called in the ministry to preach this gospel and to lift up Jesus Christ. And brother Jordan, that's what I meant when I said that is no. I don't think so.

Fear God and keep his commandments for this is man's all. For God will bring every work into judgment, including every secret thing, whether good or evil. Go ahead and put that first verse up there. All the things that I've held dear, the vanities that whispered in my ear, what would I do if they all disappear? [music] Riches and fame, all that they could buy, have come to find. They never satisfy. What would I gain if my soul's the prize? I don't want to love what the world loves. I don't want to chase what the world does. I only want you. I only want you.

I hope that my answers helped a little bit the questions. My calling, friends, is this book right here. That's maybe the Lord's given me a little niche in all of this great this great economy of God for a Bible teacher. And I believe that's what he's called me to do. Brother Ron Gladwell, would you come up and close in prayer? Please, when you're praying this week, pray for our meetings. I believe the enemy um doesn't want us to have them. So please keep keep this week in prayer [music] that what I want. If I could have something that would give us some souls that would maybe come to this altar or give their hearts to the Lord this weekend, I think that would be just so great and so fitting. Brother Ron I don't want his job. My what a tough place. U I think all of us have our own ideas and how we think it should be. But my what where he stands I sure wouldn't want to be there. It takes a special gift for that. &gt;&gt; I believe he's sincere. And if I think he's went off in error, I told him, I pray for him. I know I'm never always right. But, you know, Jesus is always right. &gt;&gt; We all have our gift. I I have a pretty good idea what mine is. It's to stick around, endure, and remind you of things that are in my life. I mean, I can tell other stories, but why don't I do I have a story? And when I say this, I want you to think about your story. Every son and daughter of God should have their own testimony. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; You must have your own experience. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Every single one of you should be able to come up here and start talking until he tells you to stop. &gt;&gt; I'm just kidding. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; I'll never stop. I'll just pause for a little while. &gt;&gt; But you know, it it it's that way. He works with us all differently. We don't understand it, but we have to trust God. &gt;&gt; And as we pray, you know, it it it behooves us to find, and this is what I I do. You must find time alone. Find out who God is. Ask him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't take my word for it. Don't take his word. But &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He gives you good advice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I honestly believe that God is with me. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I honestly believe I don't understand everything, [laughter] &gt;&gt; but I know that Paul said to do everything in decency and respect and honor. &gt;&gt; And I think we should treat each other that way. &gt;&gt; Amen. a personal testimony. I'm not bringing them in by the groves, but I'll tell you what, if something was to happen, I am persuaded and he would preach my funeral. My neighbors would be there. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; We walk every day. We know them all by name. And you know what? I've learned to love them and they like me. I had a a man for Christmas. I didn't He brings over about $100 worth of gifts. He said, "I just appreciate you, neighbor." &gt;&gt; You know, that's our testimony. You know, go around your neighborhood, meet your neighbors, &gt;&gt; get to know them. They're real people. Amen. &gt;&gt; I seen a lady walking the other day and I just stopped and talked to her for a minute and she expressed some dilemma and I I gave her some advice. Two days later, she says, "Oh, by the way, I did what you said. Thank you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I I think we have a job to do. We a life to live. And as far as these disagreements, contentions, it it happens in families, but we're family, &gt;&gt; we're family, &gt;&gt; brother. I'm not going anywhere. &gt;&gt; I'm not. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm going to heaven, but &gt;&gt; you [laughter] &gt;&gt; So, &gt;&gt; can we pray? Oh God, I pray Lord that you have. Fill me with your spirit. &gt;&gt; I know, oh God, and I confess before these people, I am not the same person I used to be. I was witness to a little lady there the other day, Lord, and she said she had received you. And I told her, I says, "You know, I knew your sister in high school." I says, "She probably wouldn't even talk to me." And I told her, I says, "You know, I'm just not that same person. I'm just not." She wouldn't recognize me. And I and this little woman just started crying. She says, "I have a same testimony." She says, "Maybe you and your wife could come over and we will exchange testimonies." These times, oh God, that we interact with each human being that we encounter. Let it be a time, Lord, that we we reach out in love, Lord, to draw them in to you. Fill us, oh God. Make us salty, Father. I thank you for this place. I thank you for these people. Most of all, I thank you for your Holy Spirit and your wisdom and your guidance to teach us when to speak and when to be silent. I am just so grateful, Lord. I I feel your spirit here with us tonight, and I am thankful you have felt honored to be among us. Thank you, Lord Jesus. As we go to our different places, would you guide and protect each one as they return to their homes? May they remember the good things. And Lord, may they look to increase their experience with you and seek you with all their hearts and love you and love each and every one of us. I thank you Lord for this opportunity to confess you to my brothers and sisters and I ask that you would just continue to increase in me and these brothers and sisters until your coming and call us away. I ask this in the precious name the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. He's got it all in control. He's got it all in [music] control. [singing] He's put that reassur way down in my soul. He's got it all in control. I put my life [singing] in his hands. I put my life [singing] in his hands. So every road I walk down, I'm sure is in his plans. I put my life [singing] in his hands. My father knows what I need. My father knows [singing] what I need. And everything I go through, he knows what's best for me. [music] My father [singing] knows what I need. Amen. Ron said it. There's a spirit here. Sister Elizabeth, that's that evening spirit when we come together. That's what fills that void is what we feel right now. It's just different. It's just these solid believers that come together in unity and just in worship and loving one another. Sister Hope, [music] I thinking of how could someone say it better than that song that you sang. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword. As it is written, for thy sake we are killed all the day long. We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. Nay, in all things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. For I [music] am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. Praise God. You're dismissed. I hope to see you on Wednesday. We're going to play that sermon. What house will you build me? Wednesday night. God bless you.
