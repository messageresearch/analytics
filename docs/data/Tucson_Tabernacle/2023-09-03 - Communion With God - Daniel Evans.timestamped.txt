[33:29] chapter 13.
[33:32] I'll just read the first verse
[33:38] [Music]
[33:46] that is so good
[33:49] God is so good
[33:55] now before the Feast of the Passover
[33:57] [Music]
[33:59] when Jesus knew that his hour was come
[34:01] that he should depart out of this world
[34:03] unto the father
[34:06] having loved his own
[34:08] which were in the world
[34:11] he loved them
[34:12] unto the end
[34:15] Lord God we thank you for that love
[34:18] [Music]
[34:20] of Jesus Christ
[34:24] father bless us this evening in this
[34:27] service we pray
[34:29] in Jesus name amen God bless you all be
[34:33] seated
[34:36] thank you
[34:42] it's good to see everyone
[34:45] and the house of the Lord to take the
[34:48] communion
[34:50] tonight
[34:52] read a little bit of his word
[34:56] I I said some things this morning
[34:59] and if you know me I I
[35:02] a lot of times I'll beat myself up and
[35:04] think did I did I say that right or was
[35:07] I too strong or was it not strong enough
[35:10] and uh
[35:14] I don't think I was strong enough
[35:18] um
[35:19] when we cast out
[35:24] someone
[35:26] from our church
[35:28] when we make them not welcome when we
[35:30] shun them our families shun them and and
[35:33] we show
[35:36] really hatred
[35:38] toward toward them
[35:40] that is almost never correct
[35:45] as I said there's a place in First
[35:47] Corinthians I believe it's in chapter
[35:48] five
[35:50] that
[35:51] there was a man that
[35:54] was living with his father's wife I
[35:55] don't know if his his
[35:57] mother
[35:59] or if it was a stepmother but Paul
[36:02] judges the situation and and
[36:05] he
[36:06] his words were Eternal that person over
[36:09] to Satan for the destruction of the
[36:10] flesh
[36:11] so that his soul might be saved
[36:14] and it was an act of love
[36:18] and it was an act of compassion and then
[36:20] later on we see that that man returned
[36:23] to the fold and he was welcomed
[36:25] back in
[36:27] and I
[36:28] I see
[36:31] I'm so I'm so passionate about it
[36:34] because I've seen so many people hurt by
[36:36] things like that
[36:37] seeing people that today and there are
[36:40] many and you all probably know more than
[36:42] I know
[36:44] there are many people that don't want to
[36:45] set foot in a church because they've had
[36:48] such a bad experience
[36:51] I can't see how that is right and I
[36:54] don't believe it's right
[36:56] the Bible says that God is love
[36:59] now if we would were to there are
[37:02] reasons
[37:04] to put people out of a church there are
[37:07] reasons for that and and I don't deny
[37:10] that in the least I would never want to
[37:11] do it but even in this church there are
[37:14] people
[37:15] that I would say and I would tell them
[37:19] personally that you are not welcome here
[37:21] and that's because I know them and they
[37:24] would do harm
[37:26] to our people they would do harm to our
[37:28] children
[37:29] and
[37:31] I I couldn't let them come into this
[37:34] church
[37:35] because of the safety of the flock
[37:39] but if we put someone
[37:43] out because they're not dressing in a
[37:45] certain way or or they've Fallen to sin
[37:48] and they go and they're drinking or
[37:50] they're they're doing something that's
[37:51] wrong this church
[37:54] this may sound strange
[37:56] but our church should have sinners in it
[38:00] else why is it even a church
[38:03] Jesus said I was sent to the sick and
[38:06] not the well
[38:08] and I understand that A little leaven
[38:11] leavens the whole lump I understand that
[38:13] and we have to be careful with our
[38:15] congregation we have to be careful of
[38:17] the influences that we see from outside
[38:18] but we also should be careful for the
[38:21] lost souls that need to be here
[38:25] and I see the damage
[38:28] and I never
[38:31] I never want to see that I it breaks my
[38:34] heart and I hear more and more stories
[38:37] of people that just they they don't they
[38:40] have just such a bad attitude towards
[38:43] church and the people that did that will
[38:45] answer
[38:47] they're going to answer for those things
[38:49] that they have done I pray that they're
[38:51] able to make them right
[38:53] before the day of judgment
[38:55] I pray that all of us I pray that my
[38:58] mistakes that that I could make them
[38:59] right here the we're going to read
[39:01] tonight a scripture that says let a man
[39:03] examine himself we should be examining
[39:05] ourselves every day now I'm not talking
[39:07] about
[39:09] someone that gets offended because maybe
[39:12] I preach Holiness and modesty
[39:15] or someone that gets offended because I
[39:18] preach against uh premarital sex or or
[39:24] um marriage and divorce issues and all
[39:26] that that's that's just getting offended
[39:28] because it doesn't agree with you
[39:30] no you have no right to be offended at
[39:32] that and and no I'm going to continue to
[39:35] preach that because that's the word
[39:37] but when
[39:39] someone is sinning and needs help and
[39:42] they're outside throw them a Lifeline
[39:44] for heaven's sakes
[39:46] throw home something and pull them back
[39:48] in that's what we're here for is to take
[39:51] care of one another that's what a church
[39:53] is for it's not for a bunch of pompous
[39:56] hot house plants
[39:59] it's for people that are willing to be a
[40:01] Christian that are willing to serve
[40:03] others
[40:04] what if it was your children
[40:06] what if it's my children
[40:08] I would want someone that loves them
[40:10] I would want someone to bring them in
[40:13] put their arm around them
[40:15] say brother say sister this this life
[40:18] that you're living is not right
[40:21] lead them to the Lord Jesus that's
[40:24] that's what I that's what I desire
[40:26] that's what Christ did
[40:29] I mean some of the worst people in the
[40:31] in the whole country
[40:33] we're with Jesus and he led them to God
[40:37] and it was very strange doctrines that
[40:40] he preached
[40:42] and
[40:43] friends when we're when we're taking
[40:45] communion
[40:47] it's about bringing us together
[40:51] that's that's what we're going to talk
[40:52] about tonight is bringing the people
[40:55] together you wonder why I have been
[40:58] criticized not much but I've been
[41:00] criticized a little bit about about
[41:01] building rooms out there and and having
[41:04] something for the kids so that they they
[41:06] can enjoy themselves and then say well
[41:09] maybe it's about it's about fun and it's
[41:12] about games and it's not about church
[41:13] and it's not about the word but there is
[41:15] also a communion Factor
[41:17] there is also a factor of bringing the
[41:20] people together with fellowship and love
[41:23] for one another and drawing strength for
[41:25] one another I love to see the kids
[41:27] together
[41:28] helping each other
[41:30] we may have some that that are solid and
[41:34] then we may have others that need help
[41:36] and these ones that are solid can help
[41:39] these other ones of course we have to be
[41:42] careful and that's why we have
[41:43] chaperones that's why we watch over
[41:45] everything we don't want the other ones
[41:46] to pull the good ones down
[41:49] but we also want to lift them up
[41:52] if they're drowning get them out of the
[41:54] water
[41:55] help them
[41:56] that's what it's what communion is
[42:00] we commune with one another we come here
[42:02] we line up here we take the bread the
[42:06] body of Christ and the wine the blood of
[42:08] Christ together
[42:09] because we love each other Jesus got his
[42:12] disciples around together you can't take
[42:15] communion alone one of the most common
[42:17] questions that I received when I was in
[42:19] the ministry in Jeffersonville
[42:21] was can I take communion by myself
[42:25] and you can't
[42:26] also it's not communion
[42:28] communion means Fellowship
[42:31] so you can't you can't do that
[42:34] now there there were some we got some
[42:36] letters from some people in in India
[42:38] that were in Hindu areas that there were
[42:41] no Christians around and and they had a
[42:45] different different
[42:46] situation but almost all of them were
[42:50] that that well these people don't
[42:52] believe like me
[42:54] so how can I take communion with them
[42:56] well communion last I heard
[43:00] and I just read it
[43:03] was about Christ
[43:06] it was about the body and the blood of
[43:07] Christ what does that have to do with
[43:10] your rotten differences nothing it
[43:15] doesn't have anything it's about Jesus
[43:17] Christ now I know I understand there are
[43:20] different doctrines that the the closer
[43:22] we get to the Lord the more that we see
[43:25] the love of God expressed in many other
[43:28] things in Holiness and in and in the um
[43:31] the right way to to do things like
[43:34] baptism like
[43:36] like the way that we conduct ourselves
[43:38] as we move up
[43:41] then we get more revelation
[43:44] but the foundation is in Christ
[43:50] in the Garden of Eden
[43:52] we think about each other and how much
[43:54] we'd love to be with each other in the
[43:57] Garden of Eden
[43:59] God created this man what a masterpiece
[44:04] that he created this man named Adam
[44:07] he had all the
[44:10] he had all of the the trees and the
[44:13] grass and the animals and
[44:15] and he made it just perfect for his son
[44:20] and he was excited I'm sure about
[44:24] bringing this
[44:25] Sun into the world
[44:28] and
[44:29] he he speaks the word
[44:34] and we know the the story and the forms
[44:37] this Flesh and Blood Man Out of the Dust
[44:40] of the earth and there he is and and God
[44:43] has fellowship with this man
[44:47] with his son Adam
[44:50] and he looked it at him
[44:52] and
[44:54] he sees as a father he sees it's not
[44:59] good for man to be alone
[45:03] because God knew how it was
[45:06] to be alone
[45:08] that's why he created us he wanted this
[45:11] fellowship with us so he looks at his
[45:13] son at him and he says oh he needs
[45:16] Fellowship he needs communion
[45:19] and then he says what's the best thing
[45:22] that I can do for him
[45:24] he lets a deep sleep
[45:26] fall on him
[45:28] and he reaches in
[45:31] he takes out a part of Adam's Body his
[45:34] rib and then he makes
[45:39] a person to fellowship with his dear
[45:42] wife
[45:43] and I I look at that and I think there
[45:45] is the communion right at the very
[45:47] beginning God looks down he says it's
[45:50] not right for man to be alone
[45:53] I'm going to make him somebody to help
[45:55] him I'm going to make him somebody to
[45:57] love him I'm going to make him someone
[45:58] that he can he can grow with and that
[46:01] weakened fellowship and I can walk in
[46:03] the garden and I can I can sit down with
[46:06] my son and my daughter and I can talk
[46:08] with them
[46:10] what communion brother handy at the very
[46:14] beginning wouldn't you love to been
[46:15] there there was no sin
[46:18] there was no problems there was no
[46:19] sickness and we're gonna go back to that
[46:22] place
[46:23] one day we'll return
[46:26] they're they're his what he was with his
[46:28] children and and this just beautiful
[46:31] communion
[46:32] and then
[46:34] communion was broken by sin
[46:38] he came in
[46:41] and
[46:43] by this
[46:46] man
[46:48] the serpent God says I'll put enmity
[46:52] between
[46:53] your seed and the woman
[46:56] hatred
[46:57] there's hatred right there and here it
[47:00] breaks the fellowship
[47:02] and then we see it all Through the Ages
[47:04] we see we see pain and suffering and
[47:06] murder and problems and and and God
[47:09] didn't make it that way
[47:11] God made it to have perfect communion
[47:15] then down Through the Ages
[47:18] we see in
[47:20] I think it's an exodus
[47:24] chapter 20 verse 18.
[47:31] we see that God
[47:34] again
[47:35] desired Fellowship
[47:42] yeah it's right after the Ten
[47:43] Commandments God again desired
[47:46] Fellowship
[47:47] and he wrote These commandments so that
[47:50] the people would stop sinning so he
[47:52] could have more fellowship with them
[47:55] and that was the whole thing he knew
[47:57] that if if you will follow my
[47:59] Commandments
[48:01] you will commune with me
[48:03] we'll be closer
[48:05] so then
[48:09] and all the people saw
[48:14] and all the people saw the thunderings
[48:16] and the Lightnings this is when God was
[48:18] writing these Ten Commandments the
[48:20] thunderings and the Lightnings and the
[48:22] noise of the trumpet
[48:24] and the mountains smoking
[48:27] and when the people saw it they removed
[48:29] and stood afar off
[48:32] and they said unto Moses speak thou with
[48:34] us
[48:36] and we will be and and we will hear but
[48:40] let God not speak with us lest we die
[48:45] they wanted they were afraid
[48:49] to commune with God so they said well
[48:53] Moses is a little easier on us than God
[48:55] is so we'll keep our sins and we'll just
[48:58] have this Prophet speak to us and we
[49:00] don't want to speak directly to our
[49:01] father imagine how he felt
[49:05] put yourself in his position
[49:08] and they say
[49:10] well Lord I don't want to talk to you
[49:13] I'll just rely on brother Daniel here
[49:15] the pastor
[49:16] and then you can speak to him and then
[49:17] he can speak to me what an insult to God
[49:21] God says these are my children they
[49:24] don't even want to speak to me because
[49:25] they want to continue on in their sin
[49:27] and in their problems I want to have
[49:29] communion with them
[49:31] but yet they separate themselves from me
[49:37] think about God
[49:40] remember we are made in the image of God
[49:44] the Bible says that in the very
[49:46] beginning God made man in his own image
[49:48] so the feelings that we have when we get
[49:51] hurt if somebody doesn't want to talk to
[49:52] us maybe our children want to separate
[49:55] themselves from us
[49:57] God has the same feelings we have and I
[50:00] know he's God and I know he's sovereign
[50:03] but I'm made in His image
[50:06] and if I have feelings that I'm hurt
[50:08] because they don't want to they don't
[50:09] want to talk to me we see throughout the
[50:12] Old Testament God angers
[50:15] the people do something and it angers
[50:17] God
[50:19] so the feelings that we have
[50:22] God is there too
[50:25] and when we separate ourselves from the
[50:27] Lord and say Lord I don't have time for
[50:29] you I'll just go to church and I'm just
[50:32] going to rely on the past or maybe to
[50:33] give me a good sermon and then we'll be
[50:35] okay that's not it
[50:38] he wants to talk to you
[50:41] he wants to talk to me one-on-one I am
[50:44] his son
[50:46] not as the prophet told us God doesn't
[50:49] have grandchildren
[50:52] he has sons and daughters
[50:55] and he wants that communion with with us
[51:00] I hate to see
[51:03] I just I hate to see that communion
[51:05] broken
[51:08] I think it's in James
[51:10] chapter 4.
[51:14] on the Hebrew Epistles
[51:17] it says this
[51:19] it says submit yourselves therefore to
[51:22] God
[51:24] same theme as through the Old Testament
[51:26] and all through the Bible submit
[51:29] yourselves therefore to God
[51:32] resist the devil and he will flee from
[51:34] you
[51:35] now listen to this listen to this this
[51:38] is this is great this is like a
[51:40] highlight reel this is one of the the
[51:42] really good ones they're all good I love
[51:45] them all
[51:46] these are all my favorite every
[51:48] scripture is my favorite but this one's
[51:50] really my favorite
[51:52] draw an eye to God
[51:55] and He will draw an eye to you
[51:58] how beautiful is that are those those
[52:00] just few words
[52:04] God wants to fellowship with us Lord I
[52:06] want to do something I'm going to get on
[52:08] my knees I'm going to talk with you a
[52:10] little bit more I'm going to draw close
[52:11] to you and then guess what
[52:14] oh sweetheart I'm right here son I'm
[52:18] right here you made an effort to draw
[52:20] near to me he is always there he's
[52:24] always ready
[52:26] and then so much so that
[52:29] as as time went on and I said it this
[52:32] morning I want to say it again because I
[52:33] felt like
[52:35] the Lord was pleased when I said it
[52:38] that
[52:39] as God preserved
[52:42] Israel
[52:43] all down Through the Ages
[52:46] he was preserving them because he had
[52:49] made a commitment that the Messiah was
[52:52] going to come through this line of Judah
[52:56] he had to keep it there
[52:58] so so here comes this line and here
[53:01] comes Jesus Christ and it has all been
[53:06] about the Lord Jesus Christ from Genesis
[53:09] to revelation
[53:11] every bit of it is about the Lord Jesus
[53:14] because we can't be saved without him
[53:18] they threaten they threaten you with
[53:20] excommunication they threaten us with
[53:24] not not
[53:25] with having to come before the church
[53:27] and and make some and make some
[53:30] confession before the church you confess
[53:33] your faults to the person that you did
[53:36] wrong to that is who is responsible as
[53:39] those two people you do not have to come
[53:41] up here and confess all your faults in
[53:43] front of all the church that does no
[53:45] good but you confess them to the and you
[53:48] make it right to the person you did
[53:49] wrong
[53:50] are you going to carry that sin it's not
[53:52] going to go away
[53:55] All Through the Ages
[53:58] we see the Lord trying
[54:01] to just trying to fellowship with his
[54:04] people loving his people and the one
[54:06] thing that separates the god from people
[54:10] is the same thing that separate him in
[54:12] the Garden of Eden when they when God
[54:15] had his had his children around and then
[54:17] sin separated them and he had to cast
[54:20] them out
[54:21] because of sin
[54:24] and then there was a sin barrier between
[54:26] God and man this whole time
[54:29] and God didn't want that barrier it was
[54:33] symbolized in in the Tabernacle in the
[54:35] wilderness it was symbolized in the in
[54:37] Solomon's Temple that there was a a
[54:39] curtain that covered the holy of the
[54:42] holy of holies
[54:43] and it it was a barrier between God and
[54:48] the people and only one person could go
[54:50] in there a year once a year and that was
[54:52] the high priest and he went in
[54:55] and then the Lord descended
[54:57] and only him God didn't want it that way
[55:00] God wanted a fellowship with all of us
[55:04] everyone's equal everyone's the same
[55:06] importance sister Debbie you're just as
[55:08] important as I am he wants to talk with
[55:10] us we're all his children but the way it
[55:13] was because of the sin barrier he
[55:15] couldn't get he couldn't fellowship with
[55:17] us but he made a way he made a way
[55:20] through his son Jesus Christ that
[55:23] perfect sacrifice that no you don't have
[55:26] to be separated from me anymore you
[55:29] don't have to bring your your um
[55:31] offering and your sacrifice before the
[55:33] Altar and and kill it anymore that just
[55:36] covered your sin now you can fellowship
[55:39] with me and the blood of the Lamb of God
[55:42] covers your sins wipes them away that is
[55:46] when I God can fellowship with you
[55:50] beautiful story
[55:52] the most beautiful story that's ever
[55:54] told in the world is the story of Jesus
[55:57] Christ
[55:58] and here he comes he comes and he dies
[56:01] on the cross
[56:05] es Away The Sins of the people now the
[56:09] Lord is there now we can have Fellowship
[56:12] communion with him
[56:14] one-on-one
[56:16] and even more
[56:18] even more he said that's that's not I'm
[56:21] not God never disappoints
[56:24] and I mean that's not obviously that's
[56:26] like the greatest thing ever that our
[56:28] sins are gone
[56:29] but he says I'm going to add to it
[56:33] he says not only
[56:36] are your sins if you would accept the
[56:39] Son of God Jesus Christ not only are
[56:41] your sins wiped away
[56:43] but now
[56:45] I want to fellowship with you so much
[56:48] that I am going to come down not behind
[56:53] the curtain of the holiest of holies now
[56:56] I am going to come down and enter into
[56:59] your very body so I can be with you
[57:01] always
[57:03] Jesus said I will be with you always
[57:07] there is Jesus Christ in the form of the
[57:09] spirit comes down and enters in to men
[57:13] and women
[57:15] because he wants that Fellowship
[57:18] and then time goes on
[57:20] and we see at the very end of time
[57:23] all the way in we started in Genesis now
[57:26] let's go all the way to Revelation God's
[57:28] same nature is I want to fellowship with
[57:30] you in the same nature and man is
[57:33] I'm busy
[57:35] I got too much to do
[57:38] I like my life
[57:40] I like my sins
[57:42] I like what I'm doing
[57:44] and there Jesus is
[57:46] but
[57:47] I died for you
[57:50] I want a fellowship with you
[57:53] then all the way to the end
[57:56] Brother Andy this age that we live in
[57:59] right now
[58:01] and look what it says
[58:03] in Revelation chapter
[58:05] 3.
[58:12] here's the Lord Jesus
[58:16] he's given us all this the blood is on
[58:18] the the blood's on the cross the
[58:19] atonement's been made salvation has come
[58:22] to the Jews and to the Gentiles not only
[58:24] that but the day of Pentecost has come
[58:26] he came down in a rushing the sound of a
[58:29] rushing Mighty Wind and tongues of fire
[58:31] rested over 120 in the upper room he
[58:34] entered in and then those people came
[58:37] went out and they preached the gospel
[58:39] and more people received the Holy Spirit
[58:41] he gave gifts tongues started started
[58:44] they started speaking in tongues they
[58:46] healed the sick they cast out Devils
[58:48] they did all of these great things and
[58:50] then we see all the way here to the end
[58:52] and here's Jesus after he's done all of
[58:55] that
[58:57] wanting communion
[59:01] behold I stand at the door knock
[59:05] what a sad
[59:07] story
[59:09] brother Branham said this is the saddest
[59:12] scene in the whole Bible
[59:15] what I'm reading right now
[59:17] after everything that he's done and it
[59:19] is this age that we live in right now
[59:22] us here we are
[59:26] Revelation 3 20 behold I stand at the
[59:28] door knock
[59:29] If any man hear my voice and open the
[59:32] door I will come into him and I will sup
[59:34] with him and he with me
[59:38] to him that overcometh well I grant to
[59:40] sit with me in my throne
[59:42] even as I also overcame and sat down
[59:45] with my father in his throne
[59:49] he's a hathaneer
[59:52] that's
[59:53] that's a nice statement
[59:56] he that has an ear there's a deaf
[59:59] brother
[1:00:00] here somewhere
[1:00:02] but even he is without excuse because he
[1:00:05] can read it
[1:00:09] he that hathaneer all of us we are
[1:00:12] without excuse
[1:00:15] let him hear with the spirit saith under
[1:00:16] the churches
[1:00:19] and he just said
[1:00:21] behold I stand at the door and knock
[1:00:24] me Christ
[1:00:27] the man that died on the cross
[1:00:30] or his
[1:00:32] knocking
[1:00:34] and so few people would just open the
[1:00:37] door he said oh I would open the door
[1:00:39] but do you do I
[1:00:41] do I really do it do I really want him
[1:00:45] to come in and come into my house
[1:00:48] into my private areas
[1:00:51] into my very inner being do I really
[1:00:54] want him to come inside of me and
[1:00:57] commune with me
[1:01:01] do I want that
[1:01:03] I do
[1:01:05] I said at that at the altar sweetheart
[1:01:08] and this is even more important than
[1:01:10] that day I do
[1:01:13] I want that Lord Jesus I want him to
[1:01:16] come in and fellowship with me I Lord
[1:01:19] I'm sorry I'm sorry for all of my sins
[1:01:23] I'm sorry for for everything that I've
[1:01:26] done let me open that door come in
[1:01:30] come in come in
[1:01:32] come in and fellowship with me tell me
[1:01:34] Lord give me correction that is my
[1:01:36] favorite thing about this book
[1:01:39] I see
[1:01:42] it is my it's one of my favorite things
[1:01:45] but it's my favorite thing that leads to
[1:01:47] my really favorite thing which is
[1:01:48] salvation
[1:01:50] but
[1:01:51] it gives me correction
[1:01:54] and I love that do you love it when when
[1:01:57] you see it
[1:01:58] and and you read in this book or you
[1:02:01] come to church or or just you just get
[1:02:03] it from wherever you are and you get
[1:02:07] that correction
[1:02:09] you lied about that
[1:02:11] or you did that wrong
[1:02:13] or you were a little dishonest about
[1:02:15] this or you shouldn't have looked over
[1:02:17] here or you shouldn't have said that or
[1:02:19] you talked a little bit negative about
[1:02:20] that and then that little correction
[1:02:22] comes in oh it feels so good
[1:02:25] man I love that
[1:02:27] Daniel was a baby
[1:02:30] smack the TARTA little guy
[1:02:36] and you know what he'd want to do he'd
[1:02:38] want to love on me afterwards
[1:02:41] he just he just builds such it's like
[1:02:44] Daddy I'm sorry and then there was just
[1:02:47] such a love after that and that's how I
[1:02:50] feel when this book when it corrects me
[1:02:53] when God's word gives me the correction
[1:02:55] off Lord I feel so good thank you so
[1:02:58] much
[1:02:59] I just Lord I just feel so good I'm so
[1:03:03] grateful that I was able to make it
[1:03:05] right
[1:03:07] because we need correction
[1:03:11] and this book
[1:03:13] is full of it
[1:03:17] Jesus
[1:03:19] as I read in John 13 Jesus was coming
[1:03:24] for the Passover feast
[1:03:26] he had all of his friends there you can
[1:03:29] imagine
[1:03:31] he was
[1:03:33] very very upset because Jesus
[1:03:36] was the only one that knew that the next
[1:03:39] day he was going to be on the cross
[1:03:42] Jesus knew
[1:03:43] he understood
[1:03:45] and here's his disciples they had no
[1:03:47] idea
[1:03:48] they're around the table
[1:03:51] Jesus says one of you is going to betray
[1:03:53] me
[1:03:56] and they're like
[1:03:57] I guarantee you
[1:03:59] they're like oh man
[1:04:01] how many times have I messed up
[1:04:03] how many times have I betrayed the Lord
[1:04:06] and that's how that's how I would feel
[1:04:08] and and they're all saying is it me
[1:04:10] and then they're thinking wow I did this
[1:04:12] and and man I messed up over here or
[1:04:15] does it mean that betrayed you they
[1:04:17] wanted to make it right
[1:04:19] but then there was a dishonest one among
[1:04:21] them that had it in his mind what he was
[1:04:24] going to do
[1:04:27] and he said is it me
[1:04:30] Jesus agreed with him
[1:04:34] so then he leaves
[1:04:36] and Jesus has
[1:04:38] his people
[1:04:40] around him
[1:04:45] John Chapter 13 Verse 21.
[1:04:53] when Jesus
[1:04:55] had thus said
[1:04:57] he was troubled in spirit
[1:04:59] and testified and said verily verily I
[1:05:01] say unto you that one of you shall
[1:05:03] betray me
[1:05:04] the disciples looked one on another
[1:05:06] doubting of whom he spake
[1:05:08] now there was one leading on Jesus's
[1:05:10] bosom one of his disciples whom Jesus
[1:05:12] loved Simon Peter therefore beckoned to
[1:05:15] him that he should ask
[1:05:17] who it should be
[1:05:19] of whom he spake
[1:05:21] then lying on Jesus's breast saith unto
[1:05:24] him Lord who is it
[1:05:26] Jesus answered answer answered and said
[1:05:27] it is to whom I shall give sop when I
[1:05:31] have dipped it and when he had dipped us
[1:05:33] up he gave it to Judas his care at the
[1:05:34] son of Simon
[1:05:35] and after the stop Satan entered into
[1:05:38] him
[1:05:38] then Jesus said unto him that thou doest
[1:05:42] do quickly
[1:05:44] verse 34.
[1:05:49] listen to this
[1:05:51] a new commandment here is Jesus Jesus
[1:05:55] Christ the Messiah God in flesh and here
[1:06:00] he is
[1:06:00] with his
[1:06:02] 11 disciples and and there were probably
[1:06:05] sisters there the Bible doesn't record
[1:06:07] them but they were there were probably
[1:06:09] some
[1:06:10] sisters around we know Mary Magdalene
[1:06:13] and we know Mary
[1:06:15] um and Martha and and the different ones
[1:06:18] I don't know if they were there
[1:06:21] but they were probably nearby
[1:06:25] Jesus said a new commandment I give unto
[1:06:28] you
[1:06:30] that ye love one another
[1:06:33] this is God speaking
[1:06:35] that you love one another as I have
[1:06:37] loved you
[1:06:40] that ye also love one another
[1:06:42] twice
[1:06:44] he says it
[1:06:45] a new commandment I give to you unto you
[1:06:48] that you love one another as I have
[1:06:50] loved you that you also love one another
[1:06:53] so how much Jesus loved us
[1:06:56] the very love of God very the the love
[1:06:59] of God made flesh
[1:07:02] because of the people because God wants
[1:07:04] communion for eternity with his people
[1:07:07] and he says now how much is how much is
[1:07:09] that have I loved you
[1:07:11] now you should love each other like I've
[1:07:12] loved you
[1:07:14] by this shall men know that you're my
[1:07:16] disciples if you have love
[1:07:19] one for another
[1:07:23] and Jesus
[1:07:26] they get up
[1:07:28] and walk out
[1:07:30] the room that they were in
[1:07:33] a walk
[1:07:34] down the valley brother Lyle
[1:07:37] and Jesus is preaching to him the whole
[1:07:39] time
[1:07:41] is it the Kidron Valley
[1:07:43] they walk they walk down the side of the
[1:07:45] mountain down into the Kidron Valley
[1:07:47] then they walk up the other side not
[1:07:49] very far
[1:07:51] going up at the foot of the Mount of
[1:07:54] Olives and there is a garden called
[1:07:57] Gethsemane
[1:08:00] Jesus goes and he prays
[1:08:05] John 17 verse 9.
[1:08:08] I pray for them
[1:08:10] I pray not for the world
[1:08:13] but for them which thou has given me for
[1:08:16] they are thine
[1:08:18] and all mine are thine
[1:08:21] and thine are mine
[1:08:23] and I am glorified in them
[1:08:26] and now I am no more in the world but
[1:08:29] these are in the world
[1:08:31] and I come to thee Holy Father keep
[1:08:34] through thine own name those who thou
[1:08:36] has given me look at his look at his
[1:08:39] worry look at what he was upset about it
[1:08:41] wasn't about himself
[1:08:43] he is worried about these people that
[1:08:45] were with him
[1:08:48] that they may be one as We Are One
[1:08:53] look at the closeness that we should be
[1:08:58] it's pretty hard for me
[1:09:01] to distinguish the difference between
[1:09:03] the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit
[1:09:08] I know that that they are one
[1:09:12] but I also know that they are different
[1:09:15] in a sense
[1:09:18] but Jesus how close is Jesus and the
[1:09:22] father and and it's like you know what
[1:09:24] it's hard brother Aaron it's hard for me
[1:09:26] to even distinguish between
[1:09:28] Jesus and the father I know one's the
[1:09:31] son and and and one's the Creator but
[1:09:33] then Jesus was there in Melchizedek
[1:09:35] he had no beginning of days or any of
[1:09:37] Life all things were created by Him and
[1:09:40] for him so it's it's hard for me to
[1:09:43] distinguish that and he said that they
[1:09:45] should love that they may be one like
[1:09:48] you and me
[1:09:50] us will be one as close as the father
[1:09:54] and the son are
[1:09:57] that's how close we should be with each
[1:09:59] other
[1:10:01] skip to verse 20.
[1:10:03] Jesus continues on he says neither I
[1:10:06] neither pray I for these alone but for
[1:10:08] them also which Shall Believe on me
[1:10:10] through their word
[1:10:12] there's me
[1:10:13] there's you
[1:10:15] that they may all be one oh he said it
[1:10:18] again
[1:10:19] as thou father art in me and I am thee
[1:10:22] that they also may be one in US
[1:10:25] that the world may believe that thou
[1:10:28] Hast sent me
[1:10:30] I've said it before
[1:10:32] and I'll say it again
[1:10:35] that the world will recognize that Jesus
[1:10:38] is the Christ by this scripture because
[1:10:39] of our love one for another because of
[1:10:42] our Unity the closeness that we have for
[1:10:45] each other he says right here Lord let
[1:10:47] the world see that I am the Messiah
[1:10:50] because of their closeness with each
[1:10:52] other
[1:10:55] i in them and now and me
[1:10:58] I'm sorry let me go back to 22.
[1:11:03] and the glory which thou gave us me
[1:11:06] I have given them that they may be one
[1:11:09] even as we are one i in them and thou
[1:11:11] and me that they may be perfect in one
[1:11:14] and that the world may know that thou
[1:11:16] has sent me and has loved them and that
[1:11:19] thou has loved me
[1:11:21] father
[1:11:22] I will that they also whom now has given
[1:11:26] me be with me where I am look at the
[1:11:28] communion that the Son of God Jesus
[1:11:31] Christ wants with us
[1:11:34] that they also whom thou giveth me may
[1:11:37] be with me
[1:11:39] be with me where I am
[1:11:41] that they may behold my glory which thou
[1:11:44] has given me for thou loveth me before
[1:11:46] the foundation of the world
[1:11:48] what a sweet final prayer
[1:11:50] from our Lord and savior
[1:11:53] o righteous father
[1:11:55] the world hath not known me
[1:11:57] but I have known thee and these have
[1:12:00] known that thou has sent me
[1:12:03] and I have declared unto them thy name
[1:12:06] and will declare it that the love
[1:12:09] wherewith thou has loved me may be in
[1:12:13] them and I in them there's the Holy
[1:12:15] Spirit Boom
[1:12:23] and again
[1:12:24] this is the only age
[1:12:27] it's Leo to see an age where there is
[1:12:29] that one
[1:12:31] that prayed that prayer
[1:12:33] standing outside the door and knocking
[1:12:38] trying to get in
[1:12:42] let's
[1:12:44] make ready for communion
[1:12:47] think about the honor that we have of
[1:12:49] coming together
[1:12:51] With Friends
[1:12:53] with family as a church think about this
[1:12:56] great honor that we have
[1:12:59] if the musicians would make their way
[1:13:02] and let's just take a few moments
[1:13:05] in quiet meditation
[1:13:08] before we go into the communion service
[1:13:10] in First Corinthians chapter 11.
[1:13:45] foreign
[1:14:03] [Music]
[1:14:26] foreign
[1:14:59] before I read the scripture I want to
[1:15:03] tell you all that
[1:15:05] it's an honor
[1:15:07] to be in this battle with each of you
[1:15:12] think back when our lord Jesus was here
[1:15:15] what I have wanted
[1:15:17] [Music]
[1:15:18] to live in that day
[1:15:21] knowing that there was two thousand
[1:15:23] years to come
[1:15:26] and what I wanted to live in this day
[1:15:29] when we could see Christ return at any
[1:15:32] moment
[1:15:33] I'd want to live in this day
[1:15:36] I believe it's a harder day today than
[1:15:38] it's ever been I believe this is a much
[1:15:40] more difficult time than it was 2 000
[1:15:42] years ago but I'm honored to be here and
[1:15:44] I'm honored to stand side by side with
[1:15:46] each of you
[1:15:50] I believe you want the same thing that I
[1:15:51] do
[1:15:56] for I've received of the Lord
[1:15:59] that which also I delivered unto you
[1:16:03] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[1:16:05] which he was betrayed took bread
[1:16:08] and when he when he had given thanks
[1:16:10] he'd break it and said take eat this is
[1:16:14] my body which is broken for you do this
[1:16:16] in remembrance this doing remembrance of
[1:16:18] me
[1:16:23] pause there for just a moment
[1:16:26] this do in remembrance of me
[1:16:33] [Music]
[1:16:37] and song There is a fountain filled with
[1:16:40] blood
[1:16:42] your sister Martha's playing right here
[1:16:44] we can see it
[1:16:46] and after the same manner also he took
[1:16:48] the cup
[1:16:50] which he had sup saying this cup is the
[1:16:53] New Testament in my blood this Dew ye as
[1:16:56] often as ye drink it in remembrance of
[1:17:00] me
[1:17:10] for as often as ye eat this bread
[1:17:14] and drink this cup you do show the
[1:17:17] Lord's death
[1:17:18] till he come
[1:17:23] where forever
[1:17:26] [Music]
[1:17:28] for as often I said for as often as you
[1:17:31] drink this bread as you eat this bread
[1:17:33] and drink this cup you do show the
[1:17:36] Lord's death until he comes
[1:17:41] wherefore
[1:17:42] whosoever shall eat this bread and drink
[1:17:44] this cup of the Lord unworthily
[1:17:48] shall be guilty of the body and blood of
[1:17:52] the Lord
[1:17:54] we have an open communion
[1:17:56] anyone
[1:17:58] within reason anyone who has a desire to
[1:18:01] come and take this communion
[1:18:04] is welcome to do so
[1:18:07] but I would like to remind everyone in
[1:18:10] this building wherefore whosoever shall
[1:18:12] eat this bread and drink of this cup
[1:18:15] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:18:17] and the blood of the Lord if you are not
[1:18:20] covered in the blood of the Lord Jesus
[1:18:22] Christ
[1:18:24] I would discourage you
[1:18:27] from taking this communion
[1:18:29] but if you have given your life
[1:18:31] to the Lord
[1:18:33] [Music]
[1:18:35] let a man examine himself
[1:18:38] and so let him eat of that bread and
[1:18:40] drink of that cup
[1:18:42] [Music]
[1:18:45] for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:18:47] unworthily
[1:18:49] eat it and drink his damnation
[1:18:52] to himself not Discerning the Lord's
[1:18:55] body
[1:18:57] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[1:18:59] among you
[1:19:00] and many sleep
[1:19:03] for if we would judge ourselves
[1:19:09] we should not be judged
[1:19:13] but when we are judged as I was saying
[1:19:15] before I love that correction
[1:19:19] but when we are judged we are chastened
[1:19:22] of the Lord that we should not be
[1:19:24] condemned
[1:19:26] with the world
[1:19:28] the brothers would come forward and make
[1:19:30] ready
[1:19:36] [Music]

[1:21:38] they will do that in obedience to your
[1:21:40] word Lord none of us are worthy

[1:32:48] for our sins
[1:32:50] we are to go back
[1:32:52] to our sins and and feel remorse and and
[1:32:56] say the Lord I'm not going to do these
[1:32:58] things anymore
[1:33:00] and then
[1:33:03] and then
[1:33:05] we are to be baptized
[1:33:07] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:33:10] remission of our sins for the taking
[1:33:13] away
[1:33:14] of our sins
[1:33:16] so I'm going to read
[1:33:19] the clothes of the feet washing
[1:33:23] and brother brother Ron if you could
[1:33:25] come if you could come forward
[1:33:28] um
[1:33:29] when we close if you could close in
[1:33:31] prayer
[1:33:33] but we're going to baptize someone
[1:33:34] tonight
[1:33:36] and it's when you feel the desire to be
[1:33:39] baptized you better get baptized
[1:33:43] because we don't know what's what lays
[1:33:45] in front of us
[1:33:47] but we do know that when God makes that
[1:33:49] call if you don't answer that call might
[1:33:51] not come again
[1:33:52] so there's a young man
[1:33:54] back there the Jeremiah that's going to
[1:33:57] be baptized tonight
[1:33:58] [Music]
[1:34:02] supper being ended
[1:34:06] the devil having now put into the heart
[1:34:08] of Judas is Carrot Simon's son to betray
[1:34:10] him
[1:34:12] Jesus knowing that the father had given
[1:34:14] all things into his hand
[1:34:16] and that he was come from God and went
[1:34:18] to God one of those things that God gave
[1:34:22] into Jesus's hand
[1:34:24] was this boy that's going to be baptized
[1:34:27] tonight
[1:34:30] trophy of God's grace
[1:34:34] [Music]
[1:34:35] he rises from supper
[1:34:37] and laid aside his garments
[1:34:39] and took a towel and girded himself
[1:34:42] and after that he poured water into a
[1:34:44] basin
[1:34:45] and began to wash the disciples feet and
[1:34:48] to wipe them with a towel wherewith he
[1:34:50] was girded
[1:34:51] then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter
[1:34:54] saith unto him Lord Dost thou wash my
[1:34:57] feet
[1:34:58] and Jesus answered and said unto him
[1:35:00] what I do thou knowest not but what thou
[1:35:04] sh but Thou shalt know hereafter
[1:35:07] Peter saith unto him Thou shalt never
[1:35:10] wash my feet
[1:35:12] Jesus Jesus answered him if I wash thee
[1:35:15] not thou has no part with me
[1:35:18] so Simon Peter said unto him Lord not my
[1:35:22] feet only
[1:35:23] but also my hands and my head
[1:35:26] Jesus saith unto him he that is washed
[1:35:29] needeth not to be not be not say he that
[1:35:32] is washed needeth not saved to wash his
[1:35:36] feet but is clean every wit and year
[1:35:39] clean but not all
[1:35:43] for he knew who should betray him
[1:35:46] therefore said he ye are not all clean
[1:35:50] so after he had washed their feet and
[1:35:53] had taken his garments and was set down
[1:35:55] again he saith unto them know ye what I
[1:35:59] have done done to you
[1:36:01] you call me master and Lord and you say
[1:36:04] well for so I am
[1:36:07] if I then your Lord and Master have
[1:36:09] washed your feet
[1:36:11] he also to wash one another's feet
[1:36:14] for I have given you an example and
[1:36:16] Jesus was a great
[1:36:18] example
[1:36:21] it's an understatement
[1:36:23] for I have given you an example that ye
[1:36:25] should do as I have done to you
[1:36:28] verily verily I say unto you the servant
[1:36:30] is not greater than his Lord neither he
[1:36:33] that is sent greater than he that sent
[1:36:36] him if ye know these things happy are ye
[1:36:40] if you do them
[1:36:41] amen so we would be dismissing after the

[1:43:58] Jeremiah Brother Andy Andre a good
[1:44:02] friend
[1:44:03] a brother that loves the Lord
[1:44:06] my brother Jeremiah
[1:44:08] he felt the spirit I believe the Lord
[1:44:11] moving he says I want
[1:44:14] to take
[1:44:16] that communion
[1:44:18] but he says I haven't been baptized
[1:44:21] and the little guy felt that I'm going
[1:44:24] to get baptized
[1:44:26] so he comes here I was talking with him
[1:44:29] just now that when we baptize
[1:44:32] according to Acts chapter 2 the Apostle
[1:44:34] Peter he said repent every one of you
[1:44:37] and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:44:40] Christ for the remission of your sins
[1:44:44] so we take this step to be baptized so
[1:44:47] that our sins will be washed away
[1:44:49] baptism doesn't wash Away The Sins the
[1:44:51] blood of Jesus Christ watches those sins
[1:44:53] away but this is a step that we take to

[1:44:57] make a commitment to the Lord Lord I
