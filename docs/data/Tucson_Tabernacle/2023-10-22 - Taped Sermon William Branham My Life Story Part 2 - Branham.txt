[Applause] midst let's stand this evening we turn the service over to brother Aaron to do the prayer requ ests and introduce the second portion of the sermon tonight I'm going to have him reread the prayer request from the linards for Brother David from this morning I rushed through that prayer request and didn't do it justice so forgive me for that but we'll have them read that as well as some other prayer requests let's just sing the song Jesus Jesus Jesus oh Jesus Jesus Jes Jus there's just something about that name Master Savior Jesus like a fragrance after the rain oh Jesus Jesus Jesus let all Heaven and Earth [Music] Proclaim Kings and kingdoms will all pass away but there's something about that name yes Jesus Jesus my Jesus there's just something about that name Jesus like the fragrance After the Rain Jesus Jesus [Music] Jesus let all Heaven and Earth Proclaim King and kingdoms shall all pass away but there's something about that you may be seated for a moment here just keep playing that you know it's when you you create an atmosphere and he comes down and he's not obligated to us in that sense but he loves us and you make him welcome he comes you know sure we've all experienced somebody somewhere someplace that you kind of just stand there and you know that they're just not making you welcome they're being nice because they have to be but if in your heart you just make an atmosphere that he says you know they want me close they're calling on me he'll come because he keeps his word so we do have a couple of requests and that are written here and this morning the update on Brother David linhard and we'll read the from the linhard family many have been asking me how he's doing he had a setback about 3 weeks ago with a staff infection in his original incision this led to new pain pain meds necessary and dialysis for the kidneys he had been seriously Delirious during this time [Music] last evening he suddenly came out of it talking normally and very hungry we appreciate all the prayers and concerns and believe God for totally hating for that's from the linart [Applause] [Music] [Applause] family sometimes things look really hard and impossible and sometimes he seem like he'll delay his coming you think about Lazarus he's asleep he told his disciples and disciples said he's doing well he's resting he said no he's he's gone on to the other side but let's wait a little while you know Lord we want you here now but God has reasons why and how he does things didn't make a difference to him Lazarus had been in the grave three days but it was no different God said Lazareth come for us and Lazareth came out he seal Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever so those of you that have been here for a while remember Brother David Nash down from the Washington area um he's still up there and I have his phone number on my phone and I scan past it a few times looking for another number and today I said I'm going to call him he answered the phone and he said brother Aaron he goes wow he said it's been a while hasn't I said yes he said well I appreciate you calling me and we got to talking a little bit and him sharing his just what the Lord has done with them and still doing a lot of missionary work and I remember the testimony he gave about when he was in I don't remember which country it was in but he went they took him to a hospital that everybody had heart problems serious serious heart problems and there was a a young lady or lady laying there on the ground when he walked by and he began to pray for them and every single patient in that portion of the Heart Hospital walked out of there well and when he came back there was one standing at the door and she looked at him he says do you remember me he says no I was that one laying down on the ground there look at me today [Applause] okay he told me today he said when I went back when I've gone back they told me I'm welcome in any one of their hospitals because I serve a living God so sometimes we we read a request and some but our God answers in his right time and but he did ask me to remember his wife sister Deborah Nash um she has a in intestinal infection that may require surgery so he was requesting prayer how sometimes it's harder for us to believe for ourselves than it is but but God is more than able so we'll remember that sister Melia she says thank you for your prayers for my daughter Lisa is back home and doing well she was the one that was went up to Colorado for the the blood transfusion or or bleeding there and then Eva who's here with her today is going to take medication for high blood pressure she has another appointment coming up so we can believe for that also and then sister hope for brother Amos Miller and family his wife sis Arie went to be with the Lord this morning and left small children behind they were the part of the the Fisher and H stus family which was that family that would come the Amish family would come for harmony it's that family so we do remember them in prayer and and if you have a need we we'll stay SE if you have a need and you say lord it's it's been a while it's been some time but I'll still believe you so if we just bow our heads Lord sometimes we just we get impatient we we get frustrated we say Lord are you even hearing but you did tell us to knock and the door will you said to to ask Lord you didn't say just once you just said to so Lord we're believing we're taking you at your word and and not only are we taking you at your word but we're going to begin to give you praise and thanksgiving for what you've done for us Lord every need supplied Lord when you cried out it it is finished it was finished Lord so we thank you for that today Lord and every hand raised every heart every request written and even those that were not mentioned Lord we commit un you now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Amen brother Daniel sent me a text here said I'm on streaming he said greet the congregation for me show you guys all remember brother Daniel if he's watching wave clap so yeah we we appreciate him and all he's done so and this this morning the brother was here uh for a couple of services he was with brother Dave Fritz and and them brother uh he was a pastor brother Steven I think it's bani Bima from from the Assembly of the Saints Tabernacle in Uganda and he had hoped to be able to greet the congregation and I told him this evening but he had to leave so he said just tell him I said hello you probably saw him here but he had to head home so you know it's a privilege for them to come here this place is well known and all that the Tabernacle and and sometimes we take it for granted but for many others it it is a privilege and a blessing so so this evening we'll listen to the second half and in the in there's parts of here where brother Brandon you his heartbreaks but you know he's on the other side now and I heard a statement or read it maybe there's more of them on that side now and my dad was telling me the other day we were talking and he said I began to count those that when we first came to Tucson that I knew that were my age maybe a little younger but there's over 250 that have gone on to be with the Lord and I I read the statement maybe there's more on that side and their pull is getting to be a little stronger now and maybe we're just that much closer to going home so so as as as we sing only believe if you'll stand remember the angel of the Lord was pleased with that song only believe he said if you can get the people to believe nothing will be impossible but Lord I've had this for 50 years I've had this whatever it is he's still God so we'll we'll just sing then only be only be all things are are possible only believe only be only all things are [Music] possible only believe and Lord I believe Lord I believe all things are possible Lord I believe Lord I believe Lord I believe all things are possible Lord God bless you so when we got married we didn't have nothing nothing go housekeeping I think had2 or3 do so we rented a house it cost us $4 a month it was a little old two room place and someone give us an old folding bed I wonder if anybody ever seen an old folding bed and they gave us that and I went out to Sears and robu and got a little uh table with four chairs and it uh it wasn't painted you know and we got that on time and so then I went over to Mr Weber a junk dealer and bought a cooking stove I paid 75 cents for it and a dollar and something for grates to go in it we set up housekeeping I remember taking a painting a shamrock on the chairs when I paint him and oh we were happy we had one another so that's all necessary God by his mercy and his goodness was the happiest Little Couple could be on the earth I found this that happiness does not consist of how much of the world's good you own but how contented you are with a portion of led to you and after a while God came down and blessed our little home we had a little boy his name is Billy Paul it's in the service right now here and uh a little later from that about 11 months he blessed us again with a little girl called Sharon Rose taken from the word of the Rose of Sharon and I remember one day I I had saved up my money and I was going to take a little vacation going up to a place POA Lake to fish and on my road back and during this time I'm leaving out my conversion I was converted and was ordained by Dr Roy Davis in the Missionary Baptist Church and had become a minister and have the Tabernacle that I now preach in in Jeffersonville and um I was pastoring the little church and I no money I pastored the church 177 years and never got one penny I didn't believe in take there wasn't even an offering plate in it and what tithings I had from work and so forth had a little box on the back of the building said little sign on it in so much as you have done the least of these my little ones you have did it unto me and then that's how the church was paid for we had 10 years a loan to pay it and was paid off less than two years and I never took an offering of no kind and then I had a few dollars I saved up for my vacation she worked too at fine shirt factory a lovely darling girl and her grave is probably snowy today but she's still in my heart and I remember when she worked so hard to help me to have enough money to go up to this Lake to fish and when I was coming back from the lake I began to see coming into mishala South B Indiana and I be to notice cars that had signs on the back said Jesus only and I thought that sounds strange Jesus only and I began noticing those signs in his own anywhere from bicycles Fords Cadillacs and what more Jesus only and I followed some of them down and to come to a great big church and I found out they were Pentecostal I'd hurt of Pentecostal but they were a bunch of Holy Rollers they laid on the floor and froed their mouth and everything that they told me about so I didn't want nothing to do with it so I heard him all carrying on in there and I thought believe I'll just walk in so I stopped old forward and walked in and all the singing you ever heard in your life and I come to find out there were two great churches one of them called the PA of JC and the PA of w many of you people might remember those old ARG I think they're United call now I called the United Pentecostal Church well I listen to some of their teachers they were standing there oh they were teaching about Jesus and how great he was and how great the everything was and about a baptism of the Holy Ghost I thought what are they talking about and after a while somebody jumped up and started speaking with tongues well I never heard anything like that in my life and here comes some woman up through there running just as as hard as she could then all of them got up and started running and I thought well brother they sure ain't got no church manners screaming and shouting and carrying on I thought what a bunch this is but you know something about it longer I sit there the better I liked it there was something seemed to be real good and I began to watch him and it went on I thought I'll just bear with him a while because I I'm close the door if anything starts this rational I'll run out the door I know where my car Park just around the corner and I begin to hear some of them preachers as Scholars and students I thought that's fine so it comes supper time and said everybody come to supper but I thought wait a minute I got $1.75 to go home and I that's all I had for gasoline money just taking that to take me home I had my old Ford it was a pretty good old Ford it wasn't backslid it's just like this one out here just wore out and it I actually believe that Ford would go 30 m an hour but of course that was 15 this way and 15 this way you see put it together you had 30 and so it um I thought well that night I think I would go out and after the I was stay for the night's service and all he said all of the preachers regardless of denomination come to the platform well there's about 200 of us that there I went up and so he said now we haven't got time for y'all to preach he said just walk by and say who you are and where you from well it come my time I said William Brandon Baptist Jeffersonville Indiana walk by I hear all the rest of them calling themselves Pentecostal Pentecostal Pentecostal PFW PC PW I walked by I thought well I guess I'm the ugly duckling so I sat down waited that day that had fine young preachers out there and they preached powerfully and then they said the ones go to bring the message tonight is I believe they called them Elder and the ministers instead of Reverend it was Elder they brought an old colored man out there he had one these oldfashioned preachers coats I don't guess you ever seen one long pigeon tail in the back you know with a velvet collar and he had just a little white rim of hair around his head poor old fell cannot like this you know he stood there and he turned around and where all the preachers have been preaching about Jesus and the great how great he was and so forth that old man took his text from over in job where was you when I laid the foundation of the world or when the morning Stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for Joy the poor old fell I thought why didn't they put some of them young fellas up there to preach great the place is packed in jam and I thought why didn't they do that so then uh this old fell instead of preaching what was going on down here on Earth he begin to preach what was going on in the heaven all the time well he tuck him up at the beginning at the beginning of time and brought him back in the second coming down the horizontal rainbow I never heard such preaching in my life about that time the spirit hit him he jumped about that high and clicked his heels together throw his shoulders back went tipping off that plat for said you haven't got room enough up here for me to preach and he had more room than I got here I thought if that'll make an old man act like that what would he do if he got on me I don't know maybe I need some of that why he come out there I felt so sorry for the old fell but when he left I was feeling sorry for myself and I looked at him go off there I went out that night and I thought now the next morning I'm not go to let nobody know where who I am so I went that night I pressed my trousers I took the when I out in the cornfield to sleep I went out and bought me some stale rolls you I've bought a whole bunch of them for a nickel there's a hydrant down there I got some water so I know that would last me a little while so I got me some water and drank it and went and eat my rolls and come back got another drink of water went out in the cornfield took the two seats and laid my little sear sucker trousers in there pressed them on the seat and that night I prayed prer all night I said Lord what is this I got into I never seen such religious people in my life and I said help me to know what this is all about and the next morning I got down there invited us for breakfast of course I wouldn't come eat with him because I had nothing to put in the offering and I just went back and the next morning when I went in my I eat some of my rolls and sat down and there's got on a microphone and i' never seen a microphone before and I was scared of that thing so they and had a little string hanging up here and hanging down one them drop mics like and he said last night on the

said they're not holy rollers are they I said I don't know what kind of rollers they are but they got something that I needed see I said that that's one thing I'm sure I said I've seen an old man 90 years old come young again I said I never heard such preaching in my life why I never seen a Baptist preach like that I said they preach till they get out of breath and bend their knees Plumb to the floor and come back up catch your breath you can hear them two blocks away still preaching and I said I I never heard such in my life I said they speak in an unknown tongue and the other one tells what they're talking about never heard such in my life I said would you go with me she said honey when I married you I will stick with you until death shall separate us she she said I'll go she said we'll tell the folks and I said you tell your mama and I'll tell my mama so we I went and told Mama mama said well sure Billy whatever the Lord's called you to do go do and so miss brumbach asked for me to come up well she said what's this you're talking about I said oh miss brumbach I said you all ever seen such people she said Qui and down Qui and down I said yes ma'am I said I'm sorry and and uh she said do you know that's a bunch of Holy Rollers I said no ma'am I didn't know that I said they they sure are fine people she said the very idea do you think you'd drag my daughter out among stuff like that said ridiculous that's nothing but trash that the other churches are throw it out she said indeed you'll not drink my daughter out like that I said but you know Miss BR back down in my heart I feel that the Lord wants me to go with them people she said you go back up to your church until they're able to afford a parsonage for you and act like a man's got some sense said you're not taking my daughter out through there I said yes ma'am I turned around walked out and hope started crying she come out she said Billy regardless of what mama says I'll stay with you bless her heart and I said oh that's all right honey I just let it go she wouldn't let her daughter go with such people as that because it wasn't nothing but trash and so I just kind of Let It Go as a worst m mistake I ever made in my life one of the worst a little later few years after the children come and one day we was there come up a flood in 1937 there came a flood and our I was on patrol at that time and I was trying my best to bring the people out of the flood houses tearing down and my own wife took sick and she was real real sick with pneumonia and they tuck her out the regular hospital so full we couldn't put her in there so we taken her out to the government where they had a room out there and so then they called me back out and I always lived on the river and quite a Boatman so I was trying to get the people rescue him from the flood and then I one they called me said there's a house over on chestn Street's about ready to go in there's a mother and a bunch of children in there I said if you think your boat your motor can get into them I said well I'll do all I can and I shooting waves of D could broke up there and oh my the just washing the city out and I would give it all the juice that I could and finally down across the alleys and through the places and I got there close to where the old Levy was the water pouring through and I heard someone screaming I seen a mother stand out on the porch there's that big rollers going through like that well I went on up this way as far as I could and hit the stream and come back and got on that side I've got my boat stopped just in time to tie it around the pillar of the post of the door post their porch post and I run in and grab the mother and got her in there two or three of the children and I Unum my boat and got her to back come out way down below and got her over to the shore about a mile and a half across the city I got her to the shore and now when I got over there She fainted and she begin she screaming my baby my baby well I thought that she meant she left the baby in the house oo my I tuck back again while they trying to take care of her and I come to find out it was she was won't know where her baby was there there was a little fellow about 3 years old and I thought she meant a little nursing baby or something and so I took back and got over there and when I got that boat and got on the inside and couldn't find old baby and a porch give away and the house went in and I run real quick and grabbed the the piece there it was floating my boat got into the boat and pull that and Loos it up and the done got
