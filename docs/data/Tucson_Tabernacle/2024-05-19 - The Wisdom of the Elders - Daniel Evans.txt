to call on sister Olivia and sister Jessica just later on in the service just wanted to let you know I think if anyone who's uh lived any amount of life if you ask them anything they could say through it all any Christian would say through all the good and the bad I've just learned to trust in Jesus we're going to hear about some of that tonight I'm really excited I got my listening cap on so let's sing this song I've had many tears and Sorrows I've had many tears and Sorrows I've had questions for tomorrow there been times I didn't know right from wrong but in every situation God God gave blessed consolation that my Trials come to only make me strong and through it all well through it all I've learned to trust in Jesus I've learned to trust in God through it all through it all I've learned to depend upon his word let's take it up a little bit I've been to lots of places and I've seen a lot of faces there have been times I felt so all along but in my lonely hours yes those precious lonely hours Jesus leted me know I was his very own that's the reason I sing through it all oh through it all I've learned to trust in Jesus I've learned to trust in God through it all through it all I've learned to depend upon I thank God for the mountains so I thank God for the mountains and I thank him for the valleys and I thank him for the storms he's brought me through for if I never had a problem I wouldn't know he could solve them I never know what faith in his word could do oh oh so I sing through it all oh yes through it all I've learned to trust in Jesus I've learned to trust in God through it all oh yes oh yes through it all I've learned to depend upon his word through it all yes through it all well through it all I've learned to trust in Jesus I've learned to trust in God through it all well through it all I've learned to depend upon I've learned to depend upon his word I've learned to depend upon his word yes I've learned to depend upon his word amen that word will never fail let's all stand as as we open our service in a scripture and let's turn to book to the Book of Job chapter 12 I'm chapter chapter 12 and verse 12 it says this with the ancient is wisdom and in the length of days understanding with him is wisdom and strength he that hath counsel and understanding the book is saying from this brother that of course that there is wisdom in years before we pray um got a message from brother Ron glidewell he says I'm in Lima Ohio this week and I ask for continued traveling mercies he's visiting family let's bow our heads Heavenly Father we pray first Lord for this request from our dear friend and brother brother Ron that you would guide them and protect them as they travel father may they draw closer to you on their on the road or on the flight or however they're traveling and father may they be a blessing wherever they are and Lord I pray that your comforting hand would be upon them and that you would speak to them on this journey that they're on and father in our service tonight we pray that you would be here with us that you would give wisdom father and some of these questions and some of these answers and Lord that you would be glorified in all of these things in Jesus name we pray amen you can take your seats okay thank you as I as I read in the Book of Job there is wisdom in Years brother brandham when he talked about Elders in the church brother brandham made it very plain that that Elders in the church are those that are older those that have more experience and we look to the elders in our church for those experiences that they might counsel the younger my dad used to always tell me I'd always tell my Dad how to do things and I was always wrong like a 100% of the time and he he'd always and every time I was wrong which was very often he'd always say bud you know how many years it takes to get 50 years experience and I said yeah you've told me this before pop and he'd say 50 years actually he'd say well it's about 50 years and that's when we go through life we get experiences that we simply don't have without years on us I know in in um the Book of Joshua it says that that um that the the elders in Israel I'm I'm sorry it's in judges that the people of Israel served God as long as Joshua was there and as long as those were with Joshua was there so we see that there is a change there was something in these Elders that they had an understanding they had a reverence for God that after that generation passed that that reverence as we see it just kind of faded away and I look at some of the elders that I've had the honor of knowing that were close with brother brandham all the brandham family brother Billy Paul especially my dad my grandfathers both of them brother sofman brother Hickerson brother Collins um brother Roberson brother um um Jim Maguire all of these brothers who I was very very close with there was something about them that was different and I know my wife always says she says you know someone that was around brother brandom they have a different look in their eyes and I really believe that that is because they came into contact with someone who was truly filled with the Holy Spirit someone that had that love that is portrayed and that when you meet someone that has that love it really changes your life because you see that this person really cares about me this person they're not there to promote themselves they're there be they're there they care about what I say and as I talked about when we were going through the Book of Job when we're counseling each other Sometimes the best counsel not sometimes I'd say most of the time the best counsel is just to listen just to listen and to love and then God will have his way in the situation and you'll build the trust of that person and with all Elders in the church I would encourage the elders to love the younger generation the ones that are coming in and to be there for them in any way that you can I talked about my mom last week on Mother's Day and she wasn't someone that was full of advice in fact she rarely corrected me she rarely rarely gave me advice in life but I think that she had the most impact of my life than anyone else in the world did because she loved me dearly and she set an example that was um was just beyond good so with our elders and I want to the way that I want to format this is you young people or um folks my age I grew my beard out so you could see how gray it is is so I think if you're older than me you're an elder and if you're younger than me you're a younger um but uh feel free to also ask questions if if a topic comes up and you want a little bit further explanation or you you want to know something else feel free to um to ask and and say I have this issue that I would like to know have you ever you have you ever experienced this um the first thing that I have written down and I also want um for the elders if if you just have something to say I want you I want to make sure that say it um that if you have some advice to give all of us I want you to give it um my first question and uh brother Jordan I'm going to turn on microphone one here I always say brother Jordan it's because I can't see the people usually behind the screen but I'll turn on microphone one and one of the big problems and sister Shirley I'm gonna ask you this question I'd like you to give an answer um yeah one of the problems that I think all of us have is when I get down on my knees to pray feel like there's so many voices going on in my head there's so many things that I'm thinking about and I'll get down and my mind will go this way and my mind will go that way so then I'll go up in the mountains and and I'll try to get quiet before the Lord to try to cut out all of the voices in in my head and it's so hard sister Shirley it's it's it's very difficult to get those voices and really get quiet before the Lord and I know that you're a prayer Warrior I know that you go before the Lord on behalf of many of us and I just like to ask you how do you quiet those voices When you pray I just praise him more when I get down and there's I'm not I'm hearing everything else to drown it out I just praise him that's scripture I Just Praise Him and then his presence comes near and then when his presence comes is that you go on yes sister Shirley um brother Lyle brother Ed and brother Arie can you come up here in the front um because I'd like also brother Jordan can handle the back um if you all could come up in the front brother brandom said one time he said when you go before the Lord in prayer he said you approach the Lord just like sister Shirley was saying and what you said is exactly scripture I believe it's in Isaiah that you go before the Lord you say holy holy unto the Lord holy holy unto the Lord and he starts to get closer and you're worship him and you're saying holy holy unto the Lord Lord of God Almighty holy holy unto the Lord and then you start to enter into his presence holy holy unto the Lord and then when you enter into his presence you say on behalf of my brother or on behalf of my sister anyone else on this question how do you get quiet before the Lord brother Jeremy sister surely said that God inhabits the Praises of his people that's the scripture promise and so you take that word and you put it in your mouth and you keep it before the Lord because God is his word and he loves loves to Fellowship around people that love his word and the second thought I had that I asked for Mike um what did you just say the scripture says serving others is looking heaven in the face and so when I pray I start praying for others and all those other thoughts become dim and as I bring bring your names before the Lord or just have someone my i i attended a meeting one time and I I cried I just cried for 45 minutes and all I could say was their name and then then the burden lifted and you know I trust the Lord heard heard whatever he had intended for me to kneel for oh my um one of the questions that I had on on my heart all of us and brother Lionel sister Lonnie I'm gonna I'm gonna maybe have you answer this first and then I think there's others that can answer this also when there's adversity in your life when you come into hard times and and it feels like you don't know what to do and it feels like maybe All Is Lost how what what do you do there's there's I know that you all have have overcome quite a bit of adversity in your life how do you do it where do you start I believe for me myself is that when that ad adversary it comes into my life the first thing that I think is he knows he knows exactly what it is before I even speak anything of my mouth of myself he knows what it is and many times when I've been in a situation like that I see that all that needs to happen is for me to just step up and just hold him at his word of what he promised me and when I hold him at his word and and I realize that if we stand there and we have 100% faith in our hearts then he is just to honor the word that that we believe um I had uh one of my sons was dying one day in the hospital and um it was to the point where these people that are in the medical profession profession they know that when the code team comes to the hospital room and they gather around the room that means that uh the patient is getting ready to do what they call Circle the Drain he's the patient's starting to dip out it's just going to be maybe minutes you know his heart rate is getting closer and closer everything's everything's sinking and my boy was just in his 20s there was no reason for him to be in in the condition that he was in he he was he was a firefighter and he fell sick nobody knew why he fell sick he was a healthy boy his entire life never had no medical condition and now he's in the hospital fighting for his life just just from fallowing what seemed like a fever and he got to the each day me and his mother would be at the hospital and the doctor would say you know we don't know whether he's going to make it overnight so stay close to your phone if you go home and we would we would peel out of the hospital at about maybe I think maybe 1:00 in the morning and then go back to the hospital at about maybe 4 or 5:00 in the morning and just sneak home and get a couple hours asleep and uh I got to hand it to the doctors for being honest with us when you go home stay close to the phone because he might not make it till the morning and we'd go home and we're tired cuz we've been up all day you know and it's just knowing in your heart that I know 100% that God is mindful of this situation he knows what's going on and I know he's not going to leave us here there's no reason this boy is too young and then uh after dealing with this for about a week you know my boy's lost a lot of weight he's he's uh in a hospital induced coma at this point he's innovated um he's on the uh on the ventilator I mean everything possibly happens happens he has blood clots everywhere he got chest tubes in the side of him every morning we went there you know it was worse and worse news you know his he's now has it it progressed to a heart condition like everything was just just completely against us and then one day I was I snuck out of his room and I'm sitting in the courtyard of the hospital in Lonnie's inside the the room and she uh calls me on the phone she says you got to get in here right now you know me and her are both in firefighters in the medical profession so to speak she says Hey the code came the code team just gathered at the door she goes you got to get in here now I said what are you talking about she go yeah they just came to the door they got the crash cart they got everything ready to go what do you mean go for what she goes listen the code team is at the door so I got up and I walked in and there was two chairs next to the bed and when I walked up to the uh to the door of the hos of his hospital room I seen first thing I seen coming down the hallway was that team and they were all putting their gloves on the rubber gloves and they were all getting their stuff and when I walked up they knew that I was a father none of them could look at me in the fa they all when I walked by they all kind of put their heads down and they wouldn't look at me so I said okay this is this is bad and I walked in and I seen Lonnie and she's sitting next to the bed and I walk up and I said hey you know what what do you mean the I said I see the co team's out there well she goes yeah she goes he's he's dipping she goes look at his heart rate look up at the monitor his heart rate stolic diastolic is coming together he's getting ready to do what they call some people know it as Flatline he's getting ready and I said no he's not she says what do you mean I said ' listen I said we would worship a mighty God I said there's no reason that he should have even been here I said we don't know what this is but I believe that if we take God at his word even though we're looking right now at death comeing on this boy right now it does not matter and she grabbed my hand and she says L know she goes we're in this business he's getting ready to die she goes and we're sitting right here next to the bed like if we're in the front seat watching this thing getting ready to unfold in front of us and they had respect for us enough cuz you know we certified a little bit so they let us stay there you know usually they'll ask the family members to leave the room they let us stay there she says we're about to witness this right in front of us right now and I seen them all gathering around you know coming closer to his bed just waiting waiting on the monitors to show and then I turned to her and it's real strange I didn't even call her my wife orani I said woman I turned to her look right right in the face said woman where is your faith and that was it as the code team was looking at the monitors went into prayer I said father do not let this boy died do not even let him live give him a chance that he knows you that's what I want I want I want him to know you give him a chance to come out of this that he could know you started praying praying for him and I could for some reason some way I could Envision the way almost like a movie when a when the camera in the movie pans over the ocean and it drops down to the level of the ocean it starts going over the ocean I seen I seen him from his foot feet all the way to his head like I was paning over his body like it was the ocean all the way to his head and as I was praying all of a sudden I felt I felt a connection between me and him and and and up above was like a strike of lightning like a connection somehow there was a connection between me him and God just like that like a lightning strike and when that connection came on that nurse that was looking at the monitor with the code team right there she looked up and said these exact words she looked at that monitor and she says oh oh oh wow wow and she literally jumped about 3 ft away from the monitor she goes wow and then she came up looked at the monitor she went behind it looked at all the cords made sure the cords were still connected and then she said these words okay she goes okay okay then she turned to the Cod team went up and talked to him and the greatest thing that I've ever seen in my life was the code team taking off their gloves and their gowns and masks and throwing them in the bin and rolling that crash card away from that room but see that day I I took God at his word that's what it was he was mindful of the situation he know the situation but God wants somebody to stand on this Earth and appreciate the words that he gave to them and he wants them to stand and take him at his at his word and stand strong on that word that's the way the King David did when he was a was he was a young Shepherd boy no nobody else went out to face that Philistine Goliath King David did cuz he stood up and said hey is somebody going to take God at his word they going to let this Blasphemous Philistine talk about the armies of the Living God or is somebody going to step up and take God at his word see and that's the way that in my life when it's adversary like that I've realized um you know there's people that get involved in many things you know in situations like that they'll go and they'll go had a candle somewhere they'll go to a somewhere to some uh maybe to a cathedral or a church or a sanctuary they'll do that but for me I've always had to go somewhere and and just take God at his word just 100% at his word and then just go and stand on that word and speak the word and then that's when you'll see that thing like lightning within an instant just change everything around that boy came out of it when he came out of it he went in that hospital hospit about 220 lbs came out at about 130 first thing we did is went and found some water and this was based on his request he wanted to be [Applause] baptized amen you know we come to church we hear a sermon we worship we pray and when times like that hit us that is the time to call upon the name of the Lord and we can say where is your faith and I can say to myself where is my faith brother Ed want you to come up and um I know that you've gone through adversity you you were um injured as a young man and and you've had to overcome quite a bit so brother Ed if you could tell us how you overcame these things that you overcome now you're putting me on the spot you want me to okay I can see you overcome in my whole life um I was inj injured playing football at a rather young age and because of that I've gone through a great deal in my life uh physically but also at the same time um it left some extremely deep scars within and I just um lived life you know I was rejected uh I was made fun of because mentality then was totally different as it is for someone with with a handicap but that wasn't so much uh because be because of that I really felt that God had his hand on me and uh who knows where I would have been had I not gone through that in my life but part of the one of the hardest things was I'll go back um 2005 our son was getting ready to deploy go to war and he was activated told to stand down reactivate told to stand down this went on through probably six seven months of 2005 and I was I was talking to a brother who used to come here to the church and I was pouring my heart out to the brother and I got to talking you I sort of felt it was unfair I mean you know it was stressful uh knowing that just your loved one's going to go to war um but as I was talking to this brother you know I'm naturally I'm a dad I I just want to protect my children and I was taught expressing these desires and then I realized that if I as a natural father want to protect my children how much more does our heavenly father want to do something and I had the weight of the whole world as I was talking and as I mentioned that the Lord would do even more so the whole weight just lifted I was in my truck and that's where I spend a lot of my time is in my truck driving that's where I have my quiet time I I get in my truck I commit my day to the Lord and then I I don't even many times I don't even turn the radio on but I just start thinking about the Lord and inviting the Lord into into my truck and yes I I work 45 minutes from home but often the Lord the sweet presence of the Lord will just fill the fill the truck and I know that he's there and I'll start singing you know um a song Hallelujah is probably one of the favorite because when I when I sing that or hum that I feel the presence of the Lord come down and it's I'm trying to enter into an atmosphere of worship and that's why when we sing here at church the songs we sing whether it's brother Josiah or brother Aaron Or whoever may be leading songs it's a whole atmosphere that the presence of the Lord will come down and I'll sit there and I'll and I'll just lay my petitions before him and commit my day before him and usually you know no matter how hard the day is at the end of the day I go wow I got all this done and I'm sort of surprised because sometimes it's uh extremely stressful but not long ago you know my wife and I sorry we have gone through some of the darkest times in our life don't know why but it's not for me to question but as I was talking to this brother uh in ' 05 I realized it doesn't make a difference if my son came home in a body bag and that's hard to to say as a parent if my son comes home in a body bag God was in control it's okay God's in control so when we went through these situations here a few years ago it was the darkest time of our life I would have much rather had gone through what I went through as a kid than to go through what we went through and I won't go into details it does it does doesn't make a difference but God was so merciful to us and in The Darkest Hours I knew God was in control God was no matter what happened God was in control and every day God gave us a little nugget didn't give us a big plate of of blessings but he gave us a little nugget say it's okay I've got the situation under control it's going to be okay and that's what got us through when I was down sister Kathy was was strong most of the time she was the one having the hardest time and I was the stronger one but every day didn't make a difference it was coming to church seeing a brother getting a message hey how you doing or just listening to a a sermon from whoever God gave us a little nugget and it uh it got us through amen and because of that I can stand and I can rest assured that no matter what life throws at us it's okay God when you go through ADV adversity when you go through your tests when you go through your trials God is forming your character I heard a minister talk about a ship that they were on a cruise and they hit a massive storm and this massive cruise ship was tossed about and the lady called the captain and the C Captain didn't answer it was the first officer of the called back say you know it's okay this ship was built for this storm and I took that is that as we as we as Christians when we go through things and we you God doesn't always hit us with a massive uh trial he'll he'll let little things hit us and see how we react and then we grow and we become stronger and then a little later we get hit with something a little bigger and then we we learn from it and then we we go we keep growing and my hope and my my confidence is in the word of God he's never left us he's he's not left either one of you he won't leave you just keep your eyes focused on the cross am you know we sang the song brother Josiah had through it all but because of Christ because of his word no matter what we go through it's okay God's in control it doesn't make a difference if I die or if I live I'm a I'm a winner either way amen so keep pressing on because we're getting closer to going home and as we get closer it's going to be harder but God's faithful brother Ed I don't know if he was quoting it but the Apostle Paul was probably really down and he said for me to live live is Christ if I'm going to live I'm going to live for Christ and if I die it's my gain um I wanted to uh sister Olivia where is Olivia where'd she go are do you have a song okay why don't you make ready um so um yeah if if you can make ready right now I'd like to just give a little advice as as as a dad and as some of the time brother Ed said his quiet time was in his his truck I had a job when I was a young man in my early 20s that I was able to drive a lot and what I would do when I was driving is I always had a tape of brother Brandon playing and that time that I spent listening to those sermons what it did is it buil built a foundation in me not only spiritually and it did it mold of my character but it also gave me the knowledge of what brother brandham said so when someone comes against what he said or someone attacks him and and attacks his character I have listened to every single one of them from 1947 to 1965 I don't remember what's on all of them but I have listened to everyone and I can give an answer because I have that experience and I would encourage you young people don't waste time when you have some time listen to those sermons I promise you they'll do you good they'll build a foundation in you [Music] I don't want to hear anymore teach me to listen I don't want to see anymore give me a vision that you could move this heart to be set apart our I don't need to recognize the man in the mirror and I don't want to trade your plan for something familiar I can't waste a day and I can't stay the same I want to be different I want to be changed till all of me gone and All That Remains is the fire so bright that the whole world can see that there's something so come be different in me I don't want to spend my life stuck in a pattern and I don't want to gain this world but lose what matters so I'm giving up everything because I want to be I want to be Chang till all of me is gone and All That Remains is a fire so bright that the whole world can see that there's something different so come and be different I know that I am far from perfect but through you the cross still says I'm worth it so take this beating in my heart come and finish what you started when they see me let them see you cuz I just want to be different I want to be different I want to be changed till all the me is gone and All That Remains is a fire so bright that the whole world could see there's something different so come and be different I just want to be different so could you be different in [Music] me amen um I have a question now and uh this one sister Rachel I'm gonna ask maybe you and brother Aaron about this this next question you raised a large family you raised six daughters I know it was hard I I have two kids and it was really hard for us to make end meet financially how'd you do it you got through it I'm GNA both of you need to answer brother Aon you're closer so I'm goingon to have you answer then you have some time to think of your answer sister Rachel God always provides yes and if you don't compare yourself to others sometimes you got to be careful with that how come they have this and how come they don't I've shared this testimony with you before how When We Were Young we always wanted to go to our friend's house because they had a TV and we wanted to see cartoons and they always wanted to be at our house and one day I convinced him that we could go to their house house and right about the time that we sat down to watch the cartoons a little brother come running out said get out of here get out of here let's get out of here let's run and so my friend begins to run so we ran too and I said Mom and Dad didn't get along well and they were always getting into fights and they would attack each other with whatever it was and that's why they wanted to be at our house and something that we did we may not have had the newest car and in fact the girls always remember the van that had a hole in the muffler and they would know we were coming home and then they would clean the house cuz Mom and Dad were almost home they heard you that far away yes until we got it fixed but but God always provided um and and we may do with what we had and God never missed you know having the family with you though you know if if if we hadn't had my parents and her parents life would have been different but I'll say this about her uh the S tell as you know my wife's family and some of the older families there my mother-in-law died young from cancer and her being the eldest of the girls she became a mom to her younger sisters so by the time we got married she had a lot more experience in raising children so she raised this one too and she knew how to make things work and it's I mentioned this to you the other day about my daughter Sarah and we did something with the children and if they did misbehave in church we told them when they got home they would pay the price so we told him if you um if when we get home you're going to get a spanking it just seems like spanking solved everything or we thought and if you take the spanking then you get to have some kind of of of treat if you chose not to get the spanking you had to go to directly to bed and Sarah doesn't let me forget this that I spanked her and then I made her go to bed and she still brings those things back and says daddy you didn't keep your word so I was driving home one day with her and I said say something tell me something that you appreciated about your mom and your dad and she stopped for a minute she looks at me that you were consistent if you said no mama said no if you said yes Mama Said Yes we knew we would get treated consistently and um my wife went through a real hard time and I don't know if she would share that or not but she was still Mama to them [Applause] my family it was don't ask Dad because it's always no maybe Mom can convince dad and no my kids didn't get a treat after they got a spanking I like that part I think Aaron pretty much covered it um I don't know my girls were mellow um they didn't give us a whole lot of problems um prayer we had um before the girls would go to school we would you know gather around and we'd pray and sometimes we'd give the neighbor kids little rights I mean rights to school so they would come and they would pray with us too and we always read the Bible you know together and I mean it just lots of hand-me-downs sometimes S I prayed over the soup because there was only one meatball and then this really happened um everybody got a meatball in their soup and I'm like the Lord multiplied it somehow um just it was the Lord honestly just and I did want to say about communication keep the communication with your daughters with your sons with each other open there's times one time one of my girls and I couldn't agree and she would say something and I misunderstood it and we were trying to understand each other we went in circles we were frustrated we got angry we but keep talking keep talking to one another don't you know and and whatever question your child comes to you with your daughters my daughters are grown um when they were little I would be like how dare you be thinking that you know and later I learned just listen if you don't understand it pray about it and just keep that communication open because they need to talk to somebody you know and if you don't talk to them and listen to them and you might think oh it's just such a little thing to them it's a big thing if it's on their heart and they're bringing it to you listen pray about it um talk to them about it you know so [Applause] that was loaded with wisdom to keep that communication open to pray over things you you see how the Holy Spirit was in the G home growing up and how he he provided and multiplied the food and it's blessing to me that what means the most to me is that you only had one meatball and which just still you still put your trust in the Lord um and he took care of us like he always does we we hear these hard times that these families have had but that's the times that we grow closer to the Lord so those hard times are actually blessings to us and I hope you young people are listening because you're going to go through hard times I promise you especially when your kids get to be teenagers they're um they lose their minds you did um I wanted to ask um sister baggot about so she was she was involved we we've heard um the rumors and the stories about the the Prescot trailer park and and how hard that was what a difficult situation that was Sister Roberto was 16 when she came out of that trailer park and that's a very difficult situation and you think about how many people here in going through what they went through how many people would have just left and said I'm sick of it I'm tired of it I'm going to live my life but this family you stayed with it you stayed with the message and sister Berta as a 16-year-old girl how did you make that decision that you're going to stay with this gospel that you had learned as a young girl um well I have to say it's God's grace I had marvelous grandparents marvelous parents I feel parents have been gone five or six years and two years but um God spoiled me was good family and um I know I'm always um admire people that serve God and they're the only ones serving God in their family because I had I had a tremendous amount of support let's put it that way um but I mean we all have to make our decision ourselves too and um brother brandham came to the camp several times he preached a couple of sermons there I was there from 3 years old to 16 that's where I was raised we were raised to serve one another to love one another um there was things that weren't right but I was only 16 and I don't know all the things there I just know that God loved us then and he loves us now and all I can say is that he kept us I my my daddy had a nervous breakdown when all of that happened that was very hard on me but then God gave me a husband that loved me and loved me unconditionally and I've always been very grateful because when I went right from my daddy to my husband because I was only 17 and um I just but I do know that when you get ser carry us with God I remember it and it's hard because you're told growing up that we're the bride of Christ but you're sort of kept in there that you're the only one we're the only ones and uh but yet I remember I was um my dad was sick and my I mean crazy sick and um and I remember getting down I don't know what it is with me and bathrooms but I have had a lot of prayers answered that I've prayed in a bathroom and I I'll never forget I was at my aunties and and um everything was crazy cuz everything was blowing up you're like everybody's leaving and we we did keep the love between us that's one thing I can say brother brandham said we had a love there that was a good thing and those people there it's been what I'm 65 and I was 16 so it's been lots of years ago and those people are [Music] still like family just absolutely could trust him with whatever and um anyway I just got down because I wasn't sure there was a God with all this going on things you thought was all fine and dandy was wasn't fine and dandy anymore and uh I just remembered getting down and it wasn't really like I was praying for something but I just I told God I said if you're there if you're if you're God and you're looking we need help you know I just really got down and cried and prayed God we need you right now and and he it it wasn't like it all got over in a day but we we made it and um and just totally by his grace my dad was sick for four years and um just over and over I mean my grand my grandmother you know she was the one that brother Brandon prayed for and she was healed and um just her life I now see that the things that brother Brown told her have been encouragement to the children and the grandchildren and um I don't know I just feel like um it's Grace Grace and Mercy uh nothing surely that I haven't have done for sure and just God has been very good to me very good to my family blessed this with the children and [Music] grandchildren and um I just feel like sometimes he's been a little bit too good to me but I just give him all the praise and honor because when you're going through things you you just have to sort of grab the boots and put them on and March and you don't really know what's around the next corner but then when you come through hindsight's always you can see the hand of God but when you're going through something you have to yeah and to trust God that that's that's to truly trust God that's I think a learned uh uh something you learn through life is to tr absolutely trust God because he's all you've got some times do amen sister an can I ask for some of our our young sisters and young brothers too I could ask my wife or um or you how do you how do you stay with it and coming through the years can I yeah I'm G to come back to sister an and I'm going to go over to my wife sweetheart as a young lady you always kept your testimony until you got married no I'm just kidding I'm kidding sweetheart how'd you do it what advice do you have for the young sisters I think that the thing I would probably say is that Jesus never under delivers and it is hard sometimes when you're walking through this life you feel alone and you you're put to the test sometimes just just being different and having moral standards that the world doesn't always have um and so sometimes you feel a little bit alone but there's something in you that that you just want to be right with God and that is him you know that's that part of him that's in you and it those decisions that you're made making are really him you know just being within you and and when you do the right thing and and you feel right and you're you're conscious is good with the Lord you you look back in your life and you realize that it was such a blessing to be different it was a blessing for all of the the you know being a little bit you know it kept me from trouble it kept me from being I don't want to say in the cool group but it kind of keeps people they have enough respect for you that they don't invite you to things and it keeps you out of trouble and I believe that when you just surrender to the Lord and you realize that he's really what I want the Lord he doesn't it's not like you're settling for anything he he gives you the best he gives you better than you could ever hope and you look back at your life and you think wow Lord you know just you know never under deliver she's been a blessing to me and uh I noce Stephanie she has she's always she always kept her testimony she walked with her head above all of the mess that was around us all and and I remember Sister Jessica you were you're kind of a a lot quite a bit younger not too much younger but quite younger and and Stephanie and um a couple a couple of the Gara girls you all were younger too but very few of our group really stayed with it and but there but the ones that did they are pillars for others and and they can say here here's how we did it here's how we overcame sister an okay no but there is there is an overcoming you know in each Church age it always addresses it it doesn't address IT addresses to the angel but it always mentions to him that overcomes and that's each of us that that we can overcome these adversities that we have is there anyone else as far as that subject who Hope's pointing at somebody sister Heather okay to me the answer to everything is the Lord Jesus I came to the message because I love the Lord Jesus everything is about him am and so I love him too and he's been kind he's always been there for me and his word is true and uh I just say whatever you're going through Jesus is your answer because he's been mine and he is mine amen that's wisdom and he's never will never stop being the answer he's a same yesterday and today and forever sister Jessica if you can make ready for your song um I we talked about a little bit about the trailer park and and all of us know brother John you and I we've kind of come through some things and we can give our hearts to the Lord and we can want to serve the Lord but sometimes it go goes in a direction that God doesn't want it to go you know what I'm talking about and and we we have a sincere heart but we may Veer from the truth into what the Bible calls fables or maybe into things that don't exactly line up with the word and then what happens is then we as I was preaching on this morning then we are are doing these things now for ourselves even though it's religion now it's a it's about ourselves and Jesus said he says they said well these people that you're hanging out with they're worldly they're their wine bibbers and their prostitutes and their tax collectors and and you're with all these people and we are with all of these holy people and Jesus said that I have desired um mercy and not sacrifice brother L how do we know maybe when we get off of the track and we get into something that maybe is not the Lord's will even though we are just as sincere as anywhere anyone else how do we get off and then how do we get back you may be standing there for a while I've been on both sides of that fence um and I pray that I'm on the correct side of the fence now um we uh I'm trying to think how to compress this from an hour to about five minutes and it's I'm not sure of the compression algorithm I don't have the advantage of AI to help me I guess um but we in California when I was a kid I was maybe 12 years old and uh my parents background we were we grew up in a Baptist Church until I was about five years old or six and then we moved into what's called a Congregational Church which is basically uh we like each other and and believe whatever you want just we're we're a church and by the way here's the offering plate um so it it was a church that really didn't stand for much of anything um but we went there because my oldest brother's friends went there in high school and my parents didn't want to split the family so that's where we went mom taught Sunday school etc etc anyway um we wound up then uh my mom worked at Sears which used to be a big company sort of like Walmart or Amazon today but it was called Sears back in those days and she got a new boss and that boss so was introducing himself to the department that he was running and at that little lunch meeting he mentioned something about the Holy Spirit and my mom came to him afterwards and said what what's this about this Holy Spirit what are you talking about and so uh he he witnessed to her and uh and that was brother Lonnie Jenkins many of you may have heard of him or know know him over the years and uh so uh time went by we went to a Lutheran Church uh that was uh practicing some of this Pentecostal experience if you will that was led by brother linhard who was an associate pastor here for many years um and uh there was a a group of us we got uh I'm trying to condense this to to get to your question sorry that it's taking so long that we were invited to leave the Lutheran Church and so we did and we we started meeting in a in a house several families left and and uh through their uh ties offerings whatever you wish to call it financial support uh so the larts were able to rent a uh an apartment and we met in that apartment and uh about about that time there was a a church in San Jose that's where this was taking place that was sold and uh and and about that time another fell came walking down the street and I don't know how he came across brother Lonnie and brother linhard but he said I've got tapes of a prophet you've got to here what's this what are you talking about um so uh they they wound up uh allowing the brother to play this tape for them because they wanted to screen it before the group would be exposed to this potential heresy it was something called choosing of a bride and uh and and and the brother had attended brother Doug McHugh's Church in San Jose which had just been sold and most of that church had moved to Tucson and and these people hadn't quite left yet the the Mayfields some of you may know them anyway uh so we got permission from the people that were um selling the church and the people that were buying the church while it went through escrow we could have use of that building it was about a two week period of time so we wound up starting with uh choosing of a bride and then we heard the church ages and the and the breach and God in Simplicity and the seals and we were meeting at least once every night a week and on Saturday and Sunday one of those days we met twice and one of those days we met three times I don't remember what it was but we really got um a good dose of uh of brother brandom's Ministry and then and then the Lord you know we didn't have use of that building anymore but then the Lord seemed to be moving through uh through the spirit through various prophecies and whatnot and uh and I don't know all the details because by this time I was 16 years old and this was 1966 and uh the short version is that most of that group then wound up moving to Tucson over a period of of of a few months um and so we had as a group we had uh come into the contact with the Holy Spirit we had had some of these prophecies the exposure to the message Led into the message came to Tucson we're attending Tucson Tabernacle um and and and everything it it everything just seemed to be right and right on the word and right and the spirit was good and all the rest of it and and we lived in a different trailer court it wasn't in presca it was over here on on Miracle Mile uh Beware of trailer cords um so we lived in close proximity to one another very close proximity and and uh and we wound up um having our own little uh meetings on Saturday uh and uh uh and and different prophecies would come different uh uh words from the Lord I'll put that in quotes carefully because in many cases I believe they were from the Lord uh I mean there were Miracles that were happening there were healings that were happening there were people that were coming to the Lord there it it was it was a marvelous time quite frankly but then uh uh over time and and during part of this time I was I was drafted I was in the army I was in the 101st Airborne Division the yomer war happened a lot of things were going on but during those years in the very early 70s uh some of the families that were living in the trailer court felt like the Lord was moving on them to move to Israel so they wound up going to Israel and and when I got out of the Army in 1974 Heather and I looked at each other and said well okay we're here in Kentucky we can go to Tucson but all our families move they don't live in Tucson anymore we could go to Israel wherever we go we can get a one-way ticket but we can't get a round trip so we wound up going to Israel and we wound up uh being very well connected with the group that was there well there were a lot of strange uh I don't know what to call them call them prophecies call them leadings call them people were believing that it was the Lord that was leading them in these things and and so the question is so how do you how do you know when things are drifting away from what's real in spite of the fact that you might say wow I've got the witness of the Holy Spirit of this or the Lord confirm that or there was this dream and there was this interpretation there were all of these things I I I think part of what a person needs to do in a case like that is is not only be very sure of where your anchor is is but but go to someone like your pastor and talk to them and not just the leader of your little group go outside of that little group to get some additional counsel some additional feedback some additional input uh and I'm not saying to override your pastor I'm not saying anything like that but understand that God is moving here in Tucson Tabernacle he is right now but God's also moving in other places and not only our sister message churches God is moving God is not limited to the message God he's not limited so so sometimes you have to reach out a little beyond that I'll I'll take a little side step here when I lived in in Washington for a number of years we had a little Friday morning group that uh we wound up uh we were meeting in restaurants for a while but who wants to meet in a restaurant so we came to Heather's restaurant and so every Friday morning there was a group of about six of us who would get together and we were all about 10 years apart so we had a wide range of people from 30 40 50 60 70 80 and various backgrounds I was the only guy that had any background in the message I think a couple the other guys may have had a little bit of a of a Pentecostal background but we had two Quakers and we had uh oh gosh I don't remember what some of the denominational names were but these were my brothers and and we had good Fellowship wonderful Fellowship around the word we had wonderful fellowship and and over time the barriers could come down and then we could be genuine we could be open we could be honest we could share we knew what was said in that room stayed in that room if I was having a problem with something I could ask these brothers to pray for me and they would but it wasn't just pray for me and forget about it it then becomes a oh well you know Lyall um three weeks ago you said you were having this problem how is that going accountability Beyond transparency and authenticity there must be accountability and if there's not accountability then the other kind of doesn't work so well so in this group when we were in Israel we were only accountable to ourselves and so we wound up I'll give you a couple of examples um did you know did you know that that the two witnesses were brother green and brother linhard that brother green was the one that would have the spirit of Elijah and that brother linhard would be the one the spirit of Moses did you know that we knew that we knew that did you know that when the king came that that King was named Joseph brandham we knew that we knew that did you know that no well of course you didn't know that because it's not true none of it's true but but we didn't know it wasn't true we thought it was so you get these Revelations you get these words and somebody opens a Bible and they point out to some obscure scripture about this or about that and and the next thing you know well well the Lord answered this prayer there there was this person that was healed there's these wonderful things happening we're we're building bridges to the Jewish people here in this Orthodox community and they're coming to us and they're bringing their children to be prayed for and they're being healed and there's all these wonderful things that are happening surely this is of the Lord but it wasn't it wasn't so I I would say that that you have to go beyond your little group if you're really tight with a few people you have to reach beyond that tight of a few people from time to time to get your balance to get to to be sure your Sails are set right and you're actually going on the right course that that the light you're seeing isn't a false light but it's it's the real light so so i' i' I've been there um uh I've I've found wonderful Christian Fellowship outside of the message I found wonderful Christian Fellowship inside the message God is Not restricted to our group God is Not restricted to just us God is so much bigger than that and um I don't know I should probably stop at this point God bless you brother that was good very good very very good advice um one thing brother Lyall was talking about he was talking about uh there would be signs that would come forward and maybe you open your Bible or or something happens the book of Jeremiah I believe it is the Lord is addressing these I don't know if they were false prophets I can't remember exactly um who they were but they were deceivers and he says and the dreams that you caused yourself to dream so we can actually make ourselves through self-will because we want something so bad we can actually make ourselves dream something or have a sign or see a sign brother uh Joseph told me one time Brother Joseph brandom he said we were talking about um some of the things that were were going on in church and the Lord was really blessing us in the church and and there were some people that raised it to a level that was too far and I remember Brother Joseph told me he said the holy spirit will take it up to a certain place and then sometimes we will take it higher than that to a place that the Lord didn't want to go so he can bless us up to a certain spot but then we can take it to a place that's not the Lord's will sister Jessica [Music] I know we going through the fire it's getting hard to stand the heat but even harder is the wondering is God's hand still on me it's lonely in the Flames When you're counting days of pain but The Potter Knows the Clay how much pressure it can take how many times around the world till there's submission to his will he's planned a beautiful design but it'll take some fire and time it's going to be okay cuz The Potter Knows the Clay friend I just came through that far not too very long ago and looking back I can't see why and that my go God was in control but on the hottest days I'd cry oh Lord isn't it about time but The Potter Knows the Clay how much pressure it can take how many times around the week till there's submission to his will he's planned a beautiful design but it'll take some fire and time it's going to be okay cuz the poter Knows the Clay he's land a beautiful design but it'll take some fight and time it's going to be okay cuz the Potter He Knows the [Music] Clay okay the last question and brother Arie I'm going to start with you and all of the young people their ears are going to perk up and um this is a very very important question I remember when we would have camp and I was one of the counselors this was the question that the the guys they'd all get together and they said uh brother brother Daniel how' you know how did you know who to marry and I want to go let's let's have fairly short answers but I I want to go through and and pull the audience here and ask how did you know that this man or this woman was the one that God had chosen for you well for me it took some time for sure I did know I fell in love with Rachel and uh when she left the camp up in Colorado I was love sick literally I it was a family Camp up in where your wife used to I mean your mother-in-law sorry and she um left and I was I told to a couple of brothers and said yeah we're all like that but we won't say it so I'm not sure they were telling the truth but I couldn't even eat for a day or two and and some people talked me into eating and I threw up so that's how love sick I was but then it took about three years before we were married three and a half years and the towards the end you know Jesus said who God puts together let not man put aund so I feel like I my father-in-law told future father-in-law told me to stay in Tucson I came down to um well find myself I'll say it that way maybe find God but then I just joke around a little bit too much you know and and so I found myself and I just want to lose myself now and and but I came down and and he says yeah you better get a little more serious uh her father did so he said stay here till I come back I'm going to take her back to Indiana and then we're going to come back and I I waited quite a while I don't remember how many days or weeks and I was my grandma my grandma and we didn't have phones and she didn't even have a phone a regular landline and I told the uh uh told my dad gave him a pay phone to call and tell whoever answers the phone that I'll pay him when they bring the message to me it was at cortero farms where that Walmart is now there's a little post office box and I mean a post office real post office and a little store and the phone so I was just getting ready to leave I mean I would been gone in seconds with my truck back up to Oakland and my aunt drove right in front of my car my truck and said jumped out and said Do You Believe In Miracles I said sure what's going on she said um by walking by this pay phone she said and it was ringing she said and the store owner said don't answer it it's always the wrong number and she said well this might be my lucky day and she answered and it was Sammy Allen was calling for my dad my dad didn't want to waste time doing that you know so he had Sammy Allen do it Sammy Allen says stay there because your sisters are coming in from a mission Michigan camp and then that night Rachel came back so that's not real you know a Audible Voice but it did well I I knew I was in love with her you know I mean I thought of a lot of her and that but I'd seen a lot of failures a lot of messes a lot of things I was not interested in and Paul said it was better to be single so I was going that route as best I could every time I get alone or her you had some time to think I'd think about her you know so I don't know how to say it that was just my experience very good someone else brother I knew you're were going to raise your hand and I'll go to you next this not might not be the place but uh the holy spirit is a part of the story and I hope you'll give me Grace uh especially some of your parents but uh I knew when I had four kids and I was at cand Dutch and poor as heck and we were four years I mean we were five years married with four kids and I had to have my wisdom teeth out and when I had my wisdom teeth out um Sarah took care of me and she called my boss you know I I took care of everything not not when I was knocked out with my wisdom teeth and she took care of me and she drove me around and she she called I had three job so she called EV every different job and told them what was going on made sure that I was okay and everything and then in retrospect I realized the passion that we had had over the four years and all the all that stuff it it had God's hand in it every step of the way it took me until I had four kids and had my wisdom teeth out to realized that I was in this thing that had been going along all the while so yeah it uh it's not exactly love it's First Sight and the and God coming down in a light shining it was after after going through so much so much and and growing up and growing up and looking over and having the love of my life right there taking care of [Applause] me where do I start start I was 16 years old when I first saw my husband uh my mother had invited me to go to the grocery store and once I got there I told her I don't want to get down I'll just stay in the car and Charlie I guess he I had never seen him before and he was taking groceries out and helping this lady put her groceries in the car and while he was gathering baskets he went right next to my car and I heard a a voice and it said that's your husband wow and I was very shy so I scooted all the way down to the dashboard and I thought I hope he didn't see me I hope you didn't hear what was said and the rest is history we were married for 53 years that's amazing yes sir I asked her six times before she said yes one time for each kid yeah one for each child that's pretty good brother eron for me I was living in Israel um same group that brother Lyle was in and Kathy and I started corresponding um we didn't have email we didn't have weren't able to phone but we would start to correspond the old the oldfashioned way write a letter and it's been an amazing journey with a fabulous woman like Kathy but I have to say that God was in it the whole way I didn't know it right at first but I would write a letter asking her a question and a matter of I i' mail my letter and a day or two later I got a response I got a letter from Kathy and she was already answering the question that I had asked and she hadn't gotten my letter yet so each and this went on for three four months and uh just knew that God was in it and just uh it's it's you can't explain it any other way I mean God was in it and it was just uh been the the biggest blessing in my life sometimes you just know someone else sister Heather I love my dad I trusted my dad I always thought look my dad loves me he only has good in mind for me so if I ever get the thought of somebody I'm going to check and be sure what he thinks so La was amazing he brought me flowers he wrote poetry and all this stuff and I was overwhelmed by all this this amazingness and so I went to my dad I said dad I don't know if I love him or if I like these things that he's doing you know and so he said well he said Heather he's a this is he my dad wasn't in the message he said he's a fine Christian young man he from A Fine Christian family he uh he's pretty smart and he said he's a little bit skinny but you could fix that and there was not one thing negative so I left my dad think okay all right I can look at this positively so all I would say is please don't bypass your parents yes that should have been a standing ovation and dads always have a good relationship with your kids especially your daughters because they will they'll trust you someone else how' you know what six the six times it was actually five times I did first I have to um clarify something I said prior um the meatball soup it was leftovers with when meatball we'd had a lot of Meatballs the day before but there was only soup with one meatball left and that's when I don't even remember if I prayed or not but anyway we all got one meatball in our Bowl but I did not know Aaron was one I did a lot of praying and my advice to young girls would be pray and pray and when you think you've prayed enough pray some more um I just knew that the thought of not being with him was like too painful but then I wanted to be sure so when he asked me I said no because I don't know but you know there never was the certainty of oh I know he's the one but there was the fact that I could not stand to not be with him and then even after I got married which is funny but some people might not think it's funny like two weeks after our wedding I'm like oh no what did I [Laughter] do but I I you know 44 years I think we're going on so the Lord's been with us just the Lord keep the Lord in it always always it's been 25 years and I I think my wife says oh no what did I do anyone else who's you pointing sister Rachel you obviously had this guy you had this guy enamored I mean he couldn't eat he was wasting a away to nothing how did how did you know it was him I didn't really know either but I I do know that he won my whole family because every time he came he would bring gifts um but my mother asked me a question this was after I was engaged I was close to getting married and she says well how do we know this is right and I says well Mom I don't know what the future holds but I feel like you just trust the Lord with day by day and if and if he if you feel like it's right today you know you look to the Future he's going to take care of the future so that's how I took it thank you all right Amos both of you I don't want to start a fight no I'm just kidding how' you know was that um at first I didn't know but um I grew up very isolated and um I saw you know I left for college after a while and spent about six years at College much too long and then uh while I was in college I um started seeing like different people and know the way they were and then when I met Abby I could just tell there was something different about her and that I really wanted to marry her and whether it was right or not that's who I was going for okay Abby was he right my story is a little more spiritual than that if you know us we I knew him as a friend for a long time he hung out with my family all the time you'd see him with them and I wasn't even around like we were good friends and then I fell with feelings for him and I asked the Lord and it was one of those things when you're like I want this so badly and you're fighting the Lord for it and the Lord's telling you no and you're like but I want it and I can't get it up and I know you're asking me to give it up and so I was like okay I'm not going to have peace until I give the Lord what he's asking so I said okay Lord I he's yours not going to not going to go for that so um we stayed friends obviously um and then he went to they' have the Easter meetings and stuff at Jeff so he would still go back there and remember he went back for those and he decided he also had feelings for me um so when he came back we started dating he talked to my dad we started dating and all this time I all I felt was I never got a yes from the Lord I always remember I got a no but it bothered me because I never got a yes and we were engaged for a long time and this now that I think about it I'm like this is not a good thing if you have a question in your heart you should not be marrying someone until you get your yes but then I found out but later it was the Lord so I um we engaged we fought a lot because with our different backgrounds we have a lot of the same ideas but we're coming at it from the different and we fought everything out so much so people are like do they even love each other like should they be getting married but we fought so much that after we got married we' fought everything out so you know it was better but we were engaged we're driving down the road me and Rachel and I'm like I just wish there was a big sign in the sky this is who you should marry the biggest longest shooting star I have ever seen in my life just fall straight down Rachel's about losing her mind because she probably was also worried for us and so she's like there it is there it is and I'm like I don't know so Rachel's like I think that was for me so we get married and even after it still bothered me like you never got your yes you got your no but you never went back and got your yes and it wasn't until probably years we were married and his mom M told me that time he went back East is when he got the Holy Ghost and the timing was so perfect that the Lord said no and it's after he got the Holy Ghost then we started dating and then we got engaged and then you know so it wasn't for a long time where I was sure yeah this is what the Lord um but I had a second part to that story that's been on my heart the other night when the northern lights were coming so shooting stars always are special to me now I'm like it's little confirmation from the Lord that you know Amos is mine um so shootings the uh northern lights were coming and I got home late and I wanted to see it um and me and my sister had just been talking about being a good mom and how to be a good mom to my kids and I always question myself and I'm always like you know praying and wondering am I doing a good job so that was on my heart so it we got home really late they put the kids to bed and I'm standing outside I'm like Lord I want to see this like this would be really cool I want to see these lights um and now as I'm out there I shoot see a shooting star like falling and it was just like oh yeah that's cool so Chloe hadn't gone to sleep yet so I brought her out and I show we got to see the Northern Lights it was real faint it kind of just looked like dust but I took a picture with my phone and you could see the pink and the streaks and um and then we saw another shooting star together and then it was like your children were on your heart and you were talking to the Lord and he gave you the one of the desires you just asked him to see these lights and you got to see them and he gave you the shooting stars so now it's like shooting stars are now Amos and my entire family it's like the Lord knew how to speak just to me amen and show me I'm mindful of you this is special to you this is what I do for you and like the lord always knows how to speak to us individually and things that mean something to us so you might still not know but if you see a shooting stop the Lord knows that you know um to go with that um I knew right when I met her that I was going to marry her she just didn't know so amen praise the Lord the musicians can can get ready my my testimony with Stephanie's real similar to brother Amos um I just knew well first of all the first time I saw her I was like wow that's the prettiest girl I've ever seen in my life but there's something that goes beyond that and one thing that was always important to me is I wanted a wife that was going to be a good mother that was the number one criteria in me choosing a wife was that she was going to be a good mom and you know I was 21 22 23 24 and my friends started getting married and I didn't I didn't have a wife and I you know they tried to set me up with with different people I just I just don't like being around this person but when I met her the first time that we talked I just wanted to get around her again and then I wanted to be around her again and now it's been 25 years and I still I want to be around her all the time and that's when God you know that God really gives you the right one brother just say [Music] God be the glory to God be the glory to God be the glory for the things he has done with his blood he has
