[7:42] that
[7:44] it smote us Lord your great love for us

[23:54] the greatest blessing is going to be
[23:56] when I open this book and and read the
[23:59] Bible
[24:00] but I think that we're going to have a
[24:03] the Lord's going to give us
[24:05] a nice foundation for the word brother
[24:08] Nathan you have a testimony for us
[24:11] and brother Nathan Roberts asked to give
[24:13] a testimony before and I thought it was
[24:15] a perfect time right now God bless you
[24:26] God bless you all tonight so
[24:29] I just I had quite the day today and I
[24:32] figured that I needed to share it just
[24:34] felt like a good night
[24:38] but um brother Peter said I was quoting
[24:42] Psalms 23 in between songs there though
[24:44] I walked through the valley of the
[24:45] shadow of death of fear no evil right
[24:48] he's with us
[24:50] but I woke up this morning and uh
[24:53] I just looked on my phone and saw a
[24:56] bunch of my investments all crashed down
[24:58] lost a bunch of money on that and I'm
[25:00] like oh well that's okay he gives any
[25:03] taketh away that's okay
[25:05] going through the day I'm getting my
[25:06] stuff done I'm doing my homework I
[25:09] go get I got a new motorcycle a couple
[25:11] of weeks ago they get home and then
[25:14] riding it put a whole I put 1600 miles
[25:16] on it already it's been two weeks it's
[25:18] been riding it having so much fun went
[25:20] on Mount Lemmon
[25:21] uh so I take it and I was washing it
[25:24] this afternoon and I washed it and I set
[25:26] it there and I go take a shower and get
[25:28] ready for church and go out and I get on
[25:31] my bike and I put on my helmet and I'm
[25:33] wearing what I was or I was wearing what
[25:34] I'm wearing now I go out in front of my
[25:37] house onto my street and I'm going about
[25:39] 15 forward and uh then I accelerate to
[25:42] about 25 and as I'm going through the
[25:44] middle of the road where they have it
[25:46] tarred over for where they fixed the
[25:48] road there was uh something slick
[25:50] uh and when I when I gave it a little
[25:53] more gas my back tire flew out from
[25:55] under me and the bike just went skirting
[25:57] down the road at about 20 miles an hour
[25:59] uh and I just was sitting there and in
[26:03] the middle of the road and I was holding
[26:04] the brake handle and my hand is it
[26:06] because it fell off and uh the only
[26:08] scratch I had on me was right here and
[26:11] that that's it and just it's good to see
[26:13] that uh
[26:15] he's here with me he's keeping me safe
[26:17] and I just like to be reminded of that
[26:18] and I wanted to share a verse and I know
[26:21] it's going to be new to you you've never
[26:22] heard it before
[26:24] uh brother Peter if you could put it up
[26:26] it's uh Romans 8 28
[26:30] and we know that all things work
[26:31] together for good to them that love God
[26:34] to them who are the called according to
[26:37] his purpose and I just know that
[26:39] everything works out for the good and so
[26:41] even though I lost some money this
[26:43] morning and I'm just messed up my brand
[26:47] new bike and uh it's okay and I the only
[26:50] I'm wearing slacks right now and there's
[26:53] about two holes this big on them and no
[26:55] scratches on my legs so that's it and uh
[26:59] about 15 minutes later I got in my car
[27:02] to drive here and I got a call
[27:05] uh and it was an acceptance uh for an
[27:11] offer I put out and the guy was calling
[27:13] me and said I got the con track and I'm
[27:16] gonna be setting up his weather station
[27:18] and a bunch of other electronic stuff
[27:20] for him and so even though I lost stuff
[27:22] it's like oh well that just fixed
[27:24] everything it's like now I fixed the
[27:25] bike now I got my stuff back and I just
[27:28] thought that it was uh it was pretty
[27:29] amazing where it could have been
[27:32] anywhere I I was driving here and I see
[27:34] it you know probably 10 cops out and
[27:36] it's raining and uh
[27:38] there was two times where someone came
[27:42] about this close from hitting me on the
[27:43] freeway in my car and it's like well I
[27:46] went down and I was just sitting there
[27:47] in the middle of the road right 20 feet
[27:48] from my house and maybe if I was to
[27:51] drive it here to church today then I
[27:53] would have been in the middle of the
[27:54] freeway so just gotta really give it to
[27:57] him and appreciate him that he's just
[27:58] there with us so
[28:00] uh
[28:03] no I just I just uh want to share that
[28:05] and I appreciate it so if I could just
[28:08] say a quick prayer real quick but
[28:10] dear Lord Jesus thank you for being with
[28:13] us Lord we really appreciate you and
[28:15] that you're able to carry us through the
[28:16] day and even when things might seem like
[28:19] they're out of place and might seem like
[28:21] it's unfortunate lord well we just know
[28:24] that you're right there and we wouldn't
[28:25] have anything to lose if you didn't give
[28:27] it to us in the first place and we keep
[28:30] your promises and our cup runneth over
[28:32] so I just wanna
[28:34] say how much I appreciate that
[28:37] it really blessed me every day and I
[28:40] just like to be reminded of it
[28:42] in Jesus Christ's name amen

[29:02] about that testimony

[32:05] tired and
[32:07] and teachers I didn't have anything
[32:10] to bring to the church whatsoever
[32:12] I I just it's like Lord I don't know
[32:16] I don't I don't know about anything how
[32:19] can I how can I bring something to the
[32:21] church I just I just don't have it and I
[32:23] woke up the next morning and I said my
[32:25] call brother Aaron I'm going to tell him
[32:27] you know over there and I
[32:29] can't I don't uh I just don't have
[32:32] anything I'd like to like to rest and
[32:34] and um I made a commitment some time ago
[32:37] that I put the Tabernacle first
[32:41] that if I would if I would have an
[32:43] invitation to speak here that I would
[32:45] take this invitation and if I didn't
[32:47] have an invitation then I would I would
[32:49] speak in other places
[32:51] so
[32:53] brother why I didn't want to I made that
[32:55] commitment to myself and I just didn't
[32:57] want to break it you know so
[32:59] I I drive to work and I park in the in
[33:01] the parking garage and I'm walking to my
[33:04] office and this it's kind of it's still
[33:06] dark the sun's just starting to come up
[33:09] and
[33:10] I'm I'm going and I'm saying I can't I
[33:14] don't I don't have anything I'm going to
[33:16] call brother Aaron and I'm just going to
[33:18] relax and and just go and hear hear a
[33:21] tape or hear one of the brothers preach
[33:22] and and as I was walking along the
[33:25] sidewalks something said and and friends
[33:27] I don't say it was the Lord that's a big
[33:30] statement to say the Lord told me
[33:33] so I'm not it's it's if you if I say
[33:37] Lord told you the Lord the Lord told me
[33:39] the Lord really did tell me but this I I
[33:42] had
[33:43] this thought that came to my mind as I
[33:47] was walking
[33:48] and it said what about absalom's tomb
[33:54] and I said I said yeah I said um
[33:58] that was a really bad deal
[34:00] this
[34:01] absalom's pillar
[34:03] and
[34:05] kept walking
[34:07] and I said I said but Lord I uh
[34:12] I'm just tired and it's Wednesday night
[34:16] and and there won't be there won't be
[34:18] very many people there and something
[34:20] said will there be one
[34:23] I said yeah yeah they'll be one
[34:27] okay
[34:28] okay so I get I get back up to my
[34:32] my office and I started praying about
[34:36] what to speak on tonight
[34:40] and I wanted to speak on what Legacy we
[34:42] will leave
[34:44] and you know one of my weaknesses and I
[34:48] got a lot of kind of wear my weaknesses
[34:50] out of my out of my shirt sleeves
[34:52] everybody can see them one of the
[34:54] weaknesses I have is is I'll start
[34:57] thinking about something and and it
[35:00] immediately I can't do it I can't put
[35:02] this sermon together
[35:03] and it's just like I can't do it I can't
[35:05] do it and and I'll keep trying and and
[35:08] it's just always there that you can't do
[35:11] it and I remember when I was in the
[35:13] ministry in Jeffersonville I um I wrote
[35:17] All The Catch the vision magazines I
[35:20] wrote them from cover to cover and I
[35:22] remember
[35:23] sitting at my desk
[35:25] and saying I can't do it there's no way
[35:28] there's I can't even think of one word
[35:30] to put together how can I put together a
[35:33] whole magazine
[35:34] and I just sit down brother Joe and I
[35:37] just start writing
[35:38] and it would just it would just start
[35:40] start coming and and the Lord would
[35:43] provide and
[35:45] I think so often why do I get so uptight
[35:49] I can sit down in my chair and open this
[35:54] book
[35:55] and wherever I turn there's a sermon
[35:58] there and it will happen every single
[36:01] time it doesn't matter if I'm in second
[36:03] Kings or Leviticus or second Samuel
[36:06] there is a sermon everywhere in this
[36:10] Bible from Genesis to revelation
[36:12] and I thought
[36:14] I've heard it's said before
[36:18] that we can't
[36:20] understand
[36:22] this Bible
[36:24] without someone to interpret it to us
[36:27] I do not believe that
[36:29] this Bible says this
[36:31] it says in in second Timothy 3 16 it
[36:35] says that all scripture is given by
[36:37] inspiration of God and is profitable for
[36:40] Doctrine for reproof for correction for
[36:43] instruction and righteousness
[36:46] now if you don't have the Holy Spirit
[36:48] then I can understand that
[36:51] but the prophet said that God is his own
[36:55] interpreter
[36:57] did he say that have you heard him say
[36:58] that
[36:59] so why cannot God interpret this
[37:02] scripture to me
[37:04] but Joe he can't
[37:06] and I was thinking and why do I why do I
[37:09] get so so worried and so upset about
[37:11] this all I have to do is just open up
[37:13] this word but Jeremy and it just flows
[37:15] you know how it is it just feels good in
[37:18] in reading this word
[37:20] and thinking on these things and uh
[37:26] I I love
[37:29] that the prophet taught us that we can
[37:32] go to this Bible and that we are not
[37:34] Catholic
[37:36] the Catholics teach they have always
[37:39] taught throughout history that the
[37:42] common man cannot understand this book
[37:45] in fact they took all of the original
[37:48] manuscripts which were written in Hebrew
[37:51] and in Greek most of them
[37:54] and they translated them into Latin
[37:58] why did they translate them into Latin
[38:00] because nobody spoke Latin
[38:02] that's why they translated them into
[38:04] that only the highest educated priests
[38:07] spoke Latin and then you know what they
[38:09] did with the manuscript they burned them
[38:11] they got rid of them because us common
[38:13] people couldn't understand this word we
[38:15] had to have a priest
[38:16] explain it to us that is a lie
[38:20] and let me tell you that's everywhere
[38:23] you can open this Bible each one of us
[38:27] you don't need me or a priest or anybody
[38:29] else to have this Bible to understand
[38:32] this
[38:33] you get it yourself
[38:36] that's why you spend the time in doing
[38:38] this don't just sit in the in the Pew
[38:41] and listen to the preacher three times a
[38:43] week no you get into it you understand
[38:47] it you have that relationship with
[38:50] Christ
[38:51] now God does send gifts into the church
[38:55] and to help us to understand these
[38:58] things to help us to teach these things
[39:00] he sends teachers and pastors to help us
[39:03] to understand what's in this Bible but
[39:06] ultimately all of us have to have that
[39:08] relationship all of us have to
[39:11] understand it
[39:14] and uh
[39:17] the gifts that God places in the church
[39:19] are to promote a relationship with
[39:22] Christ not develop a relationship
[39:24] between us
[39:25] or not to bring a dependence
[39:28] on this Pulpit right here but to get a
[39:31] dependence on God himself
[39:34] I think of some of these great men in
[39:37] the past that have left incredible
[39:40] Legacies I think of John Wycliffe John
[39:43] Wycliffe took this Latin Vulgate
[39:47] and he translated it in English
[39:50] took the bible translated into English
[39:52] and he said I want everybody to be able
[39:54] to read this and you know what the
[39:56] Catholic Church did they burned him they
[39:58] killed him
[40:00] and then we have
[40:02] other people we have John Huss
[40:05] took the mantle one of the people to
[40:06] have it we see we see Martin Luther we
[40:09] all have heard of Martin Luther Martin
[40:11] Luther took the original Greek in Hebrew
[40:14] and he translated into German at the
[40:16] same time there's another man named
[40:17] William Tyndale he translated the Bible
[40:20] into English so we could have it they
[40:23] left this Legacy so that people could
[40:26] themselves read this book and understand
[40:30] it
[40:31] they killed Tyndale too
[40:34] they they hated it and that's spirit's
[40:37] here today you gotta have
[40:39] you got to have this guy
[40:42] in the Pulpit or you can't understand it
[40:44] that's a lie
[40:45] you get it for yourself or this guy's a
[40:48] failure
[40:50] all right you with me
[40:52] I'm a success brother while we are a
[40:55] success if we can get the people to read
[40:58] this book and and to understand it
[41:02] I was as I was going over and asking
[41:06] Lord what do you want me do you want me
[41:07] to minister what what do you want me to
[41:09] minister on and I've been thinking about
[41:11] this last sermon that I preached here on
[41:13] the talents in Matthew 25
[41:16] and how these talents are a sum of money
[41:19] that they had the one guy with one
[41:21] Talent the other two the other guy with
[41:23] five talents
[41:25] and um
[41:26] they uh these talents are worth about a
[41:28] million bucks a piece that have great
[41:31] value
[41:32] and I was thinking about the one man he
[41:34] buried this these talents this talent in
[41:37] the ground and how he was just an
[41:39] ultimate failure he ended up in hell
[41:41] this man
[41:42] these other two men they they doubled
[41:45] what God had given them they worked hard
[41:48] for the Lord
[41:49] I was thinking
[41:51] thinking on
[41:52] on these things and
[41:54] and
[41:56] wondering Lord
[41:59] in leaving these talents what good do
[42:02] they do
[42:03] well there is a legacy that needs to be
[42:06] left from each one of us I was just
[42:09] talking with brother Peter in the back
[42:11] and we were talking about
[42:14] what are we going to leave our children
[42:17] if God tarries
[42:19] what is this world going to look like in
[42:22] 10 years 20 years
[42:24] with the thing the way things are going
[42:26] on right now what are we going to do
[42:30] and what are we going to leave for our
[42:31] children and our children's children
[42:34] it's not looking good as far as the
[42:36] world goes
[42:39] and I was I was thinking about this man
[42:43] named Absalom
[42:45] Absalom was I believe David's third son
[42:50] and
[42:51] he was a man that was young man full of
[42:55] charisma
[42:57] I mean he knew how to speak and he was
[43:02] the best looking guy in the whole
[43:03] country
[43:04] the Bible says this Rachel he didn't
[43:06] have a blemish from the bottom of his
[43:08] foot to the top of his head good looking
[43:10] dude stay away from that kind of guy
[43:12] though
[43:14] but he was he was just he was perfect
[43:18] and and
[43:20] what he did is is his brother committed
[43:23] a sin against his sister and he waited
[43:27] two years and he ends up getting his
[43:30] servants to kill his brother murder him
[43:34] whether his brother deserved it or not
[43:36] that wasn't for him to decide or anybody
[43:39] else
[43:40] so
[43:42] he ends up killing his brother
[43:45] and he got exiled for doing it
[43:49] so he he has to leave and then
[43:53] David kind of gets tricked into allowing
[43:56] this young man to come back in the area
[44:00] of the city
[44:02] and so Absalom stayed by the gate
[44:06] as people would come in and Absalom was
[44:09] a very wise young man and when these
[44:12] people would come in they knew that his
[44:14] name well he was David's son so he
[44:16] automatically had a lot of respect so as
[44:19] the people would come in AB someone
[44:22] would say hey I can judge your problems
[44:24] for you because you're going to be
[44:26] waiting in line forever for the king
[44:29] so why don't you just let me handle
[44:31] these things he had a lot of wisdom so
[44:33] he was successful in doing this and he
[44:37] started to get the support of the people
[44:41] right so
[44:42] Absalom
[44:44] started to get puffed up and let me tell
[44:48] you this young man was a spoiled brat
[44:52] he was not a good person did not have
[44:55] the character anywhere close to the
[44:57] character that his dad had
[44:59] so
[45:00] he starts he starts judging he starts
[45:03] gaining power
[45:05] and then
[45:07] he decides he wants the whole Kingdom
[45:10] so Absalom makes his move the people get
[45:13] behind him David ends up leaving
[45:17] his own City in Exile
[45:20] sad
[45:21] it would take I think he had 600 men
[45:23] with him so he goes and he leaves
[45:27] and uh
[45:29] they end up
[45:31] David was a wise man and a warrior
[45:35] and David ends up
[45:37] winning this battle that ultimately
[45:40] comes from his battle with his son
[45:43] he um
[45:45] if you want to read it what I've been
[45:47] talking about is in second Samuel
[45:49] 13.
[45:51] through 18 those chapters so I'd
[45:53] encourage you to read this story about
[45:55] this man Absalom but let's turn
[45:59] to second Samuel chapter 18.
[46:02] so what happened I think it's kind of a
[46:05] it's probably a kind of a famous story
[46:06] most people probably know what happened
[46:08] they were in battle Absalom who had all
[46:11] of this hair
[46:13] he's he's writing in battle and he gets
[46:15] his hair stuck in the oak tree and he
[46:17] gets knocked off his horse and he's
[46:19] hanging there in the oak tree and joab
[46:21] David's General comes up and he kills
[46:25] Absalom
[46:27] and it devastated David
[46:30] this was the man that had taken David's
[46:35] Kingdom
[46:37] this is the man that had done that had
[46:40] double-crossed and lied and cheated and
[46:43] took his kingdom and look at the Spirit
[46:46] of Christ in David
[46:49] verse number 33
[46:51] says this
[46:53] and the King was much moved and went up
[46:57] to the chamber over the gate and wept
[47:00] and as he went thus he said oh my son
[47:03] Absalom my son my son Absalom I would
[47:07] God
[47:09] I had died for thee o Absalom my son my
[47:15] son look at Jesus Christ right there in
[47:18] the King David
[47:19] my son and look at of all of our sins
[47:22] that we commit and yet in all the sins
[47:25] we've committed against the king
[47:27] and yet our lord Jesus says my son my
[47:32] son
[47:32] I would die for you
[47:35] the difference between David and Jesus
[47:38] is Jesus actually did
[47:40] he took
[47:42] he took the cross so that we might live
[47:47] and we look at the different Legacy
[47:50] between these two men
[47:52] this Bible says and David was a man
[47:54] after God's Own Heart
[47:57] and Jesus himself
[47:59] is called the son of David
[48:01] how great of a man is this King David
[48:05] this man who killed he killed this giant
[48:07] Philistine he won thousands of battles
[48:10] for the Lord and he left a legacy as
[48:12] great as anyone in the book To Where
[48:15] Christians even Muslims and Jews they
[48:19] admire this man David
[48:21] this Legacy that this David
[48:24] developed
[48:26] goes until this day some 3000 years
[48:28] later
[48:30] but what I want to talk about first
[48:35] is this man absalom's Legacy
[48:38] it says here in second Samuel 18 18.
[48:42] now Absalom in his lifetime had taken
[48:45] and reared up for himself a pillar which
[48:47] is in the Kingsdale for he said I have
[48:50] no son to keep my name in remembrance
[48:52] and he called the pillar after his own
[48:54] name and it is called unto this day
[48:57] absalom's place
[48:59] now I preached about a few weeks ago
[49:02] when I was here I preached about the
[49:03] talents and I talked about
[49:06] Jesus coming down
[49:09] from the mount
[49:10] from the Temple Mount he walked down
[49:13] into this Kidron I think it's a Kidron
[49:15] Valley right he walked down into Kidron
[49:17] Valley came up the other side and they
[49:19] looked back up
[49:21] at all of these beautiful buildings up
[49:24] there
[49:26] well I was there
[49:28] in that place
[49:30] a few years ago
[49:33] and their
[49:36] in this Kidron Valley
[49:38] there is this absolutely beautiful
[49:42] Monument
[49:44] brother Jordan if you'd show that first
[49:45] picture
[49:46] this Monument is called absalom's
[49:51] pillar
[49:53] and you say there you see right there
[49:57] this is what represents this place that
[50:01] Absalom built up to himself now I know
[50:03] brother Lyle that that brother Lyle was
[50:07] going to say well actually brother
[50:08] Daniel that is from the second temple
[50:11] period because of of the architecture
[50:13] there and it's only probably 2 000 years
[50:16] old rather than three thousand years old
[50:18] but when it was excavated and brother
[50:20] Lyle you would be right not to put not
[50:22] to put words in your mouth but it
[50:25] represents to this day when they first
[50:27] found it they thought that this was
[50:30] absalom's pillar that he built
[50:32] and over the years
[50:35] this place women
[50:38] and fathers mothers and fathers would
[50:41] take their children to this pillar
[50:44] and they would throw stones
[50:47] at the pillar and they would disrespect
[50:49] it because and they would tell their
[50:52] children this is what happens to a
[50:54] disobedient child
[50:56] and when I was there when I when I went
[50:58] to this place
[51:00] everything in Jerusalem is is clean when
[51:04] I went to this place behind there I saw
[51:07] trash
[51:09] I saw it smelled bad
[51:12] there the place was a place of
[51:16] disrespect
[51:18] was not clean
[51:20] it was it was it was a bad it was a bad
[51:23] place
[51:24] and and I was as I was reading about I
[51:26] said oh that's because this is absalom's
[51:29] legacy right here that this man built
[51:32] this thing up for himself
[51:35] so that I can have this Legacy
[51:39] and thank you brother Jordan that's
[51:41] that's good till we go to the next
[51:42] picture that's that's good so
[51:46] I was thinking about this as I was
[51:48] walking
[51:49] down the sidewalk and I was thinking and
[51:52] I was thinking about my experience there
[51:55] and the filth that was part of that
[51:58] monument and I was like Lord
[52:01] that was bad
[52:03] that that that Legacy to that man was
[52:07] bad and I then brother Kurt I started
[52:09] thinking about this election
[52:12] that was coming up
[52:14] that we had yesterday
[52:17] and I was thinking what are these
[52:20] politicians
[52:22] that are running on these things what
[52:24] Legacy are they going to create for this
[52:28] United States of America
[52:30] they're running on things like
[52:33] legalizing drugs
[52:36] they're running
[52:38] on things
[52:39] like entitlements
[52:41] for the people so that they don't have
[52:43] to work
[52:44] then just stay home and collect a
[52:46] paycheck they're running on these these
[52:49] things just to buy a vote
[52:51] when this book
[52:53] says here in first Timothy Chapter 5
[52:56] that if someone doesn't provide for his
[52:58] own especially his own his own family
[53:00] he has denied the faith in his worse
[53:02] than an unbeliever
[53:04] and yet they're running on these
[53:07] pretenses that oh you don't have to work
[53:09] you can just collect a check
[53:14] there's for second Thessalonians says
[53:16] this is a that if a man
[53:18] If any man would not work neither should
[53:20] he eat
[53:22] let me tell you there'd be a lot less
[53:24] homelessness if we'd enforce that today
[53:27] but these are what these politicians are
[53:29] running on and imagine and even today
[53:31] they're saying well even our president
[53:34] and I
[53:35] I've said don't speak against dignities
[53:38] and don't don't speak against the
[53:40] president you know don't complain about
[53:42] these things but it's sin
[53:46] what they are running on they're running
[53:48] on transgender rights they're running on
[53:50] these horrible these horrible things and
[53:53] what are we leaving what will they leave
[53:55] for the Next Generation in this country
[53:58] what would this country look like in 10
[54:01] years
[54:02] electing the people that we are electing
[54:05] and voting on the things that we are
[54:07] voting on if if a
[54:10] boy doesn't want to be a boy you can
[54:12] just switch over and be a girl now
[54:15] same thing with a girl wanting to be a
[54:17] boy
[54:18] how messed up are these things and
[54:20] they're running on these tickets and
[54:22] getting votes for them
[54:24] you know we think about we think about
[54:26] brother Branham
[54:28] and he got a lot of criticism for for
[54:30] preaching about
[54:32] about uh women having long hair and
[54:35] about a man being a man but do you think
[54:38] that maybe God knew that in 60 years
[54:42] that this would be happening and he
[54:44] wanted to warn us we get legalistic
[54:47] about it
[54:48] and we say oh you have to have this cut
[54:50] hair and this this type of skirt but we
[54:54] missed the whole point God was warning
[54:56] us that this time here now today is
[55:01] coming who would have merely who would
[55:03] have ever saw
[55:04] 30 20 30 40 years ago what we see today
[55:08] it's awful and we have Paul
[55:12] running on these things running on these
[55:15] terrible
[55:16] formats
[55:19] and pushing this stuff down our throats
[55:22] and getting votes and getting elected
[55:25] and we're voting them in
[55:28] where do you think this country is going
[55:29] to be in 10 years
[55:32] let me tell you what the prophet said
[55:35] he said this
[55:37] the last and seventh vision
[55:40] was wherein I heard a most terrible
[55:42] explosion
[55:44] and as I turned to look I saw nothing
[55:46] but debris craters and smoke all over
[55:49] the land of America
[55:53] the seventh vision
[55:55] that he had in 1933
[55:58] we're there
[56:00] we it is right around the corner
[56:04] and it
[56:06] you know I hear people sometimes they're
[56:08] like oh great there's going to be an
[56:10] earthquake and all these people are
[56:11] going to die and all this this is gonna
[56:13] California is gonna sink and there's
[56:15] gonna be a an earthquake in Los Angeles
[56:17] and and all of this I don't want to see
[56:20] it happen
[56:22] I don't want to see people die
[56:24] I don't want to see all of this apostasy
[56:26] and this filth and all of this in this
[56:29] country brother Joe I love this country
[56:32] this country has been good to me
[56:34] it's allowed it to where I can make a
[56:37] living and I can prosper and I can
[56:39] preach the gospel in the pulpit and not
[56:42] worry about the government coming in the
[56:44] door like it does in other places
[56:47] I have a friend I have a friend in Iran
[56:49] Youssef Narda Connie he's been in prison
[56:52] in and out for preaching this same
[56:54] gospel they'll come right in the door
[56:57] and arrest him he spent half three
[57:00] quarters of his life in prison for the
[57:02] past 10 15 years
[57:04] because he preaches this gospel right
[57:07] here
[57:08] I thank God that I don't have to worry
[57:10] about that in this country it breaks my
[57:12] heart brother Kurt that that this is
[57:14] happening to this country
[57:16] you know brother Branham said he always
[57:18] liking Luke 17.
[57:21] Luke 17 says as it was in the days of
[57:24] lot so shall it be in the coming of the
[57:28] son of man so shall it be in the second
[57:31] coming of Christ what happened in the
[57:33] days of lot
[57:35] what was going on
[57:37] it was Sodom
[57:39] and who had the power
[57:41] we see lot
[57:43] he was in his house
[57:45] and these these two angels came these
[57:48] two young men came
[57:50] and lot was afraid of the mob that came
[57:54] it's because they had the political
[57:55] power he was the mayor of the city
[57:58] and he was afraid
[58:00] and look where we are now
[58:03] we we have to suck it down and they they
[58:06] force it down our throats
[58:08] and there's nothing left but what the
[58:12] prophet said that this place is going to
[58:14] burn
[58:16] behold the day cometh I shall burn us in
[58:18] oven
[58:19] and all the proud yea and all that do
[58:21] wickedly so shall be stubble but it also
[58:25] says that the righteous shall walk out
[58:27] on the ashes of the wicked
[58:29] it is a terrible day
[58:32] and it makes me sad I don't ever say yay
[58:36] this is wonderful no this is terrible
[58:42] and I have a burden
[58:44] for these people that are going through
[58:46] it and they're deceived
[58:49] but thank God that we have this word
[58:51] that I can go and I can turn to Luke
[58:53] chapter 17. and I could say wow this
[58:57] looks amazingly like today
[59:00] and it does
[59:02] I uh think about absalom's Legacy
[59:06] you know we're destroying our economy
[59:10] we're destroying our morals
[59:13] and I think about a man like Absalom his
[59:16] legacy is nothing but destruction
[59:19] it's all about me and how I can promote
[59:22] myself and if nothing but destruction
[59:26] follows and look at the world today
[59:29] it's all about
[59:31] this I work on campus at the U of A I
[59:35] don't know how these people walk around
[59:36] how they don't run into the wall all the
[59:38] time with all the pictures they're taken
[59:40] of themselves it's all the time you know
[59:43] so selfies and and and posting on on all
[59:46] the social media and all that it's like
[59:48] good night that has never been the case
[59:51] well obviously they didn't have these
[59:52] things before but but it's never the
[59:54] Vanity's never been the case like it is
[59:56] today and we see it
[59:59] it's a warning we're there we have
[1:00:04] arrived and it's a sad day no matter
[1:00:08] it's terrible
[1:00:09] to look around and see what's going on
[1:00:11] in our world
[1:00:13] I think of absalom's Legacy 20 000
[1:00:16] people
[1:00:17] David's own people died
[1:00:20] because of this Insurrection because he
[1:00:22] wanted to be somebody
[1:00:24] he was the King's son he was the most
[1:00:28] qualified he'd have probably been king
[1:00:30] after David
[1:00:32] but no he wanted his own thing he wanted
[1:00:36] it now
[1:00:37] if you'd have prayed about it you would
[1:00:40] have saw what kind of a great man his
[1:00:41] dad was
[1:00:43] things would have been different
[1:00:45] but
[1:00:47] there's another tomb that's next to that
[1:00:50] one for the wild that that pillar
[1:00:54] and this tomb
[1:00:56] is from the prophet Zechariah again it's
[1:00:59] probably not the same one
[1:01:01] um but they still call it Zacharias too
[1:01:06] I've walked down if you want to show up
[1:01:08] brother Jordan I walk down
[1:01:10] from absalom's tomb down the valley a
[1:01:14] little ways just a few hundred feet and
[1:01:17] you see this tomb carved out of the rock
[1:01:19] there
[1:01:22] and that represents the Tomb of the
[1:01:25] Prophet Zechariah
[1:01:28] this man also has a legacy
[1:01:33] do you see all of these great do you see
[1:01:37] all of those stone that stone work
[1:01:38] behind it
[1:01:40] those are Graves those are tombs
[1:01:44] those tombs are about this wide about
[1:01:46] this long and about this wide and that
[1:01:49] is where these Jews are buried and
[1:01:52] there's like a hundred thousand of those
[1:01:55] tombs
[1:01:56] and many of those people
[1:01:59] are buried there because of the Prophet
[1:02:02] Zachariah and something that he said
[1:02:05] let's turn to Zechariah Chapter 14 if
[1:02:07] you could put it up brother Jordan I
[1:02:09] mean uh
[1:02:10] uh brother Peter brother Jordan
[1:02:13] um Zechariah 14 verse 1 says this
[1:02:16] behold the day of the Lord cometh
[1:02:19] and thy spoil shall be divided in the
[1:02:21] midst of thee for I will gather all
[1:02:23] nations against Jerusalem to battle and
[1:02:25] the city shall be taken and the house is
[1:02:27] rifled and the women ravished and half
[1:02:29] of the city shall go forth into
[1:02:31] captivity
[1:02:32] and the residue of the people shall not
[1:02:35] be cut off from the city then shall the
[1:02:38] Lord go forth and fight against those
[1:02:42] Nations as when he fought in the day of
[1:02:45] battle
[1:02:46] and his feet shall stand in that day
[1:02:49] upon the Mount of Olives which is before
[1:02:52] Jerusalem on the East if you put that
[1:02:55] picture back up that all of those graves
[1:02:59] are spread across
[1:03:02] the Mount of Olives
[1:03:04] and many or most of those people that
[1:03:08] are buried there are referred to this
[1:03:11] scripture they say I want to be there
[1:03:15] when that sun rises over the Mount of
[1:03:18] Olives and Shines on the Temple Mount
[1:03:21] and the Messiah comes down I want to be
[1:03:25] buried there
[1:03:27] look at
[1:03:28] look at the Legacy
[1:03:30] of the Prophet Zechariah
[1:03:33] even Jesus himself
[1:03:37] spoke about Zechariah in Matthew 23 he
[1:03:40] says this
[1:03:43] Matthew 23 35
[1:03:46] . Jesus as I preached last time I was
[1:03:49] talking about him being in the temple
[1:03:51] and and the last sermons that he
[1:03:53] preached in public and he jumped all
[1:03:55] over the priests and he says this he
[1:03:59] said that upon you may come all the
[1:04:01] righteous blood
[1:04:03] shed upon the Earth from the blood of
[1:04:06] righteous Abel
[1:04:08] unto the blood of Zacharias son of
[1:04:10] barakayas whom you slew between the
[1:04:13] temple and the altar speaking of this
[1:04:16] man
[1:04:17] that has the tomb right there that I
[1:04:20] showed
[1:04:23] a legacy a great legacy of a great man
[1:04:28] of God
[1:04:29] and I think about us
[1:04:33] the Legacy that we need to leave to
[1:04:37] those that are behind us
[1:04:38] and it's not too late
[1:04:41] the wrath of God can be stayed
[1:04:44] there needs to be more people come in
[1:04:48] to the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:04:52] but we have to be a man like Zechariah
[1:04:58] we have to be someone that is willing
[1:05:02] to put ourselves second
[1:05:05] and to put God first
[1:05:08] I want to mention
[1:05:10] I want to mention a
[1:05:13] a sister
[1:05:14] and we talk about the brothers sometimes
[1:05:16] we get up here and we preach we're
[1:05:17] talking about David and Goliath and we
[1:05:19] want to talk about Moses and we're going
[1:05:21] to talk about all these great prophets
[1:05:23] of God but there are some great women of
[1:05:27] God too
[1:05:28] and I want to talk about a couple women
[1:05:31] that nobody
[1:05:32] I've ever really heard talk about
[1:05:36] these are special ladies
[1:05:39] that were so special that they were
[1:05:43] recorded in this book
[1:05:45] by the Apostle Paul
[1:05:48] let's go to Second Timothy chapter one
[1:05:52] verse 5.
[1:05:55] this is the Apostle Paul speaking
[1:05:58] to his Protege Timothy who became the
[1:06:01] Pastor Paul is training this young man
[1:06:06] and he says this he says when I call to
[1:06:09] remember it's the faith the unfeigned
[1:06:11] faith that is in thee which dwelt first
[1:06:15] in thy grandmother Lois and thy mother
[1:06:18] Eunice
[1:06:19] I am persuaded that in the in thee also
[1:06:25] look at the Legacy that Lois and her
[1:06:28] daughter Eunice left
[1:06:31] there's also there was obviously
[1:06:32] something special about these two
[1:06:34] sisters they had this great amount of
[1:06:37] faith and and they they the lowest they
[1:06:39] were taught her daughter and then her
[1:06:41] daughter taught their son Timothy and I
[1:06:44] always wonder
[1:06:45] what about Timothy's dad
[1:06:49] it doesn't even mention Timothy's dad it
[1:06:53] says that you are this great man you're
[1:06:57] this Legacy because of your mama and
[1:07:00] your grandma
[1:07:02] how wonderful
[1:07:04] how important it is that we live a life
[1:07:08] worthy of this gospel that I raise my
[1:07:10] son
[1:07:11] and my daughter to love this word
[1:07:15] because who knows what they are going to
[1:07:17] do in the future
[1:07:19] who knows what Legacy what is going to
[1:07:24] happen from this Legacy and we look at
[1:07:26] Timothy Timothy's one in my opinion
[1:07:29] from what Paul wrote in his instructions
[1:07:32] and how Paul when he wrote him two
[1:07:34] letters and he he laid out the church
[1:07:38] he said this is how you do it everything
[1:07:41] from pastors to deacons to to prayer to
[1:07:44] all of these things he laid this out and
[1:07:47] he knew how great Timothy was because he
[1:07:51] knew his mama and his grandma
[1:07:54] great women of God
[1:07:57] creating a legacy in children
[1:08:01] sister look at those kids
[1:08:03] they're giving testimonies
[1:08:06] you know these Rob Roberts kids God
[1:08:10] bless them here at church on Wednesday
[1:08:12] night and all the all the miles that
[1:08:14] they drive just to be here praise the
[1:08:17] Lord building a legacy
[1:08:20] for a day to come if there is one
[1:08:23] I feel so bad
[1:08:25] about what we're leaving
[1:08:28] our children
[1:08:29] I feel so bad about this country
[1:08:33] I feel like
[1:08:36] the brother Branham said that the back
[1:08:38] was broke broken when we took Mama out
[1:08:43] of the family
[1:08:45] and and we didn't have love in raising
[1:08:47] our kids anymore because mom was gone
[1:08:50] and I look at it and I as I've said
[1:08:53] before I work on campus at the
[1:08:55] University
[1:08:57] oh
[1:08:58] it just Grieves me I think oh Lord but
[1:09:02] their souls
[1:09:03] you know and I love them and I want to I
[1:09:07] want to represent the Lord Jesus to them
[1:09:09] you know anybody that ever says you know
[1:09:12] if if they go to to Walmart or or
[1:09:16] wherever and they say oh it just Grieves
[1:09:18] me so bad all these people well what are
[1:09:21] you doing about it
[1:09:24] you're just going to let them die in
[1:09:26] their sins
[1:09:28] no I believe it was Ezekiel that said
[1:09:32] that that there was a Watchman that God
[1:09:34] said a Watchman on the hill
[1:09:36] and he tells that Watchman he says if
[1:09:40] you don't warn the people
[1:09:42] you will be guilty of their blood and
[1:09:45] you'll answer for it but if you do warn
[1:09:48] them
[1:09:49] then you'll be free if they still sin
[1:09:52] friends we need
[1:09:55] to warn
[1:09:57] people in a loving way in a right way
[1:10:01] to win these people for the Lord
[1:10:05] because the Legacy that we leave
[1:10:08] is going to last either for eternity
[1:10:12] or it's going to be like this pillar
[1:10:15] erected by this man
[1:10:18] David's son
[1:10:20] who was nothing but a disgrace to this
[1:10:24] day
[1:10:26] and like I said if you ever go to Israel
[1:10:29] and you go to that Monument
[1:10:32] it's just different
[1:10:35] it's a different feeling there
[1:10:39] it took me back when I was there I
[1:10:41] thought why is all this
[1:10:42] you don't see trash anywhere there's
[1:10:45] even graffiti back in there you never
[1:10:47] see anything like that
[1:10:49] and I looked it's like this
[1:10:52] this dirty and the people disrespecting
[1:10:53] that that I read the stories about how
[1:10:56] the children throw rocks
[1:10:58] at the monument
[1:11:01] because they disrespect this is what
[1:11:03] happens
[1:11:06] to a disobedient child
[1:11:09] this is where they end up
[1:11:11] I want my legacy
[1:11:15] I want it to mean something I want
[1:11:19] I want this church
[1:11:22] I want this church to be a monument
[1:11:26] to Jesus Christ in this day
[1:11:30] what what friends if the Lord goes on 20
[1:11:33] years what were the Tucson Tabernacle be
[1:11:36] where are we going to be we have to work
[1:11:38] we have to leave a legacy for our
[1:11:42] children
[1:11:43] or is it our Legacy is just going to be
[1:11:45] well it just kind of faded away
[1:11:47] everybody got old and they left
[1:11:49] no
[1:11:51] this has to be a legacy for a generation
[1:11:55] to come
[1:11:57] we have to be that Legacy
[1:11:59] we have to build and move forward
[1:12:03] because look at this world coming down
[1:12:06] around us as I said we have arrived
[1:12:11] we've arrived to Luke chapter 17. as it
[1:12:15] was in the days of lot
[1:12:17] these days of Sodom were there
[1:12:19] we've arrived
[1:12:21] I am
[1:12:23] I'm going to close I got
[1:12:26] about halfway through my notes and and I
[1:12:29] had in my notes I wanted to talk about
[1:12:32] brother branham's Legacy
[1:12:35] and and I wanted to talk about
[1:12:38] um
[1:12:38] how
[1:12:40] we see these Skeptics attacking and
[1:12:44] trying to destroy his legacy
[1:12:47] we see the so-called count can cancel
[1:12:50] culture
[1:12:52] how you just erase history
[1:12:54] and you change it
[1:12:56] and then I see we have these over here
[1:12:59] trying to attack him and to lie about
[1:13:01] him and then we see this side over here
[1:13:04] doing just as much damage to his
[1:13:07] ministry by saying he's infallible and
[1:13:10] he's perfect and he never made a mistake
[1:13:13] and doing this damage over here trying
[1:13:15] to hold him to a a standard that nobody
[1:13:18] could live up to
[1:13:20] all it does is hurt his ministry it
[1:13:23] throws doubt on it
[1:13:24] that's a that's one of the worst things
[1:13:26] you could do to him leave him alone
[1:13:29] don't attack him like that from either
[1:13:32] side I wanted I wanted to talk about
[1:13:34] that I wanted to talk about I want to go
[1:13:36] under the cloud and and
[1:13:38] how the the bridge and and I have in my
[1:13:41] notes a lot of those things but I just I
[1:13:43] feel like we should uh sister if you
[1:13:46] want to come to the piano I feel like
[1:13:49] um maybe we should close a little early
[1:13:51] tonight and I want to sister Rachel did
[1:13:54] you say Amen
[1:13:57] I'm just kidding
[1:14:00] I was kidding then sister Rachel closing
[1:14:03] a little early
[1:14:05] no you just thought it
[1:14:07] no
[1:14:09] no I uh
[1:14:11] I wanted to I wanted to ask the church
[1:14:14] um a favor
[1:14:16] I uh and it's a personal favor I've got
[1:14:19] I've got a friend
[1:14:21] that um
[1:14:23] I've mentioned her before
[1:14:25] and she's got a child
[1:14:28] that has chronic kidney disease
[1:14:32] and I prayed for and I really felt like
[1:14:36] like the Lord heard me
[1:14:38] but it's gotten worse
[1:14:40] and I was with Daniel Dan was with me
[1:14:42] when when we were talking with the the
[1:14:45] lady and um
[1:14:47] she's upset that her daughter's in
[1:14:49] relapse
[1:14:51] I was thinking
[1:14:52] Lord
[1:14:54] where is the god
[1:14:57] of William Branham
[1:14:59] that was

[1:15:34] before the Lord he was burdened he was
[1:15:36] about to go to the cross and he said
[1:15:38] Lord may they be one
[1:15:41] As We Are One
[1:15:44] and he said Lord May the world see your
[1:15:49] son because of their love one for
[1:15:51] another
[1:15:52] to see that we could show that Jesus is
[1:15:56] the Messiah by our unity and our love
[1:15:59] one for another
