pass me by amen you know it was a great thing in the old testament when joshua spoke to the sun and stopped the sun but when bartimaeus spoke he stopped the son of god amen got jesus attention and jesus touched him opened his eyes and so i believe he's a high priest this morning that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities just thank the lord for the privilege to be with you this morning and bring you greetings from our church there back in north carolina our pastor brother josh bennett asked me to give all of you his greetings and from my wife who would have liked to have come with me but and we'd actually planned that and purchased the tickets and then she remembered that there was a funeral planned this weekend for her her co-worker's husband and so she was unable to come this time but if the lord would permit in the future for us to come back we'll bring her with us and uh you can get to meet her and enjoy the fellowship with her but we just love the lord this morning amen trust you've come to hear from him and receive from him i'll invite you to turn with me in your bibles to colossians chapter 1. we'll read a few verses of scripture i'd like to say i really enjoyed the worship service this morning and the songs the selections had just just really blessed my heart and know the lord many times as a minister when you feel the lord has inspired you in a certain direction uh and then you watch that song service and having no you know collaboration or uh agreement there with the song leader but see the holy spirit is guiding everything to a certain channel it just is a wonderful confirmation and to know god has everything in his control and you know that's our desire this morning for everything that's done and said it's for him to be glorified and for him to be magnified and we see the lord doing that and just thanking for it we'll go to the lord in prayer just before we read his word and i know there are many needs among us and we know the lord is jehovah jireh this morning heavenly father we are grateful that we have the privilege lord to come and gather this morning lord is a body of believers and you made a great promise lord that where two or three would be gathered in your name lord that you would be in the midst thereof and lord we are confident this morning lord by faith we know that your word can never fail your promises can never fail and so we can have that assurance lord and then in addition to that lord we uh we fill your presence with us this morning lord we feel your holy spirit and just know lord that you are here and you are guiding and directing you're orchestrating the service this morning lord that your children can be blessed and edified and ministered to lord they may come into the doors of this sanctuary this morning lord battling with a sickness lord or pain or conditions lord in their lives but we know lord when we go out of these doors lord we can go healed lord and delivered and free lord and we can go with a greater faith in our hearts lord in knowing father god that you are in complete control of every situation lord knowing lord that as you minister your word to our hearts this morning lord that word father god lord is is overpowering every other force every other influence lord every other attempt of our adversary satan lord to defeat or destroy our lives we know we have victory in you this morning lord so lord through the pain and through the symptoms lord we we just lift our hands this morning lord to give you thanks and praise lord for who you are lord and for the reality that you are to each of us your children this morning and we pray father that in this service lord that you will be lifted up and magnified and lord it will be drawn into your presence lord in every other care or distraction lord or hindrance lord would just fall to the side lord would just fall behind us lord and we want to enjoy lord time this morning in the shekinah glory in the holiest of holies may you grant it this morning father and have your way lord in our midst and father for those present and for those listening and this morning lord may your presence go and just envelop each and every one of your children father god and minister lord to our hearts we ask in jesus name we pray amen amen colossians chapter 1 and we'll begin reading at verse number 12. giving thanks unto the father which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sins who is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him amen and he is before all things and by him all things consist he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence amen as you're seated this morning we'll ask the lord to bless the reading of his word and i want to speak uh this morning for a subject or for a title god's prevailing desire god's prevailing desire and we know that the the words that we have read this morning from colossians chapter 1 paul is describing this preeminence of christ in in his body in his church and we believe we're a part of that this morning amen by the grace of god and also i just want to refer to another scripture in isaiah chapter 9 verses 6 and 7 where it says there i know you're familiar with this for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counselor the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace we know these scriptures are speaking of jesus christ who at this time it's a promise it's a coming isaiah is prophesying of god coming to earth in the form of human flesh amen as a person and then he says in verse 7 he says of the increase of his government and peace shall be no end and i believe we'll see this morning as we go into this message that we are a part of that government we are part of that kingdom paul said he has translated us into the kingdom of his dear son and then isaiah says of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end amen there will be a continual increase of it amen all through eternity upon the throne of david and upon his kingdom to order it and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even forever the zeal of the lord of hosts will perform this amen i can rest this morning and have confidence that it's not my desire it's not my zeal it's not my ability it's not my works amen but isaiah said the zeal of the lord of hosts will perform this amen when when jesus asks his disciples in matthew chapter 16 whom do men say that that i am amen they said some say thou art elias or jeremias or one of the prophets and he said but whom say ye that i am and peter said thou art the christ the son of the living god amen and jesus told peter blessed art thou simon bar jonah for flesh and blood has not revealed it unto you but my father which is in heaven and upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it amen it's it's a work that he is doing it's a determination of his amen and we're included in that and we're a part of that but we can't fail any more than he can fail amen because it's his working it's his doing when when jesus was here on the earth and uh through his earthly journey and his earthly ministry we know that as as he began his ministry here upon the earth he invited 12 disciples to be a part of that ministry and and he called them from all backgrounds and all walks of life and he lived with them he journeyed with them he ministered before them and he even gave them a part of that ministry themselves to go out amen and to for his ministry to exercise itself through their lives here upon the earth but then he he comes to them one day and he tells them something he says it's expedient for you that i go away and i would imagine you know even looking on that today and much more so being those disciples we could we could ask and and no doubt they may have asked how could it be any better for us that he would go away i mean everything we are today is a result of him having invited us and called us from our background and from the way of life that we knew before him and just being invited by him and being joined to him and having uh this fellowship that we've had in this relationship with him over these last three or three and a half years has transformed our lives into everything that we are how could him leaving us be any better than what we have enjoyed over these last three and a half years of our lives but he told them and it was it was true nonetheless amen despite how difficult it may have been for them to believe that there was something greater than even they had experienced up until that time amen there was something greater that his death his burial his resurrection and his ascension was going to make possible and we want to look at that this morning because we're enjoying that greater this morning amen by the grace of god and i trust even if you don't realize it or you can't see it just at this moment by the end of this service you'll see amen the greater that he made possible amen was was realized not only by those disciples but by all of the new testament church amen every redeemed son or a son or daughter of god has enjoyed that greater that he sp that he uh promised to them and that he spoke of there when he told them it's expedient for you that i go away now the bible tells us in amos 3 verse 7 surely the lord god will do nothing until but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets this is a principle it's a pattern of god before god does anything he first comes and reveals what he is about to do through the ministry of a prophet amen before god destroyed the earth by water in the flood he came and revealed to a prophet noah what he was about to do and you know to the world that sounded like well for one thing they didn't believe it they didn't believe there was any truth to it but if they believed there was anything to it it sounded like a message of judgment it sounded like a message of punishment amen it sounded like you know the judgments of god were about to be poured out on onto the earth and indeed they were but you know what what what became a message of judgment to the unbeliever was a message of grace to the believer amen because in that same message of of the coming flood was also a way of escape made amen that to get onto the ark that god had instructed noah to build was going to float them amen the same water that would drown the unbeliever was going to lift the believer or the overcomer amen to be spared from the judgments of god so god would do nothing until he first revealed it by unto a prophet in the earth same in moses day amen before amen god poured out his wrath and his judgment on egypt he sent a prophet he sent a prophet to prepare a people for what god was about to do and so i'm thankful we're living in the hour that god is is doing something in the earth amen but before he does it he sent a message to reveal it through a prophetic ministry and one of the things that the prophet of god has brought to us in this hour was that before time began before the world was formed before anything was spoken into existence god in his mind had a plan god had a purpose amen god had desires that he wanted to express and in this message christ is the mystery of god revealed the prophet of god begins to describe a threefold purpose of god that has been contained or has been hidden in the mind of god since the foundation of the world and through all of time through all of the creation it meant through through the the through man coming to earth and time unfolded in the fall of man and the redemption of man through the old testament and even through the new testament ages this secret has remained a secret in the back part of god's mind but now in this hour hallelujah amen in this age we're living and in this ministry god is now ready to reveal something that for 6 000 years has been a secret and i say this this morning if god's revealing something he must be about to do something amen if god is going to unfold or to release or make known something that has been a secret for 6 000 years god is preparing to accomplish something god is preparing to express something god is preparing to unfold something amen that was too great to be revealed or to be made known or for the secret to be let out prematurely amen but he's kept it as a mystery to withhold the the the uh i don't i can't even think of the word amen just the power or the magnificence of what he's about to do god has held it in reserve all of this time but has now made it known amen and so as the prophet of god begins to describe this he said his first desire was to reveal himself in jesus christ and i'll say this you'll notice as you watch how the prophet describes this threefold purpose each fold or each stage of this threefold purpose makes way for the next stage or makes way for the next fold so god came to earth in the person of jesus christ and god began to reveal himself amen reveal his character his nature and his attributes in the ministry of jesus christ and the world and many amen in the world missed god revealing himself in jesus christ they thought he was a man trying to make himself equal with god but they failed to realize he was god making himself equal with man amen he was god uh lowering himself it was god condescending himself to come to earth and express himself in a form that we could realize in a form that that we could comprehend in something amen in a way that we could relate to who god is and jesus christ i love how brother branham says he thought that that god was mad at him but christ loved him and then he realized that jesus was the very heart of god expressed now you think about that we see god revealing himself in wrath and in judgment and and we see the great and terrible even power of god and character of god and the judgments of god all through the old testament but when we when we see jesus christ come to the earth we see the heart of god expressed a god who hated sin but he loved the sinner and a god who expressed himself amen to to fishermen and to farmers and to the common people of the earth and could even go and speak to a woman living a life in adultery and prostitution living a life wrapped in sin and entangled in sin and yet he could love that sinner he could love that man that woman and draw them from even the power of sin that had gripped their life amen and could transform them into his very image that was the heart of god expressed amen god was revealing himself in jesus christ amen and so the second fold of that purpose was to gain the preeminences in his church and that's where i want to dwell on this morning or what to focus as god's prevailing desire and this great desire of god to have the preeminences in his church how could he achieve the second fold of this purpose amen was by the firstfold by revealing himself in christ there would be a church there would be a people amen who could understand that was god amen that is god in the person of jesus christ coming to the earth amen to die for our sins to take upon himself amen the the wretchedness of what we had become to then impart unto us his righteousness and all that he is amen to gain the preeminences in his church you know i believe this morning i'm just simple enough to believe if god desires to do something he's going to do it oh my if god wants to do something it's going to get done and if that desire would involve you this morning if that desire would involve me if that desire would involve us this morning despite our failures despite our weaknesses despite our shortcomings and all of our inabilities amen i don't have a lot of confidence in in my ability or even my desires but if this is god's desire i have the utmost confidence in his desire and it's his desire this morning amen that it's being expressed and is being revealed not only as a as a concept not only as a thought i mean not only a as as just you know an idea but it's a reality and this reality is being made known in his church in this hour and i want to say this i i when i speak of how god has kept this as a secret in the back part of his mind for all of these years and all of these ages amen i believe it has held something in reserve that is to be realized by the church in this day and in this hour in a greater way than ever before but you'll see as we go on a little further he has already been expressing this desire and he has already been unfolding it amen since the day of pentecost so this word i want to take a moment to to look at the definition of this word preeminence because that's the word that the prophet of god used to describe this second fold of god's threefold purpose was to gain the preeminences in his church and preeminence there there are three definitions that the dictionary gives and the first is superiority in excellence or distinction in something commendable superiority in excellence or distinction in something that is commendable preeminence the second deals with precedence or priority of place superiority in rank or dignity and it references the scripture there we read in in colossians 1 18 that in all things he might have the preeminence in all things he might have the precedence or the priority of place amen how many believes amen he needs to have first place in every area and every aspect of our lives amen that's god's desire is to have that the the third definition it gives is superiority of power or of influence superiority of power or influence so you'll hear two words that are used two or three words in each of these definitions superiority precedence or priority so all of these terms that you hear use to describe preeminence are relative terms they are are terms that are comparing one thing to other things amen superiority is something that is superior to other things and precedence and priority they all are dealing with one thing in comparison to others and so amen we realize uh precedence or priority or or superiority is something that prevails over others something that becomes prominent or preeminent over others amen and so god is desiring to have the preeminence there are other there are other powers there are other forces paul said amen that all principalities and powers were created by him and for him amen so there are other there are other forces in play there are other powers at work but god's desire is to become preeminent above all those others and then to express that preeminence in our lives the prophet of god begins to describe this in the message christ is the mystery of god revealed paragraph 141 he says the first thing was that god wanted to reveal himself to the people to the people he couldn't do it as a great jehovah god who covered all space time and eternity he could not he is too great to ever be revealed to people because it would be too mysterious but what he wanted to do he loved fatherhood for he was a father and the only way he could express it was to become a son i love that the prophet of god didn't say to have a son he said to become a son i i heard a brother years ago make this reference he said god didn't want to to have a family god wanted to become a family god wanted to express himself as a family amen that's the reason jesus kept saying the son of man see they didn't know what he was talking about many of them but now you get it see he wanted to express himself that was one of his great threefold purposes was to express himself identify himself with human beings to reveal himself in christ secondly to have the preeminence in his body of believers see the first thing brother brown says he wanted to reveal himself to the people now he says secondly he wanted to reveal himself to have the preeminence in his body of believers that is his bride that he might live in people oh my amen the whole reason he was revealing himself and he was living amen jesus said the son of man does nothing until the father shows him his life amen was the life of god or the life of the father expressed here on the earth but not only to make us look and marvel at what god was doing in him but to show what god was doing in christ he wanted to do in every son and daughter of god amen to come and live in his church in his people amen this great purpose now being revealed revealing himself and having first to reveal himself in christ the fullness of the godhead bodily how many would say that this morning jesus christ is the fullness of the godhead bodily revealed he says and then to bring that fullness of the godhead bodily into a people the same fullness of the godhead bodily into a people that he could have the preeminences the oversight and the leading i again if god desires to do it surely it's going to get done surely there's somebody that's going to believe amen surely there's going to be someone like mary be it unto me lord according to thy word i don't even understand how you're going to do it i i don't understand all you know it sounds almost too great for the human mind to comprehend but god if it's your desire lord if it's your will if this is your purpose be it unto me according to thy word so preeminence it it deals with oversight it deals with importance it deals with superiority and it deals with rank and through all of the years that i've heard the prophet of god preach this and describe this to us in my mind i always thought of preeminence in exactly the terms that the dictionary gives superiority precedence priority uh rank dignity you know uh we think of these things in human terms and paul even talked about how the gentiles have leaders over them and and you know uh rank and all of these things we think in these ways and that has always been the way my mind and the way this word preeminence would would strike me when i would hear it but a number of weeks ago or some time back this just began going through my mind over and over again his desire to have the preeminences in his church and what what struck me about this or what just seemed to to come to the the surface of my realization was that this this term that the prophet of god is using this this word preeminence yes it it deals with all of those things but it also deals with with dominance where there are other influences other powers even other attributes or other characteristics or qualities what it seemed the holy spirit began to to impress upon my heart was this preeminence isn't only dealing with his headship and his leadership and and his control or or direction or or power because you know as as a husband and as a father i mean that that husband that father has the headship over that home he he is the head of the body he's the head of the wife and so you know that deals that deals with more than just calling all the shots that deals with more than just making all the decisions you know the the pastor is is the is the head of the local assembly and brother branham says the pastor i believe i believe it was i'm quoting this right he said the pastor has the final say but he didn't say the pastor has the only say amen the the the pastor is the head of the body but he's listening a good pastor is listening to the needs and he's listening to the feedback and and he's listening to how god is is leading the church as a body as a whole and then he's he's he's taking all of that in and then he's saying lord what's your direction amen what's what's your way amen of of responding to these needs amen of leading us and guiding us to where you're meeting all of those needs and so a husband yes you know he's the leader he's the head but he's more than that he's also the provider i mean he's he's discerning the needs of that family of his wife and of his children not only their physical needs or or their financial needs but also their emotional needs all of those things so he's he's looking at that he's discerning that and then it's a channel through which those needs are supplied and those needs are provided amen as as the headship or having the preeminence it involves that it also involves the protection amen now think of this in the terms of who christ is as hamming the preeminence amen he's also the provider of the church and he's also the protector of the church nothing can enter the church that is under his headship without coming through him first amen he's the door to the sheepfold he's the great shepherd amen every trial every temptation every sickness everything you desire amen had to first come through his approval and he only allows it to make you stronger he only allows it amen to reveal his qualities his characteristics his power in you but here is the other thing that that that came to me in this i believe that this preeminence that the prophet of god is speaking of and and and describing to us is dealing in addition to the headship and the leadership and the control i believe what god is is is showing us is that all that christ is all of his characteristics and all of his qualities are becoming preeminent in the lives of every one of his sons and daughters all of his nature all of his character amen all of his healing all of his salvation all of his love all of his forgiveness all that god is and all of his nature and it's too too majestic for me to describe in human terms but we understand this morning there is a great contrast between who he is and who we are as as men and women as boys and girls as human beings amen we're born you know i i was i was sharing with with someone yesterday was sharing the gospel with a lady that was uh sitting beside me on the airplane and i said you know i've my wife and i are caring for an eight-month-old child a little girl and our um by the grace of god our uh we're designing to adopt her i said you know she's just an eighth month old child and she's just precious as she could be but i said we are all born into this world sinners because of the fall of man in the garden of eden we have no choice in the manner we're born in sin and shape and iniquity i said i'll never have to teach her to be jealous i'll never have to teach her to be selfish i'll never have to teach her how to shade the truth or hide the truth because those characteristics are already in her and she said that child can be jealous i had showed her a few pictures of the of our baby and i said yes i said when when when sister faith takes another child and holds her in her arms our our little girl will begin to cry she's getting jealous she wants she wants to be held by her mother you know and so you can see those things expressing themselves so how much more so as you grow into a a boy and a girl and a young man and a young woman and then into adulthood you see those human characteristics you see that that that flesh that sinful uh you know those those attributes that you're fighting with and you're struggling with and how great a contrast is that to the nature of christ yet he is desiring to have the preeminence it's his desire and through amen through the ministering of his word and through the ministering of the holy spirit his desires and his qualities and his nature is taking preeminence over ours and is prevailing amen so that that sinful man and that sinful woman that we are and it doesn't matter how you got it it doesn't matter how you obtained it you know we can all make a list of reasons why we are the way we are you know it was my environment brother tim it it was the way i was raised it was my mother it was my father it was my grandparents there's a whole lineage of people that are just this way i was born with this but there's a greater power amen there's a greater life there there's a greater force amen that is projecting itself amen is presenting itself into the lives of men and women who are the sons and daughters of god amen i love where david said thou hast given me the heritage of those that fear thy name because i believe the psalmist looked down through the path of his life and he knew how wretched he was he knew how sinful he was but he could also see those moments amen when when another amen another power was overcoming him and overtaking him and he would he could kill the bear and he could kill the lion and he could kill goliath and even his own lustful desires and all of those things could be overtaken by a higher power and a greater nature and he said you've given me a heritage you've given me the heritage of those that fear thy name amen so it it amen no matter what our reasons or what our excuses may be this morning he takes them all away amen it's him these hiring to express himself and so his holiness his worthiness his righteousness his healing his salvation his deliverance and then we realize the conditions and the challenges that we face in our lives give opportunity for his attributes to become preeminent and the contrast enables us to appreciate his preeminent qualities paul says in second corinthians 4 verse 6 for god who commanded the light to shine out of darkness hath shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ and he says in verse 7 but we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of his power may be of god and not of us and he says we're troubled on every side yet not distressed and we're not immune from what's going on in this world we we feel the pressure we face the challenges amen we are we are subject amen to the same influences we're we're not immune from them but he says we're trouble in every sign yet not distressed amen we are perplexed but not in despair we're not without hope we're not without an answer we're not without a source amen we're persecuted but not forsaken we're cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body the dying of the lord jesus that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our body for we which live are always delivered unto death for jesus sake that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh he says in galatians 2 verse 20 he says i am crucified with christ nevertheless i live yet not i but christ liveth in me and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me amen you know i i think about isaiah and someone had had brought out here sometime back i heard a brother minister and he said you know before isaiah had this experience of being lift seeing the lord high and lifted up isaiah was was was giving all of the woes woe is israel woe is israel for the idolatry and their backslidden condition and his eyes were on the people of israel and in the nation of israel he he was a prophet to israel and he was seeing all of their faults and all of their shortcomings but when he was lifted up into god's presence he wasn't saying woe is israel any longer he said woe is me he said lord i'm undone i'm a man of unclean lips and i dwell amongst an unclean people you know i think so many times we have what i call comparative religion we are comparing ourselves to others around us and we're looking at their life and their condition and and their testimony or their walk with the lord and you know we we might say well i know i'm not as i'm not what i ought to be but i'm certainly not as bad as that person you know that brother that sister but see when we're called into his presence and we see who he truly is in the light of his glory then it puts the focus right where it belongs amen then we realize it's my own condition that i need amen that i need to be concerned with and that i need him to address amen and thankful thankfully when isaiah when he cried out oh lord amen send an angel with a life call from the altar to touch my lips amen he knew there was a remedy for his condition there was a remedy amen for where he was in his life and i'll say this morning the only reason god brings you in to his presence amen to reveal to you your condition to bring conviction in your life to show you i mean your condition i'm so thankful this morning because we're living in an age that that doesn't want to really take a real self-evaluation we're living in an age that says i'm rich i'm increased with goods i have need of nothing amen but their self-evaluation is much different than god's evaluation of them amen but to the true believer amen the only reason he brings us into his presence to show us our true condition as contrasted to who he is is to show us there's a remedy there's a way amen amen conviction comes to show you you don't have to stay the way you are you don't have to remain in that condition and you could say oh brother tim i'm not lost this morning i'm not living in sin i'm not drinking or smoking or committing adultery any of those things but i'll say this morning you don't have to remain under that sickness you don't have to remain with that disease amen you don't have to accept the conditions amen that the enemy is trying to place on you but being brought into his presence amen we'll show you a remedy we'll show you away amen we'll show you an atonement that was given a worthy atonement a sufficient atonement hallelujah a man to bring us into his image and to the glory of who he is a touch from a live coal from the altar gave isaiah a reliance on god's commission god's purpose for his life amen and when when god has a purpose for your life he'll make a provision for your life that his purpose may be fulfilled you know moses had a long list of reasons why he could never do what god was calling on him to do but god's list was longer than moses amen god's ability to perform was greater than moses list of excuses i'm so thankful for that the the commission will prevail over our deficiencies or all the shortcomings in our life amen and it's his desire this morning this is god's prevailing desire you know it's like for an example it's like a sculptor would take a block of stone and and bring you know when it when us when a sculptor looks at a at that stone at that boulder he sees something that you and i don't see he sees a masterpiece he sees something waiting to be brought from that stone waiting to be revealed and everyone else looks at it says i don't see anything there but it's just another rock it's just another boulder but the sculptor sees a masterpiece and so he uses his skills and he uses the tools that he has a man to bring from that rock and from what looks like just an ordinary stone to the world amen he brings from that a masterpiece by carving away everything else and when you say how did michelangelo bring moses from a slab of granite or marble he just removed everything that wasn't moses and when he was done all that was left was moses it was so how is god going to bring himself out of our lives he's going to remove everything that's not jesus christ amen all your temper all your selfishness amen all of those other things whatever it is in your life amen he's going to chisel it away he's going to he's going to shape everything away amen until all that is left is jesus christ on display oh my it's the sculptor that's getting the glory amen the masterpiece is giving glory to the one who sculpted it and he is getting the glory from our lives this morning amen no matter how wretched the condition of your life no matter what your background and what your past amen that's what enables him to receive glory because the world says i know what he used to be i know what she used to be but my when god got a hold of him when god got a hold of her look what he made out of her life and that gives him glory amen god spoke to an earth one day that the bible says was without form and void and darkness covered the face of the deep but god had a purpose for that earth god there was there was a majestic creation waiting to be revealed and god spoke to that earth and god brooded over that earth until he until his desire and his purpose became preeminent in that earth and yes man fell yes man polluted the earth yes sin and corruption amen has uh has perverted and deformed this earth but you know what god's not through with this earth he's going to bring it back to its original glory he's not going to discard this planet and raise up a new one he's going to take this same planet and he's going to restore it he's going to burn everything away amen he's going to destroy those atmospheres he's going to do all of these things under the sixth seal amen so that he can restore this same earth back to that original glory that he had in his mind before he formed the earth oh my that should give us confidence this morning brother and sister amen your life is like that earth amen god is desiring amen god raised you up for a purpose amen when he stooped down and picked you up from the maori clay he saw a masterpiece he saw a vessel and it doesn't matter how long amen it doesn't matter how scarred it may be it doesn't matter how deformed it may be god is not going to stop the bible says he which began a good work in you will be faithful to perform it until the day of jesus christ he's going to keep working he's going to keep moving he's going to keep shaping your life until your life comes into that glorious image that he has in his mind amen and he gets the glory from that the prophet of god was speaking here in the message trying to do god a service without being the will of god and he was talking about the first forerunner john the baptist and john was you know when john was here on the earth they began to ask him are you the messiah are you the christ and he said i'm not him but his ministry was had come to show the earth now think about this for a moment john was preaching he's coming he's coming there's one coming after me who's preferred before me but really john's entire life and ministry was declaring that he's here waiting to be revealed waiting to be declared waiting to be made known or waiting to become preeminent amen and and john was saying he's standing among you he's there in in he was there in the congregation he was there in the multitude but to everyone he was just another person he was just a galilean he was just a carpenter's son you know he had an unusual birth and at that point he had there there had been nothing amen to to to bring him into preeminence but it was the holy spirit that was going to make him preeminent amen and john was waiting for the holy spirit amen to come and declare unto him now it's time amen for him to come to the forefront and john was saying i must decrease that he might increase and do you realize this morning that as sons and daughters of god every one of you have the same role and the same commission that john the baptist had his purpose was to introduce jesus christ to the world and your purpose as a christian is to introduce jesus christ to the world amen not as a man who walked the shores of galilee two thousand years ago but jesus christ and the person of his redeemed church amen jesus christ in your life amen on your job at your home in your school and whatever your path of life may be amen you have the same responsibility that john had to declare christ to the world but you know what you're going to have to decrease i'm going to have to decrease in order that he might increase amen and he says john was saying i'm not him but he is standing among you and his shoes i'm not worthy to loosen when he comes makes himself known then the prophet of god says this and remember we're on the subject of preeminence and today he is standing among us in the person of the holy ghost manifesting his self more and more coming into his church making his self known because him and the bride and the groom will be the same making his self known and one day you'll see that the one you feel in your heart and see his identification will become personalized before you then you and he are one you've united by the word and the word was in the beginning will go back to the beginning which is god and that day you'll know that i am in the father the father in me i in you and you in me hallelujah we're here hallelujah i'm so glad to see him personifying himself right among us and see what he's promised for the word not with somebody's emotion singing and jumping and dancing but by his word amen he is making himself known amen he his life his nature his qualities are becoming preeminent in our lives in the message the unveiling of god he says this we in him then we being in him we are still veiled to the religionists and professors of the world see our glory that we have and enjoying we are still veiled to them outsiders they think we're a crazy a nut again see that's right but we who are in here in christ baptized into him first corinthians 12 into him we are partakers of this glory see but not on the outside you're still looking in denying it see so now we are invited into him to be partakers of all that he is that in all a double l all things he might have the preeminence and the prophet of god says we are invited into him to be partakers of all that he is we're invited into him which is hid to unbelievers by the veil of human flesh see they know that glory they read of it it's in the word here the glory of god and things like that it's just a word to them to us it's a manifestation see it is no more a word it's a reality amen how many will say this morning it's a reality it's a reality in my life and i want it to become a greater reality amen the bible said of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end amen god can never think of terms he could think in terms of condescending but he could never think in terms of decreasing his condescending was in order for him to increase amen he was on the increase amen in the in in the book of acts he was on the increase in the disciples he was on the increase in the 120 that came out of the upper room but he's been on the increase through each of the ages amen even when it looked like the church was on the decrease god was on the increase because all that the cake and worm and the local worm and the and the caterpillar and the pomegranate have destroyed i will restore saith the lord amen you believe that this morning and i want to just i want to stress i want to emphasize the power of god's word to gain the preeminence in the believer it's just like brother branham said it's not jumping and dancing and shouting now we're we're not against those things i'm certainly not against emotion brother madam said any anything that's you know anything that doesn't have emotion is dead we don't want to be dead this morning amen but you see it's not something that you're producing it's not something that you're generating it's not something that you're working up those things come as a result of what he is doing amen that response that reaction to the word of god think about how the word of god impacted your life others heard the same word others heard the same shout others heard the same message but it didn't catch them it didn't attract their attention it didn't it didn't bring them under the influence of its power but your life was different amen and i believe that word has the power and i i believe the restoration of the word in the hour that we live and the revealing of the word is giving him the preeminence today in a measure greater than any previous time jesus said in saint john 6 verse 53 the words that i speak unto you they are spirit and they are life you know when god sent moses when he met moses in the burning bush and he spoke to him and gave him his commission to go to egypt and call the children of israel out god told moses i am come down i am come down i've heard the cry of my people and i am come down to deliver them to those people of the moses ministry was the voice of god to fulfill his promise that he had given to their father abraham so when they saw that man and they saw that ministry and heard those words it was thus saith the lord to them it wasn't a man it wasn't a you know he wasn't all that egypt thought he was but he was everything that god had called him to be and moses wasn't perfect moses life wasn't without blemish he had murdered an egyptian he he had a track record but when god got a hold of him it made a great difference and they saw god in his life and in his ministry and they heard the voice of god in his words and jesus said the words that i speak unto you they are spirit they are life he says in saint john 14 12 verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also does that sound like preeminence to you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and greater works than thee shall he do his kingdom is on the increase his government is on the increase amen greater than thee shall he do because i go to my father and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that will i do that the father may be glorified in the son if ye shall ask anything in my name i will do it now just to give you an illustration of the power of his word they brought a woman to the lord jesus one day that they had taken in the in the act of adultery and those men took her and drug her up to the lord to attempt him to tempt the lord jesus to see what his response would be and and to speak of the law of moses and and and to see whether he would condemn her or what his reaction would be and you know it's something to me if you think about this as those men you know whatever had brought them to realize to catch her in that act of adultery adultery however that had occurred that took priority over every other responsibility over every other commitment over every other care they had for that day condemning her bringing her under condemnation was the number one priority that they faced so they drag her to the lord jesus to see what he'll say and he doesn't say anything at first he just kneels and begins writing in the sand and we don't know what he wrote but we do know that whatever he wrote it rearranged their priorities because all of a sudden they lost all interest in condemning her and something about his presence something about his person and something about whatever he was writing there in the sand all of a sudden made them uncomfortable and one by one they dropped their stones that they had intended to stone her and take her life with they dropped them and they left and as uncomfortable as his presence made them feel self-righteous people people who you know they as far as they were concerned everything was right with their lives but his presence made them uncomfortable but his presence never made her uncomfortable and she was the sinner she was the one that had been caught in the act oh my amen but as as his presence and and the things he wrote in the sand dismissed all of the accusers and all of the accusations then finally he he he stands up and he says woman where are thine accusers she said i have none lord oh my she was justified amen i have none lord isn't that a wonderful feeling when you know all the accusations and all the condemnation all the guilt and the shame and he said neither do i condemn thee and then he told her this go and sin no more now as a person if any one of these children this morning were to to walk out the doors of this tabernacle and begin running out into stone avenue you know i would call out or you would call out to the stop you know little boy little girl stop don't do that and you'd go and and grab them and take them and bring them back to safety and then you know you would talk to them and say look don't ever do that again don't run into the street like that you could be killed you could be injured uh you know that that there there's danger there but all you could hope to do as a person is is to appeal to something inside that child that from their fear or their respect for you they would have to value your words to the extent that any time they would ever be tempted to do that again they would remember what you told them and out of their own merit or their own appreciation for your desire it would change their desire but that's all we could hope for as a person but when jesus spoke his words weren't a commandment or weren't just a law or weren't they weren't spoken as human words hoping to appeal to some quality that was within her but his words were power when he said go and sin no more his words could give her the power to live a sinless life from that day forward because that's the power that his word has to the believer because there is a quality within you amen but it's not your own quality so much as it is representation that he placed there before the foundation of the world that when his word is spoken into your heart there's something there to grasp it and for that word to become power in your life amen to transform you into the reflection or into the image of his word amen so when he speaks amen and when his word strike the heart of faith or the heart of the believer amen its power to transform you and i from whatever we used to do and whatever we used to be and whatever the condition of our life was amen his word is taking the preeminence over all of that amen and becoming the dominant force you believe that this morning oh my and then in saint luke chapter 22 the lord spoke to peter he said simon simon behold satan hath desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat do you ever feel like your life is a battlefield of desires and not only satan's desires and god's desires but you know the desires of other people in your life your your parents your your companion your co-workers your leaders all of these things it seems like i know in my life sometimes it just seems like all of these influences all of these pulls all of people have all of these desires and many of them are are well-meaning and well-intentioned and and they are even for your benefit perhaps but god's desires amen that's what we want to prevail and to have the preeminence this morning and he's telling peter here satan hath desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat but i have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not i love that because he knew peter's confession would fail he knew peter's testimony would fail he knew peter would deny him and deny all association with him but he knew there was a quality within peter that would not fail and that was his faith amen even when his testimony even when his confession all of those other things were disintegrating his faith would remain i have prayed for thee that thy faith fell not and he didn't say if you're converted he said and when you are converted strengthen the brethren amen and jesus didn't only pray for peter but he also prayed for all that would come to believe him through their witness amen he prayed for you this morning and he prayed for me this morning amen and he knows there's a quality there's a faith in your heart amen that cannot be defeated amen and is going to prevail and is going to overcome despite all the pressures of laodicea despite all the persecution all the reproach you may face or bear everything your past amen his desires are going to prevail this morning amen he has that confidence god's got the same confidence in you that he had in peter you know i'm sure that peter didn't have any confidence in himself after all he had done it he was so determined he said lord i won't deny you i won't i won't deny i'll i'll stay right there with you but jesus told him you will and then peter did and he and he was out there on that boat and all of a sudden amen he heard that voice calling bread and fish upon the fire come and dying and he recognized jesus still has interest in me he still wants my fellowship he still wants my companionship he still wants my company and as soon as he was resurrected the angel told go tell his disciples and peter amen oh my doesn't matter what peter said doesn't matter that he denied him he's already made he's already seen an investment he's seen equality in peter and he's appealing to that quality amen he's inviting peter back oh my you know what peter needed peter needed pentecost peter needed the baptism of the holy ghost you know what that's what we need this morning it's it's wonderful to have the word of god it's wonderful to know the scriptures it's wonderful to know the message but if you don't have the dynamics to strike that mechanics your you can only go so far in good works you can only go so far in trying to live a christian life but when the holy spirit comes in amen it fills you with god's power and god's spirit and quickens that word in your life amen then it's not your goodness it's not your life it's not your works it's his power expressing itself through you amen he knew that peter and he said terry in jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high amen they had power to heal they had power to cast out devils they had power to perform miracles but he was going to give them power to live even power for his life to live through their lives and think about this on that day of pentecost when the world was watching as 120 came staggering out of the upper room think about what the world was thinking at that time these are men that can't do anything without jesus they were fishermen before they met jesus but after they met him they couldn't even catch fish without his instruction because they fished all night long and couldn't catch a single fish until he spoke to him and said cast your net on the other side anything they were before they met him became nothing when they met him and then when they met him they were nothing without him he gave him power to heal the sick and to cast out devils and then they came upon a demon-possessed person one day that even they couldn't heal until he came and healed them they were they were they were boatmen they were sailors before they met jesus but after they met him they couldn't sell from one side of the lake to the other except they had to wake him up they aren't anything without jesus and now he's been gone for 10 days and here they come out of the upper room we're going to see what these men are now and can i just say this morning he's back amen he told him it's expedient for you that i go away but he wasn't going away any longer amen he had returned in the form of the holy spirit and now he was living within them amen the same man who only days before had denied him when the pressure was applied when they said you're one of those you're one of his associates you're one of those disciples now they look at peter and say what meaneth this and that same man who denied him only days before said men and brethren these men aren't drunk as you suppose but this is that that was spoken by the prophet joel amen he began to take amen instead of being ashamed of his behavior instead of being ashamed of his conduct he took what was taking place right back to the scripture he said what you're seeing here what you're seeing in my life is what the prophet joel said it's not a prophecy any longer it's a reality glory to god even it's not words on the page any longer it's a reality in my life it's not just the words of the bible anymore it's living in me oh my repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost amen now there was something speaking from peter that he didn't he didn't apologize for he didn't back up on amen he was willing to bear the reproach and look the same power that accompanied the words of jesus we're now accompanying the words of peter when they went to the layman at the gate called beautiful he said silver and gold have i none but such as i have give i unto thee in the name of jesus christ of nazareth rise up and walk and the power of that word struck that man and he leaped to his feet and began dancing and rejoicing and praising god amen oh my can i say this morning he's back amen he's living in his church he's living in his people he's sent his word in this hour and it's been received into a body of believers into a heart of people and he's working he's moving he's living he's loving he's forgiving he's healing and he's saving amen through a body of redeemed men and women sons and daughters of god amen the only way you are saved is to know him by revelation if i can take i could take the presbyterian doctrine and tie you pentecostals till you won't know i can take the baptist doctrine and show you pentecostals a million things that you know nothing of that's right but that's not it that's not his church that's not his church his church is himself revealed think about that his church is himself revealed amen do you see it and expressed by the word itself that he is god amen i'm coming to a close this morning but the prophet of god also says the life in the body is a vindication of the rapture is at hand you see this preeminence is going to increase until the extent amen that it will one day change our bodies without having to go through the process of death you know i believe it i i don't have the quote but brother branham makes reference to when jesus turned the water into wine brother bam said that water would have eventually become wine would have had to come up and be drawn up by a grapevine and then manifest itself in a grape and then be squeezed and and and fermented all those things and to become wine and he said jesus just bypassed the process and he turned the water into wine amen and we should have to go through the process of death but he's going to bypass that process and change these vile bodies into the glorious image of his own body amen and a glorified condition will be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye amen why it's him having the preeminence oh my it's his word calling for a bride and bringing that bride into the perfect image of who he is amen he says god become from god to become me to take my sin upon him that he might make me him who's doing it he is he's the one doing it you're the object of it you're the result of it amen you're the product of it but it's him doing it so it's not even you amen it's you don't you're not taking the credit or the responsibility for it but he's doing it he might make me him amen back to his great purpose of sons and daughters of god amen i want to just take a moment as perhaps the musicians would come and just refer or take your mind back to when john was there in revelation chapter 5 and he began to weep because no man was found worthy and he realized all was lost if no one was worthy to come and take the book but then one of the elders said weep not john behold the lion of the tribe of judah hath prevailed to take the book and to loose the seals thereof and john said i turned he turned to see a lion but what he saw was a lamb a lion you know he's the king of the jungle he's a terrible creature every every other creature in the jungle even larger animals fear the roar of that lion but when john turned amen he didn't see a lion he saw a lamb and the lamb and the attributes of a lamb as a sacrifice and as an atonement and as a substitute those attributes became the preeminent qualities that became apparent to john when he looked because he was what that lamb died for and he was what that lamb bled for he was the reason that that lamb came and think about this brother and sister john was present in the life and ministry of jesus christ he was he was there at calvary he was one of the last remaining disciples that stayed at the foot of the cross as jesus bled as his lamb for this for his sins he witnessed the resurrection he witnessed the ascension but he never truly realized what it meant to him personally until he's carried over on the allopatmus and in revelations chapter 5 he sees that lamb come forth and prevail the lion of the tribe of judah had prevailed to take the book and to loose the seals thereof do you know that the same worthiness that was required to loose the seals was also required to look upon that book no man was found worthy to loose the seals nor to look thereon each required the same level of worthiness but when john recognized the worthiness of the lamb then he realized what that meant for him he was identified in that atonement he was identified in that lamb and the worthiness of that lamb made john worthy to see his name written in the lamb's book of life and say i'm redeemed i'm saved i'm one of his amen i may be facing persecution i may be here on this island amen as as the victim of persecution but i'm not a victim i'm a son of god i'm a child of god i'm a partaker of the nature of god and the life of god and all of the characteristics and all of the attributes of who he is amen i've been made a partaker in that and john began to rejoice amen he began to shout he began to worship worthy is the lamb amen oh my friend can we recognize his worthiness this morning can we recognize his righteousness can we recognize it's his desire amen that's that's prevailing this morning in our hearts and in our lives amen he's doing the work he started the work and he's going to complete the work this morning amen and as you stand to your feet as you stand to your feet this morning you may say brother tim i don't know why the lord would choose me i don't know why the lord would call me i don't even know why the lord would bring me to this service today but i will tell you this god doesn't make any bad choices and as unfit as unworthy as much of a failure as you may see
