right now in the name of Jesus Christ to you be all the glory and honor and praise in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you church we appreciate the songs that'll be it for the songs let's just turning our Bibles to um Deuteronomy the eth chapter Deuteronomy chapter 8 and then from there we're going to go to Romans n9ine Deuteronomy chapter 8 let's just start reading at verse one you have say amen mean the Bible says all the Commandments which I commanded thee this day shall ye observe to do that ye may live and multiply and go in and possess the land which the Lord swear unto your fathers and thou sh remember all the way which the Lord thy God LED thee these 40 years in the wilderness to Humble thee and to prove thee to know what was in thine heart whether thou wouldest keep his Commandments or no and he humbled thee and suffered thee to hunger and to feed thee with manner which thou knowest not neither did thy fathers know that he might make thee know that man do not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord doth Man live amen Romans 9 Romans 9 let's start reading at verse 9 it says for this is the Word of Promise at this time will I come and Sarah shall have a son and not only this but when Rebecca also had conceived by one even by Our Father Isaac for the children not being yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth it was said unto her the Elder Shall Serve the younger as it is written Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated amen may the Lord a BL blessing to the reading of his word you can have your seats amen by the grace of God tonight I want to encourage your hearts amen I I think like I said this morning I think sometimes we go through so much as a Believer as a Christian just trying to live with all the things going around us we forget that God has saved us we forget that God has made a way that he chose you before the foundation of the world and if we could just deal with that part for for a second amen my title today tonight is the omniscient God and we know you know through what was taught by a prophet the meaning of these words but have these words these titles these adjectives about God have they quickened to you because we say that he's omnipotent omnipotent means he's all powerful that mean that there's nothing you can go through that can defeat him Hallelujah there's no devil strong enough Hallelujah to put his hand on God and subdue God why because he's omnipotent Hallelujah and and and and and we we we Branch off of omnipotent to omnipresent meaning he's everywhere Hallelujah he he's he's here he's there while I'm preaching over here he's back home in Carolina dealing with Believers that need to be dealt with and the reason why he can be there is because he's omnicient Hallelujah he's all knowing being all knowing makes him omnipresent Hallelujah you know that's what the prophet of God said God being Hallelujah omnipresent Hallelujah he him being omniscient knowing all things makes him omnipresent Hallelujah so if we could just deal with that word today omnicient all knowing god now if I could say it like this church we serve a God that you can't add anything to and you can't take anything from him Hallelujah he is what he is hallelujah God hallelujah it doesn't matter what trial what tribulation you go through he doesn't have to receive some extra kind of knowledge to help your situation he's omniscient Hallelujah he knew about that situation before it ever arose and if I could say it like this he allowed it to happen because he knew what was going to come out of it that's that's the blessing behind the God we serve as believers we have to understand there's two things that God will never do first of all God cannot fail let's let's just let's just give that the proper understanding Hallelujah I don't know about your God but my God cannot fail H whatever he said he's more than able to fulfill whatever he promised it will come to pass why because he's omnicient there's nothing that can stand in his way that can stop God from fulfilling his promises in your life not a sickness Hallelujah you may get cancer but if God promis you the promised land cancer can't stop you Hallelujah why because he's omnicient he allows things to happen to make a better you out of you Hallelujah so we know God cannot fail Hallelujah second thing we must realize about God and His omnis if that's a word hallelujah God cannot lie Hallelujah church amen when you go into scripture and you see let's take scriptures that God has said about you he said I made you to have head and not the tail he can't take it back Hallelujah he's giving you a certain Authority so you have to believe it and operate in it Hallelujah see what we what happens to us we go through things and we think what we're going through is affecting God no God allows it so he can show you how great he is it's the law of contrast he said because he was a savior he allowed creation to get lost Hallelujah because he was a Healer he allowed sickness to come so he could demonstrate the attributes of healing he allowed men and women to get in bondage so he could show that he's a deliverer oh what an omnicient God we serve but things happen and we ask the question where is God he's with you all along he never gets distracted let me let's understand something you ever you you you ever watch those funny videos with those practical jokers they jump out and scare somebody like ah it doesn't matter what sin what mistake what indifference you could never catch God by surprise Satan can never catch God by surprise but you know those of us who are practical jokers we like to hide in a spot where we can't be seen and then we'll wait for a loved one to come that way and we'll jump out go boo and they go and then we have a memory of scaring them because that was something they wasn't prepared for it don't work like that with God he's always prepared for every trick of the Devil he's always prepared for every boo every a every R whatever he can do God is always is ready Hallelujah but I want to I want I really want to show you God is one of those people who reacts Hallelujah sometimes without thinking you know some people you can jump out on them and you don't get a ah you get a bam and that's how God is hallelujah Satan likes to try to jump out and boo God and God bams him God shows him he knew exact L what he was going to do where he was going to be when he was going to do it how he's going to do it why because he's God and what I'm saying tonight let's get this out of the way I'm about to close I want you to understand church where you are right now God is fully aware listen I want to read you something listen to this I want you to understand tonight everybody in here listening to the sound of my voice God planned it you didn't just hassly you know got up today and you say I think I'm going to church at 5 o'clock no what you're doing right now is you're reacting out the plan in God's mind see that ought to make a shout to realize I was in God's plan I was in God's mind Church your life doesn't belong to you Hallelujah each and every one of us our lives belong to a higher power Hallelujah there's something that dwells within us a spirit Hallelujah that's either going to produce good or going to produce evil Hallelujah but God knows who you are even at your birth Hallelujah but listen in this particular message he says your birth was pre was pre-planned he says I guess you believe that every one of you knows that our birth was pre-plan did you know that you being here never originated just at a myth or a thought it's not a coincidence that God allowed brother green to build this church why did he build it because God knew in jul in in November Hallelujah the 15th Day 2020 you are going to be here so you say wow God built this church for me just so I could be here to hear this message coming out of his mind oh my it makes me want to dance makes me want to shout makes me want to holler I'm sorry I took y'all back home for a second but Church listen God has things pre-planned he says did you know that you being here never originated just as a myth or a thought everything was all pre-planned by God before the foundation of the world that you're here the infinite God know to be infinite Hallelujah he had to know every flea that ever would be on the earth whoa now that's a powerful God I don't know how many of us have ever had dogs or cattle or whatever the case is and they get fleas you can't count the number of fleas on that animal why because they're too small but think about it if I got an animal with fleas he has an animal with fleas he has an animal she has an animal we all have animal with fleas the Bible say God knows the number of every flee that that's a powerful God he can count something that you cannot see with your natural ey oh my what a mighty God we serve oh we're so blessed to serve an omnicient God we sing a song He Knows My Name he knows my every thought listen he says the if the God knows to be infinite he had to know every Fleet that ever would be on the earth and how many listen man not only does he know every Fleet that's upon the face of the Earth the prophet of God says and every time it best it out [Applause] and you worried about your situation you worried about the little stuff you going through our God is so powerful he's so all knowing he's so great so wonderful Hallelujah he can count hallelujah how many times every flea upon the face of the Earth would bat its eyes we can't look at each other and count that it's time for us to put our God in the place he belongs and you know what that is above everything above your job above your trials above your Corona 19 18 17 whatever they want to call it above your political desires Hallelujah let's put God there amen Church my pastor said something the other day I was at church it was so profound you know as Believers we used to say we don't [Music] vote The Blood Hound is sniffing we used to say we don't vote because we believe God has everything under control but somewhere down there we're looking at things going on and we think our two sin is going to make a difference yes if I could just say it like this y'all thought this was a red state but all of a sudden it turned out to be blue it made some people very upset but you know what the omnition god already knew what was going to happen and look I'll say it like this so y'all don't Stone me I feel some of y'all got some rocks he must be a Democrat come we going we going to spiritually Stone him with mean mugs but look church when we realize God is in control all this other stuff around here doesn't matter that's right it's all going to work out for our good and I don't I don't know Biden or Trump and actually I'll be honest I hate to go on record and say this but I would love to have another four years of trump you know what now now I'm not saying that politically I'm saying that because I think he's the funniest President we ever had and I know I lost some of you there because you thought I was on your political bandwagon no I just think the man is hilarious and I love to hear him give a speech or give a talk because you notice every time he talks it has nothing to do with politics now you Trump you Trump fans are not going to admit that but I I just give you something I just look I'm G say this and I'm g go on I'll just give you a prime example of trump he they asked him about the crowds and getting the people to come out and they say Mr Trump you have the people coming out and they say what do you think Mr Biden is going to do he says you know well well you know we don't know about Joe Joe doesn't attract people he attract flies that that had nothing to do with politics but that's my man Trump the funniest president ever cuz you always say if you put a man like that who's always had what he wanted who's going to tell him what to do Hallelujah but to get back back to what I was saying we going to leave that alone we going to leave that alone cuz I know some of y'all still you ain't quite let that rock down yet Hallelujah but I'm neither democrat or republican I'm for Christ Hallelujah and listen why I'm for Christ my pastor made a statement you know you can just repeat things and you're going long with it because it sounds politically correct and you know we would say we don't vote because we believe that God you know uh has everything under control but the other day my pastor he be to break it down while he doesn't vote and he said you know why he says we know as the prophet said we ought to pray for our leaders he says but I don't vote he said you know why because I don't want to cast my vote preventure I'll be voting for what God doesn't want and I wonder how many people are going to the PO or to the ballots saying Lord I'm going to vote for who you want no we're voting for our desires but when you put it in God's hands you can't lose Hallelujah and we miss it church we miss it because we say we say hey look at the omnicient God we say oh God did so good with Reagan bless God oh he did so good with bush Senor he he he made Russia go bankrupt bless God we said oh Clinton Bush Jr Obama he's the devil yeah that's how we think but if raiken was God's choice so was Obama and so is Trump and so is Biden why because he has an agenda he has to get across according to prophecy Hallelujah Obama Hallelujah had to get in office so he could get a gaze all the rights that the Bible prophesied about you know he was the one to say okay we're going to let every state do what they want to do and he had to have Hallelujah he had to have Trump in there so Sodom and gomorra could come back in full force so what do we think think is going to happen with Biden more prophecy is going to be fulfilled Church don't get distracted the Antichrist is still what the prophet said it is the Catholic Church oh we forgot about that we forgot about which church on the land is priceless and holds the wealth of the world in his hand Hallelujah and what is Biden by religion oh you know that one huh don't get distracted don't live in this natural realm You Are Spiritual Beings God is in control he's all knowing see what what happens we start to thinking about what this pocket we start thinking about our pocket and how we going to live down here and we start looking for the best candidate according to our lifestyle let me tell you something it doesn't matter who get in there it can't stop my God from blessing me Hallelujah my blessings are not controlled by the offices of the president of the United States my blessing oh my I feel it getting kind of stiff brother Aaron W I feel it getting kind of stiff oh my I think I didn't hit a sore place but one thing y'all got to realize about me I was created to fight H fight demon powers fight unclean spirits that's what I was built for Hallelujah and church you ought to put your hope and trust in the Lord not in the systems of man because men will always fail and our God cannot fail [Applause] just in case some of you don't believe that by a show of hands listen to me good if God has ever failed you raise your hand nobody he's never failed nobody what a testimony that is amen he's a God that has kept his reputation he's a God hallelujah that has showed himself to be true Hallelujah that he can do all things H that all things are possible with Jesus Christ amen and we worried about a life build and the conditions of the economy Hallelujah I'm living in God's economy let me move on cuz some of you will say that brother purposely came out and beat us over the head because we lost no I'm on your side we all on the side of Christ he's in control Hallelujah listen I'm about to close and brother Aaron told me I had 15 more of them I was good with five but praise God hallelujah listen your life my life was pre-planned by God now look let's deal with the scripture text let's go back to Deuteronomy do y'all put the scriptures up on the board I mean up on the put the scriptures up there for me Deuteronomy chapter 8 so y'all know I'm a walker Hallelujah a walker and a talker but look it says all the Commandments which I commanded the this day shall ye observe to do that ye may live and multiply and go in and possess the land which ye which the Lord were H swear unto your fathers look the whole reason why God gave the Commandments was so they can go possess the promise the whole reason why God gave us a message Hallelujah from a Vindicated Prophet was so we could possess our inheritance it's not the first and fight with Baptist and Methodist and all these no it's so that we know what we originally possessed Hallelujah that's why you shouldn't waste your time debating hallelujah how many times did you see God debate never they come up to ask them questions and they say hey we caught this woman in adultery Jesus say come on Jesus speak tell us what happened he said if any of you be without see cast the first stone see you know what the word is supposed to do it's supposed to make you examine yourself it's not supposed to make you feel bigger than the person that you're in the presence of but it's supposed to make you examine yourself and thank God for his grace next verse and this is where we want to get he says and thou shall remember all the way which the Lord thy God LED Thee I thought the people got trapped in the wilderness because of their Disobedience the Bible says God LED them there the omnicient god think about these people muring and complaining and we oh Lord we had some good watermelon in Egypt these watermelon were so good they didn't even have no seeds in them oh we had food and we had this and they constantly complaining and God said he led them the way of the Wilderness these 40 years but we look at it we say see they were in the wilderness cuz they were disobedient no God LED them there it was a part of his plan what was he doing listen he says these 40 years in the wilderness to Humble thee see he knew that there was some people came out who thought they were something some people came out and say ah Moses was my prophet was our Prophet I was in his meetings and I was there and he healed my father and my mother and he touched me and he just God said you know what I'm going to lead you a direction where you can be humbled and he's been doing that all this time amongst the bride Hallelujah you wonder why so many things are taking place God has been humbling his church look he said to Humble thee and to prove to you oh my not only is he humbling us but he looking at the Devil he said watch this I don't know about y'all but I know I'm going through stuff Hallelujah and I don't feel like the devil is is in control but I feel like God has his hand on it and he's telling the devil watch what he does now he's not going to quit watch he go back home and pray watch he not only not this time not only gonna pray but he gonna cry too but he ain't going to give up he going to come back to church with a more Hallelujah fervent fire h w he's omnicient he knows exactly what to do to get us on our knees not only is he humbling us but he's proving thee why what is he doing to know what was in thine heart that's what this Co and all this stuff is all about God is humbling and he's proving and he's showing what's really in people's heart and we didn't had some of the toughest some of the strongest per se leave and quit and and I have nothing to get this but they sitting home right now streaming cuz they afraid to be around y'all you know what they did just now when I said that that's the power they have at home I can say things they might not like and they pause me n we we GNA [Music] fast they G to fast forward me some people gonna stop it all together say I'll come back when you finish dealing with that part but Church what's happening is he's showing Hallelujah not to the world but to you as an individual idual where you are you don't have to prove your life to nobody look at Moses Moses when it came time for him to wrestle with dayon and core what did he do he didn't fuss and fight he went back and he told me say hey now if something happened to them it ain't my fault what was he saying I know God got my back he told Moses hold your peace and let me fight your battle God allowed it so the people can see what a Vindicated Prophet is all about he did the same thing in our prophets Ministry listen let's keep going he says he says to prove thee to know what was in thine heart whether thou would is what keep this Commandments or no and now we have people say well I don't believe brother bandam is a prophet what evidence of that do you have I hope it's not just your opinion you have to show me something scripturally that says he's not Hallelujah Revelations 10:7 you have to show me something scripturally that God used another man Hallelujah greater than him I'm not saying that other men wasn't used cuz remember he doesn't have two prophets Hallelujah on the scene at the same time on only one now let's testify what the message is the omnicient god what is the message the message is Jesus [Music] Christ we say oh no the message is the books and tapes of brother Bram let me say it again Jesus Christ what was brother Bram preaching about Jesus Christ what's on the books in Jesus Christ so what is the message all aboutus Christ y'all ain't afraid to say that is you Hallelujah the message was not about William brandham he was a vessel that God used and God hallelujah used him just like he used John the Baptist to introduce himself and as long as there's a veil all you can see is what God did in a prophet's life but once that Veil is taken away you can see that it was Christ all along and until you get there you find yourself always defending yourself but the best way I testify this message is I tell what it did for me I don't talk about boino Canyon and sunset Mountain and oh my we got to go there and we got now I'm going to say this and it might offend some of y'all but you know what several years ago two friends of mine I came out here and they said hey you want to go to Sabino I was like yeah let's go let's go cuz you know you don't R about this stuff all your life and you're like yeah yeah yeah I want to go I'm excited yeah yeah yeah you know you hear people say oh man when I stepped on the mountain I felt the anointing so you know I'm like yeah yeah I want to go I want to fill the prop feel like I can't wait so we get there and it's around this time of year we get there and we're going up the mountain Hallelujah you know I'm thinking about all these all the things I've heard where people say that the anointing and the angel and you know and the sword in his hand and all these things and the more I'm going I'm going I think it's about 45 minute hike something like that might be a little less you know we're going up then the Sun comes out and we're going up I say hey give me some of that water I'm drinking the water we're going up then I got in my mind what the man at the trolley said look out for rattlesnakes so now I'm watching for rattlesnakes I'm hot I'm drinking some water and then I got to remember something else he said he said there also mountain lions so now I'm looking for I'm looking for uh I'm looking for rattlesnakes I'm looking for mountain lions now I'm going the same place the prophet went and I'm going up the mountain give me some more water mountain lions R snakes then the brother say we here I said where we at he said we here Eagle Rock this where the Prophet was I said ain't nothing on that rock my pictures got a eagle thing written across it am I right all right the omniscient God I'm saying this for a reason in church I get there and I'm thinking I'm there at the same spot the prophet was and I got all these things in my mind people say the anointing and all this and no doubt they may have felt something but as for me only thing I felt was tired and hot and a little agitated because I'm looking for rattlesnakes and mountain lions I didn't feel what the prophet felt and now he comes the devil he says oh he said look your picture doesn't have the same thing there's no writing on this rock there's nothing here I wonder is anything else true little little Southern young man from South Carolina believing this message so excited to walk in the places the prophet have walked but the omnicient god already already knew that was going to happen to me but right in that moment where the devil came in and he begin to serenate my ears he tried to tell me that all of it is faking none of it is real in those area in those times you have to be still and know that he's God and church in that moment I can remember standing there hallelujah look at the type the two brothers that tuck me up the mountain one was named Samuel a prophet the other one was named Israel a nation and you had me the bride Hallelujah and we were all there standing on the rock hallelujah and the devil is saying to me I wonder if anything else is real because the pictures you have doesn't resemble us and God Hallelujah in his sovereignty the all knowing god the omniscient God knew that that moment was going want to play out the way it played out and in the sweetness of his voice he says blessed is he who believe and have not seen Hallelujah glory and church I went back down that mountain just as much of a Believer as I was when I went up even though I didn't have the same experience the prophet had W that didn't change that this message was real or that God is real why because God spoke to me in my crucial moment why because he knew it was going to happen he's omniscient and from that day I stopped chasing relics I stopped trying to walk the walk the prophet walked but I begin to develop my own testimony with this word with this message because you may not you may fail to believe it but that's what the prophet wanted he wanted all of us to have our own personal relationship with Christ Hallelujah but look don't get nervous I'm about to close God is all knowing he led them to we the Wilderness and even when he got there he said you know what he said I'm going to harden Pharaoh's heart so that y'all leaving won't be easy why so I can show y'all how great I am think about it Moses will come and say Let My People Go Pharaoh said no I don't even know if there's a God I'm God and then God will do something create frauds and Pharaoh say okay I'm letting the people go then Moses come back he said no I ain't letting him go you know that made the people very uneasy and it made the people question whether Moses was called or not who was doing it God God was controlling the emotions of the people he's still doing it today you may think oh brother DS this is happening that is happening God is in control listen Church to the to the to the text at hand he said Sarah's going to have a towel and in in the proper time and season so is Rebecca and it says the two not even born yet not even doing good or evil Jacob have I loveed Esau have I hated now how could God love somebody and hate somebody before they even born because he knows what they're going to turn out to be he knows their desires and he didn't hate Esau as in you I can't stand you I hate your guts no he knew that his ways wasn't going to resemble the ways of Christ so that's what it means when he God says he hate that Hallelujah just like he loves the he loves The Sinner but he hates sin Hall he loves that person but he hates their actions that's what it means church but let's go into it why did he love Jacob and hate Esau according to the prophet Esau was a better man Esau he hunted and he he bought his daddy food and he was more of the man and Jacob was like a little sister boy sitting at home learning how to cook Hallelujah but you know that was a plan of God because something was going to arise where Jacob was going to have a dish that was going to be needed at a certain time of his life Hallelujah so one learned how to hunt and how to fish and the other one learned how to cook two twin boys hallelujah oh my church and then he gets to a place where Jacob Hallelujah he starts to have a desire for Esau's Birthright where did that come from God's prophecy the Elder will serve the young and them boys not even knowing what's happening to them what's happening they are playing out God's thoughts and don't even realize it they're getting in position Hallelujah to fulfill what God has said he's omniscient church and now Jacob h Esau go we know the story Esau goes hunting he comes back hungry and Jacob has made up a dish or whatever he tells Esau say Hey you hungry he said I got something for you and this right here hallelujah it doesn't even have any preservatives it's plant-based this right here make it feel real good plantbase and he saw was like oh yeah I want something he said oh oh oh oh oh before I give you something we got to make a deal give me your Birthright or better that sell me your Birthright for this food he says I don't care about no Birthright man I'm hungry what was that that was God getting his words in position Jacob have I loved Esau have I hated both nor doing good or evil in the womb of the mother but now they're playing out God's thoughts Hallelujah and now Church from there Esau has given the birthright to Jacob and Jacob is like hey I got to convince daddy now to lay his hands and bless me so Jacob gets anointed Hallelujah to lie to his daddy you mean to tell me it was the will of God for this boy to lie and deceive his daddy it was God's plan oh my you mean to tell me God will let a lie arise to get his plan across remember Hallelujah there was a prophecy that went forth about Ahab and Jezebel and and you know at that time or whatever and and God was saying what can I do to get this prophecy to come to pass and it says a Lyon Spirit came out of the pits of hell and said God use me he said I'll be a lying spirit in the mouth of the Prophet to prophesy to get Ahab in position to fulfill what the prophet said so things happen sometimes and we may look at it with a carnal eye but it's God fulfilling his word because he's all knowing and now Church from there Hallelujah Jacob goes and look now you think about this Jacob was considered to be a man of God huh when they quote the fathers h of History what do they say Abraham Isaac and who Jacob now I want you to picture this jacob goes and get some hair and put some sticky stuff on his arms puts it all over his arms all over us and you know God really his name wasn't Jacob it was Israel he was a prince but in that moment moment he was a Shyer God knew Hallelujah he had that trickery and Ling and all that stuff in him when he was born and he still used them my oh my we look at people and we say there'll never be nothing Church hold up be you know Peter he lied H he denied the Lord three times and the last time he cussed everybody out out now we if somebody do that in the church we be like Ser seed but let me tell you something before he got there he cut a man's ear off now I don't know about you I don't it's just it's just something about this atmosphere in this church where it just it's just so pleasant well I feel like I can preach for for hours but I know I can't hallah you guys have a good quality of the spirit here church can you can you can you can you just picture Hallelujah Jacob doing all that he did and tricking his brother Hallelujah to get in position for God's word to be fulfilled look at what he sacrificed he sacrificed his relationship with his brother he wasn't like some of us who grew up with our siblings Jacob didn't feel that he ran from his because his brother wanted to kill him he missed out on time with his father and his mother why because he was fulfilling God's thoughts Church you don't know what it means sometimes to sacrifice Hallelujah to live out God's will for your life and you look at Jacob see see don't miss my thought God already knew and he has a plan I'm about the cloth don't get nervous but church now Jacob he sacrificed his his childhood with his brother why because something inside was stirring to get a Birthright and now he done tricked his daddy and now he got to run his daddy looking at him old Shyer I should when I see him I'mma cut is behind nope he was gone running for his life didn't see his mama no went back down his mama guided him to go down to the Kendrick Hallelujah and when he got down there he fell in love with a girl named Rachel he looked at he was like you know how some of you young girls do you see that that tall dark handsome serpent I mean Adam and you be like oh he's hot be careful cuz you will meet your serpent before you meet your Adam and brothers you meet your Jezebel before you meet your Esther that's why you got to lay on your face before God and say Lord show me who's for me but anyway Here Comes Jacob Church H now he's running he he goes down hall now he's down at Layman house and he fell in love with Rachel and he says hey I work seven years we know the story he says hey I work seven years Hallelujah to marry her and Lay's like okay let's do it he worked seven years and he worked hard seven years and now hallu the wedding is [Music] happening she's in the veil Hallelujah everybody gets drunk have a good time partying and and just having such a good time and then he goes in the chamber he wakes up the next day and it's Leah he married the wrong sister he's like oh my God why didn't he say divorce why didn't he do it he couldn't she had already saw his secret Parts she already knew the mystery behind Jacob Hallelujah and for for her to be walking around knowing what his wife would know was not right so he had to keep her as a wife Hallelujah because she had already gone in the bed chamber so no matter what somebody else may say about you if Christ has taken you into the chamber he can't give you backen Hallelujah he can't give you back you belong to him no matter Jew or Gentile if he takes you in the chamber you are are his Hallelujah so now he says okay I'm going work another seven years just so I can get a he works another seven years and he gets a in church look at the omnicient god remember God told Abraham that there are nations inside of you there's a there's a there's a whole Hallelujah uh tribe of Israel inside of you Hallelujah where is it going to come forth look the omnicient God now Jacob Hallelujah he's married between he's married to two sisters one can get pregnant and the other one can't and Leah is popping them out like bubble bubbles she's having baby after baby and Rachel gets mad and she says you know what I'm going to give her my hands made and now Jacob is having babies by the handmade having babies by Leah and Leah gets mad she said you know what I'm going to give him my hands made and now he has her hands made he has Leah he has Rachel and her hands made now you got four women fighting over him look like total chaos doesn't it but out of all that what we would say foolishness came the tries of Israel it was the pl of God God knew that there was a reuin and a Simeon and Leah Hallelujah so he had to let Jacob marry her he knew that there was a Joseph Hallelujah and Benjamin in Rachel and the other boys in the handmaids so God allowed this stuff to happen why because he's all knowing Hallelujah church God allows things to take place Hallelujah to get his point across in my closing I could read a whole lot of other stuff but I think you get my point that God is in control and whether we want to believe it or not in times like this some of us he's humbling some of us he's proving some of us he's showing what's really in your heart but look we know Joseph Joseph was born and he was loved by his father amen he had all these other boys but Joseph was loved because he came out of a union of a woman that he really loved so that love poured over to his son and now his older brothers are looking at him and they're like man we hate your guts simply because he's loved by the father but that wasn't good enough that love had to turn hatred and I'll tell you how H he had a dream one day that everybody was going to his brother was going to bow down and him just being uh who he was gullible and green he went to his brother say hey y'all know what y'all gonna bow down to me one day and his brother's like let me get him and they're like no let me get him he's like I'm just telling y'all what God showed me and then he has another dream and he goes now his brothers can't stand his guts then he comes back with another dream he say hey Mom Dad y'all in this one y'all going to bow down too and his daddy rebukes him he like boy who you think you are you know his brothers can't stand his guts but that had to go from dislike to hatred so one day he his dad because he's in love with him he he makes him a coat of many colors and I'm GNA take some of y'all brothers back right quick he takes this coat and he puts this coat on not Hallelujah outside but in the midst of all his brothers and he takes this coat and he put it on and it's like he got on a Ric Flair robe [Music] I know some of y'all are afraid to laugh cuz you used to being serious all the time oh that brother he's cracking jokes and he's this and he's that hey why we can't come to church and have a good time this ain't your job this the house of God and God loves to see us smiling and enjoying the word listen church I do that stuff on purpose for the young people cuz they can see that we all in a bunch of old folus that we love what we talking about Hallelujah we love this gospel amen and you know the problem we've made we've made serving God a ritual and we wonder why our kids don't want to come to church because they're looking at you doing us doing Us in church every time you come for a whole hour and you're like come on son come on daughter give God some praise and they like I will if you will honestly they watching us why would they want something that we not happy about why would they want something that we don't express no Joy about they looking at us like you want me to serve your God and your church and you have no excitement man I'm going home and play my Xbox but church God allowed all that to happen you know why made his brothers go from disliking him to hating him why because there was a caravan coming there's a caravan coming and according to the promise of God the omnition god Jacob H Joseph belonged up there were Pharaoh Hallelujah so now he Hallelujah he gets thrown in the pit by his brothers his brothers throw him in the pit Hallelujah they sell him into slavery why because he's also a type of Christ Hallelujah we look at stuff we be like what's going on is God fulfilling his word hallelujah and now Church he's get in the Caravan then he finds himself at parer's house why part ofer's house because paa's wife has a lie to tell on him Hallelujah so he spends his time there and she's she's following him every day Joseph Joseph you know read your Bible it wasn't just one day she pressed him and pressed him and pressed him but that man had Integrity H and if you really watch God will let you go through trials to show the devil that's not really who you are he'll let you be tested by the things you've overcome and now Joseph is being tested by lust because there was no lust inside of him Hallelujah and God is proving a point he was being tested by a lie told on him why because he was honest he was being tested by his hatred of his brothers why because he loved them God is a god of contrast he testes you by the opposite of what you are and in our church parer's wife tells a lie Hallelujah that Joseph was trying to uh sleep with her and lie with her which was all a lie why because Joseph had to go to jail why because the Baker and Butler were coming God is all knowing he had everything set up Hallelujah and you know what Joseph didn't know what was going on this is the point I want to make Church his brothers PFA and his wife the Jailer all these people did him wrong and he didn't have a clue but from the time he was thrown in the pit the gift of God kept working in his life even though Hallelujah he wasn't in the best place that he wanted to be is still didn't stop him from being used by God what about us when we go through things we come to church mad and upset Hallelujah who's in control of your life God or the devil if it's God you ought to still be able to come here and worship and be happy the Bible says C count it all joy when you fall into D's Temptation now Church he's in jail he comes to bacon Butler and he tells them one what are you going to die what are you going to be restored Hallelujah and then one dies and the other one I mean both of them are called out one dies the other one restore you know what Jason say he said hey don't forget about me what do they do forget everything that he asked of others they didn't return to him but God continued to work in his life what was he doing he was building character because he had something way greater than he could experience in his father's house Hallelujah now Hallelujah Pharaoh has a dream and I believe it was the the the butler whichever one was restored he's restored and he says hey I remember my mistake there's a jail there's a man in your jail who can interpret dreams he said go get them go wash them up and bring them before me Hallelujah now look what's going to happen to Joseph he's going to get cleaned washed put in good clothes put a ring on his hand stand before the king listen Church your trials should put you in position where you're standing before the king Hallelujah but we're missing it you know why because all we can think about is the devil the devil look the devil at oh lord the devil the devil the devil some of you get down in prayer and you pray more about the devil than you do god oh lord the devil mess with my children oh lord the devil is oh lord the devil that and God telling there like I don't want to hear this foolishness Lift Me Up Lift Me Up in the time of adversity give me some praise allow me to work in your favor but you got to put me in position h you got to say oh God how great you are oh Lord there's none like you in all the Earth what a beautiful name it is what a wonderful name what a powerful name it is hallelujah church when you get down to pray you got to exalt him you don't go into prayer talking about his adversary now before I close take interprets the dream tells Pharaoh exactly what's going to happen why God knew he had it all planned to get Joseph where he was supposed to be Hallelujah then Pharaoh says hey the only thing is going to separate us is our seat but you going to run this whole country Hallelujah you going to run everything Hal so who was really the king Pharaoh or Joseph Joseph was Hallelujah GL Hallelujah oh my and church we know how the story plays out you know his brothers they come back and all these different things and now they don't even recognize who he is God I want you to understand something if you live right Hallelujah God will put every trial every situation back in your hands but the only way he'll do that is if you have the character look now he's running the whole country can you imagine how pfa's wife and PFA felt every time they saw Joseph coming Joseph prob was coming this way they say because she know she told a lie think about the Jailer the Jailer may have knock this food over or something Joseph come down there he and now all of his brothers Hallelujah they in his Pres and they start to LY daddy said don't kill us he didn't say that they're afraid one of my favorite scriptures and I say this about myself come on musicians I'm closing man it must be a Sunday night ain't nobody said brother keep preaching Hallelujah but Church think about it the prophet of God said power without character is what satanic so as you going through things Hallelujah God is trying to put you in position where you can have the character Hallelujah to fulfill the power of His word but without that character he'll never give it to you and now he put every everybody that ever did Joseph any wrong back in his hands Piper Piper's wife the jeller the baker the butler everybody all of his brothers everything's back in his hand and his brothers come back after after after uh their father die after Israel die they come back and they tell Joseph they say hey Joseph daddy said don't kill us now that he's departed they were lying he didn't have no conversation with them about that it was their own fears of what they did now rising up the haunt them you know what that's called condemnation of the heart that's why Christ said if your heart condemn you he said I'm greater than your heart and Joseph he says I believe he's in chapter 50 he tells his brothers he says hey they say they they they say daddy said don't kill us he says Hey fear not he says Fe not am I not in the place of God I want everybody to hear this and understand where you are right now is exactly where God wants you to be now how you go through it from here is how much you yield to God because one thing about God you can go easy way or you can go a hard way what do you mean a perfect will permissible will and one thing about the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is a bounty hunter with your picture he already knows who you are he already has the weapons to bring you and put you in submission but you know what a bounty hunter does when they find the person that that that that they're chasing they go to that person and they say hey Mr so and so sister so and so you could either come quietly or I can pistol whip you and drag you behind this horse but you going to come the thing of it is which one we want to do do we want to come God's perfect will or do we want to come his permissible will because he's all knowing he's he already knows what we're going to do Hallelujah so when things happen in your life and situations look tough and you might be saying Lord why am I going through this why am I that why this why that just remember he has it all under control and the faster we can realize that the quicker we can have peace with it we spend so much time condemning ourselves when God has given us a blood Covenant Hallelujah he's giv us a token where we ought to already be walking above that trial but we spend so much time oh the Devil May me do that Devil May me that the devil oh God I'm so sorry the devil made me this and the devil going to God say they lying on me they lying on me hey you know I can't do but what you allow me to do they lying on me I ain't did all that that's what the devil is doing he can only do what you allow him to do and better yet he can only do what God allows him to do that's the only Power he got and where does it start with the acceptance of your thoughts like I was saying earlier I was telling a testimony hallelujah look I'mma tell her I'mma tell a testimony that can touch home everybody all right got time for a quick testimony I hope this can touch home you know when all this Co stuff started back in March my mom is in her 70s she don't look at what she is she was taking some medicine and it made her dehydrated so she was trying to fight through it and fight through it and my mom is a woman of faith I'm here because of her you know we we we talk about all the things that we we hear and and we read about in the prophets uh Ministry I seen it firsthand in my mom's life she had visions and dreams on me tell me exactly what I'mma do before I do it young people imagine living with somebody like that when you not converted and you trying to go and do your own thing and have a good time and she be like all right I saw you do and I saw you like please but the more and more it be to happen the more and more I saw how real God is hallelujah one day church we was in the car this is this was around the same time I I was I was I was um released from the hospital from having cancer and you know God healed me and everything and we're riding in the car and and and she's riding through a parket lot and she's driving really slow I'm like why is she driving so slow and she's driving and they thing you know a car just back straight out sh and it like she was ready for it and she just hit the brakes and then she says Thank You Lord that was the car I was supposed to hit today and I'm like who are you church one night young people I tell this testimony for the glory of God because I want you to understand God is always watching you one time I you know by now I'm an adult you know I I went out with some friends and went to a cookout you know and because I was raised right I was green I ain't know things about cookouts I went there to eat you know had all this all these different let me say it like this all these different kind of beverages on the table so I'm I'm I'm looking at all this stuff and I never tasted this and tasted that so in my mind I'm saying hey I'mma just taste it I'm not going to indulge I'mma just taste it curiosity so I'm tasting this tasting that tasting this and tasting that not realizing what's going to happen to me you know what happened to me I'm tasting and I'm tasting and I'm tasting and I'm tasting by the time I finish tasting and I got so sick now the reason why I'm telling you this CU I want to show you your parents the power of your prayers church I got so sick to think about it me and my mom we always was tight even though I was living the life of a s Hallelujah she didn't treat me like it she treated me like I was still her son and that's where we mess up as parents we don't see our children living the life we want them to live and we excommunicate them how are they going to see the love of God if they don't fellowship with you Church Hallelujah so I called her I was like oh my me and my brother was staying together I like oh my I got so sick last night I went to a cookout and they had all this stuff on the table and I just wanted to taste it and I I just wanted to see what it was like and she was like yeah I know and she says I had a vision of you standing at that table and God showed me all of the beverages on that table and I said to God show him that drinking is not for him so the reason why I got sick was because God was answering her prayers now can you imagine you going through something hallu for in that magnitude because God is mindful of your prayers and from that moment I said i' never let that happen to me again what was happening God was answering her prayers Hallelujah so church I say I say that to say just to give you a little background on how I was raised young people hallu so now in this particular time she was uh uh the co and things happen and and she goes to the hospital well well first she was at home for maybe she said for about two weeks she was trying to fight it off praying and different things and so forth and my sister called me and say hey I'm taking Mama to the hospital I'm like you doing what she's like yeah I'm taking Mama to the hospital I said no don't take her to the hospital said too late I done dropped off I'm like cuz I'm like don't do nothing until we pray our God is real amen hallelujah we'll pray then go Hallelujah but we're not going to go and then be like oh we don't know what's going to happen if we pray we know what's going to happen God's going to deliver so anyway she drops mom off and and I'm like oh Lord why did you do that church when this first started it was a complete atmosphere of death they put people in a hospital room and they isolate them from all their loved ones from any kind of contact from from from any kind of Life they're in an atmosphere of Darkness now if you a if you ain't got God what else you going to do you're going to go crazy and you're going to start to believe what the people are saying but Church she gets there and they're saying hey uh uh um we got to test you for Co she said I ain't got it she said I come here for diarrhea I mean um dehydration and they said uh well what kind of symptoms you got she said well I can't eat no my food won't stay down this and that they said well we want to check for Co she said diarrhea I mean uh dehydration so they kept coming and they saying well you might have the co the 19 she said all I got is dehydration so they say okay well this what we GNA do we're gonna run some tests and this and that and blah blah blah and then we GNA see what happens so they run all their tests and they come back negative and then they found out how old she was was they she was putting her coat on F to go and they found out how old she was they said no we need to keep you and run some more test she said why all I have is dehydration they said well we want to check you for the co don't you let the devil make you believe in something that you don't have church she stays there she's in isolation but praise be to God she had a weapon Hallelujah she had a weapon and all that isolation you know what it was it's called a cell phone and she called me she said hey son how you doing I said I'm good I said where you she said I'm in the hospital said she man the people crazy they trying to make me say I got the co she said I ain't got no Co I come here for dehydration and that's what they GNA treat me for I said yeah Mom you know how it happened and we sit there we laughing and giggling having a good time on the phone she said okay well I'll talk to you tomorrow all right bye Church she stayed in there for couple days run test run test the nurse came in and she said hey ma'am I think you got it I think you got the co she said honey I came here for dehydration and that's what you GNA treat me for say well mother you know she try to get all sentiment well mother you know sometimes these things are hard to accept she said baby dehydration so they run some more test and run us and then they come up and they say well uh it don't seem like your your breathing is breathing right she say I'm breathing fine they trying to make her to accept something she said I'm breathing fine she well we want to run some more tests because I got experience with this let me tell you something when you go to the doctor and they say we don't see nothing but let us run some tests that's the devil waiting for you to accept him because he can't come in unless you accept him that's why the Bible says resist the devil and he does what he flees see I the devil don't like me because I tell all his Secrets Hallelujah now Church she's in there about a week maybe a week and a half they run all these tests and all these things and every time they come back she says dehydration they said well we think you got the co she says dehydration they said well we want to give you some of this and give you some of that she said is it for dehydration they said well we normally treat patients with Co she I don't want it give me something that's going to treat dehydration CU that's why I came in here you know when I had cancer in my brain you know they
