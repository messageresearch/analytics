[20:15] our brother Paul durksen and his wife
[20:18] sister Holly is that right did I get
[20:20] that
[20:20] [Music]
[20:21] right looks like that's what brother Dan
[20:24] wrote with visiting with us so God bless
[20:27] you good to have you
[20:32] now is with brother dawn your
[20:34] father okay I think it was around 1976
[20:38] 77 the first time he preached here at
[20:39] the Tabernacle and we ever just had just
[20:41] come to
[20:42] Tucson and then him and my father got to
[20:46] spend some time together cuz my dad had
[20:49] done a little bit of work for a family
[20:50] that was moving up to South Dakota and
[20:53] he gave him the message while he was
[20:55] talking to
[20:56] him um
[20:58] one the the little boy the little
[21:00] brother was was choking and the other
[21:02] brother dad said Daddy he got that glass
[21:04] what he thought was water was bleach and
[21:07] he had just drunk it and your dad and my
[21:09] father went and prayed for him and all
[21:11] the symptoms disappeared right then and
[21:13] there so the family's looking at and
[21:16] said well this God you serve is
[21:18] real now when he moved I don't know
[21:21] where where they went and I don't know
[21:22] the name but it was a testimony and it
[21:25] was it was your dad that was there
[21:26] praying for him so God is still the same
[21:29] yesterday today and forever amen he's so
[21:33] good to us let's look at um Joshua CH
[21:38] 24 vers 15 16 and
[21:43] 17 Joshua is saying here and if it seem
[21:46] evil unto you to serve the Lord choose
[21:48] ye this day whom you will serve it's
[21:51] whether the gods which your father
[21:53] served that were on the other side of
[21:55] the flood or the gods of the amorites in
[21:58] whose land you dwell but then Joshua
[22:00] says but as for me in my house we will
[22:03] serve the Lord and I like the answer
[22:06] here back from the congregation on verse
[22:09] verse 16 there and the people answered
[22:12] and said God forbid that we should
[22:14] forsake the Lord to serve other
[22:16] gods 17 for the Lord Is Our God he it is
[22:21] that brought us up and our fathers out
[22:24] of the land of Egypt from the house of
[22:25] bondage and which did those great Great
[22:28] Signs in our sides and preserved Us in
[22:31] all the way wherein we went and among
[22:33] all the people through whom we passed so
[22:36] I choose today to serve him we know him
[22:40] as our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen
[22:42] so we had no prayer requests that were
[22:46] were written or turned in but if you
[22:48] have something you would say Lord
[22:49] remember me I have a need I have a
[22:52] desire let's just bow our heads Lord we
[22:55] we come this evening Lord on a Wednesday

[23:02] through the day maybe at work or at home
[23:05] or traveling whatever it might be Lord
[23:06] but we're set the sight of time because
[23:09] you said where two or three are gathered
[23:10] in your name you'd be in the midst Lord
[23:13] so we're trusting in that you saw each
[23:15] hand that was raised Lord you know their
[23:17] hearts desire their need Lord so that

[37:23] came um from the US GE iCal survey and I
[37:27] had just got a new job at voice of God
[37:29] Recordings and Brother Joseph sent me
[37:32] and a group of us over to
[37:35] Zimbabwe and uh there I got to meet and
[37:38] spent some time with brother Paul Dirks
[37:40] and that was about
[37:42] 2006 I believe and uh I still remember
[37:46] that everything was going good and I was
[37:48] feeling great and we had like a youth
[37:52] meeting and and I got to talk a little
[37:53] bit to the youth and it's feeling good
[37:55] there's a maybe maybe a couple hundred
[37:57] and then we had
[37:59] meetings um I believe they were Friday
[38:01] Saturday and Sunday at the rainbow
[38:04] Towers in
[38:06] Harari and I was supposed to to speak
[38:10] and we walked into the
[38:13] auditorium and there were
[38:15] 8,000 people there I was like whoa and I
[38:20] was just on the job for two months
[38:22] brother Paul didn't seem bothered at it
[38:24] at all you you did a a great great job
[38:27] brother Paul would you mind coming up
[38:29] and saying a few words to the people
[38:31] brother Paul is a pastor in canisto and
[38:34] he's as I said he's a dear friend and
[38:37] he's somebody that he knows brother
[38:41] brandom's message like no one I've ever
[38:46] met and the brother knows he knows how
[38:49] to rightly divide the word there's a
[38:51] book that's required reading for most
[38:54] young people it's um courtship and
[38:57] dating marage marriage courtship and
[39:00] dating brother Paul is the one that put
[39:02] that together it's something that was
[39:04] sitting on my desk when I was in
[39:06] Jeffersonville all the time and I would
[39:08] always refer to it when we get questions
[39:11] about courtship and dating so brother
[39:13] Paul if you bless you my friend
[39:19] good well it is a privilege to be here
[39:22] brings back lots of good memories we uh
[39:25] first heard heard about the message in
[39:28] 1973 and we came down here to see what
[39:31] we could learn about brother brandom and
[39:34] we came down here and my goodness we
[39:36] found people that actually believed that
[39:38] there were prophets in the 20th century
[39:42] and we thought we were in a in a hot bed
[39:44] of of a cult or something and we wanted
[39:46] to get out of here but God had
[39:48] supernaturally led us here and my dad
[39:49] says no let's just stay and and see what
[39:52] we can learn here and we we went from
[39:54] here and we brought some tapes back home
[39:56] and started listening to them and God
[39:58] moved and we had a group of about 75
[40:01] young people they all embraced the
[40:03] message and from that day on just a
[40:05] couple years later my dad was pastoring
[40:07] that's when he would have been down here
[40:09] 7677 we'd come to the meetings every
[40:11] year brother Perry would have it for
[40:13] quite a few years so I have memories of
[40:16] this as a young man and and it's good to
[40:18] be here and I have memories with brother
[40:20] Dan as well just uh we made a point when
[40:23] we'd go to to uh Jeffersonville there to
[40:25] uh the vgr offices to to just stop in
[40:29] and see brother Dan I've always
[40:30] appreciated that genuine Christian love
[40:33] and warmth that I felt there and we just
[40:35] had good Fellowship all the time and it
[40:37] was a real privilege and so we've had
[40:39] chances even now that he's left the vgr
[40:41] and his is over here we've had time too
[40:44] that we get together and can just really
[40:46] just Fellowship around the word and with
[40:48] the Lord and we're thankful for that so
[40:50] we wanted to make sure we had a chance
[40:52] to stop in and just to see how things
[40:54] were going and I know he's just been
[40:56] been here a little while the church has
[40:57] kind of had some changes the last couple
[40:59] years and so I thought we'd just stop in
[41:01] and just put our shoulder to the wheel
[41:02] and and bring our lick a little lick of
[41:05] fire and and put it with yours and just
[41:07] see if the Lord would move what's on my
[41:11] heart as a pastor and as we see things
[41:13] going you look at what's taking place in
[41:15] the world right now yes Amen to it it's
[41:19] it's beyond comprehension amen the
[41:22] anti-Semitism that is all of a sudden
[41:24] exploded around the world there is no
[41:26] logical explanation for that that is
[41:29] demonic and I believe that it is the the
[41:32] things that the scriptures the thing
[41:33] that the message talked to us about and
[41:35] told us and prophesied it is fixing to
[41:38] happen we are in the process of it now
[41:41] and I believe that it is lamp trimming
[41:43] time for us I believe that it's time
[41:46] that we need to check up and make sure
[41:48] that there is nothing because things
[41:49] could be different in the
[41:51] morning and we need to be ready
[41:53] constantly and so just don't let
[41:55] anything
[41:56] keep our take our eyes away from the
[41:58] things of the Lord and and to for his
[42:00] soon coming and we want to just be about
[42:03] our father's business I've been
[42:06] emphasizing when I have U been speaking
[42:09] for the last two years and it just keeps
[42:11] coming up and coming up but from
[42:13] Ephesians 4 where he says endeavoring to
[42:17] keep the unity of the spirit that is the
[42:21] vocation wherewith we've been called
[42:24] that is our vocation what's a vocation
[42:26] well it's could be our career what we do
[42:28] for our job our life our living could be
[42:30] a farmer could be an engineer that would
[42:32] be our our vocation in the natural but
[42:35] as Christians our vocation is to be a a
[42:38] an example and an ambassador of the Lord
[42:40] Jesus Christ and he says to walk worthy
[42:44] of the vocation which we've been called
[42:46] it has to do he says with meekness with
[42:49] humility with longsuffering forbearing
[42:52] one another in love endeavoring to keep
[42:54] the unity of the spirit and I just want
[42:56] to leave this thought with you we have a
[42:59] Unity of the
[43:01] spirit I I like to do this I I'll ask
[43:03] brother Dan have have you maintained
[43:05] your U 200 foot yacht this this year yet
[43:09] no cuz he doesn't have one you can't
[43:12] maintain something that you don't have
[43:15] we have the unity to spirit because
[43:17] we've been born of the same spirit and
[43:20] therefore we have our part to do to
[43:22] maintain it and that takes humility
[43:24] death to self longsuffering forbearing
[43:27] one another and patience and so I
[43:30] believe that that's more important than
[43:32] ever we are in the closing
[43:35] hours days of time let's make sure we
[43:38] have our eyes on the prize have our
[43:41] heart right with the Lord and so the
[43:44] Lord bless you as we come into His
[43:45] presence tonight I'm looking forward to
[43:47] what the Lord would use our brother Dan
[43:48] to bring God bless
[43:49] [Applause]
[43:55] you
[43:58] one thing about brother Paul and uh and
[44:02] our conversations that we've had over
[44:03] the past few years is we are
[44:09] both exactly we see things exactly eye
[44:13] to eye on what brother Paul just said
[44:16] and I think that so often in in the past
[44:18] we've we've had different doctrines and
[44:20] we've had these wonderful Revelations
[44:23] that have come forward and they're
[44:25] they're
[44:26] but when a
[44:28] revelation separates the body of Christ
[44:32] it doesn't do us any good and I look at
[44:35] brother Paul and brother Paul is a
[44:37] master teacher he hopefully brother Paul
[44:39] you can preach for us sometime soon it
[44:43] would it would be a great honor to hear
[44:45] this brother I've heard him many times
[44:47] to hear him break down the word of God
[44:51] and brother Paul sees that the thing
[44:55] that is
[44:57] missing is a Unity of the Gospel as I've
[45:01] preached many times from this Pulpit
[45:03] that Jesus said that he would know us by
[45:08] our love for one another and not even
[45:10] that not so not even more than that that
[45:15] the world would see that Jesus Christ is
[45:21] the Messiah because of the love that the
[45:24] disciples have for each other the world
[45:27] hasn't seen that yet but it will see it
[45:30] and I want to be part brother Paul I
[45:32] want to be part of that Unity of the
[45:34] gospel and we are moving in that
[45:36] direction like you said it's there we
[45:39] just have to it has to come together we
[45:41] have to do our part each person each
[45:44] person whether it be husband and a wife
[45:48] whether it be a brother and sister
[45:49] whether it be friends we have to do our
[45:52] part and if everyone starts doing their
[45:54] parts
[45:56] then the Lord will come I really believe
[45:59] that with all my heart I appreciate
[46:01] brother Paul and his stand and brother
[46:04] Paul it's not always so easy to make us
[46:08] stand for Unity you think if we're
[46:09] standing for Unity that oh everybody's
[46:12] going to love us it's not like that is
[46:13] it brother Paul no it's not Unity
[46:17] requires
[46:19] leadership brother Paul is one that I've
[46:21] have seen he provides leadership for his
[46:25] group there and if uh he'll be speaking
[46:29] I assume at brother po this weekend
[46:32] let's make sure friends that we go and
[46:34] hear Brother Paul speak I think it would
[46:36] do all of us a lot of good and I sent
[46:39] out WhatsApp this
[46:41] morning that uh brother Israel's um
[46:44] services at Shalom Tabernacle Friday
[46:46] night Friday night at 7 Saturday night
[46:49] at 6 and then Sunday morning at 10:
[46:52] Sunday afternoon at 5: so please let's
[46:55] let let's go over there and and I know
[46:58] that uh brother Pro is a tremendous
[47:00] speaker and um I know that whoever is
[47:02] going to be speaking it'll be a blessing
[47:04] but um I think he's my
[47:08] favorite um God bless you all it's it's
[47:11] important brother Paul what we've been
[47:13] doing over the past about nine months is
[47:15] on Wednesday night I wanted to do a
[47:19] Bible study and we started with the book
[47:22] of Acts and we went chapter by chapter
[47:25] verse by verse word by word all the way
[47:30] through I believe there's 28 chapters in
[47:32] the book of Acts we started with chapter
[47:34] one and we went we went all the way
[47:36] through and we finished it we did a
[47:38] couple Recaps and in praying about it I
[47:41] thought that it please the Lord in doing
[47:43] that and and in moving the church
[47:47] forward thought Lord what would be the
[47:50] best thing that we can do first of all
[47:54] as as I said last last time I ministered
[47:56] I I said that the word is a lamp into
[47:59] our feet and it doesn't light the way
[48:02] all the way down to the end of the trail
[48:05] it just lights our next step so what
[48:09] that means is always be ready to change
[48:11] directions as we're learning so what I
[48:14] feel to do is we're going to start in
[48:17] Genesis and we are going to learn every
[48:21] single book in the Bible now we're going
[48:23] to do this we're not going to drill down
[48:25] too far we're just going to kind of fly
[48:27] over and and as as something that uh is
[48:32] a highlight we can telescope down in on
[48:36] that point but I want this church to
[48:39] learn our
[48:42] Bibles I wanted to I want you to learn
[48:45] what is Genesis Genesis is obviously
[48:47] means the beginning what is it what does
[48:50] that word mean what is what is the book
[48:52] about I me we all know Adam and Eve are
[48:55] in there but but there's a lot of others
[48:57] there's Enoch is in there there's
[48:58] Methuselah that I'll talk about today
[49:01] there's all the way there's Abraham
[49:03] Isaac Jacob Joseph it's it's a beautiful
[49:07] book and it starts The Narrative of the
[49:11] Bible brother brandom said that the
[49:13] devil hates two books in this Bible the
[49:17] most he hates the Book of
[49:20] Genesis at the beginning and he hates
[49:22] the Book of Revelation at the end
[49:24] because it exposes those two books more
[49:27] than any other book in the whole Bible
[49:29] those two books expose the devil more
[49:32] than any other because the Book of
[49:34] Genesis Genesis shows where he
[49:36] began and the Book of Revelation shows
[49:39] where he
[49:40] ends and if the Lord carries we're going
[49:43] to get all the way through but again
[49:46] this light we may change directions the
[49:48] Lord may lead us in another Direction
[49:50] but tonight we'll start with the Book of
[49:54] Genesis so let's turn in our Bibles this
[49:57] is an easy one to
[50:00] find
[50:02] Genesis chapter
[50:04] one now Genesis has two distinct
[50:09] different parts it has basically how
[50:13] everything got started and how
[50:15] everything got
[50:17] ruined at the beginning the first 11
[50:20] chapters and then from 12 to 50 it talks
[50:25] about about pretty much one man in his
[50:27] family and that man's name is Abraham
[50:31] and the rest of the book goes from from
[50:35] 12 to 50 talks about this man family
[50:38] this man Abraham's family so what I'm
[50:40] going to do is I'm going to try to get
[50:43] all the way to chapter I'll try to get
[50:45] all the way to Abraham maybe dig into a
[50:47] little bit of Abraham and then I'm gonna
[50:49] pass it over to brother Lyall next week
[50:52] and brother ly will bring us from
[50:54] Abraham all the way way to Joseph next
[50:57] next week so if the Lord's willing
[50:59] that's what we're going to try to do
[51:01] tonight Genesis chapter 1 verse one says
[51:04] this in the beginning God created the
[51:08] Heaven and the
[51:09] Earth that scripture right there friends
[51:12] is probably the hardest thing for anyone
[51:17] who wants to serve the Lord to
[51:21] accept is that all of this it's proba
[51:25] the hardest step to take in our walk
[51:28] with the Lord for all of this that we're
[51:31] in we look up at the stars and we say
[51:35] that yes God created those Stars we look
[51:37] down at the ground we say that yeah God
[51:40] created the Earth he created the heavens
[51:43] and the Earth and he is
[51:45] able to do anything and that's the thing
[51:49] that's hardest for for any man or woman
[51:52] to believe that he is able he's able to
[51:56] accomplish anything that he sets his
[51:59] mind
[52:01] to in the beginning God created the
[52:03] Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was
[52:06] without form and void and darkness was
[52:10] upon the face of the deep and the spirit
[52:13] of God moved upon the face of the waters
[52:17] here just in the very second
[52:21] sentence of the book we have excuse me
[52:26] the godhead being explained we have in
[52:29] the beginning God the father created the
[52:32] heavens and the Earth and then this was
[52:35] all without form and it was void and
[52:37] there was chaos and and all of this that
[52:39] was created had no order to it but we
[52:42] see now the holy spirit moves on the
[52:46] scene and upon the face of the waters
[52:49] and it starts setting things in
[52:52] order and I think about
[52:56] excuse me how the holy spirit in a
[53:00] Christian God created all of us he loves
[53:04] us and and he placed us on this Earth
[53:07] and then we get so worked up in society
[53:10] we get so worked up with problems and
[53:13] our families and and everything that's
[53:15] going on and we forget that that Holy
[53:18] Spirit is sent to set everything in
[53:22] order when you receive that Holy Spirit
[53:25] you are set aside to service of our Lord
[53:30] and in the church and here right here
[53:33] right at the very beginning of the
[53:35] Bible we see this Holy Spirit start to
[53:39] set things in order in the
[53:44] world I mean if God can take a hydrogen
[53:46] atom and add a proton and a neutron and
[53:49] a electron to it make a helium atom and
[53:51] then you can take a helium atom and make
[53:53] another atom over here and all the way
[53:55] way to carbon and oxygen and all this
[53:57] and then put them all together and make
[53:59] water with a couple hydrogens and a and
[54:01] an oxygen and then put some carbon in
[54:03] there and make and make a a amino acid
[54:06] or whatever it is and all the way to to
[54:08] higher forms of life if he can do that
[54:11] certainly he can straighten out our
[54:13] lives if they get messed
[54:15] up and God said I love this
[54:19] part and God said let there be light and
[54:23] there was light and God saw the light
[54:26] that it was good and God divided the
[54:29] light from the darkness and God called
[54:32] the light day in the darkness he called
[54:35] night in the evening and the morning
[54:38] were the first day so on the second
[54:42] day God creates the sky and the
[54:45] atmosphere and he separates the liquid
[54:47] water from the water vapor and on the
[54:49] third day God creates the dry land
[54:53] separates the sea from the land creates
[54:55] plant life and grasses and trees and day
[54:59] four the celestial bodies are formed he
[55:03] creates all the stars and the heavenly
[55:05] bodies and it's so beautiful because he
[55:09] says that man can even tell what time it
[55:12] is by these celestial bodies that are in
[55:15] the
[55:16] sky and
[55:21] then on day on day five he creates the
[55:25] life that lives in the water and the
[55:26] fish and the whales and and he creates
[55:28] the birds and the insects and then on
[55:30] six on day six he creates the animals
[55:34] that are on dry ground and every other
[55:36] animal that wasn't created yet on day
[55:38] five and let's skip to verse 26 here I
[55:41] summarized that for time
[55:43] sake and God said let us make man in our
[55:48] image after our likeness and let them
[55:52] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[55:54] and over the fowl of the air and over
[55:56] the cattle and over the all the Earth
[55:58] and over every creeping thing that
[56:00] creepeth upon the Earth so God created
[56:03] man in his own image in the image of God
[56:06] created he him male and female created
[56:08] he them notice he mentioned
[56:11] twice that God created Mankind in his
[56:14] own image and many of the times when I'm
[56:18] ministering and I'm talking about
[56:21] communion I talk about how if God if we
[56:25] are made in God's
[56:28] image and we want Fellowship as a father
[56:34] with my son Daniel my daughter meline my
[56:38] wife how I would like I like to be
[56:40] around I like to have fellowship with
[56:43] them and if we are made in God's image
[56:46] do you think maybe God would like to
[56:47] have fellowship with
[56:49] us and how we should spend in time with
[56:52] in prayer in the father
[56:55] talking to him and fellowshipping
[56:58] fellowshipping with him and speaking to
[57:01] him and and not always asking him Lord
[57:03] please bless my food and Lord please
[57:05] bless this and please bless that and
[57:07] help me out of this problem and that
[57:08] problem but how about sometimes saying
[57:10] Lord I love
[57:11] you and here is God as he
[57:15] created this
[57:17] man for
[57:19] fellowship with
[57:23] himself God created man in his own image
[57:26] in the image of God created he him male
[57:28] and female created he
[57:32] them remember God said remember Jesus
[57:35] said in John 4
[57:37] 4:24 he says God is the spirit and they
[57:41] that worship Him must Worship in spirit
[57:43] and in truth so this first creation
[57:45] you'll see in the Book of Genesis here
[57:47] there's two this first creation here is
[57:52] in God's Own image which is a
[57:56] spirit because God as Jesus said is a
[57:59] spirit and God blessed them and God said
[58:02] un them be fruitful and multiply and
[58:04] replenish the Earth and subdue it and
[58:06] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[58:08] and over the fowl of the air and over
[58:10] every living thing that moveth upon the
[58:12] Earth and God said behold I have given
[58:14] you every herb bearing seed which is
[58:17] upon the face of the Earth and every
[58:18] tree in the which is the fruit of the
[58:22] tree yielding seed to you it shall be
[58:24] for me
[58:25] meat and to every beast of the earth and
[58:27] to every fowl of the air and to
[58:29] everything that creepeth upon the Earth
[58:31] wherein there is life I have given every
[58:34] green herb for meat and it was so and
[58:37] God saw everything that he had made and
[58:40] behold it was very good in the evening
[58:45] and the morning were the sixth day
[58:48] notice as you read this when you go back
[58:51] and you read it God keeps saying and it
[58:54] was good and it was good and it was
[58:58] good Genesis chapter 2 verse one thus
[59:02] the heavens and the Earth were finished
[59:04] and all the host of them and on the
[59:06] seventh day God ended his work which he
[59:08] had made and he rested on the seventh
[59:11] day from all his work which he had made
[59:13] and God blessed the seventh day and
[59:15] sanctify it because that in it he had
[59:17] rested from all his work which God had
[59:19] created and made these are the
[59:21] generations of heavens of the heavens
[59:23] and the Earth where they were created in
[59:25] the day that God had made the earth and
[59:28] the heavens every plant of the field
[59:30] before it was in the earth and every
[59:32] herb of the field before it grew for God
[59:35] for the Lord God had not caused it to
[59:37] rain upon the Earth and there was not a
[59:39] man to till the
[59:41] ground but there went
[59:43] up a mist from the earth and watered the
[59:47] whole face of the ground and the Lord
[59:50] God formed Man Out of the Dust of the
[59:53] ground and breathed breathed into his
[59:55] nostrils the breath of life and Man
[59:57] became a living soul and the Lord God
[1:00:01] planted a garden Eastward in the in Eden
[1:00:05] and there he put the man whom he had
[1:00:11] formed let's ver let's skip
[1:00:14] down to verse 17 then he God gives Adam
[1:00:20] this man he gives him all of this
[1:00:22] creation this beautiful garden
[1:00:25] that he had
[1:00:26] planted and he says it's
[1:00:29] yours and he said of every tree on I'm
[1:00:33] sorry in verse 16 and the Lord God
[1:00:35] commanded the man saying of every tree
[1:00:37] of the garden thou May free thou mayest
[1:00:39] freely eat but of the tree of knowledge
[1:00:41] of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of
[1:00:43] it for in the day that thou eatest
[1:00:46] thereof Thou shalt surely die right now
[1:00:50] God is right
[1:00:51] here God is giving mankind a choice
[1:00:56] we always have a choice and our choice
[1:00:58] is always whether are we going to sin or
[1:00:59] are we not going to sin we have a choice
[1:01:01] and we can do
[1:01:03] either we can turn against God and to
[1:01:07] turn against God is to embrace
[1:01:11] death but to make that decision that we
[1:01:15] love God and to do what he says is to
[1:01:17] embrace god notice that the tree of
[1:01:20] knowledge of Good and Evil it had both
[1:01:23] in the tree
[1:01:25] so there's good and there's evil there
[1:01:27] and you see that that he says stay away
[1:01:30] from that he says he says don't eat of
[1:01:32] that fruit even though that there's good
[1:01:35] there because he he doesn't want
[1:01:40] us to have the attitude of I can make my
[1:01:43] own
[1:01:44] decision I can do it
[1:01:46] myself you know it's good and evil I'll
[1:01:48] just pick good but no God says no stay
[1:01:51] away from
[1:01:53] that and the warning but Paul this is
[1:01:57] beautiful this warning is in perfect
[1:01:59] context because it tells us what this
[1:02:02] tree of knowledge of Good and Evil
[1:02:06] is the very next
[1:02:10] verse and the Lord God
[1:02:13] said it is not good that man that the
[1:02:17] man should be
[1:02:19] alone I will make him a helpmate a
[1:02:22] helpmate for him so right here he's
[1:02:25] saying touch this don't go in this
[1:02:28] direction he doesn't say don't touch it
[1:02:30] there but he says don't eat of this
[1:02:32] fruit and then right afterwards he says
[1:02:36] Ah it's not good that man's alone I need
[1:02:40] to make him a mate I need to make him a
[1:02:43] wife and out of the
[1:02:45] ground the Lord God formed every beast
[1:02:49] of the field let's skip to verse 21 and
[1:02:51] the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall
[1:02:54] upon Adam and he slept and he took one
[1:02:57] of his ribs and closed up the flesh
[1:02:59] instead thereof and the rib which the
[1:03:02] Lord God had taken from the man made he
[1:03:04] a woman and brought her under the man
[1:03:07] and Adam said this is now bone of my
[1:03:09] bones and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be
[1:03:12] called woman because she was taken out
[1:03:14] of the man therefore shall man leave his
[1:03:17] father and mother and shall cleave unto
[1:03:20] his wife and they shall be one flesh
[1:03:22] this is the first marriage that was ever
[1:03:25] performed and God performed it right
[1:03:27] here notice he said cleave unto his wife
[1:03:31] so this man Adam and this woman eve were
[1:03:36] married and they were both naked the man
[1:03:40] and his wife and were not ashamed that
[1:03:43] verse 25 is important it's foreshadowing
[1:03:47] of something very important that will
[1:03:48] come to play into play just here in a
[1:03:50] little
[1:03:53] bit
[1:03:55] now so Adam and Eve they're in this
[1:03:59] beautiful garden everything is going
[1:04:01] well they have they have dominion over
[1:04:04] everything and they're eating of the
[1:04:07] fruits of the trees and they're enjoying
[1:04:09] in Adam's naming all the animals and and
[1:04:12] things are going well and then we see
[1:04:15] something come in right here verse
[1:04:18] chapter
[1:04:20] 3:1 now the serpent was more subtle than
[1:04:23] any east of the field of which the Lord
[1:04:26] God had made and he saith unto the woman
[1:04:28] y hath God said ye shall not eat of
[1:04:31] every tree of the
[1:04:33] garden and the woman said unto the
[1:04:35] serpent we may eat of every fruit we may
[1:04:38] eat of the fruit of the Trees of the
[1:04:39] garden but the fruit of the tree which
[1:04:43] is in the midst of the garden God has
[1:04:45] said ye shall not eat of it neither
[1:04:48] shall ye touch it lest you die now do
[1:04:52] you remember before just before Eve was
[1:04:57] born just before Eve was formed God
[1:05:01] spoke to Adam and he said don't eat of
[1:05:05] the fruit of this
[1:05:09] tree not Eve he tells Adam this and then
[1:05:13] God forms Eve so here Eve is saying
[1:05:17] listen God
[1:05:19] said that ye shall not eat of it neither
[1:05:24] shall you touch it so I assume that this
[1:05:28] was her husband telling Eve because this
[1:05:32] was told to Adam before Eve was born
[1:05:34] before Eve was formed that Adam said
[1:05:38] listen God said don't God said don't eat
[1:05:41] of it and he said don't you even touch
[1:05:43] it he said stay away from this warning
[1:05:49] his
[1:05:51] wife and the serpent said unto to the
[1:05:54] woman remember she said that we're going
[1:05:58] to die if we eat if we do this thing now
[1:06:02] here is the Serpent's
[1:06:05] Seed this is how the serpent
[1:06:10] acts and the serpent said unto the woman
[1:06:13] you shall not surely
[1:06:14] die exactly what God Said No God said
[1:06:19] don't do it and he said it's not that
[1:06:22] bad I know the word says
[1:06:25] this but it's not God didn't mean it
[1:06:29] like
[1:06:30] that here is how the serpent gets in and
[1:06:34] he gets his claws into the people and
[1:06:38] it's when you know the word says
[1:06:40] something and then you go and you do
[1:06:43] something through the councel could be
[1:06:47] of a pastor it could be of a friend it
[1:06:50] could be your own
[1:06:52] desires but you do something that the
[1:06:55] word
[1:06:56] prevents uh prohibits you from
[1:06:59] doing for God doth know that in the day
[1:07:02] that this is the serpent
[1:07:04] talking for God doth know and he's not a
[1:07:07] snake by the way snakes don't talk it's
[1:07:10] a uh this is a man this is someone that
[1:07:14] that is talking to Eve and reasoning
[1:07:16] with Eve in fact he's even more Sly than
[1:07:21] a man is so this is this is for all
[1:07:24] intents and purposes this is a man
[1:07:26] speaking to
[1:07:29] Eve for God doth know that in the day
[1:07:32] that you eat thereof then your eyes
[1:07:34] shall be opened and you shall be as Gods
[1:07:37] knowing good and
[1:07:40] evil and when the woman saw that the
[1:07:43] tree was good for food that it was
[1:07:45] pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be
[1:07:47] desired to make one wise she took of the
[1:07:49] fruit thereof and did eat and gave unto
[1:07:52] her husband also with her and and he did
[1:07:54] eat and the eyes of both of them were
[1:07:56] opened and they knew they were
[1:08:00] naked so they knew so whatever happened
[1:08:03] between this
[1:08:05] man The
[1:08:08] Serpent and this woman Eve and then to
[1:08:11] her husband it caused them to cover
[1:08:14] certain parts of their body very strange
[1:08:18] result from
[1:08:21] eating metaphorically of fruit
[1:08:30] and they heard the voice of the Lord God
[1:08:32] Walking In The Garden in the cool of the
[1:08:34] day and Adam and his wife hid themselves
[1:08:36] from the presence of the Lord amongst
[1:08:38] the Trees of the garden and the Lord
[1:08:40] called and the Lord God called unto Adam
[1:08:42] and said Where Art Thou and he said I
[1:08:45] heard thy voice in the garden and I was
[1:08:46] afraid because I was naked and I hid
[1:08:48] myself and he said who told you who told
[1:08:51] thee that thou was naked God immediately
[1:08:55] knew what they had done hast thou eaten
[1:08:57] of the tree where of I commanded thee
[1:09:00] that thou should us not eat there's only
[1:09:03] one way that you could have known that
[1:09:06] you were naked and that is if you had
[1:09:09] done this certain thing exactly what God
[1:09:13] said not to
[1:09:16] do and the man and the man
[1:09:21] said the woman whom thou gave Gest to be
[1:09:24] with me she gave me of the tree and I
[1:09:27] did eat so God asks
[1:09:30] Adam and then God the Lord God said unto
[1:09:33] the woman what is that that thou Hast
[1:09:36] done and the woman said the serpent
[1:09:38] beguiled me and I did eat notice that
[1:09:41] God has respect to his two children for
[1:09:45] an explanation but he didn't give the
[1:09:47] serpent the same the same thing he
[1:09:49] didn't ask the serpent for
[1:09:51] anything and the Lord God said said unto
[1:09:54] the serpent he didn't ask he didn't ask
[1:09:56] what have you done and he said unto the
[1:09:58] serpent because thou Hast done this Thou
[1:10:00] Art cursed above all the cattle and
[1:10:02] above every beast and above of the field
[1:10:05] and upon thy belly shalt thou go and
[1:10:07] dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy
[1:10:10] life now he's changing from this manlike
[1:10:13] creature into a snake and I will put
[1:10:17] enmity between thee and the woman and
[1:10:20] between thy seed and her seed and it
[1:10:23] shall bre bruise thy head and thou shalt
[1:10:25] bruise his heel now I mentioned the
[1:10:27] godhead in chapter
[1:10:29] one where we have God created the
[1:10:32] heavens and the Earth and then we see
[1:10:33] the Holy Spirit move on the face of the
[1:10:36] deep and now we have the third part of
[1:10:40] the godhead mentioned right here but
[1:10:42] notice it came after
[1:10:44] sin it came because now they have sinned
[1:10:48] now they have fallen now they need a
[1:10:52] savior and it says this and I will put
[1:10:55] enmity between thee and the
[1:10:58] woman and between thy seed and her seed
[1:11:03] and it shall bruise thy head and thou
[1:11:05] shalt bruise his
[1:11:08] heel now
[1:11:11] here right
[1:11:13] here is the fall of mankind and now we
[1:11:18] need Jesus Christ on the scene and
[1:11:22] immediately God prophesies that this man
[1:11:27] is coming and right here we see that it
[1:11:30] couldn't be the seed of a man that it
[1:11:34] would come through usually you would you
[1:11:35] would think we're going to get to
[1:11:37] Abraham's seed and we're going to get to
[1:11:38] all of these different genealogies that
[1:11:41] go through and they're very important
[1:11:43] but it couldn't come through that it had
[1:11:46] to come through the
[1:11:47] woman because she doesn't have a
[1:11:51] lineage if it came through the man who
[1:11:53] would be like oh my dad's name is
[1:11:57] Joseph like like Jesus like they thought
[1:12:01] Jesus was but no it had to come through
[1:12:05] a woman because it had to be a virgin
[1:12:08] birth
[1:12:09] without a Earthly father and right here
[1:12:15] is prophesying of the coming
[1:12:17] Messiah because of a
[1:12:20] sin that had been committed the sin of
[1:12:24] adultery how do we know that it gets
[1:12:27] even better watch this verse number
[1:12:32] 16 God speaking and he said unto the
[1:12:35] woman he says you've done this and
[1:12:39] here's his children standing before him
[1:12:41] he curs the snake The Serpent and here's
[1:12:44] his two children and he said unto the
[1:12:46] woman I will greatly multiply thy sorrow
[1:12:49] and thy
[1:12:52] conception right here he's saying Eve
[1:12:56] daughter you're
[1:12:59] pregnant and in sorrow Thou shalt bring
[1:13:02] forth
[1:13:04] children not a
[1:13:06] child but two
[1:13:09] twins
[1:13:10] children and thy desire shall be to thy
[1:13:13] husband and he shall rule over
[1:13:16] thee and unto Adam he said because thou
[1:13:18] has hearkened unto the voice of thy wife
[1:13:20] and Hast eaten of the tree of which I
[1:13:23] command thee saying Thou shalt not eat
[1:13:25] of it cursed is the ground for thy sake
[1:13:27] and sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the
[1:13:29] days of thy life thorns and thistles
[1:13:32] shall it bring before thee and thou
[1:13:34] shalt eat of the herb of the field and
[1:13:36] the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat
[1:13:39] bread till thou return unto the ground
[1:13:41] for out of it was thou taken dust Thou
[1:13:44] Art and unto dust Thou shalt return
[1:13:48] ashes to ashes and dust to
[1:13:51] dust and Adam called his wife wife's
[1:13:54] name Eve because she was the mother of
[1:13:57] all
[1:14:00] living and again we know that
[1:14:04] because this was the sin of
[1:14:07] adultery here Adam is not the
[1:14:09] all he's the first man but he's not the
[1:14:13] father of all living but she is the
[1:14:14] mother of all living and unto Adam also
[1:14:17] unto his wife did the Lord God make
[1:14:19] coats of skins and clothe them here we
[1:14:23] have
[1:14:24] a very another very very important the
[1:14:26] reason I'm spending so much time on just
[1:14:29] this first little bit of Genesis is
[1:14:31] because it is so important and it goes
[1:14:33] all the way through the end of the Bible
[1:14:36] this very this start right here we have
[1:14:40] the first
[1:14:41] sin we have the prophecy of the Savior
[1:14:45] coming and now right here the scripture
[1:14:49] I just
[1:14:51] read we have the first
[1:14:54] sacrifice unto Adam also and to his wife
[1:14:57] did the Lord God make coats of skin and
[1:15:00] clothe them you can't take an animal's
[1:15:04] skin off of it without killing it so God
[1:15:08] goes and it was probably I would assume
[1:15:11] it was a lamb that he he took he killed
[1:15:16] imagine this was
[1:15:18] God's his his animal his pet his his
[1:15:23] beloved creation that he had made and
[1:15:25] here he goes and he kills it rips the
[1:15:28] skin off of it wraps up Adam and Eve and
[1:15:31] thus we have the first sacrifice and we
[1:15:35] see that Sacrifice from this point we
[1:15:38] see it now through the rest of the
[1:15:42] Bible now then so Eve's pregnant she has
[1:15:46] these two kids she has Cain and Abel one
[1:15:49] of them understood things and you'll
[1:15:52] look with when Abel makes when when they
[1:15:55] make sacrifices to
[1:15:58] God Abel
[1:16:00] understood God killed those animals took
[1:16:04] the skin wrapped Mom and Dad up with
[1:16:08] it so I understand now that I have to
[1:16:12] take the not the not just a lamb or not
[1:16:17] just a animal but the very best lamb the
[1:16:22] Bible says and he took
[1:16:25] the the flock and the the fat thereof so
[1:16:28] he took the very best one the fat one
[1:16:31] the good one and he took that and he
[1:16:34] sacrificed it on the altar to God and
[1:16:37] his brother Cain over here he probably
[1:16:41] number one the the vegetables and things
[1:16:44] that and the flowers and pretty Altar
[1:16:46] and everything that he made it probably
[1:16:48] wasn't worth a whole lot this fatling
[1:16:50] was worth a lot and he goes and he makes
[1:16:53] this beautiful Altar and God says I
[1:16:55] refuse your offering and I accept your
[1:17:00] brother
[1:17:02] abeles because abeles was
[1:17:05] right so many times we try to make an
[1:17:09] offering to
[1:17:11] God sometimes because it pleases us oh I
[1:17:15] think I'll do this but make sure when
[1:17:17] you were making an offering when you
[1:17:18] doing something something for God make
[1:17:20] sure that it pleases him or else it's
[1:17:23] it's done for
[1:17:24] not so we see Cain and Abel we go
[1:17:28] through and we see all of a sudden now
[1:17:32] right after this fall people start
[1:17:34] multiplying they start breeding and and
[1:17:37] we see C's line going over here and
[1:17:40] these these great men and they they they
[1:17:42] built great buildings and we see even
[1:17:45] down the line with Cain the there's
[1:17:47] violence in the cities that they're
[1:17:48] building and there's problems and even
[1:17:51] all the way down to one of these people
[1:17:53] down the line of Cain he's the first one
[1:17:56] to take more than one
[1:17:58] wife showing you that polygamy even
[1:18:01] though it's through the Bible it wasn't
[1:18:04] right in the beginning and it was
[1:18:05] actually a descendant of Cain that
[1:18:08] started
[1:18:10] polygamy so we go through if we go to
[1:18:14] chapter
[1:18:16] five this is great if you go to chapter
[1:18:21] 5 we see the lineage of Adam so Cain
[1:18:28] gets mad gets jealous he kills his
[1:18:30] brother Eve and Adam have another son
[1:18:35] this man's this man's name is Seth and
[1:18:38] it's and it's strange she says that God
[1:18:40] has appointed me another seed outside of
[1:18:43] Abel if really if Cain would have been
[1:18:46] Adam's son then that lineage would have
[1:18:49] come down through
[1:18:51] Cain but because it wasn't Adam's son
[1:18:54] Eve she understood she said that God
[1:18:58] gave me another one because Abel was
[1:19:02] killed so he so God gives Seth and then
[1:19:07] through this line of Seth we see how
[1:19:10] long these people these people lived it
[1:19:14] said here it says in verse eight that
[1:19:16] Seth was 912 years and he died and you
[1:19:21] see this in this chapter five you see a
[1:19:25] common occurrence that had never
[1:19:27] happened before and he died and he died
[1:19:32] and he died all the way through and he
[1:19:34] died 900 years 950 years
[1:19:38] 920 years 890 years and he died and he
[1:19:42] died and he died and death started there
[1:19:44] in the Garden of Eden all the way
[1:19:48] down
[1:19:50] 2,000 years or so
[1:19:54] this one's maybe 1500 years thousand
[1:19:58] yeah 1500 years we get down to this man
[1:20:01] named
[1:20:02] Methuselah let's go to verse
[1:20:05] 21 this is very very interesting a lot
[1:20:09] packed in these next few scriptures and
[1:20:12] Enoch lived 65 years and begat
[1:20:16] Methuselah and Enoch walked with God
[1:20:19] walked with God after he begat
[1:20:20] Methuselah 300 years and begat sons and
[1:20:23] daughters and all the days of Enoch were
[1:20:27] 365 years and Enoch walked with God and
[1:20:31] he was not for God took
[1:20:34] him so here we see a Rapture take place
[1:20:39] a man that was not sick that did not die
[1:20:42] God just took him happened again with
[1:20:45] Elijah and it's going to happen again
[1:20:48] very soon because as brother Paul was
[1:20:50] saying we are getting right to the end
[1:20:52] we're we're seeing everybody start to
[1:20:54] turn on this country Israel which I
[1:20:57] believe is in Ezekiel or Zachariah that
[1:20:59] says all nations will come against
[1:21:03] Israel we're getting to that point for a
[1:21:08] Rapture of more than one but many and I
[1:21:12] want to be part of
[1:21:15] that
[1:21:18] so
[1:21:19] Enoch God took him and then we
[1:21:24] have this guy Methuselah that's born
[1:21:29] very interesting thing right here we
[1:21:31] have Enoch his son was Methuselah then
[1:21:35] Methuselah is
[1:21:38] born and the
[1:21:42] name
[1:21:44] Methuselah means it means a couple
[1:21:47] different things but this is what struck
[1:21:50] me when he is dead it shall be sent yes
[1:21:55] so Methuselah is born and then
[1:21:59] 969 years
[1:22:01] later what
[1:22:03] happens how old was Methuselah when he
[1:22:07] died
[1:22:08] 969 years so meusel is born
[1:22:13] 969 years past about there's I mean
[1:22:17] wasn't maybe to the day but then
[1:22:21] something big happens so imagine if you
[1:22:24] knew
[1:22:26] Methuselah and you knew that his name
[1:22:29] maybe under prophecy said when he is
[1:22:31] dead it shall be sent and you're
[1:22:33] thinking okay Methuselah is getting kind
[1:22:35] of
[1:22:35] old in fact he's probably older than
[1:22:40] anyone has ever lived in their life and
[1:22:43] there's a prophecy that says his name
[1:22:46] means that when he is
[1:22:49] dead it shall be sent
[1:22:53] um continue feeding methusa that organic
[1:22:57] food because you want this guy to live a
[1:23:00] long time because what is going to
[1:23:03] happen when he dies I mean it can't be
[1:23:06] the end of the world
[1:23:10] right it
[1:23:13] was Methuselah lived
[1:23:17] 969 years and in that same year that
[1:23:22] Methuselah died it something happened
[1:23:25] that had never happened in the history
[1:23:27] of the world it
[1:23:30] rained not only did it rain from the
[1:23:33] skies the water gusted up from the
[1:23:36] ground and killed every living creature
[1:23:41] on earth including every human being
[1:23:44] except for this man named Noah and his
[1:23:50] family an amazing thing
[1:23:53] that happened 969 years after methusa
[1:23:57] was
[1:23:58] born so then
[1:24:02] Noah is Noah is on the earth and and
[1:24:05] right before it started to rain God
[1:24:08] looked out upon the Earth and things
[1:24:10] were just going bad you know it started
[1:24:14] it started there when
[1:24:17] when Adam and Eve were there and The
[1:24:19] Serpent and he messed everything up and
[1:24:22] now we have death and we have fighting
[1:24:23] we have murder and we have all of these
[1:24:26] problems and and these these young men
[1:24:29] are starting to marry outside with these
[1:24:31] worldly girls and vice versa it was just
[1:24:34] a big mess and it got worse and it got
[1:24:37] worse and worse and all of a sudden now
[1:24:40] there was more violence than there's
[1:24:43] ever
[1:24:44] been and God looked out upon the Earth
[1:24:49] and he
[1:24:50] sees that it's filled filled with
[1:24:53] violence violence verse number 10 verse
[1:24:55] number
[1:24:56] 11 chapter 6 it says this and the Earth
[1:25:00] was corrupt before God and the Earth was
[1:25:03] filled with violence and God looked upon
[1:25:06] the Earth and behold it was corrupt for
[1:25:08] All Flesh had corrupted his way upon the
[1:25:10] Earth and God said to Noah the end of
[1:25:12] All Flesh has come before me and the
[1:25:15] Earth is filled with violence through
[1:25:17] them and behold I will destroy them with
[1:25:21] the Earth
[1:25:23] and Jesus Christ
[1:25:25] himself said before I
[1:25:29] return in the time that I return he says
[1:25:34] as it was in the days of
[1:25:36] Noah so shall it
[1:25:39] be we see all the violence we see the
[1:25:42] hatred as brother Paul said the
[1:25:43] anti-Semitism against these people these
[1:25:46] are descendants of
[1:25:49] Noah these are descendants of Noah
[1:25:52] Noah's son Shem these are descendants of
[1:25:56] of the man named
[1:25:59] Abraham and violence all through it all
[1:26:02] hating these people and now it's all
[1:26:05] coming up and Jesus said when I come
[1:26:08] back it's going to be like it was in the
[1:26:11] days of
[1:26:12] Noah so then God floods the Earth kills
[1:26:16] all the
[1:26:18] people the ark floats Noah and his
[1:26:21] family to safe
[1:26:25] they after I think it was 150 days or or
[1:26:29] it was a lot of days um they they
[1:26:32] finally land on dry
[1:26:35] ground
[1:26:38] and God verse chapter number chapter
[1:26:43] nine God blessed Noah and his
[1:26:46] sons and he said unto them be fruitful
[1:26:48] and multiply when they came out of the
[1:26:50] Ark and replen the Earth exactly what
[1:26:54] had happened there at the in at the
[1:26:57] beginning In the Garden of
[1:27:01] Eden verse number 14 and it shall come
[1:27:04] to pass when I bring a cloud over the
[1:27:06] Earth that the
[1:27:10] bow shall be seen in the cloud and I
[1:27:13] will remember my Covenant which is
[1:27:15] between me and you and every living
[1:27:17] creature of All Flesh and the wat shall
[1:27:19] be shall no more and the water and the
[1:27:22] Waters shall no more become a flood and
[1:27:24] Destroy All Flesh and the bow shall be
[1:27:27] seen and the bow shall be in the cloud
[1:27:30] and I I will look upon it that I may
[1:27:33] remember the Everlasting Covenant
[1:27:34] between God and every living creature of
[1:27:36] All Flesh that is upon the Earth and God
[1:27:39] said unto Noah this is the token of the
[1:27:42] Covenant which I have established
[1:27:44] between me and All Flesh that is upon
[1:27:46] the Earth but sin already had a foothold
[1:27:50] but I think for everyone here and for
[1:27:52] the young people here when you look up
[1:27:55] and you see that rainbow remember God's
[1:27:59] looking at the same rainbow and he's
[1:28:01] reminding himself he's remembering that
[1:28:04] no I am not going to destroy this Earth
[1:28:07] no matter how angry he gets I'm not
[1:28:10] going to destroy this Earth anymore with
[1:28:13] a
[1:28:14] flood but Peter said the next time it's
[1:28:17] going to be burned with
[1:28:19] fire so then they started building C
[1:28:22] ities again as the Book of Genesis goes
[1:28:24] on they started building more cities and
[1:28:27] again sin had a foothold and they
[1:28:30] started to cause problems and and and
[1:28:34] then they build this great
[1:28:37] Tower of Babel they were so
[1:28:41] advanced in the way that they were
[1:28:43] living and in their technology they
[1:28:45] build this Tower and God looks down and
[1:28:48] he says the same thing that he says when
[1:28:52] it was in the Garden of Eden he says now
[1:28:54] look at they're becoming like us
[1:28:59] here and just like they had done when
[1:29:01] they ate of the tree of knowledge of
[1:29:03] Good and Evil so he comes down and he
[1:29:06] comes down in a different way this time
[1:29:07] and he confounds their language and
[1:29:09] everyone couldn't
[1:29:11] communicate the tower
[1:29:15] fell chapter
[1:29:17] 11 we'll get to
[1:29:20] Abraham
[1:29:22] and the earth and the whole earth was of
[1:29:24] one language and of one speech and Tara
[1:29:27] lived 70 years and begat Abram nahor and
[1:29:30] Heron now these are the generations of
[1:29:32] Tara Tara begat Abram nahor and Heron
[1:29:35] and Heron begat
[1:29:37] lot and Heron died before his father
[1:29:40] Tara in the land of his
[1:29:44] Nativity in the in the
[1:29:47] land of his
[1:29:50] Nativity in her
[1:29:52] and in the caldes and Abram and nahor
[1:29:55] took them wives and the name of Abram's
[1:29:57] wife was Sarai and the name of nahor's
[1:30:00] wife milka the daughter of Heron the
[1:30:02] father of Mila and the father of Isa but
[1:30:07] Sarai was Baron she had no child and
[1:30:10] Tara took Abram his son and lot the son
[1:30:12] of Heron and his son's son and Sarai the
[1:30:17] daughter-in-law and his son Abram's wife
[1:30:19] and they went forth with them from ER of
[1:30:23] the Cales to go to the land of Canaan
[1:30:26] and they came to Heron and dwelt there
[1:30:29] and the days of Tara were 205 years and
[1:30:33] Tara died notice something that happened
[1:30:34] right
[1:30:35] there very strange so from Noah's time
[1:30:41] everyone was living to be 900 years
[1:30:44] old and then when it started
[1:30:47] raining all of a sudden very quickly
[1:30:51] lifespan started to shorten I don't know
[1:30:53] if it was an atmospheric thing I don't
[1:30:56] know if it was a physical thing I don't
[1:30:57] know what happened but the lifespans of
[1:31:00] the people began to quickly shorten
[1:31:02] until Abraham was about 125 years old so
[1:31:06] they went from
[1:31:08] 900 all the way down to 125 years in a
[1:31:12] very short
[1:31:15] time and
[1:31:17] once so Abraham starts or God starts to
[1:31:20] deal with this man Abram Abram later as
[1:31:23] you know his name was changed to
[1:31:26] Abraham and he tells Abram to come out
[1:31:30] as I just read of this land and go into
[1:31:33] this land of Canaan so Abram goes and he
[1:31:38] goes with his nephew lot as I just read
[1:31:42] they they go out and they started
[1:31:44] squabbling all of his people Abraham's
[1:31:47] people and lot's lot's people all the
[1:31:49] herdsmen they started squabbling with
[1:31:51] each other and Abram's like hey we can't
[1:31:52] get along you need to go your way and
[1:31:55] I'll go my way where do you want to go
[1:31:57] Abram looks down and he sees this ferle
[1:31:59] Valley in this city down there called
[1:32:02] Sodom so lot takes the fertile Valley
[1:32:07] and then Abram
[1:32:10] goes and goes his way to another
[1:32:15] place
[1:32:18] now
[1:32:20] in verse
[1:32:23] 13 they they separate ways that I'm
[1:32:26] sorry then in chapter 14 Abraham lot
[1:32:29] gets in trouble he gets down there and
[1:32:32] immediately he gets in trouble he gets
[1:32:34] taken captive by these Four Kings and
[1:32:37] Abra Abram must musters up an army of
[1:32:40] his soldiers arms them and they go down
[1:32:43] and they defeat these Four
[1:32:45] Kings rescue
[1:32:48] lot and then they come back and they
[1:32:50] meet this mysterious ious man called
[1:32:53] MDC just a couple verses about MDC mzc
[1:32:58] brings the bread and the wine and they
[1:33:00] have communion there and then from that
[1:33:03] time The Book of Psalms mentions this
[1:33:06] man mzd the book of Hebrews mentions
[1:33:09] this man mzc you've heard brother
[1:33:11] Brandon preach a whole sermon on who is
[1:33:13] this man mzc he's a very mysterious
[1:33:16] person but it turns out that this man is
[1:33:18] the almighty
[1:33:20] God in the form of a human being that
[1:33:23] meets
[1:33:25] Abraham
[1:33:27] so in chapter
[1:33:30] 14 he he meets he meets this man
[1:33:34] mzc and Abraham had been promised as I
[1:33:38] read earlier that his seed was going to
[1:33:42] spread throughout the
[1:33:44] world and that God was going to make a
[1:33:47] great nation from his seed from his
[1:33:50] children but there was just one
[1:33:53] problem and that problem is Abraham and
[1:33:56] his wife couldn't have
[1:33:57] children so it got of course Abraham was
[1:34:01] was really down and uh we'll end we'll
[1:34:05] end with
[1:34:06] this chapter 15 and then I'll turn it
[1:34:10] over to brother Lyall next week after
[1:34:13] this but I thought that it would be
[1:34:16] really
[1:34:19] nice to read this chapter
[1:34:22] 15 Abraham's
[1:34:26] down he had
[1:34:28] just met this man
[1:34:31] mzc conquered these Kings rescued
[1:34:35] lot and after these things chapter F 15
[1:34:39] and after these things the word of the
[1:34:41] Lord came unto Abram in a vision saying
[1:34:45] fear not Abram I am thy shield and thy
[1:34:48] exceeding great
[1:34:50] reward and Abraham said Lord
[1:34:55] God What wilt thou give me seeing I go
[1:34:58] childless and the steward of my house is
[1:35:02] this elaser of Damascus so Abraham had
[1:35:04] this servant in his house and it was the
[1:35:07] custom back then that if you did not
[1:35:09] have an heir if you didn't have a son
[1:35:12] that that Steward of your house would
[1:35:15] act as your son and inher be the
[1:35:20] inheritance
[1:35:22] elzer was a great servant we'll get to
[1:35:25] I'm sure brother ly will get to him in
[1:35:27] the next the next
[1:35:29] service Abraham said behold thou Hast
[1:35:32] given me no seed and lo one born in my
[1:35:36] house is mine Heir and behold the word
[1:35:38] of the Lord came unto him saying this
[1:35:41] shall not be thine Heir but he that
[1:35:44] shall come forth out of thine own bowels
[1:35:47] shall be thine air and he brought him
[1:35:49] forth abroad
[1:35:52] and said look now toward the
[1:35:56] heaven and tell the Stars if thou be
[1:35:59] able to number them and he said unto him
[1:36:02] so shall thy seed
[1:36:05] be this is a man that couldn't have
[1:36:09] children
[1:36:10] aging and he believed in the Lord and
[1:36:13] counted it to him for
[1:36:15] righteousness and he said unto him I am
[1:36:18] the Lord that brought thee out of UR of
[1:36:20] the C to give thee this land to
[1:36:23] inherited
[1:36:25] inherited and he said Lord God whereby
[1:36:28] shall I know that I shall inherit it and
[1:36:32] he said unto him take me a heer 3 years
[1:36:35] old and a she goat 3 years old and a ram
[1:36:38] of three years old and a turtle dove and
[1:36:41] a young pigeon and he took unto him all
[1:36:44] these and divided them in the midst and
[1:36:48] laid each piece one against another but
[1:36:50] the birds divided not and when the fowls
[1:36:53] came down upon the carcass Abraham Abram
[1:36:55] drove them away and when the sun was
[1:36:58] going
[1:37:00] down a deep sleep fell upon
[1:37:05] Abram and low a horror of great Darkness
[1:37:08] fell upon him and he said unto
[1:37:12] Abram know of assurity that thy seed
[1:37:16] shall be a stranger in a in in a land
[1:37:20] that is not there
[1:37:22] and Shall Serve them and they shall
[1:37:24] afflict them 400
[1:37:26] years but the LI will be talking about
[1:37:31] that at the end of his seron his sermon
[1:37:34] next
[1:37:35] Wednesday and also that Nation whom they
[1:37:38] Shall Serve will I judge and afterwards
[1:37:41] shall they come out with a great
[1:37:44] substance now we go into the book of
[1:37:47] Exodus God is prophesying here
[1:37:51] and thou shalt go to thy fathers in
[1:37:54] peace and thou shalt be buried in a good
[1:37:56] old
[1:37:57] age but in the fourth
[1:37:59] generation they shall come hither again
[1:38:02] for the iniquity of the amorites is not
[1:38:04] yet full and it shall come to and it
[1:38:06] came to pass that when the sun went down
[1:38:09] and it was dark Behold a smoking furnace
[1:38:12] and a burning lamp that passed between
[1:38:14] those
[1:38:15] pieces in the same day the Lord made a
[1:38:18] covenant with Abram saying unto the thy
[1:38:21] seed have I given this land from the
[1:38:25] river of Egypt unto the Great River the
[1:38:28] river of
[1:38:30] Euphrates it's
[1:38:32] fitting let's all stand it's
[1:38:35] fitting
[1:38:37] that the Battle Cry for the Philistines
[1:38:41] is from The River To The
[1:38:43] Sea and we read right here that no no no
[1:38:47] no no that land was given to Abraham to
[1:38:52] his son Isaac to his son Jacob and to
[1:38:56] all the sons of Jacob was it given and
[1:38:59] not to anyone else and they are in their
[1:39:02] inherited land
[1:39:05] today brother Aaron if you could sing a
[1:39:08] song as as we um close in this beginning
[1:39:13] of the book of
[1:39:14] Genesis we
[1:39:17] see the fall of mankind we see the
[1:39:21] genealogies come through and we see how
[1:39:24] God after
[1:39:27] Noah that he took this man Shem and from
[1:39:31] Shem this man Abraham and now the rest
[1:39:35] of the
[1:39:37] book is about this man Abraham and his
[1:39:41] Descendants the whole
[1:39:44] Bible he's
[1:39:46] there with
[1:39:49] Aaron for
[1:39:53] my soul would
[1:39:59] be had it not been for a
[1:40:05] [Music]
[1:40:13] man for the old
[1:40:16] rug
[1:40:19] C
[1:40:21] had it not been for a
[1:40:26] man called
[1:40:30] Jesus then
[1:40:33] Forever My
[1:40:37] Soul am man he he's mentioned this man
[1:40:40] Jesus as I said is mentioned right there
[1:40:43] in the Garden of
[1:40:44] Eden saying that that he was going to
[1:40:49] come and and he was going to crush the
[1:40:52] head of that serpent he's going to crush
[1:40:55] the head of sin but before that was
[1:40:58] finished that that sin would bruise his
[1:41:02] heel and he would die on the
[1:41:05] cross all the way through friends all
[1:41:07] the way through the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:41:09] from the start to the Finish he's in the
[1:41:12] Bible This Book of Genesis we see where
[1:41:15] Satan started he caused sin to come into
[1:41:19] the world we see it all the way down
[1:41:22] through the genealogies but we see that
[1:41:24] God had chosen his his people to serve
[1:41:28] him and now we have gotten to
[1:41:30] Abraham and the closing of the rest of
[1:41:33] the book is about this man Abraham and
[1:41:37] his family brother Paul would you come
[1:41:39] and close in prayer I want to pull on
[1:41:40] you one more
[1:41:49] time
[1:41:51] [Music]
[1:41:56] amen let's bow before the
[1:41:58] [Music]
[1:42:00] Lord heavenly father as we
[1:42:03] heard these important scriptures Lord
[1:42:06] that the devil hates so much because it
[1:42:09] does reveal where he came from it also
[1:42:13] reveals the beginning of our
[1:42:16] promises Lord that we
[1:42:18] today we are the royal Seed of Abraham
[1:42:22] through
[1:42:23] Christ and so Lord we know that even as
[1:42:27] that first commission was given there in
[1:42:29] the Garden of
[1:42:30] Eden was given to a spirit man before he
[1:42:34] was placed in flesh he was commission to
[1:42:37] be fruitful to multiply to replenish the
[1:42:40] Earth because as brother Bram said it
[1:42:43] was a spiritual Eternal
[1:42:45] commission we saw it tonight as Noah
[1:42:49] came forth from the ark that Commission
[1:42:50] Miss was repeated to go forth into the
[1:42:53] Earth to replenish and Lord that was not
[1:42:56] just and most importantly it didn't
[1:42:58] really involved the the bringing forth
[1:43:01] of the bodies and the temples of man but
[1:43:03] it was the spirits of man that would
[1:43:06] dwell in those temples that was what was
[1:43:08] of interest to you
[1:43:09] Lord and here we are father that
[1:43:12] commission is still ours when Jesus said
[1:43:14] go ye into all the world and preach the
[1:43:17] gospel there's that commission again
[1:43:19] we're under that Commission I pray Lord
[1:43:21] that we would have a burden in our heart
[1:43:24] for lost souls yes Lord we see the end
[1:43:28] Upon Us gross darkness is on the land
[1:43:31] lord we don't know maybe there's just
[1:43:33] one or two left that need to come in but
[1:43:34] may we have such a burden on our heart
[1:43:37] to reach out to let you work through US
[1:43:40] father as we see these
[1:43:43] scriptures these first chapters of
[1:43:46] Genesis Lord it brings down the reality
[1:43:49] and the importance of of where we're at
[1:43:51] today now this whole story is coming to
[1:43:54] its final end and then we go once again
[1:43:59] Immortal Eternal and we'll see you face
[1:44:02] to face thank you for being with us here
[1:44:04] tonight Lord I pray that this won't just
[1:44:07] be a simple Bible study or Bible lesson
[1:44:11] but Lord that you would reveal it to our
[1:44:12] hearts that it would change us increase
[1:44:14] our faith and give us more love for you
[1:44:17] and for one another we ask it all in
[1:44:19] jesus' name amen amen
[1:44:22] [Music]
[1:44:28] amen had it not been for a Hill Called
[1:44:34] Mount
[1:44:36] [Music]
[1:44:38] calary had it not been for the old R it
[1:44:48] CR had it
[1:44:52] for a
[1:44:54] man
[1:44:58] Jesus then
[1:45:02] forever my soul will
[1:45:06] [Music]
[1:45:08] beong I want to read just one more time
