know that he was a real blessing we got to stream I didn't realize where we were hunting I thought I'd have a little bit of signal but we were in the what we call the boonies back home we were just way way way in the sticks and there was no signal at all uh no service and so but uh but we got to the stream just for a moment there and I was really just blessed by the word of God I appreciate God's servants amen and then yielding themselves Psalms chapter 78 I'd like to preach to you something here this morning I'd like to title free from Fear free from Fear listen here in Psalms chapter 78 and brothers if you have that on the screen you can display that just verse one we'll read all all the way down through give ear oh my people to my law incline your ears to the words of my mouth just keep going in the ver the verses here verse two I will open my mouth in a parable I will utter dark sayings of old which we have heard and known and our fathers have told us we will not hide them from their children showing to the generation to come the Praises of the Lord and his strength and his wonderful works that he hath done now watch how David begins to recount this and he starts off by saying give ear and he and he says here hear the words of my mouth I'm gon to I'm going to speak something here and it's going to have it's going to have an effect it's going to have power and he begins to rehearse and he says I'll utter things from old uh previous in the past and he says and we're not going to hide the past from our children we're not going to cover up what the Lord did we're not going to forget about it how many times does the Lord say forget not the works which the Lord has done for you and so now here's David and he begins to recount and he says for he established a testimony in Jacob appointed the law in Israel which he commanded our fathers that they should make them known this is a commandment this isn't a suggestion did you ever catch this here it's a Commandment that he commanded us that we should make them known to their children verse six keep going brother that the generation to come might know them even the children which should be born who should arise and declare them to their children verse seven we'll just keep going that they here's the purpose that they might set their hope in God and forget not the works of God but keep his Commandments I want you to move to verse 12 he did Miracles notice this marvelous things did he that marvelous is our English word miracle and so he says he did miraculous things marvelous things did he in the sight of their fathers in the land of Egypt in the field of zoan so David begins to recount this he divided vers verse 13 he divided the sea and caused them to pass through he made the waters stand up as a heap he guided them in the daytime also he led them with a cloud and all the night with a light of fire he notice this he clav that means he split he broke open the rocks in the wilderness and gave them drink as out of the great depths verse 16 he brought streams also out of the Rock and called caused Waters to run down like rivers and so David begins to recount and he says here's What the Lord Has Done don't forget about it make sure you keep it in remembrance and make sure you're teaching it to the next Generation now these were what we would call Sunday school lessons what we've learned from children story of the children of Israel C in the Red Sea but notice to David these weren't 2,000 year historically events but this was things that God had done in David's generation so it's one thing for us to teach our children what God did uh years ago 2,000 years ago but what about what God's doing right now amen praise the Lord I'd like to just to pray if you have a need something upon your heart you just want to make it known by an uplifted hand and we'll just go to the Lord in prayer Heavenly Father we know Lord that you are in control father you're Supreme Lord you're you're Sovereign that means Lord that at your discretion you choose you're not you're not influenced by any external thing your your choices that you make the decisions that you've made are Eternal Lord your purposes David said are established from eternity and so God we know that that's our confidence this morning Lord that you've seen this Sunday morning you've seen this day and David said this is the day that the Lord has made I'll rejoice and be glad in it today father is the day of salvation let us help us to forget yesterday help us to put aside for a moment tomorrow and let us focus in on your word we believe that it teaches it exhorts it transforms it encourages it challenges so we raise our hands with the needs Lord with every person that's have a hand that has a hand raised ident ified by a need would you come this morning would you meet it Lord move me as my prayer out of the way Lord and may your word be preeminent we ask Grant it Lord to each and every single person here this morning in Jesus Christ's name amen you can be seated this morning Jesus made a prediction and it was prophetic that the last days that we're living in would be a time of unprecedented fear that's a word that you hear a lot if you watch the news or listen to the news uh of any kind no matter what outlet that you listen to you you'll hear this word unprecedented how many's heard that lately and so we know that it it's an unprecedented World things are happening at an unprecedented in other words there's no precedent for it there's many things that are that are taking place today there is no history historical record for us to go back and identify and say it's just a cycle repeating and this is very important because for years history has just repeated itself uh the prophet of God in the Ephesian Church age mentions that and says history just keeps repeating itself in one generation we have Israel and he said there's just a cycle and he says but but there there there there's going to come a junction and brother Bon preaches a message called the junction of time back and listen to that message the prophet is making the point that there that there was there was important spots there was specific important times and Seasons that were Junctions they meant something they weren't just like last year they weren't like the year before but there there was something unique and and and brother B says and every time he says God reveals himself at a junction of History you're familiar with with that and and so Jesus refers to this Junction in Luke 21 and I I want you to put it on the screen if you could brother Jeremy in verse 25 he's going to re he's going to point to a junction that's coming upon the world and he says he says it would be a time of unprecedented fear here's his words here and he says and there shall be signs in the Sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the Earth distress that's a key word there distress uh among the Nations notice this uh there there will be distress of nations with perplexity these these words here to me are in bright neon green when I read them or red or whatever color you want to use they're bright lit up flashing because it w it's it's it's so identifiable of 2020 and even more than that we have a we can have a tendency just to lock into oh 2020 has been so bad and oh man they've made so many you know different kind of memes about 2020 and how bad it is and but you know really friends uh the world may have just woke it up to how terrible the the the the condition of the of mankind is in but we've known that since a prophet declared it to us 30 years ago that there's perplexity and and in this age you see more than ever before you don't have to look very far into the eyes of a person to see the distress to see the Calamity to see as Jesus called it the perplexity he says this he says the sea uh the waves and the waves roaring verse 26 uh the seves and the Rays were in men's Hearts now notice this was this was uh this was a junction this was a time specific that men's Hearts would fail for fear failing them literally heart heart failure that their hearts there would come a time that was so dark perplexity distress and he says men's Hearts would fail for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of Heaven shall be shaken we know the scripture very well in Matthew 24 and he says Nation shall rise against nation and Kingdom against Kingdom there shall be famines and pestilences and earthquakes and then he says all these are the beginning of Sorrows lately I I've looked at this scripture and I I just begin to look at this and with all of the Calamity that that we're facing in the world today and all of the uncertainty he says this is just the beginning of Sorrows almost what we would call the contractions you sisters know that real well or familiar with that us men can only say it and sound like we know what we're talking about but contractions uh I remember contractions I remember my wife having contractions and the birth pains and and he says it's just the beginning this is just the contractions com on this is just the just as the prophet preached the message birth pains waiting to be born we know we've preached here before on the groanings within that all nature groans within itself uh he says and many false prophets shall arise and deceive many iniquity shall abound and because of abounding iniquity the love of many shall grow cold and he goes on to say and there shall be Great Tribulation and and that not that since was not from the beginning of the world nor ever will be not of this world or the world to come and he says for thou sh there shall arise false Christ and false prophet showing great signs and wonders and then he gives this last warning in Matthew 24 watch therefore for you know not what hour the Lord doth come so the the the world is ring in fear we we know that this is there's a there's a uh uh if anything there's a fear pandemic Co pandemic but there's a fear pandemic upon the world and there the entire world is is affected this isn't just North America but it's the entire world affected by economic systems and and uh and and and health systems and government structures there's such uncertainty and and and you know we're we're very familiar with that even even the long before covid there was such an unpredictability I'm just preaching here common things things that we all know but there was such an such things that were just so unpredictable even even the weather uh across the world if you if you follow and as and I I do it maybe it's just a how the Lord made me but I follow not just this the the national stage but the world stage and you try to put that as a conglomerate to watch you know what what what what stage is the entire world at because you you'll be able to the prophet of God said that he said look at he preached a message called modern events made clear by prophecy and so there's there's events that are happening now that have been made clear there's not an uncertainty within the family of God but the weather even has became uh a just a an innumerable number of calamities and hurricanes even just this year Louisiana uh just coming up through the gulf coming right past Marty martyr City just hurricane after Hurricane after Hurricane and you say well what's happening go back to prophecy go back to the message the prophet of God preaches the oncoming storm and his inspiration for that message is a hurricane that's coming up through the gulf and going to strike Florida and brother mam says what is it it's birth pains it's judgment it's it's it's evidence that man has spurned Mercy he's forsaken as the scripture says I in the I think it's in Isaiah says you've forsaken your own mercy and so even the uncertainty and the Calamity that we see in in just earthquakes you could you could just I could show you charts and graphs and I'm sure some of you who follow that could you could just go to the uh the the the you know there's websites you can go to just to watch in real time earthquakes that are taking place and I I can say this one word it's unprecedented and it's really in the last few years it's almost there's almost been an acceleration there's almost been an accelerated Pace towards disaster and it's times you can't hardly keep up with it we've watched the world and just just just the last few months since February March of this year we watched the entire world turn upside down right before our very eyes and our lives become disjointed in ways that we would have never thought possible the whole world has been turned upside down uh and and it's as I said it's not just National it's this is global and and and even you look beyond that you could look at the just the metric of crimes you could look at the Met I could show you charts and graphs of the rate of divorce the rate of suicide and it would all come back to this one word unprecedented that it's unprecedented it's a time where it seems impossible to curb crime crime in in in in this metropolitan cities crime in the rural areas crime in the schools your children are going to imagine an unsafe Place being an elementary school that you would send your children to and it's it's just society that has just gone completely insane and out of their minds and more than ever before this is the the time Jesus referred to that said men's Hearts would fail them because of fear now fear is such an amazing thing uh and and we're just going to take just a moment here to look at it but to the fear is such an amazing thing that it's actually a fear is actually as much a real energy as faith is a real energy we could say this that if Faith activates the promises of God's word in my life then fear activates the devil's schemes and attacks and plans in my life if faith is a conduit for all the benefits and blessings of God because we know that it is uh whoever Jesus said if uh you must first believe that he is and that he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him for without faith it's impossible to please God for by faith the elders obtained a good report for by faith Enoch for by faith uh you know the the the the the scripture there in Hebrews and so while Faith activates the promises of God faith is a conduit faith is the channel by which God can move through in your life if you'll just have faith but just as Faith activates God fear activates Satan are you here this morning we could say fear is the conduit by which now I'm not talking about Godly fear we've preached on that here before there's good things to fear we teach our children to fear fire and that's a good fear it's a healthy fear I teach my children children a a fear of firearms and it's not a fear of Terror but it's a fear of respect that you understand the capability of something so we're not talking about Good fears it's good Godly fear and the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom and so but it's I'm not talking about that kind of fear but I'm talking about phobia I'm talking about Terror and fear is something that all of us every single person here today no matter how young how old every single person deals with whether it's the fear of some phobia that you have or the fear of losing everything or the fear of your losing your salvation the fear of going to hell the fear of dying all of us have a some type of fear that that we have but the Bible says that he's he who's he the Lord has not given us the believer the family of God the spirit of fear so we know that there's fears but then there's a spirit of fear that's upon the nation that's upon the world that's upon the the world system and and and and but the Bible says he's not given us in other words he's not put that upon us and if we've got it it's came from the devil not from our father above and fear is he's not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of a sound mind sound meaning it has Integrity meaning that that it can stand the test meaning that it has strength and so you're born we know naturally with the fear uh it's part even of the sin nature it's amazing when you go back and you look in the The Book of Genesis and you'll find out that the Bible doesn't say that God breathed into at his nostrils he became a living soul and then he was afraid no but you actually don't find the word afraid until after sin enters in in the fall and actually it's the first response by Adam I was afraid and so I hid myself what do we do in fear we run even Adam's uh exemplifying it for us as an example I was afraid I was scared there was a fear that here comes God who before God came down and fellowshipped with him in the cool of the evening and there was no fear there was no worry there was was only joy and Bliss and now that same presence that same God comes down and Adam's afraid and so we know it's part of the sin nature I was afraid so I hid myself and we know that this world that we live in is an age Beyond any other time that this is fearful times Jesus called it perplexing and and and the entire world knows that they know no new administration's going to fix anything no no existing administration's going to fix anything because at the end of the day men have failed us governments have failed us plans have failed us what what has it gotten us there's no it almost seems that no one has a solution you just look at how rapidly uh entertainment has declined and we and and I'm just speaking of worldly entertainment here you can look at how fast movies and Hollywood who brother brandom says there was Satan's uh headquarters and you look at how much of a rapid decline what you would think was so oh my you know 20 years ago what they were throwing in films was so just mindblowing and just so horrific and so corrupt but now look today it's it's it would be it would be I have a g rating compared to what they've rated the the entertainment industry today you say why is that important because it shows you the rapid acceleration brother bandam says in his visions and he has he has uh we there's actually a tape you could go back and and and read about the seven visions that the prophet of God has and and and in those Visions are are leading up to a climax to very end they're in chronological order and then it comes to uh one of the last visions he sees the the the the the morality had so eroded amongst people and he speaks of of women he says that would almost be completely it would be a whol sale he calls it stripes and he said to where they would almost be completely nuded and he said to where there was just nothing covering them he says I've seen the morality he says of women just declin at such a rate and he says now what was it it wasn't just a prophet pointing at sin but he was pointing it as metrics he was pointing it as Junctions to say when you see this when you with your eyes witness this you know where you're at he comes to that and he says it was moral Decline and boy have we ever seen that today and beyond that he says then the next Vision I had he said was of a he said a a president and he says he says seen a woman I've seen her that's his exact words I've seen her and he says and he says she was a cruel hearted going another place outside of the church hbook he said she was a a cruel-hearted woman beautiful he says but cruel-hearted and he says I've seen her rise to great power and he said in the United States of America he says that he says and he says and it would be a woman he says she'll either be president or vice president and he says though I knew this could be the rise of the Roman Catholic church now I'm just I'm not preaching a Doctrine here so don't nobody go out and say brother Matt believes Camala Harris is the you know the now now does brother Matt I don't know that it could be I can tell you this that for years we've looked at what brother Bram said about that and thought uh it's the Roman Catholic church because we can see that she brother Adam said she would control everything and that's happened already I controls everything amen and he says but it could be it could be I knew it could be he says but I seen her and he says a woman VI president or vice president you think that was an accident that that little Andor was put in there no it was the spirit of God speaking through a prophet and he said she be president or vice president now friends if we've ever if we we ever going to fulfill that that that Vision that brother bandam has it's going to happen here in January what is it January 21st or 20th the inauguration day and he says then what happens after that he says the next Vision was America he said just in smoldering smoking ruins and he said in some atomic bomb or some nuclear bomb had had had went off and so we know that this is prophesy it's what Jesus prophesied as we read in Luke and in Matthew that it would be perplexing times it would be a a time you say brother Matt what does that produce it produces fear that that age that we're living in produces a fear that grips people and even Believers can be susceptible to that Spirit are you here today if you never get covid and you never uh you maybe you maybe you go through this entire pandemic and you're never diagnosed a positive diagnosed with Co and the praise the Lord for that but be careful that while bypassing the virus you ingest the fear that surrounds the virus because sometimes that can be more damaging than the virus itself the Bible says this in Ecclesiastes 1:18 you don't have to to turn I'm just going to read it he says and this is Solomon here in much wisdom is much grief and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow boy isn't that true the older you get the more knowledge you get the more susceptible to sorrow you are it's a it's an age of complete fear you know and and and and Fear Can can become such a common thing for all of us here today and and even for us and and I know I've read this here before I'm just going to read it here just again as the Lord just leads me through this you can you you there's there's so many definitions of common fears or what we would call phobias I'm going to read it to you from uh good old brother Wikipedia let me let him talk here for a minute fear is a distressing notice this I didn't have time to put it up fear is a distressing negative sensation induced by a perceived threat now I want to read you something here before before I go there let me read you something from the prophet in God's way that's been made for us and I wish I had time to put this up and it just didn't so just just listen imagine it's on the screen okay he says brother mam says after through the services of this week trying to show people that there's no need to be scared the worst thing Satan the devil can put upon you the worst thing the worst thing cancer uh uh tuberculosis the worst thing devil could put upon me no listen to what brother random says the worst thing the devil can put upon you is fear notice how he says that the worst thing he can put upon you so what what what happens when a person Satan puts fear upon somebody fear upon some situation and he says is the worst thing the devil could put upon you if you even had a Cancer and didn't fear here and believe God would heal you you wouldn't be in a bad too bad of a shape God take care of could take care of that if you were sick whatever it is if you didn't fear if you didn't fear he says so fear is one of the worst things Satan can place upon the person now this week he says I tried and to prove it by the scripture that the man that's born again of the kingdom of God has nothing to fear you love that has nothing to fear so I want you to listen to some of these common fears as we know them as phobias so but here's the definition of fear fear inside of us is a distressing negative sensation induced by a perceived threat it is a basic survival mechanism occurring in response to a specific stimulus such as pain or the threat of danger in short fear is the ability to recognize danger leading to an urge to confront it or flee from it two big differences there and how we manage fear you either confront it or you flee from it some of us I confront it I don't ever run it leads to an urge to either confront it or to flee from it it's also known as the fight or flight response the fight or flight response but in extreme cases of fear Terror which is an extreme case of fear uh but in extreme cases of fear a freeze or paralysis response is possible so some fight it some face it some most if not all run from it and then some freeze and some lock up some go into paralysis some just never go forward one of the worst things Satan can do to you is to get you in this spot to where you're not going forward you're not going backwards you're just Frozen are you here it's a paralysis response uh and he goes on to he goes on to talk about uh uh different psychiatrists that have looked at this suggesting that fear belongs to a small or basic uh innate emotions set also includes the emotion of joy and sadness and anger fear should be dis distinguished from the related emotional state of anxiety which typically curs with any certain or immediate external threat additionally fear is frequently related to the specific behaviors of escape and avoidance and and so it's so so amazing I I I don't I did this for young people for for the for the Youth one time back home and I displayed a little video uh and it was it was such a it was hilarious if I could show it to you you'd get a good a good laugh out of it but it was it was a perfect demonstration of the fight or flight response and maybe I've told this here before but it's a video a real video of a man who was going to play a PR prank on people and so he gets inside of a a garbage can that's empty and as people come to take their trash uh and open the can as soon as they open it he's got a mask on and he just jumps out and the funniest thing is not the women who is you know terrified and jumping in fear and screaming the funniest part is the big Burly men that that literally are just immediately so scared you can just and they they they slow framed they they stopped the camera and they zoomed in oh boy I wish I had it to show you her this morning they zoomed in on some of these men's face who was very you know just very uh uh uh just refrained you know you could tell in the face is very subdued just walking into the trash can and this face that's just totally Cal immediately just in slow motion and you can almost see it goes back to a child when a child gets scared and they begin to cry and this full grown man looks like he's about to break down like a little baby and it's showing the the the flight and immediately they're they're you know they're 10 meter 10 feet behind the you know running the other direction but it's the it's it's the fight or flight uh response but one guy was very different and he goes to open that trash can and man as soon as that guy opens up it's immediate just boom and he just clocks this guy and this guy goes falling backwards and immediately gets into a boxer's pose ready to fight what was it it was immediately you're either going to fight or you're going to run oh when the Devil comes knocking and comes attacking our lives do we realize when he attacks our family our children our marriage and he attacks our marriage he attacks our home he attacks our health we're going to respond in one of two ways we're either going to take the word of God and stand up to the devil that's plaguing us or we're going to back down in in fear some of the most common fears that that that are they they did a survey and you can go and if you study any kind of uh an Google analytics you you can you can narrow down Search terms based upon what people are searching for and so they they took the analytics from data from Google search the when someone would type the fear of and they did it to aggregate all the uh information that that would that that they could call it what are the most common there were some outliers but the most common fears amongst people is the fear of ghosts the existence of evil Powers cockroaches spiders snakes I heard a sister say Amen some of you Brothers if you were honest you'd say Amen too Heights some people are afraid of heights some people so afraid of water this is a common fear some have enclosed spaces like claustrophobia the fear of tunnels the fear of bridges the fear of needles the fear of social rejection the fear of failure the fear of examinations or tests the fear but but out of all of them out of every fear the fear of flying the fear of death the fear of rejection the fear of people the fear of snakes the fear of failure the fear of driving it's amazing when you tally all this up and look at how fearful some people are but out of all of them the most common fear search the most common fear amongst people it's amazing is the fear of public speaking the fear of public speaking and it no one wants to be hurt isn't it amazing that Satan would put more emphasis on keeping a person silence than he would anything the fear of speaking in public the Bible says let the redeemed of the Lord say it again let the redeemed of the Lord say so if you're redeemed say so say so because there's importance in your words that's why brother Ram said you speak against the enemy you speak against the devil you use the words that God puts in your mouth and say I rebuke you Satan off of my children I rebuke you off of my body I rebuke you out of my mind and brother ROM says he's the high priest after your confession right not what you think not what you what what your sister Hattie WR what done any good if she brother random says anything you say uh the pro prophet of God says anything you say sister had wouldn't have done any good had she thought it but with her mouth are you with me the fear of public speaking to speak in public it it's it's it's so amazing because you look at this and and I'm just going to be real real practical here just the way the Lord led me uh here this morning but it's a amazing because most or I should say so many people are bound and they're actually we're not talking about sinful things here we're talking about gifts God puts in people's lives some people are so bound uh by fear that they're actually kept from what God has for them in their natural life because they're afraid of making a mistake because they're afraid of looking foolish they're afraid of fear that the the they're they're afraid of failure and the fear of rejection the fear of looking foolish do you know how many people will never achieve anything for the kingdom of God because they're afraid they'll look foolish in trying a powerful profound statement by a man I read it in his entire book it was just amazing and he makes a statement he says he says it's the the the the the places in the earth he says it's not the oil fields these say underneath the Earth where the oil is he says you would think that the greatest treasure in the earth is in an oil field he said it's not you think that the greatest what is the where is the greatest treasure in the earth buried if you were to go find the greatest treasure that God has given in the earth he said you won't find it in the oil field buried waiting to be tapped into you won't find it in Africa and a D in a mine somewhere waiting to be discovered it he says you won't you won't find it there he says but the greatest treasures that are buried in the earth you'll find at your local Cemetery I thought about that I thought my goodness the greatest treasures the greatest chances the greatest gifts the greatest talents gift of ministry gift of singing gift of helps the Bible speaks about all of these gifts gifts of wisdom Gifts of prayer and God has gifted the body of Christ God has gifted this body but the greatest treasures in the earth it holds back all of the treasures it would be buried in a grave because in a graveyard is the stories of of of of the gifts that God has put in someone's life that were never expressed the Bible speaks of this and it says that men's in this last day men's Hearts would fail them for fear such a paralysis such a such just such a shaking a fear you know I've I've experienced I've seen that fear first firsthand uh one time I was flying back from Edmonton and uh I was was coming back from preaching meetings and was there for for many days in the flight that morning had left it I think it was a Redeye flight 4:00 in the morning or something really really late and I was so tired and you know some people are so afraid of flying some people are just so fearful uh I mean I'm I'm serious some people just go their entire life and they've never flown in an airplane cuz they're afraid of flying I thank God I don't have that fear but but they're so afraid of of of flying said brother M can you get of course we can all become fearful but I'm talking about someone who's who's so paralyzed brother there's a brother back east and he says I'm he says I'll just admited I'd rather get in a car and drive 50 hours than get in a plane and two hours to be here he said I'm just he's terrified he says I I guess I took Jesus seriously when he said lo I Am With You Always and he was serious he was really scared and I took this flight back and this this young lady right beside me I was on the in the window seat and I hate the window seat worse than any seat uh you say he heard it worse than the than the middle no I I would have rather sit in the middle because at least I could not off and go to sleep but the the window seat and so this man's on the aisle This Woman's in the middle and I'm I'm on the in the window and I'm so tired I'm just wanting to go to wanting to go to sleep have you ever just wanted to go to sleep and you'd almost pay to go to sleep be able to to fall asleep and and it's just so you just want even on a plane you know you're wanting to to get plain I call it plain sleep and and I'm just wanting to fall asleep you know and I'm just noty not and I remember the flight oh boy here it comes when the captain's coming we haven't even taken off didn't push back and This Woman's talking to this man and she's just so nervous this is my first time flying I'm so scared and I just I don't know what to expect and I you know and I i' I've watched you know she started talking about how that she's watched these uh uh or seen these plane crash videos and and now I'm thinking why in the world would you afraid of flying you go watch that and so so she she's talking about how scared she is and and I'm just sitting here you know not just you can't help but you're listening right beside you and I'm not really taking part to sort of you know just thinking about the services and and they're over here just going he's he's trying oh no ma'am he says you you have nothing to worry about you know uh there's nothing to be scared of you know and she said well I'm just so worried about what it's going to take you know a little bit of turbulence and and that's just going to scare me out as bright as hope it's a smooth light and man they're just really going talking and so we go to and I'm thinking oh great you know you want to make me miserable uh put me beside someone that's scared of flying you make yourself you make you almost start getting scared yourself and she's so afraid of flying it almost puts thoughts in your mind like what's going to happen you know and and and so she's just going on and on and on and on and on about this and I'm thinking oh Lord just help me go to sleep please let me just fall fast asleep and so they we get up in the air and he takes off and the take off is smooth the whole time I mean I've never really I i' sort of in the my peripher had seen her and I could tell she's really scared like this isn't a put on she's really nervous and so we go to take off just a little bit more and then we get up to her chrisian altitude and and and and every little just I mean little bitty noticeable turb she would immediately say what was that what was that and and he would and and she'd get scared and he'd and and you could just tell she was just you know Breathing heavily and and and he starts oh no no it's it's just normal and you know the turbulence is just normal just a little bit you know uh uh air air winds that are blowing across the he's trying to get into the you know the science of turbulence with her and I'm just listening here just comes a little bit more what was that what was that you know what was that and and and and and he's just going on and so finally I remember uh they're talking and just go I'm having trouble so finally I spoke up and said man I said listen I've flown I start toing all the places in the world I've traveled I said I've flown you know and I start at that time I knew the statistics Delta they fly you know this many flights and there's the statistics of getting you know all the stories you get More's chances struck by light more chance of all this and I'm giving her all these statistics and you know and I'm really thinking man I'm really winning you know she's really she's getting this it's PE I could see the peace coming down upon her and she's coming and just coming okay okay I think I'm fine and I'm thinking oh Lord please let me just go to sleep and I'll never forget I finally just dozed off just where you just sort of you you're in that sleep and and everything's gone and you know and I don't know what happened we must have hit some turbulent bump and I'm not kidding you out of nowhere she grabs my arm and she says are we gonna be okay and I literally woke up went I don't know just as louder than her I said I don't know and and and I look and there's people everyone's turning around now no one looked at her but they're all looking at me like what's this guy's problem and I'm just you know trying to calm down you ever been woken up by your wife in the middle of the night when she hears a sound it's never a little gentle hey honey it's always wake up and it's just immediate you're Jed what's happening and you think someone's G to be standing over your your bed ready to kill you and that's how this was it just Jed me and what was that and she looked at me she said like I'm so I'm so sorry needless to say I did not sleep the rest of that flight I just stayed with her and she was but I you know it's a funny story and laughter's laughter is a good medicine right but it it's amazing because out of all of that I begin the Lord begin to deal with me and the Lord began to say you know when you take this flight of life there's something amazing about flying it's it's maybe most of the time I can just tell you from fly most of the time you never even see the Pilot's face before you get on the plane never see him you definitely don't get to know him unless you're you know some lucky have some privilege you don't get to find out unless they announce it you don't know if he's a novice did he get out of training today has he been a veteran is you know you don't know any of that you just put your trust in someone you've never met you put your trust in someone you've never seen most likely you don't know and the entire flight they're behind a closed door you never hear them you never you never see them you never have a conversation when there's a turbulent moment you can't say hey Captain is everything okay is that normal but you've put your trust in order to fly you have to put your trust in somebody who's invisible to you and the Lord begin to to to to to speak to me and say in this life you've got to put your trust not just your life but you got to put your your wife's life your children's life your family's life you've got to put everything that's important and dear to you because if you don't you're going to live like that woman you're going to be in constant fear and constant anxiety and and Afraid and every little turbulence that comes in life and every little uncertainty and you're not so sure you'll question everything and and and and doubt and fear will begin to paralyze you is anybody here today but God says do you trust me have you put your life or are you grappled and and Paralyzed by fear to every situation every problem or do you know I've got it all under control and I'm the pilot of your life not just your but your entire family I'm in control of the turns I'm in control of the turbulence the Bible says this about the Lord David said in Psalms he says he's the Lord who sth upon the flood you ever caught that before I'm the Lord who sth upon not in not of but I'm on top of I'm on top of the flood I put my throne here it say I got a flood in my life he's the Lord who sth upon your flood I've got a fire in my life he's the Fourth Man in the middle of your fire I'm drowning he's the one uh reaching a hand to pull you up out of the water Peter do you trust him do you have faith to face your your fear a captain at every moment who's in control you know what's so reassuring so reassuring if you ever flown you go through a a lot of turbulence and you're wondered and people almost start looking at each other like I don't know is this normal and you know what's going on everybody looks calm I guess it's normal and you're you're you're you're you're startled because of something maybe going through a storm there's nothing ever more reassuring than hearing the captain hello ladies and gentlemen this is your captain speaking from the flight deck little bit of turbulence here we're going to try to go up to a little few thousand feet higher to get out of this there's nothing more why why because you hear the captain's voice and sometimes in life there's nothing more reassuring than saying Lord let me just hear your voice if I could just hear you speak in the middle of all the turbulence if I could just hear the captain come on and say it's going to be okay it's going to be okay child I've got this under control a little bit of turbulence in life but I'm going to steer us to a little bit of smoother air we're going to get you on the ground safely and oh when you land and when you finally land and that plane lands and you hear those breaks and the flaps kick in and it's slowing down all of that fear and all of that anxiety and all of that worry and everything you turn your phone on everything's back to normal oh my brother and my sister do you know the amount of relief that you'll experience that your loved one experienced uh when their life came to an in when their flight settled down all they were free from all fear they were free from all anxiety they were free from all pain all worry because their flight had landed safely and let me give you the words of the master this morning your flight's going to land safely you're going to make it to your destination oh can somebody take a hold of that this morning you're going to make it it may not feel like it now it may look hopeless now but I'm going to make it no matter what I go through no matter what I'm experiencing here's my confidence Jesus is my pilot and he'll sell every every every raging wave he'll guide me through and I'll make it to my destination I'm GNA make it oh take confidence this morning you're going to make it your children are going to make it your family's going to make it that problem's going to make it I'm going to make it he's already said that I would Daniel in Daniel 3 turn there in your Bible we don't have much longer Daniel chapter 3 brother Diggs would say I'm about to close Daniel chapter 3 I want you to notice this here this is this is powerful and it's what the Lord really placed upon my heart so just bear with me just a minute we're going to land soon just stay calm Daniel chapter 3 I want you to put it uh brother um Jeremy on the screen if you could Lord just Quicken this to my heart and I it's really really where my heart's at this morning Daniel chapter 3 I just want to I just want you to read here and just just start at verse one uh brother wonderful let me get it here so I want you just to read this here with me this is very familiar Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold whose height was three score cubits and the breadth thereof six cubits and he set it up in the plane of dura in the province of Babylon then an arrow I want you to just follow me along if you could just Advance it uh verse two brother Jeremy then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent together the princes the the governors the captains the judges the treasurers the counselors the sheriffs all the rulers of the provinces to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the King has set up so all the important people all of the all the most prominent are there then the princes the governors captains judges Treasures counselors sheriffs rulers provinces were gathered together in the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up verse four then an Aral cried aloud this is this is this is a decree from the King then in Herald cried aloud to you it is commanded oh people Nations and languages he says that at what time you hear the sound of the Cornet the flute the harp all of these beautiful instruments is going to have an entire stage of instruments all it says all kinds of music You Fall Down and Worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the King has has set up uh he says and who so falleth not down and worshipthe same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace verse seven just keep going therefore at the time when the people heard the sound of the Cornet the flute the harp sack with suttry and all kinds of music and all the people the Nations languages fell down and worshiped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up so everyone everyone in unison bows down now of course these were these were uh H Babylonians here they they had 30 gods in the trunk of their car this was just another it wasn't anything for them to Bow oh it's all they did in their entire life was to Bow Down and Worship right but but there's only this entire decree is not in other words the fear and and the intimidation that the devil that Nebuchadnezzar has set up is only there to afflict three people the whole system the whole stage the whole world no one is going to have a problem going with the the flow except three Jewish boys who's been taught who's been raised who's been raised differently in fact their names he Shadrach Meek and abedo are not even their names that's the names that he uh Nebuchadnezzar renames them there their hananiah and mishel and Azariah was their Hebrew names and their names have totally different meanings completely different but he names them this and he says he says you're to bow down and so now the Bible says here and he says and and just keep going he verse 8 wherefore at a certain time certain chians came near and accused the Jews verse 9 they spake and said to the Nebuchadnezzar oh King live forever thou oh King has made a decree that every man that shall hear the sound of the Corn now all the music shall follow Down and Worship the image verse 11 and who so falleth not down and worship that he should be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace there are certain Jews whom thou set over the Affairs of the province of Babylon Shadrach Meshach and abedo these men oh King have have not regarded thee they serve not thy Gods nor worship the golden image which thou has set up verse 13 the Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach meach and abedo then they brought these men before the King Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said unto them now notice how he says this here's this great you know High dignified King and he says really really is it is it true is it true a shadra mhach and abedo that do you not serve my gods nor worship the golden image which I have set up in other words are you are you kidding me guys really you're going to make here's my celebration my dedication and and you imagine boy you'd stand out everybody bowing and three guys you're still standing stand out like a sore thumb he says is is it true now in other words let's forget about it let's pretend that didn't happen Okay let's just pretend you made a mistake there now if if if you be ready that at what time you hear the sound of the Cornet the flute the harp the sac Sury the doer all the kinds of music You Fall Down and Worship the image which I have made well in other words good other words it's going to be good for you if you do that that's a good thing well he says if you fought down but if you worship not you shall be cast that same hour into the midst of a burning burning fire look at the intimidation you shall be cast into a burning fiery furnace and who and who is that God how maniacal who is that God that shall deliver you you out of my hands notice the entire atmosphere is set up for fear the entire atmosphere is intimidation the entire atmosphere is pressure you live our young people old people alike we live in this age of of music that is playing it's a rhythm that the rest of the world is marching to and there's an intimidation to bow down there's an intimidation to compromise there's an intimidation the entire atmosphere is to trip you up is it true and if you okay guys just play the music again start it up again Guys these guys just made a a mistake he says but if you don't who who's that God now notice verse 16 Shadrach mesach and abedo answered and said to the king oh Nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to answer thee in this matter let me give you modern day English when I was growing up talk to the hand if you go if you go and read out translations that's exactly what they said we we don't even you don't even deserve an answer this was the faith of the children of God I'm not even going to talk to you I'm not even going to reason sometimes we make our biggest mistake when we start reasoning and talking with the devil and trying to reason things well I think maybe I can give a little here I guess I could compromise I won't be too bad the shadra m check and abedo said we don't you don't even deserve an answer we don't we're not under we're not subservient to you we're not of your kingdom this is what you ought to tell the devil you don't deserve my time you don't deserve an answer you don't even deserve my attention verse 17 this is where their faith stood if it be so our God whom we serve remember when you asked who's that God who's going to live you here's my faith here's my testimony Our God who we serve is able to Deliver Us From The Burning fiery furnace and he will deliver us out of thine hand oh King can you have that kind of faith in your hearts today to say no matter what the what the world says what the doctor says my God is able to deliver me my God is more than enough my God is able and he will now let me pause we're going to close let me stop and say to you something maybe that's going to surprise you verse no uh verse 17 verse 17 if it be so our God is able a god whom we serve is able to Deliver Us From The Burning Fire furnace know delivers let me just say this that's really really easy that's really easy to have that kind of Faith now I want you to take whatever whatever it is here no matter what what you're facing God the Holy Spirit directed me told me to preach this so somebody's here you take that that Calamity you take that problem you take that issue you take that no matter what it is no matter what you came here with today and let me just say to you verse 17 Faith is easy it's easy it's easy to have that kind of it's common faith our God who I serve is able to deliver me my God's able to fix it my God's able to heal it my God's able to save my God's able to deliver and that's what my faith says my brother my sister that is not the kind of fa Faith verse 17 Faith is not faith that faces fear let me show you what is Verse 18 this is the kind of faith we need but if not but if not think about that think about what they were saying what their faith was projecting Our God verse 17 our God is able and he will but here's faith that faces and defeats fear here's faith that rebukes the enemy here's the kind of faith that shuts the mouth of the devil here's the kind of faith that silences his Whispers And His words upon your life even if not in other words even if he doesn't even if what Shadrach even if he doesn't show up in the fire and I perish by the fire even if it doesn't happen here's what my faith says but if not be it known in other words this was not this was for for for Shadrach M and abedo this is a firm answer this isn't a shaky answer this is this is something it was a principle it shows you their mind was made up and that it was with them it was a matter that was already over that even if he doesn't deliver me make sure you know this Satan make sure you know this make sure you hear it come out of my mouth we will not serve your Gods we will not worship the golden image which thou has set up be it known make sure you know it Satan that even if I go through the fire and I perish even if God doesn't heal me that doesn't mean he's not a Healer even if God doesn't save me that doesn't mean he's not a savior can I get an amen this morning even if he doesn't deliver me that changes nothing about my faith can you do that to today friend can you say that to the Lord Lord it doesn't matter it doesn't change anything the prophet of God said even if he sends me to hell even if he sends me to Hell he's done enough for me for the rest of my life to thank him and to praise him this is the faith that meets The Impossible and you know what happened because they got to verse 18 Faith verse 19 comes then was Nebuchadnezzar full of Fury you want to make the devil mad have Verse 18 Faith because Satan always looks at symptoms he always says I do this and how do they respond I attack them here and their hands go down their mouth Zips they don't worship they don't praise see know what it does he keeps working he keeps pushing he keeps pressuring what makes the devil mad is in spite of your Calamity in spite of your disease in spite of your fear in spite of whatever you go through somehow you raise your hands and Worship the Lord somehow in spite of all of the Calamity somehow somehow in spite of how dark and impossible it looks in spite of the the the edge that I'm about to go over I'm raising my hand saying Lord you're worthy of my praise he was full of Fury changed musicians come Meshach and abedo therefore he spoke and commanded them that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it want to be heated verse 20 and he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach Meshach and ab been to go and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace verse 21 then these men were Bound in their coats their hos and their hats their garments or the garments were cast into the mid of the burning fiery furnace therefore because the king's commandment was urgent and the furnace exceedingly hot notice this the the the furnace exceedingly hot the Flames of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach mhach and abedo and these three men same specific that the writer says specifically and these three here's those same three men Shadrach Meshach and abedo fell down Bound in the midst of the burning fiery furnace play something if you could then Nebuchadnezzar the King was your grace still amazes me if you have that was astonished rose up in haste and spoke and said to his counselors did not we cast up with fear bound them up we wrapped them up with anxiety we wrapped them up in their mind with that impossible doct we gave him that doctor's report looked impossible didn't we bind him didn't we throw him in didn't we bind them with it trip them up with every kind of problem and and it looked hopeless then we let them give all of their efforts only just to find out it wasn't going to work anyways didn't we do all that didn't we bind them up in their minds didn't we take away their job didn't we take away their children isn't there children in the world doesn't it did we not make it look [Music] hopeless how many has the devil done that to like a punching B like a punching bag made it look so hopeless did we not they answered and said unto the king true yeah oh King verse 25 he answered and said lo I see four men and here's the key loose loose I don't see one man man that's like the Son of God and three bound men now that the fourth man has showed up in the middle of the fire they're all free they're all loose all the bondage is gone all of the anxiety all the pressure the depression all of the distress and perplexity I see four men loose walking not down not on their knees they're going forward they're marching on they're walking in the middle of the fire and they have no hurt oh someone say praise the Lord and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God can you stand to your feet this morning could you raise your hand and say Lord I accept I accept the freedom that's in Christ I accept the Freedom From Fear I accept it this morning I accept freedom from worry freedom from anxiety freedom from phobia I want to worship you in the way you made me Unbound I want to serve you loose Lord I Want To Worship You loose loose loose free Unbound [Music] Unbound you know what faith says every head bowed every eye [Music] closed what was what was that Faith verse 17 Our God's able we can we've had that kind of Faith you've had that kind of faith but can you sayl give me verse 18 because true true worship True Religion real true service to God it's not a it's not a it's not an and if it's not about an outcome it's not about a result it's a determined purpose Shadrach meso said I'm determined be it known no matter what happens in my life I will not serve you I will not bow down I'll go to my grave with till my last dying breath saying he's a Healer he's a savior he's a redeemer he's a friend he's an encourager he's a brother he's he fills in the Gap when there's a void in my life whatever may be the consequence it matters not what follows got the challenge before me and let me say to you Lord doesn't matter what follows whether it's wealth or poverty honor dishonor
