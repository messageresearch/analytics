tonight as I open this Bible and father give me the wisdom be able to bring it forth to the people in Jesus name I pray amen God bless you all you can take your seats thank you I believe in study in this book of Acts I believe friends that were doing the right thing praying about it today and and I feel like the Lord wants us to understand his word better we've been given so much and I think taking a little time on Wednesday night for a Bible study like we've been doing I think that it will benefit the body of Christ this portion of the body of Christ and what better of a place to start then this book of Acts right after the Holy Spirit came this is what happened Acts we have we talked about Acts chapter 15 last week a couple times we talked about how that the Galatians that there were troublemakers that came in and caused problems and and Paul wrote this this letter to the Galatians addressing the same thing that was going on there in Acts chapter 15 they happened at the same time so now we went through 16 and we now we're in 17. and let's start the best place to start with verse one brother Eli sister Kendall God bless you good good to have you in service tonight I think that's all the visitors that we have now when they had passed through amphipolis and Apollonia they came to thessalonica where was the synagogue of the Jews and Paul as his manner was went unto them and three Sabbath days reasoned with them about the scriptures three Sabbath days is how long yes three weeks so Paul was there for three weeks in this place called thessalonica now thessalonica is the capital of this place called Macedonia where heard in the last chapter that that Paul got this Macedonian call to go to Macedonia he is now in Macedonia and in this city called thessalonica under the now thessalonica was was like a capital and under the Roman Empire which is basically everywhere that we talk about in the book of Acts it was all under this Roman rule there was a significant population of Jews in this city called thessalonica it was a population Center Center it was well traveled and because it was there was a large Jewish population it made a perfect place to put a church and this church could reach out to the neighboring communities and it would be a place also for the apostles to stop and to rest with a with a Church of fellow Christians there so Paul came to this city of thessalonica and remember now Paul is starting to go to the Gentiles but most of the places that we talk about most of the people we talk about are actually Jewish Christians the the Gentiles were they were kind of outside and we're going to see the message going more to them but we see so far many or most of the Gentiles that have been converted to Christianity were people that were already converted to a limited extent to Judaism you'll see in here that that there's many times like in I believe it was Cornelius that it says this and others that this man feared God which means that he had one God which means he was now being introduced to a monotheistic religion a religion that had one God which was the Jewish religion so many of these Gentiles that are now coming to the Lord have already been introduced to the Jewish faith as far as worshiping one God so it's it's a natural progression that's happened but we're going to see coming up into the end of this chapter that now everyone even these Heathen even these Idol worshiping Gentiles they start to come to the message of Christ so Paul as it says here that that he went to this thessalonica for three weeks in preaching the gospel and we need to remember that so often we just want to give someone a track or brother Jonathan we want to just witness to them and say well I planted the seed and then go and and then say well if they're pretty estimated seed of God or if they're a child of God then they're then they'll accept it well no that's not what Paul did here Paul stayed there and we have to be willing if we are witnessing to someone even if it's our children whoever it is a new friend we don't just throw it at them and run away we stay with it and just because it doesn't come right away doesn't mean that that it's not going to come eventually there's been many many people that on their Deathbed they remembered the Lord Jesus someone telling them about the Lord Jesus and they were able to reach out and right before they died the lord gave them that opportunity to give their heart to Jesus now Paul had this attitude where he was he was going to stay with it he was going to preach to these people and and even if they disagree with us friends and they may say hurtful things it's okay it's all right keep your testimony continue to talk about the Lord in love greet these people in love and treat them with love that's the way that you will win this soul to Christ now other people as we're going to see here they needed Doctrine maybe a more intellectual person maybe a more black and white person says well I need to see it here I was I don't know like six five six seven years ago there was a Catholic priest his name was Bill Boehner I believe it was his name in Jeffersonville and and uh relative of mine introduced me to him and uh nice guy we got along well I would I would communicate with him every once in a while and he got older he retired from the priesthood and uh Roman Catholic priest continued talking with me and uh he got old and he um pretty soon he can walk he's in a wheelchair we asked to see me one day so I I went down and met him in the office there and we talked for a while and a Catholic priest friends they're educated they're bright and they know this Bible as well as any of us do yeah and we were talking and he started asking questions he started asking about well what about salvation and I remember I was talking on Sunday about a workspace salvation that's Catholicism they believe you work yourself to heaven and we we talked a lot about Grace and and he just took it in and he listened a lot and the more we talked that day the more I could see the reason why that he came and he sought me out and at the end of our conversation he said you know he said Catholicism is wrong he said it doesn't line up with the Bible and he said he said I believe I believe this message that you're talking about I believe this Jesus Christ and another thing and I don't know how I could have done it different but he said I think I should be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and then brother Ernie died he died right like within a couple days and I thought well should I have taken him right then no the lord it's okay there was a thief on the cross that gave his heart to the Lord he didn't get baptized it's all right that was that Catholic priest way to go but it took time and it wasn't just me that that was witnessing to him it was it was a family member that I had and she was she she would um talk to him about the Lord and talk to him about about the Bible and and he got he got hungry to see where all this was coming from and then he came to me to work to someone that could talk the word with him and that's the way he needed it he didn't need he didn't need Miracles he didn't need all of this this other stuff that most people maybe need he wanted to see it in this book and if he saw it in that book he believed it he was a child of God and the Lord I believe that the Lord saved that man in his old age thank God for that experience that I had now here as I've said before that every sermon pretty much every sermon in the New Testament certainly every sermon in the book of Acts is about one thing Jesus Christ and Paul preaches a sermon here that uh it starts in verse 3 and we only get one sentence of it but in one sentence it gives us a little synopsis of what Paul had preached which and this sermon that he preached led to a powerful Church being formed in that city of thessalonica such a great church he wrote two letters to this church first and second Thessalonians and if you go and read those those um letters you can see now oh this is where that was formed this is the group of people right now we're in the infant stage of this church and later on Paul corresponds back to them and writes back to them some of the most encouraging scriptures and all of the New Testament are in first and second Thessalonians here's Paul here's the synopsis of his sermon and Paul as it his manner was when and unto them and three Sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures opening and alleging that Christ must needs have suffered and risen again from the dead and that this Jesus whom I preach unto you is Christ now remember his audience they are Jewish Christians and Gentile converted Christians that that were familiar with the Jewish religion let me read again verse 3 it says opening and alleging that Christ must needs have suffered and risen again from the dead and that this Jesus whom I preached to you is Christ now Paul is introducing these people in the synagogue to Christ and he probably used scriptures like Psalm like the Psalms Jesus often referred to the Psalms Paul knowing that these Jewish Christians knowing that these Jewish people that they knew the Bible they knew the Old Testament we can see here that Paul probably quoted the Old Testament to them I'm sure he did as I said we don't have his his sermon here but he probably he was talking about a resurrection he was talking about suffering let's psalm 16 9 he's he probably quoted something like this David prophet of God therefore my heart is glad and my glory rejoices My Flesh also shall shall Rest In Hope for thou Wilt not leave my soul in Hell neither without suffer thy Holy Holy One to to see corruption Paul probably brought that scripture out of the Old Testament and say now do you know what this is this is that Christ that we've been talking about Psalm 49 14. like sheep they are laid in the grave Death Shall feed on them and the upright shall have dominion over over them in the morning and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling but God will redeem my soul from the power of the Grave for he shall receive me Selah Paul was quoting things like this saying you study the Bible this is what he it says about him this is what happened he was raised from the dead according to the power of God he's telling these Jews in the synagogues because the blood of Jesus Christ and his resurrection that we all too can receive that same resurrection that Jesus had and redeem our souls from sin so you can imagine how these Jews are listening like wow this is good going back to the Psalms and all of these scriptures that that we've read and we have learned in the Seminary or whatever the the uh I don't know what you call a Jewish school but but they would learn these things and then the Apostle says oh and here's the Fulfillment of that in Jesus Christ I want to read a couple more scriptures Jonah 1 17. now the Lord had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah and Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights then then Jesus quotes this in Matthew chapter 12 verse 38 then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered and said Master we would see a sign from thee but he answered and said unto them and evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign and there shall no sign be given to it but the sign of the Prophet jonahs for as Jonas was in was three days and three nights in the whale's belly so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the Earth can you imagine this apostle speaking things like this to these learned theologians and these these church members and and saying that do you know the story of Jonah this was a type of what happened to Christ and he died and there were people alive at that time that witnessed it and telling these people and converting this church at thessalonica verse 4 and some of them believed and consorted with Paul and Silas and out of The Devout Greeks a great multitude and of the chief women not a few but the Jews which believe not moved with Envy took unto them a certain lewd fellows of the base or sword and gathered a company and set all the city on an uproar and assaulted the house of Jason and sought to bring them out to the people telling my wife I think we're maybe on on the way over here that in studying this book of Acts this has been such an incredible blessing to me because I see over and over again the opposition to the gospel is those people religious people that have their way of thinking and they are not willing to open their minds to something new because they they're afraid to accept anything because that would mean maybe that they're wrong so they'll bring everything that they can against it happens over and over again happen through all the gospels happens through the book of Acts it happens to the whole new testament and we see it all the time today it's it's a fear that maybe this something new doesn't line up with the way I've been taught over and over again now it says this that they assaulted the house of Jason and sought to bring out bring them out to the people now who is this guy Jason we don't see him before and we really don't see him after so this guy Jason we've never heard of him and after the next few verses that we're going to read we never hear of him really again it's most likely this guy Jason was probably a Jewish convert who was converted to Christianity by the Apostle Paul he was probably fairly wealthy as you'll you'll you'll read because he hosted all three of them in his house Paul and Silas probably Timothy and probably more in his house and as we read he was able to post bail or some sort of a bond for them when they got thrown in jail when when all the people were coming against him he was able to front some money to say okay well here's some money and if we cause any damage maybe that you can pay for it out of this or something he was able to put up money for some reason so they went to find him and Jason's Allison when they found them not they drew Jason and a certain of the Brethren under the rulers of the city crying these that have turned the world upside down or come hither also I think turn the world upside down is a good way to put it brother Branham said what man calls great God calls foolish what God calls great man calls foolish and this new religion of these Christians was complete opposite of everything everyone had learned I think that there was a lot of Prosperity Gospel going on for Generations back then and it's basically how can God serve me and it's it's a workspace Holiness so then this this new um religion comes in and it's more like how much can you give away how much can you serve others if somebody smacks you in the face brother Jonathan let them smack the other side if somebody takes your coat give them your other garment too if if somebody sues you in the law just drop it don't let it happen all of these things that were never the case a completely opposite religion that everyone had been taught it says this whom Jason had received and all these do contrary now they're talking about Jason and they're talking about these people who Jason had received and all of these do contrary to the decrees of Caesar saying that there is another king one Jesus look at the Same Spirit right here remember who's talking these are Jews do you think the Jews supported Caesar the ruler the one that would crucify them on on the roads just because they were Jews the one that would that would order them beaten and their land taken away and tax collectors to go out and take all of their money do you think they loved Caesar but they sure loved him when it came to Paul it's hypocritical we see it the same way any time something doesn't line up exactly with the way I think all of a sudden you support Caesar all of a sudden you support the president all of a sudden you support whatever it is just because you want to save your way of thinking and when they troubled the people and the rules rulers of the city when they had heard these things and when they had taken security of Jason and of the others they let them go when I said taken the security that's that's the money that they paid so Jason had enough money to put up this Bond and then they said okay well you can go and the Brethren immediately sent Away Paul and Silas By Night unto Berea Who coming to their went into the synagogue of the Jews now this place Berea isn't too far from thessalonica it's it's probably a mile or two away so it's almost a suburb of thessalonica and again they went into the synagogue of the Jews so they again go to the church remember as I said there were no churches back then they were just these these synagogues of there were no Christian churches there was these Jewish synagogues and then there were these Heathen idolatrous temples he didn't really want to go in there and preach so really the Jewish temples they were the Jewish synagogues they were pretty much the only game in town if you were a minister so you would you would greet the rabbi as was their custom they would invite you because you're a visiting minister they would invite you to come in and exhort to the people so a church would generally get started among the Jewish population then they would receive the revelation of Christ they would put away their old legalistic thinking like in Acts 15 in Galatians and they would go out and win Gentile souls to Christ that's how Christian churches formed these were more noble now these are these are Berea these were more noble than those at thessalonica in that they received the word with all Readiness of mind and searched the Scriptures Daily whether those things were so other translations say there were more fair-minded than those in thessalonica and these bereans appreciate their attitude I appreciate their spirit so we see Paul and Silas and Timothy they come in they start preaching this gospel and as I I talked about some of the Psalms and about Jonah and about what Jesus said about Jonah and Matthew they they listened intently and they didn't just out doesn't doesn't line up with what I'm thinking doesn't line up with the way I've been taught they didn't act like that they said well let me let me study on this for a little while so so they would they would present the word to them so these bereans then they would go and they'd open up the Scrolls and they'd start studying well he said this what does it say here and as Isaiah that aversion shock and Steve what does it say here in these other scriptures that they say are pertaining to Christ and they checked they checked it with the word and I think that it should be both ways so when someone presents the word to us like the bereans we don't automatically put it out but then we also have to be careful that we don't automatically brother Jonathan accept it either just because it comes from the pulpit does not mean that it's right don't ever forget that of course if if it's a man of God you never ever want to be found guilty of bringing something that's not true but these bereans set a very good example that they were testing everything that they heard with these scriptures which is exactly how we should be then in Berea there therefore many of them believed also also of honorable women which were Greeks and of men not a few but when the Jews of thessalonica remember the the big city down the road but when the Jews of thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea remember he snuck out of thessalonica they came tether also and stirred up the people there so this word traveled quickly on this road and the same thing that happened in thessalonica I'll bet you Paul got so frustrated with these Jews that were supposed to be God's people the same thing that happened in thessalonica just earlier and after he spent three weeks and breaking down these scriptures and presenting the Lord Jesus in in a way that they could understand these same people walked down the road and started doing it in Berea started causing problems there starting started stirring up the people and then immediately same thing the Brethren sent Away Paul to go as it were to the Sea but Silas and timotheus Abode there still so now he gets kicked out of of thessalonica he goes to Berea it's like oh this is a breath of fresh air and then these same dudes come over from from thessalonica and start causing problems again so then that same thing happens Paul takes off the Brethren send them away and they that conducted Paul brought him to Athens and receiving a commandment unto Silas and timotheus for to come up to him with all speed they Departed now Athens was the capital of the Greek Empire Athens was a place it was conquered by Rome 100 or so years earlier but it was permitted to keep its culture and most of its independence so Athens really was the heart of the Greek culture now why while Paul waited for them at Athens his Spirit was stirred in him when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry what a scripture you know I think about how many of us walk around Tucson Arizona drive around and see what this city has become see the filth on the street see the the drug abuse going on and and and see just the immorality among among things and I work on campus at the U of AC looking and see that what that place really stands for everything against God and walking around I can see Paul he's walking down the street and there were literally thousands of idols as he's walking along and and going through and and seeing this is Zeus and this is Mars and this is all of these different Greek gods just everywhere and we walking around and how it should grieve us to see the sin and the Sea really the idolatry that surrounds us maybe think that we can relate to Paul I think maybe Paul also and I'll take this more upon myself as I see really a failure in the churches of today I see that we look at all of this sin going on all of this drug abuse brother Arnie and I are constantly witnessing to to these drug addicts that come walking by and I see what a failure these people when they were young they should have been in church it would have helped them but every one that I talked to their parents weren't in their lives as young people their parents didn't go to church every single one of them really without exception they did not have a family that was part of a Christian Community like we are and I really believe I believe it's a failure in the churches and we need to change that even if it's just this little group right here we need to continue to reach out because by the time that they get to be 18 years old are any of the people I was witnessing to out there the other day it was it was a girl and a guy the girl I think was 28 the guy was about the same age I said how did you get here they had the same story well my my parents weren't in my life I was living my aunt I was living my uncle the girl is 18 years old when she got when she got put out on the streets 10 years she had been living on these streets she looked terrible teeth were rotted out from the drugs she was a sunburned as you could be because you fell asleep out in the Sun and I asked him I said what what's how did you how did you get here and they said well it's drugs there was always a gateway drug too which was usually marijuana and the other guy said for him it was Ritalin it was it was a drug that they give a lot to the young people sister Angel you probably know a lot more about it than I do and he said that there's these gateway drugs and he says then you get hooked and I said well do you want to get off of the drug they don't they want it and that is the biggest problem if they would have been taught right as young people if they would have been in a church that loved them that's key with not just with their parents but with all of us that reach out to these young people and love them take care of them would do anything for them not just parents but all of us they wouldn't be in that situation and I was talking with them and I was telling them I said you know the Lord Jesus Takes these things away and and they're like yeah yeah yeah yeah and I'm talking with these these this this guy and this girl and they said well can we use the the hose bib over here and I said yeah you know whatever so they go over there and I'm I'm still trying to preach to them and and I didn't know behind me on the other side of the wall right there there were two young ladies and I'm facing this way and they're back there and one of them says are you the pastor of the church and it scared me I said oh I didn't I didn't know you were there and um I said yeah and and she said well um we were catholic but we never went to church and I said well where do you live do you how are your parents well my my parents um you know we don't live I don't live with my parents and I said how about you and there was a 14 year old there was a 16 year old and the 16 year old says well I live with her and the 14 year old says yeah well we live with my aunt and I looked at him and I said look at these two people right here I said that is how you will end up if you don't change this cycle that's in your life I said do you want to be like that and they said no I said let me ask you this I could tell they were good kids I said do you want to have a family both of them said yeah I want a big family I said do you want to meet a good boy that'll be a good husband to you both of them said yeah that's what we want that's what I want talking with these young ladies and I could see that they did not want that but they're put in this place of Just Pure Evil how do we get them out they need a place to go they need a church and I asked the congregation to pray for them today this morning that they would follow up with coming and if they come to church like anyone else if there is somebody here you don't recognize love them greet them do not let them out of this church without giving them the right hand of Fellowship without talking to them without showing them love because you have no idea where they're going to be you have no idea where they're going to end up and if you can stop that cycle and most of the time it's not me preaching salvation it's not it's showing that you care Paul here what are the motives of the Apostle Paul do you think it's to build his church no it's for these people that were stuck in idolatry therefore Paul disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews and with devout persons and in the market daily with them that met with him like in thessalonica he was willing to put in the time but this time Paul's not just going into the synagogues he's walking along and there's all this weirdness going on maybe all these drug addicts like we see and Paul was willing to talk any time about the Lord he was willing to witness any time about the word Lord it says here it says he disputed in the synagogues with devout persons and in the market even daily all the time talking about the Lord Jesus so the gospel is not just preached in the churches the gospel is preached in our homes to our children the gospel is preached in the grocery store in the Market at work everywhere we go the gospel is preached and some of you young sisters you preach the Gospel wherever you go just by your own testimony they see you they think there's something special about this person and you've been asked how many times have you been asked all of you sisters what religion are you is it common of course it's common us Brothers should have the same thing as to us we should have such a spirit that people look at us and they say there is something special about that man then certain philosophers of the epicureans and of the stoics encountered him and some said what will this babbler say now these are true gentiles these aren't Jewish converts these are the guys that are bowing down to Zeus and all the other thousands of idols and have no idea about a one God religion then certain of the philosophers of the epicureans and the stoics encountered him and some said what will this babbler say and some and others said he seemeth to be a set or forth of strange Gods because he preached unto them Jesus and the red and the resurrection now these epicureans and the stoics they were philosophers they followed a certain line of thought about by this man Epicurious and this other man Zeno both of them Greek philosophers brother Aaron um obviously was getting ahead and and was reading in the book of Acts and he found this note on who these two people were was this John Wesley so this is a quote from John Wesley some of the air Epicurean and stoic philosophers the epicureans entirely denied a Providence and held the and held the world to be the effect of mere chance asserting sensual pleasure to be man's Chief good and that the soul and body died together all right so this man Epicurious he was saying live as good as you can in this life because this is the this there's nothing on the other side the stoics held that matter was that matter was eternal and that all things were governed by irresistible fate and that virtue was its own sufficient reward and vice was its own sufficient punishment so we see two idolaters on different sides here one's a little bit more moral the other one is is just eat drink and be merry for tomorrow we die thank you for that and they took him Paul and they took him and brought him to the areopagus saying may we know what this new Doc maybe we know what this new doctrine where of thou speakest is for thou bring us certain strange things to our ears we would know therefore what these things mean for all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else but either to tell or to hear something new now this areopagus is it's a big rock out crop on the top of Mars Hill in Athens so they bring him up here and this is the place that they would debate these things these philosophical debates so here are a bunch of men a bunch of probably men who like to discuss philosophy and religion but would never do anything about it and I'll tell you I was telling my wife on the way over here that growing up I got kind of scarred by that type of thing when I was little I was hearing all of dad and all the brothers would get together and and I'd listen they were talking about all of these things the third poll the son of man Ministry and you know what about the seventh seal is the seventh seal revealed or not what about the seven thunders in 1977 and 1963 and about the fivefold ministry and about the tent meeting and in my opinion don't hate me but it's the same Spirit as they had up on Mars Hill let's just talk about it and discuss these things and brother nothing ever happened nothing ever happened with them and nothing ever happened with all of this never-ending discussion brother Merle you know it's just over and over and over again and it never accomplished anything not to say those things aren't the truth I'm not saying that at all but I am I am saying that these never-ending discussions they didn't result in anything then Paul stood in the midst of Mars Hill and said Yemen of Athens I perceive that in all things you are too superstitious and other in other translations it says religious and I think that's the understatement of the century Paul was walking through and there were places of worship everywhere thousands and thousands of these different gods in a different different statues and different altars and all that but notice that Paul didn't attack them and say you're all going to hell for being idolaters he didn't approach it that way Paul brought their own religion down to their own way of thinking he was a master at what he did so now remember these aren't Jews this is a whole different set of people Paul says this I love this for as I passed by and I beheld your devotions I found an altar with this script inscription to the unknown God whom therefore ye ignorantly worship him I declare unto you so all of these philosophers and all these old men sitting around drinking coffee and talking about this they're like what the unknown God oh this is something new everybody gather around let's hear this guy now Paul in his mastery starts in this sermon God that made the world and all things therein seeing that he is Lord of Heaven and Earth dwelleth not in temples made with hands wow that sounds familiar he's saying that all of these temples that you've created both Jews and Gentiles you're getting it wrong neither is worshiped with man's with men's hands as though he needed anything God doesn't need you to make a statue to him seeing he giveth to all life and breathe and breath and all things and hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the Earth and hath determined the times before appointed and the bounds of their habitation Paul here is touching on predestination he says here he says that God has determined times before appointed and the bounds of their habitation so wow he's he's slipping in a little bit of Doctrine here of this of this God's omniscience he knows everything he's determined he has determined and he already knows where you will be born how you're going to be raised where you're going to be where you're going to die in fact he's the one that puts you here there he is talking talking to all these these philosophers and they're drinking their coffee and they he's he's got their their attention and he's saying God knows everything and he knows you that they should seek the Lord if happily they might feel after him and find him though they though he be not far from every one of us I love I love that scripture that they should seek the Lord and if happily they might feel after him when this word feel it means feel like maybe their their eyes are closed and they're trying they're trying to find him and though he may not though he be not far from from us he's telling us to seek the Lord for in him we live and move and have our beings as certain also of your own poets have said for we also for we are also his offspring Paul is quoting someone else here he's not quoting the Bible he's saying that your poets your famous people one of these people has said that we are Offspring from God you want to know something you didn't know Paul is actually quoting a famous Greek poet or what we call today maybe a Greek celebrity this guy's name is um eridus from cilicia not only is this guy a celebrity but he's also a pagan and here's Paul saying that this guy that that you believe that that you raise up as being something special among you he said that we're all offsprings of God so do you know what this man eredus you know what he was saying he's saying that we are offsprings of Zeus completely Pagan thought but Paul is taking that Pagan thought and he's stirring up their ideas he's stirring up their minds in this and now he's going to present this word for as much then as we are The Offspring of God we ought not to think that the godhead is like unto gold or silver or stone or Graven by art or man's device so if we are made in the image of God how come you got a bunch of statues you're not a statue you're not made of gold or iron or anything a wood You're Made Of of Flesh so how could you be an offspring of God if these gods are made of gold he's presenting this in their own understanding in the times of this ignorance brother Eli you know I first heard that brother Aaron McGary he uh he and I were talking and and we were talking about this scripture and he said you know who they're quoting this Greek philosopher and at the times of of this ignorance God winked at but now commandeth all men everywhere to repent because he hath appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained whereof he hath given Assurance unto all men and that he hath raised him from the dead now he's introducing he's speaking of the one man who was resurrected from the dead by God and this Resurrection gives us the Assurance of the one true God who judges the World by the righteousness of Jesus Christ and when they heard of the resurrection of the Dead some marked and others said we will hear thee again of this matter so Paul departed from them again from them how be it certain men clave unto him and believed and believed among the which was dionysius the Arabic areapagite say that five times fast among the which was dionysius the areapagite and a woman named demarius Damaris and others with them what what a great man Paul was Paul goes over here to thessalonica to the Jews and why are we studying this book of Acts Paul had studied or else he could not present these things the way he did so he goes to thessalonica he presents the word to them he goes back into the Old Testament there was no new testament yet he goes back into the scriptures of the prophets and he says here in Psalms here in Isaiah here in Ezekiel here in in um many of the others here is this man that you've been looking for and he came and then they believed and then we have a church at thessalonica and then he goes down the road and then they they start stirring up doing their thing and then he goes down the road to Berea and he meets a more noble group as the Bible said and and he starts preaching to them and they're listening and then they go what we should do they go and they check the scriptures is this man speaking the truth which what you should be doing all the time with my Ministry is brother Daniel preaching the truth anyone that stands in this pulpit you should be checking it with the word and don't automatically throw it out like the bereans didn't do go back if it's if it's something that doesn't sound right come back take it back to the word so that you can understand it so then Paul he goes to these two places they start this wonderful Church in thessalonica and as I said he writes letters back called the first and second Thessalonians and then he goes to Athens and wow is their sin the musicians can come if you could please and then they goes to this Athens which is a weird creepy place and yet Paul's in there and he's got a burden for these people and he was willing to quote not the Bible necessarily but in Modern Day quote movies quote hip-hop stars Maybe you know not me but yeah I'm not going to do that but he was willing to do it because of his audience now that's not going to do anything for us but it might to these people that we meet on the streets get Paul was able to get down to their level speak the word to them so that they could understand it and even quoted this guy that was a famous philosopher really I said you know a music star it may have been that it probably wasn't it was probably more respectable respectable thing but he did quote somebody that was outside the gospel because that's what meant something to them we go back to talking to these people outside here we gotta have a burden friends we got to have a burden for these people and talking with brother Arnie before the homeless people it's almost impossible almost never seen someone come back from that because they they want they want that life they lust after that life they like the drugs they like living like that but if we can get them before they make those mistakes and ruin their lives that's what we need to do why do you think I'm building these rooms out here I want to make the the young people welcome let them go in there and enjoy holy fellowship with each other and and have the mothers and the grandmothers teach them about the Lord so that when they get older and when they're faced with these decisions that they'll make the right ones and it was telling these these girls out there that the decisions that you are making right now are going to decide if you're going to be those two homeless people or if you're going to have this family that you want to have and Paul had the same burden for these people that he was witnessing to and friends I think we need to have we need to continue on with that it's been it's been a blessing but let's continue on please we've got here we've got the Wednesday night crowd you all when you see someone new come into the church do not let them leave without meeting them getting to know know them and encouraging them don't do it because you never know that may be the only chance that that person ever gets amen let's all stand God bless you all brother Aaron Hallelujah [Music] I will bless his name again he is here less and 12 sleep hear him calling out your name is [Music] [Applause] [Music] he is in Highlands he is here amen he is here holy holy I will bless his name again it is [Music] [Applause] [Music] he is he is here you can touch him you will never be the same [Music] way got me on brother Jeremy thank you felt checked when I said that it could be a Hip-Hop star or something like that Lord I don't want to ever say that it's okay or it's in any way acceptable to go in that direction or to hear that kind of music or to get into that crowd that's not it's not what I was saying at all what I was saying is this man that Paul was quoting was not a religious man he was a man of stature a popular man that these people on Mars Hill knew pray that come across wrong there I didn't want to I didn't want to say anything that wasn't according to the Lord's will Brother Joseph come on [Music] God bless you God bless you everybody um Spar heads Lord we come before you father we thank you Father for another glorious message that you've brought through our beloved brother or pastor [Music]

after the rain Jesus Jesus [Music] Kings and kingdoms will all survey but there's something about God bless you brothers and sisters I pray that the book of Acts has been a blessing to you to this point as you can see that that this Apostle Paul that it was in his heart not necessarily to see how big of a church that he could build or or to impress anyone else but it was in his heart to get these people to Jesus Christ no matter if they were Gentile Jews or no matter if they were idle worshiping gentiles whatever they were he wanted to get them to the Lord Jesus because he knew that that is the place that all men have to come and all women have to come I am the way the truth and the life and no man can come to the father except by me God bless you all you're dismissed In The Name Of The Lord [Music] Kings and kingdoms shall all that but there's something [Music] it's a lovely lovely name the name of Jesus it's a lovely lovely name that name it's a lovely lonely name the name of
