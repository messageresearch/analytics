[25:21] Lord Jesus

[25:24] Lord not only do we look
[25:26] forward to going to that place but
[25:28] father we want to take as many people as
[25:30] we can with us
[25:32] father give us
[25:34] I pray more of your Holy Spirit tonight
[25:37] and instruct us Lord in your word
[25:41] father it's a great honor for a saint to
[25:43] come here to this altar
[25:46] and ask that we would do things
[25:48] according to your word and anoint with
[25:50] oil
[25:51] Lord we pray that you would honor that
[25:55] and Lord that you'd be with us tonight
[25:58] as I open this Bible and father give me
[26:00] the wisdom
[26:02] be able to bring it forth to the people
[26:05] in Jesus name I pray
[26:07] amen
[26:09] God bless you all you can take your
[26:10] seats thank you
[26:21] I believe
[26:23] in study in this book of Acts
[26:26] I believe friends that were doing the
[26:28] right thing
[26:30] praying about it today and and I feel
[26:33] like the Lord wants us to understand his
[26:36] word better
[26:37] we've been given so much
[26:40] and I think taking a little time on
[26:42] Wednesday night for a Bible study like
[26:44] we've been doing I think that it will
[26:46] benefit the body of Christ this portion
[26:49] of the body of Christ and what better of
[26:52] a place to start
[26:54] then this book of Acts right after the
[26:57] Holy Spirit came this is what happened
[27:02] Acts
[27:04] we have we talked about
[27:06] Acts chapter 15 last week a couple times
[27:10] we talked about how that
[27:13] the Galatians that there were
[27:15] troublemakers that came in and caused
[27:17] problems and and Paul wrote this this
[27:20] letter
[27:22] to the Galatians addressing the same
[27:25] thing that was going on there in Acts
[27:27] chapter 15 they happened at the same
[27:29] time so now we went through 16 and we
[27:32] now
[27:35] we're in 17. and let's start the best
[27:38] place to start with verse one
[27:44] brother Eli sister Kendall God bless you
[27:46] good good to have you in service tonight
[27:49] I think that's all the visitors that we
[27:50] have
[27:52] now when they had passed through
[27:54] amphipolis and Apollonia
[27:57] they came to thessalonica
[28:00] where was the synagogue of the Jews
[28:04] and Paul
[28:05] as his manner was went unto them
[28:09] and three Sabbath days reasoned with
[28:11] them about the scriptures
[28:15] three Sabbath days is how long
[28:18] yes three weeks
[28:20] so Paul was there for three weeks in
[28:23] this place called thessalonica now
[28:24] thessalonica is the capital of this
[28:27] place called Macedonia where heard in
[28:29] the last chapter that that Paul got this
[28:31] Macedonian call to go to Macedonia he is
[28:35] now in Macedonia and in this city called
[28:38] thessalonica
[28:40] under the now thessalonica was
[28:44] was like a capital and under the Roman
[28:46] Empire
[28:47] which is basically everywhere that we
[28:50] talk about in the book of Acts it was
[28:52] all under this Roman rule
[28:55] there was a significant population of
[28:59] Jews
[29:00] in this city called thessalonica
[29:03] it was a population Center Center it was
[29:06] well traveled and because it was there
[29:08] was a large Jewish population it made a
[29:11] perfect place
[29:13] to put a church
[29:15] and this church could reach out to the
[29:18] neighboring communities and it would be
[29:21] a place also for the apostles to stop
[29:24] and to rest with a with a Church of
[29:28] fellow Christians there
[29:30] so
[29:32] Paul
[29:34] came to this city of thessalonica and
[29:39] remember now Paul is starting to go to
[29:42] the Gentiles but most of the places that
[29:45] we talk about most of the people we talk
[29:47] about are actually Jewish Christians
[29:50] the the Gentiles were they were kind of
[29:54] outside and we're going to see the
[29:56] message going more to them but we see so
[30:00] far many or most of the Gentiles that
[30:04] have been converted to Christianity were
[30:07] people that were already
[30:10] converted to a limited extent to Judaism
[30:15] you'll see in here that that there's
[30:18] many times like in I believe it was
[30:20] Cornelius that it says this and others
[30:22] that this man feared God
[30:25] which means
[30:27] that he had one God
[30:30] which means he was now being introduced
[30:34] to a monotheistic religion a religion
[30:37] that had one God which was the Jewish
[30:40] religion
[30:41] so many of these Gentiles that are now
[30:44] coming to the Lord have already been
[30:47] introduced to the Jewish
[30:51] faith as far as worshiping one God so
[30:55] it's it's a natural progression that's
[30:57] happened but we're going to see coming
[30:59] up into the end of this chapter that
[31:02] now
[31:03] everyone
[31:06] even these Heathen even these Idol
[31:09] worshiping Gentiles they start to come
[31:12] to the message of Christ
[31:15] so Paul as it says here that that
[31:20] he went
[31:22] to this thessalonica for three weeks
[31:26] in preaching the gospel and
[31:29] we need to remember that so often
[31:34] we just want to give someone a track
[31:37] or
[31:39] brother Jonathan we want to just witness
[31:42] to them and say well I planted the seed
[31:45] and then go and and then say well if
[31:47] they're pretty estimated seed of God or
[31:49] if they're a child of God then they're
[31:51] then they'll accept it well no that's
[31:52] not what Paul did here
[31:54] Paul stayed there
[31:56] and we have to be willing if we are
[31:59] witnessing to someone even if it's our
[32:01] children whoever it is a new friend we
[32:05] don't just
[32:06] throw it at them and run away
[32:10] we stay with it and just because it
[32:13] doesn't come right away doesn't mean
[32:16] that that it's not going to come
[32:19] eventually there's been many many people
[32:21] that on their Deathbed
[32:25] they remembered
[32:27] the Lord Jesus someone telling them
[32:29] about the Lord Jesus and they were able
[32:31] to reach out
[32:33] and right before they died
[32:36] the lord gave them that opportunity to
[32:39] give their heart to Jesus
[32:41] now Paul had this attitude where he was
[32:44] he was going to stay with it he was
[32:46] going to preach to these people and and
[32:50] even if they disagree with us friends
[32:53] and they may say hurtful things it's
[32:55] okay
[32:57] it's all right keep your testimony
[32:59] continue to talk about the Lord in love
[33:02] greet these people in love and treat
[33:05] them with love that's the way that you
[33:08] will win this soul to Christ now other
[33:11] people
[33:13] as we're going to see here
[33:15] they needed
[33:18] Doctrine
[33:21] maybe a more intellectual person maybe a
[33:25] more black and white person says well I
[33:26] need to see it here I was
[33:29] I don't know like
[33:31] six five six seven years ago
[33:34] there was a Catholic priest his name was
[33:37] Bill Boehner I believe it was his name
[33:40] in Jeffersonville and and uh relative of
[33:44] mine introduced me to him
[33:46] and uh nice guy we got along well I
[33:49] would I would communicate with him every
[33:52] once in a while and he got older he
[33:54] retired from the priesthood
[33:57] and uh Roman Catholic priest
[34:00] continued talking with me and uh he got
[34:04] old and he
[34:05] um pretty soon he can walk
[34:07] he's in a wheelchair
[34:09] we asked to see me one day
[34:12] so I I
[34:14] went down and met him in the office
[34:16] there and
[34:17] we talked for a while and
[34:20] a Catholic priest friends they're
[34:23] educated
[34:24] they're bright
[34:26] and they know this Bible as well as any
[34:28] of us do
[34:30] yeah and we were talking and he started
[34:32] asking questions
[34:34] he started asking about
[34:37] well what about salvation and I remember
[34:40] I was talking on Sunday about a
[34:42] workspace salvation that's Catholicism
[34:45] they believe you work yourself to heaven
[34:47] and we we talked a lot about Grace and
[34:51] and
[34:52] he just took it in and he listened a lot
[34:55] and the more we talked that day the more
[34:58] I could see the reason why that he came
[35:02] and he sought me out
[35:04] and at the end of our conversation
[35:07] he said you know he said
[35:10] Catholicism is wrong
[35:12] he said it doesn't line up
[35:14] with the Bible
[35:16] and he said
[35:19] he said I believe
[35:21] I believe
[35:22] this message that you're talking about I
[35:24] believe this Jesus Christ and another
[35:26] thing and I don't know how I could have
[35:29] done it different
[35:30] but he said
[35:34] I think I should be baptized in the name
[35:36] of Jesus Christ
[35:38] and then brother Ernie died
[35:41] he died right like within a couple days
[35:45] and I thought well should I have taken
[35:48] him right then no the lord it's okay
[35:50] there was a thief on the cross that gave
[35:52] his heart to the Lord he didn't get
[35:54] baptized it's all right that was that
[35:56] Catholic priest way to go
[35:59] but it took time and it wasn't just me
[36:01] that that was witnessing to him it was
[36:03] it was a family member that I had and
[36:05] she was she she would um talk to him
[36:08] about the Lord and talk to him about
[36:10] about the Bible and and he got he got
[36:15] hungry to see where all this was coming
[36:16] from and then he came to me
[36:19] to work to someone that could talk the
[36:22] word with him and that's the way he
[36:25] needed it
[36:26] he didn't need he didn't need Miracles
[36:28] he didn't need all of this this other
[36:31] stuff that most people maybe need he
[36:33] wanted to see it in this book and if he
[36:35] saw it in that book he believed it
[36:38] he was a child of God
[36:41] and the Lord I believe that the Lord
[36:45] saved that man in his old age
[36:50] thank God
[36:52] for that
[36:53] experience that I had
[36:56] now here
[36:58] as I've said before that every sermon
[37:01] pretty much every sermon in the New
[37:02] Testament certainly every sermon in the
[37:04] book of Acts is about one thing
[37:07] Jesus Christ
[37:09] and
[37:10] Paul preaches a sermon here
[37:14] that uh
[37:17] it starts in verse 3 and we only get one
[37:20] sentence
[37:21] of it
[37:23] but in one sentence
[37:26] it gives us a little synopsis of what
[37:28] Paul had preached which and this sermon
[37:32] that he preached led to a powerful
[37:35] Church being formed in that city of
[37:38] thessalonica
[37:40] such a great church he wrote two letters
[37:43] to this church first and second
[37:45] Thessalonians
[37:47] and if you go and read those those
[37:51] um letters you can see now oh this is
[37:54] where that was formed this is the group
[37:55] of people right now we're in the infant
[37:57] stage of this church and later on Paul
[38:00] corresponds back to them and writes back
[38:03] to them some of the most encouraging
[38:05] scriptures and all of the New Testament
[38:07] are in first and second Thessalonians
[38:11] here's Paul here's the synopsis of his
[38:14] sermon
[38:15] and Paul as it his manner was when and
[38:18] unto them and three Sabbath days
[38:21] reasoned with them out of the scriptures
[38:24] opening and alleging that Christ must
[38:27] needs have suffered and risen again from
[38:31] the dead and that this Jesus whom I
[38:34] preach unto you is Christ
[38:37] now remember his audience
[38:40] they are Jewish Christians and Gentile
[38:45] converted
[38:46] Christians that that were familiar with
[38:49] the Jewish religion
[38:53] let me read again
[38:54] verse 3 it says opening and alleging
[38:57] that Christ must needs have suffered and
[38:59] risen again from the dead and that this
[39:01] Jesus whom I preached to you is Christ
[39:03] now Paul is introducing these people in
[39:05] the synagogue to Christ and he probably
[39:07] used scriptures
[39:10] like Psalm like the Psalms Jesus often
[39:13] referred to the Psalms
[39:15] Paul knowing that these Jewish
[39:18] Christians knowing that these Jewish
[39:20] people that they knew the Bible they
[39:23] knew the Old Testament we can see here
[39:25] that Paul probably quoted the Old
[39:28] Testament to them I'm sure he did
[39:31] as I said we don't have his his sermon
[39:34] here but he probably he was talking
[39:36] about a resurrection he was talking
[39:39] about suffering let's psalm 16 9 he's he
[39:42] probably quoted something like this
[39:45] David prophet of God therefore my heart
[39:48] is glad and my glory rejoices My Flesh
[39:52] also shall shall Rest In Hope
[39:54] for thou Wilt not leave my soul in Hell
[39:57] neither without suffer thy Holy Holy One
[39:59] to to see corruption
[40:02] Paul probably brought that scripture out
[40:05] of the Old Testament and say now do you
[40:08] know what this is this is that Christ
[40:10] that we've been talking about
[40:12] Psalm 49 14.
[40:15] like sheep they are laid in the grave
[40:17] Death Shall feed on them and the upright
[40:20] shall have dominion over over them in
[40:22] the morning and their beauty shall
[40:23] consume
[40:25] in the grave from their dwelling but God
[40:27] will redeem my soul from the power of
[40:30] the Grave for he shall receive me
[40:34] Selah
[40:36] Paul was quoting things like this saying
[40:39] you study the Bible this is what he it
[40:42] says about him this is what happened he
[40:45] was raised from the dead
[40:48] according to the power of God
[40:52] he's telling these Jews in the
[40:53] synagogues
[40:55] because the blood of Jesus Christ and
[40:57] his resurrection
[40:59] that we all too
[41:02] can receive that same resurrection that
[41:04] Jesus had
[41:07] and redeem
[41:09] our souls from sin
[41:12] so you can imagine how these Jews are
[41:14] listening like
[41:15] wow
[41:17] this is good
[41:19] going back to the Psalms and all of
[41:21] these scriptures that that we've read
[41:23] and we have learned in the Seminary or
[41:25] whatever the the uh
[41:27] I don't know what you call a Jewish
[41:29] school but but they would learn these
[41:31] things
[41:32] and then the Apostle says oh and here's
[41:35] the Fulfillment of that in Jesus Christ
[41:42] I want to read a couple more scriptures
[41:44] Jonah 1 17.
[41:46] now the Lord had prepared a great fish
[41:49] to swallow up Jonah and Jonah was in the
[41:51] belly of the fish three days and three
[41:52] nights then then
[41:55] Jesus quotes this
[41:58] in Matthew chapter 12 verse 38 then
[42:01] certain of the scribes and of the
[42:03] Pharisees answered and said Master we
[42:05] would see a sign from thee but he
[42:06] answered and said unto them and evil and
[42:08] adulterous generation seeks after a sign
[42:10] and there shall no sign be given to it
[42:13] but the sign of the Prophet jonahs for
[42:15] as Jonas was in was three days and three
[42:18] nights in the whale's belly so shall the
[42:20] son of man be three days and three
[42:23] nights in the heart of the Earth
[42:25] can you imagine
[42:27] this apostle
[42:29] speaking things like this to these
[42:33] learned theologians and these these
[42:36] church members and and saying that do
[42:39] you know the story of Jonah
[42:42] this was a type of what happened to
[42:44] Christ and he died and there were people
[42:47] alive at that time that witnessed it
[42:50] and telling these people and converting
[42:53] this church at thessalonica
[42:57] verse 4 and some of them believed and
[43:00] consorted with Paul and Silas and out of
[43:02] The Devout Greeks a great multitude and
[43:05] of the chief women not a few
[43:08] but the Jews which believe not moved
[43:11] with Envy
[43:12] took unto them a certain lewd fellows of
[43:15] the base or sword and gathered a company
[43:18] and set all the city on an uproar and
[43:21] assaulted the house of Jason and sought
[43:24] to bring them out to the people
[43:27] telling my wife I think we're maybe on
[43:30] on the way over here
[43:32] that in studying this book of Acts this
[43:35] has been such an incredible blessing to
[43:38] me
[43:39] because I see over and over again the
[43:44] opposition to the gospel is those people
[43:50] religious people that have their way of
[43:55] thinking and they are not willing to
[43:58] open their minds
[44:00] to something new because they they're
[44:03] afraid to accept anything because that
[44:06] would mean maybe that they're wrong
[44:09] so they'll bring everything that they
[44:11] can against it happens over and over
[44:13] again happen through all the gospels
[44:14] happens through the book of Acts it
[44:16] happens to the whole new testament and
[44:19] we see it all the time today it's it's a
[44:21] fear that maybe this something new
[44:24] doesn't line up with the way I've been
[44:26] taught
[44:27] over and over again
[44:30] now
[44:32] it says this
[44:35] that
[44:36] they assaulted the house of Jason
[44:39] and sought to bring out bring them out
[44:43] to the people
[44:44] now
[44:46] who is this guy Jason
[44:49] we don't see him before and we really
[44:51] don't see him after
[44:53] so this guy Jason we've never heard of
[44:55] him
[44:57] and after the next few verses that we're
[45:00] going to read we never hear of him
[45:01] really again
[45:03] it's most likely this guy Jason was
[45:05] probably a Jewish convert who was
[45:08] converted to Christianity by the Apostle
[45:11] Paul
[45:12] he was probably fairly wealthy
[45:15] as you'll you'll you'll read
[45:17] because he hosted all three of them in
[45:19] his house Paul and Silas probably
[45:21] Timothy and probably more in his house
[45:24] and as we read he was able to post bail
[45:27] or some sort of a bond
[45:29] for them when they got thrown in jail
[45:31] when
[45:32] when all the people were coming against
[45:34] him he was able to front some money to
[45:37] say okay well
[45:38] here's some money and if we cause any
[45:41] damage maybe that you can pay for it out
[45:43] of this or something he was able to put
[45:44] up money for some reason
[45:48] so they went to find him and Jason's
[45:50] Allison when they found them not they
[45:52] drew Jason and a certain of the Brethren
[45:54] under the rulers of the city crying
[45:56] these that have turned the world upside
[45:58] down
[45:59] or come hither also
[46:01] I think turn the world upside down is a
[46:03] good way to put it
[46:05] brother Branham said what man calls
[46:08] great God calls foolish
[46:10] what God calls great man calls foolish
[46:14] and this new religion
[46:17] of these Christians was complete
[46:20] opposite of everything everyone had
[46:22] learned
[46:24] I think that there was a lot of
[46:25] Prosperity Gospel going on for
[46:28] Generations back then and it's basically
[46:31] how can God serve me and it's it's a
[46:34] workspace Holiness so then this this new
[46:39] um religion comes in
[46:41] and it's more like how much can you give
[46:43] away
[46:45] how much can you serve others
[46:47] if somebody smacks you in the face
[46:49] brother Jonathan let them smack the
[46:51] other side if somebody takes your coat
[46:54] give them your other garment too
[46:56] if if somebody sues you in the law just
[46:59] drop it don't let it happen all of these
[47:01] things that were never the case a
[47:04] completely opposite religion that
[47:07] everyone had been taught
[47:12] it says this whom Jason had received
[47:15] and all these do contrary now they're
[47:17] talking about Jason and they're talking
[47:20] about these people who Jason had
[47:21] received and all of these do contrary to
[47:24] the decrees of Caesar saying that there
[47:27] is another king one Jesus
[47:31] look at the Same Spirit right here
[47:33] remember who's talking these are Jews
[47:36] do you think the Jews supported Caesar
[47:40] the ruler
[47:42] the one that would crucify them on on
[47:44] the roads
[47:46] just because they were Jews
[47:48] the one that would that would order them
[47:50] beaten and their land taken away and tax
[47:52] collectors to go out and take all of
[47:54] their money do you think they loved
[47:56] Caesar
[47:58] but they sure loved him when it came to
[47:59] Paul
[48:02] it's hypocritical
[48:03] we see it the same way any time
[48:06] something doesn't line up exactly with
[48:08] the way I think all of a sudden you
[48:10] support
[48:11] Caesar all of a sudden you support
[48:14] the president all of a sudden you
[48:16] support whatever it is just because you
[48:19] want to save your way of thinking
[48:24] and when they troubled the people and
[48:26] the rules rulers of the city
[48:29] when they had heard these things and
[48:31] when they had taken security of Jason
[48:33] and of the others they let them go when
[48:36] I said taken the security that's that's
[48:38] the money that they paid so Jason had
[48:41] enough money to put up this Bond and
[48:45] then they said okay well you can go
[48:49] and the Brethren immediately
[48:50] sent Away Paul and Silas By Night unto
[48:54] Berea
[48:55] Who coming to their
[48:57] went into the synagogue of the Jews
[49:01] now this place Berea isn't too far from
[49:04] thessalonica it's it's probably a mile
[49:07] or two away so it's almost a suburb of
[49:11] thessalonica
[49:12] and again
[49:14] they went into the synagogue
[49:19] of the Jews so they again go to the
[49:22] church remember as I said there were no
[49:24] churches back then
[49:26] they were just these these synagogues of
[49:30] there were no Christian churches there
[49:31] was these Jewish synagogues and then
[49:33] there were these Heathen idolatrous
[49:37] temples
[49:39] he didn't really want to go in there and
[49:41] preach
[49:42] so really the Jewish temples they were
[49:45] the Jewish synagogues they were pretty
[49:47] much the only game in town
[49:48] if you were a minister so you would you
[49:51] would greet the rabbi
[49:54] as was their custom they would invite
[49:56] you because you're a visiting minister
[49:58] they would invite you to come in
[50:00] and exhort
[50:01] to the people
[50:07] so a church would generally get started
[50:10] among the Jewish population
[50:12] then they would receive the revelation
[50:15] of Christ they would put away
[50:17] their old legalistic thinking like in
[50:20] Acts 15 in Galatians and they would go
[50:22] out and win Gentile souls to Christ
[50:25] that's how Christian churches formed
[50:28] these were more noble now these are
[50:30] these are Berea these were more noble
[50:32] than those at thessalonica in that they
[50:36] received the word with all Readiness of
[50:38] mind and searched the Scriptures Daily
[50:41] whether those things were so
[50:44] other translations say there were more
[50:47] fair-minded than those in thessalonica
[50:53] and these bereans
[50:55] appreciate their attitude
[50:58] I appreciate their spirit
[51:01] so we see Paul and Silas and Timothy
[51:04] they come in they start
[51:07] preaching this gospel and as I I talked
[51:11] about some of the Psalms and about Jonah
[51:13] and about what Jesus said about Jonah
[51:15] and Matthew they
[51:17] they listened intently
[51:21] and they didn't just out doesn't doesn't
[51:23] line up with what I'm thinking doesn't
[51:25] line up with the way I've been taught
[51:26] they didn't act like that
[51:28] they said well
[51:30] let me let me study on this
[51:33] for a little while so so they would they
[51:35] would present the word to them so these
[51:37] bereans then they would go
[51:40] and they'd open up the Scrolls and
[51:42] they'd start studying well he said this
[51:45] what does it say here and as Isaiah that
[51:48] aversion shock and Steve
[51:50] what does it say here in these other
[51:53] scriptures that they say are pertaining
[51:55] to Christ and they checked
[51:58] they checked it with the word
[52:01] and I think that
[52:04] it should be both ways
[52:07] so when someone presents the word to us
[52:12] like the bereans we don't automatically
[52:15] put it out
[52:17] but then we also have to be careful that
[52:20] we don't automatically brother Jonathan
[52:22] accept it either
[52:24] just because it comes from the pulpit
[52:27] does not mean that it's right don't ever
[52:32] forget that
[52:34] of course if if it's a man of God you
[52:37] never ever want to be found guilty of
[52:40] bringing something that's not true but
[52:42] these bereans set a very good example
[52:46] that they were testing everything that
[52:49] they heard with these scriptures
[52:52] which is exactly how we should be
[52:59] then in Berea there therefore many of
[53:02] them believed also
[53:04] also of honorable women which were
[53:06] Greeks and of men not a few
[53:10] but when the Jews of thessalonica
[53:11] remember the the big city down the road
[53:15] but when the Jews of thessalonica had
[53:18] knowledge that the word of God was
[53:19] preached of Paul at Berea remember he
[53:22] snuck out of thessalonica
[53:25] they came tether also and stirred up the
[53:28] people there
[53:31] so this word traveled quickly on this
[53:34] road
[53:35] and the same thing that happened in
[53:38] thessalonica
[53:40] I'll bet you Paul got so frustrated
[53:43] with these Jews that were supposed to be
[53:46] God's people the same thing that
[53:48] happened in thessalonica just earlier
[53:51] and after he spent three weeks and
[53:53] breaking down these scriptures and
[53:55] presenting the Lord Jesus in in a way
[53:58] that they could understand these same
[54:01] people walked down the road and started
[54:05] doing it in Berea
[54:08] started causing problems there starting
[54:10] started stirring up the people
[54:14] and then immediately
[54:15] same thing
[54:18] the Brethren sent Away Paul to go as it
[54:21] were to the Sea but Silas and timotheus
[54:25] Abode there still
[54:27] so now he gets kicked out of of
[54:31] thessalonica he goes to Berea it's like
[54:34] oh this is a breath of fresh air and
[54:36] then these same
[54:37] dudes come over from from thessalonica
[54:41] and start causing problems again
[54:45] so then that same thing happens
[54:47] Paul takes off the Brethren send them
[54:49] away
[54:51] and they that conducted Paul
[54:54] brought him to Athens
[54:57] and receiving a commandment unto Silas
[55:00] and timotheus for to come up to him with
[55:04] all speed they Departed now Athens was
[55:08] the capital
[55:09] of the Greek Empire
[55:11] Athens was a place it was conquered by
[55:14] Rome 100 or so years earlier but it was
[55:17] permitted to keep its culture and most
[55:19] of its independence
[55:21] so Athens really was the heart of the
[55:25] Greek culture
[55:27] now why while Paul waited for them at
[55:30] Athens his Spirit was stirred in him
[55:34] when he saw the city wholly given to
[55:38] idolatry
[55:41] what a scripture
[55:43] you know I think about
[55:45] how many of us
[55:47] walk around
[55:49] Tucson Arizona
[55:51] drive around and see what this city has
[55:56] become
[55:58] see the filth on the street
[56:01] see the the drug abuse
[56:04] going on and and and
[56:07] see just the immorality
[56:10] among among things and I work on campus
[56:14] at the U of AC
[56:16] looking and see that what that place
[56:20] really stands for
[56:22] everything against God
[56:25] and walking around I can see Paul he's
[56:29] walking down the street
[56:31] and there were literally thousands
[56:34] of idols
[56:36] as he's walking along and and going
[56:38] through and and seeing this is Zeus and
[56:42] this is Mars and this is all of these
[56:45] different Greek gods just everywhere and
[56:48] we walking around
[56:51] and how it should grieve us
[56:54] to see the sin and the Sea really the
[56:57] idolatry that surrounds us
[57:01] maybe think that we can relate to Paul
[57:06] I think maybe Paul also
[57:09] and I'll take this
[57:12] more upon myself
[57:14] as I see really a failure in the
[57:17] churches of today
[57:20] I see that we look at all of this sin
[57:23] going on all of this drug abuse brother
[57:26] Arnie and I are constantly
[57:28] witnessing
[57:29] to to these drug addicts that come
[57:33] walking by
[57:34] and I see what a failure
[57:38] these people when they were young they
[57:42] should have been in church it would have
[57:45] helped them
[57:46] but every one that I talked to their
[57:49] parents weren't in their lives as young
[57:52] people their parents didn't go to church
[57:56] every single one of them really without
[57:58] exception they did not have a family
[58:02] that was part of a Christian Community
[58:06] like we are
[58:09] and I really believe I believe it's a
[58:11] failure
[58:12] in the churches
[58:13] and we need to change that
[58:17] even if it's just this little group
[58:19] right here we need to continue to reach
[58:22] out because by the time
[58:25] that they get to be 18 years old
[58:28] are any of the people I was witnessing
[58:30] to out there the other day
[58:32] it was it was a girl and a guy
[58:36] the girl I think was 28 the guy was
[58:38] about the same age
[58:40] I said how did you get here
[58:44] they had the same story
[58:45] well my my parents weren't in my life I
[58:48] was living my aunt
[58:50] I was living my uncle
[58:52] the girl is 18 years old
[58:56] when she got when she got put out on the
[58:58] streets
[58:59] 10 years
[59:02] she had been living
[59:03] on these streets she looked terrible
[59:06] teeth were rotted out from the drugs
[59:10] she was a sunburned as you could be
[59:14] because you fell asleep out
[59:16] in the Sun
[59:18] and I asked him I said what what's
[59:21] how did you how did you get here and
[59:23] they said well it's drugs
[59:25] there was always a gateway drug too
[59:29] which was usually marijuana
[59:33] and the other guy said
[59:35] for him it was Ritalin
[59:37] it was it was a drug that they give a
[59:39] lot to the young people sister Angel you
[59:41] probably know a lot more about it than I
[59:42] do
[59:43] and he said that there's these gateway
[59:45] drugs and he says then you get hooked
[59:48] and I said well do you want to get off
[59:50] of the drug
[59:53] they don't
[59:55] they want it
[59:57] and that is the biggest problem
[1:00:00] if they would have been taught right as
[1:00:02] young people
[1:00:04] if they would have been in a church that
[1:00:06] loved them
[1:00:08] that's key
[1:00:10] with not just with their parents but
[1:00:13] with all of us that reach out to these
[1:00:16] young people
[1:00:17] and love them take care of them would do
[1:00:20] anything for them not just parents but
[1:00:23] all of us
[1:00:24] they wouldn't be in that situation
[1:00:29] and I was talking with them and I was
[1:00:30] telling them I said you know the Lord
[1:00:32] Jesus Takes these things away and
[1:00:36] and they're like yeah yeah yeah yeah and
[1:00:38] I'm talking with these these this this
[1:00:40] guy and this girl and they said well can
[1:00:42] we use the the hose bib over here
[1:00:45] and I said yeah you know whatever so
[1:00:47] they go over there and I'm I'm still
[1:00:48] trying to preach to them and and I
[1:00:51] didn't know behind me
[1:00:54] on the other side of the wall right
[1:00:55] there there were two young ladies
[1:00:58] and I'm facing this way and they're back
[1:01:00] there
[1:01:02] and
[1:01:04] one of them says are you the pastor of
[1:01:06] the church and it scared me I said oh I
[1:01:09] didn't I didn't know you were there
[1:01:11] and um
[1:01:13] I said yeah
[1:01:14] and and she said
[1:01:16] well um
[1:01:18] we were catholic but we never went to
[1:01:21] church
[1:01:23] and I said well where do you live do you
[1:01:25] how are your parents well my my parents
[1:01:28] um you know we don't live I don't live
[1:01:29] with my parents and I said how about you
[1:01:31] and there was a 14 year old
[1:01:33] there was a 16 year old
[1:01:35] and the 16 year old says well I live
[1:01:38] with her and the 14 year old says yeah
[1:01:40] well we live with my aunt
[1:01:45] and I looked at him and I said look at
[1:01:47] these two people right here
[1:01:50] I said that is how you will end up
[1:01:55] if you don't change this cycle that's in
[1:01:58] your life I said do you want to be like
[1:01:59] that
[1:02:02] and they said no
[1:02:04] I said let me ask you this I could tell
[1:02:06] they were good kids
[1:02:07] I said do you want to have a family both
[1:02:10] of them said yeah I want a big family
[1:02:12] I said do you want to meet a good boy
[1:02:14] that'll be a good husband to you
[1:02:17] both of them said yeah that's what we
[1:02:19] want that's what I want talking with
[1:02:22] these young ladies and I could see that
[1:02:24] they did not want that but they're put
[1:02:26] in this place
[1:02:28] of Just Pure Evil how do we get them out
[1:02:33] they need a place to go
[1:02:35] they need a church and I asked the
[1:02:38] congregation to pray for them today this
[1:02:40] morning
[1:02:42] that they would
[1:02:43] follow up with coming
[1:02:46] and if they come to church like anyone
[1:02:49] else if there is somebody here you don't
[1:02:51] recognize love them
[1:02:54] greet them do not let them out of this
[1:02:58] church without giving them the right
[1:03:01] hand of Fellowship without talking to
[1:03:03] them without showing them love because
[1:03:04] you have no idea where they're going to
[1:03:06] be
[1:03:07] you have no idea where they're going to
[1:03:09] end up and if you can stop that cycle
[1:03:12] and most of the time it's not me
[1:03:15] preaching salvation it's not it's
[1:03:18] showing that you care
[1:03:20] Paul here
[1:03:22] what are the motives of the Apostle Paul
[1:03:24] do you think it's to build his church
[1:03:28] no
[1:03:29] it's for these people that were stuck in
[1:03:33] idolatry
[1:03:38] therefore Paul disputed he in the
[1:03:40] synagogue with the Jews
[1:03:42] and with devout persons and in the
[1:03:44] market daily with them that met with him
[1:03:50] like in thessalonica he was willing to
[1:03:53] put in the time but this time Paul's not
[1:03:55] just going into the synagogues he's
[1:03:57] walking along and there's all this
[1:03:59] weirdness going on maybe all these drug
[1:04:02] addicts like we see and Paul was willing
[1:04:04] to talk any time about the Lord he was
[1:04:09] willing to witness any time about the
[1:04:11] word Lord it says here it says he
[1:04:13] disputed in the synagogues with devout
[1:04:16] persons and in the market even
[1:04:18] daily
[1:04:20] all the time
[1:04:21] talking about the Lord Jesus
[1:04:26] so the gospel is not just preached in
[1:04:28] the churches
[1:04:30] the gospel is preached in our homes
[1:04:32] to our children the gospel is preached
[1:04:35] in the grocery store in the Market at
[1:04:38] work everywhere we go the gospel is
[1:04:40] preached
[1:04:42] and some of you young sisters
[1:04:45] you preach the Gospel wherever you go
[1:04:47] just by your own testimony
[1:04:50] they see you
[1:04:52] they think there's something special
[1:04:56] about this person
[1:04:59] and you've been asked how many times
[1:05:00] have you been asked all of you sisters
[1:05:02] what religion are you
[1:05:03] is it common of course it's common
[1:05:07] us Brothers should have the same thing
[1:05:09] as to us
[1:05:11] we should have such a spirit that people
[1:05:15] look at us and they say there is
[1:05:16] something special about that man
[1:05:23] then certain philosophers of the
[1:05:25] epicureans and of the stoics encountered
[1:05:27] him
[1:05:28] and some said what will this babbler say
[1:05:31] now these are true gentiles these aren't
[1:05:35] Jewish converts these are the guys that
[1:05:38] are bowing down to Zeus and all the
[1:05:40] other thousands of idols and have no
[1:05:42] idea about a one God religion
[1:05:46] then certain of the philosophers of the
[1:05:48] epicureans and the stoics encountered
[1:05:50] him and some said what will this babbler
[1:05:52] say and some and others said he seemeth
[1:05:55] to be a set or forth of strange Gods
[1:05:57] because he preached unto them Jesus and
[1:06:00] the red and the resurrection now these
[1:06:02] epicureans and the stoics they were
[1:06:04] philosophers
[1:06:06] they followed a certain line of thought
[1:06:08] about by
[1:06:10] this man Epicurious and this other man
[1:06:13] Zeno both of them Greek philosophers
[1:06:16] brother Aaron
[1:06:17] um
[1:06:18] obviously was getting ahead and and was
[1:06:21] reading in the book of Acts and he found
[1:06:23] this
[1:06:24] note on who these two people were
[1:06:28] was this John Wesley
[1:06:29] so this is a quote from John Wesley
[1:06:32] some of the air Epicurean and stoic
[1:06:35] philosophers the epicureans entirely
[1:06:38] denied a Providence and held the and
[1:06:42] held the world to be the effect of mere
[1:06:45] chance
[1:06:46] asserting sensual pleasure to be man's
[1:06:49] Chief good and that the soul and body
[1:06:52] died together
[1:06:54] all right so this man Epicurious he was
[1:06:57] saying live as good as you can
[1:07:00] in this life because this is the this
[1:07:02] there's nothing on the other side the
[1:07:04] stoics held that matter was that matter
[1:07:08] was eternal and that all things were
[1:07:10] governed by irresistible fate and that
[1:07:13] virtue was its own sufficient reward and
[1:07:16] vice was its own sufficient punishment
[1:07:20] so we see two
[1:07:22] idolaters on different sides here one's
[1:07:25] a little bit more moral the other one is
[1:07:27] is just eat drink and be merry for
[1:07:29] tomorrow we die
[1:07:31] thank you for that
[1:07:35] and they took him Paul
[1:07:38] and they took him and brought him to the
[1:07:39] areopagus saying may we know what this
[1:07:43] new Doc maybe we know what this new
[1:07:45] doctrine where of thou speakest is
[1:07:49] for thou bring us certain strange things
[1:07:51] to our ears we would know therefore what
[1:07:54] these things mean
[1:07:55] for all the Athenians and strangers
[1:07:58] which
[1:07:59] were there spent their time in nothing
[1:08:02] else but either to tell or to hear
[1:08:05] something new now this areopagus is it's
[1:08:09] a big rock out crop on the top of Mars
[1:08:12] Hill in Athens
[1:08:14] so they bring him up here and this is
[1:08:16] the place that they would debate these
[1:08:18] things these philosophical debates
[1:08:21] so here are a bunch of men a bunch of
[1:08:24] probably men who like to discuss
[1:08:26] philosophy and religion but would never
[1:08:28] do anything about it
[1:08:30] and I'll tell you I was telling my wife
[1:08:33] on the way over here that growing up I
[1:08:37] got
[1:08:39] kind of scarred by that type of thing
[1:08:42] when I was little
[1:08:44] I was hearing all of dad and all the
[1:08:49] brothers would get together and and I'd
[1:08:51] listen they were talking about all of
[1:08:52] these things the third poll the son of
[1:08:55] man Ministry and you know what about the
[1:08:57] seventh seal is the seventh seal
[1:08:58] revealed or not what about the seven
[1:09:00] thunders in 1977 and 1963 and about the
[1:09:04] fivefold ministry and about the tent
[1:09:06] meeting and in my opinion
[1:09:09] don't hate me
[1:09:12] but it's the same Spirit as they had up
[1:09:14] on Mars Hill
[1:09:16] let's just talk about it
[1:09:18] and discuss these things and brother
[1:09:20] nothing ever happened
[1:09:22] nothing ever happened with them
[1:09:25] and nothing ever happened with all of
[1:09:27] this never-ending discussion
[1:09:29] brother Merle you know
[1:09:31] it's just over and over and over again
[1:09:34] and it never accomplished anything
[1:09:39] not to say those things aren't the truth
[1:09:41] I'm not saying that at all
[1:09:44] but I am I am saying that these
[1:09:47] never-ending discussions
[1:09:49] they didn't result in anything
[1:09:52] then Paul stood in the midst of Mars
[1:09:55] Hill and said Yemen of Athens I perceive
[1:09:58] that in all things you are too
[1:10:00] superstitious
[1:10:02] and other in other translations it says
[1:10:04] religious and I think that's the
[1:10:06] understatement of the century
[1:10:08] Paul was walking through and there were
[1:10:10] places of worship everywhere thousands
[1:10:13] and thousands of these different gods in
[1:10:16] a different different statues and
[1:10:18] different altars and all that but notice
[1:10:20] that Paul didn't attack them
[1:10:23] and say you're all going to hell for
[1:10:25] being idolaters he didn't approach it
[1:10:27] that way
[1:10:30] Paul brought their own religion down to
[1:10:33] their own way of thinking he was a
[1:10:36] master at what he did so now remember
[1:10:39] these aren't Jews this is a whole
[1:10:41] different set of people
[1:10:46] Paul says this
[1:10:49] I love this
[1:10:51] for as I passed by
[1:10:53] and I beheld your devotions
[1:10:57] I found an altar with this script
[1:11:00] inscription
[1:11:01] to the unknown God
[1:11:04] whom therefore ye ignorantly worship
[1:11:07] him
[1:11:09] I declare
[1:11:11] unto you
[1:11:13] so all of these philosophers and all
[1:11:16] these old men sitting around drinking
[1:11:17] coffee and talking about this they're
[1:11:19] like
[1:11:20] what
[1:11:22] the unknown God
[1:11:24] oh this is something new
[1:11:26] everybody gather around let's hear this
[1:11:29] guy
[1:11:33] now Paul in his mastery
[1:11:36] starts in this sermon
[1:11:38] God that made the world and all things
[1:11:41] therein seeing that he is Lord of Heaven
[1:11:44] and Earth dwelleth not in temples
[1:11:47] made with hands wow that sounds familiar
[1:11:52] he's saying that all of these temples
[1:11:54] that you've created both Jews and
[1:11:57] Gentiles you're getting it wrong
[1:12:00] neither is worshiped with man's with
[1:12:03] men's hands as though he needed anything
[1:12:05] God doesn't need you to make a statue to
[1:12:08] him
[1:12:10] seeing he giveth to all life and breathe
[1:12:13] and breath and all things and hath made
[1:12:17] of one blood all nations of men for to
[1:12:20] dwell on all the face of the Earth and
[1:12:22] hath determined the times before
[1:12:24] appointed and the bounds of their
[1:12:27] habitation
[1:12:29] Paul here is touching on predestination
[1:12:36] he says here he says that God has
[1:12:38] determined times before appointed
[1:12:41] and the bounds of their habitation
[1:12:44] so wow he's he's slipping in a little
[1:12:47] bit of Doctrine here of this of this
[1:12:50] God's omniscience he knows everything
[1:12:55] he's determined he has determined and he
[1:12:58] already knows
[1:12:59] where you will be born
[1:13:01] how you're going to be raised where
[1:13:03] you're going to be where you're going to
[1:13:05] die in fact he's the one that puts you
[1:13:07] here
[1:13:08] there he is talking talking to all these
[1:13:10] these philosophers and they're drinking
[1:13:13] their coffee and they he's he's got
[1:13:16] their their attention
[1:13:18] and he's saying God knows everything
[1:13:24] and he knows you
[1:13:30] that they should seek the Lord
[1:13:35] if happily they might feel after him and
[1:13:38] find him though they though he be not
[1:13:41] far from every one of us
[1:13:44] I love I love that scripture that they
[1:13:46] should seek the Lord and if happily they
[1:13:48] might feel after him when this word feel
[1:13:51] it means feel
[1:13:53] like maybe their their eyes are closed
[1:13:55] and they're trying they're trying to
[1:13:57] find him
[1:14:01] and though he may not though he be not
[1:14:04] far from from us
[1:14:06] he's telling us to seek the Lord
[1:14:09] for in him we live and move and have our
[1:14:13] beings as certain also of your own poets
[1:14:17] have said for we also
[1:14:20] for we are also his offspring
[1:14:24] Paul
[1:14:25] is quoting someone else here
[1:14:30] he's not quoting the Bible
[1:14:33] he's saying that your poets
[1:14:36] your famous people one of these people
[1:14:39] has said
[1:14:41] that we are Offspring from God
[1:14:47] you want to know something you didn't
[1:14:48] know
[1:14:50] Paul is actually quoting a famous Greek
[1:14:52] poet
[1:14:54] or what we call today maybe a Greek
[1:14:56] celebrity
[1:15:01] this guy's name
[1:15:02] is um
[1:15:04] eridus
[1:15:06] from cilicia
[1:15:08] not only is this guy a celebrity
[1:15:10] but he's also a pagan
[1:15:13] and here's Paul
[1:15:16] saying that this guy that that you
[1:15:18] believe that that you raise up as being
[1:15:20] something special among you he said that
[1:15:23] we're all offsprings of God
[1:15:26] so do you know what this man eredus
[1:15:30] you know what he was saying
[1:15:32] he's saying that we are offsprings of
[1:15:34] Zeus
[1:15:36] completely Pagan thought
[1:15:39] but Paul is taking that Pagan thought
[1:15:41] and he's stirring up their ideas he's
[1:15:44] stirring up their minds
[1:15:46] in this
[1:15:48] and now he's going to present this word
[1:15:52] for as much then as we are The Offspring
[1:15:55] of God
[1:15:57] we ought not to think that the godhead
[1:15:59] is like unto gold or silver or stone or
[1:16:02] Graven by art or man's device so if we
[1:16:06] are made in the image of God how come
[1:16:08] you got a bunch of statues you're not a
[1:16:11] statue
[1:16:12] you're not made of gold or iron or
[1:16:14] anything a wood You're Made Of of Flesh
[1:16:19] so how could you be an offspring of God
[1:16:22] if these gods are made of gold
[1:16:24] he's presenting this in their own
[1:16:27] understanding
[1:16:30] in the times of this ignorance
[1:16:32] brother Eli you know I first heard that
[1:16:34] brother Aaron McGary
[1:16:37] he uh he and I were talking and and we
[1:16:40] were talking about this scripture and he
[1:16:42] said you know who they're quoting this
[1:16:44] Greek philosopher
[1:16:47] and at the times of of this ignorance
[1:16:49] God winked at but now commandeth all men
[1:16:53] everywhere to repent because he hath
[1:16:56] appointed a day in which he will judge
[1:16:58] the world in righteousness by that man
[1:17:04] whom he hath ordained whereof he hath
[1:17:07] given Assurance unto all men and that he
[1:17:10] hath raised him from the dead
[1:17:12] now he's introducing
[1:17:16] he's speaking of the one man who was
[1:17:19] resurrected from the dead by God
[1:17:22] and this Resurrection gives us the
[1:17:25] Assurance of the one true God who judges
[1:17:27] the World by the righteousness of Jesus
[1:17:30] Christ
[1:17:31] and when they heard of the resurrection
[1:17:33] of the Dead
[1:17:34] some marked
[1:17:36] and others said we will hear thee again
[1:17:39] of this matter
[1:17:42] so Paul departed from them again from
[1:17:45] them
[1:17:46] how be it certain men clave unto him and
[1:17:50] believed
[1:17:51] and believed among the which was
[1:17:55] dionysius the Arabic
[1:17:59] areapagite
[1:18:03] say that five times fast
[1:18:06] among the which was dionysius the
[1:18:09] areapagite and a woman named demarius
[1:18:12] Damaris and others with them
[1:18:18] what
[1:18:20] what a great man Paul was
[1:18:23] Paul goes over here
[1:18:25] to thessalonica
[1:18:27] to the Jews
[1:18:30] and why are we studying this book of
[1:18:32] Acts
[1:18:34] Paul had studied or else he could not
[1:18:36] present these things the way he did
[1:18:40] so he goes to thessalonica he presents
[1:18:42] the word to them he goes back into the
[1:18:44] Old Testament there was no new testament
[1:18:46] yet he goes back into the scriptures of
[1:18:48] the prophets and he says here in Psalms
[1:18:51] here in Isaiah here in Ezekiel here in
[1:18:54] in
[1:18:55] um many of the others
[1:18:58] here is this man that you've been
[1:19:00] looking for and he came and then they
[1:19:03] believed
[1:19:05] and then we have a church at
[1:19:07] thessalonica
[1:19:08] and then he goes down the road and then
[1:19:10] they they start stirring up doing their
[1:19:12] thing and then he goes down the road to
[1:19:14] Berea and he meets a more noble group as
[1:19:18] the Bible said and and he starts
[1:19:20] preaching to them
[1:19:21] and they're listening
[1:19:25] and then they go what we should do they
[1:19:28] go and they check the scriptures is this
[1:19:31] man speaking the truth
[1:19:34] which what you should be doing all the
[1:19:36] time with my Ministry
[1:19:39] is brother Daniel preaching the truth
[1:19:44] anyone that stands in this pulpit
[1:19:47] you should be checking it with the word
[1:19:51] and don't automatically throw it out
[1:19:53] like the bereans didn't do
[1:19:56] go back if it's if it's something that
[1:19:58] doesn't sound right come back
[1:20:01] take it back to the word so that you can
[1:20:03] understand it
[1:20:04] so then Paul he goes to these two places
[1:20:07] they start this wonderful Church in
[1:20:09] thessalonica
[1:20:10] and as I said he writes letters back
[1:20:13] called the first and second
[1:20:14] Thessalonians and then he goes to Athens
[1:20:16] and wow is their sin the musicians can
[1:20:20] come if you could please and then they
[1:20:23] goes to this Athens which is a weird
[1:20:29] creepy place and yet Paul's in there and
[1:20:33] he's got a burden
[1:20:36] for these people
[1:20:38] and he was willing
[1:20:40] to quote
[1:20:42] not
[1:20:44] the Bible necessarily but in Modern Day
[1:20:47] quote movies
[1:20:50] quote
[1:20:51] hip-hop stars Maybe
[1:20:54] you know not me but yeah I'm not going
[1:20:57] to do that but he was willing to do it
[1:21:00] because of his audience now that's not
[1:21:03] going to do anything for us
[1:21:05] but it might
[1:21:07] to these people that we meet on the
[1:21:09] streets
[1:21:11] get Paul was able to get down to their
[1:21:15] level
[1:21:16] speak the word to them
[1:21:19] so that they could understand it and
[1:21:21] even quoted this guy
[1:21:24] that was a famous
[1:21:26] philosopher really I said
[1:21:28] you know a music star
[1:21:31] it may have been that it probably wasn't
[1:21:33] it was probably more respectable
[1:21:36] respectable thing but he did quote
[1:21:38] somebody that was outside
[1:21:41] the gospel
[1:21:42] because that's what meant something to
[1:21:44] them we go back to
[1:21:47] talking to these people
[1:21:49] outside here
[1:21:52] we gotta have a burden friends
[1:21:55] we got to have a burden for these people
[1:21:57] and
[1:22:00] talking with brother Arnie before the
[1:22:03] homeless people
[1:22:04] it's almost impossible
[1:22:07] almost never seen someone come back from
[1:22:10] that
[1:22:11] because
[1:22:13] they they want they want that life
[1:22:16] they lust after that life they like the
[1:22:19] drugs they like living like that but if
[1:22:22] we can get them before
[1:22:25] they make those mistakes and ruin their
[1:22:28] lives
[1:22:29] that's what we need to do
[1:22:31] why do you think I'm building these
[1:22:33] rooms out here
[1:22:35] I want to make the the young people
[1:22:37] welcome
[1:22:39] let them go in there and enjoy holy
[1:22:42] fellowship with each other and and have
[1:22:45] the mothers and the grandmothers teach
[1:22:49] them about the Lord
[1:22:51] so that when they get older and when
[1:22:54] they're faced with these decisions
[1:22:56] that they'll make the right ones and it
[1:22:58] was telling these these girls out there
[1:23:00] that the decisions that you are making
[1:23:02] right now are going to decide if you're
[1:23:05] going to be those two homeless people
[1:23:07] or if you're going to have this family
[1:23:09] that you want to have
[1:23:12] and
[1:23:14] Paul had the same burden
[1:23:18] for these people that he was witnessing
[1:23:19] to
[1:23:20] and friends I think we need to have
[1:23:22] we need to continue on with that it's
[1:23:24] been it's been a blessing
[1:23:27] but let's continue on please
[1:23:30] we've got here we've got the Wednesday
[1:23:32] night crowd

[1:23:49] it
