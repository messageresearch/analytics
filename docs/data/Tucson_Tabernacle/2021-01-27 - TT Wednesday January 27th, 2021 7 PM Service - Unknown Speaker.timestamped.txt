[54:15] we ask in jesus christ's name
[54:18] amen thank you you may be seated
[54:22] i have so much
[54:27] it's i'm i just
[54:31] all day today is lord i don't know how
[54:34] but i just asked him to have his way
[54:38] on monday night i couldn't sleep i think
[54:40] it was up till one it was just
[54:42] burning so much and so i just couldn't
[54:45] get away from it
[54:48] yesterday around 10 30 i said i need to
[54:50] go to sleep because
[54:52] and the lord let me have a good night's
[54:54] sleep but this afternoon after i got
[54:56] home the same just
[54:58] burning in my heart lord and i said
[55:00] would you
[55:01] let me just yield myself and surrender
[55:03] myself and let you speak
[55:04] so trust that he would do and and while
[55:07] i was doing some
[55:08] some studying on this and it's i would
[55:11] call it why fear part
[55:12] two but it's it's part of that
[55:16] the eternal side of god the as brother
[55:19] branham said his eternals
[55:22] and that's who he is an eternal one and
[55:25] we're talking about i was talking with
[55:27] my wife on the way in we were talking
[55:29] about the other
[55:30] on the other side when brother branham
[55:33] crossed over
[55:34] for that short period of time
[55:37] and he's trying to explain it in words
[55:39] and he can't find words in a way to
[55:41] explain
[55:42] what that other dimension is
[55:45] what it is to be in a in a glorified
[55:48] body and
[55:49] he still was in his body because of his
[55:52] reactions you can tell
[55:54] and he would say it's like this but but
[55:57] it's not like this human feeling
[56:00] but god allowed him to have a time and
[56:02] end and i
[56:03] i was asking the lord could we just have
[56:05] a time like that today
[56:07] just to enter into that presence a
[56:09] little bit to
[56:11] just to encourage our hearts and and
[56:14] some things and
[56:16] just i i would i read scripture of the
[56:20] day and it tied in and
[56:22] the daily strength had something that
[56:24] fit right in and
[56:26] quote of the day had something to fit
[56:28] right in and sometimes when you're
[56:29] looking
[56:30] at it certain way everything just fits
[56:31] right in
[56:34] and i just i i was listening to a song
[56:37] that somebody posted and
[56:39] and they they were singing and it was
[56:42] songs started out and i'm just going to
[56:44] paraphrase a little bit of it and it
[56:46] just says
[56:47] you know i may not have a whole lot and
[56:49] i may be poor and i'm evening
[56:51] but i have a soul that is worth ten
[56:53] thousand worlds
[56:55] and that that just began to to even more
[56:58] so and to think
[57:00] he could have called ten thousand angels
[57:05] to destroy the world and set him free
[57:08] but he said no for you
[57:12] i will go through this so it made me
[57:15] think about adam and eve
[57:19] they were created beings and
[57:22] and they were part of this earth and
[57:24] brother branham gets into it quite a bit
[57:27] god created this earth he'd say this
[57:30] earth
[57:30] where he took us and he formed us out of
[57:32] it and he created so we're part of that
[57:35] creation
[57:37] he says you were part of him and when
[57:39] you begin to look at
[57:40] the whole picture as much as as we can
[57:45] but to think they're being created not
[57:47] knowing sin not knowing anything wrong
[57:50] nothing nothing waking up in the morning
[57:53] and saying
[57:54] you know it's going to be a tough day or
[57:55] nothing like that at this time
[57:58] and myself brother arnie were talking a
[57:59] little bit before service started and
[58:03] do you think adam knew he said that she
[58:05] was going to fall
[58:06] i don't know but they must have known
[58:08] something about that serpent because he
[58:10] was there
[58:12] i don't think it caught him by surprise
[58:14] in that sense i i'm
[58:15] just just me thinking just me speaking
[58:18] here
[58:20] and then they were cast out
[58:23] but they had to have time stopped and
[58:25] looked back that way and said
[58:27] oh to be over there again
[58:31] you know and i was telling my wife i
[58:33] said here i am
[58:34] and she knows how i would i would get up
[58:37] and i'd sit on the edge of the bed and
[58:40] then i'd go sit at the desk for a while
[58:42] and and some more and just it was just
[58:43] burning
[58:45] but i said in the middle of that i would
[58:46] remember oh yeah but tomorrow don't
[58:48] forget you got to do this
[58:50] and and remember you got to go do that
[58:52] job that they just added on
[58:54] because we're still on this side
[58:57] you know so i was looking at something
[59:01] and it was interesting and it said
[59:04] indian proverbs
[59:07] so i said that's interesting let's see
[59:08] what that is
[59:10] and i may not pronounce these indian
[59:12] tribes
[59:13] correctly but the first one is acaiwa
[59:17] and it was there is no fear in faith
[59:22] and i said oh by by accident that got
[59:25] put there you know
[59:27] no there is no fear in faith
[59:32] and then the next one by the mingos
[59:35] mingles tribe if you see no reason for
[59:38] giving thanks
[59:40] the fault lies in yourself
[59:45] i mean there is reason to give thanks
[59:47] always
[59:49] to be a thankful people
[59:53] and again i may not pronounce it but i
[59:56] think it's the oglala tribe
[59:58] that there can never be peace between
[1:00:00] nations
[1:00:02] until first you know the true peace in
[1:00:04] the soul of man
[1:00:07] the god of peace has to live in here
[1:00:10] or there can be peace and i thought wow
[1:00:13] sometimes in our minds we think that we
[1:00:16] discovered all this we knew but no this
[1:00:17] was all
[1:00:18] god is eternal
[1:00:21] and and the i'm not even going to try to
[1:00:25] say this tribe i never even heard of
[1:00:27] and he said as it is less of a problem
[1:00:29] to be poor
[1:00:30] than to be dishonest
[1:00:34] and i thought about it's true sometimes
[1:00:37] we're dishonest with ourselves
[1:00:40] the lakota tribe if you continue to
[1:00:43] contaminate your home
[1:00:45] you will suffer kate in your own waste
[1:00:49] it was just i was reading i was reading
[1:00:50] to my wife and she was trying to go to
[1:00:52] sleep
[1:00:54] and i kept cheyenne
[1:00:58] it says i seek strength
[1:01:02] not to be better than my brother but to
[1:01:04] battle my most
[1:01:06] significant enemy myself
[1:01:11] and bro it reminded me when brother
[1:01:13] branham asked that chief
[1:01:14] who wins the battle between the two dogs
[1:01:16] the white and the black
[1:01:18] the chief says it depends on the one i
[1:01:21] feed the most
[1:01:24] and so it was just one thing after
[1:01:27] another so i'm like lord how
[1:01:29] how do i do this but let's just see what
[1:01:31] god will do for us today
[1:01:36] be still and know that i am god
[1:01:40] be at peace be at rest quit trying to
[1:01:42] fight it yourself
[1:01:44] quit getting in the way sometimes and
[1:01:47] let him
[1:01:48] be god he says
[1:01:51] psalms 118 6 that we read the lord is on
[1:01:55] my side
[1:01:56] i will not fear what can man do unto me
[1:02:02] jeremiah 29 11 we quote it quite a bit
[1:02:06] for i know the thoughts that i think
[1:02:08] towards you saith the lord
[1:02:10] thoughts of peace and not of evil
[1:02:13] to give you an expected end
[1:02:17] you quote it every day every five
[1:02:18] minutes it is still the truth
[1:02:22] john 10 28-29 the book of john
[1:02:25] 10 28-29 and i'm i'm going to go through
[1:02:28] this
[1:02:29] part quickly because i want to get to to
[1:02:32] a part i want to spend more time on
[1:02:34] and i give unto them eternal life and
[1:02:37] they shall never
[1:02:38] perish neither shall any man pluck them
[1:02:42] out of my hand so we go back to the
[1:02:44] verse
[1:02:45] psalms 118 what can man do unto me
[1:02:49] can't take him out take you out of god's
[1:02:50] hands
[1:02:52] they try to stone stephen to death and
[1:02:55] what did god say allow him to see
[1:02:57] i see jesus sitting on the right hand of
[1:02:59] god
[1:03:01] what can man do unto me my father which
[1:03:03] gave them me
[1:03:04] is greater than all and no man is able
[1:03:08] to pluck them
[1:03:08] out of my father's hand amen
[1:03:13] revelations 1 17 17-18
[1:03:18] and i saw and when i saw him i fell at
[1:03:20] his feet as dead
[1:03:22] and he laid his right hand upon me
[1:03:24] saying
[1:03:25] fear not i am the first and the last
[1:03:29] i am he that liveth and was dead and
[1:03:31] behold
[1:03:32] i am alive forevermore amen
[1:03:36] and have the keys of hell and death
[1:03:40] you know brother brandon say talks about
[1:03:42] it how satan had his feet
[1:03:44] up and he says i finally got him and
[1:03:46] suddenly there's a knock on the door and
[1:03:48] he said who could that be go see
[1:03:51] and he says ah you're here i've got you
[1:03:54] and he says oh
[1:03:54] no no i've just come to redeem claim
[1:03:58] back
[1:03:58] that which was lost amen he's the same
[1:04:02] yesterday today and forever
[1:04:05] ephesians 2 8-10
[1:04:09] for by grace you are saved through faith
[1:04:14] by grace god giving it to you
[1:04:18] but you have to accept it by faith
[1:04:20] brother branham said
[1:04:21] faith is a revelation and you know when
[1:04:24] you come to a time in your life
[1:04:26] maybe in your work something you're
[1:04:28] doing when suddenly
[1:04:30] it's like oh wow that's all it is that's
[1:04:33] all it takes
[1:04:34] that's you struggled with it and then it
[1:04:36] suddenly went together
[1:04:37] and that's what faith does when it
[1:04:40] clicks into your heart and you realize
[1:04:42] god's in charge of this he has it in his
[1:04:44] hands all i have to do is trust him
[1:04:47] i don't have to work through it i don't
[1:04:49] have to try to make it happen
[1:04:51] i just give it to god and say lord it's
[1:04:53] in your hands therefore i can praise you
[1:04:55] i can worship you i can give you honor
[1:04:58] and glory
[1:04:59] because it's in your hands and you never
[1:05:01] fail
[1:05:03] it would be nice if we could say that
[1:05:05] about each other but it doesn't always
[1:05:07] work that way we have the best
[1:05:08] intentions but we fail
[1:05:11] but he never fails
[1:05:14] he says for by grace are you saved
[1:05:17] through faith and that not of yourselves
[1:05:19] and i'm glad it's not of myself it is a
[1:05:22] gift of god
[1:05:25] grace without any respect to
[1:05:28] human worthiness he never said
[1:05:31] if you get this much a level of
[1:05:33] worthiness i'll finish it with grace
[1:05:35] he just said grace amen
[1:05:40] not of works lest any man should boast
[1:05:43] but lord i prayed all last week i didn't
[1:05:47] miss
[1:05:47] i if you're doing it for works it's of
[1:05:50] no
[1:05:51] avail if you're doing it because you
[1:05:53] love him you want her closer
[1:05:55] then it'll do you much good but when you
[1:05:58] say
[1:05:58] you know really what you're doing is i
[1:05:59] prayed all day click check i prayed all
[1:06:02] day check
[1:06:03] you're making a checklist it's for you
[1:06:04] not for him
[1:06:07] you know work out your own salvation
[1:06:09] with fear and trembling
[1:06:10] you do it's for you not for him he knows
[1:06:13] you're his
[1:06:15] he's not unsure of it he knows your hiss
[1:06:20] he says not by works neither this faith
[1:06:23] nor this salvation is owing to any works
[1:06:27] you
[1:06:27] ever did will do or can do
[1:06:31] when is it enough works to save yourself
[1:06:35] it never comes for we are
[1:06:38] his workmanship created in christ jesus
[1:06:41] unto good works
[1:06:43] which god hath before ordained that we
[1:06:46] should walk in them
[1:06:48] god already said this is what you're
[1:06:50] going to be this is what you're going to
[1:06:52] do
[1:06:53] lord let me yield to that let me say
[1:06:55] lord i'm in your hands
[1:06:57] we're the ones that struggle with it
[1:07:00] every part of this was by his planning
[1:07:04] and doing you say that i'm a puppet no
[1:07:07] he gave you free moral agency
[1:07:09] but he also knew that he would choose to
[1:07:11] say yes lord
[1:07:13] and that's what it's still all in his
[1:07:15] hands he philippians 2 13
[1:07:18] for it is god that worketh in you both
[1:07:21] to will
[1:07:22] and to do of his good pleasure
[1:07:26] he wants this out of you but he lets you
[1:07:28] he works it in you
[1:07:30] and i appreciate that of god because if
[1:07:33] it was left up to me
[1:07:35] on some days it would be good and on
[1:07:37] sundays it would be bad
[1:07:39] because you know you have your ups and
[1:07:41] downs in this life
[1:07:44] psalms 86 5
[1:07:48] for thou lord art good and ready to
[1:07:51] forgive
[1:07:53] and plenteous in mercy unto all of them
[1:07:57] that call upon thee
[1:08:00] and i just typed in there you're more
[1:08:02] than enough
[1:08:04] how much is enough whatever it is he's
[1:08:07] more than that
[1:08:08] if it's one he's two if it's two he's
[1:08:10] three
[1:08:12] through eternity psalms 103
[1:08:17] we'll go through verses one and four and
[1:08:19] then eight to twelve
[1:08:21] and like i said i'm gonna go through
[1:08:22] this quickly just as a background
[1:08:24] because i want to get into something
[1:08:25] here
[1:08:27] bless the lord o my soul and all that is
[1:08:30] within me bless his holy name
[1:08:33] let everything in me just give him
[1:08:35] praise
[1:08:36] everything let him praise be praised to
[1:08:39] him first
[1:08:41] you said well i i you know i want to do
[1:08:43] something nice for my wife
[1:08:44] but not because i'm a good person but
[1:08:46] because god has done it in me
[1:08:49] let it let him get glory out of it
[1:08:51] because then the motive is right
[1:08:53] the action is right it's not trying to
[1:08:55] be nice to her so i can get something
[1:08:57] back from her
[1:08:58] it's because the love of god is flowing
[1:09:00] through there
[1:09:02] he says bless the lord o my soul
[1:09:05] and forget not his benefits
[1:09:09] and i looked up the word benefits
[1:09:11] something that produces good or
[1:09:13] helpful results or affects or that
[1:09:16] promotes
[1:09:17] well-being so all his benefits promote
[1:09:20] well-being
[1:09:22] even when he says no
[1:09:26] you know sometimes when you say no to a
[1:09:28] child daddy and mama don't love me no
[1:09:29] more
[1:09:30] but you get a little bit older and you
[1:09:32] look back and say no it's because daddy
[1:09:33] and mama love me that they told me no
[1:09:37] who forgiveth all thine iniquities
[1:09:41] the things that you know better to do
[1:09:44] you do it anyways
[1:09:45] and the things that you should be doing
[1:09:47] but you don't he forgives you on that
[1:09:48] too
[1:09:51] now sometimes as parents we have a
[1:09:52] trouble forgiving that part
[1:09:54] i told you to do this and you didn't do
[1:09:56] it now you're going to get punished more
[1:09:58] for that
[1:09:59] but god doesn't do it that way hey
[1:10:00] that's a good louder man from brother
[1:10:02] hey we're parents okay you know how we
[1:10:06] do that sometimes well
[1:10:08] the girls will get in trouble in church
[1:10:10] when they were little
[1:10:12] and i would say now you know when you're
[1:10:14] in trouble in church you're going to get
[1:10:15] in trouble at home
[1:10:16] too and i i'm probably the only dad that
[1:10:19] did this
[1:10:20] maybe not but then we on the way home or
[1:10:24] so i would say well
[1:10:26] because you misbehaved when we get home
[1:10:30] you have your choice you can go straight
[1:10:32] to bed
[1:10:33] or you can get a spanking and then have
[1:10:36] a uh
[1:10:36] something to eat and go to bed
[1:10:40] and you know i don't know some of you
[1:10:42] are probably judging me right now but
[1:10:43] that's what i did
[1:10:46] and one day sarah had misbehaved in
[1:10:49] church
[1:10:50] and he got home and i told her that and
[1:10:52] i said now what do you choose
[1:10:55] and she said i choose for spanking so i
[1:10:57] spanked her and then i sent her to bed
[1:11:00] i didn't keep my word and she never let
[1:11:03] me forget
[1:11:04] she still doesn't let me forget because
[1:11:07] we're human
[1:11:09] but he forgiveth all fine iniquities
[1:11:13] and remember them no more who healeth
[1:11:16] all thy diseases who redeemeth thy life
[1:11:20] from destruction
[1:11:22] who
[1:11:25] crowneth thee with loving-kindness and
[1:11:28] tender mercies he takes your life from
[1:11:32] the pit
[1:11:32] he encompathy with loving-kindness and
[1:11:35] tender mercies
[1:11:38] even when you feel like you didn't
[1:11:39] deserve it and you know you didn't
[1:11:41] deserve it he does anyways
[1:11:44] the lord is merciful and gracious slow
[1:11:47] to anger
[1:11:48] and plenteous in mercy
[1:11:51] he will not always chide neither will
[1:11:53] keep his anger forever
[1:11:58] he hath not dealt with us after our sins
[1:12:01] nor rewarded us
[1:12:02] after our iniquities for
[1:12:06] as the heaven is high above the earth so
[1:12:08] great is his mercy
[1:12:10] towards them that fear him respect him
[1:12:13] reverence
[1:12:13] know who he is and love him
[1:12:17] fear not being afraid of him but rather
[1:12:20] giving him the honor and respect
[1:12:22] that he deserves and as far as the east
[1:12:25] is
[1:12:26] from the west so far hath he removed
[1:12:29] our transgressions from us
[1:12:33] how else could he look at us how else
[1:12:36] could he stand it's because he's holy
[1:12:38] he's righteous if the angels have to
[1:12:41] cover their face
[1:12:42] with two of their wings who have never
[1:12:45] sinned and never
[1:12:46] and stand in his presence and they can't
[1:12:48] look at him how could
[1:12:50] we without
[1:12:53] him forgiving us he claims this it's
[1:12:57] it's more than sometimes you can even
[1:12:58] believe and understand
[1:13:01] psalms 46 1-5
[1:13:06] god is our refuge and strength a
[1:13:09] very present help in the time of trouble
[1:13:12] you know what that tells me i don't have
[1:13:15] to
[1:13:15] call him from way over there to bring
[1:13:18] him down here
[1:13:20] say lord and he tells me you know what
[1:13:23] i'm on the other side of town right now
[1:13:25] it's going to take me a while to get
[1:13:26] there
[1:13:28] but he's a very present help in the time
[1:13:32] of trouble
[1:13:33] he said i'll never leave you i'll never
[1:13:36] leave you i'll be by your side
[1:13:40] he says
[1:13:43] therefore we will we will not therefore
[1:13:46] will not we fear
[1:13:48] though the earth be removed and though
[1:13:51] the mountain be carried
[1:13:52] into the midst of the sea and let me
[1:13:55] tell you what about this earth you're
[1:13:56] living in right now
[1:13:58] this portion of this earth and though
[1:14:00] that part be moved
[1:14:02] though the doctor says this about you
[1:14:04] though this
[1:14:05] he says therefore we will not fear
[1:14:09] we will not let uh something take a hold
[1:14:12] of us that that
[1:14:12] ties us down that holds us down that
[1:14:15] where we can't move we can't walk
[1:14:16] forward we
[1:14:17] we can't even praise god
[1:14:21] sometimes fear will do that to you you
[1:14:23] can't even you can't even voice out
[1:14:25] anything you're just frozen in place
[1:14:28] but i will not do that in the midst of
[1:14:30] all of this i will still praise him i
[1:14:32] will still worship him and i'll still
[1:14:33] give him honor and glory
[1:14:36] he says and though the mountains be
[1:14:38] carried into the midst of the sea
[1:14:41] though the waters therefore thereof roar
[1:14:43] and be troubled
[1:14:45] though the mountains shake with the
[1:14:47] swelling thereof
[1:14:50] and then he says there is a river
[1:14:54] the streams whereof shall make glad the
[1:14:57] city of god
[1:14:59] the holy place of the tabernacle of the
[1:15:01] most high
[1:15:02] god is in the midst of her she shall not
[1:15:05] be moved
[1:15:06] god shall help her and that right early
[1:15:10] before you're up he's up there already
[1:15:14] lord i'm getting up at two o'clock in
[1:15:16] the morning to for this and that and he
[1:15:18] said well i've been up since one waiting
[1:15:19] for you
[1:15:22] i'm going over here don't worry he says
[1:15:23] i've been there it'll be okay
[1:15:26] psalms 27 1-5 and
[1:15:30] these are all well-known but i was just
[1:15:33] looking through some of these things
[1:15:35] the lord is my light and my salvation
[1:15:38] whom shall i fear
[1:15:41] you know who i need to fear the least
[1:15:43] myself
[1:15:45] because i get afraid of myself i get
[1:15:47] scared of myself in the sense that oh
[1:15:49] you messed up again
[1:15:51] you did this again you're not even
[1:15:53] worthy god won't hear your prayers
[1:15:57] but you know if you're looking at
[1:15:58] yourself that's as far as you go but
[1:16:00] look at his promises that he made to you
[1:16:04] and say then i have no nothing to fear i
[1:16:07] just have to say lord i'm sorry

[1:18:45] where i really wanted to get to here
[1:18:48] if i may may the lord help me just to
[1:18:52] to share it this way isaiah
[1:18:56] chapter 1 verse 18.
[1:19:00] last wednesday night we talked about him
[1:19:01] being our kinsmen and redeemer
[1:19:06] kinsmen somebody related to you you say
[1:19:09] god related to me
[1:19:10] yes he took on human flesh
[1:19:13] to become your kinsmen redeemer because
[1:19:15] that's what the law
[1:19:16] required he says come now
[1:19:20] let us reason together saith the lord
[1:19:25] so what did you bring to this reasoning
[1:19:28] sins that were scarlet
[1:19:34] and then what did he bring to this
[1:19:36] reasoning together
[1:19:37] they shall be as white as snow
[1:19:41] though they be red like crimson they
[1:19:44] shall be wool pure
[1:19:48] white clean lord this is
[1:19:52] all i have to you and the best i can
[1:19:54] give you is nothing but
[1:19:56] nothing and he says well i can take that
[1:19:59] nothing and make it into something
[1:20:02] that's in isaiah the first chapter
[1:20:05] he's talking let's reason this and then
[1:20:07] he goes to in verse 7 verse 14 and these
[1:20:10] are very
[1:20:10] well known familiar verses therefore the
[1:20:14] lord himself shall give you a sign
[1:20:16] in this reasoning that he's talking
[1:20:18] about he'll give you a sign behold a
[1:20:20] virgin shall conceive
[1:20:22] and bear a son and shall call his name
[1:20:26] emmanuel god with us
[1:20:32] now he's doing something about that
[1:20:33] reasoning time together
[1:20:36] isaiah 9 6-7
[1:20:40] look now isaiah 9
[1:20:45] verse 6 and 7 for unto us a child is
[1:20:48] born
[1:20:49] unto us a son is given the government
[1:20:53] shall be upon his shoulder
[1:20:54] and his name shall be called wonderful
[1:20:57] counselor the mighty god
[1:20:59] the everlasting father the prince of
[1:21:02] peace when i say jesus
[1:21:06] what do i get i get
[1:21:11] the head of the government that's on his
[1:21:12] shoulder i get him and his name shall be
[1:21:15] called wonderful
[1:21:16] counselor the mighty god everlasting
[1:21:18] father
[1:21:19] the prince of peace when you call my
[1:21:22] name
[1:21:23] you say brother aaron this is who you
[1:21:25] get
[1:21:27] whether you like it or not it's who you
[1:21:28] get
[1:21:30] but he said come let's reason together
[1:21:32] this is what you bring
[1:21:34] let me show you what i'm bringing of the
[1:21:37] increase of his government
[1:21:39] and peace there shall be no end
[1:21:43] upon the throne of david and upon his
[1:21:45] kingdom to order it
[1:21:46] and to establish it with judgment and
[1:21:48] with justice
[1:21:49] from henforth even forever the zeal of
[1:21:53] the lord
[1:21:54] of hosts will perform this
[1:21:57] and he keeps his word he
[1:22:00] never fails
[1:22:04] so i want to get into this we'll read
[1:22:07] those quotes there out of
[1:22:10] i'm going to go ahead and and no we'll
[1:22:13] read all of them we'll start with that
[1:22:14] first
[1:22:15] one from israel and the church
[1:22:18] and then we're going to read a series
[1:22:20] out of the breach
[1:22:22] between the seven church ages in the
[1:22:24] seven seals look he says and jesus said
[1:22:27] if a house be divided against itself
[1:22:30] if satan cast out satan then his kingdom
[1:22:33] is divided
[1:22:35] don't you don't you underestimate the
[1:22:37] devil
[1:22:38] he says that's right he's too smart for
[1:22:41] that satan ain't going to cast himself
[1:22:43] out he just got you confused that's all
[1:22:46] no sir
[1:22:47] satan can't cast out satan me cast
[1:22:50] myself out
[1:22:50] why i know better than that notice and
[1:22:53] don't you underestimate jesus christ
[1:22:56] either because he's the power over all
[1:22:59] powers
[1:23:00] don't be afraid of satan as long as
[1:23:02] you're in him as long as you're in jesus
[1:23:04] he says
[1:23:05] but if you're not him you better tremble
[1:23:08] but if you're in him
[1:23:09] not even death itself can harm you
[1:23:13] you're free from all fear oh when i
[1:23:16] think of that i want to
[1:23:17] shout hallelujah
[1:23:21] amen when you realize
[1:23:24] i'm in him and he's in me
[1:23:27] so i had thought about playing this
[1:23:30] portion but
[1:23:32] i i broke it up just to shorten it up in
[1:23:34] some portions so we'll read through it
[1:23:37] the breach all this this series will be
[1:23:39] in the breach
[1:23:41] and this is the portion of the kinsman
[1:23:44] redeemer
[1:23:45] when john's there in revelations 5
[1:23:49] and john is looking and he says who
[1:23:52] hears
[1:23:52] who is worthy to open the book
[1:23:58] and and brother branham describes it so
[1:24:00] let's just read it first and
[1:24:02] and then an angel came forth a strong
[1:24:04] angel proclaiming
[1:24:05] with a loud voice who is worthy to open
[1:24:08] the book to take the book
[1:24:10] who was able to open the seals who who
[1:24:13] was
[1:24:14] able to open the book see the angel
[1:24:16] asked it and john sought
[1:24:17] he said now who is worthy let him oh my
[1:24:21] maybe i'm just filling this this this
[1:24:24] away
[1:24:25] but led him said the angel let him here
[1:24:27] is the book of redemption
[1:24:29] here is the plan of redemption here is
[1:24:32] the only way you'll ever be redeemed
[1:24:36] for here is a title deed to redemption
[1:24:38] of the whole heavens of the earth
[1:24:40] that which was lost when adam and eve
[1:24:44] disobeyed they were the gods of this
[1:24:48] earth
[1:24:49] it listened to them it was subject to
[1:24:51] them
[1:24:52] there was no fear there was no hatred
[1:24:54] there was no animal against
[1:24:56] the lion could lay down by the lamb
[1:24:59] but it was lost
[1:25:04] he says let them come
[1:25:07] forth if he will oh my now speak or
[1:25:09] forever hold this peace
[1:25:11] let him come forward and claim this book
[1:25:13] who is worthy do it
[1:25:14] to do it and john said there was no man
[1:25:17] in heaven found worthy no man on
[1:25:20] earth found worthy no man beneath the
[1:25:22] earth that ever lived and died was found
[1:25:25] worthy
[1:25:26] no man was found worthy the angel's
[1:25:29] call was a call to the kinsmen redeemer
[1:25:32] to appear
[1:25:33] god said i have a law a kinsmen redeemer
[1:25:36] can be a substitute where is that
[1:25:39] kinsmen
[1:25:40] redeemer who is able to take it and it
[1:25:43] come from adam
[1:25:44] all the way down through all the
[1:25:45] apostles and prophets and everything
[1:25:47] else
[1:25:48] and nobody was found now what about that
[1:25:51] nobody in heaven nobody on earth
[1:25:53] nobody ever lived elijah was standing
[1:25:56] there moses was standing there
[1:25:58] all the apostles were standing there or
[1:26:00] all the ones that had died
[1:26:02] all the holy men job the sages everyone
[1:26:05] was standing there and nobody was worthy
[1:26:08] even to look at the book
[1:26:10] let alone take and break the seals
[1:26:15] could you imagine being there in front
[1:26:18] and you're asking
[1:26:19] for help and all you hear nobody can
[1:26:23] nobody will nobody is able to that's all
[1:26:26] you see
[1:26:28] well after a while you're just going to
[1:26:30] throw your hands up and say
[1:26:31] it's useless it's no hope
[1:26:35] he says and he wasn't found so john
[1:26:38] broke out oh everything was lost and he
[1:26:40] wept bitterly and
[1:26:42] and he was sad because everything the
[1:26:44] whole creation
[1:26:45] everything was gone if they couldn't
[1:26:47] find somebody
[1:26:48] hold glory to god if they couldn't find
[1:26:51] somebody that can meet the requirements
[1:26:53] there
[1:26:53] every human being and the whole world in
[1:26:56] creation was gone
[1:26:58] oh everything had fallen the rights of
[1:27:00] redemption the rights of eternal life
[1:27:02] the light
[1:27:03] all these rights had been forfeited and
[1:27:06] there was nobody who could pay the price
[1:27:10] and john starts crying because no one
[1:27:12] was worthy
[1:27:14] and no one could ever look at the book
[1:27:16] oh it took a human
[1:27:18] being john wept because no one could do
[1:27:21] it
[1:27:22] and everything was lost
[1:27:26] i don't know how john must have felt to
[1:27:30] be in the presence of all that and said
[1:27:32] but nobody here can do this
[1:27:37] nobody has a key to unlock it
[1:27:40] and the despair and the hopelessness
[1:27:42] that would come upon you
[1:27:45] john looked at that lamb now
[1:27:48] i i've jumped ahead here because he
[1:27:50] repeats himself over and over but
[1:27:53] the lamb has come to take the book and
[1:27:55] he says john looked at that lamb and the
[1:27:57] lamb looked like he had been slain
[1:27:59] and then he noticed he was wounded and
[1:28:01] cut and bruised and bleeding
[1:28:03] a bloody dam that's what took our plate
[1:28:06] place isn't it strange a simple lamb
[1:28:09] had to take our place and he saw the
[1:28:11] lamb he proceeded out
[1:28:14] john hadn't saw him because he had been
[1:28:16] way back
[1:28:17] into the eternities even making
[1:28:20] intercession and showing that those who
[1:28:22] who had come to god under the offering
[1:28:25] of the blood of bulls and goats
[1:28:26] a substitutionary offering he also
[1:28:29] caused
[1:28:30] them who believed it pointed to him
[1:28:35] god shall provide when isaac asked
[1:28:37] abraham
[1:28:38] father where is the sacrifice he said
[1:28:40] god
[1:28:41] will provide and the blood had not been
[1:28:45] yet been shed
[1:28:46] so he was there to clear them he was
[1:28:49] there to clear you and i
[1:28:52] and oh god i hope he is here tonight for
[1:28:54] every sinner
[1:28:55] the lamb been slain how can jehovah see
[1:28:59] anything but that bloody lamb
[1:29:01] standing there what he's been he's been
[1:29:04] an intercessor
[1:29:05] no other person tell me where mary could
[1:29:07] make the intercessions then
[1:29:10] what could mary offer who what could
[1:29:13] saint francis saint assisi or any saint
[1:29:15] cecilia rather
[1:29:16] or any other human being john never saw
[1:29:20] a
[1:29:20] thousand saints come out of the
[1:29:22] mediatorial he was the
[1:29:24] lamb he was a lamb that had been slain
[1:29:26] bloody
[1:29:27] i don't care how many saints had been
[1:29:29] slain they were
[1:29:30] all duet every one of them like the
[1:29:32] thief at the cross
[1:29:35] we have sinned and we are due this but
[1:29:37] this man has done nothing
[1:29:40] he was the only man that was worthy
[1:29:43] the lamb is the only mediator see he was
[1:29:46] the one that came forth
[1:29:48] what did he do now he's been back there
[1:29:50] inner city
[1:29:51] interceding until his blood has a tone
[1:29:54] for every person
[1:29:55] and the lamb now knows what's written in
[1:29:58] the book
[1:29:59] so he's known from the foundation of the
[1:30:01] world their names were in there so he
[1:30:03] stood back here
[1:30:05] and but done mediator work like
[1:30:08] this until meditorial work till everyone
[1:30:11] that's been
[1:30:12] put in the book has been redeemed
[1:30:16] come and i will not lose a single one of
[1:30:19] them
[1:30:20] he says he stayed there till he made
[1:30:23] sure
[1:30:23] every one of them
[1:30:27] notice he is not an animal he took the
[1:30:30] book out of the right hand of him that
[1:30:32] sat upon that on who was that
[1:30:34] the owner the original owner that had
[1:30:36] the book of redemption in his right hand
[1:30:39] and no angel no angelic being nothing
[1:30:42] else could take that place
[1:30:44] and this bloody lamb walked out took the
[1:30:46] book out of his hand
[1:30:48] what was it brother it is the most
[1:30:51] sublime
[1:30:52] thing in the scripture
[1:30:57] an act that not an angel or nothing
[1:31:00] could do it so he said
[1:31:02] father not my will thy will be done
[1:31:07] the most sublime act he says
[1:31:11] and the lamb come and took it
[1:31:16] and they're in there i didn't and didn't
[1:31:17] include it in there but there's one
[1:31:19] where
[1:31:20] that lamb is telling the father he says
[1:31:22] you know
[1:31:23] i did i he was the only one that could
[1:31:25] stand
[1:31:26] and and say i did i was the one i took
[1:31:29] care of it i met the requirements
[1:31:32] and it's been met but i just that
[1:31:36] thought
[1:31:37] and the sublime the most sublime
[1:31:41] it's a blink work that has ever
[1:31:44] been done it should make our heart so
[1:31:48] happy
[1:31:50] it should make us rejoice to think that
[1:31:52] he said
[1:31:54] i'm going to restore them i'm going to
[1:31:56] bring them back
[1:31:58] why because he wants that fellowship
[1:32:02] that he
[1:32:02] had in the beginning when
[1:32:07] adam and eve were there nothing to
[1:32:10] interfere
[1:32:11] no fear no no no contrary spirit
[1:32:14] it was nothing but pure love
[1:32:17] it was god expressing that with that
[1:32:20] part of him that he created
[1:32:21] and you were in that earth there too
[1:32:24] that he created
[1:32:25] and he's desiring that fellowship with
[1:32:27] you
[1:32:28] and he says i want to do this i want to
[1:32:31] go back
[1:32:31] i want to bring them back to me
[1:32:34] because he desires it it made me think
[1:32:37] and as time
[1:32:38] of adam and eve standing there on the
[1:32:40] outside looking back and saying
[1:32:42] oh how much they must have missed it how
[1:32:45] much their heart desired to go back
[1:32:47] there but they couldn't
[1:32:49] there was a chairman's with a flaming
[1:32:51] sword to guard the way of life
[1:32:54] it could not be perverted in any way it
[1:32:55] could not be broken down and we had to
[1:32:57] remain pure
[1:33:00] but the desire was still there and and
[1:33:02] and i was
[1:33:03] talking with brother arne imagine
[1:33:05] what adam and eve must have felt when
[1:33:07] cain kills abel
[1:33:11] it tore their hearts apart to see that
[1:33:13] one son would destroy the other
[1:33:17] they had to know why they were still so
[1:33:20] close to god
[1:33:22] they had to know the reason why but it
[1:33:24] still broke their hearts
[1:33:26] the story got carried out each one is
[1:33:28] would tell it to their children and the
[1:33:29] children's children
[1:33:30] what it used to be like i didn't have to
[1:33:33] come out here and pull the weeds i
[1:33:34] didn't have to sweat
[1:33:36] i just spoke and those things happened
[1:33:39] brother and that sounds like a fantasy
[1:33:41] world call it what you want but it's
[1:33:42] what it was
[1:33:45] it was what god had made in the first
[1:33:47] place
[1:33:48] but they'd fallen away from it and god
[1:33:52] desiring that
[1:33:53] fellowship again to walk with his
[1:33:56] children to be with his children
[1:33:58] to come in the cool of the evening and
[1:34:00] say how was your day
[1:34:03] you know what happened and they would
[1:34:05] begin to talk with him and just have a
[1:34:07] wonderful fellowship
[1:34:10] no they didn't roast any steaks
[1:34:13] uh first thing we thought we're gonna
[1:34:14] have hamburgers and this we're gonna do
[1:34:15] no you know what
[1:34:17] it was a fellowship a pure honest
[1:34:20] truthful a place which you could lay
[1:34:23] down and sleep with no fear whatsoever
[1:34:24] you could rest with no fear whatsoever
[1:34:27] he could come in the cool of the evening
[1:34:29] and and they'd be waiting for him
[1:34:32] but one day he comes back in the cool of
[1:34:35] the evening
[1:34:36] and they're not at the usual place
[1:34:40] and he says adam where art thou he knew
[1:34:43] where they were
[1:34:44] adam and eve had hid they said we can't
[1:34:47] be in the presence of a holy god anymore
[1:34:49] we have sinned
[1:34:51] we have fallen from his grace he'll look
[1:34:53] at us
[1:34:54] and he'll say no i can't even be around
[1:34:56] you anymore.
[1:34:59] so how how are we going to meet god
[1:35:01] let's cover ourselves some way
[1:35:03] let's oh let's take these fake leaves
[1:35:06] are the big let's make something let's
[1:35:07] make a covering let's make a religion to
[1:35:09] get ourselves back to god
[1:35:12] and if we're not careful we still make a
[1:35:14] religion to get ourselves to god
[1:35:15] if i can do some of this if i get enough
[1:35:18] of this if i can
[1:35:19] read so many scriptures and pray so much
[1:35:21] i'll make a good covering to give myself
[1:35:23] into the presence of god
[1:35:26] no he said come let's read a reason
[1:35:28] together
[1:35:29] you bring your best works and they are
[1:35:32] filthy
[1:35:32] but i'll bring what i've done and your
[1:35:34] sins will be
[1:35:36] white again it'll be as never happened
[1:35:38] before
[1:35:41] and that's what he did when he took the
[1:35:44] book
[1:35:45] and said i have taken it
[1:35:48] have cleared it oh what a savior
[1:35:53] oh what a mighty god one that's worthy
[1:35:56] to be worshipped and praised and honored
[1:35:58] and exalted
[1:36:01] high above anything else
[1:36:04] to think that
[1:36:07] you see through there in the book of
[1:36:10] ruth
[1:36:12] a perfect type in the law of a kinsmen
[1:36:13] redeemer
[1:36:16] and all she had to do was rest
[1:36:19] and let him do the work but it doesn't
[1:36:22] take long when we want to help him
[1:36:25] we want to get in the middle of it i can
[1:36:27] help you daddy
[1:36:28] i can hold this end of it i can do this
[1:36:31] i can do that
[1:36:34] abby sent us a picture the other day a
[1:36:35] snap of amos working on the
[1:36:38] truck he's restoring and little asher
[1:36:40] sprawled out there in his
[1:36:42] pants and all under the truck with daddy
[1:36:44] like i can help you daddy
[1:36:46] you know that's a neat picture but you
[1:36:48] know what
[1:36:49] daddy daddy is really doesn't need him
[1:36:51] there because
[1:36:52] he can't help him right now you know and
[1:36:56] sometimes we get in the middle of the
[1:36:57] picture and say lord
[1:36:58] i can help you if i do this it'll help
[1:37:00] you and he says no i don't need your
[1:37:02] help
[1:37:02] i just need your rest your peace i just
[1:37:04] need you to take me out my word
[1:37:06] i just need you to just express that
[1:37:08] confidence in what i've done
[1:37:11] take it by faith for without faith it is
[1:37:15] impossible to please god
[1:37:18] because without faith fear comes in
[1:37:22] and fear brings works and fear brings
[1:37:25] things i've got to do this
[1:37:26] i haven't done enough i haven't met this
[1:37:28] and i've got to work harder harder and
[1:37:30] harder
[1:37:31] but jesus paid it all all to him i owe
[1:37:35] now what you do back to god is not for
[1:37:38] salvation but because you love him
[1:37:40] because you want to love him and show
[1:37:42] your love and respect back to him
[1:37:44] that's a true relationship right there
[1:37:49] we go through the scriptures and and
[1:37:51] each one
[1:37:53] uh the different the different books
[1:37:55] showing a
[1:37:56] portion of this work a part of it
[1:38:00] and and you look into indu i think it
[1:38:02] was my daughter elizabeth that she's
[1:38:03] reading through the book of jeremiah and
[1:38:05] it seems like god is angry through the
[1:38:06] whole book of jeremiah
[1:38:09] he's constantly telling him but then
[1:38:12] jeremiah 29 11 turn around says i know
[1:38:15] the plans that i have
[1:38:16] towards you i know what you look like
[1:38:18] and i know what i'm saying but i know
[1:38:19] what i'm going to accomplish in this
[1:38:23] he's not afraid of it he's not saying oh
[1:38:25] i've lost it
[1:38:27] look at him when he turns around and he
[1:38:30] tells moses
[1:38:31] get out of the way i'm going to destroy
[1:38:34] these people
[1:38:35] and i'm going to raise up a whole new
[1:38:37] nation that will serve me
[1:38:40] do you think he was surprised by moses
[1:38:42] answer no
[1:38:44] he knew what was coming when moses said
[1:38:46] oh no you're not
[1:38:48] you're going to have to go through me
[1:38:50] because what are they going to say about
[1:38:51] you they're going to say you're like any
[1:38:53] other god
[1:38:55] but you're the god of gods you're the
[1:38:57] only true god
[1:39:00] he knows exactly what he's doing and
[1:39:01] what's going on
[1:39:04] to know that to see as what he did
[1:39:08] through each each one and and you read
[1:39:10] the stories
[1:39:11] you get into the book of daniel and and
[1:39:13] what daniel goes through
[1:39:15] and and in the process of what he puts
[1:39:17] daniel through to be able to bring out
[1:39:20] to what is going to happen later on in
[1:39:22] life
[1:39:23] how it's all going to be fulfilled each
[1:39:25] one of the prophets laying out something
[1:39:27] that is a portion of god
[1:39:30] although sometimes it seemed like all it
[1:39:31] was god was angry
[1:39:34] at israel because it seemed like all
[1:39:36] they did was fail them
[1:39:38] i'm sorry but sometimes that seems like
[1:39:40] us isn't it it seems like all we do is
[1:39:42] fail you lord
[1:39:44] if i could just stay in this atmosphere
[1:39:46] a little longer lord i know i could
[1:39:47] please you
[1:39:49] and then like i said suddenly you
[1:39:50] remember you got to go do this
[1:39:52] the phone rings something happens and
[1:39:55] and
[1:39:56] that is broken but he knows
[1:40:00] what he's doing to bring that up
[1:40:03] oh what a savior what a kinsmen reading
[1:40:07] to think that isaiah there
[1:40:12] 7 and 14 behold a virgin
[1:40:16] shall conceive man is going to not have
[1:40:20] anything to do with us
[1:40:25] and his name shall be called
[1:40:28] emmanuel god with us
[1:40:32] wonderful counselor the mighty god the
[1:40:35] everlasting father
[1:40:36] the prince of peace
[1:40:40] and he begins to explain as he's talking
[1:40:42] and he's laying this out in the book of
[1:40:44] isaiah
[1:40:45] but the day comes
[1:40:48] when the angel comes and says hail mary
[1:40:52] blessed art thou thou has found favor
[1:40:58] and you know brother branham
[1:41:01] if you read there and brother and was
[1:41:02] talking and and i know sometimes that
[1:41:05] you say well it was just brother brad
[1:41:07] i'm talking but he was a prophet
[1:41:10] and god sent his thoughts to the prophet
[1:41:14] am i saying that it happened exactly
[1:41:16] like brother no he just allowed it to be
[1:41:18] but it's giving us and letting us go she
[1:41:20] was just as human as you and i
[1:41:23] but she's saying how can this be but
[1:41:25] something in her heart said
[1:41:27] this is the promise of isaiah
[1:41:30] she said she said that something did
[1:41:32] something let her say
[1:41:33] be it unto me according to thy word
[1:41:36] something made her react to that that
[1:41:38] was god in her working
[1:41:40] because it was not going to be mary
[1:41:43] producing this
[1:41:44] it was god it was going to produce this
[1:41:46] because he was going back to isaiah
[1:41:48] and saying that's going to be fulfilled
[1:41:51] because there's going to come a day
[1:41:53] that this book of redemption is going to
[1:41:55] have to be opened
[1:41:58] and there's only going to be one worthy
[1:41:59] one to do it
[1:42:02] he grows up in life and me and brother
[1:42:04] arnie were talking about it
[1:42:05] he grew up and and and and he learned by
[1:42:08] his experiences
[1:42:10] he had to learn how to get along with
[1:42:11] his brothers he had to learn how to get
[1:42:13] along with mother and father
[1:42:15] he had to learn to get along all around
[1:42:18] him because he wore a human
[1:42:19] a body and made a flesh so he could
[1:42:22] understand that
[1:42:25] so he could be touched by the feeling of
[1:42:27] our infirmities
[1:42:30] it's hard to understand but yes that's
[1:42:32] what he did
[1:42:34] so when you say i'm having trouble i'm
[1:42:37] having these feelings
[1:42:38] i'm going through this he says i
[1:42:40] understand i've been there
[1:42:42] the scripture says he was tempted in
[1:42:44] tried
[1:42:45] in every manner that man is tried in
[1:42:49] i can't explain it but his word says so
[1:42:52] so amen it's true
[1:42:56] he comes to a place in his life look
[1:42:59] he goes into the temple and and and the
[1:43:03] priests there
[1:43:04] are selling they're buying they're
[1:43:06] they're making merchandise there
[1:43:07] it's their business and he takes a road
[1:43:10] and a rope and he cords it up
[1:43:12] or records and makes a rope out of it
[1:43:13] and he whips them and he beats them out
[1:43:15] of the
[1:43:16] out of the you've made my father's house
[1:43:19] a den of thieves
[1:43:22] he showed a sight of him that could have
[1:43:24] taken a rope and whipped this nation
[1:43:26] into
[1:43:27] obedience but watch him when he's there
[1:43:31] at calvary
[1:43:33] at the cross before he's there and
[1:43:35] they're spitting on him and they're
[1:43:36] slapping them they're plucking their
[1:43:38] beard and he's not answering he's meek
[1:43:40] he's humble he's lowly as a lamb
[1:43:44] because he's fulfilling that for you and
[1:43:46] for me
[1:43:48] he uttered not a word he said
[1:43:51] i could call angels in there
[1:43:54] but he had you in mind
[1:43:58] you were part of him that's why
[1:44:01] and he said father forgive them they
[1:44:04] don't know what they're doing
[1:44:07] this is that kinsmen redeemer
[1:44:11] and he's looking he's there he's looking
[1:44:14] over he's
[1:44:15] checking he's could i say he's going
[1:44:17] through the scriptures and saying is
[1:44:19] this fulfilled
[1:44:20] is this fulfilled is that promise
[1:44:22] fulfilled is this covered
[1:44:23] is this done it is
[1:44:27] finished every bit of it is covered
[1:44:31] the way for redemption the road back has
[1:44:34] been made clear
[1:44:37] but he didn't stop there he didn't say
[1:44:40] that's enough
[1:44:42] his blood had been shed he said it is
[1:44:44] finished and gave up the ghost
[1:44:47] and he says now i'm going to go down to
[1:44:49] that place
[1:44:50] where they deserve to go and i'm going
[1:44:54] in their place down into the pits of
[1:44:57] hell
[1:44:58] and i'm going to take the keys of death
[1:45:01] in hell and i'm going to tear them out
[1:45:03] of that squatter's hands the one that
[1:45:05] took him
[1:45:06] and they're not his they're mine and i'm
[1:45:09] going back for those who died under the
[1:45:11] blood
[1:45:12] of bulls and goats those who died with
[1:45:15] that
[1:45:16] sacrifice laying on the altar saying
[1:45:19] it's what he said they struck and they
[1:45:22] put the
[1:45:23] the blood on the post and the death
[1:45:26] angel passed by them
[1:45:28] i'm going there for them so that job
[1:45:32] could say
[1:45:33] i know my redeemer liveth that's him
[1:45:35] there
[1:45:37] so so abraham could turn around and look
[1:45:40] at sarah and say
[1:45:41] that city that we were looking for there
[1:45:43] it is
[1:45:46] he says i'm going to fulfill that part
[1:45:48] oh the joy
[1:45:50] in him to be able to do that that part
[1:45:53] come on saints he said let's get out of
[1:45:55] here we're going back up to that place
[1:45:58] now it is finished
[1:46:01] the work has been done worthy is the
[1:46:04] lamb
[1:46:08] and then he comes back you know
[1:46:12] just going through this portion of the
[1:46:14] new testament just
[1:46:17] he's been crucified he's been put in a
[1:46:20] grave
[1:46:21] they saw it they saw it happen they knew
[1:46:24] where
[1:46:25] they went they went back to their avenue
[1:46:26] where he had been laid they didn't have
[1:46:28] to go ask peter and then ran back to it
[1:46:31] but he wasn't there anymore and they go
[1:46:34] hide they're afraid but mary and them
[1:46:38] come
[1:46:38] looking now mary and them came looking
[1:46:40] to anoint his body
[1:46:41] they expected him to be in the grave
[1:46:44] they brought oils tonight but had he not
[1:46:47] said in three days
[1:46:49] i will rise
[1:46:52] has he not said i will never forsake you
[1:46:54] and then sometimes you're saying where
[1:46:55] are you god
[1:46:57] we're still the same but he's still the
[1:46:59] same
[1:47:00] he never fails and he tells mary
[1:47:04] go tell my disciples
[1:47:08] that i am risen
[1:47:11] i've already done it all i've gone down
[1:47:13] their redemption plan i
[1:47:15] have risen
[1:47:18] but there's there's two two brothers
[1:47:20] walking back to emmaus
[1:47:22] two of the two of those that gathered at
[1:47:24] church and were part of it and they're
[1:47:25] what
[1:47:26] and they're broken heart they're going
[1:47:27] back home it's over
[1:47:30] and he draws himself nigh close to them
[1:47:34] not because he didn't know but because
[1:47:36] he did know what they were going through
[1:47:38] what they were thinking what they were
[1:47:39] feeling
[1:47:40] he drew nigh to them and he said what
[1:47:42] manner of conversation what are you guys
[1:47:44] talking about
[1:47:45] you know and and they turn around and
[1:47:47] look at him and say where have you been
[1:47:49] this has been in the news i mean it's
[1:47:51] made all i mean
[1:47:53] every station is carrying it haven't you
[1:47:55] heard this
[1:47:56] jesus of nathers whom we thought he's
[1:47:59] been crucified
[1:48:00] and it's been three days now
[1:48:03] and he begins to walk with him aren't
[1:48:06] you glad that he still walks
[1:48:08] with you he draws nigh he draws up close
[1:48:11] even when you've made a mess of your
[1:48:12] life he'll still drop nice draw up close
[1:48:14] and say
[1:48:15] i'll walk with you
[1:48:18] all the way until and they didn't
[1:48:21] surprise him when they said
[1:48:22] come come in and eat with us he knew
[1:48:25] where he was going to be
[1:48:26] he knew what he was going to do he said
[1:48:28] good now i'm going to get to show you
[1:48:29] who i am by many
[1:48:33] infallible proofs it showed
[1:48:36] what was written had been fulfilled
[1:48:41] and then they see him oh and
[1:48:44] don't let me forget this i love this
[1:48:46] part and
[1:48:48] peter 2. i think of that quite often
[1:48:53] peter who had just told him oh
[1:48:56] don't let this happen to you i will be
[1:48:58] with you in england you're going to deny
[1:49:00] me three times peter
[1:49:03] and after peter denies him three times
[1:49:05] peter is hiding and shame
[1:49:07] but he says go tell my disciples and
[1:49:10] peter too sometimes you have to put your
[1:49:13] name right there where peter's name is
[1:49:16] and aaron ii and
[1:49:19] rachel put your name in there you're
[1:49:21] included
[1:49:24] and then they see him ascend into heaven
[1:49:29] and he says as you have seen me ascend
[1:49:32] you'll see me
[1:49:33] come back but go
[1:49:37] into the city of jerusalem and wait
[1:49:40] until you're endued from the power from
[1:49:42] on high
[1:49:44] what a different peter on that side but
[1:49:46] you know peter passed away
[1:49:49] you know all then filled with the holy
[1:49:51] ghost passed away
[1:49:52] every one of them oh but there is coming
[1:49:55] today
[1:49:57] and lord willing it's very soon it won't
[1:50:00] be long now
[1:50:01] any day now count the years as months
[1:50:05] count the months as weeks count the
[1:50:07] weeks as days
[1:50:09] any day now we'll be going home
[1:50:12] but to imagine this redeemer
[1:50:16] this kinsman redeemer who did it for me
[1:50:20] for you to take us back
[1:50:23] to be with you one who said father
[1:50:27] forgive them they don't know what we're
[1:50:28] doing
[1:50:30] and their sins were discarded but now
[1:50:32] they are white as snow
[1:50:33] redemption he was able to take the book
[1:50:36] every name was included in there
[1:50:40] mine is in there is yours in there
[1:50:44] amen i know because there's a
[1:50:46] representation there's something that
[1:50:48] calls
[1:50:49] and says i'm part of that
[1:50:52] and to think to think i might not have a
[1:50:56] whole lot
[1:50:57] on this side but i have a soul that's
[1:50:59] worth ten
[1:51:00] thousand worlds and i thought about it
[1:51:05] as i was sitting this afternoon ten
[1:51:06] thousand worlds
[1:51:08] what is the value of ten thousand worlds
[1:51:14] i'm looking at see if anybody's mind is
[1:51:15] going full blast right now
[1:51:19] so i was sat there sitting at the desk
[1:51:21] this afternoon and i'm thinking
[1:51:24] oh brother mike yarbrough's not here
[1:51:25] can't ask him he probably would have
[1:51:27] some kind of an answer
[1:51:29] so i said i know i'll call brother lyle
[1:51:31] johnson
[1:51:33] i just i like how he thinks about things
[1:51:35] like this so i gave him a call
[1:51:37] he says i never thought about that but
[1:51:40] then he asked me he says
[1:51:42] brother aaron if if this is the only
[1:51:44] planet
[1:51:45] the only place that has this life in it
[1:51:49] then the whole creation is for this
[1:51:51] planet
[1:51:53] so how much is that worth
[1:51:56] wow i said you just you just made it a
[1:51:58] whole lot more brotherly
[1:51:59] and right about that i was telling
[1:52:01] someone just spoke to me and said call
[1:52:02] brother dale
[1:52:03] for the day all night so i gave him a
[1:52:05] call and he says
[1:52:06] yeah i think i did a study on that let
[1:52:08] me look it up
[1:52:10] so he goes yeah in 2008 brother green
[1:52:12] asked me that question and i still have
[1:52:13] the files right here
[1:52:16] and he began to tell me now to try to
[1:52:18] explain it
[1:52:19] i can't but he said this was in 2008.
[1:52:24] he said the value that we can actually
[1:52:27] account for
[1:52:29] that we can see based on monetary what's
[1:52:32] out there
[1:52:34] what they know is in the earth all the
[1:52:36] things that have value
[1:52:38] in 2008
[1:52:41] they came up he came up with a number
[1:52:43] based on what everything he found
[1:52:45] for america alone 14 trillion dollars
[1:52:51] he goes and america is about 65 so
[1:52:54] there's 35 percent more and that was in
[1:52:56] 2008
[1:52:57] he says but i can't tell you even began
[1:52:59] to look at the stuff we don't know about
[1:53:04] all the stuff that they don't even know
[1:53:05] is there he owns a cattle on a thousand
[1:53:07] hills
[1:53:08] every ounce of gold every ounce of
[1:53:10] silver every precious stone is his
[1:53:15] so he said he goes in my best guess he
[1:53:17] goes today just based on that he said
[1:53:20] i would say maybe 200 trillion dollars
[1:53:24] in what we know times ten thousand
[1:53:30] and you're worth that to him
[1:53:34] each one of you so he said father not
[1:53:38] my will but thy will be done so he could
[1:53:42] then
[1:53:42] redeem you back to himself
[1:53:46] oh what a savior
[1:53:50] how can you but love him and i thought
[1:53:52] brother branham said this
[1:53:54] how simple he says when you get to the
[1:53:58] other side he says
[1:54:00] and back on behind some hills back there
[1:54:02] he says in the shady trees
[1:54:04] you'll hear me singing or hearing
[1:54:06] somebody singing amazing grace how sweet
[1:54:08] the sound he said
[1:54:09] oh brother branham made it
[1:54:12] and i thought of all the things that you
[1:54:14] would say he would be singing amazing
[1:54:16] grace
[1:54:17] you would think he would be up front
[1:54:19] saying here i am no
[1:54:20] he realized it is the grace of god
[1:54:23] it is the mercy of the lord it's his
[1:54:26] love for us
[1:54:28] oh it's something and their hearts was
[1:54:31] crying out
