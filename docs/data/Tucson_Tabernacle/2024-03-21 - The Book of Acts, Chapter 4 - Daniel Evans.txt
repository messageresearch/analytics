three are gathered he'd be in our midst so and he keeps his word so Psalms 92 verses 1 and 2. it's a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord and to sing praises unto thy name almost High to show forth thy loving kindness in the morning and thy faithfulness every night what a wonderful God we serve amen I do have a couple of requests here to bring to your attention from our sister Roberta baggage she says it's a prayer request for her Aunt Alice Strunk she will be having triple bypass surgery Friday at 11 30 a.m up in in the Phoenix Phoenix let's remember her and sister Melia Gonzalez said she's just not been feeling well it's there's a lot of allergies and dust and colds and things going through and in this body you will suffer we still have a Divine healer and also remember my daughter Abby and Chloe and Asher they've been for the last week and a half or so kind of colds and Esther had an earache and they were doing better today but I don't know when you see an adult suffering you figure well they can handle but when you see a child suffering it's kind of hard you know it just seems to touch you but you know you he can be touched by the feeling of our infirmity so brother Lyle if he would come as we stand and just take these needs to the Lord and open in prayer this this evening amen [Music] if it's all right I'd like to read a couple of verses from another Psalm as well Psalm 96 says o sing unto the Lord a new song sing unto the Lord all the Earth sing unto the Lord bless his name show forth his salvation from day to day declare his glory among the Heathen his wonders among all people for the Lord is great and greatly to be praised he is to be feared above all gods let's just go to the Lord this evening father we're so thankful that we can come before you knowing that you hear our prayers Lord Lord we come through the blood of Jesus Christ Lord we claim no righteousness of our own but we claim the righteousness that you imputed unto us Lord

for youth ages 16 and up we'll do that at six o'clock on Saturday and uh contact uh contact me or my son Daniel for any information on that again that's also on the website both of these uh Gatherings are not exclusive to our church so invite anyone that you'd like to come please please make them welcome the book of Acts I am I have to say that I don't know how many times I've read this book in my life but more and more I see the application of this book in our lives and I see that these same spirits that lived 2 000 years ago and we're so prevalent in this book are so prevalent now it's just as plain as day it's it's just it's an amazing thing to me I see as we went through and put in Acts chapter 1 we saw that the author of this book this is his second essay the first essay was the Book of Luke and then this second essay this book of Acts was written to the same man this theopolis and written by the same author which is Luke Acts chapter one it defines the author it gives us a recap of the Resurrection story of our Lord Jesus and Jesus's instructions and it establishes Peter as the main spokesman at least for now as we see in the book of Acts Peter kind of Rises to to prominence there and he's he is the one that begins ministering then in Acts chapter 2 obviously probably the most famous at least one of the most famous chapters in the whole Bible we have the day of Pentecost and we see that as they have 120 in this upper room that we see that the sound of a rushing Mighty Wind comes into the room and then they look and they they look around and they see these pillars of Fire over each of the 120 that are in there and it's becomes as you look at it you can see the type of the Old Testament Temple and you can see this Old Testament Temple how it would be a powerful thing that would happen like like this sound of this rushing Mighty Wind and then the pillar of fire would would come down in the Tabernacle or in the temple and it looks to me like that Old Testament is a type of what happens here in the New Testament when no longer is this a temple made by hands but it becomes a living Temple where God can dwell and as he dwelled in the temple of old and we see in the book of Acts that this great thing happens this this day of Pentecost the Holy Spirit comes down and then people see and they want to be like that and they want to have that same holy spirit that these disciples had and they asked and Peter in such wisdom Peter instructs them on how that they can receive this Holy Spirit in Acts chapter 2 verse 38 he says repent number one repent of your sins shame start to change things and then be baptized Acts 2 38 in the name of the Lord Jesus for the remission of your sins in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive this same gift that we have and then as we go on as brother Lyle spoke about last week a very very important thing happened in in Acts chapter 3. first but the wild brought us through some of the history he brought us through this gate there was this gate there that we don't know much about where there is no gate called beautiful today but it was this this beautiful gate where the Lyle showed us a diagram up there of about where it was and there was a man that was 40 years old that had been crippled since his birth and everybody that was so special about this is so many people knew this man and he would be helped to the temple and laid there and he would have his hands out or a cup out or something and that's how this man made his living and people would come in this is probably a busy gate and they would see this man and they would give him money but they knew him and after this day of Pentecost we see Peter and John these two Disciples of Jesus they came to this man and that moment brother Lyle changed everything Peter looked down on him the Bible says he fastened his eyes he said look upon us and he said Silver and Gold Have I None the guy probably had his cup there but what I have I give to you rise up and walk and the Man In The Name Of The Lord Jesus rose up and he walked now this was very very important what happened right here because it showed that this Same Spirit that was on this man Jesus who they crucified was now on these people and they started doing the same thing that Jesus did now they they came and and then at the end of acts as brother Lyle pointed out and it's very important that we know this this Bible when it was written it wasn't written with chapters paragraphs it may have been paragraphs I don't know how they they separated their their statements back then but it wasn't written with chapters those came a long time after this Bible was put together and translated and the the authors or the translators or the the organizers of the Bible they came in and they put verses and chapters in there so it would be easier for us to understand imagine if you had a book that thick and you had to find something it would be pretty tough and it may be organized by books but there's 66 books in all of these pages so if you're looking for something man it'd be hard to find to be like well that's about like two-thirds of the way through I think and you'd be thumbing through the whole time but now we can look and say baptism Acts chapter 2 the book of Acts chapter 2 verse 38 and you can just look it up right here oh it's right here so that's that's how it was that's how it was originally written later on the we see these chapters put in so we see Peter preaching at the end of this Acts chapter 3. and Peter is is talking about is preaching about Jesus and he's explaining who this man is and he uh he he he doesn't finish his sermon at the end of Acts chapter three but he goes on to chapter four and let's start with verse 1 and brother Lyle um he read this when he was talking about Acts chapter 3 because it's the same sermon they they stopped it there because there was probably a pause or something it was a good place to stop it but this is the same sermon Acts chapter 4 verse 1. and as they spake unto the people the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees Came Upon them now there are these two sects of Chris of Judaism that are pretty famous in the Bible there's many different groups back then but there's two very very prominent ones and that is the Pharisees and the Sadducees they're very different people very different they have different beliefs the Pharisees they were like the local pastors they had the different synagogues around around Judea and around Israel and they would preach to the people and they were actually a little bit more of a more liberal group than the Sadducees were the Pharisees were they believed in angels they believed in an afterlife they believed in a resurrection they believed in in many many different things and so but when Jesus was here they were the main persecutors of Jesus because Jesus was going around in Galilee in all these different areas and he was encroaching onto the Pharisees territory so they were the ones that really hated Jesus in the beginning but then we come to these Sadducees and these guys were the pompous self-righteous very conservative Temple Jews these Sadducees they they worked in the temple and they didn't believe in anything really they didn't believe in angels they didn't believe in an afterlife they didn't believe in a resurrection they were all about the order of things they were the legalistic group of the day they were in closely with Rome and they worked closely with these Roman uh guards and and with the leaders of Rome and you can see that in the Bible you can see the high priest he's a sadducee see anus and ananias these are Sadducees and you see how they were the ones communicating with the Romans is because they knew where their bread got buttered they knew that they had to stay in close with these Romans so they could keep their power and keep their jobs so we see that before we see the Pharisees were a little bit more um persecuting Jesus and then we see the Sadducees now because Jesus his Fame is going abroad and it's it's more affecting the temple worship now and these Pharisees and Sadducees they didn't agree on many things as I just said they were very very different Divergent beliefs but one thing they did agree on is they hated this man Jesus and they both both those groups they agreed 100 together kill him he is not doing us any good he's tearing down everything that that we believe so there's there's these two different people and now you'll see as I go on into the book of Acts you're gonna see now why the Sadducees are stepping up and you're going to see why now they hate these new Christians because these new Christians have a new doctrine that the Sadducees absolutely do not believe in verse 2. and being grieved these are the Sadducees let me read verse one again I kind of put a little bit of space there between one and two and they spake unto the people the priests and the captains of the temple and the Sadducees Came Upon them so this is a Sadducees speaking being grieved that they taught the people and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead remember these Temple priests they don't believe in the resurrection so if Jesus raised from the dead it has to be false because our way of thinking what we've learned we don't believe in that Resurrection stuff so we know right now that these so-called Christians are far they weren't called Christians at this time but these people that follow Jesus are are false and they laid hands on them and they put them in hold until the next day for it was now even tied how be it many of them which heard the word believed and the number of the men was about five thousand look at how the church is growing now Jesus had instructed that the pre that the gospel would be preached first in Jerusalem and we see all of this is happening right now in this city of Jerusalem things are starting to go things are starting to stir and we see these these these men going out to preach and here in this Acts chapter 4 we see the first real persecution of the Christian church the church had just formed and all of a sudden we see a persecution come upon the church now most Scholars believe that that persecution ended about 300 years later that this man named Constantine came and and he stopped the killing of the Christians but I don't think that that persecution ended at that time because we see the Catholic Church step on the scene and kill literally tens of millions of people Through the Ages and that was a persecution on the true Christians by so-called Christians we see this persecution began and and then more civilization has happened and now we don't see that we have to stand before execution for our beliefs for our Christianity because it's just not done here in in the western world but our souls are much more important than our fleshly bodies and that is what stands on trial now is our souls and our souls I mean how many times have we heard that it's better to lose your life to lose a limb or what or or gouge on an eye than it is to lose your soul verse number four how be it this is beautiful verse number four is just an absolutely beautiful scripture how be it many of them which heard the word believed and the number of the men was about 5 000. and it came to pass on the morrow that their rulers and elders and scribes and Annas the high priest remember in caiaphases campuses that it's an elected position kind of like the pope is now and anus and caiaphasis they were one of them their term expired or whatever it was and they elected anus afterwards Anis was cathis's father-in-law um and Anna the high priest and caiaphases and John and Alexander And as many as were of the Kindred of the high priest were gathered together at Jerusalem and when they had set them in the midst they asked and I assume this is Peter and John they asked by what power about why what name have you done this on trial and they're asking brother why is that where you stopped or do you stop for the next one okay they were sincere well let me ask you these Sadducees these priests were they sincere in their question here is this man that was was crippled his whole life everybody knew him they'd walk by him every day coming into the temple and now this man's walking around and he's saying look at me the Lord has healed me and he's standing here now they they go to Peter and John and they say how did you do this do you think they were sincere do you think they sincerely wanted to know how I don't think so they were trying to poke holes in these men because they're preaching a resurrection the way I was raised the church that I went to we didn't teach a resurrection it can't be right but they were teaching this Resurrection they were teaching a doctrine that didn't make sense to these people it was a divisive spirit and I I talked about this on Sunday morning and I talked about putting new wine this new Lively wine that still is fermenting and putting it in an old wine skin and the wine skin that can't Flex that can't move and you put this new alive wine that needs to degas that needs to ferment and it just busts because this wine skin can't move and that's how these Pharisees and Sadducees Sadducees particularly were they could not move with it there was no room for any new wine in these people then Peter verse number eight after they had asked this question then Peter filled with the Holy Ghost said unto them ye rulers of the people and Elders of Israel if we this if this day we be examined of the good deed done to the impotent Man by what means he has made whole now when brother Lyle stopped he left us hanging thank you for doing that brother Lyle that laid a foundation for me I know what you were trying to do they brother Lyle left off and said how did you do this and but why by what power and by what name did you do it and then brother Lyle said and we'll leave off very very plain answer here and Peter is going to give this answer let me read verse 8 again then Peter filled with the Holy Ghost said unto them ye rulers of the people and Elders of Israel if we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent Man by what means he has made whole be it known unto you all and to all the people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth whom ye crucified whom God raised from the dead stick Mr sadducee I'd be sad too if I didn't believe in the resurrection these Sadducees whom you crucified whom God raised from the dead even by him does this man stand here before you whole that man that they healed at the gate called Beautiful they didn't heal him Jesus in the name of Jesus Christ he was healed and look at how these disciples these Apostles look at how they point to Christ we have these other people they were legalistic they had their ways and and they couldn't allow anything else sin this is the stone which was said it not of you Builders which has become the head of the corner Christ is that Cornerstone he's the foundation of the building of the Christian Church very very plain I'm gonna I want to switch very quickly to Matthew chapter 16 verse 15. now this is this is this goes back to a little while before and Jesus before he was crucified he is talking to his disciples and he asked them this question Matthew chapter 16 verse 15. Jesus says to them he says but who do you say that I am and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed are there Simon barjona for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and I say unto thee Thou Art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church in the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it now we know brother Branham has told us that that rock that Jesus was speaking of was not Peter and neither was it Jesus that rock that this entire church right now we're in the book of Acts and this entire church is built on is built on the revelation of who Jesus Christ is that is how the whole church is built and and Jesus says right here that on this rock I will build my church in the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it so that's how important it is that we are focusing on who this man Jesus Christ is even today two thousand years later if we try to build a church on anything other than the revelation of Jesus is the Christ the son of the Living God then our church will not prosper and that's how we see all these divisions that's how we see all these different groups we see all of this these different types of Christianity types of the so-called message all of this is because we lose focus of Christ and we start like the Pharisees and Sadducees we start concentrating on these doctrines that divide us and then our Lord just steps back because it's no longer about him it's about our own doctrines let's go back to the book of Acts verse 12. Peter says this let me go back to 11. this Stone which was said it not of you Builders which has become the head of the corner neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under Heaven given among men whereby we must be saved No Moses no Isaiah no prophet's name only Jesus everything friends everything pointed to this man Jesus I was I was teaching um you know what we started um we started that Ministry a few years ago in Jeffersonville my brother gave the testimony I've talked about it before this this gym that we started for boxers and for the Mixed Martial Arts Fighters back in in Jeffersonville and as we were getting going it was really starting to prosper one of of the um the people that was coming he asked the question he said he says I don't understand the difference between the New Testament and the Old Testament he says I've heard that we only have to believe the the New Testament because the old testament's a bunch of rules and and laws and stuff he says he says so what's the difference between the New Testament and the Old Testament and I said the Old Testament tells us what this man the Messiah is going to do it prophesies of this man the Messiah coming the whole thing is focused on one man and then the New Testament tells us what that man did and it tells us who he is and it shows us that he fulfilled what he was prophesied to do I said the the Old Testament is pointing to to Jesus the New Testament is pointing to Jesus the whole book is about one man and if any time you get away from that one man then you'll get off the whole meaning behind this book let me read that again neither is there salvation in any other for there's none other name given under Heaven given among men whereby we must be saved now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men they marveled and they took knowledge of them that they had been with Jesus now as I was praying about that even today I was wondering I was like Lord if these unbelievers now we have to look through their eyes if these unbelievers they understood they took knowledge it seemed like these men had been with Jesus so what does that mean what does it mean if if these men for you and me it'd be like oh they have the Holy Spirit but these other men these Sadducees are looking at I'm like yeah you can tell that they were with this guy and I was thinking was it because that their way of thinking was different than than mainstream message Believers or um Jewish believers and now they believed like this Jesus and and things were different and and they said okay well Jesus taught this now they teach this so we to acknowledge that they've been with Jesus remember this book of Acts it wasn't name this originally but it says in our Bibles it says the Acts of the Apostles that's not correct this is the acts of the holy spirit in the apostles this is the acts acts of Jesus Christ in the apostles this is what Jesus does through the apostles this book of Acts has really nothing to do when you read it has nothing to do with Peter and James and John and later on in Paul and all of these all they're doing is preaching Jesus and then doing Miracles and they say wait wait it's not us it's him so that question there I wonder if they were thinking that Jesus had an influence on them and they could see that they were with Jesus or number two that they had been with Jesus and now they had his spirit and they were acting like he used to act the book of Acts the acts of Jesus Christ in the apostles and beholding the man which was healed standing with them they could say nothing against it so this man that that had been healed at the gate called Beautiful they these these these Sadducees where they were questioning them and and and wondering what and and they knew that this man was healed look at their spirit look at the Spirit of these Sadducees they did not care what the truth was it's a sad it makes me this I was reading this and I was like oh I can't stand these guys you know I started like and that's probably wasn't the right Spirit to have but just just thinking about how they they didn't care what the truth was all they cared about was their doctrines and if it didn't match their doctrines they were just gonna start poking holes in it made it just made me sick reading this um verse number 15. but when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council they conferred among themselves saying what shall we do with these due to these men for indeed a notable Miracle hath been done by them is Manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem and we cannot deny it but that it spread no further among the people let us straightly stress threaten them and they and speak and they speak henceforth to no man in this name so let's threaten them that don't preach this anymore what this miracle had been done don't do that anymore this guy was healed he was crippled don't do it anymore no no no no no you can't do that are you crazy they all saw it this was a miracle that's how important brother the law this miracle was it showed that God was with them and then it also showed that God was not with these these priests these ministers and it is everywhere today that spirit and they called them and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus Don't Preach anything that doesn't agree with our Doctrine but Peter and John answered and said unto them I love this that's just so we're talking about boldness whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than God judge ye for we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard I love that boldness so when they had further threatened them they let them go finding nothing how they might punish them because of the people for all men glorified God for that which was done for the man was above 40 years old on whom this miracle of healing was showed and being let go they went to their own company and reported all that the chief priests and Elders had said unto them and when they heard that they lifted up their voice to God with one Accord and said Lord Thou Art God which has made Heaven and Earth and see and all that in them is who by the mouth of thy servant David has said why did the Heathen rage and the people imagine vain things so Peter you can sell you can see Peter here Peter's quoting a psalm he said he said this came from David he's quoting Psalm chapter psalm 2. verse 1. and Psalm 2 verse 1 says why did the Heathen rage and the people imagine a vain thing now Heathen in the Old Testament as I've said before he that doesn't necessarily mean what we think it means a heathen is anybody that's not Jewish in the Old Testament so it says why did the Heathen rage and the people imagine a vain thing so we have the Heathen and then guess who the people it represents anybody is listening to Jews right so we have the Heathen and then we have the Jews and they're both said right here so again Peter said who by the mouth of thy servant David has said why did the Heathen rage and the people imagine vain things quoting the psalm we see Peter was learned in the scripture you can tell that that he knew his Bible verse number 26. the kings of the earth stood up and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord and against his Christ here's the Fulfillment of that scripture and killing Christ as you'll see right here in the next verse for of a truth against thy holy Child Jesus whom thou Hast anointed both Herod and Pontius Pilate with the Gentiles and the people of Israel were gathered together against thy holy Child Jesus so Psalm 2 1 was fulfilled in the heathen remember the Heathen the Gentiles the Romans and the people in the Jews both of them working together to kill the Lord Jesus now notice one thing is very very important especially as I told the the young man the boxer when he asked what was the difference between the new and the Old Testament everything is about Jesus it's it's we can't we can't lose sight of Jesus and everything from Genesis to Revelation points to this man verse number 28 for to do whatsoever let me go I'm I keep breaking it up verse number 27 forever truth against thy holy Child Jesus whom now has anointed both Herod and Pontius Pilate with the Gentiles and the people of Israel were gathered together for to do whatsoever thy hand and thy Council determined before to be done and now Lord behold their threatenings and Grant unto thy servants that with all boldness they may speak Thy Word Peter's asking God here to give him courage in the face of their own torture and their own death which was coming as I said before we may not be risking that but sometimes I think that they had it easier than we have it I think that especially you young people and what you have to go through and what you have to see every day and and the world that you have to walk in even me a generation before you didn't see the things that that you see and didn't fight the things that you fight and it would be so much easier for us to just go to the guillotine like Paul did or go to the Cross like Peter did and suffer for a little while but now you can't just be killed for your beliefs you have to live in this world and you have to go through this world suffering and and people people trying to make you conform to this worldly way of living today before they might ask them to recant tell them to recant and face death today it's harder because you might get embarrassed you might you might risk being maybe not thought of as well in your circle of friends speaking he might speak a little different than the world speaks and when when you do this it's hard it's A Hard Road to walk but we have to be we have to be able to make that stand especially you young people you have to be willing to say Lord whatever it takes whatever you want I am willing to do it before we could walk we could just walk to the cross and suffer for a little while now we have to suffer our whole lives we have to we have to live in this world but by the grace of God as Isaiah said when the enemy comes in like a flood that God will raise up a standard against it he raises up this standard and gives us more joy than we could ever imagine because we know that we have the Lord Jesus there now listen to this this is how important a Supernatural is by stretching forth give us boldness as Peter said to speak Thy Word by stretching forth thy hand to heal and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy Child Jesus and we see that these Sadducees how they attacked the people and they attacked him because they didn't they didn't believe like they believed they didn't act like they acted they didn't look like they they looked and I see like I said as I'm reading this I'm seeing our young people and my mind as I read this this morning again my mind went back to this Asbury Revival a few months ago and and what happened there and that this college and these these young people coming and they're praying all night long and they're singing and they're testifying to each other and laughs I'm just gonna just say it so it got out because of I guess videos here that I was supporting that that I thought that I thought that was that's beautiful and I got contacted saying well you know they can't be right and I was like well he says well he says well look at them you know basically they don't look like us I responded how many of the young people in your church are praying all night long how many of them how many of them are worshiping the Lord like that and yet you want to throw them out because they don't look like you think that they should look and we understand that there is very plainly in this new testament there is a modesty and there is an important part of Christianity that is looking like a Christian acting like a Christian and talking like a Christian but never kick someone else out because they're not seeing it like you see it even when the spirit is coming down upon them like Peter and John here and these different ones oh because you believe in the resurrection you're out Peter says by stretching forth I had prove Lord by stretching forth thy hand to heal and that signs and the Wonder and wonders may be done in the name of thy holy Child Jesus and when they had prayed place was shaken where they were assembled together and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and they spake the word of God with boldness they asked the Lord for courage and he gave it to them so much so that the entire place that they were at shook with the power of God and the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one Soul how beautiful is that no wonder God was able to use use them neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own but they had all things things in common hour of unity one heart one soul willing to give up give up anything for their fellow believers anything if there was a need they were willing to give it how many of us how many of the people in this United States could say that I am willing Lord if there is a need I am willing to sell my property I am willing to give up whatever it takes to see this gospel go forward it's a foreign thing but it has to be and we don't need it you know right now we don't but who knows what's going to happen in the future but these people they did it and great power and with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus and great grace was upon them all notice again it was all about Jesus neither was there any among them that lacked for as many as were possessors of the lands or houses sold them and brought the prices of the things that were sold and laid them down at the apostles feet and distribution was made unto every man according to that to as he had need and I'll uh I'll finish here and Joseph who by the apostles was surname Barnabas which being interpreted the son of consolation a levite and of the city of Cyprus having land sold it and brought the money and laid it at the apostles feet I am and thus we have there the end of Acts chapter 4 and we can close if the musicians could come but but before that we see in this Acts chapter 4 we see the persecution of the Church begin we see this man that was healed was standing there we see that spirit in these Sadducees because it didn't look like what they thought it should look because it didn't act because it didn't fit their way of thinking they ignored what God was doing and they cast them out and threaten them don't do this anymore don't heal anybody anymore and then we see that there was such unity in these Apostles and this is what I want to leave everybody thinking about in this Acts chapter 4. that there was needs among the congregation and these people were willing to give everything Jesus said take up your cross and follow me if any man gave everything it was Jesus these people they were willing to sell their land they were willing to give their money because there was other Christians that needed it and it says that no man lacked there was no needs in the church anymore it seems strange to us it's like wow that seems that seems socialist but my point in saying is they were willing to do it I think about I think me and Lord I'm am I willing to do that if there was a need am I Christian as this word says am I someone in this Bible like this man Barnabas that that would give and I think that we all should examine ourselves would we be willing to give everything for the gospel ask yourself would I be willing everything give it all up like these people did because you know what that is what will bring I believe the resurrection and the coming of the Lord that is what will bring the holy spirit that we saw at the day of Pentecost was that attitude and when there is a need the Lord uses people to provide it and it makes me feel bad as I as I was reading this the past couple days I thought the God is so good he loves us so much that maybe he knows that it's hard for us to do it so he brings persecution upon us just like he brought persecution upon the people here we see in this chapter 4 we see the persecution start and we see God raise up a standard against it with these selfless wonderful people and says I'll give it all I believe in this man Jesus Christ I will give whatever it takes today we don't need the money today but what we do need is we need our time we need our attitude to be that I will give anything for this gospel I'll do it I'll give Lord whatever it takes to see my children filled with the Holy Spirit whatever it takes for me to be filled with the Holy Spirit whatever it takes for for anyone else that I can I can just get in like it was 5 000 people because they saw that willingness that attitude to give everything doesn't matter it wasn't important to them that's the place that we have to get and I I fear is prophesied in this book that there will come harder times because God loves us why couldn't we just do it now just an attitude just just the attitude Lord I'll do whatever it takes that is what happened in this Acts chapter 4. now brother Aaron if you come what happens also we see in Acts chapter 5 I'll give you a little like preview in Acts chapter 5 we see somebody that was willing to give most but wasn't willing to give everything and we see what happened to this man and his wife [Music] not willing willing to give a lot or most but not everything and we see the difference between a real believer and this person that couldn't quite Give It All and friends we need to give it all God bless you book of Acts chapter 4 is merely I think it's my favorite book my favorite chapter in the whole Bible everyone I'm reading I say that that oh this is my favorite this is this is just the best but it shows a genuine it shows a uh a dedication that we just don't see in today's society but we have to have God bless you all I pray that this book of Acts that you stay in it that you keep reading it because I know it's it's a it's a it's a map work it's it's something that we can look at and we can apply it to our own lives and compare ourselves to these people to this this Barnabas he was willing man I don't care I want I believe this man Jesus I'm going to take up my cross here is all I'm going to sell all my land here it is let's get this gospel out and that's why there was 5 000 Believers right there God bless you all [Music] [Applause] has brother Daniel was speaking there if anybody gave everything it was Jesus he gave his all he said in order he told them he says there's a better way than this than me just being with you but rather my spirit coming and living there but in order for that Spirit to come there has to be a death it has to be a death in ourselves to receive that Spirit but because he lives and there's a promise for us to [Music] live I can face [Music] all fear is gone because I know he holds a future and life is worth the living just because it is the first verse God said to them they called him Jesus he came to God hell and for eign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] Because He Lives I Can Face Tomorrow because [Music] I know he holds a future and life is worth just because it's worth a living because when this life is over you just step from this one to the other one and it's real the angel asked brother Brandon we said would you like to see the other side he said oh it would do me so much good and when he comes by in his presence is here it's a touch of that other side and it makes it worth it amen brother Dan Roberts to come and close in prayer [Music] I just remember that the same God that Peter said this Jesus he's still the same yesterday today and forever it's the same one we Preach Today too many people preached brother brown or this brother or that
