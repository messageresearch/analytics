until that day when were there real then we're gonna know what it's gonna be but I think his brother branham said after he came from that time beyond the curtain of timon and he said can't explain it but don't miss it that was the best so we have a couple of prayer requests to bring to your attention and then submit praises and a couple announcements that we heard through a sister that attends a Spanish Tabernacle with Isaac Noriega and Golden Dawn that sister Lucy is brother Isaac's wife has been in the hospital for several weeks she's had some serious heart problems and has been sick for some time and the word that was announced was they don't know that she's going to make it she is she's she's close to death so a lot of loved ones a lot of friends a lot of the family of folks that we've known for years and people children daughters sons brother Isaac and all them they would it would be a hard hard loss so we just keep them in prayer and also I have put on my notes to remember bread they had do going he he came today and got a chance to talk with him the surgery went well and that was just some recovery recovery from on the right wrist surgery so we'll keep him in prayer in it as we talked to the Lord you know the needs and you know what what's on your heart so as we talk to them don't talk to them as a god that you have to plead and beg to but one who's your friend when you could share so let's stand wherever we are maybe at home those are able to be here today and let's just talk to the Lord we come to you in that precious name the only name in which we can approach you we cannot approach you through our own name through our own merits the name of our pastor the name of our prophet no lore we approach you in the one name the name of the Lord Jesus Christ every demon trembles every knee shall bow to that precious name Lord and we come to you Lord you know the needs and our sister Lucy Lord sister Lucy Noriega Lord the report was she was in the hospital not doing well but Lord you're the great physician the doctor of doctors the heart specialist whatever the need is Lord you know what is their Lord in Lord may the faith of your children rise up and take hold of your promise and claim it not good to see brother head here Lord just asking you a complete restoration of health therefore his right wrist Lord and thank you for the surgery going well or to appreciate every heart every hand maybe in in their homes today wherever they might be with their hands raised Lord saying Lord remember me Lord in this hour we're looking to you Lord and we thank you for in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen you may be seated just a few things to bring to your attention let's see for the Matthew McFadden was the leading song service and today's his birthday so god bless brother Matthew and I know there's been quite a few birthdays this past week from different parts of the family we celebrated my daughter Abby's yesterday and I know the Carey celebrated quite a few birthdays in the last few days and but one of these days we'll be young forever so brother Graham said somewhere between 19 and 21 so that's kind of a memory for some of us now but it'll be it'll be wonderful so also we'd like to congratulate those that have graduated there have been some graduations recently and I know this year it's been different than normal where somewhere had to do virtual graduations all but to those who have graduated from whatever whatever schooling you graduated god bless you and and congratulations so appreciate that and then we know some of the churches have opened up started here in Arizona and other states also and some churches stayed open during the during this whole time and I had a pastor call me I'm one of a small church and he said what do you think I should do I said I can't tell you what to do you're the pastor I just told him this I said as the pastor if all goes well you'll get the credit and if all goes bad you'll get the blame so you have to deal with both sides of it so as those that chose to keep the their church is open god bless them those that chose to run it the way they did God bless them also so we we had a I guess you'd call a meeting through whatsapp a little bit yesterday with brother Matt and he did for those of you who have whatsapp you probably seen the announcement but those that you may have not heard I'll just read to you what brother Matt wrote here he says God bless you Saints I want to let you know that we will be making a church wider announcement on behalf of myself and the church officers concerning when and how we will be resuming regular gatherings at church in the very future we are aware that the state of Arizona is reopening but for tomorrow and next Wednesday we will continue the format we have been using with a minimal crew and live streaming phone hookup and then says please look for upcoming announcements now brother Matt is doing his best to be here next Sunday and at that point I'm not going to put words in his mouth and say we are going to be open we're not going to be open but Lord willing it'll be very soon and as we've talked to different folks and brother Matt said it's good to see some folks here today that that have we haven't seen and for those of you that are at home and wanted to be here the church is not full it's just a couple people okay don't don't feel too bad but we are looking forward to seeing all of you it is something we have missed something that is part of the family god I'd like to read something for you to you I was reading the message lean not to your understanding and brother Branham says this is on paragraph 45 and he's speaking of of those who had accepted the Lord and God did something wonderful to them but they chose by their own understanding to go a different way to join a different group or or somebody that had a bigger church and and he's not condemning them but this is what he said about you while you're the best class that there is sons and daughters of God well I like that company better than I would with all the kings and potentates and everything else give me that humble bunch of people if they don't know their right hand from their left as long as they know God and love him and serve Him that's the celebrity of heaven to me yes sir so you might you might say well I'm not a whole lot but in God's eyes you're part of part of the celebrity of heaven and I thought I would share that with you today and just say it'll be good to get together and to worship the Lord God

morning amen oh god bless you thank you by the Matthew for the song song leading there the worship amen and I trust that you are just looking amen to what the Lord has for us today there's a great expectation upon my heart and I just want to be yielded to the Holy Spirit and I believe he'll speak to you today no matter where you're at no matter your circumstance or whatever surrounds you I believe that the Lord Jesus has something amen in his word today that is our stability that is our hope amen we are not without hope we have hope today amen and so let's look at our at the word today and then if you have your Bible we'll turn to the Book of Ruth and I would like to just have you turn there to Ruth chapter 1 and we'll just start at the very first verse I'd like to continue on from where we were two Sundays ago on the unstoppable purpose of God I'd like to preach a part two of that today and we're going to see more of this unstoppable purpose we're gonna look at the purpose of God in the life of a Moabite woman and her mother-in-law now I don't have time today and just in one service to cover all that's in this book and all of the details and all of the story you can go home and read it for yourself and it's just a wonderful book that I believe the Lord has so many different things we could say about it but we just want to key in on just a few portions of the story of Ruth we're gonna start with the situation that starts with Naomi a mother-in-law and a limo lek leaving the land of Bethlehem Judea so we're preaching today on the unstoppable purpose part - and brother Jordan has a PowerPoint for the Jeremy there if it displays good that would be wonderful we have a few quick take quotations we would like to read and then we're looking forward to the day we could meet together and and everyone would meet not just in their homes we've appreciated this time and I'm glad we have stability in the midst of an unstable word a world we have a stable word Amen it's our security it's our anchor and it holds and I'm grateful for that but we're looking forward to the time when we could be together again Lord willin that will be next weekend I'll be there in person and not just in a virtual studio and so if the Lord would lead that's what we're gonna be there this coming weekend and more announcements to come on on what type of gathering we'll have so just look for that as we announced last night in the coming days but for now we just believe that this is the Lord's Day amen it's Sunday and the Sun is risen and we we have the proof of that we have the fruits of that in our own life amen and the the risen Savior has changed everything about us and we're grateful for that we'd like to look here today in Ruth chapter 1 and if you just want to begin reading here we'll begin reading just at the first verse Ruth chapter 1 verse 1 it says now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled that there was a famine in the land and a certain man of Bethlehem Judah went to sojourn in the country of Moab he and his wife his sons in the name of the men of the man was a limo lek in the name of his wife Naomi and the name of his two sons may Alon and chilly on verse 3 and Elimelech Naomi's husband died and she was left and her two sons and they took them wives of the women of Moab the name of the one was Orpah and the name of the other Ruth and they dwelled there about 10 years and may Ilan and chilly undyed also both of them left of her two sons and her husband then she arose with her daughters-in-law that she might return from the country of Moab for she had heard in the country of Moab how the Lord had visited his people and giving them bread wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was and her two daughters-in-law and they went on the way to return into the land of juda verse eight and Naomi said unto her two daughters-in-law go return each to her mother's house and the Lord deal kindly with you as you have dealt with the dead and with me Lord grant you that you may find rest each of you in the house of her husband then she kissed them and they lifted up their voice and wept what sorrow what a confusion it was almost impossible to find the purpose of God in this story but let's look a little further verse 10 and they said unto her Cheryl surely we will return with the unto thy people and Naomi said turn again my daughters why will you go with me are there yet any more sons in my womb that they may be your husband's turn again my daughters go your way for I am too old to have a husband if I should say I have hope if I should have a husband also tonight and should also bear sons would you tarry for them till they were grown would you stay for them from having husbands name my daughters for agree with me much for your sakes at the hand of the Lord is going out against me they lifted up their voice and wept again a Norbit kissed her mother-in-law but Ruth clave unto her very big difference there and she said behold thy sister-in-law was going back unto her people and unto her God's return thou after thy sister-in-law and Ruth said treat me not to leave thee or to return from following after thee for whether thou goest I will go and where thou lodgest I will Lodge thy people shall be my people and my god and thy God my God where they'll Dyess will I die and there will I be buried the Lord do so to me and more also if all but death part thee and me when she saw that she was steadfastly minded to go with her then she left speaking unto her so they too went unto so they too went until they came to Beth ham and it came to pass when they were come to Bethlehem that all the city was moved about them and they said is this Naomi and she said unto them call me not notice this here here's her spirit this is a barometer this is a woman who's lost her husband lost her sons and she comes and they said is this Naomi and she said to them call me not Naomi call me Mara for the almighty hath dealt very bitterly that word Mara even the name she gives means bitterness the Lord hath dealt very bitterly with me I went out notice this I went out full and the Lord hath brought me home again empty why then call you mémé Naomi seeing the Lord had testified against me and the almighty hath afflicted me so Naomi returned and ruth the moabite us our daughter-in-law with her which returned out of the country of Moab and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest let's just pray by your heads here with me there at the tabernacle and there at home Lord Jesus father we look to your word today God for truly it's our answer it is a refuge Lord it is our hope Lord it's upon where we put our feet where we place our home where we build our family where we plan our life where we put it all of our trust Lord it's in your word God it is our all in all Lord we look to it today God we pray father you would come by your spirit your word Lord it's already anointed but God may as I raise my hands Lord and those at home those in the church raise their hands may you anoint your people now Lord not just to hear the word not just to speak the word but father - to come into communion and fellowship and worship with you right now believing Lord that you're in control of all things we ask it in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen you can be seated seated by the Jordan let me know if there's an audio delay at all I can fix that on my end amen we would like to look here at this story of God's unstoppable purpose as we said there's so many things in the life of Ruth and her story is going to we know have a great heart in the redemption story but we just want to zoom in here just for a moment as we continue God's unstoppable purpose and I'd like to this take some lessons because I believe there's so many that that we could learn from this story of Ruth starts out so confusing such tragedy even the very words that it starts out with drew snapped er one starts by telling us there was a famine in the land I believe it's represented above the day and age that you and I live in that there are there's a famine a great spiritual famine in the land churches don't know where to turn denominations don't have answers great preachers with great auditoriums filled with thousands of people there's a spiritual famine for the real hungry souls who are really looking for Christ and I believe this was the time that Ruth was living in and the buyer Naomi the Bible says that there was a great famine in the land and the land that it's speaking of is Bethlehem Judea this was the promised land that were fill meaning house of God and then the word Bethlehem Judea means the house of bread the house of blessing the house of love of resource this is what it means they left the land of blessing we know it was Bethlehem Judea and Judah means praise so they leave the land of blessing they leave the land of praise and they go to Moab ulema lek being the father the leader the husband he makes a choice under pressure no doubt there was great pressure because there was a great famine in the land but how did the famine come this famine in Bethlehem Judea was not the cruelty of God it was not the punishment of it was not the cruelty of God just being cruel or just bad chance but but the story that we find in Israel is that they had been so backslidden that they had turned from God for so many years and God had sent him prophet after prophet trying to woo them back to himself but we know that they they were they were sinful they were lustful they were idolatrous and so God before he takes them out of the land he starts to send them different curses and those curses would start with sickness then it would go to and their animals and their animals would die and plagues would come and they would lose their harvest and their harvest would fail and scorching Sun would come and God would stop the rain and the supply of water and but you said brother Matt why is that important because it's important so important to understand that ulema lek could interpret this any way he wanted as you and I no matter what trial we find ourselves in no matter what difficulty comes our way no matter what problem or circumstance we face we can sometimes if we're not careful we can start to interpret the voice of that trial as some cruelty or just some bad luck but my brother my sister this was God trying to get the attention of his family unfortunately a little light translates it and interprets it wrong and under pressure no doubt pressure they were under immense pressure uh there was a great famine in Bethlehem Judea I couldn't imagine what it would be like to live there and and to live under such hard times and such shortage of food and even their two children melon and chili on these boys were not born in Moab they weren't Moabites they were Israelites they were born in Bethlehem Judea but just as an indication about how bad the famine was look at the meaning of their name when Naomi and a lemon lack names these sons they named the mail on which means sick or dying and then chili on which means pining or wasting away this tells you an indication of how bad the famine was that was so bad that they were wasting away but you say by the man that should have give them license to leave let me tell you something brother no matter how you naturally feel no matter how bad your natural life shifts or turns out to be it is the right choice to leave the land of promise no matter what your emotion tells you no matter what your what your mind is telling you those are all lyin vanities God may be bringing famine in your life too maybe that trials there for a purpose to try to bring something greater from your life that God knows he can bring you to it is not the time when it's up when there's when there's a feeling of drought or famine or coldness is not the time to leave Bethlehem Judah and go to Moab but a little knack unfortunately the Bible says leaves this land of Bethlehem Judah and he leaves it's going to soldier in the land of Moab Moab you say what is Moab Moab is going to represent it's a place of idolatry this was not this was an anti-jewish nation they hated the Jews this wasn't a people for God this was representative of the lustful sinful world Moab where Moab was even who was Moab we know in the Bible the Moab was the ancestral of productt he was up he was he was from the incestual affair between lot and one of his daughters and brother Adam said what did Moab represent it represents the flesh it represents our sinful nature it represents lust it represents the congregation of the wicked David would seat of the scornful this was this was the this was the land of the wicked but because of pressure because of circumstance a limit like makes a choice now he had no intention of turning his back on God he why I'm not you know we got to be careful how we how we paint a limo like here he wasn't a sinner he wasn't just looking for lustful things he was in a famine and he was looking for answers and my brother my sister if we're not careful sometimes and difficulties we start to push panic buttons we started and maybe we don't do anything naturally anything substitute Lee but even in our own spirit and own mind we begin unsettled we get unnerved we start looking to different things and starting to look into temporary satisfactions and this was the case of a Lim Allah he was under pressure and so he decides he's gonna leave the land of Bethlehem Judea and because of that pressure he's going to go into Moab just to sow the Bible says he's just gonna soldier him which means temporary is he I'm just gonna go there just for a little while I'm gonna check out of my current problem the grass is greener on the other side of the fence and so I'm gonna go to the to the land of Moab I'm gonna take my wife I'm gonna take my children my boys you know he never intended the consequences that would follow but he makes a choice to leave and he goes into a land called Moab that even the very name the definition of Moab means fornication think about that just for a moment here he goes into Moab and and this was this Moab was the same one who seduced Israel and and they lose in the wind and him in the wilderness and they lose 24,000 people from a plague live alike knew this history he knew he had no association he knew he should have never yoked himself up he knew it he knew he should have never lived there he should have never dwelled there he shouldn't have even a visited there brother we don't visit sinful places we don't even we don't even do it for a temporary stay we don't have a temporary sin in our life be and just check out from from our life of holy living just to dabble in sin just a little bit you know you play with fire you're gonna get burned and I'm preaching this for somebody here today you play with fire and play with the wrong things that there's eventually there's consequences to every seed you sow whether it's a seed of God that you sow and you reap a good hardness or you sow a seed of discrepancy you'll reap what you sow the jeremiah says you sow to the wind and now you reap the whirlwind and boy did eliminate Elimelech reap the whirlwind god forbade them to marry Moabites why say for the men why because the Bible says what fellowship does light have with darkness what what fellowship you go into a relationship I don't care if it's a business relationship to where you turn it turns into a friendship and then there's a social gather and then there's the social set in the social East my brother my sister were to be separate to be separated for God set for His purposes what fellowship does light have with darkness the Bible says get bad company corrupts good character it'll always happen no matter how innocent it seems you're to be suffered we're in the world but not of the word you say brother Matt does that mean we don't have business dealings with unbelievers no that's not what I'm saying here today but you don't enter into a relationship into some place to where it becomes a that person has control or influence over you you just go read what brother Branham said about that making a league with an unbeliever now listen god forbade them to marry MOBOT women see says in and you can read it in the book of first Kings God says he says you yeah I'm gonna forbid you to marry them and you said with Matt why God gives them the purpose he says for surely they will turn away your hearts after their gods and this is exactly what we do oh we that we fellowship with the wrong things now just stay with me here's we're getting somewhere here today it begins to turn and I'm afraid today whenever there's a famine God's people can turn to the world themselves to seducing spirits and idolatry and mixing what's holy and what's unholy and what's godly and what's ungodly oh but but but today let me tell you don't leave your place of blessing I don't care how bad your circumstances are I don't care how bad the situation is don't leave Bethlehem Judea no matter what you face today stay in your land of promise even if you don't feel anointed if you feel cold if you feel distant if you feel disconnected if you feel I don't care if you felt like a failure I don't care if you no matter what emotion you feel today stay in the promised land for there's no life outside of it as Naomi learned she loses her husband she loses her son's young men men who she loved oh what a lesson here we find from this story but it was no accident that this happens to sister Naomi even though she doesn't realize it it was a terrible decision for a limit like to make but God was in control God had a purpose in everything he takes his family out of God's promised land and the house of bread and he takes them into this land of Moab under pressure he makes this decision and and and but but you know what my brother and my sister that famine was the tender loving hand of Jehovah I came back to this just here for a moment because I don't I want to make sure don't miss it don't ever interpret your trial don't ever interpret your hardship don't let the dead we'll reinterpret that situation I don't care how dark and how purposeless your life seems don't ever let the devil lie to you and tell you it's anything outside of the tender loving hand of Jehovah who sees the end from the beginning and you don't and I don't and we don't understand everything we'll get to that more here just in a moment but now everyone's running to Moab and everyone's hungry there in famine he leaves there a limit like leaves this house of bread as we said and he makes a conscious decision I'm just gonna go and dwell just temporarily but what he doesn't realize is that in fact what he's doing is he's abandoning his blessing as the Bible says in Isaiah you forsaken your own mercy you're forsaking your own mercy he abandons the land of Moab at the land of Bethlehem Judea he leaves the blend of blessing the land of praise for a land of idolatry and sinful lust notice this here and and and you look at this here notice his heart as you consider this passage you can see the situation little X in we find in verse 1 that it says that he planned to sojourn that means a temporary dwelling it's a temporary state it's a temporary existence oh I'm just gonna go there I'm just going to jitters be temporary you're not trusting God you're trusting the arm of flesh it'll always lead you down the wrong road it's gonna be temporary I'm just gonna go there for a while I plan on going back to Bethlehem I don't plan on living there forever you know many people today you could find yourself in that same exact spot as he was in with a genuine desire to serve the Living God to live wholly for the Lord you really don't ever plan up get you don't ever plan on getting caught and getting addicted you don't ever plan on the situation going from bad to worst you don't ever plan on the little things becoming big things you never plan on that you never plan on getting lured in and stuck we never play that you know mid me that wonder even start to wonder from the Lord and and their own spirit and their own heart they begin to wander from the things of God they wonder away from the Fellowship of the Saints they wonder away from his word they wonder away from the voice of the Prophet they wonder and they wonder into all kinds of different temporary pleasure and some of those things are not necessarily sinful hear me sometimes those things aren't necessarily simple I know I could talk about being back slidden the Bible says even when doing when Jesus is speaking he says he says be sober I'd be ready to stand before the Son of Man don't be caught up in the cares of this life not the sins of this life the cares of this world even Jesus and the parable says that word becoming unfruitful the cares of this life choking the word sometimes it's not the sinful things that chokes the word out of our life sometimes it's just life and we get so stuck in the habits of life and we forget we're pilgrims or strangers many wonder they begin to wonder in their spirit but they don't have an intention desire to abandon the Lord all together you know this is a dangerous spot to be and I know I don't really plan on leaving forever I'm just you know just I just need a little bit of temporary peace a little bit of temporary satisfaction so I'm going to make this decision I know it's gonna take me out of the house of God you know and Wednesdays we're taking out of the house of God here I'm just gonna make this little choice and you know I'll come back it won't be that big of a deal Oh al Emelec did you really count the costs when you made that choice you know Satan will never show you the end result my father is famous for saying you know they'll show you the picture of the marble oh man with his cowboy hat handsome and young and full of life and his his blue jeans and he's got that Marv blow cigarette and all he looks just so like he's got everything what the devil will he'll show you that he'll never show you that man in a hospital bed gasping for his life with cancer I'll never show you the destruction of what that sin brings in your life it'll never show you broken home he'll never show you the broken marriage he'll never show you the the broken children he'll never show you the results of the consequences he only shows you the grass is greener on the other side of the fence your situations bad here what do you have to lose I never show you it'll only show you those things that appeal to your flesh now I'm afraid many are fallen to have fallen away not even serving the Lord today they didn't say they did but let me tell you this they're not in church today but they didn't set out to abandon the law they just set out to going to Moab for a little while then years later years later years and years and years of waste goes by they came into the country of Moab and the Bible says here's what it says in verse 2 and they came in the land of Moab and continued there here we find a totally different arrangement what started out to be temporary what became a desire to sojourn and developed into a dwelling place into a home in the land of Moab rather than a temporary place they now settle down and they get comfortable and as time went on you know that the thought of Bethlehem Judea you know and all that all the famine the time of all that it was so hard back there that's what they thought it was so hard back there now Moab they got food they got they got they got everything but they're really losing about to lose everything and that memory of Bethlehem Judea begins to fade from their minds begins just to settle down that voice begins to slow and and I hope you're getting the picture here today you can't just dabble in sin and expect that to please the flesh just for a season and then leave whenever you choose I'll just go out of it no my brother my sister the Bible says you take fire into your bosom you're permanently imprinted with it that's why jeez that's why the scripture says in the New Testament don't you know that he lays with that he that lays with the harlot is one there one day that did they take an imprint of in in themselves you take an imprint and sin and it can stay with you for the rest of your life Oh what begins as a temporary arrangement turns into an extended stay you know the statement all too well sin will take you farther than you ever wish to go it'll keep you longer than you ever intended to stay and it'll cost you more than you were willing to pay living in sin is never without consequence as we said there you notice these verses it's evident that Naomi has a repentant heart and and she realized that Moab had brought her nothing but defeat despair death she wants to return to Bethlehem and she begins to seek for restoration you know the story of her life as it goes oh it just begins to slip off into such chaos as we know that now the father dies a limb alike dies loses her husband she she loses she loses her her her sons and now she's joined to these daughter-in-laws who you know she she didn't know before but now now notice this here just here for a moment as a despite not place you noticed the story if you just back out of that here for a moment you said where the man is that what the book of rau don't know it's about so much more he said by the mount was the purpose of God how can you preach the gods as having purpose because God had a purpose in every single bit of that God had a purpose he was wanting to bring out of all of that death and all of that sorrow the story of Ruth you say brother Matt it means so little listen to what the Prophet says here I want you to listen close listen know what brother Branham says brother Jordan if you want to display that first slide he says this book of Ruth was one of the outstanding books that they accepted why it's just a love story oh why would the writers an ancient sage accept this book he says there's a there's a hidden revelation in it and in this hidden revelation you catch the real meaning it'll bring you real close to God and I pray my whole soul this morning that God will catch every heart so spellbound till he reveals himself just as what do you just what he is in the story what is to you how to accept him and once listen and when you once see it it's so simple you wonder how you ever went over the top of it but it can only be revealed by the Holy Spirit we know it's going to speak of this lukewarmness even even greater than that it's going to speak of this clear-cut decision that Ruth as they as they die and they they they they they the husband passes away the boys passes away and now you come to this spot in this story where naomi is so bitter and she's so empty and and and she just says oh I just I can't make sense of everything but just leave me go back and and you have nothing I have nothing to give you oh and and the Bible says that Orpah just kissed the face of the message some of the Matins you mean to say that I meant to say that she kissed the face of the message and she kissed it goodbye but there was something different in Ruth notice this story as we go just a little bit further here today Ruth you know Ruth being a pagan girl Moe - Marie's you know and then here's Naomi and and and here just ears boys we have all the characters in the story but now you come to this spot in the story where where where you find this and I just want to turn to it here today you find this so listen what brother Branham says here and that brother Jordan's you could display that next quote says Arba a type of the lukewarm church that once started a type of the church that won't go all the way she said that sounds pretty good so she kissed her mother-in-law and returned back again that's a type of the lukewarm believer who will believe Jesus to be the Christ and then turn around and go back to the things she'd come out of to the men that will take the way with the Lord's despise fuse and then turn around and go back like a dog to its vomit and a halt to its wallow as the Bible says now she returned back to her gods many times we return back to the gods of our beginning what a statement maybe we'd go I got eyes of lust the wrong thing will turn back to lustin again maybe we got idols of drinking idols of smoking idols of lying idols of stealing all kinds of idols and then profess and be baptized and then turn again what a sad thing you remember this now listen here you remember it never spoke her name no more she was excommunicated because of her decision it never spoke of her name no more she's excommunicated because of her decision imagine this here just for a moment as we look a little bit further oh he and brother brother Branham says hold can't hold the Bible next slide but because of popularity listen to this because of popularity will kiss the church kiss the message kiss Christ goodbye go back to where he was hollowed out of oppa lukewarm excommunicated you know that's exactly what Jesus said he said when persecution arises for the words sake immediately they are offended when he's speaking of that wayside ground I think it is said some seed falls on stony someone thorny someone wayside and he says that those that fall I think is on the wayside granny says those that hear the word anon with joy receiveth that he says but when persecution arises because the word because for the words sake they're offended you say brother Matt what is all these things that's been happening lately do you know what it's been doing it's been shaking the tree it's been shaking the church and let me tell you my brother no matter how you interpret it today it's been the tender loving hand of Jehovah no matter what's happening on the message no matter what's happening in the world today it's been the tender loving hand of Jehovah shaking to make believers away but securing the truth given Sherman's to the truth of today the elected bride of Jesus Christ brother Branham says kiss Christ goodbye lukewarm excommunicated think of this story here you could bring out so many types and here's Ruth who sticks to God sticks to sticks to the Word of God says I'll go where you go out or your people might be my people oh and and then and then she she comes to that place and she's gleaning the field of Boaz in that God seems to notice all these stories all the types of them and said of him in a hidden revelation even and then this book you know we with the it's a story with so many lessons and so many types of it that we can learn but we see the purpose of God the unstoppable purpose from chapter went all the way through the entire book it wasn't going to stop with the story to limit lack and his death it wasn't gonna stop mail on and chillin on it wasn't going to stop with Orpha I want believing Naomi but it was gonna be a story of Ruth of someone who should have never been found in the pages of the Bible but because she made the right choice and the right decision she falls in line with the purpose of God and she goes on to a line of redemption glory you know we've preached on that here before judges and Ruth we showed how that the book of judges and Ruth the Jewish Bible have bound is one book they're not two separated books because judges was going to be all of our circles and cycles and patterns but judges ends just three miles from Bethlehem Judea where the story of Ruth takes place judges the book of Judges ends and now you have judges who are circles and now Ruth is going to be not a circle it's gonna be a line a line of redemption it's a story about a mole by this woman a worldly girl who never had a chance who should have never been found written that in the in the end of in the Bible today but now we're preaching about her today because she made the right choice oh it's a romance but the random says whose type in the romance between Christ and his bride you can see it in so many facets and lessons and great lessons it shows the kindness of a man like Boaz as the kindness the hard kind-hearted of Jesus Christ that take upon himself unworthy Moabite woman named Ruth and not just take her but take everything that belong to her he didn't dis take her my brother my sister I want you to catch this here today because it's a type of your kinsman redeemer he didn't just purchase you he took all your baggage he took all of your tile he took all of your past he took it all unto himself and he says Ruth I'll take you and I'll take everything that comes with you I know what I'm getting when I buy it I know I'm buying I'm purchasing not just you as an individual but everything connected to you I'm redeeming because I'm your kinsman redeemer it was literally the story of redemption being played out in the life of a little Moabite woman brother Brandon would use this story to preach the message the kinsman redeemer go listen to it if you haven't listened to it recently and he took this out of Naomi being a type of that wore that oxygen church ruth being a type of that Gentile bride and how this woman ruth or the rhythm says should have never been in the story we should even read about her she should have this died like all the other girls heathens in in MO and in the land of Moab but somehow God leads a man a limo like God I limit like makes a choice you said by the night was that the leadership of God brother and it says even the permissive will of God God will turn it around and make it bring glory out of it look what he does here he takes this decision of a limit like a brother and sis a woman who should have never been mentioned in the Bible he says he says you should have never found and found in the story and the pages of what we read but now her name is forever imprinted on the story of redemption but you didn't think that sister Naomi when you were dealing with your bitterness and you were dealing with the hardness of that situation you had no idea that it was going to redeem you oh so much of this story of Ruth this Moabite a stranger from the promises of God but some how in her life God came and made a decision I'm gonna rewrite her life I'm gonna interrupt the story I'm gonna and erupted the program I'm gonna interrupt the program the satan had for I'm gonna implant myself I'm gonna interject myself and rewrite Ruth's entire story of her life and she finds herself with a mother Lorna and Naomi and in here married to her son son dies we see death you know all of these types and shadows you could look at the type of the death of the husband being a type of Israel and that the the brother branham picks this up and says being a widow she's left a widow like Israel is left widowed away from Jehovah because they had left him and I want how that she has two sons and just like whose sons are gonna be split two kingdoms and Judah and Benjamin and how that death would happen in Canaan it was all typed here right here in the story of Ruth we find that Ruth how that Ruth was a nobody as we said she was nobody but she finds herself gleaning in the right field somehow fast forward her story was started with such bitterness was such a bad stones or self-cleaning and the right field she made the right choice to stay with the word and she finds herself gleaning in the field of Boaz and the Bible says that Boaz looks upon her and little corner in a little field somewhere Boaz pays attention and he pays special interest she finds favor this little nobody and the Bible says she finds favor and the sight of Boaz old sister Ruth let me tell you something you didn't have a chance in your lineage you didn't have a chance in your inheritance your family was know was was Moabites they were heathens they were just gonna die they were living under a curse all of your blood and let me just say this to you today if Ruth's blood had prevailed Ruth would have never been found in the pages of this Bible but it was going to not be Ruth's blood it was going to be God's blood who was going to prevail it wasn't going to be Ruth's bloodline and Ruth's lineage it was going to prevail but she would find herself in the lineage Redemption because an unstoppable purpose of God an unstoppable plan an unstoppable determination decided to redeem an unworthy Moabite all my brother my sister you are only here today under the preaching of the revealed Word of the hour because God changed your story god interjected and interrupted your life and decided to redeem you when you were on redeemable we ought to give him thanks and giving praise for that it's only by Sovereign Grace we find this unstoppable purpose this is stoppable plan oh this unstoppable God Oh what we spoken last asunder the unstoppable two Sundays ago though for Ruth listen there Ruth you can see the unstoppable purpose of God that God had a plan for Ruth's life long before the devil had planned to destroy and leave her in ruin he thought he had planned her life to die as a Moabite serving Moloch that's the god of the Moabites but God who is rich in mercy who had an unstoppable purpose oh my brother my sister we can just preach to you right there the Bible says but God who was rich in mercy oh I don't care what you want to put behind there today you could say I was living in sin but God who is rich in mercy I was on a barstool but God who is rich in mercy I was groveling in despair but God who is rich in mercy I was a million miles away but God who is rich in mercy decided to save me and redeem me it's an unstoppable purpose that was being written in the life of this woman Ruth in you know what you see is an overall theme when you read the entire story of the Book of Ruth here's what you see there's a theme that comes out of every chapter God is in control God is in control let that settle your heart today I don't care what what situation here and today no matter what the home that you're in that chair you're sitting in there in the church today watch it online and streaming just let the would let the Word of God be a security to you no matter what you face here's what I'm gonna say to you God is in control he is controlling everything he's not just the creator of the universe he's the dictator he's the controller he's the architect he's the designer of time of stories no matter who it is no matter what it is God is in control and he's sovereign in every situation he's sovereign in every situation the Bible says in this way that he worketh everything after the counsel of his own will that mean means God doesn't need to advise with anybody doesn't need advisors yeah he does he doesn't need to counsel with anybody God is not influenced by anyone his choices are not based on the influence of something that happened and at least a brother Matt wasn't important because that means you're gonna see your bad mess ups and mistakes and failures doesn't influence his opinion and his purpose of what he's gonna bring in your life nothing changes this God he's unstoppable he's unshakable he's unrelenting he has an unstoppable purpose hallelujah oh he's not required to give an explanation to anyone for the choices he what do we realize this is the God that we're serving here today he doesn't know an explanation anyone not me not you not the president not anybody he doesn't know an explanation to anybody he doesn't need to give her a reason you know he doesn't rely on the wisdom of anyone he doesn't have a counsel that he goes to in the time of crisis why because he never has a crisis everything is orchestrated I didn't the studies we've been during the book of Daniel hope you've called that theme that God is orchestrating everything it's all one big drama and you're part of it and I'm part of it and I say today Lord let me play my part let me play it well bring forth the sweet fragrance of your purpose out of my life and everything that I do oh let me just say this to you here today my brother my sister the ants were preaching on the in stoppable purpose of God let me just say this here sometimes we won't spend our entire life trying to figure out the purpose of God what is God's purpose for me for that for this that happened for this over here let me just let me just let me just break the ice here you will never fully understand the purpose of God in this life I won't you won't designed it that way they designed it that way because faith is it's not things hoped for the evidence of things not seen are things that we don't understand we won't ever understand all the purposes of God I can say this he doesn't have to explain his purpose to me he doesn't even have to reveal his purpose to me let me let me go further you can't dissect the purpose of God it's not made that way you can't deduct the purpose of God by looking at certain things and rationalizing certain things people have tried to do this for ages let me just say if you try to this son dissect everything that's happened as a son of God or a daughter of God you try to deduct everything you'll lose your mind going crazy you can't understand it all why does God allow what has got a lot of us we try to figure it all out we have to come to this resolution and I hope you can lift your hand and say this today by faith I can't figure out everything that's going to happen I can't figure out everything that's happened in my past or what's happened in my present I can't have know God's purpose for everything but I will rest in this confidence I will rest in this revelation that he is sovereign over everything in my life he is perfect in all of his decisions and he doesn't make mistakes I said he doesn't make mistakes there are no accidents there's no mess-ups there's no reduce God doesn't make mistakes let that resound in your soul today he never makes I don't care what the devil has ever lied to you about no matter what ever happened to you or didn't happen in your life no matter what dream was unfulfilled no matter what purpose and you're trying to find them trying to figure it out just know this God makes no mistakes your life is not a mistake nothing's happened to you today that's not been by His perfect order the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord it's why brother Aaron says God deals with Israel as a nation but it gives with the Gentile brightest individuals meaning he deals with you on an individual basis and this great planner this great schemer the same one who wrote the life of Naomi and Ruth this great architect this great engineer has written a blueprint for your life he's written a blueprint and there's no revisions you no blueprint work when I have to study blueprint had studying blueprints for jobs and projects man you have to go through every detail every note then you'd have to be updated on on a software that they used so that you could get all the revisions and architect all we made a mistake over here engineer made a mistake over here we got a fixers got a rabbi this let me just give you the simple plain truth today there's no revisions needed from your life there's no revisions needed from anything that's happened it is perfect his plans that he's made for me David said are perfect hallelujah nothing happens by chance I know that's hard to get your mind around today some of us it's harder for others because some of us have went through some really tough things some of us are going through some tough things some of us are facing difficulties and we can only say a man by faith because there's a seed gene of God down inside of us because you could never muster out an amen going through some of these things some of the hardships that you went through some of the difficulties in your past some of the wreckage and carnage you look at in your past make sense of it it's hard mentally to just accept that you've got I can only accept it by revelation in faith but I say to you today accept it by revelation and faith it's hard to understood to sit to say that it's hard to understand because some of us have dealt there said winters and really painful things in our life you know that was that word pain was the only thing these three girls really Naomi Ruth Orpah they had one thing in common pain they had one commonality what's what what sorrow suffering pain they were in sorrow together asking why did I lose my husband why I wanted to lose they were dragged away from Bethlehem notice this here to Moab just for their loved ones to die is that was that the purpose of God in their life they were surrounded and suffocating under this feeling of despair under this filling of pain in the space of just 10 years she loses now and loses as a husband both sons this is why she says notice what she says here she says I went out fool oh and Naomi she felt so empty she felt so confused oh she felt such loss oh she loses everything she's in the midst of a famine and pain is the word that she's familiar with Retta just a little devotional was by a man I'm just speaking about some of the trials in his own life it was one a wonderful little devotion I thought it was so wonderful he spoke about pain and he spoke about some of the successes and the some horror he went with there's some really hard things in his life and had a lot of loss in his life and a lot of misunderstanding things he couldn't make sense of and he pinned this and I'm gonna read it a thought of a so profound he said pain is a strange company keeper it brings the oddest people together there's a secret fraternity that exists between people who have been in pain that is mind boggling the connection that they have it transcends the color of your skin when you have been through certain things that other people have been through you feel like you can relate to them you know it's amazing you can take two people who have nothing in common never met each other but just let them go through the same loss or same sorry both lose a husband both lose a son and some accidents just whatever it is both of them have to go through some same trial there's immediately an affinity and a bond and a connection and they feel they can they you you know you can relate to them they have something in common something comes between there's something between those people because they can relate to each other they can enter in it says why brother Branham says you can pray for people but if you really want to pray you enter into their suffering and he says here he says there's a bond and he says he says you feel for other people who have been through those things because you can relate to them and he goes on further he says personally he says I I don't I don't have a lot to do with people who have never been through pain it's nothing against them I hold nothing against them I just can't relate to them and I'm sure they can't relate to me either he says because the parts of me that make up who I am the parts of me that I need to have touched the parts of me that I need fellowship in the parts of me that I need to be healed in there tied up not in the successes of my life but they are tied up and bound up in the struggles of my life for God has done more through my struggles than in my successes and if you look carefully at my successes they are made up out of the ingredients of my struggles and you can never know my successes until you understand my struggles because they are the pathway that led me to my successes this is exactly the domani of cisternae on me it was going to be the hardest struggle of her life it was going to be the hardest pain that she ever went through she has something in common with these girls they have suffered loss they had suffered pain it struggled they were struggling the Bible says they lifted up their voices and they wept all together you can hear them weeping over the sorrow that they had died in their life and to make matters worse Naomi is a stranger in Moab she's been sitting there she doesn't know anybody she has no family she's not just suffering pain but the Bible says they lifted up their voice and they wept and I could imagine here as I just ponder that here for a moment as I enter in and maybe you can just peek in just here for a moment as sister Naomi she feels so empty she feels so confused her life just doesn't make any sense doesn't make any sense what happened oh that's what she says I left full but now I'm empty don't call me Naomi call me Mara from bitter God has dealt bitterly with me she was saying leave me alone my life is over don't you understand my mind my life is over I don't have time to live life again I can't win back the hand of time I don't have time to have more children and yet she says if I did you would want you to wait on them and Marianela them already don't you get it I I can't do it all over again you ever felt that way I don't get a redo can't redo it all my story's already been written I'm already done my husband has died I'm a widow in a strange land Oh sister Naomi was so discouraged she was so suffocating under this distress she literally was saying don't lean on me anymore because I have nothing to give you I'm empty I have nothing to offer you I can't offer you any wisdom I can't offer you any blessing because I myself I'm empty I can't give you anything my life is over don't you see she but you know what my brother my sister here's what damn we didn't realize she realized it later but Naomi didn't realize one secret about this trial and about the sorrow she didn't realize that though the devil and tempt attempted and was intent on destroying her to bring her such suffering but she didn't realize that it would be through that suffering that God would produce Ruth in her life it would be Sir Ruth where God was going to connect to a bull as it would be through a Boaz the gunner was gonna make a Jesse oh it would be through a Jessie the dog was gonna bring it David it would be through a David this Jesus Christ would come Naomi you didn't realize that it was your suffering that would secure your own Redemption Oh hallelujah friends I feel anointed right now it is through your suffering that God is going to bring a Ruth and bring a bow ass and does that bring Jesse in a David and a Jesus who would save your family Naomi and it would be through your suffering but you didn't realize it it was going to be that suffering that was literally going to secure your Redemption why than that because God has an unstoppable purpose it was literally a drama playing out in Naomi's life right when she thought of her time was up and her time was over it was just the beginning of her joy and her Redemption God is sovereign over your life today he's sovereign over my life today oh I hope you can just receive that here as we close here today musicians could you return I hope you can just receive this brother Branham says she made it was why you say why because Ruth made a clear-cut decision she made a clear-cut decision oh listen to what brother Branham says he says in the next slide he says all how I like that little Ruth he says she had to make a decision he says I had to make a decision you've got to make a decision you never walk out of those doors this morning without some kind of a decision you'll not leave this room today there being a better woman or a worse man or a worse woman to reject it it'll be worse so to be harder the next time before you to get over or you'll get better it'll come a showdown next slide in her life it comes to showdown in everybody's life and Ruth had to make a decision so the Bible says that her mother-in-law taught her go back to your gods like your sister did go back like the lukewarm did why don't you just go back the gospel preacher if you want to go on go on the real truthful preacher that'll put it before the class of people you make your decision you stand on your feet the lukewarm wishy-washy in and out won't say that but a real servant of God will lay it on your lap make your decision and Ruth said next slide I'll go where you go your people will be my people your God will be my god where you live I'll live where you die I die where you're buried I'll be buried that's there's the real decision Lord I'll take you as my Saviour if the Bible says repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ that I'll do if the must receive the Holy Ghost that I'll do Bible Tesman Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever that I'll believe I'll take the Bible and God for what he's raped and what he is no matter what any body else says there's the real next slide there's the real Ruth she made her decision she had to either go back or go forward we stand on the same grounds this morning go back or go forward don't never go back let's go forward Onan through the promised land they went into the land of strange people oh brother Branham says oh he says that's what the Ruth had to do she had to come from her own over to know the people she was converted she made a decision and you make a decision you've got to take your choice you want to go back to the things of the world you want to go with God you want to act like the ward of the rest of them then kiss Christ goodbye and go back but if you want to take way with the Lord's despise fuel can you raise your hands this morning and say I'll take the way with the Lord's despise few and a hold of God's unchanging hands regardless of what the rest of the world says you hold
