but you just turn back towards calvary anytime say oh lord remind me once again oh lord baptize me once again amen that's my desire let's let's just stand and sing as the deer key of sea i believe david tapped into a real inspiration when he wrote the songs amen so thankful for them oh as the deer panteth for the water so my soul longeth to you you are alone all my hearts desire to worship you

not lie it says he's here let's just pray to him oh god stop us to be silent in your presence lord that you could speak [Music] lord we need your words in this day lord this this dark time that we're going through father when lord it'll be your grace that brings us through [Music] father nothing [Music] nothing of our own strength or power but lord by your power by your might through your blood lord you lead your children with a still and small voice father [Music] you still whisper love to your own lord to your bride would you have total preeminence lord in everything that's said and done lord let it not be to lift up any flesh but lord let you be glorified and father the needs that we have father we're blind to many of them but you know so father give us that which we have need of i pray [Music] we can't ask too much from you lord you're you're the source that'll never run dry father help us just to press in closer to you father and as we go from here lord let us not leave from your presence but lord let us just be caught up a little higher just like enoch that walked with you until one day he just didn't go back to his old ways just came up with you father we believe that that's our calling in this days to take a walk like enoch walked lord help us father to walk that way lord day by day more and more to be filled with your love lord that there'd be nothing to come and divide us lord nothing that would get us to have any hatred in our hearts towards each other lord but the people would know that we're your disciples by our love one for another pray these things lord have your way keep my lips from saying anything that's not your pure word and due season and anoint the years of the year father if we ask these things with expectation that you'll grant it father in jesus name amen amen let's turn to psalm 63 verse 1. thank you sister martha this is a psalm of david when he was in the wilderness of judah another another place very dry like like our surroundings they've got entire seas that are dead so salty and you wouldn't even think an ocean could be dead and dry but that's that's the condition of this place that david was often hiding and running for his life but but look what comes out of his heart when he's in such a place he says oh god thou art my god early will i seek thee my soul thirsteth for thee that's what he's thirsting for is for god my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land where no water is to see thy power and thy glory so as i have seen thee in the sanctuary because thy loving-kindness is better than life my lips shall praise thee thus will i bless thee while i live i will lift up my hands in thy name my soul shall be satisfied do you have that confidence though you're in a dry place as you call out to the lord my soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips is that a prophecy of you my mouth lord will praise you with joyful lips when i remember thee upon my bed and meditate on thee in the night watches because thou hast been my help therefore in the shadow of thy wings will i rejoice my soul followeth hard after thee thy right hand upholdeth me another translation says my soul clings to you thy right hand upholdeth me that's david's thirst and then let's go to john chapter 4 verse 13. i always seem to when i'm studying to to get some some scriptures together it seems like there's always such beautiful scripture for any subject that i've i've thought on or meditated on or studied it's always been the case that there's this same theme in the old testament and it's brought out in the new testament and it's been such a blessing to me to see that that no matter what the thought is or what it is it's always something that runs through the bible because this is a perfect book john chapter 4 verse 13 this is jesus answered and said unto her this is the woman at the well said unto her whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again but whosoever drinketh of the water that i shall give him shall never thirst but the water that i shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life amen you may be seated so i'd like to talk for a few minutes on thirst and maybe part of this came from we were blessed to go up to for the enoch peterson and sister jessica peterson's wedding and this is the first time i'd really been up to that part of the country boise idaho and flying over there it's quite a place because it's amazing that from whatever vantage point you're at and from whatever place you you can see you can immediately tell the condition of that place that you're seeing and whether it has water or not from the airplane or from across the valley or wherever you're at you can just look a long ways off and all the places up there in idaho that have got water that have got a well or have got a river a stream or something they're pretty there's trees and there's there's good grass and crops and animals and different things but then everywhere else it just looks like a potato it's just this brown ugly barren dusty nothing just dead people think that this desert around here is is barren and desolate but the desert up there i mean it's i guess it gets bombarded by the heat and by the snow and just it's brutal up there but it just got me thinking about water and it was amazing to see that you'd be driving down the road away from everything and you'd see on the one side of the road there's a well there's irrigation and there's just green fields real nice and the ground on the other side of the road i mean this is just 10 15 feet away where there's no well there's no irrigation it's just dead it's just nothing and it was just something to to see the power of water and to see that i think sometimes we get the idea you know this this word is water talks about washing water by the word this word is spirit and its life this word and when it comes in in its purity when it comes in in true anointing when it comes in its entirety not having been sliced and diced and mixed up its water its life and i think sometimes we we put too little confidence in the word of god because up there there were no places that there was water and there was nothing growing everywhere that there was water there was life and i didn't see any farmers out there that were irrigating that said oh i hope this works i hope this this water does what it's supposed to do you know they were just putting it out there in in in they had faith in what they were going through all this work to get out there they did a lot of work they had to dig down wells to it dig way down i believe that's what brother enoch has been doing is digging wells and there's jacob in the old testament doug some wells you know this is worth working for this is worth going down and and whatever it takes get down to that water and then bring it up spread it out because it will bring forth life and i believe we ought to have confidence in this word that we wouldn't be ashamed of this gospel because no matter if you really preach this word in its purity it will bring life now we know not everyone's predestinated to eternal life and some people are just going to be blessed for a little while and they're going to fall away but that's that's above our pay grade that's not our business but everybody everything will be blessed by the pure word of god because it's water so don't be ashamed to be a christian to let your light shine because it is what turns the dry desolate desert into green beauty and that's that's something that i was just so inspired to see in a set and i just got to thinking well lord make me a well make me make me somebody that would just work so hard to to dig down and and do whatever it takes lord that my life could just bring your water and spread it out that i could turn a little area around me beautiful because it's got nothing to do with me it's just got to do with the power of this water as long as i can just keep from contaminating my own self into it if i can just be a conduit and just pull this water from way down deep and push it out then around me will be beauty the people whose lives i touch they will be enriched i think that's the confidence that we should have in this gospel that it's not an insult when we witness to somebody it's not we're not giving them rotten fruits but we're giving them life we're giving them something that no matter who they are no matter where they are this will help you this will make your life better this will this will be a blessing and so that was the thinking that i had was to come back and preach okay everybody we all need to dig we all need to be real good well drillers we need to no matter how far deep it is let's just dig until but thank the lord i found this scripture that says it's not even that way we're not we're not supposed to be well diggers like that even though that's part of it but it's even better than that jesus says that if we drink of his water that this water would be a well of water springing up that's even better that's wonderful no that's that's glorious because i didn't have to work for it i just had to surrender to it i just had to keep out of the way and it's his work just like that little brook that we've heard about that's bubbling you know it's not me that's doing the bubbling it's just for the glory of god because he desired to come and destroy the works of the devil everything that would bring death and destruction and emptiness and barrenness he came that we would have life and that more abundantly this is good news this is good water but i was puzzled looking at this scripture i've been thinking a lot about this scripture in in john because it says he that drinks whosoever drinks of the water that i shall give him shall never thirst and so you see you see these scriptures like david and you see this man that's just so thirsty for god and you hear about some of the old-time you know prayer meetings and the old-time dedication you know people would wrestle all night with an angel right and there was this this desperate longing for more of god but then there's this scripture that says once you drink you'll never thirst and it's a little bit puzzling because that means you've been satisfied and that's a good thing but also what is this what of this thirst and i look and see in my own self you know is that the case am i really thirsting for god or am i not thirsty and and it's a little bit puzzling because you know we want to set the church in order and the church show this problem that problem well how do we do that we start with ourselves we start with what's in our own eye right say okay well if i can uh if i can get this guy straightened out first maybe i can help one of you guys but for now working on myself and what i see in myself is a complacency and where i see david and he's saying oh god early will i seek you i see myself wanting to sleep in and i see a laziness and i say is that the proper fulfillment of this scripture that i'm not thirsty because i've of drinking and i'm good and the thirsting was for the days gone by but once you're sealed then you know that's no longer a part of a christian walk and so i kind of wrestled with this with this scripture because it's these things are important i'll tell you i'll tell you a little testimony of um tonight we're gonna come to church and you know i've been running around working this and that and everybody's been running around taking care of the kids and so go to get in the car kids are all loaded the kids are all dressed for church lydia's all dressed for church her hair is done you know a lot of work had had gone into getting the mcfadden family ready for church i say a lot of work had been done it had been done by lydia i was i was studying and things but she put a lot of work into getting the kids ready to go everything and it was it was the right time she was on time i was really proud of her that she was on time and everything was good every we were all just ready for church but we couldn't find the key somewhere other the the car key had gotten hidden lost gone and there was no way to turn the car on there was gas in the car there was air in the tires there was an engine but we almost missed church because of something this big this little thing thanks lord lydia found the key i left her i left my wife to come to church and and then she found the key thank the lord and so she came but it got me thinking you know there will be people that are so ready for the rapture their hair is done their clothes are there they got their family lined up they're at the right place at the right time they've got gas in the engine they've got air in the tires but there's going to be a people that's missing just a little detail no oil in the lamp somewhere other they ran out of the spirit somewhere other that where there was supposed to be this well of water that was just pushing out and overflowing and they're supposed to just be every need supplied they got empty i thought oh god these are serious things i want to make sure that my satisfaction and my lack of thirst is the proper fulfillment of this scripture because we see in in the letter to the laodiceans we see a people that they think they got need of nothing and so they're not thirsting for anything they've got no no desire for any more of anything but spiritually they're so seriously lacking that they can't possibly make that rapture and i'm this this is for me right i'm not i'm not out here saying well you you're all dry potatoes like idaho i'm i'm i'm trying to figure out where i'm at and what i need and i'm so encouraged by this word because i believe that for every question that you can have there's an answer right there and i believe if we'll just be honest before the lord and say i don't understand this lord what's going on in his time i believe he'll show us and it won't be any contrary thing to this word it'll just line up perfectly with this word but in the psalms it says that our god satisfies the longing soul and he fills the hungry soul with goodness so i know that that's his desire for me is that i would be properly satisfied is that my soul once hungry would be filled with goodness and he's the only one good so you have to be filled with him and we know that when jesus is talking about these rivers of water it says later in john 7 it says that he spake of the spirit which they that should believe on him should receive so what he's talking about this this fountain that you'd never thirst again it's the spirit of god and so there's there's no thirst but then it's it's two parts it doesn't just say whosoever drinketh the water let's just put it up again john 4 14 just so we can see it together but i believe the answer is there in the scripture is it says whosoever drinketh of the water that i shall give him shall never thirst doesn't end there but the water that i shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up onto everlasting life see the reason there's no thirst is because there's a continuous supply that as soon as you would start to get thirsty it's right there as soon as you would start to need a little more god he's there as soon as you would try to go and draw an eye to him he'd draw an eye to you if you take a step towards him he'd run to you prodigal that's our god you say oh know that you know once you're once you're all filled up that's just for everyone else that is for everyone else but the ox that treads the corn is not to be muzzled because the worker is supposed to eat that too that's for us too if we're not drinking we're dead we're just like the ugly part to idaho we're dry and we're dead and i don't want to be that i want to be quick i want to be alive i want i don't just want to have my soul sealed and filled with the spirit and then have the rest of my life the rest of my being just be cracked and dry and dead but i believe the desire of god for each of us is that we would just be fulfilled head to toe everywhere just with his spirit and i believe that there should be a desire in our hearts for that to be and i think if we come to the place that i can find myself in that we're just satisfied not to be drinking not to be taken and enjoying this fountain then i don't believe that that's the correct lack of thirst but i believe that though we're filled with the spirit there should still be a desire you know if if he's really if we're really the bride and he's really the groom he ought to mean everything to us we ought to be so in love with him that we just want to be where he is that we just want to sit at his feet and learn with him that we just want to be a door keeper in his house we just we ought to be twitter twitter-pated right and sometimes i don't see that i see a lack of desire for that and i don't want to be satisfied and empty i just want to be satisfied and filled i don't want to find myself at the end of the day having once had oil and you know maybe being maybe being saved still but empty but oh god just help me to to want you because i know that this scripture says i'll never thirst you know i heard a striking statement i may have said this before but i've been chewing on it and and the statement says you're as close to god as you want to be you've got as much of god as you want to have you're as in love with him as you want to be because if you would thirst if you would say oh god i want a little bit more that would be satisfied say oh god in my flesh i see such corruption won't you quicken me won't you make me alive there is a fountain we won't thirst but sometimes i feel like we've been just been made complacent there was a there was a quote here that i found from there's a preacher named tozer and i thought this was pretty good this kind of goes in line with that it says before we can be filled with the spirit the desire to be filled must be all-consuming it must be for the time the biggest thing in the life so acute so intrusive as to crowd out everything else and then it says the degree of fullness in any life accords perfectly with the intensity of true desire so how full any life is is perfectly in accord with the intensity of what the desire is we have as much of god as we actually want one great hindrance to the spirit-filled life is the theology of complacency so widely accepted among gospel christians today this lukewarmness right i don't know if mr brother tozer knew about legacy and church age and this lukewarmness but he could see this spirit of complacency that said well just give me enough just i'll be satisfied to be average and that is very widely accepted even you know even among us it's easy to just say well how's everyone else doing okay i'm about there good but i believe there ought to be something that's just drawing us like a magnet that just day by day oh maybe that was enough for yesterday but can i get a little closer today can i get a little more full today can i get a little more emptied out today can i be a little more green today he continues he says according to this acute view uh to this view acute desire is an evil evidence of unbelief and proof of lack of knowledge of the scripture so he's saying these uh these people that accept complacency think that anything else is just unbelief and lack of knowledge in the scriptures he says a sufficient refutation of this position is afforded by the word of god itself and by the fact that it always fails to produce real saintliness among those who hold it is that satisfaction that complacency is it producing the life of christ is it making real saints now we don't we don't judge on outward appearances we don't judge anything before it's time and so we don't you know even if we're not seeing what the promises are we still hold to the promises but at the same time we want to look and see well what fruits is this producing in my life am i satisfied am i not thirsting because this life of christ is a fountain coming out of me and i'm drinking from that fountain and other people are being blessed from that fountain and this is just according to the scriptures and that's why i'm not thirsty or am i not thirsty because i've fallen into this slumber this complacency because just like we're talking last time about every word you know if you take this and you only preach the parts that you like it's cursed your name if you take parts out of this your name is taken from the book of life it's a very serious thing and so we want to be sure that we've got the key he's the door he's the way i believe he's the key do we really have him is he our treasure are we satisfied because we've we've found that pro of great price and we're we've given everything for it where our treasure is there's where our heart will be also i have to ask myself lord were you my treasure today i know before you have been but lord have i have i changed my desires have i lost my first love have i been has my eyes been caught by the glitter and glamour of this world where am i at lord because in my heart i want to be what he wants me to be i want to be where he is there's so what i almost did tonight instead of speaking this is i almost played there's a there's a sermon called getting in the spirit and i almost just played that but if you get a chance to listen that i just believe it'd be a real blessing to you and in this this gets a little bit closer to the well well digging but it's not it's not that we've got to go and do it all ourselves but in this in this sermon getting in the spirit brother branham was talking about in the bible where the the king of israel ahab said hey come and fight with me to the king of judah come you know we're going to go fight together and they went up and it says they went seven days before they thought to ask of the lord what to do and what a striking thing that we can be all all ready to go and get her done that we don't consult with the lord say lord is this your will and and you know brother brandon was comparing that kind of to the seven church ages and then uh i couldn't help but think we've been we've been seven years now now i don't know if that's anything but i so believe that we ought to be desirous to be sure that there's nothing blocking us from that promise of this fountain because that's a promise that's for you whether you receive it or not he said whosoever will whosoever would drink of this water so if you if you have a desire for that you won't thirst he'll fill that desire and so brother branham's talking about this where they wait seven day seven days and then they ask the prophet okay what do we do and and the prophet says go down into the valley and dig you know make these make this valley full of ditches get real low go and dig everything else dig everything out and god supplied the water they didn't have to dig wells they didn't have to dig down to it but they had to do something they had to want to obey and they had to want to to clear whatever was in the way of of what god had told them to do and i thought well peter look at yourself what's what needs to be removed the brand was talking about like a well that got clogged up with logs and different things that would you know once this was a fountain once this was a life-giving source but things had gone and gotten in there and he says you don't need a new organization you don't need a new still small voice i think even said you just need to clean out what's gotten in there just over the time have we gotten old have we gotten stiff have we gotten hard and are we not thirsting just because we've gotten a little dry and and we're okay with it but i believe the lord is coming to restore our youth like the eagle just like abraham and sarah the last last sign there before the promised son is they were made young again and i believe where maybe we've gotten old and we've gotten kind of dried up i believe the lord's here to make us new again to bring us back to the joy of our salvation to bring us fully in love with him not to make us new again like we were in 65 or you know whenever you first came here but to make us pentecost new again to make us the original to take us all the way back until we would not even consider our own lives so we just say lord for your glory use me that he would be everything to us i believe that's what we're going to be restored back to and i believe that if we'll just want that that we won't thirst but that he satisfies the the hungry soul and he satisfies the long and soul and fills the hungry soul with goodness i believe that there are promises of god yet to be fulfilled in this bible for us but in my own self a lot of times i can be hungry here in church for that i can be desirous that but then during the week is that my treasure during the week or is that only my treasure three times a week is it three times a week i come to church no calvary means everything to me his people mean everything to me and then am i just living for myself the rest of the week i don't want to deceive myself you know but he promised that if we drink that's why we've got to drink every word we've just got to keep drawing in even though maybe i can't see it yet i can't understand it yet i just keep saying yes lord i'll take it lord yes help thou my unbelief oh lord take the scales off my eyes unstop my ears see he healed every manner of infirmity when he was here and that's to prove that he can do it but it's also to prove that whatever spiritual condition you have whatever your spiritual problem is he can heal that in the spiritual just like the natural if you've got ears that you just can't hear right he can open the deaf ears if you can't see right he can open the blind eyes if you can't walk right if you can see how a christian ought to walk but you just always walk crooked you always walk with a limp he's the healer of that and if you're spiritually dead he can raise the dead those dry bones that they got really dry and we always talk about that like that's a bad thing oh those bones were very dry maybe that was maybe that was good maybe the flesh that was on was the problem in the first place i don't know but whatever it is he can help us but let's just look to him let's look to his promises that i really encourage you to go listen to that sermon but here was a part of it that kind of jumped out to me is um so he says here god wants to call us together are you interested in what god wants i am god wants to call us together in a unity of power to bring back the fullness of the holy ghost into the church again with all the spiritual gifts in operation in every local body that's what he wants are we hungry for that are we thirsty for that does that are we interested because he said we wouldn't thirst so if we would if we would just say yes lord amen then before we could get too thirsty i believe we'd see it i believe that that spirit would just brood over us i believe it's the time you know when i look at i look at paul's life god used this man he i mean he took him off his high horse he supernaturally moved in this man's life that we could have so much of the of the new testament what a blessing and so i do believe that he was filled with the holy ghost and i believe he said follow me as i follow christ so i want to see how did he follow christ was he just not thirsty anymore and just you know well just waiting to be picked up boys but in in philippians 3 if we can go to philippians 3 and 8 and read through here when i see what paul's attitude is towards christ i see such a desire that i want in my own life and i want to say amen because in philippians 3 and 8. he says and we'll read down philippians 3 8 read down to verse 16. he says ye doubtless and i count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of jesus christ my lord for whom i have suffered loss of all things and you count them but dung that i may win christ so he's you can see where his treasure is is to know christ and that's what i want is where he says that i may win christ he says later that i may know him but here he says if philippians 3 and 8 if we can put up you know everything else is secondary but he has this he's still pressing towards us that i may win christ and then philippians 3 and 9 we'll read the next verse and be found in him not having my own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the faith of christ the righteousness which is of god by faith that i may know him see it's not well i do know him no he's not he's not saying he's already there but he's saying that i may know him that i may he's you could almost say he's thirsty we know that the bible says he'll never thirst but it's like he's getting ready to thirst and the lord's just day by day giving him his daily bread is that our desire though are we praying lord whatever spiritual bread you have for me today i need it are we still asking that are we still praying that part of the lord's parents and lord it's another day i need more bread i need more wine i need a little bit of something to pick me up here i need a little joy i believe we should be drunk in the spirit that's that's what they were back at pentecost you can't say well we're going all the way back to pentecost and we're just going to be all theologians no they were drunks drunks on the spirit but but see it's it's a kind of drunkenness that causes you to give your life for others it doesn't just lift you up and make you just fool yourself but it makes you always empty out and just surrender to the lord it says that i may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death if by any amine any means i might attain unto the resurrection of the dead not as though i had already attained either already perfect but i follow after if that i may apprehend that for which also i am apprehended of christ jesus he still pursuing he's still taking in he's still eating he's still drinking see he's not saying i want this and and you know i haven't found any way to get it but he's saying i'm he's going forward in faith he's going to try to apprehend this for which he's apprehended by christ jesus he says brethren i count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing i do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before i press towards the mark for the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus i don't want to be so satisfied in my current situation that i'm not pressing towards the mark let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded everyone else this is how we're to be minded and if your if in anything you be otherwise minded god shall reveal even this unto you nevertheless we're unto we have already attained let us walk by the same rule let us mind the same thing are we still drinking from that fountain because this this is water from that fountain this is not just the words of paul this is the words that the holy ghost spoke through paul and so if we take that out and we say yeah well i don't really see that right now so i'm just not gonna not gonna address that then you've changed the gospel you've no longer got jesus christ the living word but you've got an idol that's kind of close but it's missing part see it's not that the water is not there it's that people voluntarily will leave the water and they'll go to something that's close but a little bit more appetizing and jeremiah says for my people have committed two evils they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters and hewed them out cisterns broken cisterns that can hold no water see it doesn't say that the fountain ever stopped that promise of god is that the fountain would be there but have we left it have we turned aside is there anywhere in our lives and i'm not talking about you know as a as a church or a body or as a family i'm talking about individuals have i in my heart anywhere have i set up some image of god to worship and stuff every word have i have i just kind of looked around and tried to figure out based on what everyone else is doing what a christian ought to be or am i minded like paul who's just pressing every day but i believe we're meant to be walking in the spirit i believe that this if we could go go to galatians chapter 5 and verse 18. i believe the spirit's not just something that's in our soul but it's something that that we walk in something that that we're called to to take in our our everyday life it says in galatians 5 and 13. see there's always the two sides we always want to keep balanced and so the one side will just look only at you know works the other side will look at grace but the truth is if you just leave that channel open you just stay drinking it'll push out goodness that water is life and that seed will bring forth of its kind that word won't return void it'll accomplish that which it's supposed to do but look what it'll do if we'll just take it it says for brethren ye have been called unto liberty we are free we're not doing this to try to paul is not chasing us to try to save his soul but his soul is saved but still there's something in paul that he's just got to have a little bit more he's just got to get a little closer he says brethren we've been called unto liberty only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh but by love serve one another see if we say we know god and love god or we hate our brother something's wrong but this liberty that we're called into ought to make us love one another to the point that we serve one another but by love serve one another for all the law is fulfilled in one word even in this thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself that's what we're getting restored back to you that's pentecost but if you bite and devour one another take heed that you be not consumed one another this i say then walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh see where's our desire because in myself i see the lust of the flesh popping up here and there this catches my eye and this catches my eye things that are just worldly but here in galatians it says we can walk in the spirit and we won't fulfill that lust i want that you know this this is not i don't believe that's a question of salvation i don't believe that you know we're saved by grace through faith but there is a way that a believer can walk in the spirit so that we don't fulfill the lust of the flesh and i have a desire for that and i know that if i would just start to thirst for that lord would meet that thirst because he said that i wouldn't thirst so amen that's for me walk in the spirit you should not fulfill the lust of the flesh for the flesh lusteth against the spirit the spirit against the flesh and these are contrary one to the other so you cannot do the things that you would it's still a battle still fighting but if you be led of the spirit you're not under the law now the works of the flesh are manifest well a lot of times we just skip over that part and we just kind of say we'll walk in the spirit and we'll skip straight down to the fruit of the spirit but no there are works of the flesh that we've got to keep an eye out for we've got to watch for these things because they'll always try to poke back in works of the flesh are manifest which are these adultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousness idolatry that's a big one right say well you know adultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousness didn't do any of those what about idolatry what idols have we let creep in where has our love grown cold there and even those those first four where have you know in the way that you're you're looking or presenting yourself you know these are these are matters of the heart that we're looking at it's not just um not just the act but it's what's in our heart is there any anything in us that's not totally just true and pure and lovely if we'll walk in the spirit we won't fulfill those lusts of the flesh idolatry witchcraft hatred variants emulations wrath strife seditions heresies envyings another bad one murderers drunkenness revelings and such like of the which i tell you before as i've told you in times past that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of god she said well you said those things aren't a matter of of salvation well see when you've been saved there is something that draws you in to walk in the spirit so it's not you're saved directly on you know whether you can avoid these things there's no law if you're in the spirit but if you're not in the spirit you are going to fall into these things no way about it your flesh is born to sin it's good at it and this is a perfect age and place to sin in i mean this is satan's eden this is this is the time unless we're abiding in him we can do nothing but are we desirous of that are we pressing into that or have we or if we just lost all hunger and thirst for righteousness it says but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace long-suffering gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance against such there's no law i'm thirsty for that and that's easy to say but if i'll just start i believe the lord desires to bear that fruit on me more than i desire it myself so if i can get to the point where it's not i desire it here but if i can just get to the point where i just say amen and i don't look at anything else i just look at the word and i don't look at my own shortcomings and my own failures and anything contrary to the word but i'll just say this is the fruit of the spirit i have a promise that there'd be a fountain of the spirit there there'd be all this water so how can there not be all this green and if i just say yes lord i believe it be it unto me according to your word then all of a sudden these lusts of the flesh they just start falling away these fruits of the spirit start coming up see it's not not what we do it's just can we dig those things out of the way those ideas those ideas like being a christian is just coming to church and doing what we're doing and and what we're doing is great and enough i don't believe that i believe there's so much more that the lord wants to do with us i believe just like the brandon said that every gift operating in every local body i believe there's more so let's throw out these ideas that just god to only operate in the box that we'd expect him to operate in maybe he wants to do something with us that none of us have ever considered i don't know but i want to want his will more than my own thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as in heaven i want that to be from my heart not just for my lips i want that to be so part of me but if i'll desire that he's a good god he he fills the hungry soul let's see where were we and they that are meekness temperance against such there's no law verse 24 and they that are christ have crucified the flesh with all the affections and lusts i'm crucified with christ that's part of it too we want that part too not i that live but christ that is within me crucified the flesh with all affections and lusts if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit let us not be desirous of vain glory provoking one another envying one another this is life this is bread this is daily bread let's just keep drinking just keep taking every day everything that he has for us if this is martha if you come back up and we'll end with some songs i'm thinking about that that key that one thing the most important thing let's put up john 17 3. jesus speaking says and this is life eternal that they might know thee the only true god and jesus christ whom thou has sent just like paul i want to really know him i want to know him more today than i did yesterday i want to know more the next day that's life eternal is to know him i don't want to get there and him say i never knew you depart from me to miss that the most important thing but we have that promise let's put that up again john 4 13 and 14 and we'll just finish with that we'll and then we'll if you could play in b flat there's a fountain filled with blood jesus answered and said unto her whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again but whosoever drinketh that the water that i shall give him shall never thirst but the water that i shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up onto everlasting life springing up to the knowledge of him because that is what we just read you know in in matthew and john this is life eternal that we that they may know thee the only true god and jesus christ now said so if we'll just stay with us if we just keep the channels clear god is moving i believe he's drawing us so i don't mean to be tricky i don't mean to say well are we supposed to be thirsty are we supposed to not just be a christian just let your heart be so in love with him but expect what this book says don't expect whatever version whatever half version you can find anywhere but expect this whole thing every part of it and he'll bring our righteousness forth like the light promises we've got great and exceeding wonderful promises let's just hold on to them let's pray let's stand together lord these are your words and my words lord are nothing but lord your words are everything and father these words won't return void these words from your bible the lord they're powerful they're quick and they're alive and just like the water lord brings forth such beauty and such life even from desolation lord i believe that your word bring forth so much more just pray lord that you would help us father the rest of this service the rest of this week lord help those that are traveling bless them and help our church father you know what we have need of father help us to be surrendered to you father in jesus name amen we've got just turned in here as well a prayer request and a praise from sister tony asking prayers for my sister andrea rojas she's been having bad allergies and that's been causing her eye problems and swelling so we want to remember sister andrea and then here's a praise from brother tim cruz who's working on some wiring today and accidentally shorted the wires the spark flashed right in my eye and the image of the spark persisted for about ten to five to ten minutes i was worried i might have burned my retina but after praying it finally went away thank the lord amen that would be scary our god is good let's pray for sister andrea lord this need sister tony turned in just pray lord that you'd move on the scene the lord moved through my sister tony and brother tim lord that they could be be your servants father whatever they could do and just pray lord that you'd heal our sister help her father thank you for helping brother tim and helping his eye or just thank you that you're mindful of us we love you lord and thank you for your word and for your spirit just come and let us worship you here for a few minutes lord and as we go from here let us go with worship in our hearts to you lord that we could glorify your name in jesus name amen are fountain filled with [Music] plunge beneath [Music] lose all their guilt [Music] beneath that flood lose all their guilty stains the dying thief rejoice to see that fountain in his day and there may i though vile as he wash all my sins away wash all my sins away wash all my sins away and there may i go vile as he wash all my sins away thou die in lambda shall never lose its power till all the ransom church of god are saved to sin no more save to sin no tell all the ransom church of god are saved to sin no more hair sins by faith i saw the stream lie flowing wound supply redeeming love has been my theme and shall be till i die and shall be telling and shall be till i die redeeming love has [Music] amen god bless you thank you it's good to see you i believe the lord had you here for a reason so pray you're blessed [Music] as you go just go with go with god and love him love one another if you'd like to stay in worship we'll stay and worship a little while but in key of g i feel the pole but god bless you i feel i hear the call [Music] and i know his spirit's moving he speaks to me and i agree lord please come and take control at night i lay in bed and i begin to cry [Music] and my mind just fails to know exactly why i can't explain with tongue or pen the spirit's crawling steep within it must be god here in my soul i feel [Music] and i know his spirit's moving me to give my own he speaks to me and i agree lord please come [Music] i just want to say something before before everyone leaves what i said there about you know being seven years and making sure we've sought the lord i don't mean to shake your confidence at all i do believe the lord has led us this way and i believe we've been the way that we've been for a reason and you know i don't understand all of it but i have confidence that it's been for our good uh for i know that he works all things together for the good of them that love god and are they called according to his purpose so i don't mean to criticize or say anything like that but what i do mean to say is let's make sure as we go forward that we don't just go you know any any any way without really seeking him first seeking his will first inquiring of the lord i believe you know whatever the last seven years have been have been that way for a reason and let's just make sure that here where we're at that we just really press into the lord and really look at ourselves and not just say okay what are the problems with everyone else but look and say oh lord what's the problem with me where am i causing this church to fail brother branham said one one person's sins in a congregation can cause the whole church to bitterly fail and that doesn't make you look around and say well you you says lord where where are my sins hindering your movement where is my unbelief hurting my brothers and my sisters oh lord let me [Music] be healed that i wouldn't be in your way so i believe if we'll just go with that attitude that desire and just say oh god you know i was thinking and maybe some of us we are just living in that fountain we are i pray it is that some of us are just really just every day more and more i believe i believe it is that way but there was also there were three men that they thought so much of their brother the king that he was thirsty and they went and fought through an army of philistines just to bring him a drink i think we ought to have that that respect towards one another the word says you're kings and priests we don't say well i'm a king and a priest you say okay these my brothers and sisters these are kings and priests and if one of these kings one of these queens is thirsty i'll fight through an army for you i'll get sent out of my life for you that god can move and heal us i believe for us to get where we want to be where the lord wants us to be we cannot get there without a love like that without a love that'll say i'm gonna fight through an army of philistines because somebody there needs a drink but that's part of the promise that we could love like he loved we could love to lay down our lives for one another [Music] he's so good i went to hear the word and with each line and frames he was calling me to give a higher [Music] oh there's a deep call to the deep like a great magnet me i know for sure you know i'll reach the goal for i feel the poll he that started a good work we'll finish [Music] and i know his spirit's moving me to give my own he speaks to me and i agree lord please come [Music] and the more that i surrender [Music] lighter my lord the more that i release my cares the more he takes control the more that i can humble myself the more you lift me up every day i live lord i love you more the more that i surrender [Music] the more that i release my cares the more you take control the more that i can humble myself the more you lift me up every day i live [Music] this is my desire to you lord with all my heart i worship you with all i have within me i give you pain all that i adore you lord i give you my heart i give you my soul you alone every breath that i take every moment i'm awake lord have your way in me lord i give you my heart i give you my soul [Laughter] i live for you alone every breath that i take the moment i'm awake lord have your way in me have your way have your way [Music] holy spirit come fill our hearts and have your way oh as we wait as we pray oh speak your word into our hearts and have your way oh have your way have your way holy spirit come fill our hearts and have your way oh as we wait as we pray speak your word into our hearts and have your way and jesus draw me close close the lord to you let the world around me fade away oh jesus draw me close closer lord to you for i desire to worship and obey [Music] oh jesus draw me cross close the to you that the world around me fade away jesus draw me close close the lord to you for i desire to worship and obey and cause me to come to thy river me to come to thy river cause me to come to thy river oh lord cause me to come cause me to drink me to lay and cause me to live in thy presence oh lord cause me to live in thy presence oh lord cause me to live in thy presence oh lord cause me to come cause me to drink caused me to lay it caused me to drink at thy river caused me to drink at thy river lord caused me to drink at thy river alone caused me to come and
