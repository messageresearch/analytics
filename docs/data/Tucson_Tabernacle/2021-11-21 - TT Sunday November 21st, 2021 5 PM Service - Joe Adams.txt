seed in you i appreciate that today we have a couple of requests here brother tony ramirez called and asked us to remember his son rudy they found his head he'd had pain in his neck and his back and

they have contacts over there and that's those are muslim especially their countries and their so just remember them and in prayer as they go there's something in your heart that drives you to to do

to the local congregation wednesday night service is canceled for thanksgiving and getting together with the family some folks would travel and i know brother joe adams and them they'll be going up tomorrow to see the grand canyon and coming down through sedona and all the all the places that the visitors go see and when i met my wife who was born and raised here she had never been to the grand canyon you know how that works you live here you say i can always go see it tomorrow and tomorrow sometimes just never comes [Music] ocean [Music] evening whose words can only catch a falling star will i know my redeemer [Music] let this life within me cry i know [Music] [Applause] [Music] and and the same gentle hands that hold me when i'm broken they conquered death to bring me victory [Music] let all creation testify let this life within me die i [Music] to take away my [Music] was a precious life [Music] oh [Music] let this [Music] [Music] [Applause] i thought for sure it'd be two or three songs amen it's it's it's good to hear the young people testify to sing to worship the lord you know and that's following the in the footprints of godly parents those it carries it goes down we we get to talking about it sometime and we praise god and thank god for the godly heritage that he's given us amen amen so brother craig i'm going to call you up and just share a few words i know you're on vacation so just keeping vacation time just you know something more than i do huh just come up and share some of someone's heart so i appreciate that thank you well i certainly didn't expect this but we're believers and we're taught to be instant in season out of season and every day that goes by we wake up in the morning we dedicate that day to the lord we say lord look where you brought me from without my help you reached down and you found me and you plucked me out and god sheds his light upon our footsteps as we walk and it's a journey and every one of us comes from a different walk of life but we all have this in common one day god came by and every one of us had whatever life it was or wherever we come from it forever changed our life and sometimes our young people they may take for granted the truth that we that that we have you know that they have come into maybe grown up listening to been raised in truth but i say it's just as much of a miracle for god to keep them as it is to transform someone's life and overhaul their life from alcohol and and so forth then the keeping power of almighty god so whatever way you come we can only say is the grace of god we're thankful for that and so i want to encourage you in your walk because i know that life is full of ups and downs i tell my wife sometimes i said you know and i'm not against facebook but facebook is only shows one side brother branham said the bible shows both sides the bible never failed to show david's mistakes and peter's mistakes and moses failures abraham's failures samson's failures and you know we can relate to that did you know that uh brother branham had 30 i think it was bosworth that said brother branham had 30 to 40 visions a day 30 to 40 visions a day that's not that's not you know counting his praying for the sake he don't know whether he's in this dimension or the next dimension and we we can't relate to that i don't know anyone else in the world that had 30 to 40 visions a day but we can relate to a time where brother branham gets under pressure and tells a lie under pressure but you know he didn't have to tell us he could have hid that and stood 20 foot tall in our eyes but he came to the pulpit because he wasn't afraid of being real and he wasn't afraid to give god the credit and say you know what i made a mistake and when he repented he said i wept like a baby prayed for three hours and said i wept like a baby and he said god if you forgive me will you come by my way and he said he looked and here come a whirlwind through the remote woods no one is around and you think no one in the world cares and god come down through that woods like a whirlwind he said i wept like a baby we can relate to the humanity and the frailty we read in the bible and we can relate i thank god this message showed both sides he's showing no matter who you are that there is a place that the grace of god has provided and furthermore brother branham said we are without excuse because god's grace is so great he can rise us above circumstances he can rise us above our sickness he can rise us above our own selves and we can thank god for that but the real life is the ups and the downs that's real life every one of us know that that is true one day you're up one day you are down and sometimes veils of darkness fall upon our lives and trials are real and trials go for weeks and months and even years but god remains constant and if we will believe with all of our hearts the clouds will disperse and the sun is still shining i love what john said he said he shined like the sun shineth in its strength that's what he saw in the church ages and we know the church ages was full of dark ages we know that the church ages was full of antichrist spirits and church splits and all kinds of chaos but when john saw him he said he was shining in his strength amen so brother branham told us that even when the clouds are covering that the sun is still shining don't that make you happy when you're sick the sun is still shining when you're depressed the sun is still shining when the church is in turmoil the sun is still shining and in its power and its glory and its strength hallelujah god's word is still true praise the mighty name of the lord and i know you all been going for a trial going through a trial for a long time but i want to tell you that god's power is still shining hold your head up like christians amen it is not our confidence in us it's our confidence in him who will not fail us and i want to encourage you tonight all of us go through trials and sometimes trials are long have confidence in god none of us has went 25 years like abraham yet and one day it was all today together different you remember brother branham said that about is this all right brother branham i'm sorry [Laughter] i did not intend for this so brother bradham said that abraham he said he'd get up say honey how you feeling no different praise the lord we're going to have a baby five years go by honey how you feeling no different abraham praise the lord we're gonna have it anyhow ten years goes by honey how are you feeling how are you feeling no different praise the lord we're going to have it anyhow how many feel that way amen that god is going to answer our prayers god is going to have his way in our life god is going to bring our children back god is going to give us a revival god is going to answer hallelujah he's going to do it because he promised it god give us that confidence don't look at the weakness don't look at the valleys keep your eye on the sun that is always shining when it's raining the sun is still shining in our trials the sun is still shining amen and even when we're in hurting times the sun is still shining tucson tabernacle the sun is shining bright and it is power and in his strength may god give you the strength that you need to hold your testimony it'll come out more beautiful than you could ever imagine we love you with the love of the lord god bless you [Applause] okay brother joe you got 10 minutes left which means nothing what did they say when a minister says i'm almost done what does it mean nothing amen brother greene talked about the time he was traveling with brother branham on a hunting trip going up to canada and brother branham asked brother green do you know any jokes and brother green said i thought i'm in trouble now i'm from texas and what texan doesn't know a joke and brother branham says tell me one and he said we're talking and we're making each other laugh just sharing things and suddenly brother braham says brother green we're going to have to pray for them we're going to they're going to be in an accident he could go from that to the next you know but you know jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever for a while you may be laughing a little while later he may be crying but it doesn't change him he's the same amen i appreciate great is thy faithfulness the chorus great is our faithfulness great is [Music] let's hear it a little more [Music] done a cappella no song there's just no music greatest thy faithfulness great is thy faithfulness morning by morning new mercies i see all i have needed thy hand has provided great is our faithfulness [Music] lord unto me amen i like that even when it's raining the sun is still shining and god says as long as there's a sun he said you know it's true amen one of these days we won't need this son anymore because this he'll be the light hey you're looking for that amen if he'll stand and has been good to be in the house of the lord but we're under expectation for more whatever god has for us so amen amazing grace how sweet the sound how many knows it's been his grace in your life those of you that haven't known his grace how have you done it it's been his grace amen [Music] amazing grace [Music] like me my once was [Music] and because of his grace let's just praise him [Music] praise god praise god [Music] praise god praise god god oh praise god praise god praise god father we thank you lord this evening we thank you for your grace lord how sufficient it is lord as we had heard even when the when the storms all around the sun is still shining shining forth radiating the glory of the almighty the one who formed it and fashioned it there's a tight lord that no matter what we go through in life you're always there you're always present you're always mindful father what a grace we've experienced a little mercy has been due upon us father we just asked this evening you'll come by our way once again lord and break the bread of life speak to our hearts father anoint the lips of your servant the ears of the listener tonight we just give you honor give you glory and give you praise and we give you thanks now for we ask it all in the precious name of jesus christ amen well it's good to be back here with you brother ed good to have you in service with us tonight god bless you amen we're going to look here once again in hebrews 13 and verse hebrews 13 and verse 8. and i want to pick back up on this thought that we were this morning and there's going to be some things that you may hear again i think many of us as learners sometimes we have to hear things multiple times before we finally catch the inspiration or case the significance of it for it to really settle in our minds so there's going to be some things that were said you will say brother joe well you mentioned that already this morning well just hang tight and let your spirit anoint that same word and maybe this time it won't go over your head but it'll come into your mind drop down into your heart and begin to produce the life in which we believe that it can but we find here in hebrews in 13 and verse 8 jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever all right god bless you you can have your seats this evening and i'd like to speak to you as we just mentioned jesus christ the same today but i want to give this a sub topic of what are you going to do i love brother aaron didn't know and i'd been praying for the mind of god for the service but in his prayer he actually brought out he said many times we're waiting on god to do something it's you and i as believers who are waiting on god but god is waiting on us and if we can catch the significance of that tonight i believe our lives will be transformed god is waiting on us so my question to tucson tabernacle at this thanksgiving season what are you going to do not as a church body but as an individual believer what are you going to do how are you going to believe what are you going to believe you know brother craig didn't mention his church that he just recently took there in connecticut was a church and this is all free now i'll start my time clock but his church was without a pastor for a long time as well he and i went in faithfully week after week after week month after month after month for a couple years going back and forth with other ministries going there to be a support to the believers until finally god began to move on brother craig's heart to leave louisiana to where her his wife's family's from and our family and to go and take this little church because god has a shepherd for the sheep and i believe that if you keep believing and quit looking at and everything that's going on and every you know maybe there's dissension in the church this one don't agree with that and this one don't agree with that but if we can just focus this evening on god fulfilling his word lord we don't want to just be a church that is sustained by ministry after ministry after ministry lord send us a shepherd send us one who has a burden for the people has a burden for my needs has a burden for my family has a burden for this area and if you begin to pray that way and pray relentlessly that way god will begin to move on that brother's heart on that family's heart and god will begin to move and bring that that pastor that shepherd to meet the needs of the local assembly i've seen god do it and now that congregation that was about 40 to 50 now begins to grow and blossom because god had a shepherd and so many times we don't understand the will of god in our lives because we're in the midst of the storm but if we can ever take a step back from the storm maybe get up a little bit higher and look down and maybe you can see the rationale by which god is doing things because god doesn't do anything by mistake let me just tell you this god doesn't make a mistake how many of you know the story of corey ten boone corey ten boone said it over and over and over and over even in her captivity when she was in a concentration camp being worked miserably by the nazi army she confessed daily god doesn't make mistakes and there's not one of you here this evening that has been in a concentration camp there is one of you there's not one of you here this evening that is going without bread going without water going without substance and yet god doesn't make mistakes god allowed this poor lady to go through a life of misery at the hand of a nazi army and yet it won millions and millions and millions to the lord because god doesn't make mistakes he's faithful she could have turned her back on god she could have walked away and said it's nothing if god loved me then god would bring me out of this he wouldn't put me through this but sometimes we can't see the tender hand of jehovah for what it is because all we see is the trial now this is not in my notes so i don't even know why i'm going there but many times all we see is the trial all we see is a disappointment all we see is the chaos and yet god sees his hand moving and molding and shaping and forming a situation and bringing a local assembly closer and closer and closer for the ripen because he knows what he has in store for this local body now we find here in luke in verse 4 and chapter 17 this is jesus speaking because we're going to look here this evening at the gospel i think we've got to have a better understanding of what the gospel is and the bible would tell us and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet isaiah's and when he had opened the book he had found the place where it was written that the spirit of the lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to preach it to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captive the recovering of the sight to the blind and to set at liberty them that are bruised now jesus found his place in the word now if he was to find his place in the word shouldn't you and i find our place he says to preach the acceptable year of the lord and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and he sat down and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him and he began to say unto them this day this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears i'm here to tell you tucson tabernacle god is gonna have a bride and she's gonna be the very manifestation of the word and there's gotta be somebody that would rise up and say this day this scripture has been fulfilled in your ears lord you declared you're going to have a bride you're going to have a people without spot without wrinkle without blemish lord i stand in an honor tonight as that recipient of that word that i know who i am i know where god has called me i know what god has done in my life i'm not a vagabond i'm not a wayward person but i'm a sean and a daughter of god i know my position i know my calling i know i've been annoying it i know i've been elected and here i am lord to rise to the challenge that i know my place in the scriptures and i'm here at laodicea to testify that god is god and god will never change oh i'm here to tell you he's the same god for tucson tabernacle as he is an even like tabernacle as he is for upper ground tabernacle he's the same god tonight he's the same god and we find he said the spirit of the lord is upon me because i've been anointed to preach the gospel then we find him mark 16 notice mark 16 and verse 15 and he said unto them now this is jesus speaking it's read a letter in my bible and he tells them go you into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature now in luke 4 we find that he's been anointed to preach the gospel not that he didn't declare this and keep it to himself that i'm the only one that can do this but we find in mark 16 he commands the followers his followers that you go into all the world and i want you to preach the gospel i want you to declare the very same thing that i preached that i've been anointed with that i've been anointed for i want you to witness the same thing because he didn't just keep him to himself he didn't just draw everybody to himself says i'm the only one he says no i'm the truth and the way and the life but i want you to go forth and exemplify who i am and that i've called you for this purpose i've called you into this ministry and i want you to declare the gospel so jesus is declaring and commanding his followers to go and do the very same thing that he did go and preach the gospel go and heal the brokenhearted go and bring deliverance to the captive go and give sight to the blind go and set at liberty those that are brewed go out there and declare this word to be true you find people today they they don't want you to sing only believe because that was brother branham's song that wasn't brother brown song that's our song they don't want you to lay hands on the sick that was brother brannan's ministry that's not brother branham's ministry that's god's ministry he anointed for that purpose lay hands on the sick and they shall recover that's the truth or it's not the truth but i'm here to declare to you it's the word of god and we have been anointed brother brother uh craig and brother aaron and myself we have been anointed and you have been anointed to lay hands on the sick it's not just for the ministry it's for them that will believe and if i can get you to believe tonight nothing will stand before that prayer notice now in the in the church ages i love what the prophet of god says here he says now remember this that christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts does anybody want to take a guess how they acted in the book of acts oh brother joe that's not us we don't do that think about the upper room experience they got there and they waited maybe it started off real quiet kind of like it is right here tonight and they waited and some of them probably looked at their clock well he's been 12 minutes my goodness will he hurry up where's he going with this thought tonight and they waited and one day pass and two days pass and this one passed and it passed and it passed and it passed but finally what he told them to go you into the city of jerusalem and you'll wait and you'll be endued with power from on high you go and do what i said and if we can do what he says today the same promise that rested upon them will come down to this church and rest upon each and every believer here tonight because he's the same god notice now he says that christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts see we're not starting over the book of acts we're not going back at the very beginning of this and have to go into the upper room and start it all over we're not repeating the book of acts we are the continuation of the book of acts see our hearts have been turned back to pentecost not to start all over but to be returned back to pentecost that we can continue where pentecost left where pentecost failed at the nazi and council when they walked away from the true word of god god had brought us back to that place so that his end time people will be the continuation the same god that they serve is the same god that we serve the same power that they possess is the same power in which we possess the same anointing the same healing the same delivers in which they went forth and declared it's the same power that we go forth and declare it's a continuation of the book of acts blinded eyes become open frail bodies become well oh my we have been commissioned to preach the gospel that doesn't mean that everybody here tonight are going to come and stand behind this pulpit but what it does mean is every one of you are going to declare you're going to demonstrate that the word is reality because while the word is manifesting clearly through your life see what we do is we allow the word to produce in our lives and through our lives exactly what it says it will do when the word says you can have your offspring there's a people that believe that no matter where they are in life no matter how astray they are they believe that and what happens is when they put that faith out there god begins to grab hold of that faith and god begins to go after him and look you remember the story where there was a young lady and she went insane and lost her mind and she was an insane institution and the prophet of god went in there and he said you used to call me brother bill and we know that story and he said he had to go and catch her spirit because her spirit left her body but the problem of god went out and caught that spirit and brought it back to that young girl and with just a few minutes she was back in our right mind i'm going to declare it to you church he's the same god tonight and that same god can go to your child and catch that spirit and bring that spirit right back into that body and bring them into the manifestation of sons and daughters of god don't look at their situation don't look at their waywardness don't look at the chaos that surrounds their life look to the promise in the body of believers this evening there is healing brother ed you testify of a god that heals sister rachel you testify of a god that heals so in the in the body of believers this evening there is healing there is discernment there is deliverance to the captive there is liberty to those that are bruised and see what christ manifested in the alpha church we are to manifest in the omega church nothing more and absolutely nothing less the same word the same anointing the same signs the same wonders well brother joey that means we all got to speak in tongues that's a pentecostal doctrine i'm not saying that but don't when the holy spirit comes by and you feel moved to speak in tongues don't you stop the movement of the spirit many times we sat through a service and i have a i'll be honest with you he said to us i sit on the platform so all eyes are on us and man sometimes the spirit of god begins to move and i feel like running but like i can't run i'm on the platform i feel like dancing and there's times i let go and just dance in the spirit but we feel like we feel the movement of the spirit how many have ever felt the movement of the spirit and you just sit there and go on but we shall open ourselves up there's nothing to be ashamed of what happened is when this message moved on past pentecost azuza the ministry began to preach so hard against the movement the emotion and what they failed to realize is god was still there and then they just capped on the word the word the word the word the word the word to work until people sit there because all we're doing is just preaching an intellectual word we want a god with life in them look i want a message that's got life in it i want something that packs power i don't want to go to church and be put to sleep by some dry eyed man sitting up there just sharing this thought and that thought before you get it you trying to tie all these thoughts together and just don't know where in the world it ties at i've heard a man preach before back when i was first in the message and man he was he had a big name and he was so intellectual and man he came in and he did this and and i sat there like man i was better off not even coming to church that night he had me so messed up i'm thinking i don't even know where if i'm even a christian but give me a basic simple gospel where god becomes alive in a people when that word when they recognize this is who i am that god has called me as here to manifest himself that's what we're looking for tonight we're not looking for intellectual understanding god's not expecting you to be able to recite quotes and this that and the other of the church age book and the seven seals all you got to realize tonight is god doesn't change and god's the same yesterday and he's the same today and he's wanting you to do something about it he's wanting you to declare to this godless sinful generation that he's the same and he changes not that his word will not fail if you take god at his word heavens and earth will pass away but that word will become anointed and it'll come to life in your life notice now in the body of believers there's healing discernment deliverance deliverance to the captive set at liberty those that are bruised see christ doesn't change he's the same the brother of them will say this in the message possessing the enemy's gates in the church of the living god this morning lays the power to heal all sickness all sickness in the church of the living god lays the power to overcome all temptation don't tell me that there's a temptation that's bigger than you it may be bigger than you but it's not bigger than the god that we serve some of you young boys you struggle with pornography and you struggle with this and you struggle with that but i want you to know tonight i declare that jesus christ is ashamed today and he's bigger than your addiction he's bigger than your problem he can break that thing off of your life he's the same god i can testify i know what god has done in my life i've seen god come and break that yoke off of me and if he can do it for me he can do it for you not just for the young boys it's for some of us parents hiding behind a message hiding behind this and you got sin in your life it's time that we can become clean and let god move and move all the sin out of our lives in the church of the living god lays the power to overcome all temptation him the possession of the church of the living god this morning lays the power to change sin where sin had you chained now you can change sin and throw it away and you can receive the baptism of the holy ghost in the church of jesus christ where sin used to have you in bondage now you can take it and bind the head of the serpent oh my whatsoever you desire whatsoever you ask in my name he says i will give it to you see we find in mark 16 and verse 14 he said unto him go go into all the world and preach the gospel declare the gospel to every creature and he that believeth is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out devils been there and have done that because no evil spirit can stand before an anointed of god when the people are ready for deliverance brother baby said you can see the countenance on their face begin to change because that enemy knows he's about to be exposed and he has to leave we've been there we've done this the same god that cast out devils on the shores of galilee that walked through capernaum that walked the shores i walked the lands there he's the same god today he showed up the devil showed up brother craig and i at a youth meeting we had back a couple years back and there was a sister that came in and she had an evil spirit upon her and she began to move like a snake and just my goodness it would just put chills over you if you didn't know your position in the body and the me and brother craig faced off with this spirit and it took hours it wasn't something you just played with but we recognized we learned a lot sir sometimes you can't do it all in front of everybody because why because there's doubt here and there's confusion here and people don't understand the true word of god so we took this system with her husband and took her to a back room and began to work with her begin to deal with her and we found brother craig found the key that broke that yoke off of her and in a moment's time she began to look up she goes i see angels all around let me tell you church her eyes became off of this dimension and she began to look at another dimension she began to see jesus christ was real that jesus christ is the same he's the same today and this anointing that had her bound for so many years it broke off of her and she's free today she's never been back to that she's never been bound again because god's word is the same for you tonight as much as it was for the the the disciples in the book of acts notice in verse 19 so then after the lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven they sat on the right hand and they went forth and they preached everywhere notice the lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following not doctrines not ideas not great thoughts but signs if i came here last time i was here and told you that god's a healer and brother ed you came in that prayer line and you're still sick in the body down in your back and god didn't heal you sister rachel in the back there god didn't touch you different ones that came god wouldn't have manifested himself to you you can say well brother joe you're just pipe dreams and air castles but when god comes by and he becomes a reality and he fulfills what his word declares that he will do and he will do it because the people believe that he's going to do these things then you'll see a man who's been down 40 years with back issues be able to bend over put his shoes on and his socks on and be pain-free you'll see a daughter of god who's dealt with gluten problems and different issues for years and years and years who has sat through a service with stomach cramps and different things be completely set free and not be bound not be having any issues till this day i'm preaching to you about a living god i'm not talking to you about a historical artifact i'm not talking to you about a god that's in the history books i'm talking to you about a god that's the same today he's the same today these signs shall follow them that believe preach the gospel unto all the world and these signs shall follow them everywhere the same sign the same gospel we preach he goes we have tracts passed out all over the world but the gospel hasn't been preaching to a third of it yet the gospel is not just the word only but it's the word made manifest the power and the demonstration of the holy spirit bringing the word to pass now we know we can quote over and over and over and over that how do you know that a prophet is a prophet by when he prophesies anything if that word comes to pass then he's a vindicated prophet am i correct then how do you know that you're a believer oh my oh let me tell you how when signs follow your life you say oh brother joe i gotta have a quote well i got one for you i'm glad you asked because some of y'all were scared you're like well i ain't done this i ain't done that ain't nobody getting healed in my meeting or in my home and this that and the other and i ain't never spoke in tongues and we all we go automatically we go to our doubts because we're human but he says now after all we'll get to this quote that i'm going to get to you so i can help establish you in the present truth he says after all passing tracks is not preaching the gospel the gospel came not in word only paul said but through power and demonstration of the holy spirit not just teach the word that's where we fail we just taught it there's been no reality to it we just taught it now our kids grow up with a message theology our kids can out debate baptist preachers because they know the reality of a godhead but they only know it most only know it to a certain age intellectually but when that god it becomes a reality and that god becomes a personal god and when they see jesus christ the same there ain't no demon in hell can shake them from the other the power of the gospel of who christ is see not just teach the word but preach it make the man he says make manifest the word the word has to be made alive it's a dead letter until it's made manifest and then it's quickened and it's brought to pass what god said it will do he says that's the gospel in action the new testament christianity see the word itself is dead until it becomes into action and produces life tucson tabernacle don't you settle for an intellectual gospel don't you settle for me and i can stand behind this pulpit and put it all together but there's no anointing following that ministry don't you settle for that don't you settle for just a man who can be able to teach a great big lecture and have you spellbound by how you can put all these great greek words together and yet it leaves you empty don't settle for that no you want somebody that can make the word live somebody that can preach you to a point that can bring the mysteries together to say it's not only for the prophets it's not only for the ministry but it's for me the mysteries are for me this is who god is and this is who i am i know who i am because i know whose i am i know that i've been called i know i've been anointed i know i've been elected there ain't no devil can keep me and shake me off my ground because why because god has become a living reality not an empty theology not an empty word but he's a living god and he's manifesting in my home in my body in my school on my job in my church he's a living god today and he's asking what are you gonna do how are you gonna present this guy to the world by allowing the same word to flow out from your life that's how we manifest christ it's a say just like mary said lord i don't understand it oh you said that i'm gonna have a son not knowing a man but no matter what father and be it unto me according to your word let my life bring forth the promised son that should be our desire lord let me bring forth this promised word for this hour he said what good is it going to do you to read about a historical god if he isn't the same god today faith in action 1955 what good is it going to do you to read about a historical god if he's not the same god today what good is it going to do to read about old george washington if he's dead and gone see it's just a history fact but jesus raised from the dead and he's the same today what good is it to paint a fire to a freezing man oh come over here come by my beautiful portrait look at the flames they're so bright and yet you're still shivering you're still shaking but they want to present you oh this is what it used to be this is what the message used to be this is what the movement of the spirit used to be let me tell you church you can't get poor get get warmed by i used to be but i can here to tell you you can get excited by god today i tell the church don't you paint me a picture of no fire you start me at fire take that picture and put fire on it and let it begin to flare up that's what i want that's when it's going to warm the church that's what's going to excite the people is a living god a real fire the fire the holy ghost moving in the church moving in the people don't paint me a picture of what god did yesterday i want to see him today i want to see him manifest today i want to see when i lay hands upon the sea they shall be healed because it's not my word it's god's word and god is no better than his word try to get worn by pain and fire he says what we need today what we need is men and women who will stand up in the forefront and call the devil a liar oh mr devil that's how we act sometime we want to be so polite because we want to be christians right when the bible says the violent take it by force sometimes you just got to roll your sleeves up brother arnie take your jacket off cause you can't fight with a jacket on brother craig used to be a boxer i'd get him up here and display he'd float like a butterfly sting like a bee he only wishes he was muhammad ali but sometimes it's what it takes god your word is true and i see it in the reality by which you brought it and you got to stand there and you got to fight for every promise oh you going to get sucker punch because the prophet of god says satan's got a punch coming but i want you to know your god is bigger than your devil he's greater than your enemy says what good does it do to have a bird to have wings if he got him in a cage oh i got a beautiful parakeet he's beautiful and yet he can't fly nothing he's in a cage he says he can't fly he don't need no wings if you've got him in a cage he's he goes that's the way with a lot of these people i'm afraid that some of these churches has got our people in we're in cages they were destined brother branham would talk about that eagle he said it just gripped him he wanted to pay money to the zoo to let that bird out of that that cage he'd fly hit his head and fly and hit his head blood all down his head because he wasn't destined for the cage he was destined for the sky and let me tell you church you are too you're not bound by some man's idea has you caged up you can't go to this church you can't fellowship with this one and you got to believe this or you're not in the message that's hogwash that's a cage god's given us the skies to soar in this message is unlimited the greatest gift that god has done in this hour is to give us a vindicated message and this message has power this message has liberty it has healing it has deliverance it has everything that we have need of is in this message because this message is christ it's the anointing it's the word you take those men who used to preach this gospel and now they try to start their own little work outside of this as they left the message they don't have a ministry there's no anointing there they've tried because while the anointing rests in this word because this is not a prophet's word this is god's word to a generation this is god's word to a people this is god's word to an age it wasn't brother branham's word brother branham's ideas brother branham's doctrines this is christ's word christ ideas christ doctrine to christ's people to let you know that you're going to fly up into the heavenlies and can't no man hold you down because while he broke the prison bar when he said house of hell give way house of hell had to give way and it looks those that were captive they began shaking and popping and every one of them were set free i say oh tucson tabernacle let the winds of the spirit begin to flow through this place don't let some man crack you down and keep you crap down or crack down man i don't know the word i'm using here but keep you all beat down and keep you underneath your god-given privileges recognize who you are recognize that god has called you for liberation nothing can bind you nothing can hold you sickness can't hold you the oppression can't hold you anxiety can't hold you doubt can't hold you your past can't hold you god is here for you and he's setting you free yeah i love this word i know what it i know it works i know it works what good is your wings going to do you and what good is your faith going to do you if you can't turn it loose what good is your faith going to do you if you can't turn it loose when the spirit moves by your way and you feel like shouting and you don't what good is it gonna do you well i felt it but you didn't now i'm not trying to get all y'all to get emotional because i'm not trying to make you a bunch of little joe adams but i want you to know you're not in cages you're not in cages and the word is real and this holy ghost is real when they came out of that upper room they didn't come out of there with a dry confession they come staggering out like a bunch of drunks they knew they'd been in the presence of something greater than their humanity and i'm talking to you about a god that's greater than your humanity and when he comes by your way don't you be afraid to let go and give in to that anointing you know what we're worried that we're gonna be uh no church order out of order brother battle makes a statement he goes i'd rather have a little wildfire than no fire you know what happens with wildfire it may jump from here to over here from here to over here the least likely person while i would have never thought sister so-and-so would have done that because that's a little bit of wildfire jumping you know pentecostal jumping pews boom boom boom boom but he says never one time has i seen anybody get hurt never one time let me just say this if that was good enough for the prophet what about us what about us oh we're so afraid we don't want to be labeled pentecostal look i'd rather be called pentecostal than baptist and catholic you know sometimes even today you get the name message tacked on you and you got a bad name because the message can be only those that fellowship with jeff only those that fellowship over here are so many slanted ideas but we're eagles and what good is having these wings if we're not going to flex on the fly what good is believing in a living god if you're not if you're afraid to test his boundaries i ask god for big things i ask god for miracles i ask god to perform the supernatural you say bro joe you think you're a little bit bold to do that the prophet of god gave me a word he says look you asked for big things because big things is just as easy with god as little things big things you got a son you got a daughter out there in the world tattooed up drugs and whatever else and it looks like a big thing and you don't know how to pray ask god you ask god god won't disappoint you got to go after him we've seen god go get a hold of a little boy who was out in college and in drugs and different things like that because a little young sister came up for prayer and within 15 20 minutes comes staggering in that's asking god for big things i believe god blew her mind that night a matter of fact god blew all of our minds at night because we said yeah hey that's good prayer let's believe we're going to believe for it we had no expectation that god was going to do it right then but you know that reminds me it was in the bible peter was in the bible peter was bound peter was bound he was in prison he was going to be crucified the next day he was going to be executed but they begin to pray oh and here comes the angel of the lord come strolling by peter's sale hey peter oh boy how about we get up and leave this place because i'm the same today as i was yesterday oh and peter said whoa whoa whoa he began to walk past that one then he began to walk past that one then begin to walk past and then all of a sudden peter's on the street oh peter's mind was blown sometimes our minds are blown when we see god move when we see god do this and we see god do that and peter all of a sudden he's at the door knocking i think i can preach right now they were praying and they wasn't believing and sometimes that's what's wrong with us we pray this prayer because we really want it to come to pass but read down the heart we don't really believe but little damsel comes to the door who is it well it's peter it can't be peter peter you're in jail peter you're in bondage peter they got you they're gonna crucify you tomorrow she said he said it's peter i'm here she run back oh peter's at the door oh that's so foolish you young little girl how stupid of you to think that don't you know the days of miracles in this past don't you know god don't move like that don't you know god don't heal like that don't you know god don't speak in tongues anymore don't you know god don't do those things anymore she said yes he is he's at the front door peter came knocking on the front door and there came a one open the door well hey peter we just been praying for you sometimes that's how we are well hey god we really wanted this i really didn't believe it but you know what god does he does it he does it despite your unbelief because he's trying to anchor your faith that you can believe god in your lowest times when the devil has put out an all-out assault on your life and your family you can trust god you can believe god god has given you faith wings and levi's two son tabernacle i'd begin to flex those faith wings tonight and wednesday and sunday and every day that ends in y that happens to be every day just for y'all that didn't know that i'd begin to pray i began to believe god if you can do that for peter you can do that for me if you can do that for peter you can do that for his believers god send us a pastor god move upon the heart god move in this church let this place be turned upside down with the power of a living god we don't want just an intellectual understanding i don't want just a prophet hanging on the wall i want a prophet's message in my heart manifesting in my life i want the display of the signs and wonders i want a living god manifested in my life i got 35 minutes can i go he says that's the way it is today you might send your boys to seminary school teach them all kind of theology all about this and that and the other but if you're afraid to turn your faith loose to trust god what good does it do you to teach them what good church if shakespeare lived in me you would expect me to write some of the most beautiful poetry thankfully shakespeare don't live in me and i don't write poetry but if beethoven lived in you you would just expect you sit down with this beautiful grand piano never had touched it before just begin to softly play and all of a sudden the most beautiful melody flows out because beethoven is in your family maybe great-grandparents great-grandpa bay or papa beethoven you would expect these things because why because you know it's part of your family and if jesus christ is living in us shouldn't we expect to do the same thing shouldn't we oh my shouldn't we expect to see the supernatural because why because he's the same and it doesn't go back to your dna naturally but it's your dna supernatural the same anointing the same god the same spirit that was in him manifesting then is the same one that's here tonight manifesting in the hearts and lives of believers so if he's a living god then he's got to be a living god in you tonight he's got to be manifested somewhere now notice the word word is logos that's the word that was spoken by god but the word gospel is taking that same logos and putting it in action it's one thing for the logos to be the logos and never move from that anointing and always be the logos because it is but there's another thing when you take the logos this word and begin to put it in action it becomes the gospel it becomes that word that reality that truth begin to manifest in lives of frail humanity those that you discounted god says don't you discount them you looked at me 25 years ago you never gave me hope but thankfully my life didn't depend on what you thought about me or what others thought about you no because god had me and his thoughts see i was a thought a word and then he put that word into action and now you see signs and wonders following the ministry signs and wonders following the life let me just bring this to you he says what we need to do is turn our faith loose now i'm not asking you to act like a bunch of nuts sometimes i'm afraid that's what we we think about we're going to just be all crazy everybody's going to be jumping and shouting y'all seen the video on youtube where they got that man in that pentecostal church he's running around swinging his jacket he runs and jumps into the baptism nope that's not us i'm not asking to do that oh please heaven forbid us do that we would get a bad name but we want the gospel we want the word in action we want to see what good is your wings going to do you if you don't have faith or if you what good is your faith going to do you if you can't turn it loose see what good is your faith certainly if i believe jesus lives today that i'll put it in action if i believe jesus is alive today then i'll put it into action and that is faith in action 1955. so we want the gospel preached to us and the gospel the prophet of god says is the good news the good news is the bible but the bible is the letter and the letter kills but the spirit gives life so paul will say the gospel came not through word only but through power and manifestation of the spirit the only way that the gospel could be preached then will be to manifest the power of the holy spirit when he says now watch the next quotation when these signs shall follow them that believe not signs shall may or may follow them or ought to follow them but these signs shall follow them that believe and there's men today who are under the auspice of this message don't believe in altar calls they don't believe in prayer lines they don't believe in emotion they don't believe in speaking in tongues they don't believe in the movement of the holy spirit let me just say this how can you sell a product if you don't believe in it how can you sell the holy ghost how can you sell this message to your kids if you don't believe in it why does my kids serve the lord because they see it i believe in it brother craig's family serve the lord because why because he believes in it he knows what god's done in his life he's he recognizes that only god can take a man from where he was and to where he is today only god and so we preach it because we believe it doesn't mean that we're perfect absolutely not we're not perfect we make mistakes yeah we have to go and we have to go before our family we have to apologize i'm sorry i did this and i'm sorry i did that but yet we witness a living god we don't let down on the bars just because they're our kids we hold the banner high christ is risen this message works if it saved me and i saved my son if it saved me to save my daughters if it saved me to get me through the hard times it'll be with my family and let me tell you if he did it for me he can do it for you if he did it for me he can do it for you i know that so we find here that the signs will follow the believer but if you don't believe the prophet of god says you have spiritual amnesia he says now you are identified with that or you have got some spiritual amnesia he goes that you find out you don't believe those signs follow believers if you don't believe it then you have spiritual amnesia you've forgotten that god promised it how can they not believe in prayer lines because they've forgotten that god has promised it god has promised to heal the sick they've forgotten that god comes at an altar that god still moves at an altar god still answers prayer at an altar i was at a youth meeting several years ago at a church i wasn't preaching but i was there and i was operating and working and praying for some of the young people that was at the altar and the pastor of the church just began to stop it young girl over here about this point over here began to shout and scream she was beginning to break free and he'd come over there and stopped it and began to talk you don't have to act like that you don't have to get emotional all you got to do is accept it what good was those wings if he clipped him and wouldn't let her fly it's okay to have altar calls it's okay to have a stirring of the spirit let me just say it's okay to have a living god in our midst he may not come the way you're used to but maybe because you're not used to seeing god move but god's going to move anyway god's going to move despite you despite your unbelief despite anything of our fair humanity god's going to move because god's promise if there's one person here tonight that wants to see god move you will guess what god will move you may not see it you may not witness it but that heart will testify that god moved and god moved and god moved on me this service may not be for one person but i can tell you it'll be life-changing jesus christ is the same today what are you going to do spiritual amnesia he said this very message of the gospel itself is to prove to the people that he has risen and how can we prove that he has risen if there's no signs if there's no wonders if there's no tongues if there's no supernatural display of his presence of his being how are we going to tell this dying generation that he's alive if there's nothing to show them i'm not trying to make a spectacle out of god but i believe god displays himself in our frail humanity to show to this dying generation that he is in fact alive we've seen god at our church one miracle after another after another after another after another we've seen god i can preach to you because the reality that i've seen god move i've seen god cast out devils i've seen him not only at my hands but at brother craig's hands other ministers in our church we've seen it we've gone to battle and you know what the first time can i just be human for a minute i got a few more minutes don't i i got 25 minutes so i'm going to take my time how many of you are human tonight okay some of y'all back here you're not you ain't figured it out you're aliens but many times when we never experienced a supernatural our first first thing that we do is we go to our humanity right i remember the first time in a prayer line we had this sister come up and then we had we faced seven demonic spirits at night at a youth camp and not only that i mean if you never dealt with that brother aaron i mean first thing you're checking up man make sure your life is clean i mean you're doing a quick thorough inventory real quick because your first thought is am i ready for this can i do this is this dependent upon me but it's not but your life has to be clean you have to know that god has called you for that purpose but it wasn't until afterwards that we face one of the probably the most serious case was a young girl at our church when i spoke about this morning that had epilepsy but she not only had epilepsy she had a suicidal spirit and she had a couple other spirits and we began to pray and we went on for 45 minutes to an hour and we'd prayed and would speak to it we'd bind the serpent she tried to hit she couldn't hit us we tell it to stop speaking it would stop speaking but you have to recognize in your mind that your humanity is called into question but more so your spirituality you got to know that god has called you for that and i just remember the first time we faced that or first time that i faced that i couldn't help but think man what's going to happen here because i never seen it happen before but we learned a lot in that weekend we learned that god never fails i learned that he's the same truly the same yesterday today and forever but there and i've seen god heal i've laid my hands on people and i've seen them healed but i never once until that that weekend laid my hands on somebody and seen the devil leave but i can tell you today i'm not afraid to face one devil i faced him just here we had our easter meetings and brother danny steven and i were praying with this young girl and she came up she had a lustful spirit owner a pornography spirit of pornography and suicidal and we i began to pray me and brother dana begin to pray and she begins to fall back and the first thing that a spirit does will begin to fall and getting the scream out thinking that it's done okay i bluffed him i got him i said i've seen this happen too many times so i was like a bulldog i jumped on i didn't jump on her but i just went down and i began to pray and i began to rebuke that spirit because she made known what it was that had her bound and when she made it known it had to leave and i began to go down and begin to pray with her and when she come up she was a different person and she was just at our annual meetings and she was a different person you know once maybe a couple years ago i would have been timid because my humanity because i hadn't seen god move like that but i drew courage believing and seeing god manifest himself so you ask me what will you do brother joe i'm gonna display christ i'm going to do what the word says i'm going to lay hands on the sick and i'm going to expect god to heal him i'm going to lay hands on i'm going to expect the devil to leave because he can't hold you because god's promise is greater than any unbelief so that's just a little testimony that i've faced in my humanity and i understand we all face those moments but god is still god god is still god god is still god and we are to preach the gospel manifest a word and the gospel is the power of god to make the word act what it says it'll do brother branham was going to india and he landed in the indian as i started bringing this down he said there was a mess a methodist bishop and many of them came out to meet him and they said brother branham we've heard of these things we preached the word and we know more about theology perhaps than all you americans put together because the bible's an eastern book and he said that's right he says but we want to see someone anointed with the holy ghost that can make it live again and i believe that's what we want as believers tonight we want somebody that can make this world live again somebody that is not afraid to go toe-to-toe with the devil and proclaim that jesus christ is alive today see we want somebody that can produce what the bible says it will do otherwise we want to see the faith that was once delivered to the saints we want a young person that can believe this message in the same god that save mama and save daddy and fill them with the holy ghost is excuse me the same god that gets a hold of their life and rises them up above their humanity above the enticements of this world we want to see that we want to see god manifested in sons and daughters we want to see harmony in the church we want to see dissension left dissipated we want to see a people come together understanding that we are serving a living god so let's work in harmony one with another let's proclaim the glory of god oh we're going to have our differences as humans but let's put our differences aside let's put our bitterness aside let's put our unforgiveness aside we're too close to the coming of the lord to allow those things to hang us up they said in the message jehovah java bible says did the church members actually see him in that day he said no sir they never seen him in the light of who he was they seen him in his corporal body because they had a sense of sight those who could see they saw him in the light that he was a human being but they didn't see him in the light as a son of god and i'm afraid church sometimes we don't see each other in the light of what we really are we see each other in our humanity and you may not like my preaching you may think i'm too loud or i don't stay behind the pulpit long enough because other people come and they stand by i don't really care because see in our humanity there's gonna be things about me that let me just be honest i don't like and there may be things about you that i don't like but when it comes to us being sons and daughters of god we've got to look beyond the veil of humanity and look to the anointing god saw something in that sister to call her to this glorious message and if god can look past her failures or his failures and their mistakes why can't we why can't we if he's the same today then i ask you what are you going to do how are you going to bind together as a church who's in need of a pastor you can't do it bickering and fussing you got to do it by coming together looking beyond our frail humanity and looking to see what god has deposited on the inside of each of us inside of each and every one of you that's been born again of the holy spirit is eternal life god took a part of his own self and he placed it right there then he put a sign that says ah devil take your hands off you can't have them you can't hold them because why i've claimed them and if god can claim us then why shouldn't we claim ourselves you know i can't preach like brother craig man you want to talk about a theologian in the message but he's anointed theologian y'all need to get this man here to preach he should have just preached tonight made me up here working i'm so tired brother aaron was telling us at lunch you know how he preaches we're all different but we're all needful to the perfecting of the body not everybody can be a teacher i tried to teach i remember i was going to do a youth meeting and i started a youth meeting on the holy ghost i did seven parts on the holy ghost i only taught one and realized that ain't my calling them poor kids got a dose of the holy ghost in a way they never had it before i preached a holy ghost high and hell hot i remember one time before brother craig took his church up there i was doing church order they only had me do it one time i ain't never been back since i preached the brother told me says bro joe i never heard church order preach quite like that boy it had so much fire in the church i put the church in order because we're all different you're different get used to different accept your differences become a body a body of believers who are wanting to make a rapture who are going to make a rapture who are going to make a rapture and i'm in them with this musicians you can come brother brown was in i believe it was mexico and he was down there preaching there was a pastor down there and he had a little four-month-old little baby and the baby had cancer in its mouth you may have heard the story and i'm just i'm i'm going off to tuc it's in my notes but i'm just going to preach just for a few minutes here this baby's mouth was swollen up he had been cut he's four months old and the pastor found out that brother branham was in the air i think it was la concente or something of that nature it was mexico or somewhere in arizona it's some spanish name excuse me i don't know it i don't speak spanish you're okay with that right good uh and so he invited brother branham he asked brother brad if he would come and pray for his baby he says you know me being a pastor but yet this being my son maybe i'm weak in faith because we all at some points we get to those points when it's your family maybe your faith quite can't rise up to the challenge but you can have faith to believe for somebody else that's why we're a family that's why we have to come together that's why we come on a sunday night so we can draw strength as a family because you know what somebody else may be able to step in and use their faith and the message is perfect faith the prophet of god will say possibly maybe god can use my faith the faith that i have in his word to heal you is that right sister rachel that's testimony right back there because that's the very words i spoke to i said god can use my faith at the end of a service because i know his power i know his might i know his ability i know his word is true and she accepted god upon my faith and god did not disappoint have you had another issue completely healed this is some year later god's a healer church so we find this little baby jaws all cut up cancer in the jaws tongue swollen out they had to put a tracheotomy in the throat brother man would call it a whistle and drain the cancer out and the father came in and he said oh little ricky daddy's little ricky brother i'm saying when he said that he just had to grab the side of his bed just imagine if this was your little boy satan's trying to take his life at four months cancer just ravished his entire face he's got cut surgeries where they tried to remove the cancer to no avail his tongue swollen up to the top he can't breathe so they had to put a tracheotomy in his throat they put splints on his hand so he wouldn't pull the tubes out see if you could just enter into that hospital room with me right now and see this case and yet a prophet of god was standing there knowing his position and he would question god god how can you allow this surely this breaks your heart god of all mercy and compassion how can you let this little baby suffer because even brother branham had humanity that he had to deal with he said in a moment's time he goes now i know i'm standing behind the pulpit because if you've got to take me at my word he said there was a voice that spoke down to me and says you're waiting on me to do something but i'm waiting on you you've been waiting on me to do something and the prophet of god said could it be that this whole time that god is waiting on you to do something god is waiting on you to move god is waiting on you to call out god is waiting on you to ask ask for big things ask for big things he's a big god he's a big god brother bam said he began to pray for that little boy he said lord i put between this demon of cancer and this little child the holy spirit and he said he got up he didn't have anything left to say he was emotionally drained because he recognized his humanity he said but he left that room and just a few hours later he got a call brother the jaws came back normal the tongue came back normal and they was discharging the boy the very next day i'm here to tell you about a god we serve and some of you come this evening you got anxiety you got fears you're dealing with depression you're dealing with disappointments you're dealing with failures and you're waiting on god to do something but could it be that god is waiting on you tonight could it be that he's waiting on you to respond could it be that he's waiting on you to take him at his word tonight some of you here are maybe dealing with sickness in the body you know every day that i get up in the morning i recognize i'm not as young as i was the day before i asked my wife she got up and she's been talking about a back problem all morning she's all that bad oh that bed but god is waiting god is waiting on us church [Music] he gave us a word that says ask anything in my name and i'll grant it what's everything you desire when you pray if you can believe you can have whatsoever you ask ye can have whatsoever ye ask ask that your joy may be full ask over and over and over and over he's commissioned us to take that word and to ask cancer is not too big for our god it's finished it's finished last time i was here she was the last one and at the end of the service i didn't say hallelujah it's finished because she was the last one in line but i said hallelujah is finished because i knew god has settled it and it's still settled today because he's a living god you got a need this evening what are you going to do about it he's here he's proving himself time after time after time after time after time after time what more do we need to see church he's here he's here [Music] maybe a different body but he's here maybe a different delivery but he's here maybe a different method but he's here and you're waiting on god to heal god's waiting on you to ask you're waiting on god to deliver he's waiting on you to take him at his word that he's the same yesterday today and he's going to be the same god is going to meet you on monday morning tuesday morning he's going to be the same god that's going to walk with you in 2022 2023 and to these bodies take a rapture he's the same god so jesus christ is the same today tucson tabernacle what are you going to do about it i'll say let's believe [Music] let's believe for the supernatural let's believe for the miracles let's believe for the movement of the spirit it may go against everything you've ever worked taught but let's believe tonight that he's still god and if he's god then he'll honor his word father we just bow before you right now lord not sure how to close this meeting this evening but i feel that this is the right way lord if you'll just place your hands upon your neighbor and i want you to pray not just for yourself but pray for your neighbor this evening we're a church family we're a bride we're a body we're believers maybe your need is bigger than you and maybe your faith is not strong enough [Music] but maybe that person has got his hands laid on you right now gotta use their faith to give you the desire of your heart god i pray this evening in the audience of the church tonight in the audience of angels round about father that you're still god i thank you lord that this message is not just something that was preached in the 40s 50s and 60s but it's a message of today it's a god of now and god you see every believer that's here tonight every heart every need represented by that heart tonight father and maybe the situation looks impossible [Music] perhaps the situation is greater than they can even humanly comprehend for god we're not going to look at human comprehension or human ability we're going to turn our faith to the promise tonight lord we're going to look away we're going to look to jesus and we're going to take a step we're going to step in faith believing that the gospel the gospel is being preached jesus is being manifested the people are becoming the word made flesh and god you would tell us that if spirit feels son or daughter god when they can take this word they can place it upon their lips and it's the same as deity speaking i ask right now to every believer you speak your need to god and ask god and believe god god i meet that need tonight god you see my need [Music] lord you see my desire lord though i may be a preacher father yet that doesn't prohibit me for having needs in my body needs and my home needs and my job god i'm asking that you would move lord you know what we have need of as a family you know we have need of on the hospital god i'm asking you to meet the needs right now not only my needs but lord i'm openly declaring that i believe that you're able god you would tell me time and again lord it's not your responsibility to do the miraculous joe it's your responsibility to bring me two fishes and bring me five loaves and you place it into my hands and watch what i will do so father we as two tabernacle we bring the fishes and loaves to you tonight and we asked oh god that you would feed and that you would meet the needs of the believer you'd meet our knees tonight lord maybe those are struggling with anxiety fears depression guilt worries whatever it may be god may it all be gone right now maybe those that are dealing with sickness in their bodies may leave them right now lord in this atmosphere in this presence father for in this presence right now i feel you right here near and close and i'm asking lord that your word will begin to minister right

moment god that you could use us and you look beyond our humanities to bless your people may your people be blessed lord and god i believe tucson tabernacles in search for a pastor and i just want to pray with them tonight as a body god i truly believe as i've seen it time and again lord as i worked with the little group there in iowa and you sent brother isaiah brooks there to shepherd that flock they were waiting desiring lord of pastor ministry would cycle in and cycle out and cycle in and cycle out lord you begin to move on brother isaiah brooks lord to go and shepherd that church and lord he took the church and now the church is flourished under his ministry and we see the same cycle or the same situation there with brother craig and the church in connecticut how lord they had hungered and they'd cycle in ministry one after the other lord different styles different gifts different ministers come by lord and lord you call brother craig to come and be the shepherd to minister to the needs of those people and lord i believe that your is very much god for tucson tabernacle for the needs of the believer may they not settle for the current situation may they never settle for having a revolving door ministry lord but may their focus be god send us a pastor send us a shepherd lord send us one lord that we can go to and get godly counsel one that would bear my burdens and help me and pray with me during my times of weakness one that would marry my family bury my offspring or bring my dad one that would teach us the word one that would elevate our faith god you know who that person is and i asked tonight lord that you'd begin to move on that heart and move on the believers here tonight father that there will be a harmony within the church or just a unity between the believers here tonight they'll not settle lord but they're going to believe and today father may their faith be reunited may it be encouraged lord may they not give up or through the testimony of brother craig and his church may they receive strength lord for in due time father i believe you're moving i believe you're working i believe you have that man prepared and i just pray you'll continue to bless the believers here every ministry that would come through these doors and stand behind this desk may you use them to bring this church to a greater place to bring the people to another step of grace power up the ring of the ladder lord that they can experience a living god in a greater reality lord we ask these things tonight in faith we ask it believing lord and we ask it in jesus name amen amen god

you say brother and you don't know what i'm going through no i don't but i know a god who does the word of god tells us he was tempted and tried in every manner that is common to man hard to understand hard to believe that but he took on a body of flesh to be able to be touched by the feeling of your infirmities by the struggles by the battles by the fights that go on with within whatever it is and he overcame it and he says because i live you shall live also he's the same yesterday today and forever and i know sometimes we we we want to touch something we want to and god allows that to be somebody would lay hands on me somebody would would pray for me that's right but you could set your wings on the wind of faith and say lord that promise is mine i can have that sister hattie wright sitting at the end of the table there and brother branham just talking about those that miracle of the of the squirrels and she just said that is nothing but the truth and it pleased god so

touch you lord i'm going to take you for that problem oh but uh oh it's just that i'm older now so my body's failing now he's the same yesterday today and forever he can take a 90 year old man and a

yesterday today forever he'll do those things i've shared that testimony many times when my wife was going through and i'd hold her in my arms trembling from that nervousness and fear and i'd say lord put her to sleep and she'd literally fall asleep in my arms and one day she said it's just this roaring that's in my head that never stops and i reached over and i prayed for her and i said lord put a song in her heart she woke up that morning she says i don't know what it is but there's something in my heart a song coming out amen strange things that god does but he's the same yesterday amen there's nowhere in the scripture that said it's only that's for every believer anyone that they'll take god look at that centurion he stopped god by his faith but he says he says you don't have to come here and he said i have not found such faith let that be said of you today i have not found such faith let's believe that lord we thank you for your word it inspires us it it's it's alive it's
