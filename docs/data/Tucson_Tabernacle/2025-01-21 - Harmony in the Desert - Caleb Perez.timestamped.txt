[50:12] ready uh some of you were there last
[50:14] night got to hear Brother Nehemiah sing
[50:17] and hear him testify and it was
[50:18] wonderful I'd just like to tell the
[50:20] story about how we
[50:21] met um uh we've talked a little bit
[50:25] about brother Bobby and his his vision
[50:28] here for Harmony and all that he did
[50:30] over the years to get Harmony going well
[50:32] Katie and I were having lunch with
[50:34] brother Bobby on a Sunday
[50:36] afternoon and if you've ever had lunch
[50:39] with brother Bobby you know he just
[50:40] talks to
[50:41] everyone a lot the people serving him he
[50:45] he talks to him asks them what they do
[50:47] not just surface level he tries to get
[50:50] in deep conversation with everyone he
[50:52] sees people would walk by and he'd make
[50:54] eye contact and he'd just start talking
[50:56] to them so we were out in front of the
[50:58] restaurant it was cheddar over on
[51:00] Broadway and uh brother Nehemiah walked
[51:03] out and turned and it was like him and
[51:07] brother Bobby were best
[51:08] friends like they'd never they'd never
[51:11] seen each other never met and like in
[51:13] front of Cheddars I think we started
[51:15] singing and brother Nehemiah came to
[51:17] church here that night and since then
[51:20] he's been a wonderful friend and when
[51:23] when I when we talked with brother
[51:25] Daniel and heard we're doing Harmony I
[51:27] said we have to have brother Nehemiah
[51:28] come sing so he's got a couple songs for

[2:11:40] there's power in prayer and there is
[2:11:41] power in prayer and there's power in the
[2:11:43] word and there is power in the
[2:11:45] word but there is
[2:11:47] power in a
[2:11:49] song There's
[2:11:51] two men I'll tell a story there was two
[2:11:55] men their names were Paul and
[2:11:57] Silas Paul and Silas for they were
[2:12:01] preaching the
[2:12:03] gospel and they took them they beat
[2:12:07] them they beat him almost to
[2:12:10] death and then they they Paul and Silas
[2:12:12] wouldn't give up what they believed so
[2:12:15] they took them and they they took they
[2:12:17] they put their feet in stocks and their
[2:12:19] hands in stocks in ch s and they took
[2:12:22] them and put them all the way to the
[2:12:24] center of the
[2:12:25] prison not just on the on one cell but
[2:12:30] they took them and they put them all the
[2:12:31] way in the
[2:12:32] middle and there they are maybe in the
[2:12:35] dark Paul and Silas two brothers in the
[2:12:39] gospel as we are brothers and sisters in
[2:12:41] the gospel
[2:12:42] here loving the lord and there they are
[2:12:46] they're bruised they're
[2:12:49] beaten enchant
[2:12:52] s and what did they do they began to
[2:12:57] sing what songs did they sing let me see
[2:13:01] our
[2:13:10] list Winds of
[2:13:13] Faith Palms of
[2:13:16] Victory believe for it didn't I walk on
[2:13:20] the water water they start singing these
[2:13:23] songs praising the Lord and the Bible
[2:13:26] says that everyone in the prison they
[2:13:29] started
[2:13:30] listening all of the prisoners they
[2:13:32] started listening to Paul and Silas
[2:13:34] singing these songs and the Holy Spirit
[2:13:37] must have come in we know it came
[2:13:40] in because the Earth began to
[2:13:44] shake and the doors of the cells began
[2:13:47] to open up and the the chains that were
[2:13:50] on their feet and the chains were on
[2:13:51] their hands they all broke off because
[2:13:53] they were
[2:13:56] singing brother Nehemiah they were
[2:13:58] singing a
[2:13:59] song and they were
[2:14:01] praising all the stalks were off and all
[2:14:04] the doors of the cell were open the
[2:14:06] Jailer came and he sees he sees the
[2:14:08] doors are open and he sees and and all
[2:14:11] everything's loose and he takes his
[2:14:16] sword he puts it there and he's going to
[2:14:19] fall on his sword because he knew that
[2:14:22] he would surely be put to death for
[2:14:24] letting all of these prisoners
[2:14:27] escape and as he put that sword to his
[2:14:31] him his bosom he hears brother Paul cry
[2:14:36] out do yourself no harm brother stop
[2:14:40] we're all here all of us are here
[2:14:44] brother minnow it wasn't just Paul and
[2:14:45] Silas that were there these songs these
[2:14:48] are all criminals these are all
[2:14:50] prisoners and these songs converted
[2:14:52] everybody in the jail so they didn't
[2:14:54] leave imagine a prisoner the doors open
[2:14:57] they'd be out but they all
[2:15:00] stayed they all stayed and worshiped
[2:15:02] with Paul and
[2:15:03] Silas look at the power of a song it
[2:15:06] converted these Sinners that were in the
[2:15:08] jail and the Jailer looks and he says
[2:15:11] they're all
[2:15:12] here and what does he say the power of a
[2:15:16] song what does he
[2:15:18] say he said Brothers
[2:15:21] how can I be
[2:15:24] saved Paul looks at
[2:15:27] him and he says believe on the Lord
[2:15:32] Jesus
[2:15:33] Christ and he didn't just stop he says
[2:15:37] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and
[2:15:40] you and your
[2:15:43] family will be saved how wonderful all
[2:15:48] from a

[2:22:07] you also bless the
[2:22:09] food it's been such a blessing to be
[2:22:12] here with you these few
[2:22:14] days and I want to say something
[2:22:16] sometimes I say a little bit awkward so
[2:22:18] I hope you'll take it in the spirit it
[2:22:19] said in but a few years ago I met
[2:22:22] brother Daniel here in this church maybe
[2:22:25] two years ago I think when we had
[2:22:27] Harmony
[2:22:28] here and the growth I've seen as he's
[2:22:31] begin to relax in his
[2:22:34] ministry in his calling it was a new
[2:22:36] thing for you yeah and I've just seen
[2:22:39] such tremendous growth and I I hope you
[2:22:42] take that in the right Spirit of that
[2:22:44] that just seeing him relax in his
[2:22:46] ministry the the the comments and the
[2:22:48] way he's LED these these meetings has
[2:22:51] been just
[2:22:52] tremendous and there's another one
[2:22:54] standing behind me here are you there
[2:22:56] Joey I'm going to stop calling them Joey
[2:22:58] you know I think I think Joey is what
[2:23:01] Australians call a baby kangaroo they're
[2:23:03] Joys aren't
[2:23:05] they but you know this was one of my
[2:23:08] students wow you know and to see where
[2:23:12] God has taken him and allowed his life
[2:23:14] to Blossom you know when you have a
[2:23:16] student in grade six you have no idea
[2:23:18] what's there it's just all potential
[2:23:21] he was actually Joey then he was like a
[2:23:23] little kangaroo but but uh you know
[2:23:25] Josiah I'm just so thrilled to see where
[2:23:28] God has taken you and as I was listening
[2:23:31] to the young people singing all through
[2:23:33] these meetings and just seeing young
[2:23:35] people that um brother Caleb's daughter
[2:23:38] singing you know it's cool to be uncool
[2:23:41] just stand up and make a stand and says
[2:23:42] see all of you young people declaring
[2:23:45] your faith in God and living for God you
[2:23:49] know what I felt through the whole thing
[2:23:50] thing the future of the church is secure
[2:23:55] that's right come on because we've seen
[2:23:57] young people born again filled with the
[2:24:00] Holy Ghost and you know sometimes we
[2:24:02] worry what about the future I'm not
[2:24:03] worried about the future because I see a
[2:24:05] whole crop coming up that's just pushing
[2:24:08] forward pushing forward and you know
[2:24:11] those of us who are getting a little
[2:24:12] long on the tooth well we're just
[2:24:14] thanking God for that that this
[2:24:16] generation coming behind us and I'd like
[2:24:18] to do a little tradition brother men you
[2:24:20] would remember this years ago we never
[2:24:23] closed a meeting without singing I'll
[2:24:26] see you in the Rapture if we never meet
[2:24:29] again and brother brandham talked about
[2:24:30] you know the holy ghost moving over
[2:24:32] people and they would just not want to
[2:24:34] leave one another and they just hug and
[2:24:35] cry and if we never meet
[2:24:39] again on this Earth my precious friend
[2:24:42] we have a promise we're going to see you
