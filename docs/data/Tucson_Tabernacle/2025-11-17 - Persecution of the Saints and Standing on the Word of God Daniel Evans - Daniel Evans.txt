Let's go to the key of F. Bring all your needs to the altar. Bring all your needs. Bring all your needs to the Lord. He is so willing and aable to help you bring all your needs to the Lord. He is so willing and he is [singing] so willing and aable [singing] to help you. So bring all your [music] needs to the Lord. So will you tell you how willing he was. He took your place on the cross. &gt;&gt; That's how willing he was. He said, "They can't do it for themselves, so I'll go down in their place." The one without sin, the righteous one, the holy one, said, "I'll die for them. How much will you love him?" The greatest expression of love is how you treat others. That's how it's manifested. I would say, Lord, may each one of us draw closer to you and that in how we treat one another. So we do have one need for the mark Marriott had asked prayer for sister Bonnie. She's not feeling well and I know it's the season changes and it seems like the body has trouble that but he's still a healer. He's not any less today than he ever was. And he's not any more than he was in a sense because he's everything. It's how much will we let him grow in us. That's really what it is. We do have a praise also. Um from Sister Amelia, she says she had been sick, but today she's feeling well. So, how many testified to that? God's been good to me. &gt;&gt; You know, whether it was sick in in a physical sickness or a spiritual sickness and he reached out and restored you. So, let's just pray. Father, this this morning and we can call you Father because you are our father. We are your children. We're more than your children. We we're we're drawn close to you. We're we're your redeemed, Lord. You were willing to die for us. You were willing to suffer for us. You were willing to be bruised and broken and bleed for us, Lord. And you did it because you loved us. And that love has never changed. It doesn't waver, go up and down. It's [music] consistent. It's eternal, Lord. And therefore, we can rest on it this morning. Every hand that was raised in every heart and everyone that is listening in maybe couldn't be here today, Lord. May they just realize that you are more than able and willing, Lord, and they would cast all their cares upon you, Lord. And as we take up the offering, Lord, may we may be used, Lord, in your honor, in your glory, Lord. We ask it in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Go ahead and shake somebody's hand. I forgot. Is there Sunday school this morning? For the older young kids, there's Sunday school. Head to Sunday school now. Shake somebody's hand. Welcome them to church this morning. Amen. You can all have your seats. I just feel like praising the Lord this morning. You know, a worship song has nothing to do with me or you. A worship song is about how great God is. Amen. How great he is in our lives. Amen. [snorts] My troubled soul, why so weighed down? My troubled soul, why so weigh down? You weren't meant to bear this heavy load. Cast all your burdens upon the Lord. Because Jesus cares. He cares for you. Jesus cares. He cares for [singing] you. And all your worrying [singing] won't help you make it through. Cast all your burdens upon the Lord and trust again in the promise of his love. Let's sing. My anxious heart. My anxious heart. Why so upset? In troubled times, how you so easily [singing] forget.

Let's sing my anxious heart again. My anxious heart, why so upset in troubled times? How you so easily forget to cast all your burdens upon the [singing] Lord. Cuz Jesus cares. He cares for you. Jesus cares. He cares [singing] for you. and all your worrying won't help you make it through. Cast [music] all your burdens upon the Lord and trust again in the promise of [music] his love. Let me hear you sing it. And I will praise the mighty name of Jesus. Praise the Lord, the lifter of my [singing and music] head. Praise the rock of my salvation. and all my days are in his faith.

[music] All my days are in his faithful hand. Amen. Give the Lord a hand clap of praise this morning. He's wonderful. Daniel's going to sing a song, but before he comes up, let's sing worthy the lamb that was slain. Hear the cries of the shackled from the onset of time. But that's not the end of the story. That's not the end of the story because the lamb, the worthy lamb, took all of our sins upon himself. So there's nobody shackled anymore unless they choose to be. You have the right. You have the choice to be free this morning. Amen. Worthy the lamb that was slain. Hear the cries [singing] of the shackled from the onset of time. For the chains [singing] of defeat, there's no key. See the tears of the broken, the cries of the slave. Is there no one [singing] worthy to set us free? Then the crying was [music] still. Then the crying is still. As the chorus rings out, the shackle released from [singing] their chains. Oh, and thousands [singing] of voices are swelling [singing] the song. Worthy lamb that was slain. Sing it. Worthy. He's worthy. So worthy. Oh yes, he's worthy. The lamb [singing] that was slain. Sing that again. He's worthy. Oh yes, he's worthy. [singing] So worthy. Oh worthy. the lamb that was slain. Then all the archangels. Then all the archangels [singing] and the saints of all time holding their crowns in their [singing] hands. Oh, will fall down before him, joining [singing] the song. Worthy, worthy the lamb. Sing it. Worthy, oh Lord. You're worthy. Worthy, worthy. [singing] The lamb that was slain. Just [music] tell him this morning, Lord, you're worthy, worthy, worthy. the lamb that was slain. Praise the Lord. Daniel's going to sing a song this morning. It's good. My voice is just about ready to give out. Praise the Lord. Do you appreciate Daniel? Amen. In the eye [singing] of the storm, you remain in [music] control. In the middle of the war, [singing] you guard my soul. You alone are the anchor. When my [music and singing] sails are torn, your love surrounds me in the eye of the storm. When the solid ground is falling out from underneath my feet, between the black [music] skies and my red eyes, I can barely see. And when I'm feeling like I've been sold [singing] out by my friends and my family, I can feel the rain reminding me. In [music] the eye of the storm, you remain in control. In the middle of the war, you guard my soul. You alone are the anchor. When my sails are torn, your love surrounds me in the eye of the storm. When my hopes and dreams are far from me and I'm running out of faith, I see the future [singing] I picture slowly [music] fade away. And when the tears of pain and heartache [music] are pouring down my face, I find my peace in Jesus name. In [singing] the eye of the storm, you [music] remain in control. In the middle of the war, you guard [music] my soul. You alone are the anchor. When my sails [music] are torn, your love surrounds [singing] me. In the eye of the song, if we could stand this morning. In the eye of the storm, you remain in control. In the middle of the war, you guard [music] my soul. You alone are the [singing] anchor. And when my sails [music] are torn, your love [singing] surrounds me. In the eye of the storm. In the eye of the [singing] storm. You remain in control. In the middle [singing] of the war, you [music] guard my soul. You alone [singing] are the anchor. When my sails are torn, your love [music] surrounds me in the eye of the storm. &gt;&gt; I ask for that song this [snorts] morning. I feel like sometimes, especially this morning, that I am in the eye of the storm. Let's bow our heads. Lord God, we thank you, Lord. Thank you for your goodness to us and father your kindness and your mercies on us and Lord we pray that father we could always be found in your perfect will. &gt;&gt; Lord that we can walk in the light of this gospel and father that as you are the light in this world and then father you told us now you be the light of the world. Lord we pray that we can be the light of this in this dark world representing your gospel. Grant it. Father, we pray in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. You can be seated. God bless you. Sister Sarah, it took me about all of one minute to forget your daughter's name. I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; Michelle, God bless you, Michelle. Welcome. It's It's good to have you in service. Welcome. [applause] And then uh Sister Lily, it took me like five minutes to forget your mom's name. Sister Lily and Alice, welcome. God bless you, visitors. [applause] And if we have any other visitors, God bless you. Welcome. Hey, there's Brother Rome. Welcome. God, good to see you, brother Roman family. Haven't [applause and cheering] seen you in a while. They never clap for me. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Oh, go on. Uh, it's good to be It's good to be in the house of the Lord this morning. I asked Daniel to sing that song. It's something that it's a song that really means a lot to me and it it just kind of gives me strength and when I hear it, I I just kind of I get emotional because it uh we all go through storms. We all go through hardships. [snorts] I by the And have I not we've been going through the sermon on the mount and blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God. Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the sons of God. &gt;&gt; Blessed are the peacemakers because they shall be called the sons of God. Are there any sons of God? [snorts] Seriously, &gt;&gt; does anybody really believe what Jesus said? &gt;&gt; Does anybody, [snorts] &gt;&gt; you have heard that it's said of old, you shall not murder, and whosoever murders will be in danger of judgment. But I say to you that whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of judgment. And whosoever shall call his brother Raqqa, it's an insult, shall be in danger of counsel. But whoever says you fool shall be danger in danger of hell fire. Therefore, if you bring your gift to the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there before you go to the al before you go to the altar before the altar and go your way. First be reconciled to your brother and then come and give your gift. You should not even put money in the offering or pay your tithes with ought in your heart against someone &gt;&gt; is what Jesus that's how important it is that if we have something against someone we have to make it right before you can even serve God before you can even make an offering in the church. You have heard it said you shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy. But I say to you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those that hate you, and pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you, [applause] that you may be sons of your father in heaven. For he makes his son to rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and the unjust. Even God blesses his enemies. Even God blesses his enemies. &gt;&gt; He lets the rain fall on the just and the unjust. For if you love those who love you, what reward have you? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? And if you greet your brethren only, maybe those who aren't part of your denomination or your church? What do you more than others? Do not even the tax collectors do so. Therefore, you shall be perfect. Therefore you shall be perfect just as your father in heaven is perfect. What a statement going through the biatitudes and going through that first uh chapter five in Matthew. He says if you do this you'll be perfect as your father which is in heaven is perfect. &gt;&gt; We spent the last month on the words of Jesus there and I I I feel like has anyone really taken it seriously? Yes. &gt;&gt; Has anyone actually heard these things? These words, these are the words of the Messiah. &gt;&gt; This is God made flesh. This is our savior who will one day keep us out of hell. &gt;&gt; And sometimes we could care less what he said. Feels like it. My God put me here, friends. He places a shepherd over a body to look out for them. You fight off the wolves and you wolves, you take care of the flock until he returns, but that flock doesn't belong to the shepherd. He's hired to take care of all of these sheeps. It doesn't matter if it's Joe Miller, who I love dearly. It's like, "Oh, he's easy to take care of. I want to hang out with this sheep. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; or ah I'm not gonna say it. [laughter] I'm just kidding. Or somebody else. [laughter] It doesn't matter. I'm hired by God. It doesn't matter if we get along or we don't get along. My job here is to help you, is to serve you. and the concerning this situation with the gossip. Stop it in the name of the Lord Jesus. Don't do it anymore. Let it be completely wiped away. Don't allow it to come to you. Leave it alone. &gt;&gt; All right? [applause] Please, please, friends, stand strong and do what Jesus said. Many, many have said hurtful things to each other. Proverbs six, we we're better than that as a church. We are, let me tell you, when people come to this church, it needs to be love. And they need to see love, not necessarily for the new people. We want to love the new people. But when they come here, they need to see our love for each other. That's the main thing. That's what matters. That's what Jesus taught. You with me? &gt;&gt; Proverbs chapter 6 verse 16 says, "These six thing, these six things the Lord hates. Yay, seven, yes, seven are an abomination to him. A proud look, lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood, a heart that devises wicked plans, feet that are swift to running to evil, a false witness who speaks lies, and one who sws discord among brethren. Words of God. Really, there's no way that gossiping and talking about each other can ever be right. &gt;&gt; Never. I know it sometimes it makes you feel better. It makes you feel better about yourself, but it's wrong. And I'll tell you, I do want to tell a story, and this one because it doesn't involve uh people that are in this church. Sorry, my notes were are completely messed up because I just said when I was back there, I said, "Forget it." I uh I tried to move stuff around and I was all confused. So, I'm sometimes I'm I'm trying to flip through to try find my scriptures. So, what happened uh this what really got this going was I went to a ministers meeting last Saturday, not yesterday, uh the the Saturday previous. And it was good. I I enjoyed it. The uh the brothers that spoke were really really sweet. And then there came a attack on me and it was me personally. And it was at the end, the last minister, and he looked at me and he would he would say things that were things that he knew that I stood for and then he would stop and he would stare me down for an uncomfortable amount of time. You ever look at somebody in the face and you're not talking? It's awkward. You ever do it for like 30 seconds? It's really awkward. Joseph feels weird, huh? &gt;&gt; Zyra, that's what happened. It It was It was very very difficult. And what it was, the meaning of this whole thing. And and the the attack that came down on me was to say that you cannot understand this Bible. You cannot preach out of this Bible without quoting brother Brandham. You need Brother Brandham to understand this word. I said, "No." And I mean, I didn't say anything. as you as you he would stop and he he would make make fun make a a funny remark and then the people in the back would rah and finally at the end I said these words after it was over I'm not going to cause a disturbance of course after it was over he said uh he came over to greet me and I said brother I love you I appreciate you but I didn't I didn't agree with what you said between him and me while I was there and the clause came out and the whole thing was that you're you're a critic telling me that I am I'm not a believer telling me that I'm anointed with the devil telling me that because um I say that I h I can understand the Bible that I am against brother Brham or against the message or any any of that stuff. And and it was just it was one thing after the next after the next. And the only really I couldn't really get in a word, but the only word that I could get in was the same God that wrote this Bible from Genesis to the re to Revelation. The same Holy Spirit that anointed those people is the same Holy Spirit that can anoint me to preach from the same word. &gt;&gt; And then and I don't need to read a quote. I don't need to do those things. And then it came out again. You need to tell your people. You need to tell your congregation how you believe. &gt;&gt; Now you know. &gt;&gt; No, that's I just did. But they were they were accu he was accusing me of this. And friends, this spirit is real. And this spirit is nothing new. &gt;&gt; This is an attacking, hateful spirit. John Hus. Anybody know who John Hus was? Hundreds and hundreds of year of years ago. He was burned at the stake for the Catholic Church for what? Saying that the common people should have a Bible. Saying that saying that the common people should be able to that the common people can understand the word. John Wickliffe, his body was exumed out of the grave, burned and thrown into the river, excommunicated after he's dead as a sign of disrespect. Why? because he wanted the people to have a Bible. And he translated the Latin Vulgate, which by the way, the original the the Catholic Bible, the Latin Vulgate, you know why it was written Latin? Because nobody spoke Latin, only the educated people. John, all he had, Mr. Wickliff, all he had was that Latin Vulgate. He took it and he translated into English for the people. excommunicated his ashes thrown into the river. Martin Luther translated the Bible into German. He had the Protestant belief of solar scriptor, the belief that scripture alone is the supreme authority in all matters. The salvation and that salvation comes from faith in Christ alone and not from church authority. Martin Luther. &gt;&gt; This drove the Protestant, this started the Protestant reformation. And the Catholic Church, what did they do? They excommunicated him. William Tendale, the leader of the Protestant Reformation about the same time as Martin Luther. He started the Reformation in England. He translated the Bible from the original Greek and Hebrew text for the first time in history into English. William Tenddale is one of my favorite people that's ever lived. The King James Bible that we read right now came as a result of William Tendale. They took his manuscripts, his Bible, and the words are 83% the same in the New Testament and 76% the same in the Old Testament as Tendale's original Bible. It was excellent. He was tried for Lutheran heresy and burned at the stake for teaching that a common man could read and understand the Bible just as well as the priests. Solah scriptor. The Bible is the absolute. &gt;&gt; Think of this. This spirit over 150 million all the way up to 168 million. One one stat that I found people were murdered because they said that you can understand the Bible yourself. You can read it and you can understand it. You don't need somebody to teach it to you. Murderedund over 150 million. Can you believe? And here is the same spirit saying, "You can't do it. Pastor, you need to confess to your people that you think that you can understand the Bible without brother Brandham teaching you." And then if I say no, the Holy Spirit, same Holy Spirit was on brother Brandham can anoint me to read this Bible and to teach my congregation. You hate Brother Brandham. You're against him. You're against the message. No, that's a lie. That's false. But do you see the same spirit that would put somebody burn them at the stake because they said no. Joe the common man can take this Bible he can read it and he can understand is that same spirit friends that's in today and that spirit crept in to the church sister Elizabeth you remember telling you remember telling me that something happened something was wrong that's what it was was here and it's this spirit of You have to have something else. You have to have Jesus plus something else. That is false. That is that it's it's completely wrong. And it's it's not that they don't like me. I mean, nice guy, good looking, cool beard. It's not that nice haircut. Manny says it's not that they don't like me. They hate what I stand for. &gt;&gt; Even a Christian, these people, 150 million Christians that were put to death were put to death by other Christians. And that hated, that hatred spirit is still here. Friends, let me tell you something. If you never get anything from me, open your Bible and read it. And if you don't understand it, get on your knees and pray &gt;&gt; and ask the Lord and he will reveal it to you. &gt;&gt; Yes, listen to the prophet. Yes, do do um live live right and and do the good things. Yes, do those things. But if somebody tells you you have to have something else, that is a false doctrine that John Hus, John Wickliffe, Martin Luther, um, uh, William Tendale, Brother Brandham, they all stood against it. It is a false doctrine &gt;&gt; that and it what it is it's it's the name of Jesus and it's always hated that that name is hated. They may not say it. My brother Adam talked to him yesterday and he said, "Hey, I want to give you testimony." So he was he was teaching Bible study. This kid shows up. I think he was like 10 years old. He shows up to the to the Bible study and he said, "Adam's like, man, we had all kinds of people there." And this little guy, he liked it. He never been to church before in his life, you know, rough poor kid inner city. And so afterwards, Adam goes up to him and he talks to him and the kid says, "Hey, can you buy me a McDonald's?" I was like, "Yeah, okay, whatever. Come on, let's go." And they go across the street to McDonald's and he's gets a McFlurry. I think Adam said something else. And and the boy looked at Adam and he said, "Uh, you're a preacher." He said, "When I grow up, I want to be a preacher." And Adam said, "Why?" He said, "Because I want to change the world." And and Adam said, "Really?" And you know that they tell the kids in school, you can do anything that you want. you can be a president of the United States. You can change the world. You can do anything. And they pump you up. And then Adam says, so this kid's used to hearing that all the time. Adam says to him, he says, "You can't change the world." And the kid's like, "I haven't heard that one before." And Adam said, "But I can introduce to you to someone who can." &gt;&gt; And he talked to him about the Lord. I talked to a lady a couple days ago, your mom, Phillip, and trying to help her get into a house and uh she was telling me some stuff uh about their needs and she knew I was a pastor and she told me, she said, "We've been trying to serve God and she talked about her mom and we talked about the Lord a little bit and when I mentioned the name of Jesus, I just told her, I said, "Jesus cares on the phone." She broke down and it was the sweetest thing. And it was that name. There is something about that name that just it brings out it brings out love. It brings out it brings out emotion because it's a powerful name. There's no other name. It's the name of Jesus Christ and him alone. And it brings such a a response. I was witnessing to a lady when I was in Louisville and she was right next door to where we were going to have the event and I went over to her and I said, "Hey, how's it going? We're going to have an event over here." She's like, "Oh, okay, good." And uh she wasn't doing much. She was just feeding the dog or um out in her backyard. And I said, "Uh, hey, can I tell you a story about Jesus?" And she says, "I don't want to hear it." She says, "I don't want to hear that." He says, she says, I I don't you just be quiet. You just go and do your way. It that name brought up an emotion in her. It always does because it's God's name. The Muslims, they believe that Jesus was born of a virgin. And they call him one of the greatest prophets in history. The Muslims do. But the religious ones will kill someone who claims to believe in Christ. Why is that? In 2015, 20 migrant workers from Egypt were taken captive by ISIS while they were working in the country of Libya. Is ISIS released a propaganda video titled a message signed with blood to the nations to the nation of the cross. The video showed the men in orange jumpsuits paraded along a beach and then beheaded one by one. As they were killed, many cried out. Many cried out, "Yabasu, oh Lord Jesus." What is it about that name that this group over here would claim Jesus and yet hate this group over here that also claims Jesus so much that they would kill them? It's what is it about that name? It is Satan's goal to have your eyes on anything other than Jesus Christ. Anything. Me, mom, dad, brother Brandham, Brother Green, anyone to put that person between you and Jesus is Satan's goal, not transfiguration. Let's let's get into the scriptures. um Luke chapter 9 verse 28 and it reads like this. And it came to pass about and 8 days after these sayings, he took Peter and J and John and James and went up unto a mountain to pray. And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raignment was white. and his reignment was white and glistening. And behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses and Elias, who appeared in glory, and spake of his deceased, which he should accomplish at Jerusalem. But Peter and they that were with him were very were heavy with with sleep. And when they were awake, they saw his glory and the two men that stood with him. Can you imagine if you saw that Jesus shining and two men who you somehow recognized as Moses and Elijah. And it came to pass as they departed from him, Peter said unto Jesus, "Master, it is good for us to be here, and let us make three tabernacles, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias." Not knowing what he said. Elijah, one of the most obedient and dedicated prophets in the whole Bible, Moses, probably the most powerful prophet that has ever lived. Lord, let's make three tabernacles. Let's honor these two prophets and let's honor you. Jesus didn't have to stand for himself on this one. And while he yet he thus spake, there came a cloud and overshadowed them. And they feared as they entered into the cloud. And there came a voice out of the cloud saying, "This is my beloved son. hear him. &gt;&gt; No, not these other ones. They pointed to him. &gt;&gt; And when the voice was passed, Jesus was found alone. And they kept it close and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen. Peter wanted to honor all three of them. He wanted to give honor to Moses. He wanted to give honor to Elijah. And both are both are actually prophesied to return in Revelation 11. But God is warning on all of us. Don't focus on those two men right there. As plain as you can read it in the scriptures, don't focus on them. Focus on Christ. Jesus is different than anyone else. the apostles and prophets, evangelists, pastors, teachers, they should focus every word on him as do all the sermons really in the New Testament. Everyone is focused on one man. I um I want to um explain this a little further. Moses, come here. Help me for a minute. Come on up. buddy right here. Could you stand right here? Could you hold that picture of Jesus up? Good job. He said, "Thank you. You, too, friends. Here's a prophet of God." All right. this prophet, this Christian, this pastor, whatever it might be, his job is to point to this person. And if you put it in front here, that is the best Christian in the world that you don't see. You don't see me, you just look right through me to Jesus. &gt;&gt; That is what they've all done. That is the greatest thing. But we [snorts] will. We will take things. No, you need to look at you need to look at these things first. And do you see it obscures it obscures that that man? And then well, I'm going to do I'm going put some more stuff here. And you have to look through this stuff. You have to look all through all of this before you can see him. Do you see all of this stuff? It obscures Jesus. The best servant [snorts] is as clear of a glass as you can be. That is the best servant. Now you and I, we wake up in the morning and we say, "I want to be a Christian. I want to I want to serve God. I wanna I I I want I want to point people to Christ. And then you drink some alcohol. And then over here you lose your temper. And then over here you want to lift yourself up maybe on social media. And all of this obscures that picture, that man. And that is what we should be, friends. We should not be, none of this stuff should be going on in our lives. The cleaner that this slate is, the more that people will see that man through us. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, brother Moses. &gt;&gt; I will take that. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; All of our many of our doctrines, many of the things that that we say, does it put a mark in front of Jesus? As I said, lose your temper a little bit, pass on a message, write a little bit of a criticism, it it obscures this man. The best servant of God is the one that that glass is completely clear. and criticism that we receive. It should be because we stand for Christ. I have a few minutes left. I want to talk about this man, Stephen. Stephen was a deacon and he was a uh a real man of God in the book of Acts. I believe they had seven deacons. And Stephen was probably the most famous of all of them. And let's go to Acts chapter 6:8. And we'll close with this. And Steven full of faith and power did great wonders and sign among the people. And there arose some from what is called the synagogue of the freed men, the Sirenes, Alexandrians, and those from Celicia and Asia, disputing with Stephen. and they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spoke. Then they secretly induced men to say, "We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and against God." And they stirred up the people and the elders and the scribes, and they came upon him and seized him and brought him out, brought him to the council. And they also set up false witnesses who said, "This man does not cease to speak blasphemous words against this holy place and the law. For we have heard him say that Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and change the customs which Moses delivered to us." And all who sat in the council, looking steadfastly at him, saw his face as it was the face of an angel. So the glass in this deacon was pretty clear. They weren't seeing Stephen there. They were seeing what was behind him. Then the high priest said, "Are these things so?" So then Stephen goes on to preach really one of the best sermons that are in in the entire Bible. He goes back through history. He shows Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and Joseph and and he he it takes all of their ministries for and shows that they were for one collective purpose. And then Stephen gets to Moses who they just accused him of not believing. And he says Moses was beautiful in God's sight, mighty in his words and deeds. And he supposed the people would understand this but they didn't understand. Verse number 37, Stephen says this. This is that Moses who said to the children of Israel, "The Lord your God will raise up you a prophet like me from your brethren. Him you shall hear." He's saying that this one that Moses Moses spoke of this one. This one, this is he who was in the congregation in the wilderness with the angel who spoke him spoke to him on Mount Si and with our fathers the one who received the living oracles to give to us whom our fathers would not obey but rejected and in their hearts they turned back to Egypt. So he's speaking to the same people who kept every law of Moses and he and and then they put Moses forward instead of this man. And then a little later Stephen says this verse number 51. You stiff neck and uncircumcised in the heart and ears. So it's okay to stand up. You always resist the Holy Spirit as your fathers did. So do you. Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute? and they killed those who were foretold who foretold the coming of the just one of whom you now have become the betrayers and murderers who have received the law by the direction of the angels and have not kept it. Then when they heard these things they were cut to the heart and they nashed at him with their teeth. You see what the name of Jesus produces? and they nashed at him with their teeth. But he being full of the Holy Spirit gazed into heaven and saw g the glory of God and Jesus standing at the right hand of God and said, "Look, I see the heavens open and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God." Now watch what pointing to Jesus does. Then they cried out with a loud voice and stopped their ears and ran at him with one accord. And they cast him out of the city, and they stoned him. And the witnesses laid down their clothes at the feet of a young man named Saul. And they stoned Steven as he was calling on God and saying, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit." Then he knelt down and cried out with a loud voice, "Lord, do not charge them with this sin." And when he had said this, he fell asleep. And the musicians can come. Do you see what? On one side, the name of Jesus and preaching Christ studs, it produces hatred and it produces persecution. But on the other side, what does it produce? It produces love. It produces patience to the point where Stephen said the same thing that Jesus said when he was on the cross. Stephen, as I said, was a deacon. He had a wife. He had children. You didn't see Stephen crying out that the Lord would pro protect his wife after he died. You didn't see him crying out that he would that the Lord would protect his children. He was crying out that the Lord would have mercy on those that were killing him. That's the spirit of Christ. It's Jesus in the biatitudes talking about these preaching these things that he preached. It didn't sound right, but it produces this same spirit that this man Stephen had. Friends, do you see why it's so important for me that you can read this Bible and that you can understand it and that you can put your confidence in it and take these words of Jesus as we preach on as I preach on this sermon on the mount and the things that he said and apply them to your life because that's what's real. and then all of the other stuff. That doesn't mean that you or I are against anyone. Stephen wasn't even against the ones that were murdering him. He prayed for them. But this spirit of Christ, it produces love and it produces acceptance and it condemns the gossip and the hatred and the problems that are in the church. takes it out of your life to where you we could be like this man Steven. Can you imagine? They said they condemned him. They said you blasphemed Moses, somebody Stephen loved. He his sermon, most of his sermon was about Moses. He had the big bigger part of the of the sermon more than anyone else. And then they they tried to they did kill him because he said Moses that Jesus was higher than Moses. And it produced this hatred. It produced a killing spirit. Do you see how it was in the in the dark ages about how these men, they said, "No, you can have the Bible. You can understand it." They weren't against anyone. They were saying that you need to have it. You need to accept this man Jesus Christ. They were crying out and what happened? They were burned at the stake. Heads were cut off. And it's the same spirit that we see now. And it is so common saying you need something else to be in front of that man. What this should be is this should just magnify that man. That's a true servant of God. Not saying that you need anyone else. Not saying that you have to believe in a certain way other than Jesus Christ is your savior. And then as you believe that you'll get it. [applause] Those doctrines will come and then you'll see, oh wow, I shouldn't have cut that guy off in traffic. I just broke what Jesus said. you'll see that I shouldn't have said that about that sister. He said, "Don't say nothing. Go straight to that straight to her first before you tell anyone." Imagine if we did that. We would there would be so few problems in the world. If I had a problem with one of you and I just went straight to you and I try to do that and then it just set at ease and it's like, "Oh, I was wrong. I I I had this all made up in my mind. And then you go to that person, that person says, "Oh, no. You know, I shouldn't have said that. I I'm sorry. Oh, okay. It's it's gone." And the good thing is I never told anybody. It's just between me and that person. Jesus was so wise. Instead of getting on the phone and firing out all of these these these accusations and all of this, just go to that person. If that would have happened, then the church wouldn't have been in the mess that it's been in the past week. But now it's over. It's over with me. I'm I'm grateful to God for for a manual that I can follow and handle every single situation, right? &gt;&gt; Everyone. &gt;&gt; If I would just if I would just give in, if I would just surrender to this You know what this is? In the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God. &gt;&gt; And then the word was made flesh and dwelt among us. &gt;&gt; You don't need anything else. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; And here I am. I'm not being a hypocrite. I'm preaching to you because I want I want to point you to him. I want you to get to him. &gt;&gt; That doesn't mean that we shouldn't have preachers. It doesn't mean that we shouldn't have prophets to set us straight. It doesn't mean that by the grace of God, we have that. But don't let it obscure that man. Are you with me? Are &gt;&gt; we together? Praise God. Brother Josiah, &gt;&gt; what a friend we have in Jesus. All our sins and griefs to bear. Oh, what a privilege to carry everything to God [singing] in prayer. Oh, what peace. Oh, what peace we often forfeare. Oh, what needless pain we [singing] bear. Oh, because [singing] we do not care to God in pray. &gt;&gt; Friends, today can we all be together? Can we all do this right here and just clean it off? You know what that's called? That's called repentance. Cleaning it off. So then once you get that thing really clean, got to be perfect, man. I want this thing to not have a spot on it. Yeah. Right there. This is me. This is what I want to be. And then you can see right through that at that man, Jesus Christ. Can we do that? [applause] Really do it. Let's repent. Say, "Lord, I'm sorry. I've done wrong here. This I got this black mark and this red mark and this green mark. I'm gonna wipe all of this off and then I want to be that glass that you can see that everybody can see right through and see that man Jesus. Amen. Let's all stand. Have we trials and temptations? Is there trouble anywhere? [singing] We should [singing] never be discouraged. Take it to the Lord in prayer. Can we find a friend so faithful? Who will all our sorrow share? Jesus knows our prerequised [music] midst. Thou would all our burdens. Thou wilt all our burdens bear. May we ever Lord be bringing. May [singing] we ever Lord be bring. All to thee in earnest prayer. all to thee [singing] in earnest prayer. Let's sing. What a friend we have in Jesus. Oh, what a friend we have in Jesus. All our sins and griefs to bear. Oh, what a privilege to carry everything to God in prayer. Apologies for jumping around. Not really a really concise sermon. I had everything lined out and this is what I'm going to say and I'm going to set this right and uh I just totally chickenened out. You know why? Because friends, we are together. &gt;&gt; We're a family. &gt;&gt; We love each other. We stand with each other and even if one of us gets out of line, we stand with that person too. Amen. &gt;&gt; We are a church and I believe that we are an example of what a church should be because of the love that we have for one another. It's above everything that love that we have. It is it's beautiful. &gt;&gt; As I started this morning, don't get defensive. Don't don't do it. It'll it'll make you fail. And it is. I have to fall in my face all the time. And I'm glad that that I am able to fall in my face, but I want to stop doing it so much. Amen. Friends, can you wipe the glass off this morning? &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads. Father, we thankful. We're thankful for your goodness and thankful for the love that we have here. And Lord, forgive us. Every one of us that are here, forgive us for saying things that we shouldn't say. And Lord, maybe even having thoughts that we shouldn't have. We ask your forgiveness, Father. And Lord, may the love of Jesus Christ just swell within us and bring us together. And Lord, we're just grateful. We're thankful that we also have coming this week, Lord, a a church dedication, rededication. Lord, it was founded 60 years ago. Father, we want to stand strong and continue this on. You You've blessed this church over those 60 years. You've blessed it so greatly. And Lord, now we we want those blessings. We want a revival. Lord, we've seen it over the years now. Lord, give us a revival here at Tucson Tabernacle. Lord, give us the love of Christ. Let it come down and let it be, Father. Let it be greater now than it's ever been. Yes, &gt;&gt; we pray. Lord, bless this week as we prepare for the the weekend meetings next week. And father that we ask that your hand would be upon each one. Lord may healing be within our congregation. I pray we love you. We thank you in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
