[20:47] years old
[20:49] and the minister said it's your change
[20:51] of life that you're going through and
[20:53] sometimes we look at ourselves and we
[20:55] say what's wrong with us what's going on
[20:58] in life why this

[21:13] different atmosphere it was just
[21:16] wonderful to see God come and do that in
[21:19] the Simplicity of Truth
[21:21] and it's just sometimes you look at

[21:24] going on say Lord is it a change of time

[30:26] broadcast this morning that it was it
[30:28] was a tragic thing that happened
[30:31] um
[30:32] it was uh this man he's 37 years old he
[30:36] had had problems in his life and
[30:39] and it was pretty amazing that he had
[30:41] just gotten his life back together
[30:45] and he was really doing well and he
[30:47] really never in his whole life he really
[30:49] never had Direction he really he had
[30:51] never just had it together
[30:54] and he he had gotten his life together
[30:57] things were moving in the right
[30:59] direction and he was in Florida
[31:02] his grandmother was here in Tucson and
[31:06] he wanted to
[31:07] um surprise his grandmother for her 90th
[31:11] birthday
[31:13] and he set out and in Louisiana he was
[31:18] in a car wreck with a tractor-trailer
[31:21] and he died
[31:23] and um
[31:24] I did the funeral yesterday and then we
[31:27] had
[31:28] um the group over here in the fellowship
[31:32] hall and I know it meant a lot to them
[31:33] they didn't they didn't have a way to do
[31:35] it
[31:36] and for us to provide that for them I um
[31:40] I know that they appreciated and
[31:43] brother Jonathan when
[31:45] when you're ministering and you've done
[31:47] this many times in different places
[31:50] you can feel that there's some that
[31:53] they're real Christians
[31:56] and then you feel there's some that
[31:59] they're they're just kind of wishy-washy
[32:02] they claim to be Christians and then
[32:04] there's some that they don't want
[32:06] anything to do with it
[32:08] and yesterday was
[32:11] it was a difficult time brother Leo and
[32:14] I were there and
[32:16] it was um and then the special thanks
[32:18] also to brother Joe and Brother David
[32:20] and those that attended
[32:23] um
[32:24] it was hard
[32:27] to minister
[32:29] and there was people there that just
[32:31] didn't care they didn't really want to
[32:33] hear it
[32:35] and uh then there was some pure golden
[32:40] people also I got to tell you that uh
[32:43] her name is Rosalinda
[32:45] she's um
[32:47] with the for the Micah
[32:50] um
[32:51] Marriott
[32:53] I'll tell you what that young sister is
[32:56] precious what a sweetheart and she was
[33:01] telling me she says I just want I want
[33:04] my family and I want I want them to
[33:06] really accept the Lord Jesus
[33:08] and I just I mean she just impressed me
[33:11] so much and many of the family members
[33:14] did
[33:16] um
[33:17] and reaching out and helping these
[33:20] people
[33:21] I really appreciate the Tabernacle I
[33:24] really appreciate what we stand for
[33:26] sister Rachel was telling me she said
[33:29] that we've we've done this for the
[33:32] people a lot because we have
[33:35] she didn't say it exactly exactly this
[33:38] way but we have so much
[33:41] and we are able to share it with other
[33:44] people
[33:45] and I do appreciate that and I
[33:47] appreciate the attitude of the
[33:50] Tabernacle but I and in reaching out and
[33:53] always we're inviting people to church
[33:55] and and and the church is growing and
[33:58] we're seeing people really we're hearing
[34:00] great testimonies but let's not let's
[34:03] not forget each other
[34:05] let's not forget the people that are in
[34:07] this church that are these solid
[34:10] Warriors for Christ that love the Lord
[34:14] that are living the life let's not
[34:16] forget these people amen
[34:19] I am I just after last night I couldn't
[34:23] sleep last night I
[34:24] I was bothered
[34:27] but I'll tell you what gave me Comfort
[34:29] was thinking about
[34:31] the people that are solid they love the
[34:34] Lord and they're standing on this gospel
[34:36] really
[34:38] really really encouragement this Sunday
[34:42] brother Ellie easer
[34:44] and we've had him speak a couple times I
[34:46] just think the world of that young man
[34:48] so he's he's going to be preaching on
[34:50] Sunday morning I know that it's going to
[34:53] be a special blessing he's um he's
[34:55] special to me I've known him for a long
[34:57] time and I'm looking forward to it as
[35:00] much as you are to hear our brother
[35:01] speak and then in praying about it today
[35:04] I will probably preach on Sunday evening
[35:08] and I will probably preach on the second
[35:11] half of what I'm going to minister on
[35:13] tonight Acts chapter 20 but it'll
[35:16] probably be a little bit different
[35:17] because Acts chapter 20 the second half
[35:20] of it you really gotta preach it and not
[35:23] necessarily teach it there's a place for
[35:26] both
[35:27] you know there's you can run around and
[35:29] do jumping jacks in the pulpit and
[35:31] holler and yelling and that's and that's
[35:33] good and that that gets the blood going
[35:35] this way but don't forget there's also a
[35:37] Teaching Ministry we have to understand
[35:41] what we believe
[35:43] Jesus came he was a teacher John the
[35:46] Baptist came he was a preacher they they
[35:50] had different Ministries and different
[35:52] styles and let's not forget like tonight
[35:56] I'll be teaching on this book and let's
[36:00] not forget that we have to understand
[36:02] these things also to really receive the
[36:04] blessings from them
[36:07] I um like I said I was kind of down last
[36:10] night and
[36:11] Daniel my son he left this morning early
[36:16] I took him to the airport at I don't
[36:18] know like four o'clock this morning and
[36:21] he's going to a camp in
[36:23] um up at Cloverdale up in Washington
[36:27] a young people's camp and and he was
[36:29] excited and and he was giving me a
[36:33] testimony
[36:34] last night about he went to get a
[36:37] haircut
[36:39] and he was talking to the barber
[36:42] and uh this Barber just he just he was
[36:47] hurt
[36:49] and he's just
[36:52] he didn't know what to think he seemed
[36:54] to have a good attitude but he he just
[36:55] hurt and and Daniel was was talking to
[36:58] him and encouraging him and and just
[37:01] saying Hey Brother
[37:03] the Tabernacle things are happening why
[37:06] don't you come why don't you come visit
[37:07] and the the the barber said he says he
[37:11] says I will
[37:12] so we're looking forward to that and
[37:16] that that encouraged me that Daniel got
[37:18] to witness and encourage this man so
[37:20] Daniel calls me um like I said I dropped
[37:23] him off at like 4 30 or something this
[37:25] morning
[37:26] and
[37:27] as is almost always the case he calls me
[37:31] up and he says Dad my flight got delayed
[37:33] amen I and two more hours I could have
[37:37] slept
[37:39] so he uh
[37:41] and he said well I said well if you want
[37:43] me to come get you or whatever
[37:45] so
[37:47] he his flight he was going to go from
[37:51] Tucson to Las Vegas and then Las Vegas
[37:55] up to Washington to go to the camp
[37:58] well the engine wouldn't start on the
[38:01] plane in Tucson so they all had to
[38:04] de-board and as Daniel was waiting for
[38:07] the plane the first plane there was a
[38:09] young lady there about his age
[38:11] and uh they were you know in other parts
[38:15] of the the waiting room there in the
[38:16] lobby the place where they were going to
[38:18] board
[38:20] and
[38:22] they all got on the plane they're in
[38:24] totally different areas of the plane
[38:25] well then they all deplaned and they all
[38:29] got in line and they said okay well
[38:31] you're gonna go here and you're going to
[38:32] go to Dallas and you're going to go to
[38:34] Oakland and you're going to go over here
[38:35] and they'll flights to Las Vegas and so
[38:39] he goes over to this new gate and he
[38:42] sits down and there is that young lady
[38:45] and and she's sitting right here
[38:48] and they're both going
[38:50] to Oakland
[38:52] they're getting rerouted
[38:55] so they talk a little bit and she and
[38:58] Daniel has his backpack and she looks in
[39:00] his backpack and there's his Bible
[39:03] and she says is that a Bible
[39:05] and he says he says yeah he says he says
[39:09] it is and and they they start talking
[39:11] back and forth and she says I'm going to
[39:13] Hawaii
[39:14] right now
[39:16] and Daniel's like well I'm going to the
[39:18] youth camp and she says I'm going to
[39:19] Hawaii because we have a Ministry in
[39:21] Hawaii to cover all of the islands with
[39:25] Jesus Christ
[39:27] and this young lady she says she says we
[39:29] don't
[39:30] We Don't Preach any any Doctrine other
[39:32] than Jesus and Daniel says
[39:35] us too
[39:37] so they start talking back and forth and
[39:40] and it turns out she lives in Benson
[39:45] and she doesn't have a church that she
[39:47] goes to and she's going to be spending
[39:50] the next I don't know three or four
[39:51] months or whatever it is in Hawaii and
[39:55] she's going to be going to school there
[39:56] and but her main purpose is spreading
[39:59] the gospel there on the Hawaiian Islands
[40:01] so of course sister Lonnie I was
[40:03] thinking about you all and I was I was
[40:06] like oh man this is this is great but it
[40:09] was amazing to me
[40:11] that that they were on that plane
[40:14] nowhere near each other God stopped that
[40:17] engine it didn't let it start
[40:20] had him get off the plane
[40:23] and then go to a whole nother area
[40:26] and see each other meet each other put
[40:29] them both on the plane to together then
[40:32] they fly from from Tucson all the way to
[40:36] Oakland talking and and Daniel's I mean
[40:38] he says Dad I am so encouraged all we
[40:41] did was talk about the Lord
[40:43] and I thought praise God that my son 21
[40:47] years old and this other young lady
[40:49] talking about Jesus Christ how many 21
[40:52] year olds are talking about that amen
[40:59] sister Lonnie we got good kids no I
[41:02] don't feel good
[41:03] uh so I was just I was just feeding on
[41:06] that all day
[41:08] and uh just so proud and and made me
[41:13] think of this book this book of Acts
[41:17] that we're going to talk be talking
[41:18] about tonight
[41:20] they
[41:22] the same thing would happen
[41:24] they were just
[41:25] come into contact with another seed of
[41:29] God and when that water was poured on
[41:32] that seed it would Sprout and it would
[41:35] grow roots down deep so that when the
[41:38] winds would come it would it would go
[41:41] back and forth but those roots were deep
[41:43] and when that tree would move those
[41:45] roots would just go down deeper and then
[41:47] that tree would bear fruit
[41:50] and that fruit would go out and then
[41:53] that fruit would again it would Sprout
[41:56] roots and it would go out in it would
[41:58] bear fruit and then just on and on and
[42:01] on and I believe that is what is going
[42:05] to happen before the second coming of
[42:09] Christ I want to see this book of Acts
[42:12] become real
[42:14] I want to see it within us and and I
[42:17] think that we get a little taste of it
[42:21] every once in a while
[42:23] and I'm just blessed beyond measure to
[42:26] be able to open this book
[42:28] let's pray one more time
[42:31] Lord God
[42:34] father has opened my Bible it took me
[42:36] back a little bit
[42:39] know that that's your word
[42:42] pray Lord that your anointing would be
[42:44] upon
[42:46] this service
[42:48] father that your word would come forward
[42:50] in
[42:51] the same
[42:53] way that it was originally given
[42:56] may your Holy Spirit be present
[42:58] in Jesus name amen
[43:02] I am
[43:06] love this book
[43:09] I was reading it today and Daniel
[43:11] actually called me
[43:13] and he's like Dad
[43:15] chapter 20 is awesome he said isn't dead
[43:19] it's it's just he says it's incredible
[43:22] it's just great and I and I said I said
[43:24] well what part you like about it and he
[43:27] said the last part
[43:28] he goes oh man and I said yeah I don't
[43:32] think I'm going to get there tonight
[43:33] though but let me tell you you're going
[43:36] to like the first part I promise
[43:39] Acts chapter 20 verse 1.
[43:43] and after the Uproar was ceased Paul
[43:46] called unto him the disciples and
[43:49] embraced them and departed for to go
[43:52] into Macedonia
[43:54] I remember that uproar in in chapter 19
[43:57] that brother Lyle was talking about
[43:59] that's what the silversmiths and and
[44:01] Demetrius in the big Amphitheater and
[44:03] all that mess that happened
[44:07] and uh back in Acts 19 verse 21 Paul
[44:11] makes a statement that he wants to go to
[44:13] Rome
[44:15] but he says that first he needs to go to
[44:18] Jerusalem
[44:19] and these next it won't get to it today
[44:23] but uh these next chapter boy
[44:28] this is a deep thing that happens to
[44:32] Paul when he wants to go to Jerusalem
[44:35] and we see the influence of Godly
[44:41] holy spirit filled men
[44:45] on Paul and Paul has to make very very
[44:49] difficult decisions in fact he has to go
[44:52] against the whole church and make a
[44:54] decision but we'll get to that later
[44:58] this uh the next few verses they
[45:00] Chronicle Paul's trip through Macedonia
[45:02] to get ultimately to Jerusalem
[45:06] and when he had gone over those parts
[45:08] and given them much exhortation he came
[45:12] into Greece now the point on this one on
[45:14] this verse 2 I want to say that he says
[45:16] much exhortation
[45:19] Paul
[45:21] he preached a lot and we can see that
[45:25] his sermons many of them at least were
[45:29] not short in the least they were long
[45:33] and I know that that uh with me I'm
[45:36] usually fairly brief and I I don't like
[45:38] to wear the people out I've kind of made
[45:41] it made a commitment that that uh I want
[45:44] to keep the my sermons fairly short
[45:48] and then I want the people to remember
[45:49] what I say because I feel like if I say
[45:52] too much it
[45:54] I won't get my point across as good so I
[45:57] I keep it fairly fairly short but this
[45:59] Paul he didn't
[46:01] he would preach a long time
[46:04] and he had given them much exhortations
[46:06] he came to Greece
[46:09] and uh remember a couple chapters ago
[46:11] that he went to this modern Las Vegas
[46:15] you remember where it was
[46:20] do I have to stand here
[46:23] Corinth
[46:25] Corinth was a really bad place
[46:28] so he he went he went to this place in
[46:31] Greece and um
[46:33] in Athens was also I think I heard
[46:36] somebody say Athens so we have Athens
[46:38] and Corinth they're in Greece and there
[46:40] he Abode three months
[46:42] and when the Jews laid wait for him as
[46:46] he was about to sail to Syria he
[46:48] proposed to return through Macedonia
[46:51] now these three months that he was in
[46:54] Corinth right here
[46:56] before he heads back to Macedonia is
[46:59] generally considered the time that he
[47:02] wrote his letter to the Romans
[47:04] so that's probably when he penned This
[47:07] Book of Romans is when he was here in
[47:10] Corinth and he was writing to these
[47:12] folks
[47:13] but look at the resistance and it is
[47:17] common throughout this entire book of
[47:19] Acts look at the resistance it was
[47:22] almost always his own people
[47:25] it was almost always these legalistic
[47:28] Jews that they had their way of thinking
[47:31] and Paul came in and they thought he was
[47:33] off the word and they were always
[47:35] conspiring against him
[47:38] and here it is the same thing
[47:41] and there accompanied him
[47:43] into Asia sobetor of Berea now do you
[47:47] remember Berea Berea was that place
[47:49] where Paul came to preach and they
[47:51] didn't judge him they didn't judge his
[47:53] doctrines immediately but they studied
[47:55] the scriptures to find the answers and
[47:58] it looks like this guy's sopeter
[48:01] I think that's how you pronounce it that
[48:03] he was a convert I wonder why you know
[48:05] you hear people naming their kids Paul
[48:07] and Silas and that I wonder why you
[48:10] never hear a kid named sopeter
[48:15] I don't know
[48:17] um
[48:18] and of the Thessalonians aristarchus and
[48:21] secundus and Gaius of Derby and
[48:24] timotheus and of and of Asia tychicus
[48:28] and trophomas now there's some there's
[48:30] some high-powered people here with Paul
[48:32] right now he's he's got these preachers
[48:34] and these missionaries with him and um
[48:36] this like like Timothy and and and
[48:40] um
[48:41] tychicus and these ones that we read in
[48:43] other about in other books this was a
[48:46] missionary team that he had
[48:50] um with him but notice that there was
[48:51] one person that was missing in that list
[48:54] and that person was Luke
[48:58] these
[49:00] going before tarried for us at Trouse
[49:04] now
[49:06] these men they went before Paul and they
[49:09] were kind of maybe Paving the way for
[49:12] what Paul was going to do now Paul
[49:15] always had people with him in fact when
[49:17] he was when he was in prison or when he
[49:19] was in other places he would say hey hey
[49:21] come or send this person to me he he
[49:24] liked that fellowship and he he needed
[49:26] that help to do what he was doing and
[49:29] these missionary teams that we see here
[49:32] they're needed they're needed basically
[49:34] they're in the book of Acts and they're
[49:35] also needed now
[49:37] we think even like our little church
[49:39] here we have this Youth Camp this or
[49:42] this uh youth meeting that's coming up
[49:44] in August on August 26th we have got to
[49:47] have people in order to do things to set
[49:51] things in order like brother
[49:52] um brother Ed has got the hotels
[49:55] together we need to get some of the of
[49:57] the rooms done over here to get that
[50:00] ready we got to have the church ready we
[50:02] got to have people to park we have to
[50:03] have ushers everything has to be in
[50:06] order
[50:07] before we can have the meetings and
[50:09] these people that were with Paul were
[50:11] doing that type of thing same thing with
[50:14] our camp coming up we've got to have
[50:16] we've got to start assigning different
[50:19] jobs for people I've been working with
[50:20] brother Jeremy and sister Angela on on
[50:23] getting the the venue together we've got
[50:25] to have food and we've got to have
[50:27] activities we've got to have betting
[50:30] we've got to have all kinds of different
[50:33] things and we need a team to do it and
[50:36] that's what's going on right here is
[50:38] Paul has this team of brothers that are
[50:41] with him
[50:43] verse 6 says and we sailed away from
[50:45] Philippi after the days of unleavened
[50:48] bread and came unto them in Trouse in
[50:51] five days where we Abode seven days now
[50:54] brother Lyle is very very good at maps
[50:57] and he's good at putting in perspective
[51:00] where where these things are and these
[51:03] different places that these brothers are
[51:05] going so brother Lyle would you put
[51:07] those slides up and would you maybe give
[51:09] us a little explanation of these maps
[51:12] that you have
[51:17] this is interesting for me being at the
[51:19] back because now I can understand why
[51:21] when you sit in the back you can't see
[51:22] it
[51:24] that uh that big bold uh red arrow on
[51:28] the right is pointing to Ephesus and
[51:32] that's where Paul is leaving and he's
[51:35] following that Thin Red Line up the
[51:37] coast there the the green area of what
[51:40] is now turkey and is going to go across
[51:42] at the very top there to Philippi but
[51:45] meanwhile if you look at the Bold arrow
[51:48] on the left side that's pointing to
[51:50] Corinth and recall back from Acts 19
[51:52] that Paul sent Timothy and erastus over
[51:56] to Corinth
[51:58] ahead of him and we believe he carried
[52:01] the second letter to the Corinthians on
[52:04] that trip and then they made their way
[52:06] up through Greece and Macedonian over to
[52:09] to meet Paul and then Paul is then going
[52:12] down through through Macedonia Philippi
[52:16] Berea thessalonica and so forth and down
[52:19] there to Corinth to meet these guys
[52:20] where he then spends three months
[52:24] and writes a letter to the Romans which
[52:26] that little piece of green sticking way
[52:29] over on the on the far left is a little
[52:31] bit of the boot of Italy and and of
[52:33] course the Rome is is off the map to the
[52:36] left
[52:39] now here we see that we've got a kind of
[52:42] a zoom in here of Corinth and and these
[52:44] we hear that these Jewish people were
[52:46] laying in weight so to go to Syria you'd
[52:49] want to follow that arrow to the right
[52:51] that's where we'd like to get on a boat
[52:53] and head for Syria but unfortunately
[52:55] we've got all these guys that have
[52:58] another idea Paul's eventually going to
[53:00] go to Rome where that arrow is in the
[53:02] upper left but instead what he decides
[53:04] to do is to walk or presumably he's
[53:08] going by land up to Macedonia so he's
[53:11] going to go the long way around to avoid
[53:13] those folks that are that are lying in
[53:16] weight and and there's probably two
[53:18] reasons that they're lying in weight of
[53:20] course one is that they don't much like
[53:22] Paul and the other is that Paul has
[53:25] taken a an offering for Jerusalem and
[53:27] he's taking it with him and he doesn't
[53:29] have it as a bank card he's carrying
[53:31] some cash so he's got uh you know he's
[53:33] got this team of guys with him and and
[53:35] they're missionaries but they might also
[53:38] be carrying weapons knows go ahead for
[53:41] the next map so here
[53:43] we see that they make their way up
[53:47] to where it circled at the top is
[53:50] Philippi and that's where Paul is
[53:52] spending
[53:53] um uh Passover with Lydia and the Jailer
[53:58] and all the folks that are meeting up up
[54:00] there and then from there after Passover
[54:03] it says it takes some five days and he
[54:05] goes down to Trojas where the arrow is
[54:08] the vertical Arrow to your uh to your
[54:10] right I recall that when he was going
[54:13] out on his second missionary journey
[54:16] from toast to Philippi it took him two
[54:18] days but now it takes him five days to
[54:20] come back it's a different time of year
[54:22] the wind is going in a different
[54:23] direction
[54:24] and that gets us there so now he's in uh
[54:28] in the province of Asia and he's a
[54:30] troess and I think that something's
[54:33] going to happen from our long-winded
[54:34] Paul
[54:37] could you uh brother Jeremy could you
[54:38] put up the the
[54:40] widest view yeah right there so if you
[54:43] look
[54:44] so brother Lyle where is
[54:46] Jerusalem Jerusalem would be roughly
[54:49] where your finger just was
[54:51] Jerusalem is is off the map and it's
[54:55] down about about where your hand is
[54:57] actually
[54:58] like right here yeah there you are yeah
[55:01] you're you've got your hand on the holy
[55:02] city now there's Jerusalem so we um we
[55:06] see that Paul
[55:08] as is that is that it brother Lyle do
[55:10] you have any more yes sir okay so we see
[55:12] that Paul
[55:14] um instead of going right down to
[55:17] Jerusalem Paul backtracks and he goes to
[55:20] all of these different places
[55:23] up in here and brother Lyle brought out
[55:26] a very good point that Paul was taking
[55:29] up an offering
[55:31] for the people in Jerusalem because
[55:33] there was a famine there was there was a
[55:36] hard time going on in Jerusalem and Paul
[55:38] was visiting all of these different
[55:41] churches and all of these different
[55:42] places not only ministering but also
[55:45] collecting and offering that they could
[55:48] give back
[55:50] to this this church this the big church
[55:53] the first church in Jerusalem so that's
[55:56] I believe that that is probably the
[55:59] reason that he went all round about this
[56:04] way was to do that
[56:06] now let me read verse 6 again
[56:11] very very important a little
[56:15] uh clue and we sailed from Philippi
[56:19] after the days of unleavened bread and
[56:22] came unto them to Trouse in five days
[56:25] where we Abode seven days now today in
[56:29] our society that we live in
[56:32] the world especially the United States
[56:34] that we live in
[56:35] there are these things they're a big
[56:39] point of contention and a big fight
[56:41] called pronouns
[56:46] he she
[56:47] they them and there's this there's this
[56:51] big fight either you want to identify as
[56:54] uh he or you want to identify as a she
[56:58] or you want to identify somewhere in
[57:00] between as a they
[57:03] and and it's it's it's a very odd thing
[57:06] but let me tell you something pronouns
[57:09] are very very important
[57:13] and they're important right here because
[57:16] the author of This Book of Acts wants to
[57:20] identify
[57:22] that he is with Paul
[57:25] and it says here and we
[57:29] sailed away from Philippi so now we know
[57:34] that this servant of the Lord Luke this
[57:37] doctor is on the scene and with the
[57:41] Apostle as they're traveling that's
[57:43] going to be very very important here in
[57:46] a few verses later so remember what did
[57:49] Paul do for a living I mean what did
[57:51] Luke do for a living
[57:53] he was a doctor this is going to come
[57:55] into play here in a few scriptures later
[58:00] and Again Luke as I said pronouns are
[58:03] important you know what what today back
[58:06] and forth whatever that is but here we
[58:10] see how important they are that this man
[58:12] Luke is identifying himself saying we
[58:16] sailed
[58:18] and upon the first day of the week
[58:21] when the disciples came together to
[58:23] break bread Paul preached unto them
[58:25] ready to depart on the morrow and
[58:27] continued his speech until midnight
[58:31] the book of Acts
[58:33] is
[58:35] an application
[58:37] of scripture it's an application of
[58:40] Doctrine
[58:41] so why do these stories matter so much
[58:46] these these things you know it's going
[58:48] around and doing all these things we
[58:50] look that
[58:52] Luke slips in little nuggets here into
[58:56] the scripture that are very very
[58:59] doctrinal
[59:01] and if you didn't know it you would just
[59:03] read right over
[59:05] it says right here and upon the first
[59:08] day of the week
[59:11] when the disciples came together to
[59:13] break bread this was a communion service
[59:16] and
[59:18] pretty much everything that you read
[59:21] they took communion they took the Lord's
[59:24] Supper
[59:26] most of the times that they came
[59:28] together
[59:30] so we looked they they took they took
[59:32] the bread
[59:33] on the first day of the week
[59:36] now we see
[59:38] how these doctrines of the Bible are
[59:41] applied in real life in the book of Acts
[59:45] in Galatians we see
[59:47] that this whole book of Galatians is
[59:51] really slamming against legalism
[59:54] and against being judgmental and that
[59:56] and we see that this book of Galatians
[59:58] it's applied over here in the book of
[1:00:01] Acts I believe it's chapter 15 when we
[1:00:04] see the two brothers coming from
[1:00:06] Jerusalem and they come down into
[1:00:09] galatia and to believe it's Antioch and
[1:00:12] they cause all kinds of a pro a problem
[1:00:13] saying hey you're not living according
[1:00:15] to Moses you're not doing things right
[1:00:18] you're not you're not eating these these
[1:00:21] these holy you're eating dirty types of
[1:00:24] animals you're not keeping the Sabbath
[1:00:27] you're not
[1:00:28] um pushing circumcision circumcision and
[1:00:32] then he writes this book of This Book of
[1:00:34] Galatians to address that but we see it
[1:00:36] right there
[1:00:38] in the book of Acts chapter 15. and the
[1:00:40] same thing in Acts 19.
[1:00:42] we see that them
[1:00:44] teaching and and believing the prophet
[1:00:48] John the Baptist
[1:00:50] we see his converts and how they didn't
[1:00:52] go far enough with John's with John's
[1:00:55] doctrines
[1:00:57] they stopped short of following Jesus
[1:00:59] and receiving the holy spirit in Acts
[1:01:01] 19.
[1:01:02] and they were bragging to Paul that they
[1:01:04] were converts but then Paul asked them
[1:01:06] if they had received the Holy Spirit
[1:01:08] since they believed like what
[1:01:12] the Holy Spirit we didn't know that
[1:01:14] there was any Holy Spirit and then was
[1:01:16] the first thing Paul says he says how
[1:01:19] were you baptized
[1:01:22] so we see the application of Matthew 28
[1:01:24] 19.
[1:01:26] go into all the world baptizing them in
[1:01:28] the name of the father and of the son
[1:01:30] and of the Holy Ghost we see Acts 2 38
[1:01:34] baptizing them in the name of the Lord
[1:01:37] Jesus and we see it applied right here
[1:01:40] where Paul says hey you've got to be
[1:01:42] baptized right an application of a
[1:01:46] Doctrine in the book of Acts and then
[1:01:48] they were baptized in the name of the
[1:01:50] Lord Jesus
[1:01:52] and we see how Luke
[1:01:55] the author of this book he throws in
[1:01:57] another nugget of Doctrine and that's
[1:01:59] this nugget that's this doctrine of the
[1:02:02] Sabbath
[1:02:04] so
[1:02:05] if the first day of the week is Sunday
[1:02:09] the last day of the week is the Sabbath
[1:02:11] is Saturday
[1:02:14] so why are they worshiping on the first
[1:02:18] day of the week rather than the last day
[1:02:21] of the week but it says right here in
[1:02:23] the book of Acts which is a a very fresh
[1:02:25] Church very fresh converts they're
[1:02:29] worshiping on Sunday and that's carried
[1:02:31] forth two thousand years a little we got
[1:02:34] to read it we got to know these little
[1:02:36] doctrines these doctrines are important
[1:02:39] and Luke is slipping them in here
[1:02:43] so
[1:02:44] if he died on the cross he was put on
[1:02:48] the cross on Friday
[1:02:50] all right we know that from the
[1:02:52] scriptures
[1:02:54] he died on the cross at three o'clock in
[1:02:57] the afternoon we know that because he
[1:02:59] died about the ninth hour of the day the
[1:03:02] day starts at six o'clock when the sun
[1:03:05] comes up nine hours later is three
[1:03:08] o'clock and he died there at that three
[1:03:11] o'clock now they took him off the cross
[1:03:14] because there was some sort of an
[1:03:17] agreement between the Romans and the
[1:03:20] Jews that you don't leave a man up on
[1:03:23] the cross on the Sabbath now it could
[1:03:26] have been I don't know if it was every
[1:03:27] Sabbath or I don't know if it was just a
[1:03:30] Passover holiday but that was an
[1:03:32] agreement so that's why they broke the
[1:03:34] legs of the other two male factors that
[1:03:37] were on the cross so they would die so
[1:03:39] they could get them down off the cross
[1:03:40] before the Sabbath and the Sabbath is on
[1:03:43] Saturday but do you know when the
[1:03:44] Sabbath starts
[1:03:46] starts on sundown
[1:03:48] on Friday
[1:03:49] so we see that that's the case he was in
[1:03:52] the grave for
[1:03:54] um Friday evening he was in the grave
[1:03:57] for Saturday for Saturday and then he
[1:03:59] rose the Bible is very plain that he
[1:04:01] rose on the first day of the week
[1:04:03] so we look and we see now that they're
[1:04:06] worshiping on this first day of the week
[1:04:09] but is that a Doctrine
[1:04:11] is that something that has to be let's
[1:04:14] turn to Romans chapter 14 quickly
[1:04:17] verse 5.
[1:04:19] Paul says this he says one man esteemeth
[1:04:23] one day above another
[1:04:26] esteemeth every day alike
[1:04:29] let every man be fully persuaded in his
[1:04:32] own mind
[1:04:34] when you worship
[1:04:36] this is a personal walk with the Lord
[1:04:40] brother told me the other day
[1:04:44] um
[1:04:45] he says you know he says he says I
[1:04:47] understand that the message isn't for
[1:04:48] everyone I said I didn't I didn't it was
[1:04:51] an email I didn't I didn't respond but I
[1:04:53] don't necessarily believe that
[1:04:56] and people say well that the Bible isn't
[1:04:58] for everyone I don't believe that either
[1:05:00] I believe it is for everyone I believe
[1:05:03] that it can be a blessing to everyone I
[1:05:06] believe that this book
[1:05:09] is a blessing if people would allow it
[1:05:12] to be a blessing to them for so to say
[1:05:15] that it isn't for everyone no no I
[1:05:18] believe that it is but the question is
[1:05:20] how you regard the message or the
[1:05:23] scriptures in the Bible
[1:05:25] that's the question and how you apply
[1:05:28] this to your own life
[1:05:31] there's the question and we look here
[1:05:34] and if anyone that ever lived was not
[1:05:38] wishy-washy on the way he believed it
[1:05:41] was the Apostle Paul
[1:05:44] he was dead set on his Doctrine and the
[1:05:49] way he believed
[1:05:51] so as I go to this next verse
[1:05:55] know that Paul isn't being wishy-washy
[1:05:59] here he's saying that you have to have a
[1:06:01] relationship with God so that you can
[1:06:04] take this these scriptures and you can
[1:06:08] apply it to your life
[1:06:11] verse number six says this he that
[1:06:13] regardeth the day
[1:06:16] regardeth it unto the Lord
[1:06:18] and he that regardeth not the day to the
[1:06:21] Lord he does not regard it he that Edith
[1:06:24] eateth to the Lord he that giveth God
[1:06:26] thanks and eateth not to to the Lord he
[1:06:30] eateth not and giveth thanks so Paul
[1:06:32] says he's saying here and even Peter
[1:06:34] says sometimes Paul's writings are a
[1:06:36] little hard to understand
[1:06:38] Peter said I'm just quoting him but what
[1:06:41] what Paul is saying is that this man
[1:06:44] that's fasting he's doing it for the
[1:06:46] Lord this man that is eating over here
[1:06:50] he's doing it to gather strength so that
[1:06:52] he can serve the Lord so both are
[1:06:55] equally serving the lord here if they
[1:06:58] are right with God and if they have that
[1:07:00] that that relationship with God
[1:07:05] for none of us live none of us liveth to
[1:07:08] himself
[1:07:10] and no man diet to himself for what
[1:07:13] whether we live we live under the Lord
[1:07:15] and whether we die we die unto the Lord
[1:07:16] whether we live therefore or die we are
[1:07:20] the Lords
[1:07:22] so as I said we should have that
[1:07:24] relationship
[1:07:25] with Christ
[1:07:27] so that
[1:07:28] the reason I am doing this the reason I
[1:07:31] am living my life like I'm doing is
[1:07:34] because I'm serving God
[1:07:36] and Paul trusted that in the people some
[1:07:40] of them worshiped on Saturday Paul
[1:07:42] trusted it he says you keeping the days
[1:07:44] and all that no no no
[1:07:46] however the Lord's leading you I believe
[1:07:48] it's Hebrews chapter four I believe he
[1:07:51] talks about the Sabbath
[1:07:52] and he says this sabbath is the day of
[1:07:55] rest but it's not a day that you have to
[1:07:57] observe
[1:07:59] every day
[1:08:01] should be observed so here's Paul and
[1:08:04] he's he's talking about the Sabbath and
[1:08:06] he's he's saying that some people keep
[1:08:08] it on Saturday some people on Sunday but
[1:08:11] whatever you're doing make sure you are
[1:08:13] pleasing the Lord and doing so make sure
[1:08:16] you have that relationship with brother
[1:08:17] Jonathan and I we're praying and we're
[1:08:20] living our lives in a certain way and
[1:08:22] brother Jonathan wants to live his life
[1:08:24] differently than me
[1:08:28] I trust brother Jonathan I know he's a
[1:08:30] man of God and if somebody comes to me
[1:08:33] and said brother Jonathan is wrong in
[1:08:36] wanting to worship on Saturday
[1:08:39] I know brother Jonathan I know that man
[1:08:42] prays I know that man has a relationship
[1:08:45] with the Lord
[1:08:47] don't
[1:08:48] put him down
[1:08:50] trust that the holy spirit is living
[1:08:52] within brother Jonathan and the same for
[1:08:54] me
[1:08:56] let's go back to Acts 20.
[1:09:02] it's uh we'll read I'll read verse 7
[1:09:04] again so we get back on the same and
[1:09:06] upon the first day of the week when the
[1:09:07] disciples came together to break bread
[1:09:09] Paul preached unto him unto them ready
[1:09:12] to depart on the morrow and continued
[1:09:14] his speech until midnight again this is
[1:09:16] a communion service
[1:09:18] and from what we know these Services
[1:09:21] always included breaking bread
[1:09:25] and remember from verse 2 I believe it
[1:09:29] was
[1:09:29] yeah that Paul had much exhortation
[1:09:34] brother Leo he preached long services
[1:09:37] and I'm gonna read about one of those
[1:09:40] long Services right now
[1:09:44] and let me let me give you a warning
[1:09:46] here
[1:09:48] um
[1:09:50] it's my job to warn you
[1:09:52] and some of you are guilty
[1:09:57] of this infraction that I'm about to
[1:10:01] read about
[1:10:03] and I've seen you do it
[1:10:09] and there were many lights in the upper
[1:10:11] chamber
[1:10:12] and they were gathered together
[1:10:15] and they're sat in the window a certain
[1:10:17] man named eudicus
[1:10:19] being fallen into a deep sleep
[1:10:24] and as Paul was long preaching he sunk
[1:10:28] down with sleep and he fell down from
[1:10:31] the third Loft and was taken up dead
[1:10:36] don't fall asleep in church
[1:10:40] let that be a lesson
[1:10:45] make sure you remember more in my sermon
[1:10:48] than just that okay
[1:10:51] [Laughter]
[1:10:56] so this young man uticus and and from
[1:11:00] the from the translations from the
[1:11:01] original Greek when it when it says this
[1:11:03] young man he's probably between 10 and
[1:11:05] 12 years old maybe between 8 and 14 but
[1:11:08] he was about that age
[1:11:11] and he had fallen from the Third
[1:11:15] story
[1:11:16] and he probably I always thought well he
[1:11:19] probably fell down
[1:11:21] uh you know into the congregation but he
[1:11:23] probably didn't it was he probably fell
[1:11:25] backwards and fell out into the street
[1:11:28] maybe and I mean
[1:11:30] it's black he's he's dead
[1:11:33] and and he's laying there
[1:11:36] now remember
[1:11:38] who is on the scene
[1:11:41] Luke is on the scene
[1:11:46] and that's going to come back here in
[1:11:47] just a minute
[1:11:49] ah
[1:11:51] I feel the Lord
[1:11:56] and Paul went down and fell on him and
[1:11:58] embracing him said trouble not
[1:12:00] yourselves for his life is in it
[1:12:03] and when he therefore was come up again
[1:12:06] he had broken bread and eaten and talked
[1:12:10] a long while even till break of day so
[1:12:12] he Departed
[1:12:14] and they brought the young man alive
[1:12:17] and we're not a little comforted
[1:12:19] so Paul so this young man falls down
[1:12:21] Luke right here in the scripture
[1:12:24] pronounces him dead
[1:12:27] and then Paul comes up
[1:12:30] and laid down upon
[1:12:34] the young man
[1:12:35] you remember Elijah
[1:12:37] laying down on the child
[1:12:40] and the brother Branham had done that
[1:12:44] too there's there's something about that
[1:12:47] he laid down on the child and I believe
[1:12:50] it was Elisha
[1:12:53] it was Elisha and the shunami woman and
[1:12:56] Elisha laid down on top of the child and
[1:12:58] and his mouth was to his mouth and life
[1:13:02] came back in this child and we see Paul
[1:13:05] he went down and he laid he fell down
[1:13:08] upon this child and embracing him said
[1:13:10] trouble not yourselves for his life is
[1:13:13] in him
[1:13:15] thinking about
[1:13:18] how much
[1:13:19] seeing that all of these people that
[1:13:23] were there late at night and they see
[1:13:26] this young man fall to his death and he
[1:13:28] was obviously dead and here comes a
[1:13:30] doctor and this doctor pronounces him
[1:13:32] dead
[1:13:34] and then Paul
[1:13:35] this great man brother Leo comes down
[1:13:38] and lays down upon this young man and he
[1:13:41] is raised up from the dead what a
[1:13:45] testimony
[1:13:47] what an incredible thing that happened
[1:13:49] and then Paul he goes and he stays up
[1:13:52] all night and he breaks bread again and
[1:13:54] they're talking about the Lord all night
[1:13:56] and he wants to just I can see Paul I
[1:13:59] can feel how he was he loved the people
[1:14:01] and he just he wanted as much time as he
[1:14:03] could spend with him he wanted to do it
[1:14:04] so all night long he didn't go to bed
[1:14:07] they just talked about the Lord imagine
[1:14:09] brother Joel rejoicing
[1:14:11] over what had just happened and talking
[1:14:12] about that
[1:14:14] and there's and there's Paul and then
[1:14:16] finally he asked he has to leave they
[1:14:19] wake up the next morning and
[1:14:21] or they didn't wake up they talked all
[1:14:23] night
[1:14:24] and they must have been talking about
[1:14:26] this
[1:14:28] child being Resurrected
[1:14:33] wouldn't you have loved to see something
[1:14:36] like that
[1:14:38] it was documented by this man Luke
[1:14:42] a few years ago
[1:14:45] I was in service
[1:14:47] in Jeffersonville
[1:14:50] and there was a man
[1:14:53] that died
[1:14:55] in service
[1:14:56] he was about maybe for me to brother
[1:14:59] Aaron from me and I looked down the
[1:15:01] aisle and I saw a commotion I looked
[1:15:03] down the aisle and there was this man
[1:15:05] and his his face was white his mouth was
[1:15:09] open he had drooled on his chest his
[1:15:11] eyes were open and there was my brother
[1:15:15] who was a paramedic and a doctor
[1:15:20] checking his pulse
[1:15:23] and let me tell you friends it is the
[1:15:25] one of I must say
[1:15:27] it is one of the most documented
[1:15:30] Miracles that have ever happened
[1:15:34] and it happened in our day and I was
[1:15:36] there to see it
[1:15:39] we read the book of Acts about Luke
[1:15:42] would you like to see the testimony of
[1:15:45] this what happened here brother Jeremy
[1:15:47] do you have it
[1:15:50] it's about
[1:15:52] we'll close after that it's about 10
[1:15:54] minutes or so
[1:16:01] this is Brother Isaac toy right here
[1:16:08] I took this video
[1:16:11] that evening
[1:16:13] so so this is right after it happened
[1:16:22] I promise their sound
[1:16:36] sister Campbell tapped me on the
[1:16:39] shoulder when we had sat down for uh
[1:16:42] right when we were gonna do the offering
[1:16:43] and
[1:16:45] she uh motioned for me over to him and
[1:16:49] then she said can you get brother John
[1:16:50] Wall because he was standing two rows in
[1:16:52] front of me with the offering and I
[1:16:54] tapped him
[1:16:55] on the arm to get him and then I
[1:16:58] motioned back and showed him and I don't
[1:17:00] remember I think he went up either to
[1:17:02] get Brother Joseph or to get some I
[1:17:05] think he was going up to your brother
[1:17:06] Joseph and he um
[1:17:08] I knelt down when I knelt down and
[1:17:10] looked up
[1:17:12] had uh
[1:17:14] at the brother he was the brother James
[1:17:16] his little James brother James his eyes
[1:17:19] were open we're open his eyes were back
[1:17:21] but they were just just set straight
[1:17:23] ahead and his mouth was open his head
[1:17:26] was down like this and his you could
[1:17:28] just see Bubbles and saliva and mucus
[1:17:30] just coming out
[1:17:32] kin he was just completely still like
[1:17:34] that and I just I put my hand on his
[1:17:36] shoulder and started praying and then I
[1:17:39] could feel the brothers coming up also
[1:17:41] and started praying that could hear
[1:17:42] Brother Joseph
[1:17:43] praying and then
[1:17:46] um as he was praying you could
[1:17:48] he said he could feel his heartbeat
[1:17:50] coming back
[1:17:53] not long ago Rita Levy commercial
[1:17:56] celebrated her 103rd
[1:18:04] and then we picked him up and
[1:18:16] brought him outside and by the time we
[1:18:18] got him outside he was still
[1:18:21] his eyes were he was moving him at that
[1:18:24] point and he was and another brother had
[1:18:26] his head lifted up brother Matt who said
[1:18:28] I mean he checked for a pulse for their
[1:18:30] Adam check for a pulse
[1:18:32] um
[1:18:34] and they couldn't find anything and then
[1:18:37] brother
[1:18:39] Joseph said when he first put his hand
[1:18:41] on him
[1:18:42] he said he and then when he started
[1:18:44] praying he could feel that pole starting
[1:18:45] to come back
[1:18:47] and then we carried him out and by the
[1:18:49] time we got him outside he was
[1:18:51] he was already doing better he was
[1:18:53] starting to close his eyes open his eyes
[1:18:55] he still wasn't really coherent but then
[1:18:57] he started
[1:18:58] brother Adam asked him how old he was
[1:18:59] and instead of answering he just
[1:19:03] raised up his hand so we knew we knew he
[1:19:05] was still doing good when he was doing
[1:19:07] good when you first noticed him how long
[1:19:08] do you think he had been like that when
[1:19:10] we sat down
[1:19:11] when we sat down for uh
[1:19:15] just in the pre-service
[1:19:17] I thought he had fallen asleep because I
[1:19:20] could hear
[1:19:21] twice I heard him make a sound almost
[1:19:24] like I don't know if he was snoring but
[1:19:26] I could hear just almost like a snort
[1:19:27] sound it sounded like a snore but it
[1:19:29] just happened two times just kind of a
[1:19:32] kind of a drawn out kind of not drawn
[1:19:35] out but just kind of a snore sound and I
[1:19:37] had thought he had fallen asleep but
[1:19:40] um
[1:19:41] my mom said she noticed when we were
[1:19:44] standing up singing that he was
[1:19:48] massaged over and that he wasn't
[1:19:50] standing up with us so we sang for at
[1:19:55] least what five or ten minutes had to
[1:19:57] have been and he was sitting down he
[1:20:00] never stood up which means he had to
[1:20:02] have been
[1:20:03] at least out while we were up singing
[1:20:06] before we stood up so when he was when
[1:20:09] we stood up he never even stood up so he
[1:20:10] was he could have been gone then so it
[1:20:13] wasn't a matter of seconds it was a
[1:20:14] matter of minutes matter of minutes
[1:20:16] maybe five minutes I mean we sang for we
[1:20:20] sang for a long time so and it was I
[1:20:23] mean we've sang he prayed
[1:20:26] did the Prairie Quest and all that and
[1:20:28] then
[1:20:29] so
[1:20:31] it was it was a long while
[1:20:34] I'm brother Matthew golden from
[1:20:35] Owensboro Kentucky I'm a practicing
[1:20:37] general surgeon at the hospital there I
[1:20:39] was actually sitting in the row in front
[1:20:41] of brother James this morning
[1:20:43] brother Isaac Toy's wife came and got me
[1:20:46] shortly after we realized that he wasn't
[1:20:48] breathing
[1:20:49] I turned around got directly out of my
[1:20:51] seat went to him he was slumped over in
[1:20:53] his chair I checked his pulse checked

[1:20:57] faults on his neck had no respirations
[1:20:59] at all I wasn't protecting his Airway at
[1:21:02] all I immediately went to the front of
[1:21:04] the congregation and waved to the
[1:21:06] platform to get some help
[1:21:08] went back to assist brother James I
[1:21:11] actually had my hands on his Carotid

[1:21:25] brother Adam came shortly after that and
[1:21:29] got down in front and checked it karate
[1:21:31] all right radial pulse
[1:21:33] this is Brother Adam
[1:21:36] brother Adam Evans and I work for voice
[1:21:38] of God I've worked there for about eight
[1:21:40] years but before that I was in the fire
[1:21:41] service and I was a paramedic for 10
[1:21:44] years out of about 13 years in the fire
[1:21:46] service
[1:21:47] it doesn't take much
[1:21:50] helping the ASPCA give an animal a need
[1:21:53] the care safety meal
[1:21:59] one of the deacons had got my attention
[1:22:01] and said they need some help over here
[1:22:03] and when I got to brother James brother
[1:22:06] Matt was behind him holding his head up
[1:22:08] with his hand on his neck checking a
[1:22:11] pulse and so I did the same thing on the
[1:22:13] other side of his neck checked a pulse
[1:22:15] on that side I didn't find anything
[1:22:17] checked a radio pulse and didn't find
[1:22:19] anything it was it was clear that just
[1:22:21] had no signs of life he was very cool
[1:22:23] sweaty
[1:22:25] just had some mucus coming out of his
[1:22:27] mouth and very clear that he had passed
[1:22:30] at that point
[1:22:31] so we just continue to pray I don't know
[1:22:34] how long it was you know in your in your
[1:22:37] thinking as a human you think well you
[1:22:38] need to start CPR and something told me
[1:22:40] just to pray and at that time some of
[1:22:43] the other brothers came and Brother
[1:22:44] Joseph came and he came down in front of
[1:22:47] brother James and I I was I was praying
[1:22:50] and and we don't know I don't know the
[1:22:52] time frame of how it happened how long
[1:22:54] it took or what happened but as we were
[1:22:56] praying I felt him kind of gag and kind
[1:22:59] of taken a deep breath and you felt the
[1:23:02] breath kind of come back in him I didn't
[1:23:03] feel a pulse of that second I felt the
[1:23:05] breath first brother Adam felt at the
[1:23:08] same time and looked up at me and said
[1:23:10] he's breathing kind of asking me you
[1:23:12] know is he breathing and I said yeah
[1:23:13] he's breathing and we felt it at the
[1:23:15] same time I kept my hands on his pulse
[1:23:17] and I felt a pulse slowly actually come
[1:23:19] back at that point you could cut a
[1:23:22] feeling kind of try to catch his head
[1:23:24] trying to get strength back to him at
[1:23:26] that time we took him out of the service
[1:23:27] carried him around by the time we got
[1:23:30] him outside he kind of had a little a
[1:23:31] little bit more signs of life to him by
[1:23:33] the time we got around the front of the
[1:23:34] building he was he was nodding slowly
[1:23:37] kind of incoherently speaking to us and
[1:23:39] then he started speaking to us and
[1:23:41] slowly woke up from there got stronger
[1:23:43] and stronger I started praising the Lord
[1:23:45] every time we'd ask him his age he'd
[1:23:47] praise the Lord and then when the
[1:23:50] ambulance got there
[1:23:51] um
[1:23:52] I told them what had happened and I
[1:23:54] actually wrote in the ambulance with him
[1:23:55] to the hospital when I got in the
[1:23:58] ambulance I kind of explained to him the
[1:24:00] situation and I told him I said God just
[1:24:01] raise this man from the dead
[1:24:03] and they put on an EKG leads and ran a
[1:24:06] 12 lead EKG and actually myself got to
[1:24:09] look at it it was completely normal for
[1:24:12] his age there was no major heart attack
[1:24:14] or changes on the on the EKG no funny
[1:24:17] heart rhythms or anything
[1:24:19] um his oxygen level was a hundred
[1:24:21] percent he had trouble checking it
[1:24:23] because he kept wanting to praise the
[1:24:24] Lord the whole time there and the last
[1:24:27] thing he remembered was Brother Joseph
[1:24:29] coming out and tell him we prayed for
[1:24:30] your brother you're going to be all
[1:24:31] right and we wrote him in the ambulance
[1:24:34] and he just was praising the Lord the
[1:24:36] whole way there we got to the to the
[1:24:38] emergency room and by then he was kind
[1:24:40] of already laughing and already praising
[1:24:41] the Lord and happy
[1:24:43] the only thing in the emergency room
[1:24:45] that we found I was there through the
[1:24:47] whole thing they let me come back with
[1:24:49] him to the CT scanner and I saw his EKG
[1:24:52] there in the emergency room his his Labs
[1:24:54] were normal his heart enzymes were
[1:24:56] normal he didn't have a major heart
[1:24:58] attack his head CT was normal so he
[1:25:00] didn't have a major stroke or anything
[1:25:02] to explain it everything was normal
[1:25:04] except for his temperature his body
[1:25:06] temperature was about 94 degrees we
[1:25:08] didn't believe it at first because he
[1:25:09] was awake talking to us so much and he
[1:25:11] looked so well but after checking it
[1:25:13] again it was about 94. I don't know what
[1:25:16] that means all I can say that it means
[1:25:18] he must have been dead for a while to
[1:25:21] actually get a body temperature that low
[1:25:22] and after we got to the emergency room
[1:25:25] he warmed up and came up to normal
[1:25:26] before I left
[1:25:28] hey there if you're a homeowner and you
[1:25:30] have a power meter like this on the side
[1:25:31] of your home
[1:25:40] from from my perspective when I after me
[1:25:44] and Matt had kind of first touched base
[1:25:45] and realized that he didn't have a pulse
[1:25:47] I started unbuttoning the brother's
[1:25:50] shirt
[1:25:50] and I had it in my mind that this person
[1:25:53] had passed on but I just kind of knew
[1:25:56] that the Lord was going to do something
[1:25:57] and I wanted to make sure that I could
[1:26:00] say positively that he had passed away
[1:26:02] at that point
[1:26:03] I unbuttoned his shirt
[1:26:05] I put my hand on his chest just to make
[1:26:09] sure I couldn't feel anything any
[1:26:11] respirations or any heartbeat or
[1:26:13] anything
[1:26:14] and as I was doing that I may have been
[1:26:16] there for I don't felt like a while but
[1:26:19] it's probably 30 seconds to a minute
[1:26:20] whether Joseph had come up and brother
[1:26:23] Joseph's hand I felt it underneath my
[1:26:25] hand
[1:26:26] and shortly thereafter I felt the
[1:26:29] brother's chest just rise a little bit
[1:26:31] and that's I was pretty sure I felt him
[1:26:33] breathe that's when I stood up and got
[1:26:36] in
[1:26:37] first in the brother's face and I was
[1:26:39] feeling by his cheek to see if he was
[1:26:41] breathing at all and I felt a little
[1:26:43] something and that's when I looked at
[1:26:44] Matt and I said he's breathing and Matt
[1:26:46] says I know and uh I kind of squatted
[1:26:49] back down I looked at Brother Joseph and
[1:26:50] said he's breathing and Brother Joseph
[1:26:52] just stared at me for a second
[1:26:55] looked very intent
[1:26:58] and I said you want us to get him out of
[1:27:00] here and get him going instead
[1:27:02] yeah
[1:27:03] and so we put him in his chair and we
[1:27:06] got him out and we heard the rest of the
[1:27:08] story from Matt
[1:27:09] uh both you Brothers brother Adam you
[1:27:11] first in your expert opinion and all of
[1:27:14] your experience what do you think
[1:27:16] happened to this brother as far as
[1:27:18] physically
[1:27:19] while in service
[1:27:20] some of the people around him were
[1:27:23] saying that before anybody was really
[1:27:25] alarmed uh that he was just sitting
[1:27:28] there with his head down and he made a
[1:27:30] couple uh
[1:27:31] snoring type sounds and they weren't
[1:27:34] sure if he was asleep or what but there
[1:27:37] is a like a snoring respiration for a
[1:27:39] dying person it's
[1:27:41] pretty common when somebody's dying
[1:27:44] could have very well been the case and I
[1:27:46] think he may have been deceased for
[1:27:48] quite a while a number of minutes before
[1:27:50] somebody actually noticed when they
[1:27:53] noticed by the time we all got there
[1:27:55] I mean it was just clear he was pale
[1:27:58] white he was sweaty very cool
[1:28:02] no signs of life at all his eyes were
[1:28:05] fixed not responding to anything
[1:28:08] obviously no respirations absolutely no
[1:28:10] pulse I checked every way I knew how to
[1:28:13] check to see if he had a pulse
[1:28:16] just because
[1:28:18] I felt that the Lord was going to do
[1:28:20] something and I wanted to be sure that I
[1:28:22] knew that he wasn't just passed out or
[1:28:26] fainted he was he was definitely
[1:28:28] deceased I've seen a lot of people who
[1:28:31] are have been dying and people who are
[1:28:34] deceased in my previous career and I
[1:28:37] mean it was clear he was it was not a
[1:28:40] not living at that point
[1:28:42] hey Matthew how about your your pain I
[1:28:44] feel the same way I I can't explain what
[1:28:47] happened
[1:28:48] um to me you know as as much as you you
[1:28:51] see in the medical field and I see it
[1:28:52] you know at least every month or so
[1:28:55] you're you're there when somebody passes
[1:28:57] or you have a wreck come in that
[1:28:58] somebody passes and your hands on their
[1:29:00] pulse when they pass he was cold and
[1:29:03] like we said he was obviously had no
[1:29:06] signs of life that I could tell
[1:29:09] um the only thing in my mind that can
[1:29:11] explain it is his heart must have went
[1:29:13] into a funny Rhythm or something during
[1:29:15] the service and and he died for a number
[1:29:18] of minutes usually when you don't refuse
[1:29:20] for a few minutes you can tell when you
[1:29:23] come up to a patient
[1:29:25] and it definitely looked to me the best
[1:29:27] that I can say that he had been gone for
[1:29:29] a few minutes
[1:29:39] brother Matthew are you the one when
[1:29:41] someone comes in and they're deceased
[1:29:42] are you the one that would give them a
[1:29:44] death certificate or what you would say
[1:29:45] that I would say I would have to
[1:29:47] um and that's it's it's up to the doctor
[1:29:49] that's there and I'm I'm certified to
[1:29:52] run codes in the hospital when somebody
[1:29:54] passes in the hospital to try and bring
[1:29:56] them back in CPR and advanced Trauma
[1:29:59] Life Support too so I would be the one
[1:30:01] that would declare somebody dead on a
[1:30:03] death certificate that would be
[1:30:05] something I'd have to fill out so you're
[1:30:07] pretty sure he was dead that's if he was
[1:30:09] in the hospital we would have already
[1:30:11] called the Mormon yeah so how about you
[1:30:14] um
[1:30:15] a typical scenario would be that us as
[1:30:18] paramedics would be working on the
[1:30:20] patient doing the you know Advanced
[1:30:23] cardiac life support and actually doing
[1:30:25] the work while a physician like Matt
[1:30:27] would be more or less calling out the
[1:30:29] orders calling out the drug dosages and
[1:30:31] the one making the decisions on when to
[1:30:34] say this person this past when to keep
[1:30:37] trying
[1:30:38] want to try to defibrillate when to when
[1:30:40] to do that and we're kind of the the
[1:30:42] hands for the doctors who are usually
[1:30:44] doing that and that's typical scenario
[1:30:46] once in the hospital in the field
[1:30:49] um you know obviously we don't have a
[1:30:50] doctor there and so we do we have you
[1:30:52] know standing orders that we work under
[1:30:54] a physician's license and uh then we
[1:30:57] usually call up the hospital talk to a
[1:30:58] doctor like Matt and get advice on
[1:31:00] whether to pronounce the person dead
[1:31:03] on the scene or to take him into the
[1:31:05] hospital situation like this we would
[1:31:08] have you know done CPR in the patient
[1:31:10] put them on an EKG if it merited it
[1:31:13] we're going to try to defibrillate try
[1:31:14] to bring it back with with medicine
[1:31:16] which a lot of times some drugs will get
[1:31:18] a heartbeat back but it's just caused by
[1:31:20] the medicine this in this scenario we
[1:31:23] didn't do anything except for prey we
[1:31:25] didn't do CPR we didn't try to give any
[1:31:28] sort of respirations we just laid our
[1:31:30] hands on them I was you know very busy
[1:31:34] trying to find a pulse trying to find
[1:31:35] some sort of
[1:31:37] sign of life with the brother and it
[1:31:39] just wasn't there but then when we
[1:31:42] we both felt that respiration at the
[1:31:43] same time I think we neither one of us
[1:31:46] was really surprised
[1:31:47] I think I would have been surprised if
[1:31:49] if we didn't feel it at that point is
[1:31:51] I don't think the Lord would allow that
[1:31:53] in this church
[1:31:55] So Adam you were you're sure he was gone
[1:31:57] I'm positive well Matthew you're sure he
[1:31:59] was gone
[1:32:03] see my name is uh brother James E
[1:32:06] Jackson from Jeffersonville Indiana
[1:32:10] went to church Sunday morning and about
[1:32:14] like always do about the same time early
[1:32:17] get up there and get buy me a seat and
[1:32:20] sit there and listen to the gospel
[1:32:23] singing of the brother Branham and
[1:32:26] everything you know and then I sat down
[1:32:29] and listened more singing everything and
[1:32:31] as I sit there and got time for the
[1:32:34] meeting to start and everything and I
[1:32:37] remember kind of set down my head and
[1:32:40] bowed down and stuff and and uh
[1:32:43] I don't know what I was doing on that
[1:32:45] and I just the next thing I know when I
[1:32:48] woke up I was on my way from the
[1:32:51] ambulance to go to the hospital and
[1:32:54] everything Brother Joseph
[1:33:06] said the Lord is him heal me and
[1:33:08] everything brought me back to life so we
[1:33:10] got to give the Lord's cream for Dad
[1:33:18] like in the Lord
[1:33:20] I learned that long time ago
[1:33:25] very good thank the Lord to put me into
[1:33:29] this wonderful message the only message
[1:33:31] that it ever was
[1:33:33] thank you Lord
[1:33:36] amen
[1:33:40] amen
[1:33:46] I was there
[1:33:50] musicians have come I was there and we
[1:33:54] had a modern day Luke that was there
[1:33:57] also
[1:33:58] that was an absolute miracle of God just
[1:34:02] like this young man uticus in the Bible
[1:34:05] we see that this book of Acts this Jesus
[1:34:08] Christ is the same today as he ever was
[1:34:11] when I looked down I looked down that
[1:34:13] aisle
[1:34:15] and there was that man
[1:34:17] he was he was dead he was he was so dead
[1:34:22] that I turned to my wife
[1:34:25] and I said he's dead
[1:34:28] and I turned to a minister behind me
[1:34:31] brother Trevor Eamon and I said he's
[1:34:34] dead
[1:34:36] and I knew friends I can stand before
[1:34:39] the Lord I knew he was going to come
[1:34:43] back to life
[1:34:44] I knew it and it was witnessed by about
[1:34:46] 800 people
[1:34:48] right there and they saw it and the Lord
[1:34:52] just provided he provided a modern day
[1:34:54] Luke he provided my brother Adam said he
[1:34:56] got down on his knees
[1:35:00] and he put his hands
[1:35:03] on his chest and something told him make
[1:35:08] sure he is dead because this is going to
[1:35:10] be a testimony
[1:35:12] and that man was dead
[1:35:14] brother James lives today and he's
[1:35:18] [Applause]
[1:35:24] if you've uh
[1:35:25] I don't know if you take the tour of
[1:35:27] Tucson you
[1:35:28] you know about the Evans service station
[1:35:30] that goes way back brother James used to
[1:35:34] hang out at that service station
[1:35:36] in the 1960s and fellowship with the
[1:35:40] Brethren he's been around that long and
[1:35:42] he stands today as a witness to the
[1:35:45] power of the Lord Jesus Christ that same
[1:35:48] God that raised up uticus raised up
[1:35:52] mother James Jackson I pray it was a
