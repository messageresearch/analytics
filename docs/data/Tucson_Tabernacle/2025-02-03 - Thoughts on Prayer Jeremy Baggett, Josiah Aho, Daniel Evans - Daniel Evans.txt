I'll say yes to your will Lord I'll say [Music] is and where you lead me I will go I say yes Lord I'll say [Music] yes amen let's all stand sister Jessica if you could put up Romans chapter 8 verse number 26 familiar scripture if you're here on Wednesday night it reads like this sister Lily go ahead and continue please likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities so we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself make it intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the Saints according to the will of God let's bow our heads Our Father those words father have been such a comfort to me I pray Lord that you'd bless us tonight bless our speakers father bless the music and Lord may you your presence be here with us in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen you can be seated we're doing something different thank you we're doing something different tonight and uh I'm excited I already see the Jeremy bagot fan club over there with all those kids they're pointing and waving and everything there's daddy up there on the pulpit brother it's good to see you my friend God bless you keano God bless you um so tonight what I want to do as I had on my heart to have some of the brothers in church that don't necessarily get a chance to come up and to talk about a subject and they're maybe a bit out of their comfort zone but I I think it's it's okay for us to get out of our comfort zone sometimes and uh I'll say a few words on this subject of prayer and then I've asked brother Jeremy bagot brother Josiah AO to say a few words after me between 10 and 15 minutes each and I um I think it's going to be a blessing to hear hear from somebody besides me and brother ly and brother Aaron in this church um I uh on Wednesday night I'll give you a little recap I spoke on prayer and and I tried every way that I could to say the same thing in many different ways and uh I I read the scripture I just read and what I kept saying was if you really get into the spirit of prayer then it's no longer you that asks for these things it's the spirit that's inside of you that asks I give a testimony um maybe I said it this morning was I gave my heart to the Lord when I turned 21 and the first thing that I asked is okay I see a career on on the horizon I see I'm graduating from college here pretty soon Lord I need a wife and and I want a wife and I want kids and and I want to this is the direction I want to go but Lord I will never no matter if you give me a wife or not I will never return to the sinful ways that I've lived and it was that night I uh I got on my knees and and I asked the Lord for that and I really don't believe that that was necessarily Daniel Evans praying I believe that it was a spirit within me wanting to be with me for eternity and laid it on my heart to make a change I'll read that scripture again Romans 8:26 six says this likewise the spirit also helpeth with our infirmities helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought so we really don't know the mind of God he says we probably should know the mind of God but we really don't know the mind of God we think we know what we want to pray for we think we we want to pray for being healed or like me as a young man I wanted I prayed I wanted a wife we think we know but we don't necessarily know but the spirit itself makes intercessions for us with groanings which cannot be uttered so these words that the the spirit speaks through us as we pray if we really surrender ourselves and the most important thing is we have to surrender our own desires we have to surrender the Bible to King James says lusts lusts in in this context it means our desires our wants we need to surrender those things to truly get into the spirit and then that is when you see prayers answered believe we heard a testimony this morning that brother Jordan gave of a prayer that was was truly answered and uh believe it was Russell right I think his brother Russell Wallace um was praying and that his how his farm wouldn't be destroyed his his Ranch wouldn't be destroyed with the fire and then that they would have water and then the Lord just overd delivered with just an incredible gusher of water in this well and we have to understand that we have to trust in God and it says the next verse and he that searches the hearts knows what is the mind mind of the spirit so this one that searches the hearts is our Lord and savior Our God and he knows he knows what we need he knows what the mind of the spirit is because he makes intercessions for the Saints according to the will of God the will of God is the key there and then look at the next verse it's a verse we've all memorized it's a verse we all know about than probably any other verse maybe John 3:16 and we know verse number 28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God and to them who are called according to his purpose so we pray we get on our knees we try to surrender ourselves to the Lord Lord I I want what you want in my life I know I know that that you know what's best for me I want to get into your spirit I want to pray and then we know that all these things work together for the good and many times we struggle and we pray and we struggle and nothing seems to happen sister Irma I saw you walking great today you couldn't walk a couple weeks ago the Lord you struggled you suffered but the Lord stepped on the scene and we still have little aches and pains but those aches and pains are for our own perfecting those struggling is is for our own perfecting when I was that young man at 21 years old Lord give me a wife I want to get married I want to have a family I want to have this career and then I still said but but Lord I no matter if you give me one or not I'll still serve you then got up I was in the middle of the night woke up the next morning I said all right where is she went to church nope same girls that are usually [Laughter] here went to uh went to Young people's functions nope this isn't really working six months passed a year passed two years passed three years four years five years six years past and I still hadn't met this one that I prayed for that night but I always look back and I said Lord I'm going to keep my end and if you don't give me a wife then I'm still going to serve you then we had a I went to a volleyball game a youth event at Jacob's Park and I met this young lady who was I know I don't know like 18 years old and started talking and here we are married but brother Dan you know when I when I prayed that when I was 21 I was on my knees and I was praying and I got up and I was like Lord where's my wife at that time she was only 14 so I couldn't have married her then anyways God had to raise her up a little bit before I got old before she got old enough and I could you know marry her so she was 20 and I was uh I was I 26 yeah she always tells me I'm seven years older than her but I'm actually only six depends on what time of the year I'm I'm July and she's December and yeah um but prayer is so important I gave the testimony on Wednesday night that I witnessed to a lady and I said something that that didn't mean much to me because it was just something that I deal with every day I told her I said The more more you pray the more you want to pray and the less you pray the more difficult it is to pray and it's true with us you'll find that if you haven't prayed and you say Lord I really want to start praying it's going to be the hardest thing that you can do your mind's going to be going all over the place you're goingon to be checking your text your phone your your wrist is going to be vibrating with a phone call or or a text or or whatever it is and and every distraction is going to be there but stay with it and try and then the next day keep praying and the next day keep praying and and I feel like I've gone years before and I feel like Lord did you hear anything that I've said in this past year Lord did you I haven't seen any sign from you I haven't seen anything Supernatural you haven't you haven't gave me a dream you haven't given me a vision you have't you haven't given me anything Lord I don't know am I doing something wrong Lord are you even hearing me and then I'll see I'll be able to look behind me and see this road that I came and wow he was hearing me every step of the way and he was providing for me every step of the way and I just didn't notice because he was so humble and so subtle and here we are today I uh always prayed for my children and always prayed for Daniel and meline and and the times got really hard when they stray like all kids stray and you do but God loves you still and God's God's taking care of you his hand is upon you when you stray and you go on and on and on and as parents you pray for your children and then all of a sudden your son will be singing in church your daughter will be married to a fine Christian boy and you think wow W I struggled I fasted I prayed and I didn't even notice and here we are and he answered every single prayer when you're praying for your children when you're praying for a husband when you're praying for a a wife go before him in prayer and the Bible says Jesus said he that knocketh it shall be opened not wait no Lord Lord father father and keep on knocking keep on knocking Lord I am going to be here knocking at this door until it's open because your word says that he that knocks it shall be open I'm going to stand here and keep knocking until you open it have a clear conscience and have a clear heart and be willing to take the gift that he gives you because I promise you it'll work out better for you in the end but don't give up on prayer keep praying and like I said I've gone years and not had the experiences that I I I remember having and I look back and he answered every single prayer it was just in his way and if we have time I'll read a scripture that says that very thing when I put out um that we were going to do this brother Jeremy I said I would like to get some a few of the brothers to that haven't been up here in the Pulpit to say a few words to the congregation I said 10 or 15 minutes brother Jeremy sent such a sweet and humble text and I uh I don't have my phone I'd like to read it to the congregation but it it was just so sweet and he basically said like I'm not worthy but I'll give it I'll try brother Jeremy is somebody that he's in the word he's in the word all the time he's always listening to sermons he he reads his Bible a lot he's they're if you know Jeremy and Angela they're always in church even now they got a got a whole herd of kids it's good thing they looked at me they just give me thumbs up it they got all the all these kids and they're still here and they're they're raising their these new children to to fear the lord and to love the Lord and to be in church they're teaching them right and brother Jeremy has just been he's been a blessing to me he's been a friend to me and I asked him he he volunteered and I said yes I think it would be a blessing to hear what the Lord might place on your heart about this subject of prayer so brother Jeremy I'll introduce you and may God be with you and and bless every word word that you say good evening Let's uh guess we've already prayed and I'm a little nervous I don't talk to many people at once I talk to individuals at at times and uh it's uh it's a little different but it's um because I got to look at you and talk at the same time and uh keep my thoughts um straight um let's let's go to Luke and you don't have to put this one up on the screen if you have your Bibles you can go to Luke 22 because I'm only going to read half of one verse and our machine back there does not read half and it's Luke uh 2231 when you have it say amen and the Lord said Simon Simon behold Satan hath desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat but I have prayed for thee that thy fa Faith fail not a lot of times we uh we go through this life and we we we like all the scriptures that he has hid hid these words in our hearts and they'll manifest as time goes on because we learn them by and by and so um just just thinking that you know Jesus prayed for me and because he's present today if he's just 2,000 years ago this is just a book a history lesson um something that you can't really rely on but it's the blueprint and brother either brother brother brother brandham said that any testimony you have you should find a word to it so you can anchor it in the heart that God's already given you so um I uh I was working and construction it was uh the first years of Harmony we did Harmony at uh the fox Fox um Fox Theater downtown and um and I was working construction and I got through my day almost to the end of it and I picked up a bucket too heavy and I pulled something in my arm and it hurt I didn't tell anybody of it I always try to practice that scripture in Psalms that says um if I was hungry I would not tell you so I I uh I really believe that God knows our every action he um even his word he says I I write down every thing you say and was like Lord forgive me for all the bad things that I say um and uh and give me encouragement for the things that I do do good but um we were I went to Harmony that night I don't know about you but I I think the devil's been fighting me pretty hard just to get up here um it always happens we're always fighting at home or something something drastic happens and you know you just want to throw in the towel am I am I supposed to encourage people when I'm having such a hard time but we went to Harmony and I was actually still single I went through myself like brother Dan says when you give your heart to the Lord you're you're in the Lord's service and this is the Lord's Arena and he he he's here he invited you here and you came voluntarily sometimes we feel like we're dragged because we're part of the family but you know listen intently to people who who have sojourned with Jesus Jesus a long time um that's why I listen to tapes but at Harmony I was sitting in the balcony and um they were singing a song one of the nap families um was singing a song and I don't remember the song was but I just you know I lifted up a hand like this and this one was the one that hurt and I praised the Lord with this hand most of the time because I just want to remind him yes that he came over a sweet presence came over me and what was hurt stopped instantly um the next testimony I want to tell you is in I put all my things in bookmarks so I wouldn't have to do a lot of flipping um hadasa um she I Pastor her testimony the other night and um it's it's been a trial in the half because um each of these individual Souls that we look after um they they are somewhat abandoned and they're they're like just ripped apart from their families by a by a system to um to the preserving of their life really from families with hard habits and things like that and uh it's it's hard and so um we were going to church and she really wanted to be baptized and the system wouldn't allow that because they were saying that you know we were influence her in some way and I said no you have to go to your dad and you have to ask ask him I mean if you were our child you could get baptized instantly no no questions asked because it's a it's a good conscience towards God that you want to serve him and uh she had um she had trouble in dreams she has really bad dreams and if anyone's had a nightmare you know brother brandham said dreams are when you sleep and Visions are when you're awake and um and dreams no one can dream a dream some people don't dream at all they go to bed and they wake up the next morning and they're gung-ho and some of us are troubled we while we sleep and so she's troubled sometimes and um and our dreams are bad and uh we so we my wife and I instructed her next time you have back dream call on the name of Jesus and so so I this was just given to me um uh just in the office something to tie your testimony to but um first uh first Peter 2 9 and 10 but ye are a chosen generation of royal priesthood a holy nation a particular people that you shall should show forth the Praises of him who hath called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light which in time past were not a people but are now the people of God which had not attained mercy and now have a tame mercy so we instructed her and and uh so she woke up from one of these bad dreams and she said Jesus Jesus Jesus and she said the second Jesus she heard a a deep voice and said yes wow and she said take away these bad dreams and she slept through the night prise God thereafter wow amen so you know God works on both ends um and then the last testimony that I'd like to give on prayer you know it's all these prayers but this is more like prayer in action because Jesus prayed for us am and so some sometimes you know was telling the group chat we everyone has a sister's chat and we have a men's chat and I said it's not so important to try to do something but you need to start and if it's a one second do it for 10 seconds you need get up into a minute get into five minutes and like enjoy being content quiet by yourself and um and don't and if anything start looking on the Affairs of others if you have a notepad or something write down prayer requests and bring those before the Lord amen before your own needs because you know God is our Shepherd and we shall not want we should th those are strength kind of scriptures that God says we don't have a need necessarily but when we have a need then we need to ask and like brother Dan was saying knock knock I have that um license plate I was sitting over there and I was like oh that's on my license plate Matthew 6:33 seek ye the seek ye first the kingdom of God the word seek means search and his um his riches are unsearchable so there's nothing nothing great little small insignificant all these testimonies are little but you know we serve a really big God yes amen and when something little happens to you and you have a little little um little praise um write it down so when you're in a battle or a disturbing thing see what he did for you later on in life and it will encourage you um let's go to um Psalms this one this one's a little older kind of thing but I um I my my wife gets talk to the Lord a lot more than I do and so when I'm in trouble I asked God to give my my wife a scripture because she just she's sensitive enough I mean you know we we stopped going to um theer a long time ago unless it's a really good thing like the last thing we watched was chosen in the theater it was awesome um but even then that was a year or two ago um but I ask God to and she she kind of gets Restless in the middle of the night and and she's is like okay I gotta get up God's got me something and she throws open her Bible and she starts reading and then something hits it hits her right there and it's like this is what we need so um just right before Co hit the news and that whole shebang came um God woke her up one night and so it was in the middle of the night she had the Light lamp on downstairs she was reading and when she came to these two vers is the light went blew out and so um it was it was just about that time but it says because thou Hast made the Lord which is my refuge even the most high thy habitation there shall no evil be follow thee neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling and so at that time we were watching 12 13 kids in the house before Obama made a law that we only could watch five um but we had and you you've never seen so much sickness come through the children when they go to school I got lies then we're all wondering if we got lies we start scratching and stuff like that but you know it was just it was just the Lord because their parents were all um I wouldn't want to say faithless they had their own research that they did on it and the whole shebang and we have to get vaccinated and it's like nothing's tested Kennedy fought for the post office so we didn't have to be vaccinated um it was a big thing but um yeah that's that was our anchor through Co and um I think I shared it actually with with the world on Facebook at the time but anyways that's all I have for tonight may God bless [Applause] you that was great brother just brother um Jeremy uh he mentioned kids coming home with lice and uh I got to share testimony this is humbling yourself okay we uh things when I was in Jeffersonville uh things towards the end before I left things began to deteriorate a little bit and I'm just as far as me and and and my position there and uh it wasn't it's I was just as fault as as as anybody else and uh I got demoted at Still Waters Camp I got demoted from the highest office which was chaperon I got devoted to checking for lice I I guess maybe it was because um there was no chance of me ever getting it so I made the best of it and I became the head lice checker you get it but that was that was the title I gave myself I said I'm the headlights Checker and you know it was a blessing I was able to to help out with the camp and then of course I I got to go back to chaperon but I got to be able I got to help out and and it just it was really really good but when you're praying humble yourself before the Lord be willing to take the lowest position and then God well he promised you if you will take the lowest he that exalts himself will be abased but he that lowers himself will be exalted it's not in our desire it should be in our desire to be exalted but we should knowingly lower ourselves and take the lowest place I um I really appreciate brother Jeremy mentioned Luke 22 verse 31 and and he said that Jesus said Peter Satan can you imagine Jesus telling you nah Satan has sought you can you imagine can you imagine some the Lord Jesus telling you Lionel Satan has sought you Satan is after you and he and Jesus said he is after you to sift you you like wheat what does that mean when wheat they put it in a sifter it has to be violently shaken to separate the wheat from the chaff the seed from the chaff and it is a violent thing that that wheat goes through and Jesus says Peter the devil has sought to do the same thing to you but listen to this but I have prayed for you Peter Jesus Christ himself I have prayed for you imagine the Son of God God standing in Flesh on Earth even he prayed when he chose his disciples he chose his 12 Jesus prayed all night the night before he chose those disciples he wanted to be sure this is the Son of God so how much should we pray how much should we put these things into the hand of the Lord and not seek our own but seek what God wants amen our brother coming up next brother Josiah he's he's been a blessing to us all and in singing and and he and sister Katie are just two of the most gifted people I've ever seen and I am so thankful they're they're both what are you 22 22 years old and doing what they both are doing for this church at such a young age it it needs to be recognized and and how much of a blessing that they are to us and I wanted to get some youth up here and and have brother Jeremy who I know is really is loves the Lord with all of his heart and and he's always and always praying and always in the word and now get brother Josiah who is another man of God and to see a perspective on this topic of prayer that we might not normally see as Elders in the church so brother Josiah if you would come and say what's on your heart the closer uh brother Jeremy got to being done the faster my heart rate got and then brother Daniel's up there talking and it's like just talk keep going take your time give my heart rate a chance to slow down um I have the handheld because I move a lot not without thinking I just move around and that's hard sometimes when I pray because I can't sit still so I'll go out maybe to sit in the car and pray be like okay be still stand out here so I can hear from God a truck goes by and I'm like oh man that's the 73 I've always always wanted one of those and I get down this like six or seven minute Rabbit Trail in my head not even realizing where the time went it's all gone that's a struggle I have but uh I was able to sit down and think about this about prayer I've had a uh a few words on my heart that NE not not necessarily was about prayer but um the Lord kind of opened a scripture up and I thought it'd be really good to share I would like to say I think prayer is one of the most important things about being a Christian because to know the Bible is wonderful but there's actually lots of people that know the Bible that don't know the Lord even even atheists a true atheist a real atheist is actually a a master and a and wise on all religions he studies all of them and decides he doesn't want anything to do with any of them but so KN knowing the Bible is one thing and we must know it but to know God and to talk to him personally sets aside the Christian from somebody else who just reads a book bringing God out of History we listen to that message here you can bring God out of History by your prayers so if you'd put up Matthew 16 verse 13 so praying and realizing that the Lord is real he's real in your life he wants to help you I think we can agree that's that's like the first step that you realize God is real and I can talk to him so we're going to learn about this this time when Peter was now I wrote down this I think in our circles this is probably like fifth or sixth most common scripture I just thought about it from all the churches I've gone to growing up all the camp meetings and stuff I've been to I've heard this scripture a lot um there's one thing I never noticed though so when Jesus came into the coast of cesia Philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that I the son of man am and they said some say thou art John the Baptist some Elias others jeremias or one of the prophets and he saith unto them but whom say ye that I am whom say ye that I am he's asking each and every one of us this too because he directed it at this at the group and Peter steps up and answers but he's asking every single person every day who do you say that I am with what you do with your life how how you spend your time what place are you putting him in and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon barj Jonah for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed this unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and I say unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock so what he just said you are the Christ the son of the Living God Jesus said that's a revelation from God and upon that I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it so I've heard it read many times you have too the gates of hell now we learned in our Wednesday night bible studies that the difference between a town and a city is that a city has a wall around it is that right a city has a wall around it and a town is just open so when it when it fortifies itself builds a wall around then it's a city and it says the gates of hell so every city had a primary entrance point and it would be the gates of that City if you wanted to get into the city you you had to go through those Gates you couldn't the wall was there to protect the whole city so it it didn't matter if you came with a huge Army you could only get so many through at a time so the gate was the strongest point in the city because they could protect from that point do you follow me a huge Army couldn't rush into that gate because maybe only 10 people wide could get through it so then the city was strong right there they could put guards there and you wouldn't be able to get in so it says the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against it that means that this church is an offensive church so the Gates of Hell will not be able to defend it I think this is me speaking my testimony I think I pray too much defensively only when I'm on the run and I I'm I'm going through something hard I'm struggling I'm having a really hard time and I need I I'm I'm I'm running then I turn to God but Jesus said on this revelation of who I am I'm going to build my church and when you pray you're actually moving forward do you follow that the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against against it how does the Lord's Prayer start our father who are in heaven I can imagine Peter many times later in his life probably said Lord Jesus Christ son of the Living God because it was real to him he looked to the Lord and he knew exactly who he was and that is the fundamental part I believe the beginning of Christianity if I could be so bold to say you can't be a Christian without a prayer life you can't be a Christian without talking to the Lord that's something I struggle with because it's easier for me to just sing a song glorifying God or to read my Bible or to read something or to just listen to a sermon rather and all those things are wonderful and I encourage everyone to do all of those things but if you're not talking to him anyone can just listen anyone can read but you need to be talking to the Lord I'll I'll I'll be willing to say I struggle with that that's something I have a hard time doing and then I find myself in these defensive situations where I'm running away when we're supposed to be the church that the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against so we're just moving forward and it's so amazing it's not it's not this Grand dramatic thing it's simply getting on your knees Jesus said in secret and your heavenly father who sees you in secret will reward you openly it's not it doesn't have to be a huge dramatic thing it's so calm and the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it it's such a wonderful thing what greater thing than to be able the one to be able to talk to the one who created everything I I said bringing God out of History you can do that by just getting on your knees and talking to him that brings him out he's not he's not just the one I read about anymore he's not just the one I hear about I actually talk to him not just about him but I talk to him and so uh before I go to the the next part I'm halfway through and I'm eight minutes in we're good the so there's a scripture we read in James that says the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much who knows the first half of that scripture that's the second half confess your faults one to another and pray for one another that ye may be healed it's really humbling to be able to stand up here and talk about prayer because many of you have spent a lot longer in your life praying a lot longer knowing the Lord and I will say again this is something that's been hard for me to be able to say I need to lay aside this time I'm going to lay aside this time to talk to him that's something I struggle with I want to say that's confessing my fault to you asking that you would pray for me and that we would pray for each other that we could all do better better at this so I just wanted to say that before I go to the Lord's Prayer and I want to talk about two parts in the Lord's prayer Our Father who art in heaven we have these ways of of starting a prayer Jesus said after this manner pray ye so he didn't say pray exactly like this every time he said after this manner pray Our Father in heaven and what's so great about this prayer is it challenges you it really puts you to the test if you if you really think about some of these words and apply them to your personal life it's challenging it's not easy Our Father who art in heaven Hallowed Be Your Name Your Kingdom Come your will be done so you're laying down what you want give us this day our daily bread and forgive us as we forgive so it's a challenge you know in your heart and I know in my heart when I get down there to pray and ask for forgiveness Lord am I forgiving like I should it's a challenge and the Lord is saying this is open everyone this is something after this manner pray ye lead us not into temptation now only you know in some cases what that is but that's really vulnerable to say Lord lead me not into temptation and you know what that thing is Lead Me Not onto that website lead me not to a group of people like that lead me not into that kind of music you're opening up yourself acknowledging the fact Lord Lord I'm weak in this area and I can't do it I can't do it without you I can't do this without you when you get to that point when you're a humble vessel God can come in and deal with you I think the only T the the times where the Lord has really spoke to me is after I I've tried hard I've tried to do it my way for so long and I finally just sayl I can't do it I have this this this this this I can't get through and you lay yourself before the Lord and he appreciates that humility and he's saying right in this prayer Lord lead us not into temptation like I said everybody knows what that is in your own life what that temptation is what that what that thing is that you need to get through and it challenges us to have better faith and the best thing about following these things the Lord said to pray about you know it's his will he said after this manner pray ye you know you're praying his will because it aligns right with his word if you're praying Lord I don't want to be led in led into temptation that's right in the scripture that's right out of the Bible if you're praying Lord may your kingdom come that right in his will that's right what he wants give us this day our daily bread he wants to he wants to do that for you Lord forgive us he wants to forgive us and he wants us to forgive one another and that's the that's a challenge right there Lord help me to forgive better because I want to be forgiven by you as well for thine let's say it together is the kingdom the power the glory forever amen healing is his will it's in the word salvation is his will salvation for others salvation for your own heart to receive the Holy Ghost is his will for others for yourself peace Joy love these are all things he wants you to have and I pray that we as a church can be a church that lifts up our city the needs here in Tucson I pray that we wouldn't speaking to my myself also we wouldn't always just look inwardly but we look outward Lord how can we help how can we do more for others how can we lead people to you it's your will Lord It's Your Will to bring to bring people to you how can we do better better at that thank you for listening God bless [Applause] you yes amen we don't always have to be defensive as Christians you know we all I like what brother Josiah said he says we're always in the defensive mode Lord protect Lord Lord get get me out of this out of this mess Lord help my son that's that's in that's struggling or help my daughter that's this you can go after the devil I was I was thinking as brother Josiah was speaking James 4:7 says submit yourselves therefore to God resist the devil how do you submit yourselves before God you pray that's what I talked about in Romans chapter 8 Lord your will be done Lord what is you what do you want submit yourselves give yourself up to God and resist the devil and you know what it says next and he will flee from you that's offensive not defensive the devil starts running away when you get down and you really pray and you really submit yourself to God then the devil takes off and he he's he's he's he's running like a scared rabbit then William cper as brother Josiah was talking William cper said this he said Satan trembles when he sees the weakest of Sinners go to his knees that's beautiful it's so so true I have a few minutes left and if it's okay I would like to read I was praying before service and I I said Lord do you want me to say anything should I should we just sing songs should and have brother Josiah and brother Jeremy speak and I think that now I was a little bit worried but I think 15 minutes now it should be a minimum and and not maybe a maximum maybe 15 to 20 minutes um because I really I thought both of them could have kept going and I really enjoyed both of them so we will continue on with at least 15 minutes now as I was praying I was saying Lord what do you what do you want what what can I say to the church do you want me to say anything and I said if you do Lord let me just let me open up my Bible and uh maybe give me something now how many times have I said the same thing and I opened up my Bible and it's like okay Lord I must have turned to the wrong page let me try that again oh no you know God's perfected in threes let me let me do that again and then and eventually you're going to get something that meets exactly what you what you want I don't believe that the Bible should be something like as brother brandom said a Ouija board um I do I do have a um quote um brother the Michael sent me this it's it's really beautiful it says that the power prayer is the most powerful weapon that was ever put into the control of the human being there's no atomic bomb there's no hydrogen bomb as powerful as prayer Pray prayer will change the mind of God did you know that it did it did it one time and that's the time that we know the story about Hezekiah when God said that you're going to die to make things ready and he said Lord I I need I need some more time on Earth then the prophet came back and told them but I really feel as if the Lord laid on my heart when I open my bible this time to Isaiah chter 55 and I just really I just want to read the word Isaiah chapter 55 and we'll read we'll read the whole scripture it says this Isaiah 551 listen how beautiful this is when we're praying and how perfectly this scripture lines up oh everyone that thirsteth Come Ye to the waters and he that hath no money Come Ye and buy if you have no money how can you buy but he says you come here no matter what you have no matter how down you are no matter what you've done you come and you buy you come if you're thirsting come to these Waters yay come by wine and milk without money and without price wherefore do you spend money for that which is not bread and your labor for that which satisfieth not hearken diligently unto me and ye that which and ye and eat ye that which is good and let your soul Delight itself in fatness he wants us to be happy brothers and sisters he doesn't want us to always be suffering like brother Josiah said don't always be defensive get on your knees and say Lord I want to go after the enemy I want to submit myself to you you don't have to always be sad so often Christians think oh me we live in this world and it's so hard yeah we live in this world and it is so hard but we've got a purpose here and we've got a living God that is with us incline your ear and come unto me hear and your soul shall live and I will make an Everlasting Covenant with you even the sure mercies of David behold I have given him for a witness to the people a leader and a commander to the people behold Thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not and the n and na ations that knew thee not that knew not thee shall run unto thee because of the Lord thy God and for the Holy One of Israel for he hath glorified thee I'll put that into today the world will come running to you because of your testimony the world should come running to you because you are a Christian I want what that person has I want that Joy that's in that family I want want that hope that is in their hearts seek ye the Lord while he may be found call ye upon him while he is near what a statement seek ye the Lord while he may be found that means there's one day that he won't be found there's one day that you'll call on him not you there's one day that people will call on him and he won't be there to answer but he says seek ye the Lord while he may be found call upon call ye upon him while he is near let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the Lord what we've been preaching return unto the Lord and He will have mercy upon him and to our God for he will abundantly pardon oh remember I said this morning no Satan I got a signed email here I got a signed letter that this is not not me that I am justified for he will abundantly pardon only through Jesus Christ can he pardon for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways sayeth the Lord one of my favorite scriptures we don't understand why things happen why why is this doing this why why do we have to why do I have to go through all this he says listen he says my ways are not your ways he said that my thoughts are not your thoughts just trust me for as the heaven Heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts higher and my thoughts than your thoughts I love that part for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and returneth not hither but WTH the Earth and make it make it bring forth and Bud that it may give seed to the S and bread to the eater so shall my word be that goeth forth out of out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing where to I centered I tell brother Aaron had that one memorized that's very very much a comfort to me that I try to minister this and and I try to read this even this very chapter that I'm reading right right now it's going upon our ears and God said it will not return to me void but it will accomplish that where with i that thing with for the reason I sent it for ye shall go out with joy and be led forth with peace the mountains and the hills shall Break Forth before you into singing and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands instead of of the thorn shall come up the fur tree and instead of the Brier shall come up the Myrtle tree and it shall be to the Lord for a name for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off brother Michael and the musicians could come for ye shall go out with joy and be led forth with peace and the mountains and the hills shall Break Forth before you into singing and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands that's a joyous time that's a time that we look forward to that there's not going to be any sin there's not going to be any sickness not going to be any dying there's just going to be all joy and all happiness and brothers and sisters what I said about a a Christian being sad and down all the time why would you be sad and down if you have that hope right there so this chapter that I read out of Isaiah it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I I please and it shall prosper in the thing where to I sent it even that very scripture it's going to be a joyously time joyous time it's going to be a happy time and a Christian no matter how bad things get a Christian always looks forward to that time and we can get on our knees and it may be the worst time in your life but you can get on your knees and you can thank God you can thank God for this time that you're going through and you can thank God for his promise because it's if God if I promise it there's a chance it won't happen but if God promises it it will happen and we can we can take joy and we can thank God just as if we have it now amen let's all stand I need some go the [Music] mic I thought about this song while brother Jeremy was giving the testimony about hadasa it was already on the list so let's sing it I know it amen this is our I just

speak the Holy Name Jesus [Music] Jesus your name is power your name is healing your name is life break every stronghold shine through the shadow burn like fire on with that song but let me read a scripture brother Jordan I want you to close in prayer [Music] also the Apostle John the Bel beloved disciple laid his head on Jesus's bosom his different his gospel is different than the other three his gospel is completely and solely dedicated to the deity of Jesus Christ listen to what this man says when he quotes the Lord Jesus says this in St John chap 14 verse 13 and whatsoever you shall ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son and he repeats himself if there might have been a question upon the the minds of those that were listening he says this [Music] if you shall ask anything in my name I will do it and if you love me keep my Commandments What a promise what a promise of prayer that if you ask anything in my name and it will glorify the father through me you can have what you ask for do you believe in prayer I don't think that we believe enough in prayer do you really believe that you are a son or a daughter or a daughter or a child of God if you do this scripture is for you and in Isaiah I just read that this scripture these words will not return to God void but they will accomplish that which they which they were intended for I'll read it again brother Jordan if you come and whatsoever you ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the sun if ye shall ask anything in my name I will do it I love that amen one more time shout Jesus from the mountains Jesus in the streams Jesus in the darkness over every enemy Jesus for my family I speak the Holy Name Jesus Jesus your name is power your name is healing your name is life break every stronghold shine through the Shadows burn like fire back there I felt like brother Daniel was going to call me up and I looked at this scripture because it was sort of on my heart and there's three times I think I maybe shared this a little bit with the church years ago but I thought about three different times to pray and just kind of what I felt like the scripture kind of gave us examples of these three different times and the first is in Mark 14 37 and 38 this is Jesus in The Garden of GE Gethsemane and he cometh and findeth them sleeping and saith unto Peter Simon sleepest thou couldest not thou watch one hour watch ye and pray lest you enter into temptation the spirit truly is ready but the flesh is weak and you see these examples through scripture where Christ will pray go alone and pray for an hour or more and I've always felt like that's just that one ton of time to pray where you just dedicate that hour or more and just really seek the Lord the second time or the second type of time to pray I felt like is in Daniel 6 verse 10 through 12 it says now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed he went into his house and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem he kneeled upon his knees three times a day and prayed and gave thanks before his God as he did a four time then these men assembled and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God then they came near and spake before the king concerning the king's decree and it goes on but he took that time three times a day to pray when I was in Dubai it was very striking where they had all the speakers set up or five times a day they would stop and pray I mean talk about the dedication and the last the last time I feel like in the scripture tells us about praying is in Thessalonians 5:17 1 Thessalonians 5:17 says pray without ceasing so just kind of these three examples praying for an hour praying three times a day maybe there that might be a little shorter maybe that's when we pray for our meals but then we just have that heart where we're just always in a mind of prayer let's pray this evening Heavenly Father you know that prayer is probably one of my favorite subjects Lord Lord where we can talk to you our great Creator yes Lord we hear these Miracles and Supernatural things Lord and we hear what brother brandham says about prayer being powerful weapon Lord and it's really just a connection that us as mortal human beings have with you Lord and all these other things while they are wonderful and great lord it's nothing like talking with you and hearing from you lord lord just help us Lord to take and rededicate our lives to you in a way of prayer Lord that would be pleasing and acceptable to you Lord and may we just have more Zeal to talk to you every day in our Our Lives Lord forgive us for where we've fallen short Lord and not done what we should Lord but just help us Lord strengthen us according to your word Lord Lord help each one that's come this evening Lord and keep us all Lord this week Lord give us a good week Lord blessings Lord Lord trial and temptations I'm sure will come to most of us Lord but would you just be there to protect us to lead us and help us through each one Lord thank you for your blessings in our lives Lord Jesus thank you for all that you've done for us Lord we love you we adore you we ask these things in your name our Lord Jesus Christ amen [Music] let's sing that song again I just love to sing about the Lord I just want to speak the name of Jesus over every heart and every mind I know there is peace within your presence I speak [Music] Jesus I just want to speak the name of Jesus till every dark addiction starts to break declaring there is hope and there is freedom I speak Jesus your name is power your name is healing your name is life break every strongo shine through the Shadows burn like a f brothers and sisters I'm sorry I I forgot something and we are going to get a [Music] chance once again to pray brother Jordan sent out a prayer request last night for our dear friend loyal servant of this church brother Kevin Cary he said he's not feeling well he went to the doctor and they say he has bronchitis and he says thank you for your prayers so let's continue to pray for our brother Kevin he's he's been a blessing to this church and he's always working so hard back in the back so when you pray tonight pray for brother Kevin and when I was closing if you'll notice me I don't know if you've ever noticed I almost never will ask one of the officials in the church to close was in prayer but when I was when I was closing I was looking brother Jordan was gone and something ins inside of me said just wait a little bit and have brother Jordan close and he wasn't he wasn't back there and we sang another verse and then our brother came back and then I saw him and I called him up so I believe it was just little things like that it's God's Will and sister hope I believe he hears your prayers I believe he heard your prayer tonight stand strong and he'll he'll answer in his time don't get in front of him he'll answer in his time his ways God bless you brothers and sisters one more time let's let's sing that that verse again brother Michael I just want to speak the name of Jesus over every heart and every mind [Music] cuz I know there is peace
