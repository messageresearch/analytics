[41:11] one of the greatest characters that's
[41:12] ever walked the Earth and one of the
[41:14] reasons because he had a good Mama and a
[41:16] good daddy so we want to dedicate the

[42:21] always teaching you about the Lord Jesus
[42:23] and talking about him well what we do is
[42:26] we bring the
[42:28] kids up to the pulpit and what we're
[42:32] doing is we are we are doing something
[42:36] that was done in the Bible they brought
[42:37] Jesus all the little kids and they

[43:05] kid I was probably about your age my
[43:08] parents brought me to this very pull pit
[43:10] right
[43:11] here and the pastor back then his name
[43:15] was brother Perry green he dedicated me
[43:18] to the Lord Jesus so I want to do that
[43:20] same thing to you all can we do that
[43:26] okay
[43:29] so let's come together and as a church
[43:31] if we could bow our
[43:34] heads Heavenly Father what a great honor
[43:38] it is to dedicate a child to the Lord
[43:41] Jesus and father it's it's even a
[43:44] greater blessing to dedicate children
[43:47] now father we pray that the Holy Spirit
[43:51] would guide these children father and
[43:53] may the prayer that's going up right now
[43:56] always guide them through their lives
[43:58] may they know Jesus Christ and in the
[44:01] power of his
[44:02] resurrection and Lord as they grow and
[44:06] they start making decisions on their own
[44:08] May the Holy Spirit be there for each
[44:10] one of these children to guide them and
[44:13] may father they
[44:15] all grow if you would Terry to be
[44:18] Servants of God and be safely in the
[44:21] bosom of Jesus Christ pray for brother

[44:39] children to you
[44:41] amen amen did you
[44:47] hear good job that was good she said
[44:52] amen
[44:56] sweetheart
[45:05] again we're building a
[45:07] foundation not just in these kids but
[45:11] also in
[45:13] us and every time we get on our knees
[45:16] every time we open our Bible every time
[45:19] we listen to a sermon we're doing our
[45:22] best to shore up that Foundation that we
[45:24] have in our lives I want to thank
[45:27] everybody for the for your patience for
[45:30] all the construction that we have going
[45:32] on it's it's going to
[45:34] continue um it's uh we've been tearing
[45:39] stuff out I appreciate brother Ed and
[45:41] all the work that he's he's seems like
[45:42] he's here all the time and all the work
[45:44] that he's doing we um we've got the
[45:46] walls ripped out we've got um the um the
[45:51] studs put in and we're doing our best to
[45:54] get everything settled and and I want it
[45:57] to be just really nice for
[46:00] us tell you the truth I don't think that
[46:02] we can make it nice enough for this
[46:04] group of people but we're going to do
[46:05] our best to really to make it make it
[46:08] good and one of those things that that
[46:12] I've heard a couple times is talking
[46:15] about these pillars that we have in the
[46:18] fellowship hall and I hear it so much
[46:20] can we get rid of these
[46:22] pillars
[46:24] and further ahead
[46:28] and you know there's something about a
[46:30] pillar in a church and these pillars
[46:35] they're there because they're holding up
[46:39] something and not only are they holding
[46:41] up something but the pillars underneath
[46:43] these pillars when you pour a foundation
[46:46] for a house you pour the slab deeper you
[46:50] make a deeper foot footing and you put
[46:54] Steel in there and and it's It Go goes
[46:57] down deep and you compact it and you put
[46:58] gravel in there and you really take care
[47:02] of where this pillar is going to go
[47:04] because there's going to be a lot of
[47:06] weight that's on the pillar and if you
[47:09] put that pillar over on the regular slab
[47:12] it'll crack and it'll compromise the
[47:15] whole
[47:16] structure and when working with these
[47:19] pillars they carry a lot of weight and
[47:23] we can't just take them out there's
[47:26] there's walls and stuff that that if
[47:28] they're not a loadbearing wall we can
[47:30] take those those walls out they're not
[47:32] that important they're just kind of
[47:34] separating things but there's some walls
[47:37] that are loadbearing and underneath
[47:39] those walls there has to also be a
[47:41] footer so those walls can carry this
[47:44] weight and it's the same with the
[47:46] pillars in the church the
[47:50] people we brothers and sisters you have
[47:53] these pillars they carry a weight
[47:57] and everybody seems to want to be a
[48:00] pillar but I ask you are you carrying
[48:04] any
[48:05] weight are you just
[48:07] there
[48:09] just for looks there's this pan there's
[48:13] by the way there's 12
[48:15] pillars in in the fellowship hall and I
[48:18] thought wow that is so fitting 12
[48:21] pillars 12 tribes 12 Apostles and we
[48:26] have 12 pillars holding up the ceiling
[48:29] over there and but there's there's one
[48:32] pillar over there that if you go in the
[48:35] back and by the drinking fountain it's
[48:37] this big wide pillar and it doesn't hold
[48:40] up anything it's just taken up space and
[48:44] on the other side you look and there's
[48:46] an electrical panel there and I told
[48:48] Brother Ed I said get rid of that pillar
[48:54] because it's not doing anything we can
[48:56] move that that electrical box we can put
[48:58] it on the wall or something and I think
[49:00] it's like it's it's so common even in
[49:04] the church where you have someone they
[49:06] want to be a pillar but they're just
[49:08] taking up space and like I'm the I'm the
[49:10] I'm holding the electrical box anybody
[49:13] can hold that thing so I've asked
[49:15] brother Ed get rid of that thing and uh
[49:18] brother Ed I'd hate to remove your
[49:20] pillar from the the place so make sure
[49:23] you get rid of
[49:25] it I don't like that thing
[49:28] um but this these these pillars like I
[49:33] said they're built on a foundation
[49:35] they're holding up they're holding up
[49:37] the church and so often you see that
[49:42] there's people that come in and they're
[49:46] unstable they're not holding up
[49:49] anything and that man who's unstable he
[49:53] can't stick with something he's he's
[49:57] they're they're cha always chasing
[49:59] someone something else and they never
[50:01] truly find what they're looking
[50:05] for and brothers and sisters we all know
[50:08] that those ones that are unstable they
[50:10] don't have the respect in the church
[50:13] because we all see it we all see it's
[50:17] it's hopping here and hopping there and
[50:20] they're it almost seems like they're
[50:21] looking for the next their next former
[50:25] Church
[50:28] they took you a minute to get that you
[50:31] know what I mean it's here and then
[50:35] they're not stable so then they go to
[50:37] the next place and not stable and the
[50:40] fact is when they're there there's no
[50:42] Foundation there and they're not holding
[50:44] up any
[50:46] weight this church needs to be all of us
[50:50] in this room we need to be pillars
[50:53] brother Jonathan holding up
[50:58] the gospel and holding up the people let
[51:01] me tell you this church is going to
[51:03] continue to
[51:05] grow and as the church grows there's
[51:08] going to be more weight that is placed
[51:12] on the existing structure so that
[51:14] existing structure is going to need more
[51:17] pillars to to hold up the new weight
[51:20] that's in the
[51:24] church and if we don't get that
[51:27] it'll
[51:28] sag it it'll go
[51:31] down the problem with some of these
[51:34] these pillars
[51:35] is most people value really they value
[51:39] their own opinions higher than what the
[51:40] Bible says they get something in their
[51:43] mind and then they're looking for
[51:47] something to to
[51:50] criticize and as soon as they find it
[51:54] off they go to the next
[51:57] place and then they start looking again
[52:02] and as I as I said they're not they're
[52:04] not holding up anything except maybe the
[52:08] the gifts that are in the church they
[52:10] might be holding that up but if they
[52:13] would get right then they would be able
[52:16] to contribute and and to work with all
[52:19] of us and and I'm not talking about the
[52:22] the Tucson Tabernacle I'm talking about
[52:24] this is everywhere in
[52:27] General that's
[52:29] how how things are and and but these
[52:33] pillars that are in the church they're
[52:35] standing on this Solid Ground and
[52:38] they're standing on this fortified
[52:40] concrete below them that concrete's not
[52:42] going to
[52:43] crack that Foundation is
[52:47] solid it's not it's you don't never have
[52:50] to worry about it but if you take a
[52:54] 2x4 and you set it
[52:58] out out in the fellowship hall right
[53:00] there and you leave it you get it to
[53:03] balance there for a little while it's
[53:06] not holding up anything it's not
[53:08] attached to anything and you get a
[53:10] little bit of a breeze you get a little
[53:12] bit of a somebody bumps it and it just
[53:14] Falls right
[53:15] over and that's that fair weather
[53:18] Christian wow there's not there's not
[53:21] that foundational truth that's that's in
[53:25] them
[53:27] and as as I was studying on
[53:30] this you look at the Old Testament and
[53:34] you read you read about the people in
[53:36] the Old Testament and they're an there
[53:39] all through the whole thing all through
[53:41] the 4,000 years they're an unstable
[53:44] people have you ever noticed that
[53:46] there's no converts in the Old
[53:49] Testament very strange huh I mean you
[53:51] might have like Ruth and and uh Rahab a
[53:55] couple of them
[53:57] but there's there's no there's no
[53:59] converts there because there's no
[54:02] stability in the the Old Testament the
[54:05] people are inherently unstable then God
[54:07] would send a prophet or he sent a good
[54:09] King and he'd Shore things up and then
[54:11] as soon as that man died they
[54:13] immediately fall away
[54:16] again there's a phrase that's called
[54:19] from Pillar To Post if you're you're
[54:21] pulled from Pillar To Post and I looked
[54:24] that up and I thought this is really
[54:25] applicable it says that it means that
[54:28] someone is forced to keep moving from
[54:30] one place to another without achieving
[54:33] anything and it's often used to describe
[54:36] a situation where someone is constantly
[54:39] being moved around without any clear
[54:43] direction or
[54:45] purpose it's a sad state to be in I
[54:47] preached um a few weeks ago on walking
[54:51] in
[54:52] darkness and that's what that is there's
[54:54] no light there so you're walk in
[54:56] darkness and you're just bumping into
[54:58] things there you don't have a direction
[55:00] in your life when that direction in our
[55:03] lives should be to fortify and and to to
[55:07] build a pillar and then to hold
[55:10] something
[55:14] up I was been out in my boat before when
[55:17] I had a boat we um be out drifting
[55:20] around and it had an anchor and we we'd
[55:22] throw the anchor out and if that anchor
[55:26] an if it would catch into sand and if
[55:29] there was wind that anchor would just
[55:32] drag along and it would it would slow
[55:35] you down but it would just kind of drag
[55:38] along and and and you'd move and then if
[55:40] it would catch on a rock then then you
[55:44] you had a stable
[55:46] boat and that's how it is with our
[55:48] anchor brothers and sisters when we
[55:49] throw that anchor out it's got to catch
[55:52] into a
[55:53] foundation or we'll drift drift with
[55:56] wind anybody any anchor can hold a boat
[55:59] that there's no
[56:00] wind but when that wind picks up when
[56:05] that when that oak tree when it starts
[56:08] moving back and forth it needs to make
[56:11] sure that that Foundation is
[56:15] true the Apostle Peter said in 1 Peter
[56:19] 510 and I read this last week but the
[56:22] God of all Grace who ha called us unto
[56:25] his eternal
[56:26] Glory by Christ Jesus after that ye have
[56:30] suffered a while make you
[56:33] perfect establish strengthen and settle
[56:37] you to him be glory and Dominion forever
[56:40] and ever amen so we appreciate these
[56:45] hard times as I said in talking about
[56:48] the crucifixion and talking about all
[56:50] the trials and tribulations that we go
[56:54] we go through because it's not the good
[56:56] times that God speaks to us because our
[56:59] ears really aren't tuned into God during
[57:02] the easy times it's when we suffer and
[57:05] when the when the hard times comes
[57:07] that's when we cry out to God and he's
[57:10] always there he's always there to answer
[57:13] us the problem is we don't cry out to
[57:16] him in the easy times so he allows the
[57:18] hard times to come and that's when that
[57:21] Foundation really digs in that's when
[57:24] those roots that we have they really go
[57:27] down strong in what we believe then when
[57:31] the doubts
[57:32] come then we have that strong
[57:36] Foundation brother and sisters we hear
[57:38] so much about our kids about a
[57:43] generation that's leaving the faith that
[57:46] we believe it's it's common it's not
[57:49] just common in our circles it's common
[57:52] all throughout the world and what
[57:55] happens is they have this knowledge that
[57:57] comes
[57:58] in and they can find they can poke holes
[58:02] in things the the kids don't do it but
[58:03] it's the enemy he comes in and he pokes
[58:06] holes in the way that we believe and and
[58:10] then if our foundation isn't strong if
[58:13] we haven't built that Foundation strong
[58:15] in our children then they just leave and
[58:18] then they're just pulled with every wind
[58:20] of
[58:21] Doctrine but a foundation has to be bu
[58:25] built and there's no Foundation that is
[58:28] strong except for Jesus
[58:31] Christ when we build a foundation on
[58:34] something else that foundation cracks
[58:37] that Foundation fails a pillar cannot be
[58:40] built on a weak
[58:44] Foundation my uh my
[58:47] grandpa wheeler told me one time he he
[58:51] said he he saw brother
[58:54] brandom tell
[58:56] this man this man came to brother
[58:58] brandom and he said brother brandom how
[59:01] do I get closer to
[59:04] God how do I really and these are my
[59:06] words how do I really firm up that
[59:09] Foundation brother brandom pointed over
[59:12] at a man named FF
[59:15] Bosworth he said and he told this I
[59:18] think I believe it was a minister that
[59:19] was seeking that that closer walk with
[59:22] the Lord he said go and sit under that
[59:26] oak tree for a while meaning FF Bosworth
[59:29] FF Bosworth was a famous evangelist in
[59:32] the early 1900s he was here um he was
[59:35] there at zza Street
[59:36] Revival strong man wrote the book Christ
[59:39] the Healer a book that has has been a
[59:42] blessing to so many people and caused so
[59:44] many people to receive their healing
[59:47] brother brandom tells him go sit under
[59:50] him for a
[59:54] while God's desire
[59:56] brothers and sisters is for his Temple
[59:58] to be built with Christ the Chief
[1:00:02] Cornerstone and the doctrines of the
[1:00:05] Apostles as the
[1:00:07] foundation when brother brandham had the
[1:00:09] vision of going beyond the curtain of
[1:00:12] time he
[1:00:14] um he asked the man he said would Paul
[1:00:19] be gathered with his
[1:00:21] people and and the man said the man said
[1:00:24] yes he said Paul would be gathered with
[1:00:27] his people and brother brandom said I
[1:00:29] preached the same thing that Paul
[1:00:31] preached and remember the people said we
[1:00:34] are resting on that what is that message
[1:00:38] that Paul
[1:00:39] preached what is it it's Jesus Christ
[1:00:43] and that foundation and any other
[1:00:46] foundation will
[1:00:48] fail I've heard so
[1:00:51] much people will ask
[1:00:54] you or us how we believe and we'll
[1:00:58] immediately start talking about the
[1:01:04] message brothers and sisters you got to
[1:01:07] have
[1:01:08] Roots what are the roots that were in
[1:01:11] the message when brother brandham
[1:01:12] preached it it was Jesus Christ brother
[1:01:16] brandom's Foundation was in Christ it
[1:01:18] wasn't in
[1:01:20] himself and we see our children do our
[1:01:24] children see that do they see that that
[1:01:26] strength that we have that I am Anchored
[1:01:29] In Jesus
[1:01:32] Christ do we know do they see our
[1:01:36] experience do they see what the message
[1:01:39] what going to church what believing has
[1:01:42] done in our
[1:01:44] lives and then we can say what here's
[1:01:48] what it'll do in your life remember when
[1:01:51] Samson when he wanted to tear down all
[1:01:56] the
[1:01:56] Philistines he was his eyes were gouged
[1:01:59] out his hair was cut he was at the
[1:02:01] lowest point of his life and he tells
[1:02:04] this kid he knows that they have this
[1:02:06] big Stadium full of all these
[1:02:08] Philistines as enemies and the enemy of
[1:02:10] God's
[1:02:11] people and he says bring me to the
[1:02:16] pillars that hold up the
[1:02:19] structure because he knew that if he
[1:02:22] could get to the pillars that he would
[1:02:25] destroy destroy the whole thing and
[1:02:28] bring everybody down with it so Samson
[1:02:31] wins he gets in there and he grabs these
[1:02:34] pillars tears them down and down comes
[1:02:37] the whole thing and Satan knows the same
[1:02:40] lessons if he can get to the pillars
[1:02:44] that are in the
[1:02:45] church then he can do a lot of damage I
[1:02:49] was just talking with brother Josiah in
[1:02:50] the
[1:02:53] back and I was telling him do you
[1:02:56] understand the responsibility that we
[1:02:58] have in going before the
[1:03:01] people do you
[1:03:03] understand in ministering and singing
[1:03:07] songs of worship do you understand that
[1:03:11] it makes us pillars in the church that
[1:03:14] people are relying on and then if our
[1:03:17] pillars aren't strong if our foundations
[1:03:19] aren't strong it doesn't just hurt us
[1:03:22] it'll hurt the whole
[1:03:24] congregation it'll hurt your
[1:03:27] families if your foundation is not
[1:03:30] strong do you know it's not just
[1:03:33] you it's your whole
[1:03:36] family that will
[1:03:38] suffer if your foundation cracks or if
[1:03:41] or or if your pillar isn't strong enough
[1:03:46] it'll bring down the whole structure on
[1:03:47] top of you all of us need to be holding
[1:03:50] up something if we're not holding up
[1:03:52] something then we're not doing
[1:03:54] anything
[1:03:56] you got to take
[1:03:58] root Revelation chapter
[1:04:02] 21 I'll read verse 14 it says this
[1:04:06] talking about the Heavenly City this
[1:04:09] great place with streets of gold and and
[1:04:12] and a place that we all long to be
[1:04:15] because Jesus Christ will be there there
[1:04:17] won't be a
[1:04:19] son the lamb will be the light it's
[1:04:22] going to be the most beautiful wonderful
[1:04:24] place in the world world and around this
[1:04:27] city is this giant
[1:04:31] wall and it's over 200 feet
[1:04:35] tall amazing you know how big Trump's
[1:04:37] wall is the border wall it's 30
[1:04:41] feet this one's 200 feet
[1:04:44] tall and I don't know there's a lot of
[1:04:47] things that if this is an actual
[1:04:52] structure then it's going to have to
[1:04:54] have some am
[1:04:56] amazing foundations to hold this wall up
[1:05:00] the um the structure for Trump's wall
[1:05:02] the the the Footers are like 6 to 10
[1:05:04] feet deep of of concrete fortified
[1:05:08] concrete this one 30 feet this one's 200
[1:05:13] feet imagine the
[1:05:16] foundations verse 14 says this and the
[1:05:20] wall of the city had 12 foundations and
[1:05:25] in them with the names of the 12
[1:05:27] Apostles of the
[1:05:29] Lamb this wall is higher than a 25 story
[1:05:35] building and the foundations in this
[1:05:38] wall are
[1:05:40] built on the doctrine and the built on
[1:05:44] the ministry of these Apostles so look
[1:05:46] at how important it is so so as we are
[1:05:49] deciding Lord do I want to serve you do
[1:05:52] I want to be a Christian the things that
[1:05:54] we look at are these these doctrines
[1:05:56] that have been set forth in the
[1:06:02] Bible so the
[1:06:04] foundational
[1:06:07] sermon of a
[1:06:09] Christian happened in Acts chapter
[1:06:12] 2 it's the first Christian sermon ever
[1:06:16] preached and it was preached by a man
[1:06:19] that had just received the baptism of
[1:06:22] the Holy Ghost tremendous tremendous
[1:06:25] Story So what had happened is is they
[1:06:28] had they were following Jesus's
[1:06:30] Commandments it was about 50 days after
[1:06:33] his crucifixion and then about 10 days
[1:06:36] after he had ascended up in heaven and
[1:06:39] they're there and they're waiting for
[1:06:40] this promise that God that Jesus had
[1:06:43] given them and then the Holy Spirit
[1:06:45] Falls and let's read it acts chap 2
[1:06:48] vers1 says this and when the day of
[1:06:51] Pentecost was fully come they were all
[1:06:53] with one Accord in one place and
[1:06:55] suddenly there came a sound from Heaven
[1:06:57] as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it
[1:06:59] filled all the house where they were
[1:07:01] sitting and there appeared unto them
[1:07:03] clothing tongues like like as a fire and
[1:07:06] it sat upon each of them and they were
[1:07:08] all filled with the Holy Ghost and began
[1:07:09] to speak with other tongues as the
[1:07:12] spirit gave them utterance brother
[1:07:15] Wilson it's important this tongu is
[1:07:17] important it's a
[1:07:20] sign and there were dwelling at
[1:07:23] Jerusalem Jews devout men out of every
[1:07:26] nation under heaven and when this was
[1:07:29] noised abroad the multitude came
[1:07:31] together and were confounded because
[1:07:34] that every man heard them speak in his
[1:07:36] own language so this is something really
[1:07:39] strange that had never happened before
[1:07:42] and when the Holy Spirit descended on
[1:07:44] the disciples in the upper room they
[1:07:47] began to speak in other
[1:07:49] languages and it was a sign that God was
[1:07:52] doing something
[1:07:54] supernaturally and importantly it had a
[1:07:58] purpose the ones that
[1:08:00] heard the
[1:08:03] disciples they heard them speaking in
[1:08:05] their own language and they thought it
[1:08:07] was really strange this was an outward
[1:08:12] display it was to show that the
[1:08:14] supernatural nature of God was being
[1:08:17] manifested in this book of in this gift
[1:08:19] of tongues Now 1 Corinthians tells us
[1:08:23] that now we we want be careful and how
[1:08:26] that we speak in tongues and and that we
[1:08:29] don't want to just be up there and
[1:08:31] speaking in in meaningless words because
[1:08:33] a visitor would come in and be like
[1:08:34] what's going on this is weird I've
[1:08:37] talked to people that have been in
[1:08:38] services like that they've gone and and
[1:08:41] they've the the people up there were
[1:08:43] were speaking in tongues they were like
[1:08:44] what in the world this is weird I'm not
[1:08:47] going to come back to
[1:08:48] this just manifested the same thing that
[1:08:51] that is saying
[1:08:53] here but with these tongues it had a
[1:08:57] purpose to show the power of God there
[1:09:00] and they were all amazed and marveled
[1:09:02] saying one to another behold are not all
[1:09:04] these which speak
[1:09:06] galileans how we hear how hear we every
[1:09:10] man in our own tongue wherein we were
[1:09:13] born parthians and mes and Elites and
[1:09:16] the Dwellers in Mesopotamia and in Judea
[1:09:19] and in capid doia and in pontis and Asia
[1:09:23] and Fria and pamilia
[1:09:26] in Egypt and in in the parts of Libya
[1:09:29] about sirene and strangers of Rome Jews
[1:09:32] and prelit cits and Arabians we do hear
[1:09:35] them speak in our tongues the wonderful
[1:09:38] works of God so the author here Luke is
[1:09:41] documenting all the different languages
[1:09:43] he wants to make sure we know this is a
[1:09:44] lot of different
[1:09:46] languages and they were all
[1:09:48] amazed and we're in doubt saying one to
[1:09:51] another what mean is this the super what
[1:09:53] happened is the supernatural got their
[1:09:55] attention now here is the sermon the
[1:10:01] foundational truth of Christianity the
[1:10:04] first sermon but Peter standing up with
[1:10:09] the 11 lifted up his voice and said unto
[1:10:12] them ye men of Judea and all that dwell
[1:10:14] in Jerusalem be this known unto you and
[1:10:17] hearken to my
[1:10:18] words this Peter is the man who was with
[1:10:21] Jesus when Jesus asked this question
[1:10:24] Jesus said
[1:10:25] who does everyone say that I
[1:10:30] am they said they said some say that
[1:10:33] they are Elias some say that they're
[1:10:35] John the Baptist but then Simon Peter
[1:10:38] answered in Matthew chapter 16 ver1
[1:10:42] 16 Jesus said to him he said who do you
[1:10:45] say that I am and Simon Peter answered
[1:10:48] and said Thou Art the Christ the son of
[1:10:50] the Living God and Jesus answered and
[1:10:53] said unto him blessed art thou son Simon
[1:10:56] bar Jonah for Flesh and Blood hath not
[1:10:58] revealed it unto thee but my Father
[1:11:00] which is in
[1:11:02] heaven and I say also unto thee Thou Art
[1:11:05] Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my
[1:11:10] church and the Gates of Hell shall not
[1:11:11] Prevail against it so that was back here
[1:11:14] a year or so earlier Peter showed that
[1:11:16] he had the revelation of who Jesus was
[1:11:18] and Jesus was going to build the church
[1:11:21] on his Revelation but the church wasn't
[1:11:24] built at that time yet
[1:11:26] God was deepening that foundation in the
[1:11:29] apostles he was putting steel in there
[1:11:31] he was he was putting the concrete in
[1:11:33] there he was pouring the footer he was
[1:11:34] thickening that concrete because there
[1:11:36] was something that was to
[1:11:38] come and Peter and his disciples didn't
[1:11:40] have it yet they weren't holding
[1:11:43] anything up
[1:11:45] yet and Jesus says to Peter and I will
[1:11:47] give thee give unto thee key the Keys of
[1:11:50] the Kingdom of Heaven and whatsoever
[1:11:52] Thou shalt bind on Earth shall be bound
[1:11:54] in heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt
[1:11:57] loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven
[1:12:00] so once this Foundation is built then I
[1:12:03] will make you a pillar in the church
[1:12:05] then you will do Mighty Works in my name
[1:12:08] then whatever you bind on Earth I will
[1:12:10] bind in heaven but not now you're not
[1:12:12] ready yet he was just building this
[1:12:20] Foundation verse 15 in Acts chapter
[1:12:24] 2
[1:12:27] and
[1:12:28] Peter is addressing the people again he
[1:12:30] says for these are not drunken as you
[1:12:32] suppose seeing it is but the third hour
[1:12:34] of the day but this is that which was
[1:12:36] spoken by the prophet Joel now the
[1:12:39] Apostle he's a pillar now he's filled
[1:12:43] with the Holy
[1:12:45] Spirit and he's talking about this
[1:12:48] Foundation that was laid and I want you
[1:12:50] to notice something that Peter did Peter
[1:12:54] said this is that which was spoken of by
[1:12:55] the prophet Joel how did Peter know that
[1:12:57] Joel said
[1:12:58] that he was reading his Bible he was
[1:13:02] studying the
[1:13:03] word and now he's going to quote Joel
[1:13:06] remember this had just happened he had
[1:13:08] just came out and he says listen this is
[1:13:10] what the prophet was talking about this
[1:13:13] is prophecy
[1:13:16] fulfilled and it and now Peter quotes
[1:13:19] Joel he says and it shall come to pass
[1:13:20] in the last days saith God I will pour
[1:13:22] out of my spirit upon All Flesh and your
[1:13:25] sons and your daughters shall prophesy
[1:13:27] and your young men shall see visions and
[1:13:29] your old men shall dream dreams and on
[1:13:31] my servants and on my handmaids I will
[1:13:33] pour out in those days of my spirit and
[1:13:36] they shall prophesy and I will show
[1:13:38] wonders in heaven and signs in the earth
[1:13:40] beneath blood and fire and Vapor of
[1:13:43] smoke the sun shall be turned into
[1:13:45] darkness and the moon into blood before
[1:13:47] the great and notable day of the Lord
[1:13:49] come so Peter here he's still qu he's
[1:13:52] still quoting the prophet Joel and
[1:13:54] darkness had just spread across the
[1:13:56] earth when Jesus was on the
[1:14:00] cross might have been a solar eclipse
[1:14:02] like coming in the United States
[1:14:05] soon I don't know if there was a lunar
[1:14:07] eclipse back
[1:14:09] then or if that time is to come or if it
[1:14:13] happened then and it's going to happen
[1:14:14] now but Peter's reading from the prophet
[1:14:17] and he knew through the holy spirit that
[1:14:19] this is that which what which was spoken
[1:14:21] of by the prophet
[1:14:23] Joel if you always in the word brothers
[1:14:26] and sisters and you're always praying
[1:14:27] and you're always calling on the name of
[1:14:29] the Lord then I believe that when
[1:14:30] prophecies come to
[1:14:32] pass we're always trying we're always
[1:14:35] trying to interpret proper prophecies
[1:14:38] we're always saying oh well brother
[1:14:40] brandham said this so so this is going
[1:14:42] to happen and we're always trying to
[1:14:43] figure out all of these things but let
[1:14:46] me tell you that when you will know when
[1:14:49] prophecy comes to pass when you know the
[1:14:51] interpretation of Prophecy is when it
[1:14:53] happens and if if you're in the word
[1:14:56] then you can say this is that which was
[1:14:58] spoken of by the prophet and it shall
[1:15:01] come to pass that whosoever shall call
[1:15:02] on the name of the Lord shall be
[1:15:05] saved that's what I want to concentrate
[1:15:08] that's what I want you to leave today
[1:15:10] remembering is that statement that Peter
[1:15:13] said right there there's no
[1:15:15] denomination here there's no sect
[1:15:19] there's no division of Christianity pet
[1:15:22] Peter is plainly saying that this was
[1:15:26] written by the prophet about the Lord
[1:15:31] Jesus and I ask the
[1:15:34] congregation really how many of us have
[1:15:38] truly called on the name of the Lord for
[1:15:41] our
[1:15:43] Salvation what an important
[1:15:47] thing that promise was given to
[1:15:49] us call on the name of the Lord I hear
[1:15:54] so much people say they'll witness and
[1:15:56] say well I have Jesus in my heart well
[1:15:59] that's
[1:16:00] good you know the Buddhist is gonna say
[1:16:02] well I have Buddha in my heart the
[1:16:04] muslim's going to say well I have aw in
[1:16:07] my heart and he tells me that Muhammad
[1:16:08] is his
[1:16:10] Prophet the Mormon's going to say well I
[1:16:13] have heavenly father in my heart and he
[1:16:15] tells I had a burning in my bosom
[1:16:18] that that Joseph Smith was his prophet
[1:16:20] in the Book of Mormon is
[1:16:23] true it doesn't hold a lot of weight but
[1:16:27] when you say that Jesus Christ died for
[1:16:31] my
[1:16:33] sins a Hindu can't say
[1:16:36] that Buddhist can't say that nobody can
[1:16:40] say that Jesus Christ died for their
[1:16:42] sins except for a
[1:16:45] Christian and I can and you and I can
[1:16:49] cry out to Jesus Christ and we will be
[1:16:53] saved there is the Foundation of
[1:17:03] Christianity and brothers and
[1:17:05] sisters when we believe the word on an
[1:17:10] intellectual
[1:17:12] basis when we can take the
[1:17:15] Bible and we can say well here's what I
[1:17:18] believe if you look to Malachi CH
[1:17:21] 4 and then you go over here to
[1:17:23] Revelation 10
[1:17:26] and look at all of these
[1:17:28] things and doesn't this make
[1:17:32] sense that's an intellectual
[1:17:35] understanding and if it comes on an
[1:17:37] intellectual basis it can leave on an
[1:17:41] intellectual
[1:17:43] basis so that's not where it's
[1:17:48] at otherwise you know you're just
[1:17:50] convincing somebody to believe like you
[1:17:52] because it makes sense but when you
[1:17:54] really call out to the on the name of
[1:17:56] the Lord and he answers then it's
[1:18:00] something different then it's
[1:18:04] real when someone asks you what you
[1:18:07] believe you know when they ask you what
[1:18:09] the message is I hope you don't start
[1:18:11] rattling off a bunch of scriptures and
[1:18:13] give some apologetic type of answer
[1:18:15] they'll give you the same answer as a
[1:18:17] Mormon or whatever it
[1:18:19] is say this man showed me a living Jesus
[1:18:23] Christ this man showed me that Jesus
[1:18:26] Christ healed the sick this man showed
[1:18:29] me that Jesus Christ saves the lost this
[1:18:32] man showed me that Jesus is
[1:18:35] real that is something that will
[1:18:38] stick it doesn't lessen anybody's
[1:18:42] Ministry if you're talking about the
[1:18:44] Tucson Tabernacle I would hope that you
[1:18:46] would say that brother Daniel has showed
[1:18:48] me that Jesus Christ is my savior and
[1:18:51] now I believe in
[1:18:53] him
[1:18:57] like a blind man with Jesus you know he
[1:19:00] said the blind man got healed and then
[1:19:03] they they went to the blind man and they
[1:19:04] said hey come over here he said they
[1:19:06] said you know the man that did this he's
[1:19:09] a
[1:19:10] sinner blind man said he said well
[1:19:14] whether he's a sinner or not I don't
[1:19:16] know but what I do know is once I was
[1:19:19] blind and now I can see and that's the
[1:19:21] same that I feel with brother brandom
[1:19:24] and his
[1:19:26] message it's
[1:19:28] real that's the same thing that I feel
[1:19:30] it's like you know what I don't care
[1:19:32] what you say I really don't care what
[1:19:34] you say about him what I see is once I
[1:19:37] was blind and now I see once I didn't
[1:19:41] understand that God is alive today and
[1:19:44] that he heals the sick but my own
[1:19:47] grandparents people that I know were
[1:19:50] healed in his meetings so really I
[1:19:53] really don't care what you
[1:19:56] say he introduced us to a living Jesus
[1:20:00] Christ but it's about Jesus and that's
[1:20:03] the
[1:20:05] mistake that's what we need brothers and
[1:20:07] sisters we need to have that foundation
[1:20:10] in
[1:20:11] Christ I heard a story about this nurse
[1:20:14] that works with
[1:20:16] Daniel she went to school a little bit
[1:20:18] later in life um and she's recently
[1:20:22] graduated from nursing her first husband
[1:20:25] died when she was young second husband
[1:20:28] was a drug
[1:20:30] dealer he went to jail and she had a dad
[1:20:34] that really loved her dad was a truck
[1:20:36] driver he helped her take care of the
[1:20:38] take care of her kids and just just
[1:20:40] really looked after his daughter loving
[1:20:44] dad and she gets a call and her dad was
[1:20:49] at work and he has a heart attack the
[1:20:52] EMS come to the scene and he's collapsed
[1:20:55] and they're working on him on the ground
[1:20:57] they're doing CPR on
[1:20:59] him and they tried to resuscitate him
[1:21:03] for 31
[1:21:05] minutes and if you're any type of a if
[1:21:08] you know any type of Health Care you
[1:21:10] know that 31 minutes without oxygen to
[1:21:13] your brain it's you're you're
[1:21:15] done
[1:21:17] so they they get him into the
[1:21:20] ambulance and they bring him take off to
[1:21:23] go to the hospital hospital this lady
[1:21:25] her name is Stephanie she gets in her
[1:21:27] car and she starts driving to go to the
[1:21:30] hospital and she tells Daniel she says I
[1:21:33] don't know if I was praying or what was
[1:21:35] going on or I was talking to God and she
[1:21:38] was thinking about all these bad things
[1:21:39] that are happening remember what I said
[1:21:41] last week that it's the darkest time
[1:21:43] that God speaks to
[1:21:46] you she finds
[1:21:48] herself on the side of the
[1:21:51] road an hour and a half later she
[1:21:54] doesn't know what
[1:21:56] happened she gets she comes to herself
[1:22:00] she drives to the
[1:22:04] hospital she gets there remember her dad
[1:22:08] is basically
[1:22:10] dead there's no way that someone that
[1:22:13] was gone for that long no matter how
[1:22:14] much you work on them there's no way
[1:22:16] that that they can be at least
[1:22:19] normal
[1:22:22] she was outside by herself
[1:22:25] self she leaned up against the
[1:22:29] wall and she started
[1:22:32] praying this is a lady that probably
[1:22:34] didn't know the Lord before she leans
[1:22:37] against the wall and and she starts
[1:22:42] praying
[1:22:44] and she looks
[1:22:48] down
[1:22:51] and she um I want to make sure I get the
[1:22:55] story
[1:22:59] right yeah she's leaning I don't know if
[1:23:01] she was praying she's leaning against
[1:23:02] the
[1:23:03] wall and she's thinking about everything
[1:23:06] that's going on imagine what she was
[1:23:08] what was going on in her mind that her
[1:23:10] dad who is taking care of her she didn't
[1:23:11] have a husband she she has these kids
[1:23:13] she doesn't know what to do she's
[1:23:15] leaning there and she's she looks down
[1:23:18] and there's another set of feet next to
[1:23:23] her
[1:23:25] and she feels a hand on her
[1:23:29] shoulder and she hears a
[1:23:32] voice and your dad the voice says your
[1:23:35] dad's going to be
[1:23:38] okay so you know what to think she she
[1:23:41] walks in the
[1:23:43] hospital she goes into the
[1:23:46] room and there's her dad sitting up in
[1:23:50] the bed with his suction tube swinging
[1:23:52] it
[1:23:53] around
[1:24:01] he's alive today still taking care of
[1:24:04] his daughter and these kids right
[1:24:08] there that woman met Jesus Christ that
[1:24:14] Foundation was built and you try to take
[1:24:16] that away from her wow no way she had an
[1:24:20] experience she had built that Foundation
[1:24:22] now she's a pillar
[1:24:24] and she is able to hold up other people
[1:24:27] wow Hallelujah she was in she was in a
[1:24:29] the um the room the other day with this
[1:24:32] man that was dying and she asks him what
[1:24:37] better thing could you ask someone ask
[1:24:40] when they are a pillar in God's Church
[1:24:43] they have had an experience that
[1:24:44] Foundation is firm she asks the man she
[1:24:47] says do you know this man was dying do
[1:24:51] you know Jesus
[1:24:52] Christ man said no
[1:24:57] so she goes
[1:25:00] back man
[1:25:03] dies so she tells Daniel now listen to
[1:25:06] how a Christian
[1:25:09] thinks she tells Dan Daniel she said but
[1:25:12] even though that he said that he still
[1:25:14] wasn't dead yet there was still time and
[1:25:17] she says I don't know maybe he did
[1:25:19] believe in
[1:25:20] Jesus before he died she said I believe
[1:25:22] he did that's the heart of a Christian
[1:25:26] there's always hope in a Christian but
[1:25:29] this woman this Stephanie she has a
[1:25:31] foundation she has those roots because
[1:25:33] she had that experience and that's with
[1:25:36] these disciples that's with a pillar a
[1:25:38] pillar in a church it can hold up weight
[1:25:41] because it has that Foundation it had an
[1:25:43] experience with
[1:25:46] God back to acts
[1:25:49] 22 acts
[1:25:51] 2:22 Peter continues on he says ye men
[1:25:54] of Israel hear these words Jesus of
[1:25:57] Nazareth a man approved of God among you
[1:25:59] by Miracles and wonders and signs which
[1:26:01] God did by him in the midst of you as
[1:26:04] you yourself
[1:26:05] know they were there when Jesus did the
[1:26:08] Miracles they saw it they knew that
[1:26:11] there was something real and here is
[1:26:12] Peter and he's saying listen he was real
[1:26:15] I'm a testimony that he's real him being
[1:26:17] delivered by the determinant counsel and
[1:26:19] forn knowledge of God you have taken and
[1:26:22] by Wicked hand you have crucified and
[1:26:23] slain
[1:26:24] whom God has raised up having Loos the
[1:26:27] Pains of death because it was not
[1:26:29] possible that he should be Holden of it
[1:26:32] you've sinned in your life you've lied
[1:26:34] you've
[1:26:36] sto but this Jesus Christ can make it
[1:26:39] right for time sake let's skip to to
[1:26:42] verse
[1:26:42] 32 this Jesus hath God raised up whereof
[1:26:46] we are all Witnesses therefore being by
[1:26:50] the right hand of God exalted and having
[1:26:52] received of the Father by the promise of
[1:26:54] the holy ghost He hath shed forth this
[1:26:57] which ye now see and hear there were
[1:27:01] Witnesses
[1:27:03] living testimonies of Jesus Christ for
[1:27:06] David is not ascended into Heavens but
[1:27:08] he saith himself the Lord said unto my
[1:27:10] Lord sit thou on my right hand until I
[1:27:13] make thy FS thy foot stol therefore let
[1:27:16] all the house of Israel know assuredly
[1:27:18] that God hath made the same Jesus whom
[1:27:20] you have crucified whom you sinned
[1:27:23] against
[1:27:24] who you've
[1:27:25] disrespected who you really didn't care
[1:27:27] about both Lord and Christ imagine how
[1:27:30] these people felt at that time there was
[1:27:34] something in their hearts that believed
[1:27:38] what Peter was saying in this church
[1:27:39] about this man
[1:27:40] Christ because his foundation was real
[1:27:44] and they probably wanted that same
[1:27:47] Foundation now when they heard this they
[1:27:50] were pricked in their heart they were
[1:27:52] cut in their heart and and they said
[1:27:54] unto P people unto Peter and to the rest
[1:27:57] of the Apostles men and Brethren what
[1:27:59] shall we
[1:28:02] do brothers and sisters there's no
[1:28:04] repentance today very very little in the
[1:28:08] world today I think just the way we grow
[1:28:10] up in this generation you see very few
[1:28:12] people that are really sorry that really
[1:28:14] feel bad what they
[1:28:19] do I hear so much well I'm the bride I
[1:28:22] believe the message we're special we're
[1:28:24] the elite because we have a prophet if
[1:28:26] you had a prophet then you should know
[1:28:29] better then you should respect Jesus you
[1:28:32] should listen to what this man
[1:28:35] said so I look and I say where is this
[1:28:38] repentance today where are the pillars
[1:28:40] of the church where are those who will
[1:28:45] repent we live in this age this last age
[1:28:50] we call it the Leo Leo toan age
[1:28:54] let's read what it says about leoa
[1:28:56] Revelation
[1:28:59] 3:14 and unto the angel of the Church of
[1:29:02] the Leo Deans write these things sayith
[1:29:04] the amen the faithful and the true
[1:29:06] witness the beginning of the creation of
[1:29:08] God this is Jesus Christ himself talking
[1:29:11] I Know Thy works that thou art neither
[1:29:14] cold nor hot I would that thou W cold or
[1:29:17] hot and you really don't believe you
[1:29:20] just got a rule book you just Define
[1:29:23] yourself
[1:29:24] wow with certain doctrines and certain
[1:29:27] things you pick and choose what you
[1:29:30] believe by your life style and then
[1:29:33] that's what you believe
[1:29:36] wow then so then because Thou Art
[1:29:40] lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will
[1:29:43] spew thee out of my mouth you make me
[1:29:45] sick is what God's saying you make me
[1:29:47] want to
[1:29:49] vomit because thou sayest I am rich and
[1:29:52] increased with Goods
[1:29:55] and have need of nothing and knowest
[1:29:57] thou not that thou art wretched and
[1:29:59] miserable and poor and blind and
[1:30:03] naked but you say I'm rich and increased
[1:30:06] with goods and I have need of nothing
[1:30:09] who do you hear say
[1:30:11] that maybe
[1:30:13] us we don't need anything more we got a
[1:30:16] prophet we're bride we're good
[1:30:18] everything's good we're just waiting for
[1:30:20] this world to burn so we can walk out on
[1:30:21] the ashes of the wicked that attitude
[1:30:25] defines the Leo Dean age it defines the
[1:30:27] Leo Dean
[1:30:29] Spirit where is the crying out to God
[1:30:32] for Mercy where is the crying out and
[1:30:35] calling upon the name of the Lord where
[1:30:37] is
[1:30:41] that you know we've
[1:30:45] got you know I heard a brother preaching
[1:30:47] the other day against pool halls and
[1:30:49] honky pool halls and honky
[1:30:52] ton I'm 52 I don't even know what a Hony
[1:30:55] talkon
[1:30:57] is he's living back in 1950 and and this
[1:31:01] brother was
[1:31:02] young he's just listening to what he
[1:31:06] hears he's just listening to things he's
[1:31:08] not able to apply it to this day we live
[1:31:12] in another
[1:31:14] day we live in a day when this has
[1:31:18] taking our time we live in a day as I
[1:31:21] said when it's all distractions to do
[1:31:24] everything that you can to keep your
[1:31:26] mind that Satan does to keep your mind
[1:31:28] off of of Christ and it's a lazy
[1:31:31] generation when people stopped working
[1:31:33] they're not willing to get out and look
[1:31:35] for a job and then stick to a job
[1:31:37] remember the pillar in
[1:31:39] there it's just back and forth and here
[1:31:43] and
[1:31:44] there they move from job to job they
[1:31:46] move from church to church they're not
[1:31:48] willing to D to put down roots and to do
[1:31:52] something and to hold somebody up that's
[1:31:55] right Bible says if a man doesn't work
[1:31:57] he shouldn't
[1:31:59] eat and then we hear we people think
[1:32:02] they they are
[1:32:04] entitled this is the generation that we
[1:32:06] live in this wasn't the generation
[1:32:09] sister Shirley 60 70 years ago that was
[1:32:12] not the problem back then but we have to
[1:32:14] be able to move
[1:32:17] forward and to take what we have heard
[1:32:19] to take the prophet's
[1:32:21] words and apply them to today
[1:32:27] brother brandom let me quote brother
[1:32:29] brandom blind leod
[1:32:36] Deans and again I said we're the
[1:32:40] elect but the Bible says that no that's
[1:32:44] not the case the Bible says that it's
[1:32:47] blindness and nakedness and they don't
[1:32:49] know it Verse 18 I counsel thee to buy
[1:32:51] of me gold tried in the fire that thou
[1:32:53] mayest be rich and white with right
[1:32:55] white rment that thou mayest be clothed
[1:32:58] and that the shame of thy nakedness do
[1:32:59] not appear and anoint thine eyes with
[1:33:01] eyes have that thou mayest see as many
[1:33:04] as I love I
[1:33:06] rebuke and chasen thank God for those
[1:33:09] low times I'm sure that that that nurse
[1:33:13] Stephanie will look back and say thank
[1:33:15] God that I had to go through
[1:33:18] that because my life is different now
[1:33:20] now I have a foundation now she said I
[1:33:23] am a
[1:33:25] Christian you couldn't call me a better
[1:33:28] thing as many as I love I rebuke and
[1:33:31] chasen be zealous therefore and
[1:33:35] repent behold I stand at the door and
[1:33:38] knock and if any man hear my voice and
[1:33:41] open the door I will come into him and
[1:33:43] will Su with him and he with me brother
[1:33:45] Braham said that's the saddest scripture
[1:33:47] in the entire Bible right there there is
[1:33:50] Jesus knocking at the door for his
[1:33:53] people and we've got too much we've got
[1:33:55] our religion we've got everything that
[1:33:57] we need we don't need anymore I got it
[1:34:00] I'm good everything's good and he's no
[1:34:03] you're
[1:34:04] not no you're
[1:34:09] not to him that overcometh will I grant
[1:34:12] to sit with me in my in my throne even
[1:34:14] as I also overcame and I'm sat down with
[1:34:17] my father and his throne he that hath an
[1:34:18] ear let him let him hear what the spirit
[1:34:22] saith and the churches the Leo toan age
[1:34:25] right here among
[1:34:29] us and we'll finish
[1:34:32] up back to Acts 2 let's read 237
[1:34:37] again Peter's preaching his message and
[1:34:40] when they heard this they were pricked
[1:34:42] in their heart and they said unto Peter
[1:34:44] and to the rest of the Apostles men and
[1:34:45] Brethren what shall we
[1:34:47] do remember this is a foundation of
[1:34:50] Christianity this is a first sermon that
[1:34:51] was preached and it's just as true today
[1:34:54] as it was then the devil tries to change
[1:34:58] it tries to tries to make it about some
[1:35:01] Doctrine or some some different sect of
[1:35:05] of of a religion but it's always the
[1:35:08] same and thank God that he recorded his
[1:35:10] this sermon in his book because we can
[1:35:13] go back to it and say here's what we do
[1:35:16] here is the
[1:35:17] prescription here's the
[1:35:19] directions when you say that I'm
[1:35:22] struggling when you say that I want to
[1:35:23] give my heart to the Lord Jesus it's the
[1:35:26] same every time we can go right back
[1:35:29] here to this first sermon to this
[1:35:35] foundation and when they were pricked in
[1:35:37] their heart and said unto Peter and the
[1:35:39] rest of the the apostles men and
[1:35:41] Brethren what shall we do and Peter said
[1:35:43] unto them
[1:35:45] repent something that's so rare as I
[1:35:48] said today is that true repentance that
[1:35:50] true sorrow that true commitment Lord I
[1:35:53] am going to to change I am going to go
[1:35:55] back I'm going to serve
[1:35:56] you and be baptized every one of you in
[1:36:01] the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:36:03] remission of
[1:36:05] sins so you're
[1:36:07] repenting your heart is hurting because
[1:36:11] you've failed because you've sinned
[1:36:14] you've done something
[1:36:16] wrong so
[1:36:20] repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:36:23] Jesus Christ Christ for the remission of
[1:36:25] that sin for the remission of those sins
[1:36:28] for the taking away of those sins and
[1:36:30] then you shall receive the gift of the
[1:36:34] Holy Ghost Peter had just been filled
[1:36:36] and he said now you can have what I
[1:36:39] have now receive it it's that simple
[1:36:43] it's not jumping through all these hoops
[1:36:45] it's not going going through all this
[1:36:46] weird doctrines it is this very thing
[1:36:49] call out in the call on the name of the
[1:36:52] Lord for This Promise is unto
[1:36:56] you and to your children and to all that
[1:36:58] are far off even as many as the Lord Our
[1:37:01] God shall
[1:37:03] call look brother Josiah and and the
[1:37:06] musicians can
[1:37:08] come back to the pillars that are in the
[1:37:11] church this this man was a
[1:37:14] pillar Jesus said I will build my church
[1:37:17] on what on the revelation of who Jesus
[1:37:21] Christ is when he said Thou Art the
[1:37:23] Christ the son of the Living God God
[1:37:25] Peter or Jesus said Peter Flesh and
[1:37:28] Blood hasn't revealed this to you my
[1:37:30] father which is in heaven has revealed
[1:37:31] this to you and Upon This
[1:37:34] Rock I will build my church and you will
[1:37:38] be a
[1:37:39] pillar we will be a
[1:37:42] pillar we will hold it up but we have to
[1:37:45] go back to
[1:37:47] Christ brother Dan you always preach
[1:37:50] about
[1:37:52] Jesus
[1:37:54] yeah let me tell you
[1:37:56] [Applause]
[1:37:59] something it won't
[1:38:02] stop it's not going to to deviate this
[1:38:06] way or to go that way the same Jesus
[1:38:09] Christ that saved Peter the same Jesus
[1:38:12] Christ that gave these instructions is
[1:38:14] the same Jesus Christ that saved
[1:38:17] me I will never stop claiming Jesus
[1:38:21] Christ every sermon that I preach is
[1:38:22] going to be about that man because you
[1:38:25] know what every sermon that's recorded
[1:38:27] in this new testament is about that
[1:38:30] man you get tired of
[1:38:32] it yeah you
[1:38:36] shouldn't I love when sister Lily play
[1:38:39] sings that
[1:38:41] song and the musicians they sing that
[1:38:43] song I speak
[1:38:48] Jesus I was thinking about that this
[1:38:50] morning I was I was up late last night
[1:38:51] and and I I was just thinking about it's
[1:38:54] all about Jesus God will send gifts into
[1:38:58] the church
[1:39:01] prophets with Incredible
[1:39:04] gifts to where you can come
[1:39:06] in and he will tell you here's what
[1:39:08] you've been doing here's your
[1:39:12] sin now go and sin no
[1:39:17] more that gift was not to lift us up
[1:39:20] that gift was not to lift him up that
[1:39:23] gift was to get you to Jesus
[1:39:26] Christ the
[1:39:28] book the whole
[1:39:31] thing is written to get us to Jesus it's
[1:39:35] written to lift up
[1:39:38] Christ and if we could just have that
[1:39:40] experience that Stephanie
[1:39:42] had that there's nothing that can take
[1:39:45] it away from
[1:39:46] me can you imagine if someone said
[1:39:49] well I don't think you understand that
[1:39:53] you have to um do this and do that to be
[1:39:57] a Christian she'd be like
[1:40:01] bro I saw
[1:40:04] him he put his hand on my
[1:40:08] shoulder he healed my
[1:40:11] dad don't tell me I don't know him and
[1:40:14] you won't ever see me brother Manny
[1:40:16] telling somebody they don't know
[1:40:18] him if you know him intellectually as I
[1:40:21] said then an intellect if you know him
[1:40:23] him by the by the by the word
[1:40:26] only then that intellectual Spirit can
[1:40:29] also come back and pull it away from
[1:40:32] you it's why we see people we see
[1:40:36] especially the younger generation we see
[1:40:38] them we see them
[1:40:41] leave they don't like it they're
[1:40:44] hurt it's because it was explained to
[1:40:48] them and they never went all the way
[1:40:50] those roots didn't go down
[1:40:54] and those roots need to be call on the
[1:40:58] name of
[1:41:00] God that's the
[1:41:03] root that's what I want to do is come
[1:41:08] back come back to the word come back to
[1:41:11] Christ don't neglect the gifts that God
[1:41:15] gave us they're gifts I'm not going to
[1:41:19] stick my hand in God's face and say I
[1:41:20] don't want your gift because it doesn't
[1:41:22] make sense to me no
[1:41:23] [Music]
[1:41:25] we welcome those gifts but every gift is
[1:41:29] to bring us to the Son of God to our
[1:41:33] Savior Peter
[1:41:35] said repent every one of you and be
[1:41:39] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[1:41:41] the remission of your sins it is a
[1:41:44] commandment and brothers and sisters if
[1:41:47] you have not been baptized or if you
[1:41:49] were baptized and you didn't understand
[1:41:51] the baptism
[1:41:54] then I would suggest to you to be
[1:41:57] baptized now that you understand
[1:42:00] it to come to these Waters as was
[1:42:04] commanded by the Apostle right after he
[1:42:06] was filled with the Holy Spirit the very
[1:42:09] first Christian
[1:42:12] sermon building found building pillars
[1:42:15] in the church and it hasn't changed
[1:42:18] those pillars still have the foundation
[1:42:20] of baptism those still those pillars
[1:42:22] still have the foundation of the godhead
[1:42:24] those pillars still have the foundation
[1:42:26] of the Savior Jesus
[1:42:28] Christ but maybe sometimes they shake a
[1:42:32] little
[1:42:33] bit it's
[1:42:36] fortifying they nail a couple more 2x4s
[1:42:39] on
[1:42:41] there sometimes that's what I
[1:42:43] [Music]
[1:42:46] need I get
[1:42:48] it from prayer and I get it from reading
[1:42:51] the book I get it from being with God
[1:42:54] and serving
[1:42:56] God there is nothing more than to claim
[1:43:00] than to Proclaim Jesus
[1:43:03] Christ that song was just ringing in my
[1:43:07] ears shout Jesus from the mountains
[1:43:10] Jesus in the streets Jesus in the
[1:43:13] darkness over every
[1:43:15] enemy Jesus for my
[1:43:17] family let me tell you I don't care how
[1:43:21] low your children children are how how
[1:43:24] many problems that are there if Jesus
[1:43:27] can create the heavens and the Earth
[1:43:29] then he can save our
[1:43:32] children Jesus in the darkness over
[1:43:35] every enemy Jesus for our family I speak
[1:43:38] the Holy
[1:43:40] Name
[1:43:42] yes Jesus Christ is what the message is
[1:43:46] Jesus Christ is what the word is in fact
[1:43:48] it says that he was the
[1:43:51] word it's all about him
[1:43:55] I love talking about him I love praising
[1:43:59] him he's awesome man he's

[1:44:17] Wilson he's

[1:44:28] have a desire to be baptized it's a good
[1:44:31] time right
[1:44:33] now to make that commitment to do what
[1:44:37] the Apostle Peter said in the very first
[1:44:40] Christian
[1:44:41] sermon so if you have a desire to be
[1:44:43] baptized please go now to the
