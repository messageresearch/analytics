life better it'll make you happier it'll make you more successful it'll just brother it will give you so much so welcome to church welcome to the Tucson Tabernacle do you appreciate um before I I mentioned this morning that I want to read uh the testimony that I asked brother Adam sister Amelia's son I asked him to write down his testimony and I'd like to read it before the church because I think it'd be a blessing to all of us um before we get into that I'd like to say a few words on something that has been on my heart and it does tie into Adam's testimony a little bit there are some people maybe here that uh have experienced some of this um maybe control is is the best word for it but I want to read a chapter in the Bible um and maybe just let the congregation I'll say a few words about it but maybe just let the congregation make your own um decision on on what the Apostle meant here and what it comes down to what it comes I guess the word is excommunication or taking someone out from under the blood of Jesus Christ and this morning's message I had in there I ran out of time I was short on time I had in there I wanted to say a few words about this 1 Corinthians chapter 5 and and bring it before the congregation but um I wanted to keep it in my time slot and I didn't say it but I'd like to just take a few minutes and talk about what this excommunication is or what this taking someone out from under the blood of Jesus Christ is there is scripture for it so so we need to make sure that we're not just we get a bad taste in our in our mouth and and we have some bad memories we want to make sure that we don't run away from the scriptures even though maybe we have been done wrong and this excommunication really it's uh it's it's really a spirit of control and it's very very strong and today and don't kid yourself just as strong today in the Catholic church as it has ever been the Catholic Church they obviously they Spawn from the original uh Church of Rome the Christian church and they have taken the scriptures and and dominated the people with it it's a it's a spirit of domination that that really fuels this church and it's it's the same today I was talking with uh sister Jessica's dad last night brother um Figaroa and he was telling me that uh now I don't want to misquote the pope but brother brother figuro was telling me that the pope said that all doors lead to God talking about the different religions and it sounds good especially in the woke culture that we have today it's like oh just if you're a good person and and you may be a Buddhist or you may be a Muslim or you may be a Hindu just be a good person and you'll eventually get to God that is against the scriptures that is against what we call Christianity Jesus himself said I am the way the truth and the life and no man can come to the father except by me that includes if you're a Hindu and you have never heard of Christianity out in the Villages of India it includes everyone you have to come through Jesus Christ how that will be sorted out at the end I don't know that's up to Jesus he also said that I am the door to the Sheepfold and you want to talk about a door there's only one door to God and it's not through anyone other than the Lord Jesus but when a church comes in and the leadership comes in and they try to control the people and you look at this Pope that we have now and what he's doing is he's opening up all of these doors to all of these really sinful ways and he's saying basically it's it's all good it's okay but let me tell you something you try to protest the Catholic Church one time to him and you see how well it goes for you there's a long history of people protesting in the Catholic church and most of them ended up up at the stake or on the cross uh John Wickliffe he protested the Catholic church he said the people should be able to read the Bible and you know what they did with him they censured him which is like excommunication they censured him and they burned him at the stake then came along this man named Martin Luther said the same thing John hus said the same thing they burned John hust at the stake he prophesied of one coming after him 100 years later his prophecy was fulfilled in Martin Luther Martin Luther comes and he protests the Catholic church he said he said here are 99 reasons why you're wrong and they wanted to burn him at the stake they excommunicated him which is the worst thing that you can do to someone is you take them out from under the blood they say of Jesus and it's a frightening thing is it not for those of you who have been through it or been party to it it's scary because these are your friends these are your family these are the people that you love very much and these are the people that are shunning you now it's a very frightening thing it happened to Martin Luther he wasn't burned to the Stak but his contemporary William tendale who stood by what Martin Luther said and he says now I want to translate the Bible into these people that speak English in England and they burned him at the stake protesting the Catholic Church disagreeing with what they say and he Here Comes judgment when you do that here comes excommunication and these were Christian men and women Jonah Arc burned at the stake for her stand it wasn't just men women too probably just as many women as men burned at the stake killed because they protested the Catholic Church they went against what the church said so they did this thing called excommunication sometimes we'll call it taking it out from underneath the blood as I said there is scripture for it and I want to read this scripture and I want you to make the decision on what the scriptures really say we need to be able to dig into this Bible and we need to be able to on our own understand it it is a Catholic doctrine that a priest has to tell you what it means or a prophet or anything else the holy spirit is The Interpreter let me quote a great man if you don't know his name his name's brother brandom he said God is his own interpreter do you believe that so if God is his own interpreter I don't I can understand it now that's we have ministers and we have teachers and that that help us to understand but in the end all of us make our own decisions and that is what that Spirit hates that Spirit does not want you to have that relationship with God that Spirit wants you under Mama church that doesn't mean churches are wrong churches are are I'm a pastor of a church we're all members of the church we love the church that's not trying to take away churches or saying that you shouldn't Fellowship what that is saying is no you are under Jesus Christ Christ believe it's 1 Corinthians 11 set says Christ is the head of the man now there's nobody in between there Christ is the head of the man and then if you if you look further that that Jesus is that relationship it's that is that's my Ministry is get to Jesus listen to him and what happens is this taking out from under the blood what I have seen is it is because you disagree with the way that the church is thinking and I do not believe that that is what it was intended for by any means the church May Define sin as as one thing but somebody may not be condemned but still wanting to serve the Lord and may not see it that way and if you don't see it like me then I would come and say Zeke you're out of this church you are not to come in here anymore you are not to fellowship with him and that would be a dominating spirit and that would be wrong when I know Ezekiel he wants to serve God but he may not see it like me but as long as we are focusing on Jesus Christ that is where it's at and then you see this elitist mentality that that breathes this conflict and hatred and that's really it's in direct contrast to the gospels it's in direct contrast to the spirit of Jesus Christ the main thing is that we are doing our best to serve God we we have it on our hearts like I talked about the three Parables the three different situations this morning that little sheep wanted to serve God and then that prodigal son he left on his own he wasn't kicked out by Mom and Dad he left he left the the faith it was his choice I believe most of this comes from 1 Corinthians chapter 5 and that's where I want to read before we get to brother Adam's letter and we have to remember do you remember from our book of Acts our Bible study brothers and sisters Bible study is important Wednesday nights are important if you can't get here listen to them because you're going to learn something we learn in the book of Acts that this city of Corinth what was it filth did you say Las Vegas Sin City that's what Corinth was sexually immoral place this is the book to the Corinthians meaning they live in Corinth it's the church there now Paul is writing this 1 Corinthians chapter 5:1 he says it is commonly reported that there is fornication among you and such fornication as in as is not so much named among the Gentiles that one should have his father's wife so what he's saying is you live in this Gentile city of Corinth it's a filthy dirty City but even they don't seek sink this low even those filthy people that have worship all all these gods and do all this stuff wrong even they are not sinking to this immorality and the Apostle Paul says but you are Church in Corinth what's the matter with you and you are puffed up and have not rather mourned that he that have done this deed might be taken away from you so he's like you're too proud and all this you should be Mourning you should be sad that you have a man in this church that is sleeping with his stepmother and that's where all of this is started it's coming from immorality sexual immorality let's continue for verily for I verily as absent in body but present in spirit have judged already as though I were present concerning him that hath done this deed Paul was awesome he was so cool he's the one that started this church he's the one that got it going and he comes in and he introduces him to Christ and he's like listen you respect me I am absent from you in body I either whether he was in prison or whether he was traveling I'm not sure where he was at this time I think he was traveling but he wasn't present with them but he says I'm with you in spirit I love you I love you Church church but I as not as not being with you in body but present in spirits I have judged this so he's acting as the pastor here this isn't a voter of the church this is the pastor asserting Authority and he's saying that this man that had done this deed might be taken from you for verily I say is absent in body but presid in spirit I've already judged this as though I were present concerning him that had done this deed in the name of our Lord Jesus that's important he's saying I am speaking for Jesus Christ when we pray over our food Lord please bless this food in Jesus name whoa you're speaking for Jesus Christ here every little prayer in jesus' name it should be revered and here here he's saying in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ I'm speaking on his behalf when you are gathered together in my spirit with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ to deliver such a one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus so what he's saying here is this is an act of mercy so what's going to happen here is you turn this man who is sinning filthy sinning you turn him over to the devil and then he gets sick and then he suffers sickness in his body or something happens in his body I talked this morning about when the prodigal son left that the parents should pull back and let him go don't enable him when you do that you are taking that wonderful influence of a Godly mother and father or a godly church and they leave and you pull back from that and this good influence and these good friends and he leaves and he walks away from it and you don't chase him down of course he's going to have problems duh the good things in his life the positive influence in his life are gone that's not excommunicating someone that's not taking them out from under the blood that is just saying okay you can leave I'll always be here you can always come back you're always welcome in church you're always welcome to be with us in our family but you have left and I'm not going to chase after you because if you chase after him that good influence follows you and you're still helping him and you're still enabling him and he's still wanting to sin he doesn't want to come back and you're making it easy for him but that's not this scripture right here this scripture is uh is someone that's bringing sin into the church not someone that disagrees with the church your gloring is not good know ye that A little leaven leavens a whole lump the Amplified version says your boasting over the supposed spirituality of your church is not good indeed it is vulgar and inappropriate do you not know that just a little leaven ferments the whole batch of dough just as a little sin corrupts a person or an entire church so this person that this is talking about is bringing sin in and spreading it among the people not The Parables I talked about this morning Purge therefore out the old leaven that you may be a new lump as you are leaven for even Christ Our Passover is sacrificed for us therefore let us keep the feast not with old leaven neither with the leaven of malice and of wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators remember what was going on in Corinth the filth Sin City as as brother Lyall said a modern day Las Vegas what's going on there and then he's saying that you this is even lower than than the street people this is bad people that don't even know Christ or any other real God this is this is completely immoral and you're being worse this is being worse and he says not to and now he's trying to bring it into the church and spread it among the church don't company with that filthy that filthiness the um Amplified says I wrote to you in my previous letter not to associate with the sexual immoral people because it's bringing it's it's causing problems in your families it's causing problems in the church yet not altogether with the forn fornicators of this world or with the Covetous or with the extortioners or with the idolators for then must ye needs go out of the world not meaning the immoral people of this world or the greedy ones and the swinders idolators then you would have to get out of the world and Human Society all together saying you don't have to cut everybody off but now I have written to you not to keep Company If any man that is called a brother be a fornicator or Covetous or an idolator or a or a drunkard or an extortioner with such a one not to eat for what have I to do to judge them also that are without do not ye judge them that are within me read the Amplified says for what business is it of mine to judge Outsiders non-believers do you not judge those who are within the church to protect the church as the situation requires not just if you not if you disagree with the doctrine not if there is sin in your life everyone has sin in their life I'm not condoning it it's wrong get it out of your life but we all fail but you don't kick them out because of that he's saying they're bringing in and it's spreading but them that are without God judgeth therefore put away from among yourselves that Wicked person Amplified version says God Alone sits in the judgment on those who are outside the faith remove the wicked one from among you and expel him from your church so I'll let you make the decision that when we see some of this as I said take him out from under the blood kick him out of church and doing all this is it according to that is it according to this word just because they're doing something that maybe the church doesn't teach or maybe the church condemns just because they brother Aaron what did you say you said something when we were in the back that they kick that people get kicked out for brother aon's been there sister Millie's been there the brother sister Elizabeth the brother that I'm going to read his letter he's been there and let me tell you it harms and even today it's still a struggle even for brother Adam and it's it's made a scar in his life because of that fear and I've been there it's a fear that falls upon you that you don't you don't want anybody to see you do anything that was what it was that you don't want anybody whether where you are at the grocery store like I told you in Costco or whever if somebody sees you fellowshipping with this person over here who has been shunned now you are responsible and you always live under that fear and it's it's it's fear is wrong you respect and you fear God but no you do not have to fear anything in this world I don't care if it's sickness death or what some somebody else thinks of you you be right and don't worry about that stuff and I can even see it in some of the letters that I receive and some of the people that I that I talk to I can see that they still have that fear it's been so ingrained and pounded into them that you are under this church and we have taken you out from under the blood for the destruction of your flesh so that your soul may be saved because you did something wrong or you had sin in your life that is not according to the scripture when that happens and let me tell you one of the most common things in this Bible to remove somebody from you guess what it is gossip that's that's one of the things you bring it in and you hurt the church it's not having a television or going to a movie or even or even someone that has an addiction or something like that it's harming the body and that is what it's about don't fear and if you have anything like that in your history brothers and sisters never fear that never let that fear rise up let me tell you Jesus Christ wipes that away and you are not subject to anything in your past our past is clean because we have accepted the way the truth and the life we have accepted Jesus Christ and he is our savior he's the only savior there's no other and with this Pope is saying if he said it that all doors lead to God no they don't there's only one that does and I want to go in that door in fact I have gone in that door and I would encourage everyone to follow that door brother Adam sister Amelia's son brother Jordan were you able to get that picture excellent want to see who we're talking about here there he is Adam Gonzalez he's uh s how many kids do you have four and what number is he oh he's the youngest okay there he is and that's who wrote this absolutely beautiful letter and I asked him I said I said brother I said sometimes on Sunday nights we do um we do testimonies and I said I'd really like to read your testimony I think it would be blessing to all of us and I had it on my heart to preach on the prodigal son and I thought that everything just kind of lined up perfectly for this testimony but Adam says this dearly beloved greetings in the name greetings in Christ Jesus what an honor and privilege he's writing by the way he's not writing to me he's writing to all of us he knows that this is going to be read what an honor and privilege to write a few words from sender to receiver the mystical Body of Christ just think of all those prophets and the writings maybe not knowing the Years it'll reach all the years it'll travel look at the outcome and the impact it's still alive and breathing he's talking about this Bible I'm living proof so I must Proclaim it name it and live it like these Great Men of faith not only not only they wrote what we have as the word today they spoke of things that are to come and that shall come of things that we are to do and not to do then like the children of Israel they were used as examples to us of what not to do we read that in the book of Hebrews the 4th chapter let us therefore make every effort to enter into that rest so that no one will fall by following their example of Disobedience not only is Christ the same yesterday today and forever so are these examples so are these examples for instance in Jesus's day it was the intellectuals of that day who practiced the Law Men known as the Pharisees but could not recognize the Living Word right in front of them we still have these examples right before us today right here in prison they reject the word well what I want to say is I'm a living example just like the children of Israel we don't have to look back for it's right here before us see a brother nonetheless but a brother nonetheless but one who is an example of Disobedience talking about himself I take no pride in this it's shameful but B but bear with me here let me take you a little while back through the corridor of time this is a short testimony so God this is a short testimony so God help me I too like you was sitting in a church pew as a child God appointed me a wonderful mother who served faithfully and diligently oh she struggled taking us to church I was the youngest of all her children and I was the I was honory at times I would sing and clap and have a grand old time then fall asleep right Teddy and then fall asleep As I Grew and I got older I would begin to be torn by the world and the church I would be torn by the world world and Church Life and he has tradition I mean I knew I was different I didn't seem to fit in other kids in school and in the neighborhood wasn't like me or raised like me other kids parents didn't teach or lavish This Love Of Christ over their life it's how sad but my mother did and she enforced this message we didn't have a TV in the home or allowed to play worldly music I would go over to the neighbors to watch their TV then at church I didn't feel like I fit in all of the other kids had both parents as Believers and and seemed that they were part of an elite group they were around each other and house visiting fellowshipping playing with each other why I was different was it because why was I different was it because I had only a single parent and I was a little more rugged there was some there were some kids in similar circumstances and we gravitated to one another we were like outcasts later on later as I approached my teens I experienced smoking pot remember the testimony from Brother Manuel a couple weeks ago it is a gateway drug it's a gateway to worse things it's bad enough but it leads to other things in which I had a bad experience talk about Scared Straight anytime I tried to experience the world it came with a wrong with a warning and a spanking too in my teens I was in and out of rebellious stages I was disobedient like you would not believe I was involved with neighborhood kids who were in gangs I was trying to find a place to belong not knowing that I had a place all along the warnings and spankings grew As I Grew in disobedience still going to church still believing there is a God who saves and a true message that came from a true Prophet it was a true it was true just not to me at the time it was intellectual Faith see as a kid I went by Traditions through the through the motions that let me stop there that is all too common I went through the Traditions just going through the motions that is so much I mean I can't say enough about that and you don't know why you do it it was a seed but not a not real to me yet one day in my teens I felt convicted and decided to get baptized I was blessed with an older brother who took me under his wing I was a real was he was a real dear brother he loved me as as a brother should and encourag me daily even to receive Christ into my heart and make the commitment as an outward expression and get baptized I began to feel on fire yet I was in my infancy I was immature things began to get harder trials and situations and I made bad decisions I would fight with my mother ultimately my faith was challenged and I shrunk back Brothers tried to counsel me but I was not hearing them it all started with with one small form of Disobedience that led to more and more I became a rogue teen out of control I would later look back and wonder how that happened I would also ask I would also question if I was saved and if God loved me I didn't realize how Disobedience works the devil operates a very cunning system you would think when you get baptized it'll get easier there is so much in between that I can't discuss and add but just for the basics to make this short I would end up making a choice the worst Choice nonetheless I went into the world I would step away from the body and the head and the the body and the head to reject one is to to reject one is to reject the other later on looking at scriptures to find out what was taking place in my life I found the book of of Romans the first chapter and it says this furthermore since they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God he gave them over to a depraved mind to do what ought not to be done I believe the King James says reprobate mind if I'm right I'm not positive about that but I think in Just In My Memory I then began to live a life full-fledged of sin not overnight I became more Affiliated in gangs then in criminal life also cutting Corners to make fast money you think the warnings and spanking stopped they got more severe God might have G might have gave me over but they didn't give up on me he would save me from my foolish self at 19 years old I would find myself in the hospital with a gunshot wound in my stomach almost died then shortly after facing prison time looking at three and a half years prison three and a half years in prison in prison I would make more bad choices that would Place me in supermax lockdown now here I am with no Escape God had me one-on-one calling to me all the while he was calling he was always calling I just wasn't listening but this was a sitdown so I would call out and pray and began to pick up my Bible I started to come back only not in the way of obedience we all have a way there's a right there's a way that seeth right to a man that's a proverb I believe there's a way that seeth right to the man but the end thereof is death in which we are going to respond but he has a provided way not our way when I get out of prison when I got out of prison I would only Venture back to the old patterns okay so now we passed by when I was 14 I was baptized 21 I'm in supermax my dad and my grandpa is passed and God's dealing with me 23 I'm out for 5 years and for five years I didn't stand the test and have no root I fell away only to be sat down again at 28 see every 7 years he says so up to this point I was starting to get it together I was was working a legitimate job working hard in a good company ready to buy a home and perhaps get married I even felt like God was blessing me yet in Disobedience I was still living loose and far from my post here 28 years old approaching guess what I got into trouble with the law and away I go and lost everything so here I am on my knees again trying to do things my way and not listen to that still Small Voice to do it to do it the way he wanted see permissive will but I came so close I was so sincere too and I cried crocodile tears I was starting to do everything right while I was in prison only when I got out I didn't stand the test in Temptation and desires for the things of the world drew me in I missed the target God demands obedience not sacrifice oh God I'll stop doing this I'll stop doing that in time I will end up learning now out of prison in my 30s I turn back to the life of sin almost like I graduated in sin and I'm proving faithful to serve its desires so with risk comes reward now I'm willing to risk more for a better life of luxury like the third illustration from the parable of the S because the cares of life and the riches and the desires for things to come and it chokes it out you remember he's talking about that Parable and the The Seer sewing seeds and it gets choked out by the things of the world so for the next five years to a total of another seven I went hard into this life almost like a man running from the Lord I drowned out the calling with the things of the world till one day yet again for the third time I'm looking at going to prison this time it would be for a very long time but this would be the fourth time God would make provisions and shine his grace upon me to give me another opportunity to heed his calling I can tell you all the in between situations and look back about how God's hand was upon me during those foolish times in my life don't be mistaken not to bless me but to Save Me From Myself sin and Satan so the goal is in this I say this finally I came to my senses then I made the deliberate choice I realized things were so severe even life-threatening that I knew God meant business I was blind see it started in Disobedience left me in delusion lies and deception it was God who delivered me and spared me now sitting in a Cell I rededicated my life to the Lord I submitted full obedience even so much I studied what true obedience was as the Holy Spirit guided me step by step he began this Restoration in me not to water this foolish life of sin but in moments in those years I sought to do good I would call to God and pray and try to live right or what I thought was right in my deceived mind but nevertheless of however good I thought I was I was still in Disobedience until one gets back to his or her post and position in the body to do what what he is asking I was still as good as he I was still as good as outside the camp all the while still your brother lost in the world now I don't consider myself worthy to be a brother if any of any of the least of you all but God has a purpose in all that he does he had a purpose in this life that he chose to save and deliver when before the foundation of the world a predestinated seed not only to use it as an example but as a demonstration what powerful words talking about himself not only to use me in my life as an example but also a demonstration so don't think yourself to yourself that if God saved me brother Adam I can go and play with fire too some leave never to come back they never even look back he has spared me as a voice on this side of these Prison Walls and fences where no man wants to be one can even be in prison in his or her mind too although I'm not alive and not dead just think of that man although I am alive and not dead just think of that man who went to hell if he could have just had one chance to go back and tell his family how real hell was but he had his chance see and he said send someone only to get the response they had the prophets look and I added to this this morning I'm going to add to it again they had the prophets they had Church they had the Bible they had a good mom they had a good dad they had all of this that I gave them they already had it what do you think that somebody else going up there and telling them how bad hell is Pastor tells them all the time they have it now if I can look you in the face with seriousness and a stern look I have to say this I was better off never leaving my post in that church pew just holding my post right there I was better off never knowing the things that the world introduced me to you young people listen to this I was better off not knowing what I know now all the while still your brother lost but now I'm found now I have to fight that much more for all things I gave myself over to I hope you would see how this works so you will know maybe your pastor will explain it kind of operation behind the scenes unless you know already now I'm cleaned up and set aside now to Proclaim to those who would heed some calling I once had that I once had that would have saved me from such misery 21 years of Disobedience 14 to 35 years old I can't help what I am I am a member in this body there are some for important there are some for important roles and some for lesser roles listen I'm not saying for those flirting with sin or temptation to imagine how it plays out you might want something so bad even if it means to go the way of perversion so let me tell you and give you a little vision of that the end result is sitting right here writing this to you don't do it there's your answer to it there is a right way and a right way to go about it so right there in those crosswords one way is the way of the world and of perversion or the way of the word and righteousness see I didn't realize that a little Disobedience result in 21 years of Heartache had I been told had I been obedient to God's word I would have not been in this predicament here I am approaching 45 years old with 25 years more to go here in prison this is the repercussions of sin but also preparation for God to pour out himself into me we don't look at the chains but the benefit of these chains oh God bless him what a great attitude I'll read it again we don't look at the chains but the benefit of these chains really there is no more chain on a true Son of God we have freedom in Christ but we have conditions we must live by this his promises on is on condition we must believe Faith obedience faithfulness pers perseverance we see in the Book of James 1:5 and if any of you lack wisdom he or she should ask of God who gives generously without finding fault and it would be given to him or her but when he or she asks he or she must believe and not doubt because he or she who who doubts is like a wave of the sea blown and tossed in the Wind that man or woman should not think he will receive anything from the Lord that that man or woman is double mind is a double-minded man unstable in all that he or she does we don't want to be that example he was quoting James chapter 1 as I said we don't want to be that example that was me too at one time unwise a fool blown back and forth and unstable in all that I did all the while still your brother so maybe like myself although now stable and wise by his grace given to me I may have a reflection of me among you when I was young one of you who may think you're making some choices in life and maybe nobody knows or maybe you won't get caught but a word from the wise your sin will find you out I realize as a Son of God I couldn't get away with doing wrong why others get away and I couldn't I would ask myself that's Grace and love of the father remember the prodigal son how many left and never suffered but that's Grace of the father this this brother is saying if I would have just held my post though if I would have just held there I mentioned a parable of the Soul as I began to navigate the word and make sense of my life and experiences I let the word I let the word tell it and who I am in Christ for all Christians our story is theirs too we should be able to see ourselves there it's a reflection we only hope to reflect him though the coin goes both ways I can reflect of what is not so when I read that Parable it was my life starting at 14 years old I had received but I didn't understand I was going about it through Traditions without going into detail he says we can imagine I think every one of us knows I was going through it with just traditions and I didn't understand the value I understood one must have the spirit it's not much that the enemy snat snatching at the word and gives you something in exchange so he takes a word from you gives you something in exchange like something that took pleas like something that looks pleas pleasing to the eye try to snatch your car keys out of a child's hand he'll get to crying and hollering but give him or her a little toy to play with in the meantime take your valuable car keys so you can get where you need to go that's me at 14 immature child unspiritual not fit to handle the message of wisdom then at 21 I came along to my senses only to work off emotion it's part of it but I didn't have no I didn't have root that makes a person want to look up agriculture while studying that how does Roots grow because I didn't have them and then why right it lasted for a short time about two and a half years some of that in supermax I was wondered how I got through that time by God's grace is how then the word must be tested and I failed then at 28 I thought I was really doing something till God stopped me in my tracks yet again I was trying to be popular and trying to be the coolest guy like I was a celebrity thinking I was belonging and fitting in just concerned with the worries of life and deceitfulness of wealth I got choked out making me unfruitful Mark 20 Mark 4:20 says this others like seed swn on good soil hear the word accept it and produce a crop 30 60 or even 100 fold what was sown after 35 years brothers and sisters I don't want to find out if there's still another opportunity the time is now to heed and accept this word I was all these illustration at one point in my life some are stuck there for their whole life to never get another opportunity I was wondering why didn't he just give me over completely but I believe who he has made me to be a predestinated seed so we must believe too not just who he is but what he has done then who has he made us to be these men as educated in Theology and Doctrine and well learned and having trouble trying to get that that first part right but it's not revealed to them they cut them up into threes this is not revealed by flesh and blood not by Traditions reasoning by work by works if we want to know him we must get desperate I'm going to stop there for a moment brother Paul said something one time that stuck with me so well and when he gave a testimony brother Paul said these words he said we cannot be truly saved unless we realize that we are truly lost that arrogance saying I'm fine I'm okay you got to understand that you are lost first before you can be saved for the Paul that was such wisdom it stuck with me as we journey with him we find out who we are in him for our identity is in him not in not in the world not in social media not in artificial intelligence not in a job but in Christ the amen the enemy go goal is to kill steal and destroy and Rob I was a man qualified for that had it not been for God's grace how can I then not testify this my life was spared and going to be spent here and I must cry out unto you brother and sister repent of any hint of Disobedience even thought let my life not be in vain Evermore let not let not the life of Christ and others who follow and perish not be in vain my Disobedience hurt the body I left my PO post to be selfish and I was stubborn imagine a part of your body stops working it would affect the whole body sometimes in the body the doctor may have to remove and cut it off see I was fortunate that I was healed and restored I am still suffering I don't have the luxury as you Saints have in one sentence the the sorry I'm can't I can't read that we one we won I'm Sor I can't read that either but I must suffer that if you can be forgiven but may still have to suffer the repercussions I may never be able to join you as my heart desires it hurts me so bad but I look to the day when we will meet again we are promised that meeting in the sky and I'll be the guy screaming and hollering finally all the saints while all the all the while still your brother please young brothers and sisters even to the older I need you to we need one another the Bible says in Ephesians as each one does its work for the building itself in love we have the message we have the examples we hear the preaching to prepare us see to be built up and mature so we can attain the whole measure of the fullness of Christ see then that we won't be tossed back and forth no longer infants unstable instead speaking the truth in love our life speaks it to one another a real love language of obedience we then can grow up in him the head who's joining us Al together a true Oneness so much for a short testimony he says it's hard to step to stop this pen from going maybe this is for me not for me not to share but what am I to do for what purpose do I now stand yes we yes we believe it but I'm led to report this back it's not a glorious life in here not complaining but listen my roommate is serving life another man who served but five who lives but 5et from me is serving life and was on death row at one time his roommate is doing life and it goes with the total of 33 guys living in a box one run of four in a building here I am one of them and entrusted with this word to share it and live it I can go on about the food the people the situations and so many things that's not fit for a Son of God there's no 101 guide for how to although I have the guide that gives me the 101 it didn't come easy I have to prove faithful in every test killing the carnal man not looking to save my life but lose it all the while your brother and at times felt alone alienated from the body this is the place God chose me chose to get me oneon-one I could choose if I could choose a church pew like you or the Altar for him to get a hold of me right there how gracious is God to leave me but but rais me up and display himself through me to these Souls here they too have an opportunity he's a way maker some have rejected some hate me others have kicked me out of their religious groups bible studies I used to I I use those places I I use th I use those places I've been in the lifestyle and I've once talked I've once lived to talk to Thugs and killers and lifers and drug dealers and the like and while still your brother at at times I felt alone and alienated and separated from the family of God it's been s times of sadness distress disappointment times of hopelessness then God comes and gives reass assurance that I am not alone not forsaken not abandoned not alienated or separated not just myself but Brothers like myself and wide we need you and your prayers I believe you need Brothers like us too maybe for a reminder maybe to encourage and help you see the mistakes we've made will keep you from doing the same maybe you have no desire to reach out to the prisoner how about the widow or the orphan what are we called to maybe you have a desire for a prisoner to reach out to you how about a deacon or a pastor let's reach out to one another every ligament supporting one another I'm I'm not necessarily saying to write me we reach out by doing our part in the body child when you're being obedient to parents you are doing your parten when you say no to these Temptations in a rebellious way when you stay away from these crowds and away from these sights you're doing your part and reaching out when we say to one another you're saying yes to one another can't walk two ways when the devil reaches out to trade you for something Shining we say no and we take the hand of God he takes your hand and he takes my hand and joins us together the way to remember one as such as I am to take these words let them encourage you to be the obedience Jesus said if you love me you obey me and I obeyed my father he was obedient to death for you sometimes it kills us to listen to pray to go to church go to the AL altar to listen to your parents and listen to your pastor I have so much more to say concerning my life and my life in here but I have so much more to say on the life that that way laid down before us all how wonderful to belong to his body to be a son and a daughter of God all the while still your brother the whole time it was right before my eyes may God open these eyes to your heart to know you're you're right where you belong if you're sitting in that church pew will you dedicate yourself to him to obey him with all your heart to accept him and what he has done for you it'll be better than what the world has for you trust me friends I wish I never knew or have tasted I I would have been better off not knowing or experiencing or learning once you do something you can't undo it but we can repent the musicians can come but we can repent everybody I have to fight against against those things all I want now is to know him as Paul says I want to know Christ and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sharing in his suffering becoming like him in his death and so somehow to attain the resurrection from the dead when a child of God Ventures into the world we begin to know the things that a child of God is not supposed to know Disobedience will lead you will lead and pull you that way then your hearts become wrong see not the mind of the Lord but of the world then the thought becomes words then actions see the serpent seed there is no better way than the way the truth and the life so what I'm saying to sum it up I was like you in a church pew in front of all the good Spirit-filled pastors and brothers and sisters my obedience my my Disobedience took me from you and now I'm surrounded by men filled with evil spirits all sort of perversion and mental illness and depraved Minds when I ask how this happened to me how did this start a small Disobedience a rebellious choice I may never get out in fact I may die here here I am brothers and sisters your example of what not to do this is not a feel sorry for me but for those living that wrong example to be sorry unto repentance if not this if not this can be you I in all honesty it's impossible that I'm sharing this I should be dead I should be given over I should be I should have been destroyed With God all things are possible and he saved and delivered me it didn't come cheap but with a great price these words are sealed with a price and it's my life my hope is that you would treasure them and bind them to your neck your wonderful Pastor gave me such a wonderful opportunity just to show you how for this message is reaching and the work of God is using him for the reach to reach the prisoners my mother a widow and other orphans pray for him continually and us God appointed a brother here with me as we stand firm in the faith and on these front lines contending with the spirit forces all around like soldiers you too do your part for we are in the Lord's army we know when this is all over we shall see the king in the New Jerusalem and he says brother Dan thank you for this opportunity to share these few words with those who needs to hear it I'm hoping it'll reach a few Hearts may this letter find you and your family in good health and spirit and in God's tender love and mercy may he bless you and help you sincerely your brother in Christ brother Adam [Applause] Gonzalez a very good epistle a very good epistle

of the Lord he tells us here is what I have done but I am still your brother and he is L wouldn't it be great if we could get him out get him here but believe the Lord has him where he wants wants him we have to remember that there's a longterm goal in all of this right and you can suffer and suffer and suffer for what you've done and done and done but as long as it works to out for the good Romans 8:28 I mean it even applies to the mistakes that we've made for all things work together for the good to them that love God and them that are according to his that are called according to his purpose even if we make mistakes and we've done wrong it still works out together for our good look at that Parable this morning it worked out for the good for that young man that made all of those mistakes
