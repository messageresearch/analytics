[41:08] thank you to our musicians for their

[41:11] seated for
[41:12] just a moment and then of course i'll
[41:15] have you stand up again
[41:18] but i wanted to speak to you for a few
[41:20] moments before we read our topic verses
[41:22] and
[41:23] dive into what i believe the lord has
[41:25] put in my heart to share with you
[41:27] today as most of you know is veterans
[41:30] day
[41:32] now exactly two years ago i also spoke
[41:35] with you on
[41:36] veterans day it was a sunday in 2018 the
[41:39] 100th anniversary
[41:41] of the end of world war one i told you a
[41:44] story then of a british
[41:45] captain named howard rose how he was
[41:48] marching his men to the front the trench
[41:50] warfare in europe at that time
[41:52] machine guns chattering artillery shells
[41:56] exploding men dying of terrible wounds
[42:00] while politicians in berlin and london
[42:04] moved pins on a map i told you how
[42:07] howard rose had his men
[42:09] make a turn at a fork in the road the
[42:13] decision immediately resulted in
[42:14] complaints it wasn't the direct route to
[42:16] their destination which appeared
[42:18] safe and open it was an indirect route
[42:22] and it looked quite dangerous but howard
[42:26] felt something inside of him
[42:27] it was a voice he said telling him to
[42:30] take the dangerous looking path
[42:32] howard was not a christian at the time
[42:35] he didn't understand what was happening
[42:38] but he turned a very short time later
[42:41] the road that would have been marching
[42:42] down at the time and place they would
[42:44] have been on it
[42:45] came under heavy enemy attack they all
[42:47] would have been killed
[42:49] the grumbling stopped howard fell to his
[42:52] knees he promised god that he would seek
[42:54] him and serve him for sparing his life
[42:57] and the lives of his men and so we did
[43:02] paul tells us that we love god because
[43:05] he first loved us
[43:08] howard rose survived the war he became a
[43:11] christian he became
[43:12] a minister he became a mentor to a young
[43:15] pentecostal girl
[43:17] who would become heather's mother
[43:20] tonight i'd like to ask if there's
[43:23] anyone in the congregation that has
[43:25] served or are currently serving in the
[43:27] military to please stand
[43:31] thank you and remain standing those of
[43:34] you who were seated please look around
[43:37] the people standing put their lives
[43:39] physically
[43:40] on the line so we could be here
[43:44] tonight they'd risk their lives to
[43:47] defend the freedoms that we have in this
[43:49] country
[43:50] maybe they saw a battle and perhaps they
[43:52] didn't but as citizens
[43:55] and residents of this country we are
[43:58] in their debt and i want to thank each
[44:00] of you that are standing

[45:00] physical distress

[46:55] inherit the kingdom prepared for you
[46:58] from the foundation of the world and to
[47:01] some of them
[47:02] he mentions two verses later i was in
[47:05] prison
[47:07] and you came to me
[47:10] i want to read next from acts chapter
[47:13] 16.
[47:15] this is uh paul's second missionary
[47:17] journey as it's known
[47:18] now when they had gone throughout frugia
[47:21] and the region of galatia
[47:23] and were fit and forbidden of the holy
[47:25] ghost to preach the word in asia
[47:28] after they will come to micah they
[47:29] assayed to go into bithynia but the
[47:31] spirit
[47:32] suffered them not and they passing by my
[47:36] sia
[47:37] came down to troll us and a vision
[47:40] appeared to paul
[47:42] in the night there stood a man of
[47:45] macedonia and prayed him saying
[47:49] come over into macedonia and help us
[47:54] and after he had seen the vision
[47:57] immediately
[47:58] we endeavored to go into macedonia
[48:01] assuredly gathering
[48:02] that the lord had called us for to
[48:05] preach the gospel unto them
[48:09] therefore loosing from troas we came
[48:12] with a straight course to
[48:13] some other k and the next day to
[48:16] neapolis
[48:18] and from fence to philippi which is the
[48:19] chief city of that part of macedonia
[48:22] and a colony and we were in that city
[48:26] abiding
[48:26] certain days please be seated
[48:31] this evening's message is titled
[48:34] philippians
[48:36] joy and irony
[48:40] now when we read from acts 16 just now
[48:43] did you have a clear idea of exactly
[48:45] where paul and his
[48:47] company were traveling do the names of
[48:50] the towns and areas bring a picture to
[48:52] your mind
[48:54] or are they just a list of sometimes
[48:57] hard to pronounce names of places that
[49:00] don't really matter much to a person in
[49:03] the 21st century
[49:04] living in tucson arizona
[49:08] i find in reading the bible every word
[49:13] is intentional luke is not just giving
[49:16] us an exciting travelogue of paul's
[49:18] adventures
[49:19] around the mediterranean to fill a page
[49:22] no pun intended
[49:24] god had a purpose in leading paul
[49:28] and his company of believers in the path
[49:30] they took
[49:31] it's no coincidence that they ended up
[49:35] in troas
[49:36] when paul had the vision to come to
[49:39] macedonia
[49:41] just like it was no coincidence that uh
[49:44] brother ed biskell's wife packed a green
[49:46] checkered
[49:47] shirt in his gear before he went on a
[49:50] certain hunting trip
[49:52] the bible records only a few times
[49:55] that paul had a vision and i've not
[49:58] found another instance where paul's
[50:00] vision was of anyone
[50:01] other than the lord or angel
[50:05] but this vision was different it was
[50:07] specific
[50:09] a macedonian man
[50:13] as specific as a green checkered
[50:16] shirt
[50:20] and why philippi
[50:23] where's philippi what's special about
[50:26] philippi why might god have chosen it
[50:30] to be the place for the launch pad
[50:32] extending the reach of the good news
[50:35] into europe
[50:38] on our most recent road trip we spent
[50:41] some time with sarah
[50:42] my brother noel's oldest daughter at her
[50:44] home in jacksonville florida
[50:46] she was relating to us about some issues
[50:48] that her husband was having
[50:49] in atlanta teaching people showing
[50:53] people training people how to install
[50:54] glass sheathing on tall buildings that's
[50:57] not a
[50:58] he'd have a problem training me to do
[51:00] that
[51:02] well sarah has a lot of experience
[51:05] training people in various jobs
[51:07] she said the first thing you need to do
[51:09] if you're training someone
[51:12] is to ask them how do you
[51:15] learn some of us need to be shown
[51:20] others guided some a youtube video a
[51:23] picture
[51:24] some just need to read the directions
[51:26] and do it
[51:28] we all learn differently
[51:31] i i think the same applies to the word
[51:35] we're used to preaching but we sometimes
[51:38] need
[51:38] visuals or even drama or something else
[51:42] to help drive home a point to help us
[51:44] remember
[51:45] perhaps some of you were here the time
[51:48] brother green came back from israel
[51:51] he had us open our bibles to the place
[51:53] where jesus talked about faith being
[51:55] like a mustard seed
[51:57] and while our bibles were open he walked
[51:59] up and down the aisles and sprinkled a
[52:00] few mustard seeds
[52:02] in the open bibles mustard seeds from
[52:04] israel
[52:06] i doubt anyone who is here has forgotten
[52:09] that service
[52:12] so with that as background welcome to
[52:14] wednesday school
[52:16] i'm going to approach tonight's message
[52:18] just a little differently
[52:20] there will be a number of images in the
[52:22] next few slides so
[52:24] we might need to dim some of the
[52:25] lighting
[52:29] ah i remembered where the green button
[52:31] was
[52:32] so this is a map from about a century
[52:35] ago showing the world
[52:36] the world's not really flat it's only
[52:38] the map that's flat
[52:39] now you recognize of course the united
[52:41] states on the left and this red triangle
[52:43] in the
[52:44] center is showing the eastern
[52:46] mediterranean region and this is
[52:48] this area here encompasses all the lambs
[52:51] mentioned in the bible
[52:54] i'm sure most of you know this but i
[52:58] just wanted to show you that to get you
[53:01] into this area this next image is from
[53:04] google earth and it's the portion of the
[53:06] world that we saw in that
[53:08] red triangle now this is based on images
[53:11] taken from space and here we see modern
[53:13] names of these areas like turkey
[53:15] here's lebanon jordan israel
[53:19] greece italy and so forth this is
[53:22] this is the region where events of the
[53:26] bible take place and especially
[53:28] the events of the new testament
[53:31] now i'm going to replace that with a map
[53:35] this map is showing about the same area
[53:38] but this
[53:38] is showing the provinces as they were in
[53:42] the areas in the regions
[53:45] during the time of the roman empire
[53:47] during the time of the new testament
[53:50] um modern day turkey that you remember
[53:53] look it's all sorts of provinces it's uh
[53:59] don't look at it lyle
[54:04] well let me turn it off and back on
[54:06] again maybe you didn't like the laser
[54:07] being turned on that much
[54:14] there it is okay don't move it so fast
[54:16] lyle
[54:17] so no it just went out again okay
[54:22] okay thank you you you can see turkey
[54:25] and the very western part of it is
[54:28] called asia you can see there's
[54:29] there's lots of different uh provinces
[54:32] there by thenia and galatia
[54:34] you can see uh modern-day greece is
[54:38] called
[54:38] acacia in macedonia there's a place up
[54:41] there that's called threaque that
[54:43] corresponds to modern-day bulgaria
[54:46] um one thing that uh
[54:50] that that you should notice here is that
[54:52] region that i called asia
[54:54] when the bible talks about asia it's not
[54:57] talking about
[54:57] japan and korea and china you won't find
[55:01] beijing in the bible right but
[55:05] but that area when they talk about asia
[55:07] that's what they're talking about that
[55:09] part of western turkey
[55:12] sorry about that
[55:17] it's uh still showing two things but
[55:40] great thank you there we go
[55:43] thank you very much my electric
[55:45] personality didn't work it took
[55:46] batteries
[55:48] so we can see asia here we can see
[55:51] cappadocia
[55:53] pontus by phineas alicia
[55:57] there's just all sorts of
[56:02] all sorts of things going on there so
[56:04] that's
[56:05] these roman provinces and so forth now
[56:08] i'm going to go to the next slide
[56:10] here we are now this is showing pretty
[56:11] much the same provinces
[56:13] but it includes an overlay of the
[56:15] probable route
[56:17] of paul's journeys as told in acts the
[56:20] portion that we read is this red line it
[56:23] picks it up about here but it actually
[56:24] started over here antioch
[56:26] taurus's derby leicester they had some
[56:28] issues there timothy joined him
[56:30] somewhere along here
[56:31] iconium antioch and they came through
[56:34] here ultimately
[56:35] bypassing mycea coming to troas
[56:39] and then they took a boat went up here
[56:42] into here and then walked up to philip
[56:43] hi
[56:45] now i'm going to read from acts 16 again
[56:49] but i'd like you to look at the map
[56:52] while i talk about this so you can get a
[56:53] better idea what's going on some context
[56:55] so when you
[56:56] hear about paul's travels you have a
[56:57] better idea of what's really going on
[57:00] now when they had gone throughout
[57:01] phrygia which is here
[57:05] and the region of galatia up here so
[57:08] even though this is showing a red line
[57:10] going straight they
[57:12] probably didn't exactly follow that line
[57:14] they didn't have this map
[57:16] they were forbidden of the holy ghost to
[57:18] preach the word in asia
[57:20] so so they're they're here and now
[57:22] they're moving into this area and
[57:24] and they want to preach the word that's
[57:26] what's in their heart they want to share
[57:28] that's what's in our heart
[57:29] we want to share the lord says not here
[57:33] not now after they would come to my sia
[57:37] which is up here they say to go into
[57:40] bithynia they decided well okay we'll go
[57:42] around asia
[57:43] and the lord said um no i
[57:47] i don't think so the spirit suffered
[57:48] them not so at this point
[57:50] paul and silas and perhaps timothy
[57:52] they'd walked from here that's about
[57:54] four or five hundred miles
[57:56] and they're doing this on foot there's
[57:59] there's not uber
[58:00] and there's not uh planes and there's
[58:02] not uh
[58:03] somebody with a rickshaw this is a
[58:05] different asia right it's like walking
[58:08] from tucson to los angeles although not
[58:10] through the sonoran desert
[58:12] so passing by my sia they came to troas
[58:15] little
[58:16] little town here on the coast a little
[58:17] port so that's maybe another 100 miles
[58:20] 150 miles
[58:22] they had maybe they needed to buy new
[58:24] sandals and i don't know
[58:25] the uncertainty in the distance is
[58:27] because
[58:29] we don't know the exact route they
[58:31] traveled
[58:33] on verse 11 i'll read therefore losing
[58:35] from troas in other words they're in a
[58:37] boat now
[58:39] we so luke has joined them
[58:42] up until now it was they but luke has
[58:44] joined him in troas
[58:46] came with a straight course to
[58:48] samothrace
[58:49] right here this little island halfway
[58:51] about 80 miles
[58:53] you do that in the daytime the wind's
[58:55] good you
[58:56] go into port at night you don't have gps
[58:58] you don't have lights you don't have red
[59:00] lights and green lights and all that to
[59:02] mark the
[59:02] port and starboard and so forth and the
[59:04] next day after they overnighted they
[59:06] came to neopolis another 80 miles or so
[59:09] and then they walked to philippi about
[59:11] another
[59:12] 20 miles which is the chief city of that
[59:14] part of macedonia in a colony
[59:16] and we're in that city abiding certain
[59:18] days
[59:20] so we see how paul and his company could
[59:22] immediately respond to a vision-based
[59:25] request to come to macedonia
[59:27] because they were on the coast the lord
[59:29] had told them don't go there and
[59:31] now they can go there because the
[59:33] transportation's available
[59:35] the lord's timing is always perfect he
[59:37] always sets things up exactly the way
[59:39] they need to be set up
[59:40] and if we're just obedient and
[59:42] responsive to what he wants us to do
[59:46] it's all there okay so they traveled
[59:49] onto philippi
[59:51] and then they stopped
[59:54] well here's here's a somebody that's a
[59:57] lot better drawing than i am
[59:59] thinks that's what philip i looked like
[1:00:01] and this is what the ruins of it look
[1:00:03] like today
[1:00:03] you can see this amphitheater here in
[1:00:05] this amphitheater here which
[1:00:07] will play a part in our story
[1:00:10] philippi why philippi what's special
[1:00:13] about
[1:00:14] philippi philippi played a very
[1:00:17] important role
[1:00:19] in the history of the roman empire and
[1:00:22] especially
[1:00:23] in the times just prior to jesus birth
[1:00:27] it's a lot more from town on the map
[1:00:31] on march 15 44 bc
[1:00:34] anybody remember that date yeah the ides
[1:00:38] of march
[1:00:38] it's about 40 years before jesus was
[1:00:41] born julius caesar was assassinated
[1:00:44] in a conspiracy led by two roman
[1:00:46] senators
[1:00:47] brutus and cassius
[1:00:50] julius had become the latin word i don't
[1:00:53] know but the translation is dictator for
[1:00:55] life
[1:00:56] of rome brutus and cassius wanted rome
[1:01:00] to remain
[1:01:00] a republic ostensibly representing and
[1:01:03] responsible to the people
[1:01:06] well a series of civil wars ensued for
[1:01:08] about two and a half years
[1:01:10] in october of 42 bc
[1:01:14] in a decisive battle near philippi
[1:01:19] brutus and cassia's forces were defeated
[1:01:21] by the army of
[1:01:22] mark anthony and octavian brutus and
[1:01:25] cassius committed suicide
[1:01:28] octavian eventually became emperor
[1:01:30] changed his name to augustus
[1:01:32] and was ruling the roman empire when
[1:01:34] jesus was born
[1:01:36] this happened in philippi so this set
[1:01:40] the stage
[1:01:42] for jesus ministry in the later spread
[1:01:44] of the good news the gospel
[1:01:47] if you've ever participated in any kind
[1:01:49] of a play or
[1:01:50] drama or production you probably know
[1:01:54] that the stage doesn't set itself
[1:01:58] and this drama that's going to be played
[1:02:00] out is so
[1:02:01] important to all of us that god
[1:02:05] watched over every detail no matter how
[1:02:08] minor
[1:02:10] and spared no expense in setting the
[1:02:13] stage
[1:02:15] even to the giving of his own blood
[1:02:20] back to philippi
[1:02:23] a coin was struck in philippi to
[1:02:26] commemorate augustus victory
[1:02:28] the coin was first minted around 31 bc
[1:02:31] about the time augustus was declared
[1:02:33] emperor
[1:02:34] and the last one was struck 14 a.d about
[1:02:37] the time
[1:02:38] jesus was in the temple amazing
[1:02:40] everybody
[1:02:43] now i i have one of these coins and i
[1:02:46] intended to bring it with me but i
[1:02:48] managed to forget in my
[1:02:50] haste to get here this evening so i
[1:02:51] apologize but
[1:02:53] but this coin was in use in philippi
[1:02:56] during the episodes and acts that we
[1:02:58] just read
[1:02:59] on the screen you can see it a lot
[1:03:01] better than if i was holding this thing
[1:03:02] here about the size of a penny right
[1:03:06] so on the slide you'll see here on the
[1:03:08] left we have one side of the coin
[1:03:11] vic for victory oddly enough even though
[1:03:14] it's latin
[1:03:15] and it looks like a vg but it's aug is
[1:03:18] for augustus
[1:03:21] this is celebrating the victory that
[1:03:23] augustus's forces had
[1:03:25] in philippi okay and here we have the
[1:03:28] goddess victoria holding the wreath the
[1:03:30] victor's wreath
[1:03:33] do you see something else here i looked
[1:03:36] at this coin and
[1:03:37] and i saw something else but it it it's
[1:03:40] just me
[1:03:40] it's nothing to do actually with
[1:03:42] philippians but a few years ago
[1:03:44] i shared with you how octavian though
[1:03:46] not a biological offspring of
[1:03:48] julius claimed him as his father through
[1:03:51] adoption does that sound familiar and
[1:03:54] changed his name from octavian
[1:03:56] to augustus he claimed julius was a god
[1:03:59] and proclaimed himself to be the son of
[1:04:02] a
[1:04:03] god well what i see here is a woman
[1:04:07] may maybe a bride rising up
[1:04:11] standing tall her feet are firmly
[1:04:14] planted on a rock
[1:04:16] she's achieved victory through the son
[1:04:18] of god
[1:04:19] jesus all in this
[1:04:23] ancient coin from philippi and here we
[1:04:25] have
[1:04:26] paul and silas calling out a bride to
[1:04:28] jesus christ through faith in his grace
[1:04:30] and love
[1:04:31] in the very city where this coin was
[1:04:33] minted some two thousand years ago and
[1:04:35] was
[1:04:36] then in current circulation okay back to
[1:04:39] the coin
[1:04:41] on the right side of the screen you can
[1:04:44] see
[1:04:44] the words cohort for cohort that's like
[1:04:48] a
[1:04:49] a unit in the army about the size of a
[1:04:51] company when i was in the army 50 years
[1:04:53] ago a company
[1:04:54] was yet varied in size around 100 people
[1:04:58] pray for the praetorian guard the palace
[1:05:01] guard
[1:05:03] and phil for philippi this is
[1:05:05] celebrating that victory and
[1:05:08] they surround three military standards
[1:05:10] which represent loyalty
[1:05:12] courage and strength a kind of a
[1:05:14] three-in-one
[1:05:16] the little images on the top of the
[1:05:17] slides that you have seen and we'll see
[1:05:20] your photographs i took you the actual
[1:05:21] coin that i have
[1:05:22] just to keep this tie in with uh with
[1:05:25] philippians
[1:05:27] now i did not obtain that coin when it
[1:05:30] was new
[1:05:30] right i'm gray but i'm not that old
[1:05:35] well philippi itself was a roman colony
[1:05:40] in macedonia many veterans of that
[1:05:43] battle were given a plot of land
[1:05:45] to settle on a good way to reward
[1:05:48] service
[1:05:48] and to keep them out of rome in case
[1:05:51] they decided to side with the other guy
[1:05:53] the next time there was a political
[1:05:54] dispute
[1:05:56] so now with some context about philippi
[1:06:00] let's get back to acts
[1:06:05] we read acts 16 um starting at verse 13.
[1:06:09] on the sabbath we went out of the city
[1:06:12] philippi by a riverside
[1:06:14] where prayer was one to be made and we
[1:06:17] sat down
[1:06:18] spake unto the women that resorted
[1:06:20] feather
[1:06:21] and a certain woman named lydia a seller
[1:06:24] of purple
[1:06:25] of the city of thyroid tire which
[1:06:27] worship god heard us
[1:06:28] i put this little piece of map in here
[1:06:30] because this region of western turkey
[1:06:32] was
[1:06:33] called lydia via tara was a a city in
[1:06:36] that area
[1:06:38] it's kind of like moving to l.a and
[1:06:39] calling yourself arizona
[1:06:42] and are they israel's not an uncommon
[1:06:44] name
[1:06:46] well lydia in whose heart and in lydia's
[1:06:48] heart the lord opened
[1:06:52] paul didn't open it silas didn't open it
[1:06:54] the lord opened it
[1:06:55] and she attended unto the things that
[1:06:58] were spoken by paul she
[1:07:00] he got their attention he got her
[1:07:02] attention and when she was baptized
[1:07:05] he really got her attention and her
[1:07:08] household
[1:07:10] she besought us saying if you've judged
[1:07:13] me
[1:07:14] to be faithful to the lord come into my
[1:07:17] house
[1:07:18] and abide there and she constrained us
[1:07:24] she must have been pretty persuasive
[1:07:26] constrained means to force
[1:07:28] contrary to nature to compel by entity
[1:07:30] in other words
[1:07:31] i'm not taking no for an answer you boys
[1:07:34] are staying at my place
[1:07:37] then paul and silas went there spent the
[1:07:39] night left town haven't seen the vision
[1:07:41] fulfilled
[1:07:42] right no wrong
[1:07:45] they stay and they continue preaching
[1:07:48] and proclaiming
[1:07:50] the good news we're familiar with the
[1:07:51] story there's a demon-possessed
[1:07:54] slave girl who follows him around for
[1:07:56] several days we don't know how long
[1:07:58] that they were in town preaching but she
[1:08:01] was declaring
[1:08:02] listen to paul he has the words of
[1:08:05] salvation
[1:08:06] she was telling the truth she was
[1:08:08] witnessing to their witness
[1:08:12] yeah we know the demons believe
[1:08:15] they they tremble but knowledge of
[1:08:18] christ
[1:08:19] is not salvation by christ
[1:08:22] our sins must be confessed his gift of
[1:08:26] life
[1:08:27] must be accepted and not just reciting a
[1:08:30] sinner's prayer
[1:08:31] but a change of heart repentance
[1:08:36] paul gets exasperated
[1:08:40] and casts the demon out of the girl
[1:08:43] this leads to a riot incited by the
[1:08:46] slave girls owners who
[1:08:48] just lost their income that they would
[1:08:50] get from her so
[1:08:52] we read in acts 16 verse 22
[1:08:56] the multitude rose up together against
[1:08:58] them
[1:09:00] and the magistrates rent off their
[1:09:02] clothes
[1:09:03] this means that the magistrates had the
[1:09:05] clothing violently torn off of paul and
[1:09:08] silas
[1:09:09] they didn't rip their own clothes they
[1:09:11] ripped the clothes off of these guys
[1:09:13] and commanded to beat them
[1:09:16] and when they'd laid many stripes on
[1:09:18] them roman flogging
[1:09:20] was brutal many who were beaten
[1:09:25] didn't survive this isn't 10 lashes with
[1:09:28] a wet noodle kind of thing
[1:09:31] they cast them into prison charging the
[1:09:34] jailer to keep them safely
[1:09:36] who having received such a charge thrust
[1:09:40] them
[1:09:40] into the inner prison and made their
[1:09:43] feet
[1:09:43] fast in the stocks
[1:09:48] this is the traditional site of the
[1:09:50] philippian jail where paul and silas
[1:09:52] were imprisoned
[1:09:54] what a miserable state backs bleeding
[1:09:59] and great pain not even an aspirin to
[1:10:03] relieve it
[1:10:04] filthy prison conditions
[1:10:08] they weren't disinfecting for covet 19.
[1:10:12] ankles clamped in
[1:10:15] notched wooden blocks chained
[1:10:18] probably sitting in the waste from the
[1:10:21] previous unfortunates who had been
[1:10:22] fastened in those stalks
[1:10:24] in a stone chamber no heat
[1:10:28] if it's cold no cooling if it's hot
[1:10:32] no cot to lay down no chair to sit on
[1:10:36] no food no water
[1:10:40] a stench and the foul stale
[1:10:44] heir unjustly accused
[1:10:47] no one to help soothe
[1:10:51] or comfort what's their reaction
[1:10:56] at midnight paul and silas prayed and i
[1:10:59] don't think so is this was just lord
[1:11:01] bless all your believers around the
[1:11:03] world amen
[1:11:04] i don't think it was now i lay me down
[1:11:06] to sleep
[1:11:07] no they prayed and they sang
[1:11:11] praises unto god
[1:11:16] they didn't just whisper the prisoners
[1:11:18] heard them
[1:11:20] now this is the only instance recorded
[1:11:24] in the book of acts where paul sings
[1:11:29] he and silas equally miserable and weak
[1:11:33] both singing praises and hymns to god
[1:11:38] no musical accompaniment
[1:11:42] the other prisoners listening maybe they
[1:11:45] were singing in latin or
[1:11:46] greek or aramaic or hebrew we don't know
[1:11:49] we don't know if the others could even
[1:11:50] understand the words
[1:11:52] but they were singing loudly enough
[1:11:55] to be heard by the others and wasn't
[1:11:58] proclaiming
[1:11:59] teaching about and worshipping the one
[1:12:02] true god why they were in such a
[1:12:03] condition in the first place
[1:12:06] it's like daniel defying the king's
[1:12:08] decree what were they thinking
[1:12:12] and suddenly there was a great
[1:12:16] earthquake
[1:12:18] so that the foundations of the prison
[1:12:21] were shaken immediately all the doors
[1:12:24] were opened
[1:12:25] and everyone's bands were loosed
[1:12:29] and the keeper of the prison awaking out
[1:12:31] of his sleep
[1:12:33] maybe he thought they were singing a
[1:12:34] lullaby i don't know the guy fell asleep
[1:12:36] seeing the prison doors open he drew out
[1:12:40] a sword and would have killed himself
[1:12:42] supposing the prisoners had been fled
[1:12:45] the fate that he would suffer would be a
[1:12:48] lot more painful than just
[1:12:50] a little hairy carry right but paul
[1:12:54] seeing what the guy was about to do
[1:12:56] cried with a loud voice saying
[1:12:57] do thyself no harm we're all here
[1:13:03] notice the earthquake
[1:13:07] paul and silas didn't get up and leave
[1:13:09] come on guys let's get out of here
[1:13:12] the miracle wasn't for them it was for
[1:13:15] the jailer
[1:13:17] at first the earthquake simply awakens
[1:13:19] him
[1:13:20] then he sees the prison and
[1:13:23] shambles and starts to worry then he
[1:13:26] sees the prisoners are free
[1:13:27] he really starts to worry he gets ready
[1:13:29] to quickly kill himself it's preferable
[1:13:31] to the punishment he'll otherwise
[1:13:33] receive but paul
[1:13:35] stops him remember the angel that
[1:13:37] stopped abraham from sacrificing isaac
[1:13:40] paul stops the sky
[1:13:41] do thyself no harm we're still all here
[1:13:48] then he called for a light and sleepily
[1:13:52] sauntering and not now he sprang in
[1:13:57] he's motivated he came trembling it
[1:14:00] wasn't only the earth it was shaking
[1:14:01] that night
[1:14:03] and fell down before paul and silas on
[1:14:07] that
[1:14:07] filthy prison floor
[1:14:11] and brought them out and said
[1:14:15] sirs what must i do to be saved
[1:14:20] what shook the jailer even more than the
[1:14:23] earthquake
[1:14:25] he saw the demeanor of these prisoners
[1:14:27] when they were brought in
[1:14:30] and now he experiences their concern
[1:14:33] for him
[1:14:36] coupled with their worship and singing
[1:14:39] rejoicing in the midst of adversity
[1:14:42] integrity instead of taking an easy out
[1:14:45] this
[1:14:45] captured him
[1:14:48] what is this their concern for the
[1:14:51] safety of the one who put them in the
[1:14:53] worst part of the prison
[1:14:57] and they said believe on the lord jesus
[1:15:01] christ
[1:15:02] and thou shalt be saved and thy house
[1:15:06] now we know each person has to come to
[1:15:09] the lord
[1:15:09] individually my faith will not
[1:15:13] save my children but if i have faith
[1:15:16] the lord can reach them i need to have
[1:15:18] the same faith for them
[1:15:21] that i have for myself
[1:15:24] they still have to repent and accept the
[1:15:26] gift of life but
[1:15:27] my faith says they're going to do that
[1:15:30] we're told what
[1:15:31] only believe some things no all
[1:15:34] things are possible
[1:15:37] and they spake unto him the word of the
[1:15:39] lord unto all that were in his house
[1:15:43] and he took them out the next day
[1:15:47] no the same hour of the night what is it
[1:15:50] two three four in the morning now
[1:15:52] washed their stripes and was baptized
[1:15:55] he and all his straightway
[1:15:58] they're not wasting any time
[1:16:02] and when he had brought them into the
[1:16:04] prison again
[1:16:05] no no into his house he set food before
[1:16:08] them
[1:16:09] and rejoiced believing in god
[1:16:13] with all his house
[1:16:16] and when it was day they were having an
[1:16:19] all-night meeting
[1:16:20] when it was day the magistrate sent the
[1:16:23] sergeant saying
[1:16:25] let those guys go and the keeper of the
[1:16:29] prison told this saying to paul
[1:16:30] the magistrates are sent to let you go
[1:16:33] now you can go
[1:16:34] go in peace god bless you shalom
[1:16:39] so paul and silas grateful for their
[1:16:41] release walked away
[1:16:43] that's not what it says but
[1:16:47] paul said to the sergeants the
[1:16:50] magistrates have beaten us
[1:16:52] openly uncondemned no trial
[1:16:55] never asked us what happened and we're
[1:16:58] romans
[1:16:59] silas was a roman too and have cast
[1:17:02] us into prison and now do they thrust us
[1:17:06] out
[1:17:07] secretly ain't going to happen
[1:17:10] nay verily but let the magistrates come
[1:17:13] themselves
[1:17:14] and personally fetch us out
[1:17:18] paul is no longer the submissive
[1:17:21] subversive
[1:17:23] he's refusing to leave the prison
[1:17:28] the sergeants told these words unto the
[1:17:30] magistrates and the magistrates feared
[1:17:33] when they heard that paul and silas were
[1:17:35] romans
[1:17:36] does that strike you as strange
[1:17:40] that's a very odd development we'll get
[1:17:43] to it in just a moment
[1:17:46] and the magistrates came and pleaded
[1:17:49] with them
[1:17:49] besought them and brought them
[1:17:52] accompanied escorted
[1:17:54] them out and asked him please leave
[1:17:58] right desired them to depart out of our
[1:18:01] city
[1:18:02] and what you see here there's felipe
[1:18:04] where the arrow is in this big long road
[1:18:06] here of course you have to take a ferry
[1:18:08] across the water here but this is called
[1:18:11] the via
[1:18:11] ignacio it was constructed in the second
[1:18:14] century bc so the road was
[1:18:16] about 200 years old uh when paul and
[1:18:19] then were going on it's 2200 years old
[1:18:21] now
[1:18:22] and uh it's not in such terrible shape
[1:18:25] the the photograph part of it
[1:18:28] uh is the portion of the road that uh
[1:18:31] uh hang on just a second yeah there we
[1:18:34] are this part of it here
[1:18:35] that's part of the road that paul and
[1:18:37] silas walked on escorted by the
[1:18:39] magistrates
[1:18:41] if you keep going you'll be out of town
[1:18:42] don't don't stop keep keep going
[1:18:47] so what happens they went out of the
[1:18:48] prison and entered into the house of
[1:18:50] lydia
[1:18:52] and the king james version when they had
[1:18:54] seen the brethren
[1:18:55] now a little clarification here this is
[1:18:57] lydia's house
[1:18:58] right the greek word is eldoffos
[1:19:03] at alphos it's translated as brethren
[1:19:05] but literally it means
[1:19:07] from the womb it includes the sisters
[1:19:10] too you'll find other translations where
[1:19:12] it says the brothers and the sisters so
[1:19:13] this
[1:19:14] this brethren thing here is not a gender
[1:19:16] specific term
[1:19:18] um anyway they comforted them
[1:19:22] paul and silas bleeding hurting wounded
[1:19:25] wincing but they're comforting their new
[1:19:27] friends and converts who had undoubtedly
[1:19:29] been in prayer for them while they were
[1:19:30] locked up
[1:19:32] and they departed
[1:19:36] how strange does it strike you as
[1:19:40] strange
[1:19:41] paul and silas could have asserted their
[1:19:43] status as romans when all this trouble
[1:19:45] was coming down and they never would
[1:19:47] have been beaten they never would have
[1:19:48] to spend the night in prison
[1:19:51] why didn't they do that
[1:19:55] why didn't they
[1:20:00] remember brother branham's story of the
[1:20:03] green plaid shirt
[1:20:06] he'd had a vision being on a hunting
[1:20:07] trip and shooting a caribou
[1:20:09] with 42 inch horns and then killing a
[1:20:12] nine
[1:20:13] foot silver tip grizzly bear in the
[1:20:15] vision there was a man
[1:20:18] wearing a green plaid shirt
[1:20:21] when he saw ed biskull in that shirt he
[1:20:23] knew the vision was going to be
[1:20:24] fulfilled
[1:20:26] after killing the caribou he was walking
[1:20:28] back to camp with bud sothwick and
[1:20:30] suddenly a grizzly bear rose up in their
[1:20:32] path
[1:20:33] brother branham shot once bear kept
[1:20:36] charging
[1:20:38] bud told him shoot it again
[1:20:42] grizzlies are tough but brother branham
[1:20:44] said the vision i only shot at once
[1:20:47] and this bear's charging
[1:20:51] collapses at their feet
[1:20:55] well in acts we're told paul saw a man
[1:21:00] from macedonia in his vision
[1:21:03] luke's careful to point that out to us
[1:21:05] in the narrative
[1:21:08] paul accepted brutal punishment for his
[1:21:10] testimony rather than declare he was a
[1:21:12] roman citizen and
[1:21:13] likely avoid all that
[1:21:17] why didn't he now this is just my
[1:21:18] opinion this is
[1:21:20] brother lyle speculating okay
[1:21:23] i think he was still waiting to see the
[1:21:25] man in the vision
[1:21:26] he was waiting to see that vision
[1:21:28] fulfilled he was looking for the green
[1:21:30] checkered shirt if you will
[1:21:31] when they dragged him into the jailer
[1:21:33] and the jailer made him fast in the
[1:21:35] stocks i think paul
[1:21:36] recognized the jailer as being the
[1:21:39] macedonian man in the vision that he saw
[1:21:42] my personal opinion come and help us no
[1:21:45] wonder
[1:21:46] they were praying no wonder they were
[1:21:48] worshiping they knew what was going to
[1:21:50] happen
[1:21:53] speculation ended let's get back
[1:21:56] after leaving the prison they went to
[1:21:58] lydia's house
[1:22:00] and comforted them and being escorted by
[1:22:03] the magistrates may have brought
[1:22:05] some amount of protection to the
[1:22:07] reputation of that new congregation
[1:22:09] then they leave philippi
[1:22:13] and continue on their journey spreading
[1:22:15] the good news of the gospel to
[1:22:16] thessalonica
[1:22:17] maria athens these events most likely
[1:22:21] happened around 50 to 52 a.d
[1:22:26] now luke left out a pretty important
[1:22:28] detail
[1:22:30] about the church at lydia's house that
[1:22:31] day
[1:22:33] we'll get to that next time god willing
[1:22:38] anyone recall our opening verse
[1:22:41] from matthew i was in prison
[1:22:46] remember i titled this philippians
[1:22:50] joy and irony
[1:22:54] irony the dictionary defines irony as
[1:22:58] the use of words to express something
[1:23:00] different from an opposite to their
[1:23:02] literal meaning
[1:23:03] somebody gives you some food that they
[1:23:05] know you don't like and you say
[1:23:07] thanks a lot yeah
[1:23:10] and it also means incongruity which is a
[1:23:13] dictionary fancy word for
[1:23:15] inconsistency between what is expected
[1:23:18] and what
[1:23:18] actually is well then where's
[1:23:22] the inconsistency or the irony here
[1:23:26] who was in prison being visited
[1:23:30] the jailer
[1:23:34] a different meaning to prison ministry
[1:23:37] how many are willing to perform prison
[1:23:39] ministry by becoming the prisoner
[1:23:42] rather than the visitor so you can reach
[1:23:44] the jailer
[1:23:45] rather than the jails
[1:23:49] now i'm not raising my hand either
[1:23:52] yet some have been in this congregation
[1:23:55] in that condition been prisoners
[1:23:57] and reached others while serving time
[1:24:00] god
[1:24:00] was able to use them god can use you
[1:24:02] wherever you are whatever your condition
[1:24:04] is whatever the circumstances
[1:24:07] he's not limited by those
[1:24:12] well that's a lot of background for the
[1:24:14] letter to the philippians
[1:24:17] i wanted to give you some context for
[1:24:19] the letter that paul wrote to them
[1:24:21] while he was under house arrest in rome
[1:24:24] about 10 years later
[1:24:26] now that's house arrest complete with
[1:24:29] ankle monitor
[1:24:31] yeah that's right we'll get to that
[1:24:35] in fact why wait let's do it now paul
[1:24:38] was sent in chains to rome
[1:24:40] to await the result of his appeal to
[1:24:42] caesar after
[1:24:44] his arrest in jerusalem it's all
[1:24:47] recorded in the last chapters of acts
[1:24:50] while in rome he wrote a number of
[1:24:52] letters
[1:24:53] which has survived not the originals but
[1:24:55] copies
[1:24:56] and have come to us in our new testament
[1:25:01] one of these letters was to the church
[1:25:04] at
[1:25:05] philippi he was in prison in philippi
[1:25:08] we've just reviewed that
[1:25:10] and on the occasion of this letter he
[1:25:12] writes to them from
[1:25:14] prison in rome
[1:25:17] seems paul just can't stay away from
[1:25:19] prison ministry
[1:25:21] well i'm going to read a little bit from
[1:25:24] the niv
[1:25:25] rather than the king james but i'll put
[1:25:27] the king james on the screen at the same
[1:25:28] time that i'm reading the niv
[1:25:30] philippians chapter 1 he says now i want
[1:25:34] you to know
[1:25:35] brothers and sisters that what has
[1:25:37] happened to me
[1:25:39] has actually served to advance the
[1:25:42] gospel
[1:25:45] as a result it has become clear
[1:25:48] throughout the whole
[1:25:49] palace guard and to everyone else
[1:25:54] that i am in chains for christ
[1:25:59] let's skip to acts 28 for just a little
[1:26:01] more context here
[1:26:04] when we came to rome the centurion
[1:26:07] delivered the prisoners to the captain
[1:26:09] of the guard
[1:26:10] but paul was suffered or allowed to
[1:26:12] dwell by himself with a
[1:26:14] soldier that kept him the photograph
[1:26:17] here is a relief
[1:26:18] of the roman palace guard or praetorian
[1:26:20] guard
[1:26:21] from about 52 a.d is when this was
[1:26:23] carved so this was a 3d image that they
[1:26:27] took in rome about that time
[1:26:30] now i'm we're told it was customary
[1:26:33] for a person under arrest and guard to
[1:26:36] be chained
[1:26:36] to the guard i further understand that
[1:26:39] this was about a 12-hour shift for the
[1:26:41] guard
[1:26:44] well let's pick up acts a few verses
[1:26:46] later in fact the very end of acts 28
[1:26:48] verse 30.
[1:26:49] paul dwelt two whole years in his own
[1:26:52] hired house
[1:26:54] lord willing we'll discuss that next
[1:26:55] time and received
[1:26:57] all that came in unto him
[1:27:01] what was he doing kicking back you know
[1:27:04] preaching the kingdom of god and
[1:27:07] teaching those things which concern
[1:27:10] the lord jesus christ with all
[1:27:12] confidence
[1:27:13] no man forbidding him so
[1:27:16] the guards chained to paul were the
[1:27:19] equivalent of today's ankle monitor
[1:27:21] for a prison under house arrest
[1:27:26] who was the captive of whom
[1:27:29] that brings new meaning to having a
[1:27:31] captive audience right
[1:27:33] and this captive audience of paul's
[1:27:36] heard the gospel
[1:27:38] with all confidence no man imagine
[1:27:41] imagine being chained to the messenger
[1:27:45] of your age
[1:27:46] for 12 hours at a time
[1:27:51] how effective was paul's witness with us
[1:27:53] while he's with those guards let's get
[1:27:54] back to philippians
[1:27:56] philippians 1 and again to top his king
[1:27:59] james the bottom is the niv and i'll
[1:28:00] read the niv
[1:28:02] because of my chains most of the
[1:28:04] brothers and sisters
[1:28:06] have become confident in the lord and
[1:28:08] dare all the more
[1:28:10] to proclaim the gospel without fear he's
[1:28:12] talking about
[1:28:13] in the city of rome so we see that the
[1:28:16] believers in rome
[1:28:18] were emboldened by paul's example
[1:28:22] and we also see as fall closes his
[1:28:24] letter philippians chapter 4 verse 22
[1:28:26] all the saints salute you chiefly or
[1:28:29] especially
[1:28:30] they that are of caesar's household
[1:28:33] those are the palace guards
[1:28:36] it's clear that at least some of the
[1:28:37] guards chained to paul
[1:28:39] received the good news too
[1:28:43] now we don't have time to go over this
[1:28:46] letter line by line or
[1:28:48] verse by verse but its main theme
[1:28:51] is very clear we should have joy
[1:28:54] in the midst of suffering regardless of
[1:28:57] our circumstance
[1:28:58] who better to understand this than the
[1:29:01] philippians
[1:29:03] who witnessed a miracle as paul and
[1:29:05] silas rejoiced and worshipped in the
[1:29:07] midst of suffering
[1:29:08] while imprisoned in philippi a very
[1:29:12] appropriate
[1:29:13] message to that particular place
[1:29:17] in fact i think it's certain that the
[1:29:19] jailer assuming he was still alive was
[1:29:21] part of the congregation at philip high
[1:29:23] when this letter was received
[1:29:26] why would paul and silas have suffered
[1:29:28] so to have a reception to the gospel and
[1:29:30] baptism of the entire family of the
[1:29:33] jailer
[1:29:33] whose name we don't know if their faith
[1:29:36] wasn't genuine
[1:29:39] paul uses the words rejoice joy or glad
[1:29:43] 17 times in this letter in the niv 14
[1:29:47] times in the king james
[1:29:50] and this isn't just some superficial why
[1:29:52] worry be happy
[1:29:55] paul's facing a death sentence in rome
[1:29:59] if anyone could testify to the honesty
[1:30:02] of paul's insistence
[1:30:04] that the philippians rejoice in the
[1:30:06] midst of suffering
[1:30:08] it was the jailer and any of the other
[1:30:11] prisoners that might still be around if
[1:30:13] you could ask them that were there that
[1:30:14] night
[1:30:17] paul can be joyful in prison
[1:30:21] it might be more accurate to say that he
[1:30:23] was able to find joy
[1:30:24] in spite of being in prison he wasn't
[1:30:27] necessarily glad
[1:30:28] about his situation oh boy stocks
[1:30:32] i just love stocks chain me
[1:30:38] but in spite of that situation
[1:30:42] and in this condition he exhorts the
[1:30:44] philippian believers
[1:30:45] philippians 4 4 rejoice in the lord from
[1:30:48] time to time
[1:30:50] no rejoice in the lord always and again
[1:30:53] i say
[1:30:53] i'm going to emphasize it i'm going to
[1:30:55] repeat it rejoice
[1:30:59] a very prominent theme throughout the
[1:31:01] letter to the church at philippi
[1:31:03] is finding joy in the lord
[1:31:06] regardless of circumstances being
[1:31:09] content
[1:31:10] and living like it another example
[1:31:14] paul relates how some in rome are
[1:31:16] preaching the gospel
[1:31:18] out of good will but others are doing so
[1:31:21] out of envy
[1:31:22] and rivalry what's his attitude about
[1:31:26] that
[1:31:28] philippians 1
[1:31:31] king james says what then
[1:31:33] notwithstanding every way whether in
[1:31:35] pretense or in truth
[1:31:36] christ is preached and therein i do
[1:31:40] rejoice
[1:31:40] yea and will rejoice and the nlt it says
[1:31:45] their motive doesn't matter whether
[1:31:48] their motives are false or genuine
[1:31:50] the message about christ is being
[1:31:52] preached either way so i rejoice and i
[1:31:54] will continue to be rejoice
[1:31:57] but what about those guys with the false
[1:31:58] motives remember
[1:32:01] jesus talks about that lord lord we
[1:32:04] preached the gospel we did mighty
[1:32:05] miracles in your name
[1:32:07] depart from me ye that work iniquity i
[1:32:10] never knew you
[1:32:13] the person that receives the gospel
[1:32:15] whether it's from a person whose heart
[1:32:17] is right or not that person still
[1:32:19] receives the gospel
[1:32:21] but if your heart's wrong when you're
[1:32:22] presenting it look out
[1:32:25] be careful brother lyle
[1:32:28] again we see paul emphasizing joy
[1:32:31] in spite of the motives of those who may
[1:32:33] be simply trying to make his life more
[1:32:35] miserable or
[1:32:36] otherwise lessen his influence
[1:32:40] moving on paul said we should be
[1:32:43] like-minded
[1:32:44] and this will bring him even more joy
[1:32:46] philippians 2
[1:32:48] we read if there be therefore any
[1:32:50] consolation in christ
[1:32:52] if any comfort of love of
[1:32:56] any fellowship of the spirit if any
[1:32:59] bowels
[1:33:00] compassion and mercies
[1:33:03] do you believe they're such do you want
[1:33:05] to partake
[1:33:06] and participate paul tells us how
[1:33:09] fulfill you my joy be like-minded
[1:33:14] have the mind of christ right having the
[1:33:16] same love
[1:33:18] being of one accord of one mind
[1:33:24] i'm taking a hit for the team i need you
[1:33:27] the team to stick together
[1:33:31] but what if the body of believers are
[1:33:34] not like-minded
[1:33:36] what if there's discord or strife
[1:33:40] what do we do then well on the sermon on
[1:33:44] the mount
[1:33:45] jesus said blessed are the peacemakers
[1:33:49] for they should be called the children
[1:33:51] of god this isn't guys that
[1:33:53] fly around in airplanes and try and get
[1:33:54] people to stop fighting wars
[1:33:57] he's talking paul's jesus is talking
[1:33:59] about the body of christ
[1:34:02] peacemakers this is the only occurrence
[1:34:06] of this word
[1:34:08] in the entire bible
[1:34:13] this is a photo of uh some artwork in
[1:34:16] our home
[1:34:17] it's an illustration of jerusalem it was
[1:34:20] given to me by a dear friend who has
[1:34:21] since passed on named jim reynolds
[1:34:24] jim was a christian man i met him in the
[1:34:27] late 1970s and
[1:34:29] he worked for me at two different
[1:34:30] companies over the course of about 20
[1:34:32] years
[1:34:34] on yom kippur october 6
[1:34:37] 1973 israel was attacked
[1:34:41] by egypt and syria in the aftermath of
[1:34:45] that war a fragile
[1:34:46] end of hostilities occurred the united
[1:34:49] nations sent a team of observers to the
[1:34:51] golan which forms a border in the north
[1:34:53] between israel and syria
[1:34:55] and another team to the sinai in the
[1:34:57] south between israel and
[1:34:59] egypt my friend jim worked for the un
[1:35:03] in the sinai as one of the observers he
[1:35:06] purchased
[1:35:07] that art when in jerusalem during that
[1:35:09] mission and gave it to heather and me
[1:35:11] many years later
[1:35:13] jim's mission was not a peacemaker
[1:35:18] he was a peacekeeper one who tried to
[1:35:21] keep the factions from attacking each
[1:35:23] other but not one who tried to get them
[1:35:25] to settle their differences when the
[1:35:28] apostle paul wrote this letter
[1:35:30] there was trouble in philippi and this
[1:35:33] young
[1:35:34] church that paul loved so much
[1:35:37] there was discord it was so bad
[1:35:41] paul was made aware of it hundreds of
[1:35:43] miles away
[1:35:44] presumably by a frauditos the man who
[1:35:47] transcribed this letter for paul and
[1:35:48] carried it back to philippi on his
[1:35:50] behalf
[1:35:52] philippi wasn't a very friendly place
[1:35:55] for the gospel
[1:35:56] remember how paul and silas were treated
[1:35:59] but even in the light of this external
[1:36:01] pressure
[1:36:02] there were divisions among believers
[1:36:06] infighting if you will pastor matt's
[1:36:09] told us of
[1:36:10] hostility he's witnessed between fellow
[1:36:12] christians over the recent election
[1:36:15] extreme partisanship
[1:36:18] is that how we should be acting towards
[1:36:20] one another
[1:36:22] and to the world around us
[1:36:26] let's read philippians 4 begins
[1:36:31] therefore my brethren dearly beloved and
[1:36:34] longed for
[1:36:35] my joy and crown so stand fast in the
[1:36:38] lord
[1:36:39] my dearly beloved this is a pretty
[1:36:42] impassioned plea
[1:36:44] paul is very serious about what follows
[1:36:49] it's an example it says
[1:36:52] i beseech yuariya and i beseech tsuntuke
[1:36:56] that they be of the same mind in the
[1:36:58] lord
[1:36:59] the nlt says now i appeal
[1:37:03] to yodia and suntuke please
[1:37:07] because you belong to the lord settle
[1:37:10] your disagreement and in case they need
[1:37:14] a little help
[1:37:15] a peacemaker paul continues i entreat
[1:37:18] thee also true yoke fellow that's a
[1:37:21] little
[1:37:21] strange help those women which labored
[1:37:25] with me in the gospel with clement also
[1:37:27] and with my other fellow laborers who
[1:37:29] are in the book of life
[1:37:32] nlt maybe helps a little bit i ask you
[1:37:34] my
[1:37:35] true partner what's that
[1:37:38] to help these two women for they worked
[1:37:40] hard with me telling others the good
[1:37:42] news
[1:37:43] the word translated as partner or yoke
[1:37:46] fellow
[1:37:47] it suits a ghost well it sounds like a
[1:37:50] strange word to us but
[1:37:52] it's a proper name like leonardo or
[1:37:54] marvin
[1:37:55] in other words paul is asking loyal
[1:37:57] suits a ghost to step
[1:37:59] in and be a peacemaker help settle this
[1:38:02] problem help settle the dispute these
[1:38:05] two people are believers
[1:38:07] let's get past this thing and how does
[1:38:10] he conclude
[1:38:11] this appeal he directs their attention
[1:38:14] to where their energy should be going we
[1:38:17] read this already rejoice in the lord
[1:38:20] always
[1:38:22] again i say rejoice
[1:38:26] i believe the holy spirit inspired the
[1:38:28] letters paul wrote
[1:38:30] and which are preserved for us in the
[1:38:33] new testament
[1:38:34] they're therefore a reason greater than
[1:38:36] the immediate context in
[1:38:38] this case of the church at philippi
[1:38:41] it's more than paul saying hello to a
[1:38:43] few friends as he
[1:38:44] closes the letter we sometimes have
[1:38:48] strife divisions in our churches today
[1:38:51] sometimes even
[1:38:52] right here if you see that
[1:38:56] be a peacemaker jesus said you'd be
[1:38:59] blessed
[1:39:00] and be called a child of god
[1:39:03] now paul goes on he doesn't just say
[1:39:06] stop it
[1:39:07] he he tells you what to do he he gives
[1:39:09] detail how to avoid these divisions in
[1:39:12] the first place
[1:39:13] some practical advice that we can apply
[1:39:16] in our day as well and i'll read this
[1:39:19] in the niv i find it a little bit
[1:39:21] clearer than the king james
[1:39:24] that verse 4 again rejoice in the lord
[1:39:26] always i will say it again
[1:39:28] rejoice let your gentleness be evident
[1:39:33] to all
[1:39:34] be considerate in all you do
[1:39:38] the lord is near this isn't talking
[1:39:40] about jesus
[1:39:41] is coming soon god transcends
[1:39:45] our limited universe's dimensions and
[1:39:48] constraints
[1:39:49] jesus said he'd be with us even in us
[1:39:53] until the end of the age you can't get
[1:39:55] more near
[1:39:57] than that remember the lord's here he's
[1:40:01] watching he's observing you
[1:40:02] you can't hide don't be
[1:40:06] anxious about anything
[1:40:10] but what in every situation
[1:40:14] every situation by prayer and petition
[1:40:17] with thanksgiving
[1:40:20] present your request to god
[1:40:23] be thankful right
[1:40:26] well if you do this what's going to be
[1:40:28] the result
[1:40:30] paul didn't end there the peace of god
[1:40:34] which transcends all understanding
[1:40:39] will guard your hearts and minds
[1:40:42] in christ jesus that's a promise
[1:40:47] there's no maybes finally
[1:40:51] brothers and sisters here's some
[1:40:52] hands-on advice
[1:40:55] how to stay focused not let divisions
[1:40:57] arise
[1:40:59] whatever's true whatever is noble
[1:41:04] whatever is right whatever is pure
[1:41:10] whatever is lovely whatever's admirable
[1:41:14] if anything is excellent or praiseworthy
[1:41:18] not just
[1:41:18] things that i may have listed here think
[1:41:21] about such things
[1:41:23] right keep your mind on jesus keep your
[1:41:27] focus where it belongs
[1:41:28] and and here comes a last bit of advice
[1:41:33] whatever you have learned or received or
[1:41:36] heard from me or seen in me
[1:41:40] put it into practice you do it too
[1:41:45] follow me as i follow christ is what
[1:41:48] paul is saying
[1:41:49] and again he reassures us the god of
[1:41:53] peace
[1:41:53] will be with you paul states the same
[1:41:57] advice in philippians chapter 3 and i'll
[1:42:00] go back to the king james for it
[1:42:02] brethren be followers together
[1:42:06] of me and mark them which walk
[1:42:10] so as you have us for an example
[1:42:13] in other words there are people that are
[1:42:16] doing what i've told them to do
[1:42:19] they're an example follow that example
[1:42:22] right keep your eyes on jesus sometimes
[1:42:25] you need gods with skin on them
[1:42:27] right philippians contains such a rich
[1:42:32] set of lessons for our lives
[1:42:33] i'd like to invite the musicians to
[1:42:36] please return
[1:42:38] there are at least at least two more
[1:42:41] important
[1:42:42] topics paul addresses in this epistle
[1:42:44] one is support
[1:42:46] as in financial support for the
[1:42:48] apostolic ministry
[1:42:50] and the other is the nature of suffering
[1:42:53] and persecution that it's not evidence
[1:42:56] of
[1:42:57] rejection by god or weakness of his
[1:42:59] power
[1:43:01] but it's a gift
[1:43:04] now there's not enough time this evening
[1:43:06] to cover those topics
[1:43:08] i hope to share them with you some
[1:43:10] future meeting
[1:43:11] so please just remember from tonight we
[1:43:14] should have joy
[1:43:16] in the lord regardless of our
[1:43:18] circumstances in spite of our
[1:43:20] circumstances
[1:43:21] we need to have unity that takes work
[1:43:25] we should be peacemakers we can disagree
[1:43:29] without being disagreeable
[1:43:31] and we have practical advice how to
[1:43:33] avoid conflict and how to keep our
[1:43:35] hearts and minds clean and pure
[1:43:37] before god as brother aaron comes to
[1:43:41] close tonight's wendy school

[1:47:45] through recently or
[1:47:48] and you've wondered you've questioned
[1:47:52] you didn't see the reason or under or
[1:47:54] understand the why
[1:47:57] we've heard today about paul's
[1:47:59] experience in silas i've always wondered
[1:48:01] if
[1:48:02] if silas didn't ask paul how did we end
[1:48:04] up here paul
[1:48:05] didn't expect this on the journey
[1:48:08] maybe you've you've got to a place in
[1:48:10] your life or a place where you've
[1:48:12] wondered lord
[1:48:12] how did why did this turn out this way
[1:48:16] but i challenge you if you believe god
[1:48:19] has everything ordained

[1:52:58] situation
[1:53:00] but god said i'll be with you even in
[1:53:02] you to the end of the world
[1:53:03] and paul gives us a think on these
[1:53:06] things
[1:53:07] take the mind and begin to say god your
[1:53:09] word says
[1:53:11] god your word says you said i can have
[1:53:13] peace and joy in the midst of my
[1:53:15] troubles
[1:53:16] you said you'll never leave me never
[1:53:18] forsake me
[1:53:19] you said you've broken every chain you
[1:53:22] said
[1:53:23] and that's what you begin to talk about
[1:53:24] and think about and then those around
[1:53:26] you
[1:53:27] say hey joe how can you be
[1:53:31] like this with a smile in your face in
[1:53:33] the midst of this trouble
[1:53:35] you say because i choose this over that
[1:53:39] and god's word never fails i think
[1:53:42] that's a reason why these things were
[1:53:44] recorded in the scriptures there are
[1:53:45] examples
[1:53:47] and we love them for that today remember
