[34:18] and
[34:22] for I will make with him
[34:33] good evening
[34:35] tonight
[34:36] we're going to continue our exploration
[34:38] in the book of Acts
[34:41] this time our studious Acts 11. this
[34:46] chapter has three parts
[34:48] it wraps up what I call The Curious Case
[34:50] of Cornelius which is in chapter 10
[34:53] which is setting the stage for the
[34:55] Gentile Church
[34:57] it then tells her the continuing spread
[34:59] of the Gospel among the scattered Jewish
[35:01] population of the region particularly to
[35:03] the north and Syria
[35:05] it concludes we're sending Aid
[35:09] to Jerusalem
[35:10] before we dig in
[35:12] let's pray together
[35:14] and approach the offer
[35:18] Lord Jesus acts sometimes seems like
[35:21] it's it's a history but in second
[35:23] Timothy
[35:25] Paul Rhoden said that all scripture is
[35:27] good for instruction for reproof for
[35:29] Doctrine Lord for instruction in
[35:32] righteousness
[35:33] Lord we're here this evening Lord as as
[35:36] people that desire to serve you that
[35:38] desire to be instructed the desire to
[35:41] hear from you that desire to enter into
[35:43] your word desire for that word to be
[35:45] living in us and moving through us and
[35:48] manifesting itself in it among us as our
[35:51] brother Jordan prayed this morning Lord
[35:52] that we would have that love one for
[35:54] another Lord and our love for you as
[35:57] brother Jonathan spoke two weeks ago
[35:59] that we not be judgmental but Lord you
[36:02] look on the heart all we can do is look
[36:05] on the outside and pray for one another
[36:07] Lord we commit this service to you I
[36:10] pray Lord that you'd help Lyle Johnson
[36:12] to just get out of the way we don't want
[36:15] to hear the musings of my mind or any of
[36:18] the rest of it we want to hear from you
[36:20] we've come expecting to hear from you
[36:22] we've come expecting your presence Lord
[36:26] we've come we've worshiped to bless your
[36:28] name and Lord we ask that you would now
[36:31] bless us with your presence and that you
[36:33] speak each heart we commit the remainder
[36:36] of this evening in this service and to
[36:38] your hands in Jesus precious name amen
[36:44] while we're standing this is a Bible
[36:47] study so please turn in your Bibles our
[36:50] introductory verses as you might guess
[36:52] are not from Acts 11.
[36:55] but we'll start in the book of
[36:57] beginnings
[36:58] Genesis 12.
[37:00] and verse 3.
[37:02] this is God speaking to Abram when he
[37:05] lived in Syria
[37:08] and he told Abram
[37:10] I will bless them that bless thee
[37:14] curse them that curseth they
[37:17] and in thee
[37:20] shall All Families
[37:23] of the Earth
[37:24] be blessed
[37:26] and then from acts 10 that we had our
[37:31] pastor brother Daniel lead us through
[37:33] last Wednesday night
[37:35] the first two verses to set context
[37:40] there was a certain man in caesarea
[37:43] after you've lived in Israel you call it
[37:45] caseria but we'll say caesarea
[37:48] called Cornelius the Centurion of the
[37:51] band called The Italian band a devout
[37:54] man
[37:55] one that feared God with all this house
[37:58] which gave much arms to the people and
[38:01] prayed to God always
[38:03] please be seated
[38:07] this was Acts 10
[38:10] . it's okay brother I
[38:12] I'm not worried about your uh your
[38:14] blessing on the cup
[38:19] it's about bringing the gospel to the
[38:22] Gentiles
[38:23] God was proceeding gently
[38:26] carefully
[38:28] step by step expanding the gospel
[38:31] Jerusalem Judea Samaria to the outermost
[38:34] ends of the Earth
[38:36] to the and Beyond the descendants of
[38:39] Israel
[38:40] we saw that the early jewish-based
[38:42] church included some Hellenistic Jews
[38:44] those that had been influenced by Greek
[38:47] culture spoke the Greek language and
[38:50] Acts 2 when the Holy Spirit came and
[38:53] filled the Believers Jews from all over
[38:55] the Mediterranean World heard the
[38:57] disciples praising God
[39:00] and their various languages
[39:02] in Acts chapter 6 we saw Nicholas
[39:06] becoming one of the seven deacons and
[39:08] and Luke was careful to point out
[39:10] that Nicholas
[39:12] was a proselyte he was a convert to
[39:15] Judaism from Antioch Antioch will play a
[39:19] role this evening
[39:21] a proselyte is a person that is
[39:23] converted to Judaism so Nicholas was a
[39:25] practitioner of Judaism though we may
[39:27] not have been ethnically a descendant of
[39:29] Abraham we don't know
[39:31] we can also infer from this that there
[39:33] was a large and active Jewish population
[39:35] in Antioch
[39:37] as the persecution arose the gospel
[39:40] message went to Samaria people of mixed
[39:43] Heritage but who were Believers in God
[39:45] followers of Moses teachings we read
[39:48] about this in Acts chapter 8.
[39:51] there we also encountered Philip sharing
[39:53] the gospel with an Ethiopian who had
[39:55] been in Jerusalem to worship
[39:57] and found him reading your school of
[39:59] Isaiah again a proselyte
[40:02] in Acts 10 we met Cornelius a Roman
[40:06] Centurion let's look again a little bit
[40:09] closer at verse 2 of Acts 10 says that
[40:12] he was devout man and one that feared
[40:15] God with all his house which gave much
[40:18] arms to the people and prayed to God
[40:20] always and we read that feared God and
[40:22] we think well he was devout guy and he
[40:24] and he believed in the god of Israel
[40:27] probably well we know we did but but but
[40:30] there's actually if we dig a Little
[40:33] Deeper we find there's more to it than
[40:35] just that
[40:37] it turns out that this appellation
[40:39] calling someone God fearing or one who
[40:42] fears God had a very specific meaning
[40:45] by the first century During the period
[40:48] of the second temple I'm going to read
[40:50] you a very short quote from Dr Isaiah
[40:52] Gaffney of the Hebrew University in
[40:54] Jerusalem who was an authority
[40:57] on second temple Judaism it's from a
[40:59] course he taught in 2008 titled
[41:01] beginnings of of Judea Judaism yes
[41:05] Jewish communities abroad also expanded
[41:08] by virtue of widespread conversion some
[41:11] Gentiles who came in contact with
[41:13] monotheistic teachings converted
[41:14] outright and these are referred to as
[41:17] proselytes
[41:19] others accepted the central tenets of
[41:21] monotheism abandoned Pagan idol worship
[41:24] and observed a limited number of Jewish
[41:26] Customs such as refraining for work on
[41:28] the Sabbath attending Jewish synagogues
[41:30] these semi-converts are referred to in
[41:34] ancient literature as God fearers
[41:37] so this has a very specific meaning in
[41:40] the book of Acts is certainly ancient
[41:41] literature and Cornelius is referred to
[41:44] as one who feared God
[41:48] so we see again
[41:49] that the spread of the Gospel is
[41:51] specific it's gradually erasing
[41:54] boundaries
[41:55] between Jew
[41:57] Cornelius was maybe we might think of as
[42:00] a special class of Gentile a God-fearing
[42:03] person that perhaps straddled the
[42:06] boundary a little bit between Judaism
[42:08] and and and and and and not Judaism but
[42:12] later we'll see the gospel spread to
[42:14] Gentiles that have no affiliation or
[42:16] even knowledge of Judaism
[42:18] regardless Cornelius was a gentile and a
[42:22] barrier was being demolished
[42:24] before we read in Acts 11 let me just
[42:27] give you a little more context
[42:33] what I'm wanting to show you here is
[42:35] where Simon the Tanner Seaside residence
[42:37] was the arrows are pointing there it's
[42:39] on the south of modern day Tel Aviv
[42:42] there's a a place there that is that is
[42:45] believed to be or is claimed to be Simon
[42:48] the Tanner's house Perhaps it is it's
[42:50] about eight miles from there to Lido
[42:53] with the Bible calls lighter nowadays
[42:55] it's called lud it's where Ben Gurion
[42:57] International Airport is is where I work
[42:59] for a few years
[43:01] about eight miles from from uh lighter
[43:04] to
[43:05] Joppa which is where Simon the Tanner's
[43:09] house was and where Peter happened to be
[43:13] the other town that played a big part in
[43:15] Acts 10 and plays a definite part
[43:17] tonight is what we call caesarea
[43:23] we learned that uh assessor that
[43:27] Cornelius was stationed by the Imperial
[43:29] Roman army at caesarea a Seaport City in
[43:32] the northern part of the District of
[43:34] Samaria
[43:36] this was a city that was built by Herod
[43:38] the Great to honor Caesar Augustus his
[43:41] uh the guy that sort of ensured that
[43:43] Herod was in power I just have a couple
[43:45] of arrows here to point something out to
[43:47] you this is an artist's rendition you
[43:48] can see here in in your upper left that
[43:51] there's an artificial Harbor that's
[43:52] built or there aren't any good natural
[43:54] Harbors on the coast of Israel so he
[43:56] built this Breakwater place here for the
[43:59] ships to come in and have a have a safe
[44:01] harbor and this was a very very uh
[44:04] Hellenistic very dramatic City Herod the
[44:07] Great didn't do things on a small scale
[44:10] um and you can see here this where this
[44:12] Arrow was pointing this little spit of
[44:15] land corresponds to this you can see the
[44:17] shadow in the water
[44:20] of that Breakwater that was built 2 000
[44:24] years ago
[44:25] this was a massive project and you can
[44:27] see down here in Amphitheater and here's
[44:29] the remains of a hippodrome or Racetrack
[44:31] and so forth this place of course needed
[44:34] fresh water so they built a series of
[44:36] aqueducts
[44:38] and and again this is to show Rome's
[44:41] might and so forth but there's a very
[44:44] important archaeological find that also
[44:47] came from caesarea some of you may be
[44:50] aware of this it's it's apparently a
[44:52] Cornerstone or something that has an
[44:54] inscription and it says here this is a
[44:56] Caesar Tiberius and this is Pontius
[44:59] Pilatus Pontius Pilate it's where we
[45:01] found archaeological evidence not just
[45:04] Joseph a statement or the Bible
[45:07] statement that pilate really was a
[45:09] governor really did exist in this place
[45:11] at this time
[45:14] I find it interesting that this stone is
[45:17] found in the location where new life
[45:18] that was brought through the death that
[45:21] pilate ordered
[45:22] to all that would believe the gospel
[45:24] message was found in caesarea
[45:27] where the gospel first came to the
[45:29] Gentiles
[45:31] lastly I just want to give you an idea
[45:33] how far it is from Joppa down here to
[45:35] caesarea here it's about 35 or 40 miles
[45:37] it's along the plane along the coast the
[45:40] plain of Sharon or the plain of Sharon
[45:42] where we get to Rose of Sharon
[45:45] so with that background understanding
[45:47] that it takes a couple of days to walk
[45:49] 35 or 40 miles at my age it might take
[45:52] more than a couple
[45:53] let's move into Acts chapter 11 and
[45:57] verse 1.
[45:59] we read and the apostles and Brethren
[46:02] that were in Judea heard that the
[46:05] Gentiles had also received the word of
[46:08] God
[46:09] what's their reaction
[46:11] it is wonderful news
[46:13] are they rejoicing are they saying go
[46:16] Peter
[46:18] well let's find out Peter comes to
[46:20] Jerusalem when Peter has come up to
[46:22] Jerusalem after staying some days with
[46:24] Cornelius which Cornelius had invited
[46:26] him to do
[46:27] we see that the news repeated from one
[46:30] person to another got there before Peter
[46:32] did
[46:34] and they that were of the circumcision
[46:35] in other words the Jewish Believers and
[46:37] all of them were Jewish Believers in
[46:41] Jerusalem at that time
[46:43] they welcomed him and shouted for Joy at
[46:46] the spreading of the Gospel
[46:48] uh that's not what it says brother Lyle
[46:50] no it says they contended
[46:53] they contended with him what is content
[46:56] the root of that is to separate
[46:58] thoroughly
[47:00] so this is not just a differing opinion
[47:02] but a matter that could lead to a split
[47:04] in the church
[47:06] a disassociation a breaking a fellowship
[47:10] it's very serious to these Believers so
[47:13] they contended with Peter and what was
[47:17] their bone of contention
[47:19] saying thou wentest into men
[47:22] uncircumcised you went into Gentiles and
[47:27] if this isn't enough you ate with them
[47:32] well is that what happened let's let's
[47:34] review again from from Acts 10.
[47:37] verse 27 and as he Peter talked with him
[47:41] Cornelius so Peter has come to
[47:43] accessories of Cornelius house he Peter
[47:46] went in to cornelia's house and found
[47:49] many that were come together so yeah he
[47:51] entered the house
[47:52] and Peter said unto them
[47:55] this is a curious thing he says you know
[47:58] how that it is an unlawful thing for a
[48:00] man that is a Jew to keep company or
[48:02] come into one of another Nation
[48:04] but God assured me I should not call any
[48:07] man calm and or unclean
[48:09] take that
[48:11] I'm sure this what do you guy you're in
[48:14] my house and you're insulting me
[48:16] there's nothing in the law of Moses or
[48:20] in General within Judaism that forbids a
[48:23] Jew from entering a gentile building a
[48:25] residence
[48:27] how else could the priest confer with
[48:29] Roman authorities
[48:30] how could Daniel live in a ballast in
[48:32] Babylon when he was taken captive
[48:34] or how could David hang out with the
[48:36] Philistines when he fled from King Saul
[48:39] there's there's nothing about that so
[48:41] but maybe a tradition or something of
[48:43] Jewish culture at in the first century
[48:45] the rabbinical sources suggest that
[48:48] there was no such rule but there was a
[48:50] price to pay
[48:51] because if you go into the Gentiles
[48:53] house you now become ceremonially
[48:55] unclean so you have to go through a
[48:58] ritual cleansing process reminds you a
[49:02] little bit about John the Baptist
[49:03] baptizing people in the Jordan River
[49:06] so you have to go through something to
[49:08] take away that impurity so there's
[49:10] nothing unlawful about going into the
[49:12] Gentiles house
[49:13] eating
[49:15] that's that's
[49:18] a Jewish dietary law and practice in
[49:20] general made it almost impossible for a
[49:23] Jewish person to eat Foods prepared by
[49:25] gentiles
[49:27] there was great sensitivity about this
[49:29] then and there still is today
[49:32] in fact it's an issue
[49:35] that caused Paul to publicly embarrass
[49:38] Peter a few years later Peter's visit to
[49:41] Antioch remember Antioch is going to
[49:44] play a big part in Acts 11. it's not
[49:47] recorded in acts when Peter visited
[49:49] Antioch but it probably occurred between
[49:51] what we call the first and second
[49:53] missionary journeys of Paul
[49:55] let's read briefly about this in
[49:57] Galatians 2. I know it's a lot of
[49:59] reading that we're doing tonight
[50:01] but it's a Bible study
[50:04] Galatians 2 but when Peter was come to
[50:07] Antioch
[50:08] I Paul withstood him
[50:12] it's the same phrase as Janice and
[50:13] jambers withstood Moses this is a
[50:16] confrontation
[50:18] it's not a quiet whisper in the corner
[50:20] is it brother come here a minute let me
[50:21] talk no
[50:22] I withstood him to the face
[50:26] got up close and personal Toe to Toe
[50:29] nose to nose
[50:30] why because Peter was to be blamed he
[50:33] was guilty well what was he guilty of he
[50:36] said because before that certain men
[50:39] came from James in other words Peter was
[50:41] up there in Antioch for a while and then
[50:43] some guys came up from Jerusalem
[50:46] the Jewish Church in Jerusalem up until
[50:49] that time Peter was eating with the
[50:50] Gentiles but when the Jewish Christians
[50:53] from James group came to Jerusalem that
[50:56] is when they arrived in Antioch Peter
[50:59] withdrew he separated himself from the
[51:01] Gentile Believers fearing them which
[51:04] were of the circumcision
[51:06] he knew they would strongly disapprove
[51:08] in spite of what we read in Acts 10 and
[51:10] we'll rehearse tonight
[51:12] and acts 11.
[51:15] and other Jews Jewish Believers of
[51:18] Antioch followed Peter's example look
[51:20] Peter is a bigger than life guy he's got
[51:23] quite a reputation in front of him this
[51:25] it's not Peter who Peter who no this is
[51:29] Peter yeah yeah
[51:32] so so he's influencing people
[51:35] influences brother Jordan mentioned this
[51:37] morning influence
[51:42] and withdrew okay they did and the other
[51:45] Jews dissembled which is the opposite of
[51:48] assembled they separated themselves they
[51:50] withdrew they were clannish the root of
[51:52] this word dissembled means acted with
[51:55] deceit
[51:58] or a feigned action insincere
[52:01] so they're separating themselves not
[52:02] because they believe they can't do this
[52:04] but but because they don't want to get a
[52:06] don't like on their Facebook page
[52:08] right it's all about men's approval
[52:12] and he says to the point that that in so
[52:15] much that Paul's talking here he says it
[52:17] and somebody said my good friend my
[52:20] fellow laborer and spreading the gospel
[52:23] went on missionary Journeys as they
[52:25] risked his life to bring the word
[52:27] Barnabas was also carried away with
[52:31] their deceitful Behavior
[52:33] when I saw that they walked not
[52:35] uprightly according to the truth of the
[52:37] Gospel
[52:38] I said to Peter
[52:40] before them all
[52:42] in front of everybody
[52:48] Peter if thou being a Jew live after the
[52:52] manner of Gentiles and not as do the
[52:54] Jews why compel us out the Gentiles to
[52:57] live as to the Jews
[53:00] Paul's calling out hypocrisy in this
[53:03] Behavior he's extending it not just to
[53:05] this clannish Behavior seeking approval
[53:07] but he extends it if you read further in
[53:10] Galatians to denying the very Christ
[53:12] that saves us
[53:14] he goes on to contrast justification by
[53:17] faith rather than by works of the law
[53:21] so this tradition this undercurrent of
[53:24] being separate was very strong it
[53:27] reminds me
[53:30] this is confronting myself to my face
[53:32] that when when I came into what we call
[53:35] the message I was among many that
[53:38] separated from our denominational
[53:40] friends thinking that somehow I was
[53:43] closer to God or a better Christian than
[53:45] they were
[53:46] I was a part of that
[53:48] I was guilty
[53:50] it reminds me also of the testimony
[53:52] brother Jonathan shared a couple of
[53:54] weeks ago from Brother Branham about
[53:55] going to that dunkard restaurant and
[53:57] being so condemning and judgmental of
[53:59] what he saw because what he saw was
[54:00] totally wrong
[54:01] until the Lord reminded him yeah
[54:05] and what did I save you from
[54:09] so there are lessons to be learned
[54:11] every day and almost every verse of the
[54:15] book of Acts well getting back to acts
[54:17] 11 I don't want to keep it past about 10
[54:19] o'clock tonight
[54:22] so verse 4
[54:24] but Peter in response to the contention
[54:27] and accusation of the Jewish Believers
[54:28] remember he's just come to Jerusalem and
[54:31] they said look you've been doing this
[54:32] this bad thing
[54:34] he rehearsed the matter from the
[54:36] beginning
[54:37] and expounded he explained it by order
[54:40] he said look here's what happened I
[54:42] don't know what you've heard
[54:44] you've only heard part of this let me
[54:46] tell you what happened
[54:49] I was in the city of Joppa praying
[54:53] and in a trance I saw a vision a certain
[54:56] vessel to send as it had been a great
[54:58] sheet let down from heaven by the Four
[55:00] Corners
[55:02] and it came it came down to me
[55:05] and upon which one I've looked when I
[55:08] fastened my eyes I considered and saw
[55:11] four footed Beasts of the earth wild
[55:14] beasts creeping things fouls of the air
[55:17] lizards snake spiders
[55:21] bugs pigs Hawks
[55:27] and I heard a voice saying unto me
[55:30] arise Peter slay
[55:34] and eat
[55:39] but I said not so Lord nothing common or
[55:43] unclean hath at any time entered into my
[55:45] mouth
[55:47] well this is a curious event
[55:50] Peter somehow recognizes the voices
[55:53] being that of the Lord but it seems he's
[55:57] being commanded to violate the word of
[56:01] God delivered by the prophet Moses
[56:04] to violate the way he's lived all of his
[56:07] life to violate the way that he lived
[56:09] when he walked with Jesus to violate the
[56:11] way that Jesus lived
[56:14] Peter was a Jew
[56:18] what's going on you can imagine what's
[56:21] going through through his mind there are
[56:23] several places where God makes it very
[56:25] clear that the Israelites Peter's group
[56:28] were to avoid certain foods we read it
[56:31] briefly in Leviticus 20 as they're
[56:34] getting ready to enter into the land God
[56:36] says you shall therefore keep all my
[56:38] statutes all and all my judgments and do
[56:42] them that the land whether I bring you
[56:44] to dwell therein spew you not out that
[56:47] sounds a little bit like laodicea
[56:51] so
[56:53] even after being conquered and banished
[56:56] the Israelite people are once again
[56:57] dwelling in their land even if it's
[56:59] under the rule of Rome
[57:02] you shall not walk in the manners of the
[57:04] nation which I cast out before you for
[57:07] they committed all these things that
[57:08] were listed earlier and therefore I
[57:11] abort them
[57:12] but I have said unto you you shall
[57:15] inherit their land I will give it to you
[57:17] to possess it a lamb that floweth with
[57:19] milk and honey I am the Lord your God
[57:22] which have separated you
[57:24] from other people
[57:26] and now here it comes
[57:28] the word of God direct from the pen of
[57:31] the Prophet who received it at Mount
[57:33] Sinai the prophet that even Jesus was
[57:35] compared to the Lord your God shall
[57:37] raise up a prophet like unto me this
[57:38] isn't a minor Prophet this isn't Nathan
[57:41] talking to David
[57:42] this is Moses
[57:45] ye shall therefore put difference
[57:46] between clean beasts and unclean and
[57:49] between unclean vowels and clean
[57:53] so this isn't just some tradition
[57:56] it also isn't something that needs a lot
[57:58] of interpretation
[58:02] you shall not make your souls abominable
[58:04] by Beast or by make your souls
[58:07] abominable
[58:08] by Beast or by fowl or any manner of
[58:11] living thing that creepeth on the ground
[58:13] Peter said you saw creeping things which
[58:16] I who
[58:18] the Lord himself have separated from you
[58:20] is unclean
[58:22] these creatures held in the Sheep by the
[58:25] Four Corners ye shall be holy unto me
[58:27] for I the Lord am Holy and have severed
[58:31] you from other people
[58:32] that you
[58:37] in Leviticus chapter 11 it details it
[58:41] gives you the list of what's clean and
[58:43] what's unclean how you can tell you can
[58:45] eat this you can't eat that very
[58:47] specific
[58:48] one of the things I find interesting in
[58:50] that list is is the Raven is unclean
[58:53] but God used the Raven to bring morsels
[58:56] of food to Elijah during the famine God
[58:59] used the unclean to serve the clean in
[59:01] that case first king 17 if you want to
[59:03] look it up getting back to acts 11 we
[59:06] have Peter seeing a vision
[59:08] and he's hearing a voice that's a
[59:10] apparently telling him to intentionally
[59:13] disobey the spoken and written word of
[59:16] God to the Jewish people
[59:19] let me repeat that he's being ordered by
[59:21] a voice and a vision to do something
[59:23] that's clearly forbidden
[59:28] question
[59:29] if you had such a vision
[59:31] being told to do something you recognize
[59:33] as being absolutely and clearly in
[59:35] violation of what you have been taught
[59:37] by and through a Vindicated prophet of
[59:40] God would you accept it as being from
[59:42] the Lord
[59:44] would you reject it like Martin did
[59:46] how would you know
[59:49] how would you feel if you were Peter in
[59:52] front of his group you're being
[59:53] challenged about this to relate what
[59:55] happened can't you hear that audience
[59:56] rising up and objecting at this point
[59:58] when Peter says in the voice commanded
[1:00:00] me to eat this thing
[1:00:02] I can see those people standing up and
[1:00:04] saying Peter that wasn't from God that's
[1:00:06] not scriptural you're going against the
[1:00:08] scripture brother you should not have
[1:00:09] done that that proves that you're wrong
[1:00:11] we can show you over here in Leviticus
[1:00:13] where you're violating the word
[1:00:16] God can't go against his own word
[1:00:19] so what's going on
[1:00:21] is this
[1:00:23] and if it's not and if it really is the
[1:00:25] Lord
[1:00:26] what sort of a test is this what's the
[1:00:29] Lord trying to communicate
[1:00:33] now God knew exactly how Peter would
[1:00:37] react
[1:00:39] which is why he presented it the way he
[1:00:41] did so that Peter would understand how
[1:00:45] to solve the riddle
[1:00:46] back to acts 11
[1:00:49] I said not so Lord no I've never eaten
[1:00:52] unclean stuff but the voice answered me
[1:00:55] again from Heaven what God hath cleansed
[1:00:58] that call not thou common
[1:01:02] profane polluted dirty Peter I can make
[1:01:06] the unclean clean think of the woman at
[1:01:09] the well a Samaritan think of Rahab
[1:01:12] get out of the box Peter
[1:01:14] I transcend the box it isn't about
[1:01:16] eating I'm saying that to get your
[1:01:18] attention Peter
[1:01:20] that's a metaphor I'm using
[1:01:22] it's about things that are clean and
[1:01:25] things that are dirty
[1:01:28] and this was done three times
[1:01:30] and all were drawn up again unto heaven
[1:01:34] and and acts 10 tells us it appears
[1:01:36] pondering this
[1:01:39] Lord
[1:01:40] what does this mean what what are you
[1:01:43] trying to say
[1:01:46] and by the way it's lunchtime and I'm
[1:01:48] hungry
[1:01:51] and behold Peter goes on
[1:01:54] behold he's telling his audience behold
[1:01:57] pay attention listen to me this is
[1:01:58] important
[1:01:59] immediately
[1:02:01] not eventually
[1:02:03] there were three men already come into
[1:02:06] the house of Simon the Tanner where I
[1:02:09] was sent from caesarea
[1:02:12] unto me
[1:02:14] caesarea that symbol of Roman oppression
[1:02:17] and occupation
[1:02:19] a symbol of Gentile power a place of
[1:02:22] pagan temples
[1:02:26] it's a it's it's and here's a person
[1:02:31] it will a portion rather of the Imperial
[1:02:33] Army is stationed there
[1:02:35] to remind everybody who's in charge
[1:02:40] and the spirit made me go with them
[1:02:43] nothing doubting
[1:02:47] even though
[1:02:48] one of these men was a Roman soldier
[1:02:52] I'm sure Peter's thinking boy am I in
[1:02:55] trouble again oops oops oops sorry Lord
[1:02:58] nothing doubting
[1:03:00] moreover these six Brethren Peter's
[1:03:03] again talking and he's got six guys with
[1:03:05] him
[1:03:06] these six Brethren from Joppa who have
[1:03:09] come with me to Jerusalem and are now
[1:03:10] here is witnesses to back up what I'm
[1:03:12] relating to you they accompanied me to
[1:03:15] caesarea and we all seven of us entered
[1:03:19] into the man's house the man who had
[1:03:21] sent the three to fetch me from Joppa
[1:03:26] and he that's Cornelius the man the the
[1:03:30] Roman captain of the Italian Brigade
[1:03:32] stationed in caesarea to remind
[1:03:34] everybody who's in charge
[1:03:37] showed us how he had seen an angel
[1:03:40] in a vision
[1:03:42] in his house
[1:03:44] which stood
[1:03:46] and said unto him
[1:03:49] send men to Joppa
[1:03:51] call for Simon who's known as Peter
[1:03:54] whose surname is Peter
[1:03:56] who shall tell the words whereby thou
[1:03:58] and all thy house
[1:04:00] shall be saved
[1:04:03] actually that's only part of what the
[1:04:07] angel told Cornelius
[1:04:09] let's go back to acts 10. I I I I I love
[1:04:12] this and I just want to share it with
[1:04:14] you acts 10 5.
[1:04:17] so this is the angel in the vision
[1:04:19] talking to Cornelius and says and now
[1:04:22] not later
[1:04:23] Cornelius make haste now
[1:04:26] send men to Joppa
[1:04:28] and call for send forth invite one Simon
[1:04:33] whose surname is Peter here's the
[1:04:36] additional detail he's lodging with one
[1:04:39] Simon a Tanner whose house is by the
[1:04:43] seaside
[1:04:44] and he shall tell thee what thou ought
[1:04:46] us to do
[1:04:47] can you imagine have you ever had the
[1:04:49] Lord speak to you like that I I've never
[1:04:51] had him speak directly to be like that
[1:04:53] here's here's here's there's like eight
[1:04:56] very precise things going on here
[1:04:58] Cornelius don't you go
[1:05:01] send men
[1:05:03] send them to Joppa 35 or 40 miles away
[1:05:07] that's going to take a couple of days to
[1:05:09] get there in a couple of days to get
[1:05:10] back
[1:05:12] look for a guy whose name is Simon but
[1:05:15] goes by Peter
[1:05:17] and he doesn't live there by the way
[1:05:19] he's visiting so you better not dilly
[1:05:22] dally or he might move on
[1:05:25] and he's not staying in an inn
[1:05:27] but with another guy who also happens to
[1:05:30] be named Simon
[1:05:32] this Heather Simon is a Tanner by trade
[1:05:37] but if you have read anything about how
[1:05:39] they process leather
[1:05:41] in that period of time you'd know that
[1:05:44] you're sending your men to a very smelly
[1:05:48] Place rich with odor it's really bad
[1:05:52] they I don't want to tell you what they
[1:05:54] use it it it it no
[1:05:58] fortunately
[1:05:59] this house is by the seaside so there's
[1:06:02] breezes that'll help a little bit
[1:06:04] without odor
[1:06:06] and and and Simon that's known as Peter
[1:06:09] will tell you what you need to do this
[1:06:11] is an answer to your prayer
[1:06:13] or prayers this has been going on for a
[1:06:15] long time we don't know exactly what
[1:06:17] cornelius's prayer was but we know that
[1:06:19] Simon Peter was going to bring him the
[1:06:21] answer to those birds God's not going to
[1:06:23] speak to him directly he's going to
[1:06:24] speak to him through somebody
[1:06:28] and and you're going to have to if
[1:06:30] Simon's going to tell you this and he's
[1:06:31] in Joppa you got to bring him he's got
[1:06:34] to be willing to come with you all the
[1:06:35] way back up to caesarea
[1:06:37] that's a lot of very specific conditions
[1:06:40] very specific instructions for the guys
[1:06:43] that you send they're going to go to
[1:06:45] Simon the Tanners but call for Simon
[1:06:47] Peter skipping down just a little bit
[1:06:49] here verse 17 in Acts 10. now while
[1:06:52] Peter doubted himself with this Vision
[1:06:53] which he had seen should mean behold the
[1:06:56] men which were sent from Cornelius had
[1:06:58] made inquiry for Simon's house that is
[1:07:01] Simon the Tanner excuse me can you tell
[1:07:03] me where where a Tanner named Simon
[1:07:06] lives oh you know oh yes sir oh oh you
[1:07:09] go go down the shore road yeah oh oh
[1:07:13] okay yeah oh
[1:07:15] oh oh okay you see you say I can't miss
[1:07:18] him I just once I get there I just
[1:07:19] follow my nose oh okay so they got there
[1:07:23] and stood before the gates and called
[1:07:26] and asked whether Simon not the Tanner
[1:07:29] the owner of the house they were told to
[1:07:31] call for Simon Peter so they asked
[1:07:33] whether Simon which was surname Peter
[1:07:35] was a guest was lodged there
[1:07:40] right the detail the specificity of it
[1:07:44] back to Acts 11.
[1:07:47] Peter says as soon as I began to speak
[1:07:53] now Peter's leaving out something I I
[1:07:56] think I think
[1:07:58] let's go back to acts 10 for just a
[1:08:01] moment as I began to speak it says then
[1:08:05] Peter opened his mouth and said of a
[1:08:09] truth I perceive that God's no respect
[1:08:12] to her persons in every nation he that
[1:08:15] feareth him and worketh righteousness is
[1:08:17] accepted with him
[1:08:18] Peter then goes on to share the gospel
[1:08:20] message but look at verse 34.
[1:08:23] Peter's addressing a small crowd in this
[1:08:25] house
[1:08:27] can any of you speak loud enough to
[1:08:29] address a crowd without opening your
[1:08:31] mouth
[1:08:32] [Music]
[1:08:33] no I have to open my mouth
[1:08:37] then why does Luke specifically tell us
[1:08:40] that Peter opened his mouth
[1:08:46] Cornelius had just finished relating to
[1:08:49] Peter this very detailed instruction
[1:08:53] that he received from the angel in the
[1:08:55] vision
[1:08:56] the reason why they were gathered and
[1:09:00] not only that they were gathered but
[1:09:01] with an attitude to fully accept
[1:09:04] whatever Peter said as being direct from
[1:09:09] the Throne of the almighty himself
[1:09:12] personally I think when Peter heard that
[1:09:15] and saw the attentiveness of these
[1:09:17] people that Peter opened his mouth
[1:09:22] his jaw dropped in amazement
[1:09:25] his first words expressed that surprise
[1:09:27] even shock of a truth
[1:09:30] it's true God is no respecter of person
[1:09:35] wow
[1:09:36] back to Acts 11. as I began to speak
[1:09:40] the Holy Ghost fell on them
[1:09:44] as on us as being the same way it did
[1:09:47] on us
[1:09:49] in the beginning
[1:09:51] well how did that happen in the
[1:09:54] beginning
[1:09:55] in Acts 2.
[1:09:58] I hope the binding's not wearing out
[1:10:00] under Bible flipping back and forth here
[1:10:02] Acts 2 verse 4 and they gathered in the
[1:10:06] upper room were all filled with the Holy
[1:10:09] Ghost
[1:10:10] and began to speak with other tongues in
[1:10:13] other languages as the spirit
[1:10:16] gave him utterance
[1:10:18] and they were dwelling of Jerusalem Jews
[1:10:21] devout men out of every nation under
[1:10:22] Heaven this is the Feast of Shavuot of
[1:10:25] Pentecost it's one of the three times
[1:10:27] that the Jewish people make a pilgrimage
[1:10:29] specifically to Jerusalem so there was a
[1:10:32] crowd there of devout Jews yes from all
[1:10:35] over
[1:10:36] the Eastern Mediterranean the Middle
[1:10:39] East that part of the world
[1:10:43] every nation under heaven
[1:10:45] now when this was noised abroad and that
[1:10:48] doesn't mean
[1:10:50] you know some Newsboy on the street
[1:10:52] corner saying extra extra over here is
[1:10:54] going on
[1:10:57] these guys are loud
[1:10:59] the sound coming out of that upper room
[1:11:00] is louder than the rushing Mighty Wind
[1:11:03] these people can hear it can you hear
[1:11:06] what's going on I've come let's find out
[1:11:08] they they heard that noise this was not
[1:11:10] a quiet Gathering and the multitude of
[1:11:12] pilgrims in the area
[1:11:16] came together and were confounded
[1:11:20] what because every man heard them speak
[1:11:23] in his own language and they were all
[1:11:27] amazed and marveled we could say they
[1:11:29] were astonished saying one to another
[1:11:31] behold are not all these which speak
[1:11:35] galileans they must have retained their
[1:11:37] distinctive accent
[1:11:39] and how here we every man in our own
[1:11:42] tongue wherein we were born and Luke
[1:11:44] goes on to list all sorts of locations
[1:11:46] and places and languages
[1:11:49] but what were they hearing
[1:11:51] in verse 11. we do hear them speak and
[1:11:55] our language is proclaiming this is loud
[1:11:57] the wonderful works of God
[1:12:02] well
[1:12:04] what was happening in Acts 10 then that
[1:12:07] Peter's referring to in Acts 11. acts 10
[1:12:10] 44. while Peter yet spake these words
[1:12:13] the Holy Ghost fell on all them which
[1:12:15] heard the word so exactly what do you
[1:12:17] just told these guys in Acts 11.
[1:12:20] right
[1:12:22] and now
[1:12:24] they of the circumcision which believed
[1:12:27] in other words these six guys that came
[1:12:29] from Joppa with Peter
[1:12:31] were astonished
[1:12:33] that sounds just like Acts 2
[1:12:36] just like the crowd near David's tomb in
[1:12:38] Acts 2 6. as many as came with Peter and
[1:12:41] why were they astonished because it on
[1:12:44] the Gentiles also was poured out the
[1:12:46] gift
[1:12:47] gift we we read in an earlier part of
[1:12:50] Acts where a guy was trying to buy this
[1:12:53] gift and Peter said no it's not for sale
[1:12:57] this is God God's Sovereign decision God
[1:13:00] chooses to give
[1:13:03] but like any gift
[1:13:05] you have to receive it
[1:13:07] you have you can accept it or you can
[1:13:09] reject it
[1:13:11] he's not forcing it that's the Free Will
[1:13:14] part of the transfer
[1:13:16] poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:13:18] which these Jewish Believers recognized
[1:13:22] how did they recognize it for they
[1:13:25] Peter's group heard them cornelius's
[1:13:28] group speak with tongues and what are
[1:13:32] they saying their words did magnify God
[1:13:36] they heard just like that original crowd
[1:13:39] and Acts 2 Peter had some people with
[1:13:42] him that spoke language different than
[1:13:44] the people in Cornelius as crowd spoke
[1:13:47] that was the speaking in tongues
[1:13:51] hearing the Praises of god let's get
[1:13:53] back
[1:13:54] to Peter's report in Acts 11 or I will
[1:13:57] have you here till 10 o'clock
[1:13:59] acts 11 16 then remembered I this is
[1:14:03] Peter speaking then I remembered the
[1:14:05] word of the Lord how that he Jesus said
[1:14:08] John indeed baptized with water but ye
[1:14:11] shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost
[1:14:14] and now I I suspect this is just me that
[1:14:18] Peter must have spread out his arms and
[1:14:20] Shrugged his shoulders
[1:14:22] and said just like he and John had said
[1:14:24] to the Sanhedrin they'd been called on
[1:14:26] the carpet some weeks or months before
[1:14:29] as much then as God gave them the gift
[1:14:31] we didn't give it God did
[1:14:35] as he did unto us who believed on the
[1:14:38] Lord Jesus Christ what was I that I
[1:14:41] could withstand God
[1:14:46] and how will these Jewish Believers
[1:14:48] these ones that started out contending
[1:14:51] with Peter Peter about this report of
[1:14:53] Peter hanging out with Gentiles and so
[1:14:55] forth how are they going to respond
[1:14:57] is there going to be that Schism are
[1:14:59] they going to say Peter your vision was
[1:15:00] all wet we don't care what happened
[1:15:02] afterwards you're off the word brother
[1:15:05] was there a Breaking of Fellowship
[1:15:08] when they who were contenting with Peter
[1:15:11] heard these things heard the testimony
[1:15:14] heard the full story not just the rumors
[1:15:16] not just the scuttlebutt
[1:15:18] to help their peace and that doesn't
[1:15:21] mean well they bit their tongue
[1:15:23] no no
[1:15:26] no they held their Shalom their literal
[1:15:29] peace that comes from God they were
[1:15:31] satisfied
[1:15:32] and not only that but they glorified God
[1:15:35] they weren't just biting their tongue
[1:15:37] they were happy
[1:15:39] saying then hath God also to the
[1:15:43] Gentiles granted repentance unto life
[1:15:48] maybe their jaws dropped too
[1:15:51] they're happy campers
[1:15:52] the gospel was spreading not only to
[1:15:55] Jews and Samaritans and proselytes but
[1:15:58] even further
[1:16:00] to the Gentiles
[1:16:02] when when I think of Cornelius or Peter
[1:16:04] ventrangatra Cornelius
[1:16:07] that was a big step
[1:16:09] I'm reminded of the words of Neil
[1:16:11] Armstrong
[1:16:13] it's one small step for a man
[1:16:15] a giant leap for mankind in this case
[1:16:18] for the church
[1:16:21] the Artesian well of the Gospel isn't
[1:16:24] just a bubbling spring
[1:16:25] it's a geyser Jesus said in John 4 14
[1:16:28] whosoever drinketh of the water that I
[1:16:30] shall give him shall never thirst but
[1:16:32] the water that I shall give him shall be
[1:16:34] in him a well of water springing up
[1:16:38] and to everlasting life
[1:16:40] well the stage is now set
[1:16:43] for the widespreading of the Gospel
[1:16:45] we'll see this begin when we get to Acts
[1:16:48] chapter 13.
[1:16:50] but now Luke wants to lay some more
[1:16:52] Foundation
[1:16:53] he steps back in time to tell of another
[1:16:55] thrust of evangelism let's continue on
[1:16:58] in Acts 11.
[1:17:00] what I'll call part two
[1:17:03] now they which were scattered abroad
[1:17:06] upon the persecution that arose about
[1:17:08] Stephen so we're all the way back now to
[1:17:11] that time when Philip went into Samaria
[1:17:14] and so forth
[1:17:16] traveled as far as Venus well that's not
[1:17:19] this town 100 miles to the north that
[1:17:21] we're glad we don't live in but it's
[1:17:23] phenicia it's it's modern day Lebanon
[1:17:26] and Cyprus
[1:17:28] and Antioch
[1:17:29] preaching the word of God to none but
[1:17:32] unto the Jews only
[1:17:34] it's time for a little more geography
[1:17:38] so
[1:17:40] this map is overlaid with modern modern
[1:17:44] countries if you if you can't read what
[1:17:47] it says that's a hint that you should
[1:17:49] sit closer to the front
[1:17:51] um
[1:17:52] so we have here Jerusalem Jaffa caesarea
[1:17:56] which we just read about now they say
[1:17:57] the gospel has gone to Cyprus this
[1:17:59] rather large island right here phenicia
[1:18:02] Lebanon and as far as Antioch which is
[1:18:05] right up here in kind of between Syria
[1:18:08] and turkey where the where the
[1:18:10] Mediterranean stops heading north and
[1:18:12] starts heading back West I just also
[1:18:14] wanted to point out that when it talks
[1:18:15] about people from Cyrene that cyrenia
[1:18:18] that's way over here that's North Africa
[1:18:19] modern day Libya it's quite some
[1:18:21] distance
[1:18:23] and there's Tarsus where Paul was
[1:18:26] originally from so you've you've got
[1:18:28] that in your mind now I'm sure that it's
[1:18:30] imprinted and memorized and whatever
[1:18:32] these towns are mentioned you're going
[1:18:33] to know exactly where they are in their
[1:18:35] relationship to each other
[1:18:38] here I've I've zoomed in just just a
[1:18:40] little bit to show you again Antioch
[1:18:44] and uh Tarsus were Paul's from and
[1:18:47] here's Cyprus and this little inset map
[1:18:49] gives you a better idea
[1:18:51] there's a coin up here where some guy's
[1:18:53] face on it we'll talk about that in just
[1:18:55] a moment because I want to give you not
[1:18:56] just some geography but some historical
[1:18:58] context
[1:19:00] so think about this
[1:19:02] in Acts 10
[1:19:04] the gospel first went to the Gentiles in
[1:19:06] caesarea a City built by Herod the Great
[1:19:09] and named honor Augustus Caesar a symbol
[1:19:12] of Gentile dominance of Roman oppression
[1:19:15] in Israel
[1:19:16] I don't know about you but it brings a
[1:19:18] smile to my face when I think about it
[1:19:20] caesarea is the location God chooses to
[1:19:24] First demonstrate the power of the
[1:19:25] Gospel to the proud gentiles
[1:19:28] well what about Antioch
[1:19:31] why would a city be named Antioch
[1:19:35] flashback
[1:19:37] Alexander the Great
[1:19:39] Macedonia conquered the Middle East and
[1:19:42] Beyond and then in 323 BC he died
[1:19:45] his Empire was carved up into four
[1:19:47] pieces in the eastern part of it was
[1:19:49] taken over and became what's known as
[1:19:51] the solicit Empire
[1:19:54] Antioch
[1:19:55] city was named after a guy named
[1:19:58] there's various ways that you can
[1:20:00] pronounce this we we probably think of
[1:20:02] it as Antiochus epiphanies I think it's
[1:20:05] actually Antiochus epiphanis but we'll
[1:20:08] call it Antiochus epiphanies
[1:20:10] he's an early powerful King of the
[1:20:12] seleucid empire
[1:20:14] it was a descendant of his
[1:20:16] Antiochus the fourth epiphanies the man
[1:20:20] whose image is on the coin
[1:20:22] he ruled from about 175 to 164 BC and
[1:20:27] he's the guy that tried to really Force
[1:20:29] hellenization down the throat of the
[1:20:31] people living in what we think of as
[1:20:34] Israel
[1:20:35] resulting in a pig being slaughtered on
[1:20:38] the altar in Jerusalem that triggered
[1:20:40] the maccabean revolt and Independence in
[1:20:44] some form or other for the Israelite
[1:20:46] Nation from about 140 BC
[1:20:49] until 63 BC when a guy named Herod took
[1:20:53] over under the stewardship of Rome
[1:20:56] so Antioch
[1:20:59] is a symbol of hellenization
[1:21:01] of forcing Greek culture along with its
[1:21:04] values philosophies and pagan gods
[1:21:07] so where does the gospel story in Acts
[1:21:09] go immediately after caesarea
[1:21:12] Antioch
[1:21:14] I think God has a wonderful if subtle
[1:21:17] sense of humor
[1:21:18] well reading on
[1:21:21] and some of them those scattered from
[1:21:24] Jerusalem were men of Cyprus that we
[1:21:26] just saw that Island on the map and
[1:21:28] cyrini which we saw as part of Libya
[1:21:31] which when they were come to Antioch
[1:21:34] spake unto the grecians these are the
[1:21:37] hellenized Jews verse 19 made it clear
[1:21:40] that they were only talking to Jewish
[1:21:42] people practitioners of Judaism they
[1:21:44] were preaching the Lord Jesus and we're
[1:21:46] told the hand of the Lord was with them
[1:21:49] a great number believed and turned unto
[1:21:52] the Lord
[1:21:54] after a great number that implies that
[1:21:55] there's a significant Jewish population
[1:21:58] in Antioch
[1:22:01] well when Tidings that just simply means
[1:22:04] news of these things
[1:22:06] of which things
[1:22:08] that the gospel was being widely
[1:22:10] accepted in these regions Cyprus and
[1:22:12] phenicia and especially Antioch
[1:22:15] came unto the ears of the church was in
[1:22:17] Jerusalem
[1:22:18] they the Church of Jerusalem sent forth
[1:22:22] Barnabas that he should go
[1:22:25] as far as Antioch
[1:22:28] remember this chapter opened with the
[1:22:31] church in Jerusalem asking Peter about
[1:22:33] what they'd heard
[1:22:34] well here they heard about these
[1:22:36] successes and spreading the gospel to
[1:22:38] the north they wanted to verify what
[1:22:39] they heard and they wanted to help
[1:22:42] so they didn't Google it they sent a
[1:22:45] trusted representative
[1:22:46] Barnabas
[1:22:48] who's Barnabas
[1:22:50] Barnabas is going to play a big part in
[1:22:52] things in a few chapters or for a few
[1:22:55] chapters recall from Acts 4. Barnabas
[1:22:58] was from the island of Cyprus that's one
[1:23:00] of the places where this gospel is being
[1:23:02] spread and what do we read
[1:23:05] and Joseph who by the apostles was
[1:23:08] surnamed Barnabas
[1:23:11] which is being interpreted the son of
[1:23:13] consolation
[1:23:14] a levite he's from the the Priestly the
[1:23:17] you know the tribe of Levi and of the
[1:23:20] country of Cyprus having land sold it
[1:23:23] and brought the money and laid it at the
[1:23:25] apostles feet
[1:23:26] and and there's something important
[1:23:29] about brought the money we'll we'll get
[1:23:31] to that in in just uh just a few moments
[1:23:34] here get back to Acts 11.
[1:23:37] who when he came that is when Barnabas
[1:23:39] came to Antioch
[1:23:41] and had seen the grace of God
[1:23:47] the acceptance of the Gospel the spread
[1:23:49] of the good news the infilling of the
[1:23:51] Holy Spirit
[1:23:52] was glad
[1:23:55] glad what they had heard about in
[1:23:56] Jerusalem was true
[1:23:58] and he exhorted he encouraged them all
[1:24:02] that with purpose of heart that means
[1:24:04] with an open heart an honest heart they
[1:24:06] would cleave they would endear they
[1:24:08] would remain steadfast unto the Lord
[1:24:12] for Barnabas was a good man
[1:24:16] full of the Holy Ghost
[1:24:18] full of faith
[1:24:20] and much people was added unto the Lord
[1:24:23] he wasn't disruptive he was encouraging
[1:24:26] helping
[1:24:28] putting his shoulder to the wheel
[1:24:32] then departed Barnabas to Tarsus
[1:24:36] for to seek Saul
[1:24:38] showing here
[1:24:40] Antioch
[1:24:42] Tarsus
[1:24:44] why would he be going to seek Saul
[1:24:48] we heard earlier that Saul was a
[1:24:50] powerful witness for the gospel
[1:24:52] powerful wind so he's going there to
[1:24:54] seek his help get him involved in the
[1:24:56] work in Antioch
[1:24:58] but why is he looking for him in Tarsus
[1:25:00] we know that's where he was born but why
[1:25:02] would he go to Tarsus
[1:25:04] well I'm sure you remember from acts 9
[1:25:07] but I'll give you a reminder
[1:25:10] acts 9 26 when Saul who had just escaped
[1:25:13] from Damascus was come to Jerusalem he
[1:25:16] is saved he tried he attempted to join
[1:25:18] himself to the disciples but they were
[1:25:19] all afraid of him
[1:25:21] believe not that he was a disciple
[1:25:24] but Barnabas took Saul and brought him
[1:25:28] to the apostles and declared unto them
[1:25:30] how Saul had seen the Lord in the way
[1:25:32] and that the Lord had spoken to Saul and
[1:25:33] how solid preached boldly at Damascus in
[1:25:36] the name of Jesus there's a connection
[1:25:38] with Barnabas and with Saul
[1:25:42] and he was with them coming in and going
[1:25:44] out at Jerusalem he spoke boldly in the
[1:25:47] name of the Lord Jesus disputed against
[1:25:48] the hellenized Jews but they weren't
[1:25:51] about to kill him
[1:25:53] which when the Brethren knew they
[1:25:55] brought Saul down to caesarea
[1:26:00] busy Port ships and sent him forth to
[1:26:04] Tarsus
[1:26:06] so Barnabas knows that Saul was sent to
[1:26:08] Tarsus so he's going to go to Tarsus to
[1:26:10] look for him
[1:26:11] back to Acts 11. and when Barnabas had
[1:26:15] found Saul
[1:26:16] he brought him to Antioch
[1:26:18] and it came to pass
[1:26:21] that a whole year they Saul and Barnabas
[1:26:25] assembled themselves with the church
[1:26:29] and taught much people
[1:26:31] and the disciples were called Christians
[1:26:33] first
[1:26:35] and Antioch
[1:26:37] there was a lot going on they stayed
[1:26:40] there for a year they were getting
[1:26:42] results
[1:26:45] and now we come to part three
[1:26:48] and in these days toward the end of that
[1:26:51] whole year came prophets from Jerusalem
[1:26:54] unto Antioch
[1:26:57] and there stood up one of them one of
[1:27:00] the prophets that came from Jerusalem
[1:27:02] named agabus
[1:27:04] and signified by the spirit that there
[1:27:07] should be a great dearth the root of the
[1:27:09] word dearth is from destitution applying
[1:27:12] hunger or famine
[1:27:14] throughout all the world
[1:27:16] which came to pass in the days of
[1:27:18] Claudius Caesar
[1:27:20] now it's not clear when this prophecy
[1:27:23] occurred the reference to the reign of
[1:27:25] cloudius May indicate the prophecy came
[1:27:27] during the reign of Antigua the previous
[1:27:29] Emperor or it may indicate the prophecy
[1:27:32] came to pass while Claudius was still on
[1:27:34] the throne we don't really know
[1:27:38] and then the disciples that is the
[1:27:41] Christians in Antioch
[1:27:43] every man according to his ability
[1:27:46] determined to send relief
[1:27:49] money a collection
[1:27:51] unto their brethren
[1:27:53] which dwalted judeo
[1:27:56] which also they did
[1:27:58] and sent it to the elders in Jerusalem
[1:28:00] by the hands of Barnabas and Saul
[1:28:04] well we recall from acts 4 that we just
[1:28:06] read that Barnabas sold land and put the
[1:28:07] proceeds of the work to the church he
[1:28:09] demonstrated that he could be trusted
[1:28:11] with the finances they didn't have to
[1:28:13] worry about him pilfering any of it if
[1:28:16] they took up a collection for Jerusalem
[1:28:17] take it down Barnabas is a guy you can
[1:28:20] trust with your money we're sending it
[1:28:21] with Barnabas
[1:28:23] and they're sending it with Saul
[1:28:26] now unlike the directions given to
[1:28:29] Cornelius or or Joseph's dream
[1:28:31] interpretation of the seven years of
[1:28:33] plenty followed by seven years of famine
[1:28:35] in Egypt the prophecy of agabus is vague
[1:28:39] a great dearth throughout all the world
[1:28:44] the word translated World here is not
[1:28:46] Cosmos as we might think but but it's a
[1:28:49] word that means land
[1:28:53] now there's a widespread interpretation
[1:28:55] of this prophecy
[1:28:57] that takes it to mean throughout the
[1:28:58] entire Roman Empire throughout the
[1:29:00] entire Mediterranean world
[1:29:03] and because there is no record of any
[1:29:06] such famine having occurred throughout
[1:29:08] the entire Roman world or the
[1:29:11] Mediterranean World during the reign of
[1:29:13] Claudius people say see you can't trust
[1:29:15] the Bible you can't trust acts it's just
[1:29:17] it's just myth it's just made up it's
[1:29:19] just whatever
[1:29:22] mm-hmm
[1:29:24] but there were certainly Regional
[1:29:27] famines Regional crop failures Regional
[1:29:30] problems but I think there's a clue here
[1:29:34] and that clue solves the riddle
[1:29:37] and I believe that that then shows the
[1:29:39] accuracy of both the prophecy and Luke's
[1:29:43] assertion that it in fact happened
[1:29:47] consider
[1:29:49] why did they send Aid
[1:29:52] to Judea
[1:29:54] why not to all the churches why not
[1:29:56] disciples until other places as well
[1:29:59] Why not start storing up supplies
[1:30:01] locally for their own use that's what
[1:30:04] Joseph did
[1:30:05] was it just because agabus came from
[1:30:08] Jerusalem and it was a convenient thing
[1:30:10] to do
[1:30:11] well any of you that have ever lived in
[1:30:14] Israel or been there for a significant
[1:30:16] amount of time
[1:30:18] you know that in Israel
[1:30:20] they re people will say that they'll
[1:30:23] call Israel instead of Israel they'll
[1:30:25] say audits
[1:30:27] it means the land
[1:30:31] it's it's Hebrew and it's taken to mean
[1:30:34] the land of Israel
[1:30:36] the Promised Land
[1:30:38] I think that the disciples in Antioch
[1:30:41] took agabus prophecy to mean this as
[1:30:44] opposed to the entire Roman Empire or
[1:30:46] wherever their concept might have been
[1:30:47] of the planet Earth
[1:30:50] thus there will be a Great Famine
[1:30:52] throughout all the land
[1:30:55] not all the world all the land to agabus
[1:30:58] and the Jewish Christians they'd
[1:31:00] understand this to mean Judea and the
[1:31:03] surrounding area hence send relief to
[1:31:05] Judea but we read the English version of
[1:31:08] it all the world and we think planet
[1:31:10] Earth we think the Mediterranean we
[1:31:13] think the Roman Empire
[1:31:15] not the context of these people people
[1:31:17] in this time
[1:31:18] and that famine did occur during the
[1:31:21] reign of Claudius and about 44 or 45 A.D
[1:31:26] well apart from the geography
[1:31:29] the reaction of the faithful to that
[1:31:31] prophecy shows concern and care
[1:31:33] for The Wider Church body
[1:31:38] some of you were probably thinking
[1:31:39] that's a nice history and context lesson
[1:31:42] brother Lyle but really what does it
[1:31:45] have to do with me in Tucson in 2023
[1:31:48] some
[1:31:50] 1980 years after these events
[1:31:55] the musicians would please return
[1:31:58] oh it's well before 10 30. first the
[1:32:01] attitude
[1:32:02] of those that confronted Peter
[1:32:06] they didn't hide
[1:32:08] they didn't talk behind his back when
[1:32:11] they had the opportunity they confronted
[1:32:13] him with what they had heard Peter is
[1:32:15] this true
[1:32:17] when presented with the evidence with
[1:32:20] the testimony with a story they were
[1:32:22] willing to be flexible they realized
[1:32:25] they'd only heard part of the story
[1:32:27] they withheld judgment
[1:32:30] and then they rejoiced rather than
[1:32:33] condemned
[1:32:34] when it was explained
[1:32:37] what should we do
[1:32:38] when we hear something about someone
[1:32:41] that bothers us raises the question
[1:32:46] another is Peter's attitude towards them
[1:32:49] patient explanation
[1:32:52] rather than rejection or dismissal he
[1:32:55] carefully related the events leading up
[1:32:57] to the problem you ate with gentiles
[1:33:00] he laid a foundation
[1:33:02] he gave the background he established
[1:33:04] the context
[1:33:06] he shared with respect these are his
[1:33:08] brothers these are his sisters they have
[1:33:10] a question
[1:33:12] let's
[1:33:14] discuss this let's not argue about it
[1:33:16] and when he was done he asked them
[1:33:20] how would they respond
[1:33:22] what can I do God poured out his holy
[1:33:25] spirit it wasn't me
[1:33:27] argument achieves nothing
[1:33:30] sharing and responding and a respectful
[1:33:33] non-confrontational manner should be our
[1:33:36] heart
[1:33:37] working together
[1:33:39] holding one another up before the Lord
[1:33:42] being flexible without sacrificing the
[1:33:45] basic tenets of our faith recognizing
[1:33:47] we're all in different places along our
[1:33:50] path to our final goal of being united
[1:33:53] with Christ forever as we sang that
[1:33:56] opening songs I came up here not putting
[1:33:59] God in a box
[1:34:00] or insisting that our perspective is the
[1:34:03] right one or the only valid one
[1:34:05] being sensitive to the spirit
[1:34:08] having compassion on others without
[1:34:10] being patronizing
[1:34:12] sharing the witness
[1:34:14] of Jesus Christ
[1:34:17] I wonder if we could sing as brother
[1:34:19] Aaron comes to close a service
[1:34:22] I want to live
[1:34:23] the way he wants me to live
[1:34:27] [Music]
[1:34:30] I want to
[1:34:32] live the way
[1:34:35] he wants me to live
[1:34:39] I want to give until there's just no
[1:34:46] more to give I want to love love till
[1:34:53] there's just no more
[1:34:57] I could never never out
[1:35:06] I want to live
[1:35:10] away
[1:35:11] [Music]
[1:35:15] I want to give until there's just no
[1:35:22] more to give I want to love love till
[1:35:29] there's just
[1:35:33] I never
[1:35:39] love us one more time
[1:35:41] I'm going to
[1:35:44] live in the way
[1:35:50] I'm going to
[1:35:52] give until there's just no more to him
[1:35:59] I'm going to
[1:36:01] love
[1:36:03] until then
[1:36:05] [Music]
[1:36:08] I could never
[1:36:12] [Music]
[1:36:14] I am
[1:36:19] answers
[1:36:21] amen
[1:36:23] sometimes if you're not careful you just
[1:36:25] look at it as history what happened
[1:36:29] but if you can bring it up to present
[1:36:32] life
[1:36:33] what I'm going through
[1:36:34] realize that God's mercy rewrote my life
[1:36:38] too
[1:36:39] not just a history but he's still the
[1:36:42] same yesterday
[1:36:43] sometimes he has to send somebody your
[1:36:46] way to get your attention I
[1:36:49] and say hey do you really believe it is
[1:36:52] it the truth is that and then you can
[1:36:55] just wanted to to share this with you
[1:36:59] with our brother you know I said
[1:37:02] be yourself
[1:37:04] that's the best way to be yourself
[1:37:06] because that's who you are so I asked
[1:37:10] him I said did you empty yourself did
[1:37:13] you leave everything here
[1:37:15] and he says they were quiet they were
[1:37:18] quiet but boy did they drain me
[1:37:22] took everything he said I left it here
[1:37:25] so I appreciate God
[1:37:28] sending our brother in a different way
[1:37:29] than maybe we might have fought or
[1:37:31] anticipated
[1:37:33] I shared his heart
[1:37:35] and
[1:37:36] we took them to lunch and I said I'm not
[1:37:39] going to take you to eat Mexican food
[1:37:41] because New Mexico Mexican food is far
[1:37:44] better than here
[1:37:46] so we went to eat we all sat down and
[1:37:50] I don't know why they picked on our
[1:37:51] brother but they didn't serve him
[1:37:54] we're reminded The Waitresses he hasn't
[1:37:57] got is what we were all done eating and
[1:37:59] they still had not served him
[1:38:01] finally brought his food he was the most
[1:38:04] patient
[1:38:05] understanding never complained
[1:38:09] he said it's coming it'll be all right
[1:38:11] I learned a lesson they that weighed
[1:38:14] upon the Lord shall receive their food
[1:38:16] [Music]
[1:38:18] it's been good to be in the house of the
[1:38:20] Lord today I believe the Lord has
[1:38:22] blessed us
[1:38:23] on Wednesday evening brother Daniel will
[1:38:25] still be out of town
[1:38:27] and he asked me to minister
[1:38:30] play a tape and he mentioned which tape
[1:38:32] it would be so we'll see how the Lord
[1:38:34] leads us I'm working on something
[1:38:36] sometimes the day goes real long on
[1:38:38] Wednesday the Lord knows what what we
[1:38:41] will do so if you'll stand
[1:38:44] I appreciate the fact
[1:38:46] and brother Danielle asked me if I would
[1:38:48] take one of the chapters of Acts and I
[1:38:50] said I can't do what you Brothers do
[1:38:52] that's just not me I would appreciate
[1:38:56] that they would do it how they see it
[1:38:58] and but it takes a lot of work
[1:39:02] study the time and I appreciate brother
[1:39:04] Lyle and brother Daniel doing this

[1:39:36] lord it's just not a just a gathering to
[1:39:39] be here Lord and see one another and
[1:39:41] just
[1:39:42] but to get drawn Closer to You Lord and
[1:39:45] in drawing Closer to You Lord and you
[1:39:47] drawing closer to us the very love of
[1:39:50] God then begins to flow through us to

[1:49:45] worship I always enjoy this brother's
[1:49:49] prayers I think they're the most sincere
[1:49:53] just come up and dismissed
[1:49:58] [Music]
[1:50:03] let's pray Lord Jesus we're thankful
[1:50:06] we're honored Lord to be able to gather
[1:50:08] together like we have Lord we
[1:50:10] [Music]
[1:50:12] Lord
[1:50:16] there was a lot of work that went into
[1:50:19] my brother Lyle
[1:50:21] prepared and delivered and and Lord it I
[1:50:24] was
[1:50:25] [Music]
[1:50:27] it's such a blessing to to read your
[1:50:31] scripture Lord and and the way the
[1:50:34] scriptures come alive like that and we
[1:50:37] get to take a peek into what things were
[1:50:40] like when
[1:50:42] the gospel was first poured out on on
[1:50:46] first Israel and then
[1:50:48] continue to spread like that Lord and we
[1:50:51] even see how
[1:50:53] they were just humans just
[1:50:56] with their faults and failures just like
[1:50:58] we have and we're reminded of some of
[1:51:01] the squabbles that we
[1:51:03] see and unfortunately partake in Lord
[1:51:09] you forgave them Lord
[1:51:11] forgive us for when we get caught up in
[1:51:15] things like that and
[1:51:18] maybe we get caught up in and we fail to
[1:51:22] draw the circle bigger like brother
[1:51:26] Branham always continue to tell us to do
[1:51:29] he had a way of
[1:51:32] putting his arm around a brother that
[1:51:34] maybe they didn't see things quite the
[1:51:37] same
[1:51:38] but I don't think that that matters so
[1:51:41] much to you Lord
[1:51:43] it's just the relationship that each one
[1:51:48] has with you
[1:51:53] Lord we're sure thankful for those
[1:51:57] around us and you can get it's tough to
[1:52:01] get warmed by a candle but what each
[1:52:04] person is bringing their little look of
[1:52:08] fire together we can sure get warmed
[1:52:10] around a bonfire Lord and we have you to
[1:52:13] thank for that
[1:52:15] think for
[1:52:17] all the things that were said and we
[1:52:20] want to tell you that we love you Lord
[1:52:22] and we just ask that you would pull us
[1:52:25] up real close to you lead us in
[1:52:27] goddesses only you can as we go about
[1:52:31] the this upcoming week we just ask that
[1:52:35] as we walk away with our little look of
[1:52:38] fire maybe it would allow someone else
[1:52:41] that's around us to see a little bit
[1:52:43] more clear maybe
[1:52:45] Shine the the gospel I in our own lives
[1:52:49] in our own little way Lord Jesus
[1:52:52] [Music]
[1:52:57] and we pray amen
[1:52:58] [Music]
[1:53:04] I know not why God's wondrous Grace to
[1:53:11] me
[1:53:13] [Music]
[1:53:18] [Applause]
[1:53:19] [Music]
[1:53:26] is called
