tell jesus jesus can help me i must tell jesus [Music] [Applause] [Music] must tell jesus [Music] if you'll just continue to play that quietly you may be seated it's kind of nice to have some music in the background when you're talking and getting prepared but just a few things that we need to bring to your attention i'd like to make brother eddie mcfadden welcome back stand up say graduated is that is that how you would say it from the national guard i thought i said you're straighter and you're taller i appreciate that he had desired in his heart to come back to being in arizona and the lord granted that so appreciate it god bless you brother eddie so good things to know that the lord is mindful of us so i appreciate that just to share testimony and then just some things to share with you um my daughter sarah last tuesday morning she was vomiting and that's the day she goes to dialysis and she had to report that to the dialysis center so that was a symptom of covid so they told her she couldn't come in to the to the place where she goes for dialysis and she would have to go to the the dallas center that's designated for covid so there was concern because now she's going into a place that people that have coveted so and she was asking the lord you know to help help her out and all and they gave her a test but they couldn't do a quick test it had to be three or four days out and they told her maybe she may have to go there for several weeks before she's allowed to return to where she normally gets her care so we were praying about and asking the lord to to to deal in that situation and of course she got nervous she got worried her blood pressure began to spike sarah's been off blood better blood pressure medication for two years now completely but her blood pressure got to extreme heights and all and you know as a family as her sisters mom and dad we we get worried we get troubled by it too so we prayed but yesterday after the memorial service we were talking here and i brought it to the brother's attention to remember her in prayer because she may have to go there for an extended time but the whole time my phone was buzzing and so after we're done talking i looked up and sarah said i just got my cova test back and i'm negative and i can return back so i appreciate and she goes and my blood pressure's going back down we get nervous we get worried and and it affects our body there's no question about it so thank the lord for him being mindful of us and i appreciate that it's it's um you know they're my children even though they're not little children they're still your children and you still love them you still care for them so but appreciate god being so good to us and heard the the thank you note from the fiatoa family and it's not something you want to have to do but there is something that you could say it's a privilege to be part of a family that knows the lord it's it's it's much easier to do something like that when you know that god's mercy is there that our brother has crossed into a place that we're all longing to go to and there's a joy in the midst of sorrow and they said thank you and much appreciated for those that came and were able to be here and and and and just uh support the family so i i said to sister grace i said you're not alone in this remember you have a family of god with you and take advantage of it brother jeremy prayed we're not in this alone let's put our shoulder the wheels let's work together so now next sunday at the end of service brother daniel andes has asked for an extension of for one month it didn't feel that for the time that he was here was enough for him to be satisfied with the decision one direction or another so he's asked if we would allow him to come for another month in the same the same way when he was here this past time so this sunday at the end of service coming sunday we will vote on that for those of you that are listening in on the phone hookup or stream if during the week you'd either call in or if you can could be here tonight or wednesday knowing you can't be here next sunday if you would put your vote with your name on it in the offering box therefore we know that it is one of the members of the church to be counted at the end of next sunday morning service and at that time we will give brother daniel the answer to that and then we can proceed further that says is that clear i don't think it's as clear as i can make it but if you have any questions ask ask myself brother jordan brother head brother arnie so that'll be a week from today so and we'll see how god wants to do that's what we want let god have his way you know because when we do it our way we get into a lot of trouble sometimes we just say lord how did i get here and he says well you wanted to go so i let you go but today we are coming in at service and thank you like i guess i could keep you here the whole time can i god bless you sorry sometimes it gets real quiet up here so um coming in this this this morning talking with my wife and she's such a blessed lady she gets to hear me all the time or maybe maybe it's the other way around pray for the pray for her just talking a little bit you know sharing things and i don't know how the other ministers but sometimes i get nervous sunday morning driving in thinking about and i just she happens to be the one sitting there she gets so she gets to hear it but just just talking about how sometimes we put ourselves into positions and then we say oh god how did i get here but you know he used that illustration of the prodigal son because he knows that there were times that we would get in that same situation but he didn't leave us there something in your heart and that was a call that that nature of god that that seed that said in my father's house there are slaves or servants that are doing better than me and he said i'm going back and the father didn't stand there and say well he's going to have to come up here and get on his knees and beg me for forgiveness and then we'll see and i'm going to put him on a 90-day trial the father looked out and saw and ran towards him and said that's my son welcome thou welcome back if you'll stand with me we love the lord with all our heart with all our mind with all our strength and sometimes we have to say lord i'm sorry i haven't paid as much attention to you as i should have but you know what he's mindful of us all the time so let's read the first scripture then we'll pray from hebrews chapter 12 verses 1 and 2. the word of god is true it's living it's a life and it produces amen wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin remember sin is unbelief and it it manifests itself in our actions that so doth easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us now here is how you should be running looking unto jesus the author and the finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of god amen let's bow our heads lord we we've read your word and your word is life lord and you you keep your word here they weren't just read and written on a book and recorded just because there was nothing else to do but lord they are life-giving they are life-changing lord they're there if we could say they're a safety net they're everything we have need of to keep us safe today but it's not just the words printed on the bible or words spoken it's the spirit of god that is mixed in with that it's faith that takes a hold of that and puts it into action today lord so we're asking you to speak to our hearts have your own way lord if there's something in our lives right now as we just examine ourselves and say lord forgive me let me set that aside and let me listen hear and worship you in the name of jesus christ we ask you amen you may be seated so we are so compassed about with many witnesses you know there's witnesses for both sides and sometimes if we're not careful who we get listening to what we pay attention to you know some people see something same thing you say and they get a different picture of it maybe they saw it from a slightly different angle or something that's why when there's a scene of an accident a crime or something they'll try they'll canvas the whole area and try to get all the witnesses to try to build a story that is accurate to try to try to determine because in in the scene of an accident and and we'll say both of them that were involved in the accident and nobody was seriously injured they get out both are waiting or wanting to to bring their point you know and and a lot of times the blame to the other every once in a while you're running a situation and the person will get out and say it was all my fault that doesn't happen too often you know i i it just the way things go and and but they want to establish what happened by looking at it from every angle what did brother roberts see you know what did sister shirley see what was that and you build a story around that and in this book there's ezekiel there's isaiah there's zachariah there's matthew each one expressing what god did with him but all of it is true not a point of view in here that is contrary to the other because it's the word of god but it takes the spirit of god in your life to make it to make it come to pass to put all the or there wouldn't be so many groups and so many churches so many denominations who use this same bible and come up with a different idea yeah but we're compassed about with many witnesses and they're telling us let us lay aside those things someone that has crossed the finish line can turn around and look back and encourage those that are still coming on and said it's worth it all and then looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith the beginning and the end it's him through the whole time it's not okay brother robert you're starting and i'll hang around here till you get to the end let's see what happens no i said i'll be with you even in you to the very end what a promise we have and as as i was looking in before brother daniel left on sunday he had spoke to brother peter and asked him to minister on wednesday night myself sunday morning and brother lyle for this evening so we we spoke about that and got made preparations to that and and when you know you're coming to stand behind the pulpit take a deep breath and you say okay lord what is it you have and sometimes god has been dealing with you sometimes you feel empty you feel dry you know but it's it's a training for each one of us he never leaves you um brother matthew had asked he goes is there a song special today and i said well i haven't heard any i said but let me go out there and see and i know there are those that have told me you can call on me so sister martha happened to be walking by me and i said sister martha do you have a song special and she said your daughters asked me to sing so and go after them no but they had asked for that song i can trust jesus how do you know you can trust him somebody tell me how do you know you can trust them somebody want to volunteer and answer brother peter be through the bible but because he's never failed you right he's what he's come now did he come as soon as you asked not necessarily there may be some training but he's never left you but so he's looking unto the author and the finisher of our faith he began it he'll finish it jesus and then he says by my example who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of god the same can be said of you one of these days and i believe it's soon and very soon well done thou good and faithful servant enter now brother branham says in the message my redeemer liveth i was thinking lord you know i just what what what would you have us speak and i was listening to the a portion of the service at of the youth convention they had over brother pruitt's and brother danny steeman was ministering and just a portion of a quote he read stuck in my mind so i looked it up so that kind of started the thought but it's hard sometimes to just keep it right there then yeah find something else and like how do you harness it all into one so i was studying and looking at some things and i told my wife i said my it started over there and now it's over here how how we get it but i i i read this quote this was on voice of god the the daily quote and i already knew where my heart was so i said now today just imagine that is present being here today if you'll begin to think on it and you'll begin to it'll draw them close you know if you come this morning thinking oh is he going to be here well he said he would why don't you take that and god you said you would therefore you will be you know he says being here today the lord jesus is in another world or another dimension right here today in form of spirit his spirit is blending in with our spirit our eyes can't see him he says because they are physical yet unless there was something happen that we could see vision he said but he is here just as visible just as real as he was the day that he spoke to mary at the grave or he met cleopas on his road to emmaus his presence is here he said where two or three are gathered in my name i will be there and god keeps his word so it can be filled with that felt with the inner charge that's on the inside of the human body called the new birth the soul has been magnetized unto him and once in a while once in a while he says when you let your mind be concentrated on him putting aside everything else and it sure is worth it isn't it when everything else can just be set aside and i know sometimes the the trouble of the day the things of the day we have to pay attention to him but he never leaves he doesn't say well while you're working i can't be there he says i'll be with you but there are some times it says you can just get your minds concentrated believing on him after a while something a reality you can feel something sweep over your being he goes that's the vindication of his resurrection so if you have that vindication of his resurrection which is in you then you know you've got a resurrection coming for yourself and you know sometimes there are dry spells sometimes there's hard times sometimes as i believe it was ezekiel looked over the valley of dry bones and god asked me can they live again and ezekiel did not say no way lord they're nothing but dry bones they're powdery they're dust he said you know lord get into a situation where not you can turn on say you know lord therefore i put it in your hands and and so we know that now the patmos vision and this is where the the quote the portion and uh when he started the thought from the patmos vision now you can't do any good until you first get in the spirit god can't use you he says all your efforts are in vain until you do it in the spirit first do it in the spirit if i will sing i will sing in the spirit if i'll pray said paul i'll pray in the spirit now we know when we come to church we're going to sing we're going to but what's the attitude in doing it when you can get into the right mode in the right spirit what a difference it makes i know for me it does sometimes you get here hurry sometimes you get here tired you're still carrying the thoughts of the day or and and some of it is it's natural you know uh driving down the road you just about get t-boned you don't say thank you lord i just about got t when praise god most of the time it's for the next five miles you're watching every intersection trade you know we were human he said but i will do it in the spirit and then if there is anything that comes to me that's any good it has to be revealed to me by the spirit and confirmed by the word or made manifest by the results it bears and that's a thought manifestation by the results that are being born what is showing what it is he says now like other words if i say jesus christ promised in his word that if we would that i would repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ i shall receive the gift of the holy ghost the first thing for me to do is repent it's revealed to me that that's true then be baptized in the name of jesus christ then the result is i'll receive the holy ghost boy that's simple but is it really that easy sometimes but it's the word of god brother brand name is telling here's the key getting into that spirit into that attitude he says if i am sick and he promised me if i would believe and have the elders of the church anoint me in oil and pray over me the prayer of faith shall save the sick lord i believe i follow your instructions let the elders pray over me anoint me with oil that settles it just go on it's all it's all over oh you say you don't feel any better though jesus wasn't born when god swayed him from before the foundation of the world when he was when he was a lamb of god slain before the foundation of the world but in god's own mind it was already done let this mind that was in christ be in you god said it therefore it's settled let the peace the anchor that holds you firm settled in your there you say brother brother and those are just words yeah but if you'll let the spirit of god he'll bring him to live in you now the next quote i believe it's um did i second part of the the second patmos vision i believe it was or the next part of that i wasn't there neither neither was you but in god's book if our names were ever there it was put on before the foundation of the world when god says anything it has to take place so when you meet god's qualifications just remember god will manifest himself and take care of the rest of it it's not your job to bring it to pass you just do what god said to do he says and you just go ahead it is a finished work oh isn't that wonderful oh my think just tell god and god said you do this and all do this well if i go do this he's got to do that that's not being arrogant that's taking god at his word lord you said so therefore i'm going to stand on that and then just a portion from uh x exposure exposition of the of the seven church age from the position patmos vision and just portion of the same quote but just another portion revelations 1 10 i was on the spirit on the lord's day and here and i heard behind me a great voice as of trumpet i was in the spirit isn't that just beautiful my i love that you could just call those words the whole of the christian life you know if we're going to live as christians we have to be in his spirit john was not talking about being in his own spirit that would not have brought these visions it had to be the spirit of god it had to be the spirit of god it has to be the spirit of god with us too or all our efforts are in vain you know and as he continues on there's a catching on into the spirit there there all right now was in the spirit on the lord's day now remember the first thing you have to do is what get in the spirit how these revelations are ever going to come to you get in the spirit have you ever have you ever gone going to how are you going to get the holy ghost get in the spirit get in the spirit now watch how he just describes some of this when you was a sinner and you went to a dance you got in that spirit oh my you started clapping your hands and patting your feet and shin digging and throwing your hat on the floor and going round and round and acting silly it was in the spirit of it could you imagine a fella was that a dance was a dance fan going to the dance say well and you all having a pretty good time i suppose oh they say you're a waff oh wallflower just get out of here you know i don't know i've never been to the dance i don't know how they go there but i think that's a pretty good description of it there he says oh they say he says go to the ballgame now i've been to some ball game so i know that one at the ball game and somebody knocks a home run or something another set look and say well i guess that's pretty good you know and i'll just tell you something here my dad used to take us to go watch the baseball games he liked to watch baseball never went to the dodger stadium or anything like that but we'd go watch the games and things and um but dad liked to leave about the sixth inning to get out ahead of traffic and beat the traffic out because my dad wasn't all that injury he just took us he wasn't screaming and yelling and jumping and shouting on things dad just took us to watch the ball game over here brother brown's talking about something he says no you wouldn't be a baseball fan you wouldn't be a real you wouldn't be in the spirit of baseball when somebody knocks a home run you raise up and holler whew my wind knocks somebody's head off his head like that nobody says a word about it everybody's happy about it hey man you know then in the church when you get in the spirit raise up and holler glory hallelujah praise the lord and somebody turn around and say oh you holy roller he says i'm going to ask you a question if we're holy rollers because we do that then them's unholy rollers out there i'd rather be a holy roller wouldn't you than an unholy one my certainly the unholy rulers now he was in the spirit he got in the spirit then things began to take place you know when i've gone to a baseball game i'm going because i want to see the baseball game or when i've gone to whatever it is that you're going out to do or participate in or one you know if you're go i ran cross country in my my highest one of my high school years and i ran to hopefully win but usually within the first 500 yards i knew i wasn't going to win they were already halfway down there and i was barely starting but i participated to the best of my effort and i cheered with the team and congratulated those that ran because we were part of the team and being part of the dream there comes an encouragement there comes a a backing uh you know if if if you're out there running the race and your whole team says you know we'll come back to particularly we're going to go have lunch you'd be you'd feel deserted but if your your team is following you you're you're you're leading they're they're calling out they're calling your name they're encouraging you to keep on getting in the spirit of what the lord is doing today you know not what he did yesterday that is a good thing to read and enjoy and learn from but you got to have your experience today it's getting in that spirit so so i would say because we're compassed about with so many witnesses let us run that race that is set before us and then philippians chapter 1 verse 6 he says being confident of this very thing that he which have begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of jesus christ he that began the good work so he began it he's going to finish it romans 8 11. and i know you've never heard any of these scriptures before they're all new to you but no it's the word of god he said but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you and brother branham says until you get into that spirit which is the spirit of god which he identifies the holy ghost in your life he said then these things can't begin to happen emotions yes excitement yes good feelings yes but a resurrection without the holy ghost no there's a big difference in the two the holy spirit brings that excitement it brings that joy it brings that worship and praise it brings all of that but then so do a lot of other things if i eat some good food i get pretty excited about it if i have a brother arnie was out here with some of that what is it kombucha water and he's talking about it there's some good things about it but that's not going to get me out of the grave there's only one thing that's going to get you out of the grave and that is the holy ghost the spirit of christ in you but those things that god allows us to do during while we're here on earth i thank him for that i thank him for the fellowship with friends and brothers and sisters and the different things that we get to do but i'm not going to be able to hook on to brother lyle's arm and say take me with you it's got to be in me also so he says if that same spirit that raised him from the dead it's going to react the same way now let's kind of look into where we were we're talking about being in this spirit revelations chapter 1 we'll read verses 1 and 2 and 9 and 10. the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him it's god unveiling himself when god begins to reveal himself to you he begins to unveil himself show who he is not just words in a book but the life the one that wrote it giving you what he meant the the emotion the feeling of it the the part of it you know you could take something and just read it plain you know and i'll try to do it that way it's kind of hard now i beseech you brethren by the lord jesus christ's sake and for the love of the spirit that you strive together with me in your prayers to god for me amen it's still the word of god but i sounded like a robot a bad one at that but a robot but if i could say with some experience now my brothers he says you know listen to this being confident of this prayer there's something about that becomes life in you and you want to share it you want to express it not just in the words but the very life we live so here he says the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified them by his angel unto his servant john god himself unveiling himself that's what he was doing who bear record of the word of god and of the testimony of jesus christ and of all the things he saw now you know john was in the isle of patmos but john didn't know that's why he was going to the isle of patmos john hadn't read the book yet because and been written you and i have gotten to read it we've gotten to know but john is going because he's being persecuted for the gospel of jesus christ and god allowed that to get john to the isle of patmos so that he could pen these words that you and i would have today so some of the things even as brother jeremy prayed some of the things that we go through in the hard times god is allowing those things for a reason now sometimes we bring them on ourselves you know if we too late at night we don't feel good if we go too long without drinking water we don't feel good and we learned that hey we've got to want take some precautions we've got to do those things but god is mindful of us anyways he'll get our attention you know i i go into the homeowners and do things like that and the first thing most of them do is offer me water can i give you some water especially in arizona you know especially in this time of the year so the things that god is the same way with us he reminds us he tells us he says son daughter you know you're running a little bit low there but i've got plenty to give you he says you know so so here we're looking at he says john is in there for a reason versus the next two verses there i was eight nine and ten i john i'm also your brother and companion and tribulation i'm not any more than you i'm not any less than you because i stand behind the pulpit because i play the piano because i do this i'm your brother in tribulation i'm your sister we're in this together john says and in the kingdom and the patience of jesus christ was in the aisle that is called patmos for the word of god and for the testimony of jesus christ and then he says this i was in the spirit on the lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet he had to be on the isle of patmos to get in the spirit on the lord's day and sometimes we have to say lord i need to get a place a quiet place away from all the commotion away from anything so i can get in to the spirit and concentrate on some things you have for me so if you go back and look into the things that brother branham says about being in the spirit on the lord's day in one place he called the lord's day sunday but he also called the lord say the day that god comes and visits you and is in your heart you were in that time in his now we we time we take him we put the word day and the bible use it too because we're creatures of time but when you get into what god is doing there is no time it's eternal god does is not bound by time nor limits god doesn't have to look at his watch and i got seven minutes for brother merle and that's all today no god says it's eternal i've got eternity with brother mural and he brings things to pass so john is saying i was in the spirit on the lord brother brahm says that but then he ties this and there were so many quotes i would have read 20 quotes to get to that where brother branham said the lord's getting in the lord's day is getting into the holy ghost getting into the spirit of christ being filled with the holy ghost being in that same that same frequency being in that same being tuned in the same station however you want to put it get it and sometimes we wonder why am i not getting a response why does it seem so hard let's look and see what where what maybe what day we're in if i could say it that way what's troubling me what's god what's got my mind he says now it made me think of something and the word was strive and and there's there's a definition of strive or should i say cinnamon synonyms cinnamon well not quite synonyms for strive to endeavor to labor even to strain or to struggle to sweat and toil to travail to tug to work to strive it's an effort involved it just doesn't happen i'm gonna sit on this rock rocking chair until the striped spirit strikes me no you're seeking you're looking you're anticipating you're working to get into that and i want to tithe as a striving to get into the spirit of god because if you go to genesis chapter one and we'll see how it started in the beginning genesis chapter one we'll read verses one to three and it says in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth simple a statement truth a lot happened in the very first scripture of the bible how much time i don't know could have been eternity not eternities it could be not eons and eons of time but in the beginning god created the heavens earth and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters so how did god first begin to move with his spirit he said and god said let there be light and there was light i appreciate the fact that when god says something it's what it is let me just let me just read something here that they found at the air god said let there be light and there was light god did not create darkness but the darkness was there because there was no light yet but he settled out there see the spirit of god was the first mover it began to work it began to brood and begin to he moved upon the face of waters as a hand gathereth her chicken under her wings and hovers over them to warm and cherish them as the eagle stirs up on her nest and flutter through young that was the same wording that was used in there for these it's god's moving over his children just like he said let there be light and if we go down and now we know we can go all that god began to create god began to bring to pass and we don't know the amount of time that happened and again we're working in time here when god said let there be light to when light first came but it did come you know when god speaks it happens but it has its appointed time you know for us it has an appointed time okay so we know for that through the next five chapters from one going into chapter six is the the the story of the creation the unveiling and even the the adam and eve coming the fall and everything going but watch what happens now here in chapter 6 and we'll go chapter 6 of genesis 1 and 1-3 also here we'll read those and it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the earth and daughters were born unto them that the sons of god saw the daughters of men that were fair that they were fair and they took upon them wives of all which they chose verse 3. and the lord said my spirit will not always strive with man for that he is also flesh yet his day shall be 120 years and that's where i tie the two my spirit shall not always strive with me there comes a time i believe when god says if you're not going to listen then i'm going to let you go you're going to go learn this on your own but he also tells us to strive press you know press into that kingdom of god work your way in not by works but in the sense of the flesh it is a struggle for us pray without ceasing sing songs as as we begin to sing alleluia and brother man just says acapella something about that song begins to work in you giving praise and the atmosphere changes but maybe it takes two or three times of singing it before you find anything there it is and then you can go from there to what a friend we have in jesus but you begin to create you begin to strive you begin to work because sometimes you come to service you've had to battle you've had to work through something maybe you were just about hearing a phone call and you got some bad news and now that so now you've got to set your heart and attitude so he said my spirit will not always strive with men i will not always tug on and pull on them strive with them you know yet he's god if you go back to genesis before this and he tells cain he says if you had done as your brother adam did you would be received he's a god of mercy he's a god of love but there's a time that i think he just says okay go learn on your own if you're not going to you're going to come it's just easier to come sometimes than to have to go through some of the things we put ourselves but again he says my spirit will not always strive with men for he is also flesh and his days shall be 120 years see this was not so in the beginning when he put adam and eve there in the garden of eden there was no striving there there was no flesh quote unquote there until the fall it it's i don't we can't really even imagine it to understand what it was like we can read about it we can hear about even brother branham talks about it when he's trying to explain after time he's trying to tell us in words what it was like and he says oh there's just not words to express that just don't miss it what is it the proof of the pudding is in the eating thereof you know it's good it's good it's good well find out is it good take a spoonful of it find out for yourself so galatians chapter 3 verses 2 to 3 here 2-3 this is paul speaking and paul tells us this only what i learned of you receive thee the spirits by the work of the law or by the hearing of faith are ye so foolish the word foolish do you really believe you can save yourself do you really believe you can earn your way to heaven do you really believe that there's a certain amount of good things you can do and therefore you earn that next medal the next award that next gold star he says are ye so foolish having begun in the spirit are you now made perfect in the flesh by the flesh paul says where did you begin what started this work in your life well it was my mother my father that prayed for me amen thank god for that but that was the work of the spirit that was god beginning to do what makes you think now you can work your way into heaven now do we throw out works no works is your appreciation back to god your love for him and in a sense you could say i owe it to him yes you owe him your all but this gift is freely given gift it's so hard sometimes i say something to receive a gift with grace because immediately you feel i owe back they were nice to me i got it and you should want to but a gift is given because someone desires to give the gift yeah but we feel obligated immediately this is the month of birthdays the next two months in our family there's five birthdays and it starts getting talked about at the beginning of the year oh no we've got the two expensive months coming up you know the gifts this mom's gonna mommy tells them what would you like to eat i'll make that and and the girls with each other it's just part of it rachel's was yesterday sarah's next week the following week is my wife's three weeks later is abby's and the week after that is naomi's so we'll work until we get enough to pay for it now um it's a part of that but then we begin as we do one we begin to plan the next one plan it's part of it but he said i give you freely nothing is owed back you can't earn this but you can show your appreciating your appreciation and your love back to you and show the work of grace that he's done in you by how you treat others by how you will live your life but how you react to the situations god you've been so good to me you've been so so merciful to me i didn't deserve any of this goodness i was worthy of hell but you saved me you loved me so therefore would you extend that mercy through me to somebody else and i would reach out and say come my brother come my sister come go with me to the house to this place because i love the lord but those aren't works those are appreciations of god's grace we have to be careful what works become in our life and here he says have you now been made perfect in the flesh we have to be careful with that finding the balance of that brother brown says you can never pray enough so that means if you prayed 24 hours a day you could never pray enough now watch he's just telling you to watch that spirit he's not telling you to stop praying in fact he says the scripture tells us pray always pray without ceasing but don't base your salvation on how much you pray because we would be lost because there are people that pray a whole lot more than i do they pray constantly but a attitude of our heart should be in god i have put my trust now so he says your works treating one another there are things that we should do already but we're not noting them we're not counting them there's not a tally book the only thing that brother branham saw when the book was open was the blood that said nothing is held against you nothing sister grace peterson nothing is held against you because the blood is there for you but on the bottom in parentheses but sister grace played the organ 4 528 hours when she was here so therefore she gets about no the blood that jesus shed thank god for that thank god for that take a moment to thank god for that right now say thank you lord jesus for your grace for the blood that was shed for me paul tells us have you come have you or is it the spirit of god that works in you timothy chapter 2 verses 4 and 5. now look here and we won't be too much longer here no man that worth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life brother eddie when you were going through training it was just like from eight to eleven then you had two hours on your own and then from one to four and then the rest it was your time right oh armies changed so brother matt they pretty well owned you didn't they kind of told you where to go and how many of you have served in the military here there's a few should i fortunate or unfortunate ones i don't know how you want to look at that but thank you but but but you give yourself to that when he signed the dotted line now he may not know everybody could have told him what it was going to be like but he had to go experience that himself now again no man that worth entangles himself with the affairs of this life that he may please him who have chosen him to be a soldier it's kind of funny that god chooses some to be a soldier doesn't he everyone has a part he says everyone who serves as a soldier keeps himself from becoming entangled in this world's business so that he may satisfy the officer who enlisted him now joshua says are you for us or are you against us took out his sword and says we've walked into a land that we're taking over but i don't know whose side you're on he says i'm the captain of the host he is the one who enlisted you the captain of the host i'll be with you even in you he said i'm the lord that keepeth thee that fighteth all your battles he says so no men and i just like the way this was said everyone who serves as a soldier every one of us keeps himself from becoming entangled in this world's business but it's hard sometimes the the the things that are going on around you the news that that you hear the the situation work or whatever it might be he says so that he may satisfy because who are we pleasing one another no him but in pleasing him we please one another we serve one another we love one another i think they taught you that i think no no if i heard right you were the only one there right the whole place was empty no there was people you were part of an army you were part of a group you ran together you marched together you did everything together you were there if your buddy fell you were there to help to pick him up you weren't you weren't supposed to kick him right shoot him he's no good no we're here together i didn't know you were going to be here i didn't even know these scriptures were there for you or for us i didn't know he had come yet but we don't entangle ourselves we don't get caught up i would go help you but i don't have time i'd go help you but i'm too busy in this i'm old no he said don't get entangled in those things and he said in verse 5 and if a man who strive again who pushes who pursues who endeavors who labors for masteries yet is not he not crowned except he strive lawfully i did a little bit of the looking at this as this was paul's writing we know paul was in rome we know all of that and and the um what do they call it the world games and all that that we do today come away from way back then those competitions and paul looked down and he said the one that's running in that race the one that's participating in the javelin throw the there are rules and there are things that they set they're supposed to do if you ever watch any of the competitions uh the hammer throw or whatever it might be uh the the sprints there's lanes that they run there's a starting time if they jump the gun they start it over i think if they do it twice they get disqualified there's rules and things that you set there because so he says and if a man strived for mastery yet is not crowned except he strived lawfully or in a simplex way to say if a man take part in a competition he does not get the crown if he has not kept the rules i remember i think it was a new york marathon and there was a girl that had supposedly won the race but she only ran the last 10 miles of the race she kind of slid in and started running but there was so many people who came up and said wait a minute we never saw her run by the first part of the race and they found out she had not kept the rules she was not the winner there are those that have run and i've seen it i ran cross country they had a marked course when you ran we would go run in a new a new another school and you never run before you kind of asked the other guys had run the air before how does this course run where does it go some of them were in a clear mark field you ran around the the the track others were through the streets and all over you didn't know where they go you had to know where to go you had you couldn't cut shorts you could you know well for one thing you could end up somewhere you didn't even know where you were at so you stayed you followed there was a course there was a run there was a track set before you there's a life to live there's a race to be run this is what paul's saying but run it lawfully run it through by what the word of god says to do pray without ceasing love one another do those things that are part of this race because we strive we've worked hard with him and he doesn't you don't hear well done thou good and faithful servant now you're not striving or trying to earn your points to get there because he's already made the way but you're striving because you're part of him you have a representation to pull the spirit of god running and doing those things by the spirit of the lord now this is a whole body minus a toe and i tell this now i will continue to say it one of these days i'm going to look down and i'm going to have my toe back and i'm going to know the resurrection is on we're about ready to go home because i'm going whole i'm going back i'll be restored into a body that's holding complete yeah i can laugh about it because i know it's true i had somebody tell me how could you laugh about this surgery you went through how could you have such an attitude and i said it was either that moan and cry and be in despair and i chose not to do that now i've shared this we were we were in were there with the doctor after the surgery and and and the doctor looked at it and i'm looking at the doctor's face and my wife has got her phone with the video camera up and she's got it right over where the toe is cut the opening first time we're going to see it after it happened but i can't see it because of the position of the foot so i'm watching the doctor's face is his eyes and his face going to show an alarm then guess what's going to happen to me when i see that the same result but my wife is just right down there videoing it and taking pictures of it and he kind of stands up a little bit he looks at the nurse and he says my this is kind of amazing i'm looking at his face there's some amazement in there and i take this breath there's nothing wrong and he looks at me goes this looks very good he said in fact he said i really thought you're going back into the hospital back into surgery and you're going to get more surgery done he said but we're going to wrap it up we're going to let you rest today and we'll come and look at it again tomorrow the next morning he does the same thing again he opens it up and this time he stands straight because i don't believe that you're healing already two days after so then he asked me he says what do you do for a living i said well you know i'm on my feet a lot i do this and this and this i said but but i'm also serving as an intern pastor of a church right now and his words were oh that's the reason you had people praying for you that simple he goes that's the only explanation i got for that that's how the family of god works god so we're sitting there and in you know just go tell you how it was we're now in in you know for the week we were in there and the kids were there my wife different people come to visit and all and some were more worried about nervous about it than i was you know and some of them were just like me who my wife says can't you ever be serious you know so there was a brother sitting there and we're talking and he says you know brother aaron and this will make you laugh but he says you know that when we have communion and foot washing everybody's going to want to wash yours right i won't say john yarbrough's name honest i said why and he goes because you're going to have less to wash there was another brother and his wife sitting on this side and they got this look on their face how dare you and then after they left brother john goes that wasn't offensive was that i said no but it was expected you and i know each other you know when you know who god is when you've met him in the spirit on the lord's day the fear is gone it is because you can say though god slay me yet i'll trust him he's proven himself over and over and over how many times have i failed him but he's never failed me brother branham talks about that time and here's a man that had gone through many a hard lessons lost his wife and lost his baby because he listened to the voice of his mother-in-law you would have thought this is god's servant the prophet of god god would have struck his mother-in-law dead no brother branham had to learn had to pay that way and each one of us too whatever we've gone through we look back in our lives and we say oh lord that i had never done that oh lord that i had never said that oh i wish it but it had its reason and its purpose even if all the reason is for you to be able to say don't go that way i've been there and that's a hard way to go but you can put your your shoulder your arm around come on brother come on sister we can do this but to see it cost him everything until he finally said lord i'll surrender myself to you i'll do what you want me to do. he listened to the men in africa and it cost him his health for such a long time again you would have think god would have struck those men for lying to the prophet but no god has a reason why he puts you what he puts you through you say well i i i thought i deserve better but god knows what he's doing now watch when brother branham goes into that little restaurant and he talks about seeing that woman and that man and the policeman and he gets such an attitude that he goes he walks on he said god destroy them how can you stand that brother brandon was really justifying himself before god i'm much better than them not in the words but that was his action so what does god have to do he takes him in a vision and begins to show him directly what he looked like without the blood he said you would be no different because he said every one of your sins are coming up and bouncing off of me by the blood oh thank you lord praise god for his mercy and his grace so again we are here we're saying we're striving to stay under and into the spirit of god what are you doing today why are you moving this way lord what is it about which way do you want me to go this flesh is going to rebel but put it under subjection say no lord i yield to you i surrender you paul sits there and he says i could argue with you if you want to talk about the flesh have you earned this in the flesh is it by your works he said if you want to compare let's compare notes let's show all our degrees let's see your diplomas i've got some of the best i was trained i was born i was this but i've counted of no value whatsoever that i may gain christ paul says i'll strive for that i'll run the race lawfully i'll go by the again paul said the same thing lord lord three times i talked to god about this if you would do this for me i know i could serve you better lord because i know better than you obviously really think about it that's what paul is telling lord i could do a much better job than i'm doing right now if you'll do this and the lord goes no you couldn't i have this for a reason and sometimes we do that lord if you would make it go this way and this way i know that i could get these results i just know that lord and he's looking at really and then he says go and then you're sitting there a couple days later how did i get here lord where were you in all this he said you wanted to go you said you could figure it out oh precious jesus hold my hand let me trust in you always as the musicians would come up lord let me stay in the spirit on the lord's day and this is the day that the lord hath made i will rejoice what is god doing today it's wonderful to read about what he's done tomorrow because we get encouraged by the testimony and the joy of that and we know what we're looking for but i'm living today lord i need you right now in my life be glorified let's stand in my life be glorified as power hands lord take these words i believe you gave them to me lord if for nobody else they were for me say lord but let us yield ourselves in certainly lord we will never be made perfect in the flesh nor in the thoughts of our mind or sometimes our mind can just go to places where we wonder how we got there sometimes we're affected by that which we see we can get hurt we can get moved we can we can see something maybe interpret it wrong or catch the meaning that we thought it wasn't it wasn't and then we're offended and we're hurt lord but i feel that if if we'll let the spirit of god have preeminence in our lives the mind of christ brother branham said he's the holy spirit the author and the finisher of our faith the one who wrote the book lord we can ask you what did you mean when you said this and you can interpret it and brother brahm says the prophet of god says you interpret it by bringing it to pass lord i don't understand how there can be peace in this situation how this boat is being tossed around but you said there's peace and he brings peace lord we send our into ourselves to you lord may we strive when we put an effort may we put a greater effort than we have to stay in that anointing of the mind of christ today lord we ask it in jesus christ's name amen be glorified [Music] in this church be glorified [Music] my [Music] glorified [Music] create in me a clean heart of god take all the things out
