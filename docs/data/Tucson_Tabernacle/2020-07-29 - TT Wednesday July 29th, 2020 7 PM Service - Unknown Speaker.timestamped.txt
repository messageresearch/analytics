[17:47] [Music]
[17:58] is
[18:00] god bless you all this is a testimony
[18:03] for his honor and glory um back in may
[18:07] um well i worked in the building where i
[18:10] live
[18:11] we have five teams that work there on
[18:13] the first team
[18:15] and back in may
[18:18] just before mother's day i um i went to
[18:21] the mail like on a friday before
[18:23] mother's day
[18:24] my sons were sending me bert mother's
[18:26] day card and
[18:28] um and i got one card for one of my son
[18:31] but then on saturday um
[18:35] i just i couldn't get in my mailbox i
[18:37] put the key in there but i couldn't get
[18:39] in my mailbox
[18:40] and um and so i i you know i thought it
[18:44] was strange
[18:45] i reported it to maintenance on the
[18:47] monkey i think either monday or tuesday
[18:50] um they took the lock out and discovered
[18:53] that there was a little twig
[18:55] in there that was um you know not making
[18:58] it possible for me to
[19:00] unlock my mailbox so they fixed it
[19:03] they had to change the lock and the key
[19:06] then um
[19:07] that happened in may and um probably on
[19:10] i would say on the 13th
[19:12] then on june the the month went
[19:15] through and then in june um
[19:19] on the third team again i discovered uh
[19:22] i couldn't open my mailbox on i checked
[19:26] it on a friday but on saturday i
[19:27] couldn't get in there again
[19:29] and um so i said it's the same thing
[19:32] that happened in may
[19:33] so um i brought it to management's
[19:36] attention i brought it to our
[19:38] maintenance and it took them almost a
[19:41] whole week before they could fix it but
[19:44] in the meantime um like i said this was
[19:47] on the 13th
[19:48] um the meantime i would go and check my
[19:50] mail
[19:52] and just to see if the maintenance had
[19:54] fixed it my mailbox it's on the first
[19:56] floor
[19:57] um and um and it had been fixed
[20:02] going back a little bit back in may um
[20:06] management uh changed our our ways of
[20:08] working
[20:09] there's people that work in the back dog
[20:11] and there's some that work up in the
[20:13] first floor where their mailbox are
[20:15] and we have to change back and forth we
[20:18] have to monitor the elevators and
[20:20] and um it's a long way but just to make
[20:24] it short we
[20:25] there's two teams that work uh every
[20:27] every shift
[20:29] anyway um so um they hadn't fixed it
[20:33] and one tuesday it's an ex-co worker
[20:37] that works at 13. and one tuesday i says
[20:40] i'm going to test him i'm going to see
[20:41] if this
[20:42] is a guy that's you know vandalizing my
[20:44] mailbox
[20:45] so um i you know all the time i can't
[20:48] get my mail out
[20:50] and so this one tuesday i was going down
[20:53] the building to come here to the church
[20:55] for the food program
[20:56] and i brought down an envelope an
[20:58] envelope that was sealed
[21:00] and nobody could see it nobody knew
[21:03] anything about except me
[21:05] and so i i brought it down i'm i went to
[21:08] the mail room
[21:09] and all the time this ex-stock monitors
[21:11] could watch you know he could see what
[21:13] i'm doing
[21:14] and i brought i pretended i stopped at
[21:17] the door of the entrance
[21:19] pretended like i had gotten some mail
[21:21] and i looked up the envelope and then i
[21:23] walked out with my car
[21:26] and then that was on a tuesday on a
[21:28] wednesday
[21:29] i just get discovered my mailbox uh
[21:33] vandalized again but this time there was
[21:35] a stick
[21:36] in there just shoved in there yeah i
[21:38] could see it
[21:39] but i couldn't take it out i brought it
[21:42] to management's attention i'm about to
[21:44] maintenance attention
[21:45] i had like about four people that could
[21:48] see that
[21:49] a little stick was jumped in there uh it
[21:52] took them i guess about a week
[21:54] um i think about a week for them to um
[21:58] to take it out by then i suspected
[22:01] that it was this ex-co-worker that was
[22:04] doing this
[22:05] and because he was the only one that
[22:07] knew that
[22:08] you know that was um i had that envelope
[22:11] that
[22:12] pretend like i had gotten male um
[22:15] anyway so that happened and usually it
[22:18] all month long it doesn't happen it
[22:19] doesn't happen on the first team the
[22:21] second team
[22:22] the fourth or fifth team it usually
[22:24] happens on the third team
[22:26] well uh in june when
[22:29] i worked just before the 13th
[22:33] i worked and it was the strangest thing
[22:36] i had never had anything like that
[22:38] happen
[22:38] this man that moved him recently brought
[22:41] me a bunch of mail
[22:43] i was working in the lobby and he
[22:44] brought me this mail
[22:46] and guess what it turned out to belong
[22:49] to that guy that
[22:50] i suspected was messed around with my
[22:52] mail and he brought me all this mail and
[22:54] he says i don't know what to do with
[22:56] this mail
[22:57] i recently moved into this apartment and
[22:59] i'm getting all this guy's mail
[23:02] and uh and they told me that he had
[23:04] passed away or
[23:05] or moved and for me just to get rid of
[23:08] it
[23:09] i looked up the mail and it turned out
[23:11] to be
[23:12] to that guy that guy's apartment all of
[23:15] a sudden all this mail is right in my
[23:17] hands
[23:18] and i could have told guys so anyway you
[23:20] know if you don't throw it away
[23:22] but i knew that that guy hadn't died i
[23:24] knew he had moved
[23:25] so anyway this male is there in my hands
[23:29] and it was like god was in control
[23:32] all this time i'm so stressful i was
[23:34] oppressed and all of a sudden all this
[23:37] mails my hands and i told that man
[23:39] no i know that man what you need to do
[23:42] is take it to the office
[23:44] and i called to the office and i told
[23:46] them
[23:47] and um and and and anyway i told him
[23:51] that
[23:51] you know about this he was taking this
[23:53] mail over there
[23:54] and then the woman called me back from
[23:56] the office and she says no he has to put
[23:59] it back in the mailbox
[24:00] and i go no but he continues to get this
[24:03] mail
[24:04] and so i you know it's i you know he
[24:07] continues getting this mail in his
[24:08] mailbox i really
[24:10] in fact i i don't even think he'd live
[24:12] in that apartment 1323 i think he gives
[24:14] him 13 22.
[24:16] he you know it was just coming to the
[24:18] wrong but before all that happened too
[24:20] i had run into uh i personally asked to
[24:23] talk to my boss
[24:25] management i told them that this has
[24:27] been happening now
[24:28] i can understand one time could be you
[24:31] know two times could be a coincidence
[24:32] but three times that my mailbox is
[24:34] getting vandalized
[24:36] that's gotta be i'm concerned now i'm
[24:38] convinced
[24:39] that this is not a coincidence and
[24:41] usually happens when this one
[24:43] worker is working and um
[24:46] they're in the lobby anyway so
[24:49] uh praise god now i worked on the uh
[24:53] the third team came on saturday i went
[24:56] to go check my mail like always i
[24:57] checked my medal every day
[24:59] even if there's nothing there but anyway
[25:01] and
[25:02] it was evangelized so that man
[25:06] received his mail which he knew i could
[25:08] have um
[25:09] i could have disposed of but this month
[25:11] my mailbox was not
[25:13] vandalized at all so i know that god was
[25:16] in control
[25:17] yeah and now i gotta find out who's
[25:18] vandalizing my car
[25:21] oh praise god
[25:31] i just don't know what to say
[25:35] so let's sing

[31:30] oh
[31:38] [Music]

[31:49] [Music]
[31:58] then

[32:12] is
[32:15] [Music]
[32:20] he took the form of many
[32:30] [Music]
[32:40] sacrifice
[32:51] [Music]
[32:54] oh
[32:55] [Music]
[33:08] all
[33:10] a great creature
[33:24] [Music]
[33:33] amen in him
[33:36] was every attribute a savior a healer
[33:41] a redeemer and he had
[33:45] some some way needed to to be expressed
[33:49] and you and i would have maybe thought
[33:51] it would be different or
[33:54] we would have done it differently but he
[33:55] knew exactly how to do it
[33:57] he said rather than send them i'll go
[33:59] myself
[34:00] and sure do appreciate that amen
[34:05] we have some requests to bring to your
[34:07] attention and a couple of announcements
[34:09] so
[34:16] brother brother gerald
[34:21] petty is asking um
[34:25] for wisdom to get all things technically
[34:28] worked out
[34:29] on the computer to get his his card card
[34:32] in it and
[34:32] pass the test on the computer
[34:36] and he can get his guard renewal in
[34:40] august
[34:42] because that's how he can keep his job
[34:43] if not he said then god would supply him
[34:46] with another job in a different field so
[34:48] he explained that to me the other night
[34:52] if the card expires he can no longer
[34:53] work with that but he
[34:55] it would say take several hours of
[34:57] renewal and he had to get access to a
[34:59] computer and
[35:01] so let's just remember that in prayer
[35:04] for for him there and then
[35:08] remembering brother peter and his family
[35:10] as they travel they were leaving this
[35:12] morning they would
[35:14] fly up to seattle i believe
[35:17] and then in the morning continue the
[35:18] flight up
[35:20] up into alaska and he said they'd be
[35:22] spending about a month over there
[35:25] so he would still be working remotely
[35:28] online
[35:29] but they would get chimed to travel in
[35:31] all in
[35:33] brother matthew watkins had sent me a
[35:36] text saying that brother daryl ward
[35:38] had tested positive for the coronavirus
[35:41] on monday
[35:42] but had a very mild fever and a little
[35:44] shortness of breath and no
[35:46] no major symptoms so ask that we would
[35:49] keep him
[35:50] um keep him in prayer i texted him a
[35:54] while ago see if there was an update or
[35:55] anything but that
[35:56] i didn't get a response so trusting that
[35:59] all is well
[36:01] and then i spoke with brother ed dougal
[36:03] and as he
[36:04] let us know he would be traveling and
[36:06] working up in bullhead city area
[36:08] spoke with him uh monday morning and
[36:12] temperatures there were running 119 to
[36:14] in the low 120s
[36:16] he said it was quite miserable and they
[36:18] were supposed to get hotter this week
[36:21] so let's remember brother ed and the
[36:23] crews that are out there working and
[36:25] not only them but all those that are
[36:27] physically working outside in
[36:29] a time like this so and then
[36:33] we got a text and i'll read it
[36:37] an update on sister angela boyd
[36:40] and let me uh
[36:43] this was sent from her sister sister
[36:46] angela yarbro and says
[36:48] she says i just or her sister christie
[36:51] said
[36:52] i just got off the phone with roy which
[36:54] is sister angela's husband
[36:56] he said they woke her up today she moved
[36:58] her toes and her fingers
[37:00] and she was answering their questions
[37:02] when they flipped her
[37:03] over she's oxygenating at
[37:07] 98 percent which is wonderful that means
[37:09] her body is taking the ventilator oxygen
[37:11] and it is breathing for her
[37:13] but they're believing that by the end of
[37:15] the week or monday she'll be
[37:16] they'll be able to start weaning her off
[37:18] of that oxygen
[37:21] and she is improving according to what
[37:22] the nurse said so
[37:25] we appreciate god hearing and answering
[37:27] prayers so
[37:29] he never fails and he does things at his
[37:33] time
[37:34] you know it's sometimes we would want it
[37:36] done right now
[37:38] but he has a reason as to why and we
[37:41] just have to accept that and believe
[37:43] lord you know what's best for me you
[37:45] know the situation so
[37:48] we have a praise here
[37:54] um maybe i should let you read it to
[37:58] brother lyle
[38:00] you want me to read it okay
[38:04] he says from proverbs 3
[38:07] trust in the lord with all thine heart
[38:09] and lean not unto thy known
[38:10] understanding
[38:11] and in all thy ways acknowledge him and
[38:13] he shall direct thy path
[38:16] it says when heather accepted my
[38:18] marriage proposal we were so poor that i
[38:20] had to borrow an engagement ring and
[38:22] return it after the ceremony
[38:25] you might counsel some young men that
[38:27] don't have some money there brother i'll
[38:30] i even had to borrow a suit for the
[38:31] wedding
[38:33] two years ago heather's mom passed away
[38:35] and she received her mother's engagement
[38:37] ring from the family
[38:39] it's a very special reminder to her of
[38:41] her parents and her love for each other
[38:44] so god took care of that part too amen
[38:49] we moved into a different house last
[38:51] december and all the confusion of the
[38:52] move the ring
[38:53] along with a how do you say that
[38:57] mezuzah we purchase in the jewish
[38:59] orthodox quarter of jerusalem 33 years
[39:02] ago
[39:03] and one other very special item they
[39:06] were misplaced
[39:07] many prayers and frantic searches
[39:09] occurred and by late february we just
[39:11] gave it all over to the lord and stopped
[39:13] looking
[39:15] today we were preparing some things to
[39:17] get ready for a road trip to washington
[39:19] to help
[39:19] our second oldest granddaughter
[39:21] celebrate her engagement
[39:23] while we were looking for a king heather
[39:25] noticed a tiny plastic bag pinned in a
[39:28] hard to see location
[39:29] on a cork notice board beneath the
[39:31] cabinet in the kitchen
[39:33] and she retrieved the bag and opened it
[39:35] and in it were all three items
[39:37] amen did you any hear any shout late
[39:40] this morning around tucson
[39:42] he says our god is mindful in the
[39:45] smallest things he just wants us to
[39:46] trust him so
[39:48] amen how many have a testimony that god
[39:50] is mindful
[39:52] god keeps god takes care i heard the
[39:56] testimony of brother ron
[39:58] spencer that brother pruitt gave the
[40:01] other day and
[40:02] also the testimony brother pruitt and
[40:05] proud giving on his wife again
[40:07] god being faithful god keeping his word

[40:16] there's a few needs things to to be
[40:18] remembered here so
[40:20] you know and you say brother and we
[40:22] always raise our hands
[40:23] that's okay sometimes you just have to
[40:26] remind yourself you're not reminding him
[40:28] you just have to remind yourself so
[40:30] let's bow our heads lord
[40:33] we thank you lord we appreciate that
[40:35] even
[40:36] even as you spoke to my heart a little
[40:38] bit ago how you
[40:40] you willingly came down and took our
[40:42] place lord
[40:44] there were those that actually witnessed
[40:47] that crucifixion that day
[40:49] all that happened at calvary
[40:53] and the the striping and the the
[40:55] bruising and the bleeding and the
[40:57] crying out for my god my god why is
[41:00] dolphers
[41:01] they didn't understand it many ran many
[41:04] left
[41:04] they were so disappointed thinking that
[41:07] you were their salvation but it didn't
[41:09] look that way
[41:11] but then brother matt had us saying oh
[41:13] how i love him how i adore him
[41:16] because to us it has been made now lord
[41:18] of what you've done for us
[41:20] how every need is supplied how

[41:43] takes care and keeps and watches over
[41:45] his children
[41:46] brother johnson giving testimony of over
[41:48] the years
[41:49] how he could testify that god is the
[41:51] same yesterday today and forever
[41:54] but you did it for one reason you gave
[41:57] your whole life you shed your innocent
[41:59] blood lord for us
[42:01] who could not redeem or save ourselves
[42:03] but you took our place and we accept it
[42:05] and we love you for it and we thank you
[42:07] for it in jesus christ's name
[42:10] amen amen you appreciate the grace of
[42:14] god
[42:14] and his mercy amen thank you sisters god
[42:18] bless you
[42:23] while you're standing
[42:28] let's take just one scripture
[42:32] the first scripture brother jeremy of
[42:34] the ones i sent you
[42:38] i believe now we'll start
[42:46] with psalms chapter 8
[42:50] and it's verses 1 through 9 but i'm just
[42:51] going to read verse 1 while we're
[42:53] standing
[42:56] and it says oh lord our lord how
[42:58] excellent is thy name in all the earth
[43:01] who has set thy glory above the heavens
[43:06] o lord our lord amen
[43:09] willingly submit to him your my lord
[43:13] how excellent is i name in all the earth
[43:15] who has set thy glory above the heavens
[43:18] amen you may be seated so
[43:22] this this afternoon as as i
[43:27] on monday and tuesday getting things
[43:28] together and and putting it together and
[43:30] then i opened up scripture of the day on
[43:32] my phone
[43:34] and scripture of the day was in psalms
[43:36] 119
[43:39] and uh so i began to read it and i said
[43:41] my how that ties into this
[43:43] and brother matt said he never got to
[43:46] his
[43:46] thought really on sunday because
[43:48] sometimes there's just
[43:50] my cup runeth over you know you would
[43:53] like to be able to get it all out and
[43:56] and he did mention that sunday morning
[43:58] he would be streaming
[44:00] service here and we'd be having one
[44:02] service
[44:03] we got a text from my daughter nina this
[44:05] afternoon that
[44:07] kansas had has lifted the the um
[44:10] quarantine from those folks coming to
[44:13] kansas or the ones that have gone
[44:15] from kansas back so she says i can come
[44:17] and travel again
[44:18] she was supposed to have come a couple
[44:20] weeks ago and couldn't do that so
[44:22] god has it all under control you know we
[44:25] myself brother arne speaking of
[44:27] things that are going on in politics and
[44:29] we realize god sets
[44:31] god takes down you know each
[44:34] king each prophet each man that god used
[44:38] they couldn't tell you why we have the
[44:40] advantage to know by reading
[44:43] and see the end results but while they
[44:45] were going going through
[44:46] they couldn't always understand it but
[44:49] god
[44:50] has it in place here he has your life in
[44:52] order
[44:53] he has the things you're going through
[44:54] you say boy i made a mess out of it
[44:56] he was aware of it he wasn't like oh no
[45:00] man what did he do you know that's not
[45:03] him he says i've got
[45:05] as he gave that story of the prodigal
[45:07] son
[45:08] and the other son at home you know the
[45:11] son asked for his inheritance and he got
[45:13] it and he went and he wasted it
[45:16] you know and and he's looking down he
[45:19] said the same way i've given you an
[45:20] inheritance i've passed about he goes
[45:22] many have wasted it many have ruined
[45:25] their testimony
[45:26] but god gets the glory in it you know
[45:29] and and so
[45:30] we we got to understand that and so i
[45:33] was looking at this and i read it and i
[45:35] said oh my this
[45:36] this can be a whole sermon in itself so
[45:38] it's going to start that way and then
[45:40] we'll see where we go
[45:42] but taking a portion first off of
[45:47] um daily strength
[45:51] the prophet job said let us choose for
[45:53] ourselves what is right
[45:55] let us know among ourselves what is good
[45:58] that's something that job said
[46:01] we know what is right and what is good
[46:03] because we have the word of god
[46:04] and we have the voice of god ring it out
[46:06] through his spirit
[46:08] god has never left us with the way we
[46:10] can't know
[46:12] you know if if it was up to every man's
[46:15] individual idea
[46:17] the scripture does tell every man did
[46:19] what they thought was right in their own
[46:20] eyes
[46:22] you know but god has his word
[46:26] but even more and above that he has
[46:30] his spirit dwelling in you to interpret
[46:32] the word to you
[46:34] because we'd all do it differently we
[46:37] would all have different ideas so he
[46:39] says
[46:40] we have the word of god and we have the
[46:42] voice of god ringing out to us through
[46:44] his spirit
[46:46] there are consequences to choose god's
[46:49] path
[46:50] something hard and painful sometimes
[46:54] we'd love for it to just be a a path an
[46:58] easy path
[46:59] slightly downhill all the time easier to
[47:03] go
[47:04] but you know when you want to get to
[47:05] certain places to see some of the beauty
[47:07] there is a hard path to get there a hard
[47:09] climb to get there
[47:11] maybe several hours or several days or
[47:13] in the case to get to one of some of the
[47:14] tallest mountains it takes years of
[47:16] planning
[47:17] i was sitting in an office doing some
[47:19] paperwork and there was a picture on the
[47:21] hanging up behind the lady that was the
[47:23] office and
[47:24] it looked like a huge ocean wave and i
[47:27] said where's that picture from and she
[47:29] goes that's the colorado river
[47:31] i'm looking she goes and our raft is in
[47:33] the middle of that wave
[47:36] and all i saw was a huge wave but she
[47:39] lived through it so she knew it was
[47:40] there
[47:40] you know and she said it took
[47:44] many years or many uh other rivers
[47:47] rafted white water rafting before you
[47:50] were qualified to go down the
[47:52] colorado river and she explained it
[47:55] you know and so the many things you've
[47:57] gone through the many trials you've gone
[47:59] through have their purpose and they have
[48:00] their reason
[48:03] if we could look back down the pathway
[48:04] of our life i would say i would change
[48:06] this i would do this differently
[48:08] sometimes we ask
[48:09] each other me and my wife he said if you
[48:10] could do it over again what would you
[48:12] different do differently and
[48:14] we would look at some things maybe i
[48:16] would have been more careful here
[48:17] maybe i would have saved a little more
[48:19] money maybe you know the things we would
[48:21] have
[48:22] as you're looking back on it because
[48:24] they say hindsight is 20 20.
[48:26] you know but god had it ordained god had
[48:29] it planned
[48:30] and so here it is job says he says when
[48:33] he's
[48:34] speaking that we choose that but some
[48:35] are painful
[48:38] but it leads to joy and peace it leads
[48:41] to
[48:42] an expected end like jeremiah 29 11 says
[48:46] we have an expected end when we choose
[48:49] his way
[48:49] and we and we choose to do what is right
[48:52] and what is good choose right
[48:54] no matter the consequences because then
[48:57] we have that expected end
[49:00] there is a reward if i could put it that
[49:02] day there is uh something to achieve
[49:04] there is something to
[49:05] to to get to if you choose a way
[49:08] sometimes we take shortcuts
[49:11] i was walking with the girls up through
[49:13] pima canyon when they were young and it
[49:15] was water running down after
[49:17] end of winter into early spring and i
[49:20] chose
[49:20] i said you girls go around the pathway
[49:22] i'm going to go this way
[49:25] and i'll meet you on the other side so i
[49:27] thought i had gone far enough
[49:29] to meet them on the other side and there
[49:30] was naomi and elizabeth maybe sarah
[49:34] and so i'm standing there wondering
[49:36] where they're at and not paying
[49:37] attention next to them standing next to
[49:39] sorrow i just decided to lean on it
[49:42] and i found out real quick you don't
[49:44] lean on saguaros because they're pretty
[49:45] sticky
[49:46] you know if i stayed on the path
[49:50] it would have been a different result i
[49:52] pray god i learned a lesson i haven't
[49:54] tried it again
[49:56] but there is an expected end and then
[49:58] brother branham says now when you
[50:00] you can't bluff it you've got to have it
[50:03] you can't bluff it satan knows when
[50:05] you're bluffing
[50:07] he also knows when you've got it
[50:10] okay your heart condemns you
[50:14] not and you're you're a christian you
[50:16] have a right to
[50:17] every promise that god made in his book
[50:20] it's yours no matter what the
[50:21] consequence
[50:22] is and what the outcome you don't look
[50:26] to that you look to
[50:27] at the faith that god gave you
[50:31] that god gave you to the promise you
[50:33] take and apply it god said so
[50:35] there it stands and nothing will move it
[50:38] that's where you stand that's where you
[50:41] hold lord i can't see the end of this
[50:43] i don't see what's past the turn on the
[50:45] road but you told me to go so therefore
[50:47] i will go and i'll walk that way abraham
[50:51] leave all that you have and go begin to
[50:54] walk i'm going to take you to a land
[50:56] that's all going to
[50:56] be yours but he didn't tell abraham
[50:58] every step of the way
[51:00] he just said go abraham began to walk
[51:03] begin to travel
[51:04] the same as you and i have and still do
[51:08] now david says you know i'm going to tie
[51:10] this into psalms 119
[51:13] where we read you know we
[51:17] we read out of out of psalms
[51:20] that script but i want to just get in
[51:21] psalms 119 and start here first psalms 1
[51:24] and 19 we'll read it
[51:25] from verse 89 to verse 96
[51:29] and and just speak a little bit here
[51:32] forever o lord
[51:33] thy word is settled in heaven
[51:37] there's no this way about it there's no
[51:40] that way about it there's nothing that
[51:41] rocks it shakes it moves it
[51:44] they don't settle it's settled it's firm
[51:46] it's eternal he
[51:49] sometimes i wonder how much david
[51:51] understood what he was writing or saying
[51:54] how much of it was under inspiration and
[51:57] how much of a david had learned by
[51:59] experience because there are things that
[52:00] we've read and heard but one day all
[52:02] said
[52:02] the revelation of it comes to your heart
[52:04] because now you've experienced it
[52:07] i'm the lord thy god that healeth all
[52:09] thy diseases
[52:10] and you say amen because you has healed
[52:13] mine
[52:13] he's done this for me it's not just
[52:16] words spoken anymore but something that
[52:18] goes with it
[52:19] thy faithfulness is unto all generations
[52:23] so i'm included with that it wasn't just
[52:26] to that first generation
[52:28] it still continues he says
[52:31] thou has established the earth and it
[52:33] abideth
[52:36] here david could see what he has seen
[52:38] with
[52:40] could i say this with a limited view
[52:43] they couldn't get up into the heavens
[52:44] and look down they couldn't
[52:47] go around the earth in a in a spaceship
[52:50] and take pictures of it
[52:53] they didn't have those things but he
[52:55] what he could see understood what you
[52:57] said still abides and you're faithful
[52:59] with it
[53:00] it says they continue this day according
[53:03] to thine
[53:03] ordinances for all
[53:07] are thy servants they're under his
[53:09] command
[53:11] they're under his keeping they're under
[53:13] his protection
[53:14] and i'm on there too but i have to
[53:17] willingly place myself in there
[53:19] i have to say i surrender i have to
[53:21] yield
[53:22] i have to realize lord i don't
[53:24] understand it but i trust you
[53:26] i've had enough experiences with you
[53:28] when i didn't understand
[53:29] and you told me to go and i went it
[53:31] worked out exactly like you said it
[53:33] should work out
[53:34] and i've learned that he says and he
[53:37] says
[53:39] the heavens and and the earth the
[53:41] ordinances as thou has appointed
[53:43] for all things are subject to thy power
[53:46] and to thy pleasure
[53:49] it's another way to look at that
[53:50] scripture what you desired
[53:52] for your own pleasure because he could
[53:56] he's the only one that can want
[53:58] something to do something and be
[53:59] totally right with the right attitude
[54:01] spirit to have it
[54:02] because we've got to be careful would
[54:04] check our motives and our spirits first
[54:06] for things we do sometimes i want this
[54:08] this and this and then god says
[54:10] why but he could do it because there is
[54:14] no wrong motive in him
[54:18] and then david says this in in verse 92
[54:21] unless thy law
[54:22] had been my delights
[54:25] when something delights you when
[54:27] something attracts you when something
[54:28] you love
[54:29] you'll pay attention to it you'll give a
[54:31] lot to it
[54:32] if not your all you'll spend a lot you
[54:34] know there are some things that we like
[54:36] to do and some things we don't like to
[54:37] do and the things
[54:38] we like don't like to do we we we spend
[54:40] the least amount of time doing it
[54:42] now i'm not talking about work now we
[54:44] got to do that
[54:45] but there's just things that you know
[54:47] they have to be done
[54:50] um we all like
[54:53] what happens after the dishwasher's been
[54:55] loaded
[54:56] and everything's washed but somebody has
[54:59] to do the loading
[55:01] and not everybody likes to load a
[55:03] dishwasher i love to eat off the clean
[55:05] plates though that's the part i like
[55:06] best you know
[55:08] and he says unless the law had been my
[55:10] delights
[55:12] i have should have perished in mine
[55:15] afflictions
[55:17] david looked at himself and said and i
[55:19] had not known what the word of god says
[55:21] and he's faithful to keep it i would
[55:23] have died in all that i've
[55:25] i've been afflicted by or i have
[55:26] afflicted myself with
[55:30] brother branham says i am my own worst
[55:32] enemy.
[55:34] and if i wonder sometimes why all this
[55:37] happening i just have to look at myself
[55:39] sometimes
[55:40] rather than try to say what's causing it
[55:43] look at yourself closely
[55:44] he says he says
[55:48] or you know and i would i just this is
[55:52] something i said i thought when i read
[55:53] this
[55:53] if i did not have a revelation
[55:56] of a place prepared for me
[56:00] he says i go to prepare a place for you
[56:03] that where i am you may be there also if
[56:05] i didn't have that
[56:06] an understanding revelation in my heart
[56:09] that this is for a purpose
[56:12] he said the new body might theophany
[56:16] that's god's greatest desire not
[56:18] necessarily
[56:20] a heaven a literal place a mansion to
[56:22] walk in
[56:23] but for you to go back to how he saw you
[56:25] in the beginning
[56:26] with that eternal body that perfect body
[56:30] in that perfect as a son and daughter of
[56:32] god
[56:33] you go and read through and go through
[56:35] the message you see where brother
[56:36] branham is talking about all that's in a
[56:38] seed
[56:39] you'll see where he's talking when he
[56:40] says he goes to prepare a place for you
[56:42] and he talks about this being the old
[56:44] coat and putting on the new coat
[56:48] because heaven would be wonderful but if
[56:50] i go in this body that still hurts and
[56:52] everything
[56:53] i'm just not going to enjoy this much
[56:56] i'm going to be a million 298 000 years
[56:59] old and still aches and pains
[57:02] but there's something greater than that
[57:06] and then he said so i will never forget
[57:08] thy precepts
[57:11] so when i hear precepts i immediately
[57:13] think scriptures
[57:15] thy word so i just looked it up what is
[57:18] a precept
[57:19] a command or principle intended
[57:22] especially as a general rule of action
[57:26] david realized if i take your word and i
[57:28] put it to action and i live in that
[57:32] then i have victory then i have
[57:34] confidence
[57:36] he says for with them thou has
[57:39] quickened me or brought me to life
[57:43] you you know he says another word is an
[57:46] order issued
[57:47] by a by legally constituted authority
[57:52] to a subordinate official
[57:55] and i said amen i'm subordinate to him
[57:59] but i'm his son so my name on the
[58:02] checkbook
[58:03] is the same as his
[58:06] you can take all of god's word and you
[58:09] can have it
[58:12] he says it's another way david said i
[58:15] will
[58:15] ever keep your orders in mind those will
[58:17] be my thoughts paul says
[58:18] think on these things stay with the word
[58:21] brother brandon says don't get outside
[58:22] of the word of god
[58:23] what god has said stay with that for in
[58:26] them
[58:27] i have life
[58:30] you know you see these people say this
[58:32] is life this is life you see these
[58:33] commercials you see
[58:35] advertisements this is life this is life
[58:37] but they don't show you the effects of
[58:39] 30 40 50 years down the road of
[58:41] that life you know
[58:45] and then so he says i am thine
[58:49] save me for i have sought thy precepts
[58:53] i've diligently certainly they've been
[58:55] they've been my heart's desire
[58:57] um i was reading
[59:00] somebody's testimony and
[59:03] and i i don't remember exactly when i
[59:06] was reading it yesterday or the day
[59:07] before and brother they had prayed for a
[59:09] young man's eyes
[59:12] and the young man a young boy said began
[59:14] to read comic books and brother branham
[59:16] said don't read that
[59:18] you'll lose your healing
[59:21] that caught me right there god gave me a
[59:24] good set of eyes he healed my eyes and i
[59:26] go back to the same
[59:28] trash that i wasted it all
[59:32] david says i have sought thy precepts
[59:37] that's what i look for that's what i
[59:38] spent my time with
[59:41] i want to be quickened i want to have my
[59:43] part in the resurrection
[59:46] what should i be looking at what should
[59:47] i be feeding on what should i be
[59:49] thinking of
[59:51] and he says the wicked have waited
[59:54] for me to destroy me but i will consider
[59:58] thy testimonies
[1:00:00] and again i will i will insert here
[1:00:03] i am my greatest enemy i'm the one i
[1:00:06] struggle with the most
[1:00:08] it's not my brother it's not my sister
[1:00:12] sometimes we get to looking around that
[1:00:13] way this one caused me this
[1:00:15] one this one did that this but this is a
[1:00:18] guy that i have to deal with mostly
[1:00:21] and he says
[1:00:24] so so he says they're gonna destroy and
[1:00:27] then i looked at
[1:00:28] i have thy testimonies and when i
[1:00:30] thought of that word that the
[1:00:32] the the things that we've heard about
[1:00:34] him but this also means
[1:00:36] a a sworn statement a statement a
[1:00:39] declaration
[1:00:41] in other words thy testimony is what you
[1:00:43] have said in your word
[1:00:44] and you keep it and then we can testify
[1:00:48] of it
[1:00:48] our lives testified our words testified
[1:00:51] how we act testify about it
[1:00:53] or as the scripture says your
[1:00:54] conversation testify about what he has
[1:00:57] said
[1:01:00] he's then he said this and this is what
[1:01:02] caught my attention also he says
[1:01:04] i have seen an end of all perfection
[1:01:09] and that stopped me and i you know i
[1:01:10] said
[1:01:12] i've seen the end of all perfection
[1:01:14] david got to the point where he saw it i
[1:01:16] looked i said no
[1:01:18] when you look at what david was saying
[1:01:19] he said i've seen everything around me
[1:01:21] and nothing comes to perfection
[1:01:23] everything has that end everything has a
[1:01:25] failure
[1:01:27] in everything that i've done in you know
[1:01:29] i i was talking with brother matt about
[1:01:31] this and we were just sharing a little
[1:01:32] bit
[1:01:33] and we've come to a place we've seen
[1:01:36] what
[1:01:36] should have been accomplished it didn't
[1:01:39] you know what other people had in mind
[1:01:41] what what this government wanted to do
[1:01:43] what this
[1:01:44] king wanted to do or what this pastor or
[1:01:47] this
[1:01:48] minister or try to do
[1:01:51] we've seen it come apart we've seen it
[1:01:52] fall apart
[1:01:54] that's why david said but thy
[1:01:57] commandment
[1:01:58] is exceeding broad so i know that the
[1:02:01] scripture says
[1:02:02] straight is the gate so i looked that up
[1:02:04] and i said thy commandments are eternal
[1:02:06] they're forever they don't stop they
[1:02:08] continue
[1:02:10] they don't end in incompleteness they
[1:02:13] don't end
[1:02:14] in in in a grave they are life
[1:02:20] that's a whole message in itself that
[1:02:21] was that one portion of psalms 119.
[1:02:25] david is saying this now i wonder
[1:02:27] sometimes how many times
[1:02:28] david didn't even realize what he was
[1:02:30] writing
[1:02:32] what he was saying how much of it was
[1:02:33] prophetic
[1:02:35] you know because david was like you and
[1:02:38] i
[1:02:39] he got up in the morning sometimes very
[1:02:40] tired had a headache
[1:02:43] unmotivated do we have to do another day
[1:02:47] like this
[1:02:49] but then he himself would go back i have
[1:02:51] to go back to the word of god i have to
[1:02:53] go back to what you said lord
[1:02:55] and then go that way i'll be with you
[1:02:58] even in you unto the end of the world
[1:03:00] i'll take that god
[1:03:04] you know this this world is not my home
[1:03:07] we sang that one
[1:03:08] i'll take that lord because i'm looking
[1:03:09] for that other one
[1:03:13] i trust that that was a blessing to you
[1:03:14] and then as it was a blessing to me
[1:03:16] this this afternoon just reading that
[1:03:19] and going through that so
[1:03:20] let's read a couple of quotes here and
[1:03:25] from a greater than solomon is here now
[1:03:30] solomon is considered the wisest man
[1:03:33] on earth david was
[1:03:36] a man listed as a man after god's own
[1:03:38] heart
[1:03:40] a man that who failed quite often the
[1:03:44] bible records a lot of it but who knows
[1:03:46] how many other things weren't recorded
[1:03:49] but it said solomon was it was a wise
[1:03:51] man he said
[1:03:52] help me lord to rule thy people in a
[1:03:55] right spirit
[1:03:57] but a greater than solomon is here now
[1:04:01] what a title huh greater than solomon
[1:04:04] the one who gave
[1:04:05] solomon the wisdom he had is here now
[1:04:09] and now we find that the antichrist in
[1:04:11] the last day will deceive all that
[1:04:13] dwells upon the earth
[1:04:14] whose names were not written in the
[1:04:16] lamb's book of life
[1:04:18] from the foundation of the world your
[1:04:20] name was put in god's book before the
[1:04:23] lamb was slain
[1:04:25] god had already seen that he made sure
[1:04:27] it was there
[1:04:29] when his program was laid out the whole
[1:04:31] thing
[1:04:32] you were recognized in that program
[1:04:34] because you got eternal life
[1:04:36] the word eternal never did begin neither
[1:04:39] can it end
[1:04:40] and you are an attribute of god's
[1:04:43] thinking before the world was
[1:04:45] when he was on the cross you were on his
[1:04:47] mind
[1:04:49] he saw a time he didn't we would look at
[1:04:53] it as a on a time limit when when when
[1:04:54] but
[1:04:55] he saw it out whenever it was he said
[1:04:57] this will come to pass
[1:05:01] before the world was eve ever created
[1:05:03] that's only
[1:05:04] that's the only way you can have eternal
[1:05:06] life and that
[1:05:08] life that he was thinking of you is in
[1:05:10] you now
[1:05:11] there is a there is no way to separate
[1:05:14] it it's in there to stay
[1:05:18] so let me tell you this you can't lose
[1:05:20] it
[1:05:22] first of all you didn't buy it it was
[1:05:26] given to you
[1:05:27] and he said all that i have all whose
[1:05:30] names are
[1:05:30] i will not lose a single one of them
[1:05:34] so you can stand on what god has said
[1:05:36] that's his word
[1:05:38] now things that are to be
[1:05:42] the next quote i believe it is things
[1:05:44] that are to be
[1:05:48] look at the leaves come on the trees
[1:05:52] it's because brother branham was living
[1:05:54] in a place that had a lot of trees with
[1:05:55] leaves
[1:05:58] it comes up a good fine leaf brings out
[1:06:01] shade
[1:06:02] puts out its fruit next the first thing
[1:06:04] you know autumn comes strikes it
[1:06:06] death runs right down into the root into
[1:06:09] the ground again
[1:06:11] is that the end of it next spring she
[1:06:13] comes right back up to testify
[1:06:15] oh that's perpetual life
[1:06:18] but a tree has its final and it's
[1:06:22] there's some year
[1:06:22] trees that have are hundreds and
[1:06:24] hundreds of years old
[1:06:26] but they'll come a time when their life
[1:06:28] is gone
[1:06:29] so that's perpetual life he says but
[1:06:32] brother sister we got eternal life
[1:06:35] we've got eternal life to the great one
[1:06:37] who came has gone
[1:06:38] is able to pray prepare us a body and
[1:06:41] these growing pains we feel like
[1:06:44] you women feel a condemned of what you
[1:06:46] do you men that
[1:06:48] that hangs on to seminary doctrines and
[1:06:50] so forth you all want to
[1:06:52] i recite this creed i do this and and
[1:06:54] don't put that too far away because it
[1:06:55] happens right amongst us too
[1:06:58] but there's something right down in you
[1:07:01] when you see the eyes of the blind open
[1:07:04] when when god begins to unveil how does
[1:07:06] god unveil himself
[1:07:08] he said these signs shall follow them
[1:07:09] that belief this is what you're looking
[1:07:12] you're going to see a god in action and
[1:07:15] that's how he identifies himself
[1:07:20] the deaf under the blind all these
[1:07:22] things that's promised see
[1:07:24] the word preached in its power see a
[1:07:27] prostitute off
[1:07:28] the street made a lady see a drunkard
[1:07:30] come out of there and and
[1:07:31] become a real saint of god my see that's
[1:07:34] something life in there
[1:07:36] and you begin to feel well maybe i ought
[1:07:38] to do that
[1:07:39] but see what it what it is it's
[1:07:42] something your body wandering is
[1:07:44] is needing there's a call there's a draw
[1:07:48] i don't want to live in this guy any
[1:07:50] longer than i have to
[1:07:52] because there's something out there when
[1:07:54] there's a deep call
[1:07:55] there's a deep to respond when there's
[1:07:58] something tugging in your heart
[1:08:00] i feel the pull brother green used to
[1:08:04] say
[1:08:04] if there if there's if there's a place
[1:08:06] of of uh
[1:08:09] uh what's the word i'm not i want to say
[1:08:11] condemnation but no it's uh
[1:08:13] when god is speaking to your heart and
[1:08:15] trying to get your attention
[1:08:17] you know and he speaks to you it doesn't
[1:08:20] condemn you it causes you concern to to
[1:08:22] make it right
[1:08:24] satan loves to whisper in your ear and
[1:08:26] tell you you're condemned you're no good
[1:08:27] you're this that's the way he talks to
[1:08:29] you
[1:08:29] but god loves to convict your heart
[1:08:31] reach down and say hey
[1:08:33] let's do this different let's turn it
[1:08:35] let's not be that way
[1:08:36] he says he says
[1:08:40] so maybe i not to do that but what is it
[1:08:42] it's something your body under isn't it
[1:08:44] is needing come on but god's got the
[1:08:47] vitamins right in here for
[1:08:49] every bit of the body jesus has gone to
[1:08:52] prepare the place in the bosom of god
[1:08:54] yes sir
[1:08:55] a little germ son of god little son or
[1:08:58] daughter of god
[1:08:59] jesus only asked for one thing in his
[1:09:02] prayer to the father you know what that
[1:09:03] was
[1:09:04] one thing after all of his sacrifice
[1:09:07] that he did here on earth the life that
[1:09:09] he lived the path that he walked he
[1:09:11] asked for one thing
[1:09:13] that where i am there there may be
[1:09:16] also he asked for our fellowship that's
[1:09:19] the only thing he asked the father in
[1:09:21] the prayer
[1:09:22] your companionship forever
[1:09:27] now there's only one way to hand you had
[1:09:28] to be part of him in the first place
[1:09:30] and if you're desiring it shows what you
[1:09:32] have there
[1:09:34] you know if you want to read this in
[1:09:35] saint john he said the 24th
[1:09:37] then how much should we desire him if
[1:09:40] if he desired now listen if you were
[1:09:43] really born of the spirit of god that
[1:09:45] means
[1:09:45] everything to you see it ain't some
[1:09:47] books of rules
[1:09:49] you don't have to live you don't live by
[1:09:50] laws and so forth you live by the grace
[1:09:53] of god in the spirit of god
[1:09:56] well i was in prayer there just before
[1:09:58] the service again i was thinking lord
[1:10:00] i was just appreciating his sacrifice
[1:10:02] what he did
[1:10:04] going to that cross willingly go
[1:10:07] and there were those that witnessed it
[1:10:10] those that saw it
[1:10:11] and there was those that ran from it
[1:10:14] because they thought it was a failure
[1:10:17] there was a few that stayed close by but
[1:10:20] most of them walked away from it
[1:10:22] not understanding it and
[1:10:25] and the scripture tells us as he's
[1:10:27] walking down the they're walking through
[1:10:29] emmaus
[1:10:30] and he comes up close by him and he
[1:10:31] listens to their conversation a bit and
[1:10:33] he says what are you what are you boys
[1:10:34] talking about
[1:10:36] and they said well where have you been
[1:10:38] don't you know what just took place the
[1:10:39] one we thought was going to be our
[1:10:41] salvation
[1:10:42] was going to take it's going to redeem
[1:10:43] us was going to change he died
[1:10:47] and and we've lost our hope we're just
[1:10:50] going back
[1:10:50] to what we used to do
[1:10:54] and and you know god could have said
[1:10:55] well you're unbelievers
[1:10:57] i'll go try to find somebody else but
[1:11:00] they had representation
[1:11:02] they had something in their heart and
[1:11:04] god had to just go down and prick it a
[1:11:06] little bit
[1:11:07] just like he does it for you every once
[1:11:09] in a while he goes down and he turns it
[1:11:11] up and he turns it a little bit he says
[1:11:14] and you realize that's god speaking
[1:11:15] that's god drawing
[1:11:18] and he tells them oh slow of heart
[1:11:22] o fools he calls him you know what he
[1:11:24] was telling me guys do you guys don't
[1:11:26] believe
[1:11:27] god is alive
[1:11:30] a fool says there is no god they had
[1:11:33] gotten to that point
[1:11:35] he died and he calls him on it but he
[1:11:38] didn't tell him they were going to hell
[1:11:39] for that
[1:11:41] he began to expound he began to talk he
[1:11:44] began said this is what the scripture
[1:11:45] said
[1:11:46] this is this is this prophecy this is
[1:11:48] what david said this was what
[1:11:52] and then he just as he's a gentleman
[1:11:54] brother brahm said he's a gentleman
[1:11:56] he could have reached over and bought
[1:11:58] both of their heads together to get
[1:11:59] their attention but he's a gentleman
[1:12:01] and he talked to them and then he acted
[1:12:03] like he was going to go on
[1:12:06] and sometimes i think he does that to us
[1:12:08] so that we will call out and cry out to
[1:12:10] him no
[1:12:10] don't go and they turn around stay here
[1:12:14] with us
[1:12:14] that's what he had planned to do all
[1:12:16] along
[1:12:18] and then he reveals himself dead
[1:12:21] not our hearts burnt within us amen
[1:12:26] by the grace of god israel in the church
[1:12:31] number two now brother
[1:12:35] binge has been made fun of and
[1:12:37] persecuted and pushed back and
[1:12:38] everything
[1:12:40] one of these glorious mornings
[1:12:41] hallelujah the great master who stands
[1:12:43] in glory pointing
[1:12:44] out his servants not by power not by
[1:12:48] might but by my spirit saith the lord
[1:12:50] not by theology and not by grammar not
[1:12:53] by these
[1:12:54] other things but by simple holy
[1:12:57] unadulterated faith in the son of god
[1:12:59] and what he said in his word he's
[1:13:02] painting a picture
[1:13:03] he's painting the picture what is it a
[1:13:05] holy ghost-filled church that he'll
[1:13:08] for ordain before the beginning of the
[1:13:10] world
[1:13:11] to appear yonder in his glory and some
[1:13:14] of these mornings
[1:13:15] he'll sweep down from the heaven
[1:13:18] hallelujah
[1:13:19] like a great magnet he'll pick up the
[1:13:21] little church that's been persecuted
[1:13:23] hang her yonder in the hall of fame when
[1:13:25] she goes through the sky
[1:13:26] shouting this robe of flesh will drop
[1:13:29] and rise and sees that everlasting price
[1:13:32] shout while passing through the air
[1:13:34] farewell farewell
[1:13:36] sweet hour prayer amen all for that day
[1:13:42] you know and we've shared a little bit
[1:13:44] of of this brother that had sent out a
[1:13:46] few things
[1:13:47] to myself and brother matt and
[1:13:51] the he his barber was giving him a
[1:13:53] haircut and i i know his barber really
[1:13:55] well because he's my dad
[1:13:58] my dad cuts a brother's hair so the
[1:14:01] brother began to tell my dad some of
[1:14:02] these things
[1:14:03] and my dad is pretty blunt on his answer
[1:14:06] sometimes
[1:14:08] um i don't mean to embarrass him or i
[1:14:11] probably won't i might get in trouble
[1:14:12] though
[1:14:13] but my dad would be there and you know
[1:14:15] we're just kids learning and my dad did
[1:14:17] the concrete work and construction and
[1:14:19] and he would tell us nicely to help him
[1:14:22] he would say
[1:14:23] don't be afraid of the shovel it won't
[1:14:25] bite you pick it up and start working
[1:14:27] that's what dad used to say to us and
[1:14:30] sometimes
[1:14:31] i would get a little rough with the
[1:14:33] girls and my wife would say don't be
[1:14:34] like your dad please
[1:14:37] but it's okay dad loved us that's just
[1:14:39] how he did it
[1:14:40] but you know so so the brother was
[1:14:43] sharing with my dad
[1:14:44] you know how he felt and the rapture was
[1:14:48] spiritual so
[1:14:48] dad just answered complaining he said
[1:14:50] you can stay here brother but i'm going
[1:14:52] home with him
[1:14:54] pretty simple answer hey
[1:14:57] this world's not my home i'm just a
[1:14:59] passing through
[1:15:01] farewell farewell sweet hour
[1:15:04] prayer and then the last one conflict
[1:15:09] between god and satan but god at the
[1:15:13] beginning gave his children the atomic
[1:15:15] weapon
[1:15:15] because he's an infinite god now seeing
[1:15:18] that there was
[1:15:19] going to be a conflict so he knew there
[1:15:22] would be a conflict
[1:15:23] he knew there would be war he knew there
[1:15:24] would be battle he said there was going
[1:15:27] to be a battle
[1:15:28] god equipped his children with the right
[1:15:30] kind of ammunition
[1:15:31] right kind of attack the right kind of
[1:15:33] everything they had need of that would
[1:15:35] sweep them all the way from eden
[1:15:37] to the rapture what was it the word the
[1:15:40] word
[1:15:41] that's what defeat satan is the word
[1:15:43] it'll defeat him
[1:15:44] anywhere any place now why do we want to
[1:15:48] substitute something else when we've
[1:15:49] already got the best thing that there is
[1:15:52] the word because it never fails
[1:15:56] david said it's perpetual it's still
[1:15:58] doing everything you told this earth
[1:16:01] this creation do
[1:16:02] it's still doing it because it doesn't
[1:16:05] fail
[1:16:06] and i appreciate that an unfailing god
[1:16:08] who keeps his word
[1:16:11] so let's go back to psalms 8
[1:16:14] 1-9 and this is david's words here
[1:16:21] oh lord our lord how excellent or how
[1:16:23] majestic how noble
[1:16:25] is thy name and all the earth who has
[1:16:28] set thy glory above the heavens
[1:16:30] then he says out of the mouth of babes
[1:16:32] and sucklings has thou
[1:16:34] ordained strength because of thine
[1:16:36] enemies that thou
[1:16:37] might is still the enemy in the avenger
[1:16:40] he says you have made clear your
[1:16:41] strength even out of the mouth of babes
[1:16:43] at the breast because of those
[1:16:45] who are against you that you may put to
[1:16:49] shame the cruel and violent man
[1:16:51] god will do things in simplicity
[1:16:55] in such a simple way that you would look
[1:16:57] and say why
[1:16:59] and then he could say i can do with this
[1:17:01] simple thing what man has tried for
[1:17:03] years and has not accomplished i can do
[1:17:04] it this simple way
[1:17:06] and you can trust him for it you can
[1:17:09] believe him for it he says
[1:17:12] then david says when i consider the
[1:17:13] heavens the work of thy fingers the moon
[1:17:16] and the stars which al has ordained i've
[1:17:18] got up on the roof of our house and
[1:17:21] and before they put the street lamps up
[1:17:22] and it was pretty dark out where we were
[1:17:24] at
[1:17:24] and i would lay when they were supposed
[1:17:26] to have a meteor shower you could just
[1:17:27] lay there and watch them go by
[1:17:30] see the work that god has said the
[1:17:32] things that we're going just
[1:17:33] the beauty of it all he says i see the
[1:17:35] work of thy fingers the moon the stars
[1:17:37] which thou has ordained
[1:17:38] and i think what is man when i see that
[1:17:42] that glory
[1:17:43] down from his glory the splendor and all
[1:17:45] i think what am i
[1:17:48] what is man he says that thou
[1:17:51] art mindful of him and the sons of man
[1:17:54] whom thou
[1:17:55] vist him david says what what in me
[1:17:59] causes you to come down and visit with
[1:18:01] me
[1:18:03] when you have all this prayer splendor
[1:18:05] this royalty this greatness i'm nothing
[1:18:07] in it
[1:18:07] is how dave is looking at himself right
[1:18:09] there
[1:18:11] he says thou has made him a little lower
[1:18:14] than the angels
[1:18:15] and has crowned them with glory and
[1:18:17] honor but if you look at a lot of and
[1:18:20] even what brother branham said in the
[1:18:21] interview
[1:18:21] thou has made him a little over the god
[1:18:23] brother brahman said he made him a son
[1:18:24] of god
[1:18:27] and if you're a son of god you're part
[1:18:29] of god and if you're a daughter of god
[1:18:31] you're part of god
[1:18:33] he said the angels are going to stand
[1:18:34] there they're not going to be they don't
[1:18:35] understand this redemption they don't
[1:18:37] understand all this
[1:18:38] because they never fell they've never
[1:18:40] suffered the pain the sickness
[1:18:42] the disappointments and he says but
[1:18:45] you've made him that way and david
[1:18:46] realizes
[1:18:47] thou made us him to have dominion over
[1:18:49] the works of thy hands
[1:18:51] thou has put all things under his feet
[1:18:57] david is speaking of the man that god
[1:18:58] made
[1:19:02] he says all sheep all oxygenate and the
[1:19:04] beast of the field
[1:19:06] the fowl of the air and the fish of the
[1:19:07] sea and whatsoever pass it through the
[1:19:10] paths of the sea
[1:19:11] and it just made me think the whole
[1:19:13] creation
[1:19:14] is groaning and waiting for the
[1:19:16] manifestation of the sons of god
[1:19:20] let me say it to you all they're waiting
[1:19:22] on you they're waiting on me
[1:19:25] but god knows we are getting there we're
[1:19:28] getting to that place
[1:19:29] and then he says oh lord our lord how
[1:19:32] excellent
[1:19:32] is i name in all the earth
[1:19:36] that's the name that cannot be defiled
[1:19:38] that's a name that nothing bad can be
[1:19:40] said about
[1:19:41] you know you might you might somebody
[1:19:44] might know me say brother aaron's really
[1:19:46] fine man somebody else might say yeah
[1:19:47] but i had problems with him same guy
[1:19:50] depends whose opinion it is but god
[1:19:54] there's only one opinion that matters
[1:19:56] he's perfect
[1:19:57] he's excellent he never fails romans 8
[1:20:00] 11
[1:20:01] maybe we'll get into a little bit more
[1:20:03] of the subject here
[1:20:06] but if the same spirit of him that
[1:20:08] raised up jesus from the dead dwell in
[1:20:09] you
[1:20:10] he that raised up christ from the dead
[1:20:12] shall also quicken your mortal bodies
[1:20:15] by his spirit that dwelleth in you
[1:20:19] quicken to make to live another
[1:20:23] definition is to take from the dead and
[1:20:25] bring it alive
[1:20:27] we thought we were living we thought we
[1:20:29] were doing great
[1:20:30] but we were dead we were dead in sins
[1:20:32] paul said
[1:20:34] we had no idea we thought we were having
[1:20:36] a great life
[1:20:37] until god got a hold you realize that
[1:20:40] wasn't a great life that was leading me
[1:20:41] straight
[1:20:44] what the wages of sin
[1:20:47] you know but the gift of god is eternal
[1:20:49] but paul says
[1:20:50] with that same spirit that raised christ
[1:20:52] from the dead
[1:20:53] it will quicken you
[1:20:56] when that trump shall sound in the in
[1:20:58] the dead in christ are risen
[1:21:00] you don't have to get be embarrassed you
[1:21:02] don't have to say where's my
[1:21:03] you have that same spirit in you some
[1:21:05] shall not see death
[1:21:08] but we shall be changed romans 6
[1:21:12] 1-9 paul gets into this a little bit
[1:21:15] here
[1:21:17] what shall we say then shall we continue
[1:21:19] in sin that grace may abound
[1:21:22] no i i heard a brother say that one time
[1:21:25] he said something and i said well be
[1:21:27] careful brother it doesn't take long if
[1:21:28] you're
[1:21:29] you can take and make grace into a
[1:21:32] disgrace
[1:21:34] and he says i'm tired of hearing that he
[1:21:36] says i hate it when ministers speak that
[1:21:38] way
[1:21:39] he said grace is grace no matter what
[1:21:41] you do
[1:21:44] they graded me a little bit you know
[1:21:48] i know if if i did something wrong
[1:21:52] my wife would still love me because
[1:21:55] she's done it when i've done something
[1:21:56] wrong
[1:21:56] she's proved she would when i failed her
[1:21:58] wait a minute
[1:22:00] but if i really love her and accept the
[1:22:02] grace of her love
[1:22:03] i would do as as little as possible to
[1:22:05] make her upset to make her
[1:22:07] because of that but if i do make a
[1:22:10] mistake
[1:22:11] she would say i forgive you
[1:22:15] brother branham talked about that when
[1:22:16] he was getting ready to leave he knew
[1:22:17] travel overseas and he would say now
[1:22:19] what if i would tell sister branham i'm
[1:22:21] leaving and if i hear you were flirting
[1:22:23] with another man you're a divorced woman
[1:22:25] and she would
[1:22:25] what kind of fellowship kind of uh uh
[1:22:28] what would that be under
[1:22:29] living under a fear living under an ugly
[1:22:32] spirit
[1:22:33] he said so shall we live in sin because
[1:22:35] there is grace he said no god forbid
[1:22:38] he said how shall we that our dead to
[1:22:42] sin
[1:22:42] live any longer therein he says
[1:22:46] know ye not that so many of us were
[1:22:49] baptized into jesus christ were baptized
[1:22:51] into his death brother brahm says
[1:22:53] i was in him i was part of him when he
[1:22:56] was crucified
[1:22:57] and when he was resurrected you had
[1:23:00] representation in him there
[1:23:03] therefore we are buried with him by
[1:23:04] baptism into death
[1:23:06] that like as christ was raised from the
[1:23:08] dead by the glory of the father even so
[1:23:11] we should walk in the newness of life
[1:23:15] now we know baptism getting baptized up
[1:23:18] here wherever he was
[1:23:19] it's just an outward representation of
[1:23:21] what god has done in your life
[1:23:24] the church that we used to go on
[1:23:25] believed that when you went into the
[1:23:26] water and came out that cleansed you
[1:23:29] that's how they interpret it and we
[1:23:31] heard brother branham say you went in a
[1:23:33] a
[1:23:34] a dry center you came out a wet center
[1:23:36] because the water didn't clean you
[1:23:38] it took the blood of jesus christ it
[1:23:41] took you confessing it
[1:23:43] but that was a representation that you
[1:23:45] are willing to admit to the world of
[1:23:46] lodge
[1:23:47] i have accepted his death and is
[1:23:48] burial's resurrection in my place
[1:23:51] that's what paul's telling us here for
[1:23:53] if we have been planted together in his
[1:23:55] likeness of his death
[1:23:56] we shall be also in the likeness of his
[1:23:58] resurrection
[1:24:00] because he lives
[1:24:03] he has risen you know so so we're we're
[1:24:07] here going
[1:24:08] lord you know uh i i know there's a
[1:24:11] resurrection
[1:24:12] there's something in my heart there's a
[1:24:14] deep calling so there's a deep response
[1:24:16] there's something that's drawing me that
[1:24:18] way knowing this that our old man is
[1:24:20] crucified with him
[1:24:21] that the body of sin may be destroyed
[1:24:24] that henceforth we should not serve sin
[1:24:28] does it draw on you does it pull on yes
[1:24:31] you still have that flesh on you
[1:24:33] but you cannot serve two masters
[1:24:36] you serve god and because he is god and
[1:24:40] he is full of mercy when you do make a
[1:24:42] mistake you in turn
[1:24:43] ask him for forgiveness and he'll give
[1:24:44] it to you and not only that but gives
[1:24:47] you a peace and an assurance with it
[1:24:49] he doesn't say okay now you've got to do
[1:24:51] x amount of this and x amount of that to
[1:24:53] deserve it
[1:24:55] i remember talking with brother mark
[1:24:57] mcfadden one day
[1:24:59] and he was talking about an uncle that
[1:25:01] had passed away and they would go back
[1:25:02] and they would ask the priest
[1:25:04] so at what stage is uncle and he would
[1:25:08] say oh
[1:25:08] not too sure but if you say this this
[1:25:10] many more hail marys
[1:25:12] and if you give us this much more money
[1:25:14] we'll get them up a little higher
[1:25:16] well at that rate why let them go you
[1:25:18] can make yourself rich that way
[1:25:21] that's that's man's way but god rich in
[1:25:24] mercy for once and for all
[1:25:27] amen for he that is dead
[1:25:31] is free from sin paul says
[1:25:35] let's continue on there now if we'd be
[1:25:38] dead in christ with christ we believe
[1:25:40] that
[1:25:41] we also shall live with him knowing that
[1:25:44] christ being raised from the dead dieth
[1:25:46] no more
[1:25:47] death has no more dominion over him
[1:25:50] so if it's christ in you death has no
[1:25:52] more dominion over you
[1:25:56] right if that same spirit that would
[1:25:59] raise christ from the dead
[1:26:00] it would raise you also amen
[1:26:06] let's finish the last few scriptures
[1:26:08] here on this
[1:26:14] i guess that was the last one there on
[1:26:16] verse 9.
[1:26:18] and then let's go to saint luke
[1:26:22] i was looking at the wrong one on top i
[1:26:24] saw the 11 from the previous
[1:26:26] scripture luke chapter 20
[1:26:31] verses 35-38
[1:26:34] he says but they which will shall be
[1:26:36] accounted worthy to obtain
[1:26:38] that world and the resurrection from the
[1:26:40] dead he says neither
[1:26:42] mary nor given in marriage now he is
[1:26:44] speaking to the men that
[1:26:45] said whose wife is is she going to be
[1:26:48] on that side he says but now he takes
[1:26:50] into this he says oh there's not going
[1:26:52] to be any of that over there he said
[1:26:53] neither can they die anymore for they
[1:26:56] are equal unto the angels
[1:26:57] and are the children of god being the
[1:27:00] children of the resurrection
[1:27:03] if you're a child of god you're a child
[1:27:05] of the resurrection because you're part
[1:27:07] of him
[1:27:11] next two verses 37 38 i believe
[1:27:15] now that the dead are raised even moses
[1:27:17] showed at the bush when he called the
[1:27:18] lord
[1:27:19] the lord the god of abraham the god of
[1:27:21] isaac and the god of jacob for he is not
[1:27:24] a god of the dead but of the living
[1:27:26] for all live unto him
[1:27:30] i'm calling out to the god of jacob to
[1:27:32] the god of
[1:27:33] isaac to the god of abraham to the god
[1:27:36] of my father to the god of my mother to
[1:27:38] the god of my brother to the god of my
[1:27:40] sister all part of the family of god
[1:27:43] i was listening as brother branham
[1:27:45] finishes up the message things that are
[1:27:47] to be and he's standing over the crowd
[1:27:49] he says now stand the heels
[1:27:50] and each one of you place your hands he
[1:27:53] says
[1:27:54] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[1:27:56] they shall recover your
[1:27:57] brother your sister in christ he said
[1:27:59] it's yours
[1:28:01] it's yours and i understand sometimes
[1:28:04] you know there's a a brother that has a
[1:28:06] gift and there's a ministry and all and
[1:28:09] and he can bless us with it but what if
[1:28:11] he's on the other side of the world
[1:28:14] and you have a christian person right
[1:28:16] next to you who has the same spirit
[1:28:19] the spirit of christ you can have what
[1:28:21] you ask for
[1:28:24] he's not the god of the dead but a god
[1:28:26] of the living
[1:28:28] and all live unto him and remember we
[1:28:29] had read in romans 8
[1:28:32] 6 last week he says
[1:28:36] romans 8 6.
[1:28:39] or maybe i gave you the wrong one
[1:28:42] it's one we had read last week but to
[1:28:44] unto but to us there is but one god you
[1:28:47] know i think it's corinthians 8 6 i did
[1:28:48] that
[1:28:51] let's do first corinthians 8 6. i i
[1:28:53] wrote it down wrong here
[1:28:56] and i didn't ask her to help me check it
[1:28:58] i checked it myself so
[1:28:59] i can't blame right on this one
[1:29:02] i do it every once in a while i write
[1:29:05] down
[1:29:06] the one the scripture that i'm reading
[1:29:07] but it's not the one i'm referring to so
[1:29:09] but unto us there is but one god the
[1:29:11] father of whom are all things
[1:29:13] and we in him and one lord jesus christ
[1:29:17] by whom are all things and we by him
[1:29:22] all in him controlled by him bought by
[1:29:26] him loved by him the life of him
[1:29:28] that's all we don't we don't do this on
[1:29:30] our own at all it's through him saint
[1:29:32] john 11
[1:29:33] 25 and 26.
[1:29:41] this is when jesus is there after
[1:29:44] lazarus
[1:29:45] has passed away and and
[1:29:48] martha and mary are there and and and
[1:29:52] he tells the he she tells i know that
[1:29:54] he'll live in the resurrection
[1:29:56] they had that promise they had that
[1:29:59] thing but he says
[1:30:00] jesus says unto her i am the
[1:30:04] resurrection he had not died yet
[1:30:07] he had not resurrected yet this wasn't
[1:30:10] after the crucifix was before i am the
[1:30:13] resurrection
[1:30:14] and the life he that believeth in me
[1:30:17] though he were dead
[1:30:18] yet shall he live in the spiritual sense
[1:30:23] and in lazarus in the physical sense
[1:30:27] nothing is impossible for god and
[1:30:30] whosoever liveth and believeth in me
[1:30:32] shall never die
[1:30:34] believeth thou this and he is speaking
[1:30:37] of what never dying the same when
[1:30:40] brother branham says after he crossed
[1:30:41] into the other
[1:30:42] the other side he says i'm not afraid of
[1:30:45] death
[1:30:46] death is just that carrier to get me
[1:30:48] from this life
[1:30:49] to that life you know it's not
[1:30:53] how far down is he in in in in you know
[1:30:55] in
[1:30:56] in is the catholic doctrine you know in
[1:30:58] purgatory
[1:30:59] well we'll get him up a little bit we'll
[1:31:00] take him down we'll do this we'll do
[1:31:02] that
[1:31:03] we'll play with a man's life as long as
[1:31:05] you got the finances to play with us
[1:31:09] but god says no it's settled it's done
[1:31:12] already
[1:31:13] first corinthians chapter 15.
[1:31:21] we'll do verses 13 to 26.
[1:31:26] again paul deals with it but if there is
[1:31:28] no resurrection of the dead
[1:31:30] then christ is not risen and this
[1:31:33] religion is in vain it's like any other
[1:31:35] religion
[1:31:36] might as well as be a buddha might as
[1:31:38] well be something else hey find
[1:31:40] something else that you like better
[1:31:42] if christ hasn't written what appeals to
[1:31:45] you better
[1:31:47] but he said there is no resurrection of
[1:31:49] dead then christ has not risen and if
[1:31:51] christ be not risen
[1:31:52] then our preaching is in vain and your
[1:31:54] faith also is in vain
[1:31:57] comes to no end paul says that yea
[1:32:00] we are found false witnesses of god
[1:32:02] because we have testified of god
[1:32:06] that he raise up christ whom he raised
[1:32:08] whom he raised
[1:32:09] not up if it be that the dead not raise
[1:32:12] not
[1:32:14] paul puts it pretty plain there
[1:32:18] excuse me for if the dead rise not
[1:32:22] then is not christ raised and if christ
[1:32:24] be not raised your faith is in vain
[1:32:26] now isn't that the same scream church
[1:32:28] again he said but if christ be not
[1:32:30] raised your faith is
[1:32:31] in vain and you are yet in your sins
[1:32:35] and the wages of sin is death
[1:32:38] then they which are also are falling
[1:32:40] asleep in christ are perish we have no
[1:32:42] hope
[1:32:44] but let me tell you one we just heard
[1:32:46] last week who crossed over and lord
[1:32:47] allowed him to go on to the other side
[1:32:49] and those who had passed on
[1:32:54] they weren't just a wisp in the clouds
[1:32:55] they weren't just a thought
[1:32:57] they were alive they were real and he
[1:32:59] says for
[1:33:00] if in this life only we have hope in
[1:33:02] christ then we are of
[1:33:04] all men most miserable
[1:33:09] let's go on
[1:33:14] but now is christ risen from the dead
[1:33:18] and become the firstfruits of them that
[1:33:20] slept
[1:33:21] for since by man came death by man came
[1:33:24] also the resurrection of the dead
[1:33:26] for as in adam all die even so in christ
[1:33:29] shall
[1:33:29] all be made alive but every man in his
[1:33:33] own order christ the firstfruits
[1:33:35] and afterward they that are christ at
[1:33:37] his comings paul said there's an order
[1:33:39] for this
[1:33:40] and because everything else god has has
[1:33:42] ordained and has come to pass and david
[1:33:44] said
[1:33:44] how magnificent how wonderful everything
[1:33:46] does exactly you say
[1:33:48] so will this it's still the word of god
[1:33:51] and it's
[1:33:51] eternal then cometh
[1:33:54] the end and he shall have delivered up
[1:33:56] the kingdom of god even the father
[1:33:58] when he shall have put down all the rule
[1:34:00] and all the authority and power
[1:34:02] for he must reign till he hath put all
[1:34:05] the enemies
[1:34:06] under his feet the last enemy that shall
[1:34:08] be destroyed
[1:34:09] is death amen
[1:34:13] amen what a promise we have in god what
[1:34:16] a future we have in god
[1:34:18] but what i like now is we can have some
[1:34:20] taste of it now
[1:34:22] don't have to wait till after you're
[1:34:24] dead there's something in you that
[1:34:26] responds or something
[1:34:28] things that god does a healing something
[1:34:31] that he does is
[1:34:31] it's real it's alive and then we'll read
[1:34:36] 54 and 55 as paul finishes
[1:34:40] so when this corruptable shall have put
[1:34:42] on incorruption and this mortal shaft
[1:34:44] put on immortality
[1:34:45] then shall be brought to pass the saying
[1:34:47] that is written
[1:34:49] death is swallowed up in victory o
[1:34:52] death where is i staying o grave where
[1:34:55] is i victory
[1:34:57] job sat there and he looked and he said
[1:34:59] i see the flower it comes up in spring
[1:35:02] and then in summer it goes
[1:35:04] and then fall comes around and it
[1:35:05] disappears but i see it again next
[1:35:07] spring
[1:35:09] my wife has put some seed out there in
[1:35:11] front and and
[1:35:12] it grows up and it's uh you know either
[1:35:14] in the spring or the winter
[1:35:16] for us and then and then it disappears
[1:35:19] it gets dry and everything like that but
[1:35:21] let the rains fall in the springtime
[1:35:23] come around and they
[1:35:24] begin to blossom again and that
[1:35:27] job said that's what i see but i've seen
[1:35:29] many a men put in their grave and i
[1:35:31] haven't seen one come back
[1:35:32] up but something in job cries out that
[1:35:35] representation of god he said
[1:35:37] i know my redeemer liveth and with these
[1:35:41] eyes i shall
[1:35:42] behold him i have the same promise you
[1:35:45] have that same promise
[1:35:48] you know some of you younger ones are
[1:35:49] thinking well i've still got a lot of
[1:35:51] time to go
[1:35:52] brother brother arne was asking me he
[1:35:54] said so when did you guys
[1:35:56] move here i said in 1976 and i was 16
[1:36:00] years old
[1:36:02] and 60 would never come
[1:36:06] but it's here but you know what i still
[1:36:10] have that same promise and it's closer
[1:36:12] now than it's ever been before
[1:36:15] and when you get into his presence and
[1:36:17] he comes around you you get a taste of
[1:36:18] it you begin to see when
[1:36:19] how he visits you and minister you watch
[1:36:21] somebody receive their healing
[1:36:23] a change in life a sinner become a saint
[1:36:25] like brother braham said a prostitute
[1:36:27] become a
[1:36:28] a sweet christian lady and you realize
[1:36:30] that's that's
[1:36:31] evidence of this eternal life
[1:36:35] he says oh death where is i sting o
[1:36:37] grave where is thy victory
[1:36:44] amen is that the truth
[1:36:47] is that the truth in your life can you
[1:36:49] stand in the face of death and says
[1:36:51] oh grave where is thy victory oh death
[1:36:53] whereas i sting
[1:36:55] i've stepped from this life into the
[1:36:57] next life
[1:36:58] no more sorrow no more crying no more
[1:37:01] pain no more
[1:37:04] all i can use is words to try to explain
[1:37:06] it
[1:37:07] and i'll say to you the same way brother
[1:37:08] brown said don't miss it
[1:37:11] don't miss it make sure your reservation
[1:37:13] is stamped make sure that everything is
[1:37:15] taken care of
[1:37:16] check your own life look at it closely
[1:37:17] and say god remind me
[1:37:19] bring it to pass in my life that when
[1:37:22] there's a deep calling there's a deep
[1:37:23] response
[1:37:25] a desire for you let us bury it
[1:37:30] lord we thank you you are the
[1:37:33] resurrection
[1:37:34] you are the life it's not a formula
[1:37:38] it's not if you study this so many
[1:37:40] messages if you pray this long
[1:37:42] if you give so much in offerings if you
[1:37:45] attend so many services if
[1:37:48] if you give it your biggest best effort
[1:37:49] or if you seclude yourself
[1:37:51] and and and become a monk to a religion
[1:37:54] it has nothing to do with that lord
[1:37:57] it's all in christ being in you
[1:38:00] living in you and and you said our names
[1:38:03] are written in the lamb's
[1:38:04] book of life therefore it's eternal life
[1:38:08] lord we thank you for it and lord we
[1:38:11] want to show our appreciation
[1:38:13] and our love back to you by saying be it

[1:38:33] one not made with hands lord
