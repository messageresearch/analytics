you will never be the same lord help us to recognize your presence as we spoke last sunday job said but i perceive him not the great the one we sang about we came down from his glory oh how i love him yet sometimes we perceive him not but he said i'll be in the midst of you and he keeps his word so i appreciate that we have some prayer requests some praise and some announcements to make so let's remember bethany carey how she's not feeling well with headache and nauseous i believe that says maybe put these on it might help and some nausea so let's remember our sister bethany brother ed dougal let me know yesterday and also this morning both him and sister kathy were not feeling well brother ed is having been having some low back problems and they were both feeling like they had a cold or something so remember and sister joyce dougal left me saying she was not feeling well this morning either i remember my daughter sarah the the newport and that they put in the things that they did it working very well but she's having a reaction to something that's causing her body to itch quite a bit so she's had to take some medication that leaves her very drowsy so she doesn't feel that way so but just remember her brother robert figueroa called me um i guess it would have been tuesday i believe it was and the covet has hit the church there with brother robert there was five of the congregation including his daughter and granddaughter who tested positive with cobit brother robert and sister delia had themselves tested and they were fine but they've had to close the church down because there's there's only about 10 people in the church so he just requested prayer and then my wife requests prayer for her sister elizabeth she's not been feeling well for the last few days and so would remember her in prayer i got the text from brother matthew watkins this morning that their results came back negative but they were both not feeling very well still but the church had some positive results in the in the congregation so that's the reason why brother matt is not here he could not travel couldn't get on an airplane until without the results so um lord willing everything works well he'll be here this coming weekend we put the announcement on whatsapp and i know not everybody has it but they are so and i went to the doctor on thursday the surgeon and the surgeon said it has healed very very well the infection is gone the fever is gone but she said it would be better to do the surgery in the hospital than in her office there's better equipment or more equipment so they've scheduled it for the 21st that would be a tuesday morning to remove the cyst and all that is i ministered last sunday but i was running a low-grade fever and i did it anyways and then paid for it later it's the body is is fine-tuned god made it a certain way but then sin came in and we're affected by it but by the grace of god in the in the mercies of god he keeps us he said i'm the lord god that healeth all thy diseases so we appreciate that brother robert chacon says i would like to thank god for the the good results from the blood test so everything is negative so praise god for that so so we uh appreciate his grace and his mercy yesterday myself brother lyle and brother dan evans went up to the minister's meeting and um that that we've had this i believe the third one now and got to i think they said there was 53 brothers there that either ministers pastors associates and we had some brothers from north carolina south carolina from tennessee and stuff visiting also and so we had a good time of fellowship and one of the brothers brother tim calhoun from tennessee was going to be down in tucson this week getting to know so and we invited him to minister for us on wednesday night so lord willing brother tim calhoun will be with us wednesday night so if you'll stand with me [Music] you have a need you know you have a need with the other hand you know the god that answers that need say lord i believe and sometimes we even have to say lord help out my own beliefs so lord as we we raise our hands lord raising the hands is a sign of surrender it's a sign of praise lord but sometimes with outstretched arms we're just saying lord help we need you to come minister to us lord we live in frail bodies weak bodies lord and we know lord that there's a promise and it's a promise we hold to lord that we we shall be changed lord but you provided healing you've provided mercy you've provided grace in this time lord and so we accept it we believe it we thank you for it lord meet the need of every heart and raise those listening and those watching today lord may you meet with him also lord we ask it in jesus christ's name amen and a sister joyce dougal and sister connie carey sister joyce has put on this the youth uh dinner thing that she's done for quite some time and they're they're planning to do it again and there's an announcement put up right out here in the bulletin and the big thing that sister joyce and sister connie need is some drivers to chaperone and to take the young people they're going to have what they call a progressive meal where they eat at one place part of the meal another place and end up i believe at the caries and celebrate the evening their show sister connie is here today so if you've got questions she might give you a lot more detail on that so and then brother israel just sent me a announcement for their meetings october 8th through the 10th their annual meetings at shalom tabernacle we'll try to get the that set up also so you can get the information and brother ted passadly also sent uh information on their meetings coming up and when they send in to us it's because we're welcome to go so i appreciate that this morning we have our brother dennis mcgarry who we had spoken to several times and i appreciate the brothers willing to come out and they've they've made a comment i had a brother tell me yesterday he had come to minister for once he goes there's such a liberty to minister at the tabernacle there's such a spirit that is it is sweet to minister to and i appreciate that that's that's the response that you give for a ministering brother it's as a parent and you're you're talking to your child and your child is paying attention to everything but you it gets hard and as a minister when the people begin to draw begin to pull i have a need lord answer then the minister is able to to deliver what god has put in your heart so so this morning brother dennis mcgeary also this evening service so come expecting come believing come trust in that lord we'll meet that amen amazing grace how sweet this sound as brother dennis makes his way down here [Music] like me i once was lost [Music] [Applause] [Music] twas grace that [Applause] taught my heart to fear and embrace my fears really how precious [Music] [Applause] [Music] i have already his grace that brought me say [Music] it will lead me home and when we've been there when we've been there ten thousands [Music] rise shining [Music] [Applause] [Music] days to sing [Music] praise god [Music] praise god praise god is gone praise god grace comes praise god [Music] god bless you this morning like to greet you in the name of the lord jesus on this beautiful resurrection morning so sweet to know that that's what we've come to do is to honor his resurrection and not only to honor it but to believe in it and to know that that's our hope is in what he can do not what we can do but what he can do and and to come with us inside sincere heart believing that the lord's every bit is able this morning to do miracles to do miracles in our heart in our life in our body that he's every bit the same that he always has been and it's in that knowledge and faith and trust in him that we approach his word this morning and knowing that it's a very sacred thing and jesus when he was on earth he said my words are spirit and life and we that are believers we've seen that supernatural thing that is his word works in your life it's kind of a paradox that god works and so as we approach his word this morning i'd like to tell you how honored we are to be here and to be with you and to worship the lord with you and just a great honor and privilege so if you'd like to turn with me while you're standing in the book of john the sixth chapter and the 65th verse i'd like to thank our musicians just so much appreciate that jesus speaking in john the 6th chapter in the 65th verse therefore said i unto you no man can come unto me except it were given unto him of my father from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him then said jesus unto the twelve will ye also go away then simon peter answered him lord to whom shall we go thou hast the words of eternal life i'd like to turn also in the book of judges in the 11th chapter the 11th chapter of the book of judges and verse 34 and japheth came to mispa unto his house and behold his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances and she was his only child and beside her he had neither son nor daughter and it came to pass when he saw her that he rent his clothes and said alas my daughter thou has brought me very low and thou and thou art one of them that trouble me for i have opened my mouth unto the lord and i cannot go back let's bow our heads dear lord jesus where can we go where can we go for healing where can we go for forgiveness where what what pool where could we go to wash ourselves from our sins and iniquity lord we have no place to go this morning but to you when we look for hell our help comes only from you man's help is vain and all these things of earth are fleeing and failing and fading away but our hope is in you this morning lord and we asked this morning lord that you would come and somehow lord despite ourselves lord that you'd come and get into your word and move in our hearts and change us lord work you're working in us because we belong to you we are yours lord we've given you our heart in our life now lord we ask that you'd come and minister to our hearts we're so needy of you lord we ask you to come in jesus name believing that we have what we ask because you said if we believe when we ask we shall have what we ask and we ask these things in jesus name amen amen god bless you this morning it's so wonderful to look to the word of god you may be seated the disciples were in a a place of necessity they had forsaken their religious life they had many of them forsaken their jobs or forsaken uh their business and maybe even some of their family and camaraderie to be identified with the lord jesus and when the lord oh it's off okay it's not on there very good i can try to change that i'm sorry saints for this little interruption uh okay is that a little that's good okay excuse me and they had identified with the lord jesus and then jesus began to say some very hard things about being the bread of life come down from heaven and he also said he spoke about eating his flesh and drinking his blood and some of those things as we are bible readers seem very strange to us and sometimes we we wonder you know what we should understand from that and in the days of the when the dark ages when the catholic church was the only church to be to go to and to attend they began to teach the people that the only way that you can do this is through the sacrament of communion and they taught these things you know that jesus said this but what they also taught was the way that you fulfill that of eating his flesh and drinking his blood is by partaking of the sacrament of communion and so they devised this ritual in which the priest would have the power the power that was given him by the pope or invested in him and they had a mass and at a certain point in the mass the priest holds up this little wafer and they call it the miracle of the mass and they call it the mystery of transubstantiation it's an awful big word and it's an awful big idea that by the power of the priest and if there be any catholics in here you'll know these things that that bread becomes literally the body of christ and the same he holds up the cup and it and and and you're to believe that that miracle actually happened and it happens in every mass and then when you come forward and the priest holds that little wafer out he says unto you body of christ you believe it's the body of christ and you say amen and they put it on your tongue uh and as every good catholic knows don't let it stick to the roof of your mouth because you'll never get it off until it dissolves but the word always interprets itself and after those dissertations that jesus said he said the words that i speak unto you he said the flesh profiteth nothing but the words that i speak unto you they are life so he makes these he he expresses to the people that i am the bread of god that came out of heaven and he expresses those things to the people and then he gives them a little inside way to understand that this is the partaking that you believe in him and you believe in his word and you take his word into your heart not into your intellect not into your mind but the the mind is is the womb to the soul that's why it's so tragic to give our minds over to unpure things and unprofitable things because this same womb of our mind is such a sacred betting ground for the things that god wants to do to us he brings it first to our mind and down into our hearts he brings it into our hearing sometimes somehow supernaturally he's brought you into the hearing of his word and maybe life becomes normal to you and it doesn't seem very supernatural but it really is look out in the world and see how many are truly born again and have given their hearts and lives to the lord jesus and are partaking of him and his word they're very few and so it's a very marvelous thing and a great miracle that you are believing today now paul in hebrews he took 10 chapters to explain what we are believing and one of the first things that he puts forth is that jesus became man and he explains the kind of man that jesus was and how god became man and he speaks of the son of man and by the if the by the lord's help i'd like to save that for this evening but it's that great mystery that paul in the first chapters of hebrews is talking about how that god became man to fulfill his word and to become a kinsman to become a high priest to become the the first son of many brethren to become what we are and the prophet of god said that he had to become what we are to know what it was to be tempted and to know what it was that we go through and and i think we've spoke on it before how that we would have maybe thought that god was omnipotent uh and knowing everything that he would just know because he's god he would know what we went through but isn't it marvelous that god would send a divine interpreter of his word to take us a little deeper than that and to say that he had to become one of us to really know what we're going through and these are things that are taken on by the heart these are things that touch your heart and that that pull you into faith by your affections for christ because of what he did for you and it's a marvelous thing that your when your heart is drawn into the realms of god and into the word of god it's a much greater thing than just looking and believing and saying well i can accept that i can believe that can you imagine if you fell in love with somebody and you tried to express to them that you know i love you i want to marry you and the person just kind of said yeah okay i can relate you know that's it's conceivable it's like you know okay so what i don't mean to make humor but but but but god put in us a love for him and for his word so that this could be a love affair then that love abiding in us is what makes us love our fellow man and it's not enough that we believe the truth we're not knocking on every door and saying join the church because we have the truth it's the sensible thing to do no we're saying do you know what it is to fall in love with god do you know the love of god do you know what that could do to you and and that burns in your heart and you see your fellow man and and compassion for your fellow man raises up in you and the love of god reaches out to that person and said oh if you could just know the lord what a deliverance you could have what a peace you could have what what healing you could have what what joy of being clean and free before god it's just as close as me standing to you my brother if you can receive it but sometimes the gospel the love of god in the word of god as we've heard it said many times that that the the thund the lightning and the thunder that's born out of jagged skies is what brings the rain and if the lord help us this morning i'd like to speak on a little subject i cannot go back because peter when he i mean paul in hebrews when he lays forth this subject of what the faith is he talks about jesus and the who he was and how he became man and how he offered himself the final and complete sacrifice for sin and he says in hebrews 11 and 16 or 10 and 16 this is the covenant that i will make with them quoting old testament scripture this is the covenant that i will make with them after those days saith the lord i will put my laws in their hearts and in their minds will i write them and their sins and iniquities will i remember no more so can god forget yes is that ascribing weakness to god no is it the word of god yes because god said i will remember no more so can god forget your sins and forget your iniquities yes he promised he would and then he went on to say he was speaking of this sacrifice that jesus made at calvary how complete it was and he said one by one offering hath he perfected forever them that are sanctified so for those that he made this offering for those that come under this sacrifice that he gives that is done once and for all and he says in verse 18 of hebrews 10 now where remission of these is there is no more offering for sin because there was only one so it doesn't matter how much we want to bring a greater repentance how much we want to give a greater oath this time that lord i'm gonna do better no matter how as the songwriter said could my tears forever flow and my zeal no langer no these for sins could not atone thou must save and thou alone i believe sometimes as believers we we look for this offering for sin we think well if i just would just maybe beat myself and show myself how you should know better and and and you believe the message of the hour and you've heard the prophet say these things or or you're a bible reader and you know better excuse me and after all this time and you serving the lord and making this profession and teaching others and and and and and claiming a perfect word and then you stumble and fall again certainly if we could give ourselves enough of a beating it would be some offering for sin but there isn't another offering there's only one offering there's not a greater repentance maybe you you you say well if i could find a bigger tub of of being sorry you know before i i i i i brought this gallon bowl of being sorry but now i feel so much more guilty because i owe the lord after all he's done for me i'm farther down the road so now i'm bringing a five gallon bucket of sorry for my offering there is no offering where remission of these is there is no more offering for sin you say brother mcgary are you saying we shouldn't repent yes we should repent but when we kneel there we can only accept the atonement that has already been made we can only embrace it we can only receive it we can only believe in its power to make us clean to make us pure we have no other place to go of necessity we must believe oh i would to god he helped me this morning to express it how i feel it in my heart but it seems like the enemy and i don't know what it is he always is demanding something that looks a little cleaner a little crisper a little more well done a little more uh you know not so rough around the edges not so full them up down and get up again and fall down and get up again but you know what the the thing that he hates is that you're going forward that that that forward momentum is taking you towards your home in glory it's a demonstration of your love affair for him and his word because you must go on but it is born of necessity and paul talked about these necessities in our lives and and and in his battles and he said god put necessities in my life and he put these things that i have to overcome and it's it's not as pretty as we want it to be but we are going on and you say well did you did you attain to some noble revelation that that you got so high and so powerful and you were so much of an overcomer that you've just learned to have to go you know full speed ahead at all times and stay the course and you know all the motors are running good and and the ship is headed toward port and she's a beautiful sight no though the sails be battered the anchor holds the ship's going on and paul showed up on the shore the ship was beat to pieces but he said stick with me and stick with the ship because there's gonna come no harm just believe this because the angel of the lord came and told me this night that we're not gonna this thing is not gonna come to doom and death but we're all going to be saved just stick with this thing and write it out and that's what the disciples said to jesus said where else can we go and so paul brings the believer to a place where there isn't any other place of atonement but in jesus christ there's no place of perfection there's no place of safety there there's no other place to be clean but in jesus christ having therefore brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of jesus by a new and living way which hath which he hath consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh and so after establishing this faith he goes on into chapter 11 and he says and just the kind of the intro to chapter 11 is for yet a little while and he that shall come will come and will not tarry now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him but we are not of them who draw back unto perdition but of them that believe to the saving of the soul and he begins to talk about those that had faith and the company that we are numbered in and i believe that all of us we like to be appreciated we like to hear some compliments we like to hear affirmations but you know if you're a son or daughter of god you were born into this and god has given you a revelation that you are a son or daughter of god you're a soldier of the cross you have a revelation within you that this is what you were born for that you were born to serve the lord and that abides within you there's a witness in you there is a spirit in you and paul said in galatians because you are sons god's put the spirit of his son in you crying of a father and no matter what condition you get in there is always that witness in you that cries out to god because you are a son or daughter of god and that's that's what you do that's who you are and this living for god is what we do because it's in our genes it's it's in our dna it's in our heart we're going to get to a place here if god will help us but if we to get praise or if we don't get praise if we get recognition or if we don't get recognition we're not living by that we're living by faith and it's a revelation that god put in our heart of who we are and what our mission is and what our purpose is and what is living and and abiding and working and moving in our heart and soul and what's moving this ship forward in hell or high water is this love of god and his word that he put within us and it will bring the ship to harbor we believe it of necessity strange to say but we have no place else to go after god has brought to you the truth of who he is jesus said if i had not come and done a work among you which no man could do you would have no sin but now sin lays at your door because jesus did come i remember witnessing to a man from france and we brought him to the post office and i said now i said now it's on you to believe or disbelief you know we had kind of told them the gospel story and things and the man began to shake and and stutter and he said it's not fair he said it's not fair what you've what the place that you brought me here what am i to do and i marvel that how a man could have the depth of understanding that he understood that he was right in that place that he had to believe or not believe and he recognized he was right there and he was kind of saying well how can you do this to me and you know i i i had to feel for the man but of course it wasn't me it's god does that god brings his word to you and you are put in the position to accept or reject and as god reveals more of his word to you you realize that if you believe this then you must believe that if you believe that the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world and you believe in god's foreknowledge and let's put just put it simply does god know who's going to heaven and who's not yes when did god know that did he just learn that when you accepted him and said i accept jesus as my savior and he says oh i didn't know that man glad to have you in the family no he knew what your decision would be actually he knew you before the foundation of the world and really if you're part of him your spirit now was always part of him i wasn't going to go here this morning and i do want to be a gentleman and pay attention to the time perhaps the lord will help us and give us understanding and if you'll notice how that eve was united with adam she became part of him god did you notice in genesis 1 and 27 he created man male and female created he them so if you read your bible that's just how it reads now isn't that interesting that he say he created man male and female but this was the creation that was in god's own image spirit man so remember there's no man to teal the soil at this point there's no this isn't god creating man from the dust of the earth this is the man that was created in the image of god he was spirit man and this spirit man was male and female he created man male and female created he them now the man was both male and female when it come to being in the spirit of feminist and masculine then god took from his side a rib did you notice the body part was the byproduct but not the spirit the body part was the byproduct but not the spirit the body part of the woman was a byproduct after the creation had been finished god took from the side of adam a rib and made a woman but not the spirit the spirit was part of adam for he was both man and woman feminist spiritually speaking both masculine and feminine now don't you see the great picture we in the flesh are different we're like a byproduct a created being by holy wedlock but in spirit we are sons and daughters of god not some other spirit but the spirit of the living god we are in his likeness in his unity in the perfect image of the living god because we become sons and daughters not separated but the same spirit the same god the same person we won't go on but when we first believe we fell in love with the lord jesus not really understanding but it was so great to know his love he came by a demonstration of his spirit he came close to you and he made himself known to you and he loved you and you recognized that and you were afraid to draw an eye to him but he said i love you and i forgive you and you took him at his word and you and you came a little closer based on your faith in his forgiveness not really understanding but your heart was moving you in this direction because you are reciprocating to his presence he came close to you and because that you are made out of metal his magnet pulled you to himself because of who you are because of that affinity between you and the great magnet you couldn't do anything but come so in hebrews paul starts talking about how that you're going to have to live by this faith this this thing that is working in you it's not going to line up with reasoning and intellect and all the affirmations of this present world that we are living in but it's going to move you as it did these heroes of faith and he begins to name all these heroes of faith and we won't go all those places but he does come into verse 30 and he you know he names uh uh abraham and enoch and noah and abraham and sarah and isaac and jacob and joseph and moses and moses's parents and joshua and israel and he comes down to a harlot now how is it that a woman that sells her body for a living comes into this registry of the heroes of faith and god preserves this woman in his word as one of those that lived by faith and it's beautiful when you go back and read it and you just hear rahab pouring out her heart to these spies and he's saying she's saying this is the way it really is i don't know what they were putting on posters in the streets i don't know what they were saying on the radio or on the television maybe they're telling all the people you know be strong uh jericho's a great city we can run horses around there and i don't know what the promotion was at the day in the hour but she bore her heart to these spies i don't know how they find their way to the harlot's house god always shrouds his words and his workings in such a mysterious thing how what in the world would you say if a couple of brothers went overseas and they said yeah well we're at this harlot's house and she believes and you're going what the scripture doesn't offer any explanations it just tells it the way it is and here she is and then she tells the spies the real story i don't know maybe if she they would have went into somebody you know kind of polished in high society and everything they would say well we're not really afraid of you guys you know we've been here a long time and we've had a lot of people raise up like you and do crazy stuff like run around the building but this woman i don't think she had anything to hide she just was what she was and she said you know what's going on here we're all scared to death we heard of you we heard you passed through the red sea we heard that who you've conquered on your way here and all i want to do is ask for mercy all i want to do is ask for mercy for me and my house she's still thinking of her family i don't know what her family thought of her but she thought a lot of her family oh my oh there's nothing quite so sad as unrequited love people get rejected but the beauty of the gospel and the word of god and what god does is even when they're rejected their love presses on look what she did for her family and she made them promise and she hung that scarlet thread out and they went down on that line and they said just let this scarlet thread show and you and your house will be saved and there's been a scarlet thread all through scripture whether it be righteous or unrighteous but here she is the harlot and then paul goes on to say and i want to read these real fast uh and you excuse me for reading so much scripture and what shall we what shall i say more then and time would fail me to tell of gideon and a barack and of samson and of japheth and of david also and of samuel and the prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouths of lion quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong waxed valiant and fight turned the flight of the armies of the aliens women received their dead race to life again and others were tortured not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection and others had trials of cruel mockings and scourging jay more over bonds and imprisonment they were stoned they were sawn asunder they temp they were tempted and they were slain with the sword and they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins being destitute and afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and in caves of the earth and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise god having provided some better thing for us that we without that we that they without us should not be made complete or perfect so it looks like they did all the suffering they went through all the trials they went through the mockings and the persecutions and somehow we flowed in because we got the revelation i don't think so i think that every christian is going to bear the reproach of jesus christ in their life the word of god is going to bring a reproach in your life your faith in god is going to be reproached it's going to be reproached with by intellect it's going to be reproached by reason it's going to be reproached by common sense every vow and and promise you make to god in every devotion of love and consecration you make to him will be sorely tested should i float to heaven on a bed of ease when others sailed through bloody seas no no chapter 12 paul gives a pretty stern rebuke and he said hey you have not yet resisted the blood you're going to bear chastening but he says hold fast your profession that has great recompense of reward not someone else's profession you ever talk to somebody and they say we believe we believe this is what we believe you're thinking you and who i remember brother branham he asked some so there was some theologian or something and said well we believe and he said well it's certainly not you and god because that's not god's word so well we don't know who this we is but i believe that god his desire is that you have a profession that you hold past your profession and your profession what you profess as a christian as a believer god already said it you're not making it up as you go god sent his word and you recognize that and you said yes i believe that jesus said no man cometh on the unto the father except by me is very absolute and very unpopular in this day and age that we live but you say amen and then what he said becomes your profession or you confess that that's true that's your profession or your confession not someone else's yours and as you live that out that may not be as pretty as you want it to be but as long as it's lived through a true heart so there's certain necessities and realities that we desire things to look better we desire things to be cleaner clearer cut you know kind of a a faultless rendition and we always kind of feeling like man let me let me try that again let me do that again give me another opportunity lord and i'll do better and we do we do do better praise god aren't you thankful for that but sometimes we desire things that god's got a greater order than what we're longing for we're longing for order we're we're longing for rightness i would say righteousness but it just seems like a big word but but you can hear people around you saying you know well i just want it to be done right you know why don't they just do right you know as if as if it's as easy as learning how to throw the darts in the center you know and one person figures out how to do it and i was with some guys doing the arrows you know and the other guys are they're all over the hay bag hay bale you know and this one brother he's just you know he's messing up his arrows shooting them so close together you know so so we sometimes in our thinking we think well you know how come they can't get it right you know all i want is things done right and i just want to be right with god and i want everybody else please to be right with god also hello and we struggle within ourselves but god's got such a greater picture going on i brought my little grandson a rock tumbler he's all excited about it you're not trying to be funny i'm just trying to give a little comic relief that we could rest a little while but he's all excited about the rock tumbler his mother is not because the settings on the rock tumbler are not hours or minutes it stays you set it for five days on this speed with this grid in there and the rocks tumble and they got a tumble in there for five days so they're trying to think of a place in the house they can tolerate this you know rubbing and grinding and you know going on i think you get the picture being polished where god's great gems being polished the way he wants to do it don't miss this revelation brother branham says let's let's try to go up a little bit watch god then what did he tell adam and eve go and multiply and replenish the earth scatter the human race all over the earth so he could deal with them individually till he could bring them back together dealing with the people individuals each one person but they didn't want it that way don't miss this revelation god let it happen may you see it in the way i'm looking at it see it wasn't that god don't deal with a person in a group god don't deal with you in an organization he deals with you as an individual an individual individually we are baptized with the holy ghost collectively we are baptized into the body when we are baptized with the holy ghost individually each one baptized with the holy ghost god dealing with each one that was his purpose scatter them across the earth so he could deal individually with them look at paul when jesus dealt with paul where did he go do you head to jerusalem say hey guys this is what happened yeah you approve disapprove what do you think no he went to the wilderness and he looked to the word of god he had an experience with god and he wanted to see if his experience matched the word of god isn't that what we all did god come and work to work in our life that we did not understand it was such a marvelous thing and we were changed and our heart was changed and as we began to hear the gospel we heard new terminology and new things and we said god is this what that is is this that and then the enemy comes and tries to accuse you and say well you don't even know but prophet of god said if this isn't that i'm going to keep this until that comes so we we we long for things that sometimes god has such a greater picture and i like to just kind of close this morning by taking one of these characters that paul mentioned and going back to our scripture that we opened with this morning in judges japeth and japheth was a son of gilead not the gilead formally and judges apparently another man named gilead and in judges 11 it says now japeth the gilean was a mighty man of valor and he was the son of an harlot and gilead begot japheth and gilead's wife bare him sons and his wife's sons grew up and they thrust out japeth and said unto him thou shalt not inherit our father's house for thou art the son of a strange woman then jabeth fled from his brethren and dwelt in the land of tobe and there were gathered vain men to japheth and went out with him now you get this idea that okay this man is a mighty man of valor but you already judged him because he was the son of a harlot and you think well you know he's probably tough dude you know don't mess with him and you get a certain picture that because it said that he was son of a harlot and his own brothers who were also sons of his own dad they didn't want him around and they sent him off but when israel got in trouble and they had to fight the amorites or the sons the children of ammon lo and behold they call for japeth because they knew somebody they had that they needed somebody on the scene who had something now the scripture don't give us the details of this but it does say that the elders they called for him and they knew that they had this war against the sons of ammon and and they knew they were outnumbered and and and the greater army than they could face and they needed somebody somebody like japheth maybe who wasn't afraid maybe who had courage maybe maybe who was a fighter i you know it didn't look too pretty he was the son of a harlot but he's named in the book of hebrews as a hero of faith paul's saying we are encompassed with such a great cloud of witnesses these are the kind of men these are the kind of people these women he names women and men both that these are this is the stalk that we are of these are the fighters of faith if you're gonna be in this thing you're gonna have to yield your sword like these guys did the sword in this oneness message we won't read the quote but brother brahm says the sword's completely powerless or mute or or uneffective unless it's in the hand of faith and that sword is only if you could only cut out a little bit and say well by god's grace i'm saved that's a big cut that's a big cut your hand was strong enough to cut out that much but in a strong hand of faith take that same sword it's plenty sharp it'll cut but it just takes the force of the hand of faith to make the cut but it will do it you just got to put enough pressure on that sword you just got to yield that sword and it'll cut out every promise of god it just depends on the arm that that that that sword's in so they called for japheth and he said you know you you rejected me you sent me out you you separated me from my own house and you know that word about god's children being separated it's always how god deals with his children he separates you out he always somehow you say well i wasn't separated from my family or you know i didn't have that condition but god always has a way to take you aside and separate you and talk to you and then you know that down in your heart and somehow japheth had this confidence down in him i don't know it doesn't say anything about him praying it doesn't say all these details of his life but i tell you what he had enough courage to go back he didn't stay out there and say oh you fight your own battles guys you know i'm out here you rejected me and and this thing's over no he had the courage to walk back there and face the very people that rejected him and say okay you're in trouble now are you going to make me leader and they said yeah we have to we need you they said all right let's go let's go talk to the enemy now what's amazing when he goes and talks to the enemy this is not a man that's oblivious of the word of god he's not some hooligan some wild guy some you know as we would say the son of a harlot and he's been gone from town and we don't know where he was and these vain guys hooked up with them and we heard that he goes out and i i assume goes out and beats up on amorites and hittites and whatever and gets their spoil but when he talks to the ammonites he goes back in 300 years of history if i if i did my math right and you that are really astute and academic you can test me out on that but he brings them back to where they first came into the land and he said you guys want a war with us but you know when we came through the land and we wanted to pass through peacefully and we said we won't eat no grass we won't even drink your water if you just let us go down the king's highway we'll just pass through your land we won't cause you no trouble and the ammonites the children of ammon they said nothing doing you're not passing through our land and they amassed themselves against the children of israel on their way to their promise and god was with the children of israel and beat the fire out of them beat them down beat every city beat kill them all and took their land and japheth rehearses all this history to them and says so you see you want to take this land and say that it's yours but that's not the story that's not the history and i was just amazed at this man because when jesus came to the well and told that woman you know call your husband and she said i have no husband and jesus said you say well because you've had five husbands and the one you're with now is not your husband she had enough knowledge now her life looked like a wreck but she had something down in her heart she had the word of god in there she knew the word of god and she believed it because she said when the messiah comes he'll do this thing and jesus says he that speaketh to you that's me and she dropped her water apart she went into the city the truth so overwhelmed her past to her oh hallelujah what a thought of that she was so thrilled that the messiah was there she had so much faith in him and who he was because she knew down in her heart when the messiah comes things are going to be different and she had that knowledge down in her heart and when she spoke to jesus all of her past all of her messiness all of her brokenness all of her insignificance and in in in failures and and shame and all this disgusting life of hers it didn't matter what mattered was the truth and she said come and see a man is not this the very messiah what else could she do she had a revelation so we're not trying to go all morning all day today if god help us we'll move to a close so japheth he goes forth to meet the ammonites and verse 29 says then the spirit of the lord came upon japheth and he passed over gilead and manasseh and passed over miss buff and gilead and from mispath of gilead he passed over unto the children of ammon so the spirit of the lord was on him and he's going out after these guys something that god did for him is now moving him in his course of action without dread or fear this spirit of the lord that was in japheth is moving him to encounter his foes and in verse 30 and japeth vowed a vow unto the lord and said if thou shalt without fail deliver the children of ammon into mine hands then it shall be that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me when i return in peace from the children of ammon shall surely be the lords and i will offer it up for a burnt offering so jacob passed over unto the children of ammon to fight against them and the lord delivered them into his hand now japheth was in no way obligated to make this vow and by his own testimony you can read it there that he told those children of ammon we're in the right god is with us and this is i'm in the right cause and you are not and we're gonna let the lord decide between ye and us what's right here so he wasn't making any deals with the lord he wasn't making any bargains the he presented his case to the children ramen he said we're going to come and fight this battle in the name of the lord i've given you opportunity to forsake this foolish thing that you're doing i've given you the history i've told you what the will of god was and and now we are coming what moved on japheth to make this vow before the lord but he did so japeth smote all of the ammonites city after city he made this great conquest and he came back in victory and as we read and we'll read again and joseph came to mispa unto his house and behold his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances and she was his only child besides her he had neither son or daughter what a beautiful sight that was for a father to see his daughter after he'd gone through this big ugly battle and and and you can well imagine how ugly that war was and he comes back to his house in peace all of that violence and ugliness has passed and out comes his beloved daughter dancing with timbrels how precious that must have been in his sight what a beautiful thing what a beautiful thing and it came to pass when he saw her that he rent his clothes and it doesn't say that he wailed but we were at the funeral of a infant child and it was time to close the casket and the mother wailed and i could relate to that something down in my soul said it's it's only right and good that this congregation of people would hear that mother whale and he said alas my daughter thou has brought me very low and thou art one of them that trouble me for i have opened my mouth unto the lord and i cannot go back every born-again christian who's come in the presence of the lord jesus if you've really experienced the new birth you made a vow it may have been an unspoken vow but your own spirit and your own heart is a witness that you said to him lord i believe you i trust you i'm going with you i'm going with you all the way you every believer has had to have their gethsemane where they surrendered their own will and said not my will but thine be done you say was that a vow yes it's a vow your heart made with him and you have a witness that speaks to you your heart speaks to you and says you know you made that vow you know that you've been in that intimate place with the savior where you consecrated yourself to him you recognize that he gave himself for you and you reciprocated and said lord i surrender all it was a vow and it's a vow that has stayed in your life that no matter how much falling down there's been and no matter how much questioning there's been this has abided in your life this sacred vow between you and your savior and you have opened your mouth unto the lord you made your profession you made your confession but you could do nothing else because it was god moving in you it's a mysterious thing perhaps your spouse don't understand your family your friends whoever it might be someone else in the church don't understand what god's doing in your heart but you made your vow and for every believer we find ourselves in this place that japeth said i have opened my mouth unto the lord i cannot go back i don't know what voice it is who it is that's demanding that this be more pretty more beautiful more romantic more perfect more eloquent whatever that the enemy is demanding out of your life you can only say that this is the way it is i cannot go back i of necessity i don't have any other place to go i can't do anything else but fight this fight of faith you don't understand who i am i cannot go back oh and how beautiful and how beautiful was this daughter and she said unto him my father thou has opened thy mouth unto the lord she knew she understood it's the respect every believer has for their brother and sister that this working of god in you is a sacred thing i'm not gonna meddle i'm not gonna cast my opinion i'm not going to have my say can you imagine if japeth had come to town and said well you know i want a great victory for you guys and then i made this promise to the lord what do you think you think i should keep it oh they say oh no no no no japeth you know you don't you don't want to you don't want to do that but his daughter understood and she said do unto me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth for as much as the lord hath taken vengeance for thee of thine enemy even of the children of amith and she said unto her father let this thing be done for me let me alone two months that i may go up and down the mountains and bewail my virginity i and my fellows excuse me she doesn't know why what was going on between god and her dad but she had such a devout respect for it and such a fear of god and and and and just a young lady it appears that she must have been of teenage you know to be let go for a period of time and just go into the mountains and so probably a young lady and she said let me lament what could have been there's just a lot of human sadness in life their sorrow and hearty and god allows it but she said just give me time to lament that i'm not going to partake of the things in this life that every young girl would because of this thou let me go and lament these things and you might have said well you know dad would have maybe sat her down and said well you know job spoke of a resurrection and you know this isn't you know you're just going to cross over to a better life you know maybe somebody would have said well sit her down and explain but no our father said let her lament and there is sadness in life and we do recognize we recognize the big picture that god's got a greater plan but we also recognize suffering and our brothers and sisters and the heartache and we we don't shield ourselves from it we don't step away from it we don't try to fix it we just have a heart broken reverence for the sovereignty of god and deep down knowing that he's good he's good all the time god bless you this morning let's stand together maybe we could sing a song together just whatever you have on your heart have you purposed in your heart that you're not going back is that your vow i don't know where you're going to bring me lord i don't know what sadness might visit my house i don't know what trial that you'll bring me through but only hide me in you lord hide me in the rock whatever storm will come i'm yours lord i'm that individual that you wanted fellowship with let's bow our heads lord i am that child that you love that you promised that you go away to prepare a place that where you are we may be also lord and we hold that ever before us lord the prize but lord we have just a little time on earth to show our love and appreciation to you to be valiant and fight lord to be strong to to wrestle to fight to take our sword of faith and chop us through a jungle into those courts of splendor into your presence lord into the real truths of your word that you'll not lose a one how precious it is lord to know that you've gone before us to make a way for us lord not into a sanctuary made by man's hands but into the very presence of god we accept these things lord that's our profession that we believe we believe in you with all our heart and
