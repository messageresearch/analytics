Kings and second Kings in 1 and 2 Chronicles uh you talk about some of the most interesting stories in the entire book they're in here and wow are they just absolutely incredible and really deep like you can really apply a lot of these things to your own life um first uh announcements is like I sent out on WhatsApp brother Isaac osario and Jerusalem Tabernacle there having their anniversary meetings they will start on Friday it would be Friday Saturday and Sunday morning and then uh brother Doug Baker is having meetings I believe they start tonight and they will be going through Sunday evening so um we will uh cancel probably if the Lord's willing we'll cancel our service on Sunday evening so we can all go over to brother Doug Baker's church and fellowship with them there uh for the close of those meetings so um I know that both brother sario and brother Baker I don't know brother Baker very well I think I've only met him one time but I know that I would appreciate it if people came to our meetings and just filled up the seats so if you uh if you could it would be nice to visit um to visit them Katrina it's good to see you you're a yeah good this is our neighbor right here Katrina next I have where are you going oh yeah he does well the Lord will provide like you said amen so we um to get into this book of First Kings we see first and second Samuel 1 and 2 Kings they kind of they go in order uh first and second Kings like first and 2 Samuel it was probably written as one book and then separated because of the length so we see in 1 Samuel we see the rise of the kings in Israel we see the this this man saw that Rose to power and he was King over Israel for 40 years now when we say Israel let me go back a little bit when we say Israel it's this country that's really named after this man named Jacob so Jacob was he was he was Isaac's son who was Abraham's son so we have Abraham God made the promise remember he said that that your seed is going to be like the Sands and the stars of the sky so so Abraham comes and he has his promised son Isaac then Isaac has Jacob Jacob has 12 sons and God changes Jacob's name to Israel and we see now his TW sons are the children of Israel and that's how we we talk about the children of Israel and that because it's actually Israel's Israel's Sons so we have these these 12 tribes they want a king we know this story from uh the book of Samuel they want a king so God provides this man named Saul This Tall good-looking guy well spoken he was everything that anybody would ever want in a king except he really didn't have the character that he should have so he reigns for 40 years and then this young man named David who has all the character you could ever put into a human being he then ascends to the throne he's anointed to be king by the prophet Samuel he ascends to the throne and he reigns for 40 years so we have 40 years with Saul we have 40 years with David and now we're going to get in when we start in First Kings we're going to see that David is old and stricken in years can you guess how old he was he was old and stricken in he was 70 he had a hard life David did he Aaron's laughing he he he was he was like 140 years packed into 70 years with David he he really struggled and he he was a man of war he had a lot of battles and and um he he gets he gets old and and his time is short so we see David and he's his life is fading so his oldest remaining son which is this guy named adonijah adonijah um sees that that David's getting old and he starts preparing to be king because really if you look at it he's probably the rightful Heir because he's the oldest so we see that that's how the book of first king starts it goes through really some some amazing times we have the the you're going to have Solomon come and then you're going to have have Solomon's son rabam he's going to Reign and then he's going to just everything's going to be a train wreck under him so the the the um kingdom is going to split it's going to be it's going to split into 10 tribes in the north and two tribes in the South uh the book of first king covers um I think about uh eight Kings of Israel in the north and Four Kings of Israel in the South and if you're ever playing Ria or you're talking about Kings Israel after Solomon never had a good King every single one of them was evil now Judah after it split again we have Israel and Judah now Judah did have a few good Kings not many but it did have a few so in First Kings we're going to cover jeroboam who um was the man that took over the North naab basa Ela zimra omry and Ahab and aesia a little bit at the end so those are the ones those are the kings that we're going to talk about I'm not going to mention them all because we don't have enough time but those are the the kings that the the first king covers for for the North and then the South we have rabam which is Solomon's son abijah ASA and Jehoshaphat now two of these Kings of Judah did right in the eyes of the Lord that's ASA and Jehoshaphat very very very important too in this first book of Kings is we see the first temple built the first temple of God so if you're talking to a scholar you'll hear well that was the first temple period and this is the second temple period well this first temple period is what is going to start right here in the book of first king Kings and that's when the first temple is built um another thing that we see in this book of Kings is we see the rise of these mysterious men called prophets and usually we we saw this prophet Samuel arise right at the end of the Book of Judges there some say he was the last judge a Great and Mighty prophet in the Lord and he started a trend really that we see these men rise up and many times we don't know where they came from we don't know how they were raised they just show up and then they a lot of times they just disappear we don't even see their death so we have after Samuel we have this man named Nathan who we'll talk about in First Kings and then it goes on and these prophets that rise up we have the kings that have all this power and all of this might as far as the armies and they have all this wealth wealth and then we have these single men of God that show up and they are awesome they come in and they can just bring the whole country to its knees and they they'll just and you'll see with Elijah that comes on the scene they are the ones that really wield the power because they're hearing from Jehovah so the book of Kings we have the death of David again I said David was well stricken in years and he was 70 cousin Jonathan good to see you back there too my friend God bless you we see David he was well stricken in years 70 years old and his son adonijah as I said he sees his dad getting old so he's really the oldest so he figures that I'm going to be king so he starts making arrangements ments to take over the kingship so he has these 50 men they run before him and he's on this mule and they they they go through all the pump and he's got the men of God here and the men of War there and they're going to anoint this adonijah king and the only thing is he doesn't invite a couple people to the party he doesn't invite his dad David he doesn't invite his little brother Solomon and he doesn't invite the prophet Nathan so he's gonna have so so right there you can see he's probably scheming a little bit so the word gets back to Nathan the prophet hey adonijah is about to Crown himself King so then Nathan tells baath Sheba and bath Sheba has the the king's ear his wife so she goes and tells David and she says hey she says well she approaches him reverently but she says you said that Solomon was going to be king now brother L we don't have that yet but that's mentioned over in the next couple books in Chronicles that they they quote that so in First Kings it comes first and you kind of read that it's like well where did he promise this but it is promised and it's that promise comes in the book of um I I believe it's 1 Chronicles so so David what David does is he said okay well let's have our own ceremony so David and David is the King David Gets Nathan the prophet and he gets some of the other priests and and he gets the powerful men and they bring um Solomon and he gets gets to ride on David's mule and they anoint Solomon King so adonijah he sees this he gets somebody comes and tells him this and he's like oh man I messed up because back then there's no Grace you were dead when you when you did when you did that type of thing so adonijah he he's he says well you know this is this is this is really bad what I've done so now we have Solomon the king and adonijah fears what what was going to happen and we can start reading in First Kings chapter 1 verse 50 brother Jeremy we can start right there so adonijah feared because of Solomon and arose and went and caught hold on the horns of the Altar and and it was told Solomon saying behold adonijah fearth the King fearth King Solomon for Lo he hath caught a hold on the of the horns of the altar saying let King Solomon swear unto me today that he will not slay his servant with the sword so Solomon said if he will show himself a worthy man there shall not a hair of him fall to the Earth but if wickedness shall be found in him he shall die so King Solomon sent and they brought him down from the Altar and he came and bowed himself to King Solomon and Solomon said unto him go to your house so we think he's safe here but later on adonijah makes another move that was interpreted by Solomon as a threat to his throne and adonijah Solomon wasn't as kind then that was the end of adonijah that happens later on so as this kingdom is is continuing David who was very very wise David sees that his son is Young Solomon was probably about 20 years old from all that I could gather maybe between 20 and 24 so Solomon's pretty young he doesn't have a whole lot of experience in doing these things so what David does is David brings Solomon down and he starts giving him some instructions on what to do and something very strange happens brother Josiah what he does is he said okay here's here's the people that you need to kill so they start with these political assassinations and the best that I could see were some of these the these people that that David tells him to kill David being the strong man that he was and the strong leader he could handle these people but with the young man Solomon he might not have been able to handle this and he may have lost the Kingdom so he gives some instructions on who to kill one of those was David's General this ruthless man who was very powerful very shrewd and a very very great warrior the one who killed David's son absum this man named joab he tells he tells Solomon he says kill him he says this he says don't let his head stay stay on his shoulders or something like that that means his gray hair by the way it sounds like something different but it's basically it's basically the gray hair so he he takes joab and joab gets put out of his misery and then there's this other guy this this guy David do you remember when David was kicked out of Jerusalem by his own son absum so David leaves and he's fleeing for his life leaves Jerusalem and he's going along and there's this man this cranky guy named shimi and shimi starts starts basically berading David because of Saul how King Saul had died and he's blaming David for this and he's like throwing rocks at David and David's men like you're not doing that to my king pulls out his sword and he says I'm not going to let his head stay on his shoulders David's like whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa he's like listen God told him to do that so just let him alone so now David's on his now that happened years and years ago David's on on his deathbed and he's like oh yeah take out that shimi guy too but shimi was a schemer too and he had issues and he would have probably also been a problem for Solomon so when we get to chapter three now Solomon is King and he immediately begins making mistakes so let's turn to First Kings chapter 3 verse 1 brother Jeremy I didn't give him a list of um scriptures so he's going to be trying to follow with me um so it won't be quite as fast as it usually is for so First Kings chapter 3:1 and Solomon made an affinity now Affinity is just a treaty or an alliance with Pharaoh king of Egypt now David's gone David had passed away with Pharaoh king of Egypt and took Pharaoh's daughter and brought her into the city of David until he had made an end of building his own house and the house of the Lord and the wall of Jerusalem round about so immediately Solomon starts running around with these worldly girls and we see that that's his problem for his whole life especially as he gets older now Solomon Reigns really this is the greatest time in the history of Israel they have tremendous wealth they have great armies and really nobody's messing with Israel right now because they are such a powerful nation and we see that Solomon when he comes in he starts when he starts making these mistakes and if you haven't learned anything from our Bible study from Genesis now until first Kings you see that all of these Great Men of God make mistakes every single one of them they all of them fail and so often we try to put this this Perfection on to these brothers and you can't do it because no one in the Bible was ever perfect except for one the Bible is very careful to record mistakes in all of the Servants of God I remember I told a brother that one time and he about came over the table at me saying you did not these prophets never make mistakes I was like brother it's just written in here I'm sorry I can't change the Bible it's right here it's not that you're in saying that you're not lessening brother you're not lessening their influence or lessening these these people they are real genuine men of God that have flaws but then God can use them to me it makes it just beautiful it makes it to where they're great examples to me because I look at all my failures and all of my weaknesses and then yet I can still be a man of God and Solomon was one he had weaknesses but he also had some very very good strengths verse number verse number two only the people sacrificed in high places because there was no h house built un until the name unto the name of the Lord until those days and Solomon loved the Lord see that's what separates him Solomon Lov the Lord and even in his mistakes he still put the people first Solomon loved the Lord walking in the statutes of David his father only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places so immediately we see this weakness of idolatry creeping up and we found out later that this idolatry in Solomon comes from these women that he's marrying he had a thousand wives by the way I don't know how he did that um so he worshiped in these high places but soon Solomon's going to get a higher Revelation and he's going to make a change watch this and the King went to gibian to sacrifice there for that was the great high place a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar in gibian the Lord appeared to Solomon in a Dream by night and God said ask what I shall give thee love this part and Solomon said thou has showed unto thy servant David my father great Mercy according as he walked before thee in truth and in righteousness and in upright ESS of heart with thee and thou has kept him this great kindness that thou has given him a son to sit on his throne as it is this day so Solomon saying listen dad's so proud that I'm I'm the king now so thank you Lord for doing this for my dad I know it was really important to him and now oh Lord my God thou Hast made thy servant King instead of David my father and I am but a little child I know not how to go in how to go out or come in and thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou H has chosen a great people that cannot be numbered nor counted for the multitude give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people look at the love and the burden for his people manifested in Solomon what a beautiful thing that he just said that I might discern between good and bad for who is able to judge this thy so great people and the speech pleased the Lord that Solomon asked this thing and God said unto him because thou Hast asked this thing and H has not asked for a long life excuse me and has not asked for a long life neither H has asked for riches for thyself neither nor H has asked the life of thine enemies but has asked for thy self understanding to discern judgment behold I have done according to thy words lo I have given thee a wise and understanding heart God speaking to Solomon so that there was none like thee before thee neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee look at the wisdom that this man's going to get we always hear about the wisdom of Solomon well here is where it comes from right here and I have also given thee that which thou H has not asked both riches and honor so that there shall not be any among the Kings like unto thee all thy days and if thou wil walk in my ways to keep my statutes and my Commandments as thy father David did walk then I will lengthen thy days so Solomon wakes up from this dream and went to Jerusalem now and stood before the Ark of the Covenant and offered up offerings before the Lord do you see how this changed him notice that when he had the dream it shook him up and he went back to the proper ER place of worshiping so now that Solomon has this wisdom that God has given him now all of a sudden in the Bible we see this wisdom tested so there's these two prostitutes that come to Solon they got a dead baby and they got a alive baby and they come before the king and the one says this woman over here she laid down and rolled over and smothered her baby so she gets up in the middle of the night she takes this dead baby and she puts it in in the bed where my baby was and takes my live baby and puts it in her bed and now she's got my son and I have her dead baby and the other woman says no no no no that's wrong her she smothered her baby and she just now wants my baby because she wants to have a child so Solomon's looking there and he sees these two women and he sees the one live baby and the one dead baby and he says okay he says let's do this he said soldier come here take your sword cut the baby in half give half to this one half to that one the one that the mother of the baby falls down and says no no no no no no no don't do it give it to the other one the one that was lying said that's good and in her heart I was like yeah now we both have I don't have to be jealous we'll both have our dead babies but the one that loved the child said no give it to the other one Solomon then in chapter 3: 27 Solomon says this then the king answered and said give her the living child and in no wise slay it she is the mother thereof and all Israel heard of the Judgment which the king had judged and they feared the king for they saw that the wisdom of of God was in him to do judgment and then the fame of Solomon Solomon's wisdom just went out and it came and people started coming from different countries and from all over just to hear this wisdom of Solomon and this time in Israel was just a great time of peace and prosperity and the Bible shows that how much gold they had and how much silver and how how much wealth that they had and how many chariots and and all of the armies and there was no fighting it was a wonderful time so Solomon he must have looked around and he was just probably thankful to think about what his dad David had gone through there was no fighting his kids weren't rising up against each other this was a good time then Solomon remembers the instructions his father David had given him to build this Temple to Worship the Lord so Solomon begins construction on the temple of God and the Bible goes into great detail of the building of both the temple and Solomon's own house in um chapter 6: 11 speaking of the temple God tells Solomon this and the word of the Lord came to solom saying concerning this house which Thou Art building if thou will walk in my statutes and execute my judgments and keep my Commandments to walk in them then will I perform my word with thee which I spake unto David thy father and I will dwell among the children of Israel and will not forsake the people so Solomon built the house the temple and finished it and even in these few verses this type of statement is repeated over and over in the Old Testament if you will keep my Commandments and you will walk in them then I will bless you over from the Book of Judges we see and we see in 1 Samuel 2 Samuel we see now in in Kings and we see that same Spirit upon the Lord Jesus a couple thousand years later over well over a thousand years later Jesus says if you love me keep my commandments so look at the similarity in Christ and Jehovah of the Old Testament they are exactly the same yes so in chapter 8 Solomon gets all the people together so they finish the temple Solomon gets all the people and by the way it's very very detailed even even Solomon's own personal house talks about all the the the different designs and all that that are in there so Solomon gets all the people together to dedicate the temple and he spreads out his arms and he starts to pray to the Lord and he asks blessings upon himself and upon the people please read chapter 28 when you have time it's it's all mostly um Solomon's Prayer chapter 8 but I'll start in verse 33 and a he asks as he's praying he says this about the temple chapter 8 verse 33 when thy People Israel be smitten down before the enemy because they have sinned against thee and shall turn again to thee and confess thy name and pray and make supplication unto thee in this house then hear thou in heaven and forgive the sin of thy People Israel and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest un their fathers When Heaven is shut up and there's no rain because they have sinned against thee if they pray just pray towards this place if they pray towards this place and confess thy name and turn from their sin when thou Afflicted them then hear thou in heaven and forgive the sin of thy servants and of thy People Israel that thou teach them the good way wherein they should walk and give rain upon the land which thou Hast given to thy people for an inheritance if there be in the land famine if there be pestilence blasting mildew Locust or caterpillar if there be in if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities whatsoever plague whatsoever sickness there be what prayer and supplication soever be made by any man or by all thy People Israel which shall know every man the plague of his own heart and spread forth his hands towards this house then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place and forgive and do and give to every man according to his ways whose heart thou knowest for thou even thou only knowest the heart of all the children of men that they may fear thee all the days that they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers he goes on to pray that if they're far away and they just face towards this Temple when they are praying that the Lord will hear them then Solomon finishes PR his prayer and it doesn't say this in First Kings but it does in 2 Chronicles chapter 7 that the fire and the glory of the Lord comes down and consumes the offering that was in the temple at that time as I said this is a great time to be a Jew it is just a tremendously prosperous prosperous time so Solomon his W his wisdom continues to spread the Queen of Sheba brings great wealth to make an offering to Solomon and he gives her all the answers to every question that she had on her heart and then we see in chapter 11 that all that leads up to chapter 11 we see a shift let's go to chapter 11 verse one but King Solomon loved many strange women together with the daughter of pharaoh that was the one that we talked about before that he married women of of the moabites ammonites zidonians and Hittites of the Nations concerning which the Lord said unto the children of Israel you shall not go into them he had for God had forbidden this neither th shall they come unto you for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods Solomon clave unto these in in love so it this is exactly what happens God told him don't he told all the people don't go to these Canaan night because your hearts will be turned from God to idols and it's exactly what happens to Solomon and he had 700 wives princesses and 300 concubines and his wives turned away his heart for it came to pass when Solomon was old that his wife wives turned away his heart after other gods and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God as was the heart of David his father for Solomon went after Ash Sho the goddess of the zidonians and now after milom the abomination of the Hill that is before Jerusalem and from moik the abomination of the children of Ammon and likewise did he for all his strange wives which burnt incense and sacrifice under their gods and the Lord was very was angry with Solomon because his heart was turned from the Lord God of Israel which had appeared unto him twice and had commanded him concerning this thing that he should not go after other gods but he kept not that which the Lord commanded he didn't remember he didn't keep which what the Lord told him he didn't hold it dear to his heart wherefore the Lord said unto Solomon for as much as this is done of thee and thou Hast not kept my Covenant and my statutes which I have commanded Thee I will surely Ren the Kingdom from me I'll take it from you and I will give it to your servant not withstanding in thy days I will not do it for David thy father's sake but I will Rend it out of the hand of thy son very very important thing that the Lord just told him and we think about being a dad being a mom how important is it that we live a holy life look at how Solomon benefited from his father David this man of impeccable character and how he was a man after God's own heart and David did his best all the time to do what God had commanded him and now David's son Solomon God says I would take it from you but because of your dad I'm not going to take it from you you're going to live out your life as king and your son is going to be the one that loses the Kingdom so as I said this chapter 11 is a transition from the book transition from Solomon to now we're going to have many other kings Solomon really he was an enigma to me he wasn't really it's like he wasn't really good with the women because he had really bad bad uh discernment as far as the girls but then he goes and he writes The Book of Proverbs and he writes Song of Solomon where it's warning about this Venom that is in these women and how dangerous they are and here's PR prbs talking about how to be a good dad and how to be a good parent and and to stay away from these girls and then Solomon it's like but you didn't do it here but the anointing I assume I know was on solom and as he was writing those things and it just shows that he was a human but his heart I really believe all the way until the end Solomon's heart was right he just he made a mistake and he got off so now we see these two men rise to power we have Solomon's son rabo and he inherits the kingdom Solomon dies and now reabo inherits the Kingdom so he starts ruling and the people of Israel remember it's all one country it's kind of like brother brandom said that the um Israel types the United States well if you look at Israel it's like here's 12 States all together you look at the United States it started with 13 states all together everyone just working together and we see rabam and rabam is going to he gets this group of people and this this other man who's a great warrior named jeroboam he comes with the people they come to to reabo and they say hey can you give us a break on the taxes it's killing us we need a tax cut and so rabam says okay well let me think about it for a few days and then then I'll get back to you so rabam goes to the ones that were with Solomon his dad and he asks them he says hey they want a tax cut what should I do and these seasoned wise advisor say give it to them deal gently with them deal more gently than your dad did and then ri's like okay so then riabal goes to his friends that he had promoted that he grew up with and he says how about what do you think should should we should I give a tax cut or should I put more taxes on him so then his buddies who don't have the experience they told him to be harder on the people collect more taxes for them assert your assert your authority over them harshly then they tell him say this my father laid you with a heavy yoke and I will add to your yoke my father has chastised you with whips but I will chastise you with scorpions how would you like that got this new leader and sometimes I'll bring it right down here sometimes we can apply it to ourselves I've heard Hey Brother green wasn't hard enough on the church you need to close up the fellowship hall you need to get rid of these unbelievers you need to enforce this dress code tell these women their Jey bells and get rid of these unbelievers that didn't work before and it doesn't work now and you see why the kingdom was divided you know you see there it's like huh Solomon had word from the Lord this is how you do this or David had word from the Lord this is how you do it and this he provided good leadership this man riab boam had very very bad leadership bad he didn't understand First Kings 12 1212 says this so jeroboam and all the people came to rabam the third day as the king had appointed saying come to me again the third day and the King answered the people roughly and forsook the old men's counsel that they gave him and spake to them after the counsil of the young men saying my father made your yoke heavy and I will add to your yoke my my father also chastised you with whips but I will chastise you with scorpions wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people for the cause was from the Lord that they might perform this saying which the Lord spake by aijah the the shilonite unto jeroboam the son of nebat it's referring back to a prophecy this man ahijah had made before so when all Israel saw that the king had hearkened not unto them the people answered the king saying what portion have we in David neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse to your tents o Israel now see to thine own house David So Israel departed unto their tents so David was from the tribe of Judah as was rabam obviously because he was the grandson of David and soon after jeroboam was anointed king of Israel and we see the split because of the foolishness of the leadership in in riab he was too harsh he didn't take into account the suffering of the people so now what does jeroboam do jeroboam makes makes a fool out of himself so what he does is he see these these 10 tribes up in the north so what he does is he says okay well well I don't want them to come down to the temple that Solomon's built because then that we'll put it into not modern perspective then they might start start going to church there and then I won't have them in my church so let's build a couple more temples here we'll build build one way up in the north in Dan and then we'll be build one down here in the middle and then you can go worship there and not go to the temple that God had made do you remember Solomon saying that they would just look to this Temple and messed up all God's plan right there and then what does he do he even puts c a calf in there for them to worship at what a mess he ruined it all and God didn't God didn't take that lightly so then in Chapter 13 very interesting story happens so after jeroboam builds these two these two temples God is going to come down on him so he sends a man of God to jeroboam to prophesy of a king named Josiah that would come and condemn jeroboam's sins so jeroboam hears the prophecy and he reaches out against this man of God and his hand dries up and the altar itself splits in half and King jeroboam cries out for mercy and his hand is restored and the King says hey why don't you jerob says why don't you come home with me and hang out at my house for a while and I'll give you a reward for all this that you've done first Kings chapter 13:8 and the man of God said unto the king if thou will give me half of thine house I will not go in with thee neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place for such for so it was charged me by the word of the Lord saying eat no bread nor drink water nor turn again by the same way that thou camest so he went another way and returned not by the way that he came to bethl so then the man of God meets a prophet and the prophet says to him remember he just got instruction from the Lord don't stop don't go anywhere else go to jobon prophesy and then don't eat or drink don't stay just leave First Kings chap 13:16 says this and he said I may not return with thee nor go in with thee neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place for it was said to me by the word of the Lord Thou shalt eat nor bread nor drink water there nor turn again to go by the way that thou camest and he said unto him I am a prophet also as Thou Art and the angel spake unto me by the word of the Lord saying bring him back with thee into thine house that he may eat bread and drink water but he lied to him so he went back with him and did eat bread in his house and drank water and it came to pass that as they sat at the table that the word of the Lord came unto the prophet that brought him back and he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah saying thus sayeth the Lord for as much as thou has disobeyed the mouth of the Lord and Hast not kept the Commandment which the Lord thy God commanded thee but camest back and Hast eaten bread and drunk water with the place of which the Lord did say to to thee eat no bread and drink no water thy carcass shall not come under the supplier of thy fathers and it and it came to pass after he had eaten bread and after he had drunk that he saddled for him the ass to wit for the prophet whom he had brought back and when he was gone a lion met him by the way and slew him and his carcass was cast in the way and the ass stood by it and the lion also stood by the carcass very very odd story brother Jeremy if you could put that quote up for me brother Bram says this now look speaking of this story that I just read now look some of these this going on around you always seek the face of God and I don't care who tells you anything contrary to what God tells you don't you believe it and you obey God will you do it I don't care who he is how righteous he is how much of a pastor he is how much of a Preacher whether he's a prophet he may be sent of God a real true ordained prophet of God but if God tells you something contrary to that Prophet don't you believe the prophet you believe God how many believe that's true read First Kings 13 a young Prophet went down and prophesied against all bethl there and done some Miracles and the Lord said don't you eat nor drink and come back another way from the way that you went in and a real prophet of God went and deceived that Prophet is that right might as well be truthful he said the angel of the Lord met me and told me to tell you to come to my house house he met me after he met you and the prophet believing that Prophet turned and went back what happened to him a lion killed him is that right the old Prophet wept sore over it sure because he listened to a man instead of God don't heard that hear that tape much or that uh quote much so a couple Kings reign in Judah and and is Israel and and like I said it's all bad in Israel there was there was one king ASA who was a good King in Judah and then we get down back to Israel back to this guy named omry this King and he was the worst yet of the Kings First Kings chapter 16 and I'm going to get to this man Elijah First Kings 16:25 says this but omry rot evil in the eyes of the Lord and did worse than all that were before him for he walked in all the ways of jeroboam the son of nebat and in his sin where with he made Israel to sin to provoke the Lord God of Israel to anger with their vanities now the rest of the acts of Armory which he did and his might that he showed are they not written in the book of The Chronicles of the Kings of Israel so Army slept with his fathers and was buried in Samaria and Ahab his son reigned in his stead and in the 38 year of Asa king of Judah now remember we got two kings going on here we have two different countries going on here and in the 3 and8th year of Asa king of Judah began Ahab the son of omry to Reign Over Israel and Ahab the son of Amry reigned over Israel in Samaria 2 and2 years and Ahab the son of omry did evil in the sight of the Lord above all that were before for him and it came to pass as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of jeroboam the sons of nebat that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of eth Bale King of the zodian and went and served Baal and worshiped him so marrying Jezebel and worshiping baale I assume that she was the influence on him that caused him to sin in this way so he reared up altar of Baal and the in the house of Baal which he had built in Samaria and Ahab made a Grove and Ahab did more to provoke the Lord God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him and Ahab and Jezebel they're the worst of all so God raises up one of the greatest prophets remember when Isaiah said when the enemy comes in like a flood that God will raise up a standard against him so a so God raises he has the worst King the most evil king of Israel and then he raises up the greatest Prophet against him so he shows up really out of nowhere we don't know where Elijah came he goes right into ahab's face and he says as the Lord God Lives before whom I stand there shall not be due nor rain these years except for by my word that was bold to say that to the king he calls for this drought then the Lord leads him to the mountains by a creek while he's at that Creek the Ravens bring him food and he has water from the creek and the creek dries up God sends him to a widow woman so she's out she's dying she's starving to death because there's a famine in the land because of this drought that Ahab brought I mean I'm sorry that Elijah had brought so Elijah goes up to this woman and he tells her she's out and she's getting some sticks to go cook this last handful of meal that she has for her son and him and Elijah says bring me a drink so she goes in and she's giving him a drink of water and then he says and bring me some food too and she says I don't have any we just have I just have enough for just to make for this one cake for my son and I and then we're going to die so Elijah says listen now Elijah he knew whatever he touched was blessed he knew that God was with him wouldn't you love to have that walk with the Lord that you know that whatever you touch is blessed whatever that whoever whoever's house that you you go to is blessed because you are such a man of God Elijah had that confidence so he tells her he says listen he says make me one first I don't think that he was putting himself above that widow woman I think that he had a burden for her right so she says Okay and she makes him the cake well then he says because the barrel of meal won't fail the Cru of oil won't fail you'll have it until until the time that you finally get your own food so she makes she makes Elijah that cake then she reaches in that barrel of meal and it's there she takes the oil and it's there and every time that she reached in there every time she poured that oil there was always food there so then her son little baby dies and she goes to Elijah and she says listen now my son's dead and she's carrying him and Elijah Elijah's like give me the baby so Elijah goes in he knows whatever he touches is blessed he takes that baby he lays the baby right on his bed he lays his body on top of the baby and he cries out to the Lord Lord restore this baby then God does Elijah says and the woman she looks at Elijah he brings back this now living baby and the woman says to Elijah now by this I know that thou art a man of God and the word of the Lord in thy mouth is true she could have probably said she probably should have said that every time she stuck her hand in that Barrel but but now she's I guess now she's s sure so then and I'll wrap it up so then Elijah he goes up on Mount Carmel and well he then he he goes and he meets Ahab and he and Ahab says this you know what let's read it first Kings chapter 18:1 17 and it came to pass when Elijah saw when Ahab saw Elijah that Ahab said unto him art thou he that troubleth Israel and he answered I have not troubled Israel but thou and thy father's house and that have forsaken the Commandments of the Lord and thou Hast followed balum now remember balum from numbers remember what he did he taught Israel to marry these Heathen women these Canaanite women and here is Ahab with his Idol worshipping wife Jezebel now therefore send and gather me all Israel under Mount Carmel and the prophets of Baal 450 and the prophets of the Groves 400 which eat at Jezebel's table so Ahab sent un all the children of Israel and gathered the prophets together under Mount Carmel and Elijah came unto all the people and said how long halt ye between two opinions if the Lord be God follow him but if Baal then follow him and the people answered him not a word and Elijah said unto the people I even I only only remain a prophet of the Lord but baal's prophets are 450 men they take the burnt offering he gives one to these prophets he takes the other they prepare the offerings they prepare the altars they these these he says which God will answer by fire is the real God you know the story they cut up the the offering there these these prophets are jumping up and down they're they're doing everything they can they start cutting themselves a sign of idolatry aide of being a heathen they start cutting themselves the blood's coming down they're doing everything that they can and Elijah is sitting there and he's making fun of them and then Elijah comes over here he says pour water on my Sac on my offerings three times they pour water on the water is around the offering and then the fire from God comes and cons assumes Elijah's burnt offering then he runs away again and the straw really it seems like that broke the camel's back in chapter 21 was when Ahab and Jezebel make this final mistake with this man named naboth now AB naboth owned a Vineyard and Ahab wanted his Vineyard so he goes to nabbo and he saysh hey I want to buy your Vineyard nebo's like listen this has been in my family for a long time I can't just I can't just sell this really it's it's a family heirloom so Ahab was used to getting everything that he wants so he's upset about this he goes home and he's he's sulking over this Jezebel comes in and she's like what's wrong with you Ahab says well I want this Vineyard and he won't sell it to me and she's like hey aren't you the king so she writes this letter and sends it to her people and they frame nabbo and say that he was blaspheming now listen this is a religious thing you can see these people are still Jews these people are still following what they think is the laws of God so they end up taking naboth and they Stone him kill him Jezebel says okay you can have your Vineyard now Ahab takes a Vineyard and says this first Kings 2118 arise and go arise and go down this is arise and go down to meet Ahab he's talking God is talking to Elijah his Prophet arise and go down to meet Ahab king of Israel which is in Samaria behold he is in the vineyard of naboth whether he has gone down to possess it possess it and thou shalt speak unto him saying thus sayeth the Lord hast thou killed and also taken possession and thou shalt speak unto him saying thus sayeth the Lord in the place where dogs lick the blood of naboth shall dogs lick thy blood even thine skip to verse 23 and of Jezebel also spake the Lord saying the dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of jezrael him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat and him that dieth in the field the fowls of the air shall eat so then in closing um the musicians can prepare then in closing in chapter 22 Ahab goes to battle and I just ministered on this a few weeks ago Ahab goes to battle he's struck by an arrow and he dies and his blood goes out into this Chariot so remember the prophecy that the dogs were going to lick ahab's blood so now ahab's dead the Chariots here it's full of blood so this guy that that cleans the Chariots he gets some water and he's cleaning out the Chariot the blood is washing out it's pulling on the ground and the dogs come and they start licking up the blood wow to fulfill the prophecy that Elijah had made that this Ahab was going to die and that the dogs were going to lick his blood now and that closes the first book of Kings but it's still leaves the prophecy of Jezebel and it's better that the dogs are going to eat her says that the dogs are going to lick ahab's blood but then the dogs are going to eat Jezebel so brother Lyall you got to tell us what happens in Second Kings and how Jezebel gets consumed and it's a it's pretty rough brothers and sisters the first book of Kings amen is is tremendous go back quickly to what I said about this reabo and how he had made a mistake and was harsh with the people and I also want to say that I believe the Lord led me very specifically when I came to the Tucson Tabernacle be kind don't be harsh don't be condemning and I have received as I just said quite a bit of criticism for that but I'm doing my best and I'm using I'm using the wisdom I believe the Lord has placed in me to do things right and I'm reading this Bible and applying and doing my best to apply into my life let's all stand because I love thee you have G life to me I was [Music] nothing before you found me you have G life to
