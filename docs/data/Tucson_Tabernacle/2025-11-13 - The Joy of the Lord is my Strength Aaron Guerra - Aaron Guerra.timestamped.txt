[10:08] Let's just stand this evening and sing
[10:10] Only Believe. We're going to turn
[10:11] service over brother Daniel for the
[10:12] prayer requests. Then right after that,
[10:14] Sister Hope, if you would sing a song.
[10:17] Only
[10:18] [singing] believe.
[10:22] Only
[10:24] believe.
[10:28] All things are possible. [music]
[10:34] Holy
[10:36] believe.
[10:39] Oh,
[10:46] we believe
[10:50] all things [singing]
[10:52] are possible.
[11:02] Amen.
[11:05] It's a good song. It's a familiar song.
[11:07] We're going to sing that song next
[11:09] Wednesday
[11:11] when um we're going to play the sermon
[11:14] that Brother Brandon preached, not in
[11:16] this building, but it was this church.
[11:19] Building doesn't matter. It's the people
[11:21] that that are the church. And we're
[11:23] going to play that sermon if the Lord is
[11:25] willing next Wednesday night. What house
[11:27] will you build me? preached
[11:30] um 1965
[11:32] November
[11:34] 21st I believe and that would be almost
[11:37] exactly 60 years since he first
[11:40] dedicated this church and I'm looking
[11:42] forward to rededicating it and like I
[11:45] said it's the people not the building
[11:48] and that's the most important thing. few
[11:51] prayer requests.
[11:53] Um Stephanie, my wife, is sick.
[11:58] Josiah, I talked with him. He sounded
[12:00] terrible. Boys, he's sick. He's got a
[12:03] cold. Um Daniel's out tonight. I told
[12:07] him, "Stay home. He um he's just missing
[12:11] sleep and he has a big midterm
[12:14] tomorrow." I was like, "Buddy, just
[12:18] stay there and I'll have the church pray
[12:20] for you." So, you know, Daniel, he never
[12:23] wants to miss, but this came from the
[12:25] pastor and his dad both study
[12:28] study for the test. I don't have any
[12:31] other prayer requests. Uh, brother Ed, I
[12:33] don't think I missed any anymore back
[12:35] there.
[12:37] Um, with the sick that are among us, and
[12:40] I think there's quite a few flu going
[12:42] around. So, um, let's remember all of
[12:46] those also that we don't have prayer
[12:47] requests for. And friends, if you have a
[12:49] prayer request on your heart that you
[12:52] might make it known to the Lord with an
[12:54] uplifted hand.
[12:56] Lord Jesus,
[12:58] we thank you that we can call upon that
[13:00] name
[13:02] knowing that
[13:04] by your stripes, Lord, we were healed.
[13:08] I pray
[13:09] for Stephanie, Father, that you'd heal
[13:12] my wife, that you'd heal her body, for
[13:15] Josiah, Lord, and the sickness that he's
[13:17] he's going through. And Father, the
[13:20] rough schedule that he has this week, I
[13:22] pray that you'd give the young man
[13:24] strength, Father, bless him. May your
[13:26] hand be upon him, Lord, for my son
[13:30] Daniel and the test coming up. Father,
[13:33] we can pray for the we can pray for
[13:35] healing and we can pray for the big
[13:36] things, but also for the little things.
[13:39] And I pray that his mind would be clear.
[13:41] All the work that he's done in studying
[13:43] would be manifested in a good grade. I
[13:45] pray and all these requests that went up
[13:50] before you with an uplifted hand. Lord,
[13:53] we pray that you saw that hand
[13:57] and Lord, now we present them to you. We
[13:59] lay them at your feet in the name of
[14:00] Jesus Christ. Amen. God bless you,
[14:07] &gt;&gt; sister. Now
[14:10] I believe.
[14:14] Now
[14:15] I believe
[14:19] all things [singing] are possible.
[14:25] Now I
[14:27] believe ac capella now.
[14:30] Now
[14:32] I believe.
[14:36] Now
[14:38] I believe
[14:41] all things are possible.
[14:47] Now I believe
[14:52] you may be seated this night.
[15:04] Y'all can sing this with me.
[15:16] There's a land that is fair
[15:20] day.
[15:23] And by faith we can see it.
[15:30] For the father waits over the way
[15:36] to prepare us
[15:40] there.
[15:43] In the sweet
[15:46] by and by

[15:54] shore
[15:56] in the sweet
[15:59] by and
[16:03] we shall meet on that beautiful shore.
[16:09] We shall [music] see on that beautiful
[16:13] shore.
[16:16] The melody
[16:18] songs of the
[16:23] spears shall sorrow.
[16:29] Not a sign for the blessings [singing]
[16:32] [music] of rest.
[16:35] In the sweet

[17:49] shore.
[17:51] Oh, I believe [singing]
[17:55] Jesus saves
[17:58] [music] and his blood washes whiter than
[18:02] snow.

[18:52] Amen. Jesus saves. Amen.
[18:56] I want to live the way you want me to
[18:58] live. May try the verses here.
[19:02] I don't think we've ever sang them in
[19:03] church, but I do like them. So, we might
[19:06] try that tonight. I want to live
[19:11] the way
[19:13] he wants me [singing]
[19:16] to live.
[19:18] I want to give
[19:22] until [singing] there's just no more to
[19:27] give.
[19:28] I want to love
[19:32] love till there's just no more love.
[19:39] I could never
[19:42] ever out love the Lord.
[19:48] [music]
[19:50] There have been times
[19:52] when giving
[19:55] and loving
[19:57] [singing]
[19:57] brought pain.
[20:00] And I promise
[20:02] that I'd never
[20:05] never let it happen
[20:08] again.
[20:10] But I found out that loving
[20:16] is well worth the risk and that even
[20:22] [singing]
[20:24] in losing
[20:26] you win.
[20:30] I want [singing] to live
[20:34] the way
[20:36] [music] he wants me to live.
[20:41] I want to give
[20:44] until there's just no more to give. I
[20:51] [music] want to love
[20:55] love till there's just no more love.
[21:01] I could never
[21:04] never out love the Lord.
[21:12] He showed us
[21:14] that only
[21:17] through dying
[21:19] we live.
[21:21] And he gave
[21:24] when it seemed
[21:26] there was nothing
[21:29] to give. [music and singing]
[21:32] He loved
[21:34] when loving
[21:36] brought heartache
[21:39] and loss.
[21:41] He forgave [singing]
[21:44] from an old rugged
[21:47] cross. Let's stand this evening.
[21:51] I want to [music] live
[21:54] the way
[21:56] he wants [music] me to live. I want to
[22:02] give
[22:04] until there's just no more to give.
[22:11] I want to love
[22:14] love till there's just no more love.
[22:21] I could never
[22:24] never out love the Lord. One more time.
[22:30] Oh, I want to live
[22:34] the way
[22:37] he wants me [music] to live. I want to
[22:42] give
[22:44] until there's just no more to give.
[22:50] [music] I [singing] want to love.
[22:54] love till there's just no more love.
[23:01] I could never
[23:04] never out love the Lord.
[23:10] As we turn the service over to brother
[23:11] Aaron, let's sing the song Farther
[23:13] along. Tempted and tried were ofted
[23:20] and tried
[23:22] were
[23:24] soft made to wonder
[23:30] why it should be
[23:34] thus
[23:36] all the day long.
[23:42] While there are others
[23:48] living
[23:49] about
[23:51] us,
[23:53] never molested
[23:59] though [singing]
[24:00] in the wrong.
[24:05] Farther along
[24:08] will
[24:10] know all about
[24:14] it.
[24:16] Farther along
[24:20] will
[24:22] understand why.
[24:26] So [singing] cheer up my brother.
[24:33] live in the [music and singing] sun.
[24:36] Shine
[24:38] will understand
[24:42] it
[24:44] all by and by.
[24:48] When death [music] has come
[24:52] [singing] and
[24:54] taken [music]
[24:55] our love
[24:58] ones,
[25:00] it leaves our home
[25:03] so
[25:05] [music] lonely and dreary. [singing]
[25:10] Then do we wonder
[25:16] why others prosper
[25:21] living so wicked
[25:27] year after [music] year.
[25:32] Farther along
[25:36] will
[25:38] know all about
[25:41] it.
[25:43] Farther [singing]
[25:44] along
[25:47] will
[25:49] understand why.
[25:54] So cheer up my brother.
[26:00] Live in the sunshine
[26:05] will understand
[26:08] it
[26:10] all by and by.
[26:15] Faithful till death,
[26:18] said
[26:20] our loving master
[26:25] [music] of more days
[26:29] to
[26:31] labor and wait.
[26:37] boils the road
[26:40] will [singing]
[26:42] [music] then seem as nothing
[26:47] as we [music and singing] sweep through
[26:51] the
[26:53] beautiful
[26:54] gate.
[26:58] farther along
[27:05] about
[27:07] it. [music] Farther along
[27:13] will
[27:15] understand why.
[27:20] &gt;&gt; Cheer up my brother.
[27:24] [singing]
[27:25] live in the sunshine
[27:30] will [singing]
[27:31] understand
[27:34] it [music]
[27:36] all by cheer up my brother.
[27:41] So cheer up my brother.
[27:47] Live in the sunshine.
[27:52] We'll [singing]
[27:53] understand
[27:56] it
[27:58] all by [singing]
[27:59] and by.
[28:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:06] I I wonder will I even be worried about
[28:08] it?
[28:10] Will we even be thinking why did those
[28:11] things happen?
[28:13] But but he'll explain it if we need to
[28:16] know. I know. Let's just bow our heads,
[28:21] Lord. As as we see in in our natural way
[28:25] and all, we're so limited,
[28:29] but you you looked down and you you saw
[28:31] our needs. You saw where what we would
[28:33] go through and
[28:35] and you made a way, Lord. You came down
[28:38] yourself
[28:40] rather than just sending an ambassador
[28:43] or an envoy or a lieutenant. Lord, you
[28:47] you said, "I'm going to go myself. I'm
[28:49] going to walk in their shoes. I'm going
[28:52] to be touched by the filling of their
[28:53] infirmities
[28:55] and I'm going to know and I'm going to
[28:56] understand, Lord."
[28:59] And I don't know, we may question. We
[29:01] may ask you why, Lord. But for today,
[29:04] Lord, we're just saying thank you for
[29:06] being so good to us, Lord, and watching
[29:08] over us. So, just uh as we just speak
[29:11] these words, Lord, may you anoint them
[29:14] and and you you give them out as they
[29:16] should be, Lord. We ask in Jesus
[29:19] Christ's name. Amen. You may be seated.
[29:23] Thank you.
[29:25] I've always wondered, are how many
[29:27] questions are we going to have? Are we
[29:30] really going to be so wanting to know?
[29:34] I I don't know. I think we're just going
[29:36] to be so happy we're on that side. It's
[29:38] It's going to be It's going to be worth
[29:41] it all. So, and and as as humans, we are
[29:45] inquisitive. We are,
[29:48] you know, uh we like to know
[29:51] and u but God has it all under control.
[29:56] And so I was out for a walk and and kind
[30:00] of what I do when I I feel um a pull or
[30:04] a draw to something that the Lord is
[30:08] maybe inspiring me, I'll I'll take a
[30:11] walk in in the evening and of course now
[30:13] it's a lot earlier because it gets dark
[30:14] sooner and I like to do it more in the
[30:16] dark than in the the day and just kind
[30:20] of get away from everything around the
[30:22] house and and all and just let the Lord
[30:25] Is there something that that he would
[30:27] say to me? And about a month and a half
[30:29] ago, I I was I did that. And as I was as
[30:34] I was just maybe a quarter of the way or
[30:37] half of the way that I usually walk, I
[30:40] felt not in an audible voice, but just a
[30:42] strong impression of the joy of the Lord
[30:46] is my strength.
[30:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:48] &gt;&gt; So that was that was a thought and I was
[30:51] just going on. And then there's his
[30:53] brother who brother Dan comes and has
[30:55] minister for us every once in a while,
[30:57] Brother Ryan. And he's got a good way of
[31:00] just taking things and turning them and
[31:02] make you think and look at them from a
[31:04] different direction.
[31:05] And I went back there and I told him, I
[31:07] said, "You just took all my notes and
[31:09] turned them around."
[31:11] But that's okay.
[31:13] You know, it's it's the joy of the Lord
[31:15] as I begin to think about it. Is it what
[31:18] pleases me or is it what pleases him?
[31:21] And
[31:23] you know, as a father, as as a husband,
[31:25] as a friend, maybe a co-orker, if we
[31:29] have the right spirit, when somebody
[31:30] else is doing a good job, when somebody
[31:32] else is being blessed, we should rejoice
[31:35] with them.
[31:36] &gt;&gt; We shouldn't be jealous, we shouldn't be
[31:38] say why them, but rather have an
[31:40] attitude in our heart, thank you, Lord,
[31:42] for doing that for them. You know, when
[31:44] you have a good helper, don't criticize
[31:47] them. He's a good helper. they're
[31:49] they're there they're there giving you
[31:50] that extra that extra hand, you know,
[31:54] and so I I that was a thought and so
[31:57] yesterday as I had been working on my
[32:00] notes and I told my wife I'm going to go
[32:02] out and I'm going to to take the take a
[32:06] walk and it'll be half an hour to 45
[32:08] minutes or so.
[32:11] And as I was going and I I kind of get
[32:14] to the end of our street, all the lights
[32:15] are out so it's kind of dark after then.
[32:17] I feel like, okay, I'm I'm I'm away from
[32:18] all that. And I just felt the I just
[32:23] heard that song that I had asked Brother
[32:24] Jordan to sing. Farther along,
[32:27] we'll understand it.
[32:30] But in the meantime, we're going to
[32:32] trust in him. We're going to believe him
[32:35] and and we're also going to call out to
[32:37] him and he'll answer.
[32:39] And I love the way he does it. He
[32:41] answers the way he should answer, the
[32:43] way it should be. Um, you know,
[32:46] sometimes
[32:47] we'll answer to just kind of get them to
[32:50] quit asking the questions just to kind
[32:52] of stop it. But he doesn't do that. He
[32:54] answers to give you the answer that you
[32:57] need, the satisfying part. Now, he might
[32:59] not give it to you all at one time. You
[33:02] know, if you went into an algebra class
[33:03] or advanced in trigonometry, all and
[33:07] they try to teach it to you all in one
[33:08] day, it would do no good.
[33:11] &gt;&gt; It's got its place in its part
[33:12] experience by experience. And I believe
[33:14] that's what the Lord does too, too. So,
[33:18] just thinking on those things. And so,
[33:22] it if anything could have gone wrong, it
[33:24] did. Today,
[33:26] the uh printer ran out of ink.
[33:30] And so, I went to get and I found some
[33:33] ink. We loaded it up and the printer
[33:36] refused to work.
[33:38] We went around it. We tried this and
[33:41] that and everything. and I read off the
[33:44] notes cuz it's just where I make my
[33:46] notes. So, I kind of work off of that.
[33:47] And it just didn't want to work. And
[33:49] it's 3 or 4:00 in the afternoon and
[33:51] usually have my everything is ready and
[33:52] done. And I'm getting nervous.
[33:55] And um so my wife said, "Let me work on
[33:58] it. You go and eat dinner." That way she
[34:01] got me out of the room so I wouldn't be
[34:04] pacing like I was the whole time.
[34:07] And I I don't know what pacing solves,
[34:10] but we do it often.
[34:12] And so she was able to get a lot of it
[34:15] done and and we were able to send it to
[34:17] the church and then print it out.
[34:21] But the word joy
[34:24] um [snorts] it's an emotion. It's a
[34:27] feeling. It's something that transpires.
[34:29] It's just, you know, it's not something
[34:31] that you just read. It's something that
[34:33] happens. And and now what gives you joy
[34:35] may not be the same thing that gives me
[34:37] joy.
[34:38] But because you're being blessed, I
[34:40] shouldn't be upset, I should be praising
[34:44] God for your blessing also. And and when
[34:48] when God does something in your life,
[34:51] whatever it is,
[34:54] you know, and you rejoice on that, you
[34:56] are actually affecting those around you.
[34:59] &gt;&gt; They're wanting to know why are you
[35:01] rejoicing? And if and if they see that
[35:04] and they say, "How can I have that?" and
[35:07] then you can share.
[35:09] But as I looked it up, u one of the it
[35:13] was the feeling of great pleasure and
[35:17] happiness.
[35:19] And that was attributed to God when he
[35:22] looked down and he said, "It is good."
[35:25] And if it's good for God, it is good.
[35:28] That's all there is to it. The root of
[35:31] joy is gratefulness that makes one
[35:34] joyful. And that's us being grateful,
[35:37] being thankful, being appreciative. And
[35:39] one of the greatest ways to me to being
[35:42] appreciative, a lot of times what we do,
[35:44] if somebody gives us a gift, we want to
[35:45] go buy them something.
[35:47] But a gift is a gift. If I intend to
[35:50] give it a gift, I don't expect something
[35:53] back for it. I'm giving it to you as a
[35:54] gift. And and but you know, right away
[35:57] we Oh, they gave me something. I need to
[35:59] give them one back.
[36:01] Well, the Lord did everything that I
[36:03] needed for salvation.
[36:06] He took care of it all. There there's
[36:07] nothing I could do to earn it, but I do
[36:10] my best to earn it to make myself worthy
[36:13] of it. No, he loved me while I was not
[36:16] worthy. While I didn't deserve it,
[36:19] because that's who he is.
[36:21] &gt;&gt; Now, my appreciation back to him is to
[36:24] just do the things that he appreciates,
[36:27] what he loves, what what brings him joy.
[36:30] I I think often brother Brandon was up
[36:32] on the on the mountain there in Colorado
[36:35] and the storm came and he turns to walk
[36:37] back
[36:39] and the Lord just tells him speak to
[36:42] that storm. I'm having a good fellowship
[36:44] with you right now. I'm enjoying my time
[36:46] with you. And God is the same way with
[36:49] us. I'm enjoying my time with you. I'm
[36:51] I'm it's it's a good time. I'm I'm with
[36:53] my son. I'm with my daughter.
[36:56] So again, it's it's the gratefulness
[36:58] that makes one joyful.
[37:00] And then a definition, joy is best
[37:02] understood as a primary emotion
[37:05] characterized by a deep sense of
[37:07] delight, satisfaction, contentment which
[37:11] can be triggered by both specific events
[37:14] and a broader sense of well-being or
[37:16] purpose in life. And that is true if if
[37:20] the bills are paid and everything's
[37:21] going good and oh well there's you know
[37:23] at night it's easier for us to rest.
[37:26] We're not thinking about every I got to
[37:28] take care of this tomorrow. There
[37:29] there's rest in that. And while feeling
[37:33] is a general term for experience
[37:36] emotions, joy is a specific emotional
[37:39] category itself
[37:42] distinct from other emotions like
[37:43] happiness which is often more fleeting
[37:46] and situation dependent.
[37:49] But when you have the joy on the l of
[37:50] the Lord in you, it's permanent. It's
[37:52] settled in there.
[37:55] &gt;&gt; But you know this makes me happy and
[37:57] that doesn't. Then we're like this and
[37:58] like this and like this. But the joy of
[38:01] the Lord is my strength.
[38:03] &gt;&gt; It's my encouragement. So, as I was
[38:06] thinking of this and Brother Ryan spoke
[38:09] how it it it is a joy of the Lord to put
[38:12] you through testing, through trying
[38:15] because he knows what the end result's
[38:17] going to be. He's not worried about it.
[38:20] He's not go, "Oh man, I'm going to have
[38:21] to a little bit more of this. some of
[38:22] that. Well, you know, kind of like a
[38:24] scientist that is testing and trying
[38:26] until they God already knows how it's
[38:28] going to work. You know, we're the ones
[38:30] that are wondering what's going on
[38:32] sometimes. But he says it it as brother
[38:35] Ryan said, you know, the Lord will put
[38:36] you through things
[38:39] and and tough times and r hard times and
[38:42] seems to turn your plans all the way
[38:44] around, but he knows what's best. He's
[38:47] already seen the end and he knows the
[38:49] result. So it it it made me think
[38:53] which way am I going to go? The joy of
[38:56] the Lord, the that the what we'd call
[38:57] the happy part, the bubbling up, the
[38:59] wonderful, the you know, or the fact
[39:03] that
[39:05] tempted and tried, I'm offade to wonder
[39:08] why is it this way? But I can still
[39:10] thank him. I can still praise him. I can
[39:13] still give him glory.
[39:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. So as I was walking yesterday,
[39:18] it just came strong. Farther along,
[39:22] you'll understand why. I said, "Okay,
[39:25] Lord, then we'll go that way." So Isaiah
[39:28] tells us Isaiah 55 8-11,
[39:32] he says, "For my thoughts are not your
[39:34] thoughts,
[39:36] neither are your ways my ways, sayaeth
[39:39] the Lord.
[39:41] For as a for as the heavens are higher
[39:43] than the earth, so are my ways higher
[39:45] than your ways and my thoughts than your
[39:47] thoughts.
[39:49] And to me, that just said, I've already
[39:51] seen the end. I already know where
[39:54] you're going. So, this is going to work
[39:57] out. Don't be troubled by it. For as
[40:00] [snorts] the rain cometh down, and the
[40:02] snow from heaven, and returneth not
[40:04] thither, but waterth the earth, and
[40:06] maketh it bring forth and bud, that it
[40:08] may give the seed to the sewer, and
[40:11] bread to the eater. So shall my word be
[40:14] that goeth forth out of my mouth. It
[40:16] shall not return unto me void.
[40:21] It's not going to be half done, half
[40:23] finishedish, partially started. It's
[40:25] going to be complete.
[40:27] But it shall accomplish that which I
[40:29] please, and it shall prosper into the
[40:32] thing there where unto I sent it. God
[40:35] has already seen it. It's finished.
[40:39] Now, we're going to walk through there,
[40:40] but he's already done that. You know,
[40:43] when I brother Shawn here, he in the
[40:46] military and his wife and when he got
[40:49] the badge or the award to be the when
[40:52] you went through the 20 months of
[40:53] training, well, when you were done the
[40:55] training, you were there, but you got
[40:58] the official marking or bad or the
[41:01] position, but you were there already.
[41:04] You know, you didn't have to work to go,
[41:06] "Hey, now I got to pay $5,000 for that."
[41:09] No, you had earned it. And that's what
[41:11] the Lord says. You're this is testing
[41:14] this trying is taking you to where
[41:16] you'll get to that point. And he says,
[41:19] "I've already seen you there. So, I know
[41:20] you're going to be there." It's it's
[41:23] like a child. Um I know, Brother Null,
[41:28] they have all girls and so did I, but
[41:29] they had more than I did. And um but
[41:34] the oldest one to the youngest one all
[41:38] had to grow up from a child. They didn't
[41:40] the older I I I would have thought that
[41:42] by the sixth one we could have just put
[41:44] Rachel right up with Naomi. But no, it
[41:46] took that same experience, that same
[41:50] growth. They had You have to get to know
[41:53] God for yourself and experience him.
[41:58] I know that the Lord Jesus Christ is the
[42:00] same one for each one of us. It's not a
[42:02] different God, but you have to know him
[42:04] for yourself. He says, "And it will." He
[42:08] said, "I like that. It it it will do
[42:11] what it said it's going to do." So, uh,
[42:14] it's it's it's amazing how we question
[42:17] him. And that's okay. I think he
[42:21] understands.
[42:22] Um,
[42:24] a um Chloe and Asher are here and and
[42:26] and Asher likes to say, "Why papa? How
[42:29] come papa?" You know, can we do this,
[42:32] Papa? You know, it's just and and papa's
[42:34] so patient sometimes and not so much
[42:36] sometimes, you know, we'll get it
[42:39] figured out. Wait till you grow up, you
[42:41] know, and then when they start growing
[42:42] up, don't grow up so fast, you know,
[42:44] stay little. But but God wants us to
[42:48] become mature Christians who know him,
[42:52] who trust him, not only because his word
[42:55] says so, but because you've learned it
[42:57] yourself.
[42:59] You can share it with someone else. So
[43:02] going back into Genesis 131, we'll go
[43:04] way way back to the beginning. Genesis
[43:07] 131. And God saw everything that he had
[43:10] made, and behold, it was very good. And
[43:14] the evening and the morning were the
[43:17] sixth day. God looked at it and said,
[43:19] "It's exactly what I planned."
[43:23] But he also knew what was coming up.
[43:26] You know, and then in Psalms uh 12:6,
[43:31] the words of the Lord are pure words as
[43:34] silver tried in a furnace of earth,
[43:36] purified seven times. There's no deceit.
[43:40] There's no mixture in it. It is the word
[43:42] of God. It is thus sayeth the Lord. And
[43:45] you can hold on to it. He said, "I will
[43:46] be with you even on you until the end of
[43:49] the world. I will never forsake you."
[43:52] And you can hold on to that.
[43:55] Nehemiah, now this is kind of where
[43:57] we're we're getting into the the joy
[43:59] part. Nehemiah 8:10.
[44:04] Then he said unto them, "Go your way,
[44:06] eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and
[44:08] send portions unto them for whom nothing
[44:10] is prepared. For this day is holy unto
[44:13] our Lord, neither be ye sorry, for the
[44:16] joy of the Lord is your strength."
[44:21] Now, they had gone through some hard
[44:23] times. They had gone through some real
[44:26] testing and and a lot of that was
[44:29] because they had failed, not because God
[44:31] failed. But he knew they would do it.
[44:34] Yet, he says, "The joy of the Lord is
[44:35] your strength." And and this is where it
[44:38] caught me. Is it the joy of the Lord
[44:41] that makes us happy and we have strength
[44:43] at, or is it the joy of the Lord that
[44:45] he's testing and trying us and producing
[44:47] what he saw?
[44:51] And I want him to try me and test me so
[44:54] that I can be what he has seen me as
[44:57] already. Okay? And and as he's seen you,
[45:01] and each one of us feels a different
[45:03] part, you know, a different place.
[45:07] Job says it this way, though he slay me,
[45:10] yet will I trust in him.
[45:14] He goes, and then the human part of him
[45:17] to me says, but I will maintain my own
[45:20] ways before him. I will still ask him.
[45:22] I'll still question him. I'll still
[45:24] wonder why.
[45:27] And Job,
[45:29] it's written well. It describes it very
[45:31] well.
[45:33] But getting to Job 38, where the Lord
[45:36] God himself comes down and says, "Come
[45:38] on, put your pants up. Buckle yourself
[45:41] up. We're going to have a conversation
[45:43] now. And the scripture says that the
[45:46] latter end of Job was better and greater
[45:48] than the first end of Job. And I'll tell
[45:50] you, when all this is over, all this
[45:53] will mean nothing on the other side. And
[45:56] there's there's there's a a little just
[45:59] a view from the side of Job. And then
[46:02] Jeremiah says 20 in 29:11 and 12. For I
[46:05] know the thoughts that I think towards
[46:07] you, sayeth the Lord, thoughts of peace
[46:09] and not of evil, to give you an expected
[46:13] end.
[46:16] Another translation, for I know the
[46:18] thoughts that I think toward you, sayeth
[46:20] the Lord, thoughts of peace and not of
[46:21] evil, to give you a future and a hope.
[46:25] You know, when you you're looking to the
[46:27] future and there's a hope and there's a
[46:28] desire, you press towards that.
[46:31] you know, going down the the road, going
[46:33] coming home on a long trip or going
[46:36] somewhere, you've been reach reading all
[46:38] the mileage signs. You know, from here
[46:40] to El Paso is about 300 miles or so and
[46:43] you know, when you get 5 miles out, it's
[46:45] 295 miles away and then 270 and then 220
[46:49] and then pretty soon you're 15 miles
[46:52] away. You had to go through all that
[46:54] experience of driving or flying, however
[46:57] you get there. You went through all of
[46:59] it. There is a time you get there.
[47:04] And so again, he says, "I know in
[47:08] Jeremiah 29, I know the thoughts that I
[47:11] think toward you, sayeth the Lord,
[47:13] thoughts of peace and not of evil to
[47:16] give you an expected end." Another way
[47:19] he says, "I know the thoughts that I
[47:21] think toward you, sayeth the Lord,
[47:22] thoughts of peace and not of evil to
[47:24] give you a future and a hope."
[47:29] it it's covered by him. He says, "Then
[47:32] shall you call upon me, and you shall go
[47:35] and pray unto me, and I will hearken
[47:37] unto you. I will listen. You'll get my
[47:40] attention. I will draw close to you." He
[47:42] said, "And you shall seek me and find me
[47:45] when you shall search for me with all
[47:48] your heart."
[47:50] You know, sometimes when you've got a
[47:51] lot going, you kind of divide the day.
[47:54] Okay, I'm going to give so much to this,
[47:55] so much to this, so much to this because
[47:57] you're trying to get But there's
[47:59] sometimes that something needs your full
[48:01] undivided attention.
[48:04] You you're you're working with that. And
[48:05] this is just when you when he says,
[48:07] "Well, you with all your heart." There's
[48:10] not room for anything else right there.
[48:12] God, I need to hear from you. God, I I
[48:15] want to get to know you more. Lord, I
[48:17] need to talk to you. And that's your
[48:19] whole intent and desire. And so this is
[48:22] just laying up to us getting close to
[48:27] him, us drawing up close to him. And and
[48:31] it's not that he draws away from us and
[48:36] he makes you chase him down or anything
[48:38] like that, but when you're coming close
[48:40] to the Lord, there is a way to approach
[48:43] him. There is a way to come and talk to
[48:46] him. It's not just knocking on the door.
[48:48] I'm coming in, Lord. I don't care if you
[48:50] don't have time for me now. know you
[48:51] need to listen to me and you got to you
[48:53] know all I would never say that but
[48:54] sometimes our actions show that I got
[48:56] five minutes for you Lord today so you
[48:59] be ready when I'm ready at those five
[49:01] minutes no when I wake up in the morning
[49:03] and say here I am Lord
[49:06] you have your way today so
[49:11] John 15:11 these things have I spoken
[49:14] unto you that my joy might remain in you
[49:17] and that your joy might be full.
[49:23] Okay? That his joy, what pleases him,
[49:27] what makes his him happy would be in
[49:30] you. And you know what makes him happy?
[49:32] When you begin to act like him,
[49:36] when you're willing to give your heart,
[49:38] when you're willing to talk to others,
[49:39] when you're willing to help others, when
[49:41] you're willing to set yourself aside,
[49:44] and and the joy and and
[49:47] how would we say this, the joy of the
[49:50] end of the day that you have have done
[49:51] what you can to help others to to to do
[49:55] what you're supposed to do, you can rest
[49:57] at night. You can go to sleep and say,
[49:59] "I did what I could."
[50:01] It's hard when you were supposed to and
[50:06] when we were kids and my dad would leave
[50:07] us a list of things to do, sweep the
[50:10] yard or, you know, cut the grass. And
[50:12] dad usually got home about 4:30 and at
[50:14] 4:15 we're going, "Man, dad's all almost
[50:16] home and I haven't started any of them
[50:18] yet." And like if we were going to trick
[50:20] my dad that we'd gotten it all done when
[50:22] he drives up, we're running around
[50:23] trying to do it all. But no, when when
[50:26] God lays it in your heart and you'll get
[50:29] going, you say, "Lord, just help me to
[50:32] do that which you have have have given
[50:35] to me for today."
[50:38] So the word um your joy might be full.
[50:42] Another way to say that so it might be
[50:43] complete and perfect. Perfect is not in
[50:47] the sense that we say flawless. Perfect
[50:49] is complete whole. everything that it
[50:51] was supposed to be because you and I
[50:54] cannot be perfect but he is perfect. So
[50:57] we if we'll do what he asks us to do he
[51:00] he says that's what I wanted from you.
[51:03] And in Galatians 5:22
[51:06] but the fruit of the spirit is love,
[51:09] joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness,
[51:14] goodness, faith, meekness, temperance.
[51:18] Against such there is no law.
[51:23] And
[51:25] oh wow, I got the
[51:28] which part do I got down?
[51:30] Sometimes it's love. Sometimes it's joy.
[51:34] But Lord, I need I need all of them to
[51:36] be working in my life. Uh so put me
[51:38] through some more testing. Put me
[51:40] through some more learning. You know,
[51:43] and and he says that is the fruit of the
[51:45] spirit. So as you begin to see that
[51:47] come, understand that's God working in
[51:49] you. That's God working in you. And when
[51:52] it comes out the wrong way, then you
[51:54] say, "Lord, help me fix that. Help me
[51:56] get that straightened out. Help put me
[51:59] through that test again so I can learn
[52:00] it." How many have ever prayed that way?
[52:04] Put me through the test again so I can
[52:06] learn it right. Um, no. I passed with a
[52:10] D minus. And I'll go on. Well, I hope
[52:13] you're not the engineer of my project,
[52:16] you know. No, I want something that
[52:18] said, you know, I I I I I needed some
[52:20] more learning and I went and pursued
[52:22] that.
[52:24] I'm sure brother Sean on one of the the
[52:26] planes up there, the other guy says,
[52:27] "Hey, I read the book. I'll be your
[52:29] co-pilot." You know, no, no, no. You
[52:32] want make sure he has x amount of hours
[52:33] and and x amount of experience there.
[52:38] So now James says James 1 2 and 4
[52:43] says my brethren count it all joy when
[52:46] you fall into diverse temptations.
[52:49] Oh my [snorts] or let it be all joy to
[52:54] you my brothers when you undergo test of
[52:56] every sort.
[52:59] You know, the test of every sort is the
[53:02] daily things that you go walking
[53:04] through, what you have that day, what
[53:07] the reaction is. Uh, a phone call you
[53:10] get and you look at the number and you
[53:12] go, "Oo, I don't want to talk to them."
[53:15] Nobody else does that.
[53:19] Only when I'm awake.
[53:22] Only when I'm awake, you know, but
[53:24] sometimes, you know, it's his name is
[53:26] Bill Collector. you know, you don't want
[53:27] to talk to him. But there's things, you
[53:30] know, but but it he tells us, "Let all
[53:34] let it all be joy to you, my brothers,
[53:36] when you undergo test of every sort."
[53:39] Lord, in this test, you're testing me
[53:43] because you know what I need, but you'll
[53:46] know that I will pass the test.
[53:50] Even if it takes 10 times trying it, I
[53:53] will pass the test.
[53:56] And because knowing this that the trying
[53:58] of your faith workketh patience,
[54:01] Lord, I need patience and I need it now.
[54:05] Please just give me a a bag of patience
[54:07] and I'll put in my pocket. I said, "No,
[54:10] patient comes through testing and trying
[54:12] and learning." And um it it is something
[54:17] that
[54:18] they that wait upon the Lord shall renew
[54:21] their strength.
[54:23] Waiting on the Lord is not sitting on a
[54:25] chair. It's going about your daily
[54:28] duties, doing what you should do, but
[54:30] waiting on God to work through you.
[54:33] Well, I'm just going to sit here and
[54:35] wait till God comes and do it. Well, he
[54:36] walked by you 10 times and you missed it
[54:38] while you were sitting there. Let's
[54:40] let's get active.
[54:42] He says in James 1:4 again, "My
[54:46] brethren, count it all joy when you fall
[54:48] into diverse temptations. Let it be all
[54:50] joy to to you brothers when you undergo
[54:53] test of every sort sort knowing this
[54:56] that the trying of your faith workketh
[54:58] patience. Knowing that the proof of your
[55:00] faith doth work endurance
[55:04] that you can get up and go again. You
[55:06] can get up and go again. You can get up
[55:08] and go. man.
[55:10] And then he said, "But let patience have
[55:13] her perfect work that you may be perfect
[55:16] and entire, wanting nothing. But let his
[55:20] power have full effect so that you may
[55:22] be made complete, needing nothing.
[55:26] Wanting and needing sometimes wanting,
[55:29] Lord, I'm I'm always wanting more. I'm
[55:31] always desiring more." But he knows what
[55:34] you need. He also knows the amount that
[55:36] you need. He knows how to work those
[55:38] things. saying, "Lord, teach me to to to
[55:40] understand that, to know that." Um, and
[55:44] then another, "But let this power have
[55:45] its full effect so that you may be made
[55:48] complete, needing nothing."
[55:51] Lord, let it be that way. Let it be that
[55:54] way daily. Daily.
[55:56] So now
[55:59] in the thought again here that the joy
[56:02] of the Lord, he loves to put his
[56:05] children through test.
[56:08] because he knows what it's going to do.
[56:12] Um, I know like Liam, I've sometimes
[56:17] Ununice, my my niece, sends pictures of
[56:19] him doing his work and he's up there and
[56:22] he's going and he's he's coloring or
[56:24] doing his numbers and I'm sure after
[56:27] about five minutes he wants to go play
[56:30] sometimes, you know, unless it's a
[56:32] really exciting project, you know, five
[56:34] minutes, 10 minutes. And we're kind of
[56:36] the same way, I think, with the Lord.
[56:37] Lord, I've talked to you for a few
[56:39] minutes, but I've got things to do now.
[56:42] No, if we please him,
[56:48] and that's the key to me. You please him
[56:50] first.
[56:53] Sometimes we're just looking for him to
[56:55] please us.
[56:57] But Lord, if I please you and you're
[56:59] happy with me, I know that nothing wrong
[57:03] or nothing bad is going to go because
[57:07] and and I just thinking this in a human
[57:09] way. If I can please you first, Lord,
[57:13] then I can treat others.
[57:17] But if I can't even please the one that
[57:20] loved me and gave his life for me, what
[57:22] am I going to do to others?
[57:26] But if I know he gave his life for me
[57:27] and he was willing to give his life for
[57:30] me and die and and cover for me, then I
[57:33] should say, 'Lord, as you've been and
[57:34] done to me, let me be that for someone
[57:36] else.
[57:39] Sometimes it's hard. Well, often it's
[57:42] hard.
[57:44] if um
[57:47] you know just sometimes just some simple
[57:49] things that happen and we just kind of
[57:50] somebody cut you off on the road,
[57:53] somebody um cut you off in line at the
[57:56] store and you know I don't like it
[57:59] either.
[58:01] But sometimes just step back and let it
[58:04] go. It's all right. I got there 15
[58:08] seconds later, but I got there in one
[58:09] piece.
[58:12] And and so sometimes we just let let it
[58:14] be. I remember something. And my dad was
[58:20] when he was still, you know, healthy and
[58:22] strong, much younger, he he it's hard
[58:25] for him to to take a no. And if he saw
[58:28] somebody being mistreated,
[58:30] he wanted to get in the middle of that.
[58:33] And we were going down the the road one
[58:35] day and uh here in Tucson and there was
[58:39] a a Hispanic young man and a low rider
[58:42] and I don't know if you've been behind a
[58:44] low rider. They're rarely going fast.
[58:46] They're usually going down the road like
[58:47] that. And then there was two other guys
[58:50] and then they were in their car and they
[58:51] were mad at him. Oh, we had pulled up to
[58:54] the Circle K to get a drink after
[58:56] finishing work. And when the guy comes
[58:59] to a stop sign, the other two guys jump
[59:01] out of the car and start running towards
[59:03] his car and are yelling at him.
[59:07] And probably from here to brother Dave
[59:10] Fritz, maybe about that far away back
[59:12] there. And my dad starts yelling at
[59:14] them. Hey, there's two of you and only
[59:16] one of him. And I'm Dad, [laughter]
[59:19] you're 50 years old and injured. Turn
[59:21] around and get back this way. Those are
[59:23] some young men over there. And no, my
[59:25] dad kept going.
[59:27] Fortunately, when the two guys turned
[59:29] around and came at my dad, the guy in
[59:31] the other car took off down the road and
[59:32] went.
[59:34] My dad wanted to. I I don't know if you
[59:36] remember when my dad came, you probably
[59:37] would have, but he left pretty strong.
[59:39] Couldn't But he wanted to get in the
[59:41] middle of it because it was two against
[59:43] one.
[59:45] I said, "Talk to dad later." I said,
[59:46] "Come on, Dad. You couldn't catch them.
[59:49] You couldn't do No, but it was two
[59:51] against one. I don't know that, Dad. But
[59:53] you also have to pay attention to what
[59:54] you're getting involved with.
[59:57] And and but I know one thing, my father,
[1:00:01] my heavenly father,
[1:00:04] there's no issues with him if he gets in
[1:00:07] the middle of it.
[1:00:09] There's no no weary. There's no no
[1:00:12] trouble in that. He knows what he's
[1:00:14] going to do. So
[1:00:18] in [clears throat] and first in first
[1:00:19] Peter
[1:00:21] um um
[1:00:24] 7-9 chapter one that the trial of your
[1:00:27] faith being much more precious than gold
[1:00:30] that perishes
[1:00:32] though it be tried with fire might be
[1:00:35] found unto praise and honor and glory at
[1:00:37] the peering of Jesus Christ the trial of
[1:00:41] your faith.
[1:00:44] If we If we're getting a product, we
[1:00:47] want to know I its value. Is it been
[1:00:50] tested? Has it been proven? Has its, you
[1:00:53] know, I'm going to spend X amount of
[1:00:55] money. Is it a good product? And it's
[1:00:58] the same thing that is, is he a
[1:01:01] Christian? Is she a Christian? The trial
[1:01:03] of your faith develops that character in
[1:01:06] you.
[1:01:08] We say, Lord, here I am.
[1:01:13] Be it unto me according to your word.
[1:01:15] Take me. Allow me. And when I make a
[1:01:18] mistake, because I will make mistakes.
[1:01:21] I'm human.
[1:01:23] Help me to as quick as I can catch
[1:01:26] myself turn around and repent.
[1:01:30] And I love this.
[1:01:33] When God forgives your sin and erases it
[1:01:36] under the blood, there is no evidence of
[1:01:39] it anymore.
[1:01:41] Okay. And when you say, "Lord, I did it
[1:01:44] again." And he looks in the book and he
[1:01:46] says, "No, you haven't. This is the
[1:01:47] first time,
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; But that's what the word of God says.
[1:01:52] His blotted into the sea of God's
[1:01:54] forgetfulness."
[1:01:57] And when you're just willing to say, "I
[1:01:59] I did it wrong. I made the mistake.
[1:02:02] Lord, forgive me." And he says, "That's
[1:02:04] my son. That's my daughter." He says,
[1:02:07] "The trial of your faith being much more
[1:02:09] precious than that of gold that
[1:02:11] perishes, though it be tried with fire
[1:02:13] might be found under praise and honor
[1:02:15] and glory at the pering of Jesus
[1:02:17] Christ." It is the trial of your faith.
[1:02:22] He says whom having not seen ye love in
[1:02:25] whom though now ye are now you see him
[1:02:29] not yet believing ye rejoice with joy
[1:02:32] unspo speakspeakable and full of glory
[1:02:35] because he is consistent. You know you
[1:02:38] can trust him. He doesn't fail receiving
[1:02:42] the end of your faith even the salvation
[1:02:45] of your souls. Now, in order to to
[1:02:49] shorten this, you can look at those that
[1:02:54] have a very good um the story of them is
[1:02:59] well written in the Bible. Some that
[1:03:01] just one sentence uh that's all you know
[1:03:04] about them. But people like David and
[1:03:06] people like Peter and and many Moses,
[1:03:10] there's a lot of information, a lot that
[1:03:13] is given out on them and their life and
[1:03:15] all. And you can see that the story is
[1:03:19] true because both sides of the story are
[1:03:21] told.
[1:03:24] If all it showed was the victory and the
[1:03:26] victory and the victory,
[1:03:29] we would wonder what's wrong with
[1:03:30] ourselves cuz mine isn't victory and vic
[1:03:34] mine sometimes problem and problem. But
[1:03:37] God through his word has showed us that
[1:03:39] all men failed him.
[1:03:43] Now I I I think of this
[1:03:47] The Lord had been coming down to the
[1:03:49] garden with Adam and Eve for who knows
[1:03:53] how much time it was.
[1:03:55] And there had been such a fellowship,
[1:03:57] such a wonderful time that they knew
[1:03:59] about the time he would come in the cool
[1:04:00] of the evening and they would be waiting
[1:04:02] for him.
[1:04:04] But there came the day that he knew he
[1:04:06] was coming down and there was going to
[1:04:08] be a change
[1:04:11] because they had sinned.
[1:04:15] Now, him knowing all things
[1:04:18] and we know all of this because of the
[1:04:20] scriptures and what God has revealed to
[1:04:23] us through through brother Brandham and
[1:04:25] and not only brother Brandham through
[1:04:27] but through everyone that God spoke
[1:04:29] through and he put it in and we got the
[1:04:32] privilege of actually being able to
[1:04:33] hear, not just reading like we did of
[1:04:36] Paul and others.
[1:04:38] And and here he comes. He's he's coming
[1:04:40] to to visit Adam and Eve, yet he knows
[1:04:43] what they've done.
[1:04:45] but also knowing that that's the only
[1:04:47] way he could manifest
[1:04:49] salvation. That's the only way those
[1:04:53] inner inner traits of him could be
[1:04:55] demonstrated.
[1:04:58] And there had never been death
[1:05:02] and somebody had to die. Something had
[1:05:04] to die that day.
[1:05:06] And when when God comes up and then I I
[1:05:09] believe it was a lamb picked up that
[1:05:11] little lamb, there was no fear in the
[1:05:14] lamb. It had never happened before.
[1:05:18] There was peace. He was happy. My
[1:05:19] creator has me in his arms. Not knowing
[1:05:21] that God was going to take the life of
[1:05:24] that little animal
[1:05:26] to save
[1:05:28] his creation.
[1:05:32] But here's the other part. after they
[1:05:34] were cast out and he had come every day
[1:05:38] in the cool of the evening for I don't
[1:05:39] know how long
[1:05:41] and they're now on the outside and it's
[1:05:44] the cool of the evening and they're
[1:05:45] waiting for him to come because that's
[1:05:48] what happened every day their fellowship
[1:05:51] and he didn't come that day.
[1:05:56] Could you imagine being there and then
[1:05:59] it dawns on them?
[1:06:02] It's not going to be like it was.
[1:06:05] It's not going to be like it was. And so
[1:06:08] here is God. He's looking and he's
[1:06:10] saying because in me was a redeemer. In
[1:06:15] me is a part of a healing. In me is a
[1:06:18] part of salvation. And I need to express
[1:06:20] it.
[1:06:22] And that's his joy to express who he is
[1:06:25] to you and me and to everybody.
[1:06:28] if if he's a healer, if if he if if he
[1:06:31] gives peace, there has to be somebody
[1:06:33] that needs it.
[1:06:36] So, this is where I felt the Lord turn
[1:06:38] my thoughts.
[1:06:40] The joy of the Lord,
[1:06:44] what makes him happy.
[1:06:47] And he says, then he comes down and
[1:06:49] says, I want to I want to be with you. I
[1:06:51] I enjoy this, but I'm willing to do this
[1:06:54] to have that fellowship.
[1:06:57] looking unto Jesus, the author and
[1:06:59] finish of our faith, who for the joy
[1:07:02] that was set before him, he endured the
[1:07:05] cross,
[1:07:07] despising the shame, and is sat down at
[1:07:10] the right hand of the throne of God.
[1:07:13] Could you imagine being the King of
[1:07:14] Kings and Lord of Lords, and you were
[1:07:17] going to die like a lowly sinner? You
[1:07:20] were going to give your like you were
[1:07:21] the worst person that ever was the way
[1:07:23] he was treated. But he said, "I will do
[1:07:26] it because it is fulfilling my joy to
[1:07:30] have them with me."
[1:07:34] Isaiah 53:10, "Yet it pleased the Lord
[1:07:36] to bruise him. He hath put him to grief.
[1:07:40] When thou shalt make his soul an
[1:07:42] offering for sin, he shall see his seed.
[1:07:45] He shall prolong his days, and the
[1:07:47] pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in
[1:07:49] his hand."
[1:07:52] it. He said this this way of salvation
[1:07:55] is going to express who I am to those
[1:07:58] who need it. All that is within me, he
[1:08:01] says, I'm going to get to share. Says
[1:08:06] in Psalms
[1:08:08] 126:5,
[1:08:11] they that sow in tears shall reap in
[1:08:14] joy.
[1:08:16] How many have swed in tears?
[1:08:18] hard and wondering why. But there's a
[1:08:21] promise of a reap in joy.
[1:08:24] Job 38:7.
[1:08:26] And he says when he when the Lord sacked
[1:08:29] him, he says, "Where were you, Job? When
[1:08:31] the morning stars sang together and all
[1:08:33] the sons of God shouted, shouted for
[1:08:35] joy. Where were you, Job?
[1:08:38] You were in my thoughts. You were part
[1:08:40] of that."
[1:08:42] And now you read Job
[1:08:45] and for
[1:08:47] what 36 of the first 38 chapters, Job is
[1:08:51] saying, "Lord, I want an answer. I I I
[1:08:54] need an answer. I want to talk to you. I
[1:08:55] want to know the wise."
[1:08:58] How many is how many of us are that same
[1:09:00] way? Why, Lord? Why? How come? Why did
[1:09:03] this happen? Today was a fun day for
[1:09:07] somebody. It wasn't for me.
[1:09:10] got up knowing we're going to get my
[1:09:12] notes ready.
[1:09:14] The computer crashed, the printer quit
[1:09:16] working, everything. We went to the
[1:09:19] store, bought the power, got back. It
[1:09:21] didn't work. It wouldn't work. We
[1:09:24] printed it here in the uh sent it here
[1:09:27] and printed it all here. Um, and then
[1:09:32] kind of funny because I don't know how
[1:09:33] it happened, but the one scripture got
[1:09:36] printed in very large print and printed
[1:09:40] 15 pages of it.
[1:09:42] Okay? Because I don't know how it would
[1:09:45] happen. And
[1:09:48] I know my wife and the girls back there
[1:09:49] didn't do it on purpose, so I did my
[1:09:51] best to stay calm back there. I said,
[1:09:55] "Just if you can help me get it, please
[1:09:58] get it to me."
[1:10:00] And I I'm thinking, you know, I said,
[1:10:04] "Lord, this is you're testing us. You're
[1:10:08] trying us because it brings you joy when
[1:10:12] you see the end result.
[1:10:14] It doesn't it doesn't make you happy
[1:10:16] when you see us suffering and going
[1:10:18] through hard stuff." But you know that
[1:10:20] this is giving us character. you know
[1:10:22] that this is going to be a victory for
[1:10:24] us and in that you're pleased
[1:10:27] but Lord why did you have to do it to me
[1:10:29] at the last minute
[1:10:32] he goes he goes see when you're tested
[1:10:34] and tried and you often wonder why it
[1:10:38] should be this way
[1:10:40] but farther along
[1:10:42] will understand why
[1:10:46] Psalm 16:11 thou will show me the path
[1:10:49] of life in thy presence is fullness of
[1:10:53] joy, and at thy right hand are pleasures
[1:10:56] forever more.
[1:11:00] John 15:11, "These things have I spoken
[1:11:04] unto you, that my joy might remain in
[1:11:06] you, and that your joy might be full." I
[1:11:10] want his joy in me, because my joy isn't
[1:11:13] always good for me. I think it might be,
[1:11:17] but it turns out a different way. I have
[1:11:20] said these things to you that I may have
[1:11:22] joy in you and so your joy may be
[1:11:25] complete or perfectly fulfilled come to
[1:11:28] its complete fullness.
[1:11:31] James 1 2 and4 my brethren count it all
[1:11:34] joy when you fall into diverse
[1:11:36] temptations.
[1:11:38] Yeah. Uhhuh.
[1:11:40] Come on James,
[1:11:42] you said I count it when I fall into
[1:11:44] diverse temptations.
[1:11:46] And and sometimes we fall into our
[1:11:48] diverse temptations because we went to
[1:11:50] where we would fall into the diverse
[1:11:51] temptations.
[1:11:53] If if I know that I go buy a bakery
[1:11:57] and I got some money, I'm going to stop.
[1:12:01] I mean, it's like a magnet.
[1:12:04] But then my wife says, "Why are you
[1:12:06] eating the sugar that you're not
[1:12:07] supposed to be eating?" Cuz she cares.
[1:12:10] But then I buy her a donut and it's
[1:12:12] okay.
[1:12:15] It's still not good for me.
[1:12:18] But sometimes we just will put ourselves
[1:12:20] in the place to get in trouble.
[1:12:24] He says, "So count it all joy when you
[1:12:26] fall into diverse temptation. Let it all
[1:12:29] let it be all joy to you, my brothers,
[1:12:31] when you undergo tests of every sort,
[1:12:34] knowing this that the trying of your
[1:12:36] faith workketh patience."
[1:12:40] Lord, I want patience and I want it now.
[1:12:43] Lord says, you want patience? All right,
[1:12:46] let's start working on that.
[1:12:48] And maybe he goes by every letter of the
[1:12:50] word patience. We'll work on the P first
[1:12:53] and then we'll work on this far until
[1:12:55] you get to, hey, you're beginning to do
[1:12:57] that. But we would be a bunch of spoiled
[1:12:59] children if we just got everything we
[1:13:00] wanted just like that.
[1:13:03] He says,
[1:13:06] "Knowing that the trying of your faith
[1:13:08] workketh patient or produces endurance,
[1:13:11] you can last. You can go, you can until
[1:13:14] it's finished.
[1:13:16] But let patience have her perfect work,
[1:13:19] that ye may be perfect and entire,
[1:13:21] wanting nothing. But let this attribute
[1:13:24] have its full effect, so that you may be
[1:13:26] made complete, needing nothing."
[1:13:30] And it's a start, and it's a finish.
[1:13:33] And halfway there is not finished.
[1:13:37] Twothirds of there is not finished.
[1:13:39] 9/10enth is not finished. It's all the
[1:13:42] way through.
[1:13:46] One John4 1 John. And these things write
[1:13:49] I we unto you that your joy may be full
[1:13:53] may be complete, whole and fulfilling.
[1:13:58] I you look at the life of the disciples.
[1:14:00] They walked with Jesus. They talked with
[1:14:02] Jesus. They saw all these things.
[1:14:06] Yet, he told them, "I'm going to hang on
[1:14:08] a cross. I'm going to die. Come pray
[1:14:11] with me. Come be with me for this time."
[1:14:14] And they get down there. And when he
[1:14:15] turns around, they're asleep.
[1:14:20] They were tired. They're asleep. And he
[1:14:22] wakes them up. He says, "Can't you can't
[1:14:24] you just with 15 minutes with me?" And
[1:14:27] they go back to sleep. His dearest
[1:14:30] friends are sleeping while he's
[1:14:32] agonizing.
[1:14:34] Yet he knew that he had to go.
[1:14:38] And he had one more decision to make.
[1:14:42] He says there, "Lord, not my will but
[1:14:46] thy will be done."
[1:14:48] And then he cries on the cross. I think
[1:14:50] the greatest thing, "Father, forgive
[1:14:52] them. They don't know what they're
[1:14:54] doing.
[1:14:56] I wasn't there on that day, but I was
[1:14:58] represented on that day because he was
[1:15:01] looking at me. He saw me. He saw you.
[1:15:03] And he says, "I've got to go through
[1:15:05] with this." And that was his joy. The
[1:15:09] pleasure of seeing his children restored
[1:15:10] back to him. The joy of drawing them
[1:15:13] back into salvation.
[1:15:15] He said, "I will go do it."
[1:15:19] To me and you, that doesn't sound like
[1:15:20] joyful.
[1:15:22] But if the end result is that that he
[1:15:25] said, "I'll be with me. I'll be with you
[1:15:27] even into you until the end of the
[1:15:28] world. Therefore, you can be with me."
[1:15:30] He said, "I will do it."
[1:15:36] John 1:4
[1:15:38] again, "And these things we write unto
[1:15:41] you that your joy may be full, complete,
[1:15:43] whole, or fulfilling."
[1:15:45] Jude
[1:15:47] 1:24 and25. And now unto him that is
[1:15:50] able to keep you from falling and to
[1:15:52] present you faultless before the
[1:15:54] presence of his glory with exceeding joy
[1:15:57] to the only wise God our savior be glory
[1:16:00] majesty dominion and power both now and
[1:16:03] forever. Amen.
[1:16:08] I think that's a good way to end. That's
[1:16:10] a good way to end. Look what he says.
[1:16:13] Now unto him this is that is able to
[1:16:16] keep you from falling to present you
[1:16:18] faultless before the presence of his
[1:16:21] glory with exceeding joy to the only
[1:16:23] wise God our savior be glory and majesty
[1:16:27] dominion power both now and forever.
[1:16:30] Amen. If the musicians want to come up
[1:16:40] he is our joy. He is our peace. He is
[1:16:44] our everything. He is our all.
[1:16:48] But you know, if you don't partake of
[1:16:50] it,
[1:16:52] it's like a beautiful meal that's been
[1:16:54] prepared. Uh whatever it is, but you
[1:16:56] don't eat it.
[1:16:59] Now, if it's probably prepared for
[1:17:01] nobody to eat, like when you see in the
[1:17:03] plays are probably plastic. They're
[1:17:05] probably just they look nice, but
[1:17:08] they're not edible.
[1:17:11] But but he became me
[1:17:15] so that I could become him. He took my
[1:17:18] place.
[1:17:22] Brother Brandham says in this in a
[1:17:25] message Hebrews chapter 2, he's praying.
[1:17:28] He says, "Grant, Lord, that the type of
[1:17:31] life,
[1:17:32] this type of life will enter every
[1:17:34] person that raise their hands." You know
[1:17:38] sometimes I don't know it seems like
[1:17:41] maybe that's just a formality.
[1:17:45] How many here brother would say except
[1:17:49] the Lord Jesus Christ. He said raise
[1:17:51] your hand and they would. And he said
[1:17:54] you see what happened now? They just
[1:17:55] gave their heart to the Lord.
[1:18:00] And and he said look how many just gave
[1:18:02] their heart to the Lord. That's how he
[1:18:05] saw it. Sometimes I see it, oh, they're
[1:18:07] just raising their hand. There's no real
[1:18:09] conviction. There's no because I want to
[1:18:11] see something that makes me happy about
[1:18:13] them. But God looks down inside the
[1:18:16] heart and he sees that reaction. And
[1:18:18] sometimes the simplest reaction is
[1:18:20] enough for him to stir all of heaven to
[1:18:23] you down and take care of something.
[1:18:26] He would do it. [snorts]
[1:18:30] And that type of life would enter every
[1:18:32] person that raised their hands. and
[1:18:34] these who should have raised their hands
[1:18:36] [music] and did not. I'm glad that
[1:18:38] included everybody in there. I pray that
[1:18:42] you will be with them. Grant it, Father.
[1:18:45] And when the journey is ended, life is
[1:18:47] finished, may we enter into peace at
[1:18:50] that day with him
[1:18:52] where we'll never be old, never be sick,
[1:18:56] never be no trouble.
[1:18:59] Until then, keep us joyful and happy
[1:19:04] praising him. We ask it in Jesus name.
[1:19:08] Until then, I I I just I just it was a
[1:19:11] simple prayer and I said, Lord, just a
[1:19:14] desire
[1:19:16] for someone to give in their heart,
[1:19:18] their life to the Lord and let the joy
[1:19:20] of the Lord come in with that. It's not
[1:19:23] my job nor your job to change them.
[1:19:27] Let them give their heart to the Lord
[1:19:28] and let God do the work. Neither is my
[1:19:31] job or your job to judge them.
[1:19:35] Let God do it. And I'm glad God doesn't
[1:19:39] make everybody the same.
[1:19:42] He has individuals the way they are and
[1:19:44] they fit. It's like building something
[1:19:47] and every part has its place.
[1:19:52] And then he says, see if I got it.
[1:19:59] divine [clears throat] healing
[1:20:02] um
[1:20:05] he says he comes into the mouth [music]
[1:20:07] he makes you talk different you don't
[1:20:10] talk like you used to Christ God in your
[1:20:13] mouth done grow from your heart your
[1:20:17] love you you had for him until you can
[1:20:19] bridle your tongue brother that's a
[1:20:21] great thing then the next thing you know
[1:20:24] it grows into your eyes and the next
[1:20:25] thing you know you find out that the old
[1:20:27] lustful thing you used to look at you'll
[1:20:29] turn your head you're growing then when
[1:20:32] the first thing you know you still turn
[1:20:34] your head but you're thinking see after
[1:20:36] a while it grows into your mind and you
[1:20:39] don't even think about it no more it
[1:20:42] becomes part of your character becomes a
[1:20:46] part of who you are though I walk
[1:20:49] through the valley of the shadow of
[1:20:51] death I will fear no evil because I know
[1:20:53] who's with me. He's proved himself over
[1:20:56] and over and over and he'll never leave
[1:20:58] me. And that's his promise and I'll
[1:21:01] accept [music] it.
[1:21:03] So the joy of the Lord is not so much if
[1:21:06] I'm happy. I I just feel it's turning.
[1:21:09] The joy of the Lord is when he sees that
[1:21:11] you and I are yielding and surrendering
[1:21:13] and letting him do the work because he
[1:21:15] knows the end result will be what it's
[1:21:16] supposed to be. When I do the work, who
[1:21:20] knows what might happen?
[1:21:22] Let's stand.
[1:21:26] We can all hear this is my beloved son.
[1:21:30] This is my beloved daughter. I am
[1:21:33] pleased with them.
[1:21:35] Lord,
[1:21:38] these are your words.
[1:21:41] I didn't write this portion of the
[1:21:43] scripture. I didn't make up this quote.
[1:21:45] These are things that you said, Lord.
[1:21:48] Therefore, we can take hold of it and
[1:21:50] let it we can we can partake of it. We
[1:21:53] can ingest it. We can we can let it
[1:21:55] become part of us.
[1:21:58] And Lord, I know tomorrow we'll be
[1:22:00] tested. Maybe we'll be tested tonight.
[1:22:03] Maybe someone will cut us off as we're
[1:22:05] driving on the way home. Maybe
[1:22:07] somebody's going too slow on the road
[1:22:08] ahead of us, Lord.
[1:22:11] And you're going to test us. You're
[1:22:13] going to try us because that's the only
[1:22:15] we know where we're at.
[1:22:18] what what is what do we need if if if we
[1:22:20] would walk into the class and we're
[1:22:22] tested the teachers then see what level
[1:22:25] are we are and then they know where to
[1:22:26] start and where to work with Lord and as
[1:22:29] you see each thing that we're learning
[1:22:30] and we're grasping and we're growing and
[1:22:32] then the test can continue until that
[1:22:35] day my eyes behold the city
[1:22:39] and but until that day with joy I'll
[1:22:43] carry on or let it be in Jesus Christ
[1:22:46] amen
[1:22:48] Thank you.
[1:22:53] Thank you, brother Jordan.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; Until then,
[1:22:59] my heart will go on singing.
[1:23:07] until [singing and music] then
[1:23:11] with joy I'll carry on
[1:23:18] until
[1:23:20] the day
[1:23:23] my eyes behold the city
[1:23:31] until the day
[1:23:35] God calls
[1:23:38] me [singing] home.
[1:23:43] But until [singing] then,
[1:23:47] my heart will go on singing.
[1:23:53] [music]
[1:23:55] Until [singing] then,
[1:23:58] with joy, I'll carry on.
[1:24:06] until the day.
[1:24:10] My eyes behold the city
[1:24:16] [music]
[1:24:18] until the day
[1:24:22] God calls
[1:24:25] me home. Let's try the first verse.
[1:24:29] My heart can sing
[1:24:34] when I pause to remember.
[1:24:40] A heartache here
[1:24:45] is but a stepping stone.
[1:24:52] along a trail
[1:24:56] that's winding
[1:24:58] all ways upwards.
[1:25:03] This trbled world
[1:25:08] is not my final home.
[1:25:15] But
[1:25:16] till then
[1:25:19] my heart will go on singing
[1:25:27] until then
[1:25:30] with joy I'll carry on
[1:25:38] until the day
[1:25:42] my eyes behold hold the city
[1:25:48] [music and singing]
[1:25:49] until the day
[1:25:53] God calls
[1:25:56] me home.
[1:26:00] The things of earth
[1:26:05] will dim and lose their value.
[1:26:12] If we recall,
[1:26:15] [music]
[1:26:16] they're borrowed
[1:26:18] for a while.
[1:26:23] And things of earth
[1:26:27] that caused the heart to tremble.
[1:26:34] remembered
[1:26:36] there
[1:26:38] will only bring a smile.
[1:26:45] But until [singing] then,
[1:26:50] my heart will go on singing.
[1:26:55] [music]
[1:26:57] Until then,
[1:27:01] with joy I'll carry on
[1:27:08] until the day.
[1:27:12] My eyes behold the city
[1:27:19] until the day
[1:27:23] God calls
[1:27:26] me home.
[1:27:32] Amen. Did you have anything, brother
[1:27:33] Daniel?
[1:27:34] last week or so, I think it was the last
[1:27:37] week, um I started kind of going over a
[1:27:41] list of character qualities that I'd
[1:27:45] found years and years ago and we were
[1:27:47] just doing it kind of as a family
[1:27:48] devotions and I had Caitlyn pick one
[1:27:51] out. She was the first one to pick one
[1:27:52] out and she picked out Joy last week and
[1:27:55] so we sang a song that kind of went with
[1:27:57] it. And so then when brother Daniel or
[1:28:00] brother Aaron was ministering tonight
[1:28:01] about joy, I thought, well, we're
[1:28:03] probably going to do this song. This is
[1:28:05] for the kids, but this is going to get
[1:28:07] everyone smiling and laughing, even the
[1:28:09] most straightfaced ones like brother
[1:28:11] David. So [snorts] the joy of the Lord
[1:28:17] is my strength. The joy of the Lord
[1:28:23] is my strength. The joy of the Lord
[1:28:29] is my strength. The joy of the Lord is
[1:28:34] my strength.
[1:28:37] Oh, the joy of the Lord
[1:28:40] is my strength. The joy of the Lord
[1:28:46] is my strength. [music]
[1:28:49] The joy of the Lord
[1:28:52] is [singing]
[1:28:52] my strength. The joy of the Lord [music]
[1:28:57] is my strength.
[1:29:00] He fills my heart with laughter. Ha ha
[1:29:04] ha ha. He fills my heart with laughter.
[1:29:08] Aha ha ha ha. He fills my heart with
[1:29:13] laughter.
[1:29:17] The joy of the Lord is my strength.
[1:29:22] Oh, the joy of the Lord
[1:29:26] is my strength. The joy of the Lord
[1:29:32] is my strength. The joy of the Lord
[1:29:37] is my strength. [music] The joy of the
[1:29:41] Lord [singing]
[1:29:42] is my strength.
[1:29:45] He What's another verse, Sister Rachel?
[1:29:48] He gives me living water and I thirst no
[1:29:53] more. He gives me living water and I
[1:29:57] thirst no more. He gives me living water
[1:30:02] and I thirst no more. The joy of the
[1:30:07] Lord is my strength. Another verse.
[1:30:14] Oh, the word of God is nigh thee, even
[1:30:18] in thy mouth. The word of God is nigh
[1:30:22] thee, even in thy mouth. The word of God
[1:30:27] is nigh thee, even in thy mouth. The joy
[1:30:32] of the Lord is my strength.
[1:30:37] The joy of the Lord
[1:30:40] is my strength. The joy of the Lord
[1:30:46] is my strength. The joy of the Lord
[1:30:50] [singing]
[1:30:52] is my strength. The joy of the Lord is
[1:30:57] my strength.
[1:31:04] I would do the haha part, but I don't
[1:31:06] look like brother Paul John Paul offain
[1:31:09] who would do that. some for for brother
[1:31:11] null Johnson to do. He could probably do
[1:31:13] that really well. But as you all go,
[1:31:16] we'll dismiss leaning on the everlasting
[1:31:18] arms. What a fellowship. What a joy
[1:31:21] divine. Leaning on the everlasting arms
