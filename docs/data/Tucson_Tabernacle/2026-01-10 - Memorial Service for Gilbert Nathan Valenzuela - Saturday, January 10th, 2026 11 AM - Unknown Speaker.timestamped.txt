[16:09] Good morning and God bless each one of
[16:11] you this morning as we gather together
[16:14] here to be with the family.
[16:18] We know that God is mindful of all of
[16:20] us. So, if you'll stand with me, we'll
[16:24] bow our heads in prayer
[16:26] and you talk to the Lord, too. It's not
[16:29] just the minister behind the pulpit, but
[16:31] you have as much right to ask the Lord
[16:34] to be your strength and be your comfort.
[16:36] So,
[16:39] Lord Jesus, we we come this morning
[16:43] as family, as friends,
[16:46] as part of the family of God.
[16:50] And Lord, it's in times like this that
[16:52] we can draw strength from one another.
[16:54] We can encourage one another.
[16:57] We can be that help in the time of
[17:00] trouble, Lord.
[17:02] So we ask for your direction, your
[17:04] leading, your comfort, Lord, in all that
[17:06] is said and done.
[17:09] Something that would give us strength to
[17:12] continue on as the days go forward.
[17:14] Lord, we commit each one and each
[17:17] person, each heart here and this time to
[17:21] you
[17:22] in Jesus Christ's name.
[17:25] The very first verse
[17:28] of Amazing Grace.
[17:33] Amazing
[17:36] grace,
[17:38] how sweet
[17:41] does
[17:44] that say
[17:47] a rich
[17:49] like me?
[17:55] I once
[17:58] was lost
[18:00] but now
[18:03] I'm found.
[18:06] I was mine
[18:09] but now
[18:11] what? And the last verse
[18:17] when we've
[18:19] been there
[18:22] 10,000
[18:25] years
[18:27] bright shineing
[18:31] as
[18:33] the sun
[18:38] with no
[18:41] less days
[18:43] to sing
[18:46] God's praise
[18:49] than when
[18:52] we first
[18:54] beun.
[18:59] Thank you. You may be seated.
[19:01] Thank you all for coming. Appreciate the
[19:04] family. Appreciate it. And now, pastor
[19:07] of Tucson Tab Tabernacle, Brother Daniel
[19:10] Evans.
[19:12] Thank you.
[19:28] Good morning to everyone. I know
[19:32] sometimes it's a many times it's a
[19:35] funeral that gathers people together.
[19:39] And I know that anytime that there's a
[19:41] group of people gathered together
[19:44] in the name of the Lord Jesus, then that
[19:46] is a group that is pleasing to the Lord.
[19:49] He told us that wherever two or three
[19:51] are gathered in my name, there I will be
[19:54] in the midst of them. And we gather here
[19:56] in the name of the Lord Jesus. So, he's
[19:59] here. He's with us.
[20:03] the um the passing of our dear brother
[20:07] is um
[20:09] it is a difficult thing and I know it's
[20:12] a difficult thing for everyone for the
[20:14] family for for friends especially for
[20:17] the wife for the children for the mother
[20:21] but we do have to rest in assurance that
[20:24] this is God's will and we may think that
[20:28] how could God Lord how could you be
[20:31] maybe in our grieving. How could you be
[20:34] so cruel that you would take a young man
[20:37] like this and then leave a mom and
[20:41] children here grieving? But we have have
[20:44] to trust that God knows the end of the
[20:47] game. He knows the end of the road. And
[20:50] we have to trust that this is all to
[20:53] accomplish a task
[20:55] that has to be accomplished that will be
[20:58] better for everyone in the end. And we
[21:02] look at the the passing of of this young
[21:04] man
[21:06] and we have to trust God. Lord, this is
[21:09] your will. This was the perfect time to
[21:13] take him and he's in a better place. We
[21:17] don't have to worry about that. If if he
[21:21] wouldn't have taken him, if it wasn't
[21:24] going to be for his salvation and it
[21:27] wasn't going to be for his own benefit,
[21:28] he wouldn't have taken him. We have to
[21:30] trust God that he was a child of God.
[21:32] And and anyone that knew Gilbert knows
[21:34] he was a he was a good husband. He was
[21:36] he was a good dad. He was a good son. He
[21:38] was very respectful. In the times that I
[21:41] met him, he was one of the most
[21:43] respectful young men and uh treated me
[21:47] very um very nicely and uh he loved his
[21:52] family of talking with brother Isaac
[21:55] there and he was always with his kids.
[21:59] He was he was good and this was God's
[22:03] time to take him to bring him up to
[22:06] glory. I didn't know the brother very
[22:09] well and I was a bit concerned that what
[22:13] can I say about his life? What can I say
[22:16] about him that would be adequate? And
[22:18] really there's nothing but the one who
[22:20] is adequate to say something about his
[22:23] life is his wife Stephanie. So Stephanie
[22:26] gave me something that she wanted to
[22:29] read, but she was worried that she
[22:30] wasn't going to be able to get through
[22:32] it. So I would like to read what his
[22:34] wife wrote
[22:36] about
[22:38] Gilbert.
[22:41] Gilbert had the biggest heart and felt
[22:43] everything so deeply. He would drop
[22:46] everything just to help those he loved.
[22:49] He was always the one to put others
[22:51] needs before his own. Perhaps
[22:55] life is harder on those with such with
[22:57] such sensitivity.
[22:59] The ones who remember every word spoken,
[23:01] every facial expression, analyze body
[23:04] language or patterns. He just was born
[23:07] with the memory of an elephant. He had
[23:10] the most radiant smile,
[23:13] but it never was faked. You could only
[23:16] pull one. You could only pull one out if
[23:21] he was genuinely happy and laughing.
[23:24] He also had the best sense of humor and
[23:27] could always make me laugh. We bonded
[23:29] over comedy shows and movies.
[23:32] Gilbert was so nurturing as well. If you
[23:35] were sick, he would get the Vix vapor
[23:37] rub and place it on on our feet and
[23:39] chest. He would make soup, get medicine,
[23:43] or whatever we needed, he would get. I'm
[23:46] glad my wife's not here right now.
[23:50] I don't think I want to be held to that
[23:51] standard.
[23:54] He would get everything that we needed.
[23:57] And with every family member that he
[23:59] that passed, he was there to comfort me.
[24:02] For every nightmare I had, he was there
[24:05] to hold me. For every fear I had about
[24:08] change, he would tell me, "Everything
[24:12] is going to be okay." And it is,
[24:15] Stephanie. Everything's going to be
[24:16] okay. Gilbert had the most raw and
[24:19] genuine personality. You could never be
[24:21] confused on how he was feeling because
[24:23] he was just so straightforward about
[24:25] things. He could befriend anyone, and I
[24:28] mean anyone.
[24:31] The man knew how to talk. And for that
[24:34] gift, he would he could communicate and
[24:37] come off personable and relatable to
[24:39] anyone he met. Over the years of his
[24:42] life, he has made many friends
[24:45] and never was he judgmental to any of
[24:49] their situations.
[24:51] Amen. He had a great amount of
[24:53] compassion and always wanted to help.
[24:56] Lastly, his love for me and his kids was
[25:01] boundless.
[25:03] I know life without him will never be
[25:05] the same. We were going we were together
[25:08] for 17 years which he would boastingly
[25:11] say is over half of his age.
[25:14] We had our own secret sign language to
[25:17] communicate with each other. Later, as
[25:20] time went by, Gilbert was able to read
[25:22] my body language and facial expression
[25:24] and know exactly how I was feeling or
[25:26] what I was about to say. We were like
[25:29] ying and yang, complete opposites, but
[25:32] we completed each other each each other.
[25:35] And with all the flaws we witnessed
[25:37] within each other, we chose to keep
[25:39] fighting and keep loving each other.
[25:42] Gilbert Valenuela,
[25:44] you were enough for me. You are my best
[25:47] friend, and I will forever and always
[25:49] love you. He could hold any instrument
[25:52] and just instinctively know how to play
[25:54] it. He could just hear each note and he
[25:57] had a natural god-given talent. He would
[26:00] serenade me often and create his own
[26:03] music. And he could cook. He loved to go
[26:07] into the kitchen and just experiment
[26:10] with everything, food and drinks and ice
[26:12] cream. He would pull random ingredients
[26:13] and make a delicious soup.
[26:16] He would mix
[26:20] sham shamoy
[26:23] shamoy water
[26:27] tag and I'm really glad my wife's not
[26:28] here because I don't especially don't
[26:31] want to be expected to cook
[26:33] and tuning lemon and who knows what else
[26:36] to make delicious drink. He would dip
[26:38] fruit popsicles in shamoy and sprinkle
[26:42] tajun on top. I can't pronounce it, but
[26:46] you know what it is.
[26:49] White boy up here trying to.
[26:52] He was able to go to San Diego twice, go
[26:55] to the lake with his friends, camped
[26:57] with his mom's side and my side and his
[27:00] friends. He loved the outdoors and
[27:03] animals. He always wanted to go to
[27:05] Alaska and own a place out there away
[27:08] from the busy world.
[27:10] But Stephanie wrote about her beloved
[27:12] partner
[27:14] Gilbert. And you can tell the love
[27:17] coming from what was written. I'd like
[27:20] to
[27:22] mention
[27:23] uh something very important with a
[27:25] funeral. In fact, I think it's the most
[27:26] important thing. We honor those that are
[27:28] gone on. And the cliche saying is that
[27:34] well, you'll see them again or they are
[27:36] in a better place. The reason that we
[27:38] can say that is because of our Lord and
[27:42] Savior Jesus Christ. And that's why we
[27:45] have a promise. If we don't know him, we
[27:48] don't have that promise. But if we do
[27:51] know him, then it is a promise that will
[27:54] hold stronger than anything else in the
[27:56] world. You can count on it. You can
[27:58] bring that to the bank. It will not
[28:00] fail. I want to talk about another young
[28:03] man in the Bible
[28:05] who also died
[28:09] as as young maybe the same age as
[28:12] Gilbert was. That man's name is Lazarus
[28:15] and he was a close friend of our Lord
[28:18] Jesus.
[28:20] Jesus was out with his disciples
[28:24] and they received word from Lazarus's
[28:26] family that hey, your friend is sick.
[28:29] would you come would you come to to the
[28:32] family and and and help him? And Jesus
[28:37] kind of ignored the invitation to come
[28:41] and and visit his friend. Well, his
[28:43] friend got lower and lower
[28:47] and then Jesus made this statement in
[28:50] the book of John chap 11. Jesus said
[28:52] this.
[28:54] He said, "This sickness," speaking of
[28:57] Lazarus, he says, "This sickness is not
[29:01] unto death,
[29:03] but for the glory of God, that the son
[29:05] of God may be glorified in that." So
[29:07] Jesus is saying that his friend's death
[29:10] is not going to result his friend's
[29:12] sickness is not going to result in
[29:14] death.
[29:16] It's going to be it's going to result in
[29:18] something greater. It's going to result
[29:20] in something to be celebrated
[29:23] and not mourn over. And while Lazarus
[29:27] was getting sicker and sicker, Lazarus
[29:30] eventually died.
[29:34] And Jesus is just a few hours few hours
[29:37] away.
[29:39] And the disciples and where they were,
[29:42] they didn't know that Lazarus had died.
[29:46] And Jesus is talking to his disciples
[29:50] and they they may have mentioned,"Well,
[29:52] what about Lazarus? You know, are we
[29:54] going to go see him?" And and Jesus
[29:56] tells his disciples, "Lazarus is
[29:57] sleeping." And they're like, "Oh, good.
[30:00] That's good. You know, he's getting some
[30:02] rest." And and and Jesus says, "No, you
[30:04] don't understand.
[30:06] Lazarus is dead."
[30:09] And then they get on their road and and
[30:12] they go to visit the family at the
[30:15] funeral like we are here now.
[30:20] Now read
[30:22] some of this in the Bible. It says this.
[30:26] These things he said
[30:28] Jesus is talking about Jesus. These
[30:30] things he said that and after he he said
[30:33] that to them he said our friend Lazarus
[30:36] sleeps but I go that I may wake him and
[30:41] his disciples said Lord if he sleeps it
[30:43] he will get well. However Jesus spoke of
[30:45] his death but they thought that he was
[30:48] speaking about taking rest and sleep.
[30:50] Then Jesus said unto them plainly
[30:52] Lazarus is dead and I'm glad for your
[30:55] sakes that I was not there. This is a
[30:58] key key verse. I'm glad that that I
[31:01] wasn't there so that you can believe.
[31:05] Nevertheless, let us go to him. So God
[31:08] is going to use the death of this young
[31:10] man to help others who believe in Jesus.
[31:12] To help others believe in Jesus
[31:15] because he says so that you may also
[31:17] believe.
[31:18] And I can say the same with Gilbert. I
[31:21] pray today that Gilbert may use this
[31:25] death
[31:26] so that others might believe in Jesus.
[31:33] So Jesus goes and and he meets Martha
[31:37] there.
[31:38] Martha comes out to greet him and and he
[31:41] consoles her and he and he and he says
[31:43] that your brother is going to rise
[31:45] again. And Martha says,"I know that he
[31:48] will rise again in the resurrection."
[31:50] And Jesus says to her, listen to this.
[31:54] Jesus says, 'I am the resurrection and
[31:56] the life. He who believes in me, though
[31:58] he may die, he shall live. And whosoever
[32:02] lives and believes and believes in me
[32:06] shall never die.
[32:11] Then he says this, and I asked the
[32:12] congregation.
[32:15] whosoever believes in me shall never go
[32:18] never die. Do you believe this?
[32:23] And I asked the congregation today, do
[32:26] you believe it? That he who believes in
[32:28] Jesus shall never die.
[32:31] Then Martha's sister Mary
[32:34] comes out to meet Jesus and she's really
[32:37] upset as you can imagine.
[32:39] Then when Mary came where Jesus was and
[32:41] saw him, she fell down at his feet
[32:43] saying, "Lord, if you had been here, my
[32:46] brother would not have died."
[32:49] So how could Jesus,
[32:53] if he is God, how could Jesus just allow
[32:57] this young man like this to pass away
[32:59] and leave his family? The question in
[33:02] Mary's mind was a question that all of
[33:04] us might wonder. Lord, how could how
[33:07] could you do this to me? How could you
[33:10] take this man who seemed to be wonderful
[33:13] and and and we've heard Stephanie's
[33:16] testimony of him. He was he was great.
[33:18] How could you take him and how could you
[33:20] leave me here? Well, Jesus has a purpose
[33:23] here with Lazarus with the passing of
[33:26] Lazarus. Remember in verse four that I
[33:27] said he said, "This sickness is not
[33:30] leading to death." But then he died.
[33:34] How can Jesus say that this situation of
[33:36] the death of this young man is is not
[33:39] it's not about death but really it is
[33:42] about life
[33:45] and somehow today
[33:49] we see this scenario of Lazarus and his
[33:51] death up until this point
[33:55] and all of us should put ourselves in
[33:57] that situation this morning
[34:00] when you heard maybe that Gilbert was in
[34:04] was in trouble. Esther texted me
[34:08] um or I believe it was uh
[34:12] Elizabeth Garrett texted me and said,
[34:15] "Go to prayer
[34:17] because Gilbert um Gilbert's in a
[34:20] serious situation. He had a heart attack
[34:22] and then I talked to you a little while
[34:24] afterwards." Well, where were you when
[34:26] all this happened? Where did you where
[34:28] did you hear this?
[34:30] And then this turn of events starts
[34:34] and then we hear or maybe you were
[34:36] there. We hear that the young man had
[34:40] passed away.
[34:42] And then we go through the week as the
[34:45] as the disciples were in their journeys
[34:47] and and what they were doing. All of us,
[34:50] we go through this week and we're
[34:51] thinking about Gilbert and we're missing
[34:52] him and and maybe we're weeping and
[34:54] we're mourning and and this is all
[34:56] leading up to a point as with the
[34:58] disciples. They they went to the grave
[35:00] of Lazarus. This was all leading up to
[35:02] something very special. And for us, this
[35:05] past week has been leading up to
[35:07] something very special and leading up to
[35:08] this very day right here where we are
[35:11] individuals. All of you have a walk that
[35:13] you have walked this past week leading
[35:16] to this very point.
[35:19] And this point could be a moment not of
[35:24] mourning
[35:25] but it could be a point of great joy.
[35:31] Remember Jesus said this sickness is not
[35:33] un to death unto death but for the glory
[35:36] of God that the son of God might be
[35:38] glorified through this.
[35:40] It's the same with Gilbert.
[35:43] This sickness and this death what
[35:45] happened? It is not about death.
[35:49] It is about that we would be able to
[35:51] rejoice in something great that Jesus is
[35:53] doing.
[35:56] Therefore, when Jesus saw her weeping,
[35:58] speaking of Martha or Mary, and the Jews
[36:00] who came with her weeping, he groaned in
[36:04] the spirit and was troubled.
[36:07] Remember Jesus already said, he said
[36:10] earlier that Lazarus is just sleeping.
[36:12] And I didn't read this part. He said
[36:14] that I'm going to go wake him.
[36:17] And now even Jesus is mourning the loss
[36:19] of his friend. Even though he knows he's
[36:21] going to rise again, even though we know
[36:23] that Gilbert's going to rise again, we
[36:24] know that we're going to see him again,
[36:26] we still can mourn. Jesus Christ, God in
[36:29] flesh, mourned the loss of his his
[36:31] friend. So it's not bad that we're sad.
[36:33] It's not bad that that these emotions
[36:36] are coming out. That's fine. That's
[36:38] normal. Even God in flesh did it.
[36:42] And they said, 'Lord,
[36:44] and then uh Jesus, he groaned in his
[36:46] spirit and he was troubled and he said,
[36:47] 'Where have you laid him? And they said
[36:50] to him, Lord, come and see. And then
[36:53] Jesus wept.
[36:57] The Jews said, "Look, see how he loved
[36:59] him." And one of them said, "Could not
[37:02] this man who opened the eyes of the
[37:03] blind also have kept this man from
[37:05] dying?"
[37:08] They're looking at Jesus. It's like,
[37:10] "I've seen him raise the dead. I've seen
[37:12] him give eye give sight to the blind.
[37:14] Well, why didn't he heal our loved one?
[37:18] When I prayed for him, maybe Sister
[37:20] Esther, when you prayed for him or or
[37:22] sister Stephanie, when you prayed for
[37:23] him, why didn't he raise him up?
[37:26] And it's easy. That's an easy question
[37:28] to ask. And that's what was asked here.
[37:31] Then Jesus again groaning in himself
[37:36] came to the tomb. It was a cave and a
[37:39] stone lay against it. And Jesus said,
[37:42] "Take away the stone."
[37:46] Then Martha, the sister of him who was
[37:47] dead, said, 'Lord,
[37:49] by this time there's a stench, for he's
[37:51] been dead for 4 days. And Jesus said to
[37:54] her, "Did I not say to you that if you
[37:57] believe, you will see the glory of God?"
[38:00] Then they took away the stone from the
[38:02] place where the dead man was laying. And
[38:04] Jesus lifted up his eyes and said,
[38:06] "Father, I thank you that you have heard
[38:08] me and I know that you always hear me,
[38:11] but because of the people who are
[38:13] standing by, I said this that they may
[38:16] believe that you sent me." So he's
[38:19] saying right here, this whole thing is
[38:20] because not of La because of Lazarus and
[38:24] not because of Gilbert. This whole thing
[38:26] is for all of us.
[38:30] Gilbert's in a better place.
[38:32] He's not worried about us right now.
[38:35] We're the one worried.
[38:37] But because of the people who are
[38:39] standing by, I said this that they may
[38:43] believe you sent me the father. Jesus
[38:46] speaking to the father saying, "Lord,
[38:48] this is this is about why I came to the
[38:51] earth."
[38:53] Now when he had said these things, he
[38:55] cried with a loud voice, "Lazarus, come
[38:57] forth." And he who had died came out
[39:01] bound hand and foot with grave clothes
[39:04] and his face was wrapped with a cloth.
[39:07] Jesus said to them, "Loose him and let
[39:09] him go."
[39:12] Imagine
[39:14] that God took the death of this young
[39:18] man and turned it into a testimony to
[39:22] lead souls to Christ.
[39:26] In Jesus's very words again, I'll read
[39:28] it again. Father, I thank you that you
[39:30] have heard me. And I know that you
[39:32] always hear me because of the people who
[39:35] are standing by. I said that they may
[39:38] believe that you sent me.
[39:42] The passing of Gilbert
[39:45] is so
[39:48] that we that there are people here in
[39:50] this congregation that they might
[39:52] believe that that God is real, that
[39:54] Jesus is real, and that this opportunity
[39:59] is for me to make a decision in my life
[40:03] that I will follow this man, Jesus
[40:06] Christ. Don't worry about the churches.
[40:09] Don't worry about all the all the
[40:11] negative that you might see in
[40:12] Christianity. Don't worry about that
[40:14] because there is a real Christianity.
[40:16] There is a real Jesus Christ that is
[40:19] alive and that wants us to come to him.
[40:23] And then with him comes promises. Yes,
[40:26] I'll see Gilbert again, but that's not
[40:28] the best promise. Yes, I will see my
[40:30] loved ones again that have passed passed
[40:32] me on, but that's not the best promise.
[40:34] Yes, my family, although we may be
[40:36] united now, we will be united for
[40:38] eternity. But that's not the best
[40:39] promise. The best promise is that we
[40:41] will be in the presence of our savior
[40:45] for eternity.
[40:48] And where he wherever he is, we're safe.
[40:51] And there is joy wherever he is. There's
[40:54] liberty wherever Jesus is. There's peace
[40:58] wherever Jesus is.
[41:00] And friends, as I close, please
[41:04] Think about what's happened over these
[41:08] past few days from the death of Gilbert
[41:13] to this point. And walk yourself through
[41:17] what has happened as the disciples did.
[41:20] They say, "Oh, we were here. We heard
[41:22] the news. Then we were over here. We
[41:24] heard the news again. And then we came
[41:26] back. And now we are at the funeral. And
[41:28] now God wants to do something that's
[41:30] greater than anything in the world,
[41:33] which is to give me eternal life, which
[41:36] is to bring life. He brought life to
[41:38] Lazarus when he came out of the tomb,
[41:39] but it wasn't as important as as what we
[41:42] are here today because you know what?
[41:43] Lazarus died again.
[41:46] He got old and he died.
[41:49] But he had a promise to live eternally.
[41:53] And we have that promise. So please
[41:56] friends, consider consider the
[41:58] importance of this funeral. Consider the
[42:01] importance of what's happened over the
[42:04] past few days and consider giving your
[42:08] heart, your life to Jesus Christ. It's
[42:12] not about, well, I got to give up this
[42:15] and I got to give up that and if I'm
[42:17] going to be a Christian, I got to stop
[42:18] doing this and stop doing that. Don't
[42:20] worry about those things.
[42:22] Set those things aside.
[42:25] All Jesus wants is for you to come to
[42:27] him
[42:29] and say, "Lord, I come to you and I am
[42:31] full of flaws. I'm full of faults. I'm
[42:35] full of sins."
[42:37] But imagine,
[42:39] Sister Stephanie, imagine if your kids
[42:42] came to you and said, "Mom, I've done
[42:44] this wrong and this wrong and this
[42:46] wrong, and I'm sorry." Said, "Come here,
[42:48] sweetheart.
[42:50] Come here, my son. Come here, my
[42:51] daughter. That's okay. It's why I'm
[42:53] Jesus.
[42:55] That's why I'm That's why I'm called the
[42:57] savior.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; I can take those sins. I just want you
[43:01] to come to me. I'll take the other stuff
[43:03] on myself. You just come to me.
[43:07] For those of you who haven't made that
[43:09] decision and and those of you that have
[43:11] made that decision, all of us here,
[43:15] every person present, please consider
[43:19] the purpose
[43:21] of this loss that we have lost and
[43:25] consider that this could be the greatest
[43:28] blessing that you have ever received in
[43:31] your whole life because it could mean a
[43:34] change in your life where now Sorrow
[43:39] can be replaced by joy. Sorrow of losing
[43:42] someone. Jesus mourned. It's okay.
[43:45] That's part of it. We should mourn.
[43:48] But there will be joy with that
[43:50] mourning. There will be happiness with
[43:52] that mourning. There it's like, Lord,
[43:55] here I am. I wish I could have seen
[43:58] Lazarus come out of that grave. I wish I
[44:00] could have been there. But the same
[44:02] Jesus Christ, he said, I am the same
[44:04] yesterday and today and forever. The
[44:06] same Jesus that was there is the same
[44:09] Jesus that can touch you and in your
[44:13] life. Just come to him. Bring your sins.
[44:16] Bring them with you and say, "Lord, here
[44:18] they are."
[44:20] And he says, "Listen, sweetheart. Come
[44:22] here. I love you. Don't worry about
[44:25] those. Just come to me." Jesus said, and
[44:29] I'll close with this, and I I don't know
[44:31] what is the next on the order of
[44:32] service, but I I'll close with this.
[44:35] that
[44:38] Jesus said,
[44:40] "Come to me
[44:42] all you that labor and are heavy laden.
[44:47] Come to me all you that are working and
[44:50] you're carrying a heavy load." And he
[44:53] said, "And I will give you rest."
[44:56] Consider it friends. Amen. Let's sing
[44:59] Amazing Grace there.
[45:02] Amazing
[45:15] grace,
[45:18] how sweet
[45:20] the sound
[45:23] that save
[45:26] a wrench
[45:28] like me.
[45:33] I once
[45:36] was lost
[45:39] but now
[45:41] am found.
[45:44] Was blind
[45:47] but now
[45:49] I see.
[45:55] Now, as we go forward, the eulogy
[45:58] done by Jacob Valencia. I'm sorry,
[46:01] Valenuela.
[46:03] Somebody printed this really, really
[46:05] small.
[46:07] So, here you
[46:21] like to thank you all for coming and
[46:23] honoring my nephew
[46:25] Gilberella
[46:28] survived by his spouse Stephanie Cortas
[46:32] and his three children Sarah Grayson
[46:35] Nimalia
[46:38] and also by his father Ger Venuela and
[46:41] his mother's Esther Gar and his brother
[46:44] Jared Vanella
[46:48] and he was a beautiful person and
[46:51] he was um he felt like a son to me you
[46:53] know I I've um ever since he was a baby,
[46:56] I remember holding him, feeling, you
[46:59] know, smelling his skin, giving him a
[47:00] bath, taking him for walks, teaching him
[47:03] play piano, you know, he's super
[47:04] talented and um
[47:08] he's always demonstrated that all
[47:09] throughout his life, but he also had a
[47:12] huge heart and uh and he always wanted
[47:16] what was best. You know, he tried really
[47:18] hard for his family. He loved his kids
[47:21] and often we would get together and you
[47:24] know he bring his kids along with us. We
[47:26] go out to the he loved the outdoors and
[47:28] the wilderness and we go on hikes and
[47:30] hang out and with all the boys, you
[47:32] know, do the boy stuff and
[47:35] we had some so many good times together
[47:39] and and um I've always been impressed
[47:41] with him and
[47:43] you know I would we talk a lot on the
[47:45] phone, you know, and share our problems
[47:47] and share our joys as well and and he's
[47:50] super intelligent, you know, and he a
[47:52] lot of times I find myself asking him
[47:54] questions, you know, what do you think
[47:54] about this? what do you think about
[47:55] this? And he would he would talk to
[47:57] uncle be careful. Don't don't don't
[48:00] think about that too much. It's not good
[48:01] for you. You know, and um and he was
[48:04] very religious too. You know, we we talk
[48:06] for hours and we start getting to you
[48:09] know, scripture and and you know, times
[48:12] that we had with our family, you know,
[48:14] he respected and loved his grandparents
[48:16] very much and they set such a great
[48:18] example for all of us and for him as
[48:20] well. And then he remembered the
[48:22] teachings my dad would, you know, teach
[48:25] and and share with him and growing up.
[48:27] And um and so you know we found a lot of
[48:30] realizations and
[48:33] talking about just the times and you
[48:36] know and the examples we had growing up
[48:39] and
[48:41] but u yeah it's him and Jared and my
[48:43] brother Joseph and we're all closer in
[48:46] age so we we had a lot of time hanging
[48:48] out together and
[48:51] and he was he was such a talented you
[48:54] know and I had asked uh Steph if you
[48:56] know if she want to say something
[48:58] because so Evans took all my words
[49:01] because I was going to share what Steph
[49:02] said but I said that's beautiful. I
[49:04] said, you know, that's exactly what Nate
[49:06] was. You know, he had a huge heart. He
[49:08] had a memory like an elephant. He was
[49:10] incredible. I would teach him a song
[49:11] and, you know, by by road and he would
[49:14] just memorize everything and he would
[49:16] continue playing. He had such good
[49:18] sensibilities and until recently we
[49:20] were, you know, I told him, "Hey, you
[49:21] want to start a rea band?" And he said,
[49:23] "Yeah, love rea." So, I was like, "Okay,
[49:25] let's do this." You know, but he was so
[49:28] much fun to hang around with and I'm
[49:29] going to miss him as I'm sure many of
[49:32] you will.
[49:42] I just thank God for our family and for
[49:45] all the support that we've had and I
[49:47] think all of you as well for showing
[49:48] your support we the last week we've all
[49:51] been spending time with each other and I
[49:53] think it's really important that we
[49:54] stick together and you know help each
[49:56] other lean on each other cry on each
[49:58] other it's healthy it's good for you and
[50:01] I think this helped I don't think I'd be
[50:03] able to be up here if it wasn't for that
[50:04] and for hanging out with Jared and and
[50:06] having these long nights of, you know,
[50:08] talking and talking about all the great
[50:10] things that we experienced with with
[50:12] Nate, good and bad. I mean, we it was he
[50:15] was just a special soul, you know, and I
[50:17] think everybody realized that, you know,
[50:19] his friends and family, everybody saw
[50:21] that in him. He was such a strong
[50:22] person. He had a strong backbone, you
[50:24] know, and he did he stood up to
[50:26] everything, you know, and he's he's uh
[50:31] and so I just I want to thank every I
[50:32] want to thank my family for all your
[50:34] support cuz this is it was really
[50:35] difficult to lose someone like like
[50:37] Nate.
[50:40] He's one of a kind.
[50:43] We're going to miss him. I love you,
[50:44] Nate.
[50:46] until we see each other again.
[50:52] Oh, thank you.
[51:03] Now they're going to play a song in
[51:06] their instruments. The title of the song
[51:08] is Messiah. So, we put everything way
[51:11] past beyond the sun. But God said, "I'll
[51:15] be with you, even in you." He'll be
[51:17] close by.
[54:17] Heat.
[54:41] Hey. Hey. Hey.
[54:44] Heat.
[54:59] Heat.
[55:06] Heat.
[55:23] Heat.
[55:57] Heat.
[56:14] Heat.
[56:37] If uh Michael Contreres would make his
[56:40] way up too. I would say that's not the
[56:43] first time they'd played before. That
[56:46] was very well done. A tribute and an
[56:48] honor.
[56:56] The Lord is my shall not want. He maketh
[57:00] me to lie down in pastures. He leadth me
[57:04] beside the still waters.
[57:07] He resto my soul. He leadth me into
[57:12] paths of righteousness for his name's
[57:15] sake.
[57:16] Ye do I walk through the valley of the
[57:19] shadow of death. I will fear no evil,
[57:22] for thou art with me. Thy rod and thy
[57:26] staff, they comfort me. Thou preparest a
[57:30] table before me in the presence of mine
[57:32] enemies.
[57:34] Thou anointest my head with oil. My cup
[57:38] runth over. Surely goodness and mercy
[57:42] shall follow me all the days of my life,
[57:45] and I shall dwell in the house of the
[57:48] Lord forever.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; What this young man read is the word of
[58:02] God
[58:03] &gt;&gt; and it's true. Amen. We have uh
[58:08] listed as Sarah, but Sarah was not
[58:11] feeling well. So,
[58:14] Josiah and Katie.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; I did that at my dad's memorial, too. I
[58:24] missed the pictures. I'm sorry. I'm two
[58:28] for two on that one.
[1:01:43] Clean up.
[1:02:06] Good.
[1:02:43] I'm kind of homeick
[1:02:50] for a country
[1:02:56] to where I've Never
[1:03:03] been before.
[1:03:09] No sad goodbye.
[1:03:15] Will there be spoken?
[1:03:22] For time won't matter
[1:03:28] anymore.
[1:03:40] I'm longing for you.
[1:03:47] And someday
[1:03:53] on the
[1:03:55] day
[1:03:59] there my home
[1:04:05] shall be eternal
[1:04:14] land.
[1:04:18] Sweet
[1:04:20] land.
[1:04:24] I'm looking now
[1:04:30] across the river
[1:04:37] where my faith
[1:04:42] will end in sight.
[1:04:48] There's just a few
[1:04:54] more days to labor.
[1:05:01] Then I'll take
[1:05:06] my heavenly
[1:05:08] flight.
[1:05:13] you land.
[1:05:18] I'm longing for
[1:05:22] you.
[1:05:25] And someday
[1:05:31] on the I stand
[1:05:37] there. My home
[1:05:43] shall be eternal.
[1:05:50] Bu
[1:05:55] sweet
[1:05:57] land.
[1:06:26] I can only imagine
[1:06:30] what it will be like
[1:06:33] when I walk
[1:06:36] by your side.
[1:06:39] I can only imagine
[1:06:42] what my eyes will see
[1:06:46] when your face
[1:06:49] is before me.
[1:06:52] I can only imagine
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; surrounded by your glory.
[1:07:02] What will my heart feel? Will I dance
[1:07:06] for you, Jesus?
[1:07:08] or in all of you be still. Will I stand
[1:07:12] in your presence or to my knees will I
[1:07:16] fall? Will I sing hallelujah?
[1:07:20] Will I be able to speak it all? I can
[1:07:23] only imagine.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; I can only imagine.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; I can only imagine.
[1:07:38] When that day comes
[1:07:42] and I find myself
[1:07:45] standing in the sun, I can only imagine
[1:07:51] when all I will do
[1:07:54] is forever
[1:07:57] forever worship you. I can only imagine.
[1:08:05] Oh,
[1:08:06] surrounded by your glory, but will my
[1:08:11] heart feel. Will I dance for you, Jesus?
[1:08:15] Or in all of you, be still. Will I stand
[1:08:19] in your presence? Or to my knees, will I
[1:08:23] fall? Will I sing hallelujah? Will I be
[1:08:28] able to speak it all? I can only
[1:08:31] imagine.
[1:08:34] Oh, I can only imagine.
[1:08:42] Surrounded by your glory. What will my
[1:08:46] heart feel? Will I dance for you, Jesus,
[1:08:50] or in all of you be still? Will I stand
[1:08:54] in your presence or to my knees? Will I
[1:08:58] fall? Will I sing hallelujah?
[1:09:02] Will I be able to speak it all? I can
[1:09:05] only imagine.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; I can only imagine.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; I can only imagine.
[1:09:20] When all I will do
[1:09:23] is forever,
[1:09:25] forever worship you.
[1:09:29] I can only imagine.
[1:09:47] Can only imagine.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; Just make sure you're there that day and
[1:09:51] it won't be an imagination anymore, but
[1:09:53] it'll be a reality.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; And he makes an invite to you. Come,
[1:09:59] come. He says, I will receive you. You
[1:10:02] don't have to be perfect to come to him
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; because none of us could come if we
[1:10:09] were, but if you'll come to him, he'll
[1:10:11] take care of situations.
[1:10:14] Now, as we we come to the end here
[1:10:18] and um
[1:10:21] again, I would say thank you as part of
[1:10:23] the family. All the family appreciates
[1:10:25] you being here showing your support,
[1:10:28] your love.
[1:10:30] But it doesn't end today.
[1:10:33] As many as as you can, as you often as
[1:10:35] you can remember them, greet them, lift
[1:10:40] them up, be a friend to them.
[1:10:43] So
[1:10:47] as we just let's just close our eyes and
[1:10:49] just and sometimes you have somebody
[1:10:52] leading the prayer but you pray too.
[1:10:56] You give your prayers towards a family
[1:10:58] and just ask God to
[1:11:01] to keep this day. Lord, as as we as we
[1:11:05] come to a finish here to an end
[1:11:10] and remembering this young man, part of
[1:11:13] the family and hearing the tribute that
[1:11:18] was given to him and to the family.
[1:11:20] Lord, it's it's it's good to hear the
[1:11:23] good things, the wonderful things,
[1:11:26] and that's just because you're good to
[1:11:28] us, Lord.
[1:11:30] But now as as the days go on and the
[1:11:33] memories come back and
[1:11:36] times get hard, Lord, let us take time
[1:11:39] to reach out to one another.
[1:11:42] Encourage
[1:11:44] especially the family in this day, in
[1:11:46] this hour, Lord. And if anyone here,
[1:11:50] Lord, that has heard something about you
[1:11:52] that's made their heart want to desire
[1:11:55] to know you, may they just ask. Ask
[1:11:59] someone who knows you and let us share
[1:12:01] that with them. The God that's alive,
[1:12:05] the same Jesus that spoke to Lazarus
[1:12:08] said, "Come out. You're still the same
[1:12:11] yesterday, today, and forever, Lord."
[1:12:13] So, we just want to say, "Thank you for
[1:12:17] being mindful of the family."
[1:12:20] And Lord, may we be able to be with them
[1:12:22] and strengthen them, encourage them,
[1:12:24] Lord, in this time as they go through,
[1:12:26] Lord, as we commit the rest of this day
[1:12:29] to you in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:12:32] Christ.
[1:12:34] The head of finishing song is when we
[1:12:37] all get to heaven.
[1:12:40] If you'll stand, we'll sing that
[1:12:41] together.
[1:12:43] You'll leave that there. Thank you.
[1:12:48] Sing the wondous
[1:12:52] love of Jesus.
[1:12:56] Sing his mercy
[1:13:00] and his grace
[1:13:04] in the manions
[1:13:08] bright and blessed.
[1:13:12] will prepare for us a place
[1:13:18] when we all
[1:13:22] get to heaven.
[1:13:26] What a day of rejoicing that will be
[1:13:33] when we all
[1:13:36] see Jesus
[1:13:40] will sing and shout the victory.
[1:13:48] While we walk the pilgrim
[1:13:53] pathway,
[1:13:54] clouds will over
[1:13:58] spread the sky.
[1:14:01] But when traveling
[1:14:04] days are over,
[1:14:08] not a shadow, not a sigh.
[1:14:13] Oh, when we all
[1:14:16] get to heaven,
[1:14:20] what a day of rejoicing that will be
[1:14:26] when we all
[1:14:30] see Jesus.
[1:14:33] will sing and shout the victory
[1:14:39] when we all
[1:14:43] get to heaven.
[1:14:46] What a day of rejoicing that will be
[1:14:52] when we all
[1:14:56] see Jesus.
[1:14:59] will sing and shout the victory.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Main thing is let's make sure
[1:15:08] we're there
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; when we all get to heaven. That means
[1:15:11] everybody here, let's make sure we all
[1:15:13] get there and that we are all able to
[1:15:15] sing and shout the victory when we get
[1:15:17] there. Now friends, we've honored our
[1:15:21] brother
[1:15:23] and I hope that as you leave today, I
[1:15:27] hope that something that was said will
[1:15:29] make you think
[1:15:33] and ask the Lord, Lord, am I right with
[1:15:35] you?
[1:15:37] Is my soul right with you, Lord? And
[1:15:40] when we do, when we all get to heaven,
[1:15:42] Lord, am I going to be there?
[1:15:45] And if there's something in your heart
[1:15:48] that you see that is preventing you from
[1:15:51] being there, we have ministers here. We
[1:15:53] have brother Aaron here. I'm here.
[1:15:57] Make sure, friends, don't let it go.
[1:15:59] Don't let it rest until you make that
[1:16:02] decision. And then once you make that
[1:16:04] decision to follow Jesus, then you have
[1:16:06] a promise. Lord, I'm going to be there.
[1:16:09] God bless you. Please, as brother Aaron
[1:16:11] said, don't forget the family.
[1:16:13] we're going to they'll get through this
[1:16:15] day and then there is going to be a void
[1:16:17] in their life forever now until we get
[1:16:21] to the other side and until we meet this
[1:16:24] lost loved one uh not lost from the Lord
[1:16:28] but lost from our immediate uh presence.
[1:16:32] So make sure to pray for the family.
[1:16:34] Make sure to reach out to the family in
[1:16:35] the future because they're going to need
[1:16:37] you. As I said, there's a void there.
[1:16:40] Let's fill that void. All right,
[1:16:42] friends. God bless you. We have we have
[1:16:45] food afterwards. Let's bow our heads one
[1:16:47] more time. Father,
[1:16:49] we ask that your blessings are dressed
[1:16:51] upon the food that we're going to take.
[1:16:53] And then once again, Lord, that you
[1:16:55] would bless the family. Bless Stephanie.
[1:16:59] Lord, strengthen her. Lord, may the
[1:17:02] presence that is missing in her life be
[1:17:05] replaced by the presence of the Holy
[1:17:07] Spirit comforting her and guiding her.
[1:17:09] Bless the children.
[1:17:12] May the Holy Spirit as they get older,
[1:17:16] may it guide them, protect them, and be
[1:17:19] with them. Bless the mom, sister Esther,
[1:17:22] father, be with her, be with the dad.
[1:17:24] And Lord, we pray that your blessings as
[1:17:28] would rest upon the food and upon the
[1:17:30] remainder of the day. And Lord, we love
[1:17:33] you and we thank you for all that you do
[1:17:35] for us in Jesus name. Amen. God bless
[1:17:38] you. You're dismissed. You're welcome to
[1:17:41] greet the family here and uh and the
[1:17:43] food if you go out through the back door
[1:17:45] there probably where you came in. The
[1:17:47] fellowship hall is right on the other
[1:17:48] side of the wall here. God bless you.
[1:18:10] true
[1:18:16] every day.
[1:18:19] Just one glimpse of
[1:18:24] glory.
[1:18:26] All the doors of life
[1:18:31] when we open.
[1:19:12] Hallelujah.
[1:19:18] Heat. Heat.
[1:19:59] Heat. Heat.
[1:20:32] Hallelujah.
