[39:33] here that that um it's a blessing it's a
[39:36] blessing to have
[39:38] everyone that uh will come and visit us
[39:41] we always appreciate that I was
[39:45] um before we get into our scriptures I
[39:47] was talking with Daniel um my son and
[39:51] we're we're close and we uh we
[39:53] Fellowship a lot and Daniel was giving
[39:55] me a testimony oh it's good to see the
[39:56] numer girls I'm glad so Daniel took took
[39:59] these girls on like a 15 M hike
[40:03] yesterday and sister Lily over there so
[40:06] it's good to see everybody survived and
[40:08] made it um we uh yeah they
[40:15] uh sometimes you bite off a little bit
[40:18] more than you can Che I know I have with
[40:19] my son
[40:20] before um but Daniel and I were talking
[40:23] the other day and Daniel was telling me
[40:24] about a testimony that someone that he
[40:28] works with had given
[40:30] him and she talked about
[40:34] church is she here okay she talked about
[40:38] church and she told Daniel she said she
[40:42] says one of the reasons that so many
[40:45] young people are leaving today so many
[40:48] young people don't go to church anymore
[40:50] that that they don't really want much to
[40:52] do with religion they might say they're
[40:54] a a Christian just just to say it but
[40:57] they don't necessarily want to be want
[41:00] to give more and she said it's because
[41:04] that
[41:05] Christianity that the
[41:08] Bible has become like a book of stories
[41:12] to them it's become just Daniel and the
[41:16] Lion's Den and no and the Ark and David
[41:19] and Goliath and it's has morphed into
[41:24] almost a bunch of fairy tales and and
[41:27] they have left out the
[41:30] teaching that is is held inside the
[41:34] Bible and it's now it's just like any
[41:37] other story and they not coming to
[41:41] church they don't understand that there
[41:43] are very very powerful lessons that are
[41:46] in the book lessons life lessons that
[41:49] are to be learned and to be
[41:51] taught and in and Daniel telling me that
[41:54] that was on my mind all week and and
[41:57] then with Brother on Wednesday night I
[42:01] was really blessed by Brother Lyle in
[42:03] our Wednesday night bible study when he
[42:06] spoke on 2
[42:08] Chronicles and just the stories that are
[42:11] in there and how these this Bible should
[42:15] be
[42:16] applied and and he told the story about
[42:19] this King Josiah which I'm going to get
[42:22] to here in a little
[42:24] bit and all week thinking on on that
[42:30] testimony that Daniel said and how the
[42:33] enemy likes to get in and he likes to
[42:38] take away our fellowship he likes to
[42:41] take away our reading of the word I was
[42:45] I gave the testimony Wednesday night
[42:46] that when I'd go to the tire
[42:49] shop or anywhere else that I knew I was
[42:51] going to have some time I'd bring this
[42:53] book with me and anytime I had some time
[42:56] to wait I would open open it up and I
[42:57] I'd read it if I was on an airplane I
[42:59] was traveling or if I was really
[43:02] anywhere I could open this Bible and
[43:05] start reading but now this Bible has
[43:08] been
[43:09] replaced by this right here on and now
[43:14] we we have entertainment with us all the
[43:16] time we have something to do all the
[43:17] time because we can just look at our
[43:19] phone and now we can read our Bibles and
[43:23] we can listen to sermons and and do
[43:25] these things but we don't do it enough
[43:27] enough when you have your phone how much
[43:29] what percentage of your time is spent
[43:32] studying your Bible on your phone versus
[43:35] other
[43:36] things the devil's very very Sly in what
[43:40] he does and really I see that his
[43:43] ultimate goal is to take the word away
[43:47] from the people because it it's a
[43:49] constant correction and if they don't
[43:51] know the word if they haven't been in
[43:53] the word then it it divides up
[43:57] a
[43:58] family in in first
[44:02] John it the the Apostle says he says
[44:06] children it is the last hour it is the
[44:10] end time and he says as you have heard
[44:12] that the Antichrist is coming so now
[44:14] many antichrists have come
[44:17] already and
[44:19] therefore we know that it's the last
[44:22] hour John says he says these antichrists
[44:25] are already here what's he talking
[44:29] about brothers and sisters they're very
[44:31] very common I'd be willing to
[44:35] bet
[44:37] that almost everyone in this
[44:41] congregation has witnessed that very
[44:44] thing but it doesn't a lot of times we
[44:46] don't recognize it because it doesn't
[44:48] come these antichrists don't come in the
[44:50] way that we think that they should come
[44:52] we think that it should be the pope and
[44:53] walking down the aisle and and doing
[44:56] doing these great things but what it is
[44:58] is it's planting a seed of discrepancy
[45:02] in us and it's always something that
[45:05] separates us from the Lord Jesus it's
[45:09] something that the enemy puts in there
[45:12] and it could be a pastor it could be a
[45:14] prophet it could be a priest it could be
[45:16] anything and you say that you have to
[45:19] come through
[45:20] this to get to
[45:23] Christ and then it becomes Antichrist
[45:27] because there is only one mediator
[45:29] between God and man the man Christ
[45:32] Jesus wait I was last night I was
[45:38] studying and that TV show I Love Lucy
[45:43] kept coming to my
[45:45] mind and you know we look at that show
[45:48] and how many times have we heard brother
[45:49] brandom talk about I Love Lucy and it's
[45:52] like oh you know he just made this thing
[45:54] just to be this terrible show and we
[45:57] look at it now and we say oh you know
[45:58] it's just it shows you how bad the days
[46:01] are today because look at how innocent
[46:03] that show was back then and how much
[46:05] brother Bram talked about it but it was
[46:07] not
[46:08] innocent it was the farthest thing from
[46:10] innocent first of all it made a man the
[46:14] head of the household it made him look
[46:16] like a
[46:18] buffoon always making fun of him and
[46:20] joking about him and and and their
[46:23] neighbor that that he was this this
[46:26] stupid person and the wife was the boss
[46:29] and and it started making fun of the
[46:33] family unit and not only that but this
[46:37] show I think it was probably the first
[46:39] time was on every single
[46:42] day and it was on the same time at prime
[46:45] time every day and what it did is it
[46:49] started to
[46:51] repace that family time that all the
[46:54] families had and they would come
[46:56] together maybe they would eat supper or
[46:58] they would read their Bibles this show
[47:01] comes in and it replaces that and not
[47:05] only does it replace that but on
[47:07] Wednesday
[47:09] night the people wanted to see the show
[47:13] back then there wasn't there weren't any
[47:14] DVRs or there was no internet there was
[47:16] any of that if you missed I Love Lucy
[47:18] man you were stuck you didn't get to see
[47:21] it anymore and
[47:24] then they were the I think this was one
[47:26] of the First shows that had
[47:28] reruns so when the season was over then
[47:31] they went back and just played it over
[47:32] again and now they it looks so common to
[47:36] us but what it was it was to break the
[47:38] ice for the future and remember Satan's
[47:41] been around for a long time and one of
[47:44] Satan's biggest strengths one of the
[47:47] things that he is the best at is he is
[47:49] very
[47:50] patient and he knows if he can just slip
[47:54] in a little bit here here and there then
[47:58] it'll start taking hold and eventually
[48:01] and he's got all the time in the world
[48:03] eventually it will come to the place
[48:06] that he wants it which the Bible says
[48:09] that he is the God of this evil world of
[48:13] this
[48:14] world so when I Love
[48:17] Lucy he started with with getting the
[48:20] people to start focusing on this show
[48:24] rather than focusing on each other
[48:26] rather than focusing on going to church
[48:28] and and coming together and but if you
[48:32] look at
[48:33] it at least the families were
[48:36] together they got together and they
[48:38] watched this television show and now
[48:41] it's not that way now Satan started with
[48:45] that and he and he's continued on and
[48:48] now they all we all go to our rooms or
[48:50] sit on the couch and we have this right
[48:52] here and we all have our own little
[48:54] things going on and now we don't even
[48:56] fellowship with each other with our
[48:59] families he has taken that
[49:02] away like I said at least with the
[49:06] television we all got to be in the same
[49:09] room we all got to kind of laugh
[49:11] together and joke together but
[49:14] now he got his way and it
[49:17] separated the
[49:19] people and he did it with church even
[49:22] recently just in everyone here was alive
[49:26] just a couple years ago with
[49:28] Co he sends this disease into the world
[49:32] that's that starts killing people and
[49:34] once's the first thing we do we stop
[49:36] going to church and then we get lazy wow
[49:40] and when it's no longer a thing
[49:43] anymore the churches are much smaller
[49:45] now and it's because the people kind of
[49:47] like staying home they like doing their
[49:50] own
[49:51] thing when we see these things the Bible
[49:54] teaches us Hebrews chap 10: 23
[49:57] we when we see these things start to
[50:00] happen these signs of the times that
[50:02] come before
[50:04] us the Apostle says this let us hold
[50:07] fast to the profession of our faith
[50:09] without wavering for he is faithful that
[50:12] promised and let us consider what
[50:14] consider one another to provoke unto
[50:16] love and to Good Works not forsaking the
[50:20] assembling of ourselves together as the
[50:21] manner of some
[50:23] is but exhorting one another and so much
[50:28] the more as you see the day approaching
[50:32] so he's saying in the last days he's
[50:33] warning us that in the last days you're
[50:36] going to see this separation among the
[50:39] people I mean it's separation in our
[50:41] homes it's separation in the same
[50:45] room it he's taking away that fellowship
[50:49] and he's saying don't neglect that don't
[50:52] stop coming together don't stop doing
[50:55] our our young young people's things
[50:57] brother Jordan and sister Martha put on
[51:00] something for the Youth yesterday that
[51:01] was just tremendous we had this big
[51:05] thing of Goliath and we got to tell the
[51:07] kids a story about about David and
[51:09] Goliath and they got to act it out and I
[51:11] guarantee you they'll never forget now
[51:14] the details of that story and the main
[51:17] thing though was it brought them all
[51:20] together and we should take every
[51:22] opportunity to do it not just here at
[51:25] church is very important
[51:27] you know now it's like okay I don't have
[51:28] to go to church I can just stay home and
[51:31] stream that's good to stream it's good
[51:36] to listen to sermons on YouTube but that
[51:38] is not going to church that's not
[51:39] assembling yourselves together that's
[51:42] just staying home and not reading your
[51:46] Bible and listening to
[51:48] YouTube and it may be something very
[51:51] good but that doesn't count that's why
[51:54] communion is so important we need to
[51:57] come together and there's many like in
[51:59] this church there's some elderly people
[52:01] that can't come to church so we go we
[52:04] should go to them serve them communion
[52:07] so we can get that little bit of
[52:09] Fellowship so we can assemble ourselves
[52:12] together very important especially as
[52:16] the Apostle says as you see the day
[52:18] approaching there are going to be signs
[52:20] that we
[52:21] see that are going to show us the end is
[52:26] very
[52:26] [Music]
[52:27] near and when we see those signs as we
[52:30] see today when we see those
[52:34] signs don't
[52:36] neglect the assembling of ourselves
[52:38] together come together as much as we can
[52:43] here in church with a group outside of
[52:47] church whenever we can come
[52:53] together I
[52:55] um
[52:57] thinking about
[52:59] this I Love
[53:02] Lucy and what it
[53:04] started I was I travel sometimes and and
[53:08] when when I'm when I'm in the hotel I
[53:10] always turn on the the Box you know and
[53:13] and I want to see something so so I look
[53:15] at it and I you know flip through all
[53:17] these crazy channels and and I can't
[53:19] find anything but one of the things that
[53:20] I notice is
[53:23] how liberal and how just
[53:27] irreverent and dirty the shows are
[53:32] today and even not only that but some of
[53:38] the the things that I grew up with have
[53:42] been so defiled and corrupted that today
[53:46] they're just it's it's
[53:48] disgusting like this
[53:51] company called
[53:53] Disney and what they have done I mean he
[53:57] used to be Pinocchio you know don't lie
[53:59] I that's I got scared to death just like
[54:02] when I saw that when I was a little kid
[54:03] I was like you know he lied again and
[54:06] the Darkness of it and out on the boat
[54:09] and all that scared me to that but it
[54:11] was a good
[54:13] story Snow White the Lion King what a
[54:18] what a good wholesome thing now it has
[54:21] just been it's been corrupted and what
[54:24] it was is here comes the enemy and
[54:27] remember he's patient and he starts
[54:29] slipping things in I want to read
[54:31] something to
[54:33] you and
[54:35] um this is why I wanted
[54:38] the kids to come in a little bit later
[54:41] says
[54:43] this there's this
[54:46] uh this
[54:48] woman named
[54:54] um Latoya
[54:57] Ravenel and she was an executive
[54:59] producer for Disney's television
[55:02] animation she's way she was way up
[55:05] there a couple years ago she did an
[55:07] interview and she talked about
[55:09] how Disney is moving and she says this
[55:13] she says she
[55:16] says she she talked about her
[55:18] Progressive ideas and that how they how
[55:21] Disney the company defied her negative
[55:25] expectations instead of then the article
[55:27] says this instead of vetoing her pitches
[55:30] for lgbtq friendly Easter eggs now an
[55:32] Easter egg is a a subtle thing that
[55:35] happens in the background of a
[55:37] scene or even over references Disney
[55:41] gladly accepted and included them she
[55:46] claimed in my little pocket of Proud
[55:48] Family Disney
[55:50] TVA the showrunners were super welcoming
[55:54] to my not at all secret gay
[55:57] agenda maybe it was the that way in the
[56:01] past but I guess something must have
[56:04] happened at Disney and then like all of
[56:07] that momentum that I felt that sense
[56:10] that I don't have to be afraid to have
[56:12] these two characters Kiss in the
[56:15] background I was just wherever I could
[56:18] added
[56:19] queerness no one would stop me and no
[56:23] one was go was trying to stop me this is
[56:25] dizzy
[56:29] I grew up watching all the classics they
[56:31] have been a huge informative part of my
[56:33] life but at the same time I worked at
[56:36] small Studios most of my career and I'd
[56:38] heard Whispers And I heard things like
[56:41] they won't let you do this at Disney but
[56:43] then my experience was baffing baffing
[56:46] the opposite of what I had heard she
[56:50] said this is a executive at this company
[56:55] Disney that I used to let my kids watch
[56:58] when when they were when they were
[57:00] babies she knew this the influence that
[57:04] Disney had on her upbringing and she
[57:07] wanted to use that same platform to
[57:10] influence the Next Generation and move
[57:13] in a certain direction and to introduce
[57:15] things that were not traditionally
[57:17] accepted in
[57:18] society and that's the world we live in
[57:22] today slowly these things become normal
[57:26] and they're ingrained in our society and
[57:29] the only brothers and sisters the only
[57:31] weapon that we have against it is our
[57:34] family
[57:35] unity and he's taking that out and our
[57:39] family
[57:41] altar I Love Lucy way back started
[57:44] taking that
[57:46] out our home Bible
[57:49] studies where Dad and Mom we sit around
[57:53] and we talk about this book
[57:57] Church slowly taking that out with Co do
[58:00] you see the direction that it's going
[58:03] especially as we see the day
[58:07] approaching I believe it's recorded many
[58:09] times how Israel how they would stray
[58:14] and they would start worshiping Idols
[58:16] we've been going through from Genesis
[58:17] all the way now down to Second
[58:19] Chronicles and it's this thing that
[58:20] keeps happening they keep they they do
[58:24] okay and then all of a sudden I idolatry
[58:27] idolatry Creeps in do you think that
[58:28] they know that they're worshiping Idols
[58:32] as we were talking about before
[58:34] service do you think these Hebrews these
[58:36] Israelites and all that had happened
[58:38] with Moses and everything do you think
[58:41] that as this this these teachings of of
[58:44] balum and all all these these false
[58:46] prophets do you think that they knew
[58:49] that they were idolators or do you think
[58:51] that they thought that they were still
[58:52] Hebrews message
[58:55] believers
[58:56] they still thought that they were
[58:58] genuine Believers but the enemy Creeps
[59:02] in and he slips this stuff in before
[59:07] us brother ly as I said taught on 2
[59:09] Chronicles on Wednesday and he finished
[59:11] with this this young King Josiah and the
[59:15] same thing had happened with Josiah as
[59:18] it happened as what I've talked about
[59:20] has happened right now except it's worse
[59:22] now but the same thing happened with
[59:25] Josiah
[59:28] and as I said earlier Daniel's testimony
[59:32] of how of of this woman how this Bible
[59:34] has become just a bunch of stories and
[59:37] not Doctrine to teach our families it's
[59:42] a
[59:44] shame so this Josiah he he became King
[59:48] when he was eight years old obviously an
[59:50] 8-year-old can't rule a country but he
[59:52] was in line for the kingdom and he was
[59:54] crowned King at that that time and he
[59:56] grew into this position as king and he
[59:58] did a good job and one of the
[1:00:02] things that Josiah noticed is he noticed
[1:00:06] that the temple was in bad shape he
[1:00:09] noticed that there was a lot of things
[1:00:10] that that he needed to fix the door jams
[1:00:12] were probably falling down and and it
[1:00:15] was just it wasn't the way it should be
[1:00:17] so Josiah tasks these contractors he
[1:00:21] says let's get this thing fixed so they
[1:00:24] they get together and this guy runs the
[1:00:28] jobs and they start working on it and
[1:00:32] they needed to be able to pay the bills
[1:00:34] they had to pay the
[1:00:35] contractors so Josiah tells them go look
[1:00:38] in the in these different rooms so they
[1:00:40] go and they're looking for for the
[1:00:42] church treasury they're looking for
[1:00:43] money to to fund to pay these
[1:00:46] contractors to do the work and they
[1:00:49] found
[1:00:50] something that had been lost for many
[1:00:53] years this is one of the saddest things
[1:00:56] that I've read in the Bible and I really
[1:00:58] believe that we have come to this same
[1:01:02] point that Josiah came
[1:01:05] to 2
[1:01:07] Chronicles chapter
[1:01:13] 34 verse
[1:01:17] 15 and hilaya
[1:01:19] answered and said to schaen the Scribe I
[1:01:23] have found the book of the law in the
[1:01:26] house of the Lord and hilaya delivered
[1:01:29] the book to
[1:01:32] shapen I have found a Bible in the
[1:01:36] church that's
[1:01:38] odd but that's what
[1:01:41] happened this was the pentat this was
[1:01:44] the first five books of the Bible this
[1:01:46] was the Bible in their age and tell me
[1:01:49] this how could a church get so far away
[1:01:52] that they don't read the Bible anymore
[1:01:55] wow
[1:01:56] that they're going to
[1:01:57] read other things for the church they're
[1:02:00] going to concentrate on things that are
[1:02:03] not in this book They're going to
[1:02:05] concentrate on things that maybe make
[1:02:07] the people feel good or
[1:02:09] maybe lift the people
[1:02:14] up we're going to read about the sin
[1:02:18] that was there a little bit
[1:02:20] later but it started really
[1:02:24] because
[1:02:26] a generation had passed or a certain
[1:02:27] amount of years had passed and they were
[1:02:30] still worshiping this was still
[1:02:31] church but they stopped concentrating on
[1:02:35] the Bible and they started concentrating
[1:02:38] more on the doctrines of their day so
[1:02:41] then as time went on the Bible got set
[1:02:44] on the
[1:02:45] Shelf got replaced with YouTube or got
[1:02:48] rep replaced
[1:02:50] with quotes or something else and they
[1:02:54] slowly but Sur surely they pushed Satan
[1:02:57] pushed the Bible
[1:03:00] out second Timothy chapter 4 says
[1:03:03] this I charge thee this is the Apostle
[1:03:06] Paul speaking to Timothy and giving him
[1:03:09] this last bit of correction before Paul
[1:03:13] left I charge thee therefore before God
[1:03:16] and the and Jesus Christ who shall judge
[1:03:18] the quick and the dead at his appearing
[1:03:20] in his
[1:03:21] kingdom this time is coming he's saying
[1:03:25] preach the word be instant in season out
[1:03:28] of season reprove rebuke exhort with all
[1:03:31] longsuffering and Doctrine for the time
[1:03:33] will come when they will not endure
[1:03:36] sound Doctrine but after their own lusts
[1:03:39] shall they Heap to themselves teachers
[1:03:42] having itching ears so they're
[1:03:45] going to find a church that preaches
[1:03:48] what they want to hear and if they can't
[1:03:50] influence the pastor in their Doctrine
[1:03:52] then they'll go and find another church
[1:03:54] wow and they shall turn away their ears
[1:03:58] from the
[1:04:03] truth and shall be turned to
[1:04:05] fables how could that
[1:04:08] happen Paul here is is saying that this
[1:04:10] is going to happen so how could how how
[1:04:13] could that how could it
[1:04:17] be needs to be entertaining it needs to
[1:04:19] be
[1:04:20] interesting needs to tell stories rather
[1:04:22] than bringing
[1:04:24] correction
[1:04:26] and good teaching but watch thou in all
[1:04:29] things endure Affliction do the work of
[1:04:31] an evangelist make full proof of thy
[1:04:33] Ministry Paul is trying to warn Timothy
[1:04:35] to stay diligent to the word and help
[1:04:38] other people stay with the
[1:04:41] word because and and he's warning and he
[1:04:45] Paul may not have known it but God knew
[1:04:48] it when Paul wrote that letter that it
[1:04:50] was going to be eternally
[1:04:53] preserved in the Bible and and there
[1:04:55] would be generation after generation
[1:04:57] reading these warnings and now we
[1:05:01] today are reading these warnings and I
[1:05:04] ask you to put yourself now in this
[1:05:06] young man Josiah's place this
[1:05:10] King back to f 2 Chronicles
[1:05:13] 34 and schaen carried the book To The
[1:05:16] King and brought the king word back
[1:05:19] again saying all that was committed to
[1:05:21] thy Ser servants they did they did it
[1:05:24] they they do it'
[1:05:26] and they have gathered together the
[1:05:27] money that was found in the house of the
[1:05:29] Lord and have delivered it into the hand
[1:05:31] of the overseers into the hand of the
[1:05:33] workmen remember they were doing a
[1:05:36] renovation then shapen The Scribe told
[1:05:39] the king saying hilaya the priest has
[1:05:43] given me a
[1:05:44] book and shapen read it before the
[1:05:49] King this is the writing of Moses this
[1:05:51] is the Bible that he's reading to the
[1:05:54] king and it came to pass when the king
[1:05:57] had heard the words of the law that he
[1:05:59] rent his clothes he had never heard the
[1:06:03] Bible from the pull pit it had been
[1:06:06] replaced and when Josiah heard it for
[1:06:08] himself then he saw he looked around and
[1:06:11] he KN he saw what this book says and he
[1:06:14] saw all of the sin that was surrounding
[1:06:17] him he saw homosexuality he saw Idols
[1:06:20] hanging on the walls he saw that Moses
[1:06:23] had been replaced with something else
[1:06:26] and in ignorance of the
[1:06:29] word had had
[1:06:32] come I wonder why it's so important to
[1:06:35] me that we have these Wednesday Bible
[1:06:38] studies is because we have to know this
[1:06:41] word or then we'll become just like the
[1:06:43] Israelites here who were it's like okay
[1:06:45] well I'm a believer I'm this and that
[1:06:47] but you don't know what the Bible
[1:06:49] says because you haven't been reading it
[1:06:53] nothing can replace all of the the
[1:06:55] streaming services and all that cannot
[1:06:57] replace a a quiet time with this book
[1:07:02] opened and studying it and then if you
[1:07:05] don't understand something get on your
[1:07:07] knees and pray about it it's not just
[1:07:10] someone explaining it to you when you
[1:07:13] take when you let the pulpit or when you
[1:07:16] let anything else replace your time in
[1:07:20] this book you are hurting
[1:07:24] yourself it's a blessing to be able to
[1:07:28] read the Bible and Ponder on these
[1:07:31] things and struggle through him and and
[1:07:35] try to understand them it's one of the
[1:07:37] greatest blessings reading the
[1:07:40] Bible is trying to understand what it's
[1:07:45] saying and the King verse 20 and the
[1:07:49] King answered and the King commanded
[1:07:52] hilaya and ayim the son of schaen and
[1:07:56] abdden the son of Micah and shapen the
[1:08:00] Scribe and
[1:08:01] asah the servant of the
[1:08:04] Kings saying go inquire of the Lord for
[1:08:08] me and for them that are left in Israel
[1:08:11] and in Judah concerning the words of the
[1:08:13] book that is found for great is the
[1:08:15] Wrath of the Lord that is poured out
[1:08:17] upon
[1:08:18] us because our fathers have not kept the
[1:08:21] word of the Lord and to and to do this
[1:08:25] after the book to do after all that is
[1:08:29] written in the book The King is saying
[1:08:32] we have messed up really bad here look
[1:08:34] at all that's going
[1:08:36] on when I read the Bible we have left
[1:08:40] these
[1:08:41] precepts that the prophets have brought
[1:08:45] and we have gone into something other
[1:08:47] than the
[1:08:51] book and
[1:08:53] hkaya and they
[1:08:56] that the king had appointed went to Hula
[1:08:59] the prophetess the wife of shalam the
[1:09:03] son of tath the son of hazra Keeper of
[1:09:07] the Wardrobe now she dwelt in Jerusalem
[1:09:10] in the college and they spake to her to
[1:09:14] that effect and she answered them thus
[1:09:16] sayeth the Lord God of Israel tell ye
[1:09:19] the man that sent you to me thus sayeth
[1:09:23] the Lord behold I will bring evil upon
[1:09:25] this place and upon the inhabitants
[1:09:28] thereof even all the curses that are
[1:09:30] written in the book which they have read
[1:09:33] before the king of Judah because they
[1:09:35] have forsaken
[1:09:36] me and have burned incense unto other
[1:09:40] gods that they might provoke me to anger
[1:09:43] with all the works of their hands
[1:09:45] therefore my wrath shall be poured out
[1:09:48] upon this place and it shall not and
[1:09:51] shall not be
[1:09:54] quenched
[1:09:56] so here's the prophecy that went
[1:09:58] forth to give this back to this
[1:10:02] King and he he had read this he said
[1:10:06] thank God that he had it he read it and
[1:10:08] he says we are we are messing up this is
[1:10:11] not the way God wanted it there is
[1:10:13] something about a man or a woman that
[1:10:15] has enough guts that has enough courage
[1:10:18] in them to stand up and say you know
[1:10:19] what I was
[1:10:21] wrong I didn't understand I took someone
[1:10:24] else's word for this book and I was
[1:10:28] deceived remember the false prophets
[1:10:29] that I was talking about I took someone
[1:10:32] else's word for this instead of getting
[1:10:35] it for
[1:10:37] myself same thing happened to this man
[1:10:41] Daniel
[1:10:43] in um when he was in
[1:10:47] Babylon um when Daniel was in Babylon he
[1:10:52] was taken out as a young
[1:10:53] man and from Jerusalem when
[1:10:56] Nebuchadnezzar came in they pulled all
[1:10:59] of these young people out and they stuck
[1:11:01] them in this worldly environment called
[1:11:05] Babylon the Bible talks much about this
[1:11:09] Spirit about about this city of Babylon
[1:11:12] and a lot of times it seems like to me
[1:11:14] it seems like it's Hollywood it really
[1:11:17] does it's all about the pump and it's
[1:11:20] all about about
[1:11:22] um how well everybody is known right and
[1:11:26] I
[1:11:29] was um I was on YouTube I'm preaching
[1:11:33] against YouTube but I was confess I was
[1:11:35] on YouTube
[1:11:36] yesterday and I saw this video of this
[1:11:41] lady and she was dying of cancer and she
[1:11:46] had the oxygen with her the oxygen was
[1:11:49] in her nose and her last
[1:11:52] request was that she could go to a
[1:11:54] Taylor Swift
[1:11:57] concert and then it showed her in this
[1:12:00] Taylor Swift concert and there she is
[1:12:02] with her friend and she's crying and
[1:12:05] she's saying oh my God oh my God oh my
[1:12:10] God what in the
[1:12:14] world has it come to
[1:12:17] that so then you know there's this
[1:12:21] algorithm that of course it another one
[1:12:25] pops up and there's this guy and he's
[1:12:28] like 40 and he's walking down the street
[1:12:33] and there's this woman that looks just
[1:12:35] like Taylor Swift I think she was made
[1:12:37] up to look like her she's walking this
[1:12:39] way and this man looks at her and he
[1:12:41] says oh my God Taylor Swift and she's
[1:12:44] like well no I'm actually not he's like
[1:12:46] oh and he starts crying he says I can't
[1:12:49] believe I get to meet you and she's like
[1:12:51] well it's not actually he's like oh I'm
[1:12:52] just so happy I can't she's like well
[1:12:54] it's it's not actually and he's like and
[1:12:56] he's just crying and and he and she
[1:12:58] gives him a hug she's like well you know
[1:13:00] it's okay and then it's
[1:13:03] funny but here's this grown man
[1:13:07] weeping because he sees this famous
[1:13:11] person weeping like brother Josiah
[1:13:14] weeping like if we're worshiping wow and
[1:13:17] how you know some of these songs you get
[1:13:19] touched and you just can't help but the
[1:13:21] tears coming out and you just love the
[1:13:24] Lord so much and and then you see over
[1:13:26] here the devil has got it to the place
[1:13:28] when they're doing the same thing at a
[1:13:30] Taylor Swift
[1:13:34] concert am I being hard on Taylor
[1:13:41] Swift it was it's ridiculous so you know
[1:13:44] we have this this Super Bowl you know so

[1:13:48] like oh wonder who won the Super Bowl
[1:13:50] you know so I get on there f it was I
[1:13:52] don't know Fox News or whatever it was
[1:13:55] and the ridiculous article about the
[1:13:59] Super Bowl was about Taylor Swift and
[1:14:01] her boyfriend that's playing on in
[1:14:03] professional football I had to read down
[1:14:05] three or four paragraphs before I could
[1:14:07] figure out who won the
[1:14:08] game it was about this woman this singer
[1:14:13] this pop
[1:14:14] star so started looking
[1:14:18] in to her
[1:14:21] music Remember music is worship yes it
[1:14:25] was designed for worship these feelings
[1:14:28] that you feel when you're worshiping God
[1:14:31] the devil he changes it and he gives the
[1:14:35] people the same feeling when they're in
[1:14:36] these concerts when they're walking down
[1:14:38] the
[1:14:40] road listen to
[1:14:43] this listen to what many of our young
[1:14:46] people and old people alike are
[1:14:48] listening to listen to these
[1:14:52] lyrics this is one of her songs
[1:14:55] they all warned us about times like this
[1:14:57] they say the road gets hard and you get
[1:15:00] lost when you're led by Blind
[1:15:03] Faith why do you have to put that in
[1:15:07] there but we might just get away with it
[1:15:10] religions in your
[1:15:12] lips even if it's a false god we'd still
[1:15:17] worship we might just get away with it
[1:15:20] the altar is my
[1:15:23] hips even if it's a false God we still
[1:15:26] worship this
[1:15:29] love and we are listening to this
[1:15:33] person our young people are listening to
[1:15:36] this the world is listening to this wow
[1:15:39] and we're
[1:15:40] worshiping wow and it's coming into our
[1:15:43] lives it's coming in into our our
[1:15:49] families to where people are Weeping
[1:15:52] when they see her Prophet with Daniel
[1:15:55] was living in this kind of environment
[1:15:57] he had
[1:15:57] been he and thousands of others as I
[1:16:00] said were taking out were taken out of
[1:16:02] Jerusalem and they he was there for like
[1:16:06] 67 years in Babylon in this in this
[1:16:10] awful place he was an old man and he
[1:16:13] opened his
[1:16:15] Bible and he's reading his Bible he's
[1:16:17] reading out of the book of
[1:16:21] Jeremiah and he sees wait a minute it I
[1:16:26] see where I am I see what's going on
[1:16:30] around
[1:16:31] me Daniel 9 chapter
[1:16:34] one in the first year of dasas the son
[1:16:38] of
[1:16:39] aerus of the seed of the mes which was
[1:16:42] made King over the realm of the calans
[1:16:44] in the first year of his Reign I Daniel
[1:16:47] understood by the books by books the
[1:16:50] number of years he was reading his Bible
[1:16:54] yeah and he had a
[1:16:57] revelation whereof the word of the Lord
[1:16:59] came to Jeremiah the prophet that he
[1:17:03] would accomplish 70 years in the
[1:17:06] desolation of Jerusalem So Daniel here
[1:17:09] he's reading out of the 29th chapter of
[1:17:13] Jeremiah and he's like wait a minute
[1:17:16] Jeremiah said we were only going to be
[1:17:18] in Babylon 70
[1:17:20] years and he had been there like 6768
[1:17:24] years
[1:17:26] wow so when he read that let me read
[1:17:28] Jeremiah 29:10 really quick for thus
[1:17:31] Jeremiah says this for thus sayeth the
[1:17:33] Lord after 70 years be accomplished at
[1:17:35] Babylon I will visit you and perform my
[1:17:38] good word toward you in causing you to
[1:17:41] return to this place meaning Jerusalem
[1:17:45] So Daniel reads that and he says the
[1:17:47] prophet told us that we would only be
[1:17:50] there 70 years then Daniel says this and
[1:17:53] I set my face unto to the Lord God to
[1:17:56] seek by prayer and supplications with
[1:17:58] fasting and sackcloth and Ashes and I
[1:18:00] prayed unto the Lord my God and made my
[1:18:03] confessions and said oh Lord the great
[1:18:05] and Dreadful God keeping the Covenant
[1:18:08] and
[1:18:08] mercy to them that love him and to them
[1:18:11] that keep his Commandments we have
[1:18:14] sinned wow and have committed iniquity
[1:18:17] and have done wickedly and have rebelled
[1:18:19] even by departing from thy precepts from
[1:18:22] thy and thy
[1:18:23] judgments neither have we hearkened unto
[1:18:26] thy servants the
[1:18:27] prophets which spake in thy name to our
[1:18:30] King our princes and our fathers and to
[1:18:33] all the people of the
[1:18:35] land and then if you skip down to verse
[1:18:39] 21 he says this yay while I was speaking
[1:18:42] in prayer so there he is he's saying
[1:18:44] this word says all of this is about to
[1:18:48] end and he's praying like Lord show us
[1:18:51] more what are we supposed to do and
[1:18:54] while I was speaking in prayer even the
[1:18:56] man Gabriel the
[1:18:58] Angel whom I had seen in the vision at
[1:19:01] the beginning being caused to fly
[1:19:03] swiftly touched me about the time of the
[1:19:05] evening oblation and he informed me and
[1:19:08] talked with me and said oh Daniel I am
[1:19:10] now come forth to give the skill and
[1:19:14] understanding he read his
[1:19:16] Bible prayed about
[1:19:19] it and then the Lord showed him where he
[1:19:23] was another place place in
[1:19:25] Daniel it says that knowledge will
[1:19:28] increase in the last

[1:20:39] bite Satan does yes true just like he
[1:20:44] always has and he will take this and use
[1:20:47] it against
[1:20:52] us Luke
[1:20:55] chapter
[1:20:56] 23 Jesus was on his way to the
[1:21:01] Cross verse 27 brother I don't know if I
[1:21:03] gave you this this scripture but I want
[1:21:05] to read it Luke uh
[1:21:07] 23:27 Jesus was carrying his cross and
[1:21:10] he was going up to golgatha and there
[1:21:13] and there followed
[1:21:15] him a great company of people and of
[1:21:18] women which also bewailed and lamented
[1:21:20] him but Jesus turning unto them said
[1:21:22] Daughters of Jerusalem we not weep not
[1:21:24] for me but weep for
[1:21:26] yourselves and for your children for
[1:21:29] behold the days are coming in the which
[1:21:31] they shall in the which they shall say
[1:21:34] blessed are the
[1:21:36] barren and the wombs that never
[1:21:39] bear and the paps which never gave
[1:21:43] suck you're blessed not to have a
[1:21:46] child how many unborn children are
[1:21:49] killed in the United States today in one
[1:21:53] day when Moses was
[1:21:56] born the Egyptians were killing
[1:21:58] thousands of babies and then God brought
[1:22:01] judgment on Egypt when Jesus was born
[1:22:04] they were again killing babies and God
[1:22:07] brought the first coming of Christ and
[1:22:09] today you hear oh you're too young to
[1:22:11] have a
[1:22:14] baby you won't get to follow your
[1:22:17] dreams you won't to get you won't get to
[1:22:19] get your career blessed are the wombs
[1:22:21] that never
[1:22:23] bear and today today there are far more
[1:22:27] unborn babies dying than there were in
[1:22:30] Egypt or in
[1:22:31] Israel you cannot deny that that is a
[1:22:35] sign of the coming
[1:22:37] judgment that's the so I ask if we're in
[1:22:41] Josiah's place and we see these things
[1:22:44] Josiah what are you going to do about
[1:22:46] this what am I going to do about it
[1:22:49] there's signs that are all around me so
[1:22:52] what am I going to
[1:22:53] do let's go back to this prophecy of
[1:22:56] hula the
[1:22:58] propheus 2 Chronicles
[1:23:02] 34:26 and as for the king Judah as for
[1:23:06] the king of Judah who you sent who sent
[1:23:10] you to inquire of the Lord so shall ye
[1:23:13] say unto him thus sayeth the Lord God of
[1:23:15] Israel concerning The Words which thou
[1:23:18] Hast
[1:23:19] heard because thine heart was
[1:23:23] tender and thou didst humble thyself
[1:23:25] before God we don't know how much Josiah
[1:23:27] sinned he probably did a
[1:23:30] lot but because your heart was tender
[1:23:34] and you humbled yourself when you
[1:23:37] heard his words against this place when
[1:23:40] you read the Bible and against the
[1:23:41] inhabitants thereof and humbled thyself
[1:23:45] before me and did rent thy clothes and
[1:23:49] weep before me I have even heard thee
[1:23:52] also sayeth the Lord look at the the
[1:23:54] repentance look at how God values a
[1:23:58] sincere repent repent of
[1:24:00] heart behold I will gather thee to thy
[1:24:03] fathers and thou shalt be gathered to
[1:24:04] thy grave in peace neither shall thine
[1:24:07] eyes see all of the evil that I will
[1:24:09] bring upon this place and upon the
[1:24:11] inhabitants of the same so they brought
[1:24:13] the king word
[1:24:15] again then the king sent and gathered
[1:24:17] together all the Elders of Judah and
[1:24:18] Jerusalem and the King went up to the
[1:24:20] house of the Lord and all the men of
[1:24:22] Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem
[1:24:24] and the priests and the Levites and all
[1:24:26] the people great and small and he read
[1:24:29] in their ears the book
[1:24:33] wow all the words of the book of the
[1:24:35] Covenant that was found in the house of
[1:24:37] the Lord and the King stood in his place
[1:24:39] and made a covenant before the Lord to
[1:24:41] walk after the Lord and to keep his
[1:24:44] Commandments and his testimonies and his
[1:24:47] statutes with all his heart and with all
[1:24:49] his soul to perform the words of the
[1:24:52] Covenant which are written in this book
[1:24:56] book Josiah used his
[1:24:59] influence he used his position it might
[1:25:03] be the position of of a mom or a dad it
[1:25:06] might be the position of a of a friend
[1:25:07] or a deacon or a trustee or a pastor
[1:25:10] whatever God has given us to influence
[1:25:14] others use it like Josiah
[1:25:19] did and Josiah took away all the
[1:25:23] Abominations
[1:25:25] out of all the out of all the countries
[1:25:27] that pertained to the children of Israel
[1:25:29] and made all that were present to in
[1:25:31] Israel to serve even to serve the Lord
[1:25:34] their God and all his days they departed
[1:25:37] not from following the Lord they
[1:25:40] departed not from following the Lord the
[1:25:42] god of their
[1:25:44] fathers
[1:25:46] amen so
[1:25:48] Josiah he read in this Bible he had his
[1:25:52] own understanding he read in this Bible
[1:25:55] he prayed about it he asked others to
[1:25:58] help him and he got the interpretation
[1:26:00] of the word and then he implemented it a
[1:26:04] perfect example for all of us because we
[1:26:06] are
[1:26:08] surrounded by the
[1:26:10] enemy and he used something like I Love
[1:26:13] Lucy wow this
[1:26:16] little
[1:26:19] harmless
[1:26:21] show to start the ball roll
[1:26:24] in and then now we see as I said we see
[1:26:27] Disney and the evilness the people don't
[1:26:31] want to see
[1:26:33] that but there is a higher power a lower
[1:26:36] power pressing them to put the shove
[1:26:40] this stuff down our throats so then we
[1:26:43] just take it like oh it's just normal it
[1:26:46] is not normal right these things are
[1:26:51] sin and if we just allow it
[1:26:55] then it just it'll become part of our
[1:26:57] Lives we need to get
[1:26:59] back we need to return we hear so
[1:27:04] much about Malachi chapter
[1:27:07] 4 do you ever read the book of Malachi
[1:27:09] you should it's only four
[1:27:12] chapters what was going on in the Book
[1:27:14] of Malachi they were just they were
[1:27:16] living lukewarm they weren't paying
[1:27:18] their ties they were they were using
[1:27:19] these sacrifices that weren't the best
[1:27:22] of the flock like they should they were
[1:27:24] just didn't really care about God a
[1:27:27] perfect example of a lukewarm age that
[1:27:31] is today and that is the Book of
[1:27:35] Malachi Malachi chapter 4 says
[1:27:38] this for behold the day cometh that
[1:27:41] shall burn as an
[1:27:43] oven and all the proud yay and all that
[1:27:46] do wickedly shall be stubble and the day
[1:27:48] that cometh shall burn them up sayeth
[1:27:50] the Lord of hosts that it shall leave
[1:27:52] them neither root nor Bur
[1:27:54] Branch there is coming a judgment is
[1:27:57] what Malachi is
[1:27:59] saying but unto you that fear my
[1:28:02] name shall the shall the son of
[1:28:04] righteousness arise with healing in his
[1:28:06] wings and ye shall go forth and grow up
[1:28:08] as calves of the stall and you shall
[1:28:10] tread down the wicked for they shall be
[1:28:12] ashes Under The Souls of your feet in
[1:28:14] the day that I shall do this sayeth the
[1:28:16] Lord of
[1:28:18] hosts musicians can
[1:28:22] come remember
[1:28:26] watch what the Lord speaking through his
[1:28:28] Prophet Malachi says he says remember
[1:28:32] you remember ye the law of Moses my
[1:28:35] servant which I commanded unto him in
[1:28:38] horb for all Israel with statutes and
[1:28:40] judgments he's saying remember the
[1:28:43] same God remember the same Bible that
[1:28:47] Josiah found and it changed his life now
[1:28:50] you remember
[1:28:52] it and
[1:28:55] you fear my name and fear my word
[1:28:59] respect my
[1:29:01] word behold I will send you Elijah the
[1:29:04] prophet before the coming of the great
[1:29:06] and Dreadful day of the Lord and he
[1:29:08] shall turn the heart of the fathers to
[1:29:10] the
[1:29:11] children fulfilled and John the
[1:29:16] Baptist and the Heart of the children to
[1:29:19] their
[1:29:20] fathers the heart of these people back
[1:29:24] to the word because it's strayed so
[1:29:28] far that
[1:29:30] Spirit brings us back to this
[1:29:39] Bible lest I come and smite the Earth
[1:29:41] with a
[1:29:43] curse think about
[1:29:46] it do we really
[1:29:50] believe put yourself in Josiah's Place
[1:29:53] do I really believe that all of these
[1:29:57] things that I was talking about just now
[1:29:59] do I really believe that they're the
[1:30:00] sign of the
[1:30:02] end do I really believe that this
[1:30:04] Malachi has been fulfilled do I really I
[1:30:08] you know I really think that very few
[1:30:10] people do because if we did we would
[1:30:14] know that this time is at hand and we
[1:30:18] would be like Josiah we fall down our
[1:30:20] knees say Lord forgive us or like Daniel
[1:30:23] did he fell Lord forgive us we're sinful
[1:30:25] People Help Us
[1:30:29] Lord but instead here's the
[1:30:32] enemy and he just made
[1:30:35] it apathetic it's just we don't care
[1:30:40] it's not that important but if we really
[1:30:41] believed it it would be important
[1:30:43] brothers and
[1:30:46] sisters I'll read one more scripture
[1:30:49] Peter second Peter chapter
[1:30:52] 3:8
[1:30:54] he says this but beloved be not ignorant
[1:30:56] of this one thing that one
[1:31:01] day is with the Lord as a thousand years
[1:31:03] and a thousand years as one day the Lord
[1:31:06] is not slack concerning his promise what
[1:31:09] he said is going to pass the whole the
[1:31:13] day cometh that shall burn us in heaven
[1:31:14] it's going to
[1:31:18] happen as some men count slackness but
[1:31:21] is longsuffering to us wordss not will
[1:31:23] willing that any should perish but that
[1:31:25] all should come to repentance but the
[1:31:28] day of the Lord will come as a thief in
[1:31:30] the
[1:31:31] night in the which the heavens shall
[1:31:34] pass away with a great noise and the ele
[1:31:36] and the elements shall melt with fervent
[1:31:38] Heat and the Earth also and the works
[1:31:40] that are therein shall be burned up
[1:31:41] sounds like Malachi 4 doesn't it just
[1:31:44] what I just
[1:31:45] read seeing
[1:31:48] then that all these things shall be
[1:31:51] dissolved what manner of persons ought
[1:31:54] ye to be in all holy conversation and
[1:31:58] godliness looking for and hastening unto
[1:32:02] the coming of the day of the Lord
[1:32:04] wherein the heavens being on F fire
[1:32:06] shall be dissolved and the elements
[1:32:08] shall melt with fervent heat behold the
[1:32:10] day cometh th shall burn as an oven as I
[1:32:12] just said and all the proud and all that
[1:32:15] do wicked shall be burned
[1:32:18] up
[1:32:20] nevertheless we according to his promise
[1:32:23] look for new heavens and new earth
[1:32:25] wherein dwelleth righteousness wherefore
[1:32:28] beloved seeing that ye look for such
[1:32:31] things be diligent that you may be found
[1:32:35] of him in peace without spot and
[1:32:41] blameless it's a
[1:32:43] warning it's a warning that
[1:32:48] Josiah had he read he read his Bible and
[1:32:53] he said look at at all of these
[1:32:55] things that are happening in the world
[1:32:58] today Luke 17 as it was in the day of no
[1:33:01] days of Noah there was violence all over
[1:33:04] the world look what just happened in
[1:33:06] Russia these men came in and shot all of
[1:33:09] these in innocent people killing over a
[1:33:11] hundred of them
[1:33:13] why
[1:33:15] violence what did those people do to
[1:33:17] these people just to kill people Jesus
[1:33:21] said that as it was in the days of Noah
[1:33:23] so shall it be when he comes
[1:33:25] again as it was in the days of
[1:33:28] lot what was going on in lot it was
[1:33:30] Sodom
[1:33:32] Disney was rising
[1:33:36] up and teaching these things to the
[1:33:39] people and then it got common to
[1:33:44] them and they thought it was just normal
[1:33:47] to have all this sin surrounding them as
[1:33:51] I said it is not normal don't let it be
[1:33:53] normal
[1:33:54] normal I understand people make mistakes
[1:33:57] I understand people have weaknesses that
[1:33:58] other people don't don't have I
[1:34:00] understand that but don't say it's
[1:34:04] okay whatever sin it
[1:34:07] is don't just say it's all right because
[1:34:10] everybody else is doing
[1:34:12] it it doesn't
[1:34:14] work
[1:34:16] but if you got anything from my sermon
[1:34:19] this morning don't neglect this book
[1:34:25] don't let someone else just feed you
[1:34:27] what they think it means you sit
[1:34:30] down as Josiah he
[1:34:34] listened to this Bible and then he was
[1:34:37] able to look around and see all the sin
[1:34:39] that was around him and then he used his
[1:34:42] influence and said this this is going to
[1:34:45] change Daniel did the same
[1:34:47] thing he read the Bible and he says
[1:34:50] we're about to get out of here we're
[1:34:52] about to go home
[1:34:54] Jeremiah prophesied it's going to be 70
[1:34:57] years and we're almost there get
[1:35:00] ready use your influence as these
[1:35:03] brothers did to get your families ready
[1:35:07] to get your neighbors ready to get your
[1:35:09] fellow church members ready to get your
[1:35:11] friends ready everyone that you can use
[1:35:14] that influence as these brothers did and

[1:35:20] here and don't fall into this stuff that

[1:40:18] said that for for
[1:40:21] Millennia but it happened in our day I
