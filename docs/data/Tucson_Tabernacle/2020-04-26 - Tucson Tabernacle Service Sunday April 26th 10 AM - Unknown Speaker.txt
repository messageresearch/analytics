believe is that nothing will stand in your way Lord that pleases you that pleases the Lord so much when people take him at his word and say I'll stand on this we do have some requests to bring to your attention this morning sister Jenny Bouchard if he had not heard she was taken into emergency here a couple of days ago and they found that she had cancer so they put her in in Hospice any more updates she was able to receive visitors at the last information we received but if it's time for her to go home I'm sure that that desire in your heart to be reunited with brother Jerry and not only that but to leave this life to that life that we've all desired the Lord desires to make her whole and make her well then we just believe that be with the family at this time brother Robert Chacon called me yesterday and tomorrow he's to have one more test as they just do the annual test that they do and just said remember that all would be well and then brother Matt forwarded the prayer request for sister Karen Pruitt where the temporalis wife she had been taken to the hospital with a brain bleed they were able to stop it but as the last report they had not determined what was causing that I don't know if there's any updates on that perfect example okay she had a perfect exams so our God is able you know man would look at it we would look at it and there might be some fear some things that would it but if we'll take God at His Word said Lord you said by your stripes we are healed also we just believe that and then brother Matt Watkins and speaking with him yesterday's he mentioned that one of the brothers in their church was tested for the kovat the corona virus and he did come back positive one of the young brothers there and just remember them but also an elderly brother there at the church had gone in and they thought maybe he had the virus he did not test positive for the virus but he was not doing well and he's older single brother who the church is his family and they were not allowing anybody to go in and see him at the time as kind of the conditions of the hospitalization is today so just needing comfort and healing and strength so and I know there are needs everywhere and we we keep them before the Lord and we trusted him but we take him at his word is said by my stripes you were healed it was a finished work done already so we confess that and we believe that today so if you have a need wherever you're at you could even raise your hand there where you're at saying Lord you know my need you know what I have made of and maybe I can even in words explain it but Lord you know the need the root cause the the the situation maybe sometimes you get phone calls and and someone just requests prior but you don't know what the reason is but the God the Lord does so as we bow our heads and speak to him let's believe Lord or whatever we confess them according to your word we can begin to praise you and worship you and accept it as being done Lord we thank you this morning that we do have a source we do have a place to go Lord we don't have to stand in line and be tested and checked before we even allowed to go into to be maybe looked at by a doctor or at a hospital Lord but we can walk right into your presence into that holy holy of Holy's by the shed blood Lord and there speak with you have a have that that intimate conversation with you Lord and it's it's not just words but you go in and you see the spirit you see the motive you see everything that's going on or it even as brother Peter mentioned that you would come in you you would come in the cool of the evening and you would call your children Adam and Eve and you would come in fellowship with them Lord and that has not changed Lord this Sunday morning here Lord that we've gathered together Lord and we're calling on your name but but even more so you've drawn nine to my Lord you know the needs of every heart Lord and maybe not even being able to express it in words today but Lord you look down and we saw it over we heard it over and over and through the tapes Lord through the listening the messages as they would come forth and the angel of Lords to would look into the lives of these people and begin to tell them the cause and the reason what was happening Lord but your word says by your stripes we are healed so we're taking that we're believing that and we're confessing that in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we think Amen just a couple of things to to announce to say brother Arnie and sister Rachel had their 39th anniversary wedding anniversary so we'd like to congratulate them on that and and Lord willing if we're here more if not welcome we'll celebrate that eternal marriage together and then today I know she's listening and I'll hear about it when I get home but today's my wife's birthday I don't know what her age is cuz she won't really tell me except I told her I would give her a dollar for each age so I might get the truth out of her hand today so but thank the Lord for my wife and the blessing she is to me and and the help in the care she is so appreciate that may the Lord bless each one of you and

morning and his Joy's in our hearts amen I trust that you have a longing that you have a desire Amen that you came with an expectation to hear from the Lord I know that I did today the Lord put it upon my heart yesterday morning to have brother Aaron McGarry minister for us today I contacted him and he was able to we're thankful for the setup that we have that were able to do this virtually amen I know that we're coming into living rooms today and into vehicles and and into the church they're also gathered amen and it reminds me so many times of hearing the prophet and as he would speak he would say you there in radioland and you gathered in churches we find ourself in the same exact scenario here and I'm glad that the abiding presence of Jesus is with us no matter where we're at I'm reminded of the quote where the army sent me a brother branham saying that distance means nothing to God and he says some of my greatest miracles that have ever taken place in my ministry were done through telephone amen and so it doesn't matter where you're at today doesn't matter what your situation is in life what you're facing God's Word meets the challenge of the hour and we believe that with all of our hearts amen I just want to turn it over to brother Aaron now and I just want you to come bring your expectation to the Lord he is the great Shepherd amen he's the chief Shepherd the scripture calls him and we believe that he feeds his sheep and it doesn't matter it doesn't matter who's speaking it takes the the onus off of the man and it puts it on God and I'm thankful to do that today I believe that he has something for you amen and I'm just I'm gonna trust that that that you feel the same today amen so just have an expectation I mean let's just pray before we turn it over to brother Aaron brother Aaron has gathered there in Hickory at Hickory Bible Tabernacle he's able to use and preach straight from there from the pulpit so we're glad for that amen so let's just pray here just for a moment before we begin Heavenly Father were we have joy in our heart today Lord joy that we have this opportunity to worship you serve you father in whatever capacity Lord you've caught us in we just want to be faithful to serve you today we ask God that your word Lord which has transforming power in it Lord brother Aaron has labored he's prayed father he's waited on you Lord as as your servant now God would you come and do the impossible now Lord may you move our brother out of the way Lord is gathered in a building Lord uncle race today anointing power may the unction of the Holy Spirit fallen brother Aaron fall on the church Lord and Tucson lured me here those that are gathered at home Lord may we be connected in another dimension Lord as we pull upon the Word of God I pray for Lord for you to have your perfect way give us liberty we ask in Jesus Christ name Amen amen god bless you amen brother Aaron go praise the Lord hallelujah Maya what a wonderful worship today and the song service I just felt the presence of the Lord just here singing together with my family a great privilege to be gathered together with you as brother Matthew was saying gustin's means nothing to God and we're joined together by the word and I so appreciate the fact that brother Matthew had it on his heart and followed the leadership of the Lord to have me to minister today it's just a wonderful privilege to speak to the bride of Jesus Christ and so we're just going to get right into the word if you want to stand together with me if you have a Bible and I want to be reading from Psalms chapter 105 I want to start with verse 8 and then read to verse 19 Psalms 105 verse 8 to verse 19 and we'll read the scripture then just go to the Lord in prayer then if you if it's your custom to stand while the word is reading then we'll have you to be seated but Psalms 105 verse 8 and it's talking about how God did wondrous works and I begins this Psalm by saying remember the great works of the Lord and his judgments and all the earth and then I wanted to read this part so that it gets our minds thinking about the Covenant the promise that God's made to us says he hath remembered his covenant forever the word which he commanded to a thousand generations which Covenant he made with Abraham and his oath unto Isaac and confirmed the Same unto Jacob for a law and to Israel for an everlasting covenant saying unto thee will I give the land of Canaan the lot of your inheritance now remember as the bride we don't have a natural inheritance but we have a spiritual inheritance we have a spiritual promised land and he says verse 12 when they were but a few men and number gave very few and strangers in it when they went from one nation to another from one kingdom to another people and this is showing how they went into Egypt he suffered no man to do them wrong a he reproved Kings for their sakes saying touch not my anointed and do my prophets no harm moreover he called for famine upon the land he braked the whole staff of bread and this was where I'll begin to focus later on this morning he sent a man before them even Joseph who was sold for a servant he's just taken us through the narrative of the exodus now and and even what brought them into Egypt and then bringing them out he sent a man before them even Joseph who was sold for a servant whose feet they hurt with fetters he was laid in iron were giving the background of Joseph's story until the time that his word came the word of the Lord tried him and that a wonderful statement till the time that his word came the word of the Lord tried him the king sent and loosed him even the ruler of the people and let him go free he made him Lord of his house and the ruler of all his substance it will just stop there as it begins to go further in this Exodus let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer as we ask God to bless the reading of his word our gracious Heavenly Father is such a wonderful privilege to be gathered together today in your presence Lord not just dining as your guest but we're dining as your bride Lord as a part of your body the very representation of the word on earth and Lord as many are gathered in different settings as brother Matthew has already expressed some may be driving some around the kitchen table around tablets and cell phones and desktop computers whatever it might be Lord we're looking to you now to come and speak to us and take the bread of life and rightly divide it so father I commit myself to you desire them that you just take control of this entire service for your glory may you make sure the technology apart goes well and that the hearing part goes well but more importantly Lord we open up our hearts to hear from you so we ask this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and then you may be seated I want to begin by reading a statement from the world is falling apart and I was studying about a year ago it's almost exactly a year ago I was starting studying on the subject of being born into war and born into chaos and as a part of that I was listening to the world is falling apart in those different places in the message and Satan's Eden and god of this evil age just to fully understand this world that we've been born into and this statement stood out to me very very profoundly and the Lord just brought it back into my heart yesterday actually Ford the service and it says the whole systems are falling apart something's wrong we want to seriously think of this for the next few minutes just don't enter this now just to say well we've walked over and sat down we had a breakfast we heard testimonies and so forth but let's with all our hearts get down to this and think of it remember it's our life so he's bringing life before us this this isn't just going to church it's not just getting by said this is our life there's nothing no more important than our life there's nothing no more important no matter how much we gain in the world or how great we become here but we got to come to the end of the road that's a telling time we must approach it with all sincerity we know how to do when the people and other times and I want you to really focus it on this particular part right here there's what people in other times when people tried to find some way of survival they went to systems so when it seemed as if survival was necessary or they were coming to a controversy or chaos or or something where they felt like we need to persevere we need to preserve we need to be sustained it says they went to systems so we talked about survival systems in a way of survival and the only way that they can go to any other system than the way that God has laid down is to get away from his word so what he's emphasizing is that when man wanted to survive they went to systems and in order to go to a system they go away from God's provided way in God's provided way to survive is his word so that's what we're wanting you to ponder right now is that there's survival systems and there's man's way of surviving and there's God's way of surviving and it's certainly fine if you want to take what we're talking about now and put it in the context of this great pandemic and all the stay at home orders and the fear of coronavirus it's certainly fine to do that because that's really where the Lord's leading me is to put with taking place right now in a different perspective so he says you have to get away from his word meaning the other men and other ages have done this in times past they've all tried to get away and tried to control the world and make a system of politics in different things to try to control and hold the world together now this is very profound thinking of it in light of the things that are happening now and they in order to do that they have to get away from God's plan of doing it God has a way of keeping this thing together what a beautiful reminder God has a way of keeping this thing together and the only way that men can ever adopt some other way he has to get away from the original way with those words just ringing in your ears right now and hopefully just pumping something into your heart and thrilling something in your soul the God has a way of survival and that way is his word there is no other way of survival there's no other systems he says God has a way of keeping this thing together so there could be systems of politics and different things to control and hold the world together and they get together to do that he says they get away from God's plan and so I have a question to ask you today and that's the title of my sermon and so this next question I'm about to ask is the title so I don't want you to think I'm changing the subject at all but my title is what are you looking at and I know that I was talking to you face-to-face that might get a little bit confusing it says well I'm looking at you I'm wanting to know what your title is brother Aaron but that is my title what are you looking at what is it that we're viewing what is it we're hearing what is it we're saying if we're looking at something are we really seeing what is there if we're hearing something are we really hearing what is actually they're not just seeing without looking and understanding and comprehending not just listing without really hearing and understanding because we've got to understand in this hour that we live in and we want to know God's way of doing something and in Isaiah chapter 33 verses 5 & 6 this scripture has meant more to me over the last month or so month and a half than ever says the Lord has exalted for he dwelleth on high he hath filled Zion with judgment and righteousness and as we read in Psalms 105 it says he is the Lord our God his judgments are in all the earth and so we see some continuity with our text and this scripture here in Isaiah 33 says and wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of light so in an uncertain time in a time when we're not sure what the next week will hold or what certain parameters are gonna be placed upon us there's a lot of talk about it we'll never go back to the way it was before and we have to anticipate a new normal listen it doesn't matter what unfolds in this natural world the Bible's tell us that wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times and strength of salvation so the stability of our times and the strength of our salvation is connected with wisdom and knowledge and it says the fear of the Lord is his treasure so our treasure is the fear of God not a fear of the circumstances not a fear of the condition of our times out of fear of the future but our treasure the real gold that we have is our fear of the Lord and wisdom and knowledge are the source of our stability and the source or our safety during this time wisdom and knowledge shall be the strength of thy salvation wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of their times so we have a wisdom and we have a knowledge that is our stability we have a wisdom and we have a knowledge that is our safety that is our strength and brother Branham when he preached the rapture message he took Psalms 27 and he brings it out beautifully the Lord he is the strength of my life he who whom shall I be afraid the Lord is the strength of our salvation the Lord is my light and my salvation whom shall I fear so the Lord is that source of wisdom the Lord is that source of life he is that knowledge that is our safety during difficult times and our faith can only rest in the Word of God and I I want to just maybe emphasize this in a very direct way so that you catch what we're pinpointing right now is faith can only rest in the word believing the wrong thing is not faith you can be convinced of something you can absolutely believe it you can sell yourself out to it you can trust in it you can depend upon it as it were but that's not the faith that our that we are that we have as believers it's not the faith that rests upon the Word of God if you really believe in something that's a lie that's really not in reality it's actually doubt in reality it's unbelief because you're believing something that's not true so if we believe or trust in something that isn't certain that isn't sure then it can only breed ultimately a lack of confidence for trusted in something that isn't true that isn't trustworthy it's only going to make us uncertainty because what we're trusting in fails us and if we have a certain expectation that the economy is going to be a certain way or that governments are going to be a certain way or that the health care system is going to be a certain way or the stimulus is going to be a certain way those things can let us down and because we trusted in it we only begin to doubt it if somebody ever promised you that they were going to do something and they don't do it then the next time they promise you something that trust hasn't breed a bread in you more trust it actually a cautious and uncertain is this really gonna happen is he really going to do what he said proverbs chapter 25 verse 19 says confidence in an unfaithful man in the time of trouble is like a broken tooth and a foot out of joint my goodness ponder that when you trust in someone who's unfaithful when it comes to the time that you really need them he says it's like a broken tooth or foot out a joint trusting and ally will fail you trusting in a make-believe or trusting in something that's not true trusting in just an opinion will fail you it can't provide the support or the stability that you need or the strength that you need in the moment that you need it so think about that deeply in your hearts even in light of the circumstances that we're in right now confidence in an unfaithful man when you need them the most in a time of trouble and a time of uncertainty is like a broken tooth it may bother you and it may have a lot of pain but then as soon as you go to use it and rely upon it to do what it's supposed to do it fails you and it will not produce the outcome you need it's like a foot out of joint as soon as you put that weight upon it you may experience pain but when you go to step on it you go to use it to push yourself forward it's going to fail you and cons you to stumble and the Bible's treating a very beautiful picture here confidence in an unfaithful man if I could put it this way confident or trust in the wrong kind of teaching or the wrong kind of understanding or the wrong kind of wisdom cannot inspire faith but it only produced doubt in uncertainty in fear confidence in an unfaithful man in the time of trouble is like a broken tooth and a foot out of joint the wrong kind of teaching cannot inspire faith so and maybe I'll just interject this it just creates an uncertainty I sincere but misguided teaching sincere misguided opinions can breed uncertainty even though it's trying to encourage your lift you up as a matter of fact as I was pondering this and even ministered on it recently if we were to take the scripture and try to preach that because you have the Holy Ghost you don't have to worry about an infectious disease or because you have the Holy Ghost you don't have to worry about covet 19 my purpose in doing that may be to give you the faith to not fear covin 19 but I actually create doubt and uncertainty in your own experience because by preaching that I get you to think well if I have the Holy Ghost I won't get this virus and I'm trying to build your confidence but then you think well I guess this is going to be another test of whether or not I have the Holy Ghost if I don't get coronavirus then I'll know I have the Holy Ghost listen that's not the way that we think that's not the way that we function that's not the way we operate your venturing into a realm of uncertainty your venturing into a realm of self interpretation and you actually create more uncertainty and you produce another evidence of what the Holy Ghost is and we get away from what we know to be certain in the message what is the evidence of the Holy Ghost so we must be if we're going to have the right kind of faith in this hour we must be looking at the right thing we must be hearing the right thing if we're gonna have faith we have to see the right thing so I'm asking what are you looking at brother Branham says in the message one in a million he says the time and hour that we're living in if a person don't know which way to go or what to do or how to turn you're not walking by faith anymore you're just guessing you are presuming she's and presume is to advance without official Authority so we don't want to go forward in the time that we're living and we don't want to advance ever in our Christian life on presumption or assumptions or opinions or interpretations of man we must know exactly where we're advancing to presume is to advance without official Authority so if we haven't got the real official authority to know what God has said would take place in this hour how are you ever gonna face this hour now think of how easy it is for us to try to take scriptures and quotes and use them or try to interpret them by the things that are taking place in the world today because we have all these modern events I'm going to take the situations we're facing now and use the modern events to understand the Word of God to understand the Bible to understand the message and he's and in doing that we're really advancing without official Authority and how are we going to know what's taking place in this hour to know how to face this hour unless we stick with what is certain what the word has already told us we've got to face it knowing by faith in his word the things that's supposed to be happening now so there's something that has happened that gives us the faith and the wisdom and the knowledge to face the time that we're living in now something has already been given to allow us to face what is happening now it's the very thing that brother Branham is expressing to us if you're not walking if you're not walking by faith and you're just guessing then you don't have official authority and you can't really face the hour so he's preaching this one in a million it's a part of a series of little sermons he was preached and I believe on the air in Los Angeles so he's saying that you've got to know the time we're living in something's supposed to be happening now the conditions of the nations the conditions of the people the condition of the church and so forth we've got to know that and then how to walk out to face it if you don't know how to do that you just what we used to call kind of haphazardly just jump in and hoping it'll be there hoping this and hoping that and it will be and will it be and God don't want us to do that he wants us to know what he has said about this day he wants us to know what has been said about this day not speculated not opinion not interpretation but what is he said about this day and then meet it by faith how can you do that how do you meet this day by faith when you know what he said about this day when you know what he has said about this day then you can meet it by faith we want to know what he is said about this day then meet it by faith because he said it would be that way then you know then we know you are truth then because you haven't got some person's word for it when you've got God's word for it then you know what the truth is you've got his word of what we must do so we want God's word of what we must do now with that as a foundation here as I as I'm expressing this and laying this out there kind of just laying this as a as a foundation to go further now let me think about these let me just raise some things into our mind and get us pondering some of these things for a moment because he's talking about facing this day Isaiah 33 is talking about the stability of side times and saw proverbs 25 is talked about in a time of trouble we're living in a time of trouble we're living in perilous times or living in a time of great calamity and as we think about the day that we're facing the hour that were living in brother brems saying how are we ever gonna face this hour we've never lived in a day like this I was talking to a client of mine over the past week or so and as a young young child he lived in the UK during World War two and he said that he faced the bombings and the hear of the sirens and he lived in that time and he lives in West Vancouver now and he said Erin this is this is worse than what I experienced as a child in World War two he's in his 80s said this is worse than what I experienced then why because he's facing he's facing something that he's never faced before if there were sirens in war maybe he'd have a point of reference but now he's got no point of reference to how different his life is right now and so we've never lived in a day like this and so the prognosticators and the economists and the scientist and and the healthcare industry they're all trying to find a point of reference and what can we compare this to because we want to understand what's happening and there's two points of reference that are often used to understand our current circumstances two points of reference in the past and I'm using this very deliberately now and this really forms kind of the inspiration of what I'm wanting to share with you just take something very simple from history to get us to think about what you're looking at what we're pondering what we're considering and so two points of reference let me refer to the first point of reference and it has to do with the the scientific things that we're facing in the the disease that we're facing and so you have a pandemic standpoint from a pandemic standpoint from an infectious disease standpoint a lot of scientists and the ones who are looking into this the nature of this disease that we're facing right now they used the Spanish flu as a comparison now the Spanish flu spread widely throughout the world in 1918 to 1920 some say that it actually began in 1916 but it began to widely spread in 1918 interestingly enough there's a study several years ago that came out that concluded that the Spanish flu began in New York and they're actually showing early signs of an outbreak in Kansas near a an army base in the January of 1918 and then the first reported case in the United States was on an army base later that spring in Kansas but through investigations and looking at certain numbers and data they feel it probably begin to spread in 1916 and this is what scientists and even the media and a lot of us are going back and looking at the Spanish flu to even understand the sheer numbers and the impact of kovat nineteen and a third of the population in those days from 1918 to 1920 was infected by the Spanish flu as I had 500 million a half a billion people infected by the Spanish flu at least fifty million people worldwide died because of the Spanish flu in the United States alone six hundred and seventy five thousand Americans died as a result of the Spanish flu now we can take our numbers in our data today and say well we've had about 50,000 died now six hundred and seventy five thousand died then and this is how much we anticipate will die and so they're comparing the spread of the Spanish flu to the time that we're living in now to understand the data to understand the numbers so that's a point of reference from a pandemic standpoint from an economic standpoint that the the things that we're seeing transpire in our life right now from an economic standpoint they say we have no other point of reference than the great depression and the Great Depression unfolded from 1929 to 1939 and with what we're facing now our current current economic situation is so stupendous or staggering that the economists and the rioters and and those that are tweeting and those that are blogging those are doing podcasted everybody is saying we don't have anything else we can compare the unemployment to than the unemployment of the Great Depression we don't have any market shifts to compare this to than the the market shifts of the Great Depression and this Great Depression some of the worst years I think they're pretty definitive about this the worst years of the Great Depression were 1931 1932 in 1933 during the Great Depression industrial production fell almost 50% they say that homebuilding dropped by 80% that in 1933 alone unemployment rose to 25% I think it was like the high-water mark of unemployment in 1933 25 percent of the American population was unemployed there was 15 million people over 15 million people unemployed 5,000 banks closed over all during the Great Depression and in 1933 alone four thousand banks closed during the Great Depression it is said by many that it was the worst hard time these are people that endured even moving out west and settling and digging up land that had never been farmed before and all the travails of pioneering the west and and facing even the uncertainty and difficulty of a world war these are people who had lived through something I had lived even through diseases before and even had lived in the Spanish flu and they're saying hey this is the worst hard time and even the the drought that came in the Midwest and things that were transpiring in Kansas and the panhandles of Oklahoma and Texas and even in Colorado it produced circumstances and situations that were so tried and so terrible they said this is the worst hard time there's ever been and so now as we live there are great speculation about our current social climate there's great speculation about our current economic conditions and there's a lot of uncertainty how are things going to be going forward in light of the corona virus how are things going to go forward in light of our economic crisis and so we're drawing our comparisons from what has been what has happened in the Spanish flu what happened during the Great Depression can we use those things to understand the time we're living we're living in now and I want to say this before I go forward it depends on what you're looking at whether or not you're going to get something that's really useful because our greatest danger in times like these it's not the infectious disease it's not even the economic uncertainty or even economic difficulty now I'm speaking to the elect our greatest danger is not the disease itself our greatest danger is not the economy itself because we're not just merely Americans that are trying to endure this great impact of a pandemic we're not just Americans or Congolese or we're not just we're not just Canadians whatever it might be however you would identify yourself we're not just human beings enduring a crisis and trying to make it through government government restrictions as the bride of Jesus Christ we have a different identity as the bride of Jesus Christ we have a different promise as a matter of fact I would go so far to say that is the bride of Jesus Christ we are governed and moved by a greater law that we're not just merely subject to a governmental restrictions you ever stay at home or do you have a social distancing of six feet listen we've been under social distancing as the elect for a very very long time because we've been told it as a believer you've got to separate yourself from your worldly friends because they only call you back into the world again we've had a healthy fear and a healthy reservation of social media we've applied the token to our homes and kicked the television out listen we've been social distancing from the very moment that God has called us into this blessed truth why because the Bible says brother Branham said that when we caught we heard that Eagle scream we heard from our theophany we left the other thing why we have been governed by a greater law for a long time we're not just merely governed by the economic we're not governed by the physical as we believe right now many of us are doing it rightfully and we're doing it respectfully we're rendering under Caesar Caesar's but listen we must always and unto God God's we don't just merely render unto Caesar but the Bible tells us the very same scripture we're using right now to stay at home to social distance to not have the congregation assemble together says that we're gonna render under Caesar Caesars but we must also render under God God's when he asked us to do we must also do for him and the danger is I'm really coming to my thesis here my real the real fest of my inspiration the real danger as I mentioned a moment ago is not the disease it's not the economy the danger is if we're not careful if we're not diligent we will only be hearing what the world hears ponder this if we're not careful if we're not diligent we'll only be seen what the world is seeing what will we hear what everyone else is hearing we'll only see what everyone else does see we're going to the same world don't meet or we're going to John Hopkins we're going to this blog we're going to this podcast we're what following this person on Twitter we're listening to the news we're consuming all the data we can we're catching our governors announcements in the afternoon what's what's the latest on kovat 19 what's the latest response what's the latest data telling us and if we're not careful that's all we're hearing but let me take it a step further that the bride with the bride is looking at what the bride is listening to is different than what everyone else is seeing and what is different than whatever else is hearing and let me put it in this context as the bride of Jesus Christ we're not just listening to the data and the numbers if they say 500 people got sick in North Carolina yesterday then the whole world can hear that and understand the data of it but we're not just merely listening to the numbers we're here in a different voice something totally different than the data and the information and the noise that's out there but let me make this even a little bit more personal we're not even listening to the same thing that nominal Christians are listening to every pulpit right now is preaching some of the same things all around the world and when I say every pulpit I'm not referring only to message pulpits I'm referring to every home Bible study every home meeting you go online you'll see that the Pentecostal churches are doing services like this the Lutheran Church the Baptist Church every single nation every independent every nondenominational are all gathering within their homes they're doing sunday-school zoom meetings they're doing living-room specials they're doing all sorts of things to keep the body together to keep the dynamics of church continuing and many of the preachers in the world today nominal even message believers are preaching this thing so I'm not trying to make a distinction on the subject matter we're all hearing the same thing because every pulpit is preaching about the Exodus you're in many many ministers today out even in the nominal world and even we as message believers myself included our pastor included we're looking at the Exodus as a point of reference for what we're going through now and we're hearing Exodus chapter 7 through 13 we're hearing about the plagues that afflicted Egypt we're hearing about how the the children of Israel had liked in their dwellings during the time of the plague of darkness we're hearing about how there was a token that was applied to keep them from the plague of death and he's a lot of the themes that are being rehearsed in everyone's ears right now second chronicles chapter 7 verses 13 and 14 is is read a lot right now let me just read it to you and this is the light that the nominal world is putting it in second chronicles chapter 7 verse 13 if I shut up the heaven that there be no rain and they're saying look at what was happening in Australia there was wildfires in Australia there's unprecedented droughts that's causing a human a crisis of humanity in Australia and says and or if I command the locusts to devour the land and it's a great epic of locusts are sweeping through Africa and this is something that's catching everyone's attention minders droughts in Australia's locust sweeping through the land he says where if I send the pestilence among my people and so you say well wild powers fires in a drought in Australia locusts in Africa now a pestilence or disease that comes upon the entire world all the people well this gets everybody's attention drought locusts now a disease says if my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will hear their land all the pulpits in the world are probably preaching from this scripture most ministers maybe a majority of preachers in the world today have caught this this connection and you know what many men of God within the message who are the true voice of God in this age to the elect to build them up in the faith they're taking these things and using them they're appropriately to help us and to encourage us but listen we can't just be hearing the same thing the world is hearing many are hearing Psalms 91 and I think that scriptures probably been used more now than there ever has been used before how that there's pestilence and the snare of the Fowler and the noise and pestilence and pestilence that walketh in darkness and destruction that wasteth at noonday but it won't come 90 if you make the LORD thy God thy habitation of the evil befall thee no plague shall come nigh thy dwelling and it's talking about that all those different verses there in Psalms 91 are being used to encourage us rightfully because it's the Word of God but it's also being used in the nominal world Psalms 91 is being used by more people around the world today than it's ever been used before perhaps and then a lot of people are preaching from Isaiah 26 this one is a very interesting one and verse 20 come my people enter thou into thy chambers enter thou into thy house is what one translation renders it as and shut thy doors about thee hide thyself as it were for a little moment until the indignation of the wrath be over past here's a scripture that we could use even to encourage believers the Bible tells you there's a time when you have to go to your homes you can have a stay at home order shelter in place as the language used in some states closer nor hide yourself for a little while until this time this indication this disease or whatever the uncertainty is until it be over passed and that scriptures being used and then there's also other scriptures in Matthew chapter 24 where it speaks of pestilences and famines in Luke chapter 21 and plagues such but there shall be famines and pestilence and earthquakes and diverse places talking about how that there's going to be a Great Tribulation that's never been seen before Luke chapter 21 men's hearts failing them for fear for the things which are coming on the earth these are the scriptures that are being used right now over every pulpit in the world perhaps and I know I'm speculating because I haven't taken the time or last few weeks to listen to every sermon over every pulpit so maybe just give me the the latitude there a little bit to speculate that these things are being preached over most pulpits but I want to just point out there we're hearing these things in denominational realms we're hearing them properly placed even within the message and I want to emphasize with the voice that's coming with these scriptures that we must be seeing something different than what the nominal person is hearing we must be seeing something different than what the world is seen when they look at these scriptures we must be hearing something different when these things that rehearsed in our ears because even if we go to some of these scriptures there's things that we can begin to point out even in Psalm 91 in 2nd chronicles 7 Isaiah 26 and I'll just start here in Matthew chapter 24 let me commend you for having a wonderful pull and attentiveness to the Word of God your pastor brother Matthew can attest to this you can sense a pull on the Word of God as you minister even in a sanctuary that's nearly empty air is all empty except for my family today in living rooms that maybe it's just you you there's a pool in the Word of God the man of God can feel that and let me commend you and thank you for that the wonderful expectation and pool you have on the word but let me look at Matthew chapter 24 right in the middle of all these things about famines and plagues and pestilences and those things it says for wheresoever verse 28 for wheresoever the carcase is there will the eagle's be gathered together you read Matthew chapter 24 hundred times say lo he's here lo he's there could it be this this is it here it is there it is hid this is it we have a word right there in the midst of Matthew 24 in a time of pestilence and famines right there a time of earthquakes we're not gathered to the the need in the famine we're not gathered to the reality of the earthquake we're not gathered to those things right in the middle that comes is where the carcass is there the Eagles are gathered they're not gathered around the news what's happening with the earthquakes what's happening with the famines what's happening to the pestilence right in the time of all that there's a gathering that's taking place and a time reverence is low he's here low he's there the Eagles are gathered to the carcass and what are we taught and anointed ones at the end time brother man said the son of man is Christ says in another place he is those seals he's the one that opened those seals says the son of man is Christ he's the one that you're feeding on why because we're the carcasses they're the Eagles will be gathered you're not feeding on a man a man his words will fail but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the man that's what we're feeding on today why because in the midst of famines and earthquakes and pestilences there's been a gathering to the unfailing body word of the son of man I'm not feeding on that famine I'm not feeding on those pestilences I'm not feeding on though the outcome and the fallout of earthquakes I'm feeding on the unfailing body word of the Son of Man and if you read that statement he says it gives yourself to give yourself strength to fly above these denominations and the things of the world so at a time of famines at a time of earthquakes there's something else you're feeding on that gives you spiritual strength to fly above what's taking place in the world does that mean you want endure an earthquake does that mean you won't endure maybe the fallout of food shortages if they thought it has nothing to do with that it's a different reality that were connected to and tied to Matthew chapter 24 verse 35 heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away right there in the time of this famines and pestilences and earthquakes in diverse places and the beginning of Sorrows all these things he's talking about he's some of the coming of the Son of Man in those very passages about only the elect not being able to be deceived and how deceptive those times will be right now we can take those things and ponder them and realize it's challenge to focus on something else because heaven and earth will pass away but his word will never pass away verse 45 woo then is the faithful and wise servant whom his Lord hath made ruler over his household to give them meat in due season so we have meat in due season there can be a worldly famine but we have meat and due season there can be things taking place all throughout the world but we have a word which will never pass away there's a lot of gatherings around a lot of rumors and opinions but we've been gathered to the unfailing body word of the son of man I love how it's written in Luke chapter 21 because his men's hearts are filling for fear and all these things but a couple verses later says when these things begin to come to pass then look up now it's not talking about physically looking up it's not talking out naturally with your eyes begin to gaze at the skies he says and lift up your heads for your Redemption draweth nigh when these things begin to happen it's time of your spiritual attitude your spiritual expectations let it change that you're not not your natural gaze or your natural I don't mean looking up don't be looking down don't worry about how the natural eye is oriented what are you looking at I'm looking above it my reading I'm looking to something that's been revealed in this day from heaven that excites me and invigorates me and moves me along in God's channel times like this I've lifted up my spiritual attitude I've lifted up my spiritual expectation and I'm looking at something totally different well as the bride we are looking at something different we are listening and hearing another voice we're listening to the voice of revelations 18:4 come out of her my people that you receive not of her plagues why there's a voice that goes for it that calls us out of denominational systems we've heard that voice come out of here my people that we've been uh partakers of her plagues and those plagues aren't the things that are in the world today it's a plague coming in Revelations 19 at a time of tribulation after the bride is gone to the wedding supper in the sky that's the voice that we've heard we haven't heard a message that says now if you'll do this and you'll do that then you don't ever have a worry about the flu you don't ever have to worry about cancer you don't ever have to worry about divorce or or our disease or loss of a job no we have a promise of provision but he's never promised that we would live a life without affliction many are the afflictions of the righteous they that live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution as brother john kaufman shared it with me this past week he shares me how that we are free from the wrath of god but he doesn't say we're exempt from the wrath of man there's a lot of things that men can do that can cause great calamity even in our natural lives where this this virus spreads throughout all the world and message believers succumb to it and are infected in sickness but even in that time when we're sick we can believe by His stripes I'm healed his promise isn't that we wouldn't get sick but his promise is by His stripes I'm healed but we have heard another voice that's called us out of Babylon that we not receive those plagues which the last plague is spiritual death revelations chapter 3 verse 20 we heard another voice behold I stand at the door knock any man hear my voice only the bride hears this voice and open the door I will come into him and know sup with him and he with me that's the those are the things that we're hearing right now we're not connected to CNN we're not connected to AP News we're not connected to Bloomberg or comm we're not listening just to all those things we're connected to something different I want to go further in this I know time may seem to be getting away but I want to be sure that we just delivered this burden on our hearts from the Lord I believe it's not happenstance at all that your pastor felt led to ask me and I feel honored to be able to do this to be able to minister the word but let me say our message does not change in light of current events when current events happen when things begin to transpire around us and things are turned upside-down in the way we expected things done forward doesn't unfold exactly the way we thought it would it doesn't change our message that has already been divinely revealed and given by God modern events do not make the message clear and I know in your mind you're already thinking of the modern events made clear by prophecy and I want to read a statement from there in a moment but the things that happen around us don't make the message clear but the message makes clear the modern events and if that's so if the message is what makes things clear that when things like this begin to happen we don't change our focus we don't begin to emphasize what's been taking place around us we don't change our focus or emphasis because other things are happening we must keep our focus the same I thought about this it's more of a distraction pandemic than it is actually an infectious disease pandemic that we've got to worry about an epidemic is something that spreads widely perhaps within a community or a state or an area a pandemic is when that same disease has infected the entire world it begins to spread globally we're not in an epidemic we're in a pandemic and let me say that there is a global pandemic of a distraction a disease that has infected the entire Christian world because now everyone's focused on a virus everyone's focusing on a disease everyone's focused on the things that are happening in response to it but what about the bride she's not looking at coronavirus she's not looking at coba 19 she's not looking at the World Health Organization or what the CDC what Donald Trump and all these governors that's not the voice we're hearing the bride is not to be distracted from the Word of God why because her attraction is different as a believer your attraction is the word and your distraction is the world brother branham writes in the church age book no true believers any stronger and spiritually healthy and alive then his knowledge of and adherence to the pure Word of God we cannot be any more stronger than our knowledge of our adherence to the pure Word of God we cannot be any more spiritually healthy than our knowledge of the Word of God and our obedience to the Word of God we cannot be any more alive than our knowledge of the Word of God and our obedience to and our adherence to the Word of God our strength our spiritual health and our liveliness and how live we are depends upon our knowledge and revelation of the word and our obedience to that word therefore if our spiritual health and us being alive in our strength is connected to our understanding of the Word of God our knowledge of the word of God of strength and of salvation and stability is the wisdom and knowledge of the Lord then in times like these a distraction from it corrupts our strength a distraction from the Word of God a distraction from adherence to the Word of God corrupts our health I know it's been said before a lot of us are realizing just how important our relationship with Christ is right now because our relationship with church attendance has been taken away from us and realizing oh my goodness you better have a relationship with Christ and we're beginning to appreciate a personal relationship with Christ in the absence of physically gathering together in our sanctuaries but on the other hand we're also realizing how important that gathering is because God never called us to a relationship with him without there being church and actually said assemble yourselves more so as you see that Day approaching is so we know that this gathering together is a body around the Word of God is something in the word to perfect us and to mature us and we're realizing now this is important and I think my spiritual health and my spiritual growth depends upon the Word of God and the dynamics of the Word of God and a distraction from it corrupts our health God's given a great blessing in a time like this he's giving us a great grace in a time like this but we know that God uses the gather into the local assembly for the strength of the believer and our greatest danger in a time like this is that we take our eyes off the Word of God brother Branham said in modern events made clear by prophecy as his father as we open this word now speak to us directly out of this word that we might know the hour that were living in how are we gonna know the hour limited as he speaks to his word if we know the I were living and then we can prepare for that hour I'm coming to a stretch now where I begin to in the corner I don't if in a baseball analogy I don't know if I'm rounding second or rounding third but I know there's a way home I says how father we look to the word speak to us out of the word that we might know the hour that we're living in that we can prepare for that hour so our preparation for the our living and comes from the word but if we go blindly not knowing who or where or what or where then we don't know how to prepare so if we go blindly that would be going by your own eyesight your own understanding of your own ears then we don't know how to prayer so father prepare so father we pray that you'll let us see the arc there and the door open and the message calling us in grant it through Jesus Christ's name Amen then he takes his text there and Luke where that was the as they walked with him on the road to Emmaus and they were broken up in their hearts and they were discouraged because of great so he says he reads that text he said now it's always been the unchanging God's way to let his people for know before certain events happen and so God has already prepared us God has already shown us given us a message to show us the arc to show us the door open the message constant we've had a voice calling us out of Babylon we've heard a voice at the door we've opened up we're something with him and he with us I am you and you and me it's that day that we're living in and breve I said this is a message to help us to prepare now if you want to look at the text which we read and I want to launch into this now and begin to look at this as we're thinking about these words we need to have the Word of God the voice of God to help us prepare for that hour to help us to see the art the door open the message calling us in to give us certainty and stability psalms 105 verses 16 and 17 says moreover he called for a famine upon the land he braked the whole staff of bread this is a famine that came in the land a time of Joseph being in Egypt he says he sent a man before them even Joseph now if you think of the children of Israel those that still remain there with Jacob in the in Palestine or the promised land there was a great famine that went into all the land but God had already placed Joseph in Egypt and think about the circumstances that put him there jealousy among his brethren and he was sold into slavery and he served in a house in slavery until he was falsely accused and was thrown into prison he served time in prison and just by the hand of Lord he's brought out of prison at a certain time he's raised to be the right hand to Pharaoh and he's placed there for what to go before the children of Israel to prepare the land of Egypt for their arrival so Joseph made preparation and what was Joseph doing in a time of Plenty he was making preparation for a lean time he was making preparation during a time of wonderful Plenty and things were gonna be very bountiful he was making preparation then so that when the children of Israel came and the sons of Jacob came to Egypt looking for grain there had already be provision to sustain the sons of Israel by what a beautiful promise to think that God placed one man in Egypt not necessary for all of Egypt though they benefited but for the survival and the strength of God's promised seed and the seed of Abraham so Joseph went before them he made preparation for their survival and if he looked at it and the time that we're living in now as he said he called for a famine upon the land in Amos chapter 8 verses 11 and 12 it says behold the days come saith the Lord that I'll send a famine in the land not a famine of bread nor thirst for water but of hearing the words of Lord so the famine is not food supply shortages the famine is not for Amazon Prime getting there next day delivery the famine isn't for natural things the famine is for the hearing of the word of the Lord and they shall wander from sea to sea and from north to the east even to east they shall be run to and fro to seek the word the Lord and shall not find it I would love to amplify this more with you this this morning but I've got to just press further in this there's a lot of different ways we can begin to line this up to the message of the hour but what does brother Branham point us to in spiritual food and due season he says now we're going to type that with the spiritual drought of today he says there's a great spiritual drought and the landed a spiritually speaking it was predicted by the prophets and he refers to Amos chapter 8 here and that day is now hearing the true Word of God there's a famine for hearing the true Word of God so we can say there is a spiritual plague upon all the world where they cannot hear here the true Word of God he says now this types the natural drought drought with the spiritual sin and unbelief by false teachers and modernists in the church has brought the place to this coming judgement on coming judgement then they turned from God's Word and his prophet to modern theological terms of the word you notice here it's just at that time that God always raises up something so in brother bruh I'm saying that there's a famine in the land for hearing the true Word of God he's saying that the famine will not always exist even though these modernists and these theologians and these churches and all these things they'll exist in a famine at a time of the famine at a time of a great curse upon the earth where you're not hearing the true Word of God God is always raising up something it's at that time that God raises up something and we could go back and even look at the spiritual climate of Laodicea back there in the early 1900's in the 20th century when many of these modern events are unfolding and God was up to something even while the Pentecost was going to the chaos and Laodicea is descending into organizations and and the real fruit of what God was during that age is beginning to dry them God was still up to something right under the nose of the Economist right under the nose of the scientists right under the nose of all the theologians God was up to something so let me take you back now to what we were referring to before about these two points of reference in a time of trouble in this great time that we're living in now if I could look at it from the economic standpoint referred to in the beginning it was during the worst economic disaster that America had ever seen that God was raising up something because brother Graham says God always raises up something great depression from 1929 to 1939 the worst years were 1931 1932 1933 there was the worst years of the economic situation in America and why all that's unfolding preparation was being made why as we took from Psalms 105 from a natural standpoint he sent Joseph before them to make preparation for the time that they were going to be living in and so while this great depressions unfolding in the land 1931 begins one of the worst stretches ever in the history of the Great oppression one of the worst stretches ever of our economic history as Americans in 1931 that was the year that brother Branham was saved right in the midst of one of the worst years of the Great Depression salvation is coming to a young man God is birthing him into the body of Christ then in 1932 it's in that year one of the worst years of the Great Depression it's in that year that brother Branham was ordained to preach the gospel 31:32 then in 1933 during probably the worst year yet of the Great Depression right in the midst of the greatest economic crisis America has ever seen four thousand banks closing twenty five percent unemployment and droughts something ravaging all over all over the Midwest right there in the midst of that worst time on June 11th 1933 brother Graham's baptizing new converts in the Ohio River and is he's baptizing the 17th person to water a pillar of fire appears on the river and the voice of God bellows out from that pillar fire it says as John the Baptist for on the second first coming of the Lord Jesus Christ so shall your ministry for run the second coming to the Lord Jesus Christ right there in the worst year the Great Depression God was up to something right then when men were looking politically in control and economics and a new deal in all these different ways to avoid an economic disaster God was raising something up as John the Baptist for and the first coming of Jesus Christ so will your ministry for in his second coming it was during the worst hard time that the Lord Himself appeared to Commission a prophet the economic conditions were not the absolute God wasn't waiting till America's in a better place economically God wasn't waiting until the weather was better in the Midwest God wasn't waiting until there was no disease of these different things those things didn't hinder God's plans those things didn't shape God's plans and it could be pointed out that God can use whether he can use earthquakes he can use droughts he can use whirlwinds and hurricanes he can use all sorts of things and disease to move his people he can use those things to break our will to break our stubbornness but ultimately it's the Word of God listen it's ultimately the Word of God that moves it motivates and matures his bride if the Word of God that moves and motivates a mature his bride gods just not merely gonna use external forces and external factors to mature the word has got to be the Word of God has to be placing things into perspective the word gene has to be down on the inside of you if it was just calamity that perfected people then there'd be a lot of more perfect people than there was but there's got to be a word that's a part of that it's got to be a promise there's got to be an absolute that's connected to it and so God can use a lot of things in your life to get your attention the loss of a job the loss of the loved one a very difficult situation but at the end of day it's the word that you look to to move you to motivate you and to mature you so right there and the great depression when we look to the economic standpoint we're trying to look at factors what are we facing now what are we facing out there's something we as believers can look to to say hey right in the middle of that God was up to something and that should get us thinking about what we're looking at that should help us to answer the questions this is well what are you looking at it would help to say I know exactly what I'm looking at and so let me just look at it from the pandemic standpoint we mentioned the Spanish flu the worst years of the Spanish flu from 1918 to 1920 those are the worst years of the Spanish flu but they say that it may have begun and they're pretty certain some of them very certain about when it would have at least started was 1916 so we've already seen a type of during that from the economic standpoint now let me just mention something quickly to you from a pandemic standpoint 1916 Spanish flu begins to spread it finds it's infection into a human body it begins to spread maybe begins as an epidemic and then it begins to spread globally and now everyone's recognized in 1918 but right there 1916 seven-year-old boy named William Branham is walking and a whirlwind catches in to a bush and from that Bush a voice speaks and says don't you drink or smoke chew drink or defile your body in any way there'll be a work for you to do when you get older right there in 1916 God meets a young boy and threw a pillar of fire through a whirlwind in a bush and speaks or says don't smoke don't drink don't chew don't defile your body anyway because I have a work for you to do what was happening God was calling his prophet there's very one that we mentioned in the beginning was telling us that their survival systems that don't won't work you've got to go with the word of the Lord the very one that tell us that God has an ark for us to look to the very one that says we've got to know what God's Word says about for this day so we can know how to progress in venture and step forward with official Authority it's a reminder that during these times of a pandemic then these kinds of an economic collapse we look at the word what are you looking at I'm looking at the Word of God we're not governed by natural forces we're not governed by the natural things around us I'm not dependent upon what my governor says about stay-at-home owners I have a different promise I'm not dependent on whether or not COBIT 19 comes near my home I'm not worried about all those things those aren't the things that God is using to put me where I need to be God's not using those things alone to get my attention I've heard another voice it says in Psalm 105 verse 17 he sent a man before them even Joseph's so think about it now as we try to bring this I think I've maybe had maybe about a year here are a year sorry for some of you may have felt like a year already I've been preaching but I think I'm coming up maybe on an hour of ministry and in this in this service he sent a man before them so God deals with Israel after the flesh think about this now we're gonna read a quote from Feast of Trumpets very quickly just to put all this into perspective he deals with Israel after the flesh so Joseph was in the land of Egypt for a physical preparation for a famine that was coming so God used famine he actually used natural circumstance to put Joseph in Egypt he then uses natural famine to reunite the sons of Israel and Jacob with with Joseph he's using natural circumstances to unite them together to bring them in a natural union then he uses bondage and cruel taskmasters to cause look that people in this strange land to cry out for deliverance and even desire in Exodus then of the time of their exes he brought plagues to soften their hearts for that Exodus and he brought plagues and signs and wonders to get them to believe in their prophet all to bring them out of a natural land into a nother natural land those are all the ways that God dealt with Israel it was all after the flesh and that's how God used this man that went before him to make preparation for Israel but the bride is different God doesn't move us through the natural things but supernatural things yes there was supernatural what God was doing with Joseph it was supernatural God was doing with Israel but God deals with them uniquely differently than he does the Gentiles they have circumcision of the flesh we have circumcision of the heart a lot of different things we could expound upon in that life that type but brother Brennan and theses of trumpets is now watch the natural Israel in the spiritual church as we separated here he says turned loose on the Jews so there's these two hundred million demons were poured out naturally upon the Jews he says now in paragraph 182 now the ecclesiastical realm has been opened from the natural eye of the old pagan Rome which went forth to the Jews which has always been their enemy so these spiritual demons were once a the revival of old pagan Rome which physically persecuted the Jews but now he's saying it's loose and the ecclesiastical church spirit loosed upon what not upon the denominations but upon the bride so there's been a spiritual loosened upon the brain so she's not promised a physical tribulation physical persecution for her perfection and for her her salvation or to put her in her homeland she's not promised that to put her in the meeting in the air he says but here you'll get it the bride will not go through that time the Bible says the body the Bible says the Bible says not the church will but not the bride can't you see ministers can't you see that brethren you say the church has to go through the persecution for the perfection of it the blood of Jesus Christ perfects the bride it's the blood of Jesus Christ that perfects the bride it's not the economic difficulty it's not persecution here in persecution there we are looking to strengthen else's bleeding bloody word in this last days that's the perfection of the bride that's what he's dressing us and not calamities and afflictions and persecutions but his word builder branham's ask the questions in question and answers this is after he preaches peace of the trumpets will the bride go through persecution as the early apostles taluk church did now think about this will the bride go through persecution as the early apostolic church did now we're being restored back to the book of Acts we say and we're gonna repeat the book of Acts a lot of different languages we use he says no I just explained that a few minutes ago No the next thing is a rapture now we're at the border he's saying so the next thing for us is a rapture the next thing we're looking for isn't persecution the next thing we're looking for isn't physical situations and physical circumstances as a signifier of what's taking place he says that the next thing is the rapture so what are we preparing for I'm preparing for a change in my body we're preparing for a translation we're preparing for a meeting in the air we're preparing for a millennium we're not preparing for persecution we're not preparing for tribulation and if we're not preparing for tribulation when all these things happen out there we shouldn't be looking at that we should keep our eyes on the artwork what are we looking at if we're being prepared we've got to be looking at the thing that's preparing us brother Branham says I believe that through the seven thunders will we be revealed in the last days in order to get the bride together for rapturing faith so if he says in 64 the next thing is the rapture then we had to have those seven thunders be revealed for rapture in faith so what is getting us ready the revelation of those seven thunders and anointed ones again he says the third pulls the open e of the word the misters revealed the third pull was the older than seven seals to reveal the hidden truth that's been sealed in the word I'm just laying this in very quickly to ask you what are you looking at what's preparing you the economic situation is not going to prepare you that the physical situation is not going to be Prairie to prepare you it's the revelation of the Word of God that prepares you that's the opening of those seven seals that's going to give the bride rapturing faith it's the third pull the open of the word the open the seals the reading revealed hidden truth that's been revealed to us in this hour the unfailing body word of the son of man that's what's going to prepare us for that meeting in the air that's what is preparing us for the meeting there now you can say well brother Branham I when brother Branham talked about it look away to Jesus I believe what about what about the tightening what about the press the term that's often uses the squeeze what about the squeeze what about the press what about the tightening go back and read the quote he says watch the third pull then hey man praise the Lord our view doesn't change if there's gonna be a squeeze if there's going to be a tighten if there's going to be a press God when Turpin is one by bringing it to pass but our view is no different he says watch the third pole what are we looking at we're looking at the revealed word of the hour that's what's making clear the things that are happening around us and in Psalms 105 verse 19 until the time that his word came until the time that the promise was completely fulfilled to his word came that means finished the word of the Lord tried him the bride showdown is not an economic showdown the bride showdown is not a physical showdown the bride's chest is on a material one it's not about money it's not about possessions it's not about our health we're not tried the bride trial is not in those things Wow the natural world is tried by possessions the entire world is being tried right now by a health crisis the entire world's being tried by an economic crisis will God use it for us differently absolutely but where's our real test where's our real trial how's the bride tried and found to be different than the rest of the world it's the word that tries us Villeurbanne said in God of this evil age we find now this evil age is to prove to Satan she is not like Eve that she's not that type of the woman and she will be tried by his word the bride as Adams bride was tried by the word if there's any persecution if there's any pandemic if there's any kind of pressure that we experience it's a pressure to try to drive you away from the word so we've got to stay connected to the Word of God when the Titan comes watch the third pole when a health crisis comes watch the third pole when job difficulties come watch the third pole our view doesn't change in light of the things that's taking place around us watch the Word of God keep your eyes on the third pole while we're being tried by the Word of God until the time that his word was finished the word of the Lord tried to him until the time of the fulfillment of all the prophecies in this day the bride will be tried by the word until the time that we meet him in the air the bride will be tried by the word what happened to Eve he says tried as as Adams bride was tried by the word Eve took her eyes off the promise the bride proves she's not like Eve what she keeps her eyes steadfast on that promise what are you looking at I just have two quotes to end with you end with today one from recognizing your day in its message another one from what is the attraction on the Mount I'm just gonna I'm gonna be closing here we've been right at an hour to some of you maybe right at a year to others I could say brother man said the believer the bride could sit hour after hour drinking in these things so maybe we're getting close to that after hour but listen as I share these last two quotes with you so we're pondering what's taking place today what are you looking at and we've already seen in the Word of God that when the world was suffering America was suffering the world was suffering God always raises up something and there was God raising up a prophet what does that tell us at a time like this he's already gone before us prepared a message opened up a door into an arc that is our place of safety recognizing your day in its message remember how in feast of the trumpets these are priests very very close together recognizing your Danis message preached a week after Feast of the trumpets you have natural Israel spiritual bride natural things to Israel spiritual things to the bride he says look Israel back in a promised land she don't know how she got back there says she was just automatically putting back there why national force put her in her place what was it the tender hand of Jehovah actually murdered millions of Jews to get the people into the Promised Land so that that olive branch that olive tree could bring forth the bud that this is what God was doing in that time he says national forests put her in her place she says now I'm going to say something he wants us to catch this because he's preaching from Hosea recognizing your day in its message and he's dealing with Israel but what's the revelation we have a message in this recognizing I regret it's missus not Israel's Dana Israel's message but our Dana's message your program said that we look to Israel and it is like our it like a calendar and you don't stare at a calendar we're not always just looking at Israel what Israel doing what's Israel do what Israel we can look at it to get an orientation of an overall time we're living it but we look to the word to know the second the day the moment that we're living in he says national force put her in her place now I'm going to say something National Forest put Israel a homeland national force will put the church and the World Council of Churches so national forest national conditions national efforts national laws all sorts of nationalism will put the church in its the World Council of Churches will put Israel in their homeland but the power of God will put the people in the bride it's not the natural things that accomplish it but the power of God will put the people in the bride the world forces this way the world forces that way but God forces upward the Spirit of God which is the Word of God it is the word of God my word is feared in life we'll put the bride in her place it is the word that positionally places you think of this believers and this time right now uncertainty the stability of our times is the Word of God it is the word that will put us in our place because she'll recognize her position in the word heyyyyyy men shall recognize her position order then she's in Christ it will put her in her place no national force will do it if I'm looking for my preparation for a meeting in the air I'm not looking to the CDC I'm not looking to the w-h-o I'm not looking to presidents and governors and mayors and municipalities I'm looking to the Word of God to prepare me national force will not do it but national force did drive Israel to the homeland national forces of the Council of Churches will drive every organization into it but the power of God will raise the bride and the glory out of it what's raising us up you're feeding on the unfailing body Word of the son of man to give you strength to fly above denominations and the things of the world what a resurrection this is right now by the Word of God that's our way of escape that's our safety revelations chapter 19 there's a marriage that comes and this is blessed is he who is called to the marriage supper of the lamb why because she is the bride who escapes all the tribulation that begins to come upon the face of the earth because she was looking at something different she heard a voice of revelations 18 for she heard a knock of revelations 3:20 she was gathered as an eagle where the carcass is there will the eagle's be gathered maybe you could just bow your head as I read this last quote I want you to focus now very intently before we turn the service over to brother Peter we'll pray a word of prayer to you and then we'll turn it to brother Peter and maybe he's gonna lead you in worship whatever the custom is or whatever the order the services were completely yielded to it now we have our heads bowed there's a real reverence an anointing where I met I hope that it's the same I'm believing it's the same for some children of God now in what does the attraction on the Mount brother mem says the same thing is taking place he's talking about how they are the great commotion that was there when he came riding into Jerusalem then the commotion on the day of Pentecost it's the same thing as taking place the same questions being asked what's all the racket look up and down the street now this is what's happening brother branham's day right now July 25th 1965 look down the street cars from Michigan to Florida from Maine to California this morning when I was riding out right after noon was going down the street my wife and I was looking at the licenses on the cars that's where I thought of this text what meaneth this just as it said where the carcass is there the Eagles will gather what was drawn them all together 1965 the word was being opened up the unfailing body word was being preached and he begins to read the lines of seeing the lines of the song they come from the east and west to feast with our king beholding his hallowed face and he says that's what the attraction is we're feasting right now with our King we're dining as his bride now we're beholding his face that's what the attraction is and I read from the world is falling apart he says remember it's our life he says here and what is the attraction he says the predestination seat of God who can't do nothing else but follow it follow this body word of the son of man follow where this feast is taking us following his face the predestinated seat of God who can't do nothing else but follow it it means more than life to us take our lives but you don't take that what is attraction God as usual fulfilling his word what are you looking at maybe some of you had your heads up and I looked into the cameras and what are you looking at now I got your attention what are you looking at are you looking at his word that's been fulfilled that's making preparation that's gone before us or you look into all the things around us and let me say it now from the depths of my heart that as the bride of Jesus Christ we must be hearing something different than what every pulpits preaching right now we must be hearing something different than what's being said through blogs and podcasting in dot-coms and dot orgs and all these things we must be here in a different voice how we must be seeing something different we must be hearing something different whatever was feeding you before this crisis took hold that's what we need to keep feeding on if the Word of God was being opened up to us if the Word of God was being revealed to us and it was feeding us to fly above the denomination's our focus doesn't change now it actually becomes clearer it actually becomes more dis more ardent and more disciplined I'm gonna look at this word because that's what's gonna change me as you continue to keep your heads bowed I want to pray with you he says it means more than life to us take her lies but don't you take that go God as we bow our heads if you have need of prayer maybe you just want to slip your hand up open up your heart to him now you could take my life Lord by way of a disease you could take it by sickness you could take it by a lot of different ways Lord whatever you do don't take this word from me don't take this promise from me Lord you can take my job you could take my comforts you could take away a lot of things in this world but don't take this message from me these more than life to me that's your hearts cry your hearts open before and we pray now our gracious Heavenly Father as we stand in your presence today as many are sitting maybe Lehane may be kneeling lord whatever it might be with hands raised but hearts open to you Lord we've been asked the question what are you looking at and our answer is now Lord we're beholding your face we're looking to you in this time of trouble you've hit us in the secret of your tabernacle Lord there we're dining with you were feasting at the Kings table in the presence of our enemies a full-course meal for all seven seals have been open to those that believe and to those who can receive it that's what we've been taught in this hour the Lord I I feel no unction at all in my heart as a man of God to rebuke the people to correct the people Lord it Wells up within me as a reminder that this message is precious to us it's what we must be feeding on and looking to during a time like this for all times Lord because Lord if I could just inject maybe my personal thought as I ponder Lord I think things will get back to our normal where we'll just get back into a routine and maybe some things will be different Lord we've been used to taking our shoes off to go on an airplane and having less than three ounces in bottles Lord as we board planes and we've gotten used to it Lord and yes there were some changes and inconveniences but for the most part things flourish there's a time of peace and a time of Plenty Lord I could see that the whole world would just get back to a new normal everything will be the same again but to the bride Lord will be focused more intently on you as our pastor here at Hickory Bible Tabernacle preached today in a time of desperation that's when people used me begin to call upon the Lord the Lord you've worked in our hearts to remind us at a time like this that the word were feeding on is what's producing and materializing a new body so Lord of things return back to normal soon to us we'll still remain in this mode watch the third pull feed on the unfailing body Word of the Son of Man we have eagles have been gathered to your carcass and I pray for Tucson Tabernacle what I thank you that you sent a man to him brother Matthew Watkins to be there with them during a time like this help guide them through uncertainty Lord I pondered it deeply as one who has a deep burden for the people there Tucson how just the right time you gave them a pastor to navigate a time like this because Lord who knows whether or not a body could survive complete being shut down Lord who knows what would have been and I know I may be speculating something but lord I see your hand of provision I see your love Lord I pray that now and your sovereign presence and the love that they feel in their hearts right now that you would just encourage them to keep looking at the right thing I commit them to you now Lord I pray you bless brother Matthew Lord as their pastor that you bless the Deacons and the trustees and bless the song leaders and the musicians father may you may you awaken them to they were gathering the a greater reality of the gathering that's taken place I commit them to you asking your richest blessings upon them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen praise the Lord but the Matthew god bless you thank you for the privilege of being here to minister we love you all very much we hope to see you
