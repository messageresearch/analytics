[36:39] just so these things so the toxic waste
[36:45] itself down an apron can they release
[36:48] everything
[37:59] and some of us can watch them and so
[38:06] that was her fear was so the money
[38:17] evening inspired me the pressor plan and
[38:23] was all spring she she said God who
[38:31] knows change
[38:33] and she said that this is what he needs
[38:36] to do the network they talked about
[38:39] putting a catheter and really which is
[38:42] easier new but in this report we're here
[38:46] you just wait down on your chest wall
[38:48] right into the Penguins next to your
[38:50] heart so it's not something that just
[38:52] thought you'd be here and it didn't work
[38:56] so the doctor said I'm going to give you
[38:58] surgery but potassium level had a
[39:01] Crystal Eye to the point and all these
[39:11] changes so that's when the nitrous to be
[39:15] sure there's other churches requirement
[39:18] they and all and she just asked for
[39:38] prayer and then about four o'clock that
[39:41] she's in surgery
[39:43] we waited almost not very well he asked
[40:00] your father your mother if it's okay to
[40:02] do this she'll say I'm old enough
[40:10] [Music]
[41:02] as I began to look at you know if we've
[41:06] been doing service on Serena this still
[41:10] ties into that look Sunday afternoon we
[41:15] were really mad a pitcher and SME were
[41:18] speaking with someone that needed some
[41:21] encouragement north and as we finish we
[41:24] pray for my brother Matt was praying I'm
[41:36] looking down turbulent water
[42:45] [Music]
[43:22] [Music]
[43:36] it's really small so my but yesterday
[43:48] it's the time we'll bring them here to
[43:51] me and this one is speaking about
[43:53] children but watches are you encompassed
[43:56] with needs this very moment and almost
[43:59] over with difficulties trials and
[44:02] emergencies they are reminded by the
[44:05] vessels
[44:26] giving you an opportunity to see him
[44:29] move and see them do something but when
[44:44] you go it takes a matter of jeans don't
[44:50] want to so it is this finding and if
[44:57] you've got right the understood their
[44:59] meaning they could become opportunities
[45:01] opportunities for receiving blessings
[45:04] and deliverances
[45:07] [Music]
[45:10] vessels family beforehand interpreter
[45:19] keep still be still to do nothing that
[45:29] he does not himself command you to give
[45:32] him a chance to work and it will surely
[45:34] do so and the very trials that threat to
[45:37] overcome with
[46:02] as good as what a source
[46:06] god bless apply his riches in glory what
[46:10] a channel Christ Jesus is your sweetness
[46:15] replace all your beats over against his
[46:18] riches and lose sight of the farmer in
[46:21] the presence of the batter when you
[46:23] beginner behind what he has
[46:25] how about ways which and it says his
[46:32] exhaust which treasures don't open to
[46:35] you and all of our gold and draw upon it
[46:39] in the artists simplicity effects and
[46:43] you will never application to the
[46:46] creature stream or
[47:39] [Music]
[47:44] who has so if you're set
[47:49] just enter your netid your soul in the
[47:51] evening dress if you're perplexing this
[47:54] dress remember me I'll be with you
[47:56] always even to the end of the world all
[48:00] things work together for good to them
[48:02] that love the Lord
[48:03] so just statement one man broke a photo
[48:07] my anchor holes in the bed what is it
[48:10] well it's something that shuts off from
[48:15] here from there and as I started to read
[48:18] and read how much time were focused on
[48:21] that here all that I've seen all this is
[48:25] happening right here but behind the veil
[48:28] the anchor holes and so he's saying it
[48:33] shut off from here to there any actors
[48:35] on the inside
[49:01] blessed assurance Jesus is mine oh what
[49:05] a foretaste of error salvation purchase
[49:09] of God he says nature child you know
[49:28] that God told me to bring me up so
[49:30] that's amazing
[49:31] I want the assurance of coming out I
[49:34] want to say it all set that big dark
[49:36] channel that set before each one of us
[49:38] every time our heartbeat we go must step
[49:42] closer than a big dark it's called death
[49:44] but when I come to the end of my journey
[49:47] to my heart stopping and B I don't want
[49:51] to be covered I want to wrap myself in
[49:55] the world
[50:02] knowing that when he calls from me money
[50:04] calls from the lung today I'll come out
[50:06] that's amazing that's now when you
[50:28] thought physician
[50:29] you got a benefit to baby crying forget
[50:32] not all his benefits waterfall
[50:38] what a beautiful reading we have there
[50:41] under consideration and we mess
[50:53] sometimes some of the things sometimes a
[50:58] focused on what's happening baby doesn't
[51:09] see but he said I'll never leave you if
[51:15] you go look into the messaging you see
[51:22] let's go get some scriptures here
[51:26] sheriff you this year going to Psalm 62
[51:31] versus five my soul wait thou only one
[51:40] time specific objects for my expectation
[52:00] is from him he only is my rock and my
[52:03] salvation he is my defense i shall not
[52:06] be moved in god is my salvation my glory
[52:10] the rock of my strength and my refuge is
[52:14] in God trust in him at all times you
[52:18] people
[52:19] pour out your heart before him God is
[52:23] with us he trusts in him at all times
[52:29] even when the situation
[52:37] [Music]
[52:50] [Music]
[54:01] so I said this
[54:52] pour out your heart before God is a
[54:55] reference marks and then of course
[54:59] Psalms 23 it probably one of the most
[55:02] read scriptures off the Lord is my
[55:05] shepherd I shall not want he maketh me
[55:09] to lie down in green pastures he leadeth
[55:11] me beside still waters he restoreth my
[55:14] soul
[55:17] and then if somebody will tell you we're
[55:31] going this way but be careful there's
[55:34] robbers there speaks there's there's
[55:37] people that are you know all kinds of
[55:41] things there's lions and tigers
[56:42] [Music]
[56:48] [Music]
[56:56] mine enemies thou anointest my head with
[57:00] oil my cup runneth over and then
[57:02] finishing with it surely goodness and
[57:04] mercy shall follow me all the days of my
[57:06] life and I will dwell in the house of
[57:09] the Lord forever and as I look at that
[57:12] last line and I will dwell in the house
[57:14] of the Lord forever if he is in here
[57:18] you are darling in the house of the Lord
[57:20] forever sometimes we put it well we'll
[57:23] go to the tabernacle that's a house of
[57:25] the Lord we'll go to this no you are the
[57:27] house of the Lord I will do well that
[57:30] will be part he'll be with me he'll
[57:31] never leave me sometimes we put it too
[57:34] far away sometimes we don't include
[57:36] ourselves in there and then in Psalms 27
[57:42] 13 and 14 and this this the Psalms had
[57:45] been in my mind in my heart and I hadn't
[57:48] put it in my notes and a brother posted
[57:51] him for me exactly the scriptures that
[57:54] came up on my on my what I was doing in
[57:56] it they were they were he had posted
[57:58] them so
[57:58] 27 13 14 I would have I had fainted
[58:02] unless I had believed to see the
[58:04] goodness of the Lord in the land of the
[58:06] living
[58:07] or David said I would have despaired I
[58:11] wouldn't even want to enjoy I would have
[58:13] given up I would have thrown my hands
[58:14] unless I had believed I would see the
[58:16] goodness of the Lord in the land of the
[58:18] living or I had almost given up my hope
[58:20] of seeing the blessings of the Lord in
[58:23] the land of the living
[58:24] he says wait on the Lord be of good
[58:28] courage and he shall strengthen thy
[58:31] heart wait I say on the Lord and and
[58:36] what is waiting in entail subjecting
[58:39] ourselves saying Lord I want to go this
[58:44] way now I want to go that way and I
[58:45] think this would be the best but I'm
[58:46] gonna wait for your direction I'm gonna
[58:49] wait freely and brother green used to
[58:50] tell us you don't pay attention s--
[58:53] twice by the third or fourth time you
[58:56] start paying attention because you know
[58:58] what happens when you don't know you
[59:01] know how that works and then Peter says
[59:03] in chapter five and six and submerge the
[59:07] six and seven humble yourselves
[59:10] therefore under the mighty hand of God
[59:12] that he may exalt you in due time humble
[59:16] yourselves be willing to say not my will
[59:19] but thy will I don't have to get my way
[59:22] in this God I'll take your way he said
[59:25] to be he says and he will exalt you
[59:28] because you want to be exact no he'll
[59:30] lift you up we get we look at that word
[59:33] and we think exalt is to be made in
[59:35] front of everybody everybody worship you
[59:36] know he will do the lifting you don't
[59:40] have to do it yourself he will do it he
[59:42] will place you in them a place you go
[59:43] and maybe the place he has you seems
[59:46] insignificant seems the least notice
[59:48] part until it's missing the little nut
[59:53] that holds that thing together where it
[59:55] does like this well it's just there but
[59:57] until it falls off and the part doesn't
[59:59] work
[1:00:00] everybody's going where's that nut
[1:00:03] he's right here sometimes but sometimes
[1:00:07] we're looking Wow that one gets a glory
[1:00:09] and I want to be that part and I want to
[1:00:10] do this but God has a part for every one
[1:00:13] of us and a place for every one of us
[1:00:14] this is casting all your care upon him
[1:00:19] for he cares for you
[1:00:22] you know we carry our cares
[1:00:25] we got a backpack we got a footlocker
[1:00:29] we've got a wheelbarrow
[1:00:32] we got a truck and trailer and we just
[1:00:35] depending how much cares who want to
[1:00:36] take with us Lord I'm going out to visit
[1:00:39] you but I'm bringing all my cares
[1:00:40] because that's what I'm comfortable in
[1:00:43] because that's what I know
[1:00:45] and God says cast your cares on me for
[1:00:49] he cared for you then Jem says it this
[1:00:52] way in for chapter 4 and 7 submit
[1:00:57] yourselves therefore to God
[1:01:00] submit say Here I am Lord I give myself
[1:01:03] resist the devil and he will flee from
[1:01:06] you
[1:01:07] it's kind of funny how will we say the
[1:01:09] old Lord I'm being I'm being bugged by
[1:01:11] the devil he won't leave me alone
[1:01:13] and he said we'll have you submitted
[1:01:15] yourself have you yielded yourself are
[1:01:18] you willing to let go the steering wheel
[1:01:19] are you willing to take your foot off
[1:01:21] the gas are you willing to let go of the
[1:01:23] reins and let God have his way now the
[1:01:27] the the when I was looking at this and
[1:01:29] this that happened on on Sunday I began
[1:01:32] to thank think of a three Hebrew
[1:01:33] children Shadrach Meshach Abednego and
[1:01:37] we know the story of them and so we'll
[1:01:40] just pick up the latter portion of it
[1:01:42] chapter 3 verses 13 to 18 and they had
[1:01:48] come they had been taken captive all
[1:01:51] right with Daniel and and they had
[1:01:54] proved themselves they had they had had
[1:01:57] eaten their own diet they were fun to be
[1:01:59] fair they were they were better
[1:02:01] scientists they were better
[1:02:03] whatever the it called for you know and
[1:02:07] even the the princes and the and the
[1:02:10] leaders of their under neck endeavors
[1:02:12] noticed it what a difference between
[1:02:14] these
[1:02:15] you know so so we know Nebuchadnezzar
[1:02:19] makes that that that Idol that statue
[1:02:22] and it's of Daniel because he was
[1:02:25] pleased by what Daniel said and if we're
[1:02:27] not careful we'll take somebody that has
[1:02:29] blessed us somebody has helped us and
[1:02:31] let me just be honest a pastor a prophet
[1:02:35] and we'll idolize him and then God will
[1:02:38] cause that person to fail so that you
[1:02:42] can take your eyes off and look to God
[1:02:44] and sometimes the disappointment
[1:02:47] overwhelms us but it's the best thing
[1:02:50] that could happen to you because then
[1:02:53] you'll turn your eyes and look upon God
[1:02:55] because he'll never fail you so here is
[1:03:00] neck then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and
[1:03:03] fury commanded to bring sanrak Shadrach
[1:03:06] Meshach Abednego and they brought these
[1:03:08] men before the King Nebuchadnezzar spake
[1:03:11] unto them and said is it true no
[1:03:14] Shadrach Meshach and Abednego do you not
[1:03:16] serve my God's nor worship the golden
[1:03:18] image which I have set up now if you be
[1:03:21] ready that at the time you hear the
[1:03:23] sound of the cornet the flute harp
[1:03:25] sackbut thus altering the dulcimer and
[1:03:27] all kinds of music you shall bow down
[1:03:30] and worship the image which I have made
[1:03:33] well but if you worship not he shall be
[1:03:36] cast the same hour into the midst of a
[1:03:38] burning fiery furnace and who is that
[1:03:42] God that shall deliver you out of my
[1:03:44] hands what a challenge
[1:03:48] what words that he uttered and had no
[1:03:51] idea what he was telling it was
[1:03:53] challenging
[1:03:54] really really you're gonna go against me
[1:03:57] and you think your God is gonna deliver
[1:03:59] you
[1:04:00] yes he's proof faithful he's never
[1:04:04] failed I know he will he keeps his word
[1:04:09] so here's their answer yeah
[1:04:13] Shadrach Meshach and Abednego answered
[1:04:16] and said to the king o Nebuchadnezzar we
[1:04:18] are not careful to answer thee in this
[1:04:21] matter we're not going to mince the word
[1:04:23] so we're not gonna go around we're not
[1:04:24] gonna try to put it sweetly to you we're
[1:04:27] just gonna say no pretty straightforward
[1:04:30] if it be so our God whom we serve is
[1:04:35] able to deliver us from this burning
[1:04:37] fiery furnace and he will deliver us out
[1:04:40] of thine hand O king and then here it is
[1:04:43] but if not he says be it known unto thee
[1:04:48] O king that we will not serve thy God's
[1:04:51] nor worship thy golden image which thou
[1:04:53] has set you've got to come to a place in
[1:04:58] your life where I said I will cast
[1:05:00] myself at the mercies of my god and also
[1:05:05] understand but if he chooses not to I
[1:05:07] will still cast myself into his hands if
[1:05:11] you'll let go and let God he might take
[1:05:15] you in a way that you didn't think was
[1:05:17] the right way this pathway looks better
[1:05:19] this way looks shorter but he has a
[1:05:21] reason and a why now sometimes we don't
[1:05:27] give our kids the why sometimes we don't
[1:05:30] even give them the reason we just tell
[1:05:32] him to do it I had my two nieces were at
[1:05:36] the house today and they were outside
[1:05:38] and I forget where we were leaving the
[1:05:43] church and and they said something about
[1:05:45] going and I said no you can't leave
[1:05:47] until you count all the rocks in the
[1:05:49] gravel of the driveway right there and
[1:05:52] they stopped she stops and give me a
[1:05:54] look now you can ask the girls how many
[1:05:56] time I did that to them when they were
[1:05:58] little dad can we go to the can we go
[1:05:59] over a bit soon so I said we need to
[1:06:01] count the gravel and the driveway to
[1:06:03] make sure we haven't lost any just about
[1:06:06] 25,000 pieces
[1:06:07] travel there and for the longest time
[1:06:10] Rachel would stop and look at me like
[1:06:12] are you serious dad
[1:06:13] she doesn't do that no more but what if
[1:06:17] God asked you to stop and count the
[1:06:20] blades of grass for a while would you be
[1:06:24] like these three and said we'll do it
[1:06:27] when you realize everything that God has
[1:06:30] for me has a purpose in a place and you
[1:06:35] would find out at the end of the
[1:06:36] accounting of the grass that he had a
[1:06:38] purpose in the place for it it might not
[1:06:40] make any sense to you but God has a
[1:06:44] reason why he does what he does and we
[1:06:47] have to stand forth so they said but if
[1:06:49] not we're still not gonna bow down we're
[1:06:52] still not gonna give it we're gonna
[1:06:54] trust in him to the end
[1:06:56] Abraham it's been 25 years Abraham he
[1:07:01] said it I still stand on it God said so
[1:07:06] and we've been talking about this for
[1:07:08] how many years since Jesus ascended I
[1:07:11] will come back to take you home it's
[1:07:14] been over 2,000 years but he's coming
[1:07:16] back and he's promised he said I will
[1:07:20] come back to take you home with me again
[1:07:23] we have to take that attitude even if
[1:07:25] not Lord you know what's best for me
[1:07:28] you know what's best for me and then
[1:07:30] let's go to mark and look at mark
[1:07:32] chapter 4 35 to 41 these are these are
[1:07:36] things we all know I don't think there's
[1:07:39] anything in the Bible that is well I
[1:07:41] didn't know that was in the Bible maybe
[1:07:43] on one Scripture but pretty well those
[1:07:47] of you that have read the Bible and have
[1:07:48] been around here but they were human
[1:07:51] they were people just like us they had
[1:07:54] the same thoughts the only thing that
[1:07:56] really they couldn't do back then is
[1:07:58] they couldn't pick up a telephone and
[1:07:59] call and and like I did today and send
[1:08:02] out the prayer requests everywhere and
[1:08:05] you know they had to word of mouth and
[1:08:06] it took time and all thank God today in
[1:08:09] five minutes the whole country could be
[1:08:11] notified and it's a blessing to have
[1:08:15] others praying for you but if there's
[1:08:17] only one God still hears that
[1:08:20] so they and they say and that same day
[1:08:23] glasses on so I can read this and the
[1:08:26] same day when the even was come he says
[1:08:28] saith unto them let us pass over unto
[1:08:31] the other side and I there's been many a
[1:08:34] sermons preached on that but still think
[1:08:36] about it
[1:08:37] God had never failed them he had never
[1:08:40] lied to them he had never done said
[1:08:43] something that it didn't happen so if
[1:08:45] they would have been listening let us
[1:08:46] pass over them to the other side they
[1:08:48] would've said let's go there would be no
[1:08:50] hey God said so we're going and when
[1:08:53] they sent away had sent away the
[1:08:55] multitude they took him even as he was
[1:08:57] in the ship and there was also with him
[1:08:59] other little ships and there arose a
[1:09:02] great storm of wind and the waves beat
[1:09:04] into the ship so that it was now full
[1:09:08] and he was in the hinder part of the
[1:09:11] ship asleep on a pillow and I always
[1:09:15] this and I'm sure you've heard it if
[1:09:18] he's laying on the pill sleeping why
[1:09:21] should we be worried because he's
[1:09:22] definitely not worried but we're looking
[1:09:26] at it and we're saying why are you
[1:09:28] sleeping in the middle of this storm
[1:09:31] that's their thought because that's how
[1:09:34] the answer him they said and he was in
[1:09:36] the hinder part of the ship asleep on a
[1:09:38] pill and they awake him they didn't come
[1:09:40] out God
[1:09:40] Jesus Jesus no I'm sure they came and
[1:09:45] tugged and pulled and get his attention
[1:09:47] now no and they said unto Him master
[1:09:52] carest thou not that we person aren't
[1:09:55] you even concerned about us you're
[1:09:57] asleep and we're about ready to drown
[1:09:59] we're about this ship's about ready to
[1:10:01] go down and he arose and he rebuked the
[1:10:06] wind and said unto the sea peace be
[1:10:08] still and the wind ceased and there was
[1:10:11] great call I don't know I could see him
[1:10:15] getting up and going come on guys again
[1:10:19] okay I'm sure that you got exasperated
[1:10:23] with him sometimes come on guys I've
[1:10:26] done this over and over what what's your
[1:10:29] fare what's your worry I've already said
[1:10:30] we're passing over to the other side
[1:10:32] and he calls the sea and he turned out
[1:10:37] of them why are you so fearful and how
[1:10:40] is it that you have no faith lord help
[1:10:45] us sometimes and they feared it
[1:10:48] exceedingly and said one to another what
[1:10:50] manner of man is this that even the wind
[1:10:54] in the sea obey Him what manner of man
[1:10:58] is this don't care what the
[1:11:01] circumstances he has control over every
[1:11:06] knee shall bow every tongue shall
[1:11:08] confess that Jesus Christ is Lord so why
[1:11:12] we really fear why are we afraid we say
[1:11:16] Lord says go you go I'll go with you
[1:11:20] I'll never leave you
[1:11:23] sometimes though well not sometimes all
[1:11:28] the time the troubles is right about
[1:11:30] here some people say how big is the
[1:11:33] problem I say I don't know at seven or
[1:11:35] eight inches maybe whatever this width
[1:11:37] is it's not a big problem
[1:11:40] it is the problem you get to reasoning
[1:11:43] thinking working there getting all
[1:11:45] concerned the scripture tells us be
[1:11:47] still it doesn't mean stop don't move
[1:11:50] it just says rest don't be anxious don't
[1:11:53] work at yourself let God be God and
[1:11:56] he'll do he'll take it at Matthew 6 and
[1:12:00] we'll read some of the verses out of
[1:12:02] chapter 6 we'll read 19 to 21 to start
[1:12:08] you can read that whole that whole
[1:12:11] chapter and he's just expressing and
[1:12:13] teaching so much through there he says
[1:12:15] lay not up for yourself treasures upon
[1:12:17] earth where moth does the rest must and
[1:12:22] moth and rust doth corrupt and where
[1:12:24] thieves break through and steal
[1:12:26] that's where our concern gets sometimes
[1:12:28] with what we have done here and what we
[1:12:31] got here and we're afraid we're going to
[1:12:33] lose it that it if God says leave it
[1:12:37] he's got something better for you simple
[1:12:40] is that because he would not give you
[1:12:43] this that's what he does
[1:12:45] remember God can take 10 cents of the
[1:12:47] dollar and do a whole lot more than you
[1:12:49] can do with 90 cents of that dollar he's
[1:12:51] proved it over and over and over he
[1:12:53] takes three fish and five loaves and
[1:12:55] feeds 12,000 with leftovers so why do we
[1:13:00] fear that he says but lay up for
[1:13:03] yourselves treasures in heaven where
[1:13:05] neither moth nor rust doth corrupt and
[1:13:08] where thieves do not break through or
[1:13:11] nor steal because where your treasure is
[1:13:15] there will your heart be also
[1:13:18] that which you treasure most that you
[1:13:21] spend time with most that you that's
[1:13:24] where your heart is that you know and
[1:13:27] and and it's okay wish if there's
[1:13:30] something we do it's okay to enjoy it
[1:13:32] something wrong with that myself sister
[1:13:35] Angela and and the sisters play the
[1:13:37] piano the Oregon and and we've talked
[1:13:39] about it there's just something it just
[1:13:40] isn't it's just so nice when the
[1:13:42] blessing that the presence of the Lord
[1:13:43] is you almost feel like you could leave
[1:13:45] the instrument alone and it would
[1:13:46] worship there's some times that probably
[1:13:48] people hearing you're saying would you
[1:13:50] leave that instrument alone give our
[1:13:52] ears a little you know they're just
[1:13:54] sometimes it doesn't work but you know
[1:13:56] you could take that and and and sister
[1:13:58] Lily will be playing the piano and and
[1:14:01] that song is in your heart and she
[1:14:02] starts playing it she's not mine reading
[1:14:05] that's the presence of the Lord just
[1:14:07] moving amongst he says where your heart
[1:14:10] is and if you can come in with that
[1:14:12] attitude my heart my desires first for
[1:14:15] you Lord and watch how things begin to
[1:14:18] change and watch how things begin to
[1:14:19] happen many times I've told sister Lily
[1:14:24] I said I didn't go to that song but the
[1:14:27] next song you played was the next song
[1:14:28] that I had in my heart to sing and we
[1:14:31] didn't sing or she started with a song
[1:14:33] that was already and I'm not saying
[1:14:37] never because every once in a while I
[1:14:38] would tell her can you play this song or
[1:14:40] we do that song but most the time it
[1:14:41] isn't it's what God puts in her heart
[1:14:44] it's what God puts in your heart you
[1:14:46] come due to a service and you have a
[1:14:48] desire in your heart you have a need in
[1:14:49] your heart and someone gets up either
[1:14:51] prays sings a song reads the scripture
[1:14:54] of the minister ministers any ministers
[1:14:56] right down to where you're at
[1:14:58] he says put your treasure there put your
[1:15:01] heart there in that and then he says in
[1:15:06] verse 25 will we just skip down to verse
[1:15:08] 25 go through 29 and he says therefore I
[1:15:12] send to you take no thought for your
[1:15:14] life what you shall eat or what you
[1:15:17] shall drink nor yet for your body what
[1:15:19] you shall put on it's not the life more
[1:15:22] than the meat in the body more than
[1:15:23] raiment then he says behold the fowls of
[1:15:26] the air for they sow not neither do they
[1:15:29] reap nor gather into barns yet your
[1:15:32] heavenly Father feedeth them are you not
[1:15:35] much better than they mama likes to feed
[1:15:39] the birds out in the back we have some
[1:15:41] feeders out there and and they come and
[1:15:44] sometimes they come up there and they
[1:15:46] come up to the feeder and they look in
[1:15:47] the window and say come on guys you're
[1:15:49] behind there's no feed in the feeder
[1:15:51] I'll tell hey they're out there chirping
[1:15:53] because you haven't ever filled it up
[1:15:55] they've gotten used to it but he said
[1:15:59] well God used me he still fed them
[1:16:01] didn't he however he's going to do it
[1:16:04] they don't come by and say here's 25
[1:16:07] bucks so you guys buy us another big bag
[1:16:08] of feed no they don't
[1:16:10] but however God's doing you know he's
[1:16:13] gonna get it done which of you by taking
[1:16:17] thought can add one cubit unto his
[1:16:19] stature and why take ye thought for
[1:16:22] raiment consider the lilies of the field
[1:16:25] how they grow they toil not neither do
[1:16:28] they spin yet I say unto you that even
[1:16:31] Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed
[1:16:34] like one of these if God can do that
[1:16:38] with the natural things how much more
[1:16:40] can he do with his spiritual how much
[1:16:43] more can he do in your life - cause the
[1:16:45] lilies to grow in your life - cause the
[1:16:48] raiment the holy arraignment in your
[1:16:50] life whatever is needed how much more he
[1:16:54] says he he'll take care of us he's never
[1:16:57] left us and will never leave us alone
[1:17:01] Philippians chapter 4 and we'll look at
[1:17:05] four verses six and seven
[1:17:11] he says be careful for nothing
[1:17:16] now don't read that wrong it doesn't say
[1:17:20] to be reckless when you take that word
[1:17:24] be careful for nothing the original
[1:17:26] translations don't be full of cares
[1:17:29] that's really but they turned around
[1:17:31] said be careful for nothing don't get so
[1:17:34] involved in the cares of life that
[1:17:35] you're full of that don't have time for
[1:17:37] the other he says be careful for nothing
[1:17:40] but in everything by prayer and
[1:17:42] supplication with Thanksgiving let your
[1:17:45] requests be made known unto God or
[1:17:48] another way to say it be careful nothing
[1:17:50] in nothing be anxious or is having no
[1:17:54] distressing anxiety about everything
[1:17:57] being full of care but in everything
[1:18:01] instead of anxiety just lay the case
[1:18:04] before God and trust him to do all
[1:18:07] things well let your requests be made
[1:18:10] known unto God and he says three
[1:18:13] elements enter the up into the appeal to
[1:18:16] God prayer which is the outpouring of
[1:18:18] the soul supplication estate the stating
[1:18:21] of our wants our desires our needs
[1:18:24] Thanksgiving we must always come to God
[1:18:27] not in a complaining spirit both a
[1:18:29] thankfulness for his present mercies
[1:18:33] Lord I'm coming and I'm sorry but I've
[1:18:36] talked to you three times and you have
[1:18:37] an answer I would never say that brother
[1:18:41] but your attitude says that when Oh Lord
[1:18:45] how long when are you gonna do this I've
[1:18:46] asked you over and over when you you
[1:18:48] bless my neighbor but you haven't
[1:18:49] blessed me at where are you lord I never
[1:18:52] say that our actions speak that way at
[1:18:55] times we forget to be grateful and
[1:18:57] thankful in our prayer in our
[1:18:58] supplication and then he says and the
[1:19:03] peace of God which passes all
[1:19:05] understanding shall keep your hearts and
[1:19:07] minds through Christ Jesus and the peace
[1:19:11] of God the calm heavenly repose that
[1:19:15] tranquility of Spirit which God only can
[1:19:18] give which surpasses all understanding
[1:19:22] which none can comprehend save he that
[1:19:24] receiveth him sometimes you can't
[1:19:26] explain it but you know it you cut it
[1:19:28] how can you be so at peace about it I
[1:19:31] can't say well you do this this this and
[1:19:34] this and this and that'll equal peace I
[1:19:36] just say it's God in my life he's the
[1:19:40] one that does it I can't explain it to
[1:19:42] you but I know it shall keep shall guard
[1:19:46] as a garrison does a city your hearts
[1:19:49] your affections your minds your
[1:19:51] understandings and all the various
[1:19:54] workings of them through the spirit and
[1:19:56] power of Christ Jesus in the knowledge
[1:19:58] and the love of God without our guard
[1:20:01] set on them likewise the purity and the
[1:20:03] vigor vigor of our affections cannot
[1:20:06] long be preserved as much as we desire
[1:20:09] we want to keep ourselves pure before
[1:20:12] God we cannot do ourselves all have
[1:20:17] sinned and come short of Allah Laurie
[1:20:18] God not anything I could present to him
[1:20:22] is of any value of myself
[1:20:25] nothing good we try we do our best but
[1:20:30] if that's what we're presenting to him
[1:20:31] were no different than Cain who came up
[1:20:34] and said I got all my fruits and I laid
[1:20:36] them before you but we come like Abel
[1:20:39] and said I'm nothing but I know that it
[1:20:42] took the life of an innocent one and I
[1:20:44] present that to you and that's what he
[1:20:48] says so you're accepting my death for
[1:20:51] you on Calvary you're accepting the
[1:20:52] shedding of my blood you're accepting
[1:20:54] the work that I did it yes then you're
[1:20:57] accepted you're accepted in the beloved
[1:21:00] because he was at first born of God he
[1:21:03] was the accepted one he says again
[1:21:07] without a guard set on these the purity
[1:21:11] and the vigor of our affections cannot
[1:21:13] long be preserved set in your hearts and
[1:21:19] another way he said and the peace of God
[1:21:23] that peace that comes by putting all in
[1:21:26] the hands of the one who is able and
[1:21:28] willing to deliver which it passes
[1:21:31] beyond all understanding whenever we
[1:21:33] fully trust the Lord there comes a peace
[1:21:35] that is
[1:21:36] understanding of those who have never
[1:21:38] experienced it they shall keep your
[1:21:41] hearts and minds through Christ Jesus
[1:21:42] the peace will be a guard which will
[1:21:45] keep the heart and thoughts holy and
[1:21:47] pure when there's a sweetness when
[1:21:50] there's a purity when there's a why
[1:21:52] would you want to offend it why would
[1:21:53] you want to break it now Lord when when
[1:21:57] it's like this I never want to come out
[1:21:59] of this atmosphere because the other
[1:22:01] atmosphere is no fun the other
[1:22:04] atmosphere is a challenge the other
[1:22:06] atmosphere is hard but I want the peace
[1:22:09] of God that passes understanding maybe I
[1:22:13] can't even put it in words but let my
[1:22:16] life that is the conversation that
[1:22:21] people need hear and see the very life
[1:22:23] of it then a couple more quotes hearing
[1:22:27] I believe and I skipped these but they
[1:22:35] would be the first ones or the Jeremy
[1:22:37] from cruelty of sin and the penalty that
[1:22:40] it cost to read sin from our lives what
[1:22:44] a title the cruelty of sin what it does
[1:22:48] the picture of the Marlboro Man fur for
[1:22:53] some of you who hadn't seen that picture
[1:22:55] you're too young because they took it
[1:22:56] away but some of us remember driving
[1:22:59] down the highway and there's that big
[1:23:00] billboard with the Marlboro Man a cowboy
[1:23:03] dressed in the boots and smoking
[1:23:05] tomorrow and just looking like all of a
[1:23:07] man and that's how they presented it but
[1:23:11] the cruelty of sin look at his picture
[1:23:13] at the end of life what it really did to
[1:23:16] him brother Brahim says throw your arms
[1:23:19] around the Rock of Ages cleft for me let
[1:23:22] me hide myself in thee while the near
[1:23:26] old waters roll while the tempest still
[1:23:28] is high hide me o my Savior hide me let
[1:23:32] the world do whatever they want to let
[1:23:34] the theologians do whatever they want to
[1:23:36] I don't want theology what I want is
[1:23:39] Jesus Christ in my heart I want to
[1:23:43] understand you Lord I want to be able to
[1:23:45] explain you I want to know every
[1:23:47] definition about you Lord
[1:23:49] so I need to go to this study and I need
[1:23:51] to go to this revelation and I need to
[1:23:53] go no I just want to know him to know
[1:23:57] him is to love him why people are toss
[1:24:00] so tossed about I seen that old ship
[1:24:03] setting there rocking back and forth and
[1:24:05] some waves that would go in and some
[1:24:08] waters that would go under and
[1:24:09] everything and I said wonder why that is
[1:24:11] and the fellow sitting said it's not a
[1:24:14] it's got a sea anchor on it therefore
[1:24:16] the ship can't sink and I said it can go
[1:24:19] through the wave but it can't sink as
[1:24:21] its anchored and I said oh praise be to
[1:24:23] God we got an anchor some ways we can go
[1:24:26] over some week go under but regardless
[1:24:30] if the anchor holds it isn't the ship
[1:24:32] doing the holding he said it's the
[1:24:35] anchor doing the holding it isn't what I
[1:24:37] am or what I will be or what I was it's
[1:24:40] what he is now and what he did for me
[1:24:42] and you it ain't what I can do but what
[1:24:45] he has done my anchor holds and grips
[1:24:49] that solid rock brother branham said
[1:24:52] behind the veil and joseph meeting his
[1:24:56] brethren
[1:24:59] did we I don't know that we read that
[1:25:01] one did we
[1:25:02] I believe we started with that one
[1:25:05] didn't we who has seen the other side of
[1:25:07] the storm so if you're sick just anchor
[1:25:10] your soul into Haven arrest so if you're
[1:25:13] perplexed and distress remember he said
[1:25:15] I'll be with you always even to the end
[1:25:17] of the world if he said it he keeps his
[1:25:19] word and he said all things work
[1:25:21] together for good for good to them that
[1:25:24] love the Lord Romans 8 so just stay
[1:25:27] right there one man wrote a poet wrote
[1:25:29] my anchor holds within the veil what is
[1:25:31] available it's something that shuts off
[1:25:34] from off here from there and the anchor
[1:25:37] is on the inside of the veil you don't
[1:25:40] see how it's going to be but you know
[1:25:42] what there's something that's got a hold
[1:25:44] of you this got to hold up it's got to
[1:25:46] hold up there again it's within the veil
[1:25:51] knowing what's behind that veil when
[1:25:55] when that that the priest the high
[1:25:57] priest went in behind the veil and the
[1:26:01] offering had been done the sacrifice
[1:26:03] the people on the outside that knew what
[1:26:05] was taking the place we're rejoicing
[1:26:07] they were happy because they knew that
[1:26:09] for another year their sins were not
[1:26:12] held against them they were forgiven so
[1:26:17] when you know what's going on behind the
[1:26:18] veil there's a shed blood there's a life
[1:26:21] of God you're a happy person but you
[1:26:24] know what you can go behind the veil
[1:26:26] today it's open in fact you need to go
[1:26:30] behind the veil to meet him the anchor
[1:26:33] holds and grips a solid rock it never
[1:26:36] fails CSIS
[1:26:37] on the other side of the storm sometimes
[1:26:39] a storm it's tough it's hard it's it's
[1:26:43] it's I don't know if you ever do and I
[1:26:46] don't know why I do this sometimes but
[1:26:47] I'll my wife will say why are you
[1:26:50] watching that and I'll watch replays of
[1:26:53] the tsunamis yeah I don't know why
[1:26:57] sometimes either but I'll watch what
[1:26:59] happened to people and I'll see the part
[1:27:01] I'll watch videos of large waves that
[1:27:04] ships are going through it usually
[1:27:08] happens at night when it's dark outside
[1:27:12] but I look at him when I say but the
[1:27:14] ship is made to go through that storm
[1:27:16] it's made to do that we weren't made to
[1:27:20] be overtaken by a tsunami but we were
[1:27:22] made to go through the storms of life
[1:27:24] and and you see some of things
[1:27:26] landslides and everything fire forest
[1:27:29] fires and all and you know just watching
[1:27:31] the destruction at all what I said but
[1:27:33] there's a God who cares
[1:27:35] there's a God who watches over us
[1:27:37] there's a God who never fails who keeps
[1:27:40] his words sometimes we get caught up in
[1:27:44] the emotions of life and the cares of
[1:27:46] life in in all that we're seen all
[1:27:49] around us in God says cast your burdens
[1:27:54] give of them willingly but Lord if I
[1:27:58] don't keep my hand on it a little bit I
[1:28:01] feel like it's out of control I feel
[1:28:03] like if my hands not a little bit on
[1:28:05] this channel you remember brother
[1:28:08] Greene's testimony when he was coming
[1:28:10] down from Flagstaff and that voice spoke
[1:28:13] to him and said if you really trust me
[1:28:15] take your hands off the steering wheel
[1:28:18] and they said that car came down the
[1:28:21] highway from Flagstaff he took his hands
[1:28:25] off the steering wheel and his hands off
[1:28:26] the gas pedal and the car came down went
[1:28:29] around people and did everything God was
[1:28:31] showing him I can drive this car a whole
[1:28:33] lot better than you can but we won't
[1:28:38] hold onto it wait the the passenger
[1:28:41] sometimes is having a harder time than
[1:28:42] the driver you know the the ones that
[1:28:49] take the student drivers out I don't
[1:28:51] know how they do it now don't go don't
[1:28:56] go ask my wife cuz she uh she did most
[1:28:58] of the training one day we were I think
[1:29:02] it was Elizabeth that I was I had taken
[1:29:04] her out to drive because she was going
[1:29:06] to go to college and he learned to drive
[1:29:09] and she's making a turn and she's not
[1:29:13] turning very hard and she's going right
[1:29:14] at a telephone pole and I just said you
[1:29:18] better finish that Turner you're gonna
[1:29:20] hit the pole and she finished the turn
[1:29:23] and we didn't hit the pole and then she
[1:29:24] turned around she goes had that been
[1:29:26] mother she would have been screaming her
[1:29:29] head off I said yeah but I don't scream
[1:29:33] like your mother I said the inside was
[1:29:35] screaming
[1:29:37] I'm glad the one that watches over us
[1:29:40] has seen the end already and knows
[1:29:42] exactly what's going to happen he's got
[1:29:45] it in control caster cares even when
[1:29:48] you're looking at the storm and you're
[1:29:50] looking at the raging river he's got a
[1:29:52] net to catch you he's got a net to
[1:29:55] protect you give yourself over willingly
[1:29:57] to him then you're gonna say I should
[1:30:00] have done this a long time ago
[1:30:05] Lord we we thank you that it doesn't
[1:30:10] depend on our own abilities and our own
[1:30:13] mind to figure all this out into to get
[1:30:17] all the equations and make sure they
[1:30:18] come out
[1:30:20] the end result is exactly as we think it
[1:30:23] should be more but you set laws in
[1:30:26] motion you set these things and they
[1:30:28] haven't failed you said Israel as long
[1:30:31] as the Sun rises in the sets in the
[1:30:34] evening my mercies will watch over you
[1:30:37] you gave us all these promises Lord and
[1:30:40] they've never failed they never come
[1:30:42] short father and we can we can hang our
[1:30:46] eternal destination on budget what your
[1:30:48] words are help us even in our fears in
[1:30:53] our hard times when we're wondering what
[1:30:56] will be the resultant to cast our cares
[1:30:58] on you to be willing to like the three
[1:31:01] Hebrew children and say I will cast
[1:31:02] myself into that furnace knowing my God
[1:31:05] will deliver me but even if he chooses
[1:31:08] not to deliver me I will still cast
[1:31:10] myself into that Lord let us be willing
[1:31:14] even when we're looking at the storm the
[1:31:16] raging river and we realize Lord that
[1:31:20] you've put a a safety net there you have
[1:31:23] a way to catch us and watch over us hard
[1:31:26] help us to surrender our wheel our
[1:31:28] thoughts our being in a way father that
[1:31:32] you could have preeminence and then let
[1:31:35] the peace of God that passes all
[1:31:37] understanding even our own understanding
[1:31:40] sometimes we couldn't explain it would
[1:31:43] be like that little spring that brother
[1:31:45] Branham walked up to and he he's talking
[1:31:48] to and he said if it could answer me and
[1:31:49] I would tell it asking why are you so
[1:31:52] happy why are you bubbling up is it
[1:31:54] because the birds come by and drink of
[1:31:56] you and the animals me and he says no if
[1:31:59] a good answer it's just that it's within
[1:32:00] me and it's coming out Lord let that
[1:32:03] peace of God be that way in our lives
[1:32:05] Lord may we all to it we ask in Jesus
[1:32:08] Christ me
[1:32:10] amen sometimes it's hard but he doesn't
[1:32:15] fail and I thank God for my brothers and
[1:32:18] my sisters who are here to encourage one
[1:32:20] another to help one another to carry the
[1:32:23] burden you know it may weigh a hundred
[1:32:25] pounds and you carry it by yourself

[1:32:30] somebody else and then the load is
[1:32:32] lighten it's half and it breaks down and
[1:32:35] thank God for one another has we help
[1:32:37] one another so let go and let God let go
[1:32:45] and let God had his wonder
