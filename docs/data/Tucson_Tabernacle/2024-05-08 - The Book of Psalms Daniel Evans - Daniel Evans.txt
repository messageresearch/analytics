things he has done great things he has done great things bless His Ho you may be seated sister Martha has something prepared all right there was a heart back there and I didn't just kind of wondering and and sister Martha so I'm not super proficient but I figured this is Psalms he played the harp so it kind of fit and also this is one of the Psalms that is probably one that we're fairly mostly familiar with because it's this Psalm 51 where he is after Nathan the prophet has dealt with him um with his out with his dealings with Bas Sheba and him falling on his face before the Lord and I love reading the Psalms when I'm especially just low because because sometimes or you know let's be honest sometimes when we're upset too because we're like yes David go get him avenge me of my enemies um but when we're feeling down and when we're feeling low um like reading the Psalms and reading David's cries and just there's no other way that it could have been worded where it was better and so um this was just a song that was simple enough for me to play but it still is a song that um means a lot in times where I just feel like I'm crying out to God pray for me [Music] create in me a clean heart oh God and renew a right Spirit within [Music] me create in me a clean heart oh oh God and renew a right Spirit Within Me cast me not away from thy presence oh Lord take not thy Holy Spirit from me [Music] restore onto me the joy of th [Music] salvation and renew a right Spirit within me create in me a clean heart oh God and renew a right Spirit within me create in me a clean heart oh God and renew a right Spirit Within Me cast me not away from thy presence oh Lord take not thyo Spirit from me restore onto me the joy of thy salvation and renew a right Spirit Within Me and renew a right Spirit Within [Music] [Applause] Me amen cast me not away from thy presence oh Lord and renew a right Spirit In Me create in me a clean heart break it open let be be willing to say yet expose me Lord for what I need amen sometimes Hallelujah you know when you read through psalms for David sometimes it was Allelujah and sometimes it was Oh Me Oh My sometimes Hallelujah [Music] sometimes praise the Lord sometimes gently [Music] sing our hearts in [Music] one sometimes [Music] Hallelujah sometimes praise the Lord sometimes gently singing our hearts in one Accord one more time sometimes Hallelujah sometimes praise the Lord sometimes gently sing hearts in one so sometimes Allelujah and sometimes Lord I need you right now I need you Lord I need you Lord right now I need you Lord I need you right

still know you are God I will be still know [Music] you heavenly father if we could just be still and know that you are God lord as we open up this book of Psalms tonight know that it is written truly by people that that did know you Lord if we could have just a taste of what they had Grant it Lord and I pray that your anointing would be here tonight the wisdom would come forward an explanation and an understanding in Jesus name we pray amen amen you can be seated beautiful song sister Martha I felt really like I felt the presence of the Holy Spirit as you were singing that that song and playing on the harp that was so beautiful did remind me of David there and you can see how King Saul and all of his rage would be calmed at something like that just it's just beautiful and I did I felt like just felt the presence of the Lord as she was singing and it create in me a clean heart renew a right Spirit Within Me This Book of Psalms is uh it's a powerful and it's a it's a wonderful book it's a book of 150 different poems and songs and prayers that came from all different times in history it was put together after Israel after their exile to Babylon by who we don't know who put it together um but it's probably the most read book and most quoted book in all the Bible so the words that we are reading tonight have probably been read more than any other words in the history of of mankind sister Lily it's good to have you back God bless you welcome home um it's this book of Psalms it's it's the second in what is described as the poetical books we've gone through the first 17 books of the Bible we started in Genesis we got all the way through Nehemiah and Esther those are considered the historic books not that we think of them as just history of course we know that they're the word of God but they they tell a whole lot of history of the world from the very beginning all the way to after the Captivity then it moves then the Bible moves into this other set of books so those all go together and that's how you can have books that uh they don't seem like they're in order but the Bible is compiled in different sections as I said those first 17 are the historic books and now we are getting in to What's called the poetical books they start with the Book of Job then they go through psalms and um Proverbs all the way down to Song of Solomon and some so there's five books there and some also put in the Lamentations of Jeremiah into those books they um they're called the well these poetical books as I said they're not written like the historic books you can just open up the book of Psalms as sister Martha sang or or brother Josiah sang or brother Aaron sang you can open it up and you don't need a background you don't really need to know what's going on you can just open up that book and you can start reading and you can be right in there well that's hard to do with any other books in the Bible so these these poetical books they're they're meant to they're not meant to give us a history they're and they're not meant to place us in a period of time and neither and it doesn't really matter when they're written they teach us a Les lesson and a wisdom that is timeless they're considered poetry and songs because they're written in a certain form and they're written with a Hebrew Cadence in that form they might tell a certain thing that's happened but the main objective of the author is praise and worship and to teach a lesson and not to tell a story as I said it's written in what's called Hebrew po poetry and it's not poetry like like we would understand it's called it's written in Hebrew songs and they're not songs like we would think it's it's not it doesn't have a rhyme To The Rhythm like we're used to it's that's not the way they wrote their worship they they use thoughts and ideas like we use words that sound similar they use thoughts and ideas and those thoughts and ideas they would compare and contrast those in a certain statement and that produces the rhythm of the song or the rhythm of the poem one one thought will support another thought or it will contrast another thought and it'll be a little bit more this will be a little bit more evident when we get into Proverbs in fact let's let's read out of Proverbs quickly and I I'll show you how that goes let's go to Proverbs uh really it's it's you can do any of them how about proverbs 17 um yeah Proverbs 1710 is a good one now watch watch the back and forth and I'll just read it off the screen here a reproof entereth more into a wise man than aund Stripes into a fool back and forth verse 11 an evil man seeketh only Rebellion therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him let a bear robbed of her welps meet a man rather than a fool in his folly who so WTH evil for good evil shall not depart from his house do you see the back and forth and the Cadence that that's in these poetical books the Western Way would be to for a song it would be like Jesus loves me this I know for the Bible tells me so little ones to him belong they are weak but he is strong that's that's the way we are used to singing and we are used to poetry but but instead of rhyming its thoughts comparing and contrasting different statements I'd like to show brother Jordan I gave you a two pictures of the English Standard Version and the King James version of a of a Psalm maybe go to the second one I gave you um and when you look at these Psalms when you're reading them this is a Bible this is our Bible Lesson so this is um I'm going to teach you a little bit more about the Bible here we have the King James version doesn't make an effort to preserve that back and forth Cadence of um the the Psalms and the Proverbs and the poetical books most other translations do and you can see here Psalm 24 if you look on the left side it says lift up your head heads oh Gates and and then there's a pause and be ye lifted up o ancient doors that the king of glory may come in who is the king of glory the lord strong and mighty the Lord Mighty in battle see that on the on the left side there it's broken up while the King James version will just take the um the number and it will just write it out with the punctuation most other translations will go to a next line and it's telling you that's where you pause and that's where the original um pause was in the poem um and then thank you brother Jordan I just wanted to show the difference so if you're reading another translation other than King James you might see some indentation in that type of thing and it's meant for the reader to repeat the psalm like that the um you'll come across words like ca in the Book of Psalms and that's like a hard stop it's getting you to stop for a minute I I'll cover that in a little while this book of Psalms it covers about a thousand years Jesus quoted the Psalms 11 times and that's more than any other Old Testament book it's more than any other book that Jesus quoted there are at least 17 Messianic psalms about the future Messiah his birth his life his death and his resurrection and so what's neat is this means that Through the Ages the Jews were singing about Jesus even they didn't know it wow there um there are five books in the Psalms and this is one of those things that you probably didn't know if you turn I want everybody you're going to have to use your Bibles today because brother Jordan's not going to be able to show you this but if you go to the Book of Psalms and you go to the very first chapter chapter you'll see that it says book one yeah there's five books within the book of Psalms and each one of those is has certain characteristics book one Psalms 1- 41 there's songs about relationship and there songs about communion between God and man now it's a general theme of the first book of Psalms which is as I said Psalm 1-41 and most scholars believe that each of these five books each of these five books within Psalms they correspond to other books that are in the Bible so if you look at book one and it's about a relationship with with God and it's it's about communion between God and man can you think of the the book in the Bible before this that was just the best communion that we see in all of the Bible between God and man which one would you think how about in the Garden of Eden Genesis so we look at book one it corresponds and has the same feeling as Genesis then we go to book two over to um Psalm 42 starts book two and it speaks about Deliverance by God and about bringing people out of bondage what book of the Bible do you think that one would correlate to Exodus then in book three it talks about the sanctuary of God and and it talks about the the temple and and the worship so what do you think book three would be about Leviticus you're singing a a pattern here now book four talks about rebellion against God that's Psalm 90 through 106 similar to The Book of Numbers and then book five renewal with God which closes out the Torah in Deuteronomy so the first five books of Psalms the only five book books of Psalms correlate very closely with Genesis Exodus Leviticus Numbers and Deuteronomy each book ends with a blessing or an amen so in book one Psalm one all the way through some people don't put Psalm 1 and two in uh into book one uh most people do some but uh book one ends in Psalm 41 and it ends in 13 and it says this Psalm 41:13 blessed be the Lord God of Israel from Everlasting and to Everlasting amen and amen closed book one then we go to book two and it ends in Psalm 72 and it ends Psalm 72:19 says and blessed be his glorious name forever and let the whole earth be filled with his glory amen and amen the prayers of David the son of jessier ended then book three it ends Psalm 89 verse 52 blessed be the Lord forever more amen and amen some of these get two amens book four Psalm 106 verse 47 save us oh Lord Our God and gather us from among the Heathen to give thanks unto thy holy name and to Triumph in thy praise blessed be the Lord God of Israel from Everlasting to Everlasting and let all the people say amen praise ye the Lord so that one gets both then book five and I'll just read the entire last book last Psalm in the last book of Psalm Psalm 150 it says praise ye the Lord praise God in his Sanctuary Praise Him in the firmament of his power praise him for his mighty acts Praise Him according to his excellent greatness praise him with the sound of the trumpet praise him with the Sultry and harp praise him with the tempal and dance praise him with stringed instruments and organs Praise Him upon the loud symbols Praise Him upon the high sounding symbols let everything that hath breath praise the Lord praise the Lord that is the that is the spirit of the book of Psalms beautiful the Psalms were Prayed by people who understood that God was the center not their feelings not their situations not their frustrations but they knew God himself and they knew he was the deliverer they knew that he was worthy of Praise Jesus taught in the Lord's Prayer he taught us what to say and he taught us how to pray but the Psalms they teach us the spirit that we should pray in perfectly in order with the New Testament and these Psalms really get the people just down on their knees and praying just like that song that sister Martha sang was just was just so sweet and that's the presence of the Holy Spirit as you are praying in these Psalms just reading them really brings the spirit Psalm 30 says this I will extol thee Oh Lord for thou Hast Lifted Me Up and Hast not made my foes to Rejoice over me oh Lord my God I Cried unto thee and thou Hast healed me oh Lord thou Hast brought up my soul from the grave thou has kept me alive that I should not go down into the pit sing unto the Lord all ye Saints of his and give thanks at the remembrance of his Holiness for his anger and Earth for a moment but for a moment in his favor is life weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning and in my Prosperity I said I shall never be moved Lord by thy favor thou Hast made my Mountain to stand strong thou didst hide thy face and I was troubled I cried to thee Oh Lord and unto the Lord I made supplication what profit is there in my blood when I go down to the pit shall the dust praise thee shall it declare thy truth here oh Lord and have mercy upon me Lord be thou my helper thou Hast turned from me my mourning into dancing and thou has put off my sackcloth and girded me with GL with gladness to the end that my glory may sing praise to thee and not be silent oh Lord my my God I will give Thee I will give thanks unto thee forever that's worship beautiful the Psalms were composed as I said over a period of approximately a thousand years so it wasn't just one author that we have in the Psalms can anyone tell me who one of the authors in the Psalms were David very good David wrote 73 Psalms give me another one ASAP Asaf do you know who Asaf was he was David's worship leader Asaf wrote 12 of the Psalms the sons of Kora Levites wrote 12 Solomon the son of David he wrote too he got in there too Psalm 72 and Psalm 12 27 let's see let's let's uh let's read Psalm 127 this is King Solomon writing this except the Lord build thee a house they labor in vain that build it except the Lord keep the city The Watchman waketh but in vain it is vain for you to rise up early to sit up late to eat the bread of Sorrows for so he giveth his beloved sleep so quit staying up late on your phones did I say that out loud quit staying up too late let me read that read that again so I can get my words out of there it is vain for you to rise up early and to sit up late to eat the bread of Sorrows for so he giveth his beloved sleep Lo children are a Heritage of the Lord and the fruit of the womb is his reward as arrows are in the hand and of a mighty man so are children of the youth happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them they shall not be ashamed but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate words from King Solomon another man named heon wrote one of the Psalms and another man named Ethan wrote one of the Psalms can somebody tell me another author of one Psalm Moses Moses wrote one of the Psalms that's right at the start of the beginning of book number four in the psalm so let's read it Psalm number 90 this is the prophet Moses speaking and writing his song Lord thou Hast been our Dwelling Place in all generations before the mountains were brought forth orever thou had formed the earth and the world even from Everlasting to Everlasting Thou Art God thou turnest man to destruction and saith return ye Children of Men for a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is passed and as a watch in the night thou carest them away as with a flood they are as asleep in the morning they are like grass which which groweth up in the morning it flourisheth and groweth up in the evening it is cut down and withereth for we are consumed by thine anger and by thy wrath we are troubled for thou has set our iniquities before thee our secret sins in the light of thy countenance for all our days are passed away in thy wrath we spend our years as a tale that is told the days of our years are three score years and 10 and if by any reason of strength they be four score Years yet is their strength labor and sorrow for for it is soon cut off and we fly away who knoweth the power of thine anger even according to thy fear so is thy wrath so teach us to number our days that we may apply our hearts un wisdom return oh Lord how long and let it repent thee concerning thy servants oh satisfy us early with thy mercy that we may rejoice and be glad all our days make us glad according to the days wherein thou has Afflicted Us in the Years wherein we have seen evil let thy Work appear under thy servants and thy Glory unto their children and let the beauty of of the Lord of Lord Our God be upon us and establish thou the work of our hands upon us yay the work of our hands establish thou it written by the prophet Moses 48 the remaining 48 of the Psalms are Anonymous but two of those Anonymous Psalms were written by David do you believe [Laughter] me so there they were Anonymous but they were written by David how do you know brother Daniel um brother Jordan if you would put up Psalm 957 and just leave it up there Psalm 957 says this this is one of those Anonymous Psalms for he is our God and we are the people of his pasture the Sheep of his hand today if you will hear his voice Harden not your heart as in the provocation as in the day of Temptation in the wilderness a psalm by an anonymous writer leave it up there brother Jordan leave that right there Hebrews 4:7 says this again he limith a certain day saying in David today after so long a time as it is said today if you will hear his voice Harden not your hearts wow that's good got another one Psalm two brother Jordan verse one it says this why do the Heathen rage and the people imagine a vain thing Anonymous Psalm leave it up there brother Jordan acts 4: 25 who by the mouth of thy servant David hath said why did the Heathen rage and the people imagine vain things so we can put David's name on that the um the book the book you'll see that at the top it will say a Psalm of Asaf or a Psalm of David that is considered inspired words that's considered part of the Bible the other the the scoffield notes or whatever notes that you have in your Bible is is of course that's someone's take on this but these original Scrolls actually had that on there that this is who wrote this as for Words the book of Psalm is the third longest book of the Bible all right guess what's the first Jeremiah you're awesome Jeremiah was the first all right second you're close Isaiah is I think five four or five five I think genis Genesis Genesis second longest book in the Bible Psalms as far as word Psalms the thir the fourth is Ezekiel Psalms has more verses than any other book in the Bible it has the longest chapter in the entire book of the Bible what is it brother Aaron J Daniel got it Psalm 119 has 172 verses is it and it has the shortest chapter in all the Bible Psalm 117 two verses Jesus as I said used to quote from the book of Psalms often more than any other Old Testament book book nearly half of all the direct quotes taken from the Old Testament and quoted in the New Testament are from the Psalms The Book of Psalms is either quoted from or alluded to about a hundred times in the Book of Revelation and 149 times in the gospels about that many John Chapter 2 the Lord Jesus he fulfilled numerous Psalms but let's read this one brother Jordan if you would put on Psalm on the screen Psalm 6 699 and I'm going to read from John 2:1 15 but Jordan brother um 699 there we go John 2:15 says this and when he had made a scourge of small cords this is when Jesus came into Jerusalem and he all of the money changers there and and he it upset him and he tied the cords together and when he had made a scourge of small cords he drove them out of the temple and the sheep and The Oxen and poured out the charges of money and overthrew the tables and said unto them that sold the doves take these things hence make not my father's house a house of merchandise and his disciples remembered that it was written the Zeal of thine house hath eaten me up that's amazing that they could put those two scriptures together Psalm 699 says this for the Zeal of thine house hath eaten me up and the reproaches of them that reproach thee are Fallen upon me brother Jordan if you could put up Psalm 315 Luke 40 chapter 23: 46 says this and when Jesus had cried with a loud voice he said father into thy hands I commend my spirit and having thus said he gave up the ghost crucifixion Psalm 315 into thine hand I commit my spirit thou Hast redeemed me oh Lord God of Truth wow the word CA appears 71 times in the Psalms throughout the Psalms and it's often interpreted as an instruction calling for a break in the singing or the the of the reciting of the psalm or to pause and to calmly think about what you have just read so when you read that word the author is saying stop digest what you just read let it sink in take a rest a minute meditate on this song that you just sang or this poem that you just read Psalm 24 verse 20 verse 7 says this I'm sorry brother Jordan let's go to Psalm 241 says this the Earth is the Lords and the fullness thereof the world and they that dwell therein for he hath founded it upon the Seas and established it upon the floods who shall Ascend into the hill of the Lord or who shall stand in his holy place he that hath Clean Hands and a pure heart who hath not lifted up his soul un vanity nor sworn deceitfully he shall receive the blessing from the Lord and righteousness from the Lord of his salvation this is the generation of them that seek him that seek thy face oh Jacob seea lift up your head heads oh ye gates and be ye lift up ye Everlasting doors and the king of glory shall come in who is this king of glory the lord strong and mighty the Lord Mighty in battle lift up your heads oh ye gates even lift them up ye Everlasting doors and the king of glory shall come in who is the king of glory the lord of hosts he is king of glory Sila that's something that we can pause and think about the Lord of glory the lord Jesus walking into the Heavenly City walking into the heavens and all the Praises coming coming forth he's saying pause think about that that amen Psalm Psalm 119 is one of Psalm 119 is about the word and it constantly it's lifting up the word and it's it's presenting the word to the people I believe it says that Thy word is a lamp into my feet and it is the longest in the Bible and I believe it's the longest because it is all about the word of God and how fitting that that book takes precedence among all of the Bible as being the very longest chapter and and it's the chapters in The Bible most of you know that most of these books in this Bible were written just as one big long scroll and then later on numbers were put in there so we can look it up so there wasn't a St John 1 or St John 17 St John 14:12 when they wrote it it was all just the Gospel of John from beginning to end but it wasn't like this in the Book of Psalms there were actually separated books in there I want to read a little bit of out of Psalm [Music] 119 and then I would like Sister Sarah to come up and sing that song that you sang the other day it was just so beautiful on on the Psalms I believe it was like brother Josiah had saying it was It was a a couple different Psalms that you put together and uh then we will um we worship with another Psalm or two and singing Psalm 119 says this Thou Art um Psalm 119 verse 557 brother Jordan I won't read the whole thing Thou Art my portion oh Lord I have said that I would keep thy words I was reading this the other day as I was starting to prepare for this lesson and I really felt the presence of the Lord and I really felt condemned as I was reading this Psalm saying of the lord lord I I am a lowly person and I fall so short as I was reading these words I I was thinking that Lord this is what I want to be this is what I want to live up to Thou Art my portion oh Lord I have said that I would keep thy words I entreated thy favor with my whole heart be merciful un unto me according to thy will word I thought on my ways and turned my feet unto thy testimonies I made haste and delayed not to keep thy Commandments the bands of the wicked have robbed me but I have not forgotten thy law at midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee because of thy righteous judgments that's where I stopped as I was reading this and I said Lord I've done that before but how rare is it for me to wake up in the middle of the night just because just because there's there was a time from the time that I I prayed before I went to sleep and the time that I prayed when I woke up in the morning that was too long of a time for me to separate myself from you Lord at midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee because of thy righteousness I am a companion of all them that fear thee and of them that keep thy precepts the earth oh Lord is full of thy mercy teach me thy statutes thou Hast dealt well with thy servant oh Lord according unto Thy word teach me good judgment and knowledge for I have believed thy Commandments before I was afflicted I want to stray but now I have kept Thy word thou art good and

the Lord is perfect converting the soul and testimony of the Lord is sure making wise the simple the statutes of the Lord are are right rejoicing the heart the Commandment of the Lord is pure enlightening the eyes the fear of the Lord is clean enduring forever the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether more to be Des desired are they than gold yay than much fine gold
