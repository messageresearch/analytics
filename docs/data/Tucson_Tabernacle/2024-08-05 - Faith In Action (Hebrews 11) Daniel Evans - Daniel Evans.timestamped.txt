[28:32] following it and that thing was dive
[28:33] bombing it and that eagle just kept on
[28:35] flying just ignored it just ignored the
[28:39] the little demon that kept on after him
[28:41] and after him and after him and then
[28:42] after a while he kept on and that Crow
[28:45] came to dive bomb him and he turned over
[28:48] on his back in mid-flight and stuck out
[28:51] those Claws and that Crow pulled away
[28:54] and he flew away and Eagle turned around
[28:57] and started flying along they're so
[28:59] beautiful let's let's turn in our

[29:28] for the time would fail me to tell of
[29:30] Gideon and of baric and of Samson and of
[29:33] jeepa and David also and Samuel and of
[29:36] the prophets who through faith subdue
[29:39] kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained
[29:42] promises stopped the mouth of lions
[29:45] quenched the violence of fire escaped
[29:48] the edge of the sword out of weakness
[29:50] were made strong wax Valiant in fight
[29:53] turned to flight the armies of the
[29:57] aliens women received their dead raised
[29:59] from life again to life again and others
[30:02] were tortured not accepting Deliverance
[30:05] that they might obtain a better
[30:06] resurrection and others had trial of
[30:09] crew mockings and scourgings yay
[30:12] moreover of bonds and imprisonment they
[30:14] were stoned they were saw aunder they
[30:17] were tempted were slain with a sword
[30:20] they wandered about in sheep skins and
[30:22] goat skins being destitute Afflicted
[30:24] tormented of whom the world was not
[30:27] worth worth y they wandered in deserts
[30:30] and in mountains and in dens and caves
[30:33] of the earth and these all having
[30:35] obtained a good report through faith
[30:37] receive not the promise God having
[30:39] provided some better thing for us that
[30:43] they without us should not be made
[30:47] perfect wherefore seeing we also are
[30:50] compassed about with so great a cloud of
[30:53] witness let us lay aside every weight in
[30:56] the Sin which do easily beset us and and
[30:59] let us run the race let us run with

[34:59] music is so important brothers and
[35:02] sisters it's all throughout the Bible
[35:04] and we all love we love to worship and
[35:06] good music really um sets a good
[35:10] atmosphere for worship I uh had
[35:13] something on my heart I've had it on my
[35:15] heart about six months now I believe the
[35:17] Lord's he continues to bless us he's
[35:21] just he's just so good I've had it on my
[35:24] heart um Stephanie was reading a book
[35:28] and she was so excited about it it was
[35:30] called the cross and the switchblade is
[35:31] anybody familiar with that
[35:33] book it's uh it's written by a man named
[35:36] David Wilkerson it's it's basically his
[35:38] story about how he
[35:40] started this organization called Teen
[35:43] Challenge and it's done just it's been a
[35:46] tremendous work it's done so much for uh
[35:49] for so many people and it's not just for
[35:52] teens it's for the whole spectrum of
[35:55] society um by the way way brother Aaron
[35:58] pointed out to me this morning speaking
[36:00] of of our young people that they're
[36:02] about to go back to school if you
[36:03] haven't already brothers and sisters
[36:05] pray for our youth amen and when you go
[36:08] back to school young brothers and young
[36:10] sisters be a light wherever you are be
[36:14] wherever you go bring that faith of
[36:16] Jesus Christ with you be encouraged and
[36:19] then you encourage others also sister
[36:22] Becky I just saw you back there God
[36:23] bless you it's good to see you um but uh
[36:27] so this is been on my heart this Teen
[36:28] Challenge and
[36:31] and thinking about the tremendous
[36:35] testimony of this man named David
[36:38] Wilkerson how he was led and and I can't
[36:42] give the story now it's so long and just
[36:45] so powerful but how he was led to these
[36:48] in inner city Youth and the drug addicts
[36:51] and and all of the the abusers and the
[36:54] Crim ridden gangs and all that and and
[36:57] just how the the Lord just paved his way
[36:59] provided not only provided an audience
[37:02] for him but provided the money that he
[37:04] needed to go out and and do the work and
[37:07] it's just it's been something that's
[37:08] just been on my heart to
[37:10] have a type of
[37:13] a Ministry that we can help people off
[37:18] the streets and I think we're in a good
[37:20] place in this this portion of Tucson
[37:23] that we can really use that so I've been
[37:26] praying about it and and just thinking
[37:28] about it for for quite a few months now
[37:31] now really I mean it's been a couple
[37:33] years now ever since I started coming to
[37:35] this Tucson
[37:36] Tabernacle um
[37:39] so sister um sister Zyra gave me a
[37:42] testimony the other day um we spoke on
[37:45] the phone and she said that she was at
[37:48] this thrift store just down the road
[37:50] here on um stone stone and Roger around
[37:54] there and she was in there and she was
[37:56] doing some shopping for or something and
[37:59] she started listening to the music that
[38:03] was being played in the store and she
[38:06] heard oh this is Christian
[38:08] music it just made her feel good so so
[38:12] she she uh she had uh someone on her
[38:15] heart a family member that really needs
[38:17] to get into some sort of program so she
[38:20] was talking to the people there and it
[38:22] turns out it's a it's a Christian thrift
[38:24] store and she wanted she asked do you
[38:27] have any programs that you know of that
[38:31] could be for this this um family member
[38:33] that needs it and they said yeah and and
[38:36] they told her about this program that
[38:39] they have so I was talking with sister
[38:41] Zyra and she um relayed this to me and I
[38:43] said you know what it's on my way home
[38:44] I'll stop by there so I was driving by
[38:50] and I had a hard day at work and and I
[38:51] was just really struggling with some
[38:53] things and I always like to drive by the
[38:55] church just makes me feel better so I
[38:58] just drove by and just just to look at
[39:00] the building and and see what the Lord's
[39:02] doing it just gives me Faith brothers
[39:04] and sisters just makes me feel good so I
[39:06] drove by and and looked at the church
[39:09] and then I remembered oh sister zyus
[39:11] said to to visit this this thrift shop
[39:14] so I go in there and uh I walk in and
[39:17] there's a bunch of people at the cash
[39:18] register and I immediately notice that
[39:21] um the m Christian music I thought okay
[39:25] this this feels good and it's just it's
[39:26] pretty
[39:27] bear and there isn't a whole lot of
[39:29] stuff in there so if I forget I I
[39:32] recommend this place if you have any
[39:34] donations that you want to make of of
[39:36] decent furniture or anything bring it to
[39:38] this thrift store I think they could
[39:40] really use it they're doing a good work
[39:42] so I was I was in there and I waited
[39:44] till everybody left and then the guy
[39:45] behind the counter um I walked up and I
[39:49] asked him I said uh uh a a friend of
[39:52] mine told me that you all have a um a
[39:56] program for substance abusers and I said
[40:00] uh and not just for kids for for adults
[40:03] I said uh do you have something like
[40:05] that and he looked at me and said not
[40:09] me I said not for
[40:11] me and I said well you know I on
[40:14] Tabernacle I'm the pastor of that church
[40:15] and it's like not for me and and he says
[40:19] he says yeah and he gave me a flyer oh I
[40:21] left it in my vehicle um he gave me a
[40:23] flyer and it was Teen Challenge
[40:27] and he says 'y yeah he says if if you
[40:30] someone needs help he says ' we'll help
[40:33] them and no we won't require any payment
[40:36] and I said well I would like to I would
[40:38] like for our church to help in this so
[40:41] I'm talking with him and as when he
[40:45] mentioned Teen Challenge this kind of
[40:47] squirly guy he was working there he he
[40:50] has one eye that goes this way and one
[40:52] ey that goes straight and he said he
[40:54] says I'm six months into the program

[41:13] says I'm nine months in and he says it's
[41:16] the best program in the in the world he
[41:18] says he says we're serving the lord
[41:20] we're doing this and what did this place
[41:21] does is it hires these people to help
[41:23] get them off the streets and give them a
[41:25] job to do and I was like Lord this is

[41:43] so that's how I was feeling and I said I
[41:47] said uh maybe just Lord maybe just a
[41:49] little bit more and and kind of the
[41:51] squirrly looking guy he comes he comes
[41:54] by and I said well I said kind of my

[43:38] we'll see we'll see we we don't want to
[43:40] get ahead of the Lord but we'll see how
[43:43] it moves and brother Arie
[43:46] maybe we might have something to direct
[43:49] some of these people that we witness to
[43:50] all the time that really need the Lord I
[43:53] know brother Arie has such a burden amen
[43:55] for the homeless people and the
[43:57] substance abusers so maybe we'll start
[43:59] moving that direction and we we'll start
[44:01] helping in that way it was just it it
[44:04] was just a a the Lord was with was with
[44:07] me there and I was telling this
[44:11] testimony and somebody tells me they
[44:14] said how do you have all these
[44:17] testimonies like wow you're you're
[44:19] always how do you have how does the lord
[44:21] always do this stuff in your life he
[44:23] said you know the Lord I feel like the
[44:24] Lord's not doing doing anything in my
[44:26] life he said I serve the Lord and I do
[44:28] all this and
[44:31] because I put myself in that situation
[44:35] exactly because I put myself where the
[44:38] Lord can use me I could have just drove
[44:40] right by the thrift store and I wouldn't
[44:43] have had that testimony to to give to
[44:44] the church but we need to put oursel in
[44:47] the Lord's way put oursel out so the
[44:49] Lord can use us and in doing that always
[44:52] be ready to give a witness always be
[44:54] ready to talk about the Lord and then he
[44:57] he can use you and we're about to read
[44:59] about these Heroes of Faith in in
[45:01] Hebrews chap 11 they were always
[45:04] available for God they always put
[45:06] themselves out there they they walked in
[45:09] God's
[45:10] path and they stopped at the thrift
[45:15] store they did
[45:17] itow when Matthew was there and Jesus
[45:20] Christ walked by he's there with
[45:22] changing the money he had this great
[45:25] career this man walked by he said I'm
[45:28] done with it I'm following him and if he
[45:31] would have stayed a tax collector we
[45:33] would never know his name but instead he
[45:37] wrote the first book in the New
[45:41] Testament I mean tremendous on because
[45:44] he got up and he did it he put himself
[45:47] out there so that God could use him and
[45:50] what I don't tell you all is the nine
[45:54] out of 10 times that I fail
[45:57] maybe 99 out of a 100 I don't tell you
[46:00] the story I embarrassed my wife I don't
[46:03] tell you the story when we were at an
[46:05] ice cream place in Jeffersonville and
[46:07] these people got out of church and these
[46:10] two old ladies were sitting at the table
[46:13] there in the in the in the ice cream
[46:15] area and I went down and I said so did
[46:18] you just get out of church the woman
[46:20] said yeah and I said uh what the what
[46:24] the preacher preach about uh I don't
[46:27] know it's like okay do you love the Lord
[46:31] um yeah okay
[46:35] um uh what's your favorite scripture in
[46:38] the Bible well and these two old old
[46:42] women um she said something I said I
[46:46] said have you given your heart to the
[46:48] Lord Jesus and and the old woman says
[46:49] you know what I believe a Christian is
[46:51] she said I believe a Christian is
[46:53] someone that would allow two women who
[46:55] just got out of Church to enjoy their
[46:58] ice cream without bothering
[47:01] them I don't tell you those
[47:04] stories but that's usually what
[47:07] happens we've got to put ourself out
[47:11] there and if you fail 99 times out of a
[47:14] 100 you succeeded one
[47:16] time and we want to succeed I got the
[47:20] brothers together last night and we went
[47:22] to visit a church literally across the
[47:25] street over here and I appreciate the
[47:29] brothers coming and and we went over
[47:30] there just to put out the right hand of
[47:32] Fellowship to this this little Spanish
[47:35] church and we went in there and uh it
[47:38] was people were so nice and there's a
[47:40] small group what was it maybe 30 people
[47:43] something like that it's all men all
[47:45] from young men all the way up to older
[47:48] men and uh they uh we we got our place
[47:53] and we all sat down and then the music
[47:57] started and it was
[48:00] terrible it
[48:03] was
[48:05] loud banging drums I was like oh man and
[48:10] I was struggling my head started
[48:12] hurting I couldn't understand anything
[48:14] that was saying because it was so loud
[48:16] and so turned up and the speakers were
[48:18] were cracking it was just it was it was
[48:20] just like I was like oh man I said Lord
[48:23] and I had to bow my
[48:24] head during the the the the pre-service
[48:28] during the worship service and say Lord
[48:31] I'm sorry I made a mistake for bringing
[48:32] these brothers over here with me I said
[48:36] Lord I'm sorry and and U I said I said
[48:42] Lord just just help us to get through
[48:44] and and and I made a mistake and and it
[48:47] continued
[48:48] on and
[48:50] then they uh you know when we clap at
[48:52] the end of the of the song I was
[48:54] clapping because it was over
[49:00] and
[49:01] then they uh they invited the the guest
[49:06] speaker and uh he came up and
[49:09] immediately I was in a bad mood I
[49:11] immediately didn't like him he came up
[49:15] and after about two minutes my thoughts
[49:19] completely changed brothers and sisters
[49:21] we always have to be careful about
[49:23] judging and just because that music
[49:26] didn't sound right right to me just
[49:27] because I didn't I couldn't hear the
[49:30] words just because it it gave me a
[49:32] headache and it made me nervous it
[49:34] doesn't mean that it's not
[49:36] right we're not changing our music to
[49:39] match that but it doesn't mean that ours
[49:43] is any better than theirs that's the way
[49:45] that they like to worship right so it's
[49:48] okay and when this brother started
[49:52] ministering he has uh he has a church in
[49:55] Monterey Mexico
[49:57] and he
[49:58] started his
[50:01] sermon with his with his
[50:04] testimony and I was telling sister Lily
[50:07] and Daniel earlier it is so important
[50:10] that all of us have a
[50:13] testimony that is what you can tell
[50:15] people that's what grabs their attention
[50:17] if you would have just opened up the
[50:18] Bible and started teaching it would not
[50:21] have been effective like this but he
[50:24] started with his testimony he said I was
[50:26] he says I started drinking at 10 years
[50:28] old he says my dad was an alcoholic my
[50:32] dad used to beat me and he said he would
[50:35] beat me so bad he said the only when he
[50:38] would finally stop is when I would wet
[50:40] my
[50:42] pants he said he beat me so bad he said
[50:45] I hated my
[50:46] dad got to be 15 years old he meets a

[51:14] learned and he's on drugs and he's
[51:17] drinking he's an alcoholic he's doing
[51:18] all of this stuff he's a thug you should
[51:20] have seen the pictures of him tattoo
[51:22] across his
[51:23] stomach I mean just someone that you
[51:27] would not you would be afraid to even
[51:29] walk into this

[51:35] and the picture of him there and and
[51:37] they're just she's not living right she

[53:02] older than his oldest
[53:04] son and they're raising these
[53:08] children and he said I had to get over
[53:10] that with my dad and and he started
[53:12] quoting his dad his dad would be sitting
[53:14] there with a bottle in his hand and
[53:16] saying son never drink but he set a bad
[53:21] example how can you tell someone not to
[53:24] do something if you're doing it
[53:27] and yet this young man he the Lord is on
[53:30] his mind and he's he's he's moving
[53:32] forward in life and he's raising these
[53:34] children and he starts he gets gets a
[53:36] hold of the Lord he starts going to
[53:38] church he starts preaching the
[53:41] gospel and what a testimony I got to
[53:44] tell you I bowed my head so Lord I'm
[53:46] sorry I'm sorry for thinking anything
[53:49] bad about this music forgive me and he's
[53:53] giving this
[53:54] testimony and he raises these
[53:58] children and he put up a picture they
[54:00] all had a wedding at the same time all
[54:03] three of his
[54:05] boys they all married very fine young
[54:08] ladies and his daughter she's she is too
[54:11] young to get married yet but she's she's
[54:14] serving the lord and he
[54:16] said these brothers are a
[54:19] witness he said my
[54:22] children have my boys my daughter have
[54:27] never
[54:29] drank they have never done
[54:33] drugs and they have never slept with
[54:37] someone had sex with someone before
[54:40] marriage prise God and the same thing
[54:43] for these young ladies that these boys
[54:46] married they met young and these girls
[54:50] have the same testimony as the boys that
[54:53] they
[54:54] married I looked at that
[54:58] I said Lord that man is a
[55:02] hero he is a great man he could be
[55:06] listed in in some of these people that
[55:08] I'm going to talk about
[55:10] today they get he has he starts this
[55:14] church and this church grows and grows
[55:16] and he starts a Ministry out to the
[55:18] homeless people and the substance
[55:19] abusers now he's helping countless
[55:22] people he's got five or 600 people in
[55:24] his church and they have this ministry
[55:26] through Monteray helping the substance
[55:28] abusers and getting them back on their
[55:31] feet praise the Lord for this man for
[55:34] what he's
[55:36] done that young man well he's not a
[55:38] young man he's 40 years old I was I was
[55:40] looking at him like Lord that is a hero
[55:44] of the Gospel right there and I was so
[55:47] proud to have been
[55:48] there what a testimony from this
[55:53] man Hebrews chapter 1 I mean
[55:59] 11:1 now Faith is the substance of
[56:01] things hoped for the evidence of Things
[56:04] Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a
[56:08] good report through faith we understand
[56:10] that the worlds were framed by the word
[56:12] of God so that things which are seen
[56:16] were not made of things which do
[56:20] appear God requires
[56:23] Faith brothers and sisters we look at
[56:25] the things things
[56:27] now and they're here and God creates
[56:31] them but they came from
[56:35] nothing but he is God so when he speaks
[56:39] nothing becomes
[56:41] something that's with us in our in our
[56:45] lives this man right here nothing became
[56:49] something when God stepped into my
[56:51] life the man that we heard last night
[56:54] nothing became something
[56:57] when God stepped into his
[56:59] life by faith Abel offered unto God a
[57:02] more excellent sacrifice than
[57:05] Cain by which he obtained witness that
[57:09] he was righteous God testifying of his
[57:12] gifts and by it he being dead yet
[57:17] speaketh you know that
[57:20] story Genesis the beginning of
[57:23] Genesis Abel
[57:26] was born Cain was born
[57:29] twins Abel gave an offering to God that
[57:33] pleased God it was he killed a lamb he
[57:36] killed an animal knowing that his that
[57:39] something must die for life to be
[57:41] produced for life to continue Cain made
[57:45] a flowery altar it may have been much
[57:47] prettier much nicer but Abel's was
[57:50] accepted by God and Cain's was rejected
[57:54] because it wasn't right it was his
[57:56] self-righteous way that he said Lord
[57:58] you're going to do it my way because
[57:59] this looks better to
[58:02] me and then the anger welled up in Cain
[58:06] and he killed his
[58:08] brother and here comes God
[58:14] walking and he
[58:16] says where is your brother
[58:19] Cain he says his blood is crying out to
[58:25] me me from the
[58:28] ground think of the think of the faith
[58:32] that Abel had so much so that that when
[58:35] he was killed his blood poured out on
[58:38] the ground and even his blood was so
[58:41] full of faith that it cried out to
[58:44] God that's Faith how
[58:48] wonderful that we know that when we
[58:51] die whether you're I know people argue
[58:54] should be cremated should you be buried
[58:56] you whatever this listen wherever you
[58:59] are if you're an ash blowing in the wind
[59:03] it's going to cry out to God and God
[59:06] will
[59:07] answer Cain's own blood I mean Abel's
[59:10] own blood crying out to God and God
[59:13] heard you remember the story of Elisha
[59:16] when Elisha got sick and died and they
[59:18] put him in the Tomb and then there was
[59:21] there were there was a funeral
[59:22] possession coming by and I believe it
[59:23] was the moabites the Raiders they came
[59:25] down and they were going to rob this
[59:27] funeral possession they take the body
[59:29] and kick throw the body in the they
[59:32] threw the body in the grave and they
[59:34] took off well that grave just happened
[59:36] to be Elisha's grave the prophet that
[59:39] dead body of that that dead man that had
[59:42] died fell upon the body or even the
[59:47] grave we don't even know if the body was
[59:48] in there it fell in the grave of Elisha
[59:52] and that faith that was in Elisha that
[59:55] spirit that was in Elisha was so great
[59:58] that that body jumped up again came back
[1:00:02] to
[1:00:03] life that's how important this faith is
[1:00:05] and when we have that faith that is in
[1:00:08] us that we are Eternal there's nothing
[1:00:10] can ever take us take life from
[1:00:13] us if our blood is spread out on the
[1:00:16] ground it will cry out to God
[1:00:20] Beautiful by faith Enoch was translated
[1:00:23] that he should not see death and was not
[1:00:25] found because God had translated him for
[1:00:28] before his translation he had this
[1:00:32] testimony that he pleased God am how
[1:00:36] many want that
[1:00:39] testimony Lord when I
[1:00:42] die when I pass from this Earth let me
[1:00:45] have the same testimony that Enoch had I
[1:00:48] don't Enoch said we we don't know much
[1:00:52] about Enoch it's only a couple lines in
[1:00:54] the Bible but we do know that he
[1:00:57] something was so great about this man
[1:00:59] his faith was so great He's listed here
[1:01:01] that God just raptured him took him up
[1:01:06] and that same faith that was in Enoch
[1:01:09] has to be the same
[1:01:11] faith that will come at the
[1:01:14] Rapture it has to be the same can you
[1:01:18] imagine living a life that pleased God
[1:01:21] so much that he says this is my bride
[1:01:26] all right sweetheart let's go and he
[1:01:28] takes us up just like he took Enoch just
[1:01:30] like he took
[1:01:33] Elijah but is but without faith it is
[1:01:36] impossible to please him for he that
[1:01:39] cometh to God must believe that he is
[1:01:42] must believe that there is a
[1:01:46] God and he and that he is a rewarder of
[1:01:50] them that diligently seek Him think
[1:01:53] about everybody says oh I know there's a
[1:01:56] God do you really do we really know that
[1:01:59] there is a God then how come we don't
[1:02:02] have faith if he's God then he knows
[1:02:04] what's going on in my life if he's God
[1:02:07] then he knows my problems if he's God
[1:02:10] then he knows how he to get me out of
[1:02:12] him if he's God he knows how to save me
[1:02:14] if he's God he knows how to save my
[1:02:17] children my
[1:02:20] grandchildren but we have to believe
[1:02:22] that there really is a God and I think
[1:02:23] so much do we we say it we give it Lip
[1:02:26] lip service but do we really believe
[1:02:29] that there is a God if we really believe
[1:02:30] that there's a God then we should have
[1:02:32] faith in him that he can do it not faith
[1:02:35] in ourselves we always want to have
[1:02:37] faith in ourselves that's not it you
[1:02:40] have faith that he is God and that he is
[1:02:44] able by faith
[1:02:48] Noah being warned of
[1:02:50] God of things not yet as not seen as yet
[1:02:55] moved with fear here prepared an ark for
[1:02:58] the arc to the saving of his house by
[1:03:01] the which he com he condemned the world
[1:03:04] and became heir of righteousness which
[1:03:07] is by
[1:03:10] Faith by faith
[1:03:12] Abraham when he was called to go out
[1:03:14] into a place which he should after
[1:03:17] receive an for an inheritance obeyed and
[1:03:20] he went out not knowing whether he went
[1:03:22] if you read in the Bible God just calls
[1:03:25] Abraham out he says he says leave so
[1:03:29] Abraham gets his family and they just
[1:03:31] they leave he didn't tell him where he
[1:03:32] was
[1:03:33] going he just said come out so Abraham
[1:03:36] by faith just starts walking he probably
[1:03:40] walked hundreds of
[1:03:42] miles trust in God every step of the way
[1:03:47] knowing that God is there knowing that
[1:03:48] God had spoken to him we want it right
[1:03:52] now but Abraham reason that he is used
[1:03:56] as an example throughout the Bible is
[1:03:58] because he had such
[1:04:01] Faith by faith he soldiered in a Land Of
[1:04:04] Promise as in a strange country dwelling
[1:04:06] in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob The
[1:04:09] Heirs with him of the same promise for
[1:04:12] he looked for a city which hath
[1:04:14] foundations whose Builder and maker is
[1:04:17] God Amen through faith also Sarah her
[1:04:22] self-re receiving strength to conceive
[1:04:24] seed and was delivered of child when she
[1:04:27] was past age because she judged him
[1:04:30] faithful who had promised we are so hard
[1:04:33] on
[1:04:34] Sarah you know oh Sarah laughed you know
[1:04:37] it it was it was Abraham's Faith oh
[1:04:39] Sarah did this and you know she had
[1:04:41] Abraham go and and sleep with her
[1:04:42] concubine and then and then they had
[1:04:44] this child and then she kicks them out
[1:04:46] and and and she gets mad and all
[1:04:49] this the Bible sets Sarah as an example
[1:04:53] to us right here in Hebrews 11:
[1:04:58] 11 Sarah was a great woman and a
[1:05:04] leader she was tremendous because she
[1:05:07] had Faith she had faith in her husband's
[1:05:09] testimony that he had been with God
[1:05:13] right what a precious
[1:05:15] sister therefore sprang there even one
[1:05:19] and him as good as dead so many as the
[1:05:23] stars of the sky and multitude ude and
[1:05:26] as the sand which is in the which is by
[1:05:28] the seashore innumerable these all died
[1:05:31] in faith not having received the
[1:05:33] promises but having seen them a far off
[1:05:36] and were persuaded of them and embraced
[1:05:39] them and confessed that they were
[1:05:41] strangers and pilgrims on the earth they
[1:05:45] saw these
[1:05:47] things far off they knew they had
[1:05:50] promises Abraham had a promise you are
[1:05:52] going to be a father of many nations he
[1:05:54] said look up see all the Stars can you
[1:05:56] number them start counting them Abraham
[1:05:59] it's like one two three I lost my place
[1:06:01] all right try it again one two I lost my
[1:06:03] place there's
[1:06:05] Millions up there and God said look up
[1:06:08] Abraham that's how your seed's going to
[1:06:09] be but I don't have any
[1:06:11] children but that's how your seed's
[1:06:13] going to be and he held to that promise
[1:06:16] walking around doing everything that he
[1:06:18] could and yet making mistakes plenty of
[1:06:22] them but he had
[1:06:24] that the all died in
[1:06:27] faith not having received the promises
[1:06:29] but having seen them a far off and were
[1:06:31] persuaded of them and embraced them and
[1:06:33] confessed that they were strangers and
[1:06:35] pilgrims on Earth they saw as I said
[1:06:38] they saw these these promises a far off
[1:06:40] I remember I was hunting a few years ago
[1:06:42] and it was hot we were out for the
[1:06:44] morning hunt and we were coming back
[1:06:47] down in the catalinas and I looked
[1:06:50] brother John and I saw my
[1:06:52] truck and it was way out there like
[1:06:57] uncomfortably
[1:07:00] far I looked and I'm on the side of this
[1:07:03] mountain and there's this little white
[1:07:05] dot out there and it's my binoculars
[1:07:08] yeah that's I think that's my
[1:07:11] truck so start walking but I kept it in
[1:07:15] sight and it wasn't a straight journey I
[1:07:18] had to go down the valley and up the
[1:07:20] mountain and and down through the
[1:07:22] through the thickets and the bushes and
[1:07:23] I'd get up high and it would be a little
[1:07:25] bit closer and then I'd go down and and
[1:07:28] fight through the sticker bushes and
[1:07:30] everything and hot and tired and I'd get
[1:07:32] up to another Ridge and it was a little
[1:07:34] closer and that's how these these these
[1:07:37] tremendous people in this book they saw
[1:07:39] it a far off and they were willing to go
[1:07:42] get it they were willing to put their
[1:07:45] lives on the line they were willing to
[1:07:48] have faith in this because they knew I
[1:07:51] knew my truck was there I just had to
[1:07:53] get there
[1:07:56] for they that that say such things
[1:07:59] declare plainly that they seek a country
[1:08:02] and truly if they had been mindful of
[1:08:04] that country from whence they came out
[1:08:06] they might have had opportunity to have
[1:08:08] returned but now they desire a a better
[1:08:11] country that is a Heavenly wherefore God
[1:08:14] is not ashamed to be called their God
[1:08:17] for he hath prepared for them a
[1:08:22] city not ashamed God's not ashamed to be
[1:08:25] called our God we're ashamed of
[1:08:29] him it's sad but how many people are
[1:08:32] ashamed of God how many people won't
[1:08:35] stand up and say I'm a
[1:08:40] Christian I don't act like that I don't
[1:08:43] make fun of God I Revere prayer I
[1:08:48] Revere God and maybe I don't fit
[1:08:52] in but you know what I'll Stand with the
[1:08:55] man that died on that cross more than I
[1:08:59] will stand with the pressures that the
[1:09:01] world puts on
[1:09:03] me as I said God's not ashamed of us I
[1:09:07] believe he's proud of us I believe he
[1:09:09] loves us and we should be proud of him
[1:09:12] we should always be singing his glory we
[1:09:15] should always be talking about him never
[1:09:18] be ashamed of the Lord never be ashamed
[1:09:20] of this Bible it's everything always be
[1:09:24] willing
[1:09:25] to quote it always be willing to tell
[1:09:29] your testimony as I said we all need to
[1:09:31] have a
[1:09:34] testimony by faith Abraham when he was
[1:09:37] tried he offered up Isaac and he that
[1:09:39] had received the promise offered up his
[1:09:42] only begotten son of whom it was said
[1:09:45] that in Isaac thy she seed Shall be
[1:09:47] Called accounting that God was able to
[1:09:51] raise him up even from the dead from
[1:09:53] whence also he had received received him
[1:09:56] in a
[1:09:57] figure this boy Isaac was promised to
[1:10:03] Abraham remember the stars of the sky
[1:10:06] and Abraham still was without child so
[1:10:08] so he had a
[1:10:11] baby with his
[1:10:13] concubine Sarah maybe doubted Abraham
[1:10:18] didn't really know what to do so they
[1:10:19] did this and and and Abraham's like well
[1:10:21] maybe maybe this ishmail maybe this
[1:10:24] other son Maybe that's the seed that are
[1:10:26] raised up and God said no it's going to
[1:10:29] be another one and then this young this
[1:10:31] boy is born and he and he he raises him
[1:10:36] and Isaac was not a 10-year-old or
[1:10:38] 12-year-old or seven-year-old boy like
[1:10:40] you
[1:10:41] see when Abraham brought him up to mount
[1:10:45] Mariah to sacrifice him he was like 2530
[1:10:49] years
[1:10:51] old his beloved Son now look at my son
[1:10:54] Daniel
[1:10:57] thinking about think about taking him up
[1:11:00] knowing good and well and here he goes
[1:11:03] going up the mountain God had told him
[1:11:04] to sacrifice this boy that I gave you
[1:11:07] that didn't yet have children and take
[1:11:10] him up lay him on the altar build an
[1:11:12] altar kill him and burn it and that's
[1:11:15] what I want can you imagine so he's
[1:11:18] walking up there and here's his son
[1:11:21] going and he's like hey Dad uh yeah we
[1:11:23] have the bundle of sticks
[1:11:26] and there's no sacrifice where's the
[1:11:29] lamb where's the
[1:11:31] RAM and he says says son God will
[1:11:35] provide a
[1:11:37] sacrifice you go up
[1:11:39] there he lays his son on the
[1:11:44] altar the young man lays down he takes
[1:11:48] the knife to kill his
[1:11:53] son according to God's promise
[1:11:57] God says it's enough Abraham I know you
[1:12:00] I know you love me I know you believe me
[1:12:03] and there they looked and in this desert
[1:12:05] place there's a
[1:12:06] Ram stuck in the tree they go get that
[1:12:10] and that becomes the burnt offering
[1:12:13] that's what he's saying here he's saying
[1:12:15] that he was he was going to give up his
[1:12:17] son but whose spirit is that in in
[1:12:19] Abraham think about someone else who
[1:12:21] gave up his son and this son was greater
[1:12:25] than
[1:12:26] Isaac probably the same age 33 years
[1:12:31] old but this one really happened nailed
[1:12:34] him to a cross imagine how proud the
[1:12:37] father was of his son Jesus Christ never
[1:12:39] sinned never did a thing
[1:12:42] wrong and yet put him on the cross for
[1:12:45] everybody to laugh at to strip naked
[1:12:48] spit on his
[1:12:49] face Abraham a beautiful
[1:12:52] type of God and his son
[1:12:56] by faith Jacob when he was dying blessed
[1:12:59] both the sons of Joseph Joseph and
[1:13:01] worshiped leaning upon the top of his
[1:13:05] staff brothers and sisters he blessed
[1:13:07] his family bless your
[1:13:12] family bless your
[1:13:15] children you have to have a blessing to
[1:13:17] give a blessing make sure you are right
[1:13:20] with God and lay your blessings upon
[1:13:23] your family you can do it says in the
[1:13:27] book you have every right to bless your
[1:13:30] family not only your children but your
[1:13:32] grandchildren so there's Jacob you know
[1:13:34] the story about Jacob how he how he
[1:13:37] wrestled with the angel so he's going he
[1:13:39] has his twin brother
[1:13:41] Esau and he had left and he had stolen
[1:13:44] the birth Birthright Esau was not happy
[1:13:46] with
[1:13:47] him bad deal Esau is a great warrior
[1:13:53] Jacob wasn't so Jac is like man what do
[1:13:55] I do so he sends his servants out he's
[1:13:58] got to meet he's got to come back home
[1:14:01] so he's going to meet his brother he's
[1:14:03] worried his brother is gonna kill
[1:14:05] everybody take everything
[1:14:07] away
[1:14:09] so Jacob goes before the Lord and a man
[1:14:15] comes that night an angel of God the
[1:14:18] Bible says that Jacob wrestled with God
[1:14:22] and he wrestled with him all night
[1:14:26] you know you know how that was me
[1:14:29] neither but it happened he wrestled with
[1:14:33] his Angel so finally all night long then
[1:14:35] the Sun starts coming up and the Angel's
[1:14:38] like let me go the sun's coming up and
[1:14:41] he's like I'm not going to let you go
[1:14:42] until you bless me so then the angel did
[1:14:45] some sort of a
[1:14:47] move and struck Jacob in the
[1:14:51] hip caused him to be crippled for the
[1:14:54] rest of his life life Jacob says I'm
[1:14:56] still not letting go until you bless me
[1:14:59] so then the angel gives his Blessing to
[1:15:02] Jacob now we see Jacob limped the rest
[1:15:06] of his life and here he is he's got his
[1:15:08] children before him and he limps up and
[1:15:11] he
[1:15:12] leans on his staff because of that
[1:15:15] crippled
[1:15:16] hip and he lays his
[1:15:19] blessings upon his children each one of
[1:15:22] them all 12 of them and then
[1:15:26] after that his son Joseph brings his two
[1:15:30] sons to their grandpa Jacob and has him
[1:15:34] blessed them you know the story where he
[1:15:36] crosses his hands with Ephraim and
[1:15:38] Manasseh but he laid His blessings upon
[1:15:40] them so those blessings come down you
[1:15:43] think that your grandpa and his prayers
[1:15:46] brother Burgess you think you're not
[1:15:48] benefiting from those blessings that
[1:15:49] he's given you he has blessed you I want
[1:15:53] to bless my children the same way amen
[1:15:55] lay my blessings upon them brother
[1:16:00] helped me out the other day so
[1:16:03] much and I wanted to pay him and he
[1:16:07] wouldn't take any money and I was
[1:16:09] sitting in my study and I was like Lord
[1:16:12] this brother has has done so much what
[1:16:14] can I do for him he won't take any money
[1:16:18] now I'm not saying that if you owe
[1:16:21] somebody money I give you my blessing
[1:16:24] I'm enough
[1:16:25] you have to give you have to pay them
[1:16:27] but this brother he's sitting in the
[1:16:29] back wouldn't take
[1:16:32] anything so I said Lord I'm reading this
[1:16:36] chapter right here I said Lord if I have
[1:16:39] anything let me give my blessings upon
[1:16:41] him and may he be blessed for what he's
[1:16:43] done for me amen and that's how we can
[1:16:45] do brothers and sisters we have that we
[1:16:47] have that Authority we have that ability
[1:16:49] to lay that those Blessings by faith
[1:16:52] Joseph when he died made mention
[1:16:56] of the departing of the children of
[1:16:57] Israel and gave commandment concerning
[1:16:59] his bones by faith Moses when he was
[1:17:02] born was hid three months of his parents
[1:17:04] because they saw that he was a proper
[1:17:06] child and they were not afraid of the
[1:17:07] king's Commandments by faith Moses when
[1:17:09] he was come to years refused to be
[1:17:11] called the son of Pharaoh's daughter
[1:17:14] this man Moses um amram and jabed they
[1:17:18] had this son they knew that he was
[1:17:21] special they were killing the babies at
[1:17:23] that time the the boy baby
[1:17:25] throwing them to the crocodiles out in
[1:17:27] the Nile River and here they build this
[1:17:29] little basket and they take their son
[1:17:31] and they had faith in God how many of us
[1:17:34] would have faith in ourselves in hiding
[1:17:35] our children more than faith in God they
[1:17:38] put them they they felt the leading they
[1:17:40] put him in the basket and put him out
[1:17:42] among the crocodiles and Out Among
[1:17:44] everything else and he floated right
[1:17:46] down to Pharaoh's
[1:17:48] daughter then she raised him as a king
[1:17:52] he had everything that he could ever
[1:17:53] want
[1:17:55] raised him as as rich and and and as
[1:17:59] whatever he had a desire to have he was
[1:18:02] given to him and then he looked and he
[1:18:03] says you know what he said I would
[1:18:06] rather be a Christian than to have all
[1:18:09] of the the world's money and everything
[1:18:12] else all of the women all of the
[1:18:14] popularity all of the influence all of
[1:18:16] the Tik Tok all of the Instagram all of
[1:18:19] that stuff I would rather have Jesus
[1:18:22] Christ and if I'm going to be on there I
[1:18:24] am going to lift up Jesus Christ and I'm
[1:18:26] going to influence people in that
[1:18:28] way he says I don't want to be with
[1:18:32] Pharaoh he became a
[1:18:35] slave by faith
[1:18:39] Moses when he was come to years refused
[1:18:41] to be called the son of Pharaoh's
[1:18:43] daughter choosing rather to suffer
[1:18:46] Affliction with the people of God than
[1:18:48] to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a
[1:18:50] season Moses his greatest desire was to
[1:18:53] serve God
[1:18:56] esteeming the reproach of
[1:18:58] Christ greater riches than the treasures
[1:19:00] of Egypt for he had respect unto the
[1:19:03] recompense of reward the English
[1:19:04] Standard Version says for he kept his
[1:19:07] eyes on the future reward right he saw
[1:19:11] that truck out in the distance and he's
[1:19:13] focusing on that he wanted that future
[1:19:16] reward and not the Quick
[1:19:19] Fix he knew he had a promise Deuteronomy
[1:19:25] he had this promise he said the Lord
[1:19:26] your God will raise up for you a prophet
[1:19:28] like me Moses speaking among you from
[1:19:32] your fellow Israelites then you must
[1:19:34] listen to him for this is what you asked
[1:19:36] of the Lord God at Horeb on the day of
[1:19:39] the assembly when you said let us not
[1:19:42] hear the voice of the Lord Our God nor
[1:19:45] see this great fire anymore or we will
[1:19:48] die the Lord said unto me Moses speaking
[1:19:51] talking to the people the Lord told me
[1:19:54] what they say is good I will raise up
[1:19:57] for them a prophet like you
[1:20:01] Moses from among their fellow Israelites
[1:20:03] and I will put my words in his mouth and
[1:20:06] he will tell them everything I
[1:20:08] command I myself will call to account
[1:20:11] anyone that does not listen to my words
[1:20:13] that he that this Prophet speaks in my
[1:20:15] name who was he talking about Jesus
[1:20:18] Christ amen he says he's going to be
[1:20:21] like you Moses except better
[1:20:25] by faith he forsook Egypt not fearing
[1:20:27] the Wrath of the king for he endured as
[1:20:29] seeing him who is visible invisible
[1:20:32] through faith he kept the Passover and
[1:20:34] the sprinkling of the blood lest he that
[1:20:36] destroyed the firstborn should touch
[1:20:39] them
[1:20:41] faith is
[1:20:43] action Faith is doing
[1:20:46] something faith is not sitting there and
[1:20:48] saying Lord I just want you to I just
[1:20:50] want you to be first in my life I just
[1:20:52] want you to help me Faith is is
[1:20:54] something that you do Jesus said have
[1:20:58] faith it means have faith it doesn't
[1:21:01] mean just sit back stop by the thrift
[1:21:04] store witness to someone put
[1:21:08] yourself in God's
[1:21:11] service by
[1:21:13] faith they passed through the Red Sea as
[1:21:15] by dry land which the Egyptians
[1:21:17] aade to do were drowned by faith the
[1:21:19] walls of Jericho fell down after they
[1:21:22] were compassed about seven days by by
[1:21:24] faith Rahab the Harlot perished not with
[1:21:27] them that believed not when she had
[1:21:30] received the spies with peace so so
[1:21:33] Joshua goes over he attacks um Jericho
[1:21:37] big giant walls they walk they March
[1:21:39] around the city the walls fall down they
[1:21:42] go in and Rahab had protected the spies
[1:21:46] that we went that went in before because
[1:21:48] she had the Revelation that these
[1:21:51] brothers were right in what they were
[1:21:52] saying
[1:21:55] so she hid them didn't tell on
[1:21:58] them and then Joshua's destroying Army
[1:22:02] comes in kills everybody but Rahab and
[1:22:05] her family everyone in her house because
[1:22:09] Rahab had that Faith does it say if her
[1:22:12] brothers and sisters and Mom and Dad
[1:22:14] were Sinners or
[1:22:16] not doesn't say but because of her faith
[1:22:20] they were saved because of rahab's faith
[1:22:23] and then you know what happened she was
[1:22:24] a
[1:22:26] prostitute she made her living in a bad
[1:22:28] way right but then God turned that
[1:22:32] around through her faith in God and
[1:22:35] married her to one of the greatest
[1:22:37] Generals in Joshua's Army and gave her a
[1:22:40] Wonderful Life and then she had children
[1:22:43] and those children had children and then
[1:22:45] you know who sprang up from there King
[1:22:48] David from the from the union of Rahab
[1:22:52] and Salon
[1:22:57] and what shall I more say for the time
[1:22:59] would fail me to tell of Gideon of baric
[1:23:01] and of Samson of jeepa and of David and
[1:23:04] also Samuel and of the prophets and
[1:23:06] brothers and sisters I wish I had like
[1:23:08] all day
[1:23:09] long now I know what this brother's
[1:23:11] saying when he wrote this like we can
[1:23:13] keep going let's talk about all of
[1:23:16] these who through faith subdued Kingdom
[1:23:19] wrought righteousness obtained promises
[1:23:21] stopped the mouth of lions I'm not
[1:23:25] and what more shall I say for the time
[1:23:28] would fail me to tell of Gideon and of
[1:23:30] baric and Samson and jeepa and David
[1:23:32] also and Samuel and of the prophets who
[1:23:35] through faith subdued kingdoms wrought
[1:23:36] righteousness obtained the obtained
[1:23:39] promises stopped the mouth of lions
[1:23:41] quenched the violence of fire escaped
[1:23:43] the edge of the sword out of weakness
[1:23:44] were made strong waxed Valiant in fight
[1:23:48] turn to flight the armies of the aliens
[1:23:51] women received their dead raised to life
[1:23:53] again the shunamite woman and
[1:23:56] Elisha the boy
[1:23:59] died Elisha came and laid his body upon
[1:24:02] the boy and he came back to life again
[1:24:05] same happen happened with his
[1:24:07] predecessor Elijah and the widow
[1:24:11] woman women received their dead to life
[1:24:13] again and others were tortured not
[1:24:15] accepting Deliverance that they might
[1:24:17] obtain a better
[1:24:19] resurrection and others had trial of
[1:24:22] cruel mockings and scourgings Y moreover
[1:24:24] over bonds and imprisonment they were
[1:24:27] stoned believe it was Zechariah that was
[1:24:29] stoned the prophet and others they were
[1:24:32] son
[1:24:33] aunder Isaiah son in half they were
[1:24:38] tempted they were slain with a sword

[1:24:46] New Testament wandered
[1:24:49] about in his goat

[1:24:55] have anything he ate Grasshoppers and
[1:24:57] honey that was his that was his
[1:25:02] diet but they took god
[1:25:05] seriously they put God's word first
[1:25:08] these were great people who put faith
[1:25:12] into action they actually did it they
[1:25:15] didn't just talk about it they didn't
[1:25:17] just teach it they did
[1:25:23] it couple
[1:25:25] minutes but they were brothers and
[1:25:28] sisters they were fallible
[1:25:31] normal people that had problems every
[1:25:34] single one of them they they weren't
[1:25:37] these great people on a pedestal that
[1:25:39] you might think
[1:25:41] here they they they did things wrong but
[1:25:46] it's okay Moses was a murderer he forgot
[1:25:50] to circumcise his son Abraham gave his
[1:25:52] wife to another man
[1:25:55] because he was afraid of being killed
[1:25:56] Sarah laughed at the promise of God Noah
[1:26:00] got drunk when he got off the ark
[1:26:03] planted a Vineyard made some wine got
[1:26:05] drunk Rahab was a prostitute they were
[1:26:08] average ordinary people just like you
[1:26:10] and me
[1:26:12] yes but they put God first they had
[1:26:15] faith and they changed the world and we
[1:26:17] can do
[1:26:20] that of whom the world is not worthy
[1:26:23] amen
[1:26:25] H that is so beautiful of whom the world
[1:26:29] was not one worthy they wandered in
[1:26:31] deserts and in mountains and in dens and
[1:26:33] caves of the earth and all these having
[1:26:35] obtained a good report through faith
[1:26:37] received not the promise God having
[1:26:39] provide some better thing for
[1:26:41] us than these people a better thing for
[1:26:45] us that they without us should be made
[1:26:49] perfect better than the burning bush
[1:26:52] experienced with Moses better than than
[1:26:54] David killing Goliath better than the
[1:26:56] walls of Jericho coming down with Joshua
[1:27:00] better than the prostitute Rahab finding
[1:27:02] a Godly husband better than all of these
[1:27:06] things better than the blessings that
[1:27:09] Jacob gave to his
[1:27:12] sons better for
[1:27:15] us because they had not received the
[1:27:17] promise of Jesus Christ yet and we
[1:27:21] have our faith should be higher than
[1:27:27] theirs it should be we should be walking
[1:27:31] in faith saying Lord you've done all of
[1:27:34] these things I read in my Bible read
[1:27:36] read Hebrews 11 wherefore we wherefore
[1:27:40] seeing we are Al we also are encompassed
[1:27:43] about with so great cloud of
[1:27:47] witness let us lay aside every weight
[1:27:50] Hebrews 121 let us lay aside every
[1:27:53] weight and the sin do easily beset us
[1:27:55] and let us run with patience the race
[1:27:57] that is set before us this cloud of
[1:28:00] witness that's all over the place it's
[1:28:03] in the Bible here all of these great men
[1:28:05] and women of God and we read it and it's
[1:28:07] everywhere we have no excuse we're
[1:28:09] surrounded by this now let us run the
[1:28:13] same race that they
[1:28:14] ran looking unto
[1:28:17] Jesus it's better than my truck out
[1:28:21] there a few miles
[1:28:22] away keeping your your eye on the cross
[1:28:25] looking at looking to Jesus the author
[1:28:27] and finisher of our faith who for the
[1:28:30] joy that was set before him endured the
[1:28:32] cross despising the shame and is sat
[1:28:36] down at the right hand of the Throne of
[1:28:39] God amen amen brothers and sisters we
[1:28:44] live below yes our means we live below

[1:28:59] with his
[1:29:00] family he started with his family got
[1:29:02] everything in order with his family and
[1:29:04] then he started reaching
[1:29:06] out and he started helping other people
[1:29:09] but he started right at home he built
[1:29:11] this
[1:29:12] foundation and now he's helped hundreds
[1:29:14] or even thousands of
[1:29:17] people because he was led by
[1:29:19] faith to do these things we were
[1:29:24] Made for
[1:29:27] More We Were Made for More than we give
