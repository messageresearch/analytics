[34:42] [Music]
[34:52] let's bow our heads

[34:59] there's an almighty god that's here with
[35:02] us this morning
[35:04] [Music]
[35:06] and he's here to answer our prayers and
[35:08] he cares about us
[35:11] now not as a ritual not as something
[35:13] that we just do every time we ask for
[35:16] prayer
[35:17] but if there would be something that's
[35:18] special upon your heart i pray that you
[35:21] would raise up your hand
[35:23] and hold that request dear to your heart
[35:26] as as we come before the throne of god
[35:31] and know that there's a god here that's
[35:33] with us this morning that's going to
[35:34] hear

[36:06] hearts

[36:10] these requests before you
[36:12] ask that you would answer
[36:15] knowing lord that it's maybe not our
[36:18] request but it's the holy spirit within
[36:20] us that brings this up before the throne
[36:22] of god
[36:23] our dear brother
[36:25] that's in prison now and and what a
[36:27] gallant request that he's brought

[36:36] he brought and we pray that each one of
[36:38] them would come before you
[36:41] and each request that it's on a part of
[36:43] our hearts we pray that it would come
[36:44] before you

[36:48] and that that we can expect these things
[36:51] to be answered

[43:52] wouldn't be anything better this morning
[43:54] than let him have his way
[43:57] lord we
[43:58] we just
[44:00] the only way for you to have your way is
[44:02] for ourselves to get out of the way
[44:05] and let you have your way lord and
[44:08] sometimes we want to hold on to the
[44:09] reigns we want to have the control we
[44:12] we get afraid we get nervous we get
[44:14] worried what could happen lord but
[44:17] you're faithful you never fail you've
[44:20] already walked this pathway you've been
[44:22] through it lord you understand it you
[44:24] know every turn
[44:25] everything coming our way so lord let us
[44:27] just yield to you
[44:28] and let you have your way this morning
[44:31] we ask in jesus christ's day
[44:33] amen thank you while you're standing
[44:36] we'll read one scripture isaiah 55
[44:40] verse 11
[44:43] yes
[44:45] so shall my word be that goeth forth out
[44:47] of my mouth
[44:49] it shall not return unto me void
[44:52] but it shall accomplish that which i
[44:54] please
[44:55] and it shall prosper in the thing
[44:58] whereto i sent it
[45:00] just the reading of the word of god
[45:02] should be enough to say thank you lord
[45:04] amen you may be seated
[45:08] we're going to have a baptism after
[45:11] the end of service today so we're going
[45:13] to get started
[45:14] allow for that
[45:17] and um
[45:19] there's a promise
[45:21] if you'll be baptized in the name of the
[45:22] lord jesus christ and give your heart to
[45:24] him he will
[45:25] give you the holy ghost
[45:27] because without it we don't have a
[45:29] chance
[45:30] amen so
[45:33] some things in our heart today and
[45:37] i uh
[45:39] last couple of days just thinking about
[45:41] these things
[45:43] where we should be today
[45:47] we came to tucson in 1976
[45:52] 46 years ago
[45:55] never thought we'd still be here
[45:57] we would have gone home a long time ago
[46:00] went through 1977 thinking that would be
[46:03] the end but we're still here today
[46:07] but
[46:08] i think it's closer than it's ever been
[46:11] there's so many things that hadn't been
[46:13] fulfilled yet in that time but they've
[46:15] come to their place
[46:18] but there's a bride being made ready
[46:22] and she's just about there i believe
[46:25] it's hard to imagine that we could go
[46:26] another 50 years
[46:29] but until then i promised the lord i'll
[46:31] give you my all
[46:33] how many would say that today lord i
[46:35] would surrender all and give you my own
[46:37] that you have your way
[46:40] i didn't give you this quote there
[46:45] um
[46:46] brother matt it was just something that
[46:47] added on after but from the exposition
[46:50] of the seven church ages
[46:52] revelation of jesus christ
[46:55] consider this since it is the blood of
[46:57] god it is perfect blood
[47:01] and if the perfect blood is loosing us
[47:03] from the power and the bondage and
[47:05] defilement of sin
[47:07] then the leucine is perfect
[47:09] and complete
[47:11] there is now therefore no condemnation
[47:14] who shall lay anything to the charge of
[47:16] god's elect
[47:18] it is god that justifieth or declares us
[47:21] righteous
[47:22] who is he that condemneth it is christ
[47:24] that died romans 8 33 and 34.
[47:27] there it is his death gives us the blood
[47:30] the blood has loosed us there is now no
[47:33] condemnation how can there be
[47:36] there is nothing to be condemned for
[47:38] because the blood has loosed us from sin
[47:41] we are free guiltless
[47:43] don't listen to man
[47:46] hang on a second don't listen to
[47:47] yourself
[47:48] that's the one that gives you trouble
[47:50] don't listen to man listen to the word
[47:53] you are loosed by the blood
[47:56] therefore there is no condemnation to
[47:59] them who are in christ jesus
[48:01] you might have brought a little burden
[48:03] with you today you might have come a
[48:05] little heavy you might have
[48:07] maybe had a tough week maybe a hard
[48:09] morning
[48:11] maybe you couldn't control your thoughts
[48:13] put it under the blood
[48:16] as quick as you can
[48:18] brother green used to remind us that all
[48:20] the time he said as quick as you can
[48:22] make it right
[48:24] ask forgiveness and it's cleansed
[48:27] and in god's eyes you never did it
[48:32] maybe in your brother's eye your
[48:33] sister's eye your your husband your
[48:35] wife's life but in god's eye the word
[48:36] counts
[48:38] you never did it
[48:40] oh what a god we serve
[48:46] if i would maybe
[48:49] today is is the thought is
[48:51] becoming the word of god
[48:54] as jesus himself being born in flesh
[48:58] became the living word
[49:02] and that's what we are supposed to be
[49:05] not just people who talk about it
[49:08] not people who can just point there was
[49:09] a prophet in the land and he gave us the
[49:11] word but of people that are living
[49:13] becoming the word of god the very action
[49:16] god chose to do it that way
[49:19] first in john chapter one we'll read
[49:21] verses one to five to start
[49:24] kind of do a little
[49:25] the background for that
[49:27] in the beginning was the word and the
[49:30] word was with god
[49:31] and the word was god
[49:34] in the the same was in the beginning
[49:36] with god
[49:37] it's eternal it never fails
[49:41] all things were made by him
[49:43] and without him was not anything made
[49:45] that was made
[49:47] in him was life
[49:49] and the life was the light of men
[49:52] and the light shineth in darkness
[49:54] and the darkness comprehendeth it not
[49:58] in him
[49:59] was life
[50:01] and the life was the light of man
[50:05] so if that same word is dwelling in you
[50:08] then life is in you
[50:10] and ye are the light of this world
[50:14] that's how god chose to do it
[50:17] sometimes our light can be a little dim
[50:19] maybe we shade it when we put a cover on
[50:21] it
[50:22] we struggle
[50:24] through the thought of how could i be
[50:28] the very word of god expressed
[50:31] especially when you know yourself
[50:33] speaking with brother dan a little bit i
[50:35] asked him if he would come in back meet
[50:37] with me last night he just felt
[50:39] to have them come pray for me before
[50:42] ministering this morning and
[50:44] shared some with it something i felt the
[50:46] lord just spoke to me
[50:49] jesus at 12 years old
[50:52] the family is headed back home
[50:55] and it takes them three days before they
[50:57] realize that he's not with them
[51:00] i hope we never get to that point
[51:03] where did i last leave my daughter you
[51:04] know
[51:07] and they go back looking for him
[51:09] and jesus was found in the temple
[51:13] at 12 years old
[51:18] and here's the the part to understand
[51:20] and sometimes difficult for us to
[51:21] understand he was a 12 year old
[51:26] the scripture tells us he was tempted he
[51:28] was tried in every manner such as us
[51:32] and i was thinking this as i was i went
[51:34] up for a walk and i say lord were you
[51:36] intimidated
[51:38] you were coming before the high priest
[51:39] you were coming for those who knew the
[51:41] law and you were going to stand in the
[51:43] temple with them
[51:46] how did how did you approach how did you
[51:48] go in
[51:50] you hear those that had had the
[51:52] opportunity to to have a meeting or a an
[51:55] interview with brother branham and they
[51:57] would make sure they made everything
[51:58] right
[51:59] they they knew the gift of the of god
[52:02] that was there
[52:04] and and
[52:06] i can imagine how would he approach
[52:10] and then for three days speak with the
[52:13] the what we would call the ministers the
[52:16] the teachers those men that have studied
[52:18] the word of god that's all they did
[52:20] their whole life
[52:22] and yet he stood there
[52:24] and they were marveled they were amazed
[52:26] at what he sold them and what he said
[52:30] because see he was the word of god made
[52:33] flesh
[52:35] and the word of god made flesh reflects
[52:38] the word of god
[52:41] and god's word never fails
[52:45] but he would be touched by the feeling
[52:47] of our infirmities
[52:49] brother joe when you're going through a
[52:50] hard time and you're struggling he went
[52:52] through it too for you
[52:54] so that when you ask him lord
[52:57] he understands
[53:00] to many people in this world they go to
[53:02] a a statue an image a stone something
[53:07] and they try to find mercy and they try
[53:09] to find help
[53:10] on a on a piece of rock and a wood
[53:12] carving and a picture
[53:14] and there is none there
[53:17] because there's no life in that
[53:21] but he was the light and the life of men
[53:26] but it's more than that he wants to
[53:28] dwell in you
[53:29] it in me
[53:31] and then you become the light and the
[53:34] life your very words your very actions
[53:37] the very life you live can impart
[53:39] eternal life to somebody else
[53:44] hope
[53:46] more than a hope a blessed assurance
[53:53] john
[53:54] chapter 5 38-39
[53:58] and then 46-47
[54:00] here's jesus speaking to
[54:02] to the priest
[54:04] of course he's not 12 years old anymore
[54:08] you know when he was 12 and and
[54:11] i was talking with brother dan because
[54:13] i was just asking him and
[54:14] some questions there we were just
[54:16] talking
[54:18] when he was 12 and he was in his
[54:19] neighborhood and he was working there
[54:21] were other 12 year olds around him there
[54:24] were other
[54:25] kids just like him same age
[54:28] and excuse me but there were other 12
[54:30] year old young ladies around him
[54:35] and yet he was without sin
[54:39] but again he can be touched by the
[54:41] filling of your infirmities because he
[54:43] walked through there
[54:45] and sometimes when you get to filling
[54:46] and thinking how could god understand
[54:48] this
[54:49] he's so great he's so marvelous
[54:52] but he says try me
[54:54] he says let me come and walk with you
[54:57] i've been there
[54:59] i've done that
[55:01] he knows the feeling of loss
[55:04] he knows the feeling of hurt
[55:06] he knows uh to how should i say he's
[55:09] been embarrassed by others he's
[55:11] everything that he went through like
[55:12] that
[55:14] so that when you feel that way he says
[55:16] i've been there
[55:17] i can help you
[55:19] now here he's talking to the high priest
[55:20] now
[55:22] and he says then you have not his word
[55:24] abiding in you
[55:26] for whom he has sent you believe him not
[55:30] and he says search the scriptures for in
[55:32] them you think you have eternal life
[55:34] and they are which testify of me
[55:38] and then
[55:40] we'll read 46-47
[55:43] and of course we know they tell them
[55:44] well we have moses as our prophet
[55:47] for had ye believed moses you would have
[55:49] believed me for he wrote of me
[55:53] but ye believe not his writings how
[55:55] shall ye believe my words
[55:59] he just puts it straight out
[56:03] we have all of his words recorded here
[56:07] and we should read them daily
[56:09] read them continually
[56:11] let me just say it this way
[56:14] without this word brother branham
[56:15] doesn't have a message to deliver
[56:20] understand that
[56:21] the word of god
[56:23] being made real being made alive to us
[56:27] he said you these things are written of
[56:29] me and yet you don't believe
[56:35] the word being made
[56:36] made flesh
[56:39] be coming to a point
[56:41] where
[56:43] you are a living
[56:45] testimony
[56:47] you are a living bible
[56:51] in you dwells god
[56:56] you know he he he told brother branham
[56:58] and we've we've mentioned this many a
[57:00] times
[57:00] they're having that fellowship and
[57:02] brother dan evans gave the testimony
[57:03] because his grandfather was there in
[57:06] that time up and believe us in colorado
[57:10] and and the lord just tell them speak
[57:13] i'm having fellowship with you i'm
[57:15] enjoying my time with you
[57:17] he said speak to the storm
[57:20] hallelujah
[57:22] why
[57:23] why because christ lives in you and it
[57:26] has to it has to everything is subject
[57:29] to him
[57:31] not to me to him the one living in me
[57:35] and the less of me is the more of him
[57:40] psalms david
[57:43] david says here in psalms 119 probably
[57:45] one of the
[57:47] uh if you want to read the psalms
[57:49] encourage your heart a fallen man like
[57:51] david
[57:55] they did things that we would oh my how
[57:57] could how could that ever happen to
[57:59] david
[58:00] same way it happens to us
[58:03] blessed are the undefiled in the way
[58:06] who walk in the law of the lord
[58:10] blessed are they that keep his
[58:12] testimonies
[58:13] he says
[58:15] happy are they that keep his unchanging
[58:18] word
[58:19] that's i really like that translation
[58:21] his unchanged it's faithful it doesn't
[58:24] change you're not too sure is it going
[58:25] to be like this today or like that
[58:27] tomorrow it's right down the middle
[58:28] every time
[58:31] are they that keep his testimony and
[58:32] that seek him with the whole heart
[58:37] if if you fill something up to the top
[58:39] in this whole field there's not room for
[58:41] anything else
[58:43] because if you keep filling and then
[58:44] everything else spills out
[58:47] if you let them fill you completely
[58:49] there's not room for anything else
[58:53] the whole heart
[58:54] let's go on
[59:00] verse 3
[59:03] they also do no iniquity
[59:08] amen
[59:10] he's a god that forgives all even your
[59:12] iniquity
[59:14] in god's sight there is no iniquity
[59:18] they walk in his ways
[59:21] as hearing brother
[59:24] lawson minister there's only one way and
[59:27] that's god's way
[59:31] every way there's a way that seemeth
[59:33] right to a man but it leads to
[59:34] destruction
[59:36] there's one way and you do god's way
[59:40] verse 4
[59:42] thou has commanded us to keep thy
[59:45] precepts diligently
[59:48] a diligent person is attending to it all
[59:51] the time watching it
[59:53] maybe sometimes a diligent per a person
[59:56] to you would look he's too concerned
[59:59] he he's more worried about that than
[1:00:01] anything
[1:00:02] you're diligent to it it's your
[1:00:03] responsibility
[1:00:06] if it's your job to watch the door it's
[1:00:08] your job to watch the door that's what
[1:00:09] you're supposed to be doing
[1:00:12] but you ever seen somebody who's not
[1:00:13] very diligent at watching the door
[1:00:16] a lot of things get in a lot of things
[1:00:18] happen
[1:00:18] because they're busy doing something
[1:00:20] else my my son-in-law stephen when he
[1:00:22] was working for
[1:00:24] for best buys back in in wichita
[1:00:27] he stood by the door watching the
[1:00:29] security cameras now
[1:00:31] by law they cannot physically touch
[1:00:33] somebody that's that's doing something
[1:00:35] they shouldn't be doing they they could
[1:00:36] follow him around the store but you
[1:00:38] physically can't do anything to him you
[1:00:41] call the police you do that
[1:00:42] but generally if they're being watched
[1:00:45] they won't do what they're planning to
[1:00:46] do
[1:00:49] but i walked in one day and then we were
[1:00:51] up back there with him and he was
[1:00:53] standing there and he's watching the
[1:00:54] five different screens
[1:00:57] so i began to ask him i said
[1:00:59] how does this work he says well you have
[1:01:00] to be watching constantly
[1:01:03] you can't take your eyes off for a
[1:01:04] minute
[1:01:06] and he said some of them do
[1:01:08] and they get to talking to their friends
[1:01:10] and other things are going on over here
[1:01:12] and they don't see it
[1:01:14] he says but if you're watching all of
[1:01:15] them you can usually catch somebody that
[1:01:18] look you learn
[1:01:19] how they're suspicious you know what
[1:01:21] what they're doing and you can stop them
[1:01:24] but he said but i have to stay right
[1:01:26] here i can't walk away from this i need
[1:01:28] to look at it
[1:01:31] i asked them a question because right in
[1:01:33] the front there right by the door where
[1:01:34] these 55 75 inch big screen tvs
[1:01:38] and i said now if somebody grabs one of
[1:01:40] those and starts running out
[1:01:43] can you apprehend them he says no
[1:01:45] i'm not to touch them
[1:01:47] they can run if they get into car and
[1:01:48] drive away they take it
[1:01:51] so
[1:01:52] i said do you want one
[1:01:55] because you can't catch me i'll take it
[1:01:56] to your house
[1:01:58] he just left
[1:02:01] but a diligent person
[1:02:04] and he keeps a precept they watch it
[1:02:06] constantly
[1:02:08] that they're aware of it
[1:02:10] they're they're looking at where their
[1:02:12] steps go
[1:02:13] lord am i in your perfect will am i
[1:02:16] doing what you desire
[1:02:19] that's what the word diligent means
[1:02:25] it's verse 5
[1:02:27] and he says oh that my ways direct were
[1:02:30] directed to keep thy statutes
[1:02:33] then shall i not be ashamed
[1:02:35] when i have respect unto all thy
[1:02:38] commandments
[1:02:40] when i respect a due respect which
[1:02:43] implies hearty affection diligent study
[1:02:47] and constant practice to all
[1:02:50] so not as to allow myself in any known
[1:02:53] sin or in the
[1:02:54] in neglect of any known duty
[1:02:59] that was uh
[1:03:02] oh
[1:03:04] the six age messenger
[1:03:08] forgot his name also
[1:03:11] but that was his description of that
[1:03:13] and to all all the known duty the things
[1:03:16] i know to put to pay pay attention to do
[1:03:20] it
[1:03:23] and that's david speaking here
[1:03:25] then i shall not be ashamed when i have
[1:03:27] respect unto all thy commandments i will
[1:03:31] praise you with uprightness of heart
[1:03:33] when i shall have learned thy righteous
[1:03:35] judgments
[1:03:37] i will keep thy statutes oh forsake me
[1:03:41] not
[1:03:42] utterly
[1:03:44] and then he asks in verse 9
[1:03:46] wherewithal shall a young man cleanse
[1:03:48] his way
[1:03:50] by taking heed thereunt to according to
[1:03:54] thy word
[1:03:57] even in the old testament there was a
[1:03:59] reference to the word of god the law of
[1:04:01] god continually
[1:04:03] because there is only one way and that's
[1:04:05] god's way
[1:04:08] every other way leads to destruction
[1:04:11] god's way is eternal life
[1:04:15] then he says in verse 10
[1:04:18] with my whole heart have i sought thee
[1:04:22] oh let me not wander from thy
[1:04:24] commandments
[1:04:26] again i say whole
[1:04:28] if you're doing it with the whole heart
[1:04:30] there's not room for anything else
[1:04:32] you've given it all
[1:04:34] you've given him everything
[1:04:38] and then in verse 11 this is this one of
[1:04:40] the scripture thy word have i hid in my
[1:04:42] heart
[1:04:44] that i might not sin against thee
[1:04:47] blessed art thou o lord teach me thy
[1:04:50] statutes
[1:04:53] if you want to be taught you should go
[1:04:54] to the class every day
[1:04:58] you don't you don't get your degree
[1:05:01] by skipping most of the classes
[1:05:03] by borrowing the notes from somebody
[1:05:05] else
[1:05:08] the tudor
[1:05:10] said i'll be with you even in you to the
[1:05:12] end of the world
[1:05:15] even in you
[1:05:17] that way he goes with you everywhere you
[1:05:19] go
[1:05:23] brother branham says the first
[1:05:26] couple of quotes here will read
[1:05:35] from the mess of the arrow of god's
[1:05:36] deliverance shot from a bow
[1:05:44] now you know no matter how mysterious it
[1:05:46] seems
[1:05:47] god always keeps his word no matter how
[1:05:51] unreasonable it may seem to people god
[1:05:54] keeps his word
[1:05:56] and if god makes a promise of anything
[1:05:58] god will keep that promise
[1:06:02] you and i
[1:06:03] make a promise
[1:06:04] and we break it
[1:06:06] because we don't mean to have to do it
[1:06:08] but sometimes circumstances cause us to
[1:06:11] do it
[1:06:12] but when god being infinite he knows all
[1:06:15] the future from the beginning he can't
[1:06:18] and he can't he don't make a promise
[1:06:20] less he knows what's going to happen
[1:06:23] and he always keeps his promise
[1:06:26] and here i like this part sometimes it
[1:06:28] seems like it's ridiculous the way he
[1:06:30] would go around about to keep his
[1:06:32] promise but god always does it
[1:06:38] he's an unfailing god
[1:06:41] there is no fail in him
[1:06:45] jehovah jireh
[1:06:47] number two
[1:06:52] he says
[1:06:53] notice he appeared to him where he was
[1:06:55] 99 years old and he appeared to him in
[1:06:57] the name of almighty god
[1:07:00] the name there in the hebrew is el
[1:07:02] shaddai now god has seven compound
[1:07:05] redemptive names we know that
[1:07:08] and i like this and you cannot separate
[1:07:10] them from christ
[1:07:11] you can't separate them christ meant
[1:07:14] every one of those compound redemptive
[1:07:16] names you believe that
[1:07:18] amen he
[1:07:19] he do you believe he is jehovah jireh
[1:07:22] the lord's provided sacrifice
[1:07:24] then what about jehovah rapha the lord
[1:07:27] heals all thy diseases and if that
[1:07:30] wasn't applied to christ then he wasn't
[1:07:32] jehovah jireh
[1:07:33] you see so you can't separate it the
[1:07:36] whole thing is wound up and there you
[1:07:38] are he can't be jehovah rapha without
[1:07:40] being jehovah right
[1:07:42] jaira neither can he be jehovah jair
[1:07:44] without being jehovah rapha he was
[1:07:47] wounded for our transgressions with his
[1:07:49] stripes we were healed there is no
[1:07:52] argument about that
[1:07:56] he's everything
[1:07:58] he's everything
[1:08:00] he hasn't missed on one
[1:08:03] from the message faith in action
[1:08:10] i'm not a speed reader there brother man
[1:08:14] jesus said it is written
[1:08:16] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:08:19] every word that proceedeth out of the
[1:08:21] mouth of god
[1:08:23] that's where his faith was anchored so
[1:08:26] if his faith was anchored on that then
[1:08:28] our faith has to be anchored on that
[1:08:30] he says
[1:08:32] that's where his faith was anchored
[1:08:34] there's there's where every man and
[1:08:36] woman's faith to be anchored tonight is
[1:08:38] upon the living word of god you believe
[1:08:40] that and you can put it into action
[1:08:46] now
[1:08:47] but but but we we got to be careful we
[1:08:49] don't put that word that those promises
[1:08:53] in
[1:08:53] the pastor
[1:08:55] just in the prophet or just in this
[1:08:58] preacher or this just it's you've got to
[1:09:00] believe it's in you
[1:09:04] you read the word you hear the word it's
[1:09:07] why you you ingest the word so it
[1:09:09] becomes part of you
[1:09:12] till the point is that you become part
[1:09:13] of it
[1:09:15] it has the preeminence in your life
[1:09:18] does that mean i walk around down the
[1:09:20] street just quoting scriptures no it's a
[1:09:22] lived life
[1:09:25] lived according to the word of god
[1:09:29] the the scripture tells us this jesus
[1:09:31] obeyed his parents
[1:09:33] he humbled himself
[1:09:35] he respected he learned
[1:09:37] the bible says by the things he went
[1:09:39] through
[1:09:41] when he was helping his dad in the
[1:09:43] carpenter shop
[1:09:45] joseph would tell him this is what we do
[1:09:47] first this is what we do second this is
[1:09:48] how we do that this is how we prepare
[1:09:50] that he learned he listened
[1:09:54] my son-in-law amos and them they're
[1:09:56] doing addition to their house and
[1:10:01] he had asher four years old using the
[1:10:04] driver drill tightening up all the bolts
[1:10:07] where he'd anchored it to the floor
[1:10:10] you've never seen a happier bow in your
[1:10:11] life
[1:10:12] he was getting to use daddy's tools in
[1:10:14] helping him
[1:10:17] there's a peace there's a joy there's a
[1:10:20] happiness in your life when you let do
[1:10:23] the things that god has you doing
[1:10:28] you know to realize that jehovah god
[1:10:30] almighty god the creators of heaven and
[1:10:33] earth the all-powerful one wants you to
[1:10:36] take place in part of it
[1:10:39] you're not just in an audience you're
[1:10:40] just not watching him perform you're
[1:10:42] part of it
[1:10:48] christianity versus
[1:10:51] idolatry
[1:10:55] oh my i'm so glad of that aren't you
[1:10:58] aren't you glad to be one of them
[1:11:00] just one of them one of them humble
[1:11:02] people that just emptied yourself down
[1:11:05] out come down
[1:11:06] not be for an idol before a living god
[1:11:09] not before in an organization to put
[1:11:11] your name in the book before a living
[1:11:13] god not to recite a creed
[1:11:16] but to let the word become flesh in you
[1:11:21] that was his whole desire when he tell
[1:11:23] the disciples are disappointed because
[1:11:25] he's going away and they're trying to
[1:11:26] tell them don't do it don't do it
[1:11:27] they're you know we don't want you to
[1:11:29] leave
[1:11:31] we expect the rest of our whole life to
[1:11:33] be with you and he says i've got a
[1:11:35] better way
[1:11:38] there's something that i must do
[1:11:40] because he was looking past those 12 and
[1:11:43] he was seeing you in there
[1:11:46] he was looking down through time and he
[1:11:48] was seeing your name that was written in
[1:11:50] the book
[1:11:51] and he said i've got to get to them also
[1:11:54] i've got to perform i've got to go
[1:11:55] through what i've got to go through in
[1:11:57] order for
[1:11:59] all this to take place and he said i
[1:12:00] have a better way i'm going to go away
[1:12:03] but i'm going to come back and i'm going
[1:12:04] to live in you
[1:12:07] they didn't understand that
[1:12:10] sometimes i don't understand it i say
[1:12:12] why lord
[1:12:13] what have i done to deserve it
[1:12:16] but the part of me says even so
[1:12:18] be it unto me according to thy word
[1:12:22] imagine mary
[1:12:24] think about mary
[1:12:26] an angel comes to visit her
[1:12:29] and tells her you're going to have a
[1:12:30] child
[1:12:31] and this child
[1:12:34] shall be god
[1:12:37] how would you how would you feel if you
[1:12:38] got told that today
[1:12:40] you're going to have god
[1:12:43] what me
[1:12:45] yes you
[1:12:48] it's christ in you the hope of glory
[1:12:51] and let me just ask it's christ in you
[1:12:53] the hope of glory for others too
[1:12:56] it's not just for you to tabernacle and
[1:12:58] walk around say he's my god and mine
[1:12:59] alone it's for you to be an example to
[1:13:02] other to share this life to others
[1:13:05] mary had jesus he was born her and then
[1:13:08] he was he was born of her but it wasn't
[1:13:10] just for her
[1:13:13] it was for all of
[1:13:16] us he says not to recite a creed
[1:13:21] oh that's catholic oh no that's right in
[1:13:24] this message
[1:13:26] if you don't believe it this way if you
[1:13:28] don't see it this way if you don't
[1:13:29] understand this way you don't have it
[1:13:32] that's it's not a creed it's a living
[1:13:34] word
[1:13:41] the spoken word is the original seed
[1:13:46] so believers of the word and spirit so
[1:13:48] believers of the word and spirit must be
[1:13:50] one you get it
[1:13:52] believers the word and the spirit are
[1:13:55] absolutely one you don't do your own
[1:13:57] thinking you don't use your own mind
[1:14:00] isn't that wonderful it is
[1:14:03] when i can turn this off and let his
[1:14:04] word speak
[1:14:07] the mind
[1:14:09] the mind was in christ is in you see the
[1:14:12] mind is in christ and you'll take the
[1:14:15] word just like he did because he was the
[1:14:17] word and the mind of christ in you you
[1:14:20] are the word
[1:14:22] you're god's living word representatives
[1:14:25] of him here on earth that's right
[1:14:27] continuing the work the church should be
[1:14:29] that way and when so the bible is
[1:14:32] manifested again like in the early days
[1:14:34] of the disciples just like the disciples
[1:14:36] the bible is living again in you
[1:14:41] where is god today
[1:14:45] where is god today
[1:14:49] ah some of you
[1:14:51] come on he's in me he's in you
[1:14:54] i didn't make those words up i didn't
[1:14:57] dream him up last night this is
[1:14:58] something god had a prophet tell us
[1:15:01] because it's scriptural
[1:15:05] christ in us the hope of glory the bible
[1:15:07] says
[1:15:12] what hope do you have without him
[1:15:15] none
[1:15:18] you could study
[1:15:19] you could work hard
[1:15:21] you could work on this that the other
[1:15:23] but what hope do you have
[1:15:26] it's christ in you the hope of glory
[1:15:30] and and how do you receive him
[1:15:34] how do you receive that christ in you
[1:15:37] is there a magic formula
[1:15:40] a
[1:15:40] specific church to intend to a certain
[1:15:43] ministry to sit under
[1:15:45] no
[1:15:47] there's acts 2 38 in the scriptures
[1:15:51] repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:15:53] the lord jesus christ
[1:15:54] for the remission of your sins and ye
[1:15:56] shall be filled with the holy ghost
[1:16:00] the holy ghost is god in you
[1:16:02] and he how do you know because your
[1:16:04] actions begin to show
[1:16:06] what you're living who you are
[1:16:09] i've always said this people tell me i
[1:16:11] look like my father
[1:16:12] and i say thank you that's a compliment
[1:16:16] it's a compliment to my mother also
[1:16:18] because if i look like somebody else
[1:16:20] there would be a question
[1:16:23] i don't mean that to be mean but it
[1:16:24] would be true
[1:16:26] you don't look like your family you
[1:16:28] don't look like the rest of your family
[1:16:31] then there's a question where are you
[1:16:32] from
[1:16:35] but if i have this traits of my father
[1:16:37] and my mother there is no question
[1:16:39] you're just like your father you're just
[1:16:41] like your mother
[1:16:44] you know when we were part of the
[1:16:45] pentecostal church people said oh you're
[1:16:47] an apostolic
[1:16:49] you're a upc you're a baptist you're
[1:16:52] whatever you came from
[1:16:54] nothing wrong with that they're good
[1:16:56] people wonderful people
[1:16:58] but what about when they say you're a
[1:17:00] christian
[1:17:04] then
[1:17:04] your life is manifesting who christ
[1:17:09] you know when we were part of the
[1:17:10] pentecost church that we went to there
[1:17:12] were certain things that we did that
[1:17:13] that pentecostal church said
[1:17:17] in the the spanish uh because we went to
[1:17:19] the spanish
[1:17:20] speaking church
[1:17:22] and their standard greeting was pas de
[1:17:24] cristo the peace of god
[1:17:28] so any minister any brother that stood
[1:17:30] up behind the pulpit the first thing he
[1:17:32] said was pas de cristo or peace of god
[1:17:34] that was the standard greeting you knew
[1:17:37] you were an apostolic
[1:17:41] but not all apostolics acted like
[1:17:43] apostolics
[1:17:44] but if they said that you were
[1:17:46] considered an apostolic
[1:17:51] what are the message words that we say
[1:17:53] the people oh you must be a message
[1:17:54] believer
[1:17:59] sometimes sometimes it's just old
[1:18:00] tradition
[1:18:03] well he can quote this message and he
[1:18:05] can quote that i've been with this
[1:18:06] church i've been to part of that and
[1:18:09] and i've been to tucson i've been to
[1:18:10] sabino i've gone here i've gone there
[1:18:12] i've done that or you must be a message
[1:18:14] believer
[1:18:16] what about the christ in you
[1:18:19] that speaks louder than anything like
[1:18:21] that
[1:18:25] the christ in you
[1:18:26] that causes you to behave certain ways
[1:18:29] act certain ways
[1:18:30] dress yourself in certain manner a
[1:18:33] reputation that people look and they say
[1:18:35] oh
[1:18:36] satan goes hard against it
[1:18:40] in your job at school and everywhere
[1:18:42] they'll make fun of you they'll do it
[1:18:44] but there's something about it that's
[1:18:46] speaking out at them
[1:18:49] i tell you about that young lady she was
[1:18:51] pentecostal that we were in school
[1:18:52] together and she always wore a long
[1:18:55] sleeve
[1:18:56] and even in the summer she had long
[1:18:58] sleeve sweater
[1:19:00] and there was five or six of us sitting
[1:19:02] in the in the
[1:19:03] school office there in the
[1:19:05] we were
[1:19:07] teachers helpers because it was an easy
[1:19:09] class to get an easy grade on
[1:19:11] and
[1:19:12] the office and would send one of you to
[1:19:14] take this note to this teacher please
[1:19:16] and we're all sitting there
[1:19:18] and one a couple of the other girls
[1:19:20] asked her why do you always wear long
[1:19:22] sleeve
[1:19:24] and i said oh boy i'm going to get to
[1:19:27] hear her testimony because she was
[1:19:28] always in a dress and always in long
[1:19:30] sleep
[1:19:31] i'm going to get to hear her testimony
[1:19:33] and she kind of went
[1:19:35] um i'm always cold
[1:19:38] and it's 110 degrees outside and you're
[1:19:40] always cold
[1:19:42] you know
[1:19:43] and then it says i'm on she goes
[1:19:45] and i'll just say what she said i have
[1:19:47] very hairy
[1:19:48] arms and i'm starting to get embarrassed
[1:19:51] for her
[1:19:53] and she finally turns around and says
[1:19:55] it's because i believe in modesty
[1:19:58] and then she looks at me he goes you
[1:20:00] never thought i was going to say it did
[1:20:01] you
[1:20:03] i just wanted to hear what were you
[1:20:06] going to say
[1:20:08] why would we be embarrassed
[1:20:11] jesus paid it all
[1:20:13] he did everything i had needed he went
[1:20:15] to death in hell for me why would i be
[1:20:18] embarrassed of him
[1:20:22] let's go on to the next scriptures there
[1:20:24] brother matt
[1:20:27] i'm going to try to hurry up here so we
[1:20:29] have time for the baptism and
[1:20:32] psalms 107 here oh give thanks unto the
[1:20:35] lord for he is good
[1:20:37] for his mercy and dearth forever
[1:20:41] let the redeemed of the lord say so
[1:20:44] let the redeemed of the lord say so amen
[1:20:47] you know
[1:20:48] for his mercy and earth
[1:20:51] whom he hath redeemed from the hand of
[1:20:54] the enemy
[1:20:56] he has redeemed he has drawn you back he
[1:20:58] has called you back because you were his
[1:20:59] in the first place
[1:21:03] and gathered them out of the lands from
[1:21:05] the east and from the west and from the
[1:21:07] north and from the south they wandered
[1:21:09] in the wilderness in a solitary way they
[1:21:11] found no city to dwell in
[1:21:16] hungry and thirsty their soul fainted in
[1:21:18] them
[1:21:19] then they cried unto the lord in their
[1:21:21] trouble and he delivered them
[1:21:23] out of their distresses
[1:21:26] you ever there
[1:21:29] oh lord i need your help
[1:21:32] i've i've tried every way i've gone this
[1:21:34] way i've gone that way i've tried this i
[1:21:36] i went through this program my
[1:21:38] one brother and sister and their best
[1:21:40] intention told me to drive this way went
[1:21:42] over to this place and they told me to
[1:21:44] drink this and i've done everything but
[1:21:47] turn to you lord
[1:21:49] yesterday we were out and
[1:21:52] my wife one of her co-workers her
[1:21:54] daughter has a like a health shop and we
[1:21:56] were passing by so she wanted to go go
[1:21:59] see what they had there
[1:22:01] and they gave her his drink with aloe in
[1:22:04] it and stuff
[1:22:06] and there was just different people in
[1:22:07] there drinking these different mixtures
[1:22:10] because they're good for you
[1:22:12] and there's no question that they are
[1:22:13] good for you
[1:22:15] she finally convinced me to start taking
[1:22:16] better care of myself
[1:22:18] and you feel a whole lot better
[1:22:20] and and just to
[1:22:23] but they're dependent on that
[1:22:26] if i take good care of my body if i
[1:22:28] exercise if i do this i'll be okay
[1:22:32] i'm not saying not to do that
[1:22:34] but that's not where you're dependent on
[1:22:36] it
[1:22:37] you're dependent on this one here
[1:22:39] he says
[1:22:40] then they cried unto the lord in their
[1:22:42] trouble and he delivered them out of
[1:22:45] their distresses
[1:22:47] and he led them forth by the right way
[1:22:49] again there's one way and it's his way
[1:22:52] and that that they might go to a city of
[1:22:55] habitation
[1:22:57] looking for a city whose builder and
[1:22:59] maker is god amen
[1:23:03] oh that man would praise the lord for
[1:23:05] his goodness
[1:23:06] and for his wonderful works to the
[1:23:09] children of men for he satisfieth a
[1:23:11] longing soul and filleth the hungry soul
[1:23:14] with goodness
[1:23:17] he satisfied the longing soul what is
[1:23:20] your desire what are you longing for
[1:23:24] seek ye first
[1:23:26] the kingdom of god
[1:23:28] and all these things shall be added unto
[1:23:30] you
[1:23:32] we've flipped it around too many times
[1:23:34] i'm going to seek all of this and if i
[1:23:35] got a little bit of left over time i'll
[1:23:38] dedicate it to god
[1:23:41] when he said seek ye first the kingdom
[1:23:44] of god
[1:23:45] and all these things shall be added unto
[1:23:47] you
[1:23:49] how many times who was it um i might i
[1:23:52] believe it was moody or one of the
[1:23:54] messengers that said if i don't get up
[1:23:56] and pray for four hours in the morning i
[1:23:58] find i don't have enough time the rest
[1:23:59] day to get everything done
[1:24:03] most of us don't do that
[1:24:05] we get up we go to work
[1:24:07] and at the end of the day lord i'm sorry
[1:24:09] i got this five minutes for you
[1:24:12] and he said if i don't spend four hours
[1:24:14] of prayer in the morning i don't have
[1:24:15] enough time the rest day to get what it
[1:24:17] must get done
[1:24:20] i find myself with a lot of driving time
[1:24:22] now and i found myself with a lot of
[1:24:23] prayer time

[1:24:29] road lord

[1:24:38] and he tells you you're his owner
[1:24:43] let's continue on the scripture there
[1:24:52] such as sit in darkness and in the
[1:24:54] shadow of death being bound affliction
[1:24:56] and iron sometimes that's where we felt
[1:24:58] we are
[1:25:00] but he delivereth them all
[1:25:03] this is david's writing you imagine
[1:25:05] sometimes how david felt about himself
[1:25:07] sometimes
[1:25:08] the things that he did
[1:25:11] a man
[1:25:12] who's
[1:25:14] who was after
[1:25:15] the the heart of god a man who who
[1:25:17] desired that
[1:25:19] yet david did some things in the
[1:25:20] scriptures that he writes about and we
[1:25:21] say
[1:25:23] but he was a man after god's own heart
[1:25:28] and gone honored and respected
[1:25:31] brother branham said this as quick as
[1:25:32] you can brother greenwood
[1:25:34] make it right
[1:25:36] make it right
[1:25:38] as quick as you can
[1:25:42] you know when you when you have a late
[1:25:44] fine
[1:25:46] anybody else ever had one of those were
[1:25:47] you a little bit late on something
[1:25:49] there's a few of you
[1:25:50] along with me
[1:25:53] and then you go back and and you know if
[1:25:54] you had paid it the day after you knew
[1:25:56] it was late and you had just yielded
[1:25:58] another dollar
[1:26:00] i'll get to it tomorrow i'll get to
[1:26:01] tomorrow i'll get to it tomorrow
[1:26:03] and tomorrow never comes
[1:26:05] and so suddenly that late fine is almost
[1:26:07] a double payment
[1:26:12] the burden that you begin to carry
[1:26:16] the weight of it
[1:26:17] the heaviness because you won't stop for
[1:26:19] a moment say i'm sorry lord
[1:26:24] as quick as you can make it right
[1:26:27] and the joy that comes from that the
[1:26:30] peace that comes from
[1:26:38] i'm sorry brother matt somewhere another
[1:26:40] i seem to have lost the next page of
[1:26:42] scriptures here so
[1:26:49] ah they got stuck in the back here
[1:26:54] and verses 20
[1:26:56] and 21 he sent his word
[1:26:59] and healed them
[1:27:01] and delivered them from their
[1:27:02] destructions
[1:27:05] he didn't send another angel
[1:27:07] he didn't send somebody in his place
[1:27:12] he didn't send mary
[1:27:15] he sent his word and he healed them and
[1:27:19] delivered them from their destruction
[1:27:20] and then david says and o that man would
[1:27:23] praise the lord for his goodness
[1:27:26] and for his wonderful works to the
[1:27:28] children of men
[1:27:32] why where would we be without him
[1:27:37] the word of god becoming flesh in us
[1:27:41] as mary
[1:27:46] said be it unto me according to thy word
[1:27:52] it had never happened before
[1:27:55] it had never happened before
[1:27:58] two great miracles in the bringing forth
[1:28:00] of a man child
[1:28:02] abraham and sarah
[1:28:06] 19 90 and 100 years old
[1:28:08] a promised son
[1:28:11] brother branham talks about abraham when
[1:28:13] he gets a promise making the
[1:28:15] preparations even sarah making the
[1:28:17] preparations but a year goes by two
[1:28:19] years go by three years go by
[1:28:22] hebrews 11 says they stagger not at the
[1:28:24] promise of god
[1:28:26] through unbelief
[1:28:31] but i wonder if some of those other
[1:28:32] conversations would have been recorded
[1:28:35] and abraham
[1:28:37] his mind is going a little bit and says
[1:28:39] was that really god
[1:28:41] or did i imagine that
[1:28:46] sarah how are you feeling today
[1:28:49] no different
[1:28:51] but today is my birthday
[1:28:53] and i'm another year older
[1:28:56] i thought maybe it would be last year
[1:28:59] well i was younger and still could have
[1:29:01] done it
[1:29:03] but i'm 80 years old now abraham
[1:29:06] i know and he says i'm 90.
[1:29:10] but god said he's going to give us a
[1:29:12] child
[1:29:18] what about you and your promises from
[1:29:19] god
[1:29:22] i'm the lord god that healeth all thy
[1:29:24] diseases
[1:29:27] is there anything impossible for god
[1:29:32] but i've been waiting 25 years it's been
[1:29:35] 50 years it's been whatever
[1:29:37] he's still god
[1:29:40] and one day he comes to visit them the
[1:29:42] promise had been given 25 years earlier
[1:29:45] and he comes to visit him
[1:29:47] he literally comes himself to visit them
[1:29:51] he didn't send somebody else he came
[1:29:53] himself
[1:29:56] and in your deepest hour of distress
[1:29:57] he'll come and visit you
[1:30:00] he knows where you live he knows you by
[1:30:02] name
[1:30:04] he's been there before he's walked down
[1:30:06] that street
[1:30:08] he's been in that hospital he's been in
[1:30:10] that sick bed
[1:30:12] he knows
[1:30:16] and he says abraham
[1:30:18] i built this time same time next year
[1:30:22] you'll be having that promised son
[1:30:26] and sarah laughed in her heart
[1:30:28] and god heard it
[1:30:32] he's laughed in our heart but he heard
[1:30:33] it
[1:30:34] he said why did sarah laugh
[1:30:36] sarah says i did i didn't yes you did
[1:30:40] he said but you're still going to have
[1:30:41] that child why
[1:30:43] because she was part of abraham
[1:30:48] you and i have laughed a time or two
[1:30:52] because but because you are part of
[1:30:54] christ
[1:30:56] and he took all your blame
[1:30:59] and he hung at calvary and he took your
[1:31:02] shame it's not held against you
[1:31:06] you're still going to produce god
[1:31:09] you're still going to have that child
[1:31:12] you're still going to be the word made
[1:31:14] flesh in this hour
[1:31:19] can you say amen to that promise
[1:31:22] let it be accorded unto me according to
[1:31:24] thy word oh lord
[1:31:27] now what does that mean we're going to
[1:31:28] be reciting scripture all day we're
[1:31:30] going to no it's going to be a lived
[1:31:32] life
[1:31:34] such as i have i given to you in the
[1:31:37] name of jesus christ here's peter here's
[1:31:40] john
[1:31:42] now god himself dwelling in them not
[1:31:44] just walking with them
[1:31:46] but dwelling in them
[1:31:48] and they realized he's god in us
[1:31:52] therefore and brother branham if you
[1:31:54] follow through on this thing i was
[1:31:55] looking at you could probably bring a
[1:31:57] hundred different quotes with this he
[1:31:59] said what does it become it becomes a
[1:32:00] spoken word
[1:32:03] as moses when he told him speak and
[1:32:04] create the flies when he told moses why
[1:32:07] cry speak
[1:32:09] he said it hasn't changed
[1:32:12] speak to the storm i'm having fellowship
[1:32:14] with you say to this mountain and it
[1:32:17] shall be moved
[1:32:19] that's god's word
[1:32:22] so here comes john and here comes peter
[1:32:24] and they're coming over they're headed
[1:32:25] back to church that day
[1:32:28] the holy ghost had come upon him and
[1:32:30] acts 2 38 experience
[1:32:32] and when they got up that morning they
[1:32:34] said well now that we got the holy ghost
[1:32:36] we don't have to go to church no
[1:32:38] more hey i've got god in me
[1:32:41] why do i need to be in church no they
[1:32:43] got up and they were going to go worship
[1:32:44] in the temple
[1:32:46] and on their way there was a man
[1:32:48] deformed or sick
[1:32:51] and and he asked for money he asked for
[1:32:53] for some help financial help to help him
[1:32:55] go through
[1:32:56] and and john and i've always said john
[1:32:58] and peter just because they had received
[1:33:01] the holy ghost didn't mean they had more
[1:33:02] money in their pocket
[1:33:06] but they now had the one that owns a
[1:33:08] cattle in a thousand hills
[1:33:10] every vein of silver and every ounce of
[1:33:12] gold are his
[1:33:14] and they said such as i have i give unto
[1:33:17] you in the name of lord jesus christ
[1:33:19] rise up and walk
[1:33:21] and that man got up and leaped up
[1:33:24] why because it's christ in them
[1:33:27] they were becoming the word made flesh
[1:33:30] the very same things that jesus did now
[1:33:32] his disciples are doing
[1:33:35] not because they could do it but because
[1:33:36] christ is in them
[1:33:40] oh yeah but but brother you don't know
[1:33:42] me you don't know my troubles you don't
[1:33:44] know what i did yesterday you know what
[1:33:45] i said
[1:33:48] look at peter
[1:33:49] look at the record of peter
[1:33:51] i'll never deny you fact i'll go
[1:33:54] up on that cross with you
[1:33:56] and he turned i said you're going to
[1:33:57] deny me three times
[1:34:00] but then look at jesus response when
[1:34:02] he's after he's resurrected and he tells
[1:34:04] them go tell my disciples to meet me
[1:34:07] over here and peter too
[1:34:10] oh for the mercy and the grace of god
[1:34:15] such as i am i give unto you in the name
[1:34:19] of jesus christ rise up and walk
[1:34:24] oh but they were holy men no they were
[1:34:26] men who god was dwelling in now
[1:34:31] did it make them perfect
[1:34:34] no because in acts you remember that
[1:34:35] peter and paul went at it i mean uh yeah
[1:34:38] peter and paul went out a little bit out
[1:34:39] there
[1:34:41] paul and silas ended up being together
[1:34:43] because there was such a dispute between
[1:34:45] them and barnabas they couldn't go
[1:34:46] together
[1:34:49] here read that in the scripture there
[1:34:53] now that the holy ghost is filming me
[1:34:55] i'll never i'll never suffer i'll never
[1:34:56] have no
[1:34:58] you're still human
[1:35:00] but you have that anchoring power that
[1:35:02] life in you now
[1:35:04] and as you surrender your life his life
[1:35:06] begins to manifest himself
[1:35:09] brother branham would stand before a
[1:35:11] congregation of people
[1:35:14] he would say
[1:35:15] after many many experiences he had over
[1:35:17] the years he would say you know what i'm
[1:35:20] waiting for because without him i'm
[1:35:23] helpless
[1:35:26] you would think that after 20 years he
[1:35:28] could have said well i i don't need him
[1:35:30] i know how to no he realized that
[1:35:32] without him he couldn't do it
[1:35:35] then he would say i take every spirit
[1:35:38] under my control
[1:35:40] was that brother branham speaking as a
[1:35:42] man no that was god in him
[1:35:45] the same god that's in you
[1:35:48] you walk into a situation you walk into
[1:35:50] a place and the spirits have got to
[1:35:52] become subject to the god that's in you
[1:35:59] some of you are having a little trouble
[1:36:00] believing that
[1:36:02] but it's christ he's never changed and
[1:36:04] he's living in you
[1:36:07] he walked this earth
[1:36:10] and when he would come into a situation
[1:36:13] he would say peace be still
[1:36:18] when the storm came and he stood up on
[1:36:20] the bow of the boat and he said peace be
[1:36:21] still
[1:36:23] it's the same one living in you
[1:36:28] little fishy i give you back your life
[1:36:36] it was for brother animali no it's for
[1:36:38] all his children
[1:36:40] he was the first fruits
[1:36:42] to show that there would be a ripening
[1:36:43] there would be a group of people that
[1:36:45] would take his word and believe it
[1:36:47] and become it
[1:36:53] she's going to be
[1:36:54] like him
[1:36:56] because it's going to be him and her
[1:36:59] when adam and eve see eve came out of
[1:37:01] the sight of adam
[1:37:04] she was part of adam
[1:37:07] she was a feminine part of adam
[1:37:12] their natures were the same
[1:37:16] they were created of the same
[1:37:20] allowed that
[1:37:22] and i'll never understand this but i
[1:37:23] appreciate it
[1:37:25] that he allowed a fall
[1:37:28] so he could demonstrate who he is
[1:37:31] so that he could be touched by the
[1:37:32] feeling of our infirmities
[1:37:34] so that he would understand because he
[1:37:36] was a savior he was he was a keeper he
[1:37:39] was a he was strength he was joy he was
[1:37:41] peace but how could he demonstrate it
[1:37:43] unless somebody needed peace
[1:37:45] somebody needed joy somebody needed
[1:37:47] healing
[1:37:51] you may be somebody's peace today
[1:37:56] you may be somebody's joy today
[1:38:00] you may give somebody their healing
[1:38:01] today because that's in you
[1:38:04] to give
[1:38:08] just the scripture even talks about
[1:38:09] giving a cup of water
[1:38:11] a cold cup of water
[1:38:18] too many times we think becoming
[1:38:21] the the word becoming flesh
[1:38:24] that we're going to stand up and we're
[1:38:25] going to be we're going to be the
[1:38:26] preachers we're going to be you know
[1:38:28] it's a daily lived life
[1:38:32] at your job
[1:38:34] in your neighborhood
[1:38:35] wherever you're at with your own family
[1:38:38] a live life
[1:38:41] that would make someone stop and say
[1:38:45] how do i get that what you have
[1:38:48] how can you be at peace in such a
[1:38:49] situation
[1:38:52] i don't understand it because it's a
[1:38:54] piece of god that passes all
[1:38:55] understanding
[1:39:00] i've had that happen people have asked
[1:39:02] me
[1:39:03] how can you be calm in a situation like
[1:39:05] this
[1:39:06] because i know that within myself i
[1:39:08] can't control it
[1:39:10] but i know the one that's in me who has
[1:39:13] control over that situation
[1:39:16] and he said if i would let him he would
[1:39:18] have control
[1:39:22] my wife is is
[1:39:24] getting ready to retire
[1:39:27] i think she's down to a couple more
[1:39:28] weeks and she's done
[1:39:30] and they had a retirement party
[1:39:32] well not a retirement party they had a
[1:39:35] meeting and they honored those that are
[1:39:36] retiring this year
[1:39:38] and they spoke very well of her
[1:39:41] i'm not surprised
[1:39:43] i know her
[1:39:45] i know the kind of lady she is i know
[1:39:47] the christian she is
[1:39:50] but they're already asking her if she
[1:39:52] can come back and sub because they're
[1:39:54] going to miss her
[1:39:57] i'm not surprised again i know i know
[1:39:59] the work god has done in her life
[1:40:01] and it should be each one of us like
[1:40:03] that there should be something about it
[1:40:05] no i understand the jealousy i
[1:40:07] understand satan coming hard against it
[1:40:09] but there's something about a lived life
[1:40:11] that reaches out to others
[1:40:16] one more quote there
[1:40:19] the last quote i believe we had one more
[1:40:20] brother man
[1:40:24] i wanted to say that one for last
[1:40:28] faith in action jesus said it is written
[1:40:31] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:40:33] every word that preceded by the mouth of
[1:40:35] god
[1:40:36] that's where his faith was anchored
[1:40:39] that's where every man and woman's faith
[1:40:42] to be anchored tonight is upon the
[1:40:44] living word of god you believe that you
[1:40:47] can put it in action
[1:40:51] you can put it in action
[1:40:57] he didn't say
[1:40:58] the pastor can put in it the preacher he
[1:41:00] says you can put it in action brother
[1:41:03] joe when you're by yourself at ups
[1:41:05] working
[1:41:07] and there's no minister there with you
[1:41:08] and there's no pastor there with you but
[1:41:11] god is with you
[1:41:13] you can put it into action
[1:41:18] there's a reason why you're there in
[1:41:20] that situation have you ever thought of
[1:41:22] that
[1:41:23] why am i here in the middle of this
[1:41:26] because christ is in you going to reach
[1:41:28] out to somebody else
[1:41:30] if we'll let him
[1:41:34] brother ed you're going to be able to do
[1:41:36] the baptism
[1:41:39] if if we'll prepare for that
[1:41:42] and one of the boys
[1:41:43] brother max if you want to go with him
[1:41:45] also
[1:41:49] and the musicians would come
[1:41:54] christ in us the hope of glory
[1:41:57] but i want to step just a little further
[1:41:59] christ in us the hope of glory for
[1:42:02] others
[1:42:07] sometimes that's hard to understand and
[1:42:09] hard to believe
[1:42:12] but if he could speak life to a little
[1:42:14] fish
[1:42:16] how much more would a soul mean
[1:42:23] how much more a word that you could give
[1:42:26] to
[1:42:26] someone that would change their whole
[1:42:28] life
[1:42:31] in your work in your school wherever in
[1:42:33] your neighborhood wherever it might be
[1:42:35] to someone we come to says
[1:42:37] how can i have that peace that joy
[1:42:41] in the situation you just went through
[1:42:43] but you're still standing how can i have
[1:42:45] that
[1:42:47] and you could say like peter and john
[1:42:49] such as i have i give unto you
[1:42:53] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:42:54] receive that which you have need of
[1:43:01] asparagus
[1:43:04] [Music]
[1:43:06] lord it's hard for us to believe that
[1:43:11] we see ourselves
[1:43:15] and we see our humanity
[1:43:18] and we know sometimes the thoughts that
[1:43:19] go through our head
[1:43:22] and sometimes our actions
[1:43:26] we can read in the scriptures
[1:43:29] how david felt at times
[1:43:33] there in the scripture when
[1:43:36] isaiah said oh i'm a man of unclean lips
[1:43:40] think of gideon hiding behind the wall
[1:43:44] hiding behind his little place in his
[1:43:45] threshing floor because
[1:43:47] the enemy kept coming back over and over
[1:43:52] to take away the
[1:43:54] the food and all lord
[1:43:58] we get to looking at those things
[1:44:01] and wondering how
[1:44:03] how could this god live in me
[1:44:06] how could i manifest that part lord we
[1:44:09] look at ourselves
[1:44:12] but let us look to you let us look to
[1:44:13] what the word of god says
[1:44:16] we've confessed our sin we've made
[1:44:18] things right we've done everything
[1:44:19] you've asked us to do lord
[1:44:22] therefore let your word be born in the
[1:44:24] manger of our hearts
[1:44:29] so be it unto me according to thy word
[1:44:31] lord
[1:44:33] a people of god
[1:44:35] a chosen generation a royal priesthood
[1:44:39] [Music]
[1:44:42] lord let it be today i pray in jesus
[1:44:44] name
[1:44:48] let your
[1:44:50] word be born
[1:44:53] in the manger
[1:45:00] let it
[1:45:02] [Music]
[1:45:10] live inside this house
[1:45:14] [Music]
[1:45:27] in the main
[1:45:30] of
[1:45:32] the first verse
[1:45:39] [Music]
[1:45:50] a place
[1:45:58] [Music]
[1:46:08] so i know
[1:46:16] [Music]
[1:46:24] in
[1:46:25] [Music]
[1:46:39] live inside this house
[1:46:46] [Music]
[1:47:04] just one more time about your head
[1:47:09] you have something maybe you're
[1:47:10] struggling with
[1:47:11] [Music]
[1:47:13] maybe uh i don't know what it is
[1:47:16] but it's something that battles you
[1:47:18] every time you want to let god have his
[1:47:19] way
[1:47:21] something that maybe steps in and
[1:47:22] interferes there
[1:47:24] [Music]
[1:47:26] you're saying lord i want deliverance
[1:47:28] from that
[1:47:29] [Music]
[1:47:31] maybe it's a habit
[1:47:33] maybe it's a thought
[1:47:34] pattern maybe something you may need to
[1:47:37] make right
[1:47:39] and it doesn't allow god to have that
[1:47:41] full control of your life and you would
[1:47:42] say lord i want some help
[1:47:45] today
[1:47:47] i want to be able to let go of that be
[1:47:49] delivered of it set it free make it
[1:47:50] right whatever it takes lord
[1:47:54] i don't have my eyes open and i'm not
[1:47:56] looking out over the congregation but
[1:47:57] i'm asking the same thing lord help me
[1:48:01] lord you know every heart here and every
[1:48:03] person here whatever it is that they're
[1:48:05] battling with whatever it is that
[1:48:07] that interferes with a full
[1:48:08] manifestation manifestation of god in us
[1:48:13] or whatever it is that we need to do to
[1:48:15] make it right to do to let it go
[1:48:17] whatever it is lord would you help us
[1:48:18] would be we willing to say here
[1:48:21] i give it all and let the word of god be
[1:48:24] born in my heart lord you see each heart
[1:48:25] it sees life here
