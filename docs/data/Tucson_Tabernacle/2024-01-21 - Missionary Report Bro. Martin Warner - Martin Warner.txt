got up opens his Bible as notes and he begins to minister and for five minutes he did good I think you know the rest of the story now but he got lost in his notes and he literally stood there for about 5 minutes without saying a word and one of the deacons came up closed his Bible got his notes and walked him out the door so I was hoping that wasn't about to happen but appreciate the goodness of God don't you he deserves the glory amen we have a couple of song specials so brother Josiah and sister kadia did you know he had a song special good cuz I got you on the list here brother Dan said you did so sister Katie if you want to come up how many appreciated what brother Dan did this morning you know I i' I've stood behind the pope and brother martin will be here and a few Brothers Min it's not an easy thing if if you're doing something that that you feel God has placed in your heart there's a a battle a constant battle to be able to get up here and deliver it because Satan knows lives are going to get changed he's going to get exposed and he battles it but I believe God gave us Victory this this morning and and I appreciate it very much amen if you have the lyrics to no longer slaves doesn't have to be a special you all you all should sing with us [Music] you unravel me with a melody and you surround me with a song of deliverance from my eny enemies till all my fears

brother Ed is supposed to sing a song special and then he said I have to help him it's all course before we start I get a little mo motivational things on my phone and one that popped up recently was as we worship God and give him glory he does mighty works on our behalf amen we are here to worship God yes to praise him for all that he's done scripture says Make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord and that's what I'm going to do tonight just make a Joyful [Music] Noise if I can help somebody as I pass along if I can cheer somebody with a word or a song If I can show somebody they traving wrong then my living shall not be in vain then my living shall not be in vain no my living shall not be in vain if I can help somebody as I pass along then my living shall not be in vain if I can do my duties as

this morning about how big the universe is and the the sand and and you know how he he shared that with me and as I was sitting there there was a A Chorus that that came into my heart and it's how big is God how big and vast his mighty Universe I believe they have the [Music] songs how big is God how big and wide is vast Dom to try to tell these lips can only St he's beging us to rule his mighty Universe yet small enough to live within my heart how big is God how big and wide his b to try to tell these lips can only St he's begging her to rule his mighty Universe yet small enough to live let's sing it one more time how big is God how big and white his fast man to try to tell these lips can only St he's big enough to rule his mighty [Music] universe that is a that's an amazing statement you know he's big enough to create the the universe and then yet small enough to live in my heart thank God we have our brother martin War tonight but before Brother Martin comes to the to the uh platform I want to share a testimony 6 eight months ago I don't remember how long it was we had a service it was an evening service I was I believe it was a Wednesday or Sunday I can't remember which one it was but it was an evening service and uh a man stumbled in here he was [Music] um Wayward off in his directional life and um wanting to uh wanting to get into rehab and we had our service and the spirit was here in the evening and I remember it was really strong many of you are here I called up brother Lionel Salazar and uh brother Paul m Murray came up and a lot of brothers came up and they prayed with a brother and and the brother stayed and he was weeping and and just praising the Lord and he made this statement to me he says brother he says he says i' want to go to church every day in this church he said he said this is just a special place and and as he was before he said that he was praying and he was uh sister Katie is about in a row that you are maybe one row forward and he was down on his knees between the pews and I came up from behind him and he was thanking the lord and he said these words he said Lord fill up these pews and he was talking about how how thankful he was for the church and um then after that I gave the testimony we had within a within two weeks it was we had six 00 people in this little church well it's a big church but in in in this church there were 600 people there were so many people up in the in the upper um balcony up there that the that the pews broke and and and there was just there's people lined up we have chairs in the in the highways and I thought you know that one brother that came in here that night I believe it was the Lord speaking to him he didn't I was there he was knelt down between the pews and prayed that and I witnessed it and the Lord did it I believe as i' talk been talking about prayer over the past month and how when we enter into praying that we don't even know it's us when we really enter enter into that spirit and it just becomes a holy spirit then speaking through us as we go before the Lord and as we pray and then the brother he uh didn't see him for a long time and uh God bless you brother Felton raise your hand here he [Applause] is he was gone for a while he went up to Phoenix and now he's going to sojourn with us for for a little while here at the Tabernacle brother Felton you're always welcome God bless you my friend and I I really appreciated the the sincerity of his prayer and when I walked up so often we spend most of our time praying for ourselves but this brother he was in Dire Straits he he needed something in life but he was taking his time in that Pew and he was praying for all of us and brother Felton we over twice the size now that is when you prayed that prayer our normal our normal congregation so so greet brother felon before before uh before he leaves this evening we have the honor tonight of hearing from a true missionary I've been overseas many times and I've uh I've never done missionary work what I've done is is gone over and and do the business and make sure that uh the offices or or the the recipients were getting their information getting their material but someone who really goes overseas and really sleeps in the places that you wouldn't want to sleep and goes to the places that you wouldn't want to go that's a true missionary so Brother Martin Warner as I said before it's an honor to have you and we look forward to hearing what the Lord's been doing through your ministry especially in Africa but also in different other parts of the world I think Europe also God bless you brother [Applause] Mark amen amen God bless you can you hear me okay yes am I loud enough let's try that it's okay I'll go through half the service that's that's pretty good without the that's not bad I believe that's all the singing will do uh I was glad brother Aaron sang that Amazing Grace it was on my heart to sing it tonight so you sang it and uh I just you know some songs like that when you realize the inspiration behind them that I think it was was it John Newton that wrote that song John Newton and and he was a he was a slave trader and he was on a ship in a storm and God got a hold of him and uh he gave his heart to the Lord and he said oh the grace that saved a Wretch like Me and then he for the rest of his life he fought against slavery and he abolished it in the UK amen so those Inspirations come from from Deep deep spiritual uh experiences amen that we we sing them and we don't realize uh what's behind them but uh I'm I'm glad you're saying that tonight uh I want to just get into the word tonight right away let's take our Bibles uh to um turn to Ephesians I greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and uh bring your greetings again uh like I said Wednesday from Canada the different churches there maybe there's there's some new faces here I haven't seen before so uh I don't I don't think I need to say a lot I just uh about myself I do Mission work overseas and uh I've been doing Mission work probably for about 30 years or more and I started up in the Alaska among the eskimos and with the Indians uh up in the northern tribes of of Canada and uh right down into the jungles of the Congo so uh God has God has been gracious to allow me I've was privileged to do that amen he saved a Wretch like Me you know to to allow me to do something for him that is a privilege and and uh it's a privilege to address you tonight it's a privilege to be in Tucson uh we had a lot of Trials we have a lot of hindrances coming and we had a lot of storms we came through on the roads and different things you know it just seemed the enemy was trying to hinder us so I know there's something good is going to happen amen you know I I tell the brother sometimes I get the feeling that that Satan doesn't like me you ever get that feeling you know he's just throwing everything in your way I get this feeling amen so he he doesn't like it like brother a said he he knows he's going to be exposed amen so let's let's just uh go to the Lord and prayer before we read the word once more Lord we come again like Samson oh once more Lord come again Lord Jesus like you did this morning your presence and father the spirit of God moving Among Us dealing with our hearts and our lives Lord and changing us oh God transforming us Lord Jesus transform us tonight Lord and use me as a tool tonight Lord Jesus and we'll give you all the glory and the praise and the honor in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen Ephesians chapter 4 and uh uh I think they're going to put it up there uh or you don't have to put it up there you could put the PowerPoint up if you want uh unless does everyone have their Bible here [Laughter] tonight we heard that from our pastor this morning amen so we uh I I you know a preacher always has his Bible but you know we get so used to the electronics it just kind of takes it away from us but it was a good reminder this morning I am I am very old school I am very old school I believe in this good old Bible amen and I like brother Daniel said I love to read it and Mark it and just have those words jump out on the paper into my soul amen and so uh I was going to say just before we read uh you know there was I think it's Ezekiel chapter 36 I was in the I was in Eastern Africa and we were in a small village with a a roof that was just some poles and you know branches and poles and and it started to rain and boy you know it was so primitive and uh you know so it was coming in Dripping and dripping and and I had my Bible open and I was trying to avoid the the drips and it got on my Bible where I was taking my text from Ezekiel 36 and uh that I will sprinkle clean water upon you you wow amen and and and in my Bible That's all roughed up there you can feel the roughness of it when it dried and I just I just I honor that I just put my hand on that you know and I just feel it sometimes and I remember that day amen and we had a wonderful service and the the the Chief came out the chief of the village came out and we we just had a wonderful service and we put a roof on that church and they don't have to sit in the rain anymore they don't have have to feed their babies and rain come on them amen amen and you are a part of that you are all a part of that and you won't know that until eternity unfolds it amen so let's uh let's read did I say Ephesians chapter 4 yeah I'm just I'm just getting all the butterflies lined up here uh you know it's been a while since I spoke like I said I I just had a hip replacement I mean if you had have seen me three two months ago on crutches and on a cane you would have thought I was an old old man I'm old but I'm not that old but uh you know I just uh thank God for his grace you know I want to testify this morning when we were singing something or you know uh the songs that were sung by the way that was just wonderful this morning wasn't it the worship amen and there are musician and the songs that were sung it was just awesome Amen it just just just amazing and as they were singing this song uh about heal you know I raise my hands and I'm Healed in his presence and I just I just raised my hands and I was just thinking about that and you know I know I I had a hip replacement but I was in a lot of pain and uh I still was in a lot of pain after the operation anyone had one of those before there you go brother brother at the back and you just and you know what it's like it's you know it's you got to fight your way through the pain and you know you take some painkillers and kind of dull in it a little bit and but you know this morning I haven't taken anything God and this is the first day that I haven't taken anything and and I I feel great I told my wife I I feel great like I had a lot of pain here but I feel great amen so to God be the glory amen amen let's get to our text Ephesians a couple places I want to read Ephesians 4:11 and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting and we know that word there means maturing right we're perfect by his sacrifice we're perfect by the life that was shed on the blood but the maturing comes through the gifts in the church for the perfecting of the maturing of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ that we hence henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the slight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceived now watch this last verse but speaking the truth in love we heard about that this morning in love man May grow up into into him in all things which is the head even Christ that's what we want to do is grow up we're not kids anymore we're not playing church anymore that time is over amen we're we're waiting for a body change now just any day now amen we got to be expecting that body change amen um Revelations chapter chapter one I believe it is let's go to Revelations chapter 2 I'm sorry verse one Revelations 2 verse one and unto the angel of the Church of Ephesus write these things saith he that holdeth the Seven Stars in his right hand and and walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks I Know Thy works and thy labor and thy patience and how thou canot bear them which are evil and thou Hast tried them which say they are Apostles and are not and has found them Liars amen Satan is a liar how do you know when he's lying when he opens his mouth right here he whispers in your ear that's when you know it's not the word you know it's him he's lying one more scriptures in Psalms uh chapter 116 this is a a scripture that's dear to my heart in the last in the last few months of of Trials um David speaking here in the spirit how many know the prophet said the Psalms were inspired you know he also said that the Psalms are prophecy singing is prophecy you are prophesying and then someone will get a hold of that and be inspired amen and it can deliver someone my it's amazing so I verse n of chapter 116 I will walk before the Lord in the land of the living I believed therefore have I spoken I was greatly Afflicted I said in my Hast all men are liars what shall I Render unto the Lord for all his benefits towards me I will take the the cup of Salvation and call upon his the name of the Lord I will pay my vows unto the Lord now in the presence of all his people precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his Saints we heard that this morning didn't we it's a it's it's a glorious wonderful time Heaven's receiving them we're we sorrow we sorrow but not like others oh Lord truly I am am thy servant I am thy servant and the son of thy handmate thou Hast loosed my bonds I will offer to thee the sacrifice of Thanksgiving and will call upon the name of the Lord I will pay my vows unto the Lord now and in the presence of all his people in the courts of the Lord's House and in the midst of the old Jerusalem praise ye the Lord you may be seated may the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of his word amen um I want to put that PowerPoint up I just want to those scriptures I'd like to tie them into this uh report and it'll be a little different report I'm not speaking I was thinking about speaking on Mosen Beek and the flood relief there that we did for the Believers they still really haven't recovered in some areas and I know that different churches have helped and voice of God has helped different ones have helped but you know that the impact of those things is years they don't recover like we would recover have the government come in and build you houses and things like that but anyway I just felt led to go this way uh to uh Europe when I was I was there in Europe in July and August and uh I was doing some some camps there and uh it turned out I you know I realized that what the prophet said was true that he said America needs missionaries yes wow that's the truth America I mean I'm over there I see the supernatural I see see the faith of the people I see error but I also see the faith that they have and the Simplicity they have to manifest the word and I think you know we are we are the ones that need missionaries amen and a missionary is the New Testament the prophet said it's it's really scriptural it's apostle he said denomination changed it to missionary he said but it's really Apostle and Apostle is someone that's sent that's sent and he said to set in order and I think you know sometimes we need that here and I and I think sometimes churches are afraid of that churches are afraid of that and I and I couldn't figure out why but on this last mission trip it just seemed to all conal together where we're at we need all the ministry we need them all and the pastor you know the story the short stubby one the strong one he can work with all the rest right but you know it we need them all and so tonight I'll try to get into this and we'll try to get through this power point real quick this Eagle is there because he's my friend and I go to a special place on the river to pray in in Edmonton and it's a secret little place and he sits there all the time every time I'm there mostly he's there but now he's now he flew self like me he's a real he's a real Snowbird is he yeah he's a real Snowbird but he is massive he he is massive I don't know if you can see his claws but when his wings go up man I just like wow he is one massive eagle and uh you know the Lord the Lord I I used him as a fleece to come down here and he answered my fleece so he's precious to me he may be around here somewhere amen uh I don't know if I should use the pointer um can you do it yeah why don't you do it brother go ahead uh we were in U in July August we were in C in Berlin Germany and uh had some a lot of churches come together there and I took three of those meetings in Germany and we had a wonderful time it seemed like that the Lord spoke to the Y the youth and I don't know why because I was never a youth guy I was never a youth pastor or youth oriented but it just seemed like the youth were reaching out and that's a wonderful thing you know in mission mission work to see the youth coming up the new generation amen they're the ones that are going to carry this gospel amen and and to see their hunger and their thirst and I preached on a few things like that were a little controversial like music and and uh a little bit of church order things like that and it just Stires everything up and man do you ever get bombarded with questions after that you know and what is right what is wrong and you know I always deflect brother Daniel to the pastor because I say you know ultimately it's the pastor's responsibility I'll go out and say something it'll create a lot of stir and questions and people start searching the message they start searching the word and that's good amen But ultimately it is the pastor's responsibility so a few of those things came up and we had a good time uh regardless I enjoyed those meetings I shared them with brother yasik wallik from Poland and uh he took he took the last three I took the first three and then I I was supposed to go to Slovakia after that next slide uh these are young people in in Berlin just on a day outing we had uh next slide yeah so we went from there to the the Slovakia there was another Camp there just back to back and I expected to take one or two Services brother Daniel and uh I was prepared for that because I just came through these meetings in Berlin and uh so it's a beautiful place and the camp was just just a wonderful old very old but you know and and outdated the building but you know it's nothing for a missionary you know there was no bed bugs there was no rats running above you in the room there was no rats hats there was no mice there was no bed bugs praise the Lord amen this is the this is a five star they said it was only a one star but I I thought it was a five star anyway uh next slide yeah it was nestled in this little area here in Slovakia and we had a camp there and there was quite a few came together there in that camp and we uh you know I I I asked him I saidwell you know I was getting tired and I asked him well you know you got some brothers here and he' he'd have them get up before the service and say a few things the ministers but he he said you know brother martin as the first weekend I took the weekend and he said what you've been preaching and it's been really zoning in on a lot of different things here that you don't know anything about a lot of different uh doctrines and Revelations and you know special things that I didn't know anything about but the Holy Spirit was hitting them and he said would you continue well I had limped I had brother Aon I had literally limped to to to these meetings I I fought through the pain and I limp to Europe and I limped they had be climbing these mountains and I said Brothers you don't know like we're just going to go on a day outing we'll drive this hill and yeah you got to walk another mile and a half up to the top to get the view right so wow it was something but uh you know all in all it just seemed like that's the way it went so I had to take I had to I took all of the meetings for the whole week there was five or so meetings five days and uh so by the time that was done I was spent and you know it it just seemed like something came through to me that you know there was a lot of these things uh like I said you know the Paul said one has a Doctrine one has a Psalm one has a revelation one has this one has that and all these special interests you know and I thought what are we reflecting you know in in message churches what are we reflecting are we reflecting our our own Doctrine we go to seed on one Doctrine and if you know like I I I touched on the millennial Doctrine and I said you know just I wasn't thinking about it very much but I said you know people think we're in the Millennium right now and uh I've heard that preached in message circles and I think you got to come to with me to Africa you got to come and get that Lion in your face that lion that's right there you know and and and just feel the Roar of that lion and your blood just thickens it just you wouldn't feel a thing if they if they caught you you wouldn't feel a thing you're you're paralyzed before that even gets to you like before he even gets to you so uh I said they got to come to Africa because if we're in the Millennium where's my Rapture you know and I just kind of just hit on a few things like that and boy you could just feel it you know you could feel it and and you you're just running into that that kind of that uneasiness under the under the current thing that you don't know why and you're fighting things and you don't know why and and then later you realize what it was so that's part I'm saying that because it's part of mission work you know Mission work is not just it's not just handing out books or printing ing books or sending CDs or you know I I had a brother one time he was talking about that and he said you know we got this and I won't mention the names but we got this venue now and you know you won't have to have missionaries going to these countries that you just send them this and they got all the messages no he God still needs this he needs Flesh and Blood yeah that that's his program you can never change it amen a book won't take that place a tape won't take that place I'm for missionary work I mean I'm for we're printing now in Malawi the message in their own country and they're they're they're setting up now uh was just talking them the other day they're setting up uh sound booths so that they can overvoice like was done in the earlier years but they they only got a quarter still in Malawi it's only a quarter of the messages we got them all all amen we got we got them all on our phones right at our fingertips but they would like to hear it they would like to hear the rest of the story amen it's nice to have the whole thing isn't it so anyway uh we uh we ran into that and I thought you know what is uh maybe next slide as some young people in Slovakia next slide Slovakia uh this brother here I'll just stop there for a sec this brother in the center the tall one he was in the meetings and he' just come from the Ukraine and uh it was you know he had he had somehow got out at his age and uh you know didn't have to he was in a bad area and he was wanting to bring the message there and he asked me and these two young men also knew Ukrainian and Slovakian they could speak and English so they interpreted for me and his desire was to get the message out in Ukraine Amen to go back and get the message out in the Ukraine and go on the street and and and and witness the message and I thought wow you know what a great what a great desire for young men like this and it encourages an older man that we've been around for a long time and you see this this youth amen and this vibrancy and this fervor and you know they they they said Brother Martin just pray with us just pray with us that God will use us my I said that's easy that's easy to do I just prayed with all my heart we had a nice nice time with him and you know it comes to your mind if it comes to your mind pray for missionaries pray for people that are on the field pray for people that are risking their lives next slide uh we went to Poland after yeah it was wasn't over yet I thought it was over but then uh I did schedule a meeting with brother yasek uh in Poland in his church and uh uh you know it's funny because I found some of the same things there and not not Downing any church it's just you know there's two Spirits working in the framework of the Christian church and like brother Daniel said this morning we got to be aware there's demons there's demons and religious Dem demons and there's Angels amen so you know uh we went from there to uh next slide that's the pastor and his wife there brother Jack he's shared meetings with me in in Africa and he's doing a lot of missionary work he's doing a lot of printing English books around the continent of Africa he's helping a lot he's done a great work next slide uh this is the church we went from Brother Jack to Walla Petrova that's a small uh Village sort of small small village community um I'm not sure the direction in in Poland but it's quite a wayss it's about a 5H hour drive from Brother Jack so there's five hours there and five hours back and meetings all the time so after two camps and all those meetings you know everything was taken out the people were just pulling and you know that's what operate you operate the gift and when you get people under expectation and pulling amen God can meet needs amen God can God can do miraculous things so we saw some of that there um we were in this church that Community they're all message Believers in that community in that Village there's one Pentecostal church and they know the message very well they just don't see the message but uh you know they're all just wonderful Christians and they get along well together but the whole Community they they run uh they run cows and milk cows and stuff and you know that's how they survive and they all work on on that in that farm and it's just like it's just amazing you know they're just kind of insulated from everything else he said you know the one guy was saying that Co didn't even affect them never affected them at all it was like it never happened you know he just said some of the people that delivered stuff they stopped coming you know but they just went on as as usual they just stopped coming but uh you know it was it was real eye opener to get up there I've been my wife and I have been there before and uh you know this time was a little special this time uh next slide yeah that's uh one of the Pastors in the the new church that was just built John silik uh and and a lot of older Believers there too next slide yeah um the brother interpreting there for me uh is a young man and I think God's got a call on his life for Mission work and uh he he wants to he wants to go along to Africa too so it was a good connection next slide that's the pastor of that church brother uh snan Peter snan his wife just passed away and uh I really wanted to make it there to encourage him he's an old soldier in the gospel and uh he's a fire brand he's a fiery fiery preacher and he just even at you know in his 80s he's just he's just a fireball and I'm thinking man you know if he can do that what can I do you know I'm not that old yet so uh he encourages me I encourage him next slide yeah and these are some of the older books that they showed me that you know was were past the first message books that came in into Poland and and German some in Germany were handwritten out and then they they' pass them to someone else and someone else would read them and they' you know Mark it up and then someone else would read it and it was passed around and we got them all on the phone and that was so precious to them one message book was so precious to them to read so we I think we take it for granted and we're all guilty I'm guilty I get back home and I I I get in the swing of things again and I just sometimes just for get so that's why you have to continue to get out there so you don't lose that burden amen and I think uh yeah that's another one there they were showing me in their language and really inspiring um I think that's that's that's we'll just stop there for a second I just wanted to comment now is that slide 16 yeah thanks brother Jeremy so we find you know the many doctrines Revelations like I said just things that you know don't some of them don't really matter you know like uh one church was a vaccine Church another church was a non-vaccine church so and in the message and one Church well that's the mark of the beast no the mark of the beast the prophet said is to reject the Seal of God the Holy Ghost that's the mark of the beast it's not a vaccine amen but you know know you got to go between them and you got to stand in the Gap and you got to be all things to all men sometimes and you know even if they don't listen to you you still got to love them you still got to love them and pray for them and be and show brotherly kindness amen so that's that's that's that's the part of a a missionary and uh you know I wouldn't trade what God's having me to do for for a pastor's job I would and trade it for the world no I it just go you're built a certain way that you can stand in in between and a pastor is built that he can take the burdens of the people and have the patience and I don't have the patience I'm F I'm just a fiery you know I'm just uh brother brother Ernie knows yeah you just asked brother Ernie you know it just sometimes it just doesn't come out nice it doesn't come out gentle and uh it just how God anoints you right because like I was telling brother AR this is my favorite thing you know Jesus we want to be like Jesus we want to act like Jesus but sometimes Jesus one time the prophet said he had compassion and he and he and he braided a whip yeah he braided a whip and he said and the prophet said he took the part of a deacon and he was just quietly braiding that Whip and all of a sudden Wham he just whipped those people out of the temple that were making the house of God a house of merchandise amen he he he played the part of a deacon and I I would have like to see that fight I would have like to see that day when he did that go get him boy sick him amen you know I just thought wow there's gentle Jesus with a whip in his hand sometimes compassion it looks it can be hard hard to look at Compassion is not sympathy it's not sympathizing with our human weaknesses God didn't sympathize with Moses he gave them all the excuses but then God said no more excuses I built you for this hallelujah we're built for this age Saints we're built to overcome we're built to stand in Satan's face and call him a liar amen you heard that this morning I love that I love that kind of thing you know he's a liar and he's and he's lied long enough so you know you see all these things and whether it's you know the mark of the beast or the Millennium or Thunders or return Ministry or polygamy in the message still in Africa yeah you know I'm I'm being a little blunt but I I'm not eloquent you know and you can't be eloquent with this and brother Jack Wallock from Poland he he helped me out there in in uh some of the countries there and where that was being preached and and that influence was trying to spread itself boy did he he ever he's militant he's very militant so it he got the point across and sometimes that's what it is it's a whip you can't be gentle sometimes with those things yes there's wisdom and there's timing but you know you have to say it like it is and you're not after you're not trying to influence people and win friends in the message if you stay with the word people will people some people will be against you but you got to bring it anyhow so we are associated with all of those things uh whether we like it or not you know that's the way I look at it because you know like the prophet said to be an American you have to be associated with all that America is all of her shame slavery all of her shame all of those things that you know that were shameful or you know that we identified we're still identified with it in the message we're identified I'm still identified with these people I still want to identify with them and win them if I can amen so it doesn't mean we have to compromise amen it doesn't mean we have to compromise with it we've got the message we've got the word for the hour we've got the truth and we just look at it in the right way amen and come together and reason together see so uh we had a Minister's meeting after this Slovakia and uh in the Slovakian meetings and uh although there was different things there uh we the the pastor he took a subject on you know discouragement for ministers and pastors and there was there was quite a few pastors and ministers there we were all in a circle and we had this Minister meeting and you know he said you know what do you Brothers do and it was a really interesting topic and you know there was a lot of nice good feedback coming from each one of the ministers and in total it just the wisdom of God what one didn't have the other had what one perspective was there was another perspective and it just brought a balance in all of it and then the and then among the ministers because there they were a little bit uneasy because sometimes I whatever you know the Lord used me to step on their toes but in that Minister's meeting we all came together and it was unifying and it was just edifying and we left that place with Ling our hearts and hugging one another and praying for one another and you know that's how it should be you know love can conquer all love is the most powerful force and it's and love is bearing with someone when when they're wrong bearing with each other praying for one another when you're when you're wrong you're wrong or they're wrong so that's that's what I see in Mission work that's why I'm saying these things because we need the body of Christ to come in the unity of the faith amen speaking the truth in love grow up into him in all things it's time we grow up amen it's time we grow up in the message amen and uh we're we're into another generation like we're you're preaching here on the Book of Judges and I thought it was so timely with my with uh with my message that the Lord's been dealing with me you know and and I emphasize in these meetings that I thought the reason for all of this there's there's maybe a couple of things one is sometimes people just get out of Step they're not serpent seed they're not you know they might be off on some little thing or see something a different way and the prophet said we'll all always have that but you know uh if if we if we contend for the faith and just feed the people the word amen that will correct the error the word of the hour corrects the error of the hour that's you know it's not us judging the prophet said it's the word that judges it's not you or I judging it's the word that will judge amen so uh you know they I emphasize Iz a couple of things like sometimes you get out of Step oh boy I'd like to like to do a demonstration but I don't think I have enough time I can't see oh there somebody's smiling at me there I think it's brother Daniel come on up brother Daniel come on up I got to do this real quick just uh I gotta watch my time too uh brother Daniel I'm gonna I used to be in a military band yeah did we do this before no no okay first time for everything you're gonna preach tonight and I was going to ask Lydia you want to come up Lydia no she won't come up no all right I won't Force you but you know you're a soldier too such aydia so you know when we're in the youth par and you start off with on your left quick March left left left right left right so you're going to follow me so we're going to lift our left leg first yeah okay let's go up left and your let's go left left that's it left right left that's it left left left right left left left left right left left left left right left okay that he did pretty good didn't he so we're going to try it again now and I'm going to get out a step this time so we'll start with left right left okay left left left right left left left left right left see I'm at of Step left left he's not out of Step but I'm at of Step but sometimes we think the other guy's at a step when we're at a step it's not about us amen so we got to learn this lesson see he's still in step now all I have to do to get back in step is take another step see now I'm back in step and that's what you learn you just take that little step thank you brother you just take that little step you know I'm I'm I'm you know I'm sorry I I was wrong forgive me that's just a little step yeah but it's so hard for us to change to say our thinking the way we were brought up like we heard is wrong or it it wasn't quite right amen so that's that's what you know I think that encouragement to get back in step when I was in that youth band I remember I was the shortest guy in my line I played the you know I played the symbols I was so musically talented brother I'll hold that uh They promoted me from the symbols to the flag and then from the flag to the front man and they gave me a golden hat what a what a I got and and we made a record I made a record with holding the flag anyway I learned something there we learned things in our youth that we don't think we're going to use down the road but every experience we have is for a reason God allows you to go through these things God allows you to be rejected at school among friends things that happen to you God allows that because he's going to use that down the road he's going to use that for Christ all the all the hard things all the bad things that happen so you know I in my in my line I had to keep I had to keep the line straight so I'd yell them get in line stay in line you know and I put my arm out on practice we we could put our arm out you couldn't e it on on on the parades but you could put it in practice you get stay in line you're at a step get back and step and that's all it is sometimes yes am amen it's all it is and and and that goes for a church that goes for individuales amen it's just someone gets out of Step a little bit pray for them the prophet don't gossip about them don't talk about them pray for them and and be kind be kind to them do something for them amen so uh let me see now I got to watch my time I said I'd watch my time uh I have plenty okay I got a little bit more time okay six 16 time five okay I got a little bit of time I got a little bit of time and I'll just I'll just watch my wife's Expressions she's my best critic amen she's a positive one so you know Paul a preser of the Prophet said always don't judge your life by how much power you have to perform Miracles and we don't judge ourselves by how much knowledge we have of the word but always judge yourself look back and take inventory of what kind of fruit that your life is presently now bearing what am I what am I reflecting now our church our Doctrine you know what are if you're not part of us if you don't see it this way what are we reflecting are we reflecting Christ do people see Christ in US amen I told one of the brothers we were fellowshipping the brother from Haiti I think I don't know if he's here what we're talking about and I you know I said you know I emphasize you do the small thing missionary work you do the small things God will give you big things God will give you the spoken word he'll manifest that right supernaturally he'll raise the dead he'll Open the Eyes of blind people amen my lots of things but you know we don't want to do the little things the little things the the little helps the little things in the church amen so these are some of the things that I rehearse and and and just you know encourage the Brethren overseas and you know it doesn't have to be deep doctrinal things you know Paul or John the Apostle when he came back from the aisle of patmas he said Brethren love one another this is the message that you love one another in in first John he also said this is the message that God is light and in him is no Darkness at all this message is pure light not not the light of the Sun purer than that brighter than that he'll be the light in that City and the sun will be outside that's nothing compared to that light and when you get in that light all things are possible amen so we got to realize who we're reflecting and take inventory you know you were talking about uh the Book of Judges here and uh as it relates the mission work that's the time I shared with brother Daniel that's the time we're in now when Joshua had passed off the scene and all the elders that served Joshua that were under Joshua passed off the scene that's the time we're in now all those elders and the Joshua commission they're gone off the scene and now we're in approving time now we come to the Book of Judges which Joshua types Ephesians and judges types leosia when every man did what was right in his own eyes wow that's the time we're at everyone's doing what they all want to do you want to stay home from church stay home from church you don't want to go to church don't go to church do what you want to do do what feels good I'm still in the message my amen that's the time we're living in Saints that's the you know in in that interm in that delay amen and God said I want to prove you that's why he left their enemies and that's why time went on he said I'm going to prove you whether you'll stay with Joshua Joshua types the end time leader isn't that what the prophet said Joshua types the Holy Ghost are you going to stay with what the Holy Ghost gave us or are you going to take your own ideas amen amen amen you can say amen amen you know if you unless you have spiritual laryngitis or your arms are broke has anyone got broken arms today you should raise your hand you should clap amen you should clap for the Lord take those little hands and clap amen the the lord loves seeing that he loves to see you raise your hand remember the first time you raised your hand brother AR in church you remember that what a what a what a victory it was to raise your hand and say I'm praising God I'm thanking God Amen I just thought wow we forget those simple things but it takes Faith to raise your hand takes Faith to say Amen this is not a spectator sport this is a participating everyone has to participate we're not here just to sit on a church a message Pew we're here to participate to put our shoulders to the wheel and the sacrifice of lifting up our hands the sacrifice of worship amen so you know uh and you want to encourage your pastor say Amen to the Worden yeah say Amen that you know you know the story about the dog the dog you know the story about the dog the prophet said when when they're after those cool dogs he just say sick them sick them you say Amen to a preacher you're saying sick them sick them that's what I say to my little dog when he's around the rot Waters he's about this big I say sick them boots sick and he'll go up and he'll go and then look back off it's not the size of the dog in the fight it's the size of the fight in the dog that guy's got some fight in him but you know uh yeah we want to encourage the pastor encourage the ministry you know because it's an age when a time when they can get discouraged discouragement is deadly with ministers you know and and it was like that in The Minister's meeting like one brother said I just feel like quitting there's no change I pour my heart out I do everything I can there's no response and there's no change in the life now that's discouraging that can be discouraging you want to help your pastor participate in spiritual worship amen and most importantly let that word change you that you come in here and you go out of here different like we did this morning I went out different you know the preaching of the word brother Daniel it casts out Devils you don't have to lay hands on the sick or cast out Devils you can I've done it but you know preaching the word can cast out Devils of fear amen and things that holding us down holding us back praise God Amen so you know if you you want to help me say Amen because the Lord knows I need it amen Ephesians was for the perfecting of the maturity of the Saints so glad you know the brothers here it seems like there's such momentum here and I can feel it I've I've been streaming more than you know I've been streaming and i' I've been seeing the momentum building and I think this church is just right for a powerful Revival a sweep of the Holy Ghost the fire of God Amen that you'll see lives transformed and people on fire I mean on fire and setting other people on fire Hallelujah man I think the last time we were here we were preaching and this young sister came to me my wife afterwards and she said you know it was time brother Aaron I was down and we with you and I think uh we were just having such a good time and I I could see a was just kind of just really kind of looser he was really loose and he was like you know anointed and he was just having a good time and he said well why you know why do we need to stop and and the sister came to us after she said you know as as you were holding the service and he said the pillar of fire the fire was going across the altar back and forth back and forth and I could not quit I had such a hard time quitting that I think Aaron was in the same anointing anden so you know that's where we want to get the prophets said they lost Ephesians lost their love for the Holy Ghost meetings wow that's what I want I'm not saying the days past were better but you know what we can have that and more we can have more than that amen and God can speak directly to our lives and to our situations he's the discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart so every you know that's the time we're living in I I just feel the momentum of the spirit here and exactly the time that you know Israel strayed and God had given them judges like we heard you know and God sent Gideon a prophet you notice that our brother referred to it this morning he sent a a prophet an angel and a judge a fivefold Ministry he sent the prophet the angel and he sent a fivefold Ministry for the perfecting of the maturing of the Saints amen so you know it's not so much like I said it's not so much churches stray but they just get out of Step or another reason is there's a lack of the new birth that's what the holy spirit said to me as I meditated on it I thought about this report because I was going to go a different way but the holy spirit said say this there's a lack of the new birth and that that's why you'll see confusion that's why you'll see defeat that's why you'll see a church will not Thrive you know we just don't want to survive another 20 years we want to thrive we want to let's get out of here let's get it done Amen Let let's mean business with God we come here to the house of God judgment begins at the house of the Lord isn't that right and and the scripture said in 1 Corinthians 11 if we judge ourselves we wouldn't be judged with the world and condemned with the world because when we're judged of God then we're chastened of God so when we come to the house of God it's it you know it's to be edified it's to be ministered to but it's also to be corrected if there's no correction sometimes it's not worth very much if there's no correction there's got to be correction amen we all need correction even I need correction amen we all need correction and and sometimes you you're hanging on to something and if you'll just be in the spirit be under expectation have that man speak to me have that man today that Pastor speak to me he doesn't know anything about my trials you know I remember I did that one time with at when I was when I was called to preach and I struggled with it and I thought you know I do not want to preach my family's quiet I'm a reserved person my dad was a man of few words nobody in the family spoke we were C raised Catholics and I said you know get up in front of people wow that's you know I don't I don't want to do that and I ran from it until God got a hold of me and I said finally I said God that tape that I'm listening to that was a sign of the Messiah and I I said if that's true I said God if that's true then have this special speaker coming in today have him tell me have him say that brother martin is a minister didn't know me from anyone but I said if that's true what's on the tape it's true today he's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today forever he can use anyone he could use a donkey he could use an eagle to speak to you amen and I said that and it was brother bcll came in and he related a story about Hungary I think it was and a brother there that was ministering and his name was Martin and he said by the way he said Brother Martin and he pointed right brother martin is a minister I thought is anything too hard for God I thought this will get me out of it if God can't do this then he's not God right and if he's the same God on the tape he's the same God here today h Hallelujah he's the same in your life he knows what you need he knows when you need it he knows how to give it to you amen and we just ought to praise him for it amen and and and Just Surrender ourselves amen so it takes spiritual courage to change and the Book of Judges proved that you know and it and it took them uh like like JEA jepta he was a hero of faith in in judges 11 we read that you read that on on Wednesday night brother Daniel and you know he he rehearsed all the ammonites they said This is Our Land and he rehearsed the whole is history of Israel where they came out of Egypt and they just came down the coast of M to to to the ammonites and the other tribes the other nations and they say can we pass through your land just let us pass and they wouldn't let them pass and then they they attacked them and God gave Israel the victory over them and gave Israel their land and and jeepa stood up and he said what God has given us we will possess we we haven't taken your land this is not your land the land is whoever God gives it to now remember that your land is whoever God whatever God gives you what ever promises that he's given us in this hour amen they're yours how much land do you want do you want your Mountain do you want your victories you want to possess those things amen there he is over there the brother I didn't see you God bless you amen so you know it's up to us God's waiting on us to take our land and possess it like like jeepa he rehearsed the whole thing he saidou God chimus it it's 300 years now since we've been in here if he wanted to give it back to you why isn't he given back to you now you're coming to attack us again the amorites were coming against them and they wanted JEA jeepa to fight for them amen and jeffa just stood up and he was a fighter he was a mighty warrior amen and he he made a vow we heard about that too he made a vow and he said God if you'll give me the victory over the enemy I'll give you the first thing that comes out of my house what was that his only daughter right and in a sense it was a foolish vow because you don't have to vow anything God didn't require that but whatever you vow you got to pay it like he said to D David said I will pay my vows in the presence of the congregation in the presence of the Lord I'll pay my vows in the house of the Lord amen so that that's that's what's happening right now in Israel they're saying this that Israel took their land yes well God gave it to them that's Theirs Whatever God gives you that's yours Footprints are possession wherever your foot Treads if I if I was healed if I could walk before I'll walk in the land of the living David said I'll walk in the land of the living why why did I want to be healed so I could go on the mission field amen so I could go back and preach that's why I wanted to be healed amen I I I could retire I could just sit back now I I think you know really I think I've done enough I could sit back but you know I want to do the devil as much damage I want to destroy and tear down everything he's took from me and from God's people amen and we all got to feel that way we're all missionaries amen so they attacked Israel and that's what they're doing doing now but it's God Who David said uh in the Psalms 24 he said the Earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof the world and they that dwell in therein whose Land Is It Anyway whose Earth is it it's God's Earth and if he gives it to you it's yours amen several other scriptures there see uh but he was anointed and and and to to fulfill that so the scripture says in Genesis one more scripture in Genesis 28 Genesis 28 I don't know if you can pick it up Brothers I don't have it on the slides Genesis 28 verse 10 uh and then you could go back to the slide Genesis what I say 2810 just quickly uh something I wanted to drop in here because it it pertains to Mission work because it's what I see uh 28 8 10 it's what I see happening now no that's the wrong book here it is Jacob went out from berseba and went to towards haran and he lighted upon a certain place and carried there all night because the sun was set and he took stones of that place and put them for his pillows and lay down in the place to sleep and he dreamed a dream and behold a ladder set up on the earth and the top it reached to heaven and behold it angels of God ascending and descending on it I wonder who those angels were I wonder what it looked like to Jacob you know maybe maybe he you know i' like to just this is just me but maybe he saw Paul maybe he saw arus maybe he saw Martin maybe he saw Columba maybe he saw Luther how because their theophanies were built before the foundation of the world God had this this was all done in God's mind before the foundation of the world and Jacob's beholding this see and and it's it's amazing he says and behold the Lord above it stood above it and I the Lord he said I am the Lord God Abraham the father of thy fathers and the god of Israel Isaac and the land wherein thou liest to thee will I give it and to thy seed and thy seed as the D shall be as the dust of the earth not only the sand brother Jordan but the dust that's why there's 300 billion stars in our galaxy alone your seed will like be like the dust of the earth and thou shal spread abroad to the west to the East and to the North and the South and in thee and thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed and behold I am with thee and I will keep thee and all the places wherein thou goest and will bring thee again into this land for I will not leave thee until I have done that which I have spoken unto you God is given him a covenant like he did with Abraham he's making a covenant God is vowing God's made a covenant with us Saints he vowed in this age he's made a covenant with us an unconditional Covenant I will make you a blessing your neighbors are going to be blessed your co-workers are going to be blessed I heard a testimony the other day here about a coworker and and we had one in on our street they she went in for an operation simple operation and and and whatever they did they paralyzed her her whole body was paralyzed and you know I they got her home from the hospital she could hardly walk hardly walk and I I met her and I asked what's your name Victoria and you know and I was going in for a hipop operation so we had a little bit in common and we talked about that and and then you know I said well we're going to pray for you Victoria we're going to pray for you at church and she said thank you very much she said thank you so much you know what she was walking within a month she was going down the street by herself in a month am man I took a picture of her amen so it's going to benefit your neighbors it's going to benefit your co-workers you're going to be a benefit you will be a blessing will make you a blessing whether you like it or not he's going to make you a blessing whether you're stubborn or not he's going to make you a blessing amen so you know I wondered about this because Jacob he said Jacob wak out of his sleep and said surely the Lord is in this place and I knew it not so many times see and he was afraid and said this how Dreadful is this this place this is none other but the house of God and this is the Gate of Heaven now we take this for granted coming to the house of the Lord but this is none other than the house of God this is the Gate of Heaven this is the gate Saints amen and and Paul warned he said don't forsake the assembling of yourselves as the manner of something is even more as you see the day approaching why how can you get into heaven without going through the gate amen how can I get into Sanctuary without coming through the gate this is the gate and we treat it we take it for granted we take church for granted it'll always be here no it won't no iton won't always be here make the most of it now wow so that in that 30 40 days you'll know where to go amen and you know you streamers out there if you're streaming or people that will archive this service you need to be here you need to come here get in your car and come down here you need to be here this is the gate come to the gate amen this is the gate you're going to walk through how can we get to heaven you say it's it's not about church you know it's not about the building it's not about the bricks and the mortar we know that but it's about the house of God this is the house we are the house of the Lord amen and I I I just God has really emphasized that to me that you streamers you need to be here CU you need us and we need you amen we need you here we need the body of Christ we need backsliders we need Sinners amen we need you here and they're out there watching us come on down come on in the water's just fine amen there's enough water to swim in amen there not Waters to the ankles or to the knees it's water to swim in not Luther's day or Wesley or Pentecost there's more amen so let me let me try to wind this down they called it Jacob called it the house of God he said what an awful what a dreadful place in other words an awesome respect for the house of God and and and he said he feared but fear is there the fear we heard about this morning Satan can give us fear but God can give us respect a Godly respect an awesome reverence for this what we have making the most of it pulling on the word amen having our lives and our hearts changed right here transformed where you transformed this morning I just I just went up a rung higher this morning myself amen I just just really enjoyed it and so was you know sometimes the presence of God is a fearful thing it's an awesome presence it's not just blessings you know like joy and dancing and things like that and that's wonderful and we want that but we want more than that we want a we want an awesome respect and an awesome presence in our life that we that we respect God and his word and respect his people respect one another respect our H husbands respect our wives brother brand said I fear my wife some people really fear their wife amen but you know what it's true I I I fear my wife and I I and I Repent I I'm I'm I'm the first one I'm I'm guilty I'm sorry I did it again amen but you got to respect one another amen so little things like that so the church the church as as a whole we got to come back to this gate we got to come back to our Ephesians amen the prophet said there has to be another Ephesians after the opening of the seals right another Ephesians which parallels Joshua that means we're staying with what Joshua said we're not under judgment we're not under the Book of Judges that that that relieves you of all that judgment amen you come to the house of God and you receive correction like oh thank you Lord I needed that I needed that that cha chastisement it's because it's given in love you grow up into him in love in all things see not legalism but love amen so we need to judge ourselves let me let me just let me just say something we were on a we're on a little walk yesterday and uh was it yesterday Marie yesterday my wife this is this is part when God calls a man he call calls his wife just hey so your husband's going to get messages from you sometimes but she said let's go to this park and we went to this park it was called the the The Garden of Gethsemane you know about it ah there's one one only one two two people you got to go there you know we went down there and uh there's these statue es of the Last Supper full size and uh the birth and crucifixion burial of the Lord and the last supper and it's all in white and uh maybe you could put the slides up again there it is a't that beautiful that's right here in your own City huh it's a Concrete it's on Congress exactly that's the street Congress and Bon amen we we got lost we were trying to find it we got lost we went to way to the South and then back and I was getting frustrated and you know how men are and uh and I'm I'm blaming the the the the co-pilot you know the one that's giving me directions so you know we we finally got there and you know it was such a blessing it happened to be closed because they were doing maintenance but we got we went around the fence and we took these pictures my wife took these pictures and I just thought it was such an inspiration you know next slide and it was so well done next slide there he is in the tune so come to find out again my wife looked it up and I forget now if I can get get down here um Felix what was he Felix luro Felix luro he was the one that made all these and and Felix was a young man in in the early 1900s and he he he got drafted here in the United States and they they had him in the battlefields and and trenches of France and uh in that time you know through many battles one of the last battles he was in he he got critically injured and wounded and was dying on that Battlefield in France for us I I really respect the veterans I really do I really my my father my father's father and my uncles were all in the second world war my father was born in Hartford Connecticut he was American and uh they also I had relatives that in Canada and my dad moved up to Canada married my wife my wife my mother and you know I just I just have a respect for that you know I just they they paid for this Freedom when I come from the mission field and I see what's going on and I'm in Europe and I'm in an airport and I see everything that's going on I just feel like screaming out I just feel like preaching the gospel and they probably lock me up said do you know what price was paid for your Liberty and look what you're doing with it look what we're doing with it as a nation as a people we're squandering it we're wasting it we're we're devaluing it amen and they they fought and this young man Felix I don't know he might be 18 19 he was on that Battlefield and the field went silent he was critically injured he was bleeding and dying and usually they left them and he could hear the groans and people dying around him and you know he got desperate and he said Lord God if you will save my life if you will give me another chance I will sculpt that was his gift was sculpting said I'll sculpt sculptures for you about Jesus and you know what God miraculously saved him wow he saved his life someone came along got him out of there and got him to a triage they got him back to America it was in the 30s he later in the 30s after the war was over he found himself drifting and he drifted to Tucson Arizona and when he drifted here it was the depression so you know he was homeless he was a homeless person brother Arnie he was homeless this man was homeless and he had a cardboard box and he lived under the Congress bridge and that's where he lived and he would go down to the river or to the to the wash you call it I don't yeah you call it a wash I call it River but it's a wash and a river right so anyway we were we were walking along that when we found this and we saw all this trash and garbage and saying man why don't they clean this up this this looks terrible you know this why isn't the city doing something about this and then we come across the story of this man and he would go down to the wash and he would pick up old trash like bed springs and stuff and then he'd put them in his his his his models his frames and he made the the last supper table out of bed springs and sand from the river he dug sand you know he was fulfilling his vow he said I vowed and I'm going to fulfill it and no matter how poor I am no matter how bum wrap I get no matter how far I'm pushed down I'm going to do it cuz God did something for me God saved my life amen and you know he he took the trash and everything and he he built these things and then a a businessman from the city here he he saw what was being done and people were coming and and he said you know what I want to help you and so he got a guy that was really good at at cement work and they added cement to the plaster and the sand so it would be take the elements better and that's what you see there you know he had a lot of obstacles he had a lot against him but you know when you make a vow to serve God you you make it you you break it you'll pay for it but you make it you obey it amen you live it don't just come and say I'm a Christian live something else the prophet said right I mean we we will make mistakes we will fall but you get up again you repent you come to church am Meen you get Washed by the Water of the word amen and and get the victory again it's not how many times we fall and I know you're getting TI I I just want to finish with this this little story here because I I just thought about this you know uh the circumstances our circumstances there were nowhere near his circumstances you know he was a homeless person but you know people are homeless it's not the homelessness we see in Lea they don't have he didn't have shelters he didn't have handouts he didn't have food coming to him amen he didn't he didn't stand on the street not nothing against those people but you see what I mean he overcame regardless people helped him or not and people noticed because why because God honored that vow he honored his vow and and it's amazing you know what God can do if we vow a vow and sometimes it takes desperation like Jacob he vowed a vow the scripture said that if you will bless me and return me to my land again I will I will serve you and I will build a house here I will build a house for you here upon that rock that's how he built the church upon the rock of Revelation see Jacob he had that that experience but he wasn't converted yet he still needed to be converted and and it you know in type because like our brother said the Holy Ghost was on them but would go back but in type he needed another step and it wasn't until he faced Esau his his brother in the flesh that he realized hey I've got to pay what I said back there when I left I got to pay my vows and he and Jacob said I'll give you a tenth I'll give you my tithe I'll give you my offerings that's part of our vow to serve God where have you robbed me you've robbed me in tithes and offerings have you robbed me I don't want to be guilty of robbing God I don't want to be guilty of picking God's Pockets amen n it got quiet in the house but it's part of it that's our vow that's part of worship you can't afford not to pay you can't afford it man none of us can even even if it's a little bit amen so you know uh as I was thinking about this in desperation uh I don't know if I had any more slides up um yeah in desperation he's talking about Hannah and I just got it highlighted there she prayed with desperation to have this child what was it God spoke to her no doubt the prophet said you can't be desperate until God speaks to you has God spoken to us amen uh next slide oh maybe go back it's it's the last part of this yeah you can't be desperate until God speaks to you oh Church rise Shake Yourself pinch your conscience wake yourself up in this hour we must be desperate or perish there's coming forth something from the Lord I know it as thus sayeth the Lord there's coming forth something and we better get desperate it's between life and death it'll pass right through us and we won't see it what a solemn warning to us in the message he'd already brought the seals he' already brought the church ages he already brought thus sayeth the Lord there's coming forth something from the Lord it had already been brought we have thus sayeth the Lord we have more than thus sayith the Lord you know Moses had thus sayith the Lord but Joshua said Son stand still we have more than that we have thus sayith the Lord but we have the spoken word and it's up to us to confess it and believe it and accept it and take that land that belongs to us take your land tonight that's what I'm exhorting you to do take your land amen make a vow how many would vow tonight how many would renew your vow tonight you know sometimes it's good for us to as married couple to renew our vows or make a vow not a foolish vow but a vow to serve God a vow to be more desperate about the things of God a vow to be on fire a vow to surrender to live faithful see that desperation that's why the prophet preached the token and then he preached desperation you've got to be desperate to have it amen I remember one time I was desperate and I was a 19-year-old boy in a YMCA dying and I told the Lord I went to hell and God showed me hell and he showed me the fire there is a hell let me tell you there is a hell and it's burning unquenchable fire and darkness at the same time well that would smother you and I said God if you'll get me out of this place I'll change tomorrow give me one more chance like that man on the battlefield give me just another chance Lord you know how many 19y olds will die tonight and you're sitting here we're sitting here oh the service is too long it's too hot it's too cold it's too but let's let let's bear with one another Paul said bear a little bit with me in my Folly just a few more minutes amen you know and I said to God if you'll get me out of there there was a Christian man came to my door and he knocked on my door when I come out of that place I wanted to get back in my body I knew I wasn't there I had to get back in my body I could see it on that bed I had to get back in it but I was separated what is death separation I was under death and when I came to I was so glad to be alive and I said wow that that was more than a dream that was you know that was that was that was God I left this place and that's where I was heading and that's where Satan will take out young lives snuff them out to take them there and that's where they'll end up but for the grace of God there go I amen how we should appreciate and I said that you know when I heard that knock on my door Brother David it was a it was a backslid message believer in the YMCA God can use a backslider God can use anyone and he said can you help me I need to put my stuff somewhere why did he pick on me I just come from hell I just made a promise and he said I said can I help you he says yeah I just need a place to store my stuff and he was a bus driver in the city and why did he come to my room okay so yeah I can help you yeah sure he said oh by the way would you like to come to church he he he didn't tell me about the message he didn't tell me about the prophet he didn't tell me said come to church just come to church and I knew that was God he was proving if I keep my word said I'll change tomorrow and this is tomorrow this is the day of salvation so I said yes I was Catholic I said I'll go maybe I'll the priest will preach a nice sermon and uh I'll feel better in my conscience so I got up there and expected some priest being a Catholic and here was brother Harold hildbrand amen preaching the message here I am with in the front seat brother with my t-shirt yellow t-shirt red words Scotland long hair here I am well I heard the gospel I heard the gospel for with with gloves off amen with gloves off and I I knew that I was a sinner when I left that place I knew I was a sinner I got baptized that night the second service I got baptized I wasn't going to leave any room for the devil say God spoke to me now I wanted to run out of that church because there was a devil on this side saying get out and there was an angel on this side saying this is God you just walked into the Bible you just walked into the presence of God and I could feel it and and brother hilbrand said at the end of the service said uh now does anyone have anything to say here because I've never heard him and he was my pastor for 36 more than 36 38 years I've never heard him say that once since then he said does anyone here have something to say I was on my feet before I knew it speaking saying I'm not worthy of this I'm not like you people all you good holy people here I I'm I'm just I'm off the street I I can't like you guys and I said uh you know I was supposed to get baptized tonight but I'm having second thoughts and he said you know what we don't force anyone to get baptized here we just preach the gospel he said you go with the deacons they'll show you in the scripture and when they showed me in the scripture I knew I'm on the right path amen I'm going through with it I listen to the angel not to the devil not to fear I listen to Faith amen and I overcame that amen and everyone rejected me after that but God received me amen I remember leaving that service going with one of the brothers they were playing a message tape in the truck and it was an old GMC with a three in the tree you know that one some of you older ones know that one yeah they're fun to drive anyway we were going to we were going to build a church they were building a new church in Edmonton and they hired me well I got in in that truck and the tape was playing and the pillar of fire came in that truck glory glory amen it was so milky in that truck I just melted I melted in the seat I was the first revelation I got was I'm lost I'm lost without the Holy Ghost you know the they asked the prophet will our children go in the Rapture if they have the Holy Ghost there's a difference he said between a Believer a Christian a Believer and a holy ghost filled Christian there's a big difference he said so we need to grow up into him in All Things there's a difference between believing in God you ask a homeless person you ask a drunk on the street do you believe in God absolutely absolutely brother oh yeah I believe in God you want to come to church no God say everywhere God's in nature yeah God's in nature but God's God's got a house too God's got a word amen come to the house of the Lord amen we are the house of the Lord oh my and I'm I'm getting along I know but I I'm just relieving myself a little bit it's been three months almost through my operation forgive me but I'm so excited to preach for God again amen and you know I ran out on the street and musicians come come please come now yeah it's over uh you know I ran out onto the street brother Daniel and I was after that Pillar of Fire experience I went I got out of the truck the brother said Brother Martin you got to get out of the truck I got family I got I got I got a supper the wife's waiting you got to get out of the truck I was just like I was I just didn't want to move that presence and I just said you know I just said yeah okay I got out of the truck and then I can still remember the place my experience will be different from yours I'm not preaching experience for truth everyone's will be different but God had something for me to do and I suffered some things for my mistakes and and I have had to pay for that I I had to suffer many things because of that but you know when I got out of that and sometimes it's good to look back you can play anything you feel sometimes it's good to look back to the pit from when you came and I and I I looked up and in my mind's eye I didn't see a vision but in my mind's eye I could see the cross like that white cross that Felix made I could see the cross and I could see him nailed there and I could see my my sin I could see my sin young people God has no grandchildren it's not your parents' experience it's your experience young man it's your experience young lady it's not your parents you got to have a personal revelation of Jesus Christ I'm sorry I'm preaching and not staying but it's Mission work and that's what I see lacking it's a lack of the new birth to mean business with God to get get in his presence and allow him to change us we're all at different stages let him change us as a minister change me Lord as a Believer change me Lord I renew my vows I want to renew my valve tonight how many would do that with me amen you know when I went down when I saw that then it got personal then it then it got personal that was my sin that put him there and he's saying Martin I died for you I died for you brother Joe I died for you if he had to die for one person he'd come and die for you ain't that wonderful isn't he so good God would come for one just 99 and one he'd come for one and he came for me and he came for you he came for all of us I ran out into the street brother Daniel I ran out of the street I jumped up in the air I'm just remembering it now I'm reliving it a young man 19 dying and God saved me God called me I've made stupid mistakes but he called me anyway he knew my faults and saw my need amen and I I ran out the street like Dwight Moody and I said I'm saved I'm saved I'm saved and I jump up in the air I don't want to do it right now I don't want to test it too much I jumped up like like that amen I did it see I was about this high jumping up in the air I'm saved running down the main street of Edmonton the busiest Street in the city and I run up to a man and he's an Asian man a Chinese man or Asian and he said what what was what's happening I said I'm saved Jesus Christ saved me and he said oh praise the Lord Jesus saved me twice Jesus saved you twice I said what do you mean he said I was in the in the war in Asia and he stepped on a mine and it blew his leg off he had one leg and he was standing there with one leg talking to me and he said when I was laying dying he said I asked God if you'll save my life I'll serve you the rest of my life he said then he said I give my heart to the Lord he said and he saved my soul so he said he saved my life and he saved my soul we Rejoice together on that street corner I can still remember we we we rejoiced see we forget where we come from Saints we take salvation for granted we get so educated God help us to be simple we'll get the big things we'll get the doctrine I love Doctrine I love getting into the word but I think we're missing the new birth I think we sometimes at a step but I feel a momentum and things are lining up the order is right see if we get ourselves in order God can then come the prophet said full obedience to the Token to the word of God entitles you to the Token the Holy Ghost how many need the Holy Ghost here how many need a refilling of the Holy Ghost amen we all all do amen if you need that tonight you'd like to make that vow let's stand to our [Music] feet there's something I wanted to read with you here as we close and what are you playing [Music] sister how many are serious about this how many are sincere and serious how many would like to renew a vow that's

love to hear what's going on in different parts of the world and I looked up there and the um the handwritten sermon book that brother martin put up there it's um is this the sign of the end sir was the sermon that was up there I recognized a couple words on on there and I looked it up and thought how important it is brother brandom wanted his message translated and that is something that I know that we've we've done so much with it and messed it up and and changed it and made it about something he didn't want it to be about but there's one thing that he wanted is he wanted it translated and he wanted it sent overseas and that's something that I dedicated my life too it's something that Stephanie and I I I remember I had it in my heart one time to do something but we didn't have the money and it was Christmas time and I remember I talked to the kids and I said how about this year instead of gifts that we just take this money and and we donate it so maybe other people could have this message that we all hold hold so dear neared us and of course the kids were little and they agreed and I I promised the kids I said I promise you that if we do this that the Lord will return these blessings a lot more than what we have given today and not having these gifts it was as I said it was something that I dedicated my life to and I just wish that it would have been something that we could have all gotten together on and gotten behind but with all the division and everything that's around in the world I appreciate what Brother Martin said is that as a missionary you go overseas and you kind of have to walk through the middle of it because there are doctrines on all sides so I do I appreciate that and appreciate well not only brother martin but what the Brethren we're doing overseas and still trying to translate brother bram's message message it's been a blessing to me and my family and I I pray that it will be an equal blessing to all those that get to hear it and I appreciate Brothers like this going over and telling how important it is because it is it's something that it pleases god let's bow our heads Heavenly Father we're grateful Lord that as our brother was telling us that we didn't take it far enough that there's got to be a new [Music] birth Lord that new birth is it's what brother brandom came for it's what the message is for it's it's what your word is for so that we might have that that relationship with Jesus Christ and that we might have that new birth else father would good is anything that we do what good is preaching what good is is witnessing what good is duplicating these sermons translating sermons what good is it if there's no new birth father we pray that all of us here tonight and Lord those that are overseas those that that receive these books these sermons Lord that that they would receive the new birth that they would do what the prophet said and go all the way we thank you Lord for a time of reflection tonight and pray that Lord that this reflection would always be in our hearts Lord these renewing of our vows would constantly be in our lips and as Paul said I I Die daily father may we die to the things of the world and the things of this flesh every day Lord may we give more to you we thank you once again for Brother Martin and the SA sacrifices that he's made the encouragement that he gave us tonight now Lord we take it we do our best to move forward with it in Jesus name [Music] Amen Brother Martin and brother Ed asked us first us to sing that song that it might affect somebody else's life had no idea what you we going to preach tonight did you know brother Ed no brother Ed just said let's sing it then my living here would not be in vain one more time I will serve because I love the you have G
