[35:09] with child of the Holy Ghost then Joseph
[35:11] her husband being a just man and not
[35:13] willing to make her a public example was
[35:15] minded to put her away privately but
[35:17] while he thought on these things behold
[35:18] the angel of the Lord appeared unto him
[35:20] in a dream saying Joseph thou son of
[35:22] David fear not to take unto thee Mary
[35:24] thy wife for that which is conceived in
[35:26] her is of the Holy Ghost
[35:28] and she shall bring forth a son and thou
[35:30] shalt call his name Jesus for he shall
[35:32] save his people from their sins now all
[35:34] this was done that it might be fulfilled
[35:36] which was spoken by the Lord by the
[35:37] prophet saying behold diversion shall be
[35:39] with child and shall bring forth a son
[35:42] and they shall call his name Emanuel
[35:44] which being interpreted is god with us
[35:46] then Joseph being raised from sleep did
[35:48] as the angel of the Lord had bidden him
[35:50] and took unto him his wife and he knew
[35:53] her not till she had brought forth her
[35:54] firstborn son and called his name Jesus
[36:00] [Applause]
[36:09] and Jesus was born in the town of
[36:10] Bethlehem in Judea when King when Herod
[36:13] was King behold there came three wise
[36:17] men from the East to Jerusalem seeking
[36:20] the Messiah
[36:43] where's the newborn king we seen a star
[36:45] in the east we come to worship
[36:53] Him where's the Messiah to be
[36:56] born in Bethlehem as the prophet Micah
[36:59] said
[37:01] so when did the star appear search for
[37:05] the young child tell me when you find
[37:08] him because I also want to worship
[37:13] Him the wise men left King Herod and
[37:15] followed the star to where Jesus and his
[37:18] mother
[37:21] were they fell down and worshiped him
[37:23] and gave him
[37:26] gifts when they they left Jesus they did
[37:28] not return to Jerusalem to tell King
[37:30] Herod because God had warned them not to

[51:19] today I I got a Stephanie and I got a
[51:22] little present for the kids um brother
[51:25] brandom used us to he used to give a
[51:29] candy cane and an orange uh after
[51:32] Christmas service every year at the
[51:34] brandom Tabernacle and uh I don't think
[51:37] in Orange is maybe as coveted today as
[51:39] it used to be so we went ahead and and
[51:42] got the candy
[51:44] cane and uh instead of the orange we got
[51:48] the kids a little Bible and it's got
[51:52] just certain scriptures in it that
[51:54] really tells God's story from the
[51:56] beginning to the end so this is for the
[51:59] the youth and uh we only we only have 60
[52:03] of them so if we could just keep it to
[52:05] the kids it doesn't matter if you
[52:06] identify as a kid you're still not a
[52:10] kid yeah we can get started on that type
[52:13] of thing but but uh yeah for the kids
[52:17] when you leave get your candy cane and
[52:20] your little bible again that's that's
[52:23] from Stephanie and my and me just to
[52:26] tell you tell you we love you there's a
[52:28] there's a legend of a candy cane I'll
[52:31] read it real quick it's it says this the
[52:33] candy cane is not an ordinary treat it
[52:35] holds a Christmas message of love that
[52:37] is oh so sweet the cane reminds me of
[52:40] his Shepherd
[52:42] staff a way provided for eternity on my
[52:46] behalf turn the cane around and the Jay
[52:49] you will see Jesus my Savior was born to
[52:52] set me free the red is symbolic of the
[52:55] blood of Christ shed the price of my sin
[52:58] that he bore instead the white
[52:59] represents life made new God's gift
[53:02] through Christ's birth birth for me and
[53:05] for you a little story about about the
[53:07] candy cane I I don't know if if uh it's
[53:10] actually true it could have been written
[53:12] by some Pastor that just wanted to give
[53:14] his church candy
[53:17] canes but uh I found it found it on a
[53:20] little card and I I thought I'd share it
[53:22] with with with the Saints here let's
[53:26] read our our Christmas Story I
[53:28] appreciate the kids and and all that
[53:31] went in to doing that that play we have
[53:34] uh of course sister Jessica and and all
[53:37] the works she put in Sister Angela with
[53:39] the little ones my wife Stephanie sister
[53:41] Heather thanks to everyone that
[53:44] participated in that let's give them a
[53:46] hand and say thank
[53:51] you you did a very very nice job it it
[53:55] was it was
[53:57] definitely a blessing um I also want to
[53:59] point out that uh today it um it's
[54:03] probably a hard day for for some people
[54:06] that Generations pretty much pass now
[54:08] but today is the day that brother Brown
[54:10] passed away in
[54:12] 1965 on Christmas Eve I want to want to
[54:15] remember that um Luke Chapter 2 A
[54:19] Familiar
[54:20] Story start with verse
[54:22] one says this and it came to pass in
[54:25] those days that there went out a decree
[54:27] from Caesar Augustus that all the world
[54:29] should be taxed and this ta taxing was
[54:31] first made when cenius was the governor
[54:34] of
[54:34] Syria and all went to be taxed everyone
[54:37] into his own City and Joseph also went
[54:40] up From Galilee out of the city of
[54:41] Nazareth into Judea under the city of
[54:44] David which is called Bethlehem because
[54:47] he was of the house and lineage of David
[54:50] to be taxed with Mary his espoused wife
[54:52] being great with child and so it was
[54:55] that while they were there the days were
[54:58] accomplished that she should be
[55:00] delivered and she brought forth her
[55:02] firstborn son and wrapped him in
[55:05] swaddling clothes and laid him in a
[55:07] Manger because there was no room for
[55:09] them in the
[55:10] end and there were in the same country
[55:14] shepherds abiding in the field keeping
[55:16] watch over their flock by night and lo
[55:18] the angel of the Lord Came Upon them and
[55:21] glory of the Lord Shone round about them
[55:23] and they were soore afraid and the angel
[55:26] said said unto them fear not for behold
[55:28] I bring you good tidings of great joy
[55:31] which shall be to all people for unto
[55:33] you is Born This Day in the city of
[55:35] David a savior which is Christ the lord
[55:39] and this shall be a sign unto you and
[55:41] you shall find the Babe wrapped in
[55:43] swaddling clothes laying in a
[55:45] manger and suddenly there was with the
[55:48] angel a multitude of heavenly hosts
[55:50] praising God and saying glory to God in
[55:53] the highest and good and peace and on
[55:55] Earth peace peace and Good Will toward
[55:57] men and it came to pass as the Angels
[56:00] were gone away from them into the heaven
[56:02] that the shepherd said one to another
[56:04] let us go even unto Bethlehem and see
[56:08] this thing which has come to pass which
[56:10] the Lord hath made known unto us and
[56:12] they came with haste and they found Mary
[56:14] and Joseph and the Babe laying in a
[56:17] manger and when they had seen it they
[56:20] made known abroad the saying which was
[56:22] told them concerning this child and all
[56:25] they that heard it
[56:27] wondered at those things which were told
[56:29] them by the Shepherds but Mary kept all
[56:32] things and pondered them in her heart
[56:34] and the Shepherds returned glorifying
[56:37] and praising God for all the things that
[56:40] they had heard and seen as it was told
[56:43] them what a what a beautiful story and I
[56:47] chose to read this story out of Luke
[56:51] it's told in in two different books I
[56:55] told I uh chose to read this story out
[56:57] of Luke because the kids told the story
[57:00] out of Matthew with the wise
[57:03] men thinking about last night I was
[57:06] thinking about these
[57:08] Shepherds and how they must have felt
[57:11] imagine they were just out tending their
[57:13] sheep and then everything in their lives
[57:18] changed and I was thinking about the
[57:20] poorness of a shepherd and and the kind
[57:23] of person that was a shepherd back then
[57:26] is the same kind today we have an image
[57:28] in our mind of what a Shepherd is and
[57:31] and what these Shepherds were there when
[57:33] those angels came to them we we think of
[57:35] them as as probably cleancut men that
[57:37] were out there tending the sheep and
[57:39] were maybe praying and reading their
[57:41] Bibles or something on on that order
[57:44] maybe well to-do people but they were
[57:46] not well to-do people these were the
[57:49] poorest of the poor I was in East Africa
[57:53] a few years ago and my brother Adam and
[57:57] I were doing a project there and we were
[58:01] out in the in the bush of Africa and we
[58:05] saw this herd of
[58:06] goats come
[58:08] by and there was a shepherd with them
[58:13] guiding this
[58:15] flock and it really got to my brother
[58:20] Adam Adam saw him walking by and the man
[58:23] he had a staff he had a a pair PA of
[58:26] shorts on that I'm sure used to be pants
[58:29] but they were so ragged holes in them
[58:32] and so thin he was walking along I don't
[58:35] remember if he had a shirt on or not but
[58:36] he had one rubber boot on one foot and
[58:41] and his other foot was just bare just
[58:44] barefooted and he had a stick in his
[58:46] hand and he was walking and he was
[58:49] limping as he was tending this this herd
[58:52] of
[58:53] goats and my brother he couldn't handle
[58:57] it he just broke down so he talked with
[59:01] the the brother that was with us that
[59:03] was a native and he said I want to buy
[59:07] this man a pair of shoes and we're out
[59:08] in the middle of
[59:09] nowhere so the uh the the brother that
[59:13] was with us he said okay and Adam said
[59:15] how many how much money would it be and
[59:17] I think it was 20 or $30 he thought for
[59:19] a nice pair of shoes that he could buy
[59:21] in the nearby um village So Adam gave it
[59:26] to um the African brother the African
[59:30] brother changed it to the native
[59:33] currency and the two of them walked over
[59:39] to the
[59:40] shepherd and the shepherd looked he
[59:42] never seen a white man
[59:43] before and he saw him coming up and and
[59:47] my brother's a pretty in intimidating
[59:48] site if you know him he's a big man so
[59:51] it was it was probably a little bit
[59:52] scary seeing this this big white guy
[59:55] come up and and and thinking okay what's
[59:57] going to happen here and and he was a
[59:59] little he was a little frightened and
[1:00:02] and the the translator told him that
[1:00:05] this man from
[1:00:08] America wants to help you he wants to
[1:00:11] buy you a pair of shoes because he sees
[1:00:13] that you're limping and the shepherd He
[1:00:17] looked and and brother sedi the the man
[1:00:20] that was with us he pulled out the
[1:00:22] money and the shepherd just started
[1:00:24] shaking he never seen that much money
[1:00:27] before and he he he didn't understand
[1:00:30] why someone would be so kind to him and
[1:00:33] he he gave him the money and he he
[1:00:35] thanked him and and as he was walking
[1:00:37] off he kept looking back at us like like
[1:00:40] what had just
[1:00:42] happened when I was watching all this
[1:00:44] unfold I thought that man is a very very
[1:00:46] poor man that man if if we would meet
[1:00:50] him we would consider him kind of just a
[1:00:53] more of a loser in life and that's
[1:00:55] that's how these Shepherds were they
[1:00:57] weren't these respected people that we
[1:00:59] think so much these were the lowest of
[1:01:02] the low they were they were just barely
[1:01:06] surviving and their livelihood was this
[1:01:09] flock and it wasn't their flock they
[1:01:11] were working for somebody that had more
[1:01:13] money that was able to give them just
[1:01:15] some food
[1:01:17] basically and that was how they
[1:01:20] ate was was the little bit that they
[1:01:24] made and you think of these Angels
[1:01:26] coming down to these Shepherds why did
[1:01:29] they choose
[1:01:31] Shepherds why would they choose these
[1:01:34] people that are nobody's in life why
[1:01:36] would they choose them to announce the
[1:01:38] coming of the Messiah you would think it
[1:01:40] would go to a king or something like
[1:01:42] that but it was because these simple
[1:01:46] people out in the desert watching these
[1:01:49] sheep these simple people had room in
[1:01:52] their heart as the song says they had
[1:01:55] had room to accept something that was a
[1:02:01] gift something that was new something
[1:02:03] that not may not have been some
[1:02:06] expensive or great um thing that the
[1:02:10] world would see but a
[1:02:13] child in this
[1:02:16] cave the parents didn't even have enough
[1:02:18] money to do anything there's a there's a
[1:02:22] scripture in the Bible that says that
[1:02:23] they brought when they when they brought
[1:02:25] Jesus to be um dedicated they brought
[1:02:29] two doves you know why they brought two
[1:02:31] doves the custom was to bring a
[1:02:34] lamb but the law made it a way for those
[1:02:38] that didn't have enough money to afford
[1:02:41] a lamb which would been of the
[1:02:42] respectful type of of sacrifice for
[1:02:47] their child which would have been
[1:02:48] something that they could have been
[1:02:50] proud of the the law gave away for just
[1:02:54] to buy these two cheap Little D doves
[1:02:56] and offer that and that's what Jesus was
[1:02:59] offered when he was dedicated because
[1:03:01] they couldn't afford something
[1:03:03] more and how why would God come to these
[1:03:08] men out in the field is because as I
[1:03:11] said there was some room in their heart
[1:03:15] for God to speak and to tell that story
[1:03:18] and then they went out and they told the
[1:03:20] story it didn't matter if it was if it
[1:03:23] was this baby that was in this in this
[1:03:25] eating
[1:03:26] trough with some some towels maybe that
[1:03:30] they pulled off that probably weren't
[1:03:31] even clean that they pulled off a some
[1:03:34] sort of of work um animal and put him
[1:03:38] there and put the baby there they didn't
[1:03:41] care that it was maybe an unsanitary
[1:03:43] condition a Shepherd like that wouldn't
[1:03:45] care in the least but a Shepherd would
[1:03:49] see that as as this is is great and they
[1:03:52] would understand and they would receive
[1:03:54] that angel
[1:03:56] at the same time that this was
[1:04:00] happening there in this city this town
[1:04:03] of
[1:04:04] Bethlehem hundreds of miles away maybe
[1:04:08] thousands of miles
[1:04:11] away there were a few
[1:04:14] men that came from this this
[1:04:19] lineage of people this mysterious
[1:04:22] lineage of people called the Magi we
[1:04:25] call them the Magi sometimes in the in
[1:04:27] the text they were called the
[1:04:29] calans they were called also the M
[1:04:32] magicians but these people they were
[1:04:38] studying a prophet's message this
[1:04:41] prophet's name was
[1:04:43] Daniel do you remember the story of
[1:04:45] Nebuchadnezzar the king how
[1:04:47] Nebuchadnezzar came in to Jerusalem and
[1:04:51] he took all of the captive captive and
[1:04:53] he brought them back to Babylon you
[1:04:54] remember that story
[1:04:56] and they brought this young man named
[1:04:57] Daniel this young man named Daniel was a
[1:05:00] prophet he had a gift in his
[1:05:02] life so he's there now in Babylon cap
[1:05:05] captive this King Nebuchadnezzar has a
[1:05:08] bad
[1:05:09] dream wakes up he was terrified this
[1:05:13] dream had left him but he knew that he
[1:05:16] had a dream so he calls his
[1:05:20] Magis his wise
[1:05:22] men this mysterious
[1:05:26] group of people and he says here's the
[1:05:29] deal he says I had a
[1:05:32] dream and I need you to tell me what
[1:05:35] that dream is they said okay tell us the
[1:05:36] dream he says now here's the deal you're
[1:05:38] going to have to tell me what I
[1:05:40] dreamed these Magi were like hey we
[1:05:43] can't do that only God can do that he
[1:05:45] says let me put it this way if you don't
[1:05:49] do it then you're all going to
[1:05:52] die you're all going to be executed why
[1:05:54] would I want to have the these great
[1:05:56] people if you can't do what you're
[1:05:57] supposed to do so they were they were
[1:06:01] wiggling probably like a worm in a Limon
[1:06:04] ex nervous not knowing they're thinking
[1:06:07] they're going to die the whole race is
[1:06:08] going to be wiped out because this king
[1:06:10] is angry and then this man named
[1:06:14] Daniel he comes and he says word gets to
[1:06:18] him that they're all going to be put to
[1:06:20] death he says I'll tell the king So
[1:06:24] Daniel Comes in and tells the king not
[1:06:26] only his dream but gives him the
[1:06:28] interpretation of it so what does the
[1:06:29] king do he makes Daniel the ruler over
[1:06:32] the
[1:06:34] Magi that was 600 years before Jesus
[1:06:38] came and this group of men we call the
[1:06:42] wise man they are from that
[1:06:45] origin in that area across the
[1:06:48] world so they had studied because Daniel
[1:06:51] was the chief they had studied all that
[1:06:54] this man Daniel had written
[1:06:57] and they were watching for a
[1:07:00] sign Daniel told them after this many
[1:07:05] generations or this many years that this
[1:07:08] man the Messiah was going to come so
[1:07:10] they were studying and they were looking
[1:07:12] and they were watching the stars because
[1:07:14] that's how they told time that's how
[1:07:16] they could measure how many months or
[1:07:18] years it had been so then these men they
[1:07:21] see a
[1:07:23] sign a star that they have never
[1:07:27] seen they see it in the sky and they
[1:07:30] knew they knew Daniel probably taught
[1:07:33] them the prophecy of balum saying a star
[1:07:36] would rise out of
[1:07:37] Jacob he probably taught them the the
[1:07:41] Prophecies of of Micah and the different
[1:07:44] ones that this this man would come and
[1:07:49] deliver Israel and he would come out of
[1:07:51] this place called
[1:07:52] Bethlehem so they see this star and I
[1:07:56] wonder everybody you you see on the on
[1:07:59] the different things that they're trying
[1:08:02] to nail down what that star was and well
[1:08:04] these Stars would have come together
[1:08:06] maybe 2,000 years ago whatever it was it
[1:08:10] was something that struck them I wonder
[1:08:15] if I don't know this but I wonder if it
[1:08:19] could have just been the shikina go
[1:08:20] glory of God that came down
[1:08:25] in a star and rested over this child
[1:08:29] Jesus and they saw it so then they get
[1:08:32] on the road and they go and they're
[1:08:34] following the star as I said it was it
[1:08:37] was hundreds or thousands of
[1:08:39] miles it took them more than a
[1:08:43] year to get
[1:08:45] there they saw a
[1:08:48] sign but notice that just because they
[1:08:52] saw a sign they didn't stop and rejoice
[1:08:56] and jump up and down that we saw the
[1:08:58] sign everything's going to be okay no
[1:09:00] they saw the sign and they say we're
[1:09:02] going to follow the sign and we're going
[1:09:04] to keep going so they kept going on the
[1:09:07] road and they came to this city
[1:09:11] Jerusalem star went
[1:09:14] out they were respected people
[1:09:18] obviously so they get
[1:09:22] there and they start asking
[1:09:26] asking where is
[1:09:29] he I was born King of the Jews because
[1:09:33] we have come to worship him where this
[1:09:36] gets
[1:09:37] back to
[1:09:43] Herod
[1:09:44] and
[1:09:47] Herod starts looking at everything
[1:09:50] that's going
[1:09:51] on and there wasn't room in this man
[1:09:54] herod's heart
[1:09:56] let me read it we already read it before
[1:09:58] but let's read it again Matthew chapter
[1:10:00] 2 verse one now when Jesus was born in
[1:10:03] Bethlehem of Judea in the in the days of
[1:10:05] Herod the king behold there came wise
[1:10:07] men out of the East to Jerusalem saying
[1:10:09] where is he that born King of the Jews
[1:10:11] for we have seen a star in the east and
[1:10:13] come to worship him when Herod the king
[1:10:15] heard these things he was troubled and
[1:10:17] Jerusalem with him and when he had
[1:10:20] gathered all the chief priests and
[1:10:21] scribes and people together he demanded
[1:10:23] of them where Christ should be be
[1:10:26] born and they said unto him Bethlehem of
[1:10:28] Judea for this is written by the prophet
[1:10:31] and thou Bethlehem of J in the land of
[1:10:34] Judah Art Thou Art not the least among
[1:10:38] the princes of Judah for out of thee
[1:10:40] shall come a governor that shall rule My
[1:10:43] People Israel then Herod when he had
[1:10:46] privily called the wise men inquired of
[1:10:48] them diligently what time that star had
[1:10:51] appeared think about that and how
[1:10:57] that these wise men it was everything to
[1:11:00] them to get to this child this Messiah
[1:11:06] it was everything that that ever they
[1:11:08] had ever been taught and they must have
[1:11:10] been so honored that 600 years of
[1:11:12] generations comes down and we get to see
[1:11:15] him we get to see this great child that
[1:11:21] came to save man from his
[1:11:23] sins I think about
[1:11:27] through Jesus's life from his birth all
[1:11:30] the
[1:11:31] way to his
[1:11:33] death and I think about who had the most
[1:11:38] faith in the prophet's
[1:11:41] messages think about that think about as
[1:11:43] as Jesus was born in all the characters
[1:11:45] we have the wise men and we have we have
[1:11:47] the Shepherds and then and then later on
[1:11:49] we we have Mary and Joseph there and
[1:11:51] then later on we have Peter and James
[1:11:52] and John and all the disciples and Mary
[1:11:54] and and and the different ones and
[1:11:56] Martha who and Joseph of arthea towards
[1:11:59] in who had the greatest faith in what
[1:12:02] the prophet's messages were who do you
[1:12:05] think who would be a good
[1:12:08] example of having faith
[1:12:12] believing believing the prophet's
[1:12:15] messages who somebody somebody tell me
[1:12:17] what who do you
[1:12:19] think give
[1:12:21] me who Peter yeah Peter Peter's a good
[1:12:25] one I have somebody in my mind Peter's a
[1:12:27] good one gave giving him the kings of
[1:12:29] the the keys to the kingdom but no not
[1:12:32] Peter give me another another guess
[1:12:34] somebody
[1:12:36] else who John the Beloved
[1:12:41] disciple how could you have greater
[1:12:44] belief than John nope not
[1:12:47] John who Paul Paul had the greatest
[1:12:51] revelation of them all that's a great
[1:12:54] thought nope even
[1:12:56] close somebody
[1:12:58] else well besides Jesus yeah it's all
[1:13:01] about
[1:13:02] him
[1:13:03] Tony the Shepherds yeah they were told
[1:13:07] and they went
[1:13:10] nope come on
[1:13:13] more
[1:13:15] who the Magi because they believed
[1:13:18] you're close but
[1:13:21] no
[1:13:23] no this is so obvious how could you not
[1:13:26] guess it who sister
[1:13:27] Grace
[1:13:29] Elias
[1:13:32] Noy Mary the Mother not even
[1:13:36] close Mary questioned the the angel came
[1:13:39] to Mary and she said well how can this
[1:13:43] be who Joseph yeah he didn't question
[1:13:47] like Mary did it's a good
[1:13:50] one nope
[1:14:02] stole my
[1:14:04] thunder who had more faith who believed
[1:14:07] more than
[1:14:10] Herod think no I'm talking Herod Herod
[1:14:13] is the
[1:14:16] answer Herod when these wise men
[1:14:20] came they came to Herod and Herod said
[1:14:23] what a king
[1:14:26] I'm the
[1:14:28] king and they came to they came to him
[1:14:30] and he said wait wait wait wait
[1:14:33] wait exactly when did you see this
[1:14:36] star the
[1:14:39] star shall rise a star of Jacob when did
[1:14:42] you see this star watch what Herod was
[1:14:45] doing Herod
[1:14:47] believed Herod believed in this
[1:14:50] prophecy so he goes and he starts
[1:14:53] researching this then he goes to his
[1:14:56] priests and he says now where is this
[1:15:00] Messiah supposed to come to they said
[1:15:04] Bethlehem it's written in
[1:15:06] Micah okay so he takes he takes that and
[1:15:11] he takes over here with the mag eyes
[1:15:13] Herod
[1:15:15] believed but then every demon in hell
[1:15:19] was using Herod to kill this Christ
[1:15:22] child so Herod put it all together
[1:15:26] and he says okay two years old can't be
[1:15:29] over two because of what the wise men
[1:15:31] said in the scriptures they brought and
[1:15:33] it's got to be come from over here in
[1:15:35] Bethlehem let's start this mission to
[1:15:37] destroy this King because I am the king
[1:15:41] how much did Herod believe he believed
[1:15:44] it with everything that was in him but
[1:15:46] there was no room in herod's
[1:15:49] heart to allow God to tell his story
[1:15:51] through
[1:15:53] him how many times do I hear people say
[1:15:58] I believe
[1:15:59] it
[1:16:01] James the Apostle the pastor of the chur
[1:16:03] Church of Jerusalem I believe believe it
[1:16:05] was him that said you're good to
[1:16:08] believe but the Devils believe and
[1:16:12] tremble and here we have a story Brother
[1:16:14] David about a Devil
[1:16:16] Himself Herod believing in these
[1:16:20] prophecies and yet used it to destroy
[1:16:26] this Christ
[1:16:28] child what a
[1:16:31] thought and I think of
[1:16:33] today and all the signs I think what why
[1:16:37] can't we believe if Herod if he was
[1:16:39] inspired by a devil how come God's
[1:16:41] children don't believe even more than
[1:16:43] Herod
[1:16:46] believed we don't see we see the signs
[1:16:48] all around us but we just kind of walk
[1:16:50] through this life like it doesn't
[1:16:53] matter there was 20 th000 years from the
[1:16:56] creation of Adam and
[1:16:59] Eve to when God made a covenant with man
[1:17:02] through
[1:17:03] Abraham then there was another 2,000
[1:17:06] years when God made that Covenant to
[1:17:08] when God sent a deliverer named Jesus
[1:17:10] Christ to the people and he promised
[1:17:13] that he would
[1:17:14] return 2,000 years from the Garden of
[1:17:17] Eden to God made a covenant with Abraham
[1:17:19] and promised that he would send a
[1:17:20] deliverer 2,000 years later that
[1:17:22] deliverer comes in the name of Jesus
[1:17:24] Christ a man sacrifice and then now it's
[1:17:28] been 2,000 years later and he promised
[1:17:30] to come in this day and yet we just walk
[1:17:33] through this world like nothing's going
[1:17:36] on we see that Jesus said before I will
[1:17:42] return that there would be sin would
[1:17:45] cover the Earth as it was in the days of
[1:17:48] Noah so shall it be when I return He
[1:17:51] said violence was spread across the
[1:17:54] world World in Noah's day let me ask you
[1:17:58] this when has this world ever seen in
[1:18:00] the 6,000 years of History do that we
[1:18:02] have when has this world ever seen such
[1:18:06] violence as today and I'm not just
[1:18:07] talking about rioting in the streets I'm
[1:18:09] talking about a nuclear bomb that has
[1:18:12] and could kill millions of
[1:18:15] people couple seconds in Japan hundreds
[1:18:19] of thousands of people died talk about
[1:18:22] violence when is that ever been but it's
[1:18:27] today we have those we have that way and
[1:18:29] then he also said as it was in the days
[1:18:32] of lot who is this man lot so shall it
[1:18:34] be in the coming of the son of man so
[1:18:36] will it be when I
[1:18:38] return another sign we see
[1:18:43] today look at today what was lot lot was
[1:18:46] the governor of the city and then these
[1:18:48] perverted
[1:18:50] men perverted sexual Spirit on these men
[1:18:53] they come
[1:18:55] and they want to come and use these
[1:18:59] young men that came to lot and he was
[1:19:02] afraid of their
[1:19:04] influence and how our government is
[1:19:07] afraid
[1:19:08] today of this influence that we
[1:19:12] see from the homosexual Lobby and the
[1:19:16] power that they have they're afraid to
[1:19:19] say anything just like loton he said
[1:19:21] before Jesus returned it's going to be
[1:19:24] that way
[1:19:26] and where are
[1:19:27] we if Herod was here he'd be like he's
[1:19:31] on his
[1:19:32] way but Herod would be against him but
[1:19:35] instead God's Children Here we are and
[1:19:38] we go on eating and
[1:19:41] drinking doing our thing like nothing's
[1:19:43] happening with all of these signs set
[1:19:46] before us I think Brother David I think
[1:19:49] of
[1:19:50] Herod he saw
[1:19:53] it yet
[1:19:55] Anointed with the devil yet he
[1:19:59] saw that this was the truth because of
[1:20:02] the word of
[1:20:05] God I
[1:20:09] know I don't think that we understand
[1:20:14] how important of a time that we live in
[1:20:17] because we live in this time those
[1:20:20] Shepherds they probably had no
[1:20:22] idea but they were living in the the
[1:20:24] greatest time and they were told by
[1:20:28] angels and friends we are told we have
[1:20:31] it a lot easier than the Shepherds had
[1:20:32] it we're told all the time we have a
[1:20:35] Bible that we can read this Bible says I
[1:20:37] just quoted Luke chapter
[1:20:39] 17 shows us right here we're
[1:20:43] here and the Shepherds God came to them
[1:20:47] why because they had a
[1:20:49] heart that had space in it for something
[1:20:54] to happen for God to tell his story and
[1:20:56] he did tell his story through them Herod
[1:20:59] when it came to him he didn't have room
[1:21:00] in his heart as the song says there was
[1:21:03] nothing in Herod Herod wanted he wanted
[1:21:06] his life he wanted his
[1:21:08] power he wanted to be
[1:21:11] important Herod that was everything to
[1:21:15] him and look at our world today and look
[1:21:16] at the desires of the hearts of this
[1:21:18] whole the whole world and we see it all
[1:21:20] the time on the internet on Tik Tok on
[1:21:23] on YouTube everywhere else people
[1:21:25] lifting themselves up think telling
[1:21:28] everybody how great they are building
[1:21:31] shrines to themselves like Herod did as
[1:21:34] he was building all of these these great
[1:21:36] structures in
[1:21:38] Jerusalem and we see the same thing
[1:21:40] today and not caring What God
[1:21:43] Says and just because someone says that
[1:21:46] they believe does not
[1:21:48] matter that's all over the word of
[1:21:53] God we have have to make room in our
[1:21:56] hearts and we have to do what the word
[1:22:03] says look at how Jesus how he was born
[1:22:06] in this little
[1:22:08] manger and we all think oh it's so nice
[1:22:11] by the way I think that I don't know of
[1:22:13] any other church that actually had a
[1:22:15] real baby in their play did you see that
[1:22:17] I wasn't a doll that was that was a real
[1:22:20] thing
[1:22:22] here but how many how many people people
[1:22:24] they know that story and the churches
[1:22:26] tell the story and
[1:22:28] yet they
[1:22:30] won't make a place in their hearts they
[1:22:33] won't get out the sin and let it be
[1:22:36] replaced with the true word and the true
[1:22:38] spirit of
[1:22:39] God there's
[1:22:41] a parable in the Bible that is so
[1:22:44] important for today that there was a a
[1:22:48] man that had a house and he had this
[1:22:51] house was was taken by a demon there was
[1:22:54] a squatter in his
[1:22:56] house and it was just it was filthy he
[1:22:59] gets in he KS he K kicks the demon out
[1:23:01] he cleans his house all up gets it all
[1:23:04] really nice and puts maybe new furniture
[1:23:06] in there and new appliances gets it nice
[1:23:09] nice and clean you come in it smells so
[1:23:11] good and it's
[1:23:14] open and Jesus
[1:23:17] says that if it doesn't get occupied
[1:23:20] again that that same spirit that was
[1:23:23] there before was will come by and say
[1:23:26] hey I know how to get in this place I've
[1:23:28] been there before and he'll come
[1:23:32] in and he'll bring all of his
[1:23:34] friends and they will occupy that house
[1:23:37] again this time much worse than it was
[1:23:40] the first time because once that it was
[1:23:44] cleaned out once we've made room in our
[1:23:48] heart it needs to be filled back up with
[1:23:51] something because if it's not there'll
[1:23:53] be a void there
[1:23:55] and if that void is there something is
[1:23:57] going to come back
[1:23:59] in now think about this man the Rich
[1:24:02] Young
[1:24:02] Ruler how
[1:24:06] Jesus he came to Jesus this wasn't a
[1:24:09] parable this really happened how this
[1:24:11] this young man had everything he was a
[1:24:13] church member he paid his ties he was
[1:24:15] probably had a prominent role in society
[1:24:17] he had everything he had a lot of money
[1:24:19] everything was going good he comes to
[1:24:20] Jesus and he falls down on his knees and
[1:24:22] say says Lord how can I inherit the
[1:24:24] kingdom of
[1:24:26] God Jesus says we'll do the Commandments
[1:24:28] he says I'm doing that done it since I
[1:24:31] was born Jesus looked at him and the
[1:24:34] Bible says Jesus loved
[1:24:36] him and he says you lack one
[1:24:40] thing this man's heart this Rich Young
[1:24:44] ruler's heart was not
[1:24:47] open it was closed it was
[1:24:50] full there was no room for Jesus to come
[1:24:53] in there Jesus says sell all that you
[1:24:57] have and come follow me what a what a
[1:25:02] what words there words of compassion
[1:25:04] Jesus loved him and he saw that this is
[1:25:06] going to send this man to hell if he
[1:25:08] doesn't get rid of it get rid of these
[1:25:12] things make room in your heart for God
[1:25:16] to tell his story that man I look at
[1:25:19] that story of that man that Rich Young
[1:25:21] Ruler what was stopping him for being
[1:25:23] one of the 12
[1:25:25] disciples we would have known his name
[1:25:28] he would have had a great
[1:25:30] ministry but there was no room in this
[1:25:33] Rich Young ruler's heart as good as he
[1:25:35] was as good as he seemed there wasn't
[1:25:38] any
[1:25:39] room and he left and we know what end
[1:25:42] where he ended
[1:25:45] up think
[1:25:46] about friends
[1:25:50] these what in our lives
[1:25:55] what in our
[1:25:56] lives will prevent God from telling his
[1:25:59] story through me through
[1:26:01] you now I I have to
[1:26:05] say all of
[1:26:07] us have taken up everybody in this
[1:26:10] room our
[1:26:12] hearts are not
[1:26:14] perfect there's things that that we have
[1:26:17] in our lives that we need to get rid
[1:26:20] of I've made a stand over the past year
[1:26:24] it's been very important to me to reach
[1:26:27] out to people and say come as you are I
[1:26:30] don't care what kind of a life that
[1:26:32] you've lived I don't care if you're on
[1:26:34] drugs I don't care how you look I don't
[1:26:36] care how you dress I don't care whatever
[1:26:39] it is about you come to this place come
[1:26:42] as you
[1:26:44] are but don't stay as you
[1:26:48] are make
[1:26:50] room in your heart when you come here
[1:26:54] here and this church is accepts you
[1:26:56] which it
[1:26:57] does and you feel that love from the
[1:27:01] people and you come in and and and you
[1:27:04] give your heart to the Lord we've
[1:27:06] baptized more than 50 people up here in
[1:27:09] just this short amount of
[1:27:11] time there was a sister I preached that
[1:27:15] message a few weeks ago on we all have
[1:27:18] our
[1:27:19] vices we all have our
[1:27:22] weaknesses and
[1:27:24] those weaknesses we need to get rid of
[1:27:26] those weaknesses I was I was up there
[1:27:29] baptizing a
[1:27:31] sister tears in her
[1:27:35] eyes and I said
[1:27:38] sister I said why do you want to be
[1:27:41] baptized she said because I have many
[1:27:46] vices that is a heart that can be made
[1:27:51] room in that heart for God to tell the
[1:27:53] story through that
[1:27:55] person that Jesus Christ that baby in
[1:27:59] the manger was planted in that
[1:28:02] heart and for someone to say something
[1:28:04] like that I know God's going to tell his
[1:28:06] story in that sister no doubt in my
[1:28:10] mind but it's that other heart that cold
[1:28:14] Stony
[1:28:16] heart that won't allow God won't allow
[1:28:20] God in because I've got too much
[1:28:25] as a Rich Young Ruler the song says as I
[1:28:28] said come the song that we just sang
[1:28:30] that the kids just sang says come as you
[1:28:32] are what a beautiful thing come as you
[1:28:35] are but I say in the name of Jesus
[1:28:37] Christ don't stay as you
[1:28:40] are
[1:28:41] change let that let that heart be
[1:28:46] filled with Jesus Christ we always talk
[1:28:49] about Christmas and we think of a baby
[1:28:51] in a
[1:28:53] Manger get the baby out of the
[1:28:56] manger bring that baby Let It
[1:28:59] Grow The Book of Luke talks about Jesus
[1:29:03] and about when he was young and it says
[1:29:05] he grew in stature and in favor of the
[1:29:08] Lord Jesus Christ himself grew in
[1:29:12] stature and in favor of the Lord so if
[1:29:14] we have him in our hearts and he's in
[1:29:17] there he could be just a baby in a
[1:29:21] Manger just a little tiny B
[1:29:24] it allow him to
[1:29:28] grow allow Jesus to mature in your
[1:29:33] heart and how do you do that make room
[1:29:37] in your heart get rid of these these
[1:29:41] things that that set you back and allow
[1:29:44] Jesus to replace those
[1:29:46] things allow him to grow and mature and
[1:29:50] we look at Jesus and when he started his
[1:29:51] ministry he started doing doing Miracles
[1:29:54] the first message that Jesus preached
[1:29:57] the very first one he said
[1:30:00] repent
[1:30:02] imagine there's people it is hard for
[1:30:05] them to admit their
[1:30:07] wrong and you
[1:30:10] we they go along through life they get
[1:30:13] corrected or whatever it might be and
[1:30:15] there is no repentance there let him
[1:30:19] grow that was just the very beginning of
[1:30:21] his
[1:30:22] ministry and then as he as he went on he
[1:30:26] grew even after after he started
[1:30:28] preaching he grew in the in the spirit
[1:30:31] we look at his very first he was
[1:30:33] baptized the Holy Spirit came down on
[1:30:35] him he went into the Wilderness fasted
[1:30:38] for 40 days was tempted of the devil and
[1:30:40] overcame he was growing and if he's in
[1:30:43] our hearts if he's in us we need to
[1:30:46] grow but instead we don't allow
[1:30:51] him we say Lord you can be a baby
[1:30:55] in a Manger in my
[1:30:57] heart but when it comes to me making
[1:30:59] changes in my
[1:31:02] life that's my
[1:31:04] life this is me I need to make myself
[1:31:07] happy before I can before I can do
[1:31:10] something for other I need I need to
[1:31:12] serve myself before I can serve others I
[1:31:15] need to love myself before I can love
[1:31:17] others that is a worldly worldly
[1:31:20] statement that is not a Christian
[1:31:22] statement but how much do we we hear
[1:31:24] that all the time you got to love
[1:31:26] yourself first You Don't Have To Love
[1:31:27] Yourself I hate myself I don't want
[1:31:30] anything to do with Daniel Evans I want
[1:31:32] it to be Jesus Christ and him living in
[1:31:35] me let it
[1:31:37] grow let that Christ mature all the way
[1:31:42] till Jesus came to the end and he said
[1:31:46] now take up your
[1:31:48] cross and follow me you do what I did
[1:31:53] you you sacrifice everything just like I
[1:31:57] did and there is that Spirit of
[1:32:00] Christ where we get down on our
[1:32:04] knees and say Lord forgive me I've done
[1:32:08] wrong I'm going to stop doing this as we
[1:32:12] talked about a vice a problem a sin I'm
[1:32:15] going to get rid of this and I'm going
[1:32:17] to get rid of it just so your spirit can
[1:32:19] come in just a little bit more in my
[1:32:21] heart I just want more I want more
[1:32:28] more the Bible
[1:32:30] says let me just mention a couple
[1:32:34] things there's many people friends
[1:32:38] that they're too good maybe to go to
[1:32:42] church well we just we stay home and and
[1:32:46] uh we just listen to a tape and uh we're
[1:32:50] better than everybody else because of
[1:32:51] this
[1:32:55] let us hold fast to the profession of
[1:32:56] our faith Hebrews chapter 10:23 let us
[1:32:59] hold fast to the profession of our faith
[1:33:01] without wavering for he that is he is
[1:33:04] faithful that
[1:33:06] promised and let us consider one
[1:33:11] another why is it saying that let us
[1:33:14] consider one another to provoke un love
[1:33:18] to
[1:33:19] encourage to love and to Good Works
[1:33:23] not forsaking the assembling of
[1:33:25] ourselves together as the manner of some
[1:33:29] is Herod would read that Bible read that
[1:33:33] verse and he'd be like well that's
[1:33:35] that let's find some way to mess it
[1:33:39] up not forsaking the assembling of
[1:33:42] ourselves together as the manner of some
[1:33:44] is but exhorting one another and so much
[1:33:46] more as you see the day approaching
[1:33:48] encourage one another and I've said this
[1:33:50] before you think going to church is for
[1:33:52] you
[1:33:54] well I don't need it when did this whole
[1:33:56] thing become about
[1:33:58] you if you want to come to church it
[1:34:01] says serve others help others encourage
[1:34:03] others that's why we're here so if I'm
[1:34:06] not going and I'm not fellowshipping I'm
[1:34:08] not in church it's all about me and I
[1:34:10] don't care about
[1:34:13] you care about other people friends what
[1:34:16] a bad attitude but that's the
[1:34:19] attitude it's all about
[1:34:22] me and going to church we should serve
[1:34:27] others there's many things friends we
[1:34:30] have to think about
[1:34:33] Jesus First
[1:34:35] Timothy Chapter 2 it says that a woman
[1:34:37] shall Adorn herself in modest apparel
[1:34:39] with shamefacedness and sobriety not
[1:34:41] with gold or pearls or costly
[1:34:44] array another thing Lord how is my dress
[1:34:47] how do the way that I look how is this
[1:34:50] serving you I want to be
[1:34:51] holy Lord I I sacrifice whatever it is I
[1:34:55] want to be like you want me to be Lord
[1:34:58] not a aundy old tradition maybe but Lord
[1:35:01] now Holiness before the
[1:35:04] Lord how can I be what you want me to
[1:35:10] be
[1:35:13] modest with shamefacedness and
[1:35:17] sobriety
[1:35:19] humbleness not with gold or pearls or C
[1:35:22] I've seen ministers I've seen pastors
[1:35:24] and their
[1:35:25] wives have handbags that are $1,500
[1:35:31] $2,000
[1:35:33] what for a pastor of a
[1:35:36] church come on no better than that don't
[1:35:40] forget it's not just about the modest
[1:35:41] apparel it's also about the
[1:35:43] shamefacedness and soing not with gold
[1:35:44] or pearls or costly rates also about
[1:35:47] that Jesus said that if a man looks at a
[1:35:52] woman to lust after
[1:35:54] her he has committed adultery in his
[1:35:57] heart let's make room in our hearts
[1:36:00] here I'm not talking about looking at
[1:36:03] the sisters in church
[1:36:04] necessarily I'm not talking about maybe
[1:36:07] looking at the the women out in the
[1:36:10] world or on the
[1:36:14] street what about those women right
[1:36:18] here what about seeing
[1:36:20] that make room in your heart
[1:36:24] get rid of that
[1:36:26] too Jesus said Peter asked he he was
[1:36:30] offended at somebody he said if somebody
[1:36:32] sins against me how many times do I have
[1:36:34] to offend him Jesus looks down at him
[1:36:37] he's like
[1:36:38] Peter if he offends you seven times a
[1:36:41] day you gota you you have to forgive him
[1:36:45] and then we hold a
[1:36:47] grudge we hold a grudge against someone
[1:36:49] that we can't forgive or someone that we
[1:36:51] don't like
[1:36:54] that spot in your heart is taken
[1:36:58] up and Jesus wants you to clean that
[1:37:01] spot
[1:37:02] out how can we even call ourselves
[1:37:08] Christians and make those sins I know we
[1:37:11] sin I know I know I'm not saying that
[1:37:13] you'll be without sin but I'm saying
[1:37:17] try I'm saying make room in your heart
[1:37:21] for Jesus to tell his story through your
[1:37:23] life life all of us or else this whole
[1:37:27] story of the birth of Jesus what good is
[1:37:30] it if we just leave Jesus right there in
[1:37:34] the manger if we' have left him there he
[1:37:36] wouldn't have preached he wouldn't have
[1:37:38] went to the Cross he would have been a
[1:37:39] baby forever but he grew and he should
[1:37:43] be
[1:37:44] growing in our
[1:37:47] hearts friends all all close and if if
[1:37:50] uh our team can come forward and sister
[1:37:53] Jessica if you would also um
[1:37:57] come turn to Philippians chapter
[1:38:02] 2 verse
[1:38:07] five tell you brothers and sisters I
[1:38:09] love I love the Lord Jesus I love his
[1:38:13] birth and the Shepherds and the wise men
[1:38:16] and this story it's been said that this
[1:38:18] is The Greatest Story Ever Told it is
[1:38:20] The Greatest Story Ever Told but I
[1:38:22] wanted to be a dive Within
[1:38:25] Me Philippians 2:5 says this let the
[1:38:30] mind be in you which also was also in
[1:38:34] Christ Jesus let this mind be in you
[1:38:37] which was also in Christ
[1:38:40] Jesus the mind of this man Jesus Christ
[1:38:44] should be in us who being in the form of
[1:38:47] God thought it not robbery to be equal
[1:38:49] with God but made himself of no
[1:38:52] reputation and took upon him the form of
[1:38:55] a servant and was made in the likeness
[1:38:57] of
[1:38:59] men and being
[1:39:01] found in fashion as a
[1:39:04] man he humbled
[1:39:06] himself let the mind that was in
[1:39:11] him be in
[1:39:13] us he humbled
[1:39:17] himself and became obedient unto
[1:39:21] death even the death of the cross
[1:39:25] cross as I said Jesus grew in spirit and
[1:39:28] in stature he told
[1:39:31] us to take up our cross take up the same
[1:39:35] life that he had
[1:39:39] lived and let God tell his story through
[1:39:46] us don't let this Christmas pass
[1:39:49] brothers and sisters don't let this
[1:39:51] Christmas pass without making changes in
[1:39:53] your life
[1:39:54] life this is a serious
[1:40:00] time the Clock Was ticking when
[1:40:04] Daniel when he wrote his scriptures
[1:40:07] these wise men they
[1:40:09] watched these scriptures come down
[1:40:12] through and can you
[1:40:13] imagine what they
[1:40:16] thought when they looked out and they
[1:40:18] said brothers and sisters it's
[1:40:21] time it's time for for Jesus to return
[1:40:25] is what we would say we see the sign of
[1:40:28] Sodom we see the sign of Noah we see the
[1:40:30] sign of the times we see all of the all
[1:40:32] of this add up and all these Generations
[1:40:35] that came down and here are these wise
[1:40:37] men and they see that star of
[1:40:41] God and it was a sign to them but that
[1:40:47] sign did not mean to
[1:40:51] stop it didn't mean to just jump up and
[1:40:55] down that God sent us a sign do what the
[1:40:58] sign
[1:40:59] says they got on their camels or they
[1:41:02] got their staffs and they started
[1:41:03] walking they brought their their gifts
[1:41:06] and They carried it hundreds of miles
[1:41:08] that probably took him as I said over a
[1:41:11] year to get
[1:41:13] there their mind was on Christ their
[1:41:16] mind was on God they wanted the
[1:41:19] honor of bowing down before this baby
[1:41:24] a baby what's a baby going to do for you
[1:41:28] they wanted the honor of just bowing
[1:41:30] down to this baby and saying this is the
[1:41:34] Christ
[1:41:35] child this is the king of
[1:41:38] Israel this was the one that was sent to
[1:41:42] save man from his
[1:41:45] sins look
[1:41:48] down they gave their gifts they gave
[1:41:51] what they had
[1:41:54] and how we brothers and sisters we
[1:41:56] should make room in our
[1:41:58] hearts for Jesus
