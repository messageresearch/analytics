[32:38] amen you may be seated for her funeral
[32:41] to think that he loved you while you
[32:45] were unlovable that he looked at you and
[32:49] said I love you anyways reminds me what
[32:53] brother green taught us over the years
[32:56] when he would say what can you do to
[32:58] make God love you more we think we have
[33:02] to earn that we would have to do but he
[33:03] said look God loved you and he loved you
[33:06] with perfect love so nothing you could
[33:08] do can make him love you more so he
[33:12] turned around what could you what could
[33:13] you do make him love you less no he
[33:15] loved you perfectly so then he would say
[33:18] so what can be done about this you can
[33:20] love him more and I appreciate that that
[33:23] he loved us while we were unlovable at a
[33:26] time when we would have said you know
[33:28] there's no hope but God said oh yes
[33:29] service and I appreciate that so all we
[33:33] can do is return the favor and just love
[33:35] him and explicitly we have some some
[33:37] prayer requests emergent needs today I'm
[33:40] gonna bring to your attention for those
[33:44] of you that maybe have seen on the
[33:47] whatsapp
[33:50] on the email for our sister Karen Gil
[33:53] know they attend brother Robert Figaro's
[33:55] church they're also part of the group
[33:57] down in the Hereford area where the
[34:01] Jordan sister Martha that there are some
[34:03] time and family but sister Karen's
[34:06] family was also family that my dad met
[34:09] when he did missionary work in New
[34:11] Mexico what Minister for them so we've
[34:13] known the family for many years but as
[34:16] it was relayed to me sister Karen was
[34:18] home and she's probably about thirty
[34:21] years old
[34:21] sister Martha 4:35 okay with some young
[34:26] children and she wasn't feeling well so
[34:28] she had asked her daughter to to go get
[34:31] her she felt like she might have to
[34:32] throw up so go get her a bag or
[34:34] something like this how the story was
[34:35] related to me and the time her daughter
[34:37] came back her oldest daughter came back
[34:39] because she was unresponsive so they
[34:41] took her to the to the hospital and
[34:43] they're in Sierra Vista and then took
[34:46] her to hear it to TMZ and did a series
[34:49] of tests and could not determine but but
[34:52] she had seemed to have the like she'd
[34:55] had a stroke or something along that
[34:56] minded her husband brother Cesar had
[35:00] sent this text out he said all the tests
[35:02] that the doctors have done on my wife
[35:04] removing spine fluid to MRI scans and
[35:08] checking her brain activity with sensors
[35:10] on her head all have come back negative
[35:12] and all as well praise be to our Lord
[35:16] and Savior Jesus Christ they don't know
[35:18] what's happening and the only thing they
[35:20] can think is that her body entered a
[35:22] state of shock after not having enough
[35:24] sleep and stress the doctors are saying
[35:27] she might only need to get physical
[35:29] therapy to have to regain her full
[35:31] movement on her right side so again we
[35:35] thank the Lord for that but also to
[35:38] continue it keep them in prayer she has
[35:40] is it five children five five young
[35:43] children so it is something we want to
[35:46] memory keeping in a reminder of those
[35:49] things
[35:51] let's there was a couple other requests
[35:53] your brother saucy muscle fellow that
[35:55] sent him says pray for my vision I'm
[35:58] seeing double for a couple of weeks I've
[36:01] been have been having this issue and
[36:02] last week I started having black spot in
[36:04] the center of my vision I went to the VA
[36:07] but I didn't get any answer going to
[36:09] another doctor soon this has been a real
[36:11] big problem for him so let's remember
[36:12] brothers Othello and brother Jeremy
[36:16] Baggett is this this the same the
[36:18] written one and the one on is it the
[36:21] same okay it says prayers for for my
[36:28] daughter dusty she starts treatment on
[36:30] the 22nd for brain tumors it's one of
[36:33] brother Jeremy's co-workers they believe
[36:35] prayer and prayer the prayer faith that
[36:38] the tumors dry up and are gone now so
[36:40] that's our confession we go to the Lord
[36:43] and we say Lord I have a need but I
[36:45] confess that you've met it already
[36:47] that is our confession so and then
[36:51] sister there's one more hear from sister
[36:56] Debbie Calbert I know was here she she
[37:02] that's brother man
[37:03] Watkins mother-in-law she pulled a
[37:07] muscle and her back lifting something up
[37:10] above her head so she asked that we
[37:11] would remember her in prayer so we would
[37:15] do that of course anytime that somebody
[37:18] has a need we'd be willing to say just
[37:20] like I want somebody to pray for me then
[37:22] then you would ask prayer so let's stand
[37:24] and for the mic Alderson would you come
[37:27] and and take these take these requests
[37:30] in prayer and him and I always say lift
[37:33] up to one hand saying Lord I have a need
[37:35] and then lift up the other hand saying
[37:37] Lord I believe I'm more testified both
[37:40] ways thank you
[37:43] let's take these needs to the Lord
[37:47] father we just once again are thankful
[37:51] to be here today we're just to see old
[37:54] friends to be with other brothers and
[37:56] sisters as we prepare for your word we
[37:59] care these prayer requests their their
[38:03] needy or the young mother needs a
[38:07] complete restoration of her health the
[38:09] brother with this vision the tumors the
[38:11] back aches and I certainly couldn't
[38:14] speak for myself and probably everyone
[38:16] here we have a need and we just ask that
[38:17] you would come on the scene we just pray
[38:20] that you would bless the remainder of
[38:22] this service bless the brother that will
[38:25] be speaking and all of us as we listen
[38:28] to the message today which is grateful
[38:30] to be here we ask that you would bless
[38:32] the remainder of our day in your name we
[38:35] pray Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may
[38:41] be seated
[38:42] so we do have some praises all soon
[38:45] how many would the lift a hand would
[38:47] just say I just want to say thank you
[38:48] Lord for being so good to me you know if
[38:52] just the fact that he watches over us
[38:55] it's more than enough how many times I
[38:57] know naomi was telling the other days
[38:59] she was driving over I believe to take
[39:02] Sarah over to the for her her dialysis
[39:07] they were in the turn lane and somebody
[39:09] just switched right on over
[39:10] she's honking her horn honking away
[39:13] trying to get their attention and they
[39:14] just keep right pushing her up against
[39:16] the curb and it was just a tiny little
[39:18] scratch on the side of the car for
[39:20] something that could have been a lot
[39:21] worse and you say well like the car got
[39:24] scratched what's that compared to losing
[39:27] the life or being hurt God is still
[39:29] mindful of us so I appreciate that
[39:31] sister Barbara Yarborough justice thank
[39:34] you for praying for sister Janet McGarry
[39:36] she passed away on Wednesday afternoon
[39:39] well while the whole family was gathered
[39:42] around
[39:42] her bed after reading Psalms 23 she
[39:45] slipped away into his presence and
[39:49] brother Robert had read the scripture
[39:53] after they finished singing so the Lord
[39:55] is so good he takes his children home in
[39:58] a way to comfort us too because that one
[40:01] that's gone home doesn't need to comfort
[40:03] anymore as those of us are on this side
[40:05] that need to have soul sister mercy
[40:07] she's here with us today I want to thank
[40:09] everyone for their prayers God has
[40:12] strengthened me every day and asking
[40:13] that we would continue to pray as she's
[40:15] been unstable on her feet and then
[40:17] brother Nathaniel sent in a Rodina they
[40:22] praise he said that was he want to get
[40:24] praise to the Lord he said I was just
[40:25] having a hard time a discouraged during
[40:27] the week he said and he he got a phone
[40:30] call from somebody who wanted to know if
[40:33] they could know from a complete stranger
[40:36] actually they asked if they could share
[40:38] a scripture with him he says and and it
[40:42] says we talked about the wonderful
[40:44] things of the Lord for about an hour and
[40:47] I asked him how they got my number they
[40:48] they told me they had searched they
[40:52] searched the neighborhood around and the
[40:55] phone numbers could they thought they'd
[40:56] be in the same neighborhood so I asked
[41:00] him if they lived on the northeast side
[41:01] and they said no I live on the south
[41:04] side by the freeway and they proceeded
[41:07] to ask me how I ended up way up there
[41:09] and we we realized that the Lord had
[41:12] intervened on my behalf
[41:13] he gave a scripture to somebody on the
[41:15] other side of town who doesn't know him
[41:17] got his phone number called him and said
[41:19] here let me encourage you with this what
[41:21] a mighty God we serve who could take his
[41:25] servant a prophet a man of God a sister
[41:29] and say put this on their heart to
[41:32] minister to somebody they may not even
[41:33] know because God knows that so do
[41:36] appreciate that and just a reminder for

[47:21] before we approach the word our gracious
[47:23] Heavenly Father we're so happy to be
[47:25] gathered together today in your house
[47:28] knowing that the beauty of the church is
[47:31] the character of its people and that
[47:33] what captures your attention what brings
[47:36] you up on the scene is not the physical
[47:38] structure in the four walls not even the
[47:41] mechanics of pews and pulpits but Lord
[47:44] it's the expectation of your people and
[47:46] the obedience to your word to assemble
[47:48] together in your name and father's we
[47:51] have come and gathered we have felt your
[47:54] presence as we have worshiped and we
[47:55] know that you have inhabited those
[47:57] praises and you're pleased with our
[48:00] offering
[48:00] but now Lord come take the bread of life
[48:03] rightly divide the word of truth to our
[48:05] hearts that it might give us strength
[48:07] and courage for the hour that we're
[48:09] living in Lord as believers we have a
[48:12] unique perspective upon the world we can
[48:15] see the things that are transpiring
[48:16] whether it be panicked because of a
[48:18] pandemic or even unrest and fear Lord
[48:22] that creeps into the hearts and minds of
[48:24] people even the injustice --is that we
[48:26] see and the terrible things that are
[48:29] being played out in social media and on
[48:31] the news Lord we look at it and realize
[48:33] it's because man has forsaken you
[48:35] and Lord we realize that the pain and
[48:38] the suffering that's in this earth we we
[48:40] could even take it back to the very
[48:41] beginning when sin first entered in Lord
[48:44] we realized that we have a different
[48:46] view in a different perspective and
[48:48] Father our hearts ache for our nation it
[48:52] aches for those around the world that
[48:54] are suffering and Lord we pray that you
[48:56] could use us to be lights in the dark
[48:58] time that we could have such the right
[49:01] the right kind of attitude towards
[49:03] injustice the right kind of attitude
[49:04] towards towards the wrongs and Lord the
[49:07] the right kind of disposition in the
[49:09] time of chaos and panic that others
[49:11] would see Christ see the love and
[49:13] forgiveness of Christ see you your light
[49:15] being made manifest in purity Lord and
[49:18] in righteousness so father we pray that
[49:20] you would feed us by your word
[49:22] strengthen us and encourage us we ask in
[49:24] the name of Lord Jesus Christ amen
[49:26] a man I'm gonna be reading from Genesis
[49:29] chapter 2 Genesis chapter 2 verses 7 to
[49:34] 10 and then we'll skip to verse 15 and
[49:37] read the rest of the chapter it's good
[49:40] to be together with you today and we
[49:42] considered a great privilege to be able
[49:44] to minister it's not the desk that you
[49:46] stand behind that makes it an honor but
[49:48] it's the people that you stand before
[49:49] and we considered a real honor and
[49:51] privilege to stand before you and
[49:53] appreciate your pastor brother Matthew
[49:55] asking us to take the service we
[49:57] consider it an honor and we're grateful
[49:59] for that it's kind of hoping he would be
[50:00] here but then if he was here you'd want
[50:03] to hear him preach so it worked out well
[50:04] that he's not able to be here but I just
[50:07] wanted to extend those that appreciation
[50:09] about Matthew and his family for the
[50:11] opportunity to be here and we appreciate
[50:12] you very much we're praying for you and
[50:14] we're so happy to see the Lord's
[50:15] blessings upon you and I wasn't going to
[50:17] mention it but brother Aaron's kind of
[50:19] set me up there's a couple brothers here
[50:21] today that traveled from afar brother
[50:24] Tom Donaldson came in from Deming New
[50:26] Mexico and also brother James Hayes came
[50:28] in from Hot Springs Arkansas just to
[50:30] make sure I didn't cause any trouble
[50:32] today so it's nice to have some good
[50:34] friends that came out to be in the
[50:35] service we pray that Lord be their
[50:36] portion we look forward to saying hello
[50:39] to you I don't know four allowed to
[50:40] shake hands and this part of the world
[50:42] but we used to at least want to look you
[50:44] in the eye and tell you we love you we
[50:45] appreciate you and hope to get some
[50:46] fellowship in Genesis chapter 2 verse 7
[50:49] and the Lord God formed man of the dust
[50:53] of the ground and breathed into his
[50:55] nostrils the breath of life and man
[50:58] became a living soul and this is you
[51:03] know we very familiar scripture reading
[51:05] to us and I'll give my title now maybe
[51:08] he sir could help process some of these
[51:10] scriptures were reading out I want to
[51:11] speak on the the subject of fulfilling
[51:13] the original and so really examining and
[51:16] looking at the the pattern that God laid
[51:19] here in the beginning it says in the
[51:21] Lord God planted a garden eastward in
[51:23] Eden and there he put the man whom he
[51:26] had formed and out of the ground made
[51:28] the Lord God to grow every tree that is
[51:31] pleasant to sight and good for food and
[51:34] so this is a tremendous scripture we
[51:37] know that if it grew from the ground it
[51:39] was good to eat
[51:40] and so if God told them not to eat of a
[51:42] tree then it means it didn't grow from
[51:43] the ground and so was out of the ground
[51:45] may the Lord God to grow every tree that
[51:47] is pleasant this sight and good for food
[51:49] The Tree of Life also in the midst of
[51:51] the garden and the tree of knowledge of
[51:53] good and evil and a river went out of
[51:55] Eden to water the garden and from thence
[51:58] it was parted and it became in two
[52:00] foreheads and we'll just skip to verse
[52:02] 15 and the Lord God took the man and put
[52:05] him in the Garden of Eden to dress it
[52:08] and to keep it and the Lord God
[52:10] commanded the man saying of every tree
[52:12] of the garden thou mayest freely eat but
[52:14] of the tree of the knowledge of good and
[52:16] evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the
[52:18] day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt
[52:20] surely die so God wasn't trying to trick
[52:23] them if it grew out of the ground it was
[52:25] good to eat and so since this tree you
[52:28] can't eat it and if you eat it you die
[52:29] it means it didn't grow out of the
[52:30] ground so it must represent something
[52:32] different I think it's tremendous how
[52:34] the scripture lays that out and is
[52:36] pointing us to the original sin and
[52:38] verse 18 Oh Lord God said it was not
[52:40] good that man should be alone I will
[52:44] make him a help meet for him and out of
[52:47] the ground the Lord God formed every
[52:48] beast of the field and every fowl of the
[52:50] air and brought them unto Adam to see
[52:52] what he would call them and whatsoever
[52:54] Adam called every living creature that
[52:55] was the name thereof and Adam gave names
[52:57] to all cattle and to the fowl of the air
[53:00] and to every beast of the field but for
[53:01] Adam there was not found to help meet
[53:03] for him and the Lord God caused a deep
[53:06] sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and
[53:09] he took one of his ribs and closed up
[53:11] the flesh instead thereof and the rib
[53:13] which the Lord God had taken from man
[53:15] made he a woman and brought her unto the
[53:18] man and Adam said this is now bone of my
[53:21] bones and flesh of my flesh she shall be
[53:24] called woman because she was taken out
[53:26] of man therefore shall a man leave his
[53:28] father and his mother and shall cleave
[53:30] unto his wife and they shall be one
[53:32] flesh and they were both naked the man
[53:34] and his wife and were not ashamed a man
[53:38] you may be seated I'm gonna read a
[53:42] statement from the message power of
[53:44] transformation here at the outset and I
[53:48] think these scriptures just form a
[53:49] wonderful a basis for
[53:53] this this quote because you can like
[53:55] kind of see some of the dynamics and the
[53:57] things that brother branham is gonna be
[54:00] referring to here he says there was Adam
[54:02] and Eve walking in the Garden of Eden
[54:06] every seed bringing forth and what
[54:09] brother branham begins to describe we
[54:12] could even say is commenting even on the
[54:15] silence between Genesis chapter 2 in
[54:17] Genesis chapter 3 because we can read
[54:19] how the man and the woman come to be and
[54:22] they're placed in the Garden of Eden and
[54:23] as they're setting they're in the Garden
[54:25] of Eden there under a commission under a
[54:27] commandment but yet there's not there's
[54:30] not anything that's developed or things
[54:32] that are said or a much description
[54:33] that's given to us about what that would
[54:36] have been like and so there's a there's
[54:37] a silence of the life that Adam and the
[54:40] woman were living in the Garden of Eden
[54:42] between Genesis chapter 2 in Genesis
[54:44] chapter 3 because if you just read it
[54:46] you'd think well the very first day
[54:48] after the woman was formed and brought
[54:50] unto the man the very next day or the
[54:52] very next moment the serpent is speaking
[54:54] to the woman and causing her to fall but
[54:57] we know that there was some
[54:58] manifestation some expression some life
[55:00] being lived in the garden that the
[55:03] scripture is silent - and it says in in
[55:06] many ways you could even look at how the
[55:08] life of Jesus Christ you have these
[55:10] silent years of Jesus Christ we see just
[55:12] a a glimpse of him at the age of 12 but
[55:15] then you have these silent years of
[55:16] Christ through his teenage years and
[55:18] even up to the age of 30 that the Bible
[55:20] doesn't speak to it doesn't give us the
[55:22] background or any description of the
[55:24] activities he would have done to know
[55:26] and so brother Branham in commenting on
[55:29] this he says every seed bringing forth
[55:31] it never could do nothing else it never
[55:34] could do nothing else because God said
[55:36] let it be that way it had to be that way
[55:38] and he says all how I'd like to stop
[55:41] here just a moment a minute to say see
[55:43] there is where we are facing yet the
[55:47] completion of that word and so when he
[55:50] speaks of completion it's bringing
[55:52] something to its fulfillment and he says
[55:54] oh that that is where we're facing yet
[55:57] the completion of that word and he's
[55:59] referring to that word which is bringing
[56:01] forth of its kind how every seed in the
[56:04] garden was bringing forth of its kind
[56:06] God said let it be that way and it could
[56:08] only be that way and there's something
[56:10] that strikes the prophet to such a
[56:12] magnitude Tory wants to just stop and
[56:14] say oh my just think of it today where
[56:18] we're living right now in what he's
[56:20] ministering in the power of
[56:21] transformation he's saying we're
[56:23] fulfilling what that original word was
[56:26] meant to be he says all I want to stop
[56:28] just for a minute to say this is what
[56:30] we're facing now the very completion of
[56:33] that word we're gonna finalize what God
[56:36] intended by creation we're gonna bring
[56:39] to completion what God was expressing
[56:41] there in the beginning and so to to to
[56:46] say that we're facing the completion of
[56:48] that word he's point us to the fact that
[56:51] God is now in this time satisfying his
[56:54] purpose of creation that God is going to
[56:57] satisfy the very intent of the design
[57:01] that he set forth what we look at and
[57:03] see in the Garden of Eden we see
[57:04] different elements coming into existence
[57:06] we see God giving certain Commandments
[57:08] he's saying what we're facing today is
[57:10] the very satisfaction of what God
[57:12] envisioned in the beginning he had an
[57:15] intent he had an ax per purpose so when
[57:18] I I used this title fulfilling the
[57:21] original we're wanting to look at what
[57:23] God had in his mind in the beginning and
[57:25] he's bringing it to pass and this
[57:28] message is is characterized as being a
[57:32] restoration of the original and that was
[57:35] necessary and I want to just put a bring
[57:37] that into view and then kind of put it
[57:41] in this this frame it was necessary for
[57:44] there to be a restoration in order to
[57:46] complete and fulfill God's purpose of
[57:48] the original because you could see
[57:51] different patterns and we may not take
[57:53] the time to do it this morning we may
[57:54] refer to it again this evening
[57:56] but there's certain times where God was
[57:58] expressing something and manifesting
[58:00] something but he never got the
[58:01] satisfaction or the fulfillment of what
[58:04] he intended in that expression so we
[58:06] speak of fulfilling the original there
[58:08] had to be a restoration of the original
[58:10] even a restoration of the original faith
[58:13] and a restoration of the original church
[58:15] and a restoration of even the original
[58:17] Word not just to say all it's been
[58:19] restored
[58:20] in reform rep but rather that God could
[58:22] bring the final step and the climax for
[58:25] what he intended by that word we could
[58:29] just maybe I'll just use it in this
[58:30] context you can understand what I'm
[58:32] pointing to we know that God birthed his
[58:35] church on the day of Pentecost and that
[58:37] was the Alpha bride and we see the great
[58:39] power of God in the and the the word of
[58:41] the Lord increasing in signs and wonders
[58:44] working within the church but God didn't
[58:46] just raise up a church and raise up a
[58:48] body so that every member of that body
[58:51] would go through the cycle of a
[58:53] spiritual revival only to be met with a
[58:55] literal grave that's not what God
[58:58] intended by his church he actually has
[59:00] it written in the New Testament it's
[59:02] prophesied that there would finally come
[59:04] a time where the body of Christ would
[59:07] place that last enemy under their feet
[59:09] so God's original intent and design
[59:11] behind the church wouldn't be that every
[59:14] saint would go to a grave but that
[59:15] finally one day there would be a triumph
[59:18] over the grave and a triumph over death
[59:20] and a meeting in the air so God doesn't
[59:23] restore the original just so that we
[59:25] could be right back in the same pattern
[59:26] of revival and death that even the
[59:28] original Church to come to but rather
[59:30] raise up something in the last days that
[59:33] would take that final climax and go to a
[59:35] meeting in the air so there's a
[59:37] restoration of the original in order to
[59:40] fulfill God's ultimate purpose and
[59:42] purpose speaks of intention when you
[59:45] when you have a purpose it's your aim or
[59:47] it's your goal what's your reason for
[59:49] doing something why are you doing what's
[59:50] your purpose and the very word purpose
[59:53] it's it brings up the prefix of pur
[59:56] which means to put forth or posed and
[59:58] then also posed to put or to place
[1:00:00] that's when you purpose something you
[1:00:02] put forth to place something it's a
[1:00:05] placing and when you speak of the
[1:00:07] purpose of something if you purpose
[1:00:09] something it's to design it or to have
[1:00:11] it used in a certain way it's been
[1:00:13] purposed for a particular meaning or
[1:00:15] thing and so when we speak of our own
[1:00:17] purpose and purposes and the purpose of
[1:00:21] God we could even say it this way and I
[1:00:23] know it may be a staggering statement
[1:00:24] but it's the greatest force and the most
[1:00:26] important thing there is if God has a
[1:00:28] purpose if God has a design if God has a
[1:00:31] desire and we could even say his purpose
[1:00:33] it's his
[1:00:34] then it must ultimately conform to that
[1:00:36] and fit within that this is how powerful
[1:00:40] purposes brother Graham said Satan can't
[1:00:41] take you to God's purpose for you is
[1:00:43] finished
[1:00:44] that means if gold has an intention if
[1:00:46] God has an aim if God has a design if he
[1:00:48] has a reason for your being and then it
[1:00:51] there's nothing that can take you until
[1:00:53] you've satisfied that purpose so -
[1:00:57] purpose something or the purpose of
[1:00:59] something it's a placing in position to
[1:01:01] accomplish a specific goal you don't
[1:01:03] just throw some why is that thing
[1:01:05] sitting there oh I just put it there
[1:01:06] there's no purpose to it but when you
[1:01:08] play something somewhere with intent and
[1:01:11] and reason then that's your that's the
[1:01:13] purpose behind it and it becomes the
[1:01:15] purpose of the thing and brother Graham
[1:01:17] says oh if the church only knew its
[1:01:19] position and he says it will one day
[1:01:22] then the rapture will go when it knows
[1:01:24] what it is
[1:01:26] so there's to have an understanding of
[1:01:28] purpose to have a place in in your
[1:01:30] position brother Branham actually
[1:01:32] relates the translation of our bodies to
[1:01:35] the knowledge and understanding and your
[1:01:38] positional placing that all the church
[1:01:40] only knew its position and it's not just
[1:01:43] a lot of knowing what you are and where
[1:01:45] you are but it's the whole understanding
[1:01:47] of who you are your position your
[1:01:50] understanding the time you're living
[1:01:52] it's the whole thing and recognizing who
[1:01:54] the bride is and what she's been called
[1:01:56] to in this hour the rapture will go when
[1:01:58] she knows these things she's coming to
[1:02:02] her purpose to recognize her very
[1:02:03] purpose and brother Branham says oh I'd
[1:02:07] like to just stop a minute to say this
[1:02:09] is where we're facing yet the completion
[1:02:11] of that word so we are facing the
[1:02:15] completion or the fulfillment of the
[1:02:18] original purpose of God he created the
[1:02:21] world for reason he designed he designed
[1:02:23] a life for a very reason and we're
[1:02:25] facing today the very satisfaction of
[1:02:28] God's intent brother Branham in question
[1:02:31] and answers part three says the very
[1:02:32] creator that created the earth for a
[1:02:34] purpose
[1:02:35] he said Satan defiled it so God created
[1:02:39] the earth for a purpose it had it had a
[1:02:43] design to it God was expressing certain
[1:02:45] things even in
[1:02:46] creation and even in the creation of the
[1:02:47] earth and the bringing forth things out
[1:02:49] of the earth God had a great purpose for
[1:02:52] it but he said Satan defiled it Satan
[1:02:54] seemingly interrupted God's plan that
[1:02:58] God had a purpose with the earth he says
[1:03:00] Satan defiled it
[1:03:01] Satan was just working within the
[1:03:02] framework of God's plan to manifest
[1:03:05] something great but it shows God had a
[1:03:06] purpose then Satan comes in and tries to
[1:03:08] defile it but the random rights in the
[1:03:11] church age book he says the heart
[1:03:13] purpose the eternal purpose of God was
[1:03:15] to take a bride of his own choosing and
[1:03:18] that purpose was in himself and being
[1:03:21] eternal was decreed before the
[1:03:23] foundation of the world so the heart
[1:03:26] purpose and the eternal purpose of God
[1:03:29] this is what made him who he was when
[1:03:32] someone has a heart purpose and the very
[1:03:34] eternal purpose of God is to take the
[1:03:36] bride of his own choosing that becomes
[1:03:38] what his obsession is or that becomes
[1:03:40] what he's a characterized by this is
[1:03:43] what we know that guy his whole purpose
[1:03:44] in life is to do this and well that guy
[1:03:47] it's his heart that's what's in his
[1:03:48] heart this is easy his Drive and his
[1:03:50] eternal ambition brother Branham is
[1:03:52] characterizing God as having one
[1:03:54] ambition and that's to have a bride of
[1:03:57] his own choosing she says and that
[1:03:59] purpose was in himself and be need
[1:04:01] eternal was decreed before the
[1:04:03] foundation of the world
[1:04:04] now that's staggering to think that God
[1:04:07] is willing to be defined as a being who
[1:04:10] desired to have a wife he's willing to
[1:04:13] be defined as one who so so desired to
[1:04:17] have fellowship and so desire to have a
[1:04:19] bride of his choosing that there that
[1:04:21] very passion and that very drive to have
[1:04:24] a wife caused him to form himself into a
[1:04:27] light which we call the logos and then
[1:04:29] me to begin to create all for the
[1:04:31] singular objective of ultimately one day
[1:04:34] having a wife of his choosing
[1:04:36] that's why creation exists that's why
[1:04:38] the world exists is not so that God
[1:04:41] could just have a human experiment and
[1:04:43] not that God could well let's just see
[1:04:45] what happens and what unfolds but he had
[1:04:47] a singular purpose and a singular
[1:04:49] objective I must have a bride of my own
[1:04:52] choosing millirem says in the message
[1:04:54] paradox God made the earth he made it
[1:04:57] for purpose to take a church out
[1:05:00] a bride and that's the most important
[1:05:03] job in the world this is brother
[1:05:05] branham's language this is his message
[1:05:07] to to us that God had a purpose for the
[1:05:10] earth and that was to take a bride out
[1:05:11] of him and he says that's the most
[1:05:15] important job in the world is to call
[1:05:18] the bride forth and to bring them to
[1:05:21] their place and in their position so he
[1:05:23] made the earth for the purpose of
[1:05:25] getting a bride out of it and the
[1:05:28] chapter seven at the church age book he
[1:05:30] writes first of all we know most
[1:05:31] assuredly that the purpose of God stands
[1:05:34] in election it was purposed in himself
[1:05:36] it was God's purpose to bring forth a
[1:05:39] people likened himself that would be a
[1:05:42] word bride so this is God's purpose so
[1:05:46] then you could it's very easy then just
[1:05:48] to understand even what's bubbling up in
[1:05:52] my heart today and fulfilling the
[1:05:53] original satisfying God's original
[1:05:55] intent and his design when you fulfill
[1:05:57] the original you're bringing forth a
[1:05:59] very hard purpose of God so you can say
[1:06:01] now I've achieved for myself this bride
[1:06:04] of my own choosing and in Genesis we can
[1:06:08] see the beginning of all things and then
[1:06:12] we could just start looking at God's
[1:06:14] pattern and God's purpose and then you
[1:06:17] can even see how Satan tries to attack
[1:06:19] God's purpose in God's plan but I want
[1:06:22] to I want to look at it in detail this
[1:06:24] morning to see the beginning of what
[1:06:26] we're finishing to see the beginning of
[1:06:29] what it is that we're fulfilling brother
[1:06:32] Branham says in the message marriage and
[1:06:34] divorce
[1:06:34] he says Genesis is the seed chapter to
[1:06:38] every question in the Bible and you
[1:06:40] always have to go back to the seed to
[1:06:42] see what kind of a seed is in the field
[1:06:44] to find out what your crops will be if
[1:06:47] you know the seed that sown then you can
[1:06:50] have an expectation as to what crop will
[1:06:51] come up though brother Branham says go
[1:06:53] back to Genesis identified the seed
[1:06:55] understand the seeds that were sown and
[1:06:57] then you'll know what kind of plant
[1:07:00] you're gonna see in the field or the
[1:07:02] messes it all come up in Genesis it's a
[1:07:04] seed you start in Genesis you'll get
[1:07:07] your picture straight so if you want to
[1:07:09] understand what's taking place today it
[1:07:11] has to line up with the seed that
[1:07:13] Sonne in the beginning God can't so one
[1:07:16] pattern and have one purpose in the
[1:07:18] beginning and then vary from that in the
[1:07:21] end so he says you go back it all comes
[1:07:23] out in Genesis it's all in seed form
[1:07:25] Genesis is the seed chapter so brother
[1:07:27] Bram says there was Adam and Eve in the
[1:07:29] garden every seed bringing forth he says
[1:07:32] there is where we're facing yet the
[1:07:33] completion of that word the seeds that
[1:07:36] were sown in the beginning the pattern
[1:07:38] that was laid in the original whatever
[1:07:40] saying that's being finished today
[1:07:42] that's important to catch that when
[1:07:45] brother Branham says that he's directly
[1:07:47] implying that there was something that
[1:07:50] was not finished there was something
[1:07:53] that was not yet completed by by Adam
[1:07:57] and Eve but yet there was something
[1:07:59] expressed in them and we know when
[1:08:02] brother Branham preaches Christ as the
[1:08:04] mystery of God revealed he said there
[1:08:05] was a three-fold purpose to Christ and
[1:08:07] that any and he goes to that threefold
[1:08:10] purpose and to have and to manifest
[1:08:12] himself in his son to have preeminence
[1:08:14] in his bride and and we'll go into
[1:08:16] detail here in a moment in that sermon
[1:08:17] and he says to restore back to the
[1:08:21] Garden of Eden and I want to read those
[1:08:23] statements in detail but then he says
[1:08:25] this statement the threefold purpose of
[1:08:29] God manifested in Adam and Eve
[1:08:32] so the threefold purpose is first
[1:08:35] manifested in Adam and Eve now I would
[1:08:38] say that it wasn't apparent that that
[1:08:40] was a three-fold purpose so we could say
[1:08:42] that brother Branham is identifying a
[1:08:43] mystery that was hidden in them his
[1:08:46] purpose was a hidden mystery that's
[1:08:48] actually being manifested in Adam and
[1:08:51] Eve that if you look at Adam and the
[1:08:53] woman there's a mystery to God there's a
[1:08:56] mystery of God that's being expressed
[1:08:57] and he says the threefold purpose of God
[1:08:59] was manifested in Adam and the woman and
[1:09:02] if you don't know what that threefold
[1:09:04] purpose is it can actually be hidden in
[1:09:06] the simplicity of a man and a woman
[1:09:08] being placed in a garden so the purpose
[1:09:11] of God is being completed by fulfilling
[1:09:13] what God manifested in Adam and the
[1:09:17] woman whatever that purpose was whatever
[1:09:19] that design was whatever God was
[1:09:22] foreshadowing in typing in Adam and the
[1:09:24] woman we are facing today the very
[1:09:27] completion and the finishing of that
[1:09:29] manifestation and brother Branham says
[1:09:32] this in Christ is the mystery of God
[1:09:34] revealed and I'm gonna read just a few
[1:09:36] statements here just to see this
[1:09:38] continuity he says what is his
[1:09:40] three-fold purpose manifest himself in
[1:09:43] Jesus Christ now when he manifests
[1:09:45] himself in Jesus Christ he's that's the
[1:09:48] bridegroom it's a manifestation of the
[1:09:50] bridegroom and it's a manifestation of
[1:09:52] the last Adam so in manifest himself in
[1:09:56] Jesus Christ it's a it's the perfect
[1:09:58] fulfillment of what Adam was
[1:10:00] foreshadowing it's an expression of Adam
[1:10:03] so he says manifest himself in Jesus
[1:10:05] Christ to come into the body by Jesus
[1:10:08] Christ this is the last woman or the
[1:10:12] bride you have a second Adam and you
[1:10:14] have the last Adam now you have the last
[1:10:16] woman or you have the bride so you can
[1:10:19] see how brother Aaron says the threefold
[1:10:20] purpose of God manifested in Adam and
[1:10:23] Eve you had Adam who prefigures Christ
[1:10:25] you have the woman that prefigures the
[1:10:27] bride and he says to have preeminence
[1:10:30] ah's and that's in his body the bride to
[1:10:32] restore back to Eden bring back that
[1:10:35] which is lost so this is the three-fold
[1:10:38] purpose right bridegroom bride and then
[1:10:41] Eden a Garden of Eden condition he says
[1:10:44] now through that he's talked about the
[1:10:46] tree of life he brings forth a bride
[1:10:48] tree which will be The Tree of Life
[1:10:50] restored back to him back to God he says
[1:10:54] in it's actually expression of God he
[1:10:56] says as husband a tree of life restored
[1:10:59] back to him God expressed those are my
[1:11:01] words as husband and wife in the Garden
[1:11:04] of Eden by the same word and the same
[1:11:07] God made manifest in husband and wife
[1:11:09] the same bride tree back again so this
[1:11:12] is brother branham amplifying this
[1:11:14] threefold purpose of God manifested in
[1:11:16] Adam and the woman it's going to bring
[1:11:19] the Tree of Life will be restored back
[1:11:21] to him and how is it expressed as a
[1:11:23] husband and wife in the Garden of Eden
[1:11:25] the expression of God now is it's not
[1:11:29] just a being in eternity but now it's
[1:11:32] God being expressed as a man and a woman
[1:11:35] in the Garden of Eden God made manifest
[1:11:39] in husband and wife he says
[1:11:40] then he says this further and now on his
[1:11:43] way back to the original Eden restoring
[1:11:46] back his bride in fellowship so the
[1:11:48] original Eden has something to do with
[1:11:51] the bride being back in fellowship he
[1:11:53] says back with God as husband and wife
[1:11:56] in the Garden of Eden
[1:11:57] sure Christ and his bride now and I
[1:12:02] think that this is probably maybe just
[1:12:05] sharing what may be pulling back the
[1:12:07] curtain a bit to hear hear my thinking
[1:12:10] and what's in my heart
[1:12:11] the the the mechanics and the dynamics
[1:12:16] of this and I think it's easy for us to
[1:12:18] think on the man the woman and then
[1:12:20] there's going to be this location you
[1:12:22] know that we're coming to but or even a
[1:12:25] future millennium or a future a future
[1:12:28] place but he's talking about the
[1:12:32] expression of not just having a man and
[1:12:35] not just having a woman but at being
[1:12:38] under the headship of the word to
[1:12:40] fulfill his design to fulfill his intent
[1:12:43] to fulfill his purpose so there's
[1:12:45] something being expressed in this all
[1:12:48] right we don't want to just narrow it to
[1:12:49] this idea of oh well we'll have a man
[1:12:51] and we'll have a woman we'll have like a
[1:12:53] garden a really nice green lush place to
[1:12:55] live there's something there's something
[1:12:57] a greater spiritual application to this
[1:13:00] that'll have more meaning than just
[1:13:02] fantasizing about some future garden
[1:13:05] that we're going to be walking through
[1:13:06] and so brother Branham says it's a
[1:13:09] revelation
[1:13:10] it's eternal as God's Word is eternal
[1:13:12] look the the threefold purpose of God's
[1:13:15] great mystery is revealed God manifested
[1:13:20] in Christ Christ manifested in the
[1:13:23] church in order to redeem the lost eve
[1:13:26] back to the original condition in the
[1:13:30] Garden of Eden so it's not it's not a
[1:13:33] physical location a geographical
[1:13:35] location where God has manifested Christ
[1:13:38] now he has a bride and we need to be
[1:13:40] physically gathered together with Jesus
[1:13:42] of Nazareth and then go walk on the
[1:13:44] shores of Galilee or find that place
[1:13:45] near the Euphrates where the Garden of
[1:13:47] Eden was but he's pointing out that this
[1:13:50] great expression this great
[1:13:51] manifestation of God's eternal purpose
[1:13:54] and the very mystery of God as we were
[1:13:56] found shipping on with some friends
[1:13:58] yesterday have the very mystery of
[1:14:00] goddess to be finished in this time and
[1:14:02] but it's in the days of the voice of the
[1:14:04] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:14:06] sound the mystery of God should be
[1:14:10] finished and brother Branham I believe
[1:14:12] was very purposeful in titling his
[1:14:14] message Christ is the mystery of God
[1:14:18] revealed in other words this is my
[1:14:20] ministry I am the seventh angel and I've
[1:14:22] got to bring a message that finishes
[1:14:24] this mystery so he preaches it and I
[1:14:26] know maybe it might not seem very very
[1:14:28] direct but I believe he was very
[1:14:29] intentional in using that phrase and
[1:14:32] preaching that substance because he said
[1:14:34] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[1:14:36] and he's saying don't God's great
[1:14:38] mystery is revealed we've come to the
[1:14:42] finishing we've come to the climax God
[1:14:44] manifested in Christ Christ manifested
[1:14:47] in the church what for what purpose in
[1:14:49] order to redeem the lost eve or the lost
[1:14:51] woman back to the original condition in
[1:14:54] the Garden of Eden so it's not back to
[1:14:57] the original location in the Garden of
[1:14:59] Eden but there must be a Garden of Eden
[1:15:01] condition so what were those conditions
[1:15:04] what were the dynamics what were the
[1:15:06] mechanics what was God envisioning
[1:15:08] that's what this message brings out of
[1:15:10] you we're completing the original
[1:15:16] manifesting the full maturity of the
[1:15:18] original spoken word seed to fulfill the
[1:15:22] purpose so back to the original is a
[1:15:27] restoration of that image in the Garden
[1:15:30] of Eden and it's a restoration of the
[1:15:33] condition in the Garden of Eden there
[1:15:36] was a condition there were certain
[1:15:37] things about that that scene and that
[1:15:41] place God God took great care to
[1:15:43] describe it the way that he did God took
[1:15:45] great care to place it the way that he
[1:15:47] did because God knew that we would be
[1:15:49] here we're not here as the result of God
[1:15:52] not planning correctly and figuring out
[1:15:55] a way to keep the devil out no God
[1:15:57] allowed it to be this way to manifest
[1:15:59] his great plan and his great purpose and
[1:16:01] so that he could achieve to himself a
[1:16:03] bride of his choosing that would love
[1:16:05] him just absolutely love him that
[1:16:07] would love him without having ever seen
[1:16:09] him and this would be a real love
[1:16:11] relationship with the woman who knows
[1:16:13] and sees and is recognized and believed
[1:16:16] all of his attributes and
[1:16:18] characteristics and so the first
[1:16:22] masterpiece was Adam and the woman in a
[1:16:26] perfect Eden the first masterpiece
[1:16:29] wasn't the earth the first masterpiece
[1:16:32] wasn't just a man on earth but it was
[1:16:34] the man and the woman in a perfect Eden
[1:16:36] Villa BAM called it the masterpiece
[1:16:38] family villa BAM in the masterpieces for
[1:16:41] nearly two thousand years God has been
[1:16:43] making himself a masterpiece because he
[1:16:45] struck Adam to get a part of him a rib
[1:16:48] to make a wife for him and and so he
[1:16:51] says and just maybe I'm jumping in right
[1:16:54] in the middle of a subject here that I
[1:16:55] know you're familiar with he's
[1:16:57] identifying that the bride is a
[1:16:59] masterpiece so he says he took a piece
[1:17:02] out of Adam to make a wife for him and
[1:17:05] he says and now that perfect masterpiece
[1:17:07] he struck at Calvary he got a piece off
[1:17:09] of him
[1:17:10] so what God was reflecting in Adam was
[1:17:13] foreshadowing what he wanted to do in
[1:17:15] Christ it was all part of his hidden
[1:17:18] purpose and his hidden place and he hid
[1:17:19] it from Satan because know there's no
[1:17:22] doubt that Satan thought man I know
[1:17:23] exactly where he's going I know exactly
[1:17:25] what he's gonna do he's gonna bring
[1:17:27] forth the son by this woman and that
[1:17:29] woman is gonna bring forth the son in
[1:17:31] the image of Adam and this is going to
[1:17:32] be the kingdom that God is going to
[1:17:34] reign in and this is going to be for all
[1:17:35] eternity
[1:17:36] and he goes I don't have the power to
[1:17:38] create my own kingdom I can never be
[1:17:40] worshipped as God I can never send to
[1:17:42] the above the stars of God but what I
[1:17:44] can do is I can prover t' and i can mix
[1:17:47] up his plan and cut him off and so he
[1:17:50] causes the woman to fall in order to
[1:17:52] bring forth perversion and he doesn't
[1:17:54] realize that god placed the woman on
[1:17:57] that basis so that she would fall so
[1:18:00] that God could manifest all his great
[1:18:02] eternal attributes because then
[1:18:04] immediately just showing that God's
[1:18:06] purpose is being made manifest
[1:18:07] immediately Adam instead of saying all
[1:18:09] your ruined spoiled goods woman God give
[1:18:12] me another woman I didn't didn't say
[1:18:15] well if memory serves me correctly you
[1:18:17] took this one rib out and hey
[1:18:20] got a few more got a few more ribs here
[1:18:23] Lord so let's just see how far we can
[1:18:25] take this do we finally kind of get this
[1:18:27] right
[1:18:27] yeah you might want to tweak what you
[1:18:29] did the last time because this one
[1:18:30] didn't work out no Adam instinctively
[1:18:33] went through an act of love the love act
[1:18:36] went and redeemed his wife and notice
[1:18:40] and I just feel so much inspiration now
[1:18:42] and it's a compliment to you you're
[1:18:43] hungry for the word you're desirous of
[1:18:45] this words you believe that this message
[1:18:47] though it may have been preached fifty
[1:18:48] years ago
[1:18:49] you believe there's still life and
[1:18:50] revelation to come out of it and it's a
[1:18:52] compliment to you that you could you
[1:18:55] could pull a minister into these
[1:18:56] channels to expound upon these things
[1:18:58] but Adams instinct was not to ask for
[1:19:01] God to create another one
[1:19:03] nor was it his instinct to put her away
[1:19:05] in divorce because he was operating
[1:19:08] under a single marriage covenant and
[1:19:10] under that covenant there was no putting
[1:19:12] away to remarry again there was just
[1:19:15] simply the instinct and the act of
[1:19:17] redemption and he took the woman and
[1:19:19] redeemed her it wasn't well let's just
[1:19:23] get a new one it was a redemptive act
[1:19:25] and what was he expressing that God had
[1:19:28] the same kind of love and passion for
[1:19:30] his own wife that he would redeem her
[1:19:32] regardless of the cost he would redeem
[1:19:35] her and he would wash her and he would
[1:19:36] keep her and he would bring a wife back
[1:19:38] to himself and I if I could say this
[1:19:45] this is just personal now so if you want
[1:19:48] to put that notation in your notes where
[1:19:50] it says well this was the man giving his
[1:19:52] opinion feel free just to put my
[1:19:55] initials there out next to it but I
[1:19:57] think we're too quick to focus on what
[1:20:00] brother Graham said in marriage and
[1:20:01] divorce as it pertains to he can she
[1:20:02] can't instead of identifying that here's
[1:20:06] a profit restoring us back to a single
[1:20:08] marriage covenant it wasn't he can she
[1:20:12] can't if you really want to get honest
[1:20:14] was never do such a thing as that again
[1:20:15] and teach your children not to do it
[1:20:17] that's what he was zeroing in on and he
[1:20:20] was Irian zero in on the fact that the
[1:20:22] reason why we have a double covenant is
[1:20:24] because of the fall and when Jesus was
[1:20:26] asked about divorce he went back to the
[1:20:28] beginning
[1:20:29] when Paul dealt with marriage he went
[1:20:31] back to the beginning they didn't go
[1:20:32] from the double covenant they went to
[1:20:34] the single covenant they said well then
[1:20:35] why did Moses tell away so we could
[1:20:37] divorce he said because the hardness of
[1:20:38] your heart that's the reason why there
[1:20:41] was a writ of divorce is because the
[1:20:42] hardness of hearts could we not then as
[1:20:44] men and women today say my heart having
[1:20:47] been restored back to the original word
[1:20:49] I don't want to have this mind set in
[1:20:51] this thinking well I can just put it
[1:20:53] away and get another one but lord let me
[1:20:55] have a heart like Christ back to the
[1:20:57] original single marriage covenant again
[1:20:59] to be one that would be have an instinct
[1:21:02] to redeem though that may be applicable
[1:21:05] in marriage but just think of our
[1:21:07] attitude sometimes towards people who
[1:21:09] backslider
[1:21:10] wonder away or have a different opinion
[1:21:12] on certain things we're just too quick
[1:21:14] to kind of kick them out give him the
[1:21:15] left for the fellowship as it were
[1:21:17] instead just thinking all God could you
[1:21:19] would you bring them back so he says a
[1:21:25] Christ now in Christ it's so Adam was
[1:21:27] reflecting something he's portraying
[1:21:29] something very beautiful so he says he
[1:21:32] struck a piece off of Calvary he got a
[1:21:34] piece off of him he says it's just the
[1:21:36] New Testament that's all talking about
[1:21:39] an understatement there talk about just
[1:21:41] kind of qualifying a little bit my
[1:21:42] goodness if I'm gonna be a juster that's
[1:21:44] all let me be that it's just the New
[1:21:47] Testament that's all the so the the part
[1:21:50] that he gets from Christ is the New
[1:21:53] Testament now we think while we think
[1:21:55] red-letter and we think books of Paul
[1:21:57] and Peter and John and these things but
[1:21:59] no brother branham is saying the New
[1:22:00] Testament is the bride she is the
[1:22:04] testament to the New Covenant
[1:22:06] she is the testimony she is the proof
[1:22:09] she's the very manifestation but Apollo
[1:22:12] fontaine just ministered at our church
[1:22:14] back in North Carolina how thy people
[1:22:16] shall be for sign and a wonder and the
[1:22:19] people you are the evidence you are the
[1:22:21] proof and you're our God just help me to
[1:22:25] express this the right way
[1:22:26] the only proof that you need of this
[1:22:29] message being right is the newness of
[1:22:31] life you have in your own soul
[1:22:35] I can't reason with this I can't argue
[1:22:37] with this I cannot deny this my life is
[1:22:40] the proof to me that this is the word so
[1:22:45] he said it's just the New Testament
[1:22:47] that's all
[1:22:47] and then he expresses this he fulfilled
[1:22:50] the Old Testament Christ did now it's
[1:22:53] the New Testament another piece to be
[1:22:56] fulfilled the new and old is husband and
[1:22:59] wife and had taken the old to foreshadow
[1:23:01] the new Christ come the masterpiece to
[1:23:03] fulfill that now his bride will fulfill
[1:23:06] everything that's in the New Testament
[1:23:09] another masterpiece in the making the
[1:23:13] bride will fulfill everything that's in
[1:23:16] the New Testament then I just want it
[1:23:19] all
[1:23:20] the bride will fulfill everything that's
[1:23:23] in the New Testament another masterpiece
[1:23:25] in the making here's another piece to
[1:23:27] that masterpiece family coming back the
[1:23:32] bride fulfills all the hope all the
[1:23:36] expectation all the promise and all the
[1:23:38] potential of the original faith of the
[1:23:41] New Testament church otherwise brother
[1:23:44] Branham wouldn't say well they all
[1:23:45] wanted to live in this thing if all the
[1:23:48] hope all the potential and everything it
[1:23:50] could be was has already been finished
[1:23:52] and fulfilled then they would say yeah I
[1:23:55] don't want label to see it just go ahead
[1:23:56] and give me the Upper Room go ahead let
[1:23:59] me have those those those years after
[1:24:01] Christ walk the face of the earth let me
[1:24:02] live in that day but brother Graham says
[1:24:04] no that of all of them in all ages
[1:24:06] wanted to live in this day why would
[1:24:08] they choose this dark Laodicean time
[1:24:10] could you imagine all of us all 2020 and
[1:24:15] knowing 2020 so you know there's gonna
[1:24:18] be kovat 19 yeah yep I realize the
[1:24:20] pandemic yep you know there's gonna be
[1:24:22] this right listen we're only halfway
[1:24:24] through I mean what's gonna come next
[1:24:27] and and you look at everything going on
[1:24:31] and listen I have a I have a room a
[1:24:33] burden in a heart for our country to see
[1:24:35] just things decades and hundreds of
[1:24:38] years of in justices and listen if they
[1:24:41] wanted to go ahead and take the lid off
[1:24:43] the things the white man's been doing to
[1:24:45] those of other races
[1:24:46] and we we would all be trembling in our
[1:24:48] boots brother madam said it exactly
[1:24:49] right the white man's the renegade and
[1:24:51] there's a lot of seeds that have been
[1:24:53] sold that are coming back and being
[1:24:54] manifested and hurts and pains and
[1:24:57] hatred and rebellion and could you
[1:24:58] imagine being a prophet back then in
[1:25:00] seeing this day and say yeah that's what
[1:25:02] I want to live that's the age you want
[1:25:05] to live in what were they seeing what
[1:25:07] were they focusing on and what was it
[1:25:09] that was in their hearts that they why
[1:25:10] did they want to live in this age not
[1:25:12] because the condition of laodicea not
[1:25:14] because of the days of lot not because
[1:25:16] of the days of Sodom not because the
[1:25:17] days of Noah because the day when the
[1:25:19] Son of Man is revealed in this day and
[1:25:22] this time to bring forth this full
[1:25:23] purpose they say yes these have all been
[1:25:25] wonderful ages but God has always been
[1:25:28] moving towards this and I want to be
[1:25:31] there when he achieves it finally I want
[1:25:33] to be there in the end
[1:25:34] when he has what he's been wanting all
[1:25:36] this time the bride will fulfill
[1:25:40] everything that's in the New Testament
[1:25:42] your that masterpiece but BAM says in
[1:25:46] the message masterpiece he says
[1:25:47] Michelangelo could not reproduce that
[1:25:49] again he could not put it back so when
[1:25:53] when Michelangelo marred his masterpiece
[1:25:55] I mean maybe you could glue that piece
[1:25:58] back on but there'd always be a flaw
[1:26:00] unrepairable a blemish that would always
[1:26:02] remain he says but God's going to do it
[1:26:05] he's going to bring this little bride
[1:26:08] that smitten right back to the side of
[1:26:12] the original word you know we used the
[1:26:15] phrase smitten when I when a boy is just
[1:26:18] fallen in love with a girl I say oh he's
[1:26:22] smitten she smitten the bride she's been
[1:26:24] smitten
[1:26:25] she's been smitten with love and also
[1:26:28] brother and says it's got a it's got to
[1:26:30] be smitten in order to speak so the very
[1:26:33] thing you're the very smiting that we
[1:26:35] take the very persecution the very
[1:26:36] hardships we enduring it only me
[1:26:38] qualifies us to speak qualifies us to be
[1:26:41] the final voice to the final age he's
[1:26:43] going to bring this little bride that's
[1:26:45] smitten right back to the side of the
[1:26:46] original word and there he is there's
[1:26:48] the masterpiece the family back again in
[1:26:51] the Garden of Eden how is this bride
[1:26:53] going to do this how is the week going
[1:26:55] to do this Malachi for said in the last
[1:26:58] days it would be
[1:26:59] back restored back like the beginning
[1:27:03] that's the first and original
[1:27:04] masterpiece he's gonna bring this little
[1:27:07] bride back to his side the side of the
[1:27:10] original word right back to the side of
[1:27:12] the original the family back again in
[1:27:14] the Garden of Eden restored back like
[1:27:15] the beginning he's identifying a pattern
[1:27:18] in the beginning that were fulfilling
[1:27:21] and Satan's Eden and I'm an express this
[1:27:25] not to get you with nervous or anything
[1:27:27] but I just purposely didn't look at my
[1:27:28] watch for the cloth because I wanted to
[1:27:31] finish as soon as I could you know if
[1:27:34] you look at your watch and think oh man
[1:27:35] I got I got plenty of time I got plenty
[1:27:38] of time because I keep looking at it
[1:27:39] wrong like man that back that minute
[1:27:42] hands just not moving you realize an
[1:27:43] hour later it was this it was the hour
[1:27:44] hand in message Satan's EB says having
[1:27:50] faith in all his word his seeds speaking
[1:27:53] of God brought and Eden of holiness love
[1:27:55] and eternal life that's what God's Eden
[1:27:58] produced holiness and it brought an Eden
[1:28:01] of holiness of love his church now this
[1:28:04] is I'm a guy I want to slow down there
[1:28:06] his word brought an Eden of holiness
[1:28:09] love eternal life that's what God's Eden
[1:28:12] produced
[1:28:13] he says holiness it brought an Eden of
[1:28:16] holiness love understanding perfection
[1:28:19] and eternal life in other places he said
[1:28:21] they had perfect love perfect love all
[1:28:23] around of a perfect understanding of
[1:28:25] God's love
[1:28:25] he said no death around them at all so
[1:28:28] that's the Garden of Eden condition it
[1:28:32] doesn't have to be a specific
[1:28:34] geographical location upon a certain
[1:28:38] latitude and longitude but now it's not
[1:28:40] according to coordinates but it's
[1:28:41] according to condition he said this is
[1:28:43] what God's Eden produced so when we
[1:28:46] think about a Garden of Eden and being
[1:28:48] restored back like it was at the
[1:28:49] beginning of family back in the Garden
[1:28:51] of Eden we can't think of time travel or
[1:28:54] moving dimensionally to be in a certain
[1:28:57] location think of characteristics think
[1:29:00] of the condition in the atmosphere
[1:29:02] because then Bertha says that's what his
[1:29:04] church will be at the
[1:29:06] so when he says this and he speaks I
[1:29:09] wants to bring the bride back to the
[1:29:11] condition in the Garden of Eden it's not
[1:29:13] that he wants to get us physically back
[1:29:15] into a lush green garden and I'm
[1:29:17] repeating that over and over so you can
[1:29:18] catch this spiritual layer here he's
[1:29:21] saying that's what his church will be at
[1:29:23] the at the end it will be the same thing
[1:29:26] so what he is doing is he's connecting
[1:29:29] what the bride is now with the original
[1:29:32] Eden condition there are certain
[1:29:35] attributes and characteristics of that
[1:29:36] garden in Eden he says now the bride is
[1:29:40] going to manifest the same thing that
[1:29:42] was manifested in that hayden in that
[1:29:45] garden the bride will be the same thing
[1:29:49] that's what his church will be at the
[1:29:51] end and doesn't say that's where that's
[1:29:52] where she'll be in the end that's his
[1:29:55] church will be in the end she will be
[1:29:58] that she will be a garden of holiness
[1:30:00] she will be a manifestation of love and
[1:30:03] eternal life because God's Eden produced
[1:30:05] holiness and and love and understanding
[1:30:08] and perfection so that's what we are
[1:30:10] today we are manifesting his planting we
[1:30:15] are manifesting his holiness his love as
[1:30:18] understanding his perfection no death
[1:30:20] around us eternal life this bride is
[1:30:22] going to manifest the entire New
[1:30:24] Testament that's what his church will be
[1:30:29] at the end it will be the same thing in
[1:30:32] Genesis chapter 2 verse 8 he says this
[1:30:36] and I now and then I kind of could say
[1:30:40] that this is where we transition now to
[1:30:41] focus on what we had read in our text to
[1:30:44] see this picture unfolding says in
[1:30:47] Genesis chapter 2 verse 8 it says after
[1:30:49] the Lord God had formed man of the dust
[1:30:50] of the ground because he first makes him
[1:30:52] supernatural being and then he forms out
[1:30:55] of the dust of spirit now comes into
[1:30:57] flesh it says in the Lord God planted a
[1:30:59] garden eastward in Eden eastward even in
[1:31:04] the the Hebrew means beginning in Eden
[1:31:08] and Eden means delight God's delight so
[1:31:11] God is it's not just as Moses is riding
[1:31:14] this it's not that it needs to be
[1:31:15] technically correct and say that
[1:31:17] location-wise it was it was
[1:31:19] directionally east in the garden but
[1:31:22] rather God is showing that even in the
[1:31:24] beginning he had planted a garden for
[1:31:27] his own delight God the Lord God planted
[1:31:31] a garden in the very beginning in Eden
[1:31:33] and then he says and there he put the
[1:31:36] man whom he had formed so God in the
[1:31:40] beginning had already had this garden
[1:31:42] and now he takes this man once he forms
[1:31:44] an inflation now he puts him in the
[1:31:47] garden that he had formed and notice how
[1:31:49] brother branham points out this
[1:31:51] beautiful distinction when Adam and Eve
[1:31:53] had their children in Eden not in the
[1:31:56] Garden of Eden because they had been
[1:31:58] driven out of the Garden of Eden but
[1:32:00] they were still in Eden and the Garden
[1:32:03] of Eden laid east in Eden so there was
[1:32:07] something special that was planted in
[1:32:10] Eden and that was lost through the fall
[1:32:14] and it's and now he says they were still
[1:32:17] in Eden but the Garden of Eden was a
[1:32:20] special place they were still in Eden
[1:32:24] but the garden which laid Easter was
[1:32:26] planted in the beginning her eastward in
[1:32:28] Eden there the access to that expression
[1:32:30] access to that conditioned access to
[1:32:33] that place had been cut off so he says
[1:32:36] it this way in Satan's Eden when he got
[1:32:38] it all made and finally arrived with its
[1:32:40] headquarters of Earth in a beautiful
[1:32:42] spot Lane East of Eden called the Garden
[1:32:45] of Eden so it's now a spot god made the
[1:32:49] world's headquarters in the Garden of
[1:32:50] Eden in Egypt right at the east of the
[1:32:52] garden was the headquarters and over the
[1:32:54] whole situation he put his son and his
[1:32:56] son's wife over all of it that's what
[1:32:59] God did he put them in full control
[1:33:01] notice how he says this them in full
[1:33:04] control they could speak to the winds
[1:33:06] and it would cease to blow they could
[1:33:08] speak to the tree and it would move from
[1:33:09] here to there the lion and the wolf fed
[1:33:11] together and the lamb laid down with
[1:33:12] them there was no evil remember I want
[1:33:16] you to connect this now with brother
[1:33:18] Branham saying in Christ and the mystery
[1:33:20] of God revealed that were to be restored
[1:33:22] back to a Garden of Eden condition a
[1:33:24] particular harmony with there would have
[1:33:26] got a particular expression of God
[1:33:28] purpose in his design he says he put
[1:33:30] them in control they could speak they
[1:33:33] could speak so even though we might
[1:33:35] conjure up this image that the woman
[1:33:38] would tell Adam what to do but she was
[1:33:40] also given the authority and the power
[1:33:42] to do it herself he says it was perfect
[1:33:46] peace perfect harmony everything in
[1:33:48] perfection and when God had it under his
[1:33:50] control
[1:33:51] this is that Garden of Eden condition
[1:33:53] this is the Garden of Eden or the garden
[1:33:56] in Eden and notice he had his world he
[1:33:59] had it all in operation
[1:34:00] he had everything coming everything Eden
[1:34:02] vegetations nothing to die nothing to be
[1:34:04] ruined nothing to be spoiled it was just
[1:34:06] perfect and overall he placed his
[1:34:09] beloved children his son and his
[1:34:11] daughter a husband and wife to control
[1:34:14] it so the garden is a beautiful
[1:34:18] expression the garden is for showering
[1:34:22] the bride it shows a husband and a wife
[1:34:26] with full control and supreme control
[1:34:28] over everything that's in it and I want
[1:34:31] to identify this that the garden itself
[1:34:35] this place that brother man's describing
[1:34:37] perfect peace perfect harmony everything
[1:34:39] in perfection everything under control
[1:34:41] the garden itself was foreshadowing the
[1:34:45] Bride of a perfect Eden because it's
[1:34:48] going to be a perfect evening and he's
[1:34:51] and the garden that God plants eastward
[1:34:53] in Eden is actually represented in
[1:34:56] foreshadowing the bride because the
[1:34:59] garden in Scripture is figurative of a
[1:35:02] bride and it's verse 9 says the Lord God
[1:35:06] planted a garden eastward in Eden and
[1:35:08] there he put the man and in verse 9 says
[1:35:12] the Tree of Life also in the midst of
[1:35:15] the garden so the tree of life is in the
[1:35:18] midst of the garden verse 10 says and
[1:35:20] the river went out of Eden to water the
[1:35:22] garden now you can see and we won't take
[1:35:26] time to do it this morning but you can
[1:35:28] see how this begins to express the very
[1:35:32] existence and the presence of Christ in
[1:35:34] the midst of his bride and how from you
[1:35:37] shall flow rivers of water and the
[1:35:41] operation of the body and a river went
[1:35:43] out of Eden to water the garden and all
[1:35:45] these different things that are being
[1:35:46] expressed here you can see how it's
[1:35:48] foreshadowing its prefiguring the very
[1:35:50] mechanics and dynamics of God's body and
[1:35:56] so we're just these scriptures identify
[1:35:58] what was being foreshadowed in the
[1:35:59] garden because it's a hidden mystery
[1:36:01] that today is being finished in hosea
[1:36:04] chapter 2 verse 23 and I want to just
[1:36:07] use a few scriptures here to identify
[1:36:09] this garden that God planted Easter in
[1:36:11] the Eden it was foreshadowing you it
[1:36:15] says in Hosea 2:23 and I will sew her
[1:36:17] unto me in the earth God planted a
[1:36:21] garden eastward in Eden he says I will
[1:36:24] sew her unto me in the earth so the Lord
[1:36:27] planted a bride at the very beginning of
[1:36:29] Eden
[1:36:30] there was a planting even before Satan
[1:36:33] got to the woman your seed was already
[1:36:36] sown even before Satan tried to
[1:36:39] interrupt God's plan God had already
[1:36:41] before Satan got to the woman God had
[1:36:43] already envisioned you and had set
[1:36:46] things in motion and sold the seeds that
[1:36:48] would manifest as you today he says I
[1:36:53] was so her unto me and the earth I will
[1:36:55] have mercy upon her that had not
[1:36:57] obtained mercy and I will say to them
[1:36:59] which were not my people
[1:37:00] that aren't my people and they shall say
[1:37:02] thou art my god this is a beautiful
[1:37:05] prophecy of the Gentile bride the
[1:37:07] heathen the reprobate the ones without
[1:37:08] the promise they that are not identified
[1:37:10] with Israel they that cannot lay claim
[1:37:12] to Abraham Isaac and Jacob I will show
[1:37:15] her a Gentile bride unto me in the earth
[1:37:18] and even though they were not a people
[1:37:20] there will be a revelation come forth
[1:37:22] that I am their God and they are my
[1:37:24] people and how does he do it by first
[1:37:26] sowing her in the earth well do you see
[1:37:31] who the treasure in the field is you
[1:37:34] didn't go find Christ hid in the field
[1:37:38] you weren't rooting around and found a I
[1:37:40] found a great treasure he hid in the
[1:37:42] field and gold Christ I better hide you
[1:37:45] and I'm gonna go sell everything I have
[1:37:48] so I can buy the field so I can get you
[1:37:50] that it doesn't even make any sense if
[1:37:52] you think about it that way but the
[1:37:54] treasure hidden the field was you you
[1:37:58] were sewn by him in the earth so he paid
[1:38:00] the price as a sacrifice when he shed
[1:38:03] his blood he purchased the whole earth
[1:38:05] pay for sins of all of mankind for his
[1:38:09] elect sake for the treasure that was hid
[1:38:12] in the field also her unto me in the
[1:38:15] earth and he says it in the very
[1:38:17] beginning Genesis 2:8 and the Lord God
[1:38:19] planted a garden in the beginning in
[1:38:21] Eden because he showed his bride already
[1:38:24] in the earth and so Song of Solomon
[1:38:27] chapter 4 verses 12 to 16 listen to the
[1:38:30] very language of the scripture a garden
[1:38:33] enclosed is my sister my spouse a spring
[1:38:37] shut up a fountain sealed thy plants are
[1:38:40] an orchard of pomegranates with pleasant
[1:38:42] fruits campfire with spikenard spikenard
[1:38:44] and saffron calamus and cinnamon with
[1:38:46] all trees of frankincense myrrh and
[1:38:48] aloes with all the chief spices not a
[1:38:50] doTERRA Young Living in sight just all
[1:38:53] the originals there says a mountain a
[1:38:57] fountain of gardens a well of living
[1:38:59] waters and strains from Lebanon listen
[1:39:03] how he's described it in the Garden of
[1:39:04] Eden at realized also in the midst of
[1:39:07] the god of river went out of Eden into
[1:39:08] water the garden and now he's describing
[1:39:10] his spouse and described her as having
[1:39:14] plants and a fountain of gardens a well
[1:39:16] of living water streams from Lebanon
[1:39:18] so he says awake o north wind and come
[1:39:21] thou south blow upon my garden that the
[1:39:23] spices thereof may flow out and then the
[1:39:27] bride says let my beloved come into his
[1:39:30] garden this is the bride's response now
[1:39:32] so you have the bridegroom say oh like a
[1:39:34] garden enclosed is my wife very language
[1:39:39] of the Song of Solomon describes the
[1:39:40] wife as the garden enclosed and he
[1:39:43] describes her in this very lush and rich
[1:39:45] environment and then he says all come
[1:39:47] winds blow upon that that the spices may
[1:39:49] flow and now the bride's response is let
[1:39:52] my beloved come into his garden and eat
[1:39:55] his Pleasant fruits and then he answers
[1:39:57] back I am come into my garden my sister
[1:40:01] my spouse
[1:40:02] now why is they even saying my sister my
[1:40:04] spouse because it's representative of
[1:40:07] same bone the same flesh bone of my bone
[1:40:10] flesh of my flesh the same origin the
[1:40:13] same Genesis I am coming to my garden my
[1:40:16] sister my spouse as I've gathered my
[1:40:18] myrrh with my spice I've eaten my
[1:40:20] honeycomb with my honey and I've drunk
[1:40:21] my wine with my milk all friends this is
[1:40:24] a continuing Chapter five all friends
[1:40:27] drink
[1:40:27] yeah a drink abundantly open loving her
[1:40:32] so beautiful
[1:40:33] what God is expressing in the scripture
[1:40:35] the bride say come come into their
[1:40:40] garden it's the one that you've
[1:40:42] preserved this one that you've kept come
[1:40:44] now come into your garden he says I am
[1:40:48] come into my garden and what did God do
[1:40:50] in Genesis chapter 2 verse 15 and the
[1:40:52] Lord God took the man and he put him
[1:40:55] into the Garden of Eden to dress it and
[1:40:57] to keep it that's the very image we see
[1:41:01] in the beginning the very pattern we see
[1:41:03] laid forth in the beginning the very
[1:41:04] original is I am come down I placed him
[1:41:07] in the Garden of Eden and now
[1:41:09] represented a song a psalm is a garden
[1:41:11] with the wife said come come into your
[1:41:13] God he says I am coming to my garden and
[1:41:15] as they had twenty seven two and three
[1:41:17] and that day sing me unto her a vineyard
[1:41:20] this is what you sing to her you are a
[1:41:22] vineyard of red wine full the
[1:41:25] stimulation of Revelation a vineyard of
[1:41:26] red and red wine high the Lord do keep
[1:41:29] it I will water it every morning moment
[1:41:32] lest any hurt it I will keep it night
[1:41:35] and day who's the it it's her the
[1:41:38] vineyard high the Lord do dress that I
[1:41:40] do keep it I will water and I will
[1:41:42] protect it I will keep it night and day
[1:41:44] lest anyone come to hurt and try to hurt
[1:41:47] it
[1:41:47] that's why brother Branham said that God
[1:41:48] will do everything he can to see that he
[1:41:50] turns your hand this bride does not fear
[1:41:53] tribulation he will keep her from it I
[1:41:59] will keep it our water I'll do
[1:42:01] everything to bring it to full
[1:42:02] manifestation to where it serves its
[1:42:04] purpose
[1:42:05] a garden has a purpose purpose to be
[1:42:08] fruitful all blow winds that spices may
[1:42:10] flow thereof I've eaten my honeycomb
[1:42:11] I've drunk on my wine my milk old
[1:42:14] friends drinking abundantly where did it
[1:42:16] come from from the wife from the garden
[1:42:20] Ephesians chapter 5 verses 25 to 32
[1:42:23] husbands love your wives even as Christ
[1:42:25] also loved the church and gave himself
[1:42:27] for it he could not have given a higher
[1:42:30] standard of love and care than that
[1:42:32] standard that he might sanctify and
[1:42:36] cleanse it with the washing of water by
[1:42:38] the word I have the Lord do keep it I
[1:42:41] will water it
[1:42:43] he's the husbandman sanctify and cleanse
[1:42:46] it with the washing of water by the word
[1:42:47] that he might present it to himself a
[1:42:49] glorious church not having spot or
[1:42:51] wrinkle or any such thing but that it
[1:42:54] should be holy and without blemish so
[1:42:56] ought men to love their own wives that's
[1:43:01] how you have to love your wife so I've
[1:43:03] men to love their wives as their own
[1:43:05] bodies he that loveth his wife loveth
[1:43:07] himself for no man ever yet hated his
[1:43:10] own flesh and when you think about this
[1:43:13] Paul is very directly identifying the
[1:43:17] two types and the two perfect
[1:43:18] reflections of this note when he speaks
[1:43:20] about a woman being the flesh of a man
[1:43:23] he says no man has ever yet lovers or
[1:43:26] wise as their own bodies no man ever yet
[1:43:29] hated his own flesh he's referring to
[1:43:32] the wife and the woman to Adam was Adams
[1:43:36] flesh she had come from his flesh so no
[1:43:40] man has ever yet hated his own flesh the
[1:43:42] first men know Adam has ever hated his
[1:43:45] flesh so when the woman came forth Adam
[1:43:48] did not hate the woman he redeemed her
[1:43:50] and then now when the woman comes forth
[1:43:52] from Christ the church is his own flesh
[1:43:56] and his own blood and the last Adam does
[1:43:59] not hate his own flesh and now we are to
[1:44:04] aspire to that image as men no man ever
[1:44:08] yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth
[1:44:10] and cherisheth it even as the Lord the
[1:44:12] church for we are members of his body
[1:44:14] and of his flesh and of his bones for
[1:44:16] this cause shall a man leave his father
[1:44:18] and mother and shall be joined unto his
[1:44:20] wife and they too shall be one flesh he
[1:44:23] says this is a great mystery but I speak
[1:44:25] concerning Christ and
[1:44:27] the church where was Paul drawing the
[1:44:31] mystery from he's preaching his
[1:44:33] revelation of the mystery in the Garden
[1:44:36] of Eden he's actually identifying the
[1:44:39] original threefold purpose
[1:44:41] hid in Adam and the woman that's where
[1:44:43] he's bringing it from this is what he's
[1:44:46] challenging us as husbands and wives to
[1:44:48] attain to attain to the standard that
[1:44:50] was given before the double covenant
[1:44:52] entered in when Paul is it strike to
[1:44:54] think of all our marriage ceremonies
[1:44:56] when when we have our marriage
[1:44:57] ceremonies in the message we don't
[1:44:58] conduct them from Genesis 3 we conduct
[1:45:02] them and we use the language of Genesis
[1:45:04] chapter 2 we use the language under a
[1:45:07] single marriage covenant and this is
[1:45:10] what Paul instructs husbands under this
[1:45:12] is what he's telling he had caught the
[1:45:13] his speaking of a mystery that was
[1:45:15] manifested in Adam and the woman and
[1:45:18] progresses there is where we're faced
[1:45:20] and yet the completion of that word the
[1:45:24] finishing of that mystery there very
[1:45:26] full manifestation of what God had
[1:45:28] desired in the beginning his brother
[1:45:32] ever said about Paul his revelation then
[1:45:34] whose prophecy for today what Paul
[1:45:38] preached and what Paul taught then was
[1:45:40] actually prophecy for today you can say
[1:45:44] that all know Paul had this and Paul had
[1:45:46] that and you could take all those
[1:45:47] statements and amen amen amen it doesn't
[1:45:50] change it at all but you must recognize
[1:45:52] the prophetic element of the things that
[1:45:54] Paul taught if I could just lay this in
[1:45:57] this just food for thought when brother
[1:45:58] BAM said I preached the same gospel Paul
[1:46:00] preached he says that before the seals
[1:46:02] are open and the opening the seals was
[1:46:05] not just to repeating what Paul preached
[1:46:06] and where BAM says I preached what Paul
[1:46:10] preached he didn't just merely mean I'm
[1:46:11] just saying only what Paul said and just
[1:46:13] repeating what Paul said there was an
[1:46:15] element of prophecy to Paul's message
[1:46:18] that brother Branham fulfills his
[1:46:21] ministry fulfills of this message brings
[1:46:22] to pass and in that the entire New
[1:46:26] Testament is brought into existence in
[1:46:28] manifestation and O'Brien and his
[1:46:32] preaching of a great myth speaking of a
[1:46:33] great mystery so they're in order there
[1:46:36] to be for there to be a restoration of
[1:46:39] the original
[1:46:40] to come back a restoration back to Eden
[1:46:42] back to the original it requires a full
[1:46:45] manifestation of the Burr I know you
[1:46:47] can't just have bridegroom and you can't
[1:46:50] just even have Garden of Eden
[1:46:51] characteristics you must have a bride in
[1:46:55] order to come back to the original you
[1:46:57] must have this very image where the Lord
[1:47:00] God who planted a garden in the
[1:47:01] beginning and even a garden of God's
[1:47:03] delight the Garden of Eden even means
[1:47:05] God's delight there must be something he
[1:47:08] delights in God has that planting and
[1:47:10] then the Bible says in there he put the
[1:47:12] man whom he had formed in order for us
[1:47:15] to be facing yet the completion of that
[1:47:17] word we must have the dynamic of Christ
[1:47:19] the Tree of Life coming down into the
[1:47:22] midst of her to be united with her
[1:47:25] brother Bram says and does God change
[1:47:28] his mind he says Jesus came in three
[1:47:29] names son of man which is a prophet son
[1:47:33] of God which went through the church age
[1:47:34] then son of David but in between the son
[1:47:37] of God which is in the church age and
[1:47:40] the son of David which is in the
[1:47:41] millennium when I'm just adding that
[1:47:43] part of the church age and millennium in
[1:47:44] there according to his own word and
[1:47:46] according to Malachi 4 in many
[1:47:49] scriptures he is to return back into his
[1:47:53] church in physical form in human being
[1:47:57] in the people in human beings in the way
[1:48:00] of being a prophet so what was the very
[1:48:02] expression of manifestation of Malachi
[1:48:05] for a son of man revealing the son of
[1:48:08] man how it went is the way that he
[1:48:10] returns back into his church a son of
[1:48:12] man reveals the son of man he returns
[1:48:15] back into his church in physical
[1:48:18] physical form in the people in human
[1:48:20] beings don't just leave it in the
[1:48:23] manifestation of other Branham but he's
[1:48:25] in his people he's in human beings he's
[1:48:28] in you today
[1:48:30] what does it manifest it manifests the
[1:48:32] son of man again what is it it's him the
[1:48:35] tree of life coming back into the garden
[1:48:38] again
[1:48:40] the very people that he's formed for
[1:48:42] himself he's come back into his church
[1:48:44] in physical form
[1:48:47] revelations 3:20 this is the beautiful
[1:48:49] part of letting the label to see in
[1:48:50] church age that no other age do they
[1:48:53] have this in this age brother man call
[1:48:57] the Laodicean age the most ridiculous
[1:48:59] church age I don't want to have anything
[1:49:02] to do with Laodicea he said God didn't
[1:49:05] have one compliment for her and that's
[1:49:08] the truth and the very last order the
[1:49:11] Reformation and the messenger to the
[1:49:13] Laodicean age is bred round called the
[1:49:14] Holy Ghost in the beginning restoration
[1:49:16] against the Batchelor ghost the last or
[1:49:18] the Reformation and at this moment that
[1:49:20] these gifts are being poured out and the
[1:49:22] church is going forth with great signs
[1:49:24] and wonders a genuine outpouring a
[1:49:26] genuine Pentecost listen if they weren't
[1:49:30] who they were we can't be who we are if
[1:49:33] you make them to be nothing there's
[1:49:35] still another step that I was gonna have
[1:49:37] to come somehow from somewhere but
[1:49:39] because they were who they are we are
[1:49:41] the climax we heard the capstone and so
[1:49:44] we would never never belittle Pentecost
[1:49:46] never belittle what happened in Laodicea
[1:49:48] but God had not one good thing to say
[1:49:50] about him he calls them ridiculous
[1:49:52] brother Mammon the preview of the bride
[1:49:53] sees them descending in the chaos but at
[1:49:55] the same time they're going into chaos
[1:49:57] there's a bride in the Laodicean Church
[1:50:00] age that's going up in the existence at
[1:50:03] the same time the Laodicean ages in
[1:50:05] chaos she has been raptured up quickly
[1:50:07] to meet the Word of God and she's
[1:50:09] feeding on the unfailing body word of
[1:50:11] the son of man to give her strength to
[1:50:12] fly above all the things of the world
[1:50:14] fly above denominations and she's having
[1:50:17] this invitation in Revelations 3:20 that
[1:50:19] isn't identified anywhere else in other
[1:50:21] ages behold I stand at the door and
[1:50:24] knock showing that Christ is a fugitive
[1:50:27] to his own church he's been kicked out
[1:50:29] of the Laodicean Church age but yet he
[1:50:31] has a voice if any man hear my voice and
[1:50:34] open the door I will come in to him and
[1:50:38] will sup with him and he with me what
[1:50:41] happens when you hear that voice he
[1:50:44] comes into the garden for a feast in
[1:50:46] this endtime
[1:50:47] I will come into her to suck with her
[1:50:50] and to feast with her and build a brand
[1:50:54] and message Christ revealed in his own
[1:50:55] word will invite the musicians to come
[1:50:57] my doesn't that build expectation like
[1:50:59] oh you know what now all of a sudden
[1:51:02] people want to start a man and you know
[1:51:05] this is pretty getting pretty good now
[1:51:07] that we see the musicians all right and
[1:51:09] once you get up here you can go right
[1:51:10] back gnomes kidding no I'm gonna close
[1:51:13] just place something in your hearts
[1:51:14] there's something there if the Lord's
[1:51:19] dealt with you just want to show that
[1:51:20] confidence and the gifts that he's
[1:51:22] placed if you feel in your heart to play
[1:51:23] some she can begin to play it I just
[1:51:25] have a couple statements I want to read
[1:51:26] brother Branham says and Christ revealed
[1:51:28] in his own word he says see down through
[1:51:29] the age we started off from the
[1:51:31] foundation from the first church age
[1:51:33] when the seed went into the ground the
[1:51:34] complete seed then it come out through
[1:51:37] the feet Luther come back then through
[1:51:39] Wesley then into Pentecostals the
[1:51:41] tongues in the lips now it's in the eyes
[1:51:44] the prophetic of Malachi 4 and now
[1:51:48] there's nothing else left for it to come
[1:51:51] but him himself to step into that
[1:51:55] because that's the last thing there is
[1:51:58] the next is the intelligence and he says
[1:52:02] this just skipping a Liberty says it's
[1:52:03] God himself
[1:52:04] it's be coming to a place and he's
[1:52:08] governed the body all the way through
[1:52:11] then the complete body of Christ is
[1:52:14] revealed in the form of a bride that was
[1:52:18] taken out of his side like Adams was at
[1:52:22] the beginning you see why he calls us an
[1:52:25] astronaut age in Eagle age a bride age
[1:52:29] he's able to achieve to himself the
[1:52:31] bride
[1:52:33] when a man and a woman become one the
[1:52:38] complete body of Christ is revealed how
[1:52:41] in the form of a bride that was taken
[1:52:45] out of his side like Adams was at the
[1:52:48] beginning this is what we're completing
[1:52:50] today this is what we're fulfilling
[1:52:54] fulfilling now in this age Genesis 2:8
[1:52:58] and there he put the man whom he had
[1:53:02] formed I am come into my garden my
[1:53:07] sister my spouse that's what this
[1:53:11] message reveals to us I had this quote
[1:53:16] as we were referring to the beginning
[1:53:18] about purpose I want to inspire with you
[1:53:21] you with this state materials we close
[1:53:24] he says I join with Jove of old I know
[1:53:29] my Redeemer liveth and at the last day
[1:53:33] he shall stand on the earth
[1:53:34] it's a purpose that God has he's
[1:53:39] standing today on the earth in his
[1:53:41] people as we speak of our Lord Jesus
[1:53:44] Christ he will not set earth foot on
[1:53:46] earth in the time of this coming but
[1:53:49] it's the third coming that most people
[1:53:50] are looking to when he comes back to
[1:53:52] earth in the Millennium and he was to
[1:53:54] step on the earth physically that's when
[1:53:56] most people are expecting his coming but
[1:53:57] in the time that we're living now how
[1:54:00] else is he standing on earth except you
[1:54:02] be his bones be his flesh and the God of
[1:54:07] peace shall bruise Satan under your feet
[1:54:09] shortly so since I know my Redeemer
[1:54:12] liveth and at the last day he shall
[1:54:14] stand on the earth
[1:54:15] it's a purpose that God has and then he
[1:54:18] says with such inspiration I must serve
[1:54:21] this purpose
[1:54:23] this purpose if I could say this this
[1:54:26] purpose have been God manifested in
[1:54:28] flesh this purpose of being the
[1:54:30] completion of what he had in his mind in
[1:54:32] the beginning I must serve this purpose
[1:54:35] he says my whole life must be brought
[1:54:38] into his purpose and his program he says
[1:54:41] each of us is that way could you say in
[1:54:44] your heart today I must serve this
[1:54:47] purpose this original purpose not what
[1:54:50] man would have of me not what ideology
[1:54:53] would have of me not what the
[1:54:54] governments would have a mere politics
[1:54:56] and social media but this purpose I must
[1:55:00] avail myself to this purpose oh I want
[1:55:04] my entire being he says I must serve
[1:55:06] this purpose my whole life must be
[1:55:08] brought into his purpose and his program
[1:55:12] listen we will not have peace until this
[1:55:15] happens we must give ourselves to this
[1:55:19] to fulfill the original Oh each of us is
[1:55:22] this way my whole life must be brought
[1:55:24] into his purpose not does he want me to
[1:55:28] be a schoolteacher and does he want me
[1:55:29] to do - this doesn't mean - the purpose
[1:55:31] of being the very word of God made
[1:55:33] manifest to fulfill his original design
[1:55:36] let's stand to our feet
[1:55:39] you spray for me this afternoon I just I
[1:55:42] want to continue on this subject this is
[1:55:44] just different directions to go I look
[1:55:47] forward to an evening service just to go
[1:55:50] back over the word of the Lord again
[1:55:51] greater detail let's just bow our heads
[1:55:54] in a word of Prayer
[1:55:59] [Music]
[1:56:04] is there a hearts crying I wonder is
[1:56:09] there a soul here that's lost you'd want
[1:56:12] to give your heart to God today maybe
[1:56:15] you see the turmoil and unrest to the
[1:56:16] world Holy Spirit brought you here back
[1:56:19] slidden
[1:56:20] the Holy Spirit are you here today
[1:56:21] wondering just I want to find myself at
[1:56:25] the foot of the cross you want to give
[1:56:26] your heart to the Lord you could come to
[1:56:28] this altar you can bow your heart before
[1:56:31] the Lord now and just say Lord I I want
[1:56:33] to receive you now
[1:56:37] there's the repentance and of your sins
[1:56:39] and baptism in the name of the Lord
[1:56:41] Jesus Christ available the ones that God
[1:56:44] is calling to you have it in your heart
[1:56:48] today that through these twists and
[1:56:50] turns
[1:56:51] I know sometimes maybe we as a church
[1:56:54] here and the members of Tucson
[1:56:57] tabernacle you look back at the last
[1:56:59] five years and there's a say just just
[1:57:01] when it seems like maybe feel like we're
[1:57:03] turning a corner there's just another
[1:57:05] trouble around the bin but just when we
[1:57:08] finally seems seem to just kind of maybe
[1:57:10] be working out just another struggle
[1:57:12] another trial whether it be an economy
[1:57:15] or whether it be politics or whether it
[1:57:17] be even the the pandemic and the unrest
[1:57:21] find your peace of its Lord I don't know
[1:57:26] what the world holds I don't know what
[1:57:27] the future holds but I know you have a
[1:57:28] purpose and I want to I want my whole
[1:57:32] life to be brought in if you'd want to
[1:57:34] raise your hand sit what I want my whole
[1:57:35] life to be brought in to fulfill your

[1:58:13] that each one of us today at our own
[1:58:15] individual way as we pondered now with
[1:58:18] us the images that would come into our
[1:58:21] minds we bow our heads before you we
[1:58:24] offer them to you Lord
[1:58:26] those circumstances and situations that
[1:58:29] seemed unbreakable I yield them to a God

[1:59:02] behind it for your people Lord for it
