[44:40] i just like to as we did sunday uh this
[44:43] past weekend and we'll continue next
[44:44] sunday i'd like to go a little different
[44:46] direction tonight amen that the lord
[44:48] will be our help next wednesday
[44:50] we'll continue in the same exact
[44:52] direction so laying the groundwork
[44:54] sometimes can be can be teachy
[44:57] can take some teaching some reading amen
[44:59] but i believe that it's important amen
[45:01] brother adam said that the teaching of
[45:04] the word of god is what establishes the
[45:06] church
[45:07] amen and it's not man's opinions or his
[45:09] theories or his idea can't be
[45:11] established on his personality a man or
[45:14] his charisma it's got to be established
[45:16] on the word
[45:17] it's the only way to last
[45:19] amen and i'm glad we have his word how
[45:21] many are glad that you have his word
[45:22] tonight
[45:23] amen i certainly am we'd like to just
[45:26] read one verse in matthew chapter 16 and
[45:28] we'll be we'll just read verse 18.
[45:31] i'd like to preach to you on the acts
[45:34] experience the acts
[45:37] experience matthew 16 verse 18
[45:41] and i say unto thee
[45:43] thou art peter
[45:44] and upon this rock i will build my
[45:48] church ecclesia
[45:50] that word ecclesia means out called or
[45:53] the called out
[45:55] and so jesus says i'm going to have a
[45:57] church i'm going to build a church
[46:00] and
[46:01] and peter says jesus says who do men say
[46:03] that i am thou art christ the son of the
[46:05] living god
[46:06] and i say unto thee read it again verse
[46:08] 18 that thou art peter and upon this
[46:11] rock
[46:12] i will build my church
[46:14] and the gates of hades the gates of hell
[46:18] that encompasses
[46:20] everything every plan every scheme
[46:23] everything that satan had in mind
[46:25] jesus says that no matter from the ages
[46:28] past ages present or ages to come the
[46:32] gates of hell will not prevail that
[46:34] means today that doesn't mean satan
[46:36] won't fight that just means in the end
[46:39] we win
[46:41] i'm glad we believe that tonight
[46:43] i will build my church and the gates of
[46:45] hell shall not prevail
[46:47] against it heavenly father we're so
[46:49] grateful to be called your children
[46:52] lord it's only by your sovereign grace
[46:54] lord that you chose us
[46:56] you elected us father and we just raise
[46:59] our hands tonight lord and surrender we
[47:02] just want to say thank you lord for that
[47:04] grace tonight
[47:06] may you bless us now father bless each
[47:08] and every single individual lord those
[47:10] that are here lord those that are
[47:12] listening by stream or archive
[47:14] we pray your word would reach them
[47:17] wherever that they are at tonight now
[47:18] lord be my help i pray here tonight and
[47:21] this pulpit lord i pray that you would
[47:23] be the teacher
[47:24] father may you establish your children
[47:26] we ask in jesus name
[47:28] amen you can be seated
[47:33] i want to read that verse
[47:35] one more time just
[47:37] verse 18
[47:39] and i say unto thee thou art peter and
[47:41] upon this rock i will build my church
[47:45] and the gates of hell
[47:47] shall not prevail
[47:49] against it so jesus didn't just come to
[47:53] save people or individuals we know that
[47:56] within the plan of god he would bring
[47:59] salvation to the entire world to
[48:01] whomsoever will
[48:02] but beyond that this was what jesus said
[48:06] he was coming to build a church
[48:09] and of course we know that a church is
[48:11] not a building you know we get so used
[48:14] to saying that well what church do you
[48:16] go to well i go to this church and we
[48:18] label churches by buildings but you may
[48:20] point to a building and say that's my
[48:22] church or that's the church that i go to
[48:25] but that's not the church
[48:28] that's just a building
[48:30] and the church can be gathered inside it
[48:32] can be gathered outside in the open air
[48:35] it could be gathered uh anywhere it
[48:37] doesn't matter if you don't don't have a
[48:39] roof uh over your church the church is
[48:42] not the building uh the church is the
[48:45] people and wherever the people the bible
[48:48] says where the spirit of the lord is is
[48:50] liberty wherever two or three are
[48:51] gathered
[48:52] in my name there i'll be
[48:55] in their midst
[48:56] uh you believe that here tonight
[48:59] and so whether that those people meet in
[49:01] a building or whether they meet outside
[49:04] in the open air it's the church and
[49:07] jesus says i'll build my
[49:09] church and the gates of hell shall not
[49:12] prevail against it now we could say so
[49:14] much upon the subject and run out of
[49:16] time in a hurry and that's okay if we do
[49:18] here tonight i know we won't cover all
[49:20] of this but i just want to use these
[49:22] wednesdays that we have as a time we
[49:24] could maybe slow the pace down just a
[49:26] little bit
[49:27] and uh and just be able to to teach on
[49:30] god's word i believe it's that what we
[49:33] have uh in this age is rich amen do you
[49:37] believe that it's rich it's endless you
[49:39] know what we could we're never gonna run
[49:41] out of things to preach where are you
[49:42] gonna run out of something to preach no
[49:44] not if i'm preaching if i'm preaching my
[49:45] ideas oh yeah we'll run out quick but if
[49:48] we're preaching the word it's endless as
[49:50] we said last sunday in the ceaseless
[49:52] ages to come brother brandon said even
[49:54] in the millennium jesus will still be
[49:57] he will still
[49:58] be making himself known what does that
[50:00] mean well we'll leave that up for the
[50:02] lord to to reveal to us brother branham
[50:05] says this out of why are we not why are
[50:08] we not
[50:10] a denomination a powerful message that i
[50:12] believe uh has a great amount of
[50:15] significance
[50:16] to the believer and if you haven't heard
[50:18] it in a while i challenge you to go back
[50:19] and listen to it again
[50:21] he says but did you ever notice that
[50:24] every time a church ever fails
[50:27] and as soon as they denominate
[50:29] they start failing right then
[50:34] even and he says and whenever they fell
[50:37] god
[50:38] never raises that church again
[50:42] he says in a paragraph later god deals
[50:44] with individuals
[50:47] not with denominations
[50:49] god in no age ever dealt with a
[50:52] denomination he's always dealt
[50:56] with an individual in the old testament
[50:59] he dealt with individuals in the new
[51:01] testament he dealt with individuals god
[51:05] always deals with
[51:07] individual
[51:08] hearts
[51:09] now we'd love because their safety in
[51:11] numbers we'd love to believe that we're
[51:13] safe
[51:14] collectively but we're not we're not
[51:16] safe because of a church that we go to
[51:19] or label that we have or a last name
[51:21] that we have
[51:22] but christ deals with individuals that's
[51:26] why i said to peter who do you say that
[51:29] i am now that is probably one of the
[51:30] most important questions that can be
[51:33] asked today
[51:35] who do you say
[51:36] that i am not who does man say that i am
[51:39] not the suda that's what jesus asked him
[51:41] at first some say thou art elijah some
[51:43] say isaiah you know one of the prophets
[51:46] but jesus says now peter i've got a
[51:48] question for you but who do you say that
[51:50] i am because it doesn't matter what the
[51:52] rest of the world says or what they're
[51:54] what they what the schools of theology
[51:56] say peter all that matters is that you
[51:59] understand
[52:00] who do you say that i am peter what is
[52:03] your confession what is your testimony
[52:06] what what what have you seen what it
[52:08] what what is your understanding peter
[52:11] says i say that thou art the christ the
[52:14] son of the living god and jesus says
[52:17] flesh and blood didn't reveal this to
[52:18] you in other words you didn't learn this
[52:21] it's not something that could be taught
[52:23] but it's something that my father has
[52:25] revealed to you personally
[52:28] and upon this rock of personal
[52:31] revelation
[52:33] and you notice right when jesus says
[52:35] this he says and i say thou art peter
[52:39] in other words it's one thing to
[52:41] recognize who jesus is peter but when
[52:43] you recognize who i am you'll then
[52:46] recognize who you are
[52:49] hallelujah
[52:51] because in the identity of christ the
[52:54] groom is the identity of the bride
[52:58] and he says and i say thou art peter
[53:01] and he says and upon this rock i'll
[53:04] build my church and the gates of hell
[53:06] will not prevail against it so he was
[53:09] coming to establish something he was
[53:12] coming to start if we could say it that
[53:14] way he was coming to start something
[53:17] brother branham says here and he speaks
[53:19] about the
[53:20] the the catholic church and i said in
[53:22] the infallibility of the catholic church
[53:24] why has it changed so much see he said
[53:26] well you you he said see we you all
[53:29] believe the bible we believe the church
[53:31] he's speaking of a a a man who he spoke
[53:34] to a a catholic man
[53:36] and he says the catholic man says we
[53:38] don't care what the bible says
[53:40] it's what the church says that's exactly
[53:43] right you ever come to a showdown to it
[53:45] try it once see
[53:47] they don't care what the bible says that
[53:50] has nothing to do with it they care what
[53:54] the church says
[53:57] but we don't care brother branham says
[54:00] what the church says we believe what god
[54:02] says
[54:04] for the bible it's written let every
[54:06] man's word be a lie
[54:08] and mine be the truth that's why
[54:12] we're not a denomination
[54:14] so let me say it this way say brother
[54:16] matt what is the church as we said that
[54:18] word that jesus uses there is ecclesia
[54:22] which it means uh out called or we would
[54:25] turn that around and say the called out
[54:27] this was the church that was separate
[54:29] this this was the church that was
[54:31] separated unto the lord for himself
[54:34] let me say it to you as i i'll give some
[54:36] just rudimentary very simple principles
[54:39] about the church that jesus is talking
[54:41] to you can just mute that here for a
[54:42] moment
[54:44] about what brother branham is talking
[54:46] about let me say this the church is not
[54:48] a business
[54:50] and so many churches are ran like a
[54:53] business so many american churches are
[54:56] established today and have thousands of
[54:59] members because they've taken an
[55:01] american business model of how to be
[55:04] successful in business but let me say
[55:06] this god's church is not a business
[55:10] now obviously we have to operate under
[55:12] certain legalities and the church should
[55:15] operate its finances like a business and
[55:17] and to be a good steward over what god
[55:20] has given them but it but it ought not
[55:22] to be ran like a business
[55:25] it's not an organization come on i need
[55:27] your help tonight
[55:28] it's not an organization
[55:31] we're not a denomination we're not an
[55:33] organization
[55:34] we are the church of jesus christ which
[55:36] is the mystical body of christ
[55:39] on an individual basis
[55:41] let me say it to you this way the church
[55:44] is not an organization
[55:46] it's an organism
[55:50] it's a living organism it's not an
[55:52] organization it's a living body
[55:57] the church is not a club oh let me say
[55:59] it let me back up here just for a moment
[56:01] the message of the hour is not an
[56:03] organization
[56:07] amen wow
[56:09] should have gotten a hearty wholesome
[56:11] amen on that
[56:13] the message of the hour is not an
[56:14] organization
[56:16] it's not a denomination that doesn't
[56:18] mean men will try to denominate and
[56:20] organize but brother adam said anytime
[56:22] they did god left that system
[56:25] because as we've said over and over
[56:27] again the message of the hour the word
[56:29] of god is not teachings and doctrines
[56:32] and ink on paper and theories and ideas
[56:35] it's a person
[56:37] and he's the person of the word
[56:39] that's why paul says i fear the lest by
[56:41] any means is the serpent beguiled eve
[56:44] through his subtility so you also so he
[56:47] should also corrupt your minds from the
[56:50] simplicity that's in jesus christ
[56:52] and he said and that they would accept
[56:54] or preach another jesus
[56:58] whom we have not preached
[57:00] or believe in another jesus whom we've
[57:03] not taught
[57:06] and so you see today there's a there's
[57:08] an entire world that is preaching
[57:10] another jesus
[57:12] and and they they they define him in
[57:15] many different ways but it doesn't
[57:16] matter how the world defines jesus today
[57:20] you say well i just believe in jesus
[57:22] well which which version of jesus
[57:23] because there's a hundred of them
[57:25] million of them out there today which
[57:26] version of jesus do you believe in
[57:32] you wanna you wanna you wanna believe in
[57:33] the version of jesus that splits him
[57:35] into two or splits him into three
[57:40] which jesus paul says lest that the
[57:42] serpent who begot eve should also should
[57:45] all should also pollute your minds that
[57:48] you would accept a jesus whom we've not
[57:50] preached who is jesus today is he a
[57:53] story
[57:54] of 2 000 years ago no he's his word
[57:57] he says word expressed today that's why
[57:59] you say what is the message of the hour
[58:01] it's jesus
[58:03] it's the anointed word that's what we're
[58:06] feeding upon not a bot not a man
[58:08] not a not a not a not an organization
[58:11] but an organism a living body
[58:15] the church is not a club
[58:21] church is not a club
[58:24] it's not a religious club that you can
[58:26] join or you can get disbanded from or
[58:29] kicked out from
[58:30] you know so many churches are like
[58:32] joining the club with the club you know
[58:33] you join that club you you pay your
[58:35] yearly dues except for in church you
[58:37] just pay your weekly dues
[58:39] you know you pay your yearly dues you
[58:41] pay for your subscription you know you
[58:44] you attend the business meetings you
[58:46] have a roll call and and you keep all of
[58:48] the rules you vote at the business
[58:51] meeting but that's not a church
[58:55] church is not a club
[58:58] the church also
[59:00] isn't
[59:01] the clergy
[59:04] i'm going to enjoy the sermon even if
[59:05] you don't
[59:07] the church is not a clergy it's not the
[59:09] clergy and so many people think the
[59:11] church today is just the preachers or
[59:13] the pastors or the evangelists so come
[59:16] on friends
[59:17] it's amazing how many people view the
[59:19] church as the clergy well you know the
[59:21] church ought to do something about that
[59:23] you know what they're really saying the
[59:24] preachers ought to do something about
[59:25] that
[59:28] the preachers ought to do something
[59:29] thank god for preachers we ought to
[59:31] thank god for the for the ministry
[59:33] that'll preach the truth can you say
[59:35] amen thank god for pastors that'll teach
[59:37] the truth and rightly divide the word of
[59:40] god in a dark confusing age where the
[59:42] lines are so uh blurred everywhere that
[59:45] we look but there's a ministry that
[59:47] takes a stand upon the word of god
[59:51] let me say this god is not looking for
[59:53] ministry or just preachers he's looking
[59:55] for the manifestation of the sons and
[59:58] daughters of god
[1:00:00] who recognize their position it's time
[1:00:02] let me say it to you it's time for
[1:00:04] believers to come to their position
[1:00:07] to to to believe like you've never
[1:00:09] believed before to come under the
[1:00:11] anointing of a believer
[1:00:13] stop waiting for something to happen in
[1:00:15] the future oh well when this brother
[1:00:17] when this thing happens over here or
[1:00:19] what'll happen at this church or that
[1:00:20] church let me just say this to you my
[1:00:22] brother my sister god is moving whether
[1:00:25] i feel him or not god is moving whether
[1:00:29] you feel him or not god is on the move
[1:00:33] and whether i miss it or i make it god
[1:00:36] is still going to move
[1:00:38] and i say tonight lord don't let me miss
[1:00:40] it don't let me be
[1:00:42] lethargic in this age let me be in tune
[1:00:45] and in sync with your spirit
[1:00:48] because god's moving he's moving in all
[1:00:50] the earth he's moving in his family
[1:00:54] not just as preachers
[1:00:57] amen
[1:00:59] so what does it mean as we see the world
[1:01:02] that we're living in the day is it's a
[1:01:04] it's a day when the when prophecy is
[1:01:06] being fulfilled now i want you to look
[1:01:07] at this here in luke 18 verse 31 and you
[1:01:10] don't have to if you have a bible you
[1:01:11] can turn it they can put it up on the
[1:01:12] screen
[1:01:13] i want you to notice that that that that
[1:01:16] jesus lived and preached
[1:01:19] uh constantly he was under an awareness
[1:01:22] that his life was fulfilling a purpose
[1:01:25] now we preached to you sunday
[1:01:27] how that these men of the old testament
[1:01:29] lived a parabolic life their their life
[1:01:31] was a type or a shadow a parable you
[1:01:35] could say in a way that could be told
[1:01:37] you look at the story all the way from
[1:01:38] jesus and who was the butler represented
[1:01:41] who was the baker we don't have time to
[1:01:43] teach on that tonight but if you look at
[1:01:45] all of the stories of the bible there
[1:01:47] was they were a parable they were
[1:01:49] telling you they were foretelling
[1:01:50] something there was something they were
[1:01:53] pointing to there was something that
[1:01:55] they were expressing
[1:01:57] even all the way up to the moment that
[1:01:59] jesus says upon this rock i'll build my
[1:02:02] church and jesus lived under this
[1:02:05] fulfillment he was constantly aware that
[1:02:08] words of prophets had been spoken that
[1:02:11] the prophets had had had declared and
[1:02:14] had and had had spoken you'll read one
[1:02:16] in luke 18 verse 31
[1:02:18] he says then he took unto him the twelve
[1:02:21] and said unto them behold we go up to
[1:02:23] jerusalem notice this
[1:02:26] and all things that are written by the
[1:02:28] prophets
[1:02:29] concerning the son of man
[1:02:32] shall be accomplished
[1:02:34] so notice he was aware of this that it
[1:02:37] was that it was it was going to hinge
[1:02:39] upon the words
[1:02:41] of the prophets and i believe that the
[1:02:43] word of the prophet is vital in the age
[1:02:47] that you live in
[1:02:48] you say well we need less of the prophet
[1:02:50] let me say it to you the opposite we
[1:02:51] need more of the prophet's message
[1:02:54] we need more we need to be more grounded
[1:02:57] in the word god has sent us than we ever
[1:02:59] have before
[1:03:03] and if we're not careful we can be good
[1:03:04] things can become just so polarizing
[1:03:06] that we have a reaction against some of
[1:03:09] the
[1:03:10] those who have maybe went way too far on
[1:03:12] one side
[1:03:13] of the ditch but that doesn't mean we go
[1:03:15] to the other opposite side
[1:03:18] the brother branham said the stabilizers
[1:03:20] are already on the ship keep your eye on
[1:03:22] jesus
[1:03:24] we'll crest every wave we'll crest every
[1:03:26] single one of them it doesn't matter
[1:03:28] what fanaticism there is on the left it
[1:03:31] doesn't matter what fanaticism there is
[1:03:32] on the right keep your eye on jesus
[1:03:37] uh jesus says even on the road to emmaus
[1:03:40] now listen how important the words of
[1:03:42] the prophets were
[1:03:44] uh he says this here
[1:03:46] he says in luke 24 verse 25
[1:03:49] giving brother jeremy a good work out
[1:03:51] here we gave him one sunday and uh i
[1:03:53] think he's getting a good exercise
[1:03:55] here's his uh his uh his his hands there
[1:03:57] i'm sure are getting fatigued some of
[1:03:59] these scriptures but thank you brother
[1:04:01] uh for your for your diligence there
[1:04:03] luke 24 25
[1:04:05] uh jesus says this year he says then he
[1:04:07] said unto them oh fools now this is
[1:04:09] these on the road to emmaus
[1:04:11] he says all fools and slow of heart
[1:04:15] to believe all
[1:04:17] that the prophets
[1:04:19] have spoken
[1:04:22] oh fools and slow of heart to believe
[1:04:24] you're slow of heart to believe all that
[1:04:26] the prophets have spoken
[1:04:28] uh paul even says this here in acts 3 24
[1:04:32] he says yea
[1:04:33] and all the prophets from samuel this is
[1:04:37] acts 3 verse 24 notice what he says
[1:04:40] about these about paul speaking of
[1:04:42] prophets he says yea and all of the
[1:04:44] prophets from samuel and those that
[1:04:46] follow after
[1:04:48] as many as have spoken have likewise
[1:04:52] foretold of
[1:04:54] these days
[1:04:56] you think that god somehow finished up
[1:04:58] the bible and just said okay it's all
[1:05:00] over it's all finished
[1:05:03] now there's been something written about
[1:05:04] every age and every generation
[1:05:08] are you here tonight
[1:05:10] let me just say it to you this way if
[1:05:12] you would have lived in the days of
[1:05:13] isaiah and you believed isaiah to be a
[1:05:15] prophet you would have banked everything
[1:05:17] upon that man receiving the word of the
[1:05:20] lord for you
[1:05:21] and when he said behold a virgin shall
[1:05:23] conceive
[1:05:25] his name shall be called emmanuel prince
[1:05:28] of peace the mighty god
[1:05:30] my brother my sister if you would have
[1:05:31] believed isaiah to be an anointed
[1:05:33] prophet of god you would have sold
[1:05:35] everything you would have raised your
[1:05:36] children you would you would have done
[1:05:38] everything to sell out to the word of
[1:05:40] god and you would have come under
[1:05:42] expectation of that man's prophecy
[1:05:46] but for years and years and years and
[1:05:48] years and years and years and years and
[1:05:51] years that prophecy stays unfulfilled
[1:05:54] and unfulfilled and unfulfilled and
[1:05:55] unfulfilled and unfulfilled
[1:05:58] but there came a day
[1:06:00] when time met prophecy
[1:06:05] and it didn't matter what scoffers had
[1:06:07] said it didn't wouldn't matter what the
[1:06:08] mockers had said didn't matter what the
[1:06:10] generations past didn't matter what they
[1:06:11] had turned uh religion into that end of
[1:06:13] that day all that mattered was that
[1:06:16] prophecy was about to be fulfilled
[1:06:20] paul says this says all the prophets
[1:06:22] from samuel all those follow afters have
[1:06:24] likewise foretold of these days even
[1:06:26] john the baptist understood this and he
[1:06:29] preached the message that the prophets
[1:06:31] spoke
[1:06:33] uh he listened to me my brother my
[1:06:34] sister john didn't come with a new
[1:06:36] revelation he didn't come with some new
[1:06:38] inspiration he didn't go to a school and
[1:06:41] get it and come out of the the bible
[1:06:43] says but his life was under an anointing
[1:06:45] from the days he was in his mother's
[1:06:47] womb he was he was had the holy ghost he
[1:06:50] said what is that that means he was
[1:06:52] anointed with a mission
[1:06:54] to prepare ye the way of the lord john
[1:06:57] wasn't coming with a new message a new
[1:06:59] doctrine some new truth he preached
[1:07:02] exactly what isaiah had already spoken
[1:07:08] do you get that here tonight
[1:07:10] where did john john where did you come
[1:07:11] up with
[1:07:12] that it's right here
[1:07:15] except he'd point to his rolled up
[1:07:17] scroll
[1:07:18] it's right here uh now in those days
[1:07:20] listen what matthew 3 verse 1. uh
[1:07:22] brother jeremy if you want to put that
[1:07:24] up matthew 3
[1:07:25] verse 1 and we'll just read 1 verse 1
[1:07:27] and verse 2 and verse 3.
[1:07:29] now in those days john the baptist came
[1:07:31] preaching in the wilderness of judea
[1:07:33] saying repent
[1:07:35] repent for the kingdom of heaven is at
[1:07:38] hand for this is he that was spoken of
[1:07:43] by the prophet isaiah
[1:07:45] amen
[1:07:47] what was he doing it was already
[1:07:49] established god said i'm not going to
[1:07:50] you're not going to have to figure this
[1:07:52] out
[1:07:53] john you're not going to have to just
[1:07:54] come up with this as you go but it's
[1:07:56] already written john the only difference
[1:07:59] is is that now it's anointed to be
[1:08:01] spoken now there's an inspiration behind
[1:08:03] it and when john said prepare ye the way
[1:08:06] of the lord behold the lamb
[1:08:09] it was an anointed vindication of what
[1:08:11] isaiah already spoke though isaiah had
[1:08:14] no idea what he was saying brother
[1:08:15] brandon said when he said it
[1:08:17] brother brandon said isaiah isaiah would
[1:08:19] have scratched his head and said now
[1:08:21] wait a minute what did i just say
[1:08:25] behold a virgin shall conceive brother
[1:08:27] man and said isaiah could have scratched
[1:08:29] his head and said hold on a minute what
[1:08:30] a virgin shall conceive what was it he
[1:08:32] was under the inspiration of the holy
[1:08:34] spirit
[1:08:35] when david begins to speak and say my
[1:08:37] bones stare at me says behold how they
[1:08:39] laugh and they mock me
[1:08:41] he had he had no idea he was he had no
[1:08:44] idea was under the inspiration of the
[1:08:46] messiah
[1:08:47] he was under the inspiration of the
[1:08:48] almighty when david says you'll not
[1:08:51] leave his soul in hell neither allow
[1:08:52] your holy one to see corruption david
[1:08:55] pinned that on a piece of paper looked
[1:08:57] at it and might have thought my that's
[1:08:58] so profound but what does it mean
[1:09:04] and you know what happened to that it
[1:09:05] got rolled up got scrolled up
[1:09:09] got strolled up somewhere and it sat for
[1:09:11] years and years and years until when
[1:09:14] until the son of god was in the belly of
[1:09:17] the earth and the bible says you'll not
[1:09:19] leave his soul in hell neither allow
[1:09:21] your holy one to see corruption and
[1:09:23] words that had been pinned hundreds of
[1:09:25] years before suddenly came to life
[1:09:30] it was the words of the prophets listen
[1:09:32] to what he says here
[1:09:34] jesus he said saying repent for the
[1:09:36] kingdom of heaven for this is the one
[1:09:37] notice this is what isaiah the prophet
[1:09:39] said the voice of one crying in the
[1:09:41] wilderness put up verse three if you
[1:09:43] could brother jeremy make way make ready
[1:09:47] what it means there he says prepare ye
[1:09:49] the way of the lord
[1:09:51] prepare ye the way of the lord make his
[1:09:55] paths
[1:09:56] straight
[1:09:59] you see what the church needs today is
[1:10:01] not new doctrine
[1:10:04] we don't need new ideas
[1:10:07] although we love new ideas
[1:10:12] people love something new
[1:10:15] they love something shiny
[1:10:17] they they they love some new revelation
[1:10:19] or new new kind of thing here listen to
[1:10:20] my listening my brother we don't we
[1:10:22] don't need something new
[1:10:24] we need a revival which is a stirring of
[1:10:27] what we already have
[1:10:29] said brother matt does that mean god
[1:10:30] doesn't keep revealing himself
[1:10:32] absolutely that's not what i'm saying
[1:10:33] here today
[1:10:35] but what i'm saying to you is that god
[1:10:36] has god has already given us a word
[1:10:40] when are we going to believe that word
[1:10:43] when's that word going to become real
[1:10:45] when's it going to become more of
[1:10:47] brother branham said when's it going to
[1:10:48] be say when can we say this is what
[1:10:50] brother branham said
[1:10:52] i'm living what the prophet has already
[1:10:54] spoken
[1:10:56] you say what who is the message i am the
[1:10:58] message
[1:11:00] do you realize today my brother this is
[1:11:02] exactly what john was saying here we
[1:11:05] don't need to we don't need something
[1:11:06] new uh we don't like the world the bible
[1:11:09] says they'll keep to themselves teachers
[1:11:12] having itching ears
[1:11:15] because there's something always in man
[1:11:17] he always wants something novel
[1:11:19] something he could bring to himself some
[1:11:21] kind of new idea or a new way it's just
[1:11:23] sad that he won't accept god's provided
[1:11:25] way
[1:11:27] the way god already provided are you
[1:11:29] here tonight
[1:11:31] it's not something new it's not some
[1:11:33] kind of new idea
[1:11:35] let me just let me say this and it's
[1:11:37] going to be i'm not going to be able to
[1:11:38] qualify it right now so i'll just trust
[1:11:40] me i'll qualify it later
[1:11:42] brother branham didn't come the message
[1:11:44] of the hour never came with the intent
[1:11:47] or purpose at all to bring something
[1:11:52] new that wasn't the malachi 4 ministry
[1:11:59] brother branham says
[1:12:00] it would be these divinely revealed
[1:12:04] truths what truths
[1:12:08] what truths
[1:12:10] it would be these divinely revealed
[1:12:13] mystery truths that would literally turn
[1:12:17] the hearts of the children back to the
[1:12:18] faith of the fathers
[1:12:21] and it wouldn't be new ideas it would be
[1:12:23] a restoration of what was lost
[1:12:26] that's what redemption is all about
[1:12:36] even you we could we could list
[1:12:38] scripture after scripture we're going to
[1:12:40] take just a moment to do that
[1:12:43] the events you find in the gospels
[1:12:47] the unfolding
[1:12:48] events in an order that was spoken so
[1:12:52] many times you'll read this when you go
[1:12:54] through the gospels especially and it
[1:12:56] was so that the words of jeremiah could
[1:12:59] be fulfilled so that the words of isaiah
[1:13:02] could be fulfilled so that the words
[1:13:04] could be
[1:13:05] fulfilled this is exactly what you read
[1:13:07] about time and time and time again
[1:13:09] matthew chapter 8
[1:13:11] verse 16 just one scripture matthew
[1:13:13] chapter 8
[1:13:15] and if you have a bible you're welcome
[1:13:17] to turn there if you can get there
[1:13:18] quickly
[1:13:20] when the even was come they brought unto
[1:13:21] him many that were possessed with devils
[1:13:24] and he cast out the spirits
[1:13:26] with his word
[1:13:28] and healed all that were sick verse 17.
[1:13:36] next verse there brother jeremy that it
[1:13:38] might be fulfilled
[1:13:40] notice that
[1:13:42] that it might be
[1:13:45] fulfilled
[1:13:46] which was spoken already
[1:13:50] so here's a modern day event and you say
[1:13:53] why did it have to happen because words
[1:13:56] had to be fulfilled
[1:13:58] that it might be fulfilled which was
[1:14:00] spoken by isaiah the prophet saying
[1:14:02] himself uh
[1:14:04] saying saiyan himself took our
[1:14:06] infirmities and bore our
[1:14:08] sicknesses matthew 12 15
[1:14:11] uh jesus aware of this withdrew from
[1:14:14] there many followed him and healed them
[1:14:15] and he warned them not to make them
[1:14:17] known this is matthew 12. he says but
[1:14:19] when jesus knew he threw himself from
[1:14:20] thence and great multitudes followed him
[1:14:22] and he killed them all verse 16
[1:14:24] and and then charged them that they
[1:14:26] should not make him known verse 17
[1:14:28] that it might be fulfilled which was
[1:14:31] spoken by isaias the prophet
[1:14:36] you see god doesn't let his prophet's
[1:14:38] words go to waste
[1:14:40] god doesn't let his prophet's word just
[1:14:42] stay idle
[1:14:44] though though time may delay and delay
[1:14:46] and delay but yet god has a perfect
[1:14:49] season and a perfect time for everything
[1:14:51] and in that moment there will be a
[1:14:53] believer who believes it there will be a
[1:14:55] believer who's expecting it there will
[1:14:57] be a believer who's an anticipation for
[1:15:00] it
[1:15:01] hallelujah
[1:15:05] that it might be
[1:15:07] fulfilled
[1:15:08] isaiah
[1:15:11] you had no idea
[1:15:14] isaiah what you were seeing in vision
[1:15:17] what you were seeing of a messiah what
[1:15:19] you were seeing and and even what isaiah
[1:15:22] would would speak seeing the messiah
[1:15:25] seeing the vision seeing the vision what
[1:15:27] the lord begins to say here i want you
[1:15:29] to notice this
[1:15:30] uh let's listen and then we're gonna
[1:15:32] we're gonna get to our thought here in
[1:15:33] just a moment and if we run out of time
[1:15:35] we just will brother jeremy you could
[1:15:36] put up that powerpoint here for a moment
[1:15:40] so this is exactly what
[1:15:42] brother adam says this here about this
[1:15:45] first church now what do we find
[1:15:47] uh in acts and if i i don't know if this
[1:15:50] will work i'll try it if it if it does
[1:15:52] work wonderful no it doesn't because i
[1:15:55] can't blink oh i can't it can can you
[1:15:57] blank that for me just here for a moment
[1:15:59] it's a tendency to to read
[1:16:02] i want you to look at this and we're
[1:16:04] going to just have to just slow down
[1:16:05] here for just a moment
[1:16:07] but what do you have when you have this
[1:16:10] book of acts i want you to turn to acts
[1:16:12] 1 1 just quickly if you could
[1:16:15] acts 1 1
[1:16:16] and we're just going to read just a just
[1:16:18] this first verse here
[1:16:22] or we'll read a few of them the former
[1:16:24] treaties verse 1 the former treaties
[1:16:27] have i made
[1:16:29] o theophilus of all that jesus began
[1:16:33] both to do
[1:16:35] and to teach so what was this this was
[1:16:38] the writer of this book was a man
[1:16:41] named luke now luke was a gentile he was
[1:16:45] a greek he never this this man luke is
[1:16:48] the only gentile writer in the entire
[1:16:51] bible you'll only find this one gentile
[1:16:54] writer 40 different authors of the bible
[1:16:59] 39 were jewish
[1:17:02] what
[1:17:03] what does that mean hebrew thinkers
[1:17:05] but luke so luke gets most of his
[1:17:08] material from jewish writers but he
[1:17:10] himself was a gentile not one of the
[1:17:13] twelve he never knew jesus uh the the
[1:17:16] bible the historians of biblical
[1:17:18] historians believe he was converted 20
[1:17:20] years
[1:17:21] after the ascension of jesus but he
[1:17:24] learns everything through what he reads
[1:17:27] he learns everything through what now
[1:17:29] listen to me very closely here because
[1:17:31] you're going to find out something so
[1:17:32] amazing about this writer
[1:17:34] luke was a physician
[1:17:37] he was a doctor
[1:17:40] and doctors are very
[1:17:42] now this was very intentional god chose
[1:17:45] this man very
[1:17:46] specifically
[1:17:48] who's going to write this
[1:17:51] book of acts the man who we're reading
[1:17:53] here when he says the former treaties
[1:17:56] have i made old theophilus that's that's
[1:17:58] his book the former treaties was his
[1:18:00] record the former record the record the
[1:18:02] book of luke this is exactly what he's
[1:18:04] going to say the former treaties have i
[1:18:07] made the former record i'm witnessing
[1:18:10] i'm attesting to it uh he says he says
[1:18:13] um the former treaties that i've made of
[1:18:15] all that jesus began both to do and to
[1:18:17] teach verse two we'll just keep reading
[1:18:20] here
[1:18:21] until the day
[1:18:23] and which he was taken up after that he
[1:18:26] through the holy ghost had given
[1:18:28] commandments unto the apostles whom he
[1:18:30] had chosen to whom also he showed
[1:18:33] himself alive after his passion by many
[1:18:36] infallible proofs being seen of them 40
[1:18:40] days and speaking of things pertaining
[1:18:42] to the kingdom of god and being
[1:18:45] assembled together with them commanded
[1:18:47] them that they should not depart from
[1:18:49] jerusalem but wait for the promise of
[1:18:51] the father now this is important i'm
[1:18:52] going to take take time to read it
[1:18:54] because we're going to we're going to
[1:18:55] refer back to this he says being
[1:18:58] assembled together with them commanded
[1:18:59] them they should not depart from
[1:19:01] jerusalem but wait for the promise of
[1:19:04] the father
[1:19:05] which saith he you have heard of me
[1:19:08] for john truly baptized with water but
[1:19:12] you shall be baptized with the holy
[1:19:15] ghost
[1:19:16] not many days hence
[1:19:19] now this is something further something
[1:19:22] more than what they had already received
[1:19:25] this was this was something more jesus
[1:19:27] says in john 7 he says he that believeth
[1:19:30] in me shall out of his belly flow rivers
[1:19:33] of living water
[1:19:34] and then in parentheses there in your
[1:19:36] scope of your king james bible it says
[1:19:38] this spoke he of the spirit which had
[1:19:41] not been given yet
[1:19:44] because here jesus was still fulfilling
[1:19:46] his earthly ministry he had it ascended
[1:19:49] and a spirit hadn't came back but this
[1:19:51] was the promise of the father he says
[1:19:54] when they work listen to what he says
[1:19:55] verse 5 again for john truly baptized
[1:19:57] with water but you shall be baptized
[1:20:00] with the holy ghost not many days hence
[1:20:02] when they therefore were come together
[1:20:04] they asked of him saying lord without
[1:20:05] this time
[1:20:06] restore again the kingdom to israel and
[1:20:09] he said it's not for you to know the
[1:20:10] times or season which the father has put
[1:20:12] in his own power but you you shall
[1:20:16] receive something
[1:20:20] it's going to be more than my words
[1:20:23] it's going to be more than my miracles
[1:20:25] it's going to be more than testimonies
[1:20:27] you shall receive
[1:20:29] greek word
[1:20:30] dunamis
[1:20:33] brother adam takes that up what is
[1:20:34] dunamis english words root english word
[1:20:37] is dynamite
[1:20:40] but you shall receive
[1:20:42] dynamite glory
[1:20:45] after that the holy ghost has come upon
[1:20:47] you shall be witnesses unto me both in
[1:20:49] jerusalem and in all judea and in
[1:20:52] samaria even to the uttermost part of
[1:20:54] the earth and when they had spoken these
[1:20:56] things while they behold he was taken up
[1:20:58] and a god received him out of their
[1:21:00] sight and while they looked steadfastly
[1:21:02] towards heaven as he went up behold two
[1:21:03] men stood by them now listen this was a
[1:21:06] doctor who wrote this book this was a
[1:21:08] man who was very
[1:21:10] careful
[1:21:11] to
[1:21:12] details
[1:21:15] and this is the man
[1:21:17] who testifies
[1:21:19] of the virgin birth
[1:21:23] god uses a doctor to testify to the
[1:21:25] world of a virgin birth
[1:21:31] you know how i sat down with mary
[1:21:34] investigated what happened
[1:21:35] also notice he used the doctor to
[1:21:39] describe
[1:21:40] the miracles
[1:21:43] of jesus
[1:21:47] a doctor you think god was an accident
[1:21:49] no
[1:21:50] a doctor who is very very
[1:21:53] specific in detail
[1:21:56] and so he's going to say the former
[1:21:58] treaties my book
[1:22:00] my record
[1:22:02] he says the former treaties haven't made
[1:22:03] verse one brother jeremy the the the the
[1:22:06] former treaties
[1:22:08] that i have i made a theophilus of all
[1:22:10] that jesus began to do and to teach so
[1:22:12] what was this book of acts it was going
[1:22:14] to be the first church it was going to
[1:22:17] be the original church it was going to
[1:22:19] be what jesus spoke of when he said i'll
[1:22:22] build my church
[1:22:24] prophetically this was the church he was
[1:22:26] speaking of
[1:22:28] brother branham said it was this
[1:22:29] original first ephesian age
[1:22:33] or what we call the alpha
[1:22:35] church age
[1:22:36] the alpha meaning the beginning jesus
[1:22:39] says i am the alpha and i'm the omega i
[1:22:42] am the beginning i am the end i am the
[1:22:45] first i am the last
[1:22:48] and he's everything in the middle too
[1:22:51] but he says there would be something
[1:22:52] significant about the first
[1:22:54] there would be something significant
[1:22:56] about the last
[1:22:57] because the alpha would mirror the omega
[1:23:01] the omega would mirror the alpha
[1:23:04] because what do you have in the alpha
[1:23:07] you have the seed you have the genesis
[1:23:10] of the new testament
[1:23:13] are you with me here
[1:23:14] you have the alpha church you have the
[1:23:17] seed church what do you read when you
[1:23:20] read your bible and you open up the book
[1:23:22] of acts you're reading
[1:23:23] the beginning
[1:23:26] amen
[1:23:27] you're reading the beginning
[1:23:29] of the church
[1:23:31] this is what it meant it was the book of
[1:23:33] acts church the first church the
[1:23:35] ephesian church the seed church
[1:23:39] and god was going to do something listen
[1:23:41] to what brother branham says here and
[1:23:42] i'm just going to establish this with
[1:23:44] some quotes and then we'll pick this up
[1:23:46] listen what brother branham says brother
[1:23:48] jeremy you can display that uh this is
[1:23:50] out of the ephesian church age now
[1:23:52] he says it says here it is
[1:23:55] and on can you see that all in the back
[1:23:58] an unchanging god listen to how he's
[1:24:01] going to frame this because it's
[1:24:02] important
[1:24:03] with unchanging
[1:24:06] ways
[1:24:08] what he did at the first
[1:24:12] now when you read that word
[1:24:14] genesis
[1:24:16] seed
[1:24:18] beginning
[1:24:20] alpha
[1:24:22] what he did at the first
[1:24:25] he will have to keep on doing
[1:24:28] until it is done for the last
[1:24:33] the end
[1:24:34] the omega
[1:24:36] the the harvest
[1:24:39] the fruition
[1:24:41] the final
[1:24:43] what are we we're the final voice
[1:24:46] to the final age
[1:24:48] what did the prophet god preached when
[1:24:50] he preached the the the restoration of
[1:24:52] the bride tree church and he said that
[1:24:54] little church and he gives us the
[1:24:56] example of the stalk the wheat plant and
[1:24:59] he says that seed that was at the
[1:25:01] beginning
[1:25:02] died
[1:25:04] what does brother brandon mean when he
[1:25:05] says that now i'm going to have to slow
[1:25:06] down here because i don't want to gloss
[1:25:08] over this
[1:25:09] and we said we're going to teach and
[1:25:10] everyone's going ah brother matt you're
[1:25:12] not doing too much teaching
[1:25:15] let me slow down can i do that
[1:25:17] what does brother branham have here he
[1:25:19] has this picture of this bride tree and
[1:25:20] he says it's a stalk it's like a wheat
[1:25:23] stalk and he says in the in the in the
[1:25:25] in the ground is the seed what was that
[1:25:27] seed it was the first church
[1:25:30] it was that ephesian
[1:25:32] church age that book of acts
[1:25:35] church
[1:25:36] what does brother branham mean when he
[1:25:38] refers to this that first seed
[1:25:41] that first church now the ephesian
[1:25:43] church dies we know that
[1:25:45] it ends in a in a in a very different
[1:25:48] way than how it starts
[1:25:51] paul begins to say this that i fear
[1:25:53] after i'm gone after my departing
[1:25:54] grievous woods will come in not sparing
[1:25:57] the flock and that's exactly what
[1:25:58] happens
[1:25:59] paul says it comes and says you did run
[1:26:01] well speaking and it to the galatians he
[1:26:03] says oh you foolish galatians who has
[1:26:05] bewitched you
[1:26:07] and so we know that first age brother
[1:26:09] adam says ends in death he says ephesus
[1:26:11] even the city he said it it means
[1:26:14] drifting dying wondering
[1:26:16] and he says and it ends with just a
[1:26:18] squall a little village of believers and
[1:26:21] brother branham actually stops and says
[1:26:23] now that first church
[1:26:25] starts in purity
[1:26:28] for just a short
[1:26:30] little while for just a short time it
[1:26:33] walks in purity forget the the the
[1:26:35] duration brother branham gives there for
[1:26:37] just a short duration that walks in
[1:26:39] purity says but not before long he says
[1:26:42] that same church becomes the the the
[1:26:46] tree of the book of revelations of every
[1:26:48] fallen unclean and hateful bird
[1:26:51] and jude the very last book before the
[1:26:54] book of revelation says
[1:26:56] brothers
[1:26:58] when i thought it necessary to write
[1:27:00] unto you of the common salvation
[1:27:03] it was needful that i exhort you until
[1:27:05] you earnestly contend for what we all
[1:27:08] received
[1:27:10] that's what you read in jude earnestly
[1:27:12] contend for the faith now what had
[1:27:14] happened there's such a different
[1:27:15] temperature
[1:27:17] from acts 1 1
[1:27:20] and jude 1.
[1:27:22] i thought it need for to write unto you
[1:27:23] of the common salvation this is a man
[1:27:25] writing a letter but it was needful that
[1:27:27] i exhort you and tell you brothers
[1:27:30] you're going to have to fight
[1:27:33] you're going to have to contend
[1:27:34] you're going to have to earnestly
[1:27:36] contend for the faith that was once
[1:27:39] delivered
[1:27:40] to the saints
[1:27:42] brother branham says what was that one
[1:27:43] faith that jude was speaking of peter's
[1:27:46] message
[1:27:48] repent be baptized every one of you in
[1:27:49] the name of the lord jesus christ amen
[1:27:52] brother adam says it was one message one
[1:27:55] time
[1:27:56] and he says in it it never needed to be
[1:27:58] changed it was a pattern so what was god
[1:28:01] going to do in the first age the
[1:28:03] ephesian age he was going to start a
[1:28:06] pattern
[1:28:07] and brother branham stops now i've said
[1:28:09] it a lot but let me pick it up here he
[1:28:10] says first we'll have to keep on until
[1:28:12] the last time there will never be a
[1:28:15] change apply that to the church ages
[1:28:19] the kind of man that god chose for the
[1:28:21] first age and how god manifested in that
[1:28:24] man's ministry would be the example for
[1:28:26] all other ages
[1:28:27] what god did in the first church age
[1:28:32] is what he wants to do in all
[1:28:36] other
[1:28:37] ages
[1:28:39] now that first church jesus said unless
[1:28:41] a corn unless a seed unless a corn of
[1:28:43] wheat
[1:28:44] goes into the ground and dies it abideth
[1:28:47] alone
[1:28:48] and brother madam says what what why why
[1:28:50] did that first church age fall so that
[1:28:52] there could be a second church age so
[1:28:54] that there could be a third church age
[1:28:56] so that there could be a fourth tree and
[1:28:57] he said in all of those ages they were a
[1:28:59] restoration of the truth
[1:29:02] notice it was all that the palmer worm
[1:29:04] all that the cankerworm all that the
[1:29:06] caterpillar i will joel's message i will
[1:29:09] restore saith the lord
[1:29:14] and so he gives back redemption is
[1:29:16] giving back it's a restoration back i
[1:29:19] don't want you to miss that here because
[1:29:21] it's important to what the message of
[1:29:23] the hour
[1:29:24] was and is
[1:29:27] it's a restoration back
[1:29:31] are you with me
[1:29:32] and he says there will never be a change
[1:29:34] listen to this next quote here now we
[1:29:37] know exactly from the word which was
[1:29:39] recorded by the holy spirit how the
[1:29:42] first
[1:29:44] someone say first
[1:29:47] three people okay i didn't mean to say
[1:29:49] someone everybody say first
[1:29:52] he says how the first or
[1:29:55] original church was founded
[1:29:57] and how god manifested himself in her
[1:30:00] thus
[1:30:01] what the church was at
[1:30:04] pentecost is
[1:30:07] yesterday we don't need that anymore no
[1:30:09] no no
[1:30:11] can't noah noah couldn't uh preach moses
[1:30:14] couldn't preach noah's message getting a
[1:30:15] boat and float down the nile no we don't
[1:30:17] need that anymore we don't need that the
[1:30:19] days of miracles are passed that's
[1:30:20] really what you're saying
[1:30:22] it's the same spirit
[1:30:25] he says that's what the church was at
[1:30:27] pentecost now notice not 1906 azusa
[1:30:30] street
[1:30:32] not the welch revival not daddy seymour
[1:30:34] that's not pentecost
[1:30:37] that was a restoration of gifts brother
[1:30:39] branham says what the church was
[1:30:41] at pentecost
[1:30:44] acts
[1:30:45] the acts experience
[1:30:48] are you here
[1:30:50] is the standard that is the
[1:30:54] pattern
[1:30:56] there is no other pattern
[1:31:00] there is no other pattern
[1:31:02] there is no other pattern
[1:31:06] i love that brother brandon said that
[1:31:07] thank you for saying that i don't have
[1:31:08] to say it i'm just repeating it there is
[1:31:10] no other pattern god has not
[1:31:13] changed that
[1:31:15] pattern
[1:31:17] what god did at pentecost
[1:31:20] first
[1:31:21] seed genesis beginning
[1:31:24] he has to keep on doing until the church
[1:31:29] captioning ages close
[1:31:43] is over don't you believe it
[1:31:46] really simple
[1:31:47] secondly they referred to an age of
[1:31:49] manifested holy ghost powers being over
[1:31:51] since the bible has been completed i
[1:31:53] love this simple straightforward direct
[1:31:56] answer that is
[1:31:58] untrue
[1:32:00] can you say amen
[1:32:02] the promise of power
[1:32:04] with which the apostles were endued at
[1:32:08] pentecost is to you jews to your
[1:32:11] children jews to all them that are far
[1:32:14] off
[1:32:16] and to as many as the lord our god shall
[1:32:19] call both jew and gentile until he stops
[1:32:24] calling the pentecostal message in power
[1:32:28] will
[1:32:29] not
[1:32:30] cease
[1:32:35] what the church had listen to what he
[1:32:37] says here what the church had at
[1:32:39] pentecost
[1:32:40] is her you me
[1:32:44] inalienable right
[1:32:47] everyone wants to talk about rights
[1:32:48] today did you know you got a right
[1:32:51] you got a right to everything god gave
[1:32:53] you
[1:32:54] and you don't let no man or no teacher
[1:32:56] or no doctrine no theory not me not
[1:32:58] anybody take it away from you it is your
[1:33:01] inalienable right
[1:33:04] brother adam said that's what god said
[1:33:05] to joshua what wherever the soul of your
[1:33:08] feet touch
[1:33:10] that's yours and don't let anybody take
[1:33:12] it from you you say what's the soul of
[1:33:14] my feet it's my revelation whatever god
[1:33:17] has given to me no man can take away
[1:33:19] from me it's my inalienable right
[1:33:22] originally she had the pure word of god
[1:33:24] she had the power of the spirit
[1:33:27] manifested in diverse signs and wonders
[1:33:30] and gifts of the holy ghost amen brother
[1:33:33] branham
[1:33:34] that original church was not organized
[1:33:37] by men it was led by the holy ghost
[1:33:41] it wasn't very big
[1:33:42] it was hated and despised it was
[1:33:44] oppressed it was persecuted unto death
[1:33:46] but it was true to god it stayed with
[1:33:49] the original word pattern
[1:33:52] i want to stay with the original word
[1:33:55] pattern
[1:33:56] what was that first church it was the
[1:33:58] seed church the alpha church you can
[1:34:00] back up brother jeremy the alpha church
[1:34:03] the beginning church the the the seed
[1:34:06] church
[1:34:08] who was it for it was for believers
[1:34:11] it's not for unbelievers
[1:34:13] it's not for make believers it's for the
[1:34:15] elected family of god
[1:34:18] it's amazing because the bible the the
[1:34:19] beginning verse says
[1:34:21] that the former treaties have i made oh
[1:34:24] theophilus you know
[1:34:25] the brother man doesn't say much about
[1:34:27] this man theophilus the bible actually
[1:34:28] doesn't say much about this man
[1:34:30] theophilus the best we have is that this
[1:34:33] man i want you to notice this here this
[1:34:36] this man theophilus his name means
[1:34:39] friend of god
[1:34:42] did you know luke wrote this book
[1:34:45] for one person
[1:34:49] hallelujah that's right
[1:34:51] did you know all of this book this is
[1:34:53] who it was addressed to
[1:34:55] it's important that you catch that
[1:34:57] the book of acts was addressed to one
[1:35:00] man
[1:35:02] it's not like the gospels whose address
[1:35:05] to many to the multitudes to the
[1:35:07] thousands
[1:35:08] theophilus you know what theophilus
[1:35:09] sounds a lot like to me theophany
[1:35:14] former treaties have a nato theophany
[1:35:16] oriole theophilus notice luke writes his
[1:35:18] entire gospel this entire book to one
[1:35:22] person oh my brother my sister the book
[1:35:24] of acts is to one elected lady the rest
[1:35:27] of the world may not know what to do
[1:35:28] with it but the by the but the bride
[1:35:30] knows what god wants done with his word
[1:35:33] it's a revelation done to her
[1:35:35] and it speaks to beyond your senses the
[1:35:38] word speaks to beyond your ears beyond
[1:35:40] your mind or your intellect it goes to
[1:35:42] your theophany to the seed gene of god
[1:35:45] down inside of you and something in you
[1:35:47] says i believe it i'm a believer i can't
[1:35:50] explain it but i can't understand it all
[1:35:53] i know is that i believe it
[1:35:55] amen hallelujah what does amen mean so
[1:35:58] be it lord i may not understand it but i
[1:36:01] believe it
[1:36:03] he wrote it for one man theophilus
[1:36:08] elected
[1:36:11] chosen
[1:36:12] before the foundation of the world
[1:36:15] chosen in god
[1:36:17] oh this is exactly what the prophet of
[1:36:19] god says here it was that first
[1:36:21] inheritance that first original church
[1:36:24] that first experience that new testament
[1:36:27] church jesus says i will
[1:36:30] build
[1:36:31] my
[1:36:32] church
[1:36:35] thus what the church was at pentecost is
[1:36:38] her inalienable right
[1:36:45] it's her
[1:36:47] inalienable
[1:36:50] right i love how the prophet of god says
[1:36:52] that he says it's it's a it wasn't
[1:36:54] organized by men
[1:36:56] that's why we said the message is not an
[1:36:58] organization
[1:37:02] the message is not it was brother adam
[1:37:04] says it was i mean yeah the prophet of
[1:37:06] god says this church book it was led of
[1:37:08] the holy ghost
[1:37:10] wasn't very big it was hated in despise
[1:37:12] it was oppressed it was persecuted unto
[1:37:14] death but it was true to god it stayed
[1:37:16] with the original word
[1:37:18] pattern so there was a pattern that was
[1:37:20] sent forth
[1:37:21] there was something god set forth there
[1:37:24] was a there was a pattern it was going
[1:37:26] to follow in all other ages
[1:37:31] and brother adam says history would keep
[1:37:33] repeating itself
[1:37:34] in the generation of israel we see
[1:37:36] revival in one generation only to see
[1:37:38] the fire is fading that's the next slide
[1:37:40] only to see the fires fading in the next
[1:37:43] and the third generation embers may be
[1:37:44] glowing slightly but in the fourth there
[1:37:46] may be no vestiges whatsoever that
[1:37:47] original flame then god lights the fire
[1:37:51] again
[1:37:52] and the same process is repeated it's
[1:37:55] simply the manifestation of the truth
[1:37:57] that god has no grandchildren salvation
[1:38:00] is not passed on by natural birth
[1:38:05] what does brother brandon point to he
[1:38:06] says that that revival that died that
[1:38:09] first age that died he says then god
[1:38:11] lights the fire again the same process
[1:38:13] is repeated what is it it's the
[1:38:15] manifestation that that the message
[1:38:17] within and of itself just
[1:38:20] that revival doesn't sustain itself
[1:38:24] but every generation has to be baptized
[1:38:26] with the same pentecostal experience
[1:38:32] i know you get into the weeds there
[1:38:33] sometimes when you say that but it's
[1:38:34] just what the prophet of god said
[1:38:38] and and i know we've defined and people
[1:38:40] has defined pentecostal experience means
[1:38:42] this or it means that well you say
[1:38:44] brother matt what does it mean it's
[1:38:45] exactly what it means it means
[1:38:46] experience
[1:38:49] that you experience god
[1:38:53] and you say how do i know i've
[1:38:55] experienced god very simple you're
[1:38:58] changed
[1:39:01] when you have an encounter with god if
[1:39:03] it's really not when you encounter when
[1:39:05] you open up your bible and you
[1:39:06] intellectually understand it and read it
[1:39:08] and hear it you can do that satan does
[1:39:10] it too it's good
[1:39:12] it's profitable
[1:39:14] but when you have an encounter with god
[1:39:18] you're different
[1:39:21] you go walk out in the street in front
[1:39:22] of a semi truck you know what you're
[1:39:24] having you're having an encounter with a
[1:39:26] semi-truck and i promise you you will
[1:39:29] forever be changed by that encounter and
[1:39:31] when you encounter god you are forever
[1:39:34] changed
[1:39:36] when you have a collision with god he
[1:39:39] changes you
[1:39:40] in ways that you couldn't change
[1:39:41] yourself
[1:39:43] you say how do i know brother ma i know
[1:39:45] because i'm not brother as the woman
[1:39:46] said i may not be who i want to be but i
[1:39:48] know i'm not who i used to be
[1:39:51] there's something different in me
[1:39:52] there's been a change in me i've
[1:39:54] experienced god
[1:39:58] they're not the same anymore listen to
[1:39:59] what brother adam says they're not
[1:40:01] christians you have to be born of the
[1:40:02] will of god not the will of man the
[1:40:04] previous slide he says not the will of
[1:40:07] man to be saved but the original fires
[1:40:09] died down they're not the same
[1:40:11] anymore
[1:40:16] they're not the same anymore
[1:40:19] something's changed something's died
[1:40:21] that experience go to the next slide the
[1:40:24] fervent desire to please god the passion
[1:40:27] and those word the cry for reaching out
[1:40:29] of the spirit all begins to fade and
[1:40:31] instead of that church being on fire
[1:40:33] with the fire of god it's cooled off
[1:40:36] and became a bit formal
[1:40:39] that's what was happening back there to
[1:40:40] the ephesians they were getting a bit
[1:40:43] formal
[1:40:45] the abandonment to god was dying out and
[1:40:46] the people weren't too careful about
[1:40:48] what god thought of them as they begin
[1:40:49] to be careful about what the world
[1:40:50] thought
[1:40:53] next slide
[1:40:55] that second generation coming on was
[1:40:57] just like israel they demanded a king to
[1:40:59] be like the other nations when they did
[1:41:01] that they rejected god but they did it
[1:41:02] anyway that is the history of
[1:41:06] the church
[1:41:08] of jesus christ
[1:41:11] you see within that book of acts seed
[1:41:13] gospel church
[1:41:15] you keep reading that book of acts
[1:41:17] as god begin to thin down the numbers
[1:41:20] and many the bible says many problems
[1:41:24] many issues
[1:41:26] he said brother matt what does that mean
[1:41:27] one age leads to the next stage to the
[1:41:29] next stage but brother adam says there's
[1:41:30] nothing beyond this
[1:41:33] there's no eighth eighth messenger
[1:41:35] beyond this
[1:41:38] the only thing after this is a harvest
[1:41:42] i want to close here just for a moment
[1:41:44] and bring you back to what we were
[1:41:46] reading in isaiah
[1:41:48] isaiah 21 2 brother jeremy if you want
[1:41:50] to put that on the screen and we'll hold
[1:41:51] that till next wednesday
[1:41:54] isaiah 21 2 i want you to see what
[1:41:56] isaiah though he sees this future
[1:42:00] messiah
[1:42:02] and it was all based upon the words of
[1:42:03] the prophet
[1:42:05] uh the prophet by the bible says that he
[1:42:07] looks into the future now the by the
[1:42:10] scripture zechariah is going to have
[1:42:11] many
[1:42:12] prophecies that are that are post or you
[1:42:14] could say post uh tribulation
[1:42:17] that you can read about you can read
[1:42:18] them you can read a lot about it in
[1:42:20] zechariah jeremiah isaiah but i want you
[1:42:23] to notice this here in in isaiah chapter
[1:42:25] 21 verse three
[1:42:27] and isaiah begins to say this he says
[1:42:29] for this reason he begins to see
[1:42:31] something here
[1:42:33] vision falls upon him he's not seeing
[1:42:35] the messiah anymore now he sees way off
[1:42:38] into the future
[1:42:40] and jeremiah says
[1:42:42] my loins if you could put that up
[1:42:44] brother jeremy that was the right one
[1:42:47] verse 3.
[1:42:49] he says therefore are my loins filled
[1:42:51] with pain
[1:42:52] pains have taken a hold upon me as the
[1:42:55] pangs of a woman that traveleth i was
[1:42:56] bowed down at the hearing of it i was
[1:42:58] dismayed
[1:43:00] at the scene of it verse four
[1:43:03] this is a vision he begins to describe
[1:43:05] my heart panted
[1:43:07] fearfulness of frightened me the night
[1:43:09] of my pleasure hath he turned
[1:43:11] into fear
[1:43:13] unto me
[1:43:15] so something strikes the heart of this
[1:43:17] prophet
[1:43:18] and and isaiah begins to list this and
[1:43:21] say i was i just i became in pain
[1:43:24] even physical pain
[1:43:26] at what isaiah was seeing here this
[1:43:30] great what what isaiah sees
[1:43:32] is this falling down of the babylonian
[1:43:36] system in verse 9 of chapter 21 if you
[1:43:39] want to read that
[1:43:40] but isaiah begins to say here in verse 9
[1:43:43] of chapter 21 there he says behold here
[1:43:45] cometh the chariot of men with a couple
[1:43:48] of horsemen and he answered and said
[1:43:49] babylon has fallen has fallen in all the
[1:43:51] graven images of her gods he hath broken
[1:43:55] to
[1:43:56] the ground so what did what what did
[1:43:58] isaiah begin to see here as he sees this
[1:44:01] great army this great chariot army of
[1:44:04] horsemen this great enemy riders and
[1:44:07] horsemen and
[1:44:08] and and and and chariots
[1:44:11] and he says he says here he says he's
[1:44:14] seen the downfall notice what he was
[1:44:16] seeing all of the judgment and all of
[1:44:18] the destruction that was going to come
[1:44:20] upon the earth
[1:44:22] back up to verse 7 here and he begins to
[1:44:25] cry out and he saw a chariot with a
[1:44:28] couple of horsemen a chariot of asses a
[1:44:30] chair of camels and he hearkened
[1:44:31] diligently
[1:44:33] with much heed
[1:44:37] and and i want you just to catch the
[1:44:39] words here
[1:44:40] i we skipped ahead but i'm going
[1:44:42] backwards i know verse five brother
[1:44:44] jeremy catch just some of the words
[1:44:46] isaiah begins to use here he says
[1:44:48] prepare the table
[1:44:51] prepare the table
[1:44:52] why because of what i've seen
[1:44:55] the judgment that's come in the
[1:44:57] destruction that's coming
[1:44:58] prepare the table
[1:45:00] watch
[1:45:01] in the watchtower
[1:45:04] eat
[1:45:05] drink arise you princes
[1:45:09] and he says
[1:45:10] and anoint the shield
[1:45:13] prepare the table
[1:45:15] watching the watchtowers there's
[1:45:17] judgment coming armies coming
[1:45:20] marching outside
[1:45:21] oh he says what is what is this what is
[1:45:24] isaiah saying watchmen you better you
[1:45:26] better cry out you better pay attention
[1:45:28] as we preach to you you better be sober
[1:45:30] you better be diligent you better be
[1:45:32] vigilant
[1:45:34] you better be on your guard
[1:45:37] he says in verse 6 just keep going there
[1:45:40] brother jeremy
[1:45:41] for thus hath the lord said unto me go
[1:45:44] said a watchman let him declare
[1:45:47] what
[1:45:48] he seeth what a vision
[1:45:51] isaiah begins to have here he says in
[1:45:53] isaiah chapter 30
[1:45:55] if you have that verse 9 and verse 10
[1:45:58] isaiah 30
[1:46:00] verse 9 and verse 10
[1:46:03] and he's going to begin to speak of
[1:46:04] these watchmen that he cries out to and
[1:46:06] he says that this is a rebellious people
[1:46:09] lying children children that will not
[1:46:11] hear the law
[1:46:13] of the lord which say to the seers
[1:46:16] see not
[1:46:18] imagine
[1:46:19] this was a prophecy
[1:46:21] of 2020.
[1:46:25] scripture has compound meaning you ever
[1:46:27] you want to talk about a of a better
[1:46:29] fulfillment today
[1:46:30] just look around
[1:46:32] say unto them
[1:46:34] say unto the seer see not to the
[1:46:35] prophets prophesy not unto us write
[1:46:38] things speaking to us
[1:46:41] smooth things
[1:46:45] prophesy
[1:46:47] deceits
[1:46:52] prophesy deceits is that what the new
[1:46:54] testament says they'll heap unto
[1:46:55] themselves teachers
[1:46:59] having itching
[1:47:01] ears
[1:47:08] and you know what people don't like
[1:47:10] prophets like this
[1:47:13] prophesied to us happy things
[1:47:16] oh yo doom and gloom brother brandon
[1:47:17] picks it up and in the sudden secret
[1:47:19] catching away of the church you'll
[1:47:21] listen to that message
[1:47:23] brother branham preaches gives a story
[1:47:25] about pearl harbor
[1:47:27] and he says could you imagine there as
[1:47:29] they were drinking that night before he
[1:47:30] said just all in a stupor
[1:47:32] and he says they're at the bar and he
[1:47:34] says that man came in ringing the bell
[1:47:35] they're coming there they're coming you
[1:47:37] got to get out of here get to your
[1:47:39] senses get to your post oh
[1:47:41] brother adam says that spirit on those
[1:47:42] people they were so intoxicated
[1:47:45] he said oh you worry wart oh you you
[1:47:48] doomsday
[1:47:51] oh you you you why don't you why don't
[1:47:53] you be quiet why don't you just why
[1:47:55] don't you just why don't you just shut
[1:47:57] up
[1:47:58] enough for your gloom
[1:47:59] enough of what you're saying but but but
[1:48:01] he's a watchman
[1:48:03] he's on the tower
[1:48:05] he's anointed to speak what he sees
[1:48:09] do you realize how maniacal it would be
[1:48:11] for him to to to not cry out when the
[1:48:14] enemy he sees coming to destroy
[1:48:20] notice what he says in isaiah 21 verse 6
[1:48:23] for thus hath the lord said go set a
[1:48:25] watchman let him declare what he
[1:48:29] seeth let me tell you something my
[1:48:31] brother my sister we had a faithful
[1:48:32] watchman
[1:48:35] that came in our generation
[1:48:38] what a faithful watchman who declared
[1:48:41] what he's seen
[1:48:43] and i'm glad god gave us a watchman
[1:48:46] i'm glad god gave us a word that has
[1:48:48] vision
[1:48:49] and it's not blurry
[1:48:52] it's not blurry
[1:48:54] we'd have a word of these preachers
[1:48:56] these prophets so-called prophets on
[1:48:57] television you know someone out there
[1:49:00] has back trouble
[1:49:02] has back pain
[1:49:04] of course thousands of people watching
[1:49:06] somebody has back pain
[1:49:09] oh i can just see it of course they see
[1:49:11] it of course you have all the modern day
[1:49:12] people of course people see judgment
[1:49:15] but let me tell you something we didn't
[1:49:16] receive a generic blurry
[1:49:19] prophecy
[1:49:22] we have a clear word of prophecy
[1:49:25] paul's word we have a sure word of
[1:49:26] prophecy we have something we can hold
[1:49:29] on to
[1:49:30] we have something that can establish the
[1:49:33] church
[1:49:35] watchmen a watchman could say in ezekiel
[1:49:37] 3 7 son of man i have made thee a
[1:49:40] watchman unto the house of israel
[1:49:41] therefore hear the word of my mouth and
[1:49:44] give them warning from me isaiah 62 6 i
[1:49:49] have set watchmen upon thy walls o
[1:49:51] jerusalem which shall never hold their
[1:49:53] peace day or night
[1:49:55] ye that make mention of the lord keep
[1:49:57] not silence
[1:49:59] and give him no rest till he establish
[1:50:01] and make jerusalem a praise
[1:50:05] in the earth
[1:50:07] what was he saying there's going to be a
[1:50:09] watchman on the wall
[1:50:11] there's going to be a word that sounds
[1:50:13] out and declares
[1:50:16] and a watchman you know what a watchman
[1:50:17] doesn't do a watchman doesn't it doesn't
[1:50:19] just sit over the you know the tower
[1:50:21] wall
[1:50:22] and they you know they they sort of look
[1:50:24] over and say oh hey
[1:50:26] hey we've got an enemy
[1:50:29] hey guys
[1:50:31] hey there's trouble down here they're
[1:50:33] they're putting ladders
[1:50:36] oh there's a ladder there hey they got a
[1:50:38] ladder that's not what a watchman does
[1:50:40] what a waste anybody can do that
[1:50:43] anybody can get up on the wall and tell
[1:50:44] you when there's trouble
[1:50:46] but the the gift of a watchman is that
[1:50:49] the watchman could look and see miles
[1:50:51] and miles and miles and miles
[1:50:55] and he could identify
[1:50:57] what you would look at and see just as a
[1:50:59] little speck
[1:51:02] that watchman could say oh that's not a
[1:51:04] harmless speck
[1:51:06] that's an army
[1:51:09] that's an invader
[1:51:11] you know what the watchman is sent to do
[1:51:13] he's sent to identify seed
[1:51:18] there's a gift in a prophet
[1:51:20] that we don't have
[1:51:22] and that's to identify
[1:51:24] seeds
[1:51:26] brother brandon would preach a message
[1:51:28] the seed of discrepancy
[1:51:31] are you
[1:51:32] here what was he doing he was a watchman
[1:51:35] identifying seeds he wasn't going to
[1:51:37] identify the fruit
[1:51:40] anybody could identify the fruit
[1:51:42] if i give you an apple and i give you a
[1:51:43] tomato and i give you an orange and i
[1:51:45] say now brother if you've really got a
[1:51:47] gift you'll tell me is this an apple or
[1:51:49] an orange
[1:51:51] you say ah
[1:51:53] that's an orange
[1:51:55] how can you tell well it's orange
[1:52:00] but you take those seeds give me give me
[1:52:02] give me the seeds of that fruit put it
[1:52:04] out before you say
[1:52:06] now tell me
[1:52:08] well
[1:52:10] i think that's uh
[1:52:12] appleseed
[1:52:13] no
[1:52:14] wrong answer
[1:52:16] you see what the importance of that is
[1:52:18] is that there are seeds of god
[1:52:20] and they're seeds of discrepancy
[1:52:24] and god sent a messenger who was a
[1:52:26] watchman on the wall who wasn't going to
[1:52:28] just come and say here's the fruits
[1:52:30] here's what it's going to look like no
[1:52:31] but he was going to identify seeds
[1:52:34] that's why he'd crowd against the
[1:52:35] television show called i love lucy
[1:52:38] and everyone would say
[1:52:41] seems so harmless
[1:52:44] but let me let that's the seed let me
[1:52:46] show you the fruit modern day television
[1:52:48] is the fruit
[1:52:50] is the manifestation of the seeds
[1:52:54] he's gonna he's gonna prophesy and he's
[1:52:56] gonna speak about the seed of
[1:52:58] christian songs saying to the time of
[1:53:00] rock and roll music
[1:53:02] brother adam says they called me in the
[1:53:03] room here in my apartment he says and
[1:53:05] i've seen those boogie woogie says
[1:53:07] ricky's he says singing that singing
[1:53:09] gospel hymns through the time of rock
[1:53:11] and roll now what you would what you
[1:53:13] would hear if you heard that i'm sure
[1:53:15] today we'd go oh wow
[1:53:17] you know that's what brother branham
[1:53:18] called boogie woogie rock and roll well
[1:53:20] let me tell you something he was a
[1:53:21] watchman identifying
[1:53:24] seeds and then you see what's produced
[1:53:27] today in modern
[1:53:28] mega churches today
[1:53:31] it's the fruit
[1:53:32] of the seed
[1:53:36] but he was a watchman
[1:53:38] and he was coming to identify
[1:53:41] seeds
[1:53:43] isaiah says
[1:53:44] he says
[1:53:46] declare now this is this is this is from
[1:53:48] ezekiel 3 17 the one that we just now
[1:53:50] read son of man i made thee a watchman
[1:53:52] he says in isaiah 62 verse 6 that's what
[1:53:55] it was i've set watchmen upon the walls
[1:53:57] of jerusalem which shall never hold
[1:53:59] their peace day or night
[1:54:01] so what was it going to do it was it was
[1:54:03] it was sent to give hope it was sent to
[1:54:06] give encouragement that you've not been
[1:54:08] left in the dark you've not been left to
[1:54:10] figure this out you've not been left
[1:54:12] listen to me my brother and my sister
[1:54:14] you don't have to fear with what you see
[1:54:16] in the world today because you don't
[1:54:18] have to figure it out god's not figuring
[1:54:20] it out as he goes you already had a
[1:54:22] watchman come and declare to you and to
[1:54:24] cry to you all you've got to do is
[1:54:27] believe what has already been said

[1:56:00] to pass
[1:56:01] and to stand before the son of man
[1:56:05] that book of acts church
[1:56:06] was a praying church
[1:56:09] they were christians who
[1:56:11] prayed
[1:56:13] the bible says that that church was born
[1:56:16] birthed
[1:56:17] at a prayer meeting
[1:56:21] that's how that book of acts church was
[1:56:23] started tearing
[1:56:25] praying
[1:56:26] all in one mind one accord and the
[1:56:29] the rushing mighty wind the spirit of
[1:56:30] god came in like a rush he might have
[1:56:32] went
[1:56:32] rushing mighty one what was it started
[1:56:35] from prayer
[1:56:37] the disciples the bible says continued
[1:56:39] in
[1:56:40] the apostles doctrine
[1:56:42] in teaching and
[1:56:44] in
[1:56:45] prayer
[1:56:48] what was that book of acts seed church
[1:56:52] the disciples continued to pray
[1:56:54] they were proclaiming they were
[1:56:56] preaching
[1:56:57] but they were praying all the time
[1:57:00] that those leaders the apostles of that
[1:57:02] first church had gone to jesus earlier
[1:57:05] those same men and asked him to teach
[1:57:07] them to pray and then jesus said now
[1:57:09] that i've taught you now instruct others
[1:57:12] teaching them how to pray i would that
[1:57:14] men pray always
[1:57:17] everywhere

[1:57:45] little bit if you if you're not careful
[1:57:46] with our english
[1:57:48] when you read the book of acts acts
[1:57:51] means it comes from the latin word
[1:57:54] proxies

[1:57:58] you know what praxis
[1:58:00] means it's where we get the word

[1:58:05] so what are you reading you're reading
[1:58:07] the practices of
[1:58:09] christians
[1:58:12] what does the bible say they were first
[1:58:13] called
[1:58:14] christians
[1:58:16] at antioch that means they didn't label
[1:58:18] themselves hey guys let's come up with a
[1:58:19] good name what should we name ourselves
[1:58:21] no
[1:58:22] their lives were so manifested that they
[1:58:25] were like jesus that the bible says they
[1:58:27] were called christians
[1:58:30] because they're like
[1:58:32] christ
[1:58:34] and these were their
[1:58:37] practices this is the way that they
[1:58:40] lived
[1:58:42] this is the way we're going to get into
[1:58:43] this more lord willing next wednesday
[1:58:45] this is the way that they lived they
[1:58:48] devoted themselves acts 2 42.
[1:58:52] the bible says that they devoted
[1:58:54] themselves to the apostles doctrine and
[1:58:56] to
[1:58:57] they continued steadfastly
[1:59:00] in the apostles doctrine and
[1:59:02] fellowship
[1:59:05] and
[1:59:06] fellowship
[1:59:08] amen
[1:59:09] two fellows in a ship
[1:59:12] fellowship communal was all about
[1:59:14] community i know we want to get rid of
[1:59:17] that but it's in the bible
[1:59:19] and in the breaking of bread and
[1:59:21] in
[1:59:23] prayers
[1:59:26] prayers
[1:59:28] you read acts 4
[1:59:31] and go read about what led up if you go
[1:59:33] read about just in acts 4 in your own
[1:59:35] time
[1:59:36] it gives you
[1:59:38] all of the events that lead up
[1:59:40] to such a mighty prayer meeting peter
[1:59:44] and john
[1:59:45] the bible says we're arrested for what
[1:59:47] preaching
[1:59:48] you know sometimes bad things can happen
[1:59:50] to you and you didn't do anything to
[1:59:51] deserve it
[1:59:53] they didn't do anything to deserve to
[1:59:54] get arrested but they were just
[1:59:55] preaching put in jail the bible says
[1:59:58] held in jail then the sanhedrin
[2:00:01] gives an order that they're never to
[2:00:04] speak again in the name of jesus or
[2:00:06] teach in the name of jesus the bible
[2:00:08] says that they get released out of
[2:00:10] prison they come back to the believers
[2:00:13] and they tell them everything that the
[2:00:15] sanhedrin
[2:00:16] said don't ever preach don't ever teach
[2:00:19] jesus again you know what the bible says
[2:00:21] that the those believers those early
[2:00:23] believers did
[2:00:27] says that they all got out their signs
[2:00:28] and their markers they started writing
[2:00:31] all the things they're going to protest
[2:00:32] and they started marching in front of
[2:00:33] the sanhedrin
[2:00:37] is that what you read
[2:00:39] no
[2:00:40] the bible says they assembled themselves
[2:00:44] in prayer
[2:00:46] they took the matter
[2:00:48] to the lord
[2:00:51] they took the matter to
[2:00:54] the lord said brother matt why are you
[2:00:56] preaching on that because i'm preaching
[2:00:57] on the acts experience
[2:01:00] this is what it meant to practice
[2:01:03] this is what it meant to live
[2:01:05] as a christian they took the matter to
[2:01:09] the lord
[2:01:10] in prayer
[2:01:12] in prayer
[2:01:13] david says in psalms 138 verse 3 he says
[2:01:17] in the day when i cried thou answered us
[2:01:20] me and strengthened me
[2:01:23] with strength in
[2:01:25] my
[2:01:27] soul
[2:01:29] and the day i cried david knew what it
[2:01:31] meant to pray
[2:01:33] david knew what it meant to commune with
[2:01:35] the lord david says i've proven
[2:01:37] you god i've proven you in all of my
[2:01:41] trials and all of my dark times and all
[2:01:44] of my darkest mysterious hours
[2:01:47] when i didn't have no one else to turn
[2:01:49] to i turn to the lord
[2:01:52] i sought only you and you here's what
[2:01:54] david says here's my testimony you heard
[2:01:56] me
[2:01:57] and you gave me strength for the battle
[2:01:59] that i was facing you caught in trouble
[2:02:02] and then david says they caught in
[2:02:04] trouble against me and you delivered me
[2:02:07] and answered
[2:02:09] me
[2:02:10] through what
[2:02:11] through prayer
[2:02:13] through what god gave him the power
[2:02:16] of prayer
