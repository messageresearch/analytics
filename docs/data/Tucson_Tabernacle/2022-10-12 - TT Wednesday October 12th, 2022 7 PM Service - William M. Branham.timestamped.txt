[9:14] I will praise
[9:21] I will praise the Lord
[9:27] no matter what tomorrow
[9:41] amen
[9:44] I will praise him no matter
[9:47] what the situation
[9:49] sometimes we might say Lord why am I in
[9:51] this but I'm going to give you praise
[9:53] anyway so
[9:56] so let's let's open with a praise
[10:00] and a prayer request
[10:03] and give him praise because he's in
[10:06] control of everything
[10:08] if you
[10:10] have the WhatsApp we put in a request
[10:15] for sister Elizabeth Murray
[10:19] brother Robert Figueroa had
[10:21] had text me yesterday afternoon
[10:24] saying sister Elizabeth had gone into
[10:27] early labor
[10:28] her water bag had broke and she was
[10:30] having contractions
[10:32] and they took her to the hospital
[10:34] and it didn't look good so
[10:38] we asked the church to pray and he asked
[10:40] if we would pass it out we did
[10:43] and then yesterday that was uh
[10:46] yeah the day before yesterday and
[10:48] yesterday
[10:49] I didn't get any answers from him so I
[10:51] called brother Jude directly
[10:53] and he said all is well
[10:57] so brother Robert then sent me this text
[10:59] and I'm going to read this to you
[11:02] it's a Tuesday night update on Elizabeth
[11:05] she's doing great
[11:07] we had a complete turnaround late this
[11:10] morning praise God
[11:12] the contraction stopped this afternoon
[11:14] she was tested again this morning for
[11:17] amniotic fluid leaks and three tests
[11:20] came back negative even though the tests
[11:22] of previous days both confirmed that it
[11:25] was leaking
[11:26] miraculously the cervix isn't dilated
[11:29] even though she had contractions for
[11:31] nearly 24 hours every three to eight
[11:34] minutes
[11:35] the ultrasound today showed the baby as
[11:37] well the fluid is full as it should be
[11:41] concerning how wet she was yesterday and
[11:43] tested positive for break that's great
[11:45] news
[11:46] so this morning we were told she would
[11:48] stay four weeks minimum in the hospital
[11:50] if they could continue to hold the baby
[11:52] off
[11:53] this afternoon it changed to you can
[11:55] probably go home tomorrow
[11:57] nurses were doing the transfer of care
[11:59] and one nurse said to the other nurse we
[12:01] just don't understand it it's like a
[12:03] miracle
[12:04] so we're very so we're very happy baby
[12:06] gets to stay in the womb a little longer
[12:08] staying in the hospital tonight just for
[12:10] observation and we'll be heading home
[12:12] tomorrow morning
[12:13] thank you for praying for us we feel so
[12:15] blessed and thankful that our situation
[12:17] turned around so quickly and really
[12:19] believe that everyone's prayers helped
[12:22] change things no matter what the
[12:24] situation
[12:26] [Applause]
[12:28] sometimes sometimes it looks dark
[12:31] and then brother
[12:33] Lyle gave me this prayer request just as
[12:36] he came in
[12:37] Sister Barbara Yarborough request prayer
[12:40] for her granddaughter Megan and her
[12:41] husband Ben
[12:43] Gan delivered their baby this morning by
[12:45] cesarea's section the infant has serious
[12:48] birth defects and was taken by air
[12:50] ambulance to Phoenix Children Hospital
[12:53] the baby has problems breathing as and
[12:55] is on a ventilator in serious condition
[12:58] Ben and Megan are both trusting the Lord
[13:00] for their child in its healing and also
[13:03] to remember her grandson Hudson
[13:05] so I just read what God has done already
[13:09] and he's the same yesterday today and
[13:11] forever I wrote down Hebrews 13 8 Jesus
[13:14] Christ the same yesterday today and
[13:16] forever
[13:18] before I knew that we were going to get
[13:20] this
[13:21] request
[13:22] and I told sister Lily we're going to
[13:24] sing what a mighty God we serve
[13:27] with his testimony
[13:29] but we're still going to sing that same
[13:31] testimony
[13:32] for this baby here and how many can
[13:34] believe that say Lord I believe and
[13:37] sometimes we even have to say help thou
[13:39] Lord my unbelief so let's stand
[13:43] what a mighty God we serve
[13:46] [Music]
[13:58] Angels bow before him a heaven and Earth
[14:03] but a door
[14:04] what a mighty God we serve
[14:11] Jesus is a God we serve
[14:17] Jesus is the God we serve
[14:22] Angels found before and the Heaven and
[14:26] Earth adore him Jesus is a Godly son
[14:34] What a Mighty God brother Jordan
[14:40] What a Mighty on foreign
[14:45] [Music]
[14:54] [Music]
[15:04] [Music]
[15:08] [Applause]
[15:08] [Music]
[15:18] [Music]
[15:24] let's pray Heavenly Father our gracious
[15:27] Lord
[15:28] our healer or deliver our savior Lord we
[15:33] hear the praise there from Sister
[15:35] Elizabeth Lord and the baby in the
[15:37] situation and we just glorify Your Name
[15:39] Lord and then we think of Ben and Megan
[15:42] in their great need at this time lord
[15:44] and would you just go on the scene
[15:48] Lord for their little one
[15:50] Lord and would you just do that miracle
[15:52] that you did for
[15:54] Elizabeth Lord and their baby Lord Judah
[15:57] Elizabeth's baby Lord
[16:00] Lord is
[16:02] we each have needs Lord in each
[16:05] situation Lord
[16:06] Lord I was
[16:08] coming to church tonight and I was
[16:10] thinking Lord
[16:12] how the
[16:14] thing that probably touches my heart the
[16:16] most is a little one that's hurting or
[16:18] that's sick or a need Lord and
[16:21] Lord
[16:23] You Can Be Touched with the feeling of
[16:25] our infirmities Lord and
[16:27] so we just as a congregation lift up our
[16:31] voices our faith Lord in our hands Lord
[16:35] request that you would move on the
[16:36] mighty scene Lord
[16:38] [Music]
[16:40] Lord it would be just simple for you to
[16:43] do and we know you've already done it
[16:45] Lord and we're just asking for the
[16:47] manifestation of the work Lord
[16:49] be with the remainder of this service
[16:52] may we just hear what you want us to
[16:55] hear Lord as we
[16:56] receive the word Lord that comes forth
[16:59] tonight Lord
[17:00] may we draw closer to you Lord
[17:03] in every way in our life Lord and may we
[17:06] just
[17:08] accept what you have for us Lord and not
[17:11] be stubborn or hard-headed or
[17:15] have amnesia or anything that would
[17:17] hinder us Lord from hearing from you
[17:19] Lord
[17:20] be with us as a congregation and help us
[17:23] Lord forgive us of our sins and
[17:25] iniquities we ask all these things in

[33:54] he knows he is

[34:09] enough
[34:11] [Music]
[34:18] for me

[34:26] he says dig
[34:28] some more or fill the valley full of
[34:30] ditches and prepare for my blessing
[34:33] that's he's a mighty God
[34:35] he's worth I mean to to him you're worth
[34:39] everything that he's done
[34:41] I was thinking about that
[34:44] thief on the cross the other day just
[34:47] God's mercy
[34:49] the timing's so perfect
[34:52] for God to hang on the cross
[34:54] he couldn't do it the day before or day
[34:56] day after because that Thief was going
[34:58] to be on the cross at that time
[35:00] so it was all perfectly laid out in the
[35:02] mind because there was going to be one
[35:03] who at the last moment was going to say
[35:05] remember me when you come into your
[35:07] kingdom and he turns and say this day
[35:10] you'll be with me in Paradise everything
[35:13] is on perfect time with God I just
[35:15] appreciate that sometimes I look at it I
[35:18] say oh what's going on in wine how's
[35:20] this going to get resolved and God just
[35:23] says it's in my hands it's in my care so
[35:26] tonight we're going to listen to the
[35:28] message in his presence
[35:31] there's two sides to that being in his
[35:33] presence that
[35:35] he bids us come
[35:37] enter into his presence
[35:40] but he knows we can't come on our own
[35:43] so he made a way for us to enter into
[35:46] his presence as the congregation of
[35:49] Israel would stand on the outside
[35:50] looking towards the temple there
[35:53] and a high priest would go in and they
[35:55] would look for that smoke to know that
[35:57] the sacrifice had been accepted
[36:00] and their sins would be rolled over
[36:03] for another year they could live at
[36:05] peace again
[36:07] but he said for once and for all the
[36:10] veil was rent to and therefore we can
[36:12] come in but we must approach him in the
[36:14] right manner
[36:15] when you get in his presence you realize
[36:17] how little you are
[36:20] and that's perfectly fine
[36:22] because that's how one you want to come
[36:24] to him say Lord I just surrender all
[36:26] and let him fail so if he'll stand with
[36:29] me
[36:31] in his presence and brother Matt made
[36:35] quite a few references to
[36:38] uh
[36:39] the countdown and that was the message
[36:41] he had preached that morning
[36:43] and then he preached in his presence
[36:45] that evening
[36:47] but we can come into His presence
[36:50] in fact it behooves you to get into its
[36:52] presence and then not I'd rather come
[36:55] like I am and get into his presence and
[36:57] let him change me
[36:59] then saying I'm not good enough to get
[37:01] in there and nothing can happen so come
[37:04] on in and just and and receive of him
[37:07] let him correct you let him clean you
[37:09] let him change you and then the joy of
[37:12] the Lord is your strength amen
[37:14] amen that song that
[37:17] that please the angel of the Lord
[37:21] only believe only believe all things are
[37:23] possible
[37:25] [Music]
[37:38] things are possible
[37:46] [Music]
[38:00] all things are possible
[38:07] only now our confession is Lord I
[38:10] believe
[38:10] [Music]
[38:12] oh Lord I believe
[38:16] [Music]
[38:19] Lord I believe
[38:23] all things are possible
[38:29] Lord I believe
[38:35] Lord I believe
[38:38] [Music]
[38:41] Lord I believe
[38:45] all things are possible
[38:51] Lord I believe
[38:55] Reach Out And Touch the Hem of His
[38:57] Garment for whatever you have need as he
[38:59] ministers to you today God bless you may
[39:02] be seated
[39:16] and now tonight God willing we're
[39:18] speaking on the subject of any in his
[39:21] presence
[39:22] oh how we thank God for the privilege
[39:25] that we can come into His presence but
[39:28] first I wish you all to turn in your
[39:30] Bibles with me to the prophet Isaiah the
[39:34] sixth chapter of the prophet Isaiah we
[39:39] all know that Isaiah was a major prophet
[39:42] and one of the great prophets of his day
[39:45] he ended his life for being solid
[39:48] asunder with Sauls
[39:50] for our testimony as a martyr to the
[39:53] power of almighty God
[39:55] in the book of Isaiah the sixth chapter
[39:58] I begin at the fifth verse 3.
[40:04] then said ah
[40:06] woe is me
[40:08] or maybe I start with the first verse
[40:11] let's pardon me a moment let's start at
[40:13] the first verse and read down until
[40:15] about the eighth verse in the year the
[40:19] king azekiah died I saw also the Lord
[40:23] setting upon a throne
[40:25] high and lifted up
[40:28] in his train filled the temple
[40:31] above it stood the serpents
[40:34] each one having six wings
[40:38] between he covered his face
[40:41] and between he covered his feet and
[40:44] between he did fly
[40:47] and one Cried unto another and said holy
[40:52] holy holy is the Lord God of hosts and
[40:57] the whole earth is full of his glory
[41:02] I am the host of the door moved at the
[41:06] voice of him that cried and the house
[41:09] was filled with smoke
[41:11] then said on woe is me for I am undone
[41:17] because I am a man of unclean lives and
[41:21] I dwell in the midst of people of
[41:24] unclean lit
[41:25] for in our eyes have seen the king the
[41:28] Lord of hosts
[41:30] then flew one of this therapists unto me
[41:34] having a live coal in his hand
[41:37] which he had taken with the thongs from
[41:40] off the altar
[41:42] and he laid it up on my mouth and said
[41:45] Lord this has touched thy lips
[41:49] and then iniquity
[41:51] is taken away and now sin is purged
[41:56] also I heard the voice of the Lord
[41:58] saying who shall I send and who will go
[42:02] for us then said I here I am
[42:07] send me
[42:10] may the Lord bless his word
[42:13] I think that's the most striking
[42:17] a scripture
[42:20] we find
[42:22] that in the presence of God
[42:26] man recognized themselves to be sinners
[42:31] we may feel pretty good
[42:34] when we're out in different places and
[42:36] feel like that we're pretty good people
[42:38] but when we ever come into the presence
[42:41] of God then we see how little we are
[42:47] standing up long ago with a A friend of
[42:50] mine
[42:51] and I had the privilege of leading to
[42:53] Christ
[42:54] Bert call
[42:56] up in New Hampshire a hunting partner we
[42:59] are standing by Colebrook Falls up in
[43:02] the Adirondack
[43:03] and it was such a mammoth big Falls I've
[43:06] taken my family last year up there to
[43:08] look at it way back off the road you
[43:10] have to hike back to get to it
[43:13] and when we seen that blue green water
[43:16] pouring with such a mighty power out of
[43:19] the mountains and gushing down over the
[43:21] Rocks Burton stood down to me and he
[43:23] said Gee Billy it makes a man feel just
[43:27] so little he measured about a quarter of
[43:29] an inch on his fingers
[43:31] I said that's right Bert now that was
[43:34] all he knowed of getting into the
[43:35] presence of God to see his creation
[43:39] a one of the man who wrote How Great
[43:42] Thou Art if he didn't look up one night
[43:44] look at the stars how far they are away
[43:48] a few months ago brother Fred
[43:51] brother woods and I was standing with
[43:53] brother mcinally out in the Arizona
[43:55] desert we was measuring giant one star
[43:59] how close it was to the other
[44:01] and with the millions and billions of
[44:05] miles away they didn't look over a
[44:07] quarter of an inch from each other then
[44:10] we begin to think according to
[44:12] scientific proof of that those stars are
[44:15] probably farther away from each other
[44:17] than we are from now
[44:19] see how it is then we realize how little
[44:22] we are when we realize how great he is
[44:26] and how close we come in coming to his
[44:30] presence
[44:32] somehow another is always stroke a great
[44:35] effect upon people they're coming to the
[44:38] presence of God
[44:40] I've seen the time in my Ministry when
[44:45] you see the presence of God coming into
[44:47] such a place that it would bring a
[44:50] person up and just reveal the life to
[44:54] them and call out their sins of all
[44:58] kinds of immoral acts and it brings such
[45:01] a holy hush amongst the people until
[45:04] they drop out of the prayer line before
[45:06] they ever come up to be prayed for and
[45:09] run to the altar get right with God
[45:11] before they come up into his presence
[45:14] there's something about coming into the
[45:17] presence of God
[45:19] it causes things to happen
[45:22] I've seen people laying eggs cops and
[45:25] stretchers that night down there at
[45:28] Mexico we're not a little dead baby
[45:30] laying under a blanket that's a little
[45:33] Spanish mother brought up her little
[45:35] Mexican mother rather brought up
[45:38] when they sing
[45:40] several thousands of those people saw
[45:44] maybe 50 or 75
[45:46] 000 at one Gathering saw that little
[45:50] dead baby come to life women faded
[45:54] people threw up their hands and screamed
[45:57] why they realized that a human being
[46:00] could not do that
[46:02] they were in the presence of almighty
[46:05] God and it caused something to happen
[46:09] I've been privileged to hear a godly man
[46:12] speak
[46:13] it was said one time of Charles spinning
[46:16] little bitty fella never weighed over
[46:19] about 110 pounds but he had such a
[46:22] forceful way of speaking until he was
[46:25] trying the Acoustics one day in a
[46:26] building they didn't have PA systems
[46:29] then and there was the man repairing up
[46:33] in the balcony or up in the roof of the
[46:35] place and he heard the man come in so he
[46:38] didn't know who they were he just kept
[46:40] quiet Mr Feeney was going to try the
[46:44] Acoustics after spending much time in
[46:46] prayer for that Revival that he's going
[46:49] to hold he tried his voice to see how it
[46:52] would carry he slipped up quickly to the
[46:54] pulpit and said repent or perish and he
[46:58] said it was such fourth Force after
[47:00] being or that only God told a man
[47:02] dropped out of the top of the balcony
[47:04] down onto the floor out of the top of
[47:06] the building onto the floor
[47:08] he preached the gospel in such way till
[47:10] he stood in Boston Massachusetts and a
[47:13] little bay window because his no church
[47:16] could hold his cloud and he stood there
[47:18] with such Mighty force and preached held
[47:22] such a place onto a working man with
[47:25] their baskets under their arms fell into
[47:27] the street and screamed for mercy
[47:29] the presence of God
[47:31] [Applause]
[47:32] great preachers who's been able by the
[47:35] word of God to bring the presence of God
[47:37] to an audience
[47:39] all this that man would ever be so
[47:42] seared in their hearts so they could
[47:43] never recognize the presence of God
[47:48] when the first man as soon as he had
[47:51] sinned and done something wrong and when
[47:54] God came into his presence or he came
[47:57] into the presence of God Adam he could
[48:00] not stand in the presence of God
[48:03] he run and hid himself in the bush and
[48:06] tried to cover himself with a figly
[48:08] because he knowed he was standing In The
[48:10] Presence of Jehovah the Creator
[48:13] that was the reaction of the first man
[48:16] actually he had sinned and tried to come
[48:19] into the presence of God with sent upon
[48:21] his soul he could not hide because he
[48:24] was tender yet sin and I took a hole
[48:28] like it has rooted into people's hearts
[48:30] today but he was very conscious that he
[48:33] was standing before his creator
[48:36] now he hid himself in the bushes and
[48:39] would not come out and could not come
[48:42] out until God had made a preparation for
[48:45] him
[48:46] we could go back and take in Genesis the
[48:49] 17th chapter and the third verse when
[48:53] the Great patriarch Abraham
[48:55] when he came into the presence of God
[48:57] and God spoke to him in the 17th chapter
[49:00] in the name of almighty God Abraham fell
[49:04] on his face
[49:06] the great patriarch servant of God could
[49:11] not stand in the presence of God though
[49:13] I had served him for 25 years Faithfully
[49:17] but when God moved into his presence the
[49:19] patriarch fell on his face because he
[49:21] couldn't stand in the presence of God
[49:24] in Exodus 3 we find that Moses the great
[49:29] servant and prophet of God
[49:31] when he was back on the back side of the
[49:34] desert that man was a holy man he had
[49:37] been born for the purpose he was born
[49:40] from his mother's wombs to be a prophet
[49:42] he had tried to get his education and do
[49:46] everything he could to deliver his
[49:47] people because he understood that he was
[49:50] to deliver his people but when he
[49:53] understood it by a theological
[49:55] standpoint he was trained he was well
[49:58] scholared he could teach the Egyptians
[50:01] wisdom which was the most smartest
[50:03] people in the world he known all the ins
[50:06] and outs he knows the scripture from A
[50:08] to Z he known the promises that God had
[50:11] made him he noted from an intellectual
[50:13] standpoint and he was a a great military
[50:16] man but one day on the back side of the
[50:19] desert when he'd come into the presence
[50:21] of God he jerked off his shoes and fell
[50:23] into his feet no leave it he was on Holy
[50:25] Ground
[50:26] amen he could not stand upon his feet
[50:29] when he come in the presence of God he
[50:32] fell to his face like Abraham did
[50:35] he could not stand in the presence of
[50:37] God in Exodus 19 19 when the chosen
[50:41] people of God sent the way back in the
[50:45] days of Abraham from Abraham come Isaac
[50:48] Isaac come Jacob God Jacob come the
[50:50] Patriarchs and years after years it
[50:53] developed holy man great man a chosen
[50:57] people a chosen race a Sanctified holy
[51:00] people and served God their life and one
[51:04] day God said Gather Israel out here I'm
[51:07] going to speak to them but when God came
[51:11] down on top of Mount Sinai amen
[51:15] and the whole Mountain caught a fire and
[51:18] the smoke was dying from the lack of
[51:20] furnace and the voice of God rore out
[51:23] Israel fell on their faces said let
[51:25] Moses speak and not God lest we die
[51:30] man
[51:31] you're the presence of God realizes he's
[51:34] a sinner yet they were everyone
[51:36] circumcised according to the law they
[51:39] had carried the Commandments and
[51:40] everything but when God spoke and they
[51:43] moved up into his presence they realized
[51:45] that they were out they were they were
[51:48] not right there was something that was
[51:51] likened because they were in the
[51:53] presence of God
[51:54] yes and they said let Moses speak and
[51:58] not God for God speaks will all die
[52:02] let Moses speak to us it was in Luke 5 8
[52:07] that when Peter
[52:09] oh when he is a great stubborn man and a
[52:15] man of great influence great power that
[52:18] we understand he was like a bullying
[52:22] adulted fisherman but when he saw the
[52:26] miracle of God performed by an ordinary
[52:28] Man look like
[52:29] which he recognized at that time that
[52:32] that taken more than a man to throw all
[52:34] that fish in a net where he was all of
[52:36] his education his knowledge efficient
[52:39] had fished all night not even taken a
[52:41] thing but he heard someone say cast your
[52:45] net in and when he began to fall he had
[52:48] a great multitude of fishes
[52:51] and he realized that he was a sinful man
[52:54] and he said depart from the O Lord for I
[52:57] am a sinful man
[52:59] who said that Saint Peter
[53:03] and the presence of God ask for God to
[53:06] depart out of his presence because he
[53:09] recognized himself a sinner
[53:12] Abraham recognized himself wrong
[53:15] Adam recognized himself wrong which was
[53:18] the son of God recognize himself wrong
[53:21] Moses recognized himself from Israel as
[53:25] a church and Nation recognize themselves
[53:27] wrong
[53:28] depart from me for I am a sinful man he
[53:33] didn't try to say now I'm holy and
[53:35] worthy to receive this he said I am a
[53:37] sinful man
[53:39] one kind of self-style religionist with
[53:43] all the theology they can learn under a
[53:45] great teacher called romelia his name is
[53:47] Saul of Tarsus which we know as Paul
[53:50] religious to the dog
[53:52] you know all the ins and out of their
[53:54] religion he was a Pharisee of the
[53:56] Pharisee in a Hebrew of the Hebrews
[53:59] he was a noted man a scholar smart
[54:03] shrewd educated painted old God from
[54:07] vadia one day on his road down to
[54:09] Damascus
[54:11] that glorifier shine over him and he
[54:14] felonies off of his feet to the ground
[54:16] in the dust and said Lord what would you
[54:19] have me to do
[54:21] all of his great training all these
[54:24] great theological training of his
[54:26] education didn't mean a thing when he
[54:28] stood in the presence of God I like to
[54:30] stop him and he didn't say that's the
[54:32] same thing you might have died PhD
[54:35] whatever you might be you might have
[54:37] went to church since she was a child you
[54:39] might have done all the religious acts
[54:41] there is but once in the presence of God
[54:43] you feel so literally no count
[54:46] boy
[54:48] oh realized that he was wrong
[54:52] and he fell to the ground
[54:55] under the influence and power when he
[54:58] looked up and seen the buried God that
[55:00] he had been preaching and against
[55:02] Authority note and seen that he was
[55:04] wrong he fell from his feet to the
[55:07] ground because he was in the presence of
[55:10] God he's seen that Pillar of Fire what
[55:13] about the great Saint John of
[55:16] Revelations 1 7.
[55:18] when he was showed the vision
[55:21] I looked I heard a voice speaking to him
[55:23] and he turned to look to see the voice
[55:26] and he saw seven golden candlesticks and
[55:29] one stood in the midst of the seven
[55:31] golden candlesticks with hair like wool
[55:34] eyes like flames of fire feet like
[55:36] pillars of rest he was girded with the
[55:39] golden girdle around the past and he was
[55:42] called the word of God and when the
[55:44] Great Saint John
[55:46] oh
[55:47] had walked with Christ
[55:51] when you've done all these things as I
[55:55] said this morning Paul's Ministry
[55:56] exceeded alien here after John had
[55:59] walked with Jesus talked with him slept
[56:02] with him eat with him but when he's seen
[56:04] him standing there that glorified State
[56:07] he said he fell like a Deadman
[56:10] [Applause]
[56:13] think of it
[56:15] we could come to church and talk and
[56:19] praise God and so forth but oh brother
[56:21] when we see him coming
[56:24] something will be different in our
[56:26] hearts
[56:27] we might think we do our religious duty
[56:30] but go to church and pay our tithing we
[56:32] might think if we keep the laws of the
[56:34] churches recite all the Creeds but once
[56:37] let us get a look at him the whole
[56:39] things changed all the way around
[56:43] yes sure this great man Saint John
[56:48] a great man like that the Bible said in
[56:51] Revelations 1 7 that he fell as if he
[56:55] was a dead man
[56:57] after three and a half years of
[57:00] fellowship with Christ
[57:02] was one of the writers of the Epistles
[57:04] rolled behind him eat with him at the
[57:07] table slept with him at the bed and
[57:10] fellowship with him for everyone but
[57:12] when he's turned to see him he had no
[57:14] more life left in him he fell like a
[57:18] dead man to the floor or to the ground
[57:21] all right we see Isaiah in Isaiah 6 and
[57:26] 5 as we've just read
[57:29] this Great Mighty prophet
[57:32] is one of the greatest prophets there is
[57:34] in the Bible
[57:35] there are 66 books of the Bible there's
[57:38] 66 chapters in Isaiah Isaiah starts off
[57:42] in Genesis the middle of Isaiah he
[57:44] brings to the New Testament at the end
[57:46] of Isaiah he brings in the millennium
[57:49] just exactly Genesis the New Testament
[57:51] and Revelations
[57:53] perfect Isaiah was one of the Major
[57:55] Prophets but one day he had been leaning
[57:59] upon the arm of Hezekiah the great king
[58:03] Hezekiah been taken from him and he was
[58:06] down he was a pretty good fellow he's a
[58:08] good righteous man if that righteous
[58:10] King a good King recognized him as a
[58:14] holy man and kept him in his Temple
[58:17] Isaiah saw Visions he was a prophet
[58:20] Isaiah preached the word he was a
[58:22] minister Isaiah was a holy man
[58:25] but one day
[58:28] he fell into a trance and he saw the
[58:32] glory of God he saw the angels with
[58:35] wings over their face Wings over their
[58:38] feet flying with wings crying holy holy
[58:42] holy is the Lord God on my head
[58:45] that Prophet realized he was nothing
[58:49] he said woe is me for I am a man of
[58:53] unclean lips a prophet
[58:55] a mightiest prophet of the Bible one of
[58:58] them I am a man with unclean lips and I
[59:01] dwell among people it's unclean lips
[59:03] will always be because I see the glory
[59:06] of God and he said when that angel cried
[59:09] the post of the temple Shook Back and
[59:12] Forth
[59:15] not only as opposed to the temple go to
[59:18] shake but the whole heavens and Earths
[59:20] go to shape
[59:22] the mountains of flea and a seal fade
[59:25] away and extreme highness from the face
[59:28] of him that sets upon the throne
[59:31] it's going to be a terrible time I'll
[59:33] tell you Senator friend you better be
[59:35] checking it up
[59:36] that's right now Isaiah said we'll
[59:40] always be I'm a man of unclean lips and
[59:43] I'll dwell among unclean people and I'm
[59:46] these people as unclean Lids now
[59:48] remember if such holy man
[59:52] recognize themselves sinners in the
[59:56] presence of God what will the Sinner and
[1:00:00] ungodly do it that day
[1:00:03] what will people do who set in the
[1:00:07] meetings
[1:00:09] what will the people do that seem the
[1:00:12] power of God that's heard the count down
[1:00:14] on the word
[1:00:15] that seen God manifest himself and
[1:00:18] Beyond a shadowed doubt every scripture
[1:00:21] fulfilled
[1:00:22] and will still try to make it to heaven
[1:00:25] without being born again and receive the
[1:00:27] Holy Ghost
[1:00:29] the Bible said if a righteous man be
[1:00:31] scarcely saved where will the Sinner and
[1:00:33] ungodly appear amen
[1:00:36] what kind of a place are we going to
[1:00:38] stand in if we see God unfold himself
[1:00:41] right before us and see the glory of God
[1:00:44] just the same as that man did and that
[1:00:46] kind of man cried up prophets and Sages
[1:00:50] upon whom the word is based upon if they
[1:00:54] cried and fell to their feet and
[1:00:56] screamed on man of Unholy lips
[1:00:58] uncleanness
[1:01:01] what will it be then for that man who
[1:01:03] won't even confess his sins
[1:01:06] what will it be for that teenager that
[1:01:09] won't confess his or her sins
[1:01:11] why would it be for that hard-hearted
[1:01:13] man of face he knows more about uh God's
[1:01:16] creation God does himself
[1:01:18] why do I have for that man spent all of
[1:01:20] his life trying to disprove the Bible
[1:01:23] where will that God appear at
[1:01:25] think of it
[1:01:27] Lord this is evangelism
[1:01:29] this is a time to shape people
[1:01:32] this is the time that God said there
[1:01:34] come a time he shut Mount Sinai one time
[1:01:37] but they're coming shaken again that he
[1:01:39] will only seek Mount Sania but he'd
[1:01:41] Shake everything that could be moved
[1:01:44] but did you notice the rest of scripture
[1:01:47] but we receive a kingdom that cannot
[1:01:50] believe me
[1:01:52] Hallelujah everything that can be shuck
[1:01:55] will be shaken
[1:01:57] the heavens are safe the Earth will
[1:01:59] shake heavens and earth will pass away
[1:02:01] but that word shall never pass away for
[1:02:05] all this rock I'll build my church and
[1:02:08] the Gates of Hell will ever pray
[1:02:10] [Applause]
[1:02:12] everything that can be shut will be
[1:02:14] shaken
[1:02:16] Kingdom which is a word of God himself
[1:02:18] and God is his word he don't shake
[1:02:21] himself
[1:02:22] hey man
[1:02:24] oh my but we receive a kingdom that
[1:02:28] cannot be moved
[1:02:29] it's unshakable said Paul the Hebrew
[1:02:33] writer such a person and such a man such
[1:02:37] a time and how they felt we have also
[1:02:40] ourselves we've seen the glory of God
[1:02:43] like this man did
[1:02:44] sir
[1:02:46] we've seen him we've seen the glory of
[1:02:48] God like Abraham saw it
[1:02:50] we saw the glory of God like Moses saw
[1:02:53] him the same pillar of power the same
[1:02:56] power of God the same Christ on
[1:02:59] revealing himself showing himself
[1:03:01] keeping his word in the last day
[1:03:04] how can we come by then and walk and
[1:03:06] treat it so lightly
[1:03:09] how can we walk around and hold our
[1:03:11] Creeds and denominations and not take
[1:03:13] the word of God Amen
[1:03:15] amen what will it be for us in that day
[1:03:17] how will it happen with us when we see
[1:03:20] the glory of God some people will stand
[1:03:22] off and they make fun of it some are
[1:03:25] laughing
[1:03:26] some will call it fanaticism some call
[1:03:28] it mental telepathy
[1:03:30] some call it Beelzebub
[1:03:33] some call it one thing or another as the
[1:03:36] old Proverbs is fools the walk with
[1:03:38] hobnail shoes Where Angels pray to God
[1:03:42] Ryan
[1:03:43] the fool is set in his heart there is no
[1:03:46] God when he sees God manifested so
[1:03:48] perfectly by this own word not by a
[1:03:51] Creed but by his word and that walked
[1:03:53] right over it and make fun of it he's a
[1:03:55] fool
[1:03:56] says God is the word God's made himself
[1:03:59] plain to him
[1:04:01] fool the Bible say
[1:04:03] what would it be for him when he has to
[1:04:05] stand in that place it'll be a it'll be
[1:04:08] terrible for that man in that day the
[1:04:10] ungodly
[1:04:12] repented Sinners old doesn't have any
[1:04:15] fear oh no a sinner that will repent he
[1:04:19] knows that there's a bloody sacrifice
[1:04:21] waiting is that it is
[1:04:24] that's what gives me the consolation
[1:04:26] right I've seen the glory of God I felt
[1:04:30] his power I know the touch of his hand I
[1:04:34] know the touch of his chastisement I
[1:04:36] know that he's God and I know I'm undone
[1:04:39] but there's one standing at a farming
[1:04:41] amen
[1:04:43] I also understands where it says father
[1:04:45] lay all of his iniquity upon me because
[1:04:48] he stood for me down on the earth
[1:04:49] Hallelujah then I'll walk to the throne
[1:04:52] of God boldly Heaven Grace in my heart
[1:04:54] the Lord is not by good verse but by his
[1:04:57] mercy on your faith not what I can do
[1:04:59] what I could join what I could say but
[1:05:02] it's by his grace that he said
[1:05:06] go under the poet the cult that screen
[1:05:09] on Amazing Grace how sweet
[1:05:11] let's save the rest like me once was
[1:05:14] lost but now I'm found blind but now I
[1:05:16] see
[1:05:18] how can I ever go to heaven how could
[1:05:20] you go to heaven we cannot do it we need
[1:05:23] no way for us to do it but there's one
[1:05:25] made the way and he is the way and how
[1:05:29] do we get to him by one Spirit his
[1:05:31] Spirit we're baptized into one body
[1:05:34] which will be raised up like an organs
[1:05:37] will go out of the earth and astronauts
[1:05:39] of his last name amen
[1:05:44] sure repentance Sinners don't have to
[1:05:47] worry someone is there in their place oh
[1:05:50] then after we have come into His
[1:05:53] presence now
[1:05:55] and we are known we've been in his
[1:05:57] presence we've seen do things that he
[1:05:59] did when he was here on Earth
[1:06:01] how do you know the how do you know the
[1:06:03] vine you're looking at because of fruit
[1:06:05] it Bears how do you know the church
[1:06:07] you're going to by the fruit of man amen
[1:06:10] Jesus said he that believeth on me the
[1:06:11] works that I do shall he do all things
[1:06:13] the SE signs shall follow them that
[1:06:16] believe
[1:06:17] huh we see he never did our dentist to
[1:06:20] go make denominations
[1:06:22] he never did our Danish to go make Creed
[1:06:25] but he warned us against such
[1:06:28] for whosoever shall take anything from
[1:06:30] it or add anything to it the same will
[1:06:32] be taken out of their part in The Book
[1:06:33] of Life
[1:06:35] so we're not our team to do them but
[1:06:37] stay with that word
[1:06:39] and if a man is stand of God he'll stay
[1:06:42] with the word because God can only send
[1:06:44] by his words
[1:06:47] must stay by his word then when we come
[1:06:50] into His presence
[1:06:52] when a man once comes into the presence
[1:06:54] of God he's changed forever
[1:06:56] if there's any change in doing
[1:06:59] now are there are those who can walk in
[1:07:02] the presence of God and pay no attention
[1:07:03] to it he was an ordained alive but if he
[1:07:07] was predestinated of God as soon as that
[1:07:09] first move hits he knows it
[1:07:11] that catches fire look at that little
[1:07:13] prostitute down there that day uh
[1:07:16] Samaria that woman she's in a bad shape
[1:07:18] mentally and physically we know that but
[1:07:22] as soon as she's seen that sign down the
[1:07:24] Messiah she said we know messiah's
[1:07:27] coming to do this
[1:07:28] thou must be his prophet he said I'm
[1:07:31] that Messiah that was wrote to come
[1:07:33] you recognize that she never asked one
[1:07:35] more question she started right quick
[1:07:37] with the responsibility to know that if
[1:07:39] she had found that and come into the
[1:07:41] presence of God she was responsible to
[1:07:43] tell somebody else about it
[1:07:46] Hallelujah
[1:07:49] right
[1:07:50] any man that comes into the presence of
[1:07:52] God is responsible
[1:07:55] before God from that men at all you tell
[1:07:57] somebody else
[1:08:00] look at Abraham look at Moses look at
[1:08:04] Peter look at Paul the moment they come
[1:08:07] into the presence of God recognize
[1:08:09] themselves Sinners and seal their
[1:08:11] testimony with their life
[1:08:14] look at the little lady she couldn't
[1:08:16] stay no longer she went to the city and
[1:08:18] told the man come see the man who told
[1:08:20] me the things I've done is in this
[1:08:22] Messiah
[1:08:23] they could not deny because it was
[1:08:25] scriptural certainly this they've got to
[1:08:28] do it a man when we got a responsibility
[1:08:30] of telling others that as Moses did as
[1:08:33] Peter did as Paul did after these things
[1:08:35] you've seen it and come into His
[1:08:37] presence you're responsible for the
[1:08:40] message to get to somebody else yes
[1:08:44] you just cannot sit still with it you
[1:08:47] must take it to someone else
[1:08:49] I never know a sister used to be your
[1:08:51] brother grandson's mother you sit right
[1:08:54] here in the church and she would sing

[1:09:11] Highway just found it and took up the
[1:09:14] highway there's something about it when
[1:09:16] you find Christ you cannot hold your
[1:09:19] peace any longer the rest of your days
[1:09:21] you are a changed person
[1:09:25] for when life and life comes together it
[1:09:28] may survive life
[1:09:30] true when the bulb connects with the
[1:09:33] wars if it's a correct bulb it's got to
[1:09:35] give life
[1:09:36] when the current and the above gets
[1:09:38] together there's nothing to do but
[1:09:40] scatter line
[1:09:41] it has to do it I'm on a man or a woman
[1:09:45] is predestinated to eternal life and
[1:09:48] they see the current of God catch that
[1:09:50] bomb it'll throw light everywhere
[1:09:53] it might not be over a 10 watt but
[1:09:56] she'll scatter what lies you got
[1:09:59] a 500 watt scatter 10 watt light yeah
[1:10:03] give your life let your life so shine
[1:10:06] before man that they might see your good
[1:10:08] works and glorify the Father which is in
[1:10:10] heaven yes sir when a man comes in
[1:10:13] contact with God he recognizes himself
[1:10:16] no good
[1:10:17] how can a man walk around brag about how
[1:10:20] big he is what all he's done when he's
[1:10:22] nothing
[1:10:24] it's nothing to begin with
[1:10:26] one day down in Memphis Tennessee or one
[1:10:28] I don't think Memphis is one of the
[1:10:30] places there I was with Brother Davis is
[1:10:32] having a Revival that might have been in
[1:10:34] Memphis and we was went to a Coliseum
[1:10:36] and had a in there another Coliseum is
[1:10:40] kind of a art gallery and they had the
[1:10:42] great statues that they'd got from
[1:10:44] different parts of the earth of
[1:10:46] different Hercules and so forth and
[1:10:48] great artists of painted and then they
[1:10:51] had the analysis of a man that weighed
[1:10:53] 150 pounds you know how much he's worth
[1:10:55] 84 cents
[1:10:57] that's all he is 84 cents is all it all
[1:11:01] the chemicals you can get out of him
[1:11:03] he's just got enough White Horse to
[1:11:04] sprinkle A Hen's Nest and he's got to
[1:11:06] have fun just a little bit of calcium a
[1:11:08] little potash it would all sell for 84
[1:11:11] cents but we just take care of that 84
[1:11:13] cents and baby it around there's two
[1:11:15] boys stand there and one looked the
[1:11:17] other and said Jim we're not worth very
[1:11:18] much Army he said no we're not John I
[1:11:20] said but wait a minute boys you got a
[1:11:22] soul in there it's worth Ten Thousand
[1:11:24] Words that's been cannot be Redeemed by
[1:11:27] the power of God if you just let it man
[1:11:30] when he sees these things he's
[1:11:32] responsible to tell others
[1:11:33] I saw it when I was just a boy I've
[1:11:35] spent the whole life at it only story I
[1:11:37] got one life we said ten thousand if I
[1:11:40] had an eternity I still want to tell
[1:11:42] people about it because it's the
[1:11:43] greatest thing I ever found if you were
[1:11:46] eating Ezekiel 33 33rd chapter of
[1:11:48] Ezekiel there was a Watchman set on a
[1:11:51] tower and this wasman was responsible
[1:11:54] for the entire city
[1:11:57] amen I'll wait wake yourselves to your
[1:12:01] spiritual conscience a minute well I get
[1:12:03] to this scripture
[1:12:05] that Watchman had to be a trained man
[1:12:08] he had to know what he was doing
[1:12:11] for At Any distance as soon as it arose
[1:12:15] the enemy he could detect it
[1:12:19] he could tell their March
[1:12:21] he could tell their color
[1:12:23] he could tell her Rank and file
[1:12:25] just as far as the human eyes could see
[1:12:27] he could see it and he was higher than
[1:12:30] the rest of them
[1:12:31] for he was trained to know the enemy and
[1:12:35] God required the whole city of his hands
[1:12:39] Watchman for the night
[1:12:41] Hallelujah that's the way God's soldiers
[1:12:44] are today
[1:12:45] they're trained to the word
[1:12:48] when anything comes up scholar Lord
[1:12:49] polished to it and got something else
[1:12:52] that's not scripture they warn their
[1:12:54] congregation amen amen anything is not
[1:12:56] viable anything it's not it's not
[1:12:59] Godlike such as having soup suppers
[1:13:02] dances and everything else to pay off
[1:13:04] the pastors
[1:13:05] those things are wrong phone call games
[1:13:08] and card parties in their churches
[1:13:10] that's wrong
[1:13:12] and the real Watchman on the wall who's
[1:13:15] once been in the presence of God ever if
[1:13:18] he isn't on the wall if he just follows
[1:13:21] to be on the wall the wall may not be
[1:13:23] any higher than the rest of the
[1:13:24] congregation
[1:13:25] but if he's a correct Watchman God
[1:13:27] raises he put up in the stairs that the
[1:13:29] rest of them never gets to but he
[1:13:32] watches the fly and God requires it of
[1:13:35] him
[1:13:37] man of God who stands in the presence of
[1:13:40] God and knows God is God and know that
[1:13:43] God keeps his word and watch God perform
[1:13:45] himself and do his duty and keep his
[1:13:48] word that no matter how many
[1:13:50] organizations
[1:13:52] he knows a rank and power of the enemy
[1:13:58] amen
[1:13:59] he knows what to tell the congregation a
[1:14:02] real Watchman
[1:14:04] ah
[1:14:06] if we have confessed and he is that
[1:14:09] we've been in this presence and we have
[1:14:12] confessed our sins
[1:14:13] they're blotted out the book of his
[1:14:16] memory
[1:14:18] now there's nobody but God could do that
[1:14:21] now you can do anything to me I'll
[1:14:22] forgive you but I'll remember
[1:14:25] if I do anything to you you forgive me
[1:14:28] but you'll remember
[1:14:29] but God can forgive and forget it amen
[1:14:35] amen think of that man don't even
[1:14:37] remember
[1:14:40] amen
[1:14:41] that makes me feel good when it started
[1:14:45] anymore
[1:14:52] nothing but God can do that
[1:14:55] he said he would blotted out of his book
[1:14:57] of memory
[1:14:59] I can't do it you can't do it
[1:15:01] because we've only got these little
[1:15:03] finite senses but he's infinite God he
[1:15:07] can absolutely forget that it ever was
[1:15:10] done
[1:15:11] Hallelujah
[1:15:13] [Music]
[1:15:15] praise God

[1:20:46] way to rid sin God wanted somebody to go
[1:20:49] for him and he said here am I send me
[1:20:53] he had been in the presence of God and
[1:20:55] had confessed his sins and then cleansed
[1:20:58] from his sins and was ready for service
[1:21:03] amen
[1:21:05] as the poet caught that said million
[1:21:07] million now in sin and shame are dying
[1:21:09] listen to their sad and bitter cry

[1:21:37] or Shake hand and have a cream but brain
[1:21:39] delivers to their soul
[1:21:41] some good godly man yes Isaiah confessed
[1:21:45] his sins and was cleansed after Jacob
[1:21:48] had wrestled all night in confessing his
[1:21:52] sins

[1:21:55] Panther

[1:22:12] means supplanter that's deceiver had run

[1:22:19] of God at pimple in the face of God he
[1:22:23] got a hold of God and wouldn't turn him
[1:22:25] loose
[1:22:26] God we need for Jacobson
[1:22:29] he held on
[1:22:30] to the face of God
[1:22:32] in the presence of God
[1:22:35] he stayed until it was sent up God said
[1:22:38] let me go

[1:22:45] went away Justified and saved

[1:22:52] to know that he had wrestled through
[1:22:54] that's he had seen signs of God he'd had
[1:22:57] dreams about God but this is one time he
[1:23:00] was in the face of God in the presence
[1:23:03] of God
[1:23:04] think of it friends now as we hurry up
[1:23:06] in the presence of God a man's changed
[1:23:10] Jacob was changed now he could walk with
[1:23:13] God yes he was a different man than what
[1:23:16] he was when he went up there the battle
[1:23:18] was now over yes sir and he began to
[1:23:21] build an altar he hadn't been used to
[1:23:23] building orders you know
[1:23:25] but I'll tell you when you come in the
[1:23:27] presence of God you want to build an
[1:23:28] altar somewhere
[1:23:29] you want to find somewhere where you can
[1:23:31] pray he built an altar he was cleansed
[1:23:34] and God had one and Jacob was changed
[1:23:39] from Jacob's supplanter to Israel of
[1:23:43] Prince having power with God
[1:23:46] that's what happened to Jacob
[1:23:48] it's a planter The Deceiver
[1:23:51] the unrighteous the Unholy the deceiver
[1:23:55] deceived his brother
[1:23:57] stole the birthright says it was from
[1:23:59] his brother took a little dirty way of
[1:24:02] doing it such a deceiver he deceived his
[1:24:05] father-in-law but popper sticks made
[1:24:07] speckled cabs when the cow has been
[1:24:09] pregnant he'd come down look at the
[1:24:11] Sheep but she has speckled stick make
[1:24:13] speckled cattle give him birthmarks
[1:24:15] deceiver deceiving his own father-in-law
[1:24:18] deceived his mother deceived his daddy
[1:24:21] deceived his brother but when he once
[1:24:23] got in the he was a shyster he was
[1:24:25] running everywhere he went always on the
[1:24:27] run from God he's on the run from his
[1:24:29] brother but when he come into the
[1:24:31] presence of God he recognized he was a
[1:24:33] sinner
[1:24:36] what did he do
[1:24:37] what did he do he seen his opportunity
[1:24:40] he hadn't met something that he didn't
[1:24:42] even think about before and he stayed
[1:24:45] there until all sins was gone
[1:24:47] oh my
[1:24:49] God got him
[1:24:51] in his own presence
[1:24:53] God manages a way to get man in their
[1:24:55] presence and to make their decision some
[1:24:57] of them run from him some run to him if
[1:25:00] they're predestinated to life they
[1:25:01] believe it they hang on to it if they're
[1:25:03] not they try to get away and says
[1:25:04] nothing to it see and that's the guy
[1:25:06] that's lost the guy that confesses his
[1:25:09] sin shall have pardon if you hide your
[1:25:11] sin you'll not Prosper no so Jacob when
[1:25:15] he it was the next day he met Esau his
[1:25:18] brother he didn't need no help from him
[1:25:21] he didn't need his armies he is this is
[1:25:24] building orders
[1:25:28] he wasn't afraid of Esau no more
[1:25:31] Psalms 16 8. David said I have set the
[1:25:36] Lord before me
[1:25:37] that's a good thing to do
[1:25:39] Psalm 16 8 I set the Lord before me so
[1:25:43] he could
[1:25:44] not be
[1:25:46] confused about it
[1:25:48] uh he wanted to be conscious of his
[1:25:51] presence so David said I have set the
[1:25:54] lord always before my face
[1:25:56] now ah David have set the Lord before my
[1:26:01] face
[1:26:02] always to be conscious conscious of
[1:26:06] God's presence wouldn't that be a good
[1:26:08] lesson for all of us tonight sent the
[1:26:11] Lord before a face so we'll be conscious
[1:26:13] of his presence
[1:26:15] put in first
[1:26:17] why but he first before you why then you
[1:26:21] won't sin when you are realizing that
[1:26:25] constantly you're in the presence of God
[1:26:28] when you realize God's around you watch
[1:26:31] what you say
[1:26:33] a man when he thinks God's gone he'll
[1:26:36] cuss
[1:26:38] he'll lust after women
[1:26:40] he'll do you steal cheat lie he'll do
[1:26:45] anything when he thinks that God don't
[1:26:48] see him but bring him into the presence
[1:26:50] of God
[1:26:51] to stop it right now
[1:26:53] and David said I have put the lord
[1:26:56] always before me
[1:26:59] that's a good thing the water of God
[1:27:01] said his man after his own heart
[1:27:03] man will do everything when he thinks
[1:27:05] that God is near but when he realizes
[1:27:08] that God's here do you ever know it's a
[1:27:10] sinner let a Godly person walk up you'll
[1:27:12] quit he's cursing yeah he's got any
[1:27:13] respects at all
[1:27:15] you won't tell the dirty jokes that he
[1:27:17] would have told see you leave off that
[1:27:19] because he knows that he's in the
[1:27:21] presence of God because God dwells in
[1:27:23] the Tabernacle of his people see after
[1:27:26] David did this he said
[1:27:29] my heart shall rejoice we should read
[1:27:32] Psalm 16. my heart will rejoice and my
[1:27:36] flesh shall rest and Hope
[1:27:39] why my heart shall rejoice because of
[1:27:42] God God before me all the time
[1:27:44] and my flesh shall Rest In Hope if I die
[1:27:47] I'll be raised up again or he'll not
[1:27:50] suffer his holy one and see corruption
[1:27:52] neither will it even Stone
[1:27:54] see when David put God before him and
[1:27:58] was conscious that constantly he was in
[1:28:01] the presence of God
[1:28:03] seek ye first the kingdom of God now
[1:28:06] listen church I love you I want you to
[1:28:09] listen to me now if brother McCullough
[1:28:10] you say I'm going to say something
[1:28:13] always put the Lord before you
[1:28:15] and don't you do nothing that you
[1:28:17] wouldn't do in his presence
[1:28:19] because he's watching over you
[1:28:21] see the Lord is encamped about those who
[1:28:24] fear Him
[1:28:25] you know he just stays right near you
[1:28:27] and he knows everything you're doing and
[1:28:29] you must recognize that
[1:28:31] when you start to tell her I don't do it
[1:28:33] remember God's listening at you
[1:28:35] if you start to do a little cheat don't
[1:28:37] you do it God's looking at you
[1:28:39] if you start to take his name in vain
[1:28:41] don't do it God's listening at you start
[1:28:43] smoking cigarette he's watching you
[1:28:47] is we used to sing a song All Along on
[1:28:50] the road to the souls to Abode there's
[1:28:52] an eye watching you every step that you
[1:28:55] take this great eye is awake there's an
[1:28:57] eye watching you
[1:28:59] remember do like David put the lord
[1:29:02] always before your face then your heart
[1:29:05] will rejoice and your flesh shall Rest
[1:29:08] In Hope for he promised it yesterday he
[1:29:11] knew that he had raised up because God
[1:29:14] had promised it
[1:29:16] all right
[1:29:18] when we come into His presence we're a
[1:29:20] change never to be the same look all
[1:29:23] down to the ages of every Walk of Life
[1:29:25] but man look at Abraham
[1:29:28] you say well the changed life is just
[1:29:30] for ministers oh no the change lies for
[1:29:33] everybody
[1:29:35] now Abraham was a farmer
[1:29:39] but when he heard God's voice speaking
[1:29:42] to him and saw that Vision he was a
[1:29:44] changed man from that time on he
[1:29:47] separated himself from his Kindred from
[1:29:49] all his associates and walked as a
[1:29:51] pilgrim in a Stranger in a Strange Land
[1:29:53] the rest of his life
[1:29:54] dwelling intense because he clearly
[1:29:57] confessed that he was seeking the city
[1:29:59] he was Builder and maker was gone he
[1:30:01] know there was a God and there was a
[1:30:03] city somewhere whose Builder and maker
[1:30:05] was gone
[1:30:06] Bruce 11 tells us that he's seeking a
[1:30:09] city as Builder and maker was God he was
[1:30:11] a changed man yet he was nothing but a
[1:30:14] mere farmer but he saw a vision and come
[1:30:16] into the presence of God and he was a
[1:30:18] changed man from then on Moses he was a
[1:30:22] shepherd
[1:30:23] but he was a changed man when he come
[1:30:25] into the presence of God he was a coward
[1:30:28] he was running from Pharaoh with the
[1:30:30] whole Army behind him but with a stick
[1:30:32] in his hand he went back and took the
[1:30:34] whole nation
[1:30:37] why he come into the presence of God he
[1:30:40] was a changed man a Shepherd Peter a
[1:30:43] fisherman
[1:30:44] know nothing about fishing or know
[1:30:46] nothing about God only thing he probably
[1:30:48] know was how to catch fish but when he'd
[1:30:51] come in the presence of God and see the
[1:30:53] great Creator who could create fish when
[1:30:55] he told him let down the net for the
[1:30:57] draw there wasn't any fish there he just
[1:30:59] pulled his Nets up but he said ask Thy
[1:31:01] word Lord I believe that you're the Son
[1:31:03] of God and if you let a violate on that
[1:31:05] you told me to do it as your word
[1:31:07] because you and your word are the same
[1:31:09] I'll let down the net and when you begin
[1:31:11] to pull he said he said depart Lord I'm
[1:31:13] a sinful man
[1:31:15] a fisherman
[1:31:17] after Peter met Christ he was never the
[1:31:21] same anymore the answer words was so
[1:31:23] true to God he was giving the keys to
[1:31:25] the kingdom
[1:31:26] yes sir Paul a self-style Pharisee
[1:31:30] educated and trained in all the religion
[1:31:32] of the that there was in the world in
[1:31:34] that day one of the highest known
[1:31:35] scholars in the land but when he come
[1:31:38] before that Pillar of Fire one day the
[1:31:41] God that he had persecuted eagerly
[1:31:45] he was the Pharisee he didn't believe
[1:31:47] that God was a man
[1:31:48] he know God was a pillar of fire he led
[1:31:51] his people out of Egypt
[1:31:53] and with them all along
[1:31:55] but when he saw this Pillar of Fire he
[1:31:57] fell on his face and he heard a voice
[1:31:59] saying so I persecuted Sal means that
[1:32:01] who are you Lord he said I'm Jesus
[1:32:07] I said how have you been baptized
[1:32:10] he had been the presence of God he was a
[1:32:14] changed man for now
[1:32:16] you've been the presence of God it
[1:32:19] changes a man Charles G Finney a lawyer
[1:32:23] a great uh Philadelphia lawyer but when
[1:32:27] he come into the presence of God he
[1:32:29] dropped his law of study and become a
[1:32:31] mightiest preacher of this nation's ever
[1:32:33] had yet
[1:32:35] he was a preacher because one day he'd
[1:32:37] come in the presence of God
[1:32:40] he thought what's the instead of
[1:32:41] Industry you know his book I got his
[1:32:43] autobiography he went out to pray he
[1:32:46] thought he was a preacher he had a
[1:32:47] desire that he wanted to preach and he
[1:32:49] had him a few sermons to try to preach
[1:32:51] he went out one day out of his office to
[1:32:54] pray went out of the woods he got down
[1:32:56] behind an old blowing down tree where
[1:32:57] he'd go every afternoon very religious
[1:33:00] but he didn't believe in that there's
[1:33:01] two women in the church kept saying Mr
[1:33:03] Finney we're praying that you received
[1:33:06] the Holy Ghost
[1:33:07] he said I got the Holy Ghost
[1:33:10] but I'm a preacher
[1:33:12] the Mississippi you're a great man and
[1:33:15] you got a great hold of the word but you
[1:33:17] need the Holy Ghost we're praying for
[1:33:19] you sweet little women
[1:33:21] so he went on oh
[1:33:23] so every day he'd go out
[1:33:26] behind his office his boss and all that
[1:33:29] married work and he'd go out of his law
[1:33:30] office to go out there to pray and one
[1:33:33] day he was out there pre and he heard a
[1:33:35] breast breed he thought his boss was

[1:33:54] a purpose

[1:33:58] sheets
[1:34:00] he said maybe that women's right
[1:34:02] I'm ashamed for somebody to see me
[1:34:04] talking to my God
[1:34:05] but I think it was an honor for somebody
[1:34:07] to see me talking to my boss
[1:34:09] how much greater is my Lord than my boss

[1:45:01] but just thinking on the subject of
[1:45:04] dwelling in the presence of God and we
[1:45:07] see tonight the effect that is taken
[1:45:09] upon holy man to come into your presence
[1:45:13] what effect it had upon Him Sages
[1:45:16] great powerful Prophets
[1:45:20] ordained by God and said to preach the
[1:45:23] word and yet meeting face to face and
[1:45:25] fall to the ground like a dead man
[1:45:28] what are we going to do it that day Lord
[1:45:30] we thought it over we've been thinking
[1:45:33] it some 40 or 50 hands has been thinking
[1:45:36] it Lord for they just raised them hands
[1:45:39] or Hearts beneath the hand has been
[1:45:41] thinking about meeting him since we've
[1:45:43] been speaking what would they do if they
[1:45:46] had the meeting
[1:45:47] my hands Lords up what will I do now
[1:45:51] father I've got many things that I do
[1:45:53] wrong I've just confessed my sin this
[1:45:55] morning before the church as I confessed
[1:45:58] with you on top of the mountain the
[1:45:59] other morning when it was blowing and
[1:46:01] snowing and up there on top of the
[1:46:03] mountain the high cried out and asked
[1:46:05] you to forgive me for my stupidity and
[1:46:09] how I've dreaded to come before my
[1:46:11] brother who some of them regard me as
[1:46:13] your Prophet servant and Lord how I
[1:46:15] hated to come to for them and tell them
[1:46:17] of a stupid act that I would do a thing
[1:46:20] like that but God is good for my soul
[1:46:22] that I confess my sins and not hide them
[1:46:25] so to be honest with you and right
[1:46:27] before the people I have confessed it
[1:46:30] Lord I'm wrong I'm all together wrong I
[1:46:33] pray forgiveness and then father I've
[1:46:35] been dilatory about you serving him many
[1:46:39] times maybe I could have went longer
[1:46:40] when I Didn't Do It father I confess my
[1:46:43] sins I want the angel of God to cleanse
[1:46:46] me from that of the blood of Jesus other
[1:46:48] hands went up tonight some of them maybe
[1:46:50] has never asked forgiveness before but
[1:46:53] I'm sure of this one thing if we'll
[1:46:55] confess our sins God will blot them out
[1:46:58] put them in the sea of forgiveness and
[1:47:00] never remember him no more
[1:47:02] and fathers I confess mine about
[1:47:05] misbehaving before them people I didn't
[1:47:08] carry on myself like a servant of Christ
[1:47:10] I didn't I was afraid that man might be
[1:47:12] angry with me and think I didn't want to
[1:47:14] hurt his feelings but I didn't think for
[1:47:16] what I was doing to you Lord and I I
[1:47:18] prayed that you forgive me and now
[1:47:21] father I know that if I ask forgiveness
[1:47:24] I have forgiveness and you put him in a
[1:47:26] sea of forgiveness and you'll never
[1:47:28] remember that no more God I'm thankful
[1:47:30] for that and I pray that you'll let
[1:47:32] every person here that has sin or
[1:47:34] besetting sin of anything before them
[1:47:37] may they remove it and put the Lord
[1:47:39] before them like David did for now we'd
[1:47:42] cry out woe is me for I have seen the
[1:47:45] glory of God I'm a man of unclean lips
[1:47:48] or a woman or girl of unclean lips boy
[1:47:51] or something whatever we might be we're
[1:47:53] unclean and we ask for the blood of
[1:47:55] Jesus Christ the appropriated sacrifice
[1:47:58] that cleanse us from all sin that we
[1:48:01] might ever dwell in his presence let us
[1:48:04] go from here tonight with our hearts
[1:48:05] rejoicing and our flesh resting in Hope
[1:48:08] knowing this that when Jesus does come
[1:48:11] we'll be raised with him in his likeness
[1:48:13] and shall meet him in the air in the
[1:48:15] Rapture when the countdown is finally

[1:48:33] of Mercy between mercy and judgment is
[1:48:36] being closed those who will accept Mercy
[1:48:38] will step in those who will not come in
[1:48:41] will have to suffer judgment God closes
[1:48:43] the door May there not be a door closed
[1:48:46] tonight to every one of these confessing

[1:55:22] of the king
[1:55:27] I looked over
[1:55:29] Dan Roberts and his family there

[1:55:35] what sometimes we would do to one
[1:55:37] another
[1:55:38] how mean we could be at times
[1:55:42] but I remembered one time my elder
[1:55:44] brother was causing a little bit of
[1:55:46] trouble
[1:55:49] and my dad was concerned so he prayed to
[1:55:51] the Lord he said get his attention
[1:55:55] break his arm if you need to
[1:55:58] and my brother came home with a broken
[1:56:00] arm that day
[1:56:02] and me and my younger brother said oh no
[1:56:05] be better we better respect that
[1:56:09] but there's a greater one than that and
[1:56:11] that's God
[1:56:13] but see not only can he mend it but he
[1:56:16] can forgive it and cleanse it if you'll
[1:56:18] just say I'm sorry Lord
