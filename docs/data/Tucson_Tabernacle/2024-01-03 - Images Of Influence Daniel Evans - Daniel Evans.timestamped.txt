[1:20] Greetings to everyone. Greetings
[1:23] to the visitors. I have a list of a few
[1:25] visitors here, but I I think that
[1:27] there's there's a few more. Um, brother
[1:30] Steve Babcock and family. God bless you.
[1:33] Welcome. Raise your hand if you could.
[1:35] So, we know you. God bless you. Welcome,
[1:42] brother David and brother Christian in
[1:44] the front.
[1:46] Oh, yeah. you brothers, they're
[1:48] regulars.
[1:50] Welcome, my friends. Um, and uh, Brother
[1:54] Rome Johnson, Jr., brother, God bless
[1:58] you. Welcome.
[2:01] I bet I bet you can't guess who he's
[2:02] related to.
[2:05] Brother Michael Walters, my my friend.
[2:07] God bless you. Welcome.
[2:13] I um I wanted to mention uh a few people
[2:17] have asked about brother Jonathan,
[2:19] cousin Jonathan. He's uh brother
[2:21] Jonathan's been busy. He's he's
[2:23] finishing up his certification
[2:26] and uh he's been trying to get a job and
[2:28] he's been working hard. Um and uh he's
[2:32] he's doing he's doing just fine. He's
[2:34] just kind of a little bit over his head
[2:37] with work and busyness. So, he's a he's
[2:40] a good friend. Not only is he my cousin,
[2:42] he's also a good friend of mine. No,
[2:45] we're we're not really cousins.
[2:48] We are brothers, though.
[2:51] I wanted to uh I wanted to mention
[2:54] Brother Silas and I've been talking,
[2:56] Brother Silas Lindsay here have been
[2:57] talking over the past few days. And
[3:00] brother Silas's dad passed away a couple
[3:03] weeks ago now. And Silas mentioned he
[3:08] said you know brother he says I feel
[3:10] like when somebody passes on that we
[3:13] should always say something about that
[3:15] person about his life. Brother David
[3:18] Lindseay lived in Jeffersonville
[3:20] and um Brother Silas recently went back
[3:24] to CA take care of his estate. But none
[3:26] of us probably know Brother David
[3:28] Lindseay here. But I would like to say
[3:31] just a few words for him in honor of his
[3:33] life and also in honor of my good friend
[3:37] here, brother Silas. He was born,
[3:43] brothers, if you could put up the
[3:44] picture. He was born on June 26, 1949.
[3:49] Brother um Silas wrote this. He's an he
[3:51] was an outgoing man. He loved the Lord.
[3:54] Married mom in 1977 and they moved to
[3:56] Jeffersonville to go to the Brandom
[3:58] Tabernacle. Dad liked electronics and
[4:00] computers. He was a longtime computer
[4:03] programmer. He loved to fellowship with
[4:06] believers. He was preceded in death by
[4:07] mom who passed away in March 2021.
[4:10] He looked forward to seeing her again
[4:12] most of all. He was born in Hot Springs,
[4:15] Arkansas. He and my grandmother, Ethel
[4:18] Lindsay, attended a couple of Brother
[4:20] Bram's meetings.
[4:22] I couldn't have asked for a better
[4:23] father, and he was more than that. He
[4:26] was also my friend and my brother.
[4:30] Brother David was uh he's also special
[4:32] to me. I um preached my my first sermon
[4:37] and it was just a couple years ago in
[4:40] Jeffersonville and
[4:44] afterward I uh
[4:47] I came back and I was I was leaving
[4:50] while we were in the back and greeting
[4:52] the people as they left and uh brother
[4:56] David said that he wanted to talk to me
[4:59] after service and uh that's um James and
[5:03] Betty Phillips there. Wow. I don't know
[5:06] if uh probably many of you know brother
[5:08] James, sister Betty, but there's um
[5:10] brother and sister Lindsay there on the
[5:12] left.
[5:13] Um but uh brother Silas or brother David
[5:17] said he wanted to talk to me about about
[5:20] this sermon that I preached and we went
[5:22] back in the back and and he had just the
[5:24] kindest words
[5:27] for me and he said that
[5:32] it really affected his life. And I was
[5:36] talking about the images that we create
[5:38] in our minds and and he said he said you
[5:42] know he says I never thought
[5:45] that me that my religion
[5:50] could be based on something that I've
[5:52] just been raised with that I've just
[5:55] been I've just thought my whole life I
[5:57] never never really questioned it and
[5:59] I've been brought up and I have this
[6:01] image of how things should be and he
[6:02] said I never thought that that could be
[6:04] my religion.
[6:06] And brother Silas and and him, he said
[6:09] that that they would talk about that
[6:11] often.
[6:13] And
[6:15] brother Silas didn't know when he was
[6:18] mentioning that when he he told me, he
[6:20] says, "If you could say something about
[6:22] my dad, he said, you know, we talked
[6:24] about that message that you preached
[6:26] called images many many times." And uh
[6:30] what brother Silas didn't know is I was
[6:32] praying about ministering on a very
[6:35] similar topic this morning and I took
[6:37] that as vindication that I should um
[6:41] that I should go ahead with that. He um,
[6:45] brother Silas would I mean, Brother
[6:47] David would always come and whenever I
[6:49] was ministering Jeffersonville, he'd
[6:50] come and he he'd listen to me and he
[6:52] always liked to talk after service and
[6:55] and he had that excitement about the
[6:57] West and he told me, he says, "I've
[6:59] always wanted to go out there and
[7:02] brother Silas came here to to establish
[7:06] himself and get everything ready with
[7:08] the ultimate goal of his dad coming and
[7:11] joining joining him here. He's never
[7:14] been He never came out west, did he? His
[7:16] whole life.
[7:17] He was here a couple times.
[7:18] Oh, he did? Okay. He I know he wanted to
[7:21] come and
[7:25] the Lord took him. Obviously, he didn't
[7:28] get to come, but I think he went to a
[7:29] much better place than Tucson, Arizona.
[7:32] But I He's a He's an important person.
[7:35] He was he was a friend of mine. He
[7:37] always gave me such encouragement.
[7:39] And uh I liked he'd always sit there in
[7:41] the back of the church and and when I
[7:43] would preach, he just couldn't wait for
[7:47] me to get back there because he wanted
[7:49] to grab my hand and he wanted to talk
[7:51] and he wanted to talk about the Lord and
[7:52] he wanted to talk about um what the
[7:55] message was. But he was he was a good
[7:58] friend and and as brother Silas said, he
[8:02] was a good dad. And uh, Brother Silas, I
[8:06] really appreciated what you what you
[8:07] said, saying that not only was was he my
[8:10] dad, but he was my friend. I think about
[8:13] that when I think about Daniel, my son,
[8:16] and I always want to have that
[8:17] relationship with him that we have now.
[8:20] But, Brother David Lindsay um, has gone,
[8:24] as I said, has gone to be with the Lord.
[8:27] and a sweet, as far as my interaction
[8:31] with him, a sweet, happy person that
[8:36] loved the Lord, that loved to talk about
[8:39] his word, and was just really an
[8:42] encouragement always to be around. So,
[8:45] everybody, greet brother Silas this
[8:47] afternoon as when we leave the service.
[8:50] Um, I wish you all could have met him,
[8:53] but one day we will. It might be a
[8:56] thousand years from now. It might be a
[8:58] million years from now. Or it might be
[9:00] tomorrow.
[9:02] You'll see this man not very tall.
[9:07] He'll be maybe 25. He's taller than
[9:10] that. Maybe 25 years old.
[9:13] And you'll shake his hand and maybe
[9:17] he'll say, "Hi, brother or sister. My
[9:19] name is David Lindsay." He'll say, "Oh,
[9:22] I remember seeing your picture up on the
[9:24] screen and I remember we I was friends
[9:27] with your son. He fellow we fellowship
[9:29] together at the Tucson Tabernacle."
[9:31] There's coming a day, friends, that that
[9:33] we're going to meet a lot of people.
[9:35] And we think about eternity and we
[9:37] think, well, eternity is so long that
[9:40] well, what are we going to do for all
[9:42] that time? Well, we have all these
[9:43] people to meet and by the time we meet
[9:45] the last one, we'll probably have
[9:46] forgotten the first ones that we've met.
[9:48] So then we're going to have to go and
[9:50] we're going to have to meet him again
[9:51] and talk about the Lord. And you know,
[9:53] God is so great. God is so good that
[9:57] even in eternity, if we could understand
[10:00] it, which we can't, but even in eternity
[10:02] is not going to be enough time to
[10:05] worship him and to praise him.
[10:08] Thank God that we have a promise,
[10:11] brother Silas, that we will meet our
[10:13] loved ones again. If we are truly firmly
[10:17] anchored in the Lord Jesus Christ, then
[10:20] we will
[10:22] meet those meet those loved ones that
[10:25] have gone on.
[10:27] The title of my sermon today is Images
[10:31] of Influence.
[10:34] And it's something that it's it's really
[10:38] dear to my heart. And I I think that we
[10:41] judge everything that we do upon the
[10:45] things the way that we've grown up and
[10:46] the way that we've worshiped and the way
[10:48] that we've been taught. And I think that
[10:49] we have to be careful about judging
[10:52] everything that way. I look back, it's
[10:55] the last day of the year, and I look
[10:57] back to 2023 and what's been
[11:00] accomplished in this church. We started,
[11:02] we got a new website. We had a family
[11:04] camp. We've more than doubled in size in
[11:07] our congregation. We made an upper room
[11:11] for for the youth and then we made a
[11:13] lower room for the youth. We have
[11:15] regular communion services. We have
[11:17] regular church gatherings. We have
[11:19] potlucks and we have volleyball and
[11:22] those things. We have a youth choir. We
[11:25] have our first voted in pastor since the
[11:28] founding pastor, Brother Perry Green. We
[11:30] will soon have an officially voted in
[11:33] officers of the church for the s first
[11:36] time and we're going to soon renovate
[11:38] the church. I really want to get started
[11:41] over in the fellowship hall. It's one of
[11:43] those things where sometimes you think
[11:45] well we should do this but then when the
[11:49] Lord starts really putting that pressure
[11:52] and and it's something for me now it's
[11:55] starting to say, "Okay, we got to get
[11:57] this done. We got to get this done now.
[12:00] So, I'm really pushing to get to get our
[12:03] our fellowship hall over there
[12:04] renovated. We're going to renovate the
[12:06] front there and then maybe if the Lord's
[12:09] willing, we'll renovate the whole
[12:10] sanctuary. And we're just going to keep
[12:13] moving in that direction. These things,
[12:17] you might not think they're important,
[12:19] but they are important.
[12:21] They are a ministry. You may not think,
[12:24] and I will be talking about this today,
[12:26] you may not think things like
[12:28] construction or things like paint or
[12:31] things like a parking lot. You may not
[12:33] think that that's part of the ministry,
[12:34] but it is very, very important.
[12:38] And one thing that has been such a
[12:41] blessing to all of us, we've baptized at
[12:43] least 56 people this year.
[12:48] What a what a blessing. Yeah.
[12:52] Amen.
[12:55] And probably we'll baptize more today.
[12:59] And in praying about these things and in
[13:01] in going over Lord, what do you want me
[13:03] to say in this year end? My question for
[13:07] the Lord is, Lord, we had a good year
[13:12] by the standards that are in my mind and
[13:15] probably by the standards that are in
[13:17] the congregation's mind. But my question
[13:19] is, did this year please you God?
[13:25] The world has one way of looking at
[13:28] things.
[13:30] And we all have ideas in our minds about
[13:32] how a church should be, but we shouldn't
[13:35] judge our ex successes by the metrics
[13:38] that the world may use. We should judge
[13:41] our successes
[13:43] and progress by God's word.
[13:47] I was going through some notes a little
[13:51] while ago, this past week,
[13:54] and I came across something that I wrote
[13:57] in April
[13:59] of 2022. This is before I ever even
[14:02] considered that I might be pastor of
[14:03] this church or pastor anywhere else for
[14:05] that matter. And I had no desire and no
[14:09] even thoughts of moving that way. But
[14:13] let me read to you what I wrote in my
[14:15] notes. I said this.
[14:20] My deepest desire
[14:22] and why I am at this church.
[14:26] It is not anywhere close to where I
[14:28] think it should be. But I see in the
[14:31] Tucson Tabernacle as possibly a place
[14:33] where I can one day bring people to
[14:36] introduce them to Christ.
[14:39] And what's so sad
[14:42] to me is that back then my heart was so
[14:44] troubled because I didn't know of a
[14:46] church in the so-called message
[14:51] that I could bring someone to and would
[14:53] put Christ first.
[14:57] That was my opinion. That was my
[14:59] perspective.
[15:01] But this time in April of 2022, I was
[15:04] really down and really struggling like
[15:07] Lord, I just want a place that I could
[15:10] bring people to, that I can witness to,
[15:12] and they will come here and they will be
[15:14] introduced to Jesus Christ and not a
[15:16] denomination, not a cult, not a strange
[15:19] way of thinking, but to Christ and to
[15:22] this book right here.
[15:24] It's something that I always wanted.
[15:28] And back to my note,
[15:30] I said this. One of the aspects of
[15:32] introducing someone to Christ is to show
[15:34] them that God promised a forerunner for
[15:37] both his first coming and his second.
[15:40] That forerunner came with a tremendous
[15:42] message of love, holiness, healing, and
[15:44] a Christian lifestyle. But we've taken
[15:47] that message and divided ourselves into
[15:50] different camps.
[15:52] exactly what the prophet came to fight
[15:55] against.
[15:58] We shouldn't leave the forerunner out,
[16:00] but we also shouldn't make a
[16:02] denomination with a book of rules and
[16:04] creeds around his message.
[16:08] I also believe the Tucson Tabernacle is
[16:11] a place that can bridge the gap between
[16:14] the churches and their doctrinal
[16:16] differences.
[16:19] I want to be where God is moving. Again,
[16:22] I wrote this more than two years ago. I
[16:25] want to be where God is moving. In the
[16:28] 1950s and60s, the Evans family followed
[16:31] Brother Brandham around the country
[16:34] because that was where God was moving.
[16:38] I feel the same today.
[16:41] I want to be where God is.
[16:46] If it's not at the Tucson Tabernacle, I
[16:48] still want to be where he is.
[16:50] And I feel the same today. And I ended
[16:54] it with this quote. Brother Brandham
[16:57] said on images of Christ, "The church
[16:59] can never progress until it knows what
[17:04] grounds it's progressing on." Very
[17:07] simple statement, but a very profound
[17:09] statement. And I think the same today.
[17:15] I don't want to necessarily
[17:18] I don't care about success. I don't care
[17:21] about some great
[17:24] church that's been built or or any of
[17:26] that. Friends, I just want to be I want
[17:28] to please God.
[17:30] When I get down on my knees, I want to
[17:32] come before him and say, "Lord, I've
[17:34] I've failed, but I've done what I could,
[17:36] and I put you first. I didn't put
[17:38] anything else first. I didn't put my
[17:40] family first. I didn't put my church
[17:41] first. Lord, I put you first and that's
[17:45] the deepest desire of my heart and it
[17:48] still is.
[17:50] And I believe that's why the Lord has
[17:52] blessed us. But we can never lose that.
[17:56] It's always got to be Christ first and
[18:01] then
[18:03] we can go to bed at night and not worry.
[18:06] Amen.
[18:06] We can move through this life and know
[18:10] that Lord, I know you're guiding my
[18:12] path. No matter what problems come, no
[18:14] matter how much we get hurt or or
[18:16] whatever catastrophes happen, Lord, I
[18:18] know you're in it because I am in you.
[18:24] And in thinking on those things and in
[18:30] trying to put things in perspective,
[18:34] brother Silas, as I preached when your
[18:36] dad was there, and I think you were
[18:38] probably there in Jeffersonville on that
[18:41] images, that thought of this prophet
[18:45] Daniel came to my mind.
[18:48] And what Daniel stood for,
[18:52] Daniel was a young man. This evil king
[18:56] Nebuchadnezzar came into Jerusalem,
[18:59] sacked the city, took the best, most
[19:03] promising people, took them, brought
[19:05] them out
[19:08] of Jerusalem, took them into captivity,
[19:10] brought them to Babylon, took all the
[19:12] gold and all the riches out of the city.
[19:15] And then Nebuchadnezzar used these
[19:17] people to further build his kingdom.
[19:22] This Daniel
[19:25] was one of those young men, very
[19:29] promising young men, Jewish young men
[19:30] that came out of Jerusalem. So
[19:34] Nebuchadnezzar,
[19:37] he has a series of troubling dreams.
[19:42] One thing that's very important,
[19:46] brothers and sisters. We went through
[19:48] the entire book of Acts last year. What
[19:51] a blessing it was. What a way to build a
[19:54] foundation for this church and we
[19:57] learned so much. Now, we started in
[19:59] Genesis and we're going to go through
[20:01] the Bible one sermon about per book to
[20:05] where we can learn these books. We need
[20:08] it's so I can't tell you how important
[20:10] it is when the minister up here and he
[20:12] is re referring
[20:15] to the Bible and he's talking about
[20:16] these different books. You need to be
[20:19] able to go back and say, "Okay, I know
[20:21] what he's talking about.
[20:23] You may not think that it's that
[20:26] important,
[20:28] but that Bible, just understanding the
[20:31] meaning behind each book, even if you
[20:33] don't know all the details, it will help
[20:36] guide you through this life.
[20:39] So, don't miss these lessons that
[20:41] Brother Lyle and I are teaching on these
[20:43] Wednesday nights. They're vitally
[20:45] important. They'll help understand and
[20:49] help
[20:51] digest
[20:53] the word of God even later on if you
[20:56] have a good foundation.
[20:59] So this book of Daniel, it starts with
[21:02] this Nebuchadnezzar. As I said, he
[21:04] brought these people out of Babylon.
[21:06] Then he has these series of troubling
[21:09] dreams and he calls his wise men,
[21:13] his calaldanss, this ancient race
[21:17] of scholarly, learned, mysterious
[21:22] people. I mentioned them last week at
[21:24] Christmas.
[21:26] This these this group of people were
[21:30] what eventually became the wise men that
[21:33] saw the star from the east and they came
[21:37] to find Jesus.
[21:40] This these are the ancestors that I'm
[21:43] talking about right now of these wise
[21:46] men.
[21:48] So Nebuchadnezzar comes to these wise
[21:50] men and he says, "Listen," he says,
[21:52] "I've had these troubling dreams. I need
[21:54] you to interpret these dreams for me.
[21:58] The wise men said, "Okay, we can do it.
[22:01] Just tell us the dream." Nebuchadnezzar
[22:04] says, "Here's the deal.
[22:06] I'm not going to tell you the dream.
[22:08] You're going to have to tell me the
[22:09] dream, and that way I know that you are
[22:13] anointed and that you have the right
[22:15] interpretation."
[22:17] They said, "Only the gods can do that."
[22:19] They said, "There's no one that can tell
[22:21] you a dream
[22:24] without them seeing that dream."
[22:27] Nebuchadnezzar basically said, "Well,
[22:29] then you're going to die.
[22:31] This is going to be the end of the wise
[22:32] men, the end of the Calaldanss."
[22:35] So, it starts going around. Rumor starts
[22:37] going around with this man. Daniel was
[22:39] among these wise men. So, the the the
[22:43] message gets back to Daniel. Daniel
[22:45] says, "Hey, wait." And he talks he talks
[22:48] to the the ruler that came to him and
[22:49] said, "Hey, you're all going to die, so
[22:51] just get ready." Dan Daniel calls a
[22:53] timeout. He said, "Just a minute. Give
[22:55] me some time and let me pray about
[22:58] this." So he goes back to his friends,
[23:05] these friends,
[23:07] Shadrach, Meak, and Abedneo. We know
[23:11] that from the the stories of Daniel that
[23:13] we teach the kids. Daniel 2 verse 16 and
[23:18] he says this. Then Daniel went in and
[23:21] desired of the king that he would give
[23:23] him time and that he would show the king
[23:25] the interpretation. Then Daniel went to
[23:28] his house and made the thing known to
[23:32] Haniah, Mishael, and Aariah his
[23:35] companions. That is the Hebrew name for
[23:38] Shadrach, Meshach, and Abedneo.
[23:43] made the thing known to them that they
[23:45] would desire mercies of the God of
[23:47] heaven concerning this secret that
[23:49] Daniel and his fellows should not perish
[23:52] with the rest of the wise men of
[23:54] Babylon.
[23:56] Stop right there. Look at what Daniel
[23:59] the prophet did. It's something that all
[24:01] of us do and that we should take more
[24:04] seriously. When there was a crisis in
[24:06] Daniel's life, Daniel went to his
[24:08] friends and you know what he said? He
[24:10] said, "Pray for me."
[24:12] right there in the book. So friends,
[24:15] when somebody comes to us, we read the
[24:18] prayer requests earlier, but when
[24:20] somebody comes to us and say, "Pray for
[24:21] me, pray for them."
[24:25] It's in the Bible.
[24:27] If you love them, get on your knees and
[24:30] go before the Lord for them. So they go,
[24:34] they pray for him. And then Daniel goes
[24:37] before the king. Skip to verse 27. And
[24:39] he says this, "The king answered and
[24:43] said to Daniel,
[24:45] whose name was Beltazar, Belticheser,
[24:48] that's the Babylonian name for the
[24:50] Hebrew name Daniel, "Art thou able to
[24:53] make known unto me the dream which I
[24:55] have seen, and the interpretation
[24:57] thereof?" Daniel answered in the
[24:59] presence of the king and said, "The
[25:01] secret which the king hath demanded
[25:04] cannot the wise men, the astrologers,
[25:07] the magicians, the the soothsayers show
[25:11] unto the king." Daniel's saying, "No,
[25:15] nobody can make that known."
[25:17] See the wisdom and the humility of the
[25:20] prophet here. He's saying, "I can't do
[25:22] it. I'm a man and neither can all your
[25:24] wise men. They are men also. But there
[25:26] is a God in heaven that revealth the
[25:29] secrets and maketh known to the king
[25:32] Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the
[25:34] latter days. Notice how the prophet
[25:37] gives gives um credit to God. Thy dream
[25:42] and the visions of thy head upon thy bed
[25:45] are these. So then Daniel goes on and
[25:50] tells the king his dream and then
[25:53] interprets the dream to the king.
[25:57] Now it's important important to know
[25:59] here before we get too far. It's
[26:00] important to know how the Bible is
[26:02] written. We see chapters in our Bible.
[26:06] The original Bible wasn't the original
[26:08] scrolls weren't written in chapters.
[26:10] They were just one big long scroll. We
[26:12] have put in chapters in there to make it
[26:15] to where we can find different verses
[26:16] and we can find different things that
[26:18] the that the different prophets said.
[26:20] But the originals don't have chapters
[26:23] and verses. It's very important in this
[26:25] instance.
[26:28] Verse number 46.
[26:30] Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his
[26:34] face and worshiped Daniel and commanded
[26:37] that they should offer an oblation and
[26:39] sweet odors unto him. And the king
[26:41] answered unto Daniel, and said, "Of a
[26:43] truth it is, that your God is a God of
[26:46] gods, and the Lord, and a Lord of kings,
[26:49] and a revealer of the of secrets, seeing
[26:52] thou couldest reveal this secret." And
[26:54] the king made Daniel a great man, and
[26:58] gave him many gifts, great gs, and made
[27:01] him ruler over the whole province of
[27:03] Babylon, and chief of the governors, and
[27:06] over all of the wise men of Babylon.
[27:10] back to Christmas message. That's where
[27:12] I got that and that's just well known
[27:15] that Daniel became the chief of these
[27:19] magi.
[27:20] Then Daniel requested of the king and he
[27:24] set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego over
[27:26] the affairs of the province of of the
[27:29] province of Babylon. But Daniel sat in
[27:31] the gate of the king.
[27:34] Nebuchadnezzar
[27:35] the king
[27:38] made an image of gold
[27:41] whose height was three score cubits and
[27:44] breadth thereof six cubits. He set it up
[27:46] in the plain of Dura in the province of
[27:49] Babylon. This is a 90 foot tall statue.
[27:54] It's huge. Could be seen from miles.
[27:56] Let's skip to verse four. Then a herald
[27:59] cried out aloud to you. It is commanded,
[28:02] O people, nations, and languages, that
[28:05] at what time ye hear the sound of the
[28:08] cornet, flute, harp, the sacket, sultry,
[28:11] doulamer, and all kinds of music, you
[28:13] fall down and worship the golden image
[28:16] that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set
[28:17] up. And who so fallth not down and
[28:20] worship shall the same hour be cast into
[28:23] the midst of the burning fiery furnace.
[28:28] So, what just happened here?
[28:31] Do you see how I read right through the
[28:33] chapter?
[28:35] Nebuchadnezzar
[28:37] tells the people that if you don't bow
[28:39] down to this image when you are told to,
[28:42] then you will be cast into this fiery
[28:44] furnace. Now, let me read a quote to you
[28:47] here. I want to make sure we're all on
[28:48] the same page, right? It's pretty
[28:51] obvious what happened there. It's pretty
[28:54] obvious that this king was enamored with
[28:58] this prophet and he built this statue
[29:00] right after this happened. But let's
[29:02] just to clench it down. Let's just read
[29:04] this quote from brother Brandham. It
[29:07] says this possessing the gate of the
[29:09] enemy after the trial. It says, "Let's
[29:11] take the Hebrew children because they
[29:13] stood true and wouldn't tolerate with
[29:16] image worship. They refused to bow down
[29:19] to an image that the king of the nation
[29:21] had made. It was made after a holy man
[29:25] too. The image of Daniel
[29:29] showed that the gentile race was brought
[29:31] in under the false side of worshiping an
[29:34] image of a holy man. It goes out the
[29:37] same way when the people will be forced
[29:39] to worship images of people.
[29:44] It come in by revelation of Daniel being
[29:47] able to interpret the word that was
[29:49] wrote on the handwriting of the wall on
[29:51] the wall. That's the way it come in and
[29:55] that's the way it goes out the same way
[29:58] the image of the gentile.
[30:02] So we see
[30:06] that this man Daniel
[30:10] showed
[30:12] this evidence of a prophet, this
[30:14] evidence of God that was in Daniel. And
[30:17] he goes and and interprets this dream
[30:21] and the king became so enamored with
[30:24] Daniel.
[30:26] Daniel left his presence and it started
[30:30] to grow in this king.
[30:33] So the king instead of just staying with
[30:37] the prophet and staying with what he
[30:38] said, he took it farther than what God
[30:41] wanted it to go
[30:43] and he made an image in his mind of what
[30:48] this man of God should be and not what
[30:52] he was. He made this 90 foot tall golden
[30:57] statue because that is what was in the
[31:00] mind of the king that this man is so
[31:04] great. He's a god.
[31:07] So, I'm going to create this image and
[31:10] then once this image is created, I'm
[31:13] going to have everybody else bow down to
[31:16] this image
[31:18] and worship this man of God.
[31:22] But it wasn't a man of God. It was a
[31:24] statue and it was made up in
[31:27] Nebuchadnezzar's mind.
[31:30] And my point in saying that is that is
[31:33] so common for us. God will do something.
[31:37] He'll he'll start a revival on a broad
[31:40] scale or he'll do something in our
[31:42] lives. God will bless it like he did in
[31:45] Nebuchadnezzar.
[31:47] And then we will take the blessing of
[31:50] God and then we will make it into an
[31:53] idol or we'll make it into a
[31:55] denomination or we'll make it into a
[31:56] cult and then we will force others to
[32:01] worship in the same way that we are
[32:03] worshiping. Put the pressure on them.
[32:06] And that's what happens every time. It's
[32:10] happened in denominations from Martin
[32:12] Luther to Wesley to to Cath Catholicism.
[32:16] And they take Peter and Mary and all of
[32:18] them and they create this strange
[32:20] religion where they lift up someone and
[32:23] then if someone doesn't worship that
[32:26] idol, they have the same spirit of
[32:28] Nebuchadnezzar that they will be cast
[32:30] out. Except it's worse today than
[32:33] Nebuchadnezzar casting them into the
[32:35] fiery furnace.
[32:37] Today we cast them out of heaven
[32:41] and it's not their lives that we're
[32:43] thinking about. We cast them out of the
[32:45] church. We cast them out of our
[32:48] organization. We cast them out of the
[32:51] bride
[32:53] because they don't believe it like we
[32:55] believe it. And it's the same spirit
[32:58] that Nebuchadnezzar had.
[33:01] If you don't believe it like me, you're
[33:03] out.
[33:05] And so sincere.
[33:08] Fast forward about 600 years.
[33:12] We see these men
[33:15] called the Pharisees and Sadducees.
[33:20] They all believed
[33:22] in Moses and they believed in the Torah.
[33:24] We have the Sadducees over here. We know
[33:25] from the book of Acts that they were the
[33:27] temple temple guard, the temple um
[33:29] priests
[33:31] and they worked there and they were the
[33:34] high society. They had the support of
[33:36] the government and they just listened to
[33:40] one prophet named Moses.
[33:44] The other prophets weren't good enough
[33:46] for them.
[33:48] And then we have over here the Pharisees
[33:51] believed in the same prophet Moses. They
[33:54] believed in all the other prophets. They
[33:57] believed in miracles. And they they were
[33:59] out preaching to all of the the
[34:01] different churches around in the
[34:03] synagogues.
[34:05] hating the Pharisees,
[34:08] hating the Sadducees. Sadducees hated
[34:10] the Pharisees and all believing the same
[34:12] message.
[34:14] I'm not done.
[34:17] Then we have another group over here.
[34:19] They're called the Herodians.
[34:22] They believe that this man Herod that
[34:24] was ruler, they wanted to be part of the
[34:26] government. They thought he was going to
[34:27] come up like Donald Trump
[34:30] and he was going to be the savior and he
[34:33] was going to fulfill
[34:36] the office of the Messiah and he was
[34:38] going to deliver Israel.
[34:40] And then there was another group
[34:43] over here. They were called the Essenes
[34:45] and they were just the the ones that
[34:46] just w kind of a cult. They went out
[34:49] into the desert and they just formed
[34:51] this little group around themselves,
[34:55] separating from everybody else. And
[34:56] that's where we get the Dead Sea Scrolls
[34:59] because they took all of these these
[35:01] writings and they went up and hid them
[35:03] in a cave. And thank God that they did.
[35:07] We don't know who they were. They their
[35:09] bones are ashes today, but God's word
[35:11] survived. So, there was all of these
[35:14] different groups.
[35:16] Think about it.
[35:18] There's all of these different groups
[35:20] believing the same prophet Moses and
[35:23] hating each other,
[35:27] having an image in their mind of what
[35:30] God is
[35:32] and how we should worship, taking quotes
[35:36] and lining them together
[35:39] and saying different things,
[35:43] same spirit.
[35:46] So now here we are and then this man
[35:50] comes,
[35:52] humble man, may not have been all that
[35:55] well spoken. Who knows? We know that
[35:58] when they looked at him, he wasn't
[36:01] someone that had a lot of um he wasn't
[36:04] an real attractive man, someone that
[36:07] wouldn't garner your attention.
[36:10] The Bible says that that he wasn't like
[36:13] that.
[36:14] didn't come in the way that they
[36:16] thought.
[36:17] And not only did he not come in the way
[36:19] they thought, he didn't come to them.
[36:23] He came to prostitutes,
[36:26] drunks,
[36:28] the lowest form of life.
[36:32] They didn't It's like, who is this guy?
[36:35] And he's causing all this stir. They
[36:37] didn't they didn't like him. He didn't
[36:39] come in the image that they had of this
[36:41] Messiah when he was supposed to come.
[36:43] They did. He didn't come like that.
[36:46] He came in a different way.
[36:49] And how history repeats itself. Let's go
[36:53] to Matthew chapter 5. Says this.
[36:59] This is something that Jesus would say
[37:01] this this man that they cut out.
[37:05] Verse 43 says this. Jesus says, "You
[37:07] have heard that it has been said, thou
[37:09] shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine
[37:11] enemies." He's quoting the prophets.
[37:12] He's quoting Moses.
[37:15] Now, Jesus is about to tear down one of
[37:17] their images that they built up. Matthew
[37:20] 5:44 says this, "But I say unto you,
[37:22] love your enemies, bless them with that
[37:25] curse you, do good to them that hate
[37:28] you, and pray for them which
[37:32] despitefully use you and persecute you."
[37:36] Whoa.
[37:38] How many of us do that? Those are the
[37:40] words of Jesus Christ. Those are his
[37:42] commandments.
[37:44] As I said last week, how many of us can
[37:47] call ourselves Christians when we have a
[37:49] grudge against someone else? We go
[37:52] before the Lord and say, "Lord, forgive
[37:54] me of my trespasses." And we leave out
[37:56] the second part of the Lord's prayer
[37:57] that says, "As I forgive those that
[37:59] trespass against us."
[38:05] But I say unto you, love your enemies,
[38:06] bless them that curse you, do good to
[38:08] them that hate you, and pray for them
[38:09] which despitefully use you. and
[38:11] persecute you. Wait a minute, Rabbi.
[38:13] This is not what Moses said.
[38:17] He said, "An eye for an eye."
[38:21] And what does it lead to when we put our
[38:25] own ideas over God? is we propagate a
[38:29] narrative that has been taught in our
[38:31] churches and our denominations and we
[38:35] lose sight of God himself and we start
[38:40] focusing on just our revelations or just
[38:44] our doctrines or whatever it is and
[38:48] there's Christ standing right before him
[38:52] preaching something that you know what
[38:53] it just didn't feel right. You know,
[38:56] sometimes,
[38:58] many times, when things don't feel
[39:01] right, it's because that's not the way
[39:03] you were raised.
[39:06] Sometimes it's God speaking to you. But
[39:08] other times, it's just because it's not
[39:12] what you're used to.
[39:16] And right here is a perfect example that
[39:18] I just read.
[39:20] Matthew chapter 21.
[39:23] This is the ultimate
[39:28] example
[39:30] of how people can completely leave the
[39:34] word of God and go into a denomination
[39:37] or into a cult. Matthew 21:20 23. We'll
[39:41] start with verse 23. And when he was
[39:43] come to the temple, speaking of Jesus,
[39:45] the chief priests and the elders of the
[39:47] people came unto him as he was teaching
[39:50] and said, "By what authority doest thou
[39:52] these things? And who gave thee this
[39:54] authority?"
[39:56] And Jesus answered and said unto them, I
[39:59] will ask you one thing, and if you tell
[40:02] me, I and likewise will tell you by what
[40:06] authority I do these things.
[40:09] The baptism of John, speaking of John
[40:11] the Baptist, the baptism of John, whence
[40:14] was it? From heaven or from men.
[40:19] They swallowed their sermon right there
[40:20] probably.
[40:23] And they reasoned with themselves,
[40:26] saying, "If we shall say from heaven, he
[40:29] will say unto us unto us, then why did
[40:32] you then not believe him? But if we
[40:34] shall say of men, we fear the people.
[40:36] For all hold John as a prophet. They
[40:38] were so caught up in their image of
[40:40] their religion that all they could think
[40:42] about was giving an answer that agreed
[40:45] with their religion.
[40:47] And there was the truth standing right
[40:49] in front of them.
[40:52] And all they could think about was their
[40:55] own religion.
[40:57] Their religion separated them from God.
[41:01] and Jesus. And they answered Jesus and
[41:03] they said, "We cannot tell." And he said
[41:06] unto them, "Neither tell I you what
[41:09] authority I do these things." They
[41:10] didn't care about the truth.
[41:12] What they did is they cared about
[41:14] propagating the narrative. They had an
[41:16] image of religion and their religion
[41:19] actually, as I said, kept them from
[41:23] Christ.
[41:25] Have you talked
[41:27] with a Jehovah Witness?
[41:33] They're nice people,
[41:36] precious people, until you start talking
[41:38] about the word.
[41:40] Then the spirit starts to shift. And the
[41:44] first thing that they do is say, "Your
[41:46] Bible's not accurate."
[41:49] Because what they're doing is they're
[41:51] trying to just prove themselves right.
[41:54] And you can show them right here in the
[41:56] word and they don't care because it's
[41:58] about their narrative.
[42:01] It's about what they believe. It's about
[42:02] what they were raised with. It's about
[42:04] the image that they have of religion.
[42:06] It's sad. The Mormons are the same way.
[42:10] The Mormons will talk they'll talk fine
[42:13] and then the first thing that they do is
[42:14] they say, "Well, as long as it's
[42:15] translated right." Of course it's
[42:17] translated right. You think God's not a
[42:20] good enough God to take care of his
[42:21] word?
[42:23] They want to throw in a little bit of
[42:25] error. They want to throw a little bit
[42:27] of doubt in your mind
[42:29] and slip in something that's not real.
[42:32] We had some some good kids here the
[42:35] other day. They sat in the front, two
[42:38] elders. They weren't I don't know why
[42:40] they call them elders because they were
[42:41] kids.
[42:46] I don't know. Um anyways, they were
[42:48] there. They said elder. Somebody said,
[42:51] "Was it you, brother? Was it brother
[42:53] Arie?" Somebody said, "I thought his
[42:55] first name was Elder."
[43:00] Like, "No, man.
[43:02] I'm not trying to make fun of the kids,
[43:04] but one thing I want to say is they were
[43:06] there and I quoted Acts 2:38.
[43:12] I said, "How many people believe?" Acts
[43:15] 2:38, "Repent every one of you, and be
[43:18] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[43:20] the remission of your sins, and ye shall
[43:23] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost."
[43:25] Read it right there out of the Bible. I
[43:26] said, "How many people believe that?
[43:28] Raise your hand." They didn't raise
[43:29] their hand
[43:31] because it didn't line up with their
[43:35] doctrine. They were afraid. As I said,
[43:38] probably good kids and
[43:41] probably they're a lot better than I was
[43:44] when I was their age. So, I'm proud of
[43:46] them and trying trying to do something
[43:48] right, but they're misled and all of
[43:52] their efforts will come to not because
[43:55] they're about an image that's created
[43:58] rather than about God himself.
[44:01] And when you do that,
[44:05] then God just pulls his hands from it
[44:09] and it dies right there.
[44:12] When you get this image in your mind and
[44:14] everything has to line up and you're
[44:15] judging everything by your image rather
[44:18] than going into the word and looking
[44:20] into the word, God lets it die.
[44:25] It's like the Dead Sea or the Salt Sea.
[44:29] All of this good water from the Jordan
[44:32] River is coming into it, bringing all of
[44:35] this life and all of these nutrients,
[44:37] but then it goes into this big body of
[44:40] water and it dies right there because
[44:42] nothing comes out.
[44:45] You can come to church. You can read
[44:47] your Bible.
[44:49] You can
[44:51] do pray and do all these things and
[44:53] everything's coming in. But there better
[44:56] be something coming out of you
[44:58] or you die.
[45:01] It becomes stagnant. All of those good
[45:04] minerals that give life that are coming
[45:05] into the Dead Sea, they get so
[45:08] concentrated that they become poison and
[45:10] nothing can live.
[45:12] And that's how our churches are today.
[45:15] We get all this good stuff. We listen to
[45:18] tapes, love them. We read our Bibles,
[45:20] love them. It's just coming in, coming
[45:22] in, coming in. But it dies because
[45:23] nothing comes out.
[45:25] There has to be a constant flow
[45:28] of the gospel coming in and then a flow
[45:31] of it going out.
[45:34] That's why this church, I've said many
[45:37] times, I want to see sinners on these
[45:41] pews.
[45:44] because that's what a church is for.
[45:47] I said something in the Christmas
[45:49] message. I thought, you know, that's
[45:52] going to be
[45:54] my theme for 2024.
[45:58] I said, "Come as you are. Come as you
[46:00] are." I don't care if you're a
[46:01] prostitute. I don't care if you're a
[46:02] drug addict. I don't care if you how you
[46:05] dress. I don't care how you look. I
[46:07] don't care how you believe. Come as you
[46:09] are. But don't stay as you are.
[46:13] When you come in and the Holy Spirit
[46:16] comes in now, you got to start giving
[46:18] out.
[46:19] You got to start serving. You got to
[46:21] start witnessing. I was thinking about
[46:24] all the people that have come in. Sister
[46:26] Amelia, I was thinking about you. I was
[46:28] thinking about all the people that have
[46:29] come in over this past year. And I look
[46:31] out and I can't think of one of them
[46:33] that I brought.
[46:35] But there's all these new people.
[46:38] I didn't do it.
[46:40] The people in the pews did it.
[46:43] It's coming. The the gospel is coming in
[46:46] and it's going out.
[46:48] That's a progression. That's life.
[46:51] You don't come in and let it become
[46:53] stagnant.
[46:55] And that's why the churches are so
[46:57] stagnant. They have built an image of
[47:00] this message
[47:02] and this is how it should be and they
[47:04] die right there. Just as Nebuchadnezzar
[47:07] done, he had made a mistake.
[47:11] That's what he thought.
[47:13] That's the best way that he could do to
[47:15] honor this man.
[47:18] And he took these young men. They said,
[47:21] "We're not doing it.
[47:23] We are not going to bow down to the
[47:25] image of that man." That man was the
[47:28] most important man in the world at the
[47:31] time. He was the prophet of God. And not
[47:34] only was he that, he was their best
[47:36] friend.
[47:38] They loved him. They saw the gift in his
[47:41] life. They saw that he saved all of the
[47:43] wise men. And yet they said, "We're not
[47:46] doing it." That wasn't a disrespect to
[47:49] Daniel
[47:50] by them doing that. And in no way was
[47:53] disrespectful to the prophet.
[47:56] But what had happened is they put the
[47:59] prophet in the place of God.
[48:03] Nebuchadnezzar put his image
[48:06] of what he thought the prophet should be
[48:08] in the place of God. And that's what so
[48:10] many of us do. We take a man of God,
[48:14] whether it be a pastor, priest, prophet,
[48:17] whatever it is, and we get in our mind
[48:19] of how this person should act
[48:23] because that's the way God acts in our
[48:25] mind.
[48:27] So we make up this fake person.
[48:30] It could be a pastor. It could be
[48:32] brother Brandham. It could be whoever it
[48:33] is. And you know what? That's not him.
[48:36] That's what you've conjured up in your
[48:38] mind.
[48:39] I was talking with somebody the other
[48:41] day. I wasn't going to bring this up,
[48:43] but I think it's a good time. I was
[48:44] talking to somebody the other day
[48:47] against Brother Bram's message, friend
[48:49] of mine, against Brother Bram's message,
[48:51] and he said this. He said, "Yeah, but he
[48:53] said
[48:56] he called a woman." He said he called
[48:59] him Miss Dog Meat.
[49:01] He says, "That's not how the how could
[49:04] how could that be God?" And I thought,
[49:09] "Well, I don't know." And then, so I
[49:11] went and I looked it up and he said,
[49:12] "Brother Brandham said that many times.
[49:14] Called them dogs."
[49:16] I know, Brother Brandham. I know that
[49:18] that that's not who he was talking
[49:19] about. He was talking about Jezebel and
[49:21] how Jezebel, how she acted and what she
[49:24] did was an influence on the world today.
[49:29] But Jesus would never say that image.
[49:34] Jesus would never say something like
[49:36] that,
[49:38] would he?
[49:42] Not my Jesus. Not the one that I have
[49:45] built an altar to. Not the one that I
[49:47] have built a statue of.
[49:51] Sarapheneician woman
[49:53] came to Jesus. Here he is at the table
[49:57] as respectful as she could be. She comes
[50:00] down. She says, "Thou son of David."
[50:02] She wasn't even coming for herself. Her
[50:04] daughter had a mental illness.
[50:08] She comes there. She bows down before
[50:11] Jesus.
[50:13] Jesus looks down at her.
[50:16] She says, 'Lord, will you have mercy on
[50:18] my daughter? He looks down at her and he
[50:21] says, "It's not right for the dogs to
[50:25] eat at the table with my children."
[50:30] And we have a we have this image of how
[50:32] Jesus should be. Jesus himself called
[50:36] this woman a dog. How does that match
[50:39] our image? Don't start doing it.
[50:44] That wasn't the point. We have no right.
[50:46] We have no right. Jesus had a purpose in
[50:49] doing it.
[50:51] He looked down,
[50:54] called her a dog. She said, "Lord, look
[50:56] at how she humbled herself."
[50:59] She said, "Lord,
[51:01] but even the dogs can eat the scraps
[51:04] from the master's table."
[51:06] What humility
[51:08] in that dear sister he looked down and
[51:12] he gave her that very moment her
[51:15] daughter was delivered of this mental
[51:17] illness of this devil that it caused
[51:19] right there. But how many of us
[51:24] it wouldn't match like this man wouldn't
[51:26] match our image of Jesus Christ because
[51:29] we form it in our mind
[51:33] and we have to be very careful of doing
[51:36] that.
[51:39] I think of this
[51:42] these images that are always presented
[51:44] to us. Not only are they religious
[51:46] images, but they are worldly images that
[51:48] are constantly bombarding us. Also,
[51:52] these influencers that we see and for
[51:55] the kids,
[51:57] listen to me,
[51:59] that if you portray yourself
[52:04] as coming from the world,
[52:07] then that's the kind of person that you
[52:09] are going to attract.
[52:12] men. These young these these boys
[52:15] looking like girls in their in their
[52:17] skinny jeans and saggy pants and and
[52:20] going to the clubs
[52:23] partying and drinking and doing all this
[52:26] h and hanging out with this wrong crowd.
[52:29] I'm not you know me. I'm not
[52:33] I am preaching against it.
[52:36] I am
[52:39] hanging out with the wrong kind of
[52:41] people. What kind of a girl are you
[52:44] going to attract?
[52:47] She's not going to be a mom to your
[52:48] children. She wants the kind of guy
[52:51] that's going to be going to the club.
[52:53] She wants the kind of guy that's going
[52:54] to live that life.
[52:59] That's not the kind of girl that's going
[53:01] to be a good mother to your children.
[53:04] It's not going to want to go to church
[53:05] with you. First thing she'll say is,
[53:07] "Oh, they judge me there."
[53:09] We should never judge. And this church
[53:11] doesn't. Thank God.
[53:13] But when you say that,
[53:15] what you're really saying is, "I'm not
[53:19] going to change.
[53:21] I'm not going to live more holy. This is
[53:24] me, and I like me."
[53:27] As I've said before, I hate me.
[53:30] And if you don't see a constant change
[53:32] in the pastor of this church, then I am
[53:34] not progressing.
[53:36] I want to get closer and closer to the
[53:38] Lord. And it's the same thing with the
[53:41] sisters,
[53:43] with the girls. If you are dressing up
[53:46] and looking like these influencers and
[53:49] they all want us all to look the same
[53:52] with all the eye makeup and all the
[53:53] paint and all of that and you're trying
[53:55] to look like them and hanging around the
[53:58] wrong crowd, who do you think you're
[53:59] going to attract? Do you think it's
[54:02] going to be a Christian young man
[54:07] that's going to be a good dad to your
[54:10] children? that's gonna work hard and
[54:14] take care of a family. Do you think
[54:16] that's the kind of man you're gonna
[54:17] attract? No.
[54:20] No.
[54:22] He's going to he's going to get what he
[54:24] wants and then he's going to go to the
[54:25] next one that looks exactly like you do
[54:28] because they all look the same.
[54:31] God wants individuals.
[54:33] He doesn't want us to all look alike. We
[54:37] are different.
[54:40] every one of us.
[54:44] He loves variety. God is a God of
[54:49] variety. We see the influences
[54:50] everywhere in the world. They're on
[54:52] social media. They're on YouTube.
[54:54] They're at school. They're at work.
[54:56] They're also in church
[54:59] here.
[55:01] I'm not just talking
[55:03] about what we would call worldly.
[55:08] I'm talking about building an image of
[55:10] how you think someone should look.
[55:13] God wants a variety because he has
[55:17] different jobs for each of us to do.
[55:19] It's like a puzzle.
[55:22] Every puzzle piece, I don't care if
[55:24] there's a million of those little
[55:25] things. They're all different. Every one
[55:28] of them. But not one of them is any more
[55:31] important than the other one. You put
[55:34] them all out on the table, you start
[55:35] putting them down. Each one of them has
[55:38] its place. It's one of the most
[55:40] beautiful things, a puzzle.
[55:43] You get there and you man,
[55:46] you know, it won't fit. Well, that's not
[55:47] the spot where it goes. When you find
[55:49] that spot, it just snaps right in. You
[55:52] can't put a piece of a puzzle piece
[55:55] somewhere where it doesn't go.
[55:57] And that's God's order. That's God's
[56:00] bride. That's God's people. He has a
[56:03] place for everyone. And we are all
[56:06] different.
[56:09] But Nebuchadnezzar wanted everybody to
[56:11] conform,
[56:12] to look the same. The world and the
[56:15] influencers, they want everybody to look
[56:17] the same. They want the guys to look
[56:18] like this. They want the girls to look
[56:20] like that. And they do look the same.
[56:22] But that's not God.
[56:25] Let's turn
[56:27] in closing.
[56:31] Let's turn to
[56:33] 1 Corinthians chapter 12.
[56:37] God designed us to be different. And
[56:39] it's the hardest thing in the world to
[56:40] see someone vastly different than you
[56:44] and yet recognize the Holy Spirit
[56:45] operating them just as strongly as it
[56:48] operates in you.
[56:50] Seems like that's the hardest thing for
[56:51] a church to do because that person
[56:54] doesn't see it the way you see it or
[56:56] that I see it. But don't think that God
[57:00] can't use that person.
[57:07] I'll um before we get into
[57:11] closing scripture,
[57:16] mistake that we so often make is that we
[57:20] focus on the creeds of the church or the
[57:22] successes of the church or the
[57:24] revelations that God gives us along the
[57:26] road and we lose focus on Christ and
[57:29] like I said and that's where we die like
[57:31] the Dead Sea.
[57:34] nothing goes out anymore and it's all
[57:36] taking in and we lock ourselves off. We
[57:41] we close ourselves up
[57:44] and then we make it an exclusive gospel.
[57:47] The gospel is not exclusive. The gospel
[57:51] is for anyone who will hear it.
[57:57] Let's go to
[58:00] first Corinthians.
[58:03] First before we get there, I want to say
[58:06] just we believe that every Christian
[58:12] has a has a work to do. I'm going to
[58:14] read a scripture that proves that. But I
[58:16] want to tell you what I believe
[58:17] personally. I believe that every
[58:21] Christian is called to preach the gospel
[58:25] in some way. Man, woman or child.
[58:30] Everyone who receives this gospel is
[58:32] called to preach the gospel. Not
[58:34] necessarily up here handling the word,
[58:38] but in the ministry of some sort.
[58:46] In 2024,
[58:48] this coming year,
[58:51] I want to accelerate this work that's
[58:53] going on. I want all of you, and me too,
[58:59] step to the plate. Don't just take in,
[59:03] give out. Give, give, give.
[59:09] I'm not talking
[59:11] I'm not talking about what prosperity
[59:14] gospel guys talk about.
[59:16] I'm talking about when the Lord blesses
[59:20] you, take that blessing and pass it out
[59:23] because you want to be able to receive
[59:24] some more.
[59:27] Give your time. We have a lot of work
[59:30] that needs to be done in church.
[59:33] Give your life. There's people that you
[59:36] all know, all of us know that need a
[59:38] touch. They need a visit. They need a
[59:41] phone call. They need a little love.
[59:45] Take your precious time and give it.
[59:48] Reach out to them. Show them Jesus
[59:52] Christ lives in me. I love you. What can
[59:56] I do for you? That's the c Christian way
[59:59] is to serve. And we will find that every
[1:00:03] person in this room has a role to play,
[1:00:06] has a piece to be placed in that
[1:00:09] masterpiece of God.
[1:00:12] 1 Corinthians chapter 12 says this. Now
[1:00:15] concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I
[1:00:18] would not have you ignorant. You know
[1:00:20] that you were Gentiles carried away
[1:00:22] under these dumb idols, even as you were
[1:00:25] led. Wherefore I give you to understand
[1:00:27] that no man speaking by the spirit of
[1:00:29] God callth Jesus a cursed and that no
[1:00:31] man can say Jesus is the Lord but by the
[1:00:33] Holy Ghost. Now there are diversities of
[1:00:36] gifts
[1:00:38] but the same spirit.
[1:00:41] Now there are differences of
[1:00:43] administrations
[1:00:44] but the same Lord. In other words, there
[1:00:46] are different kinds of services of the
[1:00:49] Lord.
[1:00:51] And there are diversities of operations
[1:00:53] but the same God which workketh all in
[1:00:55] all. In other words, there are different
[1:00:56] varieties of activities but the same God
[1:00:59] who empowers them all.
[1:01:03] But the manifestation of the spirit is
[1:01:05] given to every man to profit with all.
[1:01:07] For one is given by the spirit of the
[1:01:09] word of wisdom, to another the word of
[1:01:11] knowledge by the same spirit, to another
[1:01:14] faith by the same spirit, to another the
[1:01:15] gifts of healing by the same spirit,
[1:01:20] to another working of miracles, to
[1:01:21] another prophecy, to another discerning
[1:01:23] of the spirits, to another diverse kinds
[1:01:25] of tongues, to another interpretation of
[1:01:27] tongues. But all these workketh that one
[1:01:30] and the selfsame spirit, dividing every
[1:01:32] man severally as he will. So God is
[1:01:35] taking he's got a work to do and he's
[1:01:38] not putting it on me.
[1:01:40] As I said, look out.
[1:01:45] And I don't see one person here that has
[1:01:50] come because I have invited them.
[1:01:56] So they're coming from other people.
[1:01:59] They're coming because you have a
[1:02:01] ministry.
[1:02:03] you have something to do
[1:02:06] for the body is one and hath many
[1:02:08] members and also and all the members of
[1:02:10] one body being one are one body so also
[1:02:14] is Christ he's showing that he's showing
[1:02:16] us that Christ himself is made up of a
[1:02:17] variety of different people with
[1:02:19] different callings with different looks
[1:02:21] with different personalities for by one
[1:02:23] spirit we are all baptized into one body
[1:02:26] where body whether be Jews or Gentiles
[1:02:28] whether be bond or free and have been
[1:02:31] made to to drink into one spirit. For
[1:02:35] the body is not one member.
[1:02:38] We build a statue
[1:02:41] and say it all has to look like that.
[1:02:47] But many
[1:02:51] and every member acts different. If the
[1:02:53] foot shall say because I am not of the
[1:02:54] hand, I'm not the hand. I'm not of the
[1:02:57] body. Is it therefore not of the body?
[1:02:59] You think because you're not a minister
[1:03:01] or you're not a deacon in the church or
[1:03:03] you're not a trustee or you don't have a
[1:03:05] prominent role as as the man would call
[1:03:07] it and one of those you think that
[1:03:09] you're not just as important as anybody
[1:03:11] else.
[1:03:13] Bible says that the the pastor he's the
[1:03:16] lowest
[1:03:18] of everyone.
[1:03:21] And if the ear shall say because I am
[1:03:23] not of the eye, I'm not of the body. Is
[1:03:25] it therefore not of the body? If the
[1:03:27] whole body were an eye, where were the
[1:03:30] hearing? If the whole body were a
[1:03:31] hearing, where would be the smelling?
[1:03:34] But now God hath said, Don't you love
[1:03:36] the way Paul just puts it in terms that
[1:03:38] we can understand?
[1:03:40] He's like, if you're an ear and
[1:03:42] everybody's an ear, you got no nose, you
[1:03:44] got no eyes.
[1:03:48] But now God has set the members, every
[1:03:50] one of them in the body as it has
[1:03:52] pleased him.
[1:03:55] It pleases God to have a variety of
[1:03:56] people sitting in these pews
[1:03:59] that look different, that act different,
[1:04:01] and that have different ministries and
[1:04:03] different callings on their lives.
[1:04:06] And if they were all one member as we
[1:04:10] want to make them, as Nebuchadnezzar
[1:04:12] wanted to make them, as the Pharisees
[1:04:14] and the Sadducees wanted to make them,
[1:04:16] where were the body? He's repeating
[1:04:19] himself again. If they all conform to
[1:04:20] the same image, then where would the
[1:04:22] body be?
[1:04:25] It all be a mouth.
[1:04:30] That's exactly what we need is more
[1:04:31] mouths.
[1:04:35] Really,
[1:04:38] but now are they many members yet but
[1:04:40] one body. And the eye cannot say to the
[1:04:43] hand, I have no need of thee. Nor again
[1:04:45] the head to the feet, I have no need of
[1:04:47] you. Nay, much more those members of the
[1:04:49] body which seem to be more feeble are
[1:04:51] necessary. Another translation of that
[1:04:54] one says, "And on the contrary, those
[1:04:55] parts of the body that seem to be weaker
[1:04:57] are indispensable.
[1:05:00] And those members of the body which we
[1:05:02] think to be less honorable upon upon
[1:05:04] these, we bestow more abundant honor,
[1:05:06] and our uncumbly parts have more abund
[1:05:09] abundant comeliness. For our comely
[1:05:10] parts have no need. But God hath
[1:05:12] tempered the body together, having given
[1:05:15] more abundant honor to that part which
[1:05:17] we lacked." Another translation says,
[1:05:19] "While we pre while while our
[1:05:21] presentable parts need no special
[1:05:23] treatment, but God has put the body
[1:05:25] together, giving greater greater honor
[1:05:28] to the parts that lacked it." Paul is
[1:05:30] talking here about parts of the body
[1:05:32] that are hidden.
[1:05:37] These are the parts that are behind the
[1:05:38] scenes.
[1:05:40] those that are cleaning the church,
[1:05:43] cleaning the rooms for the kids,
[1:05:45] pressure washing the outside of the
[1:05:46] church, visiting the sick in the
[1:05:47] hospitals, calling those who haven't
[1:05:49] been at church and might be going
[1:05:51] through a hard time.
[1:05:54] Those are the private ones, the ones
[1:05:56] that we don't see standing up in the
[1:05:58] pulpit. That there should be no schism
[1:06:00] in the body, no separation, but that the
[1:06:03] members should have the same care one
[1:06:05] for another.
[1:06:07] Be no division in the body. And whether
[1:06:10] one member suffers, I love this part.
[1:06:13] This brings us all together.
[1:06:17] One, whether one member suffers, all the
[1:06:20] members suffer with it. Or one member be
[1:06:24] honored,
[1:06:26] all the members rejoice
[1:06:29] with it. That's the church that I want
[1:06:31] to have.
[1:06:34] Now, ye are the body of Christ and
[1:06:35] members in particular. Each one of you,
[1:06:39] another translation says, "Now you are
[1:06:40] the body of Christ, and each one of you
[1:06:42] is a part of it. And God hath set some
[1:06:44] in the church, first apostles, secondary
[1:06:46] prophets, thirdly teachers, after that
[1:06:48] miracles and gifts of healings, helps,
[1:06:50] governments, diversity of tongues. Are
[1:06:52] all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all
[1:06:54] teachers? Are all workers of miracles?
[1:06:56] Have all the gifts of healing? Do all
[1:06:59] speak with tongues? Do all interpret?
[1:07:01] We're all different.
[1:07:07] The church is made up of a variety.
[1:07:11] As I said, God loves that. Look at all
[1:07:14] the different animals he made.
[1:07:16] He could have just made all cows.
[1:07:21] I mean, they had steak every day, but it
[1:07:24] would have got old.
[1:07:29] Have all the gifts of healing. Do all
[1:07:31] speak with tongues? Do all interpret?
[1:07:34] But covet earnestly the best gifts and
[1:07:36] yet I show unto you a more excellent
[1:07:39] way. And then it goes into one of the
[1:07:42] most famous chapters in the entire Bible
[1:07:45] which tells us that more excellent way
[1:07:47] that Paul is talking about is having
[1:07:49] these gifts administered in love.
[1:07:54] When you have love, you have compassion
[1:07:57] and it will mean more to you. The
[1:08:00] musicians could come and we'll close.
[1:08:04] I want to point out that an image
[1:08:08] and a vision are two different things.
[1:08:13] As I said, my vision for this church is
[1:08:16] to have sinners in the pews all the
[1:08:19] time.
[1:08:21] I want that life coming in all the time.
[1:08:26] Come as you are, but don't stay as you
[1:08:28] are.
[1:08:31] There's a constant progression of people
[1:08:33] coming in, making changes to their
[1:08:34] lives, and then helping others make
[1:08:36] changes to their lives.
[1:08:40] 1 Corinthians, we just read chapter 12,
[1:08:42] is the church body operating in
[1:08:45] according to the word. Listen, that 1
[1:08:49] Corinthians 12 is not an image that Paul
[1:08:51] created.
[1:08:54] It's a promise
[1:08:57] and it's a vision for the church. I want
[1:09:02] that church. I want it. Paul laid it out
[1:09:07] right here. Brother Andy, why can't we
[1:09:09] have it? Why can't we have preaching the
[1:09:13] gospel and miracles and the sisters
[1:09:15] going and helping and and helping each
[1:09:17] other out and the brothers going and
[1:09:18] helping the other brothers out,
[1:09:20] witnessing, bringing people in, starting
[1:09:22] with the families as we've done.
[1:09:24] Continue that on. Bring them in because
[1:09:26] they can use it. They need the help. And
[1:09:30] who can provide the help? It's the
[1:09:32] person sitting next in the pew
[1:09:35] taking care of them.
[1:09:38] Each person operating under that gift
[1:09:41] and each piece of that puzzle,
[1:09:44] the master's hand,
[1:09:47] taking them,
[1:09:49] placing them perfectly, fitly joined
[1:09:52] together as the body of Christ. How
[1:09:54] beautiful would that be? Not an image we
[1:09:58] have of how we need to serve God. Not an
[1:10:00] image we have of our religion,
[1:10:04] but an open heart
[1:10:06] constantly with our minds and our eyes
[1:10:10] on Jesus Christ. When we lose that
[1:10:13] focus,
[1:10:15] then we lose the revelation.
[1:10:18] Then we lose the life.
[1:10:20] Every epistle
[1:10:23] in this New Testament, I was reading in
[1:10:25] 1 Corinthians, but each one, you can go
[1:10:27] to Ephesians or Colossians or any of
[1:10:29] them, they had each each one had the
[1:10:32] vision,
[1:10:33] which was look at Christ. Put your eyes
[1:10:36] on him
[1:10:39] and your life will be good.
[1:10:42] Jesus, one of the last things that he
[1:10:43] said, he said, "Go into the world and
[1:10:45] make disciples.
[1:10:48] lead them to me
[1:10:50] and then you know what'll happen then
[1:10:52] they will lead others
[1:10:56] saw this thing
[1:10:59] as we close on
[1:11:01] rabbits and elephants
[1:11:04] an elephant when they have a baby it's
[1:11:07] like two years
[1:11:10] takes them to have one elephant
[1:11:13] big big animal you know big beautiful
[1:11:16] animal rabbits
[1:11:18] It's like a month and they have a whole
[1:11:21] bunch of them. Little baby rabbits
[1:11:23] running everywhere.
[1:11:25] And then they can have rabbits again
[1:11:29] right after that. And these rabbits,
[1:11:32] they'll they'll spread around.
[1:11:35] And that's how the gospel is. We all
[1:11:38] want an elephant standing on the
[1:11:39] pullpit. We all want something great
[1:11:42] that we can point to. But the better
[1:11:45] thing
[1:11:47] is just you witness to somebody, then
[1:11:50] they witness to somebody, and pretty
[1:11:52] soon all of the world believes this
[1:11:55] Jesus Christ, and the work's finished,
[1:11:58] and it's over.
[1:12:01] Don't try to be an elephant.
[1:12:04] We want to witness. We want to lift up
[1:12:08] Christ. We want more people to know him.
[1:12:12] Are you with me, friends? In this next
[1:12:15] year, we had a great year. This past
[1:12:18] year, there's there's wonderful things.
[1:12:21] Was talking to brother Ed before
[1:12:22] service. It's just been a blessing. I
[1:12:25] believe God's been with us. I really do.
[1:12:28] And I thank him all the time. Lord,
[1:12:30] thank you for the families that we have.
[1:12:32] It was just I think many of us were
[1:12:34] taken back by the Christmas program and
[1:12:38] and just these kids and how good of a
[1:12:40] job that they did. It's like, "Wow, we
[1:12:42] have a church. We got we got we got it
[1:12:46] going on now, but Lord, let's make sure
[1:12:49] it's you.
[1:12:50] [Music]
[1:12:52] Lord, make sure that if we're going to
[1:12:54] renovate, it's you.
[1:12:56] Make sure that if we're going to have
[1:12:58] service or we're not going to have
[1:12:59] service, Lord, make sure it's you. What
[1:13:01] do you want? not my image of what a
[1:13:03] church should be.
[1:13:06] I want his
[1:13:09] plan for us.
[1:13:12] Are you with me? Will you pray? We talk
[1:13:15] about all these different offices in the
[1:13:17] church, brother Kevin, and and how that
[1:13:20] each one one has a gift of healing. You
[1:13:23] know, I see in our brother over here
[1:13:25] that the Lord has given him a gift
[1:13:28] to pray for the sick.
[1:13:31] I've seen gifts in other people,
[1:13:35] but I believe the greatest gift
[1:13:39] is being able to get down on your knees
[1:13:43] and talk to God.
[1:13:46] He may give me a gift of being able to
[1:13:48] look in the scriptures and understanding
[1:13:51] these things,
[1:13:53] but if I could have a gift, it would be
[1:13:55] to talk to him.
[1:13:57] I would love, brother Joe, to go on your
[1:14:00] behalf and say, "My friend is hurting or
[1:14:02] his family's hurting. Lord, hear me."
[1:14:04] And to have him here in that secret
[1:14:08] closet
[1:14:10] and pray. And when we pray, Jesus said,
[1:14:14] "If you go into the closet and you do
[1:14:15] this in secret, God will reward you
[1:14:18] openly. He's not going to exalt you.
[1:14:21] He's going to answer your prayer.
[1:14:24] And that person's going to be healed."
[1:14:26] that person's going to be delivered.
[1:14:28] That's the greatest gift. I want to see
[1:14:31] people praying, talking to God, knowing
[1:14:34] him,
[1:14:36] and he'll set everything else in order.
[1:14:39] But to me, those are the greatest people
[1:14:41] in the church are the ones that really
[1:14:44] pray, Sister Shirley. It's the greatest
[1:14:46] of all of them.
[1:14:48] I want to see more people in this
[1:14:50] congregation rise up. I want to see more
[1:14:52] people come in that have that gift.
[1:14:56] And I want to see us continue on. We're
[1:14:58] going to have a good year next year if
[1:14:59] the Lord carries. And if we stay humble
[1:15:02] if we stay in his presence and we
[1:15:04] understand, Lord, this is nothing that
[1:15:06] we have done.
[1:15:09] If we did it, it would be glorifying
[1:15:12] ourselves,
[1:15:14] but it's him.
[1:15:18] One of the things it's been a blessing
[1:15:23] is all these people being baptized.
[1:15:28] Brother Silas or anyone else
[1:15:32] and anyone else that would like to be
[1:15:33] baptized this morning. It's a good time.
[1:15:35] Brother Silas, if you could go see
[1:15:36] Brother Ed there in the back. Are you
[1:15:38] still, Brother? You still in?
[1:15:41] Can't do anything better, man.
[1:15:44] Any
[1:15:46] other brothers or sisters that want to
[1:15:48] be baptized? I want to say a couple
[1:15:50] words about baptism as I usually do. I
[1:15:53] think the most important thing about
[1:15:55] baptism, remember John the Baptist
[1:15:58] baptized. The Bible even says they
[1:16:00] baptized in the wilderness way back when
[1:16:02] Moses was there.
[1:16:05] So why is this baptism so important now
[1:16:08] that Paul would go to Ephesus and he
[1:16:11] would ask them, they said, "We We want
[1:16:14] to receive the holy. He said, 'Have you
[1:16:16] received the Holy Spirit? They said, we
[1:16:17] don't even know that there is a Holy
[1:16:18] Spirit. What are you talking about?
[1:16:20] First thing Paul asked, how are you
[1:16:22] baptized? These people were already
[1:16:24] baptized
[1:16:27] and they said, well, we were baptized
[1:16:28] under John's baptism. Which means they
[1:16:32] repented. They felt bad for what they
[1:16:35] had done wrong.
[1:16:37] and they went into the waters of baptism
[1:16:40] to show everyone I am going to change my
[1:16:44] life. But that wasn't enough.
[1:16:48] So often today we see people get
[1:16:50] baptized that means that a member of the
[1:16:52] church that's false.
[1:16:55] When you are baptized there must be a
[1:16:58] name associated with it. If it's titles
[1:17:02] then you're doing the same thing that
[1:17:04] they were doing. you're just feeling bad
[1:17:05] and you're getting baptized.
[1:17:08] But when you are baptized according to
[1:17:10] the Bible, according to the book of
[1:17:12] Acts, according to Jesus Christ
[1:17:17] as taught by Peter,
[1:17:20] you are taking that name
[1:17:22] of Christ. You're not taking the name of
[1:17:25] the Tucson Tabernacle. You're not taking
[1:17:27] the name of the Catholic Church. You're
[1:17:28] not taking the name of the Baptist
[1:17:30] Church. You are taking the name of Jesus
[1:17:32] Christ and saying I am part of him.
[1:17:35] That's why it's so important. And that's
[1:17:37] why if you have been baptized in a
[1:17:38] different way,
[1:17:41] it's not right.
[1:17:44] It has to be associated with Christ.
[1:17:48] And that's who I want to be associated
[1:17:49] with when I'm baptized. Baptized in the
[1:17:52] name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
[1:17:54] No, no, no.
[1:17:56] I want to be associated with Jesus
[1:17:58] Christ.
[1:18:00] I want to be associated with the name,
[1:18:03] the name of Jesus.
[1:18:06] And that's what we do here. You are not
[1:18:10] being baptized in any way as a
[1:18:12] membership of this church.
[1:18:15] You are being baptized according to our
[1:18:19] Lord, our Savior Jesus Christ. God bless
[1:18:23] you all. Let's have a great year next
[1:18:26] year. It's the last year of this one.
[1:18:33] I'm glad it's over
[1:18:37] because there's greater things. There's
[1:18:39] greater things to come. God bless you
[1:18:41] all.
[1:18:43] As I said, it's a good time. If you have
[1:18:47] desire to be baptized, it's a good time
[1:18:50] to do it. God bless you all.
[1:18:53] He became me
[1:18:57] so that I might become him by grace.
[1:19:05] [Music]
[1:19:08] He became me
[1:19:12] so that I might become him by grace.
[1:19:23] He
[1:19:24] took my place
[1:19:27] so that I
[1:19:29] through his love could take his.
[1:19:37] He became me
[1:19:41] so that I might become him by grace.
[1:19:49] If you appreciate that of him, sing it
[1:19:51] to him. He became me
[1:19:56] so that I might become him by grace.
[1:20:07] He became me
[1:20:10] so that I might become him by grace.
[1:20:21] He
[1:20:22] took my place
[1:20:25] so that I through his grace could take
[1:20:30] it.
[1:20:35] He became me
[1:20:39] so that I might become him by grace.
[1:20:49] I've shared this with you. When I went
[1:20:52] through the surgery
[1:20:54] and I had the toe amputated
[1:20:57] and the case manager talked to me and my
[1:20:59] wife later after recovery,
[1:21:03] she said, "There's about 6,000 things
[1:21:05] going on in your body all the time that
[1:21:09] you're not even aware of
[1:21:11] until one of them doesn't work.
[1:21:15] than it shows.
[1:21:17] So in the body of Christ, you have a
[1:21:19] place. You have a part to do your part.
[1:21:22] And when your heart's not getting done,
[1:21:25] then the body is missing that part.
[1:21:28] As little as it might seem,
[1:21:31] but it's needful. Amen. I'm going to
[1:21:34] live the way he wants me to live.
[1:21:39] I'm going to live
[1:21:42] the way
[1:21:45] he wants me to live. I'm going to give
[1:21:53] until there's just no more to give. I'm
[1:22:00] going to love
[1:22:03] love till there's just no more love.
[1:22:09] I could never
[1:22:12] ever love the Lord.
[1:22:19] I'm going to live
[1:22:22] the way
[1:22:24] he wants me to live. I'm going to give
[1:22:32] until there's just no more to give.
[1:22:38] I'm going to laugh
[1:22:42] till there's just no more love.
[1:22:48] I could never
[1:22:50] never have. If you mean it, raise your
[1:22:54] hand and raise it to him.
[1:22:57] I'm going to live
[1:23:00] the way
[1:23:02] he wants me to live. I'm going to give
[1:23:10] until there's just no more to give. I'm
[1:23:16] going to love
[1:23:19] love till there's just no more love.
[1:23:26] I could never
[1:23:29] out love alone.
[1:23:33] [Music]
[1:23:34] This is brother Dan ready up there.
[1:23:38] Oh, make
[1:23:40] me more
[1:23:43] like thee,
[1:23:46] Jesus.
[1:23:49] Make
[1:23:50] me more
[1:23:53] like thee.
[1:23:55] [Music]
[1:23:58] Give me a heart
[1:24:02] that's f filled with love
[1:24:07] and make
[1:24:09] me more
[1:24:12] like thee.
[1:24:16] Yes, make
[1:24:19] me more
[1:24:21] like thee,
[1:24:24] Jesus.
[1:24:27] Make
[1:24:28] me more
[1:24:31] like thee.
[1:24:36] Give me a heart
[1:24:40] that's filled
[1:24:42] with love
[1:24:45] and make me more
[1:24:50] like
[1:24:51] brother Silus Lindsay
[1:24:54] friend of brother Silus if you stand
[1:24:55] over here. Friend of many of us talked
[1:24:58] about his dad brother David this
[1:25:00] morning. Brother Silas was baptized at
[1:25:04] nine years old. Am I right? And it was
[1:25:07] something that he didn't really
[1:25:08] understand what he was doing.
[1:25:10] We were talking there just now. And I
[1:25:15] asked him, I said, "Brother Silas, do
[1:25:16] you understand
[1:25:19] what you are doing right now in taking
[1:25:22] on that name of Jesus Christ through
[1:25:25] baptism?" Now, as Silas Lindsay walks
[1:25:29] around this world, that is a
[1:25:32] representative of Jesus Christ walking
[1:25:35] around the world.
[1:25:38] It's a very serious thing, this baptism.
[1:25:42] Brother Silas, would you say a few
[1:25:44] words?
[1:25:46] Well, I just want to be baptized
[1:25:49] according to Acts 2:38 for the remission
[1:25:53] of my sins. And I've been led to do
[1:25:56] this. It's been on my heart for a while.
[1:25:59] And I didn't really understand the
[1:26:01] gravity of what I was doing when I was 9
[1:26:03] years old.
[1:26:05] But now I do. I know it's a life lived
[1:26:08] for Jesus Christ.
[1:26:10] And that's the only thing that I desire
[1:26:12] in this life is to serve the Lord.
[1:27:03] [Applause]
[1:27:21] God bless you all.
[1:27:22] Friends, reminder, no service. Tonight,
[1:27:26] we're going to start a new year. I think
[1:27:28] we ended this old year very, very well.
[1:27:32] What do you think? Amen.
[1:27:34] [Applause]
[1:27:39] So, so let's keep it going. Let's keep
[1:27:41] that momentum going. We need more
[1:27:42] momentum. God bless you all. Brother
[1:27:44] Aaron, if you would take the service,
[1:27:46] please, and close.
[1:27:49] It's a life behind the name
[1:27:53] that makes the demons tremble.
[1:27:57] It's a life behind the name
[1:28:01] that makes a proud heart tumble.
[1:28:05] It was God who devised a plan
[1:28:09] that in all things as a man,
[1:28:13] he would live so he could give. Give us
[1:28:17] a life behind. Let's stand as we sing
[1:28:21] it. It's the life behind the name
[1:28:25] that makes the demons tremble.

[1:28:55] Brother Mike Walter, brother Daniel has
[1:28:57] asked that you would close in prayer. if
[1:28:59] you would do that. It's the life of

[1:29:34] Lord. And
[1:29:38] we just thank you, Lord.
