[6:57] before

[7:13] so if you were here on Wednesday or you

[7:18] leader
[7:19] and I said oh Lord how am I ever gonna
[7:21] lead someone again
[7:24] so can I tell him
[7:27] I'm going to anyways we were talking
[7:30] about how are we going to do this
[7:31] brother Jonathan
[7:34] so I told sister Martha I don't know
[7:36] what I'm going to do
[7:38] he said we'll just call you a Sweet Hour
[7:41] of Prayer
[7:44] because I drag it out for an hour I
[7:46] think
[7:48] how many appreciated brother Jonathan

[7:53] I told brother Jonathan after service I
[7:56] said I'm glad you did it the way you are
[7:58] and didn't try to to be like us I really
[8:01] appreciated that so it's good
[8:04] to know what brother green used to say
[8:06] something if you I don't know if you
[8:08] heard he said you go down amongst the
[8:10] people in Africa he said what a spirit
[8:11] what a wonderful thing and he would say
[8:13] just the temple and all he said but he
[8:16] said I think we'll sing in Spanish
[8:18] because they seem to be the happiest
[8:21] and then he said we'll never sing in
[8:22] German no he goes they're the slowest
[8:25] but in any way to praise the Lord he
[8:28] accepts it all in your way in my way and
[8:30] I appreciate that he's so good to us
[8:32] amen when peace like a river
[8:36] attendeth my way
[8:38] sometimes it's not a peaceful River

[22:38] [Music]
[22:54] right now
[22:57] [Music]
[23:06] thank the Lord let's bow our heads
[23:11] Lord Jesus we thank you for that touch
[23:14] that you could
[23:16] Lord lower yourself and touch a sinner
[23:19] such as I
[23:20] [Music]
[23:21] a grateful Lord
[23:23] all that you do for us
[23:25] father now we pray that as we go through
[23:29] this book of Acts tonight is chapter
[23:31] seven I pray that father your anointing
[23:35] would be here and father we could learn
[23:37] about your word for it means so much to
[23:40] us
[23:41] in Jesus name we pray
[23:43] amen
[23:44] God bless you all you can take your
[23:46] seats
[23:51] Jonathan it's good to have you back my
[23:53] brother
[23:54] Jonathan was um did you make it to
[23:57] Sunset
[24:03] good
[24:08] good so brother Jonathan was in he was
[24:11] at Sunset down uh if you're not familiar
[24:14] with it down
[24:15] really in the middle of nowhere in
[24:18] Arizona near a little town called
[24:20] Klondike that sometimes has a store
[24:22] there and sometimes it doesn't but it
[24:25] always has a few ranchers in the area
[24:27] and it was a special place
[24:30] to brother Branham a lot of powerful
[24:34] things happened there and it's a special
[24:37] place to all of us that we could go
[24:40] there and they've shut it down I don't
[24:42] know it's probably been closed off for
[24:44] about the past 10 years or so
[24:47] um so uh brother Jonathan I think in the
[24:51] brothers have covertly found a way that
[24:53] if you go through the desert and you
[24:56] take a left at the big Saguaro you go
[24:59] down there and you take a ride at the
[25:00] big rock and then you follow the ridge
[25:03] down and you make sure you don't step to
[25:05] the left because you fall you'll go down
[25:07] and then you take a trail down and you
[25:09] watch the rattlesnakes and and you get
[25:12] down into the wash and then you walk to
[25:14] the wash and you get to the spot am I
[25:15] right is that about where it's at
[25:17] it's that's I've been there before
[25:20] you know it's a special place we we know
[25:22] what happened there we know that that
[25:24] brother Branham had a couple very
[25:26] powerful experiences once with a
[25:29] whirlwind and once once with the blast
[25:31] where he
[25:33] was given Revelation to go back and the
[25:37] Lord was going to reveal the Seven Seals
[25:39] to him and some special very very
[25:42] special things happen there and
[25:45] we go there in remembrance of these
[25:48] things
[25:49] just as Joshua at gilgal He piled up
[25:53] these 12 Stones to remind the people
[25:55] that when when you come here and and
[25:58] when the your children ask what me Me by
[26:02] these stones
[26:03] that you can tell them the story that
[26:06] happened
[26:08] and point them to
[26:10] to this the reason that this rock is
[26:13] here
[26:14] brother is is because it's a it's a
[26:17] monument to what happened there at
[26:19] sunset and we always need to remember
[26:22] that it's not the Rock
[26:24] there that it's just a rock and it's not
[26:27] those stones that Joshua piled up
[26:29] they're just Stones they don't mean
[26:31] anything but it's those Lively Stones as
[26:35] Peter said it's those living stones that
[26:39] it was is what matters today those
[26:40] things give us encouragement but it's
[26:43] this vessel right here that is filled
[26:45] with the holy spirit that is what
[26:48] matters that is what God uses
[26:51] but those places are special to us
[26:52] brother Jonathan I'm glad that you got
[26:55] to go and with the kindness of the
[26:57] brothers to take you down there I know
[26:58] it was a special trip to you I've been
[26:59] there many times as I said many special
[27:01] things have happened to me down there
[27:05] um like to uh
[27:08] announce
[27:10] um not this coming weekend but next
[27:13] Friday so not this closest Friday but
[27:16] the following Friday I want to do

[28:46] other what we're going to minister on
[28:48] and and brother Octavio said there's no
[28:50] subject just do whatever's on your heart
[28:52] so we'll see how the Lord leads there

[29:16] I'm still friends with the brother
[29:17] George Ferguson I assume you know him
[29:19] he's he's a he's a good friend a close
[29:22] brother there and um
[29:25] yeah it just just welcome thank you
[29:27] thank you for coming we've been studying
[29:29] on Wednesday nights and sometimes Sunday
[29:31] nights we've been studying on the book
[29:33] of Acts we started in chapter one and
[29:36] now we're in chapter seven chapter seven
[29:40] tonight brother Lyle had just preached
[29:42] on chapter six
[29:43] and in chapter 6 we see these seven men
[29:49] that come on the scene these very very
[29:51] special men as brother Lyle pointed out
[29:53] they were Hellenist Jews they weren't
[29:55] the the Jews that maybe were from the
[29:58] the
[30:00] um
[30:01] country of Israel but they were Greek
[30:04] they spoke Greek and
[30:06] they were they were great men of God
[30:10] at towards the end of chapter six we see
[30:13] that they bring this young man
[30:18] named Stephen
[30:20] they bring him to trial
[30:22] and Stephen
[30:24] is
[30:27] I don't know if I've seen a preacher
[30:31] in the Bible
[30:33] as well versed in the scriptures
[30:37] as this man Stephen he's not just
[30:39] telling a story brother Lyle as he goes
[30:42] as he goes through this this defense
[30:44] that he has when he's on trial he is
[30:47] typing things perfectly from the Old
[30:50] Testament and he's bringing them down
[30:52] and he's putting them in here and
[30:55] relating them to this man Jesus
[30:58] and they say you know what let's uh
[31:00] maybe let's just read it in uh in Acts
[31:03] chapter six
[31:06] let's start with
[31:09] a little bit of review from where
[31:10] brother Lyle stopped off
[31:14] Let's uh let's start with verse 10 here
[31:18] and they were not able to resist the
[31:20] wisdom and the Spirit by which he spake
[31:23] right there
[31:26] then they stubborn men which said we
[31:30] have heard him speak Blasphemous words
[31:32] now this is very important
[31:34] we have heard him speak Blasphemous
[31:37] words against Moses
[31:39] and against God
[31:41] and they stirred up the people and the
[31:42] elders and the scribes and they came
[31:44] upon him and caught him and brought him
[31:46] to the council and to set up false
[31:49] Witnesses
[31:50] which said this man ceases not to speak
[31:54] Blasphemous words against this holy
[31:56] Place speaking of the Temple
[32:00] against this holy place and the law
[32:03] so we see that that they're accusing
[32:06] this man Stephen of speaking Blasphemous
[32:09] words against God against Moses against
[32:13] the temple and against the law
[32:17] for we have heard him say that this
[32:19] Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this
[32:21] place and shall change the Customs which
[32:24] Moses delivered us
[32:26] and all that sat in the council looking
[32:28] steadfast on him steadfastly on him saw
[32:31] his face as it had been the face of an
[32:35] Angel
[32:38] and then we go to we go to chapter seven
[32:41] here
[32:43] and you'll notice
[32:45] as Stephen as he brings his defense
[32:49] against
[32:51] these these um priests
[32:54] he brings it in and you'll see if Peter
[32:58] has done this too he brings it in a
[33:00] historical context
[33:02] and this historical context was very
[33:05] important to the Jewish people it was
[33:08] obviously important because I don't know
[33:11] except for maybe the the cuttings on on
[33:15] the the pyramid walls and that type of
[33:17] thing I don't know of any ancient
[33:21] writings that have been preserved like
[33:24] these Jewish writings this thing that we
[33:27] called the Bible
[33:29] so this this these writings of their
[33:32] ancestors and of their prophets they
[33:34] were very very important to the Jews
[33:36] this history was very important
[33:39] so we see as Stephen begins his defense
[33:44] we see that he brings it into a
[33:48] historical context Peter had already
[33:50] done that but now it's in Stephen's
[33:53] writings it's much more uh detailed than
[33:57] it has been and it turns out it is an
[34:00] absolutely
[34:01] tremendous Serv sermon that this man
[34:05] preached and he was a deacon
[34:08] standing before it says here the council
[34:12] standing before the council these
[34:14] Pharisees and Sadducees there who were
[34:16] we would call them phds today studied
[34:20] this stuff their whole life knew it
[34:23] backwards and forwards and here we see
[34:25] this Hellenist Jew come in and he can
[34:30] match wits with the best of them
[34:32] and we see we see Stephen and he starts
[34:35] to speak and I look and I I see that
[34:37] there's there's people here and it says
[34:40] here that there's people present one of
[34:43] those present that we know is present
[34:47] is none other than a protege of one of
[34:52] the greatest most reputable Pharisees in
[34:57] all the land which is this man Gamaliel
[35:02] so we have this young man over here
[35:05] who's mentioned at the end of the
[35:07] chapter that I'm talking about and then
[35:10] we have this other young man Stephen
[35:13] this deacon
[35:15] both of them are here both of them are
[35:18] very on very very opposite sides one
[35:21] young man over here this Pharisee he is
[35:25] bent on destroying this new cult this
[35:30] new movement among the Jews he hates it
[35:33] and then we have this man Stephen over
[35:36] here and it's everything to see him get
[35:39] this gospel out about this man named
[35:42] Jesus Christ
[35:45] verse number one
[35:47] then said the high priest are these
[35:50] things so
[35:52] and Stephen said this
[35:55] men and brethren
[35:57] and fathers hearken the god of Glory
[36:00] appeared unto our Father Abraham when he
[36:02] was in Mesopotamia before he dwelt in
[36:05] Karen and said unto him get thee out of
[36:09] thy country and from my Kindred and come
[36:11] into the land which I shall show thee
[36:15] now Stephen here
[36:17] is probably standing he probably doesn't
[36:19] have any scrolls with him
[36:21] I doubt very seriously that he would
[36:23] have that and you're going to see in
[36:26] this as we go through this chapter that
[36:29] this young man knows this book backwards
[36:32] and forwards
[36:34] then came he out
[36:37] speaking of Abraham here
[36:41] then he came then came he out of the
[36:43] land of the Chaldeans and dwelt and
[36:45] Karen
[36:46] and from thence when his father was dead
[36:48] he removed him into this land wherein
[36:51] you now dwell
[36:52] and he gave him not inheritance in it no
[36:56] not so much as to set his foot on yet he
[36:59] promised that he would give it to him
[37:01] for a possession and to his seed after
[37:04] him when as yet he had no child now
[37:07] remember the story of Abraham
[37:09] that he he had his wife
[37:12] Sarah they had no children but God had
[37:15] made a promise to Abraham that he would
[37:18] not only have a child but his offspring
[37:21] his descendants would number like the
[37:23] stars in the sky
[37:25] and God spake on this wise
[37:28] that his seeds should sojourn in a
[37:32] Strange Land and that they should bring
[37:34] them into bondage and then treat them
[37:36] evil 400 years
[37:39] now I mentioned that this morning
[37:41] this was fulfilled
[37:44] when Joseph came
[37:47] Joseph dies
[37:50] Joseph brings his family to Egypt
[37:53] he dies his family stays there and this
[37:57] family is there in Egypt for 400 years
[38:07] in the nation
[38:09] to whom they shall be judged will be in
[38:11] bondage
[38:12] will I judge said God
[38:14] and after that shall they come forth and
[38:17] serve me in this place now he's talking
[38:20] about he's prophesying he's saying here
[38:22] that that I'm going to judge this that
[38:25] I'm going to bring these people out of
[38:27] this Egypt with a mighty hand
[38:30] through a deliverer
[38:33] and he gave him the Covenant of
[38:35] circumcision
[38:36] and so Abraham begat Isaac and
[38:39] circumcised him the Eighth Day and Isaac
[38:41] begat Jacob and Jacob began to 12
[38:44] Patriarchs now this Covenant of
[38:46] circumcision that's gonna this is gonna
[38:48] come into play a little bit later in the
[38:50] chapter
[38:52] and the Patriarchs moved with envy and
[38:54] sold Joseph into Egypt but God was with
[38:57] him
[39:00] now look at look at the wisdom of this
[39:02] Deacon preacher here
[39:05] he's laying the foundation with the
[39:07] story of Joseph who was rejected of his
[39:10] brethren
[39:12] they were his Brethren were jealous of
[39:14] him they tried to murder him but yet
[39:16] against all the obstacles he was thrown
[39:19] in prison and everywhere else God was
[39:21] with this man Joseph
[39:23] and this Deacon preacher here Stephen is
[39:26] establishing a pattern of the Jews
[39:28] rejecting the gifts that God gave them
[39:31] very important in this sermon
[39:36] he even he even says he he says
[39:40] I think that he's referring to that he
[39:43] came to his own and his own received him
[39:45] not
[39:46] John chapter 1
[39:48] . now remember Joseph was rejected of
[39:51] his own brethren so he went to the
[39:54] Gentiles with potiphar and pharaoh and
[39:57] and he prospered there
[39:59] and delivered him out of all his
[40:01] afflictions and gave him favor and
[40:03] wisdom in the sight of pharaoh king of
[40:05] Egypt
[40:06] and may he made him a governor over
[40:09] Egypt and all his house now there came a
[40:12] Darth over all the land of Egypt and in
[40:14] Canaan
[40:15] and great Affliction and our fathers
[40:18] found no substance substance so there
[40:21] was a famine That Came Upon all of this
[40:24] land of Egypt
[40:25] but when Jacob heard that there was corn
[40:27] in Egypt he sent our fathers first very
[40:32] very important point that brother
[40:36] Stephen makes here and it's very subtle
[40:39] but it's just absolutely tremendous
[40:42] Stephen says this
[40:44] and at the second time
[40:49] Joseph was made known to his brethren
[40:52] and Joseph's Kindred was made known to
[40:55] pharaoh
[40:56] so Joseph grew up with all these people
[40:58] just like Jesus grew up in Nazareth and
[41:01] in Capernaum and in Galilee and they
[41:03] rejected rejected Joseph here at the
[41:06] beginning but Joseph's Second Coming
[41:10] remember they thought he was dead
[41:12] and they threw him in the well they
[41:14] picked them up they threw him into
[41:15] prison and they thought that he was gone
[41:18] but upon Joseph's Second Coming
[41:22] the second time he introduces to his
[41:25] brethren
[41:27] then they knew him what a prophetic
[41:30] sermon this is this is D this isn't just
[41:33] history this is like amazing
[41:35] interpretation by this man Stephen very
[41:39] very deep
[41:41] then sent Joseph and called his father
[41:44] Jacob to him and all his Kindred three
[41:46] score and 15 Souls
[41:48] so Jacob went down into Egypt and he
[41:51] died he and our fathers and were carried
[41:54] over to secum and laid in the Sepulcher
[41:57] that Abraham bought for a sum of money
[41:59] of the sons of emor the father of SEC of
[42:02] second
[42:04] but when the time of the promise Drew
[42:06] Nai which God had sworn to Abraham
[42:10] the people grew and multiplied in Egypt
[42:15] to until another king arose which which
[42:19] knew not Joseph
[42:22] now I mentioned that this morning
[42:24] that all of the blessings that Joseph
[42:28] had all of everything that Joseph he
[42:32] stored up the grain and you know the
[42:34] story and and he really saved the whole
[42:36] country of Egypt to where all the
[42:38] countries round about were coming to
[42:40] Egypt to get this grain
[42:43] and this new Pharaoh after all of these
[42:47] years some 400 years or so he raised up
[42:51] and he didn't know the history
[42:54] of this man Joseph this savior really of
[42:58] Egypt
[43:01] and this talking about this man this
[43:05] this Empire
[43:07] that was ruling over the people at this
[43:10] time this Egypt it ruled them harshly
[43:14] now remember all of this
[43:17] our brother Stephen is typing so we see
[43:20] this Gentile group this Egypt
[43:24] and they are ruling over
[43:27] this these Jews these Hebrews
[43:31] and if we look the same thing was
[43:36] happening
[43:37] when Jesus came
[43:39] it wasn't Egypt that was ruling over but
[43:42] it was a gentile group called Rome and
[43:45] now they are ruling over this group of
[43:50] Hebrews
[43:51] and he's bringing this down through
[43:54] history
[43:57] and the same dealt subtly with our
[43:59] kindred
[44:00] and evil entreated our fathers so that
[44:04] they cast out their young children to
[44:06] the end
[44:07] to the end that they might not live
[44:10] so
[44:12] we know this story
[44:15] so here we have Moses and and here he is
[44:18] Stephen is laying again the foundation
[44:20] and he's saying remember when Moses was
[44:23] here and remember they were taking the
[44:24] babies and they were throwing them in
[44:25] the Nile River and they were killing
[44:27] them they were there was too many of
[44:30] them so they were taking these these
[44:32] these kids and they were throwing in
[44:34] them in the river killing them the
[44:36] crocodiles were eating them they were
[44:38] all dialing dying and this is when Moses
[44:40] was here guess what was happening
[44:44] some I don't know 33 34 years before
[44:48] Stephen preached this
[44:50] we have this man Herod
[44:52] and he is saying kill every boy below
[44:56] this certain age because of this
[44:58] prophecy that was going to happen
[45:00] the same thing was happening here in
[45:03] Jesus's time as in with Moses's time
[45:07] and and Stephen is laying this
[45:09] Foundation saying look what is going on
[45:13] here
[45:15] remember they had accused him of
[45:17] blaspheming Moses
[45:18] now Stephen here
[45:21] you know he's remember he's on trial
[45:24] and Stephen here is lifting up Moses
[45:28] like I'm not blasphemy blast blaspheming
[45:31] him I'm not speaking against Moses Moses
[45:34] was a great man
[45:36] and he's showing that that this Moses
[45:39] and he's that look at what happened to
[45:42] him and he's gonna get to a scripture a
[45:45] little bit later that's gonna just
[45:47] clinch it all together
[45:52] verse number 20.
[45:55] in which time Moses was born and was
[45:58] exceeding fair and nourished up in his
[46:00] father's house house three months
[46:04] and when he was cast out
[46:06] Pharaoh's daughter took him up and
[46:09] nourished him for her own son remember
[46:11] they put him in the basket and soaked it
[46:14] with pitch and and uh and amram puts it
[46:17] in the water and it and it floats it
[46:19] floats down and then I believe his
[46:22] Pharaoh's daughter or sister takes it
[46:25] out
[46:26] and calls him Moses because he was drawn
[46:28] from the water
[46:31] and Moses was learned in all the wisdom
[46:34] of the Egyptians and was mighty in words
[46:36] and indeed
[46:38] so he's like Hey listen Moses was great
[46:43] and when he was a full 40 years old it
[46:46] came into his heart to visit his
[46:48] Brethren the children of Israel
[46:50] and seeing one of them suffer wrong
[46:54] he defended him and Avenged him that was
[46:57] oppressed and smote the Egyptian
[47:01] for he was supposed for he supposed he
[47:04] thought
[47:05] his Brethren would have understood how
[47:09] that God by his hand would deliver them
[47:13] but they understood not right here
[47:15] another
[47:17] really powerful scripture right here
[47:19] he's saying Moses already knew he was
[47:21] the deliverer
[47:24] but they didn't understand it again a
[47:27] parallel between Moses and Jesus
[47:31] we see here that Moses was sent to his
[47:33] own as a deliverer but they didn't
[47:35] understand him the gift that Moses was
[47:38] and here we have Jesus again sent to his
[47:40] own people
[47:41] they did the same to him
[47:43] and the next day
[47:45] he showed himself unto them as they
[47:48] strove and would have set them at one
[47:51] again saying sirs you are Brethren why
[47:54] do you wrong to one another
[47:58] but he that did his neighbor wrong
[48:02] thrust him away
[48:04] saying who made thee a ruler and a judge
[48:09] over us
[48:10] here again
[48:12] Moses is rejected by his own people look
[48:17] at what Stephen is doing he's just
[48:19] reiterating himself over the leader that
[48:22] God raised up to deliver the people he
[48:24] was not accepted
[48:27] now Moses at this time he's about 40
[48:30] years old
[48:33] and he was willing at this point let me
[48:35] let me stop for a minute right there
[48:38] Moses at 40 years old really the prime
[48:40] of his life
[48:42] he had this revelation
[48:45] and look at the character in this man
[48:47] Moses he was willing to give it all up
[48:53] all of the riches that he had everything
[48:56] that he was maybe even in line to be a
[49:00] pharaoh
[49:01] to be the next king
[49:04] but Moses was willing to he was willing
[49:06] to forsake it all
[49:10] and uh
[49:11] let me read that again he said they said
[49:15] to Moses who made you a ruler and a
[49:18] judge over us
[49:23] and this Hebrew that was saying that
[49:26] must have really resented Moses
[49:29] he's like oh you grew up
[49:32] privileged
[49:34] you know you're you're not like us how
[49:37] dare you Moses you don't know what we're
[49:39] suffering you don't know who we are and
[49:42] you think that you're able to come right
[49:44] in and and take over and do what you
[49:47] want to do
[49:49] and look at what the priests said to
[49:52] Jesus
[49:54] they said the same thing who made you a
[49:56] ruler over us
[49:57] Jesus who Do You Think You Are
[49:59] in so much that um
[50:02] what was the guy's name
[50:04] um
[50:05] that uh Pilate
[50:07] took a sign
[50:09] and he he inscribed on it
[50:13] the king of the Jews
[50:15] put it up there
[50:17] and then the Jew said no no no no no
[50:18] don't put up that up there he's not our
[50:21] King you know he says no what you need
[50:23] to put is is he says he's the king of
[50:26] the Jews pilate said
[50:28] I'll put up there what I put up there
[50:30] I've written what I've written
[50:32] amen and he put it up there the same
[50:34] Spirit who made you a King Jesus
[50:38] who made you this Messiah
[50:41] over here they said Moses who made you a
[50:44] ruler over us you were privileged you
[50:46] came up to the Egyptians you're an
[50:48] Egyptian man stay away from us
[50:51] then he says this
[50:54] and he knew he had the goods on Moses
[50:59] he said will thou kill me as thou didst
[51:01] the Egyptian yesterday he had witnessed
[51:03] that Moses in trying to protect
[51:07] one of his own people trying to protect
[51:09] the Hebrew Moses went to battle and
[51:12] killed this Egyptian and here is his own
[51:16] his own man
[51:18] his own race of people
[51:22] selling him out
[51:24] look at what they did
[51:27] to Jesus
[51:28] they said ah Caesar's our King
[51:31] not this guy
[51:34] The Same Spirit this is
[51:37] over a thousand years later that Jesus
[51:41] is there
[51:43] and the same spirit that was on these
[51:46] men
[51:48] back when Moses was here they're
[51:50] attacking Jesus with almost exactly the
[51:53] same words
[51:54] wow
[51:56] and here is this this Deacon preacher
[52:00] young man bringing it out
[52:04] I just I'm in awe
[52:07] of the wisdom of this man Stephen
[52:12] then fled Moses at this saying and was a
[52:16] stranger in the land of Midian where he
[52:18] begat two sons he lived in isolation for
[52:20] the next 40 years
[52:22] and brother Branham
[52:24] said he said that it took 40 years
[52:30] for him to get trained up in the ways of
[52:32] the Egyptian of the Egyptians and then
[52:35] brother Branham said it took another 40
[52:37] years for God to get all of that out of
[52:41] him
[52:41] [Applause]
[52:43] and when 40 years were expired
[52:46] there appeared to him in the wilderness
[52:48] of Mount Sinai an angel of the Lord in
[52:51] the flame of a fire and a bush speaking
[52:55] of the burning bush how common God uses
[52:59] fire
[53:01] to represent him of course we saw it in
[53:04] the burning bush we see the fire coming
[53:07] in the Tabernacle of the Lord when when
[53:09] the presence of the Lord entered we see
[53:11] fire come down at Mount Carmel with
[53:13] Elijah we see fire coming in the temple
[53:15] when Solomon finished it we see tongues
[53:18] of fire over the heads of the people at
[53:21] the day of Pentecost
[53:23] and when Moses saw it he wandered at the
[53:26] site as he drew near to behold it and
[53:29] the voice of the Lord came unto him
[53:31] saying I am the god of thy fathers the
[53:34] god of Abraham and the god of Isaac and
[53:36] the god of Jacob
[53:38] then Moses trembled and did not behold
[53:41] he didn't even look at it
[53:43] he was so afraid of this that was coming
[53:46] out of that bush he knew that the
[53:49] presence of the Lord was there
[53:52] then said the Lord to him put off thy
[53:56] shoes from thy feet
[53:57] for the place where thou standeth is
[53:59] Holy Ground
[54:01] I have seen
[54:03] I have seen the Affliction of my people
[54:06] which is in Egypt
[54:07] and I have heard they're groaning and
[54:10] have come down to deliver them and now
[54:13] come I will send thee to Egypt this
[54:17] little scripture right here is a real
[54:20] blessing to me
[54:23] it shows me that the tender loving hand
[54:26] of Jehovah
[54:27] he's got that ear
[54:29] down to his people
[54:31] and when they start crying out to God
[54:36] that's when God listens he didn't say
[54:39] this was prophesied to come that's why I
[54:41] did it he didn't say that this this was
[54:43] the way I was going to do it in the
[54:44] first place or anything like that it was
[54:47] but he said this I heard my people how
[54:52] beautiful how sweet our Lord is
[54:59] where am I at 30
[55:01] 35.
[55:06] and this Moses whom they refused saying
[55:10] who made thee a ruler and a judge
[55:12] the same did God send to be a ruler and
[55:15] a deliverer by the hand of the Angel
[55:18] which appeared to him in the bush
[55:21] he's saying here that it didn't matter
[55:23] if they rejected him
[55:25] God still made him the ruler and the
[55:28] deliverer it didn't matter how they
[55:29] voted it didn't matter how that what
[55:31] they thought it didn't matter if they
[55:33] didn't like Moses god The Sovereign God
[55:36] who does things the way he wants to do
[55:38] them he made Moses the man
[55:42] and he brought them out
[55:44] and after that he showed wonders and
[55:47] signs in the land of Egypt and in the
[55:49] Red Sea and in the wilderness 40 years
[55:56] so this
[55:58] is that Moses which said unto the
[56:01] children of Israel a prophet
[56:04] shall the Lord your God raise up unto
[56:08] you of your brethren like unto me
[56:12] him shall ye hear this is key
[56:16] very very important because here we have
[56:20] again Stephen is showing his knowledge
[56:22] of the scriptures he's going all the way
[56:25] back to the book of Deuteronomy
[56:28] and he's he's quoting this book I think
[56:30] we should read it Deuteronomy
[56:32] um
[56:34] 1815. brother I think that I don't know
[56:37] if I gave you that scripture or not
[56:38] Deuteronomy 18 15.
[56:41] yeah right there it says this
[56:44] and the Lord thy God
[56:46] this is Moses speaking
[56:48] and the Lord thy God will raise up into
[56:50] thee a prophet
[56:52] from the midst of the of thy Brethren
[56:56] like unto me
[56:58] unto him ye shall hearken
[57:01] according to all that thou desirest of
[57:04] the Lord thy God in Horeb in the day of
[57:07] the assembly saying let me not hear
[57:10] again
[57:12] the voice of the Lord my God neither let
[57:15] me
[57:16] see this great fire anymore that I die
[57:19] not
[57:20] do you remember that story they got
[57:23] scared and they said Lord don't don't
[57:25] you don't speak let Moses speak
[57:30] and the Lord said unto me
[57:32] they have well spoken
[57:35] that which they have spoken I will raise
[57:37] up a prophet
[57:39] from among their Brethren like unto thee
[57:43] and will put my words in his mouth and
[57:46] he shall speak unto them all that I
[57:49] shall command him
[57:52] and it shall come to pass that whosoever
[57:55] will not hearken unto my words which he
[57:57] shall speak in my name I will require it
[58:01] of him
[58:03] so he's speaking of that scripture he's
[58:05] referencing as he's as he's preaching
[58:07] here he's referencing that scripture
[58:09] that that Moses had prophesied there and
[58:13] they were aware
[58:15] these Jews these studies learned
[58:19] individuals they were aware of that
[58:21] prophecy in fact they were so aware that
[58:25] when John the Baptist came
[58:28] they asked him they said hey John they
[58:30] said uh well they probably didn't say
[58:32] hey John they probably said John
[58:35] are you the Messiah
[58:38] and John said no
[58:40] and then they say this
[58:43] they said are you that prophet
[58:49] you know the scripture I'm talking about
[58:50] John
[58:51] are you that Prophet this is the
[58:55] scripture they're referring to
[58:57] because they knew that this man was
[58:59] going to come and they knew that this
[59:01] was going to be the Messiah they had
[59:03] tied that two together and here
[59:06] Stephen is bringing this out
[59:14] this is he
[59:17] that was in the church in the wilderness
[59:19] with the angel which spake to him in
[59:22] Mount Sinai and with our fathers who
[59:25] received the Lively oracles to give unto
[59:27] us
[59:28] to whom our fathers would not obey but
[59:32] thrust him from them
[59:34] and in their own Hearts turn back again
[59:37] into Egypt you remember I believe the
[59:39] Bible says murmuring is the word do you
[59:42] remember when they were going around for
[59:43] that 40 years and they're complaining
[59:45] and moaning and groaning and bellyaching
[59:47] and and doing all that saying oh why'd
[59:49] you bring us out here Moses you're just
[59:51] you brought us out here to kill us and
[59:53] we're sick of this manna that God is
[59:55] sending from Heaven every day you know
[59:58] we're sick of these Quail that come out
[59:59] that we asked for me we're just tired of
[1:00:02] this you know the story
[1:00:05] and
[1:00:06] here we are
[1:00:09] that they wanted to go back into Egypt
[1:00:13] and I can imagine probably right around
[1:00:16] this time the blood pressure
[1:00:18] starts to rise
[1:00:20] in these these priests because now I
[1:00:23] think that they might know which
[1:00:24] direction Stephen's going here
[1:00:27] sing unto Aaron
[1:00:34] hold on let me go back uh I don't want
[1:00:36] to miss this verse number 39 to whom our
[1:00:38] fathers would not obey but thrust him
[1:00:41] from them and in their own Hearts turn
[1:00:44] back again to Egypt
[1:00:48] now
[1:00:49] this this is this is very very important
[1:00:52] saying unto Aaron make us Gods to go
[1:00:55] before us for as for this Moses which
[1:00:59] brought us out of the land of Egypt we
[1:01:01] ought not what has become of him now you
[1:01:04] know this story so Moses goes up on the
[1:01:07] mountain
[1:01:08] and he doesn't come down for do you know
[1:01:10] how long
[1:01:12] very important number
[1:01:16] he's up there on the mountain for 40
[1:01:18] days
[1:01:19] so they're they're saying oh he's gone
[1:01:22] he's dead or whatever so build us this
[1:01:23] calf and then they they just fall into
[1:01:25] sin
[1:01:27] and we look and look at that 40 days we
[1:01:31] go back to the very beginning of Jesus's
[1:01:35] Ministry
[1:01:36] so Moses is up there with God on the
[1:01:39] mountain
[1:01:40] and here comes Jesus
[1:01:43] I don't know what what is it let's see
[1:01:45] it's a
[1:01:46] about 1400 1500 years later
[1:01:50] Here Comes Jesus
[1:01:52] and he his ministry starts and he goes
[1:01:56] up into the mountain
[1:01:57] into the desert for how long
[1:02:00] 40 days
[1:02:02] very very good type and look at Stephen
[1:02:05] I guarantee you he knew this
[1:02:08] and here he is relating this this is so
[1:02:10] beautiful this is just this is so
[1:02:13] exciting
[1:02:14] saying unto Aaron
[1:02:16] make us uh make us Gods because we don't
[1:02:19] know where he went and they made a calf
[1:02:21] in those days and offered a sacrifice
[1:02:23] under the idol and rejoiced in the works
[1:02:26] of their own hands then God turned and
[1:02:28] gave them up to worship the host of
[1:02:30] Heaven as it is written in the book of
[1:02:32] the prophets oh ye House of Israel you
[1:02:35] have offered to me slain beasts and
[1:02:38] sacrifices by the space of 40 years in
[1:02:40] the wilderness
[1:02:43] yea ye took up the Tabernacle of moloch
[1:02:46] and the star of your God rinfin
[1:02:49] figures which ye made to worship them
[1:02:51] and I will carry you away
[1:02:54] Beyond Babylon
[1:02:57] now what he's doing
[1:02:59] we don't have time but he's referencing
[1:03:01] a prophecy by the by the prophet Amos
[1:03:07] our fathers had the Tabernacle of
[1:03:10] witness in the wilderness as he had
[1:03:11] appointed speaking unto Moses that he
[1:03:14] should make it according to the fashion
[1:03:16] that he had seen
[1:03:18] which our fathers which which
[1:03:22] but our fathers that came after brought
[1:03:25] in with Jesus in the possession of the
[1:03:28] Gentiles whom God drave out before the
[1:03:31] face of our fathers unto the days of
[1:03:34] David
[1:03:36] who found favor before God and desired
[1:03:40] to find a tabernacle for the god of
[1:03:43] Jacob
[1:03:44] but Solomon built him a house
[1:03:47] now
[1:03:49] he had talked about
[1:03:51] Stephen had talked about Moses
[1:03:54] and he talked about the law
[1:03:55] now remember they he said they blaspheme
[1:03:58] he also blasphemed the temple
[1:04:01] now
[1:04:02] this
[1:04:04] I mean incredible minister
[1:04:07] this young man named Stephen now he's
[1:04:09] going to bring in the temple into this
[1:04:12] now you want to see their blood pressure
[1:04:14] really start to go up
[1:04:16] but Solomon built him a house
[1:04:20] how be it
[1:04:22] however
[1:04:24] the most high dwelleth not in temples
[1:04:27] made with hands as saith the prophet
[1:04:32] now remember brother Lau they think a
[1:04:34] lot of that Temple especially those guys
[1:04:36] called the Sadducees it's everything to
[1:04:39] them and here this man is actually
[1:04:43] quoting
[1:04:45] a prophet before him quoting I believe
[1:04:47] Solomon and he's saying listen he's
[1:04:50] saying that this Temple that you have
[1:04:53] God doesn't dwell in there
[1:04:56] now I know that that he's done all this
[1:04:58] and and he's been there but he said that
[1:05:01] he doesn't dwell in a temple made with
[1:05:03] hands I think we should read it
[1:05:06] first first Kings chapter eight
[1:05:09] verse 27.
[1:05:13] this is great
[1:05:18] this is Solomon
[1:05:20] dedicating the temple
[1:05:22] First Kings chapter 8 verse 27.
[1:05:27] but will God
[1:05:29] indeed dwell on Earth
[1:05:32] behold the heaven
[1:05:35] and Heaven of Heavens cannot contain
[1:05:38] thee
[1:05:39] how much less this house that I have
[1:05:43] builded speaking of the Temple
[1:05:46] so here is Stephen and he's taking this
[1:05:50] scripture and he's saying listen you are
[1:05:53] things so much of this Temple
[1:05:57] but the Bible says that he doesn't even
[1:06:00] dwell
[1:06:01] in a temple or this building made with
[1:06:03] hands
[1:06:07] Heaven is my throne
[1:06:09] and Earth is my footstool what house
[1:06:12] will ye build me saith the Lord or what
[1:06:15] is the place of my rest quoting another
[1:06:18] Prophet quoting Isaiah now 66 almost
[1:06:22] verbatim right there we don't have to go
[1:06:24] back and read it here he is quoting now
[1:06:26] Isaiah Heaven is my throne and Earth is
[1:06:28] my footstool what house will you build
[1:06:30] me saith the Lord or what is the place
[1:06:32] of my rest
[1:06:33] hath not my hand made all these things
[1:06:39] powerful Stephen is saying listen I
[1:06:43] brought you through history
[1:06:45] I've shown you no we're not blaspheming
[1:06:48] Moses we love Moses Moses was a prophet
[1:06:52] and and you look at this Temple this
[1:06:56] Temple ain't all that
[1:06:57] you know what the right Temple is is
[1:06:59] this Temple and he's he's going there
[1:07:01] and he's he's laying these things dude
[1:07:03] all the way up to Abraham
[1:07:06] and he even mentioned circumcision at
[1:07:08] the beginning he says this was a
[1:07:09] covenant with God and he's hitting all
[1:07:12] of the main points with these with these
[1:07:15] Pharisees and Sadducees
[1:07:18] and then
[1:07:20] Stephen
[1:07:21] shifts from first gear
[1:07:24] to fifth
[1:07:27] he hits warp speed you know how you know
[1:07:29] in Star Trek when when you know they're
[1:07:32] going along and and it does the thing in
[1:07:35] In Our Star Wars or whatever and all the
[1:07:36] stars just and he's just cooking down
[1:07:39] through there that's what Stephen does
[1:07:41] he said he goes from he goes from 25
[1:07:45] miles an hour to 150.
[1:07:48] and he says this here's the blood
[1:07:51] pressure is gonna go up
[1:07:54] he just laid it out he just laid that
[1:07:57] foundation and he did it better than any
[1:08:00] of them could have done it a masterful
[1:08:03] sermon and he says this in verse 51 he
[1:08:06] says you stiff-neck
[1:08:09] he's quoting Moses
[1:08:11] again
[1:08:13] he says you stiff-neck and uncircumcised
[1:08:18] in the heart and ears
[1:08:20] you do always resist resist the Holy
[1:08:23] Ghost as your fathers did so did so do
[1:08:27] ye
[1:08:29] stiff neck as I said was a term that
[1:08:31] Moses used in Exodus 32 and 33 and many
[1:08:35] other places Moses and God called the
[1:08:38] people stiff neck they knew it
[1:08:41] these Pharisees and Sadducees like what
[1:08:46] me stiff neck
[1:08:49] this Deacon Preacher Man he knows the
[1:08:52] word
[1:08:53] and he's quoting and now he's quoting
[1:08:54] with zeal
[1:08:56] and he's calling them uncircumcised
[1:08:59] how important brother Paul was
[1:09:02] circumcision
[1:09:03] to these Jews
[1:09:05] all the way back to Abraham and they
[1:09:08] said that is what separates us
[1:09:11] from the world is that we're circumcised
[1:09:14] that's what makes us better even so you
[1:09:16] had to if you wanted to marry into the
[1:09:18] into the Jewish Family you had to get
[1:09:20] circumcised you know that this is what
[1:09:23] this is what means everything to us and
[1:09:27] now you're saying I'm uncircumcised in
[1:09:29] the heart
[1:09:30] how dare you
[1:09:32] it's coming up
[1:09:34] and he says you resist the Holy Ghost as
[1:09:37] your fathers did
[1:09:39] the tradition of the elders was in place
[1:09:42] for thousands of years and you're
[1:09:44] telling us that our fathers
[1:09:48] the oral tradition
[1:09:50] allow all of these Great Men of God that
[1:09:54] have come down that that we read
[1:09:57] everything that they've written and we
[1:09:59] study so hard you're saying
[1:10:03] that they
[1:10:05] resisted the Holy Ghost
[1:10:08] coming up
[1:10:10] he continues which of the prophets have
[1:10:15] your fathers not persecuted
[1:10:17] and they have slain them which showed
[1:10:21] before of the coming of the just one of
[1:10:24] whom you have been now the betrayers and
[1:10:28] murders that just one he capitalizes
[1:10:31] here our brother Luke who wrote this he
[1:10:34] capitalizes it it's referring to the
[1:10:36] Lord Jesus and they knew it was
[1:10:38] referring to the Lord Jesus and they
[1:10:40] also knew what he was referring to you
[1:10:42] were against Moses
[1:10:45] you know you have in there Dayton and
[1:10:47] Cora and all these ones that withstood
[1:10:49] Moses you sought Isaiah in half
[1:10:53] you killed him
[1:10:56] you threw Jeremiah in prison you stoned
[1:10:59] Zachariah
[1:11:00] here's the their this blood pressure is
[1:11:03] running and there they know what
[1:11:06] happened in the past and they're saying
[1:11:08] and you Stephen you little squirt you're
[1:11:13] saying that we did the same to this man
[1:11:16] Jesus and you're you're comparing that
[1:11:18] to Zachariah being stoned you're
[1:11:21] comparing that to withstanding Moses
[1:11:25] he continues
[1:11:27] I am
[1:11:29] I love this this this
[1:11:33] sermon is so beautiful
[1:11:36] who have received the law by the
[1:11:38] dispensations of angels
[1:11:41] sorry my phone is talking to me who
[1:11:45] have received the law by the disposition
[1:11:47] of angels and have not kept it when they
[1:11:50] heard these things
[1:11:51] these people that he's preaching to
[1:11:54] when they heard these things they were
[1:11:56] cut to the heart
[1:11:58] and they gnashed on him with their teeth
[1:12:02] they were cut to the heart same I
[1:12:05] believe it's the same words
[1:12:09] as
[1:12:10] when they when they were they were torn
[1:12:14] in the heart something happened in their
[1:12:16] heart they were they were they became
[1:12:18] emotional about this and I believe it's
[1:12:21] the the same Greek word that I believe
[1:12:24] is is in the book of Acts chapter 2 when
[1:12:27] it says they were pricked in the heart
[1:12:30] these other ones that were pricked in
[1:12:31] the heart they were condemned it really
[1:12:34] meant something these over here they
[1:12:36] were offended
[1:12:38] how can you say this they were angry
[1:12:42] they were grinding their teeth
[1:12:45] upset
[1:12:49] but he being full of the Holy Ghost
[1:12:51] looked up steadfastly into heaven and
[1:12:54] saw the glory of God and Jesus standing
[1:12:58] on the right hand of God
[1:13:02] this as I was reading and studying this
[1:13:05] I got I got blessed in this whole
[1:13:08] chapter but I got I got blessed right
[1:13:11] here
[1:13:12] because in Colossians and I think in in
[1:13:14] at least one other place
[1:13:16] it says
[1:13:18] that Jesus
[1:13:20] is sitting
[1:13:23] at the right hand of God
[1:13:27] and here it says that he's standing
[1:13:33] I wonder
[1:13:35] I wonder if he
[1:13:40] That's my boy
[1:13:42] foreign
[1:13:44] do it up
[1:13:46] that's my son this man Stephen I Love
[1:13:51] Thinking of Jesus standing up
[1:13:55] that's him
[1:13:57] now look what happens
[1:14:04] oh
[1:14:07] that thought
[1:14:09] friends that thought I gotta stop for a
[1:14:12] second makes me want to cry
[1:14:15] thinking of Jesus sitting at the right
[1:14:17] hand of God
[1:14:19] that he might stand up
[1:14:22] for this young man Stephen
[1:14:26] welcome them
[1:14:28] into the kingdom
[1:14:35] Stephen looks up
[1:14:38] and said
[1:14:40] behold I see the heavens open
[1:14:43] and the son of man
[1:14:45] standing at the right hand of God
[1:14:49] and they cried with a loud voice and
[1:14:51] they stopped their ears and they ran
[1:14:53] upon him with one Accord
[1:14:56] look at the Spirit of Satan here
[1:14:58] hatred and vitriol and Malice and
[1:15:01] violence
[1:15:03] all present in those men
[1:15:06] and cast him out of the city and stoned
[1:15:09] him
[1:15:10] and the witnesses laid down their
[1:15:13] clothes at a young man's feet
[1:15:16] whose name was Saul
[1:15:18] that's the other young man that I
[1:15:20] mentioned earlier
[1:15:24] this is the first time we see him
[1:15:27] and he was consenting to the death
[1:15:31] of this other young man named Stephen
[1:15:34] and they stoned Stephen
[1:15:36] and calling upon God
[1:15:39] and saying
[1:15:40] Lord Jesus receive my spirit
[1:15:44] look at the Spirit that's in Stephen
[1:15:48] The Same Spirit that was in the Lord
[1:15:51] Jesus when he said in Luke chapter 23
[1:15:53] verse 46 he said father into thy hands I
[1:15:57] commend my spirit
[1:16:01] Stephen says here Lord Jesus
[1:16:04] receive my spirit
[1:16:06] look at the godhead
[1:16:09] look at the godhead sow
[1:16:12] when Jesus said father
[1:16:16] and Stephen said Jesus
[1:16:19] which one's God
[1:16:23] ah there's a saying
[1:16:29] Stephen says Lord Jesus receive my
[1:16:30] spirit
[1:16:32] so who is receiving that spirit
[1:16:37] of this brother Stephen
[1:16:41] he looked up
[1:16:42] Lord
[1:16:44] receive me the musicians if you'd come
[1:16:46] and I'll close
[1:16:51] and here is Stephen
[1:16:53] and he kneeled down
[1:16:56] and he cried with a loud voice
[1:16:59] saying this
[1:17:02] Lord look at the Spirit that's in him
[1:17:06] this is the same Spirit of this man that
[1:17:09] was just crucified on that cross
[1:17:13] remember they had received this Holy
[1:17:15] Spirit at the day of Pentecost and this
[1:17:17] man Stephen we see that he was filled
[1:17:19] with the spirit as you said
[1:17:22] he was a great young man
[1:17:27] and he kneeled down
[1:17:31] and he cried with a loud voice
[1:17:35] Lord
[1:17:37] lay not this sin to their charge
[1:17:43] murdering him
[1:17:45] in the very Act
[1:17:48] of dying
[1:17:49] in the very Act of losing his life
[1:17:54] Jesus was in the very Act
[1:17:58] of the breath going out of him the life
[1:18:00] going out of him had his had his hands
[1:18:04] nailed to the cross Jesus said does it
[1:18:07] sound
[1:18:08] similar Jesus said father forgive them
[1:18:12] for they know not what they do
[1:18:17] Stephen says Lord lay not the sin to
[1:18:19] their charge
[1:18:21] and when he had said this
[1:18:24] he fell asleep
[1:18:26] how beautiful
[1:18:27] what a testimony brother Aaron if you
[1:18:30] could come and Lead songs what a
[1:18:32] testimony I'll tell you what I've been
[1:18:35] studying this this chapter
[1:18:39] thinking of this man Stephen
[1:18:42] the boldness remember brother Lyle they
[1:18:45] prayed they prayed for boldness
[1:18:48] and here it is
[1:18:51] right here
[1:18:53] brother Stephen
[1:18:55] he had that boldness
[1:18:57] went up before them preached this
[1:19:01] masterful wonderful sermon
[1:19:04] [Music]
[1:19:07] brought it all the way back to Abraham
[1:19:09] and Moses Joseph and all of them and he
[1:19:14] showed him he said look this is what
[1:19:17] happened in history
[1:19:19] [Music]
[1:19:20] all the way through
[1:19:22] and you've done it every single time
[1:19:25] just like your fathers have
[1:19:29] they
[1:19:31] hated him
[1:19:32] for telling the truth
[1:19:35] and yet Stephen
[1:19:37] I mean it wasn't a pushover
[1:19:40] he said you uncircumcised in our nearest
[1:19:43] he wasn't he wasn't gonna roll over and
[1:19:47] just take it he was going to give him a
[1:19:48] chance
[1:19:50] have her right there
[1:19:53] right there but then when it came in the
[1:19:54] end
[1:19:55] everything our brother Stephen said was
[1:19:58] absolutely the word of God as as it's
[1:20:01] recorded here in the book of Acts
[1:20:03] and when it came right down to it I love
[1:20:07] it
[1:20:09] he said father
[1:20:10] [Music]
[1:20:12] don't lay this into their charge
[1:20:15] showing the very Spirit of Christ
[1:20:17] amen
[1:20:19] don't you love the book of Acts
[1:20:22] it just just that one chapter gave us
[1:20:25] the whole plan salvation gave us a
[1:20:28] perfect history of the Bible and these
[1:20:30] little types if you would just read it
[1:20:32] over
[1:20:33] you tell that's nice history lesson whoa
