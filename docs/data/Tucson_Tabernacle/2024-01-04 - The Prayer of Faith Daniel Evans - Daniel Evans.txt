says or Psalm 47 says oh clap your hands all ye people shout unto God with a voice of Triumph so it's okay to get a little bit loud every once in a while Tucson Tabernacle it's okay to clap your hands it's okay to say Amen it's okay to praise it says right here in the book that it's okay I um I'm thankful and I think that there's already a theme started for this service and there's already a spirit and and what the what the Lord has already done so far and when brother Jordan when he read The Lord's Prayer at the beginning I was this morning I was up early and I was going through my sermon and I saying it's too long I got I got too many notes I have too many scriptures and um one the ones that I took out as I really wanted to say the Lord's Prayer with the people but God wanted it said and I'm so thankful I'm so thankful that that he knows our heart and he knows that even though that we might make a mistake and we might fall short he knows that he knows our hearts are right and he knows his will and he knows what's best for us is his will so he's going to have his will done with a willing heart so I could take that out and he says no I want my prayer read I want it said among the people so I'm gonna have brother Jordan do it what a what a what a blessing he's he's just he's so good and brother Kevin and what he was saying when he he was praying it just it just blessed my heart it blessed my heart to to see that we have these prayer requests and and I look and there's some very difficult things pancreatic cancer I believe was one of them that was said it's it's a a terminal disease and I was praying with the congregation about these things and how blessed we are to be able to pray and God takes these trials in his kindness and he puts them Upon Our upon us so that we would go back to him I think that when we stray is when things are going well when things are going good and and and we don't have any problems in our lives and there's no hardships that's when things it seems like that's when we stray from God and we don't pray as much we don't read his Bible as much we don't wen't constantly talking to him when things are going easy and that's the that's the age that we live in it's an easy age we have air conditioning we have vehicles we have all of these things that make life so easy on us and it makes us to where we don't ask God we don't have a need this Leo toan age it says they have need of nothing and that's where we live today and it's a blessing to have a need it's a blessing to go before the Lord and the Lord will send those hardships he'll allow those hardships to come so we will reach out to him because he knows that we will do best his children are the best when they are fellowshipping with God we have communion service tonight and it's not only fellowship with our lord Jesus as it was in John when when Jesus broke the bread and he said this is my body and took the wine and he says this is my blood do this in remembrance of me it wasn't just fellowship with Jesus it was also fellowship with the disciples it was fellowship with each other and that's what we get to do is tonight we'll get to break break that bread and partake of the ordinances that God set before us with each other and it's very very important that we are with each other and with loved ones and we have that that fellowship and that communion and that Unity how how important that is it seems like when people when they get closest to God is when they reach Rock Bottom it's when they're forced to ask God for help and we don't realize that these tragedies become a blessing couple thousand years of three three 3,500 years ago whatever it was there was a man named amram that he was in bondage the King was killing the children amram got on his knees and he cried out to God God said I've heard the cries of my people and he sent a deliverer named Moses we started in the Book of Judges this week and we see that when the people when things get easy they start to sin and they lose track of what God is and they fall into idolatry and then they fall into sin and then the enemy comes in and takes over their lives and then they cry out to God and yet God still hears them even in the worst of the sins how precious is our Lord that he'll even listen to us even when we're in our sins he sends when he he'll send anneal and Gideon and Samson and and Deborah and all of these different judges to help bring the people out and then we go right back into it when things get easy he sent Nebuchadnezzar the king to pull these Hebrews out of Jerusalem and out of their Homeland because they stopped calling upon God he he brought them out and he brought them into into bondage and then there was a man named Daniel that prayed three times a day God heard his prayer same thing with Herod we see Herod was there and he started killing the children and and persecuting the people the Bible says that a cry went out of Jacob a cry went out of Israel and God heard that cry no matter how bad that they were he promised in a time to come that he's going to send a tribulation upon the Earth he's going to send suffering and we always think about that suffering as something as a as the wrath of God but do you think maybe it could be the kindness of God that God will send suffering and tribulation and problems because he loves us because he loves the world he so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son Jesus Christ and these trials and tribulations and even the tribulation the Great Tribulation it is to come it's out of the kindness of God it's not it's not out of the harshness or the Wrath the Bible says that God is love so everything that God does he does through love I've been as as many of you have been in the lowest point of my life is when it felt like God spoke to me the most it's when we get all worked up and there's all this this problems and we get all confused and we don't know what we're going to do and and then we cry out to God and he listens I remember the hardest times of my life I didn't know it seemed like everything had failed in my life everything from from from my career to to my church to even my very it seemed like my religion my thoughts on God were even failing and I didn't know what to do and I was out in the mountains and I looked up at night and I saw all the stars in the sky it wasn't a moon I saw all the different colors in the Milky Way and it went all the way down the stars went down to the Horizon just everywhere and I looked up and I said God I'm worried about all this I said' I'm not even really a Christian I said I I'm a big fake is what I am to think that you created all of this and I doubt you I doubt that you know me I doubt that you can't take care of these little problems that I have and I thought comes to me that scripture we just read God says be still and know that I'm God he said just trust me and that's what I want us to do and that's what I want to talk about today is prayer of faith is praying to God and then having confidence that he is able to do it there's a testimony when Jesus was here Matthew chapter 28 I mean I'm sorry Matthew chapter 9: 28 there was these Blind Men and they had heard that there was this man this prophet of God that could heal the sick these two men were blind they came to Jesus and they said this they said and when he was come into the house the Blind Men came to him and Jesus said unto them believe ye that I am able to do this these men were crying out in verse 27 it says the two Blind Men following following him cried out saying thou son of David have mercy on us and then Jesus responds says do you believe I'm able to do this what a question I just I I love that because we get so caught up in our ways of thinking that we don't think is he even able to do this was he able to create all the heavens and the earth I stood under those stars and and I looked at those stars and I see everything moving in Perfect Harmony and and and no star is is any greater really than any other some get some are brighter C certain times of year then they fade out and everything is just moving in perfect time Harmony and then this same God that put everything there came to Earth and he touched their eyes and saying according to your faith be it unto you and their eyes were open and Jesus straightly charged them saying that see that they'll tell see that no man know it God has a way of doing things and it's his way it's not our way it doesn't matter if it makes sense to us we always want to put him in a box and sayl you have to do it my way you have to do it according to the way I think but if we would just one time step back and look at all of he has created and all that he's done and just have faith in him then we would do well Psalm 120 says this in my distress I Cried unto the Lord and he heard me what a statement in my distress I Cried unto the Lord and he heard me deliver my soul oh Lord from lying lips and from a deceitful tongue it wasn't just death that the psalmist was facing there it was people same thing that we suffer with sometimes people talking about us or little infighting or little problems that we get among a family or among friends or or among gossiping or or whatever it was that that he's saying here deliver my soul from lying lips and a deceitful tongue it wasn't Goliath this time it was just a little thing that just got him worked up and he cried to the Lord and he heard him how precious is our Lord how how beautiful are as words and he says be still and know that I'm God I was thinking this morning the sun it it was it was cloudy but it it started to to get light and what a great miracle that happens every day as this sun comes up we know it's going to happen we have faith that it's going to happen it comes up the Bible says Be Still did you ever hear the sunrise all the power that's associated with all of gravity and all of the universe moving around and that great power and yet it's quiet and at night do you hear the Stars moving across the sky no just be still know that I'm God have faith in him James chapter 5 let's get into our scriptures here James says this verse 13 he says is any among you afflicted let him pray is any marry let him sing Psalms he says here whether what he's saying is whether you're suffering or you're blessed cry out to God in both situations is any Afflicted cry to God is any marry still cry out to him give him Praises for the good things always give him Praises for the good things and then it's okay to cry out to him for the things that we need is any sick among you let him call for the Elders of the church and let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord and the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the Lord shall raise him up and if you have committed sins they shall be forgiven him look it not every not every prayer accomplishes what we think it's going to C accomplish look at all that the prayer does in just this scripture not only does it save the sick but it also redeems The Sinner what a what a much greater thing than praying for the sick confess your faults one to another and pray one for another that you may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much look at the kindness of God towards his children he wants us confessing that we were wrong especially to the one that we wronged especially to to the one that we're arguing with confess your faults one to another and then pray for one another you see how the love just comes in it's not just friends let me let me say that too it's not just the one that you are praying for that's healed you can receive your healing by praying for someone else it says right here confess your faults one to another and pray one for another that you may be healed so if I'm praying for this person I'm asking the Lord Lord have mercy for this person suffering with cancer or for my daughter or for my son and then all of a sudden I get healed right there pray one for another that you may be healed not just the one you're praying for then he goes on thinking about talking about this man named Elijah it says Elias Elias is the Greek form of the the Hebrew name Elijah it's the same name he starts talking about this great man Elijah and this man Elijah we know the story one of the greatest prophets that's in the whole Bible he he goes and at the end of his life he walks up to this River Jordan River and it's swollen it's it's spread across and he takes his coat off he smacks the river the River dries up he walks across the river and then God sends down a chariot of fire and Horses of fire come down and pick this man up and take him up into heaven great man right one of the greatest stories that's in the whole book is that story it symbolizes the Rapture for the bride and many many other things and then Jame James says this he says Elias that same man was subject to like passions as we are he was a man he had problems he had weaknesses but there was something that set him apart what was it that Set This Man Apart and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain and it rained not on the Earth by the span of three years and six months he's he's referring back to win this man Elijah he went to Ahab because there was so much sin in the country he went to Ahab and he said listen it's not going to rain again until I call for it because of your wickedness and that of his wife Jezebel and then imagine three and a half years without rain they didn't have wells that they could stick a pump down and turn a diesel engine on and pump the water out they were dependent on rain for their crops and for drinking and everything else the rivers dried up The Creeks dried up everything dried up there was a famine in the land and then Elijah comes back and he prays again and then God sends the rain that's that's who we were talking about this man prayed and he was a man subject to like passions as we are he prayed earnestly that it might not rain and then it rain not on the Earth by the space of three years and six months and he prayed again and Heaven gave rain and the Earth brought forth her fruit and he's saying that he was like us so how much are we living below our expectations of God Elijah was praying God closed the heavens one man praying and God would do all this what if two men were praying what if two of us really got down and prayed what if three four five this was just one man was praying what about us what would God do if we really got sincere and went before God and prayed like Elijah prayed James continues on he says Brethren if it any of you do he from the truth and one convert him let him know that he which converte The Sinner from error of his way shall save a soul from death and shall hide a multitude of sins so he goes straight from Elijah praying and closing up the heavens and says Hey listen we're like him he had problems he wasn't perfect he had weaknesses we're like him and then he talks about a greater miracle that can happen what's greater than than being able to control the weather and doing all that it's when a sinner comes before the Lord when a sinner comes and repents and gives that soul to the Lord Jesus and that soul is saved how much more is that one Soul worth than all the worlds I was talking about earlier how much more is that one Soul than the land of Israel it's worth 10,000 worlds it's worth far more than we can even imagine One Soul let him know that he which converteth The Sinner from eror from the error of his way shall save a soul from death and shall hide a multitude of sins how much more important is that Soul how much more important is the work that we're doing here at the Tucson Tabernacle and trying to bring these souls in trying to get these souls to the Lord Jesus it's far greater than all the Miracles that we could ever imagine parting the Red Sea and all that but what good does parting the Red Sea do if a soul doesn't get saved doesn't do any good getting that soul to Christ through prayer and then through witness and most importantly through love is greater than anything Elijah did in all of his life we have the opportunity Unity to bring someone to the one who not only created the heavens and the Earth but that can also be approached and touched through a sincere heart and a sincere prayer I see so much so-called Holiness outward prayers and everyone's needs attention everyone wants to be today it's it's our society everybody wants to be on Instagram with ridiculous pictures of themselves with all the eyelashes and all the and all the makeup and all that they do and then the moms want to be on on Facebook and tell everyone how good of a mother they are lifting themselves up and then the men want attention and respect from the people they want to be in the pull pit or or they they want to be the the richest person or they want the respect of the people and they want as the Bible says they want to sit in the high places in church and everyone know that they're important but who is the person that is the one that is making the most difference I was talking about the world that we live in today and and all the internet and all all the apps and all all the stuff and and all of the the celebrity and all of this but who is making the most difference it is is it that Elijah that was on his knees praying asking the Lord cry crying out to the Lord or is it the person that's always promoting them and trying to get up in front of everybody and trying to trying to to make themel something it's that person that prays that's the person that makes a difference one day we're going to see that we're one day we're going to see how important those prayers are to God are to our families are to this whole world as I said before that that person on their knees crying out to God it's like the sun rising up there's no great noise there's no great power but it just happens and it happens because that prayer of faith was prayed Matthew chapter 6 talks about when when Jesus was telling us Matthew 6:6 Jesus is instructing he says but you but thou when thou prayest enter into the closet and when thou has shut thy door pray to thy father which is in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly but when you pray use not vain repetition as the Heathen do for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking be not therefore like unto them for your father knoweth what things you have need of before you ask them what a comfort what a comfort that that God knows before we get on our knees he requires that we do pray that is one of his requirements that we get on our knees or we however we're we stand and pray as the Bible says sometimes but whatever it is when we go before the Lord he requires that but the thing is he already knows what we have need of beautiful scripture in Romans chapter 8 verse 25 when we are praying remember it's not us that's praying if we are truly in the spirit of God something else is speaking for us I'm sure many of us have been there many of us that pray you'll be on your knees and you'll be praying and you'll say something like what was that why did I say that maybe that was the Holy Spirit speaking through you and it had to be spoken out then the father would hear it and then answer the prayer verse 25 says this but if we hope for that which we see for that we see not then we do with patience wait for it so if we're truly sincere then we'll have patience to wait for what was given likewise the spirit also helpeth with our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself make it intercessions for us with groanings which cannot be uttered there are times we get so caught up we get so caught up in the spirit and then it becomes sometimes it's even an unknown tongue that will come out in worship and In Praise in that in that quiet time just us and God and there we are and we're praying and all of a sudden things will be coming out Lord I don't even know what that is that's a tongue that I don't even understand and it's coming out of my mouth these unknown tongues will go up before God as a sweet smelling Savor as praise as prayer and then other times it may be that we'll say something that it was him that said it and we think like Lord that's the farthest thing from me but it needed to be said and he that searches the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the Saints according to the will of God so the Creator knows the deepest desires of the hearts and he knows that his will is better for his children than our own will is and that same Spirit friends that same Spirit if we read in the Book of Genesis that same spirit that right at the beginning it talks about moved across cross the face of the deep there was nothing there and created the heavens and the Earth and separated the light from the darkness and and the water from the land and did all of those things that same spirit that was there at the beginning is that same spirit that can come into us if we are truly sincere and we are truly praying in God's spirit it will come into us and that same spirit that moved across the face of the deep will speak out words that we could have never even uttered with our own lips that we would have no idea maybe what they mean or or what we would even say and it comes out and it speaks God's word and then the sick are healed then the Lost are brought forward and brought to the Lord and how we should have faith brothers and sisters in our own prayers there's a story that really blesses me it's a story about this young man he's um he was he was a son of a minister in fact his lineage went way back as far as he could really trace it his dad was a preacher his his grandfather was AE preacher all the way back his family were always ministers really really good ones he had a very good lineage and he was a young man and he was growing up and he was going to follow in his Father's Footsteps and he was going to be a minister he was going to be a pastor so he found a young lady that fine sweet girl her dad was a preacher and her grandfather was a preacher so she understood how this ministry how important it was so they end up getting married her name was Elizabeth so they end up getting married and going into the ministry this young man his name was is they called him Zach this young man he and his wife grew in the spirit and serving God and after a while as as it is with with most young couples they wanted to have a child and they were trying to have children and it never it never worked so years passed and Zach and Elizabeth continue on he kept preaching the gospel and praying that the Lord would give them a child and the child never came and Zach went in before the Lord probably in the closet as as I was just quoting he went in there and he said Lord give us a son give us a CH give us children that we might grow in the Lord and that we might raise them and the and Elizabeth was so sad and heartbroken that she couldn't have a child so time went on maybe they they were in their mid 20s when they prayed this time went on they got to be 30 35 40 no children nothing there continued on they continued Zechariah keep kept preaching the gospel doing his best 40 years old 45 years old 50 years old 55 60 no more children they were past they're beyond that but God had remembered that prayer and that was not Zachariah praying that was the Holy Spirit speaking through Zachariah when he asked for that 55 years old 60s years old the thought of that was long since past then Zachariah as he was doing his duties as the priest he went in to the temple he had his incense and the man a man came before him and not just any man this is the same man an angel that went to the Prophet Daniel and announced Daniel that this this is going to be this many days this many weeks until the coming Messiah this is the same Angel messenger the most well-known angel in the whole Bible and he came to a little while later he came to this young girl named Mary and announced that you are going to have a son and he is going to be the Messiah the same one came to Joseph Mary's husband espoused husband and told him that don't worry about these things this is me the same Angel the greatest Angel and he comes down to this old man Zachariah and he says this he says in Luke chapter 1 verse 15 verse 13 but the angel said to him Zachariah got scared he's in there he's in the temple nothing like this had ever happened an angel cames down comes down the Angels always say the same thing they say fear not because there must be fear that's associated iated with these angels with they come and the angel said unto him feite Zechariah listen to this for the Lord for thy prayer is heard and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son and thou shalt call his name John God heard your prayer Zachariah he heard what you had prayed Zachariah must have been brother Aaron he's probably 65 70 years old he's not praying that the Lord will give him a son anymore those times are long since past he had resigned that this prayer isn't going to be answered but God had heard it and he comes to Zachariah he says God heard what you asked Zachariah God heard your prayer and thou shalt have joy and gladness and many shall rejoice at his birth for he shall be great in the sight of the Lord and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost even from his mother's womb and many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God and he shall go before him in the spirit and the power of Elias to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared for the Lord and z zaras listen to this even with an angel is standing before him and the angel says listen Zachariah God heard your prayer and he's got like what I'm an old man and Zachariah said unto the angel whereby shall I know this for I an old man and my wife well stricken in years how many of us in this room present now have fallen in the same trap that Zechariah fell into how many grandmas Grandma God heard your prayer God heard your prayer for your children you place it into his hand and he will answer but he'll do it in his time he knows what's best for all of us if he would have answered Zachariah and Elizabeth right when they prayed it it would have messed up the whole plan Jesus wouldn't have come for 30 for 40 years God had a plan Zachariah and Elizabeth were perfectly in this plan do you think God forgets our prayers when we are sincere it's easy most of us do think that we just kind of put it aside saying uh maybe maybe it wasn't his will but if it was God speaking through you as I said in Romans if that was the Holy Spirit speaking he doesn't forget and the angel answering and the angel answering said unto him I am Gabriel that stand in the presence of God and am sent to speak unto thee and to show thee these Glad Tidings and behold Thou shalt be dumb and not able to speak until the day that these things shall be per performed because thou believest not my words which shall be fulfilled in their season and the people waited for Zacharias and marveled that he carried so long in the temple when he came out he couldn't speak to them and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple for he beckoned on them and remain speechless here is this Angel put yourself in the Angel's position now he comes down he has word from the Lord he comes down and he says Zachariah you prayed it and I'm here to tell you God's answering says oh I'm too old what is anything too hard for God as the Bible says no and the same thing for us and what I'm trying to say is this isn't just a story this is to apply to ourselves if we have a prayer if we ask God something he is able to answer no matter what the circumstances seem and if we were on our knees and we were praying or as I said standing however you were praying to God and it was the Holy Spirit speaking through you have confidence that it will happen it's in the Lord's hands we don't have to worry that he forgot we're constantly trying to remind them we're constantly say Lord what about my kids what about what about my job what about my car what about this what about that we need I need it and he's like I heard you the first time and I'm gonna answer in my time if I answer in your time it won't work out right so he answered Zachariah and Elizabeth in his time there was a young lady who was like 15 or 16 years old over here that had to be born and had to grow up that she was chosen before the foundation of the world to give birth to the Messiah everything had to be going in perfect line and if Zachariah and Elizabeth would have got their way it would have messed it all up so here is born John the Baptist as Jesus said the greatest there had never been a woman man born of a woman greater than John and that's who was born and as I said it was perfect and God's plan was brought through perfectly let me read that again but the angel said unto him fear not Zachariah for thy prayer is heard word and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear a son and th shalt call his name JN God never underd delivers he never he will always impress us we don't judge him with our own carnal thinking but be patient with God and this world wants to tell you that you need your answer right now you need this right now whether there be young people you need a husband right now you need a wife right now when you get married you need children right now when you order from Amazon you got to have it right now you got to have it tomorrow wait it's all right you don't have to pay the $3 for the extra shipping let it go a couple days and the same thing with with the Lord Jesus be patient when you ask don't ask a Miss don't ask things wrong ask according to his will asking for his will James 1 verse 2 says this my brethren count at all joy when you follow into divers Temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith work is patience but let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect and entire that you may be whole and complete wanting nothing wanting means lacking nothing God's timing is perfect our time is flawed as I said we leave it we live in I need it now I need it this I need it yesterday and we we don't have patience God doesn't change though he said have patience that patience can have her perfect work Mark 16:14 Jesus he had come and he appeared to the disciples he had died on the cross gone into the grave and then the sisters saw him in the grave we know the Easter story and then Jesus manifests himself to the disciples Mark 16:14 says this and afterward he appeared unto the 11 as they sat at meat and abided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen so the sisters were telling the disciples that the Lord is risen he's come but they wouldn't believe it because this was just too much to believe this was just too much for God like Zachariah this miracle would have been too great and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature Jesus is instructing his disciples to go out after you have received this Faith go out and preach the gospel and I'd like to ask the brothers and sisters listen to me how many here will follow Jesus's commandment to go and preach the gospel it doesn't necessarily mean right here in this pulpit with the Bible open explaining the word but we are all to preach the gospel the gospel isn't in word only don't forget it's also in power as the Bible says he that believeth Jesus talking still he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned how important it is for us to tell our friends our family everyone we know about this Lord Jesus seeing that if they don't believe they're damned they're gone what does it produce friends what does this ministry produce if we really believe on the Lord Jesus if we really take him as at his his word what does it produce in every believer it says this and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover I feel like are you with me are you listening I'm reading the words of the Lord Jesus here this these are promises to God from God to us this is something that it may seem that this is this is something that can't happen or that I'm not worthy or that I can't do this but we just go day by day and we forget about the Lord Jesus we forget about the promises of God we forget of what he did for us and we forget to witness we forget to tell our friends we forget to tell our family most of all we get so caught up in the world and the way that we go and and thinking about our jobs and thinking about television and Internet and social media and everything else we forget to get down on our knees and pray we forget to go before God as Zachariah did we forget to go before God as Daniel did all of us there needs to be more praying more listening to God there needs to be more consecration there friends we can't just walk through this world there's and science talks about you know the the cycle of life and it's like four billion years ago this they see the first forms of life on Earth and it it goes to ultimately to a single cell organism and then to more complex organism organisms and all and and then it evolves into where we are right now it's what science says Believe It or Not doesn't it's it's not important but there are those in this world many say maybe most that they're born in life they go up they grow up they go through life maybe they come into contact with somebody that believes Jesus maybe they they live a good life maybe they make a mark on society whatever it is and then they die and then they're gone James says and their life is but a vapor so we just there's many that just go through life and it is there's no God there there's no coming to the Lord Jesus they just show up and they were gone they weren't in God's mind in the beginning and they're not in God's mind in the end Jesus Christ himself said many will come to me and I'll say depart from me I never knew you even Jesus Christ himself didn't know people and they'll go through life without anything many many people on the Earth are like that I don't want to be one of those I don't want my life to just be here and go away and then be out of the mind of God I was praying yesterday I was asking the Lord Lord please whatever wherever you send me whatever you do with me please let me just see you before whatever happens let me just know you I just want to see what you are maybe not even with my my eyes I just want to know what God is I know Moses asked the same thing we should all be asking that same question Lord I just want to know you that's the biggest desire of my heart and then I want others to know our Lord friends I feel like it's just not important enough there is nothing greater that you can do than to pray there is no way to have communion with God if you are not praying and I'm not just talking about when you sit down at the table Lord Lord bless this food and thank you for this good day and and we had a good service this morning in jesus' name amen that's not what I'm talking about I'm talking about the effectual fervent prayer that means something to where that Spirit can come down into you and into me and then we can speak God's word and then it happens that's what we need or else are we just going to walk through life and then die this Vapor goes away and nothing ever came of it we'll close the musicians can come let me read that scripture again Mark 16 speaking about a Believer these Believers that really pray and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover these are promises will we take God at his promise if we can't believe in healing how can we believe in our Salvation I was at church on Wednesday night years ago probably 10 12 years ago maybe more in Jeffersonville barely anybody in the service and I was sitting up towards the front in the middle of the church we're were listening to a tape of brother branam and then brother brandham at the end of the service he did what he did he does many many times and he said that if you believe he said God promised that if they shall lay hands on the sick that they shall recover he said if you believe lay your hands on one another we were kind of going through the motions I was sitting there like where you would be brother Joe and and we all bowed our head and tried to follow along like we do we all bowed our head and a hand touched me on the back and it was my friend named Steve klopp his family would always sit right behind IND us and we all prayed and then we closed the service like nothing else nothing had ever happened but God was there God honored his word so after the service brother Steve comes to me we're in the parking lot like I said very few people in the church brother Steve comes to me in the parking lot and he says brother Danny says say he says I think the Lord's going to he says when I prayed I think the Lord's going to heal you of your stomach I had suffered pretty much every day of my life since I was like maybe 15 16 years old with a stomach problem and the first time I had it it felt like I was having a heart attack there would be such an incredible pain in my chest and what it was was it was the acid that was building up in my stomach and putting pressure and causing this incredible pain and I would just carry around tongs every single day of my life and that especially when I would get nervous that that pressure would come up and the pain would be so bad I'd just lay down on my my desk because it hurts so much and it was every day it wasn't like it happens sometimes so I'd take the an acid with with me and that would that would take care of it and I would drink a glass of water and Steve afterwards he said that I think the Lord's going to heal he says I think he's going to heal your stomach that was the last day that I ever had a problem with my stomach give thanks to the [Applause] Lord that happened to me and it wasn't some big feeling it there was a sincere prayer from the brother behind me let me tell you something else that just happened before I walked in to this service that's why I was so torn up I was standing I was back there in the back and I was praying and that same feeling came up in my chest and that same pressure and that same pain that I used to suffer with came up there telling me you still got it you're still never heal I never healed you the Lord never healed you it's like Satan that happened 12 13 years ago I remember when it happened and so you give me a little bit of heartburn right now because I'm nervous about going out in front of these people not today Satan no and it went away I was able to walk out here and claim the Lord Jesus claim is healing we're going to have the communion tonight as I said this communion let a man examine himself not only for yourself but when you come up here you are also standing in the place of the disciples those disciples went out and they healed the sick and they brought many to Christ when we come up in this communion it is together we cannot be divided there can't be anything in between us because when we do that it damages it cuts off the plan of God he wants us together he said pray one for another why does he require that why can't we just go before the Lord and say Lord Heal me because he wants somebody else praying for us he wants his children together and that's the way we need to be and that's the way the communion is supposed to be you can't take communion by yourself the very word communion means to commune to be with each other love one another Jesus Christ himself you know the scripture he said I will know you when I return because of your love one for another you're going to be taking communion you're going to be taking the wine you're going to be serving each other you're going to as James said you're going to be praying for each other the Lord's going to be Healing The Sick you're going to be speaking in tongues these gifts are going to manifested themselves and it's all because you are doing you in the will of God but we need to put him first we need to get on our knees we need to pray one for another we don't do it enough I'm guilty we're all guilty and he's a change pray one for another go before the Lord one for another brother Dan there's not anything greater than we could do than going before our lord Jesus not on behalf of yourself but on behalf of someone else there's nothing greater that we could do that's what Jesus did that's the very Spirit of Christ that Jesus would go to the cross for someone else read it again and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature that is every living person he that believed and is baptized shall be saved and he that believe not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpants and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover is there anything about that that you don't believe no give me a little bit here do you believe it do you believe that the same God that healed me that's in the Psalms do you believe the same God that healed me of my stomach can heal you do you believe in communion do you believe in feet washing do you believe in the ordinances of God will you do something for me brother brandom and all those messages he loved to see the people praying for each other will you pray for each other right now will you lay your hands on the person in front of you on the person beside you will you do it in the name of Jesus Christ I don't care if you think that you're not worthy I don't care if you think you're a sinner lay your hands on one another according to the according to the commandments of Jesus Christ and as you're laying your hands on one another I promise you I don't have to promise Jesus promised that people are going to get healed today that people will be healed in the name of Jesus Christ because we're doing what he said have a burden one for another as my friend did for [Music] me Father give us faith I pray Lord as as the hands are laid upon one another Lord May the people be healed father it's not or we know it's not it's not us it's not anything else but it's the power of of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and his Commandments just following his word father May the people be healed I pray Lord help us to believe help us to love one another Lord if there be anything that's between us if Satan has somehow got in between one or two or more people that are here today Father May Satan be cast out in the name of Jesus Christ May the people be healed in the name of Jesus Christ May Souls that are lost father receive their salvation in the name of Jesus Christ father Satan can fight us all he wants but we trust in you as the hands of the people are laid upon each other Lord may that be not the hand of a sinner may it be the hand of the Son of God Jesus Christ May that Spirit flow through each one Lord bless the people I pray we thank you Lord for your word that we can that you've preserved this that we might read it in Jesus name amen let's all stand pray that I hope that you felt something as we were praying but if you didn't it doesn't matter it's a promise of God that we have and as I said we live below our privileges as Sons and Daughters of God Elijah was a man of like passions to us he made mistakes he got angry he did things wrong but he prayed [Music] and God heard his prayer or James would not have said what he said he was placing Us in that same position let's get ready for service tonight let's get ready for this communion let's love one another let's pray for one another let's have that perfect Unity of the body that Jesus wanted us to have that we love care pray for each other let's have that Unity brother [Music] Jordan all I want to see is [Music] Jesus all I want to see is him in me all I want to see is Jesus Jesus shineing Through Me All I

of his hands and put it into your hands keep it into his hands and then you do everything that you can because all of us have something to do do everything that you can and then trust in God I love that story about Zachariah I love it when the angel Gabriel said God heard your prayer oh sister Shirley we're going to say the same thing it may be when we're an old man or it may even be on the other side that will stand there and say he heard my prayer it didn't happen when I thought it was going to happen didn't happen when when I wanted it to happen but it happened just the same in his time prepare yourselves today for the communion service tonight Community is time of bringing the people together so think about it all day bible again as I said let says let a man examine himself so let's all examine ourselves and make sure that there's nothing that's in between anyone there's no sin that's Secret inside of your heart that needs to be confessed before the Lord make sure that that you're together with your brothers and sisters your sons and daughters and and all of us make sure we're together and then I believe the Lord will have a special blessing tonight for us as we take this body and blood of Jesus Christ God bless you you are is him in me all I want to see is [Music] Jesus shineing Through [Music] Me All I want to see is Jesus all I want to see is him in me all I
