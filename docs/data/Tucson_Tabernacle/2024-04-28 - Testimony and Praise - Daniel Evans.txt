for a moment let me just share a quick little testimony I heard today and I pass the service over brother Dan there's a a sister had a question and she was asking her husband is it wrong to trim the bottom of the hair so it's clean and nice and they were kind of going back and they said we really didn't he really didn't give me the answer so was said and this was yesterday and this morning they got on there they made their way to church and they were listening to their Pastor from where they used to belong and it was two hours different so they were listening it come to church and um the pastor is ministering and then he stops and he says now you know the hair is your glory why would you want to trim some of the glory off of your hair and then he kept preaching and she said okay the answer is there so even the smallest detail and the little things God has got a way to come and answer if you'll just listen amen [Music] amen God bless you everyone God bless you I am grateful brothers and sisters that we can give testimony that we can sing songs of praise that we can gather together to worship I know many many people that they cannot worship freely people in China that I've met dear brothers and sisters people in Iran dear brothers and sisters that they are not permitted to do what we are doing today just so freely out in the open we um I'd like to read let's all stand and I'd like to read a Psalm before we start Psalm 66 verse 16 Psalm 6616 reads like this come and here all ye that fear God and I will declare what he hath done for my soul I Cried unto him with my mouth and he was extolled with my tongue amen a testimony about giving praise about thanking the lord about singing songs and and giving testimony of what God has done for us and let's start today with brother Josiah and he has a a testimony to give and then a song for us brother Josiah and sit down before we do this song um a lot of you know that Grandpa AO has been battling cancer um some of you know but uh basically how it started is that Thanksgiving his feet were getting numb and he didn't really have an appetite so those were the first two things so basically he had when he when we finally got him to go to the doctor which consists of my dad going to his house and getting him in the car and driving him there to get him to go they found out that cancer had started in his bladder and had spread to his spine so once it's metastasized where it started in one place and spread to the other your chance of recovery drop significantly because it's grown so much and so from day one he's been like so positive uh so um encouraged so happy he does laps around his deck on his walker he's not like sitting around he's like he's working hard he's fighting and he's read Christ the Healer like four times and he's been super encouraged by it if you haven't read Christ the Healer by the way you need to get a copy of that we might have some in the office I don't know talk to brother ly he'll buy you a copy and it's it's uh so he's read that my dad gave it to him and he's been like standing on the promise uh claiming his healing every day my mom went over to see him and she came downstairs uh from her room upstairs and he was on the couch with both of his arms up just worshiping in his living room and he said the other day that he was he woke up and he was sitting up in bed and he was just praying uh praying in the spirit and talking to the Lord and he had read his Bible and he just felt the presence of the Lord come into the room and just flow through his body so then he went to the doctor the other day and he says this is a text he wrote to my dad hi Mark just returning from an appointment uh with Dr a my oncologist the first thing he said was good news he said my blood draw that I had had a few hours before said my PSA numbers were 2.53 so they were less than one and you want to be at like four or higher so he was less than one but now he's two and a half so he's gone significantly farther the other way and the cancer has shrunk so much in just a a little bit of time and they're able to take him off some of the steroids which has really been hard on his body and he's feeling so much better and he's he's so happy and you know he's really he's really uh proven that he actually does have faith and he's not afraid and so I believe he's going to come all the way out of it I don't think there's anything holding him back he's so positive every day um yeah we're going to sing this song it's called gratitude if you know it sing with us [Music] all my words fall short I've got nothing new how could I express all my gratitude I could sing these songs as I often do every song must end and you never do so I throw up my hands and praise you

there we go um I know I've told you this testimony before but I'm GNA tell you again um brother Josiah mentioned the uh book Christ the Healer are you familiar with that book does anyone is anybody familiar with that book yeah do you know who who wrote it FF Bosworth wrote it brother brandom referred to it so obviously brother Josiah recommended it well there was another one that recommended it too and his name was F was was named William brandom Brother um brother Bosworth was really an incredible man he um was one of the founding fathers of the Assemblies of God denomination when the Assemblies of God denomination adopted the um speaking in tongues as the initial evidence of the Holy Spirit brother Bosworth wrote an open letter to everyone and said this is not right and I resigned my P my position at the Assemblies of God and he stood up for it and he was ousted by the Assemblies of God and and uh you know they kind of scrub history well he's not much in the history of the Assemblies of God anymore so when he he went out and he found something better he met this man named William brandom I believe is in Florida and he said this is what I was looking for my whole life FF Bosworth was there one of the Pentecostal fathers at the isua Street Revival he saw it all happen in Los Angeles and he said when he he found brother brandom he said this is it this is what I've been looking for brother brandom and and brother Bosworth brother Billy Paul told me this story this is the one I've told you before I'm GNA tell you again um brother uh Bosworth was praying for the sick brother brandom was going to bring the message I believe it's the next day so he was staying in his hotel room and he was studying brother Billy Paul was there on the platform with brother Bosworth so brother Bosworth was getting old and he couldn't hear and there was a man came up to be prayed for and he was deaf and brother Bosworth told the man to come up and he said okay face the audience and he put his hands over the man's ears and he asked the Lord he said Lord Jesus heal this man of his deafness the man was facing away from Brother Bosworth brother Bosworth said brother can you hear the brother says yes I can hear and he says brother you're going to have to have more faith and he put his hands on his ears again and he said Lord give this man the faith to be healed and may his ears be healed in the name of Jesus and he said again the brother facing away from him he said now brother can you hear Brother saides I can hear and he says brother you're going to have to have more faith he says brother he says and he starts praying for him again and finally the brother turns around and he says brother I can hear he says now maybe you need to be prayed [Laughter] for and brother Billy Paul said he went back to the hotel room that night and he said brother Baran was crying he was laughing so hard so that was brother Bosworth great a great man of God sister Angela if you could make ready brother Ron I'm going to give you the microphone to give a testimony and then we'll have sister Angela and the kids sing well I just want to thank the Lord Jesus for saving my soul and for not giving up on me but you know our pastor this morning he preached so many things and I had I already told him that I prayed early this morning give my pastor something that will feed my soul and he did that and he said you know after you have one uh event in your life he said get ready for the next that's exactly what I told my wife and I went through an issue with my right eye that had the a hole and they they operated on it and uh I went to Friday and she says you're all healed and just need to get a new prescription you'll be okay well that's okay right now I got a lump on my neck and my back and I went and had it diagnosed and I have lymphoma which is she said it it's not cancerous but it could keep growing and be very debilitating so I'm going to believe the Lord's going to heal me and I would like all of you to pray for me right now I would too can can you do that for me I have faith in your prayer that he will take this away and they will not have to operate Let's uh let's let's go up to the let's go to the middle aisle here I'll Follow You brothers and sisters if we can't have a time like this in our lives where where we can pray for someone you look at an athlete and an athlete trains and and and gets ready and lifts weights and runs and does everything that they that they know how to do and then it comes to the main event and then that athlete is ready to go and

forever amen sister God Bess you know this let me just tell you that pleases the Lord how sweet God bless you Sister Angela I just wanted to share uh a testimony really quick many of you guys have

uh fallen out and really I they can't even describe it but it came down and it pinched was pinching my nervous and it caused the whole feeling of my left leg to go numb completely and last Thursday um I graduated from PT which is physiotherapy and they said you're good go see your surgery you don't need surgery as far as We Know [Applause] [Music] wrot a letter to my Lord I didn't know where to

testimony to sh I um I just wanted to thank the lord for keeping me because when he took Stephen home he carried me like a little baby and the anchor held he's my anchor when I couldn't hold myself like brother R said they said did your religion did you keep your religion he said no My Religion kept me am and that new birth that is our keeper and if he doesn't keep us we're not kept and so I just want to thank the lord for keeping me and for redeeming me [Music] I come to The Garden Alone while the de is still on the [Music] roses and the voice I hear falling on my near the sun of God heart [Music] discloses and he walks with me and he talks with me and he tell me I am his [Music] own and the joy we share as we tear there none other has ever known he speaks and the sound of his voice is so sweet the birds hush they're singing and the Melo that he gave to me within my heart is R sing it with me and he walks with me and he talks with me and he tells me I am his own and the joys we share as we tear there n other has ever known i' stay in the garden with [Music] him though the night around Me Be Me by BS me go through the voice of wo his voice to me is calling and he walks with me and he talks with me and he tells me I am his own and the joys we share as we tear there none other has ever known and the joys we share as we tear there none other has [Music] ever amen brother Paul I'm going to ask you to give your testimony then sister Amelia if you could make ready for your song I've been praying and asking the Lord what he wanted me to share because obviously it's not about me and whatever I have to say I want it to be strengthening and and a blessing to you and obviously to bless the Lord as well but uh when Josiah and Katie were singing that song The Mention Of The Lion kind of reminded me of a testimony that uh I share often but I've never shared it here in church and it was when uh the Lord delivered me from PTSD um in 2016 my family and I we went through a pretty rough patch to say the least without going into much detail um because I don't want to take up too much of your time but uh after the this episode in our life I began to experience symptoms that I really didn't understand um I was I had this constant painful knot in my stomach and I just I I no matter how much I prayed it wouldn't go away and I'm no stranger to God answering prayer so it was very mysterious to me but this these symptoms went on for about three years and the only time I found any relief was when I would drink kombucha that had probiotics in it or if I had yogurt that had real probiotics in it I'd experience about three or four minutes of relief that was it but as time went on as the I I need to back up a little bit actually before this episode happened in 2016 I remember clearly hearing the Lord tell me after he brought this flashback of a memory that I had in high school where I had acted a bit cowardly um again I'm not going to share the details of that because it's a little embarrassing but uh anyway you've had those memories where you're you you have something come back to you and you cringe and people are looking at you maybe and they're like what's the matter and you're like nothing so that was one of those moments and the Lord I clearly remember him saying we're going to deal with this and it wasn't until you know sometimes you go through things and it might be one or two or three years later before God lets you know what he's doing or what he did and that's what was going on with me I I was constantly seeking answers and wanting to know God why am I going through this why did this have to happen and Satan is always there to give you answers but you know when it's the voice of faith it just anchors you so I was never settled until I I I need to play this I don't think you'll mind um I was in bed one week uh I believe it was a a weekend now like I said I've been experiencing these symptoms for about 3 years and so I was laying in bed one afternoon and uh I was playing YouTube videos now my algorithm is set up to give me what I want that's usually Christian material I had dozed off to sleep when all of a sudden I heard this God Hates a Coward 218 says but the cowardly and the unbelievers murderers the sexually immoral Sorcerers idolators and all liars shall have their part in the Lake of Fire which is the second do youall get that Revelations 218 boy I'll tell you what it woke me up I sat straight up in bed and I was like oh God I'm a coward it took sometimes you know some of us me especially I'm a hardhead so I have to learn things sometimes the hard way God pulled the rug out from under my life and I'm sorry my family had to go through it but you and I cannot stop sinning you can't there's nothing that you can do to stop it's if you're you're either overcoming or you're not if you can stop a freight train you might have a chance it's stopping sin but it's not within our power I repented in that very moment and from that day forward I was set free from PTSD amen sister Amilia isn't God good he's healed all of us have testimonies all of us we could be here well we're going to be giving testimonies for an eternity this is just a little taste of it pleas please playar with me as I get older my voice gets awful or maybe it was always like that I'm not too sure but just bear with me and uh this is a song I want to sing it's also a testim of things have actually happened in my life there were so many others that he could have chosen to follow him others more rightous and seemly worthy to follow him but he passed by the Pharisees and St for a woman at a well and though there's nothing within me that any could see it's in me he placed his seed he chose me he chose me by his grace he redeemed me and made me his bride and forever I'll Rain by his side of let father and mother sister and brother to follow him friends have forsaken my life has been shaken to follow him what is sorrow in this life when compared to Eternity for of a father in Heaven I'm Longing To See and put together will always be I leave my will in my senses my thoughts and ambition to follow him leave my own understanding and faithless religion to follow him I Lay My Life on the altar till his word is made flesh in me and though completely unworthy his remage shall be to reign as king and queen he chose me he chose me by his grace he redeemed me and made me his bride and forever I'll reain by his side thank you sister Amilia God bless you thank you brother moral do you have a testimony I want to um say something about our sister millia here we've seen prayer requests come out from her she's sister milia hasn't had it easy but sister you know thinking about you and thinking about that that song that you just sang there is a day that you're going to walk out on the streets of Heaven as a bride adorned for her husband and it's all going to be worth it there then Jesus said that he'll wipe those tears away from our eyes God bless your heart sister you're you're an inspiration there's many people coming to church now because of this sister so sister there're uh thank you brother Merl and then I'll go to Sister Missy and then um Sister Barbara if you could go after that somebody said you have a Tes oh you want me to hold it for no I just I just the other day the the they uh the just that's F we're we're going to make you preach if you don't the other day when the uh Citrus started blooming night I had blooms everywhere and they were already dropping and uh they uh I said well I need some bees here that these things won't produce anything you know they they do what they do but uh they uh so I just asked the Lord I said I need bees so I can have some good fruit and uh the next morning they were all over so uh I think the Lord he answers prayer even the simplest of things amen it's not a little thing yeah that's that's uh I think brother merley that resonated with all of us that was um these things are important and they're a blessing sister Missy God bless you everyone I'm going to try talking sitting down because I'm used to waving my arms and but you know I want to just talk a little bit about what brother Dan spoke this morning about God's faithfulness when I reconsecrated my life to the Lord it was shortly before um Co and I started I had just purchased a house and the mortgage was twice the amount that I had been previously paying and I had just been through a divorce and I just making it on my own and the company I have worked for for many years has always allowed us a lot of overtime so it's supplemented my income when Co hit came to a standstill they Lo they laid off my you know many of my co-workers I was heartbroken but the Lord knows all things I K my job and there was no overtime and I started uh putting offerings but not paying tithes and I knew I was trying to like finding my budget cut this cut that you know and just to start increasing my offerings to make it into a tithing and then one day I just said that's it I'm going for it I started paying my tithe I have never wanted for anything the Lord has taken care of me over and over again and during that covid there was no uh overtime so one day I got my first electric bill in my new big house and I was like crushed by how much it was and my boss emailed me there there had been no overtime and she says do you want to work a little bit of overtime I worked like 5 hours and it was almost exactly to the penny of what my power bill was extra that I needed to cover that amen that electric bill amen and you know God is so faithful you know and he knows everything before it matters to him all these small what may be a coincidence to somebody else but to me it isn't and one more thing brother Dan really quick like two weeks ago I lost my cell phone on my way to church the day prior I had bought a new iPad because my computer crashed or is slowly dying a painful death and I had just transferred all my data from my phone to my iPad put my phone on top of my car drove off to church and it fell off somewhere well in the business that I work in I need my phone because they they you get security passes all day long for different applications well I could feel my nerves start you know working up as how am I going to get into the company portals so I can get a passcode to get in and I just said I I said you know I can't even ask the Lord for these things you know because I just think it why does the Lord want to be bothered the next day I just by face that on my computer buts I didn't have a phone for 2 days and I didn't need a a single passcode in those two days on Wednesday when I got my phone logged in I needed a passcode after I got my new phone and the Lord is so mindful because he knows how I work get all worked up and anxious and but you know I thank the Lord and I'm so grateful for his faithfulness you know if anyone's undeserving I am but God is just so gracious to me all the time God bless you Sister Barbara if you could make ready we um Stephanie and I when we um we're in Jeffersonville we like sister Missy you don't have a lot of money and and you're appreciate it and when something goes wrong the Lord you just rely on the Lord to to help you and we always paid our tithe we always took that out first and there was a time that our refrigerator went out and it was 1,500 bucks and we didn't have it we have to have a refrigerator so we didn't know what to do and it was about the same time that my aunt Jacqueline felt it on her heart to give all of her she calls us all her kids but all 10 of her kids kids she wanted to give us each $1,500 the exact amount of our refrigerator Sister [Applause] Barbara well before I play a song uh I just wanted to say um I hate to do this and I get very nervous when I'm in in front of anybody having to talk and but several I don't know how many maybe several weeks or months ago brother that asked me to play the piano some night when we have one of these open evenings and I said oh I can't do that I said I get so nervous my hands get all sweaty I forget what I'm playing and he said well I really would like you to and he's kind of and I said well I'll I'll play the piano when you sing and I thought he'll never sing well I think it was that night or the next scene we had he and Heather sang a duet and I thought oh no now I'm in for I've got to play so I've been putting it off but I thought okay Lord I'll do it but so I was telling my son James this afternoon I said I'm really nervous I said I really don't like playing in front of anybody if anyone comes to the house and I'm playing the piano I quit and he said well you can do one of two things and I said what he says you can play really terrible they'll never ask you again or else you can back out or play so anyway so just pray for for me cuz this isn't my choice but brother Lyall talk me into it and I haven't I we've lived here 50 years gone to this church and this is the second time I've played the piano and the other time was when my son Jeffrey sang so it's not like I'm an accomplished pianist but so I've got to think of [Music] [Applause] sorry if brother Mike was here Sister Barbara you could make him sing you appreciate that amen God never said your Talent had to be perfect and he just said to give to do you know and to someone it'll it'll reach them amen such love such wondrous love that God should love a sinner such as I what key I don't [Music] know we're going to have to go up such love such wonderous love such love such wonderous love that God should love a sinner such as I how wonderful is love [Music] like that God should love a sinner such as I should yearn to change my sorrow into Bliss nor rest till he had planed to bring me now how wonderful is love like this such love such wonderous love such love such wonderous love and God should love a sinner such as I how wonderful is love like this such love such wonderous love such love love such wonderous love and God should love a sinner such as I how wonderful is Love Like This [Music] now Sister Elizabeth we call her Missy it's my sister-in-law and there was a time that our my my sister-in-law went away from the Lord and and we saw it in all but me and my wife would pray for her and ask God to reach and there was times we wondered but greater is he than any situation amen and I know that she loves the Lord today and because of that Unice is here today amen and Shawn is here today because God answers prayer amen don't ever give up amen amen praise God thank god sister Sarah if uh there you are if you'd make ready I'm glad that I had somebody praying for me sister Missy too had a mom that loved me and Dad that loved me and they put up with a lot and I just I wish they were here now that they could come to this church and and see everything that's going on here I think it'd be a blessing to them God bless you I didn't know if I was going to sing today but I Just prayed and asked the Lord to laid it on brother Daniel's heart or the leadership of the ministry to call because it's not something that I feel very strong to come up here and say I have this testimony or that testimony but I've had these songs on my heart for a while because it seems like sometimes I just fail a lot in my life you know private things that like brother Paul was saying you just don't want to admit to you know to other people much less you know I know that God sees it and I see it and that's bad enough so um just in thinking about these things I want to Echo what we've said tonight about God really is so faithful and it's him that we can cast ourselves on his Mercy because he is merciful more merciful than we are to each other and certainly more merciful than we are to ourselves but these are songs that sometimes I sing when I'm overwhelmed um but also just crying out to God because they're actually Psalms from that David wrote and you know how many centuries have we had the Psalms but to me David shows the humanity of all of our existence when we read the Psalms he cries out so many human things good things bad things you know half the time he's just saying oh God and you know and when you consider his life he lived his life on the run for more than half of it you know in literally for his life he ran for his life taking shelter where he could didn't know who to trust didn't know and then of course we know of his S I mean would you like your book written with his sins written like his are I I have to think about that sometimes this was a man though that God really loved and he allowed him to pen words that would fit all human condition and I'm so grateful that's in my Bible because that's my saving grace too and of course you know in the New Testament we have our sacrifice David had just the Bulls and the goats and we know the types we know but we have that assurance that once and for all Christ died for our sins and I'm grateful for that today so I'm going to do this capella I didn't like I said I didn't have time to practice with anyone or do anything but um anyways these are from Psalms 5 61 and 51 give to my words oh Lord consider my meditation and hearken unto the for voice of my cry my king and my God for unto thee will I pray my voice shalt thou hear in the morning oh

Lord if I could just see that sunlight Lord I will cry out to you when that sun rises all of us have sinned and all of us have made mistakes and all of us have cried out to God for forgiveness we've asked the Lord many times to change the mistakes that we've made I don't know if I've ever ever heard more beautiful words in my life than what sister Sarah's saying just now before we'll close with sister Jessica and then Daniel giving a testimony and a song is there anyone else that would like to give a testimony before we we close good evening my name is elder I go to um flx up Tabernacle with Brother Steve I haven't been there for a while I've been working I was up in Reno last year so that's where then one day I was looking for the church up in um Carson City and then I called him ask him where the address was and he told me oh it's right here guess where I'm at and he said I'm here so Steve was in Carson yes he was in Carson City so yeah this yesterday or was it this morning he text me goes where you at are you still in Carson City and I um well I'm telling him I'm going be here so I'm working down here a little ways and um I just want to give a testimony that how how I got to hear the message and be saved I'm I'm nabo from up North and I grew up with I had my parents my dad wasn't around so I just kind of drifted here and there and went to boarding school and then I went through high school and and I got in trouble with some of my friends and I end up down here I was driving down I was thinking about tucon I end up first I went I was sent to um Department of Correction went down to Tucson and not to some about Florence and then from there I went came over here to to South Walmart or whatever was the ESS was down here I was driving down and thinking about it I was like man these where I got Sav save amen good so um I got there and I just started going to just just a church and it was just something different and and then um and then from there I got down to um went down to Douglas for a minimum yard right before my release and I met a brother named um I was sitting on the yard and looking looking at my little Bible and he sat next to me and talking with him and he asked me about the seven Church ages and I said I don't know what you're talking about I don't see no seven churches in here and he and then he witnessed to me about the message and he so I this where I heard the message and then and I been then I started attending Flex death Tabernacle so I've been very blessed and and I I went home and made testimony to my my family and all that but they're they don't want none of the message I don't know why but um but I'm glad to be here and here to put some testimonies to encouraging and I like it thank you [Applause] amen okay so brother Steve used to sit here when he was in the border patrol and I'd sit right here and so brother Bram was in Oakland in his first tape he said I you're going to think this is self exaltation when he talked about some of his testimonies there in Oakland the first time he went in 47 but like brother Paul I think or Ronnie said that they wanted to glorify God so if you met something you had something that really worked that helped people you'd be cruel not to share it with them right that's good yes and so I was hiking with Brother Steve and she said that say that's s about broken contrite heart you know you you don't know what it's like to be in somebody else's shoes you know you really don't you kind of can sort of but Stephen I and a bunch of others walles went down to uh have a soup by Falls Rachel were the last ones there and they had already eaten at the cafe but this brother rod sarton do you know him brother Rod sart he said can you help me find my hearing aid I said sure So we went back to the cafe we were at the hotel was about a block away and you can't there's it would rained in there and it was muddy and I thought oh if it falls in here the horses and muls are going to just put it in the mud and and I was looking on the cafe floor I laid down on theor laor and looked around I said Lord I'm sorry I couldn't oh in that tape brother Brown I'm talked about he could put the pocket knife in his hand remember in Oakland and I said Lord I'm sorry I can't put the hearing aid in my hand but don't have the faith to do that I wish I had more faith you know but I just said you can help me find it we were in there three nights I forgot all about it I told the people gave my phone number if they find the hearing a because it was expensive hearing that he said and three nights we were in there it had been raining and we were in the grass by the hotel it was kind of unkempt and Long Tall Grass and Russell was trying to get me to stay and I said no if I don't go early I had my back back on I'm waiting for my wife that's the only thing reason I hadn't gone because she hadn't come and I just looked down I felt a little ashamed because he was trying to get me to stay and be with them and pray and I just looked down at my feet because I didn't know what to say and the hearing aid was right between my feet I picked it up and I handed it to Russell you know but my point in saying all that is if you pray a prayer don't give up on God you don't I mean he won't give up on you you don't have to worry but he'll do he'll answer anybody's prayer I really seen that I've seen these people out here telling me testimonies they're on fentol and they're living in adultery and just garbage and God still answers their prayers so why can't we get some prayers you know that's my point no I'm not saying but we just have to believe and and think when Jesus okay the disciples said increase our faith he told him a story about the man working first he said the benefits of Faith but then he said at the end he said likewise say I'm an unprofitable servant remember he told the story about the man working so my point my take on that what do you think is that you're not we're none of us are worthy when you think you're worthy and and then that goes along with the two Gentiles the the the um the um Centurion I'm not worthy that you come under my roof speak the words and then the other lady she let him call him a dog her a dog right and she just kept coming so it I that's what I'm trying to say is you know I'm slow Chris he diagnosed me I said he said' I can tell you about everybody and I said tell me about me he saidou slow and sloppy he did it right he's not going to diagnose me because I don't wantan to I don't want to know let me uh brother Arie was he was talking about this I'll come around he was talking about finding that hearing aid brother Billy Paul shared a testimony with me one time he was he was at the beach and and he was there all day and he came back to his hotel room and he saw that his wedding ring it was either his or his wife's I think it was his wife's wedding ring was gone at the beach all day having no idea where it was and they were really upset and brother Billy Paul he said you know how many miracles he he seen and he walked out of the hotel room he walked down to the beach where they were he kneeled down in the sand he dug his hands down in the sand and he picked it up and there was the ring wow yeah brother Billy Paul told me that testimony personally I get really scared to do this I don't know why I love all you people but I just get so nervous but um first of all I had a wonderful afternoon being a widow I just have a little dog that with me and it'll be 5 years come June the 21st that Rod went to be with the Lord I know he's happy there and I just miss him I guess but I know he's doing all right and I'm doing better I know I know the Lord is helping me each day but so much for me but I had a great day today I went over to brother Lyle and sister Heather's house which is spectacular they have a beautiful house and the backyard is full of flowers and we had the best meal I mean I ate so much food which I probably shouldn't ate so much but it was so good and I just thank them so much they're just lovely Christians I feel like I I'm so nothing compared to them but I did enjoy myself so much and I appreciate them and love them and what brother Lyle is doing is so wonderful and and sister Heather such a hospitable person and I would like to be more like that but you know just try but anyway this little thing happened and it's really kind of simple I'm just kind of a simple person but this blessed me I told Daniel Dan about it and uh Dan Jr is staying with me and he was he was busy that day and and so I needed my five gallon water I have four of them they're really can be heavy when they're full of water and I needed them to to be filled and he was gone and so I said I'm a little red hand I can do this and so I put him in the car and it went to the little place but on the way I said I didn't I just said Lord wouldn't it be nice if you could just find a strong man that would just say oh would could I help you with that water and put it in your car and I'm telling you I was sticking the money in the saying I was having a hard time dollar bill it wouldn't go in real good and this man come up big strong dude and um and he got out of the car and he saw us having a little trouble and he says you know ma'am K those those water jugs are way too heavy for you can I put them in your car and I said oh thank you Lord and I said you don't know I just prayed a prayer and I said I didn't ask in any way I just said wouldn't it be nice Lord if you could find somebody like this and he did it I am so grateful for the Lord Jesus he takes care of me I'm so grateful thank you amen I can testify that anytime you go over to Lyall and Heathers it's a good day amen any more testimonies before sister Jessica we have one over here who okay so Jeremy wants me to tell you this testimony so two days ago um Brother Ray Thomas called me and he's like sister Angela the chickens all have swollen necks and uh they look like they're going to die I said like one or two and he said no all 53 of them and I was like being raised on a farm I kind of know some information so I called my mom and she's like yeah it could be this this or this and I was like you know I'm just going to pray so Brother Ray myself my parents and my husband we just agreed and said Lord this is uh income from Brother Ray that we've been helping him with and we just rebuke the enemy for whatever he's trying to do and the next day I called Brother Ray up and he said I'm too scared to go out there and I said go out there they're okay and he goes okay I'll go and he steps out the door and he hears the chicken clucking and he goes they're okay Angela and so he walked out there and he said there's no swollen necks everything's good and he said I don't know what it was and I said I'm not going to claim it but I believe God took care of it so amen anybody else brother the Paul I've been thinking about it I'd like to finish my story how long has this just a second um the detail that I left out was that just so your imaginations don't wander um in 2016 on the same day I lost my home my job and my church the support of my church and that was probably the hardest day of my life so it all happened so that God could Purge and cleanse me from that fear that I didn't even know was there I mean I was at that time Spirit-filled but it was something that I had just maybe swept under the rug but I just wanted to add that detail just so your imaginations don't wander but also to put to put emphasis on that again you know you cannot stop sinning I have been there before I've I've said I'm struggling with something and you think that you're maybe doing good some days and you're doing bad other days there's no such thing you're either overcoming or you're not it's through repentance rep towards Jesus Christ and when he delivers you you are an overcomer it was it was about three years ago that I was at the car wash and um me and Stephanie were there and uh I said honey there's a sister there and uh I said let's go say hi to her and so we uh we stopped and and it was Sister andreana i' never I hadn't seen her in about 20 years I think and we had a conversation and I got to tell you that it was brother Paul I think it was from that point that I really got such a strong burden for this church I've never been here before I umum just a little here and there but when I met sister andreana there at the car wash something happened in me and I don't know what it was it's like maybe that widow woman that God commanded her to feed Elijah maybe that was the time that God God had commanded me to serve you all here at the Tabernacle so I know the Murray family they're they're precious to me and brother Paul has been a good friend and and um it's awesome isn't it it's just it's just [Applause] great sister Jessica did she chicking out what's what's that oh oh she's up there okay um so about a year ago I was um battling I had a really bad cough that I had for six months and I couldn't get rid of it and the Lord showed me that it was the enemy that was putting something on me so I had prayed and asked the Lord I said Lord you know what's going on you're aware of it I said if the pastor or whoever's ministering can just mention this scripture then I'll know that it's all in your hands and you're going to take care of it even if they just mention it refer to it they don't have to read it and so when we got here to church um the pastor read one scripture and it was that scripture and so I had went to the doctor um and because I still couldn't get rid of it and they gave me some antibiotics they gave me bronchitis but they gave me antibiotics cuz they said that they saw something in the xray on my right side and ever since then I've always felt that pain on my right side well about two weeks ago brother Dan had everyone I had been prayed for by brother Dan and other brothers that were our men of God so I just held on to that even though I would always feel the pain um so two weeks ago brother Dan at the end of service had everyone lay hands on each other and pray for them and I could I was standing in between sister um I forgot her name sister I'm sorry sister Shirley and sister hope and I could really feel the prayers that they were praying for me while I was praying for them and last week I had to go to the ER I had a pain somewhere else that I couldn't um bear so I went and they took an x-ray and I told the doctor that they had seen something in the X-ray and he said wow he says we don't know what it is he said everything that we see he says I don't see anything in your X-ray your kidneys are healthy and everything's good so it was a muscular pain that I had but I just praise God because I know that he healed me [Applause] completely there's a lot of verses in that book you don't just choose one after a sister praise and turn right to that scripture sister that nothing but the hand of the Lord is there anyone else sister Heather okay I'm sure all of you have had desires of your heart and you just have them in your heart you commit it to the lord well I have for quite a while wanted to connect with our oldest son and just have some time with him and so I just I knew we were too busy we had this we had that we're going to be it just didn't seem possible but about two weeks before my birthday last the other week uh L just out of the blue says hey how about for your your birthday would you like to go see Samuel I had not told him I had not I because I knew we were busy and it was be asking a bit over the top but he said how would you like to go I said yes yes I would like to go and so then that was exciting I thought Bo I'm going and then all of a sudden my back kinked and I couldn't hardly sit on my seat here at church and I thought how in the world can we go I can't sit in this airplane for all this time and have my back out so uh sister Rachel was Rachel Getta was sitting next to me and in church and she just when prayer was made for others she put her hand on me and okay and then several other sisters agreed that they were going to pray for me and I went on that trip had the most marvelous time connected with that precious son and so he gives you the desires of your heart because he sees inside and he knows he's so [Applause] precious the Bible says when we pray that in the Book of Romans chapter 8 that it's not us that's praying it's the desires of the Holy Spirit and then the holy spirit is praying that through us with words that can't even be uttered so sister I believe that that was not necessarily sister Heather I believe that was the Holy Spirit praying that sister Jessica would like to share a little testimony and also a prayer request or a prayer that the testimony I'm going to give will one day walk through these doors um a cousin of mine that grew up with us she lived with us for probably 12 years or more she was like a sister to me and um we had a falling out in the family and we hadn't spoken to her in or I hadn't spoken to her in years but a few months ago she um had a medical emergency and since none of the family she wasn't speaking to any of us it was actually one of her co-workers that called um my sister to tell her that that my cousin hadn't reported to work so my parents um hurried down to her apartment and they found her in a very bad situation they rushed her to the hospital and they by all accounts she should have died um but God spared her and um she did lose her leg they had to amputate her right foot um but in all this um there's been reconciliation with the family and that's been amazing and I'm just praying for wisdom that we can speak the words to her that will bring her here bring her to to any church but would love to see her here um but just to even see how God has softened her heart through all of this so God bless you [Music] peace of God cover me cover me cover [Music] me peace of God cover me through the storm cover me peace of God cover me cover me cover me peace of God cover me through the storm cover me and only in you I am safe and only in you I'm secure only in you I find peace so cover me cover me oh only in you I am safe and only in you I'm [Music]

my faith is gone let the peace that passes all I [Music] understand cover me cover me [Music] peace of God cover me cover me cover me peace of God cover me through the storm cover me [Applause] God bless you guys I have a testimony before my song today it's a testimony from work I feel like every time I get to work uh the Lord just does something to let let me know that he's with me I work so the other day I was at work and I we had this admission and it was this man and he was he was really sick he had just got a heart attack he just came from the ICU and the unit I work on down we're kind of like a step down unit from the ICU so most patients we get they're just really sick you know they're they're they're very close to death or they're on the bed on the on the mend but whatever the case is they're sick and so we get this guy and he was on the tra he was he just had a heart attack and he was just kind of fighting for his life and so I see him and I get done with my shift and I don't work for like another week and then I I see him the next week and he's up he's talking he's just doing so much better and I look at him I was like I was like man I was like you're doing so good he was like I know look at me he was like I'm walking I was like a I was like you're crazy man and so me and him get to talking and I asked him I said I said what do what are you going to do when you get out of here and he was a truck driver before and I said are you going to go back to truck driveing and he looked at me and he kind of thought for a second he says you know what Daniel he says he's like the lord gave me extra time on this Earth he was like I just want to give that extra time to him and he said that not knowing I'm a Christian not knowing anything about me and I was like just praise the Lord man I was like I'm a Christian I said God bless you I was like there's nothing better you can do with your life than that and so I just want to give give glory to God for his testimony today [Music] I've been held by the Savior I felt fire from above I've been down to the river I ain't the same a prodical return All My Hope Is In Jesus thank God my yesterday is gone all my
