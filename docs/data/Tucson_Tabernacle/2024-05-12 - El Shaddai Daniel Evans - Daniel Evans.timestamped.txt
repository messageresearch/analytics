[45:17] um there's really nothing
[45:21] sweeter than a mother I asked sister
[45:25] Jessica to sing that song
[45:28] um because El Shai has a very special
[45:32] meaning it
[45:35] means it means the the breasted God the
[45:39] god that can nurse life into an infant
[45:43] into a helpless a helpless
[45:46] person
[45:49] and it's such a loving spirit that this
[45:53] El Shai
[45:55] has and
[45:58] as I said it's it's
[46:01] so applicable to
[46:04] Motherhood before we get started
[46:07] brothers and sisters I want to say that
[46:09] just over the past couple days that I've
[46:13] been contacted by a few people and and
[46:17] I'm just so proud I'm so proud of our
[46:19] congregation I'm so proud of the
[46:21] individuals that are going
[46:24] through all of us are going through
[46:26] something
[46:28] but to see character rise up above a
[46:33] trial is just it's such a blessing it's
[46:36] so encouraging to
[46:38] me and we should never ever say a a bad
[46:44] or a critical word about
[46:46] anyone either if it's if it's to their
[46:49] face or behind their back or even to
[46:51] your husband and wife if if you even a
[46:54] husband and a wife talking in private we
[46:56] should never even say a word about
[46:59] someone else even in our private
[47:03] Chambers
[47:06] it brothers and sisters it can do such
[47:10] harm point out when someone is speaking
[47:14] negative don't necessarily try to
[47:17] correct them but point out that Christ
[47:20] was
[47:22] Perfection and Christ is the one that we
[47:25] look to
[47:27] Jesus is the one that taught us not to
[47:31] say a a critical or a negative word ever
[47:36] he and he set the
[47:38] example he was spit
[47:41] upon they spread rumors about his
[47:46] mother that she had an affair with a
[47:50] heathen Roman
[47:55] soldier those
[47:58] rumors followed
[48:00] him for his whole life they accused him
[48:04] as he started in the ministry they
[48:06] accused Jesus of betraying the very
[48:11] Jehovah who was his
[48:16] father and yet he cried out to God for
[48:20] for to forgive those who spoke against
[48:24] him if we are not Christians
[48:28] if someone does us
[48:29] wrong and we are not a Christian then we
[48:33] have every right to fight back we have
[48:37] every right to speak evil of them if
[48:40] they speak evil of us we have every
[48:44] right to apply an eye for an eye and a
[48:46] tooth for a tooth if you do me wrong I
[48:49] can do you wrong if you are not a
[48:52] Christian but if you are a Christian if
[48:54] you truly believe in Jesus then you have
[48:57] no you forfeit those
[48:59] rights no matter what someone says about
[49:01] you you have no right to respond
[49:06] none that's what a Christian says twice
[49:11] yesterday brothers and sisters
[49:13] experience this
[49:15] one
[49:18] once someone who was hurt by someone by
[49:23] someone else that was offended
[49:27] by someone
[49:29] else and that someone else ended up
[49:33] coming to his
[49:36] rescue saving him from from a very
[49:40] difficult
[49:41] situation someone who was he was they
[49:44] were offended
[49:45] at and then yet this person later
[49:49] on comes and goes out of his way to take
[49:54] care of the person that was offended and
[49:57] then another time a
[49:59] brother felt condemned he he let his
[50:02] temper get to him and and he texted me
[50:06] and he asked me to pray for him and
[50:07] because he he he had said something
[50:10] wrong last week and he couldn't wait to
[50:12] get back to work to make it right on
[50:17] Monday and he said brother what do I do
[50:20] and he confessed these to me and I said
[50:23] brother said that just
[50:27] proves I said you're
[50:30] awesome I said what you just told me
[50:32] just proves that you are a
[50:34] Christian that there is that spirit that
[50:37] holy spirit inside of you that is is
[50:39] causes
[50:41] repentance and you're sorry and you want
[50:44] to make it right shows me there's
[50:47] something very special about that
[50:49] brother shows me that he has that Spirit
[50:52] of Christ we make mistakes and other
[50:55] people make mistakes in dealing with us
[50:56] us
[50:58] also but remember as a Christian we
[51:00] forfeit our rights no matter how bad
[51:05] someone treats
[51:07] us no matter what they do we are not
[51:12] permitted to do them evil harm speak
[51:16] against them in any way because we're a
[51:20] Christian Jesus said in Matthew chap
[51:23] 5:38 has been on my heart the past few
[51:26] weeks as you
[51:27] know you have heard that it hath been
[51:30] said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a
[51:33] tooth but I say unto you that you resist
[51:36] not evil but whosoever shall smite thee
[51:39] on thy right cheek turn him the other
[51:41] also and if any man will sue thee at the
[51:43] law and take away thy coat let him have
[51:46] thy cloak
[51:47] also and whosoever shall compel thee to
[51:50] go a mile goeth him
[51:51] Twain give him that asketh thee give to
[51:55] him that ask asketh thee and from him
[51:57] that would borrow of thee turn not thou
[52:00] away you have heard that it have been
[52:02] said Thou shalt love thy neighbor and
[52:04] hate thine
[52:05] enemy if you're for remember as I said
[52:08] if you're a Christian you forfeit that
[52:11] but I say Jesus speaking but I say unto
[52:13] you love your enemies bless them that
[52:16] curse you do good to them that hate you
[52:19] and pray for them which despitefully use
[52:22] you and persecute you persecute you that
[52:24] was Jesus Christ's first sermon
[52:28] we're talking about the Rapture and
[52:29] we're talking about the son of man
[52:30] Ministry and the resurrection of the
[52:31] Saints and the Heavenly City and the
[52:33] bride of Christ brothers and sisters
[52:35] none of us are going to see that unless
[52:37] we have that
[52:39] Foundation none of us will see those
[52:44] things unless we have the foundation
[52:47] which is of Christ and what Christ
[52:50] taught we can't expect that we're that
[52:54] we're entitled to something
[52:58] if someone says something behind our
[53:00] behind our backs or whatever it is if
[53:02] you are despitefully you used love that
[53:06] person if you're cursed behind your back
[53:08] if you're cursed to your face pray for
[53:11] that person Jesus commanded
[53:15] that it may s it may see seem simple but
[53:19] how many people really do
[53:21] it Jesus said straight is the gate and
[53:25] narrow is the way and few there will be
[53:29] that find it do you think he was just
[53:32] talking to
[53:34] himself it wasn't he was talking to
[53:41] us I'm
[53:44] thankful for that one text I got
[53:47] yesterday I can see
[53:50] that it's doing
[53:52] something a church the ministering and
[53:57] and and and what we're doing here as a
[53:59] as a the Tucson Tabernacle it's having
[54:02] an effect at least on a few
[54:06] people bless them that curse you and do
[54:09] good to them that hate you and pray for
[54:10] them which despitefully use you and
[54:12] persecute you that you may be the
[54:14] children of your father which is in
[54:16] heaven for he maketh his son to rise on
[54:19] the evil and on the good and sendeth the
[54:20] rain on the just and the unjust if you
[54:23] love them which love you what reward
[54:25] have you do not even the publicans the
[54:27] same and if you salute your brethren
[54:30] only what do you more than others do not
[54:34] even the publicans do so be therefore
[54:37] perfect even as your father which is in
[54:39] heaven is perfect that word perfect in
[54:41] Modern English means
[54:43] blameless brothers and sisters if we
[54:45] can't get the very basics of
[54:48] Christianity the very first sermon that
[54:50] Jesus preached how can we expect to see
[54:53] him when he returns
[54:57] let that sink
[55:00] in these things are basic Christian
[55:04] principles and he said so that you might
[55:06] be the children of your father if you do
[55:08] these
[55:09] things when God came to
[55:13] Abraham in Genesis chapter
[55:17] 17 he
[55:18] changed Abram's name to Abraham he
[55:22] changed Sarah Sarah's name sarai's name
[55:24] to Sarah he gave Abra abam a covenant of
[55:27] circumcision and he promised Abraham
[55:30] that although he was 99 years old and
[55:32] his wife was 90 that they were going to
[55:35] have a
[55:38] child and Not only would they have a
[55:41] child Sarah and Abraham both would have
[55:44] this
[55:46] child but God would make
[55:48] nations from
[55:51] them nations from Abraham and Sarah
[55:56] it was a promise and when he came to
[55:59] Abraham to give him these promises when
[56:02] God came to
[56:04] Abraham to give him all of those
[56:08] promises that I said and even the
[56:09] Covenant of circumcision that was told
[56:11] that you were one of God's people when
[56:13] he gave that commandment he came in a
[56:16] certain name he announced
[56:20] himself as El
[56:23] Shai the god that can nurse love
[56:26] life into a child as a mother can nurse
[56:31] life into an
[56:32] infant Genesis chapter 17 verse1 says
[56:36] this and when Abram was 90 years old and
[56:39] nine the Lord appeared to Abram and said
[56:42] unto him I am the almighty God the
[56:45] original Hebrew word for that this
[56:48] particular scripture is El
[56:51] Shi walk before me and be thou perfect
[56:54] and I will make my Covenant between me
[56:57] and thee and will multiply thee
[56:59] exceedingly and Abram fell on his face
[57:02] and God talked with him saying as for me
[57:04] behold my Covenant is with thee and thou
[57:07] shalt be a father of many
[57:10] nations so this Same
[57:13] Spirit the same
[57:16] elai this loving spirit that came to
[57:20] Abraham Was the Same
[57:22] Spirit and when Jesus said come unto me
[57:25] all ye labor and are heavy laden and I
[57:27] will give you rest there it is
[57:30] manifested itself later on and then you
[57:34] will be able to overcome if you really
[57:37] truly understand this El
[57:39] Shai then you'll be able to overcome
[57:41] when someone speaks evil of you when
[57:43] someone hates you when someone lies
[57:45] about you you'll speak positive things
[57:47] about that person and you'll get down on
[57:49] your knees and you'll cry out for
[57:52] Mercy for that person that's what else
[57:55] should I will will produce and the
[57:58] closest thing that I have ever seen to
[58:03] Eli This Love that Jesus had and this
[58:06] love that when God came to Abraham is
[58:09] the love of a mo mother to a
[58:13] child it's the closest thing to perfect
[58:15] love that I have ever seen when my
[58:18] daughter was born meline we took her
[58:22] home and Stephanie laid her on the bed
[58:25] and and Stephanie just started
[58:28] weeping she said she's so helpless she
[58:30] says I am completely
[58:33] responsible for this precious little
[58:37] baby I don't believe Brothers I don't
[58:40] believe that the love of a
[58:42] man even for our own child can compare
[58:46] to that love that a woman has when God
[58:51] separated man and a woman a woman had
[58:54] strength certain strengths and the man
[58:57] had certain strengths and he gave that
[59:00] love that El should die he gave that
[59:04] love to the
[59:06] woman it's something that she just has
[59:09] and me as a father I remember when when
[59:12] meline was born I mean I was just in
[59:14] love with her when Daniel was born the
[59:17] same thing the kid I was just like oh
[59:19] you know this this is he came out and
[59:22] and Stephanie was just so happy and
[59:24] here's the difference between a dad and
[59:26] a
[59:26] mom I picked him
[59:31] up and I turned him to the doctor and I
[59:34] said is he supposed to look that
[59:38] way he looks like
[59:42] Yoda except he's
[59:47] red I said are feet supposed to look
[59:49] like
[59:50] that Stephanie thought he was
[59:54] perfect my wife looked at that little
[59:56] boy and he was the most beautiful thing
[59:58] she had ever seen when I was born my dad
[1:00:02] looked at me picked me up saying thing
[1:00:04] and he
[1:00:05] says is this chin supposed to be like
[1:00:08] that made my mom
[1:00:13] cry there's
[1:00:15] this there's a difference and that love
[1:00:19] of a mother is just so beautiful Susanna
[1:00:21] Wesley she was the youngest of 25
[1:00:24] children how is that even
[1:00:28] possible my my
[1:00:30] sister she went to she had she was on
[1:00:34] her fifth child for for the sisters that
[1:00:36] have some children she was she was on
[1:00:38] her fifth child and and she thought she
[1:00:41] knew what was going on and and she went
[1:00:42] to the doctor and and the doctor said uh
[1:00:45] yes she said uh you're you're pregnant
[1:00:48] you're going to have a child and this
[1:00:50] will be your your fifth child um she
[1:00:54] saides and she said said well how many
[1:00:56] children are you planning on having she
[1:00:59] said
[1:01:05] three her husband Susanna Wesley's
[1:01:09] husband was Samuel
[1:01:10] Wesley and
[1:01:12] Susan Susanne Wesley's life was filled
[1:01:14] with hardships she and her husband had
[1:01:17] 19 children but nine of them died as
[1:01:20] infants two there was two sets of twins
[1:01:23] that died and then one of the babies
[1:01:25] died when the maid acally smothered
[1:01:28] it she was tasked so she was tasked with
[1:01:32] raising the remaining 10 children and it
[1:01:34] was under very very difficult
[1:01:36] circumstances when the children were
[1:01:38] young her husband who was a minister her
[1:01:40] husband left her after they had an
[1:01:43] argument and he was gone for over a
[1:01:48] year and she was left trying to provide
[1:01:51] for these children they were in a in a
[1:01:54] place that they and moved later on they
[1:01:57] moved and they started a church that he
[1:01:59] was he was placed in a church
[1:02:02] that
[1:02:04] hated their doctrines very a very
[1:02:07] liberal area and they were a
[1:02:09] conservative group and they they were
[1:02:11] under a very hostile environment so she
[1:02:13] didn't have the community she didn't
[1:02:15] have a husband that would take care of
[1:02:17] her and there she was watching over
[1:02:19] these kids when he was gone when her
[1:02:21] husband was gone she wrote him this
[1:02:24] letter she said a woman she said but I'm
[1:02:28] also the Mistress of a large family and
[1:02:30] though the superior charge of the souls
[1:02:32] contained it lies upon
[1:02:34] you yet your long absence I cannot but
[1:02:38] think but look upon every soul that you
[1:02:40] leave under my charge as a talent
[1:02:43] committed to me under a
[1:02:45] trust I am not a man or a minister yet
[1:02:49] as a mother and as a mistress wife I
[1:02:53] felt I ought to do more than I had yet
[1:02:57] done I resolved to begin with my own
[1:03:00] children in which I observed the
[1:03:03] following method I take such a
[1:03:04] proportion of time as I can spare every
[1:03:07] night to discourse with each Child Apart
[1:03:09] on Monday I talk with Molly on Tuesday
[1:03:11] with Hattie Wednesday with Nancy
[1:03:14] Thursday with Jackie Friday with Patty
[1:03:16] Saturday with Charles she took time with
[1:03:20] every child and even though Suzanne was
[1:03:22] doing everything that she could to feed
[1:03:24] the children she made this statement she
[1:03:26] said I am not a man or a minister yet as
[1:03:28] a mother I feel I ought to do more than
[1:03:31] I have yet
[1:03:33] done I resolved to begin with my own
[1:03:36] children and she felt that she wasn't
[1:03:39] doing enough as a Christian and look she
[1:03:42] was working her fingers to the bone no
[1:03:44] husband there no Community to help her
[1:03:48] and here she is with these 10 children
[1:03:51] doing everything that she can and you
[1:03:52] know what she says I haven't done enough
[1:03:56] she saysi can do
[1:03:57] more and instead as many people do they
[1:04:01] want to reach out to someone to
[1:04:05] outside maybe for their own benefit they
[1:04:08] want to start a
[1:04:09] Ministry over here or over there and
[1:04:13] they neglect the greatest need that's
[1:04:15] right under their nose and that's what
[1:04:16] Suzanne
[1:04:17] Wesley had she said that I'm going to
[1:04:22] start with my
[1:04:24] children and it changed the
[1:04:26] world her saying
[1:04:29] that in my opinion that was the greatest
[1:04:31] decision that she ever made was focusing
[1:04:35] right there on her family and she ended
[1:04:37] up it affected millions of people she
[1:04:40] took the time with every child to read
[1:04:43] them the Bible to pray with them she
[1:04:45] loved her children and she built that
[1:04:48] respect from the children for her and
[1:04:51] her husband finally returned to his
[1:04:52] family but he never provided he was
[1:04:55] never good
[1:04:57] husband he was a minister but he went to
[1:04:59] prison twice because of his financial
[1:05:02] issues all that time he was away from
[1:05:05] his family and when he was with his
[1:05:07] family he really wasn't a good dad to
[1:05:10] him 1 Corinthians 113 113 says this but
[1:05:14] I would have you know that the head of
[1:05:16] every man is Christ and the head of
[1:05:18] every woman is the man and the head of
[1:05:20] Christ is God so in the order of the
[1:05:22] household it puts the man as the head of
[1:05:24] the woman and suanna Wesley honored this
[1:05:29] she gave her husband the preeminence in
[1:05:31] the family it didn't matter to her that
[1:05:32] her husband wasn't living up to his
[1:05:34] responsibilities she had a
[1:05:36] responsibility and the word said this it
[1:05:39] doesn't it is not a qualifier if someone
[1:05:41] else is living up to their
[1:05:43] responsibilities as a Christian as if
[1:05:45] you have to live up to yours you have to
[1:05:47] live up to your responsibility no matter
[1:05:49] how someone else treats
[1:05:52] you she lived up to that and in in that
[1:05:56] it says that Christ is the head of the
[1:05:58] man and the man is the head of the woman
[1:06:00] so Brothers as we are husbands to our
[1:06:03] wives loving our wives we should act
[1:06:08] like we would want Christ to act to
[1:06:10] us he wants to hear us we want to we
[1:06:14] want him to hear us we want to be able
[1:06:16] to speak to him we want him to
[1:06:19] answer we want to have that loving
[1:06:21] relationship with our lord and there we
[1:06:25] are say okay I want this but I'm not
[1:06:27] going to give it to my
[1:06:28] wife we should be that loving caring
[1:06:32] husband as Christ is to the
[1:06:36] Man 1 Peter chapter 3 says this likewise
[1:06:40] ye wives be in subjection verse one
[1:06:42] likewise you wives be in subjection to
[1:06:44] your own husbands that if that if any
[1:06:46] obey not the word they also May without
[1:06:51] the word be won by the conversation of
[1:06:53] the wives amen
[1:06:56] while they behold your Chase
[1:06:58] conversation coupled with fear so a wife
[1:07:00] can win her husband to the Lord just by
[1:07:03] her
[1:07:04] behavior who's adoring let it not be
[1:07:07] outward adoring of plated hair and of
[1:07:09] wearing of gold or putting on of apparel
[1:07:11] but let the hidden man of the
[1:07:13] heart in that which is not corruptible
[1:07:16] even the ornament of the meek and quiet
[1:07:18] Spirit which is in the sight of God of
[1:07:21] great
[1:07:23] price for after this man in the old time
[1:07:26] the holy women also who trusted in God
[1:07:29] adorned
[1:07:30] thems being Sub in subjection to their
[1:07:33] own husbands even as Sarah we just
[1:07:35] talked about Sarah and
[1:07:37] Abraham even as Sarah obeyed Abraham
[1:07:40] calling him Lord whose daughters you
[1:07:45] are as long as you do well and are not
[1:07:48] afraid with any
[1:07:51] amazement Peter here is saying you're a
[1:07:53] daughter of this this woman that lived
[1:07:56] over a thousand years
[1:07:58] ago and you should you are her daughter
[1:08:02] so you can have that same faith if you
[1:08:04] follow these even as Sarah obeyed
[1:08:06] Abraham calling him Lord whose daughters
[1:08:08] you are as long as you do well you are
[1:08:10] not afraid with any amazement likewise
[1:08:12] you husbands dwell with them according
[1:08:14] to knowledge giving honor unto the wife
[1:08:17] as unto the weaker vessel that word
[1:08:19] weaker vessel is
[1:08:21] physical the man's bigger and stronger
[1:08:24] and as being heirs together of the grace
[1:08:26] of life that your prayers be not
[1:08:28] hindered so if you're not treating your
[1:08:30] wife correctly if you're you're
[1:08:31] bickering and you're arguing then your
[1:08:33] prayers Brothers we're talking about
[1:08:36] husbands then your prayers won't even be
[1:08:39] heard by
[1:08:41] God we like to say the women we can we
[1:08:43] can say a lot of things that a a woman
[1:08:45] is disqualified as far as her prayers
[1:08:47] being
[1:08:48] heard but if the man's not treating his
[1:08:51] wife like he should brothers our prayers
[1:08:54] aren't hurt either
[1:08:57] family
[1:08:59] starts see how important a family Unity
[1:09:02] is that love one another it's not just
[1:09:06] it's not just not doing things it's not
[1:09:09] just giving up drinking or smoking or
[1:09:11] whatever it is we also have to work
[1:09:16] together as a family unit as parents so
[1:09:19] our very prayers will be
[1:09:22] heard and we understand we're too
[1:09:25] different
[1:09:26] people men and
[1:09:29] women Brothers you know when our wives
[1:09:33] say you don't understand
[1:09:36] me they're
[1:09:38] right we don't understand them they're
[1:09:42] hard to
[1:09:43] understand and it's we are hard for them
[1:09:46] to understand but we love each other and
[1:09:50] we work together for these things
[1:09:53] Susanna Wesley was a good mother and
[1:09:54] even though her husband had problems she
[1:09:57] didn't waver she didn't complain she
[1:09:59] didn't divorce him their house was
[1:10:02] burned down
[1:10:03] twice young boy John Wesley almost died
[1:10:06] in one of those fires she had to
[1:10:09] separate her
[1:10:10] family because they didn't have a house
[1:10:12] to live in she had to put the kids in
[1:10:14] different homes and to make things worth
[1:10:16] they were as I said they were hated in
[1:10:18] that area because they because of their
[1:10:21] political and their religious
[1:10:23] views Samuel was was like a trump
[1:10:26] supporter preaching in like
[1:10:29] Seattle wasn't
[1:10:31] popular it wouldn't be well
[1:10:36] received but with her husband not being
[1:10:38] a good
[1:10:39] provider the people around her hating
[1:10:41] her and their doctrines and whatever
[1:10:43] they they were doing she still she kept
[1:10:45] her testimony and even with all of his
[1:10:48] Seminary education John Wesley Charles
[1:10:51] they they went to these
[1:10:52] highlevel seminaries and even with their
[1:10:56] great education that they have John
[1:10:58] Wesley said I learned more about
[1:11:00] Christianity from my mother than from
[1:11:02] all the theologians in
[1:11:04] England she raed she raised two of the
[1:11:07] greatest men that have ever walked the
[1:11:08] Earth in Charles and John Wesley and it
[1:11:10] started a Revival that swept the whole
[1:11:13] world John Wesley rode a horse all over
[1:11:18] Europe preaching the gospel sometimes
[1:11:20] four times a day preaching
[1:11:23] sermons and the spirit that was on
[1:11:26] Wesley to teach the
[1:11:29] people then spread from John Wesley and
[1:11:33] went around the world an exposition of
[1:11:36] the seven Church ages says
[1:11:38] this since the fifth age had brought a
[1:11:41] great dissemination of the word through
[1:11:42] printing the sixth age was quick to take
[1:11:46] advantage of it the age was the second
[1:11:48] stage of the restoration and as we have
[1:11:51] stated previously was the tassel age
[1:11:53] education abounded this was the age of
[1:11:56] intellectual Men Who Loved God and
[1:11:58] served him missionaries abounded around
[1:12:01] the world and spread all over the world
[1:12:04] abounded and the word spread all over
[1:12:06] the world it was an age of Brotherly
[1:12:09] Love it was an age of the open door and
[1:12:11] this was the age that John and Charles
[1:12:14] Wesley started they spearheaded it and
[1:12:18] it started from a mother teaching them
[1:12:22] at home
[1:12:25] Suzanne Wesley changed the
[1:12:28] world and it was
[1:12:32] hard biographer for Suzanne Wesley wrote
[1:12:35] this although she never preached a
[1:12:37] sermon or published a book or founded a
[1:12:39] church she is known as as the mother of
[1:12:42] methodism why because two of her sons
[1:12:45] John Wesley and Charles Wesley as
[1:12:47] children consciously or unconsciously
[1:12:49] will applied the example and teachings
[1:12:52] and circumstances of their home life
[1:12:56] what they learned at home they applied
[1:12:59] in their life and millions came to
[1:13:02] Christ through the meth Methodist Church
[1:13:04] it was the age of the open door and how
[1:13:07] much did those individual prayers and
[1:13:10] bible studies how much did they have to
[1:13:12] do with
[1:13:13] that when our
[1:13:15] children brother and sisters when our
[1:13:17] children hear our
[1:13:19] words when they see how we handle
[1:13:22] situations when they see us lose our
[1:13:24] temper it makes them lose their temper
[1:13:27] when they see us complaining about
[1:13:29] around the supper table it makes them
[1:13:31] complain when they see us wanting to get
[1:13:34] our way it makes them want to get their
[1:13:36] way it create our weaknesses create
[1:13:39] weaknesses in our
[1:13:42] children or when they hear us praying in
[1:13:44] private or when they see us studying our
[1:13:47] Bibles or when they when we're talking
[1:13:49] around the Lord about the Lord around
[1:13:52] the supper table that creates strength
[1:13:55] in our children when they see us handle
[1:13:57] a situation that in a way that may be
[1:13:59] the harder way but it was the right way
[1:14:02] that builds a character in our
[1:14:05] children my
[1:14:07] mom I never heard my mom complain about
[1:14:10] anything in my life and I never heard
[1:14:13] her she say she was
[1:14:16] tired she died brothers and sisters she
[1:14:20] died a
[1:14:22] terrible suffering death I've never seen
[1:14:25] seen anybody suffer like my mother
[1:14:26] suffered for days and weeks and
[1:14:30] months but she always kept her testimony
[1:14:34] from the time I was born until the time
[1:14:37] she passed away that woman had a
[1:14:40] testimony and it never wavered and it
[1:14:43] had an effect on us her four
[1:14:48] children every morning I was always the
[1:14:50] first one up Mom would squeeze me fresh
[1:14:52] grapefruit
[1:14:53] juice and and she she always make me a
[1:14:56] bowl of oatmeal and she'd she'd take the
[1:14:58] oatmeal and she'd put the brown sugar
[1:15:03] and then a thing of butter on the top
[1:15:06] and she wouldn't mix it in but she just
[1:15:07] put it right there and then she'd give
[1:15:09] it to me and I just loved it I would eat
[1:15:12] around all the way and then I'd get to
[1:15:15] the Sweet buttery stuff in the middle
[1:15:17] right and that was the last couple bites
[1:15:19] I just loved the way that she did that
[1:15:22] and it was early morning it was like
[1:15:24] 5:00 Rock would' be up and we'd be
[1:15:26] talking about the Lord and and just she
[1:15:30] would ask me little questions what what
[1:15:33] do you think about this and and it was
[1:15:36] just it was a precious time and it built
[1:15:40] a character in me from my
[1:15:43] mom my brother Jeremy is serving the
[1:15:46] lord and voice of God Recordings he's a
[1:15:49] man of
[1:15:50] integrity and he's honest he's doing
[1:15:53] everything that he can everything knows
[1:15:55] how to to get the message out to this
[1:15:58] Dying World my brother Adam he's
[1:16:00] preaching every Wednesday he is
[1:16:02] preaching to Inner
[1:16:03] City young
[1:16:06] people he's winning Souls these kids
[1:16:09] most of them almost none of them have
[1:16:10] dads or none of them have even met their
[1:16:12] dad some of them are 25 30 years
[1:16:16] old and Adam is
[1:16:19] teaching the Bible that they've never
[1:16:21] heard
[1:16:22] before and he's making a
[1:16:27] difference started with just a few
[1:16:29] people now there's like
[1:16:32] 70 of these boxers these Fighters coming
[1:16:36] on Wednesday night and he's winning
[1:16:38] these
[1:16:40] Souls my sister I mentioned her she's
[1:16:44] she's got five kids at least the last
[1:16:47] time we
[1:16:49] counted and she's one of the best
[1:16:51] Mothers I've ever
[1:16:53] seen she's stays home to raise the kids
[1:16:56] they made Financial sacrifices so she
[1:16:59] could be a mom to them and those kids
[1:17:02] are absolutely precious you talk about
[1:17:04] sweet kids and it's because they they
[1:17:07] got a mom that loves
[1:17:09] them I think all of this is a testimony
[1:17:12] to my mom and how she taught us and she
[1:17:16] made time with each of us and each one
[1:17:19] of us had that personal relationship
[1:17:21] with our
[1:17:23] mother and it produces something in the
[1:17:28] future it's so important our time is
[1:17:31] with our children our time with each
[1:17:34] other and I'll get to this in a minute
[1:17:36] but sisters you do not have to have
[1:17:39] biological children to be a
[1:17:41] mother I really don't think that has
[1:17:43] anything to do with it it is a spirit
[1:17:45] that God gave
[1:17:48] you it is
[1:17:50] that El
[1:17:52] Shai that is manifested
[1:17:56] in a woman of
[1:17:58] God and it is just it is without
[1:18:04] equal the Apostle Timothy we've all read
[1:18:08] the letters to
[1:18:11] Timothy when Paul writes both of his
[1:18:14] letters to the Corinthians his letter to
[1:18:16] the phiman his letters to the
[1:18:18] Thessalonians to the Romans to the
[1:18:20] Philippians to the Colossians both the
[1:18:22] letters to the Thessalonians and even
[1:18:24] the letter to the Hebrews Timothy's
[1:18:27] mentioned he listed at the
[1:18:31] beginning that he seems to
[1:18:35] co-author
[1:18:37] Corinthians second Corinthians
[1:18:39] Philippians Colossians both the letters
[1:18:41] to Thessalonians and to philimon seems
[1:18:44] to be a co-author on those
[1:18:47] Timothy went before Paul to certain
[1:18:50] places probably to prepare for Paul's
[1:18:52] arrival and Paul took him with him when
[1:18:54] he went to Corinth and thessalonica and
[1:18:56] to Macedonia to preach the gospel of
[1:18:58] Christ and eventually Paul placed
[1:19:02] Timothy to be the pastor of the Ephesian
[1:19:04] church one of the most advanced churches
[1:19:07] in the New Testament you read the book
[1:19:08] of Ephesians and it is deep and it is
[1:19:12] powerful and
[1:19:14] Timothy was placed to be Pastor over
[1:19:17] that
[1:19:18] church this man Timothy was one of the
[1:19:20] greatest Servants of the Lord in the
[1:19:23] whole new testimony and he was unique
[1:19:26] because his mom was Jewish and his dad
[1:19:28] was
[1:19:29] Greek and Timothy was one of these new
[1:19:31] Believers one of these new converts and
[1:19:34] he may not have looked at looked or act
[1:19:36] like one of the traditional Jews but
[1:19:37] Timothy had a gift that Paul identifies
[1:19:41] and Paul identifies where this gift
[1:19:43] comes from 1 Timothy chapter
[1:19:48] 1 Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the
[1:19:51] will of God according to the promise of
[1:19:53] life
[1:19:55] which is in Christ Jesus to Timothy my
[1:19:57] dearly beloved
[1:19:59] Son he's calling him Timothy his son in
[1:20:01] the
[1:20:02] gospel to Timothy my dearly beloved Son
[1:20:05] grace mercy and peace from God the
[1:20:07] father in Christ Jesus our
[1:20:09] lord I thank God whom I served from my
[1:20:12] forefathers with pure conscience that
[1:20:14] without ceasing I have remembrance of
[1:20:16] thee in my prayers night and day greatly
[1:20:19] Desiring to see thee being mindful of
[1:20:21] thy tears that I may be filled with joy
[1:20:23] look at the relationship ship that
[1:20:25] Timothy and Paul had the greatest of all
[1:20:28] the apostles in Paul with this man
[1:20:31] Timothy Timothy must have been a man of
[1:20:34] impeccable
[1:20:37] character verse five when I call to
[1:20:41] remembrance the unfeigned faith that is
[1:20:44] in thee which dwelt
[1:20:49] first brother Jeremy am I in the right
[1:20:51] spot
[1:20:58] okay glad I had your
[1:21:01] attention First
[1:21:04] Timothy that's second Timothy I'm sorry
[1:21:08] second
[1:21:10] Timothy verse one let's go to let's go
[1:21:12] down to verse
[1:21:15] five when I call to
[1:21:17] remembrance see that's why you gotta use
[1:21:20] the good old Bible you know and and not
[1:21:25] and not the
[1:21:26] electronics all the time they are a
[1:21:33] blessing verse five when I call to
[1:21:35] remembrance the unfeigned faith that is
[1:21:37] in thee which dwelt first in my
[1:21:39] grandmother in thy grandmother Lois and
[1:21:42] in thy mother Eunice I am persuaded I am
[1:21:45] persuaded that is in thee
[1:21:47] also wherefore I put thee in remembrance
[1:21:50] that thou stir up the gift of God which
[1:21:53] is in thee by putting on of my hands for
[1:21:55] God hath not given us the spirit of fear
[1:21:58] but of power and of love and of a sound
[1:22:00] mind Paul is saying that the gift that's
[1:22:02] in Timothy was first in his grandmother
[1:22:06] Lois and then in his mother Eunice and
[1:22:09] that gift was passed down from eating
[1:22:13] oatmeal in the
[1:22:15] morning and talking about the
[1:22:18] Lord from studying the Bible down to
[1:22:23] Unice and then Unice had learned from
[1:22:26] her mother and she was serving
[1:22:29] oatmeal to her little boy
[1:22:33] Timothy and she was talking about the
[1:22:35] Lord and she was talking about the
[1:22:37] Messiah and she was she was teaching
[1:22:39] this young man about the word of God and
[1:22:42] she was instilling not only the word in
[1:22:45] him but this great character because she
[1:22:48] had a great character she had a gift as
[1:22:51] the Apostle said and here it is and it
[1:22:53] goes right into Timothy the
[1:22:57] boy and he changed the world he was one
[1:23:01] of those first
[1:23:03] ones pastoring one of the greatest
[1:23:06] churches that's ever
[1:23:08] been close with one of the greatest
[1:23:11] Apostles that ever
[1:23:15] been I wonder how it was growing up in
[1:23:17] Timothy's
[1:23:19] House El Shai must have been present in
[1:23:21] that home really to produce such a great
[1:23:24] man
[1:23:28] the
[1:23:29] um this word
[1:23:32] elai to
[1:23:34] me just hearing sister Jessica singing
[1:23:37] it and and being and listening to it
[1:23:39] over the past day how
[1:23:42] beautiful this these words are and what
[1:23:45] it represents that it's this God that
[1:23:48] comes to the helpless person and this
[1:23:51] God is able to pour out that spirit and
[1:23:54] that love and to take care of that
[1:23:56] person and to nurture nurture him up
[1:23:59] comes to Abraham and says you're Barren
[1:24:01] Sarah you're Barren I know that but look
[1:24:04] at the
[1:24:05] Spirit really that our mothers have
[1:24:08] come and give them a
[1:24:11] child give them covenants give them a
[1:24:14] promise encourage our hearts encourage
[1:24:17] us to do great
[1:24:20] things but today we don't see that elai
[1:24:23] anymore now we see that it's it's a it's
[1:24:26] a shame many times for a woman to have a
[1:24:29] child to kill it before it's
[1:24:32] born it's a
[1:24:34] shame for a woman to have like my sister
[1:24:37] to have five of these beautiful little
[1:24:39] babies little little kids running
[1:24:43] around but she's proud of
[1:24:45] them I'm proud of them
[1:24:50] amen and there's not time that's spent
[1:24:54] we all we all want to blame the world
[1:24:56] brothers and sisters if you send we want
[1:24:59] to blame the school system if you send a
[1:25:01] bad kid to school at 8:00 in the morning
[1:25:05] you're going to get a bad kid when he
[1:25:08] gets off the bus at
[1:25:09] 3:30 but if you send a good kid to
[1:25:13] school one that has come up in the
[1:25:17] gospel one that understands the word one
[1:25:19] that has good parents if you send that
[1:25:22] kid to school not only is is the kid
[1:25:24] going to come back a good kid but that
[1:25:26] kid's going to make other good
[1:25:28] kids and he's going to have or she's
[1:25:31] going to have an influence on the
[1:25:34] others that Spirit of the family and of
[1:25:37] the parents is going to continue
[1:25:41] on and as I said in closing we can have
[1:25:45] the musicians
[1:25:47] come a woman brothers and sisters
[1:25:52] doesn't a mother doesn't doesn't mean
[1:25:54] that she has to have biological children
[1:25:57] you can still have that Spirit of a
[1:26:00] mother as a nurturing that elai Spirit
[1:26:04] where you're taking care of of of a
[1:26:06] child or or of someone else that
[1:26:08] nurturing way my aunt Jacqueline she
[1:26:11] never she was never married she never
[1:26:13] had children but she's quick to tell you
[1:26:15] that she has 10 children because that's
[1:26:18] how many grandmothers she had or how
[1:26:20] many Grand child children she has and
[1:26:23] she loves every one of us like a mother
[1:26:25] loves their
[1:26:27] children and we're thankful all of us
[1:26:30] are for the love that we
[1:26:35] have and it's that Spirit of el Shai
[1:26:38] coming out in a woman and she's always
[1:26:42] the Lord's always willing to bring that
[1:26:46] precious little baby which is you and me
[1:26:50] into his bosom to take care of us
[1:26:55] there's one last mother that I'll
[1:26:57] mention and that's Mary the greatest
[1:27:01] mother that has ever lived in my
[1:27:04] opinion she was she had this child
[1:27:08] brothers and sisters it wasn't even
[1:27:12] hers it wasn't Joseph's child this was
[1:27:15] God took a fertilized seed and placed it
[1:27:20] into this woman and she had that child
[1:27:23] she loved that child like her own she
[1:27:26] cared for him Joseph was a good dad he
[1:27:29] passed away at a at a um when when Jesus
[1:27:32] was
[1:27:33] young but it shows you that that love of
[1:27:37] a mother goes far beyond
[1:27:40] biology that love of a mother is it's
[1:27:44] it's a love of God is what it is and as
[1:27:46] I
[1:27:47] said it's not
[1:27:51] from the world this comes directly from
[1:27:55] the Lord
[1:27:58] Jesus I want to I want to have one I
[1:28:01] want to read one more scripture I think
[1:28:02] I have a few minutes Ephesians chapter 1
[1:28:05] verse one Paul an apostle of Jesus

[1:28:27] foundation of the world that we should
[1:28:29] be holy and Without Blame before him in
[1:28:32] love having predestinated us unto the
[1:28:36] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[1:28:39] himself according to the good pleasure
[1:28:42] of his will we consider ourselves Sons
[1:28:46] and Daughters of Christ but it says here
