[54:13] on rebuilding the tabernacle
[54:16] of david rebuilding the tabernacle

[54:24] their peace this is verse 13 if you have
[54:26] your bible
[54:28] james answered saying
[54:30] men and brethren hearken unto me
[54:33] simeon hath declared how god at the
[54:35] first did visit the gentiles and here's
[54:38] his purpose to take out of them a people
[54:42] for his name
[54:45] and to this agree the words of the
[54:47] prophets as it is written
[54:49] after this
[54:51] i will return
[54:52] and will build again the tabernacle of
[54:54] david which has fallen down
[54:57] and i will build again the ruins thereof
[54:59] and i will set it up
[55:02] verse 17 that the residue of men might
[55:05] seek after the lord
[55:07] and that all the gentiles upon whom my
[55:11] name is called saith the lord who doeth
[55:14] all these things
[55:16] known unto god are all his works from
[55:18] the beginning of the world wherefore my

[56:18] he says when you're passed over then you
[56:20] shall drive out all
[56:22] the inhabitants of the land from before
[56:24] you destroy
[56:26] all
[56:26] their pictures destroy
[56:29] all their molten images
[56:31] and quite pluck down
[56:33] all
[56:34] their high places
[56:36] and you shall dispossess that's an
[56:39] important word
[56:40] the inhabitants of the land and
[56:43] dwell
[56:44] therein that's god's ultimate purpose
[56:47] and here's the colon you see this here
[56:49] here's a promise
[56:50] for i
[56:51] jehovah have given you laos the people
[56:55] the family of god
[56:57] the land
[56:58] to possess it
[57:00] now here's a big uh condition but
[57:06] if you will not drive out the
[57:08] inhabitants of the land from before you
[57:11] then it shall come to pass that those
[57:14] which you let remain
[57:17] shall be of them shall be pricks in your
[57:19] eyes
[57:20] and thorns and your sides and shall vex
[57:23] you
[57:24] in the land wherein you dwell
[57:26] moreover it shall come to pass
[57:29] that i shall do unto you
[57:32] as i thought
[57:33] to do unto them
[57:35] let's pray lord jesus we
[57:37] we're so grateful lord of your grace
[57:39] today
[57:40] lord we have a heavy heart
[57:42] lord and sometimes the word has a way to
[57:44] do that father
[57:46] lord your word comes as the bible says
[57:49] that the word of god is profitable for
[57:52] teaching
[57:53] lord for reproof for rebuke
[57:56] lord that we may stand perfect lord
[57:59] jesus
[58:00] i pray god that you would come this
[58:01] morning lord by your spirit not the
[58:03] spirit of a man
[58:05] lord i pray that
[58:07] as i just right now lord step away i
[58:10] step aside lord and i'm just asking you
[58:13] to take over
[58:14] granted lord and speak to every heart we
[58:16] pray in jesus name amen amen you can be
[58:19] seated this morning
[58:26] we have a lot we want to get to i've
[58:28] asked for aaron
[58:30] garrett to minister for us tonight so i
[58:32] don't have this evening service and lord
[58:34] put that upon my heart looking forward
[58:36] to that but i have a lot i don't have i
[58:38] can't get to tonight so i'm not going to
[58:41] go into your time brother aaron but um
[58:42] i'm going to take my time is that okay
[58:46] i want to back up here
[58:48] in acts and we're just gonna lay a
[58:49] little foundation we could be
[58:51] uh theological about this
[58:54] uh this prophecy here in acts 15 but
[58:57] we're not really doing that today um so
[59:00] we just want to cover it just real
[59:02] briefly here i want you to look at verse
[59:04] 16 again because this was a verse uh 14
[59:07] again
[59:08] because this was the this this made
[59:11] meaning or the purpose
[59:12] of the plan of god
[59:14] and what we find in numbers this was
[59:17] prophetic prophesied and it was a
[59:19] fulfillment of christ come when christ
[59:22] came
[59:23] simeon hath declared how that god at
[59:25] first
[59:26] notice verse 14 did visit the gentiles
[59:30] and here's why
[59:31] to take out of them
[59:34] a people
[59:36] for his name
[59:37] now that word is loosely used we say
[59:40] that often gentile and sometimes that
[59:43] would maybe someone would say well what
[59:44] are we those are jews they're jews and
[59:46] then there's gentiles how are we a
[59:48] gentile
[59:49] that gentile word simply means nations
[59:52] so anytime you read it in the bible the
[59:55] bible uses two different words here and
[59:57] when he says here god notice
[1:00:00] god
[1:00:01] hath simeon hath declared how god at the
[1:00:04] first did visit the gentiles to take out
[1:00:08] of them
[1:00:09] now when you look at that word film he's
[1:00:12] speaking of gentiles nations
[1:00:15] and then he says a people for his name
[1:00:18] that people word people is leos which
[1:00:20] means the jew knew that meant him
[1:00:23] specifically so this was a conflict how
[1:00:26] is god going to take his people were
[1:00:28] your people or abraham's seed is what
[1:00:30] they told him
[1:00:32] but the term gentile doesn't really
[1:00:34] describe who someone is but it really
[1:00:36] just means who you're not and that means
[1:00:39] that you're not a jew a gentile is one
[1:00:41] who belongs to the nations to the in to
[1:00:44] the group of people who are not jews
[1:00:46] that's me and that's you the bible has a
[1:00:48] lot to say about this but god was
[1:00:50] prophesying here that the tabernacle of
[1:00:53] david would not just consist of jews but
[1:00:57] it would be
[1:00:58] the whole world
[1:00:59] that other nations
[1:01:01] we would be grafted in
[1:01:03] and you know as we said before we've
[1:01:05] been grafted in we're the you know we're
[1:01:08] we're the we're the side event the main
[1:01:10] show
[1:01:11] is god revealing himself to his people
[1:01:14] to his brethren
[1:01:15] amen that's a whole nother sermon there
[1:01:17] but we we won't get into that today
[1:01:19] verse 16 and he says and after this i
[1:01:21] will return and will build again the
[1:01:24] tabernacle of david which is fallen down
[1:01:27] in other words you've rejected it this
[1:01:29] is they rejected christ this was who was
[1:01:31] christ as we preached last sunday he had
[1:01:33] the key to the house of david he was the
[1:01:37] temple amen that they that they were
[1:01:39] looking for he was the fulfillment of
[1:01:41] all of the prophets
[1:01:44] we notice here he says that which has
[1:01:46] fallen down and i will build again
[1:01:49] the ruins thereof and i will set it up
[1:01:53] so we know that god originally
[1:01:56] had this in his mind that god was going
[1:01:58] to bring out a people who were separated
[1:02:02] unto himself now separation is a word
[1:02:05] that we don't really
[1:02:07] like very much none of us like
[1:02:09] separation we could say covet has
[1:02:11] separated us no one likes
[1:02:12] separation but there's a godly
[1:02:15] separation that god calls for every
[1:02:18] believer
[1:02:20] and and it doesn't just refer to jews
[1:02:23] but god's family the bible says you're a
[1:02:26] peculiar people you're to be separated
[1:02:30] unto the lord and you know when you
[1:02:32] really serve the lord jesus and i'm
[1:02:34] going to be practical this morning so
[1:02:36] don't don't lose me here this morning i
[1:02:38] just want to speak real direct to you
[1:02:40] this morning
[1:02:41] there's there's when you have the power
[1:02:43] of god in your life when christ has
[1:02:45] really regenerated you by the baptism of
[1:02:48] the holy ghost you don't have to
[1:02:49] separate yourself
[1:02:53] the word does the separating you know i
[1:02:55] learned that as a 16 year old boy when i
[1:02:57] gave my heart to the lord and i came to
[1:02:59] all of my friends now my friends were
[1:03:01] not worldly friends they were church
[1:03:02] friends and you know i came to my
[1:03:05] friends with this and the lord had done
[1:03:07] something uh had started working on my
[1:03:09] heart at 11 12 13 at 16 you know i came
[1:03:12] in a service and the lord just anointed
[1:03:15] faith inside of my heart and i said i
[1:03:17] want to give my whole life to jesus i
[1:03:19] want to sell out to the lord i want to i
[1:03:21] want to dedicate my myself i want to
[1:03:24] give you my whole being i don't want to
[1:03:25] hold any of me back
[1:03:28] and i gave my heart to jesus and he
[1:03:30] still has it this morning
[1:03:32] and and but you know what what's amazing
[1:03:34] is that
[1:03:35] is that i i thought i'd you know i'd
[1:03:36] come to my friends and i thought we were
[1:03:38] all going to serve the lord together you
[1:03:39] know everybody this is all one for one
[1:03:41] and one for all
[1:03:44] you know the problem was is that i
[1:03:45] didn't want to do the things they did
[1:03:47] anymore
[1:03:48] i didn't want to to sneak out and and
[1:03:50] you know and do things behind my parents
[1:03:52] back i didn't want to listen to that
[1:03:53] kind of worldly music anymore
[1:03:57] because there had been a change inside
[1:03:58] of me i was looking for something
[1:04:00] different i wanted to be changed and i
[1:04:02] wanted it to i wanted everybody to get
[1:04:05] what i got
[1:04:07] and you can only say that when the lord
[1:04:09] really does something for you and you
[1:04:10] could sometimes you don't know how to
[1:04:12] pray for somebody and you look at
[1:04:13] someone who's lost or maybe bound you
[1:04:15] don't really know how to say lord i you
[1:04:17] don't really know what to say so
[1:04:19] sometimes you just say lord do for them
[1:04:21] what you did for me
[1:04:23] because i know you did something real in
[1:04:24] me and you could do it to them
[1:04:27] but separation occurs when you come to
[1:04:29] christ there's something god says i want
[1:04:31] you to be
[1:04:33] separate even in second corinthians
[1:04:34] chapter six
[1:04:36] the bible says come out from among them
[1:04:38] verse 17 word i'm just going to quote it
[1:04:40] to you
[1:04:41] come out from among them and be separate
[1:04:43] says the lord do not touch what is
[1:04:46] unclean and i will receive you i will be
[1:04:48] a father to you and you shall be my sons
[1:04:51] and daughters i want to be his son
[1:04:53] and you want to say lord i want to be
[1:04:55] your daughter i want to be your son this
[1:04:56] morning
[1:04:58] so the bible begins this and we don't
[1:05:00] have time to to to minister this entire
[1:05:03] sermon on separation but the scripture
[1:05:06] is really clear in leviticus it says
[1:05:08] you'll not walk in the statutes of the
[1:05:10] nations which i am casting out before
[1:05:13] you i am the lord your god who has
[1:05:15] separated you from the peoples you shall
[1:05:18] be holy to me for i am the lord for i
[1:05:21] the lord i'm holy and have separated you
[1:05:23] from the peoples that you should be mine
[1:05:27] when israel deuteronomy entered canaan
[1:05:29] now notice this is what god commands
[1:05:31] them he says for you're a holy people to
[1:05:34] the lord your god the lord your god has
[1:05:36] chosen you to be a people
[1:05:39] for himself
[1:05:42] a special
[1:05:43] treasure
[1:05:44] above all the peoples on the face of the
[1:05:47] earth
[1:05:50] says that again he says that he will set
[1:05:52] you high above all nations which he has
[1:05:54] made in praise and name and an honor
[1:05:56] that you may be a holy people to the
[1:05:58] lord your god just as he has
[1:06:00] spoken
[1:06:02] in first kings 8 53 says you separated
[1:06:05] them from among all the people of the
[1:06:08] earth to be your inheritance as you
[1:06:09] spoke by your servant moses when you
[1:06:11] brought our fathers out of egypt oh lord
[1:06:15] god
[1:06:16] so god had chosen them to be a special
[1:06:19] people
[1:06:20] a peculiar nation the jews were separate
[1:06:23] they were different there was to be no
[1:06:25] mixing
[1:06:29] there was to be no mindy no moldy no
[1:06:31] mixing together like you'd mix up a
[1:06:33] piece of clay because they were
[1:06:35] different there was a different quality
[1:06:37] there was they had been chosen they had
[1:06:39] been purchased they had been bought with
[1:06:41] a price
[1:06:43] they weren't to marry intermingle their
[1:06:46] marriages they were to marry their
[1:06:47] people
[1:06:48] they were to marry within their people
[1:06:50] and any time that we could we could give
[1:06:52] you story after story after story of how
[1:06:55] god's family went outside of the
[1:06:57] covenant of what god gave them to marry
[1:07:00] people from the world and the
[1:07:02] destruction and the collateral damage
[1:07:04] that it that it caused
[1:07:06] that it would be years and years and
[1:07:09] years of catastrophe after catastrophe
[1:07:13] and god's people today god's
[1:07:16] family god's elected
[1:07:19] we're no different because we've been
[1:07:21] redeemed by the blood of the lamb we've
[1:07:23] been purchased can you say amen this
[1:07:25] morning
[1:07:26] that means we're to be different but not
[1:07:28] just different we're to be separate
[1:07:33] we're to be separate
[1:07:35] hebrews 7 26 for such a high priest was
[1:07:37] fitting
[1:07:38] for us who is holy harmless undefiled
[1:07:41] separate from sinners and has become
[1:07:43] higher than the heavens notice what he
[1:07:45] says here in titus 2 verse 13 jesus
[1:07:47] christ gave himself for us that he might
[1:07:50] redeem us from every lawless deed and
[1:07:52] purify for himself his own special
[1:07:55] people zealous for good works
[1:07:58] i love this one this is my favorite in
[1:08:00] first peter two verse nine but you
[1:08:02] are a chosen generation
[1:08:05] a royal priesthood a holy nation
[1:08:09] gentiles
[1:08:11] not just a holy jew but a holy people a
[1:08:14] chosen separate elected predestinated
[1:08:17] seed
[1:08:21] he says you're you're a holy nation a
[1:08:23] special people
[1:08:24] who wants
[1:08:25] or not a people
[1:08:27] but are now the people of god
[1:08:30] who had not obtained mercy but now have
[1:08:33] obtained
[1:08:34] mercy
[1:08:36] we know the message of the hour what was
[1:08:38] the seventh angel's message what was he
[1:08:40] crying in revelations 18 come out of her
[1:08:45] come out of her
[1:08:47] that harlot system come out of her my
[1:08:50] people
[1:08:52] lest you share in her sins unless you
[1:08:54] receive of her plagues
[1:08:57] so god had something he said i want you
[1:08:59] to be separate i want you to be
[1:09:01] different there should be no mixing
[1:09:03] there should be no mixed marriages
[1:09:05] your friendships even the bible says
[1:09:07] that the believer is not to be unequally
[1:09:09] yoked even in business you think it
[1:09:12] wouldn't apply to marriage
[1:09:14] not to make an affinity or a league
[1:09:16] that's what exactly what brother adam
[1:09:18] taught he said you you christian
[1:09:20] businessman god's made you different you
[1:09:22] don't you don't run your business by the
[1:09:24] principles of the world
[1:09:29] but but god says i want you to be
[1:09:31] different you're to be a holy nation a
[1:09:33] separate
[1:09:35] people
[1:09:37] we notice here he says this in
[1:09:40] in numbers we want to come back to this
[1:09:41] and i'm just going to take my time with
[1:09:43] this here in numbers 33 says the lord
[1:09:46] spake unto moses in the plains of moab i
[1:09:48] put these on the screen so that you
[1:09:50] could just follow along real closely
[1:09:51] with me he says the lord spoke unto
[1:09:54] moses in the plains of moab
[1:09:56] now if you go read numbers chapter 3 if
[1:09:59] you go read the beginning of this
[1:10:00] numbers 33 it's a chronological list of
[1:10:03] the encampments all the way through the
[1:10:05] wilderness and you could read about it
[1:10:07] they camped here then they picked up
[1:10:08] then they moved here then they moved
[1:10:09] here then they moved here it was a
[1:10:11] journey one that took much longer than
[1:10:12] it should have but it was a journey and
[1:10:15] they finally come here they are
[1:10:17] to come to canaan this was god's promise
[1:10:20] this was god's promise to abraham and
[1:10:22] his seed this was god's
[1:10:25] this was god's people's inheritance it's
[1:10:27] a type of the holy ghost it's a type of
[1:10:30] every gift every
[1:10:32] every blessing every promise that god
[1:10:35] has given to the believer
[1:10:38] and and here they come to the border of
[1:10:40] their inheritance and god as moses we
[1:10:43] know doesn't doesn't go into the land
[1:10:45] god told him he wasn't going to be
[1:10:46] allowed to go in but joshua was going to
[1:10:49] lead them in and joshua was not he who
[1:10:51] was joshua he was a type of the holy
[1:10:53] ghost
[1:10:54] that's what brother branham said he was
[1:10:56] a type of the holy ghost
[1:10:58] and so so
[1:11:01] moses the bible says that moses
[1:11:03] instructs them they're they're on this
[1:11:04] side they're not in they haven't crossed
[1:11:07] jordan yet they've not went into canaan
[1:11:09] yet they've not crossed over and moses
[1:11:12] who's moses the prophet he's going to
[1:11:14] give them the word he's going to give
[1:11:16] them the instructions
[1:11:19] and god says by moses in the plains of
[1:11:22] moab this is the last one near jericho
[1:11:24] saying speak unto the children of israel
[1:11:28] and say unto them this is this is the
[1:11:30] word of god
[1:11:31] he says in speaking to the children of
[1:11:33] israel and say unto them when you're
[1:11:36] past over jordan
[1:11:38] into the land of canaan then
[1:11:41] you shall drive out all the inhabitants
[1:11:45] of the land from before you destroy all
[1:11:47] their pictures destroy all their molten
[1:11:50] images and quite pluck down all their
[1:11:52] high places
[1:11:54] and you shall dispossess the inhabitants
[1:11:57] of the land and dwell therein for i have
[1:12:00] given you the land to possess it now
[1:12:02] these were heathens these were these
[1:12:04] canaanites now remember what god says i
[1:12:06] think it's in deuteronomy he says not
[1:12:08] for the righteousness of you that i that
[1:12:10] i'm using you what was israel going to
[1:12:13] be they were going to be a weapon
[1:12:16] they were going to be a weapon in the
[1:12:17] hands of god to destroy a wicked people
[1:12:20] now we could take time to show you how
[1:12:22] wicked the canaanites were but we're not
[1:12:24] going to do that this morning but the
[1:12:26] canaanites were a wicked people
[1:12:28] uh uh just even even just the the sexual
[1:12:31] immorality
[1:12:33] of of canaan in the temple in in the
[1:12:36] places of worship
[1:12:38] was more than i could even say here in a
[1:12:40] mixed audience but if you go read your
[1:12:41] bible it was a wicked people people look
[1:12:44] at the scripture and say wow god is it's
[1:12:46] genocide god's going in there just
[1:12:48] wiping out everybody well this was a god
[1:12:50] had promised and promised and promised
[1:12:51] and warned and warned and warned this is
[1:12:54] the people who hated god
[1:12:56] despised god very much like our culture
[1:12:58] american culture today america is not a
[1:13:01] christian
[1:13:02] culture it's a secular atheistic culture
[1:13:05] but where did that start you know you
[1:13:07] can go back to the age of enlightenment
[1:13:09] and say what was the age of
[1:13:10] enlightenment it was it was
[1:13:12] the enlightenment was sent from god for
[1:13:14] a purpose but what did it bring even men
[1:13:17] like isaac newton and you can go in and
[1:13:19] study the the that with when mine began
[1:13:22] when the ma when the mind of man began
[1:13:24] to rationalize and thought that they
[1:13:26] could figure it out that's the age of
[1:13:28] the daunting of invention i'm thankful
[1:13:30] for it i'm thankful for modern invention
[1:13:32] i'm thankful for modern medicine i'm
[1:13:34] thankful that that we don't live we live
[1:13:36] on this side
[1:13:37] of the of man subduing the earth i'm
[1:13:40] glad we live on this side
[1:13:42] you know in the ages before they were
[1:13:44] bleeding people because they didn't know
[1:13:46] where diseases came from i'm glad i
[1:13:47] don't live in that day
[1:13:50] it's a lot you should be thankful for
[1:13:53] but but but man the enlightenment of man
[1:13:56] what what started brother adam said
[1:13:58] anytime man he says the further he goes
[1:14:00] towards civilization education he says
[1:14:02] the further he goes away from god
[1:14:06] oh i began to think about this and i
[1:14:08] thought you know here were these people
[1:14:10] and and these were canaanites they had
[1:14:12] high places notice they had molten
[1:14:14] images they had pictures they had groves
[1:14:17] the bible speaks of these uh altars the
[1:14:19] bell the altar of belle and the altar of
[1:14:21] asteroth and the god of el and the god
[1:14:24] of nebu and you could go and read about
[1:14:26] all these false gods well it's amazing i
[1:14:29] was we were having a just a little time
[1:14:31] with the family yesterday and i said to
[1:14:33] my children i said where do you think
[1:14:35] where did this come from where you know
[1:14:38] when you take man just man and of
[1:14:40] himself if you separate him from
[1:14:42] religion
[1:14:43] you take even the the sentinel island if
[1:14:46] you're familiar with the sentinel island
[1:14:47] and the sentinel people it's a aborigine
[1:14:49] island that a missionary just recently
[1:14:51] tried to go there on a canoe and was
[1:14:53] killed these are people these are
[1:14:55] complete uh who brother adam said in the
[1:14:57] millennium the but the word the gospel
[1:14:59] would go to the heathen those who never
[1:15:01] had a chance to hear of the gospel of
[1:15:03] jesus christ the whole world will hear
[1:15:08] and and you hear today and you hear over
[1:15:11] and over and over and over and over and
[1:15:12] over and over again that's why jesus
[1:15:15] says that the men of nineveh will rise
[1:15:16] up in judgment of this generation they
[1:15:18] didn't have a bible in nineveh yet they
[1:15:20] repented at the preaching of jonah
[1:15:24] yeah this nation is heard preaching and
[1:15:25] preaching and preaching in sermons and
[1:15:27] sermons and sermons and they sit in
[1:15:29] lasciviousness and sin
[1:15:32] but the sin no people with no god yet
[1:15:34] they have
[1:15:35] yet
[1:15:36] pictures will show you they they have a
[1:15:38] temple
[1:15:39] they worship gods
[1:15:42] they're religious they're spiritual
[1:15:44] where did they learn that
[1:15:47] where did where did man learn that from
[1:15:49] where did he learn to be religious
[1:15:52] where did cain even cain and abel there
[1:15:55] was something even in the very beginning
[1:15:57] that is an eight in every human being
[1:16:01] there is something inside of everybody
[1:16:04] that you were made to worship
[1:16:08] are you with me here this morning
[1:16:10] it's inside of every single boy little
[1:16:12] boy or little girl little baby that's
[1:16:14] born you don't teach them that there's
[1:16:16] something inside of them because they're
[1:16:18] created in the image of god they are
[1:16:20] created to worship god there's a purity
[1:16:24] that god puts in every life
[1:16:27] that has a soul
[1:16:30] and they're to give reverence they're to
[1:16:31] give aw they're to give worship they are
[1:16:34] to give their adoration
[1:16:38] and the whole world is spiritual
[1:16:42] did you hear me
[1:16:45] you say brother matt what about the
[1:16:46] atheist the atheist is spiritual too the
[1:16:48] atheist is religious too the only
[1:16:50] difference is his religion is himself
[1:16:54] so the atheist doesn't worship anything
[1:16:56] wrong
[1:16:57] the asia with the atheist worships the
[1:16:59] difference is he doesn't worship god he
[1:17:01] worships
[1:17:02] this right here
[1:17:04] he worships his intellect and what he
[1:17:05] thinks god bless you brother will just
[1:17:07] seen you
[1:17:08] he worships what he thinks he worships
[1:17:10] what what what what he's figured out
[1:17:13] what he's by science or by deduction or
[1:17:15] by rationalizing has learned but what
[1:17:17] i'm trying to get you to understand is
[1:17:18] that there's something in everybody that
[1:17:20] gives worship to something it's in every
[1:17:22] person you don't have to teach it they
[1:17:24] give themselves to something why do you
[1:17:26] think that as we said the aborigine that
[1:17:29] the tribes even the indian they
[1:17:31] worshiped the great spirit brother adam
[1:17:33] said why they knew there was something
[1:17:35] before the enlightenment they knew that
[1:17:37] the indians knew there was there was a
[1:17:39] higher power you didn't find atheism you
[1:17:41] didn't find intellectualism that says
[1:17:42] there's no god and creation was from a
[1:17:44] big bang and it was all just you know uh
[1:17:47] you know it was all just
[1:17:48] everything came from nothing how silly
[1:17:50] is that
[1:17:53] the man said i'll believe in the big
[1:17:55] bang but just tell me who pulled the
[1:17:56] trigger
[1:18:00] because when you go back and you go back
[1:18:01] and you go back and you go back there
[1:18:02] had to start with something
[1:18:05] but what was it is that man was created
[1:18:07] to worship something even these heathens
[1:18:10] who we read about here they were
[1:18:11] worshiping a bell they were worshipping
[1:18:13] in asherah there was something spiritual
[1:18:15] inside of them because it's inside of
[1:18:16] every single person to worship something
[1:18:19] and the entire world today whether they
[1:18:22] are in a church on sunday morning
[1:18:24] worshiping the living god or they're
[1:18:26] worshiping a denominational system
[1:18:28] that's ruled by the antichrist and
[1:18:30] brother brandon said they'd go to church
[1:18:31] thinking they were worshiping god to
[1:18:32] worship the devil didn't even know it
[1:18:34] whether they're at a bar stool whether
[1:18:35] they're in whether they're at a football
[1:18:37] game whether they're not at church
[1:18:38] they've never been at church they're
[1:18:40] worshiping
[1:18:41] something
[1:18:44] let me say this to you young people you
[1:18:45] will worship you will give your worship
[1:18:48] to something
[1:18:50] or somebody
[1:18:53] you will give your worship your
[1:18:55] adoration you will bow your need to
[1:18:58] something whether it's a dollar whether
[1:19:00] it's money whether it's popularity
[1:19:02] whether it's the culture whether it's
[1:19:05] drugs or whatever whatever it would be
[1:19:08] brother branham said that was a pure a
[1:19:10] pure uh a a desire god put it inside a
[1:19:14] man in purity but satan will give him
[1:19:16] every every substitute
[1:19:18] said satan will give him every
[1:19:20] substitute to take that pure thirst
[1:19:22] and quench it with a a a a a a demon
[1:19:26] spirit something that quenches that
[1:19:28] thirst inside of him he preached thank
[1:19:29] you man's filter he says but he says a
[1:19:31] holy man
[1:19:32] holy man's taste is the word of god
[1:19:35] david said this is my portion this
[1:19:37] satisfies me
[1:19:39] i don't need anything out there i'm not
[1:19:40] looking for ever i'm not craving it well
[1:19:42] you say hell brother matt boy you're
[1:19:44] you're something it ain't me it's the
[1:19:46] holy spirit god has taken the taste for
[1:19:48] the world out of me
[1:19:51] except for the madness i mean you don't
[1:19:52] you don't you're not tempted absolutely
[1:19:54] i still deal with this old flesh here
[1:19:57] that thirst for the things of god of the
[1:19:59] of the world as paul said wretched man
[1:20:02] that i am who shall deliver me
[1:20:06] but there's something spiritual why do
[1:20:07] you think you live in the age of of of
[1:20:09] american idol
[1:20:12] american americans got america's got
[1:20:15] talent britain's got talent they got
[1:20:17] that that talent show is not just in
[1:20:19] america or britain they've got india's
[1:20:21] got talent they've got thailand's got
[1:20:23] talent they've got china's japan's got
[1:20:25] talent
[1:20:26] so do you say boy this was this
[1:20:28] phenomenon because it would come in this
[1:20:30] generation where the bible says men
[1:20:31] shall be lovers
[1:20:35] of their own
[1:20:37] self
[1:20:40] it's prophecy it should tell you where
[1:20:41] you're at
[1:20:44] but what is it it's to give worship to
[1:20:46] something why do you think the comic
[1:20:48] books who marvel studios and the
[1:20:50] different uh superheroes in the where
[1:20:52] did superman come from
[1:20:54] where did where did all these where did
[1:20:55] these superheroes come from well what
[1:20:58] with even a little boy from a very young
[1:21:00] age well there's something that he just
[1:21:02] takes into a superman or he wants to
[1:21:04] wear their cape or have some superstar
[1:21:06] or some super hero what is it it's
[1:21:08] inside of you because why you needed a
[1:21:12] superman to save you and it wasn't a man
[1:21:14] wearing a cape it was a man with nail
[1:21:16] scarred hands
[1:21:18] he saved me when i couldn't save myself
[1:21:20] that's the superman i give my worship to
[1:21:24] but it's an inside of every single
[1:21:26] person you want it's inside of every
[1:21:28] single individual to
[1:21:30] worship
[1:21:31] something
[1:21:36] we can say a lot more on that but we've
[1:21:37] just got too much to get to
[1:21:39] then you shall drive out all notice what
[1:21:41] he says here all the inhabitants of the
[1:21:43] lamb from before you destroy all their
[1:21:45] pictures destroy all their molten images
[1:21:47] quite plugged down all their high places
[1:21:50] and you shall dispossess the inhabitants
[1:21:52] of the landfill and dwell therein for i
[1:21:54] have given you the land to
[1:21:58] possess it
[1:21:59] it's a promise
[1:22:03] oh but
[1:22:04] then there's verse 55
[1:22:07] but
[1:22:08] that's a big word
[1:22:11] but if you will not drive out the
[1:22:13] inhabitants of the land from before you
[1:22:14] and destroy all their pictures and
[1:22:15] destroy other molten images and quite
[1:22:17] plug down other high places
[1:22:19] notice what he says here then you shall
[1:22:21] drive out i'm in the wrong i mean yeah
[1:22:22] verse 55 if you will not drive then it
[1:22:24] shall come to pass that those which you
[1:22:26] let remain of them shall be pricks in
[1:22:27] your eyes thorns in your sights notice
[1:22:29] that that that that curse that god said
[1:22:32] was going to come upon them if you
[1:22:33] choose not
[1:22:36] to it shall be a prick in your eye you
[1:22:40] know a thorn hitting a a toy a cactus
[1:22:43] and getting a thorn in my in my in my
[1:22:45] you know my foot or my leg or my hand
[1:22:47] could be painful could you imagine in
[1:22:48] your eyeball
[1:22:52] and god says
[1:22:54] that this is that if you don't drive
[1:22:56] them out what was he saying to drive out
[1:22:59] not just the people lord
[1:23:01] you want us to go and annihilate the
[1:23:03] canaanite the head the the perizzite the
[1:23:05] hittite
[1:23:07] you want us to destroy this people
[1:23:09] because they're they're a wicked people
[1:23:11] and god says not for your righteousness
[1:23:13] but for their wickedness do i do this
[1:23:15] thing
[1:23:16] it's not about your
[1:23:18] righteousness it's not about your your
[1:23:21] works or your good works god says but
[1:23:23] you're to destroy all of them and you
[1:23:25] could say hold on lord hold on i told my
[1:23:28] we were there with my children yesterday
[1:23:30] i said now wait a minute
[1:23:31] now why wouldn't have been enough for
[1:23:33] for for them to to destroy the people
[1:23:36] you say lord
[1:23:38] aren't we getting a little carried away
[1:23:41] you know we're going to just there won't
[1:23:43] be already told us to to kill them you
[1:23:45] already told us to destroy them you told
[1:23:46] us to annihilate them

[1:23:56] lord you want us to destroy their
[1:23:58] pictures
[1:24:00] their images
[1:24:03] their high places which was that were
[1:24:04] they were they worshiped they're false
[1:24:06] gods
[1:24:07] you know what god is trying to say god
[1:24:09] is starting to say there's more it's not
[1:24:11] the people
[1:24:13] that
[1:24:13] it's not necessarily the person that
[1:24:16] does the harm it's the culture
[1:24:20] are you with me here this morning
[1:24:22] there's a certain culture in the world
[1:24:25] listen to me young people when you go to
[1:24:26] school there's a certain culture there's
[1:24:29] a certain there's a certain way
[1:24:31] of the world we don't go that way
[1:24:35] we don't go that way
[1:24:37] there's a certain culture us in society
[1:24:39] and god says i want you to destroy it
[1:24:41] all show their pictures their high

[1:24:56] those are the inheritance of the lord i
[1:24:59] don't want your children affected by the
[1:25:01] culture that's around them
[1:25:04] you're to be
[1:25:06] separate
[1:25:09] and he says and he says here
[1:25:11] moreover it shall come to pass that i
[1:25:13] shall do unto you that as i thought to
[1:25:14] do unto them now god comes over and god
[1:25:17] says i want you to destroy everything
[1:25:18] destroy their high places their images
[1:25:19] their pictures everything
[1:25:22] their images because an image has an
[1:25:24] importance
[1:25:26] what you gaze upon you become
[1:25:30] right
[1:25:31] your diet go to get get a good diet but
[1:25:34] your diet consists of more what food you
[1:25:36] eat
[1:25:37] it also means what movies you watch what
[1:25:39] music you listen to what places you go
[1:25:43] what you do on social media what you
[1:25:45] what you
[1:25:46] what what your affinities and leagues
[1:25:48] and affiliations are that's your diet
[1:25:53] he says destroy it all
[1:25:56] now god gives this word through moses
[1:25:58] the prophet
[1:25:59] and they go over to the land now i want
[1:26:01] you to to notice this they go over they
[1:26:04] have all of this you know this hype this
[1:26:06] this great excitement we're going over

[1:26:22] i got the promise of god
[1:26:24] you know and they're going to go over
[1:26:25] and drive out now let's see
[1:26:27] let's let's read the record of what the
[1:26:28] bible says judges chapter 1
[1:26:31] judges chapter 1 verse 19.
[1:26:36] now this is the record of what took
[1:26:38] place here's the
[1:26:40] the the campaigns
[1:26:42] and the lord was with judah and he drove
[1:26:44] out the inhabitants of the mountain
[1:26:47] praise god
[1:26:49] somebody said praise the lord
[1:26:51] but
[1:26:53] could not drive out the inhabitants of
[1:26:54] the valley because they had iron
[1:26:56] chariots of iron
[1:26:59] now what did god say god said drive out
[1:27:01] all
[1:27:03] verse 21 and the children of benjamin
[1:27:05] did not drive out the jebusites that
[1:27:06] inhabited jerusalem but the jebusites
[1:27:08] dwell with the children of benjamin and
[1:27:10] jerusalem and to this day meaning the
[1:27:11] day that was written
[1:27:14] verse 27 and 28
[1:27:16] neither did manasseh drive out the
[1:27:18] inhabitants of beth sheehan in her
[1:27:20] town's nortanik in her town's door to
[1:27:21] inhabitants of door in our towns or the
[1:27:23] inhabitants of iblim in our towns nor
[1:27:25] the inhabitants of meg they go in their
[1:27:26] towns
[1:27:28] you say well just we get the point why
[1:27:30] why list all of these little cities and
[1:27:32] we got the point he didn't get he didn't
[1:27:33] win
[1:27:35] you see this was a record
[1:27:38] this was a record of their life
[1:27:41] thought about this
[1:27:43] you said brother matt you're preaching
[1:27:44] you feel like you're preaching at me i'm
[1:27:45] preaching right here
[1:27:49] this was a record of their life
[1:27:52] i i
[1:27:54] as i read this even early this morning i
[1:27:56] said lord this was a record of victory
[1:27:59] or defeat
[1:28:02] and god was going to list he was going
[1:28:04] to take time the writer here is going to
[1:28:06] take time and say
[1:28:08] he had victory here and here and here
[1:28:10] but oh but but this spot here
[1:28:14] no and it seemed he never could get over
[1:28:16] that
[1:28:18] sema just went on and on and on and
[1:28:20] and ibli and no magdago megiddo no
[1:28:25] and her towns canaanites would dwell
[1:28:29] verse 29 neither did ephraim drive out
[1:28:32] the canaanites that dwell in gaza but
[1:28:33] the canaanites dwelling gazer among them
[1:28:36] neither did zebulon drive out the
[1:28:38] inhabitants of catron or the inhabitants
[1:28:40] of nahalo but the canaanites dwell among
[1:28:42] them
[1:28:43] verse 31 neither did asher drive out the
[1:28:46] inhabitants of echo
[1:28:48] he list all of these neither did zebulon
[1:28:50] needed a manasseh uh
[1:28:52] neither did neptula drive out the
[1:28:54] inhabitants of beth sheehan or beth
[1:28:56] shamath north inhabitants it goes on and
[1:28:59] on and on
[1:29:02] and and and and and you look at the
[1:29:05] story and you say
[1:29:06] now they had a prophet
[1:29:08] they had a promise they had the word you
[1:29:11] know
[1:29:12] what what more did they what more did
[1:29:13] they need
[1:29:15] they go over and there's there's no
[1:29:16] victory this one gets victory up here in
[1:29:18] the mountain but not in the valley this
[1:29:19] one over here you know war
[1:29:22] war could sometimes go a long time and
[1:29:24] could be long and drawn out
[1:29:27] you know and you could have a long
[1:29:28] drawn-out war you said brother i'm just

[1:30:08] of my life
[1:30:10] but they they the bible says all of this
[1:30:14] now judges chapter 2
[1:30:16] judges chapter 2
[1:30:18] verse 1
[1:30:20] and an angel of the lord came up from
[1:30:22] gilgal to bocom notice what notice the
[1:30:25] way the angel
[1:30:27] says this
[1:30:28] an angel of the lord came from the old
[1:30:30] god of bocom and said
[1:30:32] i made you
[1:30:35] now that's a strong word i
[1:30:38] made you
[1:30:40] i forced you this was in other words god
[1:30:42] was attributing this and saying this is
[1:30:44] what i did
[1:30:45] i made you to go up out of egypt god
[1:30:48] said i've heard the cries of my people
[1:30:50] and i'm coming down to deliver them
[1:30:53] they were helpless couldn't help
[1:30:54] themselves but god delivered them
[1:30:57] and god says i made you to go up out of
[1:30:59] egypt and have brought you into the land
[1:31:00] which i swore to your fathers and i said
[1:31:02] i will never break my covenant with you
[1:31:04] there's always two sides
[1:31:06] to every story that god could say now
[1:31:08] this is what i did but this is what you
[1:31:10] did
[1:31:11] now this is what i said but this is what
[1:31:13] you said
[1:31:15] and you shall make no league with the
[1:31:16] inhabitants of this land you shall throw
[1:31:18] down their altars but you have not
[1:31:22] obeyed my voice
[1:31:27] let me ask them a question
[1:31:30] why
[1:31:32] why
[1:31:34] why have you done this
[1:31:36] and no doubt the rebuke comes the the
[1:31:39] feeling the the let down
[1:31:42] god says wherefore i also said i will
[1:31:44] not drive them out from before you
[1:31:47] but they shall be as thorns and your
[1:31:49] sides and their gods shall be
[1:31:51] a trap
[1:31:54] their gods shall be is that what the
[1:31:55] bible says
[1:31:58] there god shall be a snare
[1:32:01] unto you
[1:32:02] and it came to pass the story goes on
[1:32:05] when the angel of the lord spoke these
[1:32:06] words and to the children of israel that
[1:32:08] the people lifted up their voice
[1:32:10] and wept
[1:32:14] the people lifted up their voice and
[1:32:17] wept
[1:32:19] but you know what they didn't do they
[1:32:20] didn't do anything else
[1:32:22] they
[1:32:24] wept the bible doesn't say that they
[1:32:27] wept and left from there dried off their
[1:32:29] tears and then drove out the inhabitants
[1:32:31] of their land no
[1:32:33] they just wept
[1:32:34] and sometimes people just
[1:32:36] weep
[1:32:38] you know the word of god is so
[1:32:41] you have to be so careful how when god
[1:32:44] begins to use
[1:32:45] words and god uses a sermon god could
[1:32:47] use anything he could use a prayer he
[1:32:49] could use an encouragement he could use
[1:32:51] a phone call a text message from a
[1:32:53] friend a bible verse that you read
[1:32:55] something you hear about and god is
[1:32:56] always always preaching at you even
[1:32:59] nature's always preaching at you
[1:33:02] and god says well god said brother madam
[1:33:03] says that you may not reject the voice
[1:33:05] of a preacher he's you may not you know
[1:33:07] you may not ever reject and he brother
[1:33:09] madam says you may not ever come up and
[1:33:10] say well i just reject the lord and i
[1:33:12] just don't want anything to do with
[1:33:13] jesus you'd say i don't know that would
[1:33:14] never be remember that but brother adam
[1:33:16] says but what about that little voice in
[1:33:18] your heart that's speaking unto you
[1:33:20] he says do you accept that or do you
[1:33:21] reject that
[1:33:23] the prophet says you'll be accountable
[1:33:26] not not just because you walked away
[1:33:27] from the faith or said i don't love the
[1:33:29] lord anymore he says but anytime the
[1:33:30] voice of god is pulling on your heart
[1:33:33] tugging on your heart speaking to your
[1:33:35] heart it's not enough to weep
[1:33:40] you come under the effect and people
[1:33:41] come into the effect of the conviction
[1:33:42] of the preaching which the word of god
[1:33:44] should be convicting
[1:33:45] the bible says when when peter preached
[1:33:48] the sermon they were pricked in their
[1:33:49] hearts
[1:33:50] stabbed in their hearts that what shall
[1:33:52] we do to be saved the word should be
[1:33:54] considered conviction but beyond
[1:33:56] conviction it should bring repentance
[1:34:00] and then repentance true repentance
[1:34:02] turns to righteousness repentance
[1:34:04] cleanses and cleans
[1:34:06] and you get a desire to say i don't just
[1:34:08] want to be clean and empty i want to be
[1:34:10] clean and full of the holy spirit
[1:34:15] they wept
[1:34:16] they wept
[1:34:19] they they cried at the words of this
[1:34:21] angel but the bible goes on in the
[1:34:23] history that the story just keeps keeps
[1:34:25] telling it says and the people
[1:34:28] serve the lord all the days of joshua
[1:34:32] the people served the lord all the days
[1:34:35] of joshua and all the days of the elders
[1:34:37] that outlived joshua who had seen the
[1:34:39] great works of the lord that he did for
[1:34:41] israel
[1:34:43] and joshua the son of none died the
[1:34:46] judgement son of the son of the lord
[1:34:47] died being 110 years old
[1:34:50] and also all that generation were
[1:34:52] gathered under their fathers now what's
[1:34:54] amazing when i read this today or
[1:34:55] yesterday we were reading it
[1:34:59] know this struck a chord in my heart
[1:35:01] and i said it's amazing because here god
[1:35:03] gives this gives god comes down and he
[1:35:05] brings this rebuke and chastisement
[1:35:08] and he
[1:35:10] and the bible says that that they serve
[1:35:12] the lord god says it'll be a curse unto
[1:35:15] you
[1:35:17] it'll be a snare unto you
[1:35:19] and here's this here's this here's what
[1:35:21] the lord the lord gives them this word
[1:35:22] he says
[1:35:23] i will no longer drive them out from
[1:35:25] before you but they shall be pricks in
[1:35:26] your eyes
[1:35:28] should be thorn in your eye thorn in
[1:35:30] your side and shall the the scripture
[1:35:33] says and shall vex you
[1:35:36] in the land wherein you live wherein you
[1:35:38] dwell
[1:35:40] but you read the next verse and the
[1:35:41] bible says and the people serve the lord
[1:35:44] people serve the lord they they they
[1:35:47] served him all the days that joshua as
[1:35:49] long as joshua was alive as long as
[1:35:50] joshua was there as long as the
[1:35:51] figurehead was there
[1:35:53] long as the patriarch was there
[1:35:55] serve the lord joshua dies all the
[1:35:58] inhabitants his bible says all the
[1:35:59] inhabitants of the land
[1:36:01] and all and notice what he says here
[1:36:02] joshua's servant of the lord died being
[1:36:03] 110 years old also other generation
[1:36:05] we're gathered in our fathers also all
[1:36:07] that
[1:36:08] notice the bible's going to be real
[1:36:10] specific here that entire generation
[1:36:12] serves the lord
[1:36:15] so who was the curse
[1:36:17] for not driving out the inhabitants for
[1:36:19] not tearing down the high places for not
[1:36:22] destroying the culture for not
[1:36:23] destroying the images who was it going
[1:36:26] to affect not the parents
[1:36:31] but the bible says
[1:36:32] and there arose
[1:36:35] another generation
[1:36:39] after them
[1:36:41] which knew
[1:36:43] not the lord
[1:36:46] nor the works which he had done for
[1:36:48] israel
[1:36:49] i read this yesterday and i thought an
[1:36:51] entire generation of people
[1:36:54] an entire generation is now doesn't know
[1:36:57] the lord it means the children grow up
[1:37:00] and because of incomplete victory in
[1:37:03] parents lives children raises up
[1:37:06] and they don't know the lord
[1:37:09] nor the works which he had done
[1:37:12] and the bible says and they the children
[1:37:13] of israel did evil in the sight of the
[1:37:15] lord
[1:37:16] and served
[1:37:18] balaam
[1:37:21] and they forsook the lord god
[1:37:24] of their fathers
[1:37:26] which brought them out of the land of
[1:37:28] egypt and followed other gods the gods
[1:37:29] of the people this was who they will
[1:37:32] serve they will serve the gods either
[1:37:35] the god you put before them or the god
[1:37:37] of the people around them
[1:37:41] they forsook the lord
[1:37:43] their god the god of their fathers they
[1:37:46] they they they kept their religion
[1:37:50] but they had lost
[1:37:52] the way of the
[1:37:53] of jehovah
[1:37:56] there rose an entire generation who knew
[1:37:58] not the lord nor the works of his father
[1:37:59] they they served they they forsook the
[1:38:02] lord god of their fathers brought them
[1:38:02] around the land of egypt followed other
[1:38:04] gods of the gods of the people that were
[1:38:05] round about them and bowed themselves
[1:38:06] unto them and provoked the lord anger
[1:38:07] now do you realize now why it was a
[1:38:10] thorn in their side
[1:38:12] a thorn in their eye do you know why now
[1:38:15] because parents
[1:38:17] had to watch with their eyes
[1:38:19] children
[1:38:20] not grow up to serve the lord that they
[1:38:23] rose them or raised them to serve
[1:38:28] and it was a prick in the eye it was a
[1:38:30] thorn
[1:38:31] something they had to see
[1:38:33] and and the scripture says that entire
[1:38:34] generation lived lived on but the
[1:38:36] children the entire generation raises up
[1:38:39] doesn't know the lord because they don't
[1:38:40] have victory they forsook the lord and
[1:38:42] served bell
[1:38:45] and asked heroth
[1:38:47] they serve baal
[1:38:49] and ashtaroth now
[1:38:51] notice this high place here what does
[1:38:53] god tell them to do he says when you're
[1:38:55] to go over there this is this is how you
[1:38:56] get complete victory this is how you
[1:38:58] have total victory this is how you
[1:39:00] overcome you drive out all of the devil
[1:39:02] you don't leave a portion you don't
[1:39:04] leave a hint you don't leave a cent
[1:39:07] you keep him out of your life you resist
[1:39:09] the devil the bible says submit to god
[1:39:11] resist the devil and he'll flee from you
[1:39:15] it's not complicated
[1:39:17] it's not rocket science it's right here
[1:39:20] say i want to have a home that serves
[1:39:22] the lord i want to have children to
[1:39:23] serve the lord then submit to god resist
[1:39:26] the devil and he'll flee from your
[1:39:27] family
[1:39:30] god says destroy all the high places
[1:39:32] destroy all the remote images notice
[1:39:34] what he's what he's going to say here i
[1:39:36] want you to destroy the culture i want
[1:39:38] you to destroy everything around you i
[1:39:39] want you to have no no images no
[1:39:42] pictures
[1:39:46] and your bible you'll read in your old
[1:39:48] testament
[1:39:50] and i don't believe i've never seen it
[1:39:52] in the new testament maybe it is stand
[1:39:54] correction but you'll read about this
[1:39:56] high places and you read about it
[1:39:57] especially in the book of kings you
[1:39:59] start it start you hear about it at
[1:40:01] first in the life of the man who we
[1:40:03] preached on last sunday night and sunday
[1:40:05] morning solomon
[1:40:07] you read it uh
[1:40:09] 117 times in the old testament the bible
[1:40:12] mentions
[1:40:14] high places
[1:40:16] yesterday i was speaking you know and i
[1:40:18] said i said now what were these high
[1:40:20] places you know what what what did it
[1:40:22] represent
[1:40:23] and the bible says that
[1:40:25] a high place was a center
[1:40:28] for
[1:40:29] uh canaanite idolatry an idol idolatry
[1:40:32] and an idol worship
[1:40:34] the jews the bible says that god had
[1:40:36] commanded them you shall have no other
[1:40:38] gods before me
[1:40:40] but the canaanites these these spiritual
[1:40:43] people this religious this this culture
[1:40:46] that was in the world all around them
[1:40:49] the bible says that these high places
[1:40:51] you'll read about them over and over and
[1:40:52] over again they that the hebrew word for
[1:40:55] a high place is the word bama and it
[1:40:58] simply means a mountaintop or an open
[1:41:01] air elevated no which we call a knoll
[1:41:04] back home like a hill
[1:41:06] and it's in and anytime you'd enter to a
[1:41:09] city you enter tucson long before you
[1:41:10] see the metropolitan well long before
[1:41:12] you come to the city center you you see
[1:41:15] city limits welcome to tucson city
[1:41:17] limits and maybe they'd have a picture
[1:41:19] maybe you know some some some plants
[1:41:22] there something that would welcome you
[1:41:23] well this is what canaanites had and hit
[1:41:26] titan and jebusites in their cities they
[1:41:28] would have great mounds built and as you
[1:41:31] came into the city you'd see this great
[1:41:33] mountain smoke you know no doubt coming
[1:41:35] in fire maybe on the top of the mountain
[1:41:37] of a sacrifice something they were
[1:41:38] worshiping this is what a high place was
[1:41:41] it was a canaanite way of worship and
[1:41:43] the bible says that in first kings the
[1:41:46] canaanites built for themselves high
[1:41:48] places and sacred pillars
[1:41:51] and asheram on every high hill and
[1:41:53] beneath every luxurant tree even
[1:41:57] this is what god is saying when moses
[1:41:59] says
[1:42:00] destroy it
[1:42:02] annihilate it tear it down tear all
[1:42:05] their high places down rip all the
[1:42:06] pictures this uh annihilate it
[1:42:08] dispossess it completely destroy it
[1:42:13] and god warns them it says destroy it
[1:42:16] you know what what are those high places
[1:42:18] that god is god is speaking of
[1:42:21] it's the bible says the bible says it
[1:42:23] this way casting down
[1:42:25] vain
[1:42:26] imaginations
[1:42:28] or any high thought any thinking
[1:42:32] that that conflicts with the word of god
[1:42:34] what is a high place today it's right
[1:42:36] here
[1:42:39] we wrestle not against flesh and blood
[1:42:40] but against principalities spiritual
[1:42:42] wickedness and
[1:42:44] high places
[1:42:48] what are high places high places is
[1:42:50] where you think
[1:42:52] the atmosphere you live in the
[1:42:53] atmosphere you dwell in
[1:42:56] and the bible says that now god moses
[1:42:58] has destroyed them but but but for years
[1:43:02] solomon is going to introduce something
[1:43:04] as we said the very twilight of his of
[1:43:07] his life not the beginning not not as he
[1:43:09] was a young man and he served the lord
[1:43:11] but at the end of his life as we
[1:43:12] preached last sunday he gets concubines
[1:43:14] and wives and and they defile him
[1:43:16] through their gods because they weren't
[1:43:17] jewish girls he didn't marry within the
[1:43:20] faith he married outside of he unequally
[1:43:23] yoked himself
[1:43:25] and the scripture says that solomon
[1:43:27] brings in these high places
[1:43:29] and now for 800 years
[1:43:34] 800 years 800
[1:43:37] years because solomon you never find
[1:43:39] this in david david's tabernacle you'll
[1:43:42] never find david introducing high places
[1:43:45] you find david doing a lot of wrong
[1:43:46] things but you won't find that
[1:43:49] but solomon introduces this way of
[1:43:51] worship this hybriding this mixing he
[1:43:55] brings in this other religion's way
[1:43:58] and the bible says for years it plagues
[1:44:00] the family of god
[1:44:02] for years 800 long years
[1:44:09] you have you find this in the scripture
[1:44:13] i want you to look here with me in this
[1:44:15] first one in jehovah's now this was a
[1:44:17] king i don't know who the writer was of
[1:44:19] kings but the bible says that kings that
[1:44:21] the writer of kings wrote it this way he
[1:44:23] would write
[1:44:25] this was after remember kings comes
[1:44:26] after judges
[1:44:28] so you have judges judges what was
[1:44:30] before judges you have moses telling
[1:44:31] them destroy the high places don't leave
[1:44:33] anything then you go through and what
[1:44:35] did what what do you find after we read
[1:44:37] there in judges too and then our
[1:44:38] generation raises up and you keep
[1:44:40] reading there it says god sent them
[1:44:41] judges who would begin to deliver them
[1:44:43] out of the hand of their enemy the
[1:44:44] philistines
[1:44:46] and but now here comes here comes david
[1:44:49] and all through david then through
[1:44:50] solomon then you have all of these you
[1:44:52] have all of these kings who rules the
[1:44:54] over over
[1:44:56] uh
[1:44:57] over israel
[1:44:59] you have prophets that come to israel
[1:45:01] you have priests the age of priests and
[1:45:03] you have the age of kings
[1:45:06] and jesus fulfilled all three that's why
[1:45:08] he was a prophet he was a priest and he
[1:45:10] was a king he was saying i'm i'm all of
[1:45:12] it to you i'm the consummation of every
[1:45:14] single bit of it
[1:45:17] but but these under this age of kings
[1:45:20] solomon would are the writer of not
[1:45:23] solomon but the writer of kings would
[1:45:24] say
[1:45:25] and in the year of this man and in this
[1:45:27] third year and this fourth month king
[1:45:31] began this king began to reign
[1:45:34] over israel he reigned this many years
[1:45:36] his mother name was zebedee of this land
[1:45:38] over here and then he would always
[1:45:40] listen he'd say and he did that which
[1:45:43] was and it would even either be right or
[1:45:45] it would be wrong or evil
[1:45:48] he did that which was evil in the sight
[1:45:49] of the lord or he would say and he did
[1:45:51] that which was good a right in the sight
[1:45:54] of the lord all of his days were in this
[1:45:56] man instructed him and he and he'd list
[1:45:58] and then he'd go on and say then this
[1:45:59] man dies then another king raises up and
[1:46:01] this man did right now i want you to
[1:46:03] read here now remember a high place
[1:46:05] solomon introduces it for 800 years now
[1:46:07] you see this i want you to notice this
[1:46:09] in your bible follow along with me
[1:46:11] jehovah in the seventh year second kings
[1:46:13] 12 12 in the seventh year of jehu jehosh
[1:46:16] began to reign
[1:46:18] and 40 years reigned he in jerusalem his
[1:46:20] mother's name was zibiya of beersheba
[1:46:22] and jehosh did that which was say it
[1:46:27] together right
[1:46:30] amen
[1:46:33] johash did that which was right
[1:46:36] in the sight of the lord all his all his
[1:46:38] days were in either priest instructed
[1:46:40] him
[1:46:42] but
[1:46:46] it sounded good but there's a problem
[1:46:50] there's an elephant in the room
[1:46:54] but
[1:46:57] the high places were not taken away
[1:47:00] the people still sacrificed and burned
[1:47:02] incense
[1:47:03] in the high places you had this much
[1:47:05] victory did that was right on the side
[1:47:07] of the lord let's go to another one
[1:47:08] amaziah psychics 14 in the second year
[1:47:10] of joash son of jehovah's king of israel
[1:47:12] reigned a messiah the son of joash king
[1:47:15] of judy was 25 years old he began to
[1:47:17] reign right 29 years in jerusalem his
[1:47:19] mother's name was jehovah and he did
[1:47:20] verse 3 and he did that which was
[1:47:25] right
[1:47:26] in the sight of the lord yet not
[1:47:30] like
[1:47:31] david
[1:47:34] hold on a minute david wasn't his f we
[1:47:36] just read david wasn't this man's mother
[1:47:39] it wasn't he did his this is his father
[1:47:41] david notice this notice what the bible
[1:47:43] is going to say here i love this he did
[1:47:45] that which was right yet not like david
[1:47:48] his father he did according to all
[1:47:50] things as
[1:47:51] joash
[1:47:53] his father
[1:47:54] did how be it the high places or not
[1:47:58] taken away that's why he didn't worship
[1:48:01] the lord like david's tabernacle worship
[1:48:04] the lord
[1:48:05] not that he wasn't a good man not that
[1:48:07] he wasn't a good person not that he
[1:48:08] wasn't godly it's just he didn't worship
[1:48:11] the lord in the way that david
[1:48:13] worshipped the lord he worshipped the
[1:48:15] lord the way his father
[1:48:19] worshipped the lord
[1:48:22] as zariah uzziah notice this in the 20th
[1:48:24] and seventh year of jeroboam king of
[1:48:26] israel began azariah the son of amazing
[1:48:28] king of judah 16 years old what a young
[1:48:30] boy he was when he began to reign and he
[1:48:32] reigned 22 and 50 years in jerusalem
[1:48:34] and he verse 3 did that which was say it
[1:48:37] together right in the sight of the lord
[1:48:39] according to all according to all that
[1:48:43] his father amaziah had done
[1:48:48] save accept but
[1:48:50] the high places were not removed the
[1:48:52] people sacrificed and burn instant steal
[1:48:55] in the high places notice what the
[1:48:56] scripture keeps going to even jotham in
[1:48:59] the second year of peak of the sun in
[1:49:00] the second year of peak of the son of
[1:49:01] remeliah king of israel began jotham son
[1:49:04] of uzziah judah to reign five and 20
[1:49:05] years old wasn't begin to reign verse 34
[1:49:08] he did that which was right in the sight
[1:49:09] of the lord he did according to all that
[1:49:12] his father it was very easy for son to
[1:49:16] do what dad did
[1:49:18] it was very easy for as much victory as
[1:49:20] mom and dad could get it was natural son
[1:49:23] would also get that much victory but
[1:49:26] wherever dad stopped sun stopped
[1:49:29] are you catching the picture here
[1:49:32] wherever the previous generation got to
[1:49:35] that's where the last generation was
[1:49:36] held back to
[1:49:38] wherever father do you see the
[1:49:40] importance dads do you see the
[1:49:42] importance moms do you see the
[1:49:43] importance
[1:49:44] church do you see the importance this
[1:49:46] morning
[1:49:47] the testimony not what we say with our
[1:49:50] lips
[1:49:51] but the testimony of the fruits of our
[1:49:54] life
[1:49:55] will be the sermon that our children
[1:49:56] hear it won't be the sermon they'll hear
[1:49:58] things i say they'll hear my
[1:50:01] types and my different quotes i read
[1:50:03] they'll see my hands waving they'll hear
[1:50:05] my voice
[1:50:06] but they'll they'll come under the
[1:50:08] influence of what sermon you're living
[1:50:10] not the sermon i'm preaching
[1:50:13] and wherever father could get victory as
[1:50:16] far as he could go the son oh yeah he he
[1:50:18] went that far how be it no notice verse
[1:50:21] 35 how be it the high places were not
[1:50:23] removed the people sacrificed and burnt
[1:50:25] incense
[1:50:26] still in the high places he built the
[1:50:28] higher gate of the house of the lord
[1:50:29] over and over as far as he went as far
[1:50:32] as he could get was as far in the ways
[1:50:35] let me just say it to you very simply
[1:50:39] dad you're a leader
[1:50:41] whether you realize it or not
[1:50:44] mom you're a leader whether you realize
[1:50:46] it or not
[1:50:49] and a leader can only lead someone to
[1:50:52] somewhere they've already been themself
[1:50:56] if you tell me how do you get to you
[1:50:58] know uh
[1:50:59] nogales i've never i've been maybe maybe
[1:51:01] close but i couldn't tell you i've never
[1:51:02] been there but take someone who has you
[1:51:04] know you want that as your leader not me
[1:51:07] so brother matt how do you how do you
[1:51:09] get to you know this place over here in
[1:51:11] in nevada well i've never been there but
[1:51:12] maybe someone who has can lead you there
[1:51:15] i could try
[1:51:16] but you know what we're gonna do we're
[1:51:17] gonna get lost we're gonna make a lot of
[1:51:18] u-turns
[1:51:20] a leader can only lead you to where he's
[1:51:23] been
[1:51:25] so if if if there's to be spiritual
[1:51:28] teenagers if you want the let me say it
[1:51:30] this way say i want my children filled
[1:51:33] with the baptism of the holy ghost how
[1:51:34] many mothers would say that with an
[1:51:37] uplifted hand and a heart would say lord
[1:51:39] i want that more than anything else for
[1:51:41] my children i want them filled and
[1:51:43] sealed into your kingdom i don't want
[1:51:44] them destroyed with the wicked world i
[1:51:46] want them raptured out of here i want
[1:51:48] them to have heaven as their home i want
[1:51:50] an eternal inheritance for my children
[1:51:55] we can all say that today
[1:51:56] then let me say this to you that we must
[1:51:59] make sure that the example this
[1:52:01] generation of what we testify of what we
[1:52:04] believe about the message what we
[1:52:06] believe about the bible what we believe
[1:52:07] about christ we've got to make sure
[1:52:09] we've been there first
[1:52:15] give the lord a handclap of praise
[1:52:16] hallelujah
[1:52:19] he's worthy of it he deserves it
[1:52:21] [Applause]
[1:52:23] say i want that more than anything in
[1:52:25] life
[1:52:28] it's important
[1:52:31] as far as he could go
[1:52:33] oh i thought it was so amazing where did
[1:52:36] my clicker go
[1:52:38] brother branham tells a story paradox
[1:52:41] and i've read this here before
[1:52:44] he begins to tell about a boy
[1:52:47] and this boy's dating this girl and
[1:52:50] he does something awful to her
[1:52:53] and and the prophet of god they call him
[1:52:54] in and they say we just want to know
[1:52:56] what's wrong with our son and and and so
[1:52:58] brother adam starts now now what you
[1:53:00] don't read from the story
[1:53:02] that that i'll give you a little uh
[1:53:05] tidbit here just a little insider
[1:53:06] information
[1:53:08] this was brother branham's nephew now he
[1:53:10] doesn't tell that
[1:53:11] but this is his nephew he's referring to
[1:53:13] his his own nephew now listen to what he
[1:53:15] says
[1:53:16] he says for instance a few days ago i
[1:53:18] was caught in on a scene of little
[1:53:19] something going on there was a fine
[1:53:20] young man very fine boy he was going
[1:53:22] with a girl little girl very fine little
[1:53:24] girl out of a fine family this boy all
[1:53:26] of a sudden came up with some kind of an
[1:53:28] idea and he just walked away he did
[1:53:30] something wrong to the little girl as
[1:53:32] much as had promised her to do a certain
[1:53:34] thing and then he didn't do it and
[1:53:36] instead of coming to the girl and
[1:53:37] apologizing like a gentleman should do
[1:53:41] it just wasn't in him to do it
[1:53:44] and the father and mother called me to
[1:53:45] the scene and said we would desire to
[1:53:47] know what is wrong with our boy
[1:53:49] now it's not easy to do some time but
[1:53:53] you must be truthful and honest i'm glad
[1:53:56] he was truthful and honest
[1:53:59] it must be truthful and honest therefore
[1:54:01] the boy was a christian now you've got
[1:54:04] to follow real closely here brother
[1:54:06] branham delineates he separates this
[1:54:08] year
[1:54:09] the boy was a christian boy notice
[1:54:12] as far as a believer
[1:54:16] he had repented
[1:54:18] been baptized
[1:54:21] and had his position among the believers
[1:54:24] but
[1:54:25] yet
[1:54:26] had not received the baptism of the holy
[1:54:28] spirit
[1:54:32] that means you could be a christian
[1:54:33] you'd be believer be baptized even
[1:54:35] repent what is what does this baptism
[1:54:37] save you no does repentance save you no
[1:54:40] it's all of all of all of it's a work of
[1:54:43] salvation
[1:54:46] brother madam says but he had not
[1:54:47] received the baptism of the holy spirit
[1:54:48] no matter how much he thought he had
[1:54:52] you think and you have it and having it
[1:54:54] is two different things
[1:54:57] can you say amen to the word
[1:55:00] you might be able to try to say you have
[1:55:02] and you might be able to show some
[1:55:03] evidence of some emotion
[1:55:05] but unless your life
[1:55:07] is vindicating
[1:55:10] what you're professing hello somebody
[1:55:13] unless your life is vindicating what
[1:55:14] you're professing how do i know the holy
[1:55:16] ghost i believe the message well the
[1:55:17] devil believes the message it's getting
[1:55:19] the holy ghost saying i believe the
[1:55:20] message no brother madam says if your
[1:55:22] life isn't vindicating what is the proof
[1:55:26] that you can say amen to every word and
[1:55:28] it's not a verbal amen i believe it that
[1:55:30] settles that that doesn't do anything
[1:55:32] for you my brother my sister
[1:55:34] saying amen to the word of god is what
[1:55:36] mary did when she said be it
[1:55:39] unto me
[1:55:40] lord and she received the word which was
[1:55:44] christ
[1:55:46] what is the evidence that mary received
[1:55:48] the holy ghost what is the evidence that
[1:55:49] she was pregnant
[1:55:52] she didn't need to prove it it was
[1:55:54] living outside of her it was visible to
[1:55:56] everybody
[1:55:58] brother branham says and now having it
[1:56:00] notice what he says you might be able to
[1:56:01] show some evidence of emotion but unless
[1:56:02] your life is vindicating what you're
[1:56:04] professing to have you still don't got
[1:56:05] it no matter how many emotions how much
[1:56:07] you jump run sensations speaking in
[1:56:08] tongues or shouting
[1:56:10] life has to vindicate it or whatever you
[1:56:12] might lay it upon which is all right
[1:56:15] it's all right it's good
[1:56:17] but he says i believe in all of that too
[1:56:21] but unless your life
[1:56:24] not your word not the verbal things you
[1:56:26] speak not the church you go to
[1:56:29] not where you pay your tithes
[1:56:31] unless your
[1:56:33] life
[1:56:36] unless your life
[1:56:38] oh you say brother matt what are you
[1:56:40] preaching i'm saying lord
[1:56:42] i'll just raise my hands now and say let
[1:56:44] my life vindicate what i believe lord
[1:56:46] let it be more than just lip i believe
[1:56:48] it i'm not ashamed of it i'm proud to
[1:56:50] say i believe it i believe the message
[1:56:52] with all my heart i believe in christ
[1:56:54] with all my heart but lord let my life
[1:56:56] vindicate to the world what i believe
[1:57:00] that's what will save the sinner that's
[1:57:02] what will save your unsaved loved one
[1:57:04] that's what'll get them in the house of
[1:57:06] god and fill them with the holy ghost it
[1:57:07] won't be what you say it's what you live
[1:57:11] he says unless your life copes with the
[1:57:13] word
[1:57:15] he says unless your life copes with your
[1:57:17] testimony then you haven't got it
[1:57:18] because the fruit of the spirit
[1:57:19] vindicates what you are just like the
[1:57:21] fruit of any tree tells you what it is
[1:57:22] jesus says by their fruit you shall know
[1:57:24] them now this young fellow not only goes
[1:57:26] back to the boy now this young fellow
[1:57:29] this young fellow's parents his mother
[1:57:31] is german now why does he go to the
[1:57:33] parents because brother branham
[1:57:34] understands generational curses
[1:57:38] or generational blessings
[1:57:41] you know you're the family you come from
[1:57:43] where you come from you a lot of i'm i
[1:57:46] i'm a living example i i'm i am i'm not
[1:57:51] some are not as fortunate but i say i'm
[1:57:53] blessed today to have a parent a mother
[1:57:56] and a father who served the lord who
[1:57:58] raised me in the admonition of the lord
[1:58:01] blessed today
[1:58:02] generation of my children as a
[1:58:04] reflection of the generation of my
[1:58:06] grandmother my grandfather who sat in
[1:58:08] brother branham's meetings
[1:58:10] uh that and not just because they were
[1:58:12] there but the testimony in life that
[1:58:14] they lived bled into the life of my dad
[1:58:16] filled him with the holy ghost when he
[1:58:18] was a young man raised his children that
[1:58:20] way what is it a generational blessing
[1:58:27] and and brother brandon begins to go to
[1:58:29] his parents and he says now his mother
[1:58:30] was notice this his mother's german
[1:58:34] i hope you're not german today
[1:58:36] i'm just kidding
[1:58:37] no reflection on the german
[1:58:39] but there's a strain in that family a
[1:58:41] strain that's what he calls it a strain
[1:58:43] in that family
[1:58:44] and that is they'll just
[1:58:46] sit you could talk to them they'll just
[1:58:49] stare at you right in the face
[1:58:53] some people do that in church you preach
[1:58:54] to them and they just stare at you right
[1:58:56] in the face
[1:58:59] you're not sure what they're
[1:59:00] thinking i like when i talk to someone i
[1:59:03] like them to go uh-huh yeah
[1:59:05] yeah
[1:59:06] and when i preach to somebody i would
[1:59:08] like them to say amen amen that's right
[1:59:10] i believe that
[1:59:12] brother says they'll just sit there and
[1:59:13] they'll stare at you
[1:59:15] he says and you can talk to them they'll
[1:59:17] just stare right in your face in the
[1:59:18] face they got this girl's sister the
[1:59:21] mother of this boy her sister i've come
[1:59:23] down the street many morning and this
[1:59:25] young lady be sitting out in the yard
[1:59:26] i'd say good morning to you she just
[1:59:30] look at me
[1:59:33] i'd stop and i'd say
[1:59:35] sure fine morning
[1:59:37] she'd just stand look right at you an
[1:59:40] intelligent woman and i'd say
[1:59:42] come up to see us sometime
[1:59:44] she'd just stand and look
[1:59:47] well her brothers are that way
[1:59:50] and here's why father and mother
[1:59:52] are that way
[1:59:56] a prophet of god in one place called it
[1:59:57] the i think he calls it the grab bag or
[1:59:59] the bag he says the grab bag of life he
[2:00:01] says sometimes you get certain traits
[2:00:03] just out of the grab bag of life nothing
[2:00:05] you even did to deserve it he spoke
[2:00:07] about men who were high passion he said
[2:00:09] maybe that was bled down from another
[2:00:11] generation a man a father with a temper
[2:00:14] and he says and that would affect the
[2:00:15] children and affect the children's
[2:00:16] children affect the next generation
[2:00:19] you see it's generational and brother
[2:00:21] random even picks it up and he says you
[2:00:22] he says you girls here that are sitting
[2:00:24] there and he had some girls who were
[2:00:25] disrespectful when he was preaching he
[2:00:27] said you sit there and you dress his
[2:00:28] skin tight like that he said a slick
[2:00:31] going up your skirt he said why do you
[2:00:32] do that he says your mother she was a
[2:00:34] choir a flapper and he said and she did
[2:00:36] that then you watched that and that's
[2:00:38] what you became and your mother was a
[2:00:39] choir girl and he says what is it it's a
[2:00:41] generational curse it passes down from
[2:00:43] one generation to the next generation
[2:00:47] and he says but also a generational
[2:00:49] curse he said there's a generational
[2:00:50] reward he said look at levi he said who
[2:00:53] paid ties to melchizedek
[2:00:56] that's what brother brandon said he was
[2:00:58] attributed to him because of something
[2:01:00] his father did right god attributes the
[2:01:03] righteousness to him you say brother
[2:01:05] matt what's it take it takes one person
[2:01:07] to take a stand for jesus christ in that
[2:01:10] family and say i'm this far it's came
[2:01:12] and it's not going to go any further i'm
[2:01:14] going to choose to be different
[2:01:19] and you know what it'll do it'll affect
[2:01:20] not just you and affect your children
[2:01:21] and your children's children the next
[2:01:23] generation
[2:01:27] brother branham says it was his father
[2:01:29] notice what he says he says she just
[2:01:31] stand and look he says well our brothers
[2:01:32] are that way father mothers that way now
[2:01:34] the father
[2:01:36] thought she was getting off the hook dad
[2:01:38] father the boy is strictly an irishman
[2:01:41] it's his family it's brother branham's
[2:01:42] family
[2:01:44] strictly an irish man
[2:01:46] and he says
[2:01:48] moody high tempered
[2:01:52] high strung
[2:01:54] that's his whole family like that
[2:01:57] except one other out of the family
[2:02:00] converted
[2:02:03] say what makes the difference conversion
[2:02:05] makes the difference
[2:02:07] jesus makes the difference
[2:02:11] he says now in this this boy the father
[2:02:14] and his mother both are christians
[2:02:16] filled with the holy ghost and they have
[2:02:19] brought this young man up in the way of

[2:02:32] versa
[2:02:33] amazing you can have one in one family
[2:02:34] and the other family and just totally
[2:02:36] opposite
[2:02:38] and brother branham says but the girls
[2:02:40] the mother's family lives close to the a
[2:02:42] fine church but do you think they'd ever
[2:02:44] come over there
[2:02:47] no
[2:02:48] he goes back to the mother you've got to
[2:02:49] follow it he says now the mother says
[2:02:51] she goes to this fine church you know he
[2:02:53] says but this this father his church oh
[2:02:55] would they ever come oh no they'd never
[2:02:56] darken the door
[2:02:58] brother random says he says find church
[2:03:00] but do you ever think they'd come up no
[2:03:02] and they know it's right but it's just
[2:03:04] not in them to ask forgiveness or ask
[2:03:07] pardoning
[2:03:10] they just won't do it it's just not
[2:03:15] in them
[2:03:17] now the genes in the father and the
[2:03:20] mother of this boy no matter how much
[2:03:23] they who's he's speaking of mom and dad
[2:03:26] no matter how much they are converted
[2:03:29] still remains the flesh that's been
[2:03:32] interbred out to this boy therefore the
[2:03:35] boy has got a complex in him
[2:03:40] brother man it says the grab bag of life
[2:03:42] is things that you didn't even ask for
[2:03:43] it's inside of you you didn't ask for it
[2:03:45] but it's been interbred into you and
[2:03:47] there's none of us that has holy blood
[2:03:49] all of us are just a mixed bag of all
[2:03:51] kinds of things
[2:03:53] all of us here i care how righteous
[2:03:55] you're for how
[2:03:56] if they were righteous they were saved
[2:03:58] filled with the holy ghost but no matter
[2:03:59] how good you think you're you know how
[2:04:02] spotless your family was i guarantee you
[2:04:05] we we all come from we all come from for
[2:04:08] all fallen flesh and fallen clay and
[2:04:10] marred human beings every single one of
[2:04:12] us
[2:04:14] and all of us has different complexes
[2:04:16] and different strains
[2:04:18] brother branham says and your strain my
[2:04:19] strain is not better than your strain
[2:04:21] and your strength is not better than
[2:04:22] mine
[2:04:23] say what does that mean that means i've
[2:04:24] got something to overcome
[2:04:26] you've got something to overcome
[2:04:28] i may not have to overcome what you have
[2:04:30] but you don't have to overcome what i
[2:04:32] have so don't try to tell me how to
[2:04:33] overcome what's strange in mind i won't
[2:04:35] tell you how to overcome what's in yours
[2:04:37] you say what do we need we all need the
[2:04:39] holy spirit
[2:04:41] individually not collectively to each
[2:04:43] person
[2:04:45] and he says it stands for the father and
[2:04:47] mother no matter how they're converted
[2:04:48] therefore the boy's got a complex just
[2:04:50] like the mother's family they're not
[2:04:51] forgiving they won't apologize that's
[2:04:53] where the boy
[2:04:54] stands
[2:04:56] now i said to the father no matter how
[2:04:59] much you've raised him up i said now
[2:05:00] look at you out of your family all of
[2:05:03] them drunks
[2:05:05] fighting
[2:05:06] shooting cutting that's brother
[2:05:08] branham's own family he's speaking of
[2:05:10] all of them drunk shooting cutting
[2:05:12] remember my brother and i'm talking
[2:05:14] about his own daddy looks at him and
[2:05:15] says that's the only boy i've got
[2:05:17] you imagine having a father like that
[2:05:20] brother man says is it just a bootlegger
[2:05:23] a drunk alcoholic
[2:05:25] and he says i said now look at you your
[2:05:26] family drunks fighting shooting cutting
[2:05:28] so forth now look at your family to the
[2:05:30] mother brother adam says this there are
[2:05:32] a bunch of people just sit there won't
[2:05:34] speak very independent so forth
[2:05:36] irreverent to religion
[2:05:38] but i said
[2:05:40] it's not you
[2:05:44] it says but it's not you
[2:05:46] now your family mother there are germans
[2:05:48] they're like that but not you
[2:05:51] and he says
[2:05:52] they're people they said he says but i
[2:05:53] said it's not you you're the only one of
[2:05:55] all your sisters and brothers and you're
[2:05:57] sweet
[2:05:59] you're kind
[2:06:01] forgiving what
[2:06:03] does
[2:06:04] that
[2:06:06] your tree part of that family tree
[2:06:09] yet you have received the holy ghost
[2:06:14] that's the thing that made you tender
[2:06:17] and sweet it's not your people
[2:06:20] i love that so much it's not your people
[2:06:22] anymore
[2:06:23] it's your christ that lives inside of
[2:06:26] you
[2:06:27] i say lord i don't i don't want my
[2:06:29] people anymore the spirit of the world
[2:06:32] anymore i want the christ inside of me
[2:06:35] that's what makes the difference i said
[2:06:37] to the boy look at your family this is
[2:06:38] the father practically all the drunks so
[2:06:40] far they said and how moody how high
[2:06:41] tempered high high strong but you're not
[2:06:44] you're kind forgiving what is it the
[2:06:46] holy spirit you're no more what you are
[2:06:50] it's christ in you how many could say i
[2:06:53] want that this morning i don't want to
[2:06:55] be anymore how i am i want christ in me
[2:06:57] to change me
[2:06:59] break the generation off i've got a
[2:07:01] strain in my family a complex in my
[2:07:03] family god can free you of that today
[2:07:06] god can set you free of that today he'll
[2:07:07] make you a new creature in christ jesus
[2:07:12] i said we're not americans i'm not a
[2:07:13] republican i'm not a democrat not
[2:07:16] neither
[2:07:17] i'm a christian
[2:07:20] because i've been changed
[2:07:22] i've been reborn
[2:07:25] i'm not who i used to be
[2:07:30] he says now what is it the holy spirit
[2:07:31] you're no more you are i said now that's
[2:07:33] this now he says i said now the same
[2:07:36] that same thing has to happen to your
[2:07:41] son
[2:07:42] and the father raised up and said my son
[2:07:43] went to the altar he was baptized
[2:07:45] correctly in the name of jesus christ
[2:07:46] water baptism in the pool said i know my
[2:07:48] son has come to christ i said that may
[2:07:49] be all right all the outward emotions he
[2:07:52] might be identified as a believer with
[2:07:54] the believers but until he is
[2:07:56] regenerated born again what
[2:07:59] burns and annihilates the old nature
[2:08:02] the new birth
[2:08:05] to be borne by the spirit of god say
[2:08:08] where does that start it starts with
[2:08:10] repentance it's it comes to baptism what
[2:08:12] does baptism do it cleanses you it
[2:08:15] cleans you it gives you a fresh you say
[2:08:17] what is what is baptism brother matt
[2:08:19] what does water represent water
[2:08:20] represents two things water represents
[2:08:22] death
[2:08:25] water represents life
[2:08:27] what comes first and first in life water
[2:08:30] same water that gives life can also kill
[2:08:32] the waters of separation of jordan we're
[2:08:34] representing death baptism what is it
[2:08:36] represented it's a cleansing of the
[2:08:38] conscience
[2:08:40] you know what real baptism is baptism is
[2:08:43] grace for dirty people
[2:08:46] and i was a dirty person but god saved
[2:08:48] me i was dirty but i know for the filth
[2:08:50] of the world in my own mind but god gave
[2:08:52] me grace i'm so thankful for amazing
[2:08:55] grace
[2:08:56] and that cleansing repenting led to a
[2:08:58] sanctified of my life and then god
[2:09:00] sealed me with the baptism of the holy
[2:09:02] ghost say brother matt does it take one
[2:09:04] year maybe does it take ten maybe but
[2:09:07] maybe it takes one second one moment it
[2:09:10] doesn't have to be a long drawn-out
[2:09:11] process it could happen like that as he
[2:09:14] yeah as no cornelius's house as peter
[2:09:16] yet spoke these words the holy ghost
[2:09:19] fell upon them and he testified this is
[2:09:21] the same thing they received at
[2:09:23] pentecost
[2:09:25] until he's regenerated born again i'll
[2:09:27] advise that young man to never marry a
[2:09:30] woman he'll make hell on earth
[2:09:34] for her
[2:09:36] until that gentle
[2:09:39] sweet
[2:09:40] forgiving spirit of christ comes in
[2:09:46] i love the wisdom of brother branham
[2:09:49] he says until that gentle forgiving
[2:09:51] sweet spirit i recommend him
[2:09:54] i'd recommend don't marry
[2:09:57] make a woman's life miserable
[2:10:01] why
[2:10:04] just like that high place
[2:10:07] the thing that cursed
[2:10:08] no matter how good you are no matter how
[2:10:10] good of a boy he was no matter how nice
[2:10:12] it was good model boy good kid at home
[2:10:16] but unless that spirit of christ comes
[2:10:17] in
[2:10:19] and changes him the only thing that can
[2:10:21] change him
[2:10:22] is i recommend him not to marry he'd
[2:10:25] make a woman's life miserable you know
[2:10:27] how divorce
[2:10:28] happens separation happens
[2:10:30] because two people took
[2:10:33] took things you know what god says god
[2:10:35] says to moses we just read it he says
[2:10:37] destroy the molten images pluck down all
[2:10:39] the high places he says and then
[2:10:42] dispossess and then dwell
[2:10:45] notice the order god says don't go over
[2:10:46] there and live and build houses and then
[2:10:48] say hey you got to leave
[2:10:51] he says because if you do they'll vex
[2:10:53] you in the land wherein you live and
[2:10:55] when you take something i don't know why
[2:10:56] i'm saying this but i'm going to obey
[2:10:57] the holy spirit here before you're
[2:10:59] married you better you better say lord i
[2:11:02] want to read out and root out everything
[2:11:04] that's unlike you lord i don't want to
[2:11:06] take this into my marriage
[2:11:10] and let it vex me in the land of my
[2:11:12] marriage
[2:11:13] i want to deal with it now
[2:11:16] say brother matt what's your
[2:11:17] recommendation what's the prerequisite
[2:11:19] for marriage get the baptism of the holy
[2:11:22] ghost
[2:11:25] makes all the difference
[2:11:27] means you'll have a perfect marriage
[2:11:30] wrong answer
[2:11:33] but it means it won't be two it'll be
[2:11:35] three
[2:11:38] two individuals it'll be three who unify
[2:11:40] into one
[2:11:42] you could always consult that third
[2:11:44] person
[2:11:45] you can always go to him and say lord i
[2:11:47] we need you right now
[2:11:48] brother adam says in forgiveness till
[2:11:50] the spirit of christ comes in then that
[2:11:53] will be a paradox in itself to take the
[2:11:55] very nature of a boy that's bred between
[2:11:57] father and mother yet in his
[2:11:59] intellectuals he's trying his best to
[2:12:01] overcome it he can't do it friend in
[2:12:05] your best of intellectuals you will
[2:12:07] never overcome it
[2:12:09] he can't do it
[2:12:13] he'll never
[2:12:15] overcome it
[2:12:16] christ
[2:12:17] will have to overcome it
[2:12:21] when he lets christ in
[2:12:23] then he's already overcome
[2:12:26] it'll be a perfect paradox when a man is
[2:12:29] born of the spirit
[2:12:31] of god
[2:12:33] because he tears down the high place
[2:12:36] there was one man a man named two men
[2:12:38] actually but we're gonna read a one
[2:12:40] hezekiah remember those kings we read
[2:12:42] about we're closing right here now that
[2:12:44] came to pass in the third year of hoshea
[2:12:46] son of eli allah king of israel the
[2:12:47] hezekiah the son of ahaz king of judah
[2:12:49] began to reign 25 years old to begin to
[2:12:51] reign he reigned 29 years in jerusalem
[2:12:53] his mother's name was abby the daughter
[2:12:54] of zechariah and he did that which was
[2:12:57] say it together right
[2:12:59] in the sight of the lord but there's
[2:13:00] going to be a difference between
[2:13:01] hezekiah and azariah and uzziah notice
[2:13:04] what the bible says he did that which
[2:13:06] was right in the sign of the lord
[2:13:07] according to all that
[2:13:11] david
[2:13:12] his father wasn't david
[2:13:14] but god traces the lineage and says
[2:13:16] you're going to go remember what brother
[2:13:17] branham said it's not your parents
[2:13:19] anymore it goes beyond that generation
[2:13:21] before you now it goes to your father
[2:13:23] christ
[2:13:25] and you reflect your father christ
[2:13:27] you're looking you look like your father
[2:13:29] you talk like your heavenly father the
[2:13:32] bible says he did that which was right
[2:13:33] in the sign of the lord according to all
[2:13:34] that david his father did the very next
[2:13:37] verse
[2:13:38] he removed the high
[2:13:41] places
[2:13:42] and broke the images and cut down the
[2:13:44] groves and broke into pieces the brazen
[2:13:46] serpent why because he was how was any
[2:13:50] different brother that was any different
[2:13:51] than azerite no was it any different
[2:13:53] than usain no was it different than the
[2:13:55] amish mri no it wasn't any different
[2:13:57] than any of them the only difference was
[2:13:59] he had a father who didn't serve the
[2:14:01] lord but hezekiah said i'm not going to
[2:14:04] go just as far as the previous
[2:14:06] generation because i can do all things
[2:14:09] through christ who gives me strength and
[2:14:11] i choose to break
[2:14:16] that generational curse out of my life
[2:14:20] i choose to break it
[2:14:23] here
[2:14:24] and i'm not going to let it go any
[2:14:26] further
[2:14:29] you ever tried to give something up
[2:14:32] you ever tried to give something up
[2:14:36] sometimes you give things up other times
[2:14:38] you try to give things up
[2:14:40] you try and you try and you try
[2:14:42] you come back
[2:14:44] time and time and time again
[2:14:46] failure time and time and time again
[2:14:48] tried it so many times try to get rid of
[2:14:50] that sin
[2:14:54] like a little thistle like a little
[2:14:55] thorn it grew back even stronger in your
[2:14:57] life
[2:15:00] and people could get to the point where
[2:15:02] they give up musicians could you come i
[2:15:04] want you to know i'm finished here
[2:15:07] musicians
[2:15:09] people get to the point to where they
[2:15:11] they get discouraged and they give up
[2:15:14] no matter what it is in their life no
[2:15:15] matter what vice or what sin
[2:15:18] enemy throws it right back in your face
[2:15:22] all the way from solomon all the way to
[2:15:24] hezekiah you have 30
[2:15:27] kings
[2:15:30] 30 men
[2:15:32] if you could play something softly
[2:15:38] you have 30 men 30 kings
[2:15:40] from solomon to hezekiah 30 12
[2:15:45] kings of judah 18 notice
[2:15:48] and all of those
[2:15:51] failed to remove failed to
[2:15:53] go further
[2:15:55] always came back to that one thing
[2:15:57] even good men
[2:16:00] asa was a good man
[2:16:04] ace a lot of them is life joseph fat
[2:16:08] take good kings good men but that high
[2:16:10] place that little thing
[2:16:12] always stayed there
[2:16:14] something something in his life just
[2:16:17] couldn't figure it out didn't know why
[2:16:19] [Music]
[2:16:21] but there came a there came something
[2:16:23] inside of hezekiah's heart as a young
[2:16:25] man
[2:16:27] bow your head's with me every head bowed
[2:16:29] ever i closed
[2:16:34] [Music]
[2:16:38] somewhere
[2:16:40] inside hezekiah's heart
[2:16:43] god began to do a work
[2:16:45] it's a work of the holy spirit
[2:16:47] it's the same work that needs to happen
[2:16:48] in every teenager
[2:16:50] under the sound of my voice every young
[2:16:52] person
[2:16:54] maybe you're not a teenager maybe you're
[2:16:56] later down in life
[2:16:58] somewhere christ has got to come in and
[2:17:00] make the difference
[2:17:06] though he's trying his best to overcome
[2:17:09] it with all his intellect he's trying
[2:17:11] he's trying greater teeth iron will
[2:17:13] trying
[2:17:14] brother adam says
[2:17:16] but he can't he'll never overcome it
[2:17:20] christ
[2:17:21] will have to come and overcome it
[2:17:25] that's what makes the difference
[2:17:29] [Music]
[2:17:33] lord jesus
[2:17:35] bow my head today father
[2:17:39] [Music]
[2:17:41] knowing lord that your word
[2:17:43] was your word that it went forth
[2:17:47] and i know lord jesus that it dropped
[2:17:48] down into avenues
[2:17:52] beyond avenues of people's heart it went
[2:17:54] to addresses and knocked on the door
[2:17:58] [Music]
[2:17:59] and i pray lord as it knocks on that
[2:18:01] heart
[2:18:02] this morning that that that one

[2:18:15] knocked on that heart
[2:18:18] that there would be a response
[2:18:21] [Music]
[2:18:24] there would be something lord that
[2:18:26] down inside of the inside of the inside
[2:18:30] maybe it has to go past all the layers
[2:18:33] and layers and layers and layers
[2:18:36] what we thought
[2:18:39] what's happened
[2:18:41] where we feel like we are
[2:18:44] [Music]
[2:18:46] i pray lord that that word would
[2:18:49] that individual would
[2:18:51] respond
[2:18:53] that's all lord

[2:18:59] whatever way they respond lord as long
[2:19:01] as they respond
[2:19:04] i pray it'd be more than just weeping
[2:19:06] be more than just a conviction be more
[2:19:08] than just a even just
