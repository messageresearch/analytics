[16:16] was arranged because the faithful were
[16:19] told that they had to gather in
[16:20] jerusalem three times a year and shavuot
[16:23] what we call pentecost was one of those
[16:25] times to set the stage so that peter

[16:31] people could be baptized the church
[16:35] could be born and we're so grateful that

[24:56] him in prayer this evening father we
[24:58] thank you for your presence lord we
[25:00] thank you lord that we can sing the
[25:02] songs of zion this evening and we'll
[25:04] just worship you here in spirit and in
[25:07] truth this evening father we just look
[25:09] forward to what you would have in store
[25:10] for the young people god we just pray
[25:12] you'll know on our lips to speak the
[25:14] words that would just encourage them
[25:16] lord just in the back praying and just
[25:18] talking to you about the things lord as
[25:20] a young person we all hear once were
[25:23] father we know those struggles
[25:25] we know the difficulties lord that a
[25:27] young person faced
[25:28] and lord we're just asking that you
[25:30] would speak intimately directly
[25:32] lord to their needs this evening so we
[25:35] just want to yield ourselves to you lord
[25:37] this evening for whatever time you want
[25:39] to speak father we just want to have you
[25:40] let you have the preeminence in this
[25:42] service not only in the service but in
[25:44] our hearts and our lives lord and we
[25:46] just want to say thank you father for
[25:48] the opportunity it's in jesus name
[25:51] amen if you have your bibles you can
[25:53] turn to romans 9 and as you're turning
[25:54] there just want to read a portion of
[25:56] scripture here in john but i want you to
[25:58] turn to romans 9.
[26:02] this is john 21 and verse 15. it says so
[26:04] when they had done jesus saith to simon
[26:07] peter simon
[26:08] son of jonah loveth thou me more than
[26:11] these he saith unto him yea lord knowest
[26:14] thou that i love thee and he saith unto
[26:16] him feed my lambs
[26:19] and in verse 16 and he said to him again
[26:21] the second time son of jonas our simon
[26:24] son of jonas loveth thou me and he said
[26:26] unto him yea lord thou knowest that i
[26:29] love thee and he saith unto him feed my
[26:32] sheep so we understand that preaching of
[26:34] the gospel is not only feeding the sheep
[26:36] but it's also feeding the lambs and as i
[26:38] was preparing this weekend or this past
[26:41] week we just got in from newfoundland
[26:43] canada
[26:44] and knew it knowing that we would have a
[26:45] week home or a sunday home and then we'd
[26:47] be out here and just praying lord give
[26:50] us the direction for the services the
[26:52] lord spoke to me earlier this week said
[26:54] won't you take sunday evening and speak
[26:56] to the young people
[26:58] and so i was in the back as uh earlier
[27:00] this morning and i asked brother aaron i
[27:01] said when's the last time
[27:03] that there was a service dedicated to
[27:05] the young young people of tucson
[27:07] tabernacle he said well it's it's been
[27:09] quite a long time
[27:10] i said well that's fine because god laid
[27:12] it on my heart to do this and i
[27:15] understand that you know uh his daughter
[27:17] i think his sister elizabeth had
[27:19] mentioned to him and he was supposed to
[27:20] reach out to me to see if i would do it
[27:22] but see god's working on both the end so
[27:24] god knew this weekend would be here he
[27:26] knew exactly what needed to be said and
[27:27] how it needed to be said so it should
[27:29] let us know even
[27:31] in where we are right now that god is
[27:33] mindful of you he's mindful of the
[27:35] church and not only that he's mindful of
[27:37] your young people so god is concerned
[27:39] god is and he is here i believe tonight
[27:41] just to speak something i'm not sure how
[27:43] long i'll hold you i promise you it
[27:45] won't be two or three hours y'all can
[27:47] size our relief
[27:49] i know there's cakes in there we're
[27:50] going to sample after service and i'm a
[27:52] cake man i'm ready
[27:54] we can say amen dismiss let's go eat
[27:56] cake and had service right but we're
[27:58] going to give you some word just a
[27:59] little bit
[28:00] romans 9 and verse 1 says i say the
[28:02] truth in christ i lie not my conscience
[28:05] also bearing me witness in the holy
[28:06] ghost that i have great heaviness and
[28:09] continuous sorrow in my heart
[28:11] for i could wish that myself were a
[28:13] curse from christ for my brethren my
[28:15] kinsmen according to the flesh who are
[28:17] israelites to whom pertaineth the
[28:19] adoption and the glory and the covenants
[28:21] and the giving of the law and the
[28:23] service of god and the promises
[28:26] for who are the fathers and of whom as
[28:28] concerning the flesh christ came who is
[28:31] over all god bless forever amen but not
[28:33] all not as though the world the word of
[28:37] god hath taken none effect
[28:40] for they that are not all israel which
[28:42] are israel neither because they are
[28:44] seated abraham are they all children but
[28:46] in isaac shall thy seed be called
[28:49] this or that is they which are the
[28:52] children of the flesh these are not the
[28:53] children of god but the children of the
[28:56] promise are counted for seed for this is
[28:58] a word of promise at that time will i
[29:01] come and sarah shall have a son
[29:03] and not only this but when rebecca also
[29:06] had conceived by one even by our father
[29:08] isaac for the children yet the children
[29:11] being not born yet born neither having
[29:14] done good or evil that the purpose of
[29:16] god according to election might stand
[29:19] not of works but a hymn that calleth god
[29:22] bless you you can have your seats this
[29:24] evening
[29:25] i just want to take a few minutes this
[29:27] evening just to kind of speak to the
[29:28] young people where's the young people at
[29:30] raise your hand young people all right
[29:32] everybody should have their hands raised
[29:34] right we're all young people but we're
[29:36] actually going to be directing the
[29:38] service tonight to those that are
[29:40] relatively 24 and under
[29:43] and i want to speak to you on you have a
[29:44] purpose
[29:46] if you have a purpose this word purpose
[29:48] here is a reason for which something
[29:50] exists or is done
[29:52] the reason why something is made or
[29:54] reason why something is used
[29:57] many times if we're all honest with
[29:59] ourselves and you adults you can
[30:01] reminisce back when you was a child when
[30:03] you was going through puberty and you
[30:05] was going through your teenage years and
[30:07] those adolescent years and there's been
[30:09] a lot of times you wondered what is my
[30:11] purpose
[30:15] have y'all ever wondered that or maybe
[30:17] here in tucson you exactly know what god
[30:19] has for you
[30:21] what is my purpose or do i even have a
[30:24] purpose
[30:26] you know and sometimes we think just
[30:28] because our life in our life we go
[30:30] through trials and as a young person you
[30:33] know there's that stage where you're
[30:34] trying to fit into this group or you're
[30:36] trying to be accepted and you just kind
[30:38] of you're kind of backwards you're kind
[30:40] of awkward right
[30:42] i got a couple of honest people here
[30:44] this this evening hey man yeah i'll take
[30:46] that brother whoever said that i'm not
[30:48] gonna call your name i know who you were
[30:50] but we find that fitting in sometimes is
[30:53] so awkward
[30:55] you know you want to be in the clique
[30:57] right
[30:59] come on church we all want to be
[31:01] accepted
[31:02] and yet we find sometimes we have
[31:04] struggle with our acceptance and our
[31:06] purpose what does god have me to do this
[31:08] and god has me to do that and i've dealt
[31:10] in a lot of prayer lines with young
[31:11] people and one of the common themes in a
[31:14] youth service or a a prayer line that
[31:16] you deal with young people is brother
[31:18] joe i just want to know what my purpose
[31:20] is
[31:21] and that would br that that very
[31:24] question is what brings me to this
[31:25] thought today because as i was preparing
[31:28] for canada
[31:30] i had completely a different direction i
[31:31] was going to go and one night god said i
[31:33] want you to speak you have a purpose and
[31:35] that night i had to get home get in
[31:37] there and i preached on a saturday night
[31:39] and i knew i was going to have or it was
[31:41] actually preached on sunday and we were
[31:42] out tour in newfoundland canada if
[31:44] you've never been there go it's
[31:45] beautiful but on tuesday night the lord
[31:47] dropped it in my heart you're gonna
[31:48] speak this so i was up till midnight
[31:50] preparing to speak to them on wednesday
[31:52] night to the young people
[31:54] and in that we find that we all struggle
[31:57] at certain times in our life well what
[31:59] is my purpose what has god called me to
[32:02] do
[32:04] what is my purpose i'm not worried about
[32:06] brother aaron's purpose he that's for
[32:07] him to figure out
[32:09] but tonight what about me what about my
[32:11] christian what about my journey in life
[32:13] what about my future what about my
[32:15] career what about these aspects of my
[32:18] life god what is my purpose what is my
[32:21] reason for being why am i in existence
[32:26] sometimes we think well let's make a lot
[32:28] of money
[32:29] i remember as a young kid i was very
[32:32] y'all probably wouldn't recognize but
[32:34] i'm very motivated
[32:36] i'm i'm very driven i got a lot of drive
[32:38] i don't have to be slapped them and
[32:39] beating the head i'm prodded and whooped
[32:41] because i'm getting up every day at 6 30
[32:43] i'm getting life started i'm not going
[32:44] to wait and i've been like that all my
[32:46] life and my wife will tell you sometimes
[32:48] you got to put a bridle in my mouth and
[32:50] pull the reins back because i'm moving
[32:51] ahead
[32:53] but in my years before i was saved as a
[32:56] as a non-believer as a
[32:58] if we want to call it a center i was
[33:00] determined i was going to make something
[33:02] out of my life i grew up very poor and
[33:04] i'm just going to share some testimony
[33:06] and just share my heart with you because
[33:07] you have a purpose young people no
[33:09] matter what kind of background you come
[33:11] from what kind of life you come from you
[33:13] have a purpose for god placing you here
[33:17] god placing you in this age god placing
[33:19] you in this state and god placing you in
[33:22] this church you have a purpose
[33:25] and i recall as a young person my
[33:27] parents were divorced when i was two
[33:29] years old and from that time you know as
[33:32] a young boy you want your dad
[33:35] and then you struggle and you fight and
[33:36] dad's not there he's in the picture one
[33:38] day and he's out of the picture the next
[33:39] and it's all this topsy-turvy and your
[33:42] life is all a mess and you watch your
[33:44] parents see in a divorce
[33:47] it's not so much the parents that hurt
[33:49] it's the children that hurt
[33:51] and i had a lot of built up animosity
[33:53] toward my parents as a even as a
[33:54] teenager because the road that they were
[33:56] taking us down i looked at it and i
[33:59] couldn't have friends over because my
[34:00] parents did drugs
[34:02] and so because they did drugs i was
[34:04] embarrassed of the childhood i had i was
[34:06] embarrassed of my family i was
[34:08] embarrassed and it brought a lot of
[34:09] shame and it brought a lot of things in
[34:10] it made me question well what is your
[34:12] purpose
[34:13] and from that point i was determined my
[34:16] wife would testify i'm not like any of
[34:18] my siblings completely different
[34:21] because i used what the devil meant for
[34:24] evil and allowed it to motivate me to be
[34:26] successful
[34:28] now my success in my mind was i was
[34:30] going to be the first one and i was the
[34:32] first one in my family to ever go to
[34:34] college
[34:35] to graduate college
[34:37] and to get a real paying job you know we
[34:40] think well real paying job yeah
[34:41] sometimes
[34:43] a real paying job is a plus
[34:45] but i used that childhood
[34:48] all that hurt to motivate me and i was
[34:51] determined that i was going to be
[34:53] successful
[34:55] i was going to be a lawyer well that
[34:57] fell through because i realized when i
[34:58] got to school i ain't sticking this out
[35:00] i'm not peter
[35:03] peter he may be unassuming but he's very
[35:05] intelligent he's got he's cut out for it
[35:07] i'm just an accountant right i got to
[35:09] settle for second best
[35:11] and so i was determined i was gonna i
[35:13] was gonna do something in business
[35:15] because i kind of fell away from the law
[35:17] part and when i first my first day in
[35:20] college i never looked back i said i'm
[35:22] going to do this i'm going to go and
[35:23] what made me decide i'm just giving
[35:25] y'all personal personal accounts now
[35:27] don't follow my example young people on
[35:29] this one so my first classes i had a
[35:31] finance class and an accounting class
[35:33] and i didn't know what i was going to do
[35:34] just yet but i said you know what
[35:36] whichever one i do better in that's what
[35:38] i'm going to major in
[35:40] well i squeaked by and got an a i got to
[35:42] a in both but i had a higher a in
[35:44] accounting than i did finance see i
[35:46] didn't know what my career or what my
[35:48] life was going to bring i'm just
[35:49] thinking well this sounds good right i
[35:51] made better obviously i'm better
[35:53] accounted than i am in finance so i
[35:55] chose that career
[35:56] but see god knew exactly where he was
[35:58] going to place me
[36:00] and god knew what degree that i needed
[36:02] that would suit the need so that god can
[36:04] use that because see i had a purpose
[36:07] now i didn't rightly know my purpose i
[36:09] thought well i'm just going to be a
[36:11] businessman i'm going to make something
[36:12] myself and this is before i got saved
[36:15] i was going to make all the money that i
[36:17] can and get all that i can and do
[36:19] everything that i can i wasn't worried
[36:21] about a wife i wasn't worried about
[36:22] these things i was worried about one
[36:23] thing and that's not being poor
[36:27] because we grew up poor my mom was a
[36:28] single single mother raising three kids
[36:31] working herself to death trying to raise
[36:32] three kids and it's very difficult as a
[36:34] single parent but yet and i struggle
[36:37] with what my purpose was and then i
[36:38] slanted that purpose to be career-minded
[36:41] career-minded career-minded
[36:42] career-minded
[36:44] i'm like this is the reason why i'm here
[36:45] i'm not going to be like my family i'm
[36:47] going to be the ones going to break that
[36:48] cycle i'm going to do this but when i
[36:50] got to i was about 21-22 i gave my heart
[36:52] to the lord and from that point on
[36:56] i told the lord then i said i will not
[36:57] let money dictate my future
[37:02] i will not let money
[37:03] dictate my future
[37:06] in church i've had countless offers
[37:08] through my career
[37:10] hundreds of thousands of dollars to go
[37:13] move and to get away from the church and
[37:16] to go to some other hospital somewhere
[37:18] else that offered 200 plus thousand
[37:20] dollars a year even before i decided to
[37:23] go full time
[37:25] but see you had to determine what is my
[37:27] purpose my purpose now is not to chase a
[37:29] dollar
[37:31] purpose now is to serve god
[37:33] and so each of you here you have a
[37:35] purpose and sometimes satan will use
[37:37] your past
[37:38] he will use your family dynamics he'll
[37:41] use those things that come against you
[37:43] to try to detour you if we would say or
[37:46] distract you from what your real purpose
[37:48] in life is
[37:49] so that's why we want to speak to you
[37:51] this evening on you have a purpose god
[37:54] has a reason for you being here and as
[37:57] we look back at the scripture it says
[37:58] for the children being not yet born
[38:03] not yet born neither having done good or
[38:05] evil they hadn't done good or evil
[38:07] nothing but the purpose of god according
[38:10] to election might stand not a works but
[38:13] at him that calleth and the word
[38:15] election here is the act of god's free
[38:18] will by which before the foundation of
[38:20] the world he decreed his blessings upon
[38:24] a certain person
[38:26] so god's purpose in your life is based
[38:29] on his election and his election is his
[38:32] decree that he places on you because of
[38:35] his own free will
[38:39] see god has to create his blessings on
[38:41] each of you here this evening in john 15
[38:44] and verse 16 the bible says that you
[38:46] have not chosen me but i have chosen you
[38:51] what a consolation
[38:54] you know sometimes we think well i chose
[38:55] god i sought god i thought that when i
[38:57] was 22 i'm seeking god no i wasn't
[39:00] seeking god god taught me and so if god
[39:02] thought so much of me to seek me out
[39:05] when he could have sought anybody out
[39:07] then surely god won't throw me away
[39:10] and that's how we have to look at it now
[39:11] if you sought god out and yet you found
[39:14] favor with god there's be something in
[39:16] the back of your mind so well i did this
[39:17] i did this and then god can disregard
[39:20] you but when god seeks you out and god
[39:23] places you in his hand and god comes
[39:25] into your life and it's nothing that we
[39:27] have to do with it then surely god will
[39:29] not discard me because god has a purpose
[39:32] for doing what he's done in my life
[39:36] so we'd ask ourselves
[39:38] what is my purpose we look at the life
[39:40] of job and we look back and we think
[39:42] about my how could god use that
[39:45] situation for his prophet and we look in
[39:48] job 1 and verse 6 and it says now there
[39:51] was a day when the sons of god came to
[39:53] present themselves before the lord and
[39:55] satan came also
[39:59] excuse me how to set my time or y'all
[40:00] got all that for free
[40:02] satan came also among them and the lord
[40:04] said unto satan whence cometh thou and
[40:08] satan asked the lord and said from going
[40:09] to and fro in the earth and from walking
[40:11] up and down in it and the lord said unto
[40:13] satan hast thou considered my servant
[40:15] job that there is none like him in the
[40:17] in the earth a perfect and an upright
[40:19] man one that feareth god and his skew is
[40:21] evil and satan answered the lord and
[40:24] said doeth job fear god for naught
[40:27] has not thou made a hedge about him
[40:29] about his house and about all that he
[40:31] has on every sign that thou has blessed
[40:33] the work of his hands and his substances
[40:35] increased in his land so satan is
[40:37] accusing god of blessing job and saying
[40:41] that's the only reason why job serves
[40:43] you
[40:45] but god was going to show otherwise
[40:47] because god said i got a purpose for job
[40:50] and just as i have a purpose for job i
[40:52] got a purpose for you and i got a
[40:53] purpose for everything that i allow you
[40:55] to go through
[40:57] he says now put for now satan is still
[41:00] continually speaking he says put forth
[41:01] thy hand now and touch all that he hath
[41:03] and he will curse thee to thy face and
[41:04] the lord said unto satan behold all that
[41:06] he hath is in thy power only upon him
[41:09] putting not forth thy hand so satan went
[41:11] forth from the presence of the lord so
[41:13] here we find god
[41:15] asking satan have you carefully observed
[41:18] my servant job then he goes on to brag
[41:21] about job there's none like him in all
[41:24] the earth look at job he's perfect that
[41:26] word perfect means he's morally innocent
[41:29] he has integrity he's complete and the
[41:32] spirit the scripture says he's upright
[41:34] otherwise he's a righteous man he fears
[41:37] god he reverences god he excuse evil
[41:40] otherwise he departs from evil
[41:43] and satan decides that he has no
[41:45] confidence in human ability he says if
[41:48] you remove your hands off of job's life
[41:51] and let me
[41:53] come against job i will get him to curse
[41:55] you
[41:56] see satan did have confidence in what
[41:58] god has placed in job but see god had a
[42:02] purpose for allowing job to go through
[42:04] the trial that he went through and god
[42:06] has a purpose for each of us in the
[42:08] trials that we go through for the
[42:10] scripture says that we know that all
[42:12] things work together
[42:14] now sometimes it's hard for our finite
[42:16] minds
[42:19] to comprehend how is this working again
[42:22] god
[42:24] how is this benefiting me
[42:27] because we look at it from that aspect
[42:29] we heard the famous saying god loves a
[42:32] cheerful giver you're not out give god
[42:34] how many's ever heard that how many has
[42:35] ever said that
[42:36] and sometimes we think man we're just
[42:38] gonna give and give and give
[42:40] and thinking that we're gonna get it
[42:42] back in return but you know what god's
[42:44] return on the investment that you make
[42:46] by giving is not always a financial
[42:49] return
[42:53] see sometimes that return is your
[42:56] children
[42:58] sometimes that return is the salvation
[43:01] of a young person
[43:03] i was up in newfoundland canada and
[43:04] there was a young girl about 16 17 years
[43:07] old and she was ready to pack her bags
[43:09] and leave the house go out
[43:11] and just do whatever she was ready to
[43:13] quit the private school go back to
[43:14] public school leave her family the
[43:16] church was torn up about this because
[43:18] they seen this girl begin to pull back
[43:20] and pull back and regress and regress
[43:22] and i told my wife it was a saturday
[43:24] night i said god is gonna do something
[43:26] special tonight i said i don't know why
[43:28] but i feel something come over me
[43:31] that god's gonna do something special
[43:34] and that night there was a prayer line
[43:36] that formed
[43:38] and she stepped into that prayer line
[43:41] and the spirit of discern began to
[43:42] discern her heart and the spirit of god
[43:44] began to deal with her and deal with her
[43:46] and before she left that prayer line she
[43:48] was a different person
[43:50] because see because somebody paid in
[43:53] and the dividend wasn't a financial
[43:55] return the dividend was a soul of a
[43:58] young person and from saturday night to
[44:00] wednesday night when i preached
[44:01] wednesday night when you have a purpose
[44:03] her countenance changed i mean you'd
[44:06] have you'd have to been there and seen
[44:08] what i'm talking about you're talking
[44:10] about somebody who didn't want to be in
[44:11] the house of god somebody who was done
[44:13] packed their bags mentally then checked
[44:15] out on the message then checked out on
[44:17] god to somebody now who's the first one
[44:19] standing up worshiping god on a
[44:21] wednesday night and just the joy of the
[44:23] lord illuminating and displaying all
[44:25] over her face
[44:27] see i didn't have anything to do with
[44:28] that
[44:30] but the parents were paying in
[44:32] paying in when you bring them to church
[44:35] i know they kick and scream sometimes
[44:37] don't they
[44:38] do we have to go
[44:41] yes
[44:42] you're paying in because there's going
[44:43] to be a return on that investment
[44:45] because god has a purpose
[44:47] it has a purpose for every individual
[44:49] that's here tonight
[44:50] to bless you maybe not in the way you
[44:53] expect to be blessed but in the way that
[44:55] he wants to bless you and the prophet of
[44:57] god when we look at the life of job and
[44:59] we see his trials he lost his wealth he
[45:01] lost his children he had a nagging old
[45:04] wife
[45:07] man she hounded him every day come on
[45:09] honey just curse god
[45:12] just curse god get this over with
[45:14] thank god none of you have wives like
[45:16] that right brother dan
[45:18] that's better be amen that's exactly
[45:21] right
[45:22] you know if you didn't say amen we're
[45:23] gonna be in trouble after service
[45:25] i'll help you though we'll team up
[45:27] but he he lost all these things
[45:30] but see the thing that job wasn't
[45:33] privy to was the conversation that god
[45:36] had with satan regarding job's life
[45:40] have you considered
[45:42] my servant job
[45:44] see god know he placed him on earth for
[45:46] a purpose and satan declared well you've
[45:48] blessed him that's the only reason why
[45:51] he serves you but yet when god allows
[45:54] satan to strip everything away god still
[45:57] had a purpose and job was that purpose
[45:59] because job god was using job to tell
[46:02] satan no matter what you do you don't
[46:04] have enough
[46:06] that my true sons and daughters of god
[46:08] will not curse me
[46:11] they will bless my name they will honor
[46:13] my name they will assemble themselves
[46:15] together they will approach the throne
[46:17] of mercy
[46:19] and we find that the prophet of god will
[46:22] tell us
[46:23] that god purged job with the intent to
[46:27] bless job
[46:28] that's hard to fathom ain't it
[46:31] purged him put him through hell so that
[46:34] he can bless him in the end
[46:36] because god had a purpose
[46:41] and sometimes god allows the devil to do
[46:43] you and i the same way especially you
[46:45] young people you're at a very pivotal
[46:48] point in life
[46:51] right now in your youth
[46:53] you can be swayed this way and you can
[46:55] be swayed that way
[46:57] and you've got the world pulling on you
[46:58] just like job he had satan just there to
[47:01] ridicule to accuse you've done this and
[47:03] you're a secret sinner and the world is
[47:05] constantly pulling on you
[47:08] and it depermans
[47:09] which dog you feed the most
[47:12] whether you feed the black dog or
[47:13] whether you feed the white dog are you
[47:15] feeding in the message are you reading
[47:16] the word of god are you praying the way
[47:18] you should
[47:19] or are you giving in to the enticements
[47:21] of the world see satan knew
[47:25] where man's weakness is
[47:28] and god also knows that in that weakness
[47:30] he said i'll be strong
[47:33] so we all have our own weakness and your
[47:35] weakness may be different than my
[47:36] weakness and my weakness may be
[47:38] different than your weakness but yet god
[47:40] places those things in your life for a
[47:41] purpose so that he can get honor
[47:44] because even when the devil exploits
[47:46] your weakness god says i'm going to have
[47:48] complete honor
[47:50] and no matter what they're going through
[47:52] they will not curse me
[47:54] and i believe god has found young people
[47:56] in this hour with that same
[47:58] determination no matter what we see no
[48:00] matter what we face no matter what we
[48:02] endure i'm here to serve a purpose and
[48:06] many times we ask ourselves why why me
[48:09] being a christian with this would this
[48:11] be this way how many have ever asked
[48:13] that
[48:14] why me god i thought i was a christian i
[48:17] thought i was a believer i thought i was
[48:20] a son of god well lord you told me my
[48:21] name was joseph blessed and highly
[48:23] favored i don't feel blessed and i don't
[48:25] feel favored
[48:27] and we wonder sometimes and we ask that
[48:30] but yet the prophet of god will say god
[48:31] is the only one that has the right to
[48:34] say why
[48:35] why didn't you accept my way why didn't
[48:37] you accept my word why didn't you accept
[48:39] my prophet why didn't you accept this
[48:41] god's the only one that has the right to
[48:43] say why
[48:45] so we find now there's a law contrast
[48:47] working in our lives there's good and
[48:49] there's evil there's valleys in our
[48:51] mountaintops and so god allows you to
[48:53] have a mountaintop young person so that
[48:55] when you're in your valley you know that
[48:56] this is not a permanent place there's a
[48:58] mountaintop just ahead
[49:01] and it gives you the mountain top so you
[49:03] can be encouraged when you hit the
[49:05] valley that you're coming out of it it's
[49:07] not a permanent place
[49:09] see brother brown will tell us in the
[49:10] message i know he says now satan had
[49:12] touched job for a purpose to try him
[49:15] because he and god had a debate
[49:19] and satan's had a debate for you young
[49:21] people look i'll
[49:22] i won't give them a pastor
[49:24] now i'm just using that because we don't
[49:26] have a pastor right but i'll use it i'll
[49:28] get them to have no confidence in the
[49:30] ministry that comes through here they
[49:32] don't have really what's going on it's
[49:33] just all chaos you know there's no
[49:36] really no order here and and he starts
[49:38] working on your intellect and working on
[49:41] your mind so you don't have confidence
[49:43] and he's doing that to try to sway you
[49:46] but god has a purpose for everything
[49:48] that he permits and allows satan to do
[49:50] to our lives
[49:53] so god told satan i got a servant on the
[49:55] earth there's none like him whatever i
[49:57] say to him he will do it he's a perfect
[49:59] man a just man now how many wants that
[50:02] testimony he's a perfect man he's a just
[50:04] man we all want that testimony but we
[50:07] don't want to go through what job went
[50:08] through to get it
[50:11] there's the difference we want the
[50:14] accolades we want the prestige we want
[50:15] the praise man brother joe's a good man
[50:18] but you don't know the pain that brother
[50:20] joe's been through
[50:21] he don't know the disappointments that
[50:23] he's been through
[50:24] you don't understand that i don't have a
[50:26] relationship with many of my family
[50:27] members because i decided to put this
[50:29] message first and foremost in my life
[50:31] and they decided to go the way of the
[50:33] world
[50:34] and so there's always that barrier
[50:36] there's always that pain there's always
[50:38] that hurt
[50:40] but god has a purpose
[50:42] and he has a purpose for my life when we
[50:45] had our first child lauren i had to make
[50:47] my mind up and i had to stand and
[50:49] sometimes standing for the truth and
[50:52] standing for righteousness when it means
[50:54] standing against your family members it
[50:56] can be very tough
[50:57] it can be very difficult but god's
[51:00] called us to not compromise but to stand
[51:02] on the word of god
[51:05] because he's calling you for a purpose
[51:07] and young person you got to make your
[51:08] mind up i'm going to stand for what is
[51:11] right even now
[51:12] i'm going to start standing right now in
[51:15] this service i'm going to dedicate my
[51:17] heart to god i'm going to live for the
[51:19] lord because god has a purpose for me of
[51:22] being here and it's not just to breathe
[51:24] the oxygen
[51:26] it's not just to soak up the sunshine
[51:28] it's not to walk out there and be
[51:30] blasted by 100 degree heat no god placed
[51:32] you here for a purpose
[51:34] let me just say this nobody else
[51:37] can fulfill that purpose
[51:40] you know that there is a table set in
[51:42] heaven that's got every born-again
[51:45] believer's name on it
[51:48] there's a table there's a place you have
[51:50] a plate set at the table at the wedding
[51:54] supper and nobody can take your place
[51:58] and that should give you confidence
[52:00] i got a purpose
[52:02] god put my name on that place man and
[52:05] i'm going to sit right next to shamgar
[52:08] me and shamgar are going to have a
[52:10] wonderful time reminiscing about his
[52:12] victories and my victories
[52:14] i could just imagine oh shammy being
[52:16] about five foot six
[52:18] balding a little bit
[52:21] you know praise god is right
[52:24] you know full of energy full of life
[52:27] got to a point where he was beat down
[52:28] but he realized the god of abraham the
[52:30] god of isaac and the god of jacob is my
[52:32] god and i have rights i got a purpose
[52:36] and he grabbed the only thing that he
[52:37] had an ox gold and he
[52:41] proceeded to whoop philistines
[52:44] so you're never too young to start
[52:47] serving god
[52:49] my only wish today young person is that
[52:52] i would have served the lord when i was
[52:54] 14 and 15 when i felt in my junior high
[52:58] days to serve god
[53:01] but you know i was pulled by peer
[53:03] pressure how many ever felt peer
[53:04] pressure
[53:06] you know high school students you know
[53:08] and they want to pull you in to do this
[53:09] and they want to get you to do this try
[53:11] your first drink of alcohol try your
[53:12] first smoke a cigarette those things are
[53:14] real just because we believe the message
[53:16] doesn't mean that you're not uh prone to
[53:18] not having those things placed before
[53:20] you we all are placed before you and yet
[53:22] many times i felt
[53:24] i fell to those things
[53:26] because i didn't have any structure in
[53:28] the home life back home to support me
[53:30] and though i wanted to serve god when i
[53:32] was 14 i went to a pentecostal church
[53:35] for many years for about maybe six
[53:36] months to a year i went there and i
[53:38] really wanted to serve the lord
[53:40] but i couldn't because i was doing it
[53:43] all on my own
[53:45] but i knew there was a pool on the
[53:47] inside of serve god now i didn't know
[53:49] what that purpose was
[53:51] and then when i was 22
[53:53] i had a failed relationship and i was
[53:54] telling my wife we were just talking
[53:56] about that earlier today
[53:57] i had a relationship with a young lady
[53:59] that i thought i was going to marry one
[54:01] day and la la la la we know we've always
[54:03] some of us has had those and your heart
[54:04] broken but god used that situation to
[54:08] get me where i am today
[54:11] and i told earlier i said i would never
[54:12] i would do that every day of my life so
[54:15] that i could have a wife like you
[54:18] so that i could have children like we
[54:20] have so that i can have the life that
[54:22] i'm living now all that hurt all that
[54:25] pain i didn't understand the purpose of
[54:27] it
[54:29] because i was broken my heart was broken
[54:31] and my life seemed to be enshattered and
[54:33] i didn't have a desire and at one moment
[54:36] in my life i no longer had the zeal to
[54:38] live but i wanted to commit suicide
[54:41] but see god knows the end from the
[54:43] beginning
[54:45] so god knew where he'd purpose my life
[54:48] to be he knew what he placed on the
[54:50] inside of my life and yet i couldn't see
[54:53] it and there's a lot of times satan will
[54:55] blind you from seeing your purpose
[54:57] just hold on because he will bring it to
[54:59] manifestation
[55:02] see satan was adamant that if god
[55:04] removed his hand from job's life to job
[55:06] of cursing but god was adamant no matter
[55:07] what you do no matter the test no matter
[55:09] the accusations no matter the loss of
[55:11] loved ones no matter the sickness no
[55:13] matter the prodding from his wife no
[55:14] matter the trial
[55:16] god said job will not curse me
[55:19] he will not curse me see god had
[55:21] confidence in what he placed in job's
[55:23] life he placed a seed on the inside of
[55:26] job and there wasn't enough devils in
[55:28] hell could stop that seed from coming to
[55:30] life and that same god has that same
[55:33] confidence in you tonight
[55:36] he knew what age to put you in
[55:39] think about it you could have been in
[55:41] the first stage and it could have been
[55:42] horse and buggy or this however they
[55:44] made it around and you know you would
[55:46] have had the pressures of that age but
[55:48] he waited until this age
[55:51] and he placed you in this age the most
[55:54] wicked age in the most wicked time but
[55:57] yet the prophet of god will tell us it's
[55:59] the greatest of all ages because it's
[56:02] the blending of time with eternity
[56:05] there's going to be a people in this
[56:07] room tonight that is going to receive a
[56:09] body change and then a moment in the
[56:11] twinkling of an eye things are going to
[56:13] start breaking apart or however it takes
[56:15] place and we're going to see
[56:17] loved ones that have gone by the way of
[56:19] the grave they're going to come back in
[56:20] and they're not going to be old they're
[56:22] not going to be wrinkled they're not
[56:23] going to be stooped over they're going
[56:24] to be young again and when our eye
[56:26] system merely sees him walking through
[56:28] the door you know that the change is on
[56:31] and there ain't enough devils in hell
[56:33] can stop it
[56:35] because that's what god has purpose and
[56:37] he placed you here to live out that
[56:39] purpose god purpose in his heart that
[56:42] he's going to have an old person that's
[56:44] going to serve him to the bitter end
[56:46] he's going to have a young person that's
[56:47] going to dedicate their life and they're
[56:49] going to serve god from a young age all
[56:52] the way up they'll not they'll not move
[56:54] away from the dictations of the word of
[56:56] god they will serve god with a whole
[56:58] heart with a whole purpose if their
[57:00] whole mind they've dedicated their life
[57:02] god is purposed in his heart to bring a
[57:05] people to fruition and there's got to be
[57:07] a people in the end time that's purpose
[57:09] in their heart we're going to serve god
[57:10] no matter what no matter the pressure no
[57:13] matter the strain no matter the family
[57:15] dynamics no matter the trial that i go
[57:17] through no matter the sickness that the
[57:19] devil does i'm going to serve god
[57:22] because that's our purpose
[57:26] that's our purpose
[57:29] has our purpose tonight is to serve a
[57:32] living god to let the word of god be
[57:35] made manifest through your failed
[57:37] humanity
[57:40] how big is our god he knew your every
[57:43] weakness and yet he says i'm going to
[57:45] live through that weakness
[57:48] he knew your shortcomings and yet he
[57:50] says i'm going to manifest myself
[57:53] through their shortcomings
[57:57] you know what sometimes i think i'm
[57:58] always right
[58:01] yeah my is right
[58:03] sometimes we think we're always right
[58:07] but when you can recognize that you're
[58:08] wrong
[58:10] and then you recognize that god still
[58:12] uses you
[58:14] my what a promise
[58:16] that god even in my mistakes
[58:20] the bible says even when we're not
[58:22] faithful
[58:23] he remains faithful
[58:26] even when we fall not that we do it
[58:29] on purpose because the bible says that a
[58:31] son of god cannot sin because the seed
[58:33] of god remaineth in him
[58:36] that word practice or that word
[58:38] committed means to practice we don't
[58:40] practice sin we're not in the art of
[58:42] practicing sin that we do but we do fall
[58:45] we do fall short of the glory of god at
[58:47] times and yet because of that god still
[58:50] decides to use us anyway
[58:53] man we serve a mighty god
[58:56] i mean how wonderful is it brother aaron
[58:58] when you make mistakes and i know that
[59:00] your wife thinks man you're
[59:02] perfect don't say no right now
[59:06] i'm talking to her i'm looking at her
[59:07] but i'm pointing at you man he's perfect
[59:10] look at him tall dark and handsome
[59:14] never makes a mistake
[59:18] yeah i saw that
[59:20] sometimes that's what we think of the
[59:22] ministry too though
[59:24] they don't make mistakes no we're just
[59:26] as human as you're human
[59:29] we all have a purpose though
[59:31] and sometimes you young people think you
[59:32] don't have a part to play in an assembly
[59:36] you have a part to play in an assembly
[59:38] there's no church service complete
[59:40] without the young people in that church
[59:42] you understand what i'm saying there's
[59:44] no church service complete
[59:46] without the young people in the service
[59:49] our church our young people when they go
[59:51] off to camp meetings or they go off to
[59:53] special meetings when they leave it's a
[59:56] void in the church
[59:59] they played that much of a role
[1:00:01] in the service of the lord they have
[1:00:05] that much of an effect on the worship
[1:00:08] they have that much of an effect on the
[1:00:10] pulling of the gift of god through the
[1:00:11] ministry and you think god can't use you
[1:00:16] no don't sell yourself short don't let
[1:00:18] the devil pull the wool over your eyes
[1:00:19] you're a vital part of this congregation
[1:00:23] and furthermore you're a vital part of
[1:00:25] the family and the dynamics of god god's
[1:00:28] economy
[1:00:31] includes you
[1:00:33] god has a purpose
[1:00:35] and that purpose is to make sure that he
[1:00:37] places you in position
[1:00:39] and don't get out of position
[1:00:41] stay in your calling wherewith you have
[1:00:43] been called and in time you would reach
[1:00:46] that you'll know what that purpose is
[1:00:47] and that calling is
[1:00:49] so we find we think about well brother
[1:00:50] joe you talked about job and you you
[1:00:52] talked about all these different things
[1:00:53] you talked about your life but come on
[1:00:55] i'm a young person
[1:00:57] what about me how does this pertain to
[1:00:59] me well i'm glad you asked because
[1:01:01] there's three in particular young people
[1:01:03] that i want to speak about right now
[1:01:06] how many believe
[1:01:10] that trials will come
[1:01:14] hardships will come
[1:01:16] disappointments will come
[1:01:19] stay around long enough you'll find out
[1:01:23] and brother baby says when trials and
[1:01:24] troubles and heartaches and
[1:01:25] disappointments set in
[1:01:27] something holds
[1:01:29] see it's not you holding something's
[1:01:31] holding you it isn't the question
[1:01:32] whether i held on or not it's the
[1:01:34] question whether he held on or not so
[1:01:36] god called you and god doesn't call you
[1:01:39] to lose you
[1:01:41] god doesn't place you in his hands and
[1:01:43] holds you in his hands
[1:01:45] for you to fall through his hands
[1:01:48] no we're in the hands of god and
[1:01:50] the same hands that he
[1:01:52] blew off those the the milky way and the
[1:01:55] galaxies and the worlds that that we see
[1:01:58] out there the stars at night that same
[1:02:00] god is holding you tonight
[1:02:05] he had a purpose for doing it then and
[1:02:07] he has a purpose for doing it now
[1:02:09] and yet he formed you and he fashioned
[1:02:11] you into his image
[1:02:13] that's god's purpose for our life
[1:02:17] so we find now as we go back and we want
[1:02:19] to look not go back we want to look here
[1:02:21] briefly
[1:02:22] at these three hebrew children and i
[1:02:24] understand we sometimes we we read this
[1:02:27] and we only use them
[1:02:29] in
[1:02:30] the reference to young people
[1:02:33] because they were young people
[1:02:35] but i believe if you look i think we all
[1:02:37] can find our place there but for the
[1:02:39] sake of time tonight we are dealing with
[1:02:41] the young people and we wonder how can
[1:02:43] god use me i'm just a young person
[1:02:46] what can i do
[1:02:48] well let's just read the story is that
[1:02:50] okay we can read the story tonight on
[1:02:52] the young people
[1:02:53] of babylon
[1:02:55] it was probably around this kind of
[1:02:56] temperature outside 100 degrees
[1:02:58] it was on a sunday night service
[1:03:02] man come on you're a hard crowd to crack
[1:03:04] tonight
[1:03:05] just work with me give me just a laugh
[1:03:06] or chuckle or something
[1:03:08] a little slight amen a work i'm good
[1:03:11] daniel 3 and verse 8 wherefore at the
[1:03:14] time
[1:03:15] certain chaldeans came near and accused
[1:03:18] the jews and they spake and they said to
[1:03:20] the king nebuchadnezzar o king live
[1:03:23] forever
[1:03:24] thou o king has made a decree notice
[1:03:26] they reminded the king of the decree
[1:03:27] that he made that every man that shall
[1:03:30] hear the sound of the cornet the flute
[1:03:32] the harp the sackbut the sultry and the
[1:03:34] dulcimer and all kinds of music shall
[1:03:36] fall down and worship the golden image
[1:03:39] and whosoever falleth not down and
[1:03:41] worship it
[1:03:42] that he should be cast into the midst of
[1:03:44] a burning fiery furnace
[1:03:48] and there are certain jews whom thou
[1:03:50] said over the affairs of the province of
[1:03:52] babylon shadrach meshach and abednego
[1:03:55] these men o king have not regarded thee
[1:03:58] they serve not their gods nor worship
[1:04:00] the golden image with thou has set up
[1:04:02] notice this golden image was the image
[1:04:04] of daniel
[1:04:06] their friend
[1:04:08] a prophet
[1:04:10] but they also knew that
[1:04:12] exodus 34
[1:04:14] verse 14 said that for thou shall
[1:04:16] worship no other god
[1:04:19] for the lord whose name is jealous is a
[1:04:22] jealous god so they knew to only worship
[1:04:25] the one true living god
[1:04:28] then nebuchadnezzar in his rage and his
[1:04:30] fury he commanded to bring shadrach
[1:04:32] meshach and abednego then they brought
[1:04:34] these men before the king and
[1:04:36] nebuchadnezzar spake and he said unto
[1:04:37] them is it true o shadrach meshach and
[1:04:40] abednego do you not serve the gods no
[1:04:42] worship the golden image which i have
[1:04:44] set up
[1:04:45] now if you be ready that at the what
[1:04:48] time you hear the sound of the country
[1:04:50] music playing
[1:04:52] the sound
[1:04:54] of the rap music playing
[1:04:56] the sound of the rock music playing the
[1:04:59] sound of the mexican music playing
[1:05:03] i mean i guess y'all got mexican music
[1:05:04] here i'm just assuming i don't know
[1:05:07] it just leads to believe that we're in
[1:05:09] tucson
[1:05:11] but this time that you hear all these
[1:05:13] kinds of music
[1:05:15] that you don't fall down and worship the
[1:05:17] image which i have made well but if you
[1:05:20] worship not you shall be cast that same
[1:05:22] hour in the midst of the burning fiery
[1:05:24] furnace and who is the god that shall
[1:05:27] deliver you out of my hands notice
[1:05:30] nebuchadnezzar made a challenge
[1:05:33] whose god is able to deliver you
[1:05:37] and satan makes the same challenge to
[1:05:39] you in this hour
[1:05:41] who's god is it william branham's god
[1:05:45] is it the pastor's god
[1:05:47] is it your dad's god
[1:05:50] what god is going to deliver you from my
[1:05:52] clutches
[1:05:53] look at what i got
[1:05:55] i got them shooting up in the schools
[1:05:58] shooting up they're shooting up crack
[1:06:00] cocaine they're shooting up
[1:06:01] methamphetamines they're shooting up
[1:06:03] young people young teens doing all these
[1:06:05] things addicted to drugs addicted to
[1:06:07] alcohol addicted to pornography addicted
[1:06:09] to sex sins in
[1:06:11] grade school in high school in
[1:06:13] elementary school and all this and yet
[1:06:15] satan says
[1:06:17] you can't overcome this
[1:06:19] but we find here shadrach meshach and
[1:06:21] abednego answered and said to the king o
[1:06:24] nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to
[1:06:26] answer thee in this manner if it be so
[1:06:29] our god whom we serve is able to deliver
[1:06:31] us from the burning fiery furnace and he
[1:06:35] will deliver us out of thy hand okay
[1:06:39] here are these young men 13 14 15-ish in
[1:06:42] their age
[1:06:45] made a determination they were going to
[1:06:47] serve god
[1:06:49] they were held as prisoners
[1:06:52] they were in a foreign land
[1:06:55] away from mama away from their dad away
[1:06:57] from their church away from their norm
[1:07:00] their worship
[1:07:01] and yet they had purpose in their heart
[1:07:04] that they would not defile themselves
[1:07:06] with the things of babylon
[1:07:08] and they purposed in their heart that
[1:07:10] they would not serve any other gods but
[1:07:12] the god of jehovah
[1:07:15] notice the confession that these young
[1:07:17] men made
[1:07:19] because god had purposed in their heart
[1:07:24] and it says in verse 18 but if not be it
[1:07:27] known unto the o king that we will not
[1:07:30] serve thy gods nor worship the golden
[1:07:32] image with thou has set up
[1:07:35] i mean you want to talk about strike a
[1:07:37] man in the face
[1:07:39] nebuchadnezzar was i think he was a
[1:07:41] little bit stunned
[1:07:44] and the bible would go on to tell us
[1:07:45] then was nebuchadnezzar full of fury
[1:07:48] and the form of his visions was changed
[1:07:50] against shadrach meshach and abednego
[1:07:52] therefore he's spaking the commandment
[1:07:53] they that they should heat the furnace
[1:07:56] seven times more than it was ever want
[1:07:57] to be heated and he commanded the most
[1:07:59] notice he commanded the most mighty men
[1:08:02] that were in his army to bind shadrach
[1:08:04] meshach and abednego to cast him into
[1:08:06] the burning fiery furnace
[1:08:09] he called the best that he had to bind
[1:08:12] these men to
[1:08:13] these children and to throw them in the
[1:08:15] fire
[1:08:17] and these men were bound in their coats
[1:08:19] and they're hosing in their hats and
[1:08:20] they're go out their other garments and
[1:08:22] they were cast into the midst of the
[1:08:24] burning fiery furnace therefore because
[1:08:26] the the king's commandment was urgent
[1:08:29] and a furnace exceeding hot that the
[1:08:31] flames of the fire slew the men that
[1:08:33] took took up shadrach meshach and
[1:08:36] abednego
[1:08:38] slew the mighty man and these three men
[1:08:40] shadrach meshach and abednego fell down
[1:08:43] bound into the midst of the burning
[1:08:44] fiery furnace then nebuchadnezzar the
[1:08:46] king was astonished and he rose up in
[1:08:48] haste and he spake and he said unto the
[1:08:50] counselors did not we cast three men
[1:08:53] bound into the fire
[1:08:55] and they answered and said unto the king
[1:08:56] true o king
[1:08:59] and he answered and he said lo i see
[1:09:01] four men loose
[1:09:03] walking in the midst of the fire and
[1:09:06] they have no hurt
[1:09:09] they have no hurt
[1:09:11] but see because they purposed in their
[1:09:13] heart
[1:09:15] that they will not bow to the image
[1:09:18] and you must purpose in your heart
[1:09:20] you're not going to bow to the image
[1:09:22] that man is trying to erect today but
[1:09:25] you're going to serve god
[1:09:27] you're not going to serve the vices of
[1:09:29] the enemy you're not going to serve the
[1:09:31] enticements of the world but you're
[1:09:32] going to serve god you're going to
[1:09:34] dedicate your life
[1:09:35] at a young age
[1:09:37] to serve the lord
[1:09:39] and to fulfill the purpose which he has
[1:09:41] for you and the bible would tell us in
[1:09:42] verse 26 then nebuchadnezzar came near
[1:09:45] to the mouth of the fire of the furnace
[1:09:47] and he spake and he said shadrach
[1:09:49] meshach and abednego you servants of the
[1:09:51] most high god come forth and come hither
[1:09:54] then shadrach meshach and abednego came
[1:09:57] forth out of the midst of the fire
[1:10:00] and the bible would tell us that his eye
[1:10:02] is on the sparrow
[1:10:04] if his eye is on the sparrow
[1:10:07] certainly he watches over us
[1:10:10] his eye is on the sparrow
[1:10:13] one of the smallest birds and yet he's
[1:10:15] so mindful of his creation
[1:10:18] certainly he's mindful of his creation
[1:10:22] he's mindful of us see his eyes are on
[1:10:24] the sparrow and he left all of all of
[1:10:27] his glory to come down to babylon
[1:10:30] when these three young men purposed in
[1:10:32] their heart they wasn't thrown into the
[1:10:35] fire they stepped into the fire
[1:10:38] because they knew in their heart of
[1:10:40] hearts that god was able to deliver
[1:10:44] and even if he wasn't they were willing
[1:10:47] to take god at his word anyway
[1:10:49] and they refused to bow they refused to
[1:10:52] bend they refused to burn and god met
[1:10:55] them in their furnace
[1:10:58] but the bible say the hebrew children
[1:11:00] was a witness that god could deliver
[1:11:02] from fire when the furnace had been hot
[1:11:05] seven times they they said and had been
[1:11:08] thrown into the fire because they
[1:11:10] refused to give glory to the other god
[1:11:12] but the unseen god god wants us to to
[1:11:15] take him at his word and they refused to
[1:11:17] bow down to the image they went into the
[1:11:20] fiery furnace and god made their
[1:11:22] testimony to witness that he can deliver
[1:11:25] from fire
[1:11:26] so you say what was the purpose god was
[1:11:29] determined that he was going to have a
[1:11:31] young person so no matter what he put
[1:11:33] them through or allowed them to go
[1:11:35] through he was going to get the glory
[1:11:37] from the
[1:11:38] trial he says we the young children when
[1:11:41] god had a purpose for them when they
[1:11:43] were down in babylon the furnace was hit
[1:11:45] seven times hotter than it ever was
[1:11:47] heeded to destroy the purpose of god and
[1:11:50] all of babylon was on a rage and they
[1:11:52] were determined satan was to destroy the
[1:11:54] purpose of god for he knew those
[1:11:56] children was going into the furnace so
[1:11:59] he made the furnace when they heated it
[1:12:01] up seven times hotter to be sure that
[1:12:03] the program of god will be destroyed but
[1:12:06] god wanted to display his power
[1:12:10] and what has god done in this hour
[1:12:12] displayed his power
[1:12:14] god has displayed his power and all of
[1:12:16] babylon and all of hell could not defeat
[1:12:18] the purpose no sir no matter if they
[1:12:21] couldn't they could have heated the
[1:12:22] furnace up a million times hotter it
[1:12:25] would have never destroyed the purpose
[1:12:27] of god god wanted to show that he was
[1:12:29] god of deliverance and he'd bring
[1:12:31] deliverance to whomever he desired to
[1:12:33] bring it and nothing will interfere with
[1:12:35] this program
[1:12:37] and we find in this sage the seventh age
[1:12:39] the age that is heated up seven times
[1:12:42] hotter than any other age
[1:12:45] there has been in no other age that l g
[1:12:48] b
[1:12:49] t movement
[1:12:52] same-sex marriage
[1:12:54] let your kids determine their gender no
[1:12:57] god's already determined the gender
[1:13:00] but yet the furnace is being heated up
[1:13:02] now there's video games so realistic
[1:13:05] that it encourages young men to take
[1:13:08] assault rifles and go to school and
[1:13:10] shoot up their classmates because they
[1:13:12] begin to be dumbed down to it because
[1:13:15] they play it in virtual reality
[1:13:18] in their homes
[1:13:21] blood and gore and guts and all this
[1:13:23] they think nothing about taking another
[1:13:25] person's life
[1:13:27] see satan has heated the furnace
[1:13:29] seven times hotter
[1:13:31] music that entertains the spirit but
[1:13:33] prepares a soul for hell
[1:13:36] you know you you go to places and the
[1:13:39] stores and different things and maybe
[1:13:40] you catch some of the lyrics
[1:13:42] you don't just start tapping your foot
[1:13:44] and doing the boogie woogie to it but
[1:13:45] you hear some of the lyrics and
[1:13:47] especially some of the rap and you hear
[1:13:49] some of just the
[1:13:50] the the words and what they're talking
[1:13:53] about and it's like oh my word
[1:13:55] really
[1:13:57] we're talking about rape we're talking
[1:13:59] about murder we're talking about all
[1:14:00] this and they talk about it openly and
[1:14:02] this is what the young people of this
[1:14:04] age is is filling their minds on and
[1:14:06] they're feeding on it and feeding on it
[1:14:08] and yet they and we think or the parents
[1:14:11] think that this is okay it's not okay
[1:14:14] the furnace is being heated up
[1:14:18] and we got fashion today and we knew
[1:14:20] that the prophet prophesied that there'd
[1:14:22] be you know no clothes and now you walk
[1:14:24] in my i seen enough i've not seen enough
[1:14:27] clothes on some of the girls here in
[1:14:29] tucson since we've been here it's so hot
[1:14:32] everybody just wants to take their
[1:14:33] clothes off
[1:14:36] and we find but yet the struggle and
[1:14:38] what's it do it send more souls to hell
[1:14:41] and you find young girls and young boys
[1:14:43] now dealing with pornography and
[1:14:45] addictions and suicide and depression
[1:14:49] and anxiety more so they've ever seen in
[1:14:51] any other age
[1:14:53] it's here
[1:14:55] the furnace is head up seven times
[1:14:58] hotter
[1:14:59] but god has a purpose
[1:15:02] god has determined i'm gonna have a
[1:15:04] young person
[1:15:06] in tucson tabernacle so no matter how
[1:15:09] hot this thing gets they're going to
[1:15:11] serve me
[1:15:12] heat it up satan
[1:15:14] you can heat it up a million times
[1:15:16] hotter than what it is right now because
[1:15:18] my word is stronger than anything you
[1:15:20] can put out there
[1:15:22] see they want to talk about you can
[1:15:24] receive the holy ghost without sensation
[1:15:25] the days of miracles has passed now they
[1:15:27] got people discredited in the prophet's
[1:15:29] ministry and satan has done all this to
[1:15:32] destroy the purpose of god
[1:15:35] but shadrach meshach and abednego said
[1:15:36] we will not bow
[1:15:38] we will not bow our god is able to
[1:15:42] deliver
[1:15:43] we will not bow we will not bend we will
[1:15:46] not burn god is able and i'm here to
[1:15:49] tell you our god is able tonight see god
[1:15:53] used the hebrews children testimony to
[1:15:55] prove that he has the ultimate say in
[1:15:58] what happens in a believer's life
[1:16:02] is there any believers here willing to
[1:16:04] go to the furnace tonight
[1:16:06] just step on
[1:16:09] you may be you know satan had it so hot
[1:16:12] trying to get them to fear the flames
[1:16:16] but i want you to look at it from this
[1:16:17] side of it
[1:16:18] god started a fire so he can fellowship
[1:16:20] with his children
[1:16:24] god started a fire so he could have
[1:16:27] fellowship with his children
[1:16:29] because he had a purpose
[1:16:31] satan thought well i got em now i'm
[1:16:33] gonna destroy the purpose of god we're
[1:16:35] gonna heat this baby up it ain't never
[1:16:37] been this hot god said perfect i like
[1:16:39] heat
[1:16:41] stepped on down
[1:16:44] and the boys didn't even smell of smoke
[1:16:46] when they come out
[1:16:48] nice thing about it though the bands
[1:16:50] that were on their hands and on their
[1:16:52] feet that's the only thing that was
[1:16:54] touched
[1:16:55] because god doesn't intend for you to be
[1:16:57] bound
[1:16:58] he tends for you to be loose so you can
[1:17:00] walk in victory so you can live in
[1:17:02] victory so you can worship in victory
[1:17:06] let me tell you church your hands aren't
[1:17:07] bound you can lift those hands up and
[1:17:09] worship a living god
[1:17:11] you may be in the furnace but he
[1:17:12] designed a furnace to bring you into
[1:17:14] fellowship
[1:17:16] you say i need a quote for that brother
[1:17:18] joe perfect
[1:17:20] i'm so glad
[1:17:22] you want to quote for that
[1:17:24] here he says it
[1:17:27] he says this he says now
[1:17:30] let me find it
[1:17:32] because it's kind of on down here
[1:17:38] well
[1:17:41] maybe i passed it but he said sometimes
[1:17:43] god will harness
[1:17:45] troubles
[1:17:46] and trials and put a bit in its mouth
[1:17:49] and pull you into the presence of god
[1:17:52] so that he can have a closer fellowship
[1:17:54] with you
[1:17:57] see the trials that we go through are
[1:17:59] not all unfair
[1:18:00] and young person you're going to have
[1:18:02] your moment
[1:18:04] you're going to have your day when
[1:18:06] you're like what in the world is going
[1:18:08] on with me
[1:18:10] god is pulling you
[1:18:12] into his presence
[1:18:14] because he longs to have fellowship
[1:18:16] think about daniel daniel purpose in his
[1:18:18] heart that he wasn't going to defile
[1:18:19] himself with the king's meat
[1:18:21] and he had lentils
[1:18:23] and i learned just the other day because
[1:18:25] we were speaking to a young man who was
[1:18:27] a recent convert to the message and
[1:18:28] indian guy he's a jain from his origin
[1:18:31] and they eat lentils they don't eat meat
[1:18:32] but there's more protein than lentils
[1:18:34] than there is in meat and so that's how
[1:18:37] daniel and the hebrew boys could live
[1:18:39] because they were getting all the
[1:18:40] protein from lentils and yet we find
[1:18:43] that daniel purpose in his heart that he
[1:18:45] wasn't going to defile himself with the
[1:18:46] things of babylon he wasn't going to
[1:18:48] drink the alcohol he wasn't going to eat
[1:18:49] the food he wasn't going to do the
[1:18:51] things that they were doing and he was
[1:18:52] going to worship his god he was going to
[1:18:55] throw the curtains open and pray
[1:18:57] he wasn't afraid to give god honor
[1:19:00] to give god glory to give god praise
[1:19:03] but you know what i think god reserved
[1:19:05] to be a verbo for daniel
[1:19:09] he reserved the best place
[1:19:14] you think man where did he reserve down
[1:19:16] in babylon
[1:19:17] he reserved
[1:19:20] the l.d manor
[1:19:22] you say what does ld matter lion's den
[1:19:25] manner
[1:19:27] he's put it on special order
[1:19:30] and he reserved it before the foundation
[1:19:32] of the world because he wanted
[1:19:34] fellowship with his prophet
[1:19:38] you know there was nobody requesting
[1:19:40] that room
[1:19:42] but god requested it
[1:19:45] and daniel
[1:19:47] said o king i'll see you in the morning
[1:19:50] i'm not afraid of what's about to happen
[1:19:53] and the prophet of god said the angel of
[1:19:55] the lord met daniel in the lines then
[1:19:59] i can just imagine daniel just you know
[1:20:01] he wasn't fearful
[1:20:03] we're talking to the young people so i
[1:20:04] can get casual
[1:20:06] he wasn't worried
[1:20:08] he just had come on kitty kitty
[1:20:10] laid back oh
[1:20:12] yes
[1:20:13] oh this is nice
[1:20:18] oh yeah
[1:20:20] they're just
[1:20:21] meowing and meowing
[1:20:26] we want to think the worst of the event
[1:20:28] god's in control
[1:20:32] they may be ferocious
[1:20:34] but there was a presence of the
[1:20:36] supernatural there
[1:20:39] daniel wasn't worried
[1:20:41] making them cats can march back and
[1:20:42] forth
[1:20:44] they hadn't fed them in weeks they were
[1:20:45] starving ready to devour
[1:20:48] but god reserved that place
[1:20:51] because god had a purpose that he was
[1:20:53] going to prove that he was greater than
[1:20:55] a king
[1:20:59] that he's greater than anything that
[1:21:01] this world can throw at you or god is
[1:21:03] greater
[1:21:05] so no matter what you're facing
[1:21:08] god's reserved your room
[1:21:10] and god has placed you in a furnace for
[1:21:12] a purpose
[1:21:13] and there's no devil in hell can defeat
[1:21:15] the purpose of god
[1:21:17] and your purpose is to serve god
[1:21:20] your purpose the bible will tell us is
[1:21:23] to be a son and daughter of god
[1:21:26] beloved what manner of love hath the
[1:21:28] father has bestowed upon us that we
[1:21:31] should be called sons of god
[1:21:33] think about that as we're bringing this
[1:21:35] down to a close
[1:21:37] the prophet of god will say all the
[1:21:39] powers of hell may wage against it but
[1:21:42] it will not prevail
[1:21:44] we have god's eternal promise there may
[1:21:47] be teachers rise there may be isms rise
[1:21:49] there may be great programs rise there
[1:21:51] may be things that we look like to try
[1:21:54] to be destroyed but it can never be
[1:21:56] destroyed it is the purpose of god to
[1:21:59] see that it will prevail then it's not
[1:22:01] up to you it's not up to me it's not up
[1:22:04] to whether you will be destroyed or not
[1:22:06] it's up to god and we can rest assure on
[1:22:09] it that god will never let our heritage
[1:22:12] be destroyed
[1:22:14] for it is his purpose to give it to us
[1:22:18] you say well brother joe all the guns
[1:22:20] are hell or they're they're pouring on
[1:22:22] me and all the kids at school are making
[1:22:23] fun of me and they're they're accusing
[1:22:25] me of this isaiah 54 verse 17 says no
[1:22:28] weapon that is formed against you shall
[1:22:30] prosper
[1:22:31] no weapon
[1:22:32] whatever
[1:22:34] form it comes in no weapon
[1:22:37] that is formed against you shall prosper
[1:22:38] in every tongue that rise up against
[1:22:40] thee thou shall condemn
[1:22:43] and the bible will tell us in romans 8
[1:22:45] and verse 31 if god be for us then who
[1:22:48] can be
[1:22:49] against us
[1:22:51] see god has called you
[1:22:54] you have a purpose
[1:22:55] in romans 8 and verse 28 we know that
[1:22:57] all things work together for the good to
[1:22:59] them that love god to them who are the
[1:23:02] called according to his purpose
[1:23:05] for whom he did for no he also did
[1:23:07] predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:23:09] image of his son notice those he called
[1:23:13] he did predestinate
[1:23:15] to be conformed to the image of his son
[1:23:18] that he might be the first
[1:23:20] born of many brethren moreover whom he
[1:23:22] did predestinate to them he also called
[1:23:25] that word called there means you
[1:23:27] received a name
[1:23:30] you're bearing a title
[1:23:32] and it's not a family title but it's a
[1:23:35] family title
[1:23:38] those whom he did predestinate
[1:23:40] he allowed you to bear the title of son
[1:23:43] he allowed you to bear the title of
[1:23:45] daughter in whom he called he already
[1:23:47] justified and whom he justified he
[1:23:50] already had glorified
[1:23:53] see god is working everything
[1:23:56] for his purpose which you were formed in
[1:24:00] the image of god to fulfill
[1:24:03] that purpose so you may wonder how many
[1:24:05] young girls do we have here tonight

[1:24:39] you got your bridesmaids planned out you
[1:24:41] got his groomsmen planned out you got it
[1:24:44] all planned out i got three daughters i
[1:24:47] know how this works
[1:24:49] and we think well i've got this this is
[1:24:52] i'm gonna do this but god has the final
[1:24:55] say
[1:24:56] god has a purpose
[1:24:58] and your purpose in life is not who
[1:24:59] you're going to marry
[1:25:02] it's not where you're going to go to
[1:25:03] church
[1:25:05] it's not who you're going to be
[1:25:06] affiliated with but your purpose in life
[1:25:08] is to serve god
[1:25:10] so the question that we've all have
[1:25:12] wrestled with
[1:25:13] what is my purpose
[1:25:15] what is god's purpose for my life
[1:25:18] that is to let the word of the hour be
[1:25:21] manifested through you
[1:25:24] god's desire is to have a bride to have
[1:25:27] a body that she would be born of his
[1:25:29] bone flesh of his flesh life of his life
[1:25:31] the prophet of god says she is him
[1:25:35] so that's your purpose
[1:25:37] i'm glad you have your marriage planned
[1:25:41] but god has a greater purpose for your
[1:25:42] life
[1:25:45] and i understand you young boys some of
[1:25:46] you probably want to be very athletic
[1:25:48] and be a superstar i thought man i when
[1:25:50] i was in sixth grade this is what i was
[1:25:53] i'm like man i'm gonna be a giant
[1:25:55] i'm sixth grade i'm five foot six i play
[1:25:57] football i loved it but everybody just
[1:26:00] grew up and i was just stay right where
[1:26:01] i was at
[1:26:03] see i had purpose i was gonna be
[1:26:04] something great
[1:26:07] in worldly standards
[1:26:08] but god has something greater according
[1:26:10] to his standards
[1:26:12] so our purpose is not to be who's who
[1:26:15] our purpose is not what kind of fancy
[1:26:17] car we're going to drive or what nice
[1:26:19] house we're going to live in and how
[1:26:20] much money we're going to make but our
[1:26:22] purpose is simple
[1:26:24] be a child of god
[1:26:26] be a child of god how do you become a
[1:26:28] child of god by one spirit are we born
[1:26:31] into the family of god
[1:26:33] to allow the holy spirit to come in your
[1:26:36] life and to be born again
[1:26:38] that's your purpose
[1:26:41] it's not difficult
[1:26:43] we don't have to bring a bunch of
[1:26:45] scriptures into it we don't have to
[1:26:46] complicate it with a bunch of quotes
[1:26:48] it's that simple god has one purpose for
[1:26:51] your life and that's to be a child of
[1:26:53] god
[1:26:54] it doesn't have to get any more
[1:26:55] complicated than that right there
[1:26:58] now if he has other things for you to do
[1:27:00] he will lead you to those things as we
[1:27:01] discussed this morning but your purpose
[1:27:04] on earth is to declare him
[1:27:07] is to declare him
[1:27:10] that he's alive
[1:27:11] that he's not a god of history but he's
[1:27:13] a god of now
[1:27:16] that the same god that walked the shores
[1:27:18] of galilee the prophet of god would say
[1:27:20] he's the same in every detail except the
[1:27:23] corporal body is living and manifesting
[1:27:26] in laodicea through my life
[1:27:30] that's your purpose
[1:27:32] want to musicians come
[1:27:37] see it's that simple
[1:27:39] yet
[1:27:39] it can be that difficult
[1:27:42] because we wrestle with it
[1:27:43] because satan has access to the mind and
[1:27:46] he begins to complicate it
[1:27:48] and complicate it and complicate it
[1:27:51] because
[1:27:53] you're driving one way
[1:27:55] but he knows the way you're going to go
[1:27:58] so sometimes satan because you're
[1:27:59] driving one way
[1:28:02] he will allow a little bit of pain and
[1:28:03] struggle
[1:28:05] to bring you back to the way he wants
[1:28:06] you to go
[1:28:08] and i believe the lord did that in my
[1:28:09] own personal experience and my own
[1:28:10] personal life was a young age
[1:28:12] god allowed the circumstances of my life
[1:28:15] to childhood
[1:28:16] because i was running from the childhood
[1:28:19] trying to be something or somebody
[1:28:22] worldly speaking
[1:28:25] and yet god knew he had an end for me he
[1:28:28] knew i would be standing before you
[1:28:29] today declaring this word
[1:28:32] so he had to put something in the way a
[1:28:34] roadblock and say you're going the wrong
[1:28:36] way
[1:28:38] i don't intend for you to go down this
[1:28:40] road
[1:28:41] you need to stop
[1:28:42] you need to turn around you need to go
[1:28:44] home
[1:28:46] and i can say god spoke to me through a
[1:28:48] literal voice to turn your car around
[1:28:50] and go home
[1:28:53] young person if that be you tonight
[1:28:56] turn your car around
[1:28:59] turn around
[1:29:00] don't keep going the same way you've
[1:29:01] been going
[1:29:02] god has a purpose for your life
[1:29:05] don't you just balance bower heads just
[1:29:06] for a brief minute if you would just
[1:29:08] play something
[1:29:15] there'd be a young person here we
[1:29:17] dedicated this service to you tonight
[1:29:21] and i just
[1:29:22] don't want to miss the opportunity to
[1:29:24] give you a chance
[1:29:27] if you've been going the wrong way i
[1:29:28] want you to know right now
[1:29:31] you could just slip your hand up say god
[1:29:33] remember me tonight
[1:29:35] remember me tonight
[1:29:37] i'm lifting my hand before you i want to
[1:29:39] serve you lord i don't want to defile
[1:29:41] myself tonight with the things of this
[1:29:43] world
[1:29:44] i feel the poor i i feel the struggle i
[1:29:47] hear what brother joe's talked about and
[1:29:49] yet maybe i've struggled with my own
[1:29:50] purpose and calling in life but god i
[1:29:52] see it it's so plain and so simple
[1:29:54] tonight
[1:29:55] my purpose is to be a child of god
[1:29:58] this will declare christ that he's alive
[1:30:00] in this hour
[1:30:03] father i just ask tonight lord
[1:30:06] that has we taken the time just to be
[1:30:08] able to minister something personally to
[1:30:10] the young people and
[1:30:13] we just ask father you just allow this
[1:30:15] word just to begin to settle down right
[1:30:17] now
[1:30:20] or just begin to resonate in their soul
[1:30:22] realm
[1:30:23] go beyond the mind father go down into
[1:30:26] the regions of the soul
[1:30:28] where the word of god can take on
[1:30:30] reality
[1:30:32] and that word in that word is life
[1:30:36] and that life comes down through the
[1:30:38] channel of the mind into the depths of
[1:30:39] the soul father
[1:30:41] and that life begins to be lived out
[1:30:44] lord you didn't intend for no one here
[1:30:46] tonight to be a drunk to be a drugged to
[1:30:50] be a prostitute to be lost to be wayward
[1:30:53] but you intended each of us here
[1:30:56] to be sons and daughters of god
[1:30:59] and lord we purpose tonight and we
[1:31:02] renew our vows to you father
[1:31:05] that we will serve you

[1:38:14] [Music]
[1:38:23] before even time

[1:40:09] quite a bit of time
[1:40:11] on the sewing machine because she liked

[1:41:00] life
[1:41:01] to me
[1:41:11] broken peace
[1:41:19] [Music]
[1:41:26] your

[1:41:35] you
[1:41:40] to
[1:41:41] me let's make that promise one more time
[1:41:43] a pledge
[1:41:45] i will serve thee
[1:41:49] because i
[1:41:51] love thee
[1:41:55] you have
[1:41:58] given life
[1:42:00] to
[1:42:01] me
[1:42:02] [Music]
[1:42:05] i was nothing
[1:42:09] before you
[1:42:11] found me
[1:42:18] [Music]
[1:42:24] they were hearted
[1:42:27] [Music]
[1:42:29] broken pieces
[1:42:34] ruined
[1:42:36] lies are what
[1:42:38] you
[1:42:40] died on
[1:42:42] calvary
[1:42:44] your
[1:42:45] tongue
[1:42:47] was what i long for
[1:42:52] you
[1:42:55] [Music]
[1:43:02] i remember sometimes mom and dad talking
[1:43:05] to us
[1:43:07] me my brother's my sister and we would
[1:43:09] say but dad that that was from a long
[1:43:11] time ago
[1:43:14] but satan is the same satan from all
[1:43:16] along
[1:43:17] whatever he could do and whatever
[1:43:20] but greater is he
[1:43:22] that is in you than he that is in the
[1:43:25] world
[1:43:26] if he could keep them in that time he'll
[1:43:28] still keep them in this time
[1:43:30] though satan climb like a he's a come
[1:43:32] like a flood i will lift up a standard
[1:43:35] and god keeps his word let's just bow
[1:43:38] our heads one more time lord
[1:43:43] some of us looking back say well it was
[1:43:45] a long time ago when i was young and i
[1:43:47] was going when i was
[1:43:49] maybe looking for a husband or a wife
[1:43:52] but we look back now and it just it was
[1:43:54] just the other day time has gone so
[1:43:56] quickly
[1:43:57] but you've been faithful lord
[1:44:00] you've never failed
[1:44:02] maybe it wasn't the way we thought it
[1:44:04] should go and how we thought we would
[1:44:06] plan it out but your way is perfect lord
[1:44:10] lord let us come to that if i could use
[1:44:12] the word revelation understanding
