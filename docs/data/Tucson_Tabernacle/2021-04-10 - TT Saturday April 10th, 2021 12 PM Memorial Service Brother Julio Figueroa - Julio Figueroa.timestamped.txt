[14:15] have
[14:16] been visited by a special life and
[14:21] special works of grace and love lord
[14:23] that our brother was constantly doing
[14:27] and we know lord he's reached the end of
[14:29] his journey a mortal journey but
[14:31] he's made a journey to a new place
[14:34] what we all long for is to get out of
[14:38] this
[14:39] that brother bannon said this pest house
[14:41] and into that

[15:51] jesus name
[15:52] and everybody said amen
[15:57] so julio rodriguez figueroa
[16:01] was born march 4th 1948 in tucson here
[16:06] he spent two years in the united states
[16:08] army
[16:09] and from 1968 to 1970
[16:13] he was married with uh
[16:18] sister silvia gahiola on march 20th 1971
[16:24] he survived today by silvia
[16:28] la figueroa his wife
[16:31] gabriel grace lillian and stephen
[16:35] his children grandchildren ethan
[16:39] logan nathan family named taylor
[16:43] stitt elena ryan
[16:47] bustamonte and caleb figueroa
[16:52] he worked at tucson electric power
[16:55] keeping the lights on for everybody
[16:59] and making sure the bills got near
[17:05] for 30 years and he retired in december
[17:09] of 1973
[17:13] excuse me from 1973 to december of 2003
[17:22] then began a battle for three years
[17:26] against a demon that finally
[17:31] we could say didn't take him but was
[17:32] used by god to take him across into a
[17:35] better place
[17:38] and he passed away march 19th
[17:42] 2021. i don't have a scripture i want to
[17:46] read and just
[17:47] uh
[17:50] one of my
[17:53] thoughts about brother julio that
[17:57] made him special was he was so much like
[17:59] jesus in so many ways
[18:02] so much like the perfect husband the
[18:05] perfect
[18:06] father although you young people may not
[18:08] think that you children and
[18:09] grandchildren
[18:11] because there's that human part that
[18:14] fails to
[18:14] really allow that
[18:18] divinity to really show all the time but
[18:21] by god's grace
[18:23] christ shown through him anyway amen
[18:26] but in the in the scripture here in john
[18:30] chapter 13 it said now before the feast
[18:32] of the passover
[18:36] jesus knew that his hour was come
[18:39] and that he should depart out of this
[18:42] world unto the father
[18:45] having loved his own
[18:49] which were in the world he loved them
[18:52] unto the end i think that's the greatest
[18:55] testimony that we could say or the words
[18:57] of
[18:58] a commendation towards brother julio
[18:59] that he was steadfast in his love
[19:02] right to the very last breath we thank
[19:05] god for that
[19:06] so much like jesus himself
[19:11] but the great mystery included in this
[19:12] scripture is that
[19:14] with our lord jesus christ there was an
[19:17] end
[19:19] of his mortal walk but that wasn't the
[19:22] end of him
[19:24] his life goes on and he's the same
[19:26] yesterday today and forever
[19:28] and the same can be said about brother
[19:30] julio there was an end to the moral
[19:32] suffering
[19:33] and the mortal weakness and the frailty
[19:36] but that was only the beginning of the
[19:39] real expression of that
[19:40] man that life that was there
[19:44] we thank god for that so we're looking
[19:47] for him to appear to us
[19:49] i'm going to be looking for we got so
[19:50] many now to be looking forward to come
[19:52] visit us on resurrection morning
[19:54] that uh we don't know which one it will
[19:56] be or maybe a whole group
[19:58] but in our case here because of our love
[20:00] for brother julio we believe
[20:02] god would permit him to just come by our
[20:04] place
[20:05] and let us know that the resurrection is
[20:08] on
[20:09] unless we would happen to pass over into
[20:12] that other dimension
[20:14] before that but either way
[20:17] christians can't lose because of jesus
[20:20] christ
[20:21] he conquered death overcome
[20:24] death hell in the grave broke the seals
[20:29] into eternal life and set us free
[20:33] from sin and death and if anybody here
[20:36] doesn't know the lord jesus christ today
[20:38] i would beg of you
[20:40] consider that you need
[20:44] a savior and a comforter i'll guarantee
[20:47] you
[20:48] though the man who we're celebrating
[20:50] here today he knew that savior
[20:53] and he i'm a better man because i knew
[20:56] brother julio
[20:57] and his all of his family i'm so blessed
[21:01] that
[21:03] one day falling in love with sister
[21:04] mirna i didn't know what i was going to
[21:06] get
[21:08] a lot of wonderful family an extended
[21:11] family
[21:12] that just made me a better man and so
[21:14] god richly bless you and we know that
[21:16] some of you are deeply suffering and may
[21:18] be confused and
[21:20] maybe not understanding but just
[21:23] we're going to pray that the holy spirit
[21:24] will just comfort every heart today
[21:27] give us strength to go on lift our cross
[21:29] keep carrying our cross keep pressing on
[21:31] the battle
[21:32] god richly bless you
[21:41] it is a comfort for a christian to know
[21:44] that
[21:45] we step from this life to the next life
[21:48] and sometimes we wish we were there
[21:50] already so
[21:52] but we have a life to live here and a
[21:53] time to go on and my sister irma
[21:56] shola makes your way up to sing song
[21:59] here
[22:01] brother julio was a meter reader along
[22:03] with quite a few
[22:06] brothers and got to talking about some
[22:08] of the different ones but
[22:11] my brother fred who worked with him for
[22:13] many years
[22:14] said to give you his condolences and he
[22:16] had such
[22:18] good memories of brother julia a
[22:20] wonderful time so
[22:21] god bless you as as our
[22:25] such i don't know if there's plane or

[28:54] receive that
[28:59] god bless you may be seated
[29:03] i uh
[29:06] didn't relish the thought of having to
[29:08] do this i mean for my brother
[29:10] and sometimes because i get a little
[29:12] emotional so if i get emotional
[29:14] just bear with me he's my only brother
[29:19] there's only three of us my sister irma
[29:22] we use standard so they can know who you
[29:24] are in case
[29:25] you don't know who you are that's my
[29:27] sister my older
[29:28] sister as brother green would say
[29:32] and uh there was my brother and myself
[29:34] and i'm the baby of the family
[29:37] and i want to just relate a few things
[29:41] about his life and
[29:42] go into a few couple of scriptures and
[29:44] try to be as brief as i can
[29:46] but so many things you want to say so
[29:48] many things you wanted
[29:49] you know you just and you only have so
[29:52] much time
[29:53] but i we were raised in the apostolic
[29:56] church
[29:58] which is a won this uh pentecostal
[30:01] spanish denomination and uh
[30:05] i was until the age of 12 that's when we
[30:07] came into the message
[30:09] and we had the privilege of being here
[30:11] at the old tucson tabernacle back in
[30:13] 1965 in november
[30:15] when brother greene first came and
[30:18] started the first services we were there
[30:21] and
[30:22] but one thing that was on my mind is to
[30:25] say this this morning this morning that
[30:26] afternoon is that
[30:28] my sister had told me that she
[30:30] remembered how that
[30:31] sometimes my brother was was persecuted
[30:34] for
[30:35] for being uh what they called in the old
[30:37] spanish barrio they called us alleluias
[30:39] or holy rulers and and he was
[30:43] and sometimes he would come home with
[30:44] his clothes torn and
[30:46] beat up she said one time they were
[30:49] attending
[30:50] a little lutheran church for school and
[30:51] they came out and
[30:53] and when they were going walking home a
[30:55] group of boys were there to meet him and
[30:56] she
[30:57] and she says he told her run on home and
[31:00] he stayed to meet them
[31:02] and so he he suffered a little bit for
[31:04] that for being a believer
[31:07] and i recall one time myself i was
[31:09] coming home with just a little kid and
[31:11] uh this young boy began to yell at me
[31:14] call me
[31:14] hallelujah and throw rocks at me and
[31:17] remember he hit me in the back of the
[31:19] head
[31:20] and when i put my hand back there there
[31:21] was blood on my hand i ran home crying
[31:24] but that's sometimes it was rough you
[31:26] know growing up in the water one
[31:28] and not being like everybody else but
[31:31] i believe that's part of that uh
[31:36] training that god brings us through and
[31:40] he was he was quite a guy
[31:43] he was a leader of the pack the whole
[31:46] neighborhood
[31:47] had about 10 12 guys that he organized
[31:49] the football games and the baseball
[31:51] games and
[31:52] he had a friend that from all the way
[31:54] from from grade school
[31:56] until they graduated in from high school
[32:00] and they actually worked together in a
[32:01] restaurant for about three or four years
[32:03] the old karachamaka restaurant
[32:05] over on on
[32:08] ajo in mission road
[32:11] mission road and and i and i thought to
[32:15] call him because they had parted ways by
[32:16] the time they they graduated
[32:18] my brother was immediately drafted into
[32:20] the army was during the vietnam war
[32:23] and and he went off to to college which
[32:25] gave him a deferment
[32:27] and they pretty much separated right
[32:29] there and i thought because they were
[32:30] really good friends i thought i'd give
[32:32] him a call but
[32:33] this is his name is raul grijalva he is
[32:36] now a u.s congressman
[32:39] and he's been there for about over 12
[32:42] over 20 years i think now
[32:44] and so i called his office and it was on
[32:46] a wednesday night when we received a
[32:48] call from
[32:49] sister sylvia that he was he was no
[32:52] longer speaking
[32:54] if we wanted to see him alive go
[32:55] tomorrow she invited us to come to the
[32:57] house
[32:58] so that night wednesday night i called
[33:00] his office
[33:01] and i left the message and it was
[33:03] recording said they will get back to you
[33:04] within
[33:05] 48 hours i was surprised the next
[33:08] morning at 8 o'clock in the morning the
[33:09] phone rang my phone rang and it was
[33:11] it was a a staff member from his office
[33:15] he wanted more information when i told
[33:18] him how they had been worked together
[33:19] for three or four years in high school
[33:21] going through high school from grade
[33:22] school all the way to they graduated
[33:24] we're going to get this message to mr
[33:26] grijalva
[33:26] he said can we call you back at this
[33:28] number and said yes well that same day
[33:30] around noon when i get a call and it was
[33:31] wrong
[33:33] and we grew up together we just three
[33:35] four houses from where i lived i know
[33:36] his mom his
[33:37] sisters you know we just knew each other
[33:39] he just grew up together
[33:41] and i told him he was very thankful for
[33:43] for giving him the call letting him know
[33:45] and i said i know you guys were pretty
[33:47] close he said we were tight
[33:49] we were tight he was the one that bossed
[33:52] us around
[33:53] he tell us what to do and who's going to
[33:55] play what what what
[33:56] what part of the team and where we're
[33:58] going and we're going to play the
[33:59] ballpark over here
[34:01] over there and uh so he was the one that
[34:04] bossed everybody matter of fact when
[34:05] they
[34:05] all graduated he was he loved
[34:08] motorcycles and
[34:09] and he had organized all his friends
[34:11] rent motorcycles
[34:13] and they were going to go into mexico
[34:15] and i think a lot of parents didn't like
[34:18] that idea including hours and they were
[34:19] able to talk him out of it
[34:21] otherwise they would have gone but
[34:26] just things of those things that we
[34:28] remember back back in the day
[34:30] as we're growing up i also remember that
[34:33] when he was in the army uh
[34:36] he had been transferred over from to to
[34:38] fort knox
[34:39] as a tank mechanic and he was given a
[34:42] furlough
[34:43] to come home for a few days and then he
[34:46] was going to report back to fort knox
[34:48] and they were going to ship them off to
[34:50] vietnam and during that time my mother
[34:52] was really sick and he he came and
[34:54] he never told us didn't tell us what was
[34:57] going on
[34:58] but we were praying and he was praying
[35:00] and when he went back to fort knox he
[35:01] had changed his orders and they changed
[35:03] they sent him to germany instead and he
[35:06] finished off his
[35:07] his time there in germany and never went
[35:10] to vietnam but i'm thankful for that
[35:12] and god took care of him but he was
[35:16] he was a good brother we and i he and i
[35:19] we had a great respect for each other
[35:21] and i loved my brother he loved me
[35:24] and we never had problems we did with
[35:27] kids growing up but
[35:29] once we became adults we were we
[35:31] respected each other we had loved one
[35:33] for each one for another
[35:35] and he was
[35:38] one part of the testimony i want to give
[35:40] this this afternoon is
[35:42] back in 1957 my parents
[35:45] uh had a few met medical problems
[35:49] and they heard that brother branham was
[35:51] going to be in phoenix
[35:53] and so they went and it was at the old
[35:56] madison square
[35:58] garden building there in phoenix arizona
[36:00] where brother branham
[36:02] preached many times brother billy paul
[36:04] once told me that
[36:06] his daddy told him that there was a
[36:08] heart at one of the hardest places for
[36:09] him to preach
[36:11] because he they would took about three
[36:12] services to
[36:14] to expel all the spirits that were in
[36:16] the building
[36:18] you see they could see them hanging on
[36:19] from the balconies
[36:21] and uh and so they went that that night
[36:24] it was
[36:25] back in march 3rd 1957 and brother brown
[36:28] preached the message
[36:29] what think he of christ and then that
[36:32] mess and then that
[36:34] they were given a a card with a letter
[36:36] and a number
[36:37] and so they had sat down and my brother
[36:39] was about nine years old
[36:41] and he was laying at the on the floor
[36:43] sleeping and when he was asleep you
[36:44] couldn't wake him up
[36:46] he had a problem with his sleeping he
[36:48] was getting up and every night
[36:50] and sleepwalking with his eyes open and
[36:53] they had to watch him all the time
[36:55] and and so they had that on their heart
[36:57] they wanted him to be prayed for and my
[36:58] mother
[36:59] had a lump on her breast that was very
[37:01] painful and that she wanted to be prayed
[37:03] for
[37:03] and and also my dad worked at the mines
[37:06] and salmon well and he had to use those
[37:09] rubber boots because of the water in the
[37:10] tunnels and
[37:11] caused a skin reaction in his legs and
[37:13] he was bleeding and he had scabs and
[37:15] where he was scratched and so it was
[37:18] pretty bad and so they went with those
[37:19] three things and
[37:21] and they got called and when they're
[37:24] calling their number
[37:25] you know they're in the my brother's
[37:26] laying there on the floor between
[37:28] between the seats and and they're trying
[37:30] to wake him up and they couldn't wake
[37:31] him up they're calling their number
[37:32] finally my dad
[37:33] stands up and he says leave him here god
[37:35] knows our need
[37:37] so they went and got in line and and
[37:39] you're going to hear that
[37:40] what what just said there if you have
[37:42] brothers have that ready
[37:44] okay go ahead and put it on
[38:31] one that should be righteous perverted
[38:33] to do wrong
[38:40] now a lady that's my mother the lady
[38:45] she
[38:48] no i thought she was deaf
[38:51] but she can't speak english you come to
[38:54] interpret for her
[38:58] right
[39:01] speak to her as i speak
[39:04] do you believe on the lord jesus christ
[39:10] do you believe me to be his prophet
[39:14] if god will tell me what you are here
[39:17] for
[39:18] will you receive it
[39:25] now you know that i don't know you
[39:32] i can't even speak your language
[39:35] [Music]
[39:36] but the god of heaven
[39:40] speaks all language
[39:47] you are here wanting me to pray for you
[39:53] for a growth if that is right raise up
[39:57] your hands
[40:01] that growth is
[40:04] on your left breast
[40:09] if that's right wave your hand
[40:18] and this is your husband
[40:23] and you want prayer for him
[40:26] because he's got a skin disease
[40:31] that is right
[40:34] then you won't pray for a son that's my
[40:37] brother
[40:39] and the reason you all pray for him
[40:43] is because he walks in his sleep
[40:46] with his eyes open
[40:52] [Music]
[41:02] does thou believe on the son of god
[41:06] amen
[41:12] now surely that would settle mental
[41:14] telepathy for you
[41:18] when when my dad and mom
[41:21] passed in front of brother brown to go
[41:22] down the other side
[41:24] my dad told me that brother brown pat
[41:27] him on the back
[41:28] he says just believe everything is going
[41:30] to be all right
[41:31] they came home my mother was
[41:33] miraculously healed
[41:35] you know it's different between the
[41:36] difference between a miracle
[41:38] and divine healing divine healing can
[41:41] take time
[41:41] but a miracle is like right now we serve
[41:44] a god of miracles
[41:46] he's the same yesterday today and
[41:48] forever
[41:49] and and as he passed he says
[41:51] everything's gonna be all right
[41:53] and my dad was was healed also
[41:56] they came back giving testimony in
[41:58] tucson to the brothers and sisters and
[42:00] what did god have done you imagine if it
[42:01] being you
[42:03] had been in that prayer line and those
[42:05] things are taking place
[42:07] and um and but you know my brother was
[42:10] not prayed for
[42:12] satan was exposed but he was not prayed
[42:14] over and that that thing needed to be
[42:16] rebuked
[42:18] but god was in charge the next about the
[42:20] next night i believe it was
[42:22] in the wee hours of the morning it was
[42:24] still dark outside my dad says
[42:26] he suddenly woke up and he was totally
[42:29] completely awake
[42:30] and he lays there and and he's thinking
[42:33] maybe i
[42:33] heard a noise he was a very light
[42:35] sleeper and
[42:37] so he waited for a moment or two to see
[42:38] if there's any more noise so
[42:40] he thought he'd get up and go check look
[42:42] around so he put his feet on the floor
[42:44] he's getting up
[42:45] off the off the bed and my brother used
[42:47] to sleep in a cot
[42:48] at the doorway to the kitchen with a
[42:50] bedroom and the kitchen were
[42:52] connected through a doorway and he there
[42:54] was an old folding cot he would lay out
[42:56] there
[42:56] and they had to be watching him right
[42:57] there by that doorway and as my dad is
[43:00] getting up in that that morning
[43:02] my brother he looks up and my brother's
[43:04] getting up in his sleep again
[43:06] and my dad gives a testimony he told me
[43:08] personally he said
[43:09] i i didn't even think what i was gonna
[43:10] say i just i pointed like this
[43:13] and i said satan i rebuke you in the
[43:15] name of the lord jesus christ
[43:17] my brother stopped in mid-air and he
[43:19] fell back on that bed
[43:21] and never got up again that spirit was
[43:23] cast out of him
[43:25] and so that was a testimony of
[43:28] what taking place you know the bible
[43:30] says in hebrews chapter 12
[43:32] paul writes he says we're foreseen we
[43:34] are compassed about with so great a
[43:36] cloud of witnesses
[43:38] in that time there have been 500 stood
[43:40] there and watched jesus ascend into
[43:42] heaven
[43:43] all these witnesses all the ones that
[43:44] seen the miracles and and they were
[43:46] believing and
[43:47] you know they were dying off and they
[43:50] were in that
[43:50] same thing today many of these that
[43:52] walked with the prophet of our day
[43:55] they're gone the testimonies we have
[43:57] that may be on record but they're gone
[43:59] there's getting to be there's more on
[44:01] that side than there is on this side
[44:03] and and i believe that that you know
[44:06] that's that's where we're at right now
[44:07] and i believe that we've lost another
[44:08] witness
[44:10] amen but you know the record stays amen
[44:13] what was done amen will shatter from the
[44:15] mountaintops
[44:17] god is a healer god is a deliverer amen
[44:20] he's the same yesterday today and
[44:22] forever amen
[44:24] i'd like to just say a few scriptures
[44:26] this afternoon
[44:27] i believe that it's it's fitting because
[44:30] it is a word of god that gives us
[44:32] strength it is a word of god that
[44:34] that gives us that that that which we
[44:37] which we need
[44:37] to comfort our hearts when we need it
[44:40] and and i need this
[44:42] uh it it's hard sometimes for me to
[44:45] think about it but
[44:47] to that i lost my brother and those of
[44:49] you that lost somebody close to you like
[44:51] that you know what i'm talking about
[44:53] you know in psalms 116 and verse 15
[44:58] but david writes precious in the sight
[45:00] of the lord
[45:01] is the death of his saints amen
[45:05] something precious when when a child of
[45:07] god goes home
[45:09] as we sung about this morning the battle
[45:12] is over
[45:12] hallelujah it's done he's graduated
[45:16] into that eternal place no more
[45:21] suffering no more problems amen
[45:25] in proverbs 14 and 32 it says a wicked
[45:27] is driven away
[45:29] in his wickedness but the righteous
[45:32] hallelujah
[45:33] the righteous hath hope in his death
[45:37] brother brown says that's an escape
[45:39] that's a door called death it is an
[45:41] escape for the believer to leave this
[45:44] old pest house behind
[45:45] and go into the realms of god amen
[45:48] it it's the hope of every believer amen
[45:52] you know job went through a lot then and
[45:55] i can i can
[45:56] relate to job having lost the loved one
[45:58] but job lost all his children
[46:00] in one day can you imagine how he was a
[46:03] man
[46:04] just like you and i he felt the pain the
[46:06] separation
[46:08] he would never see them again in this
[46:09] lifetime
[46:11] and he was hurting inside and and then
[46:13] he was sick and his own wife had told
[46:15] him to
[46:16] curse god and die and and there he is in
[46:19] that condition and
[46:20] and he begins to question and ask
[46:22] questions to himself and i believe when
[46:24] death comes
[46:25] and it hits near us we it causes us to
[46:27] reflect
[46:29] we realize how mortal we are we realize
[46:32] that there's no guarantee for tomorrow
[46:34] i don't care if you're 10 years old or
[46:36] or 80 years or 90
[46:38] there's no guarantee for tomorrow and
[46:41] there in joel
[46:42] 14 1 he says man that is born of a woman
[46:46] is a few days and full of trouble
[46:50] he cometh forth like a flower and is cut
[46:54] down
[46:55] he fleeth also as a shadow and
[46:57] continueth not
[47:00] in joel 14-5 he says seeing his days are
[47:03] determined
[47:05] they're numbered there's there's a
[47:08] cross in this lifetime he sees seeing
[47:11] his days are determined
[47:13] the number of his months are with thee
[47:16] thou has appointed his bounds
[47:19] and he cannot pass
[47:23] he has numbered our days in 14 and 10 he
[47:27] says but a man
[47:28] but man dieth and wasteth
[47:32] away yay man giveth up the ghost
[47:36] the spirit of life and where is he
[47:39] it's a good question to ask it's a good
[47:43] question for us to ask
[47:45] where is he is there life after death
[47:48] we're told by the intellectual man of
[47:51] today and
[47:52] the scientists and the manner of
[47:54] education that there is no god
[47:57] that there is no life after death that
[47:59] this is all there
[48:00] is in 14 and 14 he says
[48:05] if a man die shall he live again
[48:10] have you ever asked yourself that
[48:12] question
[48:14] if a man dies shall he live again
[48:17] all the days of my appointed time will i
[48:20] wake that he knew
[48:22] he had an appointed time you know we all
[48:25] have an appointed time
[48:29] god knows we don't know that time
[48:32] but he says in my in my appointed time
[48:35] will i
[48:35] wait till my change
[48:39] come he didn't say about a death or a
[48:42] separation or a ceasing to exist but a
[48:46] change
[48:47] what is death it's a change
[48:50] from from the old body that's wore
[48:54] out tired into a new body
[48:58] into a what we call a theophany body
[49:01] there was a sister one time
[49:03] laying in the hospital years ago i
[49:06] remember brother larry
[49:07] garrett showed me the picture of this
[49:08] woman and they had taken a picture of
[49:10] her
[49:12] and when this picture was developed
[49:15] there was a young
[49:16] woman standing next to her she was dying
[49:19] of cancer and she only had
[49:20] a few short days to live and the husband
[49:23] looked at that picture and he said well
[49:24] that's
[49:25] that's my wife when i met her
[49:29] you see that's the offer the body was
[49:30] already standing there waiting
[49:32] jesus said i go to repair a house a
[49:35] mansion
[49:36] he said don't don't let don't be
[49:38] troubled he said
[49:39] don't be afraid he says i go to prepare
[49:43] a place for you that where i am you
[49:46] shall be also it's a house we live in a
[49:49] house
[49:50] amen what you see here is just
[49:53] represents robert figueroa
[49:55] but there's a soul that's eternal that
[49:58] is waiting
[49:58] that that is waiting for the time to be
[50:00] released and to step into a perfect
[50:03] theophility body praise be to god
[50:07] he says in 14 and 15 thou shalt call
[50:11] hallelujah and i will answer thee
[50:15] thou wilt have a desire to the work of
[50:18] thine hands
[50:20] for now thou numbers my steps
[50:23] does thou not watch over my sin
[50:27] we cannot hide anything from him and all
[50:30] it takes friends is a prayer
[50:33] just a prayer in believing and in
[50:36] insincerity
[50:37] ask god lord would you forgive me my
[50:40] sins lord
[50:41] will you come to live in my life will
[50:43] you come and change me
[50:45] that's all it takes and just hand it
[50:47] over to him
[50:49] take the reigns of your life and say
[50:50] lord here they are
[50:53] lead me and guide me
[50:56] in psalms 39 and 4 david uh
[51:00] man after god's own heart he knew how to
[51:03] please god
[51:04] he always had those the right words that
[51:06] came out of his heart
[51:08] there in 39 and 4 psalms he says lord
[51:12] make me to know mine end and the measure
[51:15] of my days don't let me forget lord that
[51:19] i'm mortal
[51:20] don't let me forget lord that one day
[51:23] i have to cross that door one day i have
[51:27] to meet you
[51:29] one day i'll have to face you amen don't
[51:32] let me forget
[51:34] he says what it is is that that i may
[51:36] know
[51:37] how frail i am
[51:41] behold thou has made my days as a
[51:45] handbreath
[51:46] that's from here to here a hand breath
[51:51] and i like that he uses the hand
[51:54] as a metaphor because if you look at
[51:56] your hand this this afternoon
[51:59] i think most of us have an m written in
[52:02] the palms of our hands
[52:04] from the latin word muerte which means
[52:08] death
[52:09] that is written in the palms of our
[52:12] hands every time we look at our hands
[52:14] let us know that we are also mortal
[52:17] and one day god will call us home
[52:20] but like job said you will call and i
[52:23] will answer
[52:25] amen that's what we want when he calls
[52:28] let us be ready to answer here am i lord
[52:31] here am i
[52:33] he goes on he says behold that has made
[52:35] my days as a handbreadth
[52:37] and my age is as nothing before thee
[52:40] verily every man at his best state
[52:43] is all together vanity
[52:46] surely every man walketh in a plain show
[52:50] surely they are disquieted in vain he
[52:53] heapeth up riches and
[52:54] knoweth not who shall gather them
[52:58] now lord what wait i for
[53:02] my hope is in thee
[53:05] deliver me from all my transgressions
[53:09] make me not the reproach of the foolish
[53:13] solomon said oh they're in the book of
[53:15] ecclesiastes
[53:17] he says everything is his vanity and
[53:20] vexation of spirit
[53:22] there's only one thing that counts it's
[53:25] what we've done for christ
[53:28] i'd like to finish this afternoon before
[53:31] i
[53:31] leave the pulpit and
[53:35] take and just read a little poem
[53:39] titled only one life i believe my
[53:42] brother
[53:43] he lived a quiet life he was not one
[53:46] to attract attention he would sit in the
[53:48] back back there and
[53:51] as soon as service was over he'd get up
[53:52] and he'd walk out i think he parked his
[53:54] car out here somewhere and
[53:56] but that was my brother that's the way
[53:57] we're all different right one from the
[53:58] other
[53:59] some of us like to be in the crowd and
[54:01] and some of us like to just kind of
[54:03] be by ourselves and and that's where my
[54:05] brother was he was just quiet
[54:07] and he just lived a quiet life but he
[54:10] was a
[54:11] he was a good husband and a good
[54:13] provider and a
[54:14] good father and a good grandfather he
[54:17] loved his grandchildren
[54:19] i know he loved you all with all his
[54:21] heart
[54:23] only one life which will soon be passed
[54:27] written by c t stud two little lines i
[54:31] heard one day
[54:33] traveling a long life's busy way
[54:36] bringing conviction to my heart and from
[54:39] my mind would not depart
[54:42] only one life will soon be passed only
[54:45] what's done for christ
[54:47] will last only one life yes only one
[54:51] soon will its fleeting hours be done
[54:55] then in that day my lord to meet and
[54:58] stand before
[54:59] his judgment seat only one life will
[55:02] soon be passed
[55:04] only what's done for christ will last
[55:08] only one life the still small voice
[55:11] gently pleads for a better choice
[55:15] bidding these selfish aims to leave
[55:19] and to god's holy will to cleave
[55:22] only one life will soon be passed only
[55:25] what's done for christ
[55:26] will last only one life a few brief
[55:30] years
[55:30] as job said and as david said even with
[55:34] its burdens
[55:35] hopes and fears each with its clays i
[55:39] must fulfill
[55:40] living for self or in his will
[55:44] only one life will soon be passed only
[55:47] what's done for christ will last
[55:50] when this bright world would tempt me
[55:52] sore
[55:53] when satan would a victory score
[55:56] when self would seek to have its way
[55:59] then help me lord with joy to say
[56:02] only one life will soon be passed
[56:06] only what's done for christ will last
[56:09] give me father a purpose deep
[56:13] enjoy your sorrow thy word to keep
[56:17] faithful and true and whatever the
[56:19] strife
[56:20] pleasing thee in my daily life only one
[56:24] life will soon be passed
[56:26] only what's done for christ will last oh
[56:29] let my love
[56:30] with fervor burn and from the world now
[56:33] let me turn living for thee and thee
[56:36] alone
[56:38] bringing thee pleasure on thy throne
[56:41] only one life till soon be passed only
[56:44] was done for christ with last and then
[56:47] only one life yes only one
[56:52] now let me say thy will be done
[56:56] and when at last i hear the call i know
[56:59] i'll say
[57:00] it was worth it all only one life
[57:05] will soon be passed only what's done for
[57:08] christ
[57:10] will last
[57:15] paul left us a scripture
[57:18] that i love and he told us how that
[57:23] that death is nothing to fear
[57:26] he's certain it was a mystery until that
[57:28] time
[57:29] and in closing this afternoon if i
[57:31] turned it back over
[57:33] he said behold i show you a mystery
[57:36] we should not all sleep but we shall all
[57:39] be changed
[57:40] in the moment in the twinkling of an eye
[57:44] at the last trump amen
[57:48] we shall be changed for this corruptable
[57:50] he said must put on
[57:53] incorruptible and this mortal
[57:56] must put on immortality so when this
[58:00] corruptible shall put on incorruption
[58:03] and this
[58:03] mortal shall have put on immortality
[58:06] then shall be brought to
[58:07] pass the saying that is written death
[58:11] is swallowed up in victory he said o
[58:14] death where is thy sting
[58:17] oh grave where is your victory
[58:21] the strength of sin is a law
[58:24] but thanks be unto god who gives us the
[58:27] victory
[58:28] through our lord jesus christ amen
[58:31] my brother has won the victory
[58:35] now it's up to us that are behind him
[58:38] making our way towards that finish line
[58:39] as well
[58:40] to find that victory amen press the
[58:43] course my friend
[58:45] don't give up there's more on the other
[58:48] side now that there is on this side
[58:50] and there and there and they're cheering
[58:52] us on this morning
[58:53] this afternoon they're looking over the
[58:55] banister right now
[58:57] my parents are there i got uncles i got
[58:59] i got cousins
[59:00] they're looking over the banister and
[59:02] they're saying come on
[59:04] just one more mile just one more hill

[1:23:44] on behalf of my family yeah cousins
[1:23:49] i would like to share with you a little
[1:23:53] bit
[1:23:54] about how much your father and husband
[1:23:58] data meant to me personally
[1:24:02] i firmly believe that every chance that
[1:24:04] you get
[1:24:05] to talk about somebody who was special
[1:24:07] in your life you should take that chance
[1:24:09] and you should run with it
[1:24:11] and that's what i'm gonna do today
[1:24:16] i have nothing prepared but it's it's
[1:24:18] here and i'm just gonna have to try and
[1:24:20] find it
[1:24:20] it's there and it'll come out
[1:24:24] the one thing that i will always
[1:24:27] remember is that
[1:24:29] these feet that are in these shoes
[1:24:32] the first time that they ever felt the
[1:24:35] beauty of grass was at your home
[1:24:38] it was some grass that my feel would mow
[1:24:41] and kept
[1:24:43] looking beautiful we tried so many times
[1:24:46] in our own home
[1:24:48] to get that grass bring some here
[1:24:52] and plant it it just it wasn't right but
[1:24:55] it was right at the ranch i remember
[1:24:56] that place i remember it like if it was
[1:24:58] yesterday
[1:25:01] the first time that these hands felt the
[1:25:04] coldness of
[1:25:05] the snow was on a fitting
[1:25:08] christmas morning where we went and
[1:25:11] spent it at your house
[1:25:13] it was the first time that i've ever
[1:25:15] witnessed the white christmas i'm a
[1:25:16] native to sonan
[1:25:18] the places that i grew up i
[1:25:22] couldn't run on the grass with no shoes
[1:25:24] on those a little bit too many thorns
[1:25:26] there but not at your home it will be
[1:25:28] something that i always always remember
[1:25:34] i was very very upset with myself
[1:25:35] because i didn't go see my theo the day
[1:25:37] before he passed away but i
[1:25:39] was very very happy to see him laying
[1:25:42] resting in peace the way that i will
[1:25:45] always remember him he was a man
[1:25:47] of peace and you could see it in this
[1:25:52] in this video collage he wasn't just a
[1:25:54] man of peace
[1:25:56] he was a joyous man of peace his smile
[1:25:59] radiated
[1:26:00] he was kind of goofy it was very very
[1:26:03] interesting to try to
[1:26:04] figure him out
[1:26:08] every time that i spoke with him i knew
[1:26:10] that the conversation would be of
[1:26:12] substance and it would be
[1:26:13] filled with love and compassion
[1:26:22] the last conversation that i had with
[1:26:24] him that i know
[1:26:26] that i'll remember was sitting in the
[1:26:29] backyard of his home
[1:26:30] now the north side
[1:26:33] of tucson we were talking about the
[1:26:37] different things
[1:26:39] talk to me a lot about the rain
[1:26:41] harvesting the rain harvesting
[1:26:43] system that he was so delicately putting
[1:26:47] together it was a
[1:26:48] thing to marvel
[1:26:53] we all know that last year 2020 was the
[1:26:56] driest year of tucson
[1:26:58] didn't rain very much it rained very
[1:27:01] very little
[1:27:03] but the last time that i saw my deal not
[1:27:06] only was he resting in peace
[1:27:09] we had just had a large rain and those
[1:27:12] water harvesting barrels were filled
[1:27:14] with water
[1:27:17] i love you guys thank you
[1:27:48] well i'm very was very thankful to have
[1:27:53] two wonderful brother-in-laws
[1:27:58] and uh
[1:28:01] i know brother branham preached god in
[1:28:03] simplicity
[1:28:07] and i believe that they simply believed
[1:28:10] in god
[1:28:13] man i believe my father-in-law and my
[1:28:16] wife
[1:28:17] and my brother-in-law they believe in
[1:28:19] this simple
[1:28:20] gospel and
[1:28:26] i see how the spirit of god
[1:28:30] follows that god is in simplicity a lot
[1:28:34] of times we
[1:28:37] put him up too far we want to be too
[1:28:39] intellectual
[1:28:41] and he's really in simplicity
[1:28:47] we don't understand why some things have
[1:28:49] to happen but
[1:28:52] god knows and
[1:28:55] i'm thankful for one thing that we know
[1:28:57] him and the many discussions that i had
[1:28:59] with uh
[1:29:00] julio he always wanted to be closer to
[1:29:02] god
[1:29:04] and many times i'd get together with bob
[1:29:07] and my father-in-law and
[1:29:09] uh julio and we talk about the lord
[1:29:14] it was always this desire to be closer
[1:29:17] to god
[1:29:19] and we work together building our houses
[1:29:22] out where we live
[1:29:23] now and we spent a lot of time
[1:29:27] working on those things but
[1:29:30] i think that what stands out to me about
[1:29:34] this life is simplicity and how god is
[1:29:37] blesses simplicity
[1:29:41] we want to be too great
[1:29:45] we just need to be simple and believe
[1:29:48] god
[1:29:50] and i know my father-in-law a great
[1:29:53] believer and
[1:29:55] he testified to a lot of people and
[1:29:58] with great results and i had his uh
[1:30:01] uncle fred uh peter roy
[1:30:08] he was also a great blessing
[1:30:10] [Music]
[1:30:13] i thought maybe i could sing a song but
[1:30:16] i think i'm a little bit too emotional
[1:30:19] to do it
[1:30:24] see i'll try it
[1:30:28] if i can't do it i'll just sit down
[1:30:40] have you ever played he'll understand
[1:30:42] and say well done
[1:30:48] well i'll just sing an acapella
[1:30:53] if she can't play it
[1:31:00] when if you give
[1:31:03] the best
[1:31:07] of your service
[1:31:11] telling the world that a savior
[1:31:15] is come be
[1:31:19] not dismayed when men
[1:31:22] don't believe you he'll
[1:31:26] understand he'll say

[1:31:37] my journey the way of life

[1:39:19] i'm joel pacettely uh i'd have to say
[1:39:22] julio is probably my favorite deal
[1:39:25] i like going to see him i just have a
[1:39:27] few memories
[1:39:28] no real pep talk because we have to
[1:39:30] grieve and
[1:39:32] remember them as they were
[1:39:35] anyway i remember going with thea
[1:39:39] when he'd get off work to get something
[1:39:40] to feed him
[1:39:42] and he'd be in his tp shirt with the
[1:39:44] glasses
[1:39:46] the dark glasses and it was uh
[1:39:49] either burger king or pat's chili dogs
[1:39:51] on irvington
[1:39:53] remember and
[1:39:57] she'd be so
[1:40:00] she'd get something to eat for him every
[1:40:01] day because no right when he's getting
[1:40:03] off
[1:40:04] that was everything i remember because
[1:40:07] we were hardly in tucson
[1:40:08] we'd be traveling around the country all
[1:40:10] the time but that was one thing i
[1:40:12] remember
[1:40:13] of him in his tep shirt and then
[1:40:16] his motorcycle when i was really young
[1:40:18] he'd be on that motorcycle and
[1:40:20] he was so cool
[1:40:24] that's how i remember him
[1:40:40] hey
[1:40:45] once uh i used to go to school here when
[1:40:47] i was younger
[1:40:49] and uh my uncle ted gave me a big little
[1:40:52] knife he got from africa
[1:40:55] and uh it was pretty cool so i brought
[1:40:57] it to school for show-and-tell
[1:41:00] and uh i got paddled of course
[1:41:04] and uh brother simrock came out and he's
[1:41:07] like
[1:41:07] look at your boy brought and
[1:41:11] i was like man i'm gonna get home and
[1:41:13] i'm gonna get it i was like this is
[1:41:15] gonna be
[1:41:15] bad and on the right home he goes hey
[1:41:21] here's your knife back don't be bringing
[1:41:22] it to the school anymore
[1:41:26] it's just he just had a way to be
[1:41:30] common
[1:41:35] he's a good dad
[1:41:56] i'll just share a few things um
[1:42:00] the things i remember the most is he was
[1:42:03] always snapping gum
[1:42:05] he could snap gum like nobody else i've
[1:42:07] ever heard
[1:42:08] always had gum his mouth and he could
[1:42:12] whistle
[1:42:12] like nobody else he was a really good
[1:42:15] whistler i always
[1:42:16] loved to hear him whistle his song
[1:42:21] and i definitely remember the whoppers
[1:42:24] he would pick us up from school
[1:42:25] sometimes
[1:42:26] at the end of the day and he'd take us
[1:42:28] over to that
[1:42:29] nana's house and he would always stop at
[1:42:31] burger king and pick up some
[1:42:33] whoppers so we could eat whoppers at
[1:42:36] that house but um
[1:42:39] kind of miss him i'm sorry i didn't get
[1:42:42] to see him before
[1:42:45] he passed but
[1:42:48] i definitely loved him the goofiness
[1:42:51] definitely runs in the family
[1:42:54] let's figure they're so goofy but
[1:42:57] um a lot of really good memories
[1:43:16] i have lots of memories of my dad
[1:43:20] but one memory that always sticks out
[1:43:23] yes you know during those teenage years
[1:43:27] you're a little more rebellious and
[1:43:29] you get a little more fights with your
[1:43:31] dad and
[1:43:32] my dad was men of little words you know
[1:43:35] but i have memories of him and i haven't
[1:43:38] fight about something i don't really
[1:43:40] remember what it was
[1:43:42] and he wouldn't say anything and i would
[1:43:44] go in my room
[1:43:46] but the next morning i would always wake
[1:43:47] up and i would
[1:43:49] open the door and there would always be
[1:43:51] a package of gum at my door
[1:43:54] or a bottle of snapple and that was his
[1:43:57] way to
[1:43:57] apologize for what we were talking about
[1:44:00] or
[1:44:01] how we were mad at each other
[1:44:04] those are those are funny memories that
[1:44:06] that's the way he would talk
[1:44:08] sometimes you know man of little words
[1:44:11] but
[1:44:11] those little tiny things he used to do
[1:44:13] for us
[1:44:15] i just think back and i just love those
[1:44:16] ways he had about himself
[1:44:19] so packages of gold and snapple at the
[1:44:21] door means that he was sorry
[1:44:24] but yeah those are those memories that
[1:44:26] and we have lots of memories you know
[1:44:28] we love him we're going to miss him life
[1:44:31] is going to be so different without him
[1:44:35] only god can pull us through thank you
[1:44:39] guys all for coming
[1:44:57] those are precious memories precious
[1:45:01] things to remember
[1:45:04] to have parents that love the lord jesus
[1:45:08] and raised you up that way
[1:45:11] i i tell a story when i was young
[1:45:15] we would go down the street to a
[1:45:17] friend's house
[1:45:19] because they had a tv and we wanted to
[1:45:22] watch cartoons
[1:45:24] and we didn't have one at our house but
[1:45:26] they always wanted to be at our house
[1:45:30] so one day i convinced him to let us go
[1:45:33] to your house
[1:45:35] and me and my younger brother and we're
[1:45:37] watching cartoons
[1:45:39] and then little steve the youngest
[1:45:42] brother began to scream and yell and run
[1:45:44] out
[1:45:45] and i was with his older brother eddie
[1:45:47] he was my friend and
[1:45:49] he says let's go let's go and we took
[1:45:51] off running and didn't know why
[1:45:53] because mom and daddy didn't get along
[1:45:56] and they begin to fight and he says
[1:45:59] that's why i never want you at my house
[1:46:01] and i want to be at your house because
[1:46:02] that never happens at your house
