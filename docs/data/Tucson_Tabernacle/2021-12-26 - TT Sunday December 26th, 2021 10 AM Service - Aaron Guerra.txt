[Music] we are often tossed and driven on the restless sea of time somber skies and howling tempest offseason bright sunshine that land of perfect day [Music] when the morning comes [Music] it better by and by we are often destitute of the things that life demands want a food and want of shelter thirsty hills barren lands but we're trusting in the lord and according to god's word we will

cherished plans have failed disappointments have prevailed and we've wandered in the darkness heavy hearted and alone but we're trusting in the lord and according to his word we will understand it better by and by oh my invite when the morning comes when all the saints of god are gathered home we will tell the story how we've overcome and we'll understand it better by and by temptations hidden snares often take us unawares and our hearts are made to be for some thoughtless word ordeal and we wonder why the test when we try to do our best but we'll understand it better by and by oh by and by [Music] will [Music] see the bible says things like precious the sight of the lord is the death of his sins so we don't always have everything rosy but we've got joy we've got victory in jesus and in

we love him because he first loved us you may be seated we have a few announcements and thank you to bring to your attention um [Music] yesterday brother jordan [Music] you know around noon are so informed is it sister lori mr martha peterson's mom passed away and um they were in in his text that he sent us he said the atmosphere was wonderful the the lord had been with him no question about it and that is the consolation that a christian has that in all things god is there [Music] at times we might think god is has backed away or he's not watching but he's there he's taking care of all things she had just turned 60 years old they were celebrating her birthday and also their 39th wedding anniversary so it's one of those things as a human you look and say why but as a christian you say lord you know what's best in all things brother jordan did say that the atmosphere and the presence there was wonderful it was it was the atmosphere and the presence that christians have about them because god said i'll never leave you i'll never forsake you he didn't say you'll understand it all but there would be comfort in that time so no arrangements made yet it's it's early but they would let us know so remember the whole family i know that wednesday night at the end of service and i just had turned over to sister martha to answer something something just said let the sisters pray for her so that she came up and then at the end of service she had said i needed something like that i asked i had asked the lord if he could allow that him god is mindful of his of his children also when we put this on on the whatsapp brother luke foster sister cheryl hall's father passed away this past week it's been some time since i'd seen brother luke here but at one time he would play the guitar up here with us some time but i asked how mom was doing the sister foster was doing well she's 81 but doing well so um just remember them in prayer also and then yesterday afternoon i've got from brother matthew watkins and also brother um reggie plett that brother tim cross had been in a motorcycle accident on saturday he was riding his father's motorcycle and he went around a career and lost control sister faith had said possibly concussion bruised or broken shoulder that was yesterday afternoon no update from that but just believing that the lord would would be bring quick healing i know brother cross is supposed to be with us the last sunday of harmony and then from there going to nicaragua too for a youth convention down there so let's remember that and we we wonder why we ask god lord i don't understand and maybe as a human you might even question and say lord if you're with us then why these things but it's a it's a faith walk with god you have to to to say lord i committed to you i you know what's best for me and you know the reasons why so we'll keep them in prayer and and as we get more information we'll pass it on so and then i had been wondering about the youth choir because they had no more information but sister lily said they posted on the announcement that it would be here on january 8th which is a saturday evening i don't know much more details than that but that we were all invited and then of course harmony in the desert january 12-16 that wednesday evening on the 12th brother branham preached for the first time in tucson here at the tabernacle with central assembly of god behind this physical pulpit so that night we will play that message jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever brother john hall posted sent me a message and there's an announcement that they posted on the newspaper for those services so if we can get a copy of that we'd like to post that up also so brother dan evans was here with us on sunday they're here in tucson now happy to be here we've asked him to minister for us on wednesday night and he said he would do that then brother john mcfadden will be here this sunday following sunday a week from today and ministering the sunday morning service for sure he was not sure if he would take both services so those are just things too look forward and this evening servants has been canceled tonight so we're just having the one morning service and um let's take advantage of what god has for us this morning so again keeping the tablets and family the peterson and all those that are affected foster family brother tim cross in prayer and again i'm reminded of the southern family with brother jason and our sister pat and them going through that time and i know it's a time of questioning a time of wondering why but god is more than able to so if you'll stand with me i something in my heart today maybe a continuation from last sunday thank you where we spoke on just faith as a revelation so let's just bow our heads lord we we come this morning on a sunday morning the first day of the week resurrection morning lord to honor that because you're jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever lord and that's the identification of of god is the consistency the sameness no variable there's no shadow of turning something that is that is secure that is permanent lord you're the same yesterday today and forever lord we ask you to have your own way to minister to us this morning we can set ourselves aside lord and let you speak to our hearts and draw us closer to you as our prayer in jesus christ's name amen one scripture hebrews 13 8 the theme of brother branham's message jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever again jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever amen you may be seated as much as we want to be consistent as much as we want to be the same we're affected by events around us by the feeling of our own infirmities by by situations that are out of our control and even sometimes in our control and we can have our up days and down days but he's the same yesterday looking back into history and everything behind and you see how is today and forever so it's it's it is uh uh something to take uh comfort in to have confidence in that it's going to be consistent it's going to be the same if you approach him in the manner he said to approach him he'll be there it's not going to be like i hope he's there you know sometimes you might be we might be driving down the road and he would say you know it'd be nice to stop by and see we're close to that let's stop by and see them let's hope they're there and let's hope they want to see us too but you know that if you if you if you'll bow down to him if you humble your heart before him he is ready to minister and draw an eye to you and then we'll look at hebrews 11 6 we use this scripture last last sunday hebrews 11 6. without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is he exists he's the same yesterday today and forever and that he he is a reward of rewarder of them that diligently seek them lord i've come sunday morning and i'm going to give you two hours today and you go ahead and take care of all my needs and then the rest of the week is mine that's not what the scripture says those that diligently seek him which means there is there's constant there is you know um knowing a little bit of brother lyle's background in his work and talking to him some in in the discoveries or should i say the things that the company that they did and all there's a lot of hours of work behind that it doesn't happen the thought may come the impression may come uh you know that there's something there but to search it out to work through it to work all the bugs out to to get it to work properly we were talking about some another conversation about some large vehicles we'd seen and things driving down the road and you see these these caravans the large trucks with all the escorts and i asked something brother lila i said what is the biggest vehicle you've ever been on and he said at the time it was the largest dump truck in the world and they had provided the controls on that and they let him drive it but it didn't happen just one day there was a lot of work to get to that place and god if i could put it this way in god's mind he had seen it all already and he knew what it would take to get to this place we celebrate christmas the world celebrates christmas he was born for a reason now you could read the scriptures and know where to say well he was born on this day and it would be 33 years but the events tell us how it it it proceeded to come to this to the day where he would kneel down at gethsemane and says not my will but thy will be done father had his heart set towards jerusalem to fulfill that which he had desired so again without faith it is impossible no way to please god and and it's it's faith you know you take the word faith it's an absolute trust confidence belief you'll lay your eternal destination on it you're willing to say i'll give it all for that hebrews 12 1 take this one here wherefore seeing we are also compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin sin is unbelief the attributes of unbelief demonstrate them in many different ways there's unbelief you say well i don't not believe in god but can you believe to believe that he's with you i would never say i don't believe that there is no god but what about is he mindful of me what's my position with him where do i stand with him let us lay aside every weight and the sin that doth so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us patience there's a step by step to get to the end i ran cross country in my sophomore year and you started at the beginning and you finished at the end sometimes and in my case a few times you didn't run hard through the whole thing especially getting i started running when the season started so i was not in shape to be running but those that had been running for a long time worked out all summer they ran hard from the beginning to the very end at the end of the season i was barely getting into the shape that they had started in so i was way behind them but there's a race set before us and there's a there's a battle to be won there's victories to have and you've got to go forward with this and just therefore surrounded as we are by such a vast cloud of witnesses let us fling aside every encumbrance and the sin that does so readily entangle our feet and let us run with patience patient endurance the race that lies before endurance when you hear the word endure you don't think oh that's going to be a picnic when you hear the word endurance endure know that there's going to be a battle there's going to be a time there's going to be a lot of effort that's going to be put forth but there is a cloud of witnesses that say it's worth every bit of it they'd courage if you could hear them speaking you'll come my brother come i said don't give up don't call it a day yet because we have overcome and another way and i that that i really just looked at how somebody wrote this wherefore being encompassed with a cloud a great multitude trending upward with a holy swiftness of witnesses of the power of faith let us lay aside every way as all who run a race take care to do to throw off whatever weighs us down or dampens the vigor of our soul and the sin that which so easily besets us let us lay that all aside i thought that was a good description there as every runner does when you're training you might see them training football player or something they'll put weights on themselves they'll carry their drag to build build their strengths up but when it comes to the performance all that is set aside if you're running you could try to get as light as you possibly can to run the race that is set before you a couple of of quotes here that brother bran and i went through the message sirs we would see jesus some things that just caught my attention so bring that first quote up these next three quotes all be from the same message i think that's got the condition i think that's got the condition our church is getting into god shook every gift that he promised in the bible before us and we still stare in space now he was talking about that little boy the mother who had a little child and taken he had some kind of sickness with him and he'd taken him to the doctor and the doctor did some things he says i think he's well i think i see some progress in him so mom took him to a store and she took the different toys that should catch a child's attention and waved it in front of him and he had a blank look and it never caught his attention and she was crying and moaning because the doctor said something but she was seeing no evidence and this is what brother branham says he says we'll stare in space as we're looking for something else it seems to be a spiritual condition of the church that they fail to see the hour that they're living they are looking for some sensations or something that something way off in the future man is forever doing that he always blesses god for what he has done looking forward for what he will do and ignoring what he is doing you fail to see the hour that we're living that's what those greeks wanted to know that's the the hour was and what the messiah would be the portion of scripture that was made known for that day if the messiah fulfilled it that's the evidence the vindicated word of the hour is the evidence not that he had to have the fruits of the spirit he had to be a lawyer in the courts of justice for his or one of his pharisee or sadducee organizations he was the manifestation of god's promised word of that hour you want to see what the fruit of the spirit is watch what the bible promises for a certain hour then watch for that to be vindicated that's the evidence jesus said search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life they are they that testify me that's what proves who i am if god said it and it comes to pass you can say that's god if it i said and it fails you would say that's aaron you can't have that confidence in me because i cannot bring it to pass god has to do that but as a christian you put your faith your expectation your hope more than a hope in what god said not as what man says not what the government says because that can vary from day to day the government comes out with a law or something they want to do and you get all these people protesting these people pushing it becomes a big battle goes to the courts and it stays in the courts for years trying to make the decision what is going to be there that the next quote there and sarah tried to deny it we know this here's when when god when jehovah there he tells abraham you're going to have that child and sarah laughed but i like this portion here and being that she was part of abraham her unbelief would have condemned her but god could not take her cause she was part of abraham i'm so glad i'm a part of the family of god you have to recognize you're a part of the family of god you're doing no his doing your portion is to accept it believe it receive it say yes i am the church would have been condemned long ago but it's part of christ i'm so glad again i'm part of the family of god well we'll hold on to next quotes for a little bit later here so faith is a revelation it's unveiled to you it's made real um you know if you had we had christmas at the house and families were there our grandchildren my parents everybody and of course all the gifts are laid out and everything and the anticipation of what's in what's in the bag especially for the young ones and to watch them open the package and i just needed this i was hoping it was this you know well we knew what it was because we put it in the package or sometimes i say uh open the bag so i can see what we bought you because mama did and i really wasn't involved in it so he can see it but see he provided he met every need he's provided everything when you open the scriptures you're not surprising him you're opening the scriptures and they're saying lord and he goes i know that's why it's there for you to partake of for you to receive of for you to draw from that's why i had it put there so you can receive from it the the um i'm going to say it this way because that's what the squeal of emotion from chloe oh just what i wanted you know and it's fun it it enjoyment to see that but there should be that same joy in our hearts when we realize god has given us this god has met this god has fulfilled this yes lord i appreciate it and i love you for it you should have that same reaction he said so it was what but then here's the the interesting thing because it was chloe asher bianca ava and liam the young ones there and what did you get oh look at mine and the course of the two younger ones is oh i like kids i want to go play with his oh and i want to go grab that one and oh i want to go do this you know and and we're watching it and if we're not careful we have that same attitude lord it seems my brother is more blessed than i am it seems like he has a better gift than i do my no no take what god has given you and rejoice in that and appreciate it and let god use that not everybody's sins not everybody plays an instrument not ever but you have a part to play in and do do that part in rejoicing and watch how god would bless you but sarah here and here's the thought today does unbelief hinder god does it hinder god the answer to that is no a definite no but it does hinder you unbelief will not hinder god his plan and his purpose will accomplish his word will not return void that's what the scripture says therefore you can say lord i'm i'm hanging my eternal destination on what your word says romans chapter 3 verse 3. paul says this for what if some did not believe shall their unbelief make the faith of god without effect if my brother my sister my neighbor my friend does not believe i choose to believe i choose to stand on the word of god and say yes he's the same yesterday today and forever and as as i was reading through brother branham preaches that message where is it unbelief does not hinder god he's still going to fulfill his word but we're the ones that are hindered by our unbelief we're the ones that struggle through that but paul says if for if some did not did that hinder god it did not stop the plan of god it continues on hebrews 3 19. we hear again paul says 3 19 did i write 13 i'm sorry i probably did but it's chapter 3 verse 19. so we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief now if faith is a revelation then unbelief is not a revelation it's got to be the opposite did god really mean that is that promise for today was that something just for brother branham was that something in the future or is god jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever they got to the cro the red sea now we we know these these we have the the privilege of reading the scriptures and seeing the account of it and we can stop in our attitude say why didn't they believe look at how because we've had the advantage of reading and seeing it but you're living everything today and sometimes you get into that same place lord where are you i i thought you would be here we wouldn't say it but at every beckon and every command that i give that you would just do it doesn't work that way he is the potter and i am the clay and he's got an image of you that he's already seen a finished vessel for the master's use but he didn't tell you how many years how much time it's going to take to get there he's got a purpose and a plan on it your in mind is to say yes lord i surrender he had promised them a deliverer and he sends moses to come deliver the children of israel because god keeps his word he had already prophesied that they were coming out of captivity and he sends moses down and with great wonders great signs to the point when israel leaves egypt the egyptians give them all the gifts and all you would have thought they would have said this is god but in a couple days they're in front of the red sea and boy they're being human again lord you brought us this far just to drown just to be destroyed just to be lord you're just like us then that's kind of what you're saying you're just like me i was really excited about this and i got this far now i'm down and disappointed but he just simply says to moses why cry speak did you not just do that a few days you spoke and there were flies you what has changed between here and then if anything you should have more confidence in him today than you had before because he's faithful he doesn't stop he doesn't quit he doesn't kick back and says all right you're on your own for the next couple of weeks he's with you he's always with you but they could not enter because of their unbelief they could let me just say that they could not see themselves on the other side they got to the end and said no it's too big it's too hard it's too great we can't do it the limits of our god ended right here at the jordan river he's not able to finish the job oh i would never say that brother and that's our attitude sometimes god where are you in this where are you in this matthew 17 verse 20 and jesus said unto them because of your unbelief the disciples just asked him why had they not been able to cast out the demons out of this person and jesus does he said because of your unbelief and again if faith is a revelation then unbelief is not a revelation it hasn't been revealed or it has been but you've not accepted it because it's not maybe how you think or if you're not careful because you're not worthy of it when will you be worthy of it what's the the test the equivalent what's the number you have to reach before you're considered worthy that little woman who reached up and said if i can but touch the hem of his garment and she did it and she got what she needed and jesus didn't say now wait a minute wait a minute you can't have this he said somebody touched me they drew from me they took it by faith and they accepted it and they went and took that action to receive it now peter and the disciples around him are looking at him the ones that have seen this over and over and they look at him and say what's wrong with you you got your touch you're amongst thousands of people and somebody touched you and he has to look at him he says virtue has left me i know when somebody touches me i know the effect it has it says woman thy faith has saved thee the revelation that she got that if she could judge touch the hem of his garments she would receive what she had we've got to have that same attitude that same lord you said so therefore i'm going to take it you please him when you do that there's none of this that's not yours keep away no it's come come drink of this water freely come and feast come and jesus has a table spread where the saints of god are fed he invites his children he tells them if ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed you shall say unto this mountain and for so long i remember growing up thinking boy i wonder what big mountain they moved was it the tucson mountains no the mountain in your life the mountain that is before you the things that you can't seem to overcome that which is so hard that makes it so hard for you to walk in daily victory that's your mountain remove hands to yonder place remove from me and go bother that one no that's not what you're asking god to do get it out of the way let somebody else deal with it no just get it out completely let it not be a trouble anywhere and it shall remove that's god's word it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible unto you oh man that that's asking a lot lord well he said try me try me if you get to thinking sometimes i can't just go outside and look at nature for a little while watch the sunrise watch the moon come up watch the things that god has said that will never fail and remind yourself that's the god i serve he loves me he cares for me he did all this for me it's okay he did it all for all of us but we all can take it for ourselves then in mark 6 verses 5 and 6 and he could do there he could there do no mighty work say that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk and healed them and he marveled because of their unbelief and he went around about the village's teaching he morally goes my was he was he was he surprised that's not what the word means he just says these people are not getting what they need because they just won't accept it just won't believe it now not accepting it unbelief isn't necessarily saying oh lord i just don't believe it really the issue is i'm not good enough that's not for me that's for another time that was for that age this is all of it for all of us is your name in the book it's yours it's yours what every promise in the book is mine every chapter every verse every line he marveled he says here they are starving i put food out before them and they refuse to eat and then they say i'm hungry we've done that before after mom would make meal but it wasn't really what we wanted and she said it would say eat but i don't want to eat that well that's if you're hungry eat lord you know what's best for me now brother branham says in the message unbelief does not hinder god we'll look at a couple of quotes there it doesn't hinder god it hinders you it doesn't slow him down it doesn't make him less effective as you're the one that has to deal with the unbelief you're the one that has to say lord help thou my unbelief remember the public in there and the priest the priest is there standing on his own righteousness standing on his works and telling god and this this is the parable that jesus uses telling god how worthy he is of the blessings because i came to church on sunday morning sunday evening i was on wednesday i heard two tapes today i did this i did that i gave him my whole list of what makes me worthy of it and he said when i see the blood i will pass over you and you have to accept that portion of it that's where faith takes hold he did it for me therefore i can come into his presence thinking of isaiah when isaiah comes in and he's isaiah was a good man had a wonderful testimony yet he comes into the presence of god and first thing he says woe is me but he bids us come you can come into his presence you must enter into the holy of holies today the curtain that has been rent has has been open for us to get in how through the shed blood through the sacrifice that he provided and let me say it this way you've got to come in the provided way for your day and today it's the word of god the whole word of god you can't leave any of it out every promise everything that god has said it's yours brother branham used to uh give this this example he said an arcade uh um a five and ten store maybe or i i remember some of those still where they had a little bit of everything and he says it's yours go in there and open every box open every door climb up on the shelves look to see what's in there that's yours and you have need of it take it accept it believe it and if we should have any revelation should be presented to us that's contrary to the written word then we should never receive it to the written word not somebody's idea of the word i stood outside across the street one day i needed to speak to a brother and there was another brother and they were across the street in the on the lot next door there and the one brother was standing there with his arms raised and as i approach he is just sharing his revelation to the other brother so i just waited for a few minutes while he finished and um i don't know what he was trying to say but obviously he thought the other brother needed to hear it and when he finished he opens his eyes and he sees me and he says so what do you think brother and sometimes it's best to be honest i think and this is all i said personally i think you're nuts that's how i answered him and he looked at me i said you just you're just sounding off on what you think things are turned to the brother said i'll talk to you later and i walked away that same brother sat here in our church his children with their hair cut earrings pants on and he said this statement brother jerry mcfadden to myself he said this statement you people dress this way and do this way because you're still bound we're so free and god today we can do anything we want i walked out we left went stopped by the am pm to get a drink on the way home and the brother was in the in the store and i kind of hesitated i don't think i want to go in there i just told him he was what i thought about him earlier that day that evening and then i go you know he's going to raise but i went in and sure enough soon he saw me he started wanting to preach to me in the store i said can you wait till we step outside you're causing a commotion he steps outside he starts telling me some things i just looked at him and said brother there was a day looking at you and your family there would be no question of anybody who would say there's a christian family but today you look just like them and you act just like them and they would never know you're a christian and he took his hand back and i said he's going to hit me so i left a couple things i learned my mama said if they're going to hit you run you know i did learn a few things but you know what we can get so caught up in our own idea and our own revelation it doesn't produce godliness it rep it produces pharisees and sadducees and people like that i thank my god i'm not like them and god is saying oh some i wish you'd have a little bit of their attitude sometimes i don't like dealing with that one he says if we would receive or is presented to us that is contrary to the written word then we should never receive it because that's exactly what satan did to eve she had the word but she was hunting for some new light and satan seen to it that she got it so we would never want to add anything to the word or take anything from the word but just leave it the way it is stay right with the word for anything contrary is unbelief or lack of revelation and unbelief manifests itself in many different ways it can a a manifest self in self-righteousness and then totally contrary to they're all wrong they all need cleansing they all need forgiveness they all need changing and if anything if you look at the scriptures and all the thing and brother branham even when he didn't think the thing that troubled him is a self-righteous spirit it's the hardest to deal with it's hard to deal with that in your own self you have to realize i've got to humble my heart before god i say lord it's not me it's you now a little while and the world seeth me no more brother braham says the unbeliever but you shall see me for i'll be with you even to the consummation to the end of all things the end of the time jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever if he lives won't he produce the same thing won't his life produce as it did if it's living in you if you plant a seed an orange tree seed it gives an orange tree if you take and plant the seed that you plant and you could expect something else out of it but it has to give out of the life that it has and by its fruits you'll know it you could have planted an apple seed believing it was an orange seed and you have an apple tree that grows and apples hanging the tree but you're telling everybody how do you like my orange tree oh i'd never get to that we won't we sure do sometimes hey i'm a christian just look at me somebody's looking if that's christianity i really don't want it the the thing that said about brother branham so often the humility the humble spirit the sweetness about him how he was willing to walk with a sinner put his arm around him not be contaminated but trying to give what he had to that one for greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world does that mean that i'm going to go get right into the midst of sin and live in it no but if i want to go reach someone and i've got to go i don't need to be afraid because greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world and he said i'll go with you i'll even be in you to the end of the world he says it will produce the same thing one more there unbelief never stopped him he just kept right on going he healed the sick raised the dead cleansed the lepers went right on and when they didn't believe such things could happen and their their unbelief did not stop jesus at all he went right on doing just what he was supposed to do never bothered him a bit i must go about my father's business and it didn't trouble he didn't say oh my what am i going to do now the one time the scriptures tell us that he got on his knees there at gethsemane and he asked the father is it possible to accomplish your will differently that really was the hardest decision to be willing to give it up and say not my will but i will he had set his face towards jerusalem knowing where he was going what he was going there for but it had to come to that place to say not my will but thy will be done do we have one more there no i believe that was the last one there unbelief does not hinder god it hinders us ask what you will with that with faith without wavering and it shall be yeah brother aaron it's it's it's hard i'm not saying it's easy i'm not saying it's just oh just you know it's an everyday thing there is some subject and there is some serenity there's some yielding there is some more to find the deeds of the flesh to get to this place to come to that point where because yes lord i have learned through the experiences of life and the times with you and everything that if i'll just say yes lord you'll bring to pass what you desire you didn't say i'd understand it all you didn't say i could figure it all you didn't even say that i would be happy about it all but there would be a peace that would come with him that god is in control we'll go to some more scriptures here in in revelations or romans we were going through here first timothy chapter one or paul writing here 12-14 he says watch what paul says here and i thank christ je i thank christ jesus our lord who have enabled me for that he counted me faithful putting me into the ministry who was before a blasphemer and a persecutor and injurious i did more harm than i did good thinking i was doing god a service and i cause more injury and more trouble and hurts he says but i obtained mercy because i did it ignorantly in unbelief thinking i was doing god a service he said in my unbelief of the reward revealed word for that day i obtain mercy paul looked back he realized he said i was doing these things thinking i was doing god a service thinking i was up to date with what god was doing that the law of moses was still in full effect he said but i obtained mercy because i did it in ignorance we are not an ignorant people today we know what the word of god is what he has said god has been merciful to us and has unveiled it and opened it we can't use this excuse lord i didn't know we do know but we can say lord help thou my unbelief help me to overcome help me to get past this if i got to go through the test let me go through the test again until i reach that point where i've passed that test not with a d-minus which is a passing grade but in full fulfillment of your word and the grace of our lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in christ jesus the grace the unmerited favor of god lord you owe me grace no no no no he chose to do it whether i was worthy of it or not he said with faith and you know again if you take that word right now and just take it with a revelation when it becomes real to you when it's more than a hope we live a people of hope there's no question about it but it's got to go beyond hope i hope the lord will do this i hope that i'll be an overcomer i hope when is a hope going to take god at his word when is it going to be say i am not because i made myself but because he promised it and he lives in me i know that sometimes we'll we'll come home and we're hoping for this and it's not you know i hope this will be that or when i get to work or when when you get to the store i hope they have some today you know and and that's the human side of us i'm not saying it isn't but if you live by hope you're going to get you're going to get disappointed quite often quite often i hope i find it i left it somewhere i hope i find it brother green taught us this place it and go pick it up lord it's in your word therefore i can go to your word and receive it it's not in my works it's not in my thinking it's not in that it's in your word and your word never fails it's beyond a hope it becomes a revelation god said it therefore it is you're the lord god that healeth all my diseases therefore it does it doesn't fail now i'm not i'm not belittling anything or anybody honestly because i've got physical ailments in my body but he's the lord god that healeth me that's my testimony that's what i stand on you say well what if it doesn't happen in this body talk to him about it i know what his word says but i know that there is a body that is whole and complete because he said so sin won't enter in there unbelief won't enter there sickness won't be there but he's given us a taste of that already in healing let's go to romans we hit a little bit of this last sunday we'll read 4 16 and then 18-25 therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace now the the faith is not something you earn it's not something you work up to it's not not something you battle for it's by the grace of god paul realized that because he just said here he says i did it ignorantly but by the grace of god by his choosing by his mercy i am who i am today he says to the end that to to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed and i just question you are you a child of god anybody am i i am a child of god because i made myself a child of god no because he knew me before the foundation of the world he says not to that only which is of the law but to that also which is of the faith of abraham who is the father of us all the father of faith not to the natural seed but to the spiritual seed paul begins to unveil this he said i thought i was doing this because i thought it was part of the law but i realized he goes no it's to the faith seat of abraham this gospel he had turned his eyes from israel like joseph who put his wife aside so he could redeem his brothers but he had married a someone outside of the jewish family because god rich in mercy reached down to a gentile people you and i and extended his love and mercy to us he says be but to that also which is of the faith of abraham who is the father to what how god dealt with abraham was by revelation they go back to the beginning how abel pleased god by revelation and cain did not please god because cain tried it by works but you and i can look at it and works usually looks prettier than faith a lot of effort a lot of try god has to be pleased with this i've given my all for this but that doesn't please god you give your all for him because you love him not to try to get points from god it is by grace it is by faith then we'll go from verse 18. who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be speaking of abraham here who against hope believed in hope but it had to become a revelation to abraham we know the story of abraham you can read it through the book of genesis and going through and the many many instances are referred to in the scriptures abraham listened to sarah when she said go to my handmaid and maybe this is what god meant brother branham says it this way every day he would ask sarah how you feeling sarah and sarah i say no different in fact i'm getting older i just had another birthday abraham i'm i'm closer to this side than i was to that side and and brother bam says but abraham was saying praise god we're going to have it anyhow the scripture says abraham staggered not at the promise of god it also says that he went to and had a child from god knew that god didn't scratch and said what do i do now it was all part of what god's plans were i love that the scripture shows both sides of the story or we'd have this image of how unperfect we are and how perfect they were and we'll never reach that i love that brother branham would tell things about himself in this message his failures and everything did not elevate himself above humans i'm better than you you got to be like me no he would talk about the grace of god in his life talked about his upbringing and all if we're looking at ourselves we're no better than anybody but if you look at with the word and you take that for you then you have the king of kings and lord of lords on your side more than all the battalions and the armies of this world way more than that one that can do is head over all of that he's my lord there is no other he is my father he knows me by name he talks to me we we walk together we adam adam eve come on let's what a time i don't know if he ever stopped and just said how was it with her what was it like to be in the garden perfect temperature everything just right just you're already kind of going like uh yeah because we don't really know that yet but it was though until unbelief got in there next verse and being not weak in faith and again i'm taking i'm taking the word revelation putting it in there standing in the revelation of what god said not looking at yourself but what god said god says i am well god says i am whole god says i am saved god says i'm pure god says i'm clean. therefore i'm going to stand on it he considered not his own body now dead when he was about a hundred years old neither yet the deadness of sarah's womb i wonder if the bible doesn't tell us but when friends would come by people would come by his place there i'm sure after a while everybody knew that's abraham over there walk through it go through it and abraham had come by maybe maybe some people that would go to this part of the country and then come back on the way maybe they spent the night there they rested there abraham how's it going he goes the last time i hear you told me you and sarah were going to have a child how's sarah doing sarah comes out looks so different she looks a little bit older maybe a little bit more loud abraham staggered not at the promise of god next year when you come by we're going to be holding this little baby of horse next year they came by and abraham was a year older in serbs but he staggered not at the promise of god you have to stand that same place lord i'm not looking at myself i'm not looking at the deadness of this body i'm looking at what your promise says and we'll stand on that let's go on verse 20. he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief he did not deny the revelation that god gave him he never said lord you must have been wrong i misunderstood i'm not too sure if this really works hey he was human he was flesh so are you so and i but i want to stay true to the word of god but was strong in faith giving glory to god and being fairly fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform when you get to thinking and feeling a little bit like god are you able go out and look what he said the sun will rise and set and it has since it was created begin to see what god has done look back at your own life and see what god has done for you that's the best evidence to yourself lord that was you lord that was you lord that was you i'm here today because that was you and you stand on that that's what abraham was doing he staggered not at the promise of god brother aaron you weren't there you didn't see whether he staggered or not i'm going to take what god's word said because that's how i have to apply it to my life you know lord now i lay me down to sleep you know a simple good night prayer i'm going to bed and we laugh about it sometimes there's some people won't even do that could you do at least a little bit that much get started it's the end of the day i'm so tired and weird i just cast myself and i go to sleep and i don't even talk to him don't even how about just the simplicity of taking god at his word verse 21 22 and therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness have you considered my servant job why because job laid a sacrifice every morning and god looked at the sacrifice and he tells satan have you considered my servant job there is nobody like him he's perfect he's complete he's whole and saying goes give me a chance adam we'll see what we can do god would not have said that about job to satan if he knew job couldn't stand and god would not say that to you about you or to anybody else about you because he knows you will stand because he's in you he says now it was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed to him it's going but for us also to whom it shall be imputed if we believe on him that raise up jesus christ our lord from the dead who was delivered for our offenses and was raised again for our justification if we believe if you realize your name was on that book he knew me yet he loved me he whose glory makes the heavens shine i'm so unworthy i'm not standing here in my own i'm standing on what he said go to my house or sit down with my girls and my wife and they can tell things about me yeah dad said this and this but dad did this and this dad promised when we were but this didn't happen hey i understand that but god's word never fails a host of heavenly witnesses could come back to dante no his word does not fail and and paul says that in hebrews there is a host of heavenly beckoning us on he is faithful he is true he does not fail consider that set aside everything else that so does easily beset you and you know who besets me the most it's not her it's not them it's me set that one aside he's the one that gives me all my problems i praise i'm not giving you the problems but me saying lord help bow my unbelief lord give me strength let me realize let me have that revelation that you're with me you'll never leave me you'll never forsake me that which you have said about me will come to pass again who was delivered for offenses and ways was raised up again for our justification just as you had never done it that's kind of hard to to because in our memories we'll go back we'll go back but lord i failed you here lord i failed you here lord i did this i got upset again i did this again i did that again but he was raised for our justification brother juan would sing that psalm for us justified i've really never done it in the first place oh in your mind you did but if you take it to god and he brings up the screen the screen is blank he became me so that i through faith could become him not my own righteousness but what he's done what he did faith is a revelation faith is when it becomes real to you and you can stand on it though god slay me yet i will trust him with these eyes i shall behold him can you say that same thing today can you honestly say that same thing to you can you believe what you're saying god your word says that therefore you saw me there already and i'll stand on that and i'll believe that the musicians would come open my eyes lord i want to see jesus open my eyes to what your word says open the eyes of my heart lord let it receive let it become you are what you eat as you eat the nutritious food of his word it begins to build the word of god inside of you when you feast on the nutritious unnutritious food of your thoughts and feelings sometimes it begins to destroy you but when you take god at his word you say yes lord i believe and sometimes help my unbelief lord we they can just be words but words do have an effect you chose to use words you could have just used pictures and reveal things out in the sky for us to see and all and you've done many things like that but you chose to speak words you said let there be and there was and you have to believe you had to believe your own word and rest on it we don't know the amount of time because we measure things in time lord when you first spoke let there be and there was lord let us have that same faith that a mustard seed faith pure unadulterated that takes you at your word and stands on it and say let there be let this word be born in the manger of my heart let it bring forth that which it is it's our
