study in the book of Acts tonight we'll consider chapter 16. I was going to do the whole chapter but I realize that Paul and Silas sang at midnight I didn't want to keep you that warm so we're just going to do the first part of Acts tonight and God willing Wednesday night will do the second part so having said that let's get started but before we open our Bibles let's pray once more Lord Jesus we count it such an honor it's such a privilege that we can stand here in this day that we can open your word and freely read it and that Lord your spirit can be present to help us not just understand it but to apply it in our lives lord it's not just history it's not just this or that it's not tales that we're made up but lord it's there for our instruction our reproof our growth Lord to help us draw closer to you and we know that we draw closer to you when we draw closer to one another because you said that by this will all men know that you're my disciples Lord I pray that you would help me Lord to just get my thoughts out of the way Lord I get so many ideas and things but Lord that it just be your thoughts the words that you want spoken this evening and Lord if I misstate something let everyone that hears it hear it the way that it's intended hear it the way that you want it to be heard Lord we commit the remainder of this service into your hands and again we thank you for this awesome privilege in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen acts 16 is the start of what we commonly refer to as Paul's second missionary journey but that Journey really starts in Acts 15 starting at the 36th verse as brother Daniel shared last Wednesday evening acts 15 is primarily about a conflict an argument over Doctrine and how do we apply this and and what's going on here anyway it's about if and how to apply a portion of the Bible of their day what we call the Old Testament to Gentile converts to christianities Christianity was considered a branch or a sect of Judaism so the question becomes so our new Gentile Believers required to become Jewish in order to become Christians if so why if not why not and if not are there any basic foundational rules that they were required to observe other than acceptance of Jesus as their savior well bleach we review this this evening but let's start our study with Acts 15. beginning at verse 36. after some days now we learned in Acts 15 about this letter from Jerusalem and after some days after this had been settled realizing that these doctrines and the people that were spreading them didn't just go to Antioch but they might have gone to other places and got things stirred up so Paul turned to Barnabas the fellow that he had traveled with for a couple of years not too long before this and said let's go again visit our brethren in every city every city where we have preached the word of the Lord and see how they do in other words barnabasas let's retrace our journey let's make sure that all is well and Barnabas agreed his heart was with Paul in this he shared the concerns he wanted the decision of the Jerusalem Council to reach those places as before Barnabas was determined to take with them his relative John whose surname was Mark Paul had a different idea Paul thought it not good to take John Mark with them why why because John Mark was he who had from them on their previous after they completed the work of evangelism across the entire island of Cyprus and sailed to the mainland of what we now call Turkey a town called Italia not Italy but Italia was the name of a port city and John Mark decided that he was going to go home to Jerusalem so he got on a boat went to Jerusalem and Paul and Barnabas then went on to the work in freudia and galatia and so forth and and met a lot of opposition so he didn't go with them and Paul wasn't very happy about that we read that the contention the disagreement the argument the Discord was so sharp between Paul and Barnabas that they departed a Sunder one from the other they separated from each other on this journey the burden of which was to revisit every city so Barnabas took mark and sailed to Cyprus that's where John Mark had worked with them when Barnabas it's where Barnabas was from to see the converts there to share and strengthen and encourage the Christians on the island please be seated there there's a huge point I think to be made right here and I think it's one that's often overlooked maybe one that we don't really realize but if you take home nothing this evening with this please take this home it sometimes pointed out that here in verse 39 that that's the last mention of Barnabas in the book of Acts he's kind of treated dismissively well so long Barnabas thanks a lot but we're moving on too bad for you let me ask you a question do we dismiss Peter from The ongoing work of spreading the gospel put him in the same place that we might put Barnabas no why not Barnabas last mentioned here is acts 15 verse 39. it's the end of an argument where Paul and Barnabas are are disagreeing about a traveling companion the last mention of Peter in the book of Acts 32 verses prior to this acts 15 verse 7. so if we're going to dismiss Barnabas at verse 39 we need to just miss Peter at verse 7. but we don't do that there's something else going on here we note that most of the Apostles are never mentioned by name what do we know of Bartholomew what about Thomas after his confession that Jesus is Lord what do you know about Simon the Zeller or Matthew or or Thaddeus aren't they among the apostles Yep they're never mentioned by name in the book of Acts this fact of no further mention is not some form of judgment we're told Luke told us Barnabas was a good man that he was filled with the Holy Spirit Paul recognized this he and Barnabas made a good team they stuck together when Paul was going down to Jerusalem after his background in the history of being not very friendly to the church they didn't want to talk to him they were afraid of them Barnabas stood up for him Barnabas made the introduction Barnabas brought them together so does the fact that they had an argument about a traveling companion mean that Barnabas was somehow a bad guy does it mean he was no longer a good man but somehow the Holy Spirit was drained out of him he was useless to the gospel convert to some satanic cult I think that we can be sure that in spite of this disagreement with Paul Barnabas continued the work of spreading the gospel strengthening the communities of Believers in fact on the journey that Paul's now going to take he said he turned to Barnabas and said let's visit every City where we have previously preached so this was the burden that Paul confided to Barnabas and we'll find out Paul didn't go to Cyprus but it wasn't because they were unimportant or dismissive it's because he trusted Barnabas to carry on that burden in the island of Cyprus while he went to the other churches that they had gone to they split the task they didn't divide us under and hate each other and that was the end and they never spoke to each other again they split the task over this disagreement I don't think Paul lost confidence in Barnabas I think that we have to understand that these are true stories these were about real people Paul is not perfect neither is Barnabas neither is John Mark but they have likes and dislikes they have biases they have feelings they have high points and low points arguments pain Pride stubbornness Family Ties they're just like me they're just like me I I can tell you a little personal story here that I I will it's not spiritual but it might help illustrate the point when we're remodeling the house a couple of years ago there was a fellow that came in that was a framer and he and Heather started talking and it turned out that they'd both been involved in some Evangelistic work in Europe in the 1960s when they were kids and this guy knew this other guy that lives in the White Mountains and and cuts down trees and makes stuff and he wanted to go with us to the White Mountains to this guy so he could make these Shaggy Juniper mantels that we have in our house now and I thought yeah I don't want to travel with this guy I felt a little bit like maybe Paul felt about John Mark you know so I I was determined that I'm not going to ride for hours this guy's going to talk my ear off and I can't understand no this is not going to happen so instead we went a few weeks after this we went to Dallas Texas to the funeral of of Alan Hawkinson and then from there we it was it was June and we went up into the white not the White Mountains but the Colorado Rockies thought well let's cool off a little on the way home well no sooner had we gotten to Colorado Springs then the air conditioning died in the car oops so Heather and I looked at each other and said well okay When We Were Young we couldn't afford air conditioning let's be young again so we rolled down the windows and we had to drive them from Colorado Springs to Tucson Arizona in the you know late June early July warmth and on the way of course we passed through the White Mountains and so we were able to get the desire of Heather's heart to get these mantles made and see this guy and I didn't have to travel with them getting back to Acts verse 40. so what happens now Barnabas is on his way to Cyprus take care of business there Paul chose Silas who was Silas we read that he was a prophet from Jerusalem he remained an Antioch with the other brothers from Jerusalem when they had returned after they brought this this message this letter from James and the folks in Jerusalem and departed to places other than Cyprus being recommended being committed by the Brethren under the grace of God and and realize when you see the word brethren in the New Testament the Greek word there is non-gender specific it doesn't mean the brothers it's the brothers and sisters it's it's it's it's an inclusive term it's not gender confused it's just non-gender okay under the grace of God and that's what I want to be I want to be committed by God's grace by my siblings in Christ just like what happened this morning and he and Silas went Overland through Syria and cilicia which included tarsus's Hometown confirming that means re-establishing strengthening the churches just a little reminder I know this is a little hard to see the further back you sit the harder it is to see I'm going to keep making these smaller and smaller but this is this is what the first missionary journey was like and here's where they sailed down to Cyprus they covered Cyprus they got here and John Mark went back but these are the places they want to visit and these places in galatia and forget are places that they want to visit that's what's on Paul's heart so now we read that he went through cilicia and over here to galatia right so let me find my place in my notes because I keep getting confused okay so that's just a brief recap of the first journey here's an overview of what's going to be happening on the second Journey what I've done here is I've labeled a lot of modern countries around here so you can get a little perspective about where this really is this journey is going to take place inside of this rectangle here and we're just going to cover a little bit of it here this evening you'll notice again that Paul and Silas don't go to Cyprus whether the LED comes on or not they still don't go there so uh as we do the journey I'll have the maps zoomed in so even you in the back will be able to see it it's okay you don't have to sit on the front I like it when you do but you don't have to so we go on now to Acts 16. and chapter one then came he it says but that's Paul and Silas to Derby and lystra which you memorized from that map earlier there in galatia it's in the province of galatia behold we read a certain disciple was there this is one who had accepted the gospel on Paul and Barnabas previous Journey his name was timothius or Timothy and says he was a son of a certain woman well yeah I think we're all Sons and Daughters of a certain woman or our mother right this one happened to be named Eunice and we'll read that she was a Jewish she was she was a a Jewish woman and and came to Faith In Jesus when Paul and Barnabas ministered in this area and believed but however his father was a Greek Greek speaking non-jewish so this Timothy was well reported by the Believers the Brethren that were in lystra and Iconium which is there in galatia so him Timothy would Paul have go forth on the journey with himself and Silas he said let's let's add a third guy here so Paul took and circumcised Timothy because of the Jews that were in those quarters for they all knew his father was a Greek now in light of the decree from Jerusalem this act was not required but for the sake of the Jewish people they might encounter on their mission including the Jewish believers Timothy was circumcised as brother Daniel pointed out it was for the sake of the ministry not for the sake of Timothy's salvation as they it's now Paul Silas Timothy went through the cities they delivered to them that the Believers in the cities that they went through the decrees the ordinances the the four things that were in the letter to be observed by the non-jewish Believers that were determined by the apostles and Elders which are in Jerusalem which we studied in Acts 15. so here's here's another map this is where they started acts 15 verse 40 from Antioch they went over Atlanta through Syria and through Silesia and they came here into galatia to to Derby and Iconium where the other big Arrow was pointing there it went through his hometown of Tarsus we don't know there may be other places in galatia besides lystra and Derby that they visited we don't know that it doesn't say they only visited there but it doesn't say where else they may have visited but we are told they went throughout galatia so it's quite possible that they went to more places than that so just as a reminder what was in the decree from the council at Jerusalem what was the result of all the discussions that they had the whole uproar the whole contention and confusion about whether or not Gentile converts to Christianity were required to become proselytes to Judaism if so then that requires male circumcision and a whole raft of rules and regulations something over 600 yeah um I I find it interesting that they talked about this is what Moses commanded and I don't have a slide about this but but but it in the books that we attribute to Moses the pentateuch the first five books we find in Genesis 17 verse 11 and that area where God told Abraham about circumcision and made it a covenant the Hebrew word for Covenant is Brit when an eight-day-old male Jewish child is brought for this procedure it's called a Brit it's called a covenant they don't call it a circumcision it's called Covenant but we find the only other place that Moses really mentions about this is something as a requirement is in Leviticus chapter 12. but in Exodus chapter 4. Moses has had this Burning Bush experience God's told him go down to Egypt he takes his wife his son they get on a donkey he grabs his stick starts heading down to take over Egypt and on the way he comes to an end and it says God tried to kill him tried to kill him he just sent him there why would he try to kill him well it turned out that his son wasn't circumcised Moses wasn't obeying the rules so so Moses wife circumcised him and through which she cut off down at his feet and said something not particularly nice to him and at that point God stepped back and said okay now you can go the next interesting point I find about this is in Joshua chapter 5. and what happens they've gone 40 years in the wilderness they've had Manna come down and I think that just speaks to the grace of God because when they cross the River Jordan and they're over on the other side now and they're ready to start the conquest they have to stop why do they have to stop because they have to circumcise all the male children that were born in that entire 40 years not one was circumcised Moses did not enforce that rule with his own kids he didn't enforce it with the children of Israel though he wrote down that if you don't do this you're cut off it's Grace it's Grace we all have quirks we all have peculiarities we all have personalities and God has Grace for us well let's review this letter now from James acts 15 verse 28 it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us not to burden you with anything beyond the following requirements so they put four rules down here you to abstain from food sacrifice to idols okay from blood okay from the meat of strangled animals okay from sexual immorality you will do well to avoid these things that's still true today farewell he says so part of the reason for these rules was based on God's commands to Noah After the flood recalled back in the garden Adam and Eve had one rule and they broke it After the flood God tells Noah okay populate the Earth be fruitful and multiply but I got one rule I've got one rule and and that rule uh will read in Genesis 9 verse 3. it says every moving thing that lives shall be meat for you food there's no Kosher rules here even as the green herb I've given you all things but flesh with the life thereof which is the blood thereof shall you not eat so black sausage no okay foods that are strangled what's the problem there the blood is still in the meat don't eat it so it's avoid blood and this is the Only Rule but it's a rule to all mankind Noah wasn't Jewish Noah predated that by several Generations that's a rule from a Judaism from a Jewish perspective all people are subject to this rule Jew Gentile doesn't matter you're subject to that rule God made that rule for everybody after after the the After the flood so that's why you want to be sure that you obey those two rules what about these next two the rule about food offered to Idols is because if you're partaking in that the assumption is that you're a pagan and you're worshiping those idols and if you're doing that well you're not worshiping the god of Israel so you're probably not going to get into a synagogue and the same thing Pagan worship is Rife with sexual activity with wild abandoned so that sort of thing also suggests that you are a pagan you are not a God-fearing person and if we read a little further with what says here what James said you know wherefore my sentences we trouble them not which from among the Gentiles are turned to God but we write unto them that they abstain from pollutions of Idols from fornication things strangled in from blood and and the next verse is interesting verse 21 for Moses of old time hath in every city then that preach him being read in the synagogues every Sabbath day that seems a little curious that that would be tacked on here or for because consider the only place that a Christian in the first century especially the first half of it is going to be able to hear the word faith comes by hearing the word is in a Jewish synagogue that's the only place that the word is being read there are no churches there are no Bibles there are none of these things people are are not illiterate because illiterate means you're expected to be able to read but can't but societies were non-literate you weren't expected to be able to read and part of that was because books didn't exist in schools were incredibly expensive codices were only starting to come into existence which is an early form of a book so there were no Bibles the only way you're going to hear the word of God as an early Christian is in a Jewish synagogue you want to get to the door of the synagogue abstain from blood don't eat meat sacrificed Idols Etc this is a way for you to hear the word and grow your faith that's the reason that James is saying for these particular uh particular things so as a God-fearing Gentile you're welcome if you if you observe these things well let's uh let's get back to Acts 16. so we read on that these three guys are traveling and so were the churches the Ecclesia the called out ones the Believers in other words they're holding house meetings for the most part as I say there were no church buildings so they were established in the faith and increased and numbered daily how does a body of Believers grow how do they increase in numbers by being Witnesses for Christ in your life your actions as well as not only but as well as your words so now when Dave Paul Silas and Timothy had gone throughout forgive and the region of galatia were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia now you may find this a little hard to believe I found a little hard to believe what people have insisted to be that it's true that some people take that first and say we should not witness to Japanese people we should not witness to Chinese people we should not witness to Korean people because Holy Ghost forbade them to go to Asia it's not talking about what we think of as age it's talking about a little chunk of Western turkey and we'll find out in Acts 19 that Paul goes to Asia in Acts 19. he's not forbidden anymore he spends more than two years there so so you have to be careful when you read these things to understand the context and what's really being said so they forbidden to to go to Asia why why would it say that because when you leave fergia you're stepping into Asia so are you going to go all through here no okay we'll avoid it go around the edge of it or something and so what do we read after they were come to my Sia going around the northern part of Asia there they are saved to go they decided Well let's go to bithynia we're right here Spirit suffered them not he had another path in mind for them at this time if your heart's right you start to go with the Lord us that wants you to go with that time he'll guide you he'll guide you I'm not talking about then I'm talking about now Paul and his group had a right heart they were saying they were wanting they were trying to do the right thing the Lord had laid on their heart to do this Paul had this burden but sensitive to the nudging of the spirit they were kept on the path the Lord desired for them and I'm sure he's thinking huh I visited all those places Barnabas has visited those places in Cyprus that was my burden now what am I doing here what do you want Lord you don't I'm not letting me what after passing by myself they came down to trollas Metro last is just a town it's a place where Luke will see will join them we don't know how long they were there waiting on the guidance of the Lord they might have just got there yesterday and leave tomorrow they might have been there for days or weeks or months we simply don't know well getting back to maps because I like Maps so we see this shows a very direct path they want to go to Asia the Lord says uh uh well let's go to bithynia no well now we wind up over here in trois and what are we going to do well I should probably tell you another little personal story here when I was 13 years old I was in the eighth grade and uh I was in public school and I was a nerd we didn't use that term then but that's what I was and I had some good friends that were also nerds and what we got permission from our our homeloom teacher in those days we didn't have Google and all this kind of stuff you know if you go to a gas station and those days and you ask a guy from after you get a map of the state you get a map of the city that there are these paper things you unfold and I have pictures that look something like that that's what a map is for those of you that are young so we had by the Blackboard in the school we had these big things like window shades I don't know they're not blinds there are things that you pull down and roll up these big window shade things that were Maps one of them was of North America one of them was of Europe one of them was of the world and we got permission from the teacher that during recess when other 13 year olds were going out doing whatever 13 year olds do at recess we went into the room we pulled down a map and we started a game and the person one guy was one individual was chosen and look at the map and you've got so many seconds to identify something on the map and then State what that is and the other guys have to find it and as you find it within the certain number of seconds then you get to choose and if you don't then he says it's right here and then and then pick the next one so I spent my recesses during the Spring of of that year uh playing with maps and and I I was a nerd I admit I was a nerd yeah but but you know later in life my job required that I traveled the world and it turned out that I would go to a country and and and and people think of the Ugly American all arrogant and demanding this and nothing is good enough but I knew the geography of their country and I could we they could talk about something oh you mean that whatever that town is up by the mountains of so and so and and they look at me like are you sure you're an American and and and I was able to build Bridges to these people and have really good relationships I've had people you know talk to me and say before I left that mine because I was in the mining business that you've changed our opinion about Americans I'd like to change their opinion about Jesus Christ that's what our business is so will you see me with maps up here now you know a little bit of the background about why brother Lyle is so weird about Maps one thing I want you to notice on this map is there's this area over here this purple area it's called Macedonia and this little uh whatever color that is kind of pale orange Peach maybe I don't know it's called Ikea and that's Greece okay so we'll just keep that in mind Macedonia agrees okay and let's move on to the next verse so so while he's intro ass a vision appeared to Paul in the night now in the vision there's sort of man of Macedonia remember that purple area we just looked at and prayed him saying come over to Macedonia and help us Macedonia this is like going from the frying pan Into the Fire Macedonia recall the long battle in the Jewish homeland with what we call hellenization the greek influence Alexander the Great came through conquered the place he wanted everybody to speak Greek introduce Greek culture introduce Greek philosophy introduce Greek religion get everybody to to marry between everybody and just make every the world one great big Hellenistic Wonderland so this whole influence of Hellenism it's what led uh uh Antiochus the four Epiphany to sacrifice have the pig sacrificed in the Jerusalem Temple that led to the maccabean Revolt we we've talked about some of these things in the past but but but the thing that a lot of people may not realize is Alexander the Great was not a Greek we think of him as being a Greek he was Macedonian he conquered Greece so going into Macedonia into the very heart of hellenization and that's where this guy is saying come and help us Macedonia so after Paul had seen the vision immediately we who noticed the weed Luke has now joined them ever how long they were an intro ass I don't know if they went there to get Luke I don't know if the Lord sent him there to get Luke if Luke arrived there don't have any idea but Paul Silas Timothy and now the physician Luke are all four together so they endeavored to go into Macedonia they saw it passage you could March around but it's a really long way around much faster to take a boat assuredly Gathering assuredly Gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them and they needed that confidence because they were going to run into some really serious issues and if you were into really serious issues and you're not sure the Lord has sent you there it adds a certain degree of stress to those kinds of situations we also see that Luke isn't just an after-the-fact historian when he wrote the Gospel that's after the fact he's talking to people but now he's a participant he's right there front and center therefore due to this urgency losing from troas we came with a straight course to the island of samothracia and after spending the night there we proceeded the next day to theopolis which is the nearest Port City in Macedonia you memorize that from the map I know and from that's from neapolis we preceded the short distance five or six miles to Philippi which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia and a colony colony and we were in that City abiding certain days of several days oh there's a map again brother while so from Troast to Philippi they go to this little island here called semothrese spend the night then they sail here to that little thing that you can't read which is Theophilus and then they walk to that next Little Dot which is Philippi so it took a couple of days but what is this about a colony what is this about Philippi why would they go there it's the nearest town to troas so that apparently is the way the Lord wants them to go the nearest uh big settlement there in Macedonia the Roman Empire consisted of many conquered lands in many cases the existing political structure was left in place like Herod the Great King of Judea the Romans propped him up but he ran the place sent money to Rome they were happy after he died things kind of fell apart they didn't like it so they put their thumb on it turned it into provinces and sent Governors over there to run it but in many cases they just wanted to not have to be so involved just don't fight us don't give us a hard time send us money that's not enough send us more money okay so the purpose of a colony was to have a place it's Roman territory much like today an embassy in a different country is considered to be the territory of the country whose Embassy that is so you have a colony it's Roman territory it's inhabited by people then that are fiercely loyal to Rome it would typically consist of soldiers who had completed their military service of 30 or more years were Roman citizens and they were awarded land in this colony this established a loyal Force willing to take up arms again for the Empire if called upon and their very presence would intimidate anybody that had other ideas so typically The Colony would have about 30 percent of the population as Roman citizens the other 70 percent would not be Roman citizens they'd be service providers peasant Farmers slaves people just needed to keep the place going the colony of Philippi in the first century had an estimated population of ten thousand roughly might have been as much as fifteen thousand but probably not this early in it the first military retirees that established that Colony were awarded the land there about 80 years before Paul and Silas arrived so they in their descendants would comprise a significant minority and would have been very influential this all contributes to the stability of the Empire the the pox Romana the the Peace of Rome now the artists rendering here and I'm sure you can tell that from the photograph the artist running of ancient Philippi is a possible appearance of the city in the first century the photograph is how the general area of the archaeological site looks today I place arrows to show the location of the form or the amphitheater where public Gatherings would take place this is something that uh significant events will happen in the latter part of Acts which will be Wednesday night God willing there's an image of two sides of a coin up here I I I own this coin it was minted in Philippi sometime between 30 BC and 20 or so A.D so there's a picture of two sides of a coin that was in circulation in this colony in this city at the time that we're reading about right here in the book of Acts in Philippi it appears that the Jewish population was Tiny why do we think this let's go back to acts 16 and verse 13. it says here that on the Sabbath we went to the local synagogue as was our customary practice no doesn't say that it says they went out of the city by a Riverside why where prayer was want to be made was likely or regularly or often made and we sat down and speaking to the women which resorted to their that's a little curious well here's a satellite viewer an aerial view of the same thing again I've pointed out the amphitheater there's this River and you can see the upper Arrow up there is where the river goes and it and it shows that it's it's a baptism site so we have to ask a question why didn't they go to a synagogue what's up with that who are these women and and why were they there on the Sabbath where these ladies the was this a reformed Jewish synagogue and these ladies were the rabbis probably not the most likely answer according to the early Jewish sources is that there was no synagogue in Philippi now the reason's not known but but the mishnah indicates that for a synagogue to form there has to be a minimum of 10 Jewish men Excuse me while I become a first century Jew the lack of the synagogue suggests the population that observed Judaism was very small Philip had only been founded some 80 years earlier as a Roman Colony there would have been no historical reason for a Jewish presence so just like we often see in our churches today there were more women that wanted to participate in worship of God than men at least in Philippi so Paul and his group went to the place where they discovered prayers were offered on the Sabbath and began to speak with the people there in this case they were either only or perhaps predominantly women everybody see the river down here oh there's a beautiful young woman here by the river hi there oh wait a second it's number one first century so it's number one did I cover for that calf okay okay that's good so I'm new in town I see you and several others are gathered here by the river why is that we're here to worship our God we're here to worship I don't I don't see any temples or shrines around here how how how is that possible what God are you praying to the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob but there's no there's no Temple or anything for here Abraham Isaac and Jacob shouldn't there be a synagogue or something here then Philippi is a pretty New Colony there hasn't been time to build one I see well I have to tell you in case you haven't figured out that me and my companions who are Jews we also worship that same God are you Jewish I'm from thyatara and I have a business here dying and selling purple huh so you're from thyatar you worship the god of the Jewish thyatyr is a long way from here by the way my name's Paul and I my name is Lydia Lydia Lydia from Firestar and you're in the business of selling purple that's a pretty beautiful pretty beautiful cloth you have here that's really really nice is that did you figure out how to do that I developed this special die that it doesn't fade easily in the sun whoa I've got I've got to get some of that I I'd like to buy that cloth from you can I get a Sabbath's discount [Applause] we don't generally sell cloth on the Sabbath but for you I can make an exception well that's very very kind of you lady like I've got I've got some Jefferson money here would this be enough to purchase that cloth from you yes deal you drive a hard bargain Lydia from Playa Tyra thank you [Applause] I'm going to keep it Heather and you can keep that money Lydia that's that's for you we had a deal well did the facts that his audience was largely female stop or even slow Paul down was he somehow less respectful or less concerned not at all we often get it in our heads that just because someone has a different role in life than we might have that that one is better or more important or something or other but like brother Daniel talked about this morning about a jigsaw puzzle you have to have every piece if any piece is missing opposal is not complete so every piece is just as important as every other I think we have to keep that in mind when we're when we're talking with people dealing with people because we're talking about the body of Christ every piece is as important as every other there's no big eyes and little use so we read here that a certain woman named Lydia a seller of purple we we just met her a seller of purple dyed cloth it was very expensive in those days dyes came from natural sources snails shellfish fruits berries and so forth Lydia was an industrious worker she was a successful Merchant she was of the city of fire retira which worshiped God and heard us huh oh another map must be brother Lyle this map shows a different possible route going looping up here through galatia we simply don't know I wanted to point out that we don't know those specific routes that they took but more importantly this shows a region and the area of Asia a region of Lydia and it's even marked in purple imagine that it's kind of like a county within a state if you will and and thyatira is this little red dot right there in uh in Asia in this region of of of Lydia now we don't know if Lydia was of Jewish Heritage or descent she was in a city that lacked a synagogue how did she become a believer in the one true God we simply don't know was she a God-fearing Gentile but we do know that she honored the Sabbath she worshiped God and she listened to what the evangelists spoke with her a certain woman named Lydia a seller of purple of the city of fire attire which worshiped God heard us whose heart Paul's clever words reached no no Silas fire and brimstone preaching no Timothy's gentle persuasion Luke's scholarly teaching no heart the Lord and what was the result that she attended to she listened she understood she accepted she believed he patiently explained the things which were spoken of Paul it reminds me of proverbs 31. I'm sure many of you are familiar with proverbs 31 if you're not you've got a homework assignment proverbs 31. and when she Lydia was baptized you remember the aerial view that I showed you and the arrow of Where the River was there's a shrine a thing that's built there where they believe that this Lydia was baptized at Philip I don't know if she was or she wasn't but the river's there when Lydia was baptized and her household it wasn't just Lydia it wasn't only Lydia I should say she besought us saying if you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord come into my house and abide there okay that that's good they've got a place to stay and they're going to be sharing more and more about the Lord with her her faith is going to get grounded anchored deepened strengthened well I don't know Lydia man she constrained us she kept asking she would not take no for an answer stubbornly steadfastly insisted until we agreed Lydia is an important person in the acts narrative but why it's told we're told that she's from fire Tyra why would Luke mention this he doesn't mention where everybody else was born why would he mention she's from thyatira it's it seems a little puzzling well we know that people from different parts of the world here share certain traits we sometimes speak of a national Spirit right like Americans tend to take things lightly joke around a little bit people from Switzerland tend to be very precise well when John the Revelator was instructed to write letters to the seven churches of Asia each had a certain characteristic these mapped into what we call the church ages if the musicians would please come what were the characteristics then of phiatira Revelation 2 19 Jesus speaking to John says I Know Thy works you're doing something and charity Your Love and your service to one another your faith in the Lord your patience and thy Works he mentions Works twice very industrious and the last to me more than the first do these characteristics seem to apply to this lady praying by the river I think it's pretty clear that they do and these are all characteristics that we should desire to have as Christians in Tucson in 2023 we need to be careful how we view others to have love and respect for each other to be free to serve I'm reminded of a song I don't need you all to help me sing it these folks know that I'm between the Frets on the guitar between the whatever they call thems on the on the thing you blow on and I'm certainly between the keys but the song that I want to sing is thank God I'm free it's written by the Gaithers please help

God it's nice to hear a little bit about her and I really appreciated what brother Lyle had to say and I have to admit I took a picture of brother Lyle with his yamaka on and his Hebrew cloth and I plan on sending that to the other pastors around saying the Tucson Tabernacles changed a little bit God bless you all you're dismissed In The Name Of The Lord so glad I'm yours so glad [Music] your
