[0:00] In John chapter 17, Jesus prays that the
[0:03] disciples would be in such unity that
[0:05] the world would see their unity and know
[0:08] that God sent Jesus Christ to the world.
[0:10] Jesus is asking the father for a church
[0:12] that would produce such love that
[0:14] sinners would come to salvation not
[0:17] through their doctrine necessarily and
[0:19] not necessarily through their music but
[0:21] through the love that they have for each
[0:23] other.
[0:27] Spirit of the church is loving, caring.
[0:31] When I came here, the first smile I saw
[0:33] was actually Sister [music] Heather's.
[0:35] And she welcomed me with a huge hug and
[0:39] I felt welcome and not judged [music] or
[0:42] anything.
[0:43] &gt;&gt; I would say uh loving for sure and
[0:46] accepting. And we don't care what anyone
[0:48] looks like or what your background is,
[0:50] but we just want souls to be saved and
[0:54] them to come to the Lord and have a
[0:55] better life through him.
[0:57] &gt;&gt; My favorite thing about Tucson
[0:59] Tabernacle is the pastor. He has a lot
[1:02] of compassion and love for us. The
[1:04] second is the congregation and you know
[1:07] all the brothers and sisters get
[1:08] together and it's all love. They don't
[1:10] discriminate.
[1:13] I think Tucson Tabernacle is a great
[1:15] place u for someone who is scared of
[1:17] meeting new people. We understand those
[1:19] struggles and those [music] fears and I
[1:21] feel like you always have someone there
[1:22] to shake your hand or greet you and that
[1:25] helps so much to take that nervousness
[1:27] away.
[1:28] &gt;&gt; I value our pastor. He's very special.
[1:32] Has a lot of depth and loves the people.
[1:36] That's for sure. And I value that very
[1:38] much. gone to church all my life since I
[1:41] was born. But coming to Tucson
[1:44] Tabernacle
[1:46] uh changed my outlook as a Christian
[1:49] that a Christianity was not a set of
[1:51] deeds but was a life lived and I found
[1:54] that at the tabernacle that was the
[1:56] emphasis to live a life worthy of the
[1:59] gospel in a sense that others could see
[2:01] Christ in you. It's amazing [music]
[2:04] whenever you you hear the congregation
[2:07] singing and you know you're all just
[2:10] singing to the one creator. You're just
[2:12] singing to Jesus Christ and it's 150
[2:15] whether it's 150 [music] on Sunday
[2:17] morning or 50 people on Wednesday night.
[2:20] It's you get there and the spirit comes
[2:23] down because all of us are singing to
[2:25] one person. It's and that's to Jesus
[2:27] Christ. It's not about me. It's and it's
[2:30] not about the congregation. It's just
[2:32] about Jesus.
[2:33] &gt;&gt; The Tucson Tabernacle is a place of
[2:34] refuge where you can come in, you can
[2:37] feel accepted, you can worship with
[2:39] great music, hear a Bible-based sermon,
[2:42] but it is also a place of ministry. You
[2:45] may be dealing with your own sins, but
[2:46] don't forget the guy next to you. He's
[2:48] dealing with something, too. Come into
[2:50] this church to serve. Not to serve
[2:53] yourself, but to serve others. I promise
[2:55] you'll get what you need, but make it
[2:57] the focus. Make it your focus to serve
[2:59] others. That's the spirit of Christ and
[3:02] that is the Holy [music] Spirit. That's
[3:03] what I want to see in a church. That's
[3:06] what I want to see in the Tucson
[3:07] Tabernacle. And I really think that we
[3:10] are moving in the right direction.
