[40:17] preached here was ringing in my ears for
[40:19] the past few days brother Ryan made a
[40:22] made a comment he said that uh he said
[40:26] when when when you're at a service
[40:28] he said and and the minister says
[40:29] something he says don't automatically
[40:31] think oh it would be it would have been
[40:33] great for this person that's not here
[40:35] right now they should have heard this
[40:37] and and I'm going to send them this
[40:38] video and and and this really you should
[40:41] have been there he said you were
[40:45] there and it was for you and Wednesday
[40:49] night I was thinking so much of you all
[40:51] and I was thinking oh this would have
[40:53] been great for all of you all to hear
[40:56] and and then I was thinking no brother
[40:57] Ryan said don't think that
[41:00] way but it was great and I wish
[41:03] everybody was here what a testimony we
[41:05] heard from um from Brother John Davis
[41:08] from um up in Alaska what just
[41:11] tremendous how the Lord brought him out
[41:13] of alcoholism and and and just crime and
[41:18] and brought him just done did A great
[41:22] miracle in his life if you haven't
[41:24] watched it it's on our website you can
[41:26] go back and you can watch it um I wanted
[41:29] to share a testimony before we get
[41:31] started and before we take up the
[41:32] offering um what happened to me this
[41:36] past week I was um I was down I was uh
[41:41] just a bit overwhelmed with everything
[41:43] that's going on all these decisions that
[41:46] had to be made and um with with the new
[41:49] Courtyards looking beautiful and and uh
[41:52] the um Fellowship Hall and everything
[41:55] that we're going to be doing here and I
[41:57] just felt like like Lord I'm just not
[42:01] measuring up I'm failing in a lot of
[42:02] things I need to do a better job and I
[42:05] got I just got
[42:08] discouraged and you know sometimes you
[42:10] get discouraged and then you start
[42:13] getting kind of a negative
[42:15] attitude and and that's how I started to
[42:17] feel and then I have some other things
[42:19] going on um outside of church that have
[42:22] been a a we on Weighing on me and um I
[42:27] started to just get a little bit more
[42:30] taking an just an attitude that that
[42:33] wasn't quite quite right I usually have
[42:34] a positive attitude I I don't have high
[42:36] highs or low lows I'm just I'm usually
[42:38] pretty steady but I was
[42:42] discouraged and I don't know if it was
[42:45] um
[42:46] Friday or yesterday morning I can't
[42:50] remember when it was could have been
[42:52] even uh
[42:54] Thursday um but I was uh
[42:58] I was just kind of U just kind of down I
[43:01] was kind of thinking thinking on things
[43:03] and all of a sudden immediately I felt
[43:07] this this
[43:10] Rush of like positive
[43:14] energy and and it was this
[43:17] renewed
[43:18] feeling of excitement to the church and
[43:21] excitement to everything that's going on
[43:23] and and saying you we can do this and
[43:26] and and then I started started having
[43:27] these ideas and and it just it felt so
[43:30] good just this real positive attitude
[43:33] and this real strength that entered me
[43:36] and it it stuck with
[43:38] me and I was I was just I was feeling
[43:41] just just great and then yesterday
[43:43] morning Daniel and I went to hear
[43:45] Brother Paul durksen at the Shalom
[43:47] Tabernacle meetings and uh before
[43:50] service I was um just had my Bible open
[43:55] I wasn't reading it
[43:57] but I was just thinking like Lord I feel
[44:00] so good I just feel I feel like you
[44:03] really help
[44:05] me and you know how I am about saying
[44:08] that God said or God told me we have to
[44:11] be careful in doing
[44:13] that however I felt this really
[44:18] strong
[44:20] feeling that God was speaking to me and
[44:22] I felt like he said
[44:25] this as I was as I was thanking the lord
[44:28] for for this change in attitude that I
[44:31] had I felt like the Lord told
[44:33] me somebody prayed for
[44:38] you and I said Lord wow it happened and
[44:45] that very moment I firmly believe that
[44:48] that very M moment that I had a change
[44:51] of attitude and and and this great
[44:53] encouragement I believe there was
[44:54] somebody probably here that was was
[44:57] praying for me and God heard those
[45:01] prayers and it changed me and and it
[45:05] worked and I think thank God thank God
[45:09] that we can pray for each other the Book
[45:11] of James and and I felt led and here's
[45:13] the direction that we're going to move
[45:14] over the next month is we're going to go
[45:17] into the Book of James on Sunday morning
[45:20] and and I'm going to teach word line by
[45:23] line in this book and it's it's a
[45:25] tremendous lesson
[45:27] and and I was just I was feeling just
[45:29] the confidence and moving forward in
[45:31] that and and and believe it's in James
[45:33] chapter 5 the last chapter in James it
[45:36] says the effectual fervent prayer of a
[45:40] righteous man availeth much that
[45:42] righteous man that word man is a generic
[45:45] term for a person so the sisters also
[45:48] it's not it's not gender specific the
[45:50] effectual fervent prayer of a righteous
[45:53] per person has a great effect and I am a
[45:57] witness to that brothers and sisters
[45:59] Somebody Prayed for me and I felt the
[46:04] the success it availed much and that's
[46:08] how we should be for each other the
[46:10] effectual for our prayers for each other
[46:14] they work don't be discouraged in
[46:16] praying for one another don't be
[46:18] discouraged in lifting one another up
[46:20] because it works pray for your friends
[46:22] pray for your friends family those that
[46:24] are going through a hard time pray for
[46:26] them it worked for me I am the recipient
[46:30] and it will work for you I firmly
[46:34] believe that I wanted to share that with
[46:37] the church knowing
[46:44] yes I Promise
[46:48] You by the word of God God hears your
[46:53] prayers and they make a difference
[47:02] Sister Sarah Z
[47:05] brenon she says this please pray for my
[47:08] boss and his family my boss lost his son
[47:12] on Friday due to a motorcycle
[47:15] accident that's uh can only

[58:09] now Lord we want to just approach your
[58:11] word Lord as a as Lord a group of
[58:14] Believers that have come together Lord
[58:15] with one purpose Lord I pray and that's
[58:18] to hear from you this morning Lord to
[58:20] have you take just a single word out of
[58:23] your out of your Bible Lord Lord and
[58:26] just open it to our hearts father that's
[58:28] what we want this
[58:31] morning Lord we want to be blessed we
[58:33] want to be touched we want to be healed
[58:35] Lord we want to be saved L Lord we want
[58:37] to hear from you this morning we want to
[58:39] feel your presence and your spirit Among
[58:40] Us Lord and we ask you would just come
[58:43] now in jesus' name
[58:46] amen amen good morning God bless
[58:49] everybody
[58:52] here forgive me this morning just a
[58:54] little uh I I know if the word is
[58:56] nervous but um just had the Lord kind of
[59:01] I believe it was the Lord you know I had
[59:03] a lot of things on my on my plate per se
[59:06] maybe a lot of things on my mind that I
[59:07] wanted to speak about and just have the
[59:10] Lord kind of erase all that
[59:13] yesterday and uh it's a little
[59:16] scary and it's good scary but it's uh
[59:20] it's much easier when you're not
[59:21] standing up here to say that it's good
[59:24] I've heard other ministers tell me you
[59:26] the Lord just kind of you just kind of
[59:28] erased my thought and I'm like oh it's
[59:30] going to be good brother and I believed
[59:31] it at the moment but I know they didn't
[59:34] so and now I find myself in that same
[59:36] place but you know we just I could not I
[59:40] wouldn't be able to drive over here and
[59:41] stand before you if I didn't serve a God
[59:44] that I could
[59:45] trust and I believe that you wouldn't
[59:47] even waste the time to come to church
[59:50] and get dressed up and come over here if
[59:52] you didn't believe in the same God that
[59:53] I believe in and so what I want to do do
[59:56] and I pray what you'll do this morning
[59:57] is that if we can just even more just
[1:00:00] let go and let him have his way this
[1:00:02] morning amen let's just read a scripture
[1:00:05] um I got a scripture I got that much so
[1:00:08] if we can read a scripture I think we're
[1:00:09] doing a good start there Luke
[1:00:12] 16 um and uh we're just going to pray
[1:00:16] that the Lord uh gives us notes and
[1:00:18] gives us what to say this morning I'm
[1:00:19] not a I'm not a preacher um but uh I I
[1:00:23] definitely love the Lord
[1:00:26] amen that's all I know I can do is I can
[1:00:28] love the Lord and we're just going to
[1:00:30] we're just going to turn it over to him
[1:00:32] amen so Luke 16 and
[1:00:35] uh let's
[1:00:38] see I want to
[1:00:40] start with verse
[1:00:43] 10 he says he that is
[1:00:45] faithful in that which is least is
[1:00:49] faithful also in
[1:00:51] much and he that is unjust in the least
[1:00:56] is unjust also in
[1:00:58] much if therefore you have not been
[1:01:02] faithful in the unrighteous Mammon who
[1:01:06] will commit to your trust the true
[1:01:09] riches and if you have not been faithful
[1:01:12] in that which is another
[1:01:14] man's who shall give you that which is
[1:01:16] your
[1:01:18] own and then the verse I wanted to get
[1:01:20] to it says no servant can serve two
[1:01:23] masters for either he will hate hate the
[1:01:26] one and love the other or else he will
[1:01:30] hold to the one and despise the other
[1:01:33] you cannot serve God and Mammon you may
[1:01:38] be
[1:01:39] seated and maybe why this scripture
[1:01:42] stuck out to me I I just want to I'm
[1:01:44] really going to talk to you from my
[1:01:45] heart this morning because I can't talk
[1:01:46] to you from a
[1:01:47] notepad and um so it might be real short
[1:01:50] brother
[1:01:51] Dan it might might I appreciate it I
[1:01:56] know that I know the kids and secretly
[1:01:58] some of the adults get real happy if the
[1:02:00] minister says it's going to be
[1:02:02] short so maybe I could just make you all
[1:02:04] happy by just you know if we just spent
[1:02:06] 15 20 minutes around the word I think
[1:02:09] it's better spent than any other thing
[1:02:11] that I could do I don't know how you
[1:02:13] feel and I feel blessed already that I
[1:02:15] was just able to come in and and be
[1:02:17] under the presence of worship be under
[1:02:20] the presence of of really a god that we
[1:02:22] all love and serve and when we invite
[1:02:24] him with our worship he comes
[1:02:26] and I've already felt him today I've
[1:02:28] already felt him in testimony so if we
[1:02:30] just
[1:02:30] spent just a few minutes around a
[1:02:33] scripture I think it would I think it
[1:02:34] would be beneficial but no more
[1:02:36] beneficial than if he just came right
[1:02:38] now and touched your heart and really
[1:02:40] the preaching of the word is important
[1:02:42] but nothing is as important as God
[1:02:45] himself the person God coming down and
[1:02:49] just revealing to you one single thing
[1:02:52] and I believe that he if he hasn't done
[1:02:54] that for you already I believe he can do
[1:02:55] do that for you right now amen and
[1:02:58] that's the kind of God that I serve you
[1:02:59] know there's no reason
[1:03:01] why that you can't be touched by the
[1:03:04] Holy Ghost right
[1:03:07] now I know that that we talk about it
[1:03:09] all the time and maybe we even strive
[1:03:11] for it maybe we even believe it maybe we
[1:03:13] want it but there's no reason that you
[1:03:17] can't
[1:03:19] have the Holy Ghost right
[1:03:24] now and you might say I already have the
[1:03:26] Holy
[1:03:28] Ghost if you have the Holy Ghost you'll
[1:03:31] want
[1:03:32] more that's right I I never want to have
[1:03:35] the attitude that I've received too much
[1:03:37] from
[1:03:39] God and if you don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:03:42] I I heard this saying and I believe it's
[1:03:43] true you know what the devil does is he
[1:03:46] he convinces those that don't have the
[1:03:49] Holy Ghost that they're
[1:03:53] okay and he convinces those that do have
[1:03:55] the holy ghost that they're not
[1:03:58] okay I don't know where you sit this
[1:04:00] morning right I I think I've been in
[1:04:02] both seats before sometimes in the same
[1:04:05] service sometimes I started off thinking
[1:04:07] that I was not so good and then by the
[1:04:08] end I thought I was good and I don't
[1:04:10] know where I was at but I'm telling you
[1:04:12] when the Holy Ghost comes not just in a
[1:04:14] service it's it's good when we praise
[1:04:16] the Lord amen it's good when we feel his
[1:04:19] anointing around the the sanctuary and
[1:04:21] around the people but there's nothing
[1:04:24] like when it drops down inside your
[1:04:26] heart that's when lives are changed you
[1:04:30] know I feel good when I come into an
[1:04:32] atmosphere of worship but I could walk
[1:04:34] out the same
[1:04:36] person I could walk out even
[1:04:38] worse I could walk out in that
[1:04:40] presentence leave or I leave that
[1:04:42] presence and I haven't taken them with
[1:04:46] me but when that Holy Ghost drops down
[1:04:49] inside I don't even have plan to read
[1:04:51] this scripture but there's a scripture
[1:04:53] it talks about in Acts 10 where Peter
[1:04:56] comes Upon A group of
[1:04:57] Believers you know the Lord had given
[1:05:00] him a vision that that these that these
[1:05:02] Believers even though they were Romans
[1:05:04] that it was good for him to be able to
[1:05:07] go to them and preach the word I don't
[1:05:08] know about you but sometimes I feel just
[1:05:10] like a
[1:05:12] Roman I I don't feel worthy of the
[1:05:15] Gospel I I I read the Bible I read the
[1:05:17] message I don't feel worthy that
[1:05:19] something this good was sent to
[1:05:21] me but God sent a vision to Peter while
[1:05:24] he was just resting in a room that said
[1:05:27] you call now he he showed him a vision
[1:05:30] of animals of food but Peter caught a
[1:05:34] revelation he showed him these visions
[1:05:36] of these food and he said you know we
[1:05:37] don't eat this food as a as a Jewish na
[1:05:39] we don't eat this food and God said what
[1:05:41] you have called unclean I call clean and
[1:05:45] Peter got a revelation later on when the
[1:05:48] Lord sent him to talk to these Romans
[1:05:50] and he said you know normally I wouldn't
[1:05:52] talk to you I wouldn't preach to you
[1:05:55] because you're not worthy but God
[1:05:58] changed my mind is what Peter
[1:06:01] said God changed my mind he goes and he
[1:06:04] confesses to him he doesn't come to him
[1:06:06] to go well just buckle up now I'm going
[1:06:08] to preach to you he starts off with
[1:06:10] saying you know I was
[1:06:12] wrong I thought of you as dirty I
[1:06:15] thought of you as unworthy maybe you
[1:06:17] think of yourself that way I know
[1:06:18] certainly I think of myself that way
[1:06:20] sometimes but God doesn't see you that
[1:06:23] way
[1:06:25] that doesn't sound convincing
[1:06:27] right you say but I see the I see what's
[1:06:31] wrong God has to see what's
[1:06:34] wrong but he doesn't have to see what's
[1:06:37] wrong because he made a way that he
[1:06:40] would never have to see what you've done
[1:06:43] wrong he sent his son right simple
[1:06:47] simple message he sent his son and his
[1:06:49] son died but the purpose was that God
[1:06:52] would never have to look upon you and I
[1:06:56] and see our
[1:06:57] sin and then God gives this Vision over
[1:07:00] to Peter and he says what you call
[1:07:04] unclean I say is
[1:07:06] clean and Peter talking to these Romans
[1:07:08] he says you know I normally wouldn't
[1:07:11] preach to you but I was wrong and the
[1:07:13] Lord revealed to me that what I thought
[1:07:16] was unclean which is you is actually
[1:07:19] clean and worthy of him so now I'm going
[1:07:20] to preach to you the gospel and Peter
[1:07:22] starts to just give them even what we
[1:07:25] heard right now brother brother Dan he
[1:07:27] just starts to give them a testimony he
[1:07:29] doesn't tell them how they got to live
[1:07:31] he doesn't tell them what they're doing
[1:07:33] wrong certainly they were probably doing
[1:07:35] things wrong he doesn't start with that
[1:07:37] you know he starts to tell them well I
[1:07:39] want to tell you about the Lord
[1:07:41] Jesus and he starts to tell them how the
[1:07:43] Lord Jesus was led by the Holy Spirit to
[1:07:46] do this and the Holy Spirit was led by
[1:07:48] this to to perform this miracle and to
[1:07:50] preach this type of message and to save
[1:07:52] the lost and he starts to speak to them
[1:07:54] just a test Tony about
[1:07:57] Jesus you can do exactly that same
[1:08:02] thing you who you might think that
[1:08:05] you're unworthy are actually worthy to
[1:08:07] take the testimony of Jesus to somebody
[1:08:11] and by doing that now Peter's talking to
[1:08:13] them and they're listening they're
[1:08:14] listening to him and um I don't have the
[1:08:16] scripture in front of me because I
[1:08:17] honestly didn't didn't remember I didn't
[1:08:20] plan on reading it I think it's in uh if
[1:08:22] you give me a moment I'm going to find
[1:08:23] it I believe it's in Acts
[1:08:26] when I tell you that I'm I'm going to be
[1:08:28] led of the Lord this morning I want
[1:08:29] really want to be led of the Lord this
[1:08:30] morning I don't have any notes I want to
[1:08:32] just speak to you this morning actually
[1:08:34] I don't want to speak to you at all this
[1:08:35] morning I want to I want to let the Lord
[1:08:38] have his
[1:08:40] way it it's in 10 yeah verse thank you
[1:08:43] so he's talking about these these men
[1:08:45] and he's preaching to them and we get
[1:08:47] all the
[1:08:48] way all the way to the end of the
[1:08:50] chapter I believe
[1:09:06] so he preaches to him for 43
[1:09:10] verses telling them testimonies of Jesus
[1:09:13] Christ telling them testimonies of what
[1:09:14] God did and I love this verse it says in
[1:09:16] 44 it says while Peter yet spake these
[1:09:21] words the Holy Ghost fell upon all of
[1:09:24] them which heard the word amen and I
[1:09:27] love this verse because you know I I've
[1:09:30] heard and I I'll just I just I I'll
[1:09:33] leave this real General because I don't
[1:09:34] want to I don't I'm not picking on
[1:09:35] anybody but I've heard I've heard
[1:09:37] ministers use this scripture to say you
[1:09:40] have to be listening to the minister in
[1:09:43] order to receive the Holy
[1:09:45] Ghost but I love this scripture because
[1:09:47] it says while Peter yet spake and if you
[1:09:50] actually take those words and you find
[1:09:52] out what they mean they that means while
[1:09:54] he was still speaking the Holy Ghost
[1:09:57] fell on those that heard him and I
[1:09:59] almost think of it as even even while he
[1:10:01] was speaking in spite of Peter speaking
[1:10:04] the Holy Ghost fell on those that were
[1:10:06] listening which mean it really had
[1:10:08] nothing to do with Peter but it had to
[1:10:11] do with those that were listening to the
[1:10:14] word and I believe in Ministry I'm not
[1:10:17] up here to tell you that we don't
[1:10:18] believe in a Ministry but really it's
[1:10:21] it's a condition of you it's a condition
[1:10:24] of the heart
[1:10:26] you know we even talk about prayer and
[1:10:28] and I believe that kneeling down to to
[1:10:30] pray I believe that that's a good thing
[1:10:32] I I don't don't come away saying brother
[1:10:34] Ryan said don't kneel down to pray but
[1:10:36] I'm telling you that prayer is not a
[1:10:38] position of your
[1:10:40] body it's not a position that you're in
[1:10:42] I believe that we kneel down and that's
[1:10:44] good but you know what I've been driving
[1:10:46] in my
[1:10:46] car and I've
[1:10:49] prayed I've been standing and I've
[1:10:52] prayed I was sitting in that chair right
[1:10:55] there not 5 minutes ago and I was
[1:10:57] praying prayer is not the position of
[1:11:00] your body it's the condition of your
[1:11:02] heart you know we're told to pray
[1:11:05] without ceasing to pray always well we
[1:11:08] can't function if we have to be down our
[1:11:10] knees right all the time it's because if
[1:11:12] you catch just that little it's it's not
[1:11:15] complicated just that little revelation
[1:11:17] of Lord I always want to be seeking what
[1:11:20] you
[1:11:21] want in every single thing I do even if
[1:11:24] it's just Lord Lord help
[1:11:27] me you know that's a
[1:11:30] prayer now I know what prayers have been
[1:11:32] turned into these these these these kind
[1:11:35] of speeches that we do that have big
[1:11:37] words and that have tone of voice that's
[1:11:40] not a prayer to
[1:11:41] God God wants a heart that is
[1:11:45] hungry he wants a heart that's not just
[1:11:48] hungry that calls out to him in
[1:11:52] desperation and and to God it doesn't
[1:11:55] matter how dirty that heart is when I
[1:11:58] tell you the condition of the heart
[1:11:59] matters I think sometimes we in my mind
[1:12:02] I think okay well I better clean up that
[1:12:03] heart so that heart can be in the
[1:12:06] condition to receive
[1:12:09] God that's not the condition I'm talking
[1:12:12] about it just needs to be
[1:12:15] surrendered you know you can be dirty
[1:12:19] and
[1:12:20] surrendered and God will come
[1:12:24] in and no but but I know what Satan does
[1:12:26] he says no you need to be clean and
[1:12:29] surrendered well then why do you need
[1:12:31] the Holy
[1:12:33] Ghost why do you need the Holy Ghost if
[1:12:35] I can get cleaned up without the Holy
[1:12:37] Ghost and in the Scripture it says if
[1:12:41] you have not been faithful in the
[1:12:43] unrighteous man and how many would just
[1:12:46] say I I don't know if I've been faithful
[1:12:49] in
[1:12:50] everything Lord I think I've been
[1:12:52] unfaithful in a few things
[1:12:56] he's telling you that if you
[1:13:00] have that it's not too
[1:13:03] late and really what the scripture says
[1:13:06] to me I I want to read one more
[1:13:08] scripture over in Deuteronomy but it
[1:13:10] tells
[1:13:11] me that a decision has to be
[1:13:15] made and for you maybe I I don't know
[1:13:19] everybody here um I don't know how long
[1:13:21] that you this might be your first
[1:13:23] service you ever been in church and this
[1:13:25] might be your uh might be your 3,000
[1:13:28] service I don't know I don't know where
[1:13:29] you're at I don't know where everybody's
[1:13:31] at but I know that this morning a
[1:13:33] decision lays before you today amen
[1:13:37] whether you're a veteran of the Gospel
[1:13:39] or whether you just came in right now a
[1:13:42] decision lays before you this morning
[1:13:44] who are you going to
[1:13:47] serve and it doesn't matter what you
[1:13:51] decided
[1:13:53] yesterday that's good it doesn't matter
[1:13:55] what you decided to serve yesterday
[1:13:58] today you have to decide who you're
[1:14:01] going to serve amen and I'll tell you
[1:14:03] why that's the case and you you might
[1:14:05] think well it does matter it does matter
[1:14:07] who I
[1:14:08] decided because I can tell you this that
[1:14:11] there were days that I decided not to
[1:14:13] serve the
[1:14:14] Lord and they don't
[1:14:18] matter there were times yesterday there
[1:14:21] were times years ago there were times
[1:14:23] months ago weeks ago days ago where I
[1:14:25] made the wrong decision and guess what
[1:14:28] today it doesn't
[1:14:31] matter and I want to say the same thing
[1:14:33] if you say you know what I decided that
[1:14:34] I would serve the Lord yesterday that's
[1:14:36] good but today that doesn't matter today
[1:14:39] you have a new decision that lays before
[1:14:42] you it's a daily decision let's go over
[1:14:46] to Deuteronomy verse 30 I had two
[1:14:49] scriptures written down brother Dan so
[1:14:51] I'm going to use them both up right now
[1:14:52] and then we're going to we're really
[1:14:54] going to be in for it just Deuteronomy
[1:14:59] 30:1 it says it's a little bit of a I
[1:15:02] got a few verses if that's okay just
[1:15:03] reading the Bible for this commandment
[1:15:05] which I command thee
[1:15:08] when just a simple Bible reading it's
[1:15:11] I'm not making this up this
[1:15:15] day you you say well this was spoken way
[1:15:18] back in in in Moses's time yes but the
[1:15:20] Bible to me is a Bible of today and so
[1:15:24] when I read this I need to read this the
[1:15:26] right way it says for this commandment
[1:15:27] which I have commanded me this
[1:15:31] day it is not hidden from thee neither
[1:15:34] it is far off what does that mean this
[1:15:37] is not a mystery this is not something
[1:15:39] that he's going to he's going to ask you
[1:15:42] that's hard to
[1:15:44] understand it's not something that you
[1:15:46] need I'm just going to say this you
[1:15:48] don't need me up here explaining it to
[1:15:50] you you don't need a minister up here
[1:15:52] explaining to you that God is is plain
[1:15:56] and clear in the word what he's about to
[1:15:57] tell you this commandment is it is not
[1:16:00] in heaven that thou should say who shall
[1:16:03] go up for us to heaven and bring it unto
[1:16:06] us that we may hear it and do it it's
[1:16:07] not you know I I I think maybe sometimes
[1:16:10] I do this you know I I make something in
[1:16:12] the in the in the in the word so
[1:16:14] mysterious that well I'll believe that
[1:16:17] as soon as it's explained to me the
[1:16:18] right
[1:16:19] way anybody ever thought that maybe not
[1:16:23] that maybe not that flippantly but you
[1:16:24] know you know I just really don't
[1:16:26] understand that so I don't know what to
[1:16:27] do with that as soon Lord as soon as I I
[1:16:30] understand that I'm going to believe
[1:16:31] that or if you can explain it to me but
[1:16:32] he's saying this is not that type of
[1:16:34] commandment he's going to give you it's
[1:16:36] real plain it's real clear and you have
[1:16:38] a clear when I when I tell you that you
[1:16:40] have a decision to make today it's going
[1:16:42] to be the clearest decision possible
[1:16:44] that you can
[1:16:46] make neither is it beyond the sea that
[1:16:50] thou should say who shall go over the
[1:16:51] sea for us and bring it unto us that we
[1:16:53] may hear it and do it but the word this
[1:16:58] is I want to tell you this is the same
[1:17:00] word that Cornelius heard in that
[1:17:03] chapter of Acts when the Holy Ghost fell
[1:17:04] upon him it's that same word to those
[1:17:07] who heard the
[1:17:10] word the word is very nigh unto thee
[1:17:13] it's right here it's right here this
[1:17:16] morning in thy mouth and in thy
[1:17:21] heart that thou mayest do it and this
[1:17:25] scripture it says I have set before you
[1:17:28] this day life and
[1:17:31] good and death and
[1:17:35] evil seems like a pretty black and white
[1:17:38] decision doesn't
[1:17:40] it I mean if we were to be honest that's
[1:17:43] pretty
[1:17:43] easy okay we could do a we could do an
[1:17:47] instant survey right now how many thinks
[1:17:52] it's it's the right thing to choose
[1:17:55] death and evil raise your
[1:17:58] hand awesome that was an easy one so
[1:18:02] it's an easy decision right if I mean we
[1:18:05] can't brother Dan if we asked where
[1:18:07] we're going to go to for lunch we
[1:18:08] wouldn't get that type of
[1:18:10] agreement and now we're talking about
[1:18:12] one of the most important decisions that
[1:18:14] we make and I think we had 100%
[1:18:17] agreement you don't find that anywhere
[1:18:23] right is
[1:18:25] right you don't find that anywhere 100%
[1:18:29] agreement and yet you all just agreed
[1:18:31] with that it's so
[1:18:33] clear and yet when I find in the Bible
[1:18:37] that When God says that you cannot serve
[1:18:41] two
[1:18:42] masters he's not talk if it wasn't
[1:18:45] possible for you to do that it wouldn't
[1:18:47] be in the
[1:18:48] Bible the reason why it's in the Bible
[1:18:50] is because it is possible for us to
[1:18:52] serve two Master it's possible for us to
[1:18:54] to to serve Mammon over God you know
[1:18:57] it's possible and sometimes I don't want
[1:18:59] to use the word likely but sometimes
[1:19:02] it's easy for us to actually choose
[1:19:05] death and
[1:19:06] evil even though we wouldn't raise our
[1:19:09] hand and I didn't raise my hand and yet
[1:19:11] I I can't even tell you how many times
[1:19:13] I've chosen death and evil over life and
[1:19:16] good even though it's a clear-cut
[1:19:19] decision and it's easy and I hope that
[1:19:21] you I hope that you're staying with me
[1:19:22] on this that I'm not trying to just make
[1:19:25] something out of nothing with these
[1:19:26] scriptures but I think sometimes we just
[1:19:28] read right over the scripture and don't
[1:19:30] realize that inside of that scripture is
[1:19:32] so much there's so much inside of there
[1:19:34] he says I have commanded you this day to
[1:19:36] love the Lord thy God if God has to
[1:19:39] command you to do
[1:19:41] something then there's a possibility
[1:19:43] that you won't do
[1:19:45] it if you just if you just did it
[1:19:48] naturally then there was no need for him
[1:19:50] to command you to do
[1:19:52] it but God has commanded Ed you to love
[1:19:55] the Lord thy God and to walk in his ways
[1:19:59] which means there's a possibility and a
[1:20:01] likely possibility of you not walking in
[1:20:03] his
[1:20:05] ways to keep his Commandments and his
[1:20:08] statutes and his judgments that thou
[1:20:10] mayest live and multiply notice I want
[1:20:13] to go back to this verse 15 he says I've
[1:20:15] set before you life and death and I'm
[1:20:19] sorry life and good and death and evil I
[1:20:22] don't want to misquote the Bible life
[1:20:23] and good and death and evil I don't see
[1:20:25] anywhere in that scripture okay let's do
[1:20:28] the opposite survey how many choose life
[1:20:30] and
[1:20:32] good there were some people that are in
[1:20:34] between I don't even know what you're
[1:20:35] choosing right now you didn't choose the
[1:20:37] first one but maybe okay but it was most
[1:20:40] everybody okay I don't see anywhere in
[1:20:42] the scripture where it says
[1:20:45] easy in fact I'll tell you right now
[1:20:49] that the easy path is the path to death
[1:20:51] and
[1:20:52] evil so now you have have another
[1:20:55] decision do I choose the hard path or do
[1:20:57] I choose the easy path wow and and and I
[1:21:01] I know what I know I'd get hands if I
[1:21:03] ask you this but how many has chosen the
[1:21:06] easy
[1:21:10] path but
[1:21:12] today that doesn't matter
[1:21:15] anymore because I serve a God who knows
[1:21:19] my
[1:21:20] name I serve a God who knows not the
[1:21:24] decisions I make that are wrong but he
[1:21:27] knows the person that's making
[1:21:29] them and he loves the person that's
[1:21:32] making
[1:21:33] them if you have kids have your have
[1:21:36] your children ever made a wrong
[1:21:38] decision I should hear some amens on
[1:21:41] that do you still love
[1:21:45] them why CU they're
[1:21:48] yours right and you could even go man
[1:21:51] they chose the path of of death they
[1:21:53] chose the path of evil they've made
[1:21:55] mistakes they've done wrong they turned
[1:21:57] their back on God they've rejected God I
[1:22:00] I know I'm speaking to real people I
[1:22:01] know we have issues like this they've
[1:22:03] said God isn't real they said he isn't
[1:22:05] who you say he is there's nothing to
[1:22:07] that Bible there's nothing to the
[1:22:09] message there's nothing to what you
[1:22:10] believe but today that doesn't matter
[1:22:14] anymore because they belong to you and
[1:22:17] if you know their name and go and God
[1:22:20] knows your name it's not a grandchild no
[1:22:22] it's that a token of a holy ghost has
[1:22:25] been applied to
[1:22:27] them and if you choose a path of good
[1:22:31] and life God there's an effect that
[1:22:35] happens there's a benefit to the
[1:22:39] believer's life and the benefit just
[1:22:42] like if you make good decisions in your
[1:22:43] household your children Prosper off of
[1:22:46] those good
[1:22:47] decisions right just like if you make a
[1:22:50] bad decision your children will suffer
[1:22:52] because of your bad decisions even
[1:22:54] though they didn't make them but if you
[1:22:56] decide if you make a good decision today
[1:22:59] it has benefits to your
[1:23:01] household and you say well you know what
[1:23:04] I I made a bunch of wrong decisions and
[1:23:06] now my children don't serve the Lord but
[1:23:08] today that doesn't matter anymore
[1:23:11] because today you have a decision that
[1:23:13] lays before you a new decision today not
[1:23:17] only who are you going to serve but
[1:23:20] who's going to
[1:23:22] die and guess who has to die today
[1:23:26] right
[1:23:27] here the same one deciding is the same
[1:23:31] this is why I could get a survey that
[1:23:34] has aund 120 people maybe 150 people
[1:23:38] here all in agreement and yet we'll walk
[1:23:40] out those doors and we'll struggle with
[1:23:43] it and you know why because in order to
[1:23:46] choose life and death this person has to
[1:23:50] die not once when you gave your heart to
[1:23:53] the Lord
[1:23:57] today you say I woke up in a good mood I
[1:23:59] woke up praying I woke up singing but
[1:24:02] today you got to take can every I I'm
[1:24:05] not much for participation or forcing
[1:24:08] you to do something so you don't have to
[1:24:09] but every just point at this person
[1:24:11] right here you got to take this person
[1:24:13] out and kill
[1:24:16] it and I tell you why because this
[1:24:20] person is the Mammon in that scripture
[1:24:25] this person is the other master that you
[1:24:30] serve now I know sometimes we go no
[1:24:32] that's the devil that's Satan that's
[1:24:34] this and
[1:24:35] that Satan has no power except the power
[1:24:38] that you give
[1:24:40] him you know that he can't force you to
[1:24:43] do a single thing he can't make you do
[1:24:45] something the devil made me do it the
[1:24:47] devil can't make you do a single thing
[1:24:49] you have to allow him to have governance
[1:24:52] of your life amen you have to allow him
[1:24:55] that so really the god I want to tell
[1:24:58] you this the god that comes up against
[1:25:01] the real God is this
[1:25:05] God and you say well I'm not a God I I
[1:25:08] don't think I'm a God but sometimes we
[1:25:10] act like we're God we act like what we
[1:25:13] think matters most of all that what I
[1:25:16] want and what I feel and what I think is
[1:25:18] the most important thing you know the
[1:25:20] definition of a God that's what that
[1:25:22] is and what he saying in the scriptures
[1:25:25] he's saying you cannot serve God and
[1:25:29] yourself at the same
[1:25:32] time so then now a decision lays before
[1:25:34] you will I serve
[1:25:37] myself or will I serve God now I don't
[1:25:40] know of a single person I bet you I
[1:25:41] could do another hand raise I don't know
[1:25:43] of a single person that would go I want
[1:25:44] to serve myself
[1:25:46] today just like nobody would choose the
[1:25:49] path of sin and death and evil and yet
[1:25:52] it's a struggle right yet we have a
[1:25:55] battle before
[1:25:56] us because the flesh wants what the
[1:25:59] flesh
[1:26:00] wants
[1:26:02] right right I mean just tell yourself
[1:26:05] hey I'm not gonna I'm not going to eat
[1:26:07] and then the stomach goes to rumbling a
[1:26:08] little bit right try telling your
[1:26:11] stomach
[1:26:13] no it's hard how much more when the
[1:26:17] flesh pulls on
[1:26:19] you when maybe it's not even bad right
[1:26:21] maybe it's just a thought about somebody
[1:26:25] but that thought if it's evil is not of
[1:26:27] God and if that thought is evil and it's
[1:26:30] not of God then there's someone else
[1:26:33] making
[1:26:35] decisions you know
[1:26:39] um it's really it's time to stop playing
[1:26:44] games it's time to stop playing
[1:26:48] church it's stop to it's time to stop
[1:26:50] playing church I you know there's
[1:26:52] there's a there's an expression in and
[1:26:54] it's a little bit crude but I'm going to
[1:26:55] use it this expression is called Allin
[1:26:58] you know it's it's from poker I hate to
[1:27:00] use that expression but you know it's in
[1:27:02] other things too but but it just fits
[1:27:05] you know there's some things that you
[1:27:06] can only do if you're
[1:27:10] Allin but I don't know for years and
[1:27:13] years I've done this years and years I
[1:27:14] wonder if we've served the Lord if we've
[1:27:17] served him just giv a little bit at a
[1:27:19] time but not everything right just give
[1:27:21] a little bit at a time I'm Gonna Keep
[1:27:23] some back because there's more there's
[1:27:25] more to this serving thing instead of
[1:27:27] just being
[1:27:28] Allin Lord I believe you and I believe
[1:27:31] that you're good I I do have a quote
[1:27:33] that I had um I'll flip to it and
[1:27:35] because it wasn't for I just had it on
[1:27:37] the side he says you know uh people
[1:27:40] brother R says this people let him in
[1:27:43] talking about the Lord now and say I'll
[1:27:45] let him be my
[1:27:47] savior but they won't let him be Lord
[1:27:54] why because they're not all
[1:27:59] in Come Into My Heart Lord oh he says
[1:28:02] they won't let him be Lord Lord means
[1:28:06] ownership
[1:28:08] rulership and if anything in the world
[1:28:11] is telling you right now don't be owned
[1:28:13] don't be ruled don't be a slave don't be
[1:28:17] oppressed okay but yet we let our work
[1:28:20] oppress us and own us we let our mind
[1:28:22] oppress us and own us right we let the
[1:28:24] desire of the flesh oppress us and own
[1:28:27] us and yet when it comes time for God to
[1:28:29] have ownership oh well we don't want to
[1:28:31] really be owned by anything I want to be
[1:28:34] free I thought I was supposed to be free
[1:28:35] when I became a Christian I became free
[1:28:38] as a Christian I became free from sin
[1:28:41] and death when I chose goodness and life
[1:28:45] right but it wasn't me that chose that
[1:28:47] it was something inside of me that chose
[1:28:49] that because if this guy had a decision
[1:28:52] to make it would be wrong
[1:28:56] if this I'm going to say if this God and
[1:28:59] you have one made a decision it would be
[1:29:02] the wrong
[1:29:04] decision this God has to be taken out
[1:29:07] and it has to be
[1:29:09] killed so that the real God can come in
[1:29:12] and then you're free but I've made a
[1:29:15] choice now you know what I've done this
[1:29:16] is it's it's a paradox I've made a
[1:29:19] choice with my freedom you know what
[1:29:20] I've chosen with my free choice to be a
[1:29:23] prisoner
[1:29:27] I wasn't hauled away in Chains into jail
[1:29:29] against my will no it's with my own will
[1:29:33] I've chosen to be a prisoner of
[1:29:36] God and I'm telling you being a prisoner
[1:29:38] of God feels way different brother
[1:29:39] Daniel when you choose it how many likes
[1:29:42] being drugged to church you don't even
[1:29:44] have don't raise your hand on that one
[1:29:47] right the kids just came back from
[1:29:49] Sunday
[1:29:51] school nobody likes being drugged to
[1:29:54] Church why because you're a prisoner of
[1:29:56] God against your own
[1:29:58] will and you know I don't that's when I
[1:30:01] tell you it's time to stop playing
[1:30:02] church I do not go to church because I
[1:30:06] have
[1:30:07] to I I'll tell you this I don't even go
[1:30:10] to church because the Bible and the
[1:30:12] message tell me to do
[1:30:14] it I I know it might get a little bit I
[1:30:17] got a it might get a little bit quiet
[1:30:19] now if you don't have a revelation do it
[1:30:21] because the Bible tells you to do it
[1:30:23] right but there's nothing like when you
[1:30:25] do it because you want to do
[1:30:28] it when you have been freed to make the
[1:30:32] choice to chain yourself to
[1:30:36] God I go to church I come down here I
[1:30:40] don't want I'm telling you right now I'm
[1:30:41] just we're just G to be honest this
[1:30:42] morning I don't want to stand before you
[1:30:43] and preach I don't I want to come down
[1:30:46] here Brother Dan Brother Aaron one of
[1:30:48] the other brothers I it it refills me
[1:30:52] and I don't have to stand up here before
[1:30:53] you preach to
[1:30:55] you but I've chained myself to
[1:30:58] God and I love it so much that if he
[1:31:02] says go to church if he says go to
[1:31:05] Tucson if he says go to the other side
[1:31:08] of the world if he says sit down and do
[1:31:10] nothing I'm happy to do
[1:31:12] it because with my freedom I've chose to
[1:31:16] be a
[1:31:20] prisoner it's it it sounds good but it's
[1:31:23] it's not
[1:31:24] easy because
[1:31:26] tomorrow that decision won't
[1:31:29] matter tomorrow I got to decide again
[1:31:33] who do I want to be a prisoner
[1:31:35] of tomorrow I'm just as free do I decide
[1:31:38] to be a prisoner of Christ or a prisoner
[1:31:40] of this God and I I I I I just say that
[1:31:45] that way and I hope you I hope you catch
[1:31:47] what I'm trying to say I hope you really
[1:31:49] see what's on my heart I really really
[1:31:52] hate to keep blaming the devil
[1:31:56] now I know the devil is wrong I know
[1:31:58] that Satan is there I know Lucifer is a
[1:32:00] real being I I know that but I I really
[1:32:03] hate to keep giving him credit for
[1:32:06] things I decided to
[1:32:08] do and and sometimes he becomes the
[1:32:13] scapegoat well the devil made me do it
[1:32:15] well the devil caused me to do this you
[1:32:16] know what I just didn't have the right
[1:32:18] decision and he becomes the person or he
[1:32:22] becomes the guilty one and the real
[1:32:24] problem lies right here and if that if I
[1:32:28] put all the blame on him and certainly
[1:32:31] does he have influence over our life
[1:32:33] certainly he has influence over our life
[1:32:35] but none that I don't give
[1:32:38] him none that I don't give him you say
[1:32:41] well no wait a minute what do you mean I
[1:32:42] I mean there's things out there on the
[1:32:44] on the internet and and uh you know it's
[1:32:46] just is what it is yeah but you don't
[1:32:47] have to have the
[1:32:49] internet well you don't understand
[1:32:50] brother I got a business around I got I
[1:32:52] you know just I got family I got to keep
[1:32:54] in touch with and you know they're
[1:32:55] trying to get a hold of me I've heard
[1:32:56] the excuse I've heard the excuse why we
[1:32:58] have to have this in church when I hear
[1:33:00] the ringers going off I'm just going to
[1:33:03] you may not like it but I'm just going
[1:33:04] to say it mine's gone off too so I'm
[1:33:06] preaching myself you know what the
[1:33:08] response was oh well I got family they
[1:33:10] may need to get a hold of me and I have
[1:33:11] to have my phone well what did you do
[1:33:13] before the cell
[1:33:14] phone the family got a hold of you
[1:33:17] somehow well there could be you know I
[1:33:19] got somebody in the hospital and they're
[1:33:20] sick it always used to be that way and
[1:33:22] yet we came to church
[1:33:24] I'm not preaching against technology I'm
[1:33:26] preaching against that the devil has no
[1:33:29] influence over you except the one that
[1:33:31] you give him so if I give him if I
[1:33:35] accept the phone then I accept things
[1:33:38] that come with the
[1:33:40] phone right if I accept the internet
[1:33:44] then I accept the things that come with
[1:33:46] the internet if I can't handle those
[1:33:48] things I need to reject the internet I'm
[1:33:51] sorry just to say it plain black and
[1:33:53] white but if your right hand offends you
[1:33:57] cut it off and it's better to enter into
[1:34:00] the kingdom of heaven with no arm I'm
[1:34:02] sorry it's better to be a Christian with
[1:34:06] no internet wow than it is to to to sit
[1:34:10] in the Kingdom of hell with your cell
[1:34:13] phone and all of your all the access
[1:34:14] that it gives you that's just as plain
[1:34:17] as I can make it and I'm preaching to
[1:34:19] myself I'd rather enter into heaven with
[1:34:23] no arm and no leg and no eyeball if
[1:34:27] that's what it takes if I got to take it
[1:34:29] out I'd rather enter in that way because
[1:34:32] if I enter in that way he's able to
[1:34:34] restore me he's able to restore what I
[1:34:37] had to decide to get rid of in order to
[1:34:42] be all
[1:34:44] in I wonder if we really are all in if
[1:34:47] we're not willing to give up everything
[1:34:50] now now okay now when you leave from
[1:34:52] here and you say and brother Dan if you
[1:34:54] get if you get somebody calling you now
[1:34:55] brother Ryan said I had to give up my
[1:34:58] phone I had to give up the internet or I
[1:35:00] wasn't going to go to heaven that's not
[1:35:01] what I'm telling you I'm telling you
[1:35:05] that if you are being influenced by
[1:35:08] it you have a decision that lays before
[1:35:12] you if you
[1:35:14] continue if I continue to be influenced
[1:35:17] I've made my decision and it doesn't
[1:35:19] matter if I didn't raise my hand for
[1:35:21] death and evil you know what I've done I
[1:35:23] choose death and evil that's what I've
[1:35:25] done wow if I continue to let influence
[1:35:29] have power in my
[1:35:32] life he says a lord means
[1:35:36] ownership
[1:35:38] rulership he says in quotations Come
[1:35:41] Into My Heart Lord and save me from
[1:35:45] hell but don't tell me what to
[1:35:50] do that's the attitude
[1:35:53] of the
[1:35:55] people I listened to this testimony and
[1:35:57] I hope it's okay to tell this testimony
[1:35:59] it's not of a it's of a I don't even
[1:36:02] know if the Man's Alive anymore but it
[1:36:03] was a a a denominational preacher you
[1:36:06] probably have heard it's on the
[1:36:08] internet that internet I was just
[1:36:10] talking
[1:36:11] about and he gave this testimony you
[1:36:13] know I'm a little bit cautious when I
[1:36:15] when I take anything that's not really
[1:36:18] been Vindicated by God himself I
[1:36:21] listened to this testimony and brother
[1:36:23] and it there was a there was a that
[1:36:26] certain sound to it now I didn't hear
[1:36:28] the whole thing I heard about I heard
[1:36:30] about 10 minutes of it but this man had
[1:36:33] a he had a
[1:36:36] life um he almost died I can't remember
[1:36:40] if it was a heart attack or what had
[1:36:41] happened to him but he's he's on the way
[1:36:42] to the hospital and he's like in a coma
[1:36:44] and he says when he woke up he says he
[1:36:46] actually went to what he he didn't know
[1:36:48] if it was a dream or what was happening
[1:36:50] again the basis of the of the testimony
[1:36:52] is not important it was what he said he
[1:36:54] said he stood before the Gates of
[1:36:58] Heaven and they asked him and he said a
[1:37:01] voice came and he said he knew it was
[1:37:03] the Lord he said he couldn't even move
[1:37:05] and the Lord asked
[1:37:07] him if he thought he deserved to go
[1:37:12] in and he said
[1:37:15] uh yes Lord I believe that I
[1:37:18] do and the Lord said make your
[1:37:22] case and he said said well I've been a
[1:37:24] preacher for 30 40 years he goes I
[1:37:26] started to tell him about all the
[1:37:27] preaching that I've done he said he
[1:37:30] started to tell him about all the souls
[1:37:31] that he had won to Christ that he
[1:37:33] genuinely said he had won to Christ he
[1:37:35] had been a missionary he had been he had
[1:37:37] done charity work where he fed thousands
[1:37:40] and thousands of people brought the word
[1:37:42] to them preach he saids I never I never
[1:37:44] didn't he didn't say he didn't do
[1:37:46] anything wrong he says but you know
[1:37:48] since the Lord changed me I've not I've
[1:37:50] not strayed away from this and this is
[1:37:53] what The Voice came back and told him he
[1:37:54] says all those things you did for
[1:38:01] yourself and he said he started to get
[1:38:04] almost
[1:38:06] almost h a little bit not angry but kind
[1:38:09] of like wait a minute Lord no I did
[1:38:13] those for
[1:38:15] you you are I did those for you you are
[1:38:20] the Lord and this is what the Lord told
[1:38:22] him in this video he said you call me
[1:38:26] Lord but you've never made me your
[1:38:31] lord you call me your ruler your owner
[1:38:37] but he says you've never made me your
[1:38:39] owner and he says right when he heard
[1:38:42] those words he realized it was
[1:38:45] true he says you couldn't argue with
[1:38:49] it and he knew he deserved to go to
[1:38:55] hell and he says he was he he just broke
[1:38:58] down and the angels came to him and said
[1:39:01] we're going to take you before him one
[1:39:02] more time make your
[1:39:04] case and they brought him before the
[1:39:06] voice and he said
[1:39:10] Lord I don't deserve to go to
[1:39:13] heaven I deserve exactly the Judgment
[1:39:17] that you said I
[1:39:18] deserved you're right I did it for
[1:39:21] me because he goes I didn't think at the
[1:39:24] time but when I look back I didn't make
[1:39:27] you ruler I didn't make you owner and he
[1:39:30] says
[1:39:31] then the Lord started to talk to him
[1:39:36] softly
[1:39:38] gently then he said the Lord treated him
[1:39:41] like he was his
[1:39:43] child not when he came to him with all
[1:39:45] that what he done
[1:39:47] because I think when we do that maybe
[1:39:50] when I do that it's trying to present to
[1:39:53] the Lord somebody
[1:39:57] worthy when that is just lifting up
[1:40:02] Mammon it's lifting up and really that
[1:40:05] word we you could read throughout the
[1:40:07] message in the Bible that word means it
[1:40:09] does mean the
[1:40:10] world but it also means
[1:40:13] wealth it also means riches and it also
[1:40:16] means Security in your own
[1:40:20] riches and if you go to the Lord and you
[1:40:22] present to him that you are secure in
[1:40:26] yourself he can't accept
[1:40:29] that because you have chosen to serve a
[1:40:32] different
[1:40:33] God you know even in the Bible that the
[1:40:36] Jesus says that you must be now this is
[1:40:39] just this is like the basis of of what
[1:40:41] we believe Jesus says You must be
[1:40:43] baptized in the name of the father Son
[1:40:45] and Holy Ghost and then by the by by in
[1:40:48] the message we learn okay over here in
[1:40:49] Acts 238 that Peter says repent and be
[1:40:54] baptized in the name of it does not say
[1:40:57] Lord Jesus Christ it says Jesus
[1:41:01] Christ and yet when we read in the
[1:41:03] message and we read and we hear
[1:41:05] preaching it's that the father Son and
[1:41:07] Holy Ghost is Lord Jesus Christ and you
[1:41:10] say well it takes a revelation to know
[1:41:12] that it's because Jesus Christ is there
[1:41:15] and you can say you know what I accept
[1:41:17] him as Jesus Christ he's good he died
[1:41:19] for me brother Aaron he did all these
[1:41:21] things for me but that doesn't mean
[1:41:23] you've made him Lord
[1:41:25] yet in order to really fulfill what
[1:41:28] Jesus is saying back here in baptism and
[1:41:31] really fulfill what is over here in Acts
[1:41:32] 238 you have to take Jesus Christ and
[1:41:36] make him your lord and the only way you
[1:41:40] can make him your lord is if your
[1:41:42] current Lord
[1:41:45] dies and you cannot tell me oh I'm here
[1:41:48] neutral I don't have a lord you have a
[1:41:51] lord right now in your seat right now
[1:41:55] you have a lord you decide which one it
[1:41:58] is now if you walked in and I I can just
[1:42:00] tell you this if you walked in and you
[1:42:02] had chose the wrong one that doesn't
[1:42:04] matter right now amen that old Lord that
[1:42:08] you chose maybe it was this one right
[1:42:10] here that can die right now this morning
[1:42:13] and the Lord can come in and take
[1:42:18] ownership now I'm not trying to pep you
[1:42:20] up I'm not trying to get you riled I'm
[1:42:22] telling you that I I believe there's so
[1:42:24] many people that have just woke up and
[1:42:27] maybe they were good yesterday or the
[1:42:28] day before they were good a month ago
[1:42:30] when the Lord did something for them but
[1:42:32] maybe you woke up today and you chose
[1:42:34] the wrong thing and you didn't even know
[1:42:37] it if you don't choose God you've chosen
[1:42:41] already a different Lord I'll put it
[1:42:42] that way you can't walk through the day
[1:42:45] neutral and go I'm going to see what
[1:42:47] happens to me today Daniel I'm gonna see
[1:42:49] what happens to me today and then I'll
[1:42:50] know if it was a good day or not you
[1:42:52] wake up and you choose what you
[1:42:55] want you choose the influence that you
[1:42:57] want over here there's a there's a
[1:43:01] there's a quote I think you might have
[1:43:03] referenced this last time I was here
[1:43:05] brother
[1:43:06] Dan what we were talking about I don't
[1:43:08] to read it anyways if that's
[1:43:11] okay he's talking about Le Levi this is
[1:43:15] the uh great grandson of
[1:43:19] Abraham he says when Abraham paid tith
[1:43:23] es unto
[1:43:26] MDC that his great grandson who wasn't
[1:43:29] even born yet those ties were counted to
[1:43:33] him which means when Abraham paid ties
[1:43:38] Levi got the benefits of
[1:43:42] that and I want to tell you this too
[1:43:45] that works the other
[1:43:46] way there's been Generations sometimes
[1:43:49] in families of
[1:43:51] sin and and and men and women turning
[1:43:55] from the Lord and their children their
[1:43:57] great-grandchildren their grandchildren
[1:44:00] have a negative effect because of it
[1:44:02] it's in the
[1:44:05] Bible but God doesn't
[1:44:09] care if there is a willing heart that's
[1:44:12] willing to accept him as Lord yeah I
[1:44:15] know that so is so basic and simple but
[1:44:18] he can take
[1:44:20] generational decisions of sin and evil
[1:44:23] like we saw on that scripture and wipe
[1:44:26] it away in a
[1:44:27] moment he can even take your lifetime
[1:44:30] whether you're 15 years old 18 years old
[1:44:33] 30 years old 40 years old doesn't matter
[1:44:36] your lifetime of deciding wrong things
[1:44:38] and wipe it out right
[1:44:41] now and it says and you don't have to
[1:44:43] take my word for it now let's just go
[1:44:45] back to the word he says that's
[1:44:47] predestination here comes into perfect
[1:44:49] view predestination God's Own thinking
[1:44:52] God the great spirit spirit in the
[1:44:54] beginning he was God did you know I want
[1:44:57] to ask you the same question he's asking
[1:44:59] did you know that you were in him
[1:45:04] then okay so if you know it it's good if
[1:45:07] you don't know it that's what I'm
[1:45:09] talking about this
[1:45:11] morning if you know
[1:45:14] that there's peace
[1:45:17] right how many knows that and still does
[1:45:20] something wrong
[1:45:23] right but there's peace knowing I can
[1:45:26] come back to
[1:45:28] you I can come under the shed blood of
[1:45:31] your
[1:45:32] son and I can take this old God out to
[1:45:34] the field and slay
[1:45:36] him and if you don't know him that way
[1:45:40] it's so simple and easy to know him that
[1:45:45] way you are a Christian now if you are a
[1:45:51] Christian now you were in him
[1:45:54] then and then if that be so the whole
[1:45:59] godhead bodily shaped up into the person
[1:46:02] of Jesus Christ and then this is so good
[1:46:06] this is good for me when he talking
[1:46:10] about Jesus when Jesus died on the cross
[1:46:15] I died with
[1:46:19] him there were two Gods hanging on that
[1:46:24] cross I know that sounds W that sounds
[1:46:26] like some weird Doctrine two Gods
[1:46:28] brother that I hung with
[1:46:31] him and this God
[1:46:35] died this master died this Lord died
[1:46:39] with
[1:46:41] him when Jesus died at the cross I died
[1:46:45] with him for I was in him then he was
[1:46:49] the fullness of the word manifested we
[1:46:52] we were we now he says we how many would
[1:46:56] how many would join in that we all right
[1:46:58] we got a
[1:47:00] few we were at Calvary with
[1:47:04] him we went into the grave with
[1:47:09] him and we were raised with him and his
[1:47:13] resurrection and now we've ascended by
[1:47:15] his Spirit to the throne of grace
[1:47:17] sitting together in Heavenly places and
[1:47:19] when the entire word of God incomplete
[1:47:21] was headed up in a human body called
[1:47:24] Jesus Christ I love this now in
[1:47:28] there God made me pay for my
[1:47:33] sins you got to pay for your
[1:47:37] sins only if you claim listen you can
[1:47:41] pay for them now yes or you can pay for
[1:47:44] them
[1:47:46] later what do you
[1:47:48] decide the decision lays before you you
[1:47:52] said I made that decision 20 years ago
[1:47:54] brother the decision lays before you
[1:47:58] today Paul says
[1:48:01] I
[1:48:03] Die
[1:48:05] daily why would there be a need to Die
[1:48:08] daily because every day this Lord has to
[1:48:12] be taken out and killed every single day
[1:48:15] I have to decide who is going to be my
[1:48:19] God every day I have to decide that and
[1:48:21] this is like the base
[1:48:23] this is such a basic message but I hope
[1:48:25] that I really can just get across to you
[1:48:27] that there is a decision that lays
[1:48:29] before you even right
[1:48:31] now you could you could you could decide
[1:48:34] this morning that was okay that was good
[1:48:38] that was for somebody but that wasn't
[1:48:39] for
[1:48:40] me and I'm not going to sit here and
[1:48:42] tell you you're were
[1:48:43] wrong but a decision lays before you
[1:48:46] even right now because whenever the word
[1:48:48] comes
[1:48:49] forth a decision comes with it amen
[1:48:53] whenever the word is preached you know
[1:48:56] even in brother Dan's testimony you know
[1:48:57] brother brandham was telling a testimony
[1:49:00] to Sister Hatty wght he was just telling
[1:49:02] a testimony and right when he told the
[1:49:05] testimony guess what happened a decision
[1:49:07] came before her just by a testimony all
[1:49:11] of a sudden before this sister came a
[1:49:13] testimony what are you going to say and
[1:49:15] she says that's the
[1:49:18] truth so even a testimony coming out
[1:49:21] when I say even a testimony like it's a
[1:49:23] small thing it's so good what the Lord
[1:49:25] does for us when a testimony comes forth
[1:49:29] a decision lays before you are you going
[1:49:31] to believe it or you going to reject
[1:49:34] it you say you know what that was good
[1:49:36] for you brother Dan that was great or
[1:49:38] you're going to accept it and then all
[1:49:41] of a sudden you feel that same exact
[1:49:43] prayer come and start to come into your
[1:49:45] life somebody praying for you you know
[1:49:46] there might be somebody praying for you
[1:49:49] but the decisions that you've made keep
[1:49:51] that prayer from getting to you
[1:49:55] you ever think about that you might have
[1:49:57] a mom and dad you might have a brother
[1:50:00] or a sister who's praying for you but
[1:50:02] you continue to reject the
[1:50:07] prayer I don't think that we're
[1:50:09] malicious I don't think we do that out
[1:50:10] of it's just choosing this flesh it's
[1:50:13] choosing what this person
[1:50:15] wants and I I really do believe that two
[1:50:18] two Gods two Lords hung on that cross
[1:50:20] that day I was in him
[1:50:23] I can't put you there that's your
[1:50:26] decision right I was a captive to
[1:50:30] alcohol to lust to filth to music to
[1:50:34] pleasures of the
[1:50:35] world and I'm not a captive to those
[1:50:38] things
[1:50:40] anymore do I still have a decision oh
[1:50:42] yeah every day I got to make a decision
[1:50:44] do I want to be captive again do I want
[1:50:46] to make them my Lord again or do I use
[1:50:49] my
[1:50:50] freedom to choose to be captive of God
[1:50:54] Amen and I know this when I serve one of
[1:50:56] those Gods I know I know it's just so
[1:51:00] sometimes it seems so silly we don't
[1:51:01] look at ourselves really and think that
[1:51:02] we're a
[1:51:04] God but who are we
[1:51:07] serving and I tell you who you serve is
[1:51:10] your
[1:51:13] god do I serve this flesh do I serve
[1:51:16] this mind do I serve what this what this
[1:51:18] guy wants do you do that and I tell you
[1:51:21] when I serve one of these two Gods one
[1:51:23] gives me happiness brother Daniel when I
[1:51:26] serve
[1:51:27] myself I'm not I'm not going to lie I
[1:51:30] get
[1:51:32] happy I get happy we don't serve oursel
[1:51:35] and go do something we don't like to do
[1:51:38] right we go we serve oursel in something
[1:51:40] we want to do and there's
[1:51:42] happiness but the happiness
[1:51:44] Fades what's left in its place shame
[1:51:49] disappointment regret oh Lord just give
[1:51:51] me a chance to make that decision again
[1:51:53] right give me a chance to make that
[1:51:55] decision again and then sometimes he
[1:51:56] gives us a chance the very next day we
[1:51:58] decide to serve this guy
[1:52:01] again and it's happiness but when I
[1:52:03] serve the other one there's
[1:52:05] joy you know the difference there's a
[1:52:07] big difference between that it means
[1:52:09] when I'm down when I'm when I'm when I'm
[1:52:12] in shame when I'm in when I'm doing what
[1:52:14] I shouldn't be doing there's a joy that
[1:52:16] says you know what my father he's got a
[1:52:20] mansion and his servants eat better than
[1:52:22] I eat right now you know all I have to
[1:52:25] do is go back and tell them I'm sorry
[1:52:27] all I have to do is go back and say Lord
[1:52:29] I made a mistake I'm
[1:52:31] wrong and he'll receive me gladly and
[1:52:34] there's a joy in that or you could have
[1:52:37] some temporary relief or you can have
[1:52:40] some
[1:52:41] peace right you could have you know you
[1:52:44] could even have some healing of the
[1:52:47] body or you can have a healing of your
[1:52:49] soul
[1:52:54] I just wonder which God that we spend
[1:52:55] the most time worshiping and serving
[1:52:59] because really he wants to be your
[1:53:03] Lord God is not this I don't believe God
[1:53:06] is just this being that's just out there
[1:53:08] in the
[1:53:09] universe I believe I I really do believe
[1:53:13] that he sits right next to
[1:53:15] you and that he wants you to choose him
[1:53:18] to be your lord and and really ownership
[1:53:21] by the Lord is the most freeing thing
[1:53:24] you could ever
[1:53:27] choose and you get to do you know it's
[1:53:29] even in the message he said you know
[1:53:31] well you get to do whatever you want and
[1:53:33] brother Ram saids I always do whatever I
[1:53:36] want because what he changes is what I
[1:53:39] want that's why I tell you I don't I
[1:53:42] don't come to church I don't Worship the
[1:53:43] Lord
[1:53:44] because I have
[1:53:46] to I do it because I want to do it do I
[1:53:49] make mistakes uh uh probably more than
[1:53:52] but then all of you combined I make
[1:53:54] mistakes but I have to get up I have to
[1:53:57] take this person out I have to kill it
[1:53:59] say Lord I'm sorry I'm sorry I let this
[1:54:02] man have lordship over me even if it's
[1:54:05] for a minute it's got to go out and it's
[1:54:08] got to
[1:54:11] die I'll read one more thing and I think
[1:54:13] we'll close uh he says here
[1:54:23] I want to be dead
[1:54:25] Earnest when he speaks to me I just I
[1:54:29] can just say what he showed me whether
[1:54:30] it's good or bad I have to say it this
[1:54:34] isn't a a message of everybody jumping
[1:54:37] and
[1:54:38] shouting sometime maybe even might maybe
[1:54:41] it didn't even sound good but he says
[1:54:43] it's good or bad I have to say it and
[1:54:46] sometimes it's not pleasant to tell
[1:54:47] people those things but yet I'm just as
[1:54:50] Duty bound to tell the evil things that
[1:54:53] will befall
[1:54:54] them as I am Duty bound to tell them the
[1:54:57] good things that will befall them and
[1:55:00] after all we want the will of the
[1:55:03] Lord
[1:55:05] right which
[1:55:07] Lord which
[1:55:10] Lord Jesus
[1:55:12] Christ he's Jesus Christ but he's the
[1:55:15] Lord Jesus
[1:55:17] Christ after all we want the will of the
[1:55:20] Lord and oh this you should agree with
[1:55:24] this statement sometimes the will of the
[1:55:27] Lord is contrary to our
[1:55:30] desires
[1:55:32] right but still if we want the will of
[1:55:36] the lord it's just as precious listen
[1:55:39] now it's just as precious if this could
[1:55:43] if anything could encourage you this
[1:55:45] morning it's just as precious to know
[1:55:49] that the evil will befall us if it's the
[1:55:53] will of the
[1:55:55] Lord because you don't care what happens
[1:55:57] to you you don't care if it's good you
[1:55:59] don't care if it's bad you've chosen him
[1:56:02] as Lord you've chosen him as ownership
[1:56:04] and everything you know everything that
[1:56:07] happens to you is good if you chose the
[1:56:11] Lord there's a man who says even if the
[1:56:15] Lord slays
[1:56:17] me I'll trust in him that was somebody
[1:56:21] who decided
[1:56:22] even though I'm on the ash Heap even
[1:56:25] though I lost my children my family my
[1:56:27] riches my household my wife my
[1:56:31] health his will is still the right
[1:56:35] will his ownership is still better than
[1:56:39] my own ownership and even if he takes my
[1:56:42] life I we can make this statement
[1:56:44] casually but I'm telling you this
[1:56:46] morning a decision lays before you you
[1:56:48] got to be you have to decide is this
[1:56:51] what you you
[1:56:53] believe are you
[1:56:57] willing to to rest your Eternal
[1:57:00] destination on this
[1:57:04] word that's the decision that really
[1:57:06] lays before you this
[1:57:08] morning and and I'll tell you this he
[1:57:11] says this I'll finish this it's just as
[1:57:14] precious to know that evil will be
[1:57:15] followed us if it's the will of the Lord
[1:57:17] whether it be good or evil it's the will
[1:57:19] of the Lord that we want done
[1:57:23] and I I've made a decision now I've made
[1:57:25] M I'm I've made mistakes I hope I don't
[1:57:28] continue to make mistakes but I've made
[1:57:30] a
[1:57:31] decision that
[1:57:33] if I'm all
[1:57:36] in I'm all
[1:57:38] in if the God that I serve is not God if
[1:57:43] Jesus Christ was just another man and it
[1:57:46] turns out that Muhammad was the one or
[1:57:49] this other one was the it was the right
[1:57:51] one
[1:57:52] I've chosen Jesus
[1:57:55] Christ and if Jesus Christ is false and
[1:57:58] he sent to whatever hell that there is
[1:58:00] is I've chosen to go there with Jesus
[1:58:03] Christ I'm all in there's no turning
[1:58:06] back if if if this word and this message
[1:58:11] is false I've chosen it and I'm all
[1:58:15] in I'm all in I cannot be
[1:58:20] unconvinced I cannot I can't be I've the
[1:58:23] Lord's done too much for me whatever
[1:58:25] Lord has done something for me he is God
[1:58:28] he is my God and he's done so much for
[1:58:31] me I I've seen what I was and I'm not
[1:58:34] that person anymore and there's no
[1:58:37] possible way that this God could have
[1:58:40] made that change I've tried I don't know
[1:58:43] how many of you have tried you ever
[1:58:44] tried to make yourself change that's
[1:58:47] this God trying to make change and it
[1:58:49] doesn't work but I've met the
[1:58:53] God and if that God is false I go
[1:58:56] wherever he goes if he's not the true
[1:58:59] God I go exactly where that's I'm all
[1:59:01] in because Jesus Christ is my
[1:59:05] Lord he is my Lord if if he slay
[1:59:10] me he's
[1:59:13] good if I'm suffering he's good am when
[1:59:19] I'm down when I'm depressed when I'm you
[1:59:22] know discouraged he's good when I have
[1:59:25] family members that are sick he's good
[1:59:29] when I have family members that are not
[1:59:30] serving the lord he's good
[1:59:33] am when I when I have family members
[1:59:36] that die church members that die he's
[1:59:39] still
[1:59:42] good when I don't know what I'm
[1:59:45] doing he's good when I don't know where
[1:59:48] I belong he's
[1:59:50] good when I I don't know what I'm going
[1:59:52] to do tomorrow to get through the day
[1:59:54] he's
[1:59:55] good it's not just when things are going
[1:59:59] good it's he's good because I've made
[2:00:02] him my Lord not because not because I'm
[2:00:05] good it's because he's good he does not
[2:00:09] want he does not want people to serve
[2:00:14] him because they have to serve
[2:00:16] him neither do you want somebody to love
[2:00:19] you because they have to love you
[2:00:22] right what kind of marriage would you
[2:00:23] have with your spouse if your spouse
[2:00:26] says I love you because I have
[2:00:30] to I mean I really don't want to but I
[2:00:33] know it's the right thing that's not a
[2:00:36] love and God doesn't want that kind of
[2:00:39] love
[2:00:40] either a decision he's placed his
[2:00:43] decision before you today and you say
[2:00:45] well I I I think I've made that
[2:00:47] decision just examine today have you
[2:00:50] made that decision yes I I'm not trying
[2:00:53] to preach some some you know some
[2:00:55] Baptist Doctrine this is
[2:00:59] real and and I'm telling you you might
[2:01:01] have woke up today and made the wrong
[2:01:03] one but it doesn't matter because the
[2:01:05] decision lays before you right now you
[2:01:08] can take that God out and kill
[2:01:16] him and I think I'm gonna leave it there
[2:01:18] brother
[2:01:20] Dan I
[2:01:23] I really hope that you know that this
[2:01:24] came from my
[2:01:26] heart that I didn't have on my mind what
[2:01:29] to talk to you about that I you write
[2:01:31] down scriptures you write down
[2:01:34] quotes but I I I just want to I want to
[2:01:38] encourage you this
[2:01:39] morning we hear so much about what's
[2:01:42] going wrong we hear so much about all
[2:01:45] the bad in the world but I get peace in
[2:01:48] knowing that if I just turn to him like
[2:01:53] he says to
[2:01:55] Israel you've sinned against me you've
[2:01:58] gone after Egypt you've gone after
[2:01:59] riches you've gone after spoils you've
[2:02:01] gone after Mammon but if you just turn
[2:02:04] and look at me I'll restore
[2:02:08] you that's what I want to do this
[2:02:10] morning Amen brother Dan if you want to
[2:02:12] come
[2:02:13] [Applause]
[2:02:23] I think next time brother Ryan speaks
[2:02:24] for us when he walks up to the pulpit
[2:02:27] I'm going to say I'll take your
[2:02:30] notes do you appreciate that this
[2:02:39] morning when
[2:02:41] um brother Ryan talked about two Gods
[2:02:45] there's another word for a
[2:02:47] god it's very very often found in the
[2:02:51] Bible and and a lot of times they're
[2:02:52] they're used synonymously with each
[2:02:55] other and that's the word
[2:02:57] Idol and you can you can make yourself
[2:03:00] an idol you can make your wants an idol
[2:03:03] and our brother our brother told us that
[2:03:06] today and there has to be a death you
[2:03:09] have to die it's what baptism is all
[2:03:11] about you have to die you have to go
[2:03:12] into the grave and you have to raise up
[2:03:13] a new person that the old man is dead I
[2:03:17] really appreciated what brother Ryan was
[2:03:19] saying about
[2:03:22] um about being
[2:03:25] Allin if there's something that I want
[2:03:27] in my life it's to be Allin Lord I don't
[2:03:31] want to be a Halfway Christian Lord I
[2:03:33] want to be Allin I want I want to live
[2:03:35] my life for you I want to I want to
[2:03:37] stand for you I don't want to just be a
[2:03:40] Christian in 90% of my life but then in
[2:03:43] 10% not be a
[2:03:45] Christian brother Ryan said that he
[2:03:50] said what you do today he said this
[2:03:57] day he said that was yesterday many of
[2:04:00] us have have said that I wish I would
[2:04:02] have raised my children different I wish
[2:04:04] I would have done this different I would
[2:04:06] I wish I would have done that different
[2:04:07] Lord I I just wish I would have been
[2:04:09] different but the question is what will
[2:04:12] you do this day will you be all
[2:04:17] in it's a question brothers and sisters
[2:04:19] and I think that it's a it's a question
[2:04:21] that that needs to be answered today
[2:04:23] will you be all
[2:04:24] in what will you do this day yesterday's
[2:04:30] yesterday but what will you do this
[2:04:35] [Music]
[2:04:43] day
[2:04:44] Joshua said
[2:04:46] [Music]
[2:04:49] this he said and if it seem evil unto
[2:04:53] you to serve the Lord if it seems wrong
[2:04:56] to you to serve the
[2:04:58] Lord they were caught between two Gods
[2:05:01] here they were caught between the idol
[2:05:04] of the world and they were caught
[2:05:05] between this God of the old this Jehovah
[2:05:08] of the Old Testament which we believe is
[2:05:10] Jesus

[2:05:17] through Joshua he says choose this day
[2:05:20] whom you will serve
[2:05:22] [Music]
[2:05:25] whether the gods which are your fathers
[2:05:28] served that were on the other side of
