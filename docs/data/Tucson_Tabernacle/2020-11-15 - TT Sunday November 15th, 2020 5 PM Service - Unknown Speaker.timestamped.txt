[55:43] to Romans
[55:52] n9ine Deuteronomy
[55:57] chapter
[55:59] 8 let's just start reading at verse
[56:06] one you have say
[56:08] amen mean the Bible
[56:11] says all the Commandments which I
[56:13] commanded thee this day shall ye observe
[56:16] to do that ye may live and multiply and
[56:19] go in and possess the land which the
[56:22] Lord swear unto your fathers and thou sh
[56:26] remember all the way which the Lord thy
[56:29] God LED thee these 40 years in the
[56:33] wilderness to Humble thee and to prove
[56:36] thee to know what was in thine heart
[56:39] whether thou wouldest keep his
[56:41] Commandments or no and he humbled thee
[56:45] and suffered thee to hunger and to feed
[56:47] thee with manner which thou knowest not
[56:50] neither did thy fathers know that he
[56:54] might make thee know that man do not
[56:57] live by bread alone but by every word
[56:59] that proceedeth out of the mouth of the
[57:02] Lord doth Man live amen Romans
[57:19] 9 Romans 9 let's start reading at verse
[57:24] 9 it says for this is the Word of
[57:27] Promise at this time will I come and
[57:29] Sarah shall have a son and not only this
[57:34] but when Rebecca also had conceived by
[57:37] one even by Our Father Isaac for the
[57:41] children not being yet born neither
[57:43] having done any good or evil that the
[57:47] purpose of God according to
[57:49] election might stand not of works but of
[57:54] him that calleth
[57:56] it was said unto her the Elder Shall
[57:59] Serve the younger as it is written Jacob
[58:02] have I loved but Esau have I hated amen
[58:07] may the Lord a BL blessing to the
[58:08] reading of his word you can have your
[58:16] seats amen by the grace of God tonight I
[58:20] want to encourage your
[58:21] hearts amen I I think like I said this
[58:24] morning I think sometimes we
[58:26] go through so much as a Believer as a
[58:29] Christian just trying to live with all
[58:31] the things going around us we forget
[58:35] that God has saved us we forget that God
[58:39] has made a way that he chose you before
[58:41] the foundation of the world and if we
[58:44] could just deal with that part for for a
[58:47] second amen my title today tonight is
[58:52] the omniscient God and we know you know
[58:56] through what was taught by a prophet the
[58:58] meaning of these words but have these
[59:01] words these titles these adjectives
[59:03] about God have they quickened to you
[59:06] because we say that he's omnipotent
[59:08] omnipotent means he's all powerful that
[59:12] mean that there's nothing you can go
[59:14] through that can defeat him Hallelujah
[59:17] there's no devil strong enough
[59:18] Hallelujah to put his hand on God and
[59:21] subdue God why because he's omnipotent
[59:24] Hallelujah and and and and and we we we
[59:28] Branch off of omnipotent to omnipresent
[59:31] meaning he's everywhere Hallelujah he
[59:34] he's he's here he's there while I'm
[59:36] preaching over here he's back home in
[59:39] Carolina dealing with Believers that
[59:40] need to be dealt with and the reason why
[59:43] he can be there is because he's
[59:45] omnicient Hallelujah he's all knowing
[59:48] being all knowing makes him omnipresent
[59:51] Hallelujah you know that's what the
[59:52] prophet of God said God being Hallelujah
[59:56] omnipresent Hallelujah he him being
[59:59] omniscient knowing all things makes him
[1:00:02] omnipresent Hallelujah so if we could
[1:00:04] just deal with that word today omnicient
[1:00:08] all knowing god now if I could say it
[1:00:12] like this church we serve a God that you
[1:00:15] can't add anything to and you can't take
[1:00:19] anything from him Hallelujah he is what
[1:00:22] he is hallelujah God hallelujah it
[1:00:25] doesn't matter what trial what
[1:00:27] tribulation you go through he doesn't
[1:00:29] have to receive some extra kind of
[1:00:31] knowledge to help your situation he's
[1:00:34] omniscient Hallelujah he knew about that
[1:00:38] situation before it ever
[1:00:41] arose and if I could say it like this he
[1:00:45] allowed it to happen because he knew
[1:00:48] what was going to come out of it that's
[1:00:50] that's the blessing behind the God we
[1:00:53] serve as believers we have to understand
[1:00:57] there's two things that God will never
[1:00:59] do first of all God cannot
[1:01:04] fail let's let's just let's just give
[1:01:07] that the proper
[1:01:13] understanding Hallelujah I don't know
[1:01:16] about your God but my God cannot fail H
[1:01:20] whatever he said he's more than able to
[1:01:23] fulfill whatever he promised it will
[1:01:26] come to pass why because he's
[1:01:29] omnicient there's nothing that can stand
[1:01:31] in his way that can stop God from
[1:01:33] fulfilling his promises in your life not
[1:01:36] a sickness Hallelujah you may get cancer
[1:01:39] but if God promis you the promised land
[1:01:42] cancer can't stop
[1:01:43] you Hallelujah why because he's
[1:01:47] omnicient he allows things to happen to
[1:01:50] make a better you out of you Hallelujah
[1:01:54] so we know God cannot fail Hallelujah
[1:01:58] second thing we must realize about God
[1:02:00] and His
[1:02:02] omnis if that's a
[1:02:04] word hallelujah God cannot
[1:02:14] lie Hallelujah church amen when you go
[1:02:18] into scripture and you see let's take
[1:02:21] scriptures that God has said about you
[1:02:23] he said I made you to have head and not
[1:02:26] the
[1:02:28] tail he can't take it back Hallelujah
[1:02:32] he's giving you a certain Authority so
[1:02:34] you have to believe it and operate in it
[1:02:37] Hallelujah see what we what happens to
[1:02:40] us we go through things and we think
[1:02:43] what we're going through is affecting
[1:02:45] God
[1:02:46] no God allows it so he can show you how
[1:02:50] great he is it's the law of contrast he
[1:02:54] said because he was a savior he allowed
[1:02:58] creation to get lost Hallelujah because
[1:03:02] he was a Healer he allowed sickness to
[1:03:05] come so he could demonstrate the
[1:03:07] attributes of healing he allowed men and
[1:03:10] women to get in bondage so he could show
[1:03:13] that he's a deliverer oh what an
[1:03:15] omnicient God we
[1:03:18] serve but things happen and we ask the
[1:03:21] question where is
[1:03:24] God he's with you all
[1:03:27] along he never gets distracted let me
[1:03:31] let's understand something you ever you
[1:03:34] you you ever watch those funny videos
[1:03:36] with those practical jokers they jump
[1:03:38] out and scare somebody like
[1:03:42] ah it doesn't matter what sin what
[1:03:45] mistake what indifference you could
[1:03:48] never catch God by
[1:03:51] surprise Satan can never catch God by
[1:03:54] surprise but you know those of us who
[1:03:56] are practical jokers we like to hide in
[1:03:58] a spot where we can't be seen and then
[1:04:01] we'll wait for a loved one to come that
[1:04:03] way and we'll jump out go boo and they
[1:04:06] go and then we have a memory of scaring
[1:04:09] them because that was something they
[1:04:11] wasn't prepared for it don't work like
[1:04:14] that with God he's always prepared for
[1:04:17] every trick of the Devil he's always
[1:04:20] prepared for every boo every a every R
[1:04:23] whatever he can do God is always is
[1:04:26] ready Hallelujah but I want to I want I
[1:04:29] really want to show you God is one of
[1:04:31] those people who reacts Hallelujah
[1:04:34] sometimes without
[1:04:38] thinking you know some people you can
[1:04:41] jump out on them and you don't get a ah
[1:04:43] you get a
[1:04:46] bam and that's how God is hallelujah
[1:04:49] Satan likes to try to jump out and boo
[1:04:51] God and God bams him God shows him he
[1:04:54] knew exact L what he was going to do
[1:04:57] where he was going to be when he was
[1:04:58] going to do it how he's going to do it
[1:05:00] why because he's
[1:05:03] God and what I'm saying tonight let's
[1:05:06] get this out of the way I'm about to
[1:05:10] close I want you to understand church
[1:05:13] where you are right now God is fully
[1:05:20] aware listen I want to read you
[1:05:22] something
[1:05:29] listen to
[1:05:31] this I want you to understand
[1:05:34] tonight everybody in here listening to
[1:05:37] the sound of my voice God planned
[1:05:41] it you didn't just hassly you know got
[1:05:45] up today and you say I think I'm going
[1:05:47] to church at 5 o'clock
[1:05:49] no what you're doing right now is you're
[1:05:53] reacting out the plan in God's mind
[1:05:58] see that ought to make a shout to
[1:06:00] realize I was in God's
[1:06:03] plan I was in God's mind Church your
[1:06:06] life doesn't belong to you Hallelujah
[1:06:10] each and every one of us our lives
[1:06:12] belong to a higher power Hallelujah
[1:06:15] there's something that dwells within us
[1:06:17] a spirit Hallelujah that's either going
[1:06:19] to produce good or going to produce evil
[1:06:22] Hallelujah but God knows who you are
[1:06:24] even at your
[1:06:26] birth Hallelujah but listen in this
[1:06:30] particular message he says your birth
[1:06:33] was pre was pre-planned he says I guess
[1:06:36] you believe that every one of you knows
[1:06:40] that our birth was pre-plan did you know
[1:06:43] that you being here never originated
[1:06:47] just at a myth or a thought it's not a
[1:06:51] coincidence that God allowed brother
[1:06:53] green to build this church why did he
[1:06:55] build it because God knew in jul in in
[1:06:59] November Hallelujah the 15th Day 2020

[1:07:06] here so you say wow God built this

[1:07:30] second but Church
[1:07:33] listen God has things pre-planned
[1:07:37] he says did you know that you being here
[1:07:39] never originated just as a myth or a
[1:07:43] thought everything was all pre-planned
[1:07:46] by God before the foundation of the
[1:07:49] world that you're here the infinite God
[1:07:52] know to be infinite Hallelujah he had to
[1:07:55] know every flea that ever would be on
[1:07:58] the earth

[1:08:09] fleas you can't count the number of
[1:08:11] fleas on that animal why because they're
[1:08:14] too small but think about it if I got an
[1:08:17] animal with fleas he has an animal with
[1:08:20] fleas he has an animal she has an animal
[1:08:22] we all have animal with fleas the Bible
[1:08:25] say God knows the number of every

[1:10:14] trials above your Corona 19 18 17
[1:10:18] whatever they want to call it above your
[1:10:21] political desires Hallelujah let's put
[1:10:24] God there amen Church my pastor said
[1:10:27] something the other day I was at church
[1:10:29] it was so profound you know as Believers
[1:10:32] we used to say we don't
[1:10:38] [Music]
[1:10:40] vote The Blood Hound is
[1:10:44] sniffing we used to say we don't vote
[1:10:47] because we believe God has everything
[1:10:48] under
[1:10:49] control but somewhere down there we're
[1:10:52] looking at things going on and we think
[1:10:54] our two sin is going to make a
[1:10:56] difference yes if I could just say it
[1:10:59] like this y'all thought this was a red
[1:11:02] state but all of a sudden it turned out
[1:11:04] to be
[1:11:06] blue it made some people very upset but
[1:11:09] you know what the omnition god already
[1:11:13] knew what was going to
[1:11:18] happen and look I'll say it like this so
[1:11:21] y'all don't Stone me I feel some of
[1:11:22] y'all got some rocks he must be a
[1:11:24] Democrat
[1:11:27] come we going we going to spiritually
[1:11:29] Stone him with mean
[1:11:34] mugs but look church when we realize God
[1:11:38] is in control all this other stuff
[1:11:40] around here doesn't matter that's right
[1:11:42] it's all going to work out for our
[1:11:45] good and I don't I don't know Biden or
[1:11:48] Trump and actually I'll be honest I hate
[1:11:51] to go on record and say this but I would
[1:11:53] love to have another four years of trump
[1:11:56] you know what now now I'm not saying
[1:11:58] that
[1:12:00] politically I'm saying that because I
[1:12:03] think he's the funniest President we
[1:12:05] ever
[1:12:09] had and I know I lost some of you there
[1:12:12] because you thought I was on your
[1:12:13] political
[1:12:14] bandwagon no I just think the man is
[1:12:19] hilarious and I love to hear him give a
[1:12:21] speech or give a talk because you notice
[1:12:24] every time he talks it has nothing to do
[1:12:26] with
[1:12:28] politics now you Trump you Trump fans
[1:12:31] are not going to admit
[1:12:33] that but I I just give you something I
[1:12:36] just look I'm G say this and I'm g go on
[1:12:38] I'll just give you a prime example of
[1:12:39] trump he they asked him about the crowds
[1:12:42] and getting the people to come out and
[1:12:44] they say Mr Trump you have the people
[1:12:45] coming out and they say what do you
[1:12:47] think Mr Biden is going to do he says
[1:12:49] you know well well you know we don't
[1:12:51] know about Joe Joe doesn't attract
[1:12:53] people he attract flies
[1:13:03] that that had nothing to do with
[1:13:08] politics but that's my man
[1:13:11] Trump the funniest president
[1:13:14] ever cuz you always say if you put a man
[1:13:17] like that who's always had what he
[1:13:19] wanted who's going to tell him what to
[1:13:22] do Hallelujah but to get back back to
[1:13:25] what I was saying we going to leave that
[1:13:27] alone we going to leave that alone cuz I
[1:13:29] know some of y'all still you ain't quite
[1:13:30] let that rock down
[1:13:32] yet Hallelujah but I'm neither democrat
[1:13:35] or republican I'm for
[1:13:39] Christ
[1:13:40] Hallelujah and listen why I'm for Christ
[1:13:45] my pastor made a statement you know you
[1:13:46] can just repeat things and you're going
[1:13:48] long with it because it sounds
[1:13:50] politically correct and you know we
[1:13:52] would say we don't vote because we
[1:13:54] believe that God you know uh has
[1:13:56] everything under control but the other
[1:13:58] day my pastor he be to break it down
[1:14:01] while he doesn't vote and he said you
[1:14:03] know why he says we know as the prophet
[1:14:05] said we ought to pray for our leaders he
[1:14:08] says but I don't vote he said you know
[1:14:10] why because I don't want to cast my vote
[1:14:13] preventure I'll be voting for what God
[1:14:15] doesn't
[1:14:19] want and I wonder how many people are
[1:14:22] going to the PO or to the ballots saying
[1:14:24] Lord I'm going to vote for who you
[1:14:27] want no we're voting for our
[1:14:31] desires but when you put it in God's
[1:14:33] hands you can't
[1:14:35] lose Hallelujah and we miss it church we
[1:14:39] miss it because we say we say hey look
[1:14:41] at the omnicient God we say oh God did
[1:14:44] so good with Reagan bless
[1:14:47] God oh he did so good with bush Senor he
[1:14:51] he he made Russia go bankrupt bless God
[1:14:56] we said oh
[1:15:02] Clinton Bush
[1:15:06] Jr Obama he's the
[1:15:13] devil yeah that's how we
[1:15:17] think but if raiken was God's choice so
[1:15:20] was
[1:15:21] Obama and so is Trump and so is Biden
[1:15:25] why because he has an agenda he has to
[1:15:28] get across according to prophecy
[1:15:31] Hallelujah Obama Hallelujah had to get
[1:15:34] in office so he could get a gaze all the
[1:15:36] rights that the Bible prophesied about
[1:15:40] you know he was the one to say okay

[1:17:42] your hope and trust in the Lord not in
[1:17:45] the systems of man because men will
[1:17:48] always fail and our God cannot fail

[1:18:46] and the conditions of the economy
[1:18:48] Hallelujah I'm living in God's economy
[1:18:55] let me move
[1:18:57] on cuz some of you will say that brother
[1:18:59] purposely came out and beat us over the
[1:19:02] head because we
[1:19:08] lost no I'm on your
[1:19:11] side we all on the side of
[1:19:15] Christ he's in
[1:19:18] control Hallelujah

[1:19:30] them I was good with five but praise
[1:19:33] God
[1:19:35] hallelujah
[1:19:36] listen your life my life was pre-planned
[1:19:39] by
[1:19:40] God now look let's deal with the
[1:19:42] scripture text let's go back to
[1:19:45] Deuteronomy do y'all put the scriptures
[1:19:47] up on the board I mean up on the put the
[1:19:50] scriptures up there for me Deuteronomy
[1:19:52] chapter
[1:19:53] 8 so y'all know I'm a
[1:19:56] walker Hallelujah a walker and a
[1:19:59] talker but look it
[1:20:01] says all the Commandments which I
[1:20:04] commanded the this day shall ye observe
[1:20:07] to do that ye may live and multiply and
[1:20:11] go in and possess the land which ye
[1:20:15] which the Lord were H swear unto your
[1:20:19] fathers look the whole reason why God
[1:20:22] gave the Commandments was so they can go
[1:20:24] possess the
[1:20:26] promise the whole reason why God gave us
[1:20:28] a message Hallelujah from a Vindicated
[1:20:31] Prophet was so we could possess our
[1:20:34] inheritance it's not the first and fight
[1:20:37] with Baptist and Methodist and all these
[1:20:39] no it's so that we know what we
[1:20:41] originally possessed Hallelujah that's
[1:20:44] why you shouldn't waste your time
[1:20:46] debating hallelujah how many times did
[1:20:49] you see God
[1:20:51] debate never they come up to ask them
[1:20:55] questions and they say hey we caught
[1:20:57] this woman in adultery Jesus
[1:21:01] say come on Jesus speak tell us what
[1:21:06] happened he said if any of you be
[1:21:08] without see cast the first
[1:21:13] stone see you know what the word is
[1:21:15] supposed to do it's supposed to make you
[1:21:18] examine
[1:21:19] yourself it's not supposed to make you
[1:21:21] feel bigger than the person that you're
[1:21:24] in the presence of but it's supposed to
[1:21:26] make you examine yourself and thank God
[1:21:29] for his
[1:21:33] grace next
[1:21:35] verse and this is where we want to get
[1:21:38] he says and thou shall remember all the
[1:21:41] way which the Lord thy God LED
[1:21:45] Thee I thought the people got trapped in
[1:21:49] the wilderness because of their
[1:21:52] Disobedience the Bible says God LED them
[1:21:57] there the omnicient god think about
[1:22:01] these people muring and complaining and
[1:22:03] we oh Lord we had some good watermelon
[1:22:06] in Egypt these watermelon were so good
[1:22:09] they didn't even have no seeds in
[1:22:14] them oh we had food and we had this and
[1:22:18] they constantly complaining and God said
[1:22:20] he led them the way of the Wilderness
[1:22:22] these 40 years
[1:22:25] but we look at it we say see they were
[1:22:27] in the wilderness cuz they were
[1:22:28] disobedient
[1:22:30] no God LED them there it was a part of
[1:22:34] his plan what was he doing listen he
[1:22:39] says these 40 years in the wilderness to
[1:22:42] Humble
[1:22:44] thee see he knew that there was some
[1:22:46] people came out who thought they were
[1:22:48] something some people came out and say
[1:22:51] ah Moses was my prophet
[1:22:54] was our Prophet I was in his meetings
[1:22:56] and I was there and he healed my father
[1:22:58] and my mother and he touched me and he
[1:23:00] just God said you know what I'm going to
[1:23:01] lead you a direction where you can be
[1:23:06] humbled and he's been doing that all
[1:23:08] this time amongst the bride Hallelujah
[1:23:11] you wonder why so many things are taking
[1:23:13] place God has been humbling his
[1:23:17] church look he said to Humble thee and
[1:23:20] to prove to you oh my not only is he
[1:23:23] humbling us but he looking at the Devil
[1:23:25] he said watch
[1:23:29] this I don't know about y'all but I know
[1:23:31] I'm going through stuff Hallelujah and I
[1:23:33] don't feel like the devil is is in
[1:23:34] control but I feel like God has his hand
[1:23:37] on it and he's telling the devil watch
[1:23:38] what he does now he's not going to quit
[1:23:41] watch he go back home and pray watch he
[1:23:44] not only not this time not only gonna
[1:23:46] pray but he gonna cry too but he ain't
[1:23:49] going to give up he going to come back
[1:23:50] to church with a more Hallelujah fervent
[1:23:53] fire
[1:23:54] h w he's
[1:23:57] omnicient he knows exactly what to do to
[1:24:00] get us on our
[1:24:05] knees not only is he humbling us but
[1:24:10] he's proving thee why what is he doing
[1:24:13] to know what was in thine
[1:24:18] heart that's what this Co and all this
[1:24:20] stuff is all about God is humbling and
[1:24:24] he's proving and he's showing what's
[1:24:27] really in people's
[1:24:32] heart and we didn't had some of the
[1:24:34] toughest some of the strongest per se
[1:24:37] leave and
[1:24:40] quit and and I have nothing to get this
[1:24:42] but they sitting home right now
[1:24:43] streaming cuz they afraid to be around
[1:24:50] y'all you know what they did just now
[1:24:52] when I said that
[1:24:59] that's the power they have at home I can
[1:25:01] say things they might not like and they
[1:25:03] pause
[1:25:05] me n we we GNA
[1:25:07] [Music]
[1:25:09] fast they G to fast forward me some
[1:25:12] people gonna stop it all together say
[1:25:14] I'll come back when you finish dealing
[1:25:15] with that
[1:25:16] part but Church what's happening is he's
[1:25:20] showing Hallelujah not to the world but
[1:25:23] to you as an individual idual where you
[1:25:26] are you don't have to prove your life to
[1:25:29] nobody look at Moses Moses when it came
[1:25:33] time for him to wrestle with dayon and
[1:25:35] core what did he do he didn't fuss and
[1:25:37] fight he went back and he told me say
[1:25:39] hey now if something happened to them it
[1:25:41] ain't my fault what was he saying I know
[1:25:44] God got my back he told Moses hold your
[1:25:48] peace and let me fight your battle God
[1:25:51] allowed it so the people can see
[1:25:54] what a Vindicated Prophet is all
[1:26:00] about he did the same thing in our
[1:26:02] prophets
[1:26:04] Ministry listen let's keep going he says
[1:26:07] he says to prove thee to know what was
[1:26:09] in thine heart whether thou would is
[1:26:11] what keep this Commandments or
[1:26:16] no and now we have people say
[1:26:19] well I don't believe brother bandam is a
[1:26:23] prophet
[1:26:24] what evidence of that do you
[1:26:26] have I hope it's not just your opinion
[1:26:30] you have to show me something
[1:26:31] scripturally that says he's not
[1:26:34] Hallelujah Revelations
[1:26:36] 10:7 you have to show me something
[1:26:39] scripturally that God used another man
[1:26:42] Hallelujah greater than
[1:26:45] him I'm not saying that other men wasn't
[1:26:48] used cuz remember he doesn't have two
[1:26:50] prophets Hallelujah on the scene at the
[1:26:53] same time on only
[1:26:58] one now let's testify what the message
[1:27:02] is the omnicient god what is the message
[1:27:06] the message is Jesus
[1:27:09] [Music]
[1:27:10] Christ we say oh no the message is the
[1:27:13] books and tapes of brother Bram let me
[1:27:15] say it again Jesus
[1:27:18] Christ what was brother Bram preaching
[1:27:20] about Jesus Christ what's on the books
[1:27:23] in
[1:27:25] Jesus Christ so what is the message all
[1:27:28] aboutus Christ y'all ain't afraid to say
[1:27:30] that is
[1:27:33] you Hallelujah the message was not about
[1:27:37] William
[1:27:39] brandham he was a vessel that God used
[1:27:43] and God hallelujah used him just like he
[1:27:46] used John the Baptist to introduce
[1:27:50] himself and as long as there's a veil
[1:27:53] all you can see is what God did in a
[1:27:55] prophet's life but once that Veil is
[1:27:57] taken away you can see that it was
[1:27:59] Christ all
[1:28:04] along and until you get there you find
[1:28:08] yourself always defending
[1:28:12] yourself but the best way I testify this
[1:28:16] message is I
[1:28:18] tell what it did for
[1:28:21] me I don't talk about boino Canyon and
[1:28:25] sunset Mountain and oh my we got to go
[1:28:27] there and we got now I'm going to say
[1:28:28] this and it might offend some of y'all
[1:28:30] but you know what several years ago two
[1:28:33] friends of mine I came out here and they
[1:28:36] said hey you want to go to Sabino I was
[1:28:37] like yeah let's go let's go cuz you know
[1:28:39] you don't R about this stuff all your
[1:28:41] life and you're like yeah yeah yeah I
[1:28:42] want to go I'm excited yeah yeah yeah
[1:28:45] you know you hear people say oh man when
[1:28:47] I stepped on the mountain I felt the
[1:28:50] anointing so you know I'm like yeah yeah
[1:28:52] I want to go I want to fill the prop
[1:28:54] feel like I can't
[1:28:56] wait so we get there and it's around
[1:28:59] this time of year we get there and we're
[1:29:01] going up the mountain Hallelujah you
[1:29:03] know I'm thinking about all these all
[1:29:04] the things I've heard where people say
[1:29:06] that the anointing and the angel and you
[1:29:08] know and the sword in his hand and all
[1:29:11] these things and the more I'm going I'm
[1:29:13] going I think it's about 45 minute hike
[1:29:14] something like that might be a little
[1:29:16] less you know we're going up then the
[1:29:17] Sun comes out and we're going up I say
[1:29:19] hey give me some of that water I'm
[1:29:21] drinking the water we're going up then I
[1:29:23] got in my mind what the man at the
[1:29:25] trolley said look out for rattlesnakes
[1:29:27] so now I'm watching for rattlesnakes I'm
[1:29:29] hot I'm drinking some water and then I
[1:29:31] got to remember something else he said
[1:29:32] he said there also mountain lions so now
[1:29:34] I'm looking for I'm looking for uh I'm
[1:29:36] looking for rattlesnakes I'm looking for
[1:29:38] mountain lions now I'm going the same
[1:29:40] place the prophet
[1:29:48] went and I'm going up the
[1:29:51] mountain give me some more water
[1:29:54] mountain
[1:29:55] lions R
[1:29:58] snakes then the brother say we here I
[1:30:00] said where we
[1:30:03] at he said we here Eagle Rock this where
[1:30:05] the Prophet was I said ain't nothing on
[1:30:07] that rock my pictures got a eagle thing
[1:30:10] written across
[1:30:13] it am I
[1:30:16] right all right the omniscient God I'm
[1:30:19] saying this for a reason in church I get
[1:30:22] there and I'm thinking
[1:30:24] I'm there at the same spot the prophet
[1:30:26] was and I got all these things in my
[1:30:28] mind people say the anointing and all
[1:30:30] this and no doubt they may have felt
[1:30:32] something but as for
[1:30:34] me only thing I felt was
[1:30:37] tired and
[1:30:39] hot and a little agitated because I'm
[1:30:42] looking for rattlesnakes and mountain
[1:30:45] lions I didn't feel what the prophet
[1:30:47] felt and now he comes the
[1:30:51] devil he says oh
[1:30:54] he said look your picture doesn't have
[1:30:56] the same thing there's no writing on
[1:30:59] this rock there's nothing here I wonder
[1:31:02] is anything else
[1:31:11] true little little Southern young man
[1:31:15] from South Carolina believing this
[1:31:17] message so excited to walk in the places
[1:31:20] the prophet have walked but the
[1:31:22] omnicient god already already knew that
[1:31:25] was going to happen to
[1:31:27] me but right in that moment where the
[1:31:30] devil came in and he begin to serenate
[1:31:33] my ears he tried to tell me that all of
[1:31:37] it is faking none of it is real in those
[1:31:40] area in those times you have to be still
[1:31:43] and know that he's God and church in
[1:31:45] that moment I can remember standing
[1:31:47] there hallelujah look at the type the
[1:31:50] two brothers that tuck me up the
[1:31:51] mountain one was named Samuel
[1:31:54] a prophet the other one was named Israel
[1:31:57] a nation and you had me the
[1:32:02] bride
[1:32:04] Hallelujah and we were all there
[1:32:06] standing on the rock hallelujah and the
[1:32:08] devil is saying to me I wonder if
[1:32:11] anything else is real because the
[1:32:14] pictures you have doesn't resemble us
[1:32:16] and God Hallelujah in his sovereignty
[1:32:19] the all knowing god the omniscient God
[1:32:22] knew that that moment was going want to
[1:32:24] play out the way it played out and in
[1:32:26] the sweetness of his voice he says
[1:32:28] blessed is he who believe and have not
[1:32:31] seen Hallelujah glory and church I went
[1:32:35] back down that mountain just as much of
[1:32:37] a Believer as I was when I went up even
[1:32:41] though I didn't have the same experience
[1:32:44] the prophet
[1:32:46] had W that didn't change that this
[1:32:50] message was real or that God is real why
[1:32:53] because God spoke to me in my crucial
[1:32:56] moment why because he knew it was going
[1:32:58] to
[1:33:01] happen he's
[1:33:04] omniscient and from that
[1:33:08] day I stopped chasing
[1:33:13] relics I stopped trying to walk the walk
[1:33:17] the prophet
[1:33:19] walked but I begin to develop my own
[1:33:22] testimony with this word
[1:33:24] with this
[1:33:25] message because you may not you may fail
[1:33:28] to believe it but that's what the
[1:33:31] prophet
[1:33:32] wanted he wanted all of us to have our
[1:33:34] own personal relationship with
[1:33:39] Christ
[1:33:40] Hallelujah but
[1:33:43] look don't get nervous I'm about to
[1:33:48] close God is all
[1:33:51] knowing he led them to we the
[1:33:54] Wilderness and even when he got there he
[1:33:57] said you know what he said I'm going to
[1:33:59] harden Pharaoh's
[1:34:02] heart so that y'all leaving won't be
[1:34:05] easy why so I can show y'all how great I
[1:34:11] am think about it Moses will come and
[1:34:14] say Let My People Go Pharaoh said no I
[1:34:16] don't even know if there's a God I'm God
[1:34:19] and then God will do something create
[1:34:21] frauds and Pharaoh say okay I'm letting
[1:34:23] the people go then Moses come back he
[1:34:24] said no I ain't letting him
[1:34:26] go you know that made the people very
[1:34:28] uneasy and it made the people question
[1:34:31] whether Moses was called or
[1:34:35] not who was doing it
[1:34:40] God God was controlling the emotions of
[1:34:44] the
[1:34:45] people he's still doing it
[1:34:48] today you may think oh brother DS this
[1:34:51] is happening that is happening God
[1:34:54] is in
[1:34:55] control listen
[1:34:59] Church to the to the to the text at
[1:35:03] hand he said Sarah's going to have a
[1:35:06] towel and in in the proper time and
[1:35:08] season so is
[1:35:11] Rebecca and it
[1:35:13] says the two not even born
[1:35:18] yet not even doing good or
[1:35:21] evil Jacob have I loveed
[1:35:24] Esau have I
[1:35:26] hated now how could God love somebody
[1:35:29] and hate somebody before they even
[1:35:32] born because he knows what they're going
[1:35:34] to turn out to be he knows their desires
[1:35:38] and he didn't hate Esau as in you I
[1:35:41] can't stand you I hate your guts
[1:35:44] no he knew that his ways wasn't going to
[1:35:48] resemble the ways of Christ so that's
[1:35:51] what it means when he God says he hate
[1:35:53] that Hallelujah just like he loves the
[1:35:56] he loves The Sinner but he hates
[1:35:59] sin Hall he loves that person but he
[1:36:02] hates their
[1:36:04] actions that's what it means church but
[1:36:07] let's go into it why did he love Jacob
[1:36:11] and hate Esau according to the prophet
[1:36:13] Esau was a better
[1:36:15] man Esau he hunted and he he bought his
[1:36:19] daddy food and he was more of the man
[1:36:22] and Jacob was like a little sister boy
[1:36:23] sitting at home learning how to
[1:36:26] cook Hallelujah but you know that was a
[1:36:29] plan of
[1:36:30] God because something was going to arise
[1:36:34] where Jacob was going to have a dish
[1:36:36] that was going to be needed at a certain
[1:36:37] time of his
[1:36:39] life Hallelujah so one learned how to
[1:36:42] hunt and how to fish and the other one
[1:36:44] learned how to
[1:36:46] cook two twin boys hallelujah oh my
[1:36:50] church and then he gets to a place where
[1:36:52] Jacob Hallelujah he starts to have a
[1:36:55] desire for Esau's Birthright where did
[1:36:58] that come from God's
[1:37:02] prophecy the Elder will serve the young
[1:37:05] and them boys not even knowing what's
[1:37:08] happening to them what's happening they
[1:37:10] are playing out God's thoughts and don't
[1:37:12] even realize
[1:37:13] it they're getting in position
[1:37:16] Hallelujah to fulfill what God has said
[1:37:19] he's omniscient church and now Jacob h
[1:37:23] Esau go we know the story Esau goes
[1:37:25] hunting he comes back hungry and Jacob
[1:37:27] has made up a dish or whatever he tells
[1:37:29] Esau say Hey you hungry he said I got
[1:37:31] something for you and this right here
[1:37:34] hallelujah it doesn't even have any
[1:37:35] preservatives it's
[1:37:43] plant-based this right here make it feel
[1:37:45] real good plantbase and he saw was like
[1:37:49] oh yeah I want something he said oh oh
[1:37:50] oh oh oh before I give you something we
[1:37:54] got to make a
[1:37:56] deal give me your Birthright or better
[1:37:59] that sell me your Birthright for this
[1:38:01] food he says I don't care about no
[1:38:03] Birthright man I'm
[1:38:05] hungry what was that that was God
[1:38:08] getting his words in position Jacob have
[1:38:11] I loved Esau have I hated both nor doing
[1:38:15] good or evil in the womb of the mother
[1:38:18] but now they're playing out God's
[1:38:20] thoughts Hallelujah and now Church from
[1:38:22] there Esau has given the birthright to
[1:38:24] Jacob and Jacob is like hey I got to
[1:38:26] convince daddy now to lay his hands and
[1:38:28] bless me so Jacob gets anointed
[1:38:31] Hallelujah to lie to his
[1:38:35] daddy you mean to tell me it was the
[1:38:37] will of
[1:38:39] God for this boy to lie and deceive his
[1:38:42] daddy it was God's
[1:38:47] plan oh my you mean to tell me God will
[1:38:51] let a lie arise to get his plan across
[1:38:56] remember Hallelujah there was a prophecy
[1:38:58] that went forth about Ahab and Jezebel
[1:39:00] and and you know at that time or
[1:39:02] whatever and and God was saying what can
[1:39:05] I do to get this prophecy to come to
[1:39:07] pass and it says a Lyon Spirit came out
[1:39:09] of the pits of hell and said God use
[1:39:13] me he said I'll be a lying spirit in the
[1:39:16] mouth of the Prophet to prophesy to get
[1:39:19] Ahab in position to fulfill what the
[1:39:22] prophet said
[1:39:25] so things happen sometimes and we may
[1:39:27] look at it with a carnal eye but it's
[1:39:30] God fulfilling his word because he's all
[1:39:34] knowing and now Church from there
[1:39:37] Hallelujah Jacob goes and look now you
[1:39:40] think about
[1:39:42] this Jacob was considered to be a man of
[1:39:46] God
[1:39:51] huh when they quote the fathers h of
[1:39:55] History what do they say Abraham Isaac
[1:39:59] and who
[1:40:02] Jacob now I want you to picture this
[1:40:05] jacob goes and get some
[1:40:07] hair and put some sticky stuff on his
[1:40:11] arms puts it all over his arms all over
[1:40:14] us and you know God really his name
[1:40:18] wasn't Jacob it was
[1:40:19] Israel he was a prince but in that
[1:40:23] moment moment he was a
[1:40:25] Shyer God knew Hallelujah he had that
[1:40:28] trickery and Ling and all that stuff in
[1:40:30] him when he was
[1:40:32] born and he still used
[1:40:36] them my oh my we look at people and we
[1:40:40] say there'll never be nothing Church
[1:40:42] hold up be you know Peter he
[1:40:47] lied H he denied the Lord three times
[1:40:51] and the last time he cussed everybody
[1:40:53] out
[1:40:54] out now we if somebody do that in the
[1:40:57] church we be like Ser
[1:41:03] seed but let me tell you something
[1:41:05] before he got there he cut a man's ear
[1:41:09] off now I don't know about you I don't
[1:41:12] it's just it's just something about this
[1:41:14] atmosphere in this church where it just
[1:41:17] it's just so
[1:41:20] pleasant well I feel like I can preach
[1:41:23] for for hours but I know I

[1:41:28] quality of the spirit
[1:41:30] here
[1:41:32] church can you can you can you can you
[1:41:35] just picture

[1:41:45] fulfilled look at what he sacrificed he
[1:41:49] sacrificed his relationship with his
[1:41:51] brother
[1:41:54] he wasn't like some of us who grew up
[1:41:55] with our siblings Jacob didn't feel that
[1:41:58] he ran from his because his brother
[1:42:00] wanted to kill
[1:42:01] him he missed out on time with his
[1:42:05] father and his mother why because he was
[1:42:07] fulfilling God's
[1:42:09] thoughts Church you don't know what it
[1:42:12] means sometimes to sacrifice Hallelujah
[1:42:15] to live out God's will for your
[1:42:19] life and you look at Jacob see see don't

[1:42:24] thought God already

[1:44:47] Parts she already knew the mystery
[1:44:49] behind Jacob Hallelujah and for for her
[1:44:53] to be walking around knowing what his
[1:44:56] wife would know was not right so he had
[1:44:58] to keep her as a wife Hallelujah because
[1:45:01] she had already gone in the bed
[1:45:04] chamber so no matter what somebody else
[1:45:07] may say about you if Christ has taken
[1:45:09] you into the chamber he can't give you
[1:45:13] backen Hallelujah he can't give you back
[1:45:16] you belong to him no matter Jew or
[1:45:19] Gentile if he takes you in the chamber
[1:45:22] you are are

[1:45:26] Hallelujah so now he says okay I'm going
[1:45:28] work another seven years just so I can
[1:45:30] get a he works another seven years and
[1:45:33] he gets a in church look at the
[1:45:34] omnicient god remember God told Abraham
[1:45:37] that there are nations inside of you
[1:45:40] there's a there's a there's a whole
[1:45:42] Hallelujah uh tribe of Israel inside of
[1:45:45] you Hallelujah where is it going to come
[1:45:46] forth look the omnicient God now Jacob
[1:45:49] Hallelujah he's married between he's
[1:45:51] married to two sisters one can get
[1:45:53] pregnant and the other one can't and
[1:45:56] Leah is popping them out like bubble
[1:46:00] bubbles she's having baby after baby and
[1:46:03] Rachel gets mad and she says you know
[1:46:05] what I'm going to give her my hands made
[1:46:08] and now Jacob is having babies by the
[1:46:09] handmade having babies by Leah and Leah
[1:46:12] gets mad she said you know what I'm
[1:46:13] going to give him my hands made and now
[1:46:15] he has her hands made he has Leah he has
[1:46:18] Rachel and her hands made now you got
[1:46:20] four women fighting over him
[1:46:25] look like total chaos doesn't
[1:46:27] it but out of all that what we would say
[1:46:31] foolishness came the tries of
[1:46:37] Israel it was the pl of God God knew
[1:46:41] that there was a reuin and a Simeon and
[1:46:43] Leah
[1:46:45] Hallelujah so he had to let Jacob marry
[1:46:48] her he knew that there was a Joseph
[1:46:50] Hallelujah and Benjamin in Rachel
[1:46:55] and the other boys in the handmaids so
[1:46:57] God allowed this stuff to happen why
[1:46:59] because he's all
[1:47:02] knowing
[1:47:04] Hallelujah
[1:47:08] church God allows things to take place
[1:47:11] Hallelujah to get his point
[1:47:14] across in my
[1:47:18] closing I could read a whole lot of
[1:47:20] other stuff but I think you get my point
[1:47:24] that God is in
[1:47:26] control and whether we want to believe
[1:47:28] it or not in times like this some of us
[1:47:33] he's
[1:47:34] humbling some of us he's proving some of
[1:47:38] us he's showing what's really in your
[1:47:42] heart but look we
[1:47:46] know
[1:47:49] Joseph Joseph was born
[1:47:53] and he was loved by his father
[1:47:56] amen he had all these other boys but
[1:47:59] Joseph was loved because he came out of
[1:48:03] a union of a woman that he really
[1:48:05] loved so that love poured over to his
[1:48:09] son and now his older brothers are
[1:48:12] looking at him and they're like man we
[1:48:13] hate your
[1:48:15] guts simply because he's loved by the
[1:48:17] father but that wasn't good
[1:48:20] enough that love had to turn
[1:48:24] hatred and I'll tell you how H he had a
[1:48:27] dream one day that everybody was going
[1:48:30] to his brother was going to bow down and
[1:48:32] him just being uh who he was gullible
[1:48:35] and green he went to his brother say hey
[1:48:37] y'all know what y'all gonna bow down to
[1:48:39] me one
[1:48:41] day and his brother's
[1:48:44] like let me get him and they're like no
[1:48:48] let me get him he's like I'm just
[1:48:50] telling y'all what God showed me
[1:48:53] and then he has another dream and he
[1:48:55] goes now his brothers can't stand his
[1:48:56] guts then he comes back with another
[1:48:58] dream he say hey Mom Dad y'all in this
[1:49:00] one y'all going to bow down too and his
[1:49:03] daddy rebukes him he like boy who you
[1:49:06] think you
[1:49:07] are you know his brothers can't stand
[1:49:09] his guts but that had to go from dislike
[1:49:13] to
[1:49:14] hatred so one day he his dad because
[1:49:17] he's in love with him he he makes him a
[1:49:19] coat of many
[1:49:21] colors and I'm GNA take some of y'all
[1:49:23] brothers back right quick he takes this
[1:49:26] coat and he puts this coat on not
[1:49:29] Hallelujah outside but in the midst of
[1:49:31] all his
[1:49:33] brothers and he takes this coat and he
[1:49:35] put it on and it's like he got on a Ric
[1:49:37] Flair robe
[1:49:39] [Music]
[1:49:55] I know some of y'all are afraid to
[1:49:59] laugh cuz you used to being serious all
[1:50:02] the time oh that brother he's cracking
[1:50:03] jokes and he's this and he's that hey
[1:50:05] why we can't come to church and have a
[1:50:06] good
[1:50:09] time this ain't your job this the house
[1:50:12] of
[1:50:13] God and God loves to see us smiling and
[1:50:17] enjoying the
[1:50:20] word listen church I do that stuff on
[1:50:23] purpose for the young people cuz they
[1:50:25] can see that we all in a bunch of old
[1:50:28] folus that we love what we talking about
[1:50:31] Hallelujah we love this gospel amen and
[1:50:34] you know the problem we've made we've
[1:50:36] made serving God a ritual and we wonder
[1:50:40] why our kids don't want to come to
[1:50:41] church because they're looking at you
[1:50:43] doing us doing Us in church every time
[1:50:45] you
[1:50:51] come for a whole
[1:50:54] hour and you're like come on son come on
[1:50:56] daughter give God some praise and they
[1:51:02] like I will if you
[1:51:07] will honestly they watching
[1:51:10] us why would they want something that we
[1:51:13] not happy about why would they want
[1:51:16] something that we don't express no Joy
[1:51:18] about they looking at us like you want
[1:51:20] me to serve your God and your church and
[1:51:23] you have no
[1:51:25] excitement man I'm going home and play
[1:51:27] my
[1:51:30] Xbox but church God allowed all that to
[1:51:32] happen you know why made his brothers go
[1:51:36] from disliking him to hating him why
[1:51:39] because there was a caravan
[1:51:42] coming there's a caravan coming and
[1:51:44] according to the promise of God the
[1:51:46] omnition god Jacob H Joseph belonged up
[1:51:49] there were Pharaoh Hallelujah so now he
[1:51:52] Hallelujah he gets thrown in the pit by
[1:51:54] his brothers his brothers throw him in
[1:51:56] the pit Hallelujah they sell him into
[1:51:57] slavery why because he's also a type of
[1:52:02] Christ Hallelujah we look at stuff we be
[1:52:05] like what's going on is God fulfilling
[1:52:07] his
[1:52:09] word hallelujah and now Church he's get
[1:52:12] in the Caravan then he finds himself at
[1:52:14] parer's house why part ofer's house
[1:52:16] because paa's wife has a lie to tell on
[1:52:21] him Hallelujah so he spends his time
[1:52:24] there and she's she's following him
[1:52:26] every day
[1:52:30] Joseph
[1:52:32] Joseph you know read your Bible it
[1:52:34] wasn't just one day she pressed him and
[1:52:37] pressed him and pressed him but that man
[1:52:39] had
[1:52:40] Integrity H and if you really watch God
[1:52:44] will let you go through trials to show
[1:52:46] the devil that's not really who you
[1:52:49] are he'll let you be tested by the
[1:52:52] things you've
[1:52:54] overcome and now Joseph is being tested
[1:52:57] by lust because there was no lust inside
[1:52:59] of
[1:53:00] him Hallelujah and God is proving a
[1:53:03] point he was being tested by a lie told
[1:53:05] on him why because he was
[1:53:08] honest he was being tested by his hatred
[1:53:11] of his brothers why because he loved
[1:53:15] them God is a god of contrast he testes
[1:53:19] you by the opposite of what you are and
[1:53:22] in our church parer's wife tells a lie
[1:53:25] Hallelujah that Joseph was trying to uh
[1:53:28] sleep with her and lie with her which
[1:53:30] was all a lie why because Joseph had to
[1:53:32] go to jail why because the Baker and
[1:53:34] Butler were
[1:53:37] coming God is all
[1:53:39] knowing he had everything set up
[1:53:43] Hallelujah and you know what Joseph
[1:53:46] didn't know what was going
[1:53:48] on this is the point I want to make
[1:53:53] Church his
[1:53:56] brothers PFA and his wife the Jailer all
[1:54:00] these people did him wrong and he didn't
[1:54:02] have a clue but from the time he was
[1:54:05] thrown in the pit the gift of God kept
[1:54:08] working in his
[1:54:10] life even though Hallelujah he wasn't in
[1:54:13] the best place that he wanted to be is
[1:54:16] still didn't stop him from being used by
[1:54:19] God what about us when we go through
[1:54:22] things we come to church mad and upset
[1:54:24] Hallelujah who's in control of your life
[1:54:27] God or the
[1:54:31] devil if it's God you ought to still be
[1:54:34] able to come here and worship and be
[1:54:37] happy the Bible says C count it all joy
[1:54:41] when you fall into D's
[1:54:45] Temptation now Church he's in jail he
[1:54:48] comes to bacon Butler and he tells them
[1:54:50] one what are you going to die what are
[1:54:52] you going to be restored
[1:54:54] Hallelujah and then one dies and the
[1:54:56] other one I mean both of them are called
[1:54:58] out one dies the other one restore you
[1:55:00] know what Jason say he said hey don't
[1:55:02] forget about me what do they do
[1:55:07] forget everything that he asked of
[1:55:11] others they didn't return to
[1:55:13] him but God continued to work in his
[1:55:18] life what was he doing he was building
[1:55:21] character
[1:55:23] because he had something way greater
[1:55:25] than he could experience in his father's
[1:55:27] house Hallelujah now Hallelujah Pharaoh
[1:55:30] has a dream and I believe it was the the
[1:55:33] the butler whichever one was restored
[1:55:35] he's restored and he says hey I remember
[1:55:38] my
[1:55:39] mistake there's a jail there's a man in
[1:55:41] your jail who can interpret dreams he
[1:55:44] said go get them go wash them up and
[1:55:45] bring them before me Hallelujah now look
[1:55:49] what's going to happen to Joseph he's
[1:55:51] going to get cleaned
[1:55:52] washed put in good clothes put a ring on
[1:55:55] his
[1:55:56] hand stand before the
[1:55:59] king listen Church your trials should
[1:56:02] put you in position where you're
[1:56:03] standing before the
[1:56:08] king
[1:56:10] Hallelujah but we're missing it you know
[1:56:12] why because all we can think about is
[1:56:13] the
[1:56:16] devil the devil look the devil at oh
[1:56:20] lord the devil the devil the devil some
[1:56:22] of you get down in prayer and you pray

[1:57:06] to pray you got to exalt him you don't
[1:57:09] go into prayer talking about his
[1:57:15] adversary now before I
[1:57:20] close take interprets the dream tells
[1:57:24] Pharaoh exactly what's going to happen
[1:57:26] why God
[1:57:29] knew he had it all planned to get Joseph
[1:57:33] where he was supposed to be Hallelujah
[1:57:35] then Pharaoh says hey the only thing is
[1:57:36] going to separate us is our seat but you
[1:57:38] going to run this whole country
[1:57:41] Hallelujah you going to run everything
[1:57:42] Hal so who was really the king Pharaoh
[1:57:45] or
[1:57:46] Joseph Joseph was Hallelujah GL
[1:57:51] Hallelujah oh my and church we know how
[1:57:54] the story plays out you know his
[1:57:56] brothers they come back and all these
[1:57:58] different things and now they don't even
[1:57:59] recognize who he is God I want you to
[1:58:02] understand something if you live right
[1:58:04] Hallelujah God will put every trial
[1:58:08] every situation back in your
[1:58:12] hands but the only way he'll do that is
[1:58:15] if you have the
[1:58:18] character look now he's running the
[1:58:21] whole country
[1:58:23] can you imagine how pfa's wife and PFA
[1:58:26] felt every time they saw Joseph
[1:58:29] coming Joseph prob was coming this way
[1:58:31] they
[1:58:34] say because she know she told a
[1:58:38] lie think about the Jailer the Jailer
[1:58:40] may have knock this food over or
[1:58:43] something Joseph come down there
[1:58:47] he and now all of his brothers
[1:58:50] Hallelujah they in his Pres
[1:58:52] and they start to LY daddy said don't
[1:58:54] kill
[1:58:56] us he didn't say
[1:58:59] that they're
[1:59:02] afraid one of my favorite scriptures and
[1:59:05] I say this about myself come on
[1:59:06] musicians I'm
[1:59:13] closing man it must be a Sunday night
[1:59:15] ain't nobody said brother keep preaching
[1:59:22] Hallelujah but Church think about it the
[1:59:26] prophet of God
[1:59:27] said power without character is what
[1:59:33] satanic so as you going through things
[1:59:36] Hallelujah God is trying to put you in
[1:59:38] position where you can have the
[1:59:40] character
[1:59:42] Hallelujah to fulfill the power of His
[1:59:45] word but without that character he'll
[1:59:49] never give it to you and now he put
[1:59:51] every everybody that ever did Joseph any
[1:59:54] wrong back in his
[1:59:56] hands Piper Piper's wife the jeller the
[1:59:59] baker the butler everybody all of his
[2:00:01] brothers everything's back in his hand
[2:00:03] and his brothers come back after after
[2:00:05] after uh their father die after Israel
[2:00:08] die they come back and they tell Joseph
[2:00:09] they say hey Joseph daddy said don't
[2:00:11] kill us now that he's departed they were
[2:00:14] lying he didn't have no conversation
[2:00:16] with them about that it was their own
[2:00:19] fears of what they did now rising up the
[2:00:23] haunt them you know what that's called
[2:00:26] condemnation of the
[2:00:28] heart that's why Christ said if your
[2:00:31] heart condemn you he said I'm greater
[2:00:33] than your
[2:00:37] heart and Joseph he says I believe he's
[2:00:40] in chapter 50 he tells his brothers he
[2:00:44] says
[2:00:45] hey they say they they they say daddy
[2:00:48] said don't kill us he says Hey fear not
[2:00:51] he says Fe not am I not in the place of
[2:00:56] God I want everybody to hear this and
[2:01:01] understand where you are right now is
[2:01:04] exactly where God wants you to
[2:01:11] be now how you go through it from here
[2:01:14] is how much you yield to
[2:01:18] God because one thing about God you can
[2:01:21] go easy way or you can go a hard way
[2:01:25] what do you mean a perfect will
[2:01:27] permissible
[2:01:28] will and one thing about the Holy Ghost
[2:01:31] the Holy Ghost is a bounty hunter with
[2:01:33] your
[2:01:34] picture he already knows who you are he
[2:01:37] already has the weapons to bring you and
[2:01:39] put you in submission but you know what
[2:01:41] a bounty hunter does when they find the
[2:01:43] person that that that that they're
[2:01:45] chasing they go to that person and they
[2:01:47] say hey Mr so and so sister so and so
[2:01:50] you could either come quietly or I can
[2:01:52] pistol whip you and drag you behind this
[2:01:54] horse but you going to
[2:01:56] come the thing of it is which one we
[2:01:59] want to do do we want to come God's
[2:02:01] perfect will or do we want to come his
[2:02:03] permissible
[2:02:05] will because he's all knowing he's he
[2:02:08] already knows what we're going to
[2:02:11] do
[2:02:12] Hallelujah so when things happen in your
[2:02:15] life and situations look tough and you
[2:02:17] might be saying Lord why am I going
[2:02:19] through this why am I that why this why
[2:02:21] that just remember he has it all under
[2:02:26] control and the faster we can realize
[2:02:28] that the quicker we can have peace with
[2:02:32] it we spend so much time condemning
[2:02:35] ourselves when God has given us a blood
[2:02:38] Covenant Hallelujah he's giv us a token
[2:02:42] where we ought to already be walking
[2:02:44] above that trial but we spend so much
[2:02:47] time oh the Devil May me do that Devil
[2:02:50] May me that the devil oh God I'm so
[2:02:53] sorry the devil made me this and the
[2:02:54] devil going to God say they lying on
[2:02:57] me they lying on me hey you know I can't
[2:02:59] do but what you allow me to do they
[2:03:01] lying on me I ain't did all
[2:03:04] that that's what the devil is doing he
[2:03:08] can only do what you allow him to do and
[2:03:11] better yet he can only do what God
[2:03:13] allows him to do that's the only Power
[2:03:16] he got and where does it start with the
[2:03:18] acceptance of your thoughts
[2:03:23] like I was saying earlier I was telling
[2:03:24] a
[2:03:25] testimony hallelujah look I'mma tell her

[2:05:40] adult you know I I went out with some
[2:05:43] friends and went to a cookout you know
[2:05:45] and because I was raised right I was
[2:05:48] green I ain't know things about cookouts
[2:05:49] I went there to eat you know had all
[2:05:52] this all these different let me say it
[2:05:54] like this all these different kind of
[2:05:56] beverages on the
[2:06:02] table so I'm I'm I'm looking at all this
[2:06:04] stuff and I never tasted this and tasted
[2:06:06] that so in my mind I'm saying hey I'mma
[2:06:09] just taste it I'm not going to indulge
[2:06:12] I'mma just taste it curiosity so I'm
[2:06:14] tasting this tasting that tasting this

[2:06:18] going to happen to
[2:06:20] me you know what happened to me I'm
[2:06:23] tasting and I'm tasting and I'm tasting
[2:06:25] and I'm tasting by the time I finish
[2:06:31] tasting and I got so
[2:06:35] sick now the reason why I'm telling you
[2:06:37] this CU I want to show you your parents
[2:06:39] the power of your
[2:06:41] prayers church I got so sick to think
[2:06:45] about it me and my mom we always was
[2:06:48] tight even though I was living the life
[2:06:51] of a s
[2:06:52] Hallelujah she didn't treat me like it
[2:06:55] she treated me like I was still her son
[2:06:58] and that's where we mess up as parents
[2:06:59] we don't see our children living the
[2:07:01] life we want them to live and we
[2:07:03] excommunicate them how are they going to
[2:07:05] see the love of God if they don't
[2:07:07] fellowship with
[2:07:09] you Church
[2:07:11] Hallelujah so I called her I was like oh
[2:07:14] my me and my brother was staying
[2:07:15] together I like oh my I got so sick last
[2:07:17] night I went to a cookout and they had
[2:07:19] all this stuff on the table and I just
[2:07:20] wanted to taste it and I I just wanted
[2:07:21] to see what it was like and she was like
[2:07:24] yeah I
[2:07:28] know and she says I had a vision of you
[2:07:31] standing at that table and God showed me
[2:07:34] all of the beverages on that table and I
[2:07:37] said to God show him that drinking is
[2:07:41] not for
[2:07:43] him so the reason why I got sick was
[2:07:46] because God was answering her
[2:07:49] prayers now can you imagine you going
[2:07:51] through something hallu for in that
[2:07:54] magnitude because God is mindful of your
[2:07:59] prayers and from that moment I said i'
[2:08:02] never let that happen to me again what
[2:08:05] was happening God was answering her
[2:08:07] prayers Hallelujah so church I say I say
[2:08:11] that to say just to give you a little
[2:08:12] background on how I was raised young
[2:08:15] people hallu so now in this particular
[2:08:18] time she was uh uh the co and things
[2:08:21] happen and and she goes to the hospital
[2:08:24] well well first she was at home for
[2:08:26] maybe she said for about two weeks she
[2:08:28] was trying to fight it off praying and
[2:08:30] different things and so forth and my

[2:08:49] not going to go and then be like oh we
[2:08:51] don't know what's going to happen if we
[2:08:52] pray we know what's going to happen
[2:08:54] God's going to
[2:08:56] deliver so anyway she drops mom off and
[2:09:00] and I'm like oh Lord why did you do that
[2:09:03] church when this first started it was a
[2:09:06] complete atmosphere of
[2:09:09] death they put people in a hospital room
[2:09:12] and they isolate them from all their
[2:09:14] loved ones from any kind of contact from
[2:09:17] from from any kind of Life they're in an
[2:09:20] atmosphere of Darkness
[2:09:22] now if you a if you ain't got God what
[2:09:24] else you going to do you're going to go
[2:09:27] crazy and you're going to start to
[2:09:29] believe what the people are
