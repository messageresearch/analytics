[0:30] ago and it's still marching forward and
[0:32] it's marching forward with me. It's
[0:35] marching forward with you. The same
[0:37] spirit that was on the apostles is the

[3:06] His truth is maring
[3:12] on.
[3:14] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? Can you imagine
[3:18] those soldiers walking into battle
[3:22] with their musketss in their hands and
[3:24] the cannons behind them and the cannons
[3:26] in front of them and the enemy there?
[3:28] Can you imagine going into battle and
[3:32] with that song ringing in their ears
[3:36] knowing that they are fighting for
[3:38] something much greater than they are.
[3:40] They are fighting for freedom. They're
[3:43] fighting for life.
[3:45] and walking into battle with that song
[3:49] on their minds as we are this morning.
[3:51] One more time, let's do just the voices
[3:52] again.
[3:54] &gt;&gt; Glory,

[4:25] Maring
[4:27] on.
[4:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. Do you believe it?
[4:35] Amen. You can take your seats. Thank
[4:38] you. Wow. We could think we've already
[4:41] had church. That was good. Good worship.
[4:45] Good worship service this morning. Wow.
[4:48] And I'm I'm glad that I didn't know he
[4:50] was going to, but I'm glad that Josiah
[4:51] sang that song because I want to talk
[4:54] about uh having courage in in our life.
[4:59] First, Bruce, good to see you, man. I I
[5:02] met this guy outside. He rode up on his
[5:04] bike and and um saw he was in a suit. I
[5:08] said said, "Brother, you look sharp."
[5:10] And he says, "Yeah." He says, "Um,
[5:12] coming to church." He says, "Uh, I want
[5:14] to see what this new pastor's all
[5:15] about."
[5:17] [Laughter]
[5:19] I said, "Well, you're talking to him."
[5:22] He's like, "Oh, okay.
[5:25] It's good to have you, bro. Good to have
[5:26] you in in church." Brother David Savalo,

[6:22] didn't stand up. You're tired. Klehano
[6:25] was out there with his new leg running
[6:28] uh, running miles this morning. Is the

[6:52] Good to see you.
[6:55] Oh, man. It's like
[6:58] got all of our people here. It feels It
[7:00] feels really really good.
[7:03] Let's let's open our Bibles. And I sent
[7:07] out a text last night that we're going
[7:09] to stay in. Obviously, we're going to
[7:11] stay in this sermon on the mount. And
[7:14] let's start with where we left off with
[7:17] last Sunday. Matthew chapter 5 verse 10.
[7:22] And I want to say a few more words about
[7:25] these scriptures. I talked a little bit
[7:26] about it last week and then we'll move
[7:29] on.
[7:31] Matthew chapter 5 verse 10 it reads like
[7:33] like this.
[7:36] Blessed are they which are persecuted
[7:38] for righteousness righteousness sake for
[7:41] theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed
[7:43] are ye when men shall revile you and
[7:46] persecute you and shall say all manner
[7:49] of evil false against you falsely for my
[7:51] sake.
[7:53] Rejoice and be exceeding glad for great
[7:56] is your re reward in heaven. For so
[7:59] persecuted they the prophets which were
[8:02] before you.
[8:04] Amen. Now friends,
[8:09] Josiah singing that song and us singing
[8:12] it and I believe the Lord was pleased
[8:14] with it.
[8:16] There's a time in our lives for us to
[8:20] make a stand for what's right. You know,
[8:24] a Christian doesn't have to be beaten
[8:26] down all the time. And a Christian
[8:27] doesn't have to to just roll over all
[8:31] the time and just not go to the
[8:34] controversial issues. You know,
[8:36] sometimes Christians do go to the
[8:39] controversial issues. And I know it
[8:41] makes us uncomfortable sometime. I know
[8:43] that sometime you
[8:45] You might be thinking in your chair,
[8:47] "Oh, why is a pastor talking about that?
[8:49] It makes me nervous. You know, what's
[8:51] everybody else thinking?" But there's a
[8:53] time to make a stand. There's a time to
[8:57] stand up for what you know is right.
[9:00] &gt;&gt; There are people throughout history who
[9:02] have stood for what is right
[9:05] &gt;&gt; and they have suffered for it. And if we
[9:08] truly make a stand, then we can expect
[9:12] that we are going to suffer for what is
[9:14] right. Amen.
[9:15] &gt;&gt; But Jesus says right here, he says, "You
[9:17] are blessed
[9:19] when you suffer persecution for for they
[9:21] persecuted the prophets that were before
[9:23] you. You're not the only one that is
[9:25] ever that has suffered for doing what's
[9:27] right." Way back, right at the very
[9:30] beginning of the Bible, Abel, Adam's
[9:34] son, he was hated by his brother Cain.
[9:38] He was hated because he sacrificed to
[9:40] God in a different way that Cain
[9:44] sacrificed. And God honored Abel
[9:48] sacrifice
[9:50] more than he did Cain. And Cain that
[9:53] jealousy rose up in him if he would have
[9:55] just been humble and said, "You know
[9:57] what? Abel's right. I'm going to
[10:00] change." But instead, he he would not
[10:03] humble himself and he murdered his
[10:06] brother because of jealousy. Abel
[10:09] died because
[10:12] he desired to serve God and he did what
[10:15] was right. The prophet Isaiah
[10:19] Isaiah was hated by his own people
[10:23] because Isaiah said that I saw God on
[10:26] the throne.
[10:29] Made him jealous. They said, "You can't
[10:30] see God. The word teaches us that no man
[10:32] can see God." Isaiah said, "But I saw
[10:35] him on the throne." You know what they
[10:36] did to him? They sought him in half.
[10:40] Killed him for it. The prophet Daniel,
[10:44] he was so hated by the people of Babylon
[10:47] that they tricked the king
[10:50] into sentencing him to death.
[10:53] Why?
[10:55] Because he stood for what he believed.
[10:56] Because he prayed. He prayed three times
[10:59] a day. And they were jealous of him.
[11:02] They hated him. He lived a good life. He
[11:04] was successful. He did everything that
[11:06] Daniel did. He did well and people hated
[11:08] him for it and they tricked the king to
[11:11] sentencing him to death to be eaten by
[11:14] lions.
[11:16] Now the Lord delivered him from it.
[11:20] Mori and the Jews.
[11:24] He was hated
[11:26] in the time of King Ahazerus
[11:29] hated so much
[11:32] that they that the people of the
[11:35] kingdom, they developed this this scheme
[11:40] because the Jews were so hated because
[11:42] they set God first above everything
[11:45] else.
[11:47] And the the hatred of them spread and
[11:50] spread till they tricked the king into
[11:54] to sentencing all of them to death by
[11:56] hanging. But there was a lady that made
[11:59] a stand for what was right. She risked
[12:02] her life. She was fine. She wouldn't
[12:04] have been killed. But she risked her
[12:08] life for what was right. This Queen
[12:10] Esther and made a stand and she saved
[12:14] her people. Zachchariah
[12:17] the prophet. Again, another one. He made
[12:20] a stand and he was stoned by those that
[12:24] didn't agree with his way of worship.
[12:27] They hated Zachchariah because he didn't
[12:29] agree with them. He stood up against
[12:31] them. John the Baptist,
[12:34] same thing. He stood against the sins of
[12:39] the king. He made a stand saying that
[12:42] this immorality is wrong. And he was
[12:45] hated. Hated for it. So much so
[12:50] that he was sentenced to death. The king
[12:54] was tricked into it, but he was
[12:56] sentenced to death and had his head cut
[12:57] off.
[12:59] The Apostle Paul, same thing. Stephen,
[13:03] Stephen, the the uh the deacon and the
[13:06] apostle, he was killed because he was
[13:09] vocal in what he believed
[13:13] and hated it. It brings it right back to
[13:15] the words Jesus said. You're going to be
[13:17] hated for this.
[13:19] But there are people that are willing to
[13:21] make a stand. And thank God for those
[13:24] people. Jesus Christ himself died on the
[13:27] cross with the mobs hating him and
[13:30] making fun of him when he was up there
[13:33] nailed to the to the the wooden cross
[13:38] and people making fun of him saying,
[13:40] "Why don't you come down from there?
[13:44] Friends, we see that same spirit today.
[13:48] See it very, very plainly. I want to
[13:50] read I want you to I'm going to read the
[13:52] New Living Translation of this and I
[13:54] just want you to just it's it's a the
[13:57] New Living Translation is more of a
[13:59] story and I want you to listen to this
[14:02] and think about if this is going on
[14:05] today.
[14:07] John chapter 18 says this. Now just
[14:10] listen. Then Pilate called together the
[14:13] leading priests and other religious
[14:15] leaders along with the people and he
[14:17] announced his verdict. You brought this
[14:19] man to me accusing him of leading a
[14:21] revolt. I have examined examined him
[14:24] thoroughly on this point in your
[14:27] presence and I find him innocent. Pilate
[14:30] speaking of Jesus. I find him innocent.
[14:33] Herod came to the same conclusion and
[14:36] sent him back to us. Nothing this man
[14:38] has done calls for the death penalty.
[14:41] So I will have him flogged and then I
[14:44] will release him. Listen to this.
[14:48] Then a mighty roar arose from the crowd.
[14:54] And with one voice they shouted, "Kill
[14:56] him
[14:58] and release Barabus to us."
[15:01] Barabus was in prison for taking part in
[15:04] an insurrection in Jerusalem against the
[15:07] government and for murder. Pilate argued
[15:10] with him because he wanted to release
[15:12] Jesus, but they kept shouting, "Crucify
[15:15] him! Crucify him!"
[15:20] For the third time, he demanded, "Why?
[15:22] What crime has he committed? I have
[15:24] found no reason to sentence him to
[15:25] death. So, I will have him flogged, and
[15:27] then I will release him." But the mobs
[15:30] shouted louder and louder demanding that
[15:32] Jesus be crucified and their voices
[15:36] prevailed.
[15:38] So Pilate sentenced Jesus to die as they
[15:42] demanded
[15:44] as they had requested. He released
[15:46] Barabus, the man in prison for
[15:49] insurrection and murder. But he turned
[15:51] Jesus over to them to do as they wished.
[15:57] I believe
[15:59] a large portion of our c of our country
[16:03] right now would celebrate
[16:06] the blood of Jesus Christ and cry out
[16:09] for releasing a criminal in hisstead.
[16:16] I saw a few of these things s
[16:17] circulating recently and I want to read
[16:20] some of them. Some of you who went up to
[16:23] Charlie Kirk's funeral.
[16:25] with quite a few people did.
[16:29] I want to say a few more words. I said a
[16:30] few words last week. I want to say a few
[16:32] words more words this week. And let me
[16:34] let me ask you as I'm reading these
[16:36] things, think about what they would do
[16:38] to Jesus if he was on trial and what
[16:40] they would do to bring a criminal out
[16:43] instead of him.
[16:47] &gt;&gt; Saw this man. He was hysterically
[16:51] laughing
[16:52] on uh one of the platforms, hysterically
[16:56] laughing at at Charlie Kirk's
[16:58] assassination, making fun of his death.
[17:01] And at the end of the video, he said,
[17:04] "But seriously, Charlie, but seriously,
[17:07] Charlie Kirk, shots and prayers.
[17:12] Thoughts and prayers." You know,
[17:14] everybody says thoughts and prayers. He
[17:16] was making fun of a bullet killing this
[17:19] man and he says but seriously shots and
[17:21] prayers to you making fun
[17:25] another one and when I say and these
[17:27] people cannot talk without cussing so
[17:30] obviously I'm not going to read the bad
[17:31] words so I will say expletative when
[17:35] when it was so hard to find something
[17:37] that you could understand without the
[17:38] cussing. Another person says this,
[17:41] "Charlie Kirk just got put down like an
[17:44] expletative dog in Utah. I could not be
[17:49] happier. I will never, never, never feel
[17:51] bad when bad people get what they
[17:54] exploive deserve."
[17:57] Who would they have chosen
[17:59] on that day?
[18:03] man playing a guitar across the across
[18:06] the street from a Charlie Kirk vigil was
[18:10] singing this.
[18:12] I don't want your salvation.
[18:14] I want you to expletive die.
[18:20] This is this is today friends. This is
[18:22] last week. This isn't 2000 years ago.
[18:26] Elon M congresswoman from Minnesota says
[18:30] this. Charlie Kirk was do Dr.
[18:33] Frankenstein and his monster shot him
[18:36] through the neck.
[18:40] Then she said, "Any legacy he has left
[18:42] behind should be in the dust bin of
[18:45] history and we should move on and forget
[18:47] the hate that he spewed every single
[18:49] day." Imagine what they would have said
[18:52] about Jesus when they said, "Don't you
[18:54] remember him turning over the tables in
[18:55] the temple?"
[18:58] Imagine what they would have said to
[18:59] that. Do you not do we not see the same
[19:01] spirit that's here today? Political
[19:05] analyst for MSNBC, this guy Matthew Dodd
[19:09] says this. And to think that this and to
[19:12] and I think that that I think that is
[19:16] the environment we are in. You can't
[19:18] stop with these sorts of awful things
[19:21] you have and then say these awful words
[19:25] and not expect awful actions to take
[19:28] place.
[19:31] saying the so-called awful words of
[19:32] Charlie Kirk justified his murder. Then
[19:36] he said hateful thoughts lead to hateful
[19:38] words which then lead to hateful
[19:40] actions.
[19:42] Justifying
[19:43] the media on the day of Jesus
[19:48] just they they justified
[19:52] killing killing Jesus because saying
[19:54] that he was starting an insurrection.
[19:58] justified it. They just they then they
[20:02] they had rumors of that day. The media
[20:04] of that day said, "Oh, yeah, and by the
[20:06] way, Jesus came from an affair that his
[20:09] mother had with a Roman soldier. She
[20:10] wasn't a virgin.
[20:13] She had an affair with some gentile
[20:15] man." That is what the media was saying
[20:18] back then. And that is what was
[20:20] producing this hatred and fueling this
[20:24] hatred at that time. This judge,
[20:26] Hamilton County Municipal Court Judge
[20:28] Ted Barry was mocking
[20:32] Charlie Kirk and he said when he said,
[20:34] you know, when we say rest in peace, he
[20:36] says, Charlie Kirk, rest in hatred and
[20:39] division.
[20:41] This is a judge in Cincinnati,
[20:43] a leader. Yeah. Rest in hatred, Charlie.
[20:50] I got so many more here.
[20:54] One more.
[20:56] Drew Harrison.
[20:58] Let's Let's skip that one. Let's go to
[21:02] Yeah,
[21:04] this one person says, "Thoughts and
[21:06] prayers,
[21:08] you Nazi expletive. I hope the bullet's
[21:11] okay after touching Charlie Kirk."
[21:14] Boy, I know it makes you feel
[21:16] uncomfortable. Sorry. It's time to be
[21:17] uncomfortable. It's part of it. This is
[21:20] the world we live in. This is the hatred
[21:23] that is around us.
[21:27] Drew Harrison, a video game designer,
[21:29] was fired after sharing a social media
[21:31] post that he said, "I hope the shooter's
[21:33] name is Mario."
[21:36] This is one of the ones that work on uh
[21:38] the what are they called? The Mario
[21:41] Brothers. I hope the shooter's name is
[21:45] Mario. So that Luigi knows his bro got
[21:49] his back. He's referencing the Mario
[21:51] Brothers video game while associating ch
[21:54] Charlie Kirk's killer with Luigi
[21:58] Manjonei
[22:00] who's a kills of who's accused of
[22:01] killing Brian Thompson the CEO of United
[22:03] Healthcare shooting him in the back
[22:07] you know go you know and glorifying
[22:10] murder
[22:13] and these same people and I have I have
[22:17] more quotes from ministers on here and
[22:21] and making fun of this Charlie Kirk
[22:23] murder. And these are the same people.
[22:26] These are the same people that are
[22:28] deifying
[22:29] someone like George Floyd,
[22:32] who of course he shouldn't have died,
[22:34] but deifying this man, lifting him up,
[22:37] setting him up as an example, and making
[22:39] fun of this man, Charlie Kirk. What is
[22:42] wrong with our society? It's the same
[22:45] spirit that was there when Jesus Christ
[22:47] was crucified. You know what the big big
[22:49] difference between George Floyd and
[22:52] Charlie Kirk was?
[22:54] Now, I know Floyd was a career criminal.
[22:58] He was a drug addict. He was being
[23:00] arrested for breaking the law when all
[23:02] this happened aside from the obvious.
[23:04] And he and I and and he shouldn't have
[23:05] been killed. And it was a tragic
[23:07] situation. But what is do you know what
[23:08] the big difference between the two is?
[23:10] The big difference is no one separ
[23:13] celebrated the death of George Floyd.
[23:16] and they shouldn't have. It was tragic.
[23:20] Yes, he was a criminal and and he was
[23:22] rightfully being arrested, but it was a
[23:25] tragic outcome. No, but no one
[23:28] celebrated him dying. But why are they
[23:31] celebrating this man of God, Charlie
[23:33] Kirk? Why are they making fun of him?
[23:35] Why are they celebrating his death? For
[23:37] the same reason that they they
[23:40] celebrated Jesus Christ being nailed to
[23:43] the cross. It's the same spirit that we
[23:46] are living in today.
[23:49] As I said, I know it's uncomfortable,
[23:52] but given the choice,
[23:55] you can look at society today and given
[23:58] the choice between Jesus and Barabus,
[24:02] who would they have chosen?
[24:04] Many. Who would many people choose
[24:06] today? Jesus or Barabus?
[24:11] It's the time we're living in.
[24:13] I want you to listen. Look at the
[24:15] context in the Bible. Let's go to second
[24:18] Timothy chapter 3 verse one.
[24:26] This know also. 2 Timothy 3:1. This know
[24:30] also that in the last days perilous
[24:32] times shall come. For men shall be
[24:33] lovers of their own selves, covetous,
[24:36] boasters, proud, blasphemers,
[24:38] disobedient to parents, unthankful,
[24:41] unholy, without natural affection, truce
[24:44] breakers, false accusers, incontinent,
[24:46] fierce,
[24:49] despisers of those that are good,
[24:52] traitors, heady,
[24:55] high-minded,
[25:00] lovers of pleasure more than lovers from
[25:03] God having a form of godliness but
[25:06] denying the power thereof from such turn
[25:10] away.
[25:12] Now you want to bring this right down
[25:14] home.
[25:16] Let me read another translation. Let me
[25:18] read the New Living Translation of that.
[25:20] Now just sit back and just listen.
[25:24] See if you can't look around and see
[25:25] this.
[25:27] You should know this, Timothy,
[25:29] that in the last days there will be very
[25:32] difficult times.
[25:34] For people will love only themselves and
[25:38] their money.
[25:40] They will be boastful and proud,
[25:44] scoffing at God,
[25:46] disobedient to their parents
[25:49] and ungrateful.
[25:51] They will consider nothing sacred.
[25:56] They will be unloving and unforgiving.
[25:58] They will slander and others. They will
[26:01] slander others and have no self-control.
[26:06] They will be cruel and hate what is
[26:09] good. They will betray their friends, be
[26:12] reckless, be puffed up with pride, and
[26:15] love pleasure rather than God.
[26:19] They will act religious
[26:22] but they will reject the power that
[26:23] could make that could make them godly.
[26:27] Stay away from people like that.
[26:31] Wow. Let me tell you friends, the word
[26:33] of God is beautiful and the word of God
[26:38] is just as true today as it ever has
[26:40] been. But it is uncomfortable.
[26:44] these things that are being said that
[26:47] I'm reading right here. These aren't ne
[26:48] these aren't my words. I'm reading what
[26:50] everybody else says about this.
[26:53] And these things, it's like, whoa.
[26:56] Wow. I can see how they would hate
[27:00] Jesus. I could see how the crowds would
[27:02] get riled up and say, "Send us out
[27:04] Barabbus." I can see how those things
[27:07] would happen. And I believe they would
[27:09] happen today.
[27:12] Let's read Matthew 5:10 again before we
[27:14] go on to the next.
[27:17] Let me tell you, Isaiah said when the
[27:20] enemy comes in like a flood
[27:23] that the spirit of the Lord will lift up
[27:25] a standard against him.
[27:29] &gt;&gt; That's the good part. And we get to be
[27:32] part of that.
[27:34] &gt;&gt; Matthew chapter 5 verse 10. Again, let's
[27:37] read it again. Blessed are they which
[27:38] are persecuted for righteousness sake,
[27:41] for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[27:43] Blessed are you when men shall revile
[27:45] you and persecute you, and shall say all
[27:47] manner of evil against you falsely for
[27:49] my sake.
[27:51] Rejoice
[27:53] and be exceeding glad, for great is your
[27:56] reward in heaven, for so persecuted they
[27:59] the prophets which were before you.
[28:02] Now, what is the standard that God is
[28:05] going to rise up against this? As I said
[28:08] in Isaiah, whenever the enemy comes up,
[28:10] hey, God's going to rise up an army
[28:12] against him. Don't worry. And today,
[28:14] that army is not with flesh and blood.
[28:16] It's not it's not a some sort of
[28:18] insurrection or anything like that. Now,
[28:21] that army is through holy living and a
[28:24] good life before God and living right
[28:27] and loving each other. That is it.
[28:31] that will conquer. That is what will
[28:34] will conquer and that I promise you.
[28:37] Now listen to what Jesus says and he's
[28:39] looking out across the audience here
[28:42] and he says in verse 13 he says you are
[28:45] the salt of the earth
[28:48] but if the salt has lost its savor
[28:51] wherewith shall it be salted? It is
[28:53] hence then it is then forth good for
[28:55] nothing but to be cast out and to be
[28:57] trodden underfoot. So really salt is
[29:00] such an important part of life and
[29:02] especially back when Jesus was here.
[29:04] First salt's essential to life. It's
[29:08] part of life. You have to have salt in
[29:09] your system for everything to work
[29:11] right. And then also salt was used as a
[29:14] preservative back then. Whether it be
[29:16] fish or whether it be meat or or what
[29:18] whatever it was. They could preserve
[29:20] their food and make it last longer. But
[29:23] I think what Jesus is talking about here
[29:26] in this case, Jesus is referring to the
[29:29] flavor
[29:31] of salt in our food.
[29:34] We put salt in our food to make it taste
[29:37] good.
[29:39] But notice how seasoning, the seasoning
[29:42] of salt works. When you put the right
[29:44] amount of salt
[29:46] in your food, it tastes good. Stephanie
[29:49] makes potatoes and
[29:52] it's like some people like salty or some
[29:55] people like less salty. She just started
[29:57] looking around like, "Oh great, what's
[29:58] he gonna say?"
[30:00] Sorry, sweetheart.
[30:03] I can pick on you because you're stuck
[30:05] with me.
[30:07] They're not. You are. You kind of are.
[30:11] Um,
[30:13] but when you salt the potatoes,
[30:17] it's like if you just make mashed
[30:21] potatoes with no salt, have you ever had
[30:22] them? They're terrible. It's like, oh
[30:25] man, this is gross. This is This doesn't
[30:27] taste like anything. But then if you put
[30:29] too much salt in it, then all you taste
[30:32] is the salt.
[30:34] But if you put the right amount of salt
[30:37] in your potatoes,
[30:39] it tastes like potatoes
[30:43] and they're really good. It's not you're
[30:45] not tasting the salt, you're tasting the
[30:47] food. And that's what that's what salt
[30:50] does. He's saying that you are the salt
[30:52] of the earth. So what you're doing, what
[30:55] we are doing is we are taking God's word
[31:00] and we are the salt that makes it taste
[31:03] good. It's not the nutrients. We're not
[31:06] the nutrients. We're not the meat. Jesus
[31:10] is saying, "You are the salt."
[31:13] And make it taste good. When someone
[31:16] looks at us, they should be like, "Oh, I
[31:19] love the word.
[31:21] I love the way that tastes. I love the
[31:25] way that feels. It It feels really,
[31:28] really good. But if you lose, friends,
[31:31] if we lose that saltiness, if we lose
[31:33] that love, if we lose that passion for
[31:35] the word, then we've lost our love and
[31:38] we're not doing any good. The salt, it's
[31:41] either doesn't taste right or we ruin it
[31:43] or whatever. like like Josiah leading
[31:46] songs, Daniel leading leading songs. The
[31:48] worship leaders, they need to be into
[31:51] the worship. They need to let they need
[31:54] to season the worship with their salt to
[31:58] make it good. It's not about them. If
[32:00] you put too much salt in there, then it
[32:02] becomes about the worship leader and
[32:04] it's not good. It's like, how'd you like
[32:07] the worship service? I was a little too
[32:08] salty.
[32:10] It was a little too much about the guy
[32:12] and not so much about the Lord. The same
[32:15] thing with the preacher.
[32:18] He's up there and it's you might leave
[32:21] after the sermon and you say, "How how
[32:23] was the sermon?" It's like, "Well, you
[32:25] know, it was kind of bland.
[32:27] You know, he wasn't really into it. I
[32:29] could tell he didn't really believe it
[32:31] or it was, man, too salty. That guy was
[32:35] all about himself.
[32:37] He was just talking about himself in
[32:39] there." And it wasn't about the food
[32:41] that we're trying to get across. The
[32:43] salt just enhances the flavor. The salt
[32:46] is not the flavor. And that's how we
[32:48] should be
[32:50] with with a pastor of a church. You
[32:52] should say, "Well, you know, he he loves
[32:54] the people.
[32:56] He he he he's cares about me. He cares
[32:59] about my family. He cares about what's
[33:01] going on." But if you have somebody up
[33:02] there that doesn't that doesn't care,
[33:04] there's no saltiness there. But then if
[33:07] you have a pastor and you can get used
[33:08] to it that's constantly dumping the salt
[33:11] in.
[33:13] It's all about him and you don't even
[33:14] taste the food. You don't taste the
[33:17] word.
[33:18] We, me, you, all of us, we sprinkle that
[33:23] seasoning in there
[33:26] for it to taste good. And that is what
[33:29] Jesus is saying here.
[33:32] He's he's saying when you're a witness
[33:33] to your friend,
[33:35] do you care about their well-being? Do
[33:39] you care about their life? Do you care
[33:40] about their the things that are going on
[33:42] outside of church, outside of religion?
[33:45] When you want when you care for
[33:46] somebody, when you're trying to get them
[33:48] to come to the Lord, are you caring
[33:50] about their life?
[33:52] Are you caring about their job? Are you
[33:53] caring about the problems that they're
[33:55] having? Are you putting some of that
[33:56] salt in there of the word, salt of the
[33:59] Holy Spirit? You put it in there and oh,
[34:01] it makes it feel good because you feel
[34:03] that love. Otherwise, you give them a
[34:06] track and say, "Oh, yeah. Read this
[34:07] scripture and that scripture and and go
[34:09] ahead.
[34:12] There's no salt.
[34:14] There's no flavoring. You need to put
[34:17] you need to put that in there." But if
[34:19] you put too much salt, then the people
[34:21] kind of get used to it and then they're
[34:23] all about the salt and not about the
[34:25] food.
[34:28] Need to be careful.
[34:30] you take I can take I stole the salt
[34:33] from the kitchen.
[34:36] I'll bring it back. Um but I can I can
[34:40] say, "Brother Joe, have some have some
[34:44] salt, man. Here, put it in the
[34:46] teaspoon." Yeah. You want some? No,
[34:49] that's gross. I don't want that. Here's
[34:52] a teaspoon of salt. Joe, have it. No, I
[34:56] don't want that. But
[35:01] I'll take those.
[35:05] Yeah, but you take you take the same
[35:09] amount of salt
[35:11] and
[35:13] you just eat the salt plain. It's it's
[35:15] not good. There's no nutrients there.
[35:17] There's not much in here either. But you
[35:19] you you know what I'm saying? Go back to
[35:22] Stephanie's potatoes.
[35:25] They're much better with salt in the
[35:28] seasoning. And that's what we are. We
[35:31] bring the savor of the word. And that's
[35:33] what Jesus is saying. You bring the save
[35:36] of the savor of the word to other people
[35:39] through your life, through your love.
[35:42] And he's saying that you are the
[35:44] seasoning. You are what makes it taste
[35:47] good. Don't lose your flavor. The whole
[35:50] meal is depending on it.
[35:53] You are the salt of the earth. Jesus
[35:55] doesn't say he is. He says that you are
[35:59] such a beautiful it's a beautiful
[36:01] concept that the
[36:06] this what Jesus said that this is what
[36:09] it's not the flavor it's not the food.
[36:11] It's not the nutrients but we make it
[36:14] taste good.
[36:15] We represent it well. And that's all of
[36:17] us in our church friends. When people
[36:20] come in, when people visit, when you are
[36:22] visiting other people, not to get them
[36:24] into church, but to salt the Holy Spirit
[36:27] a little bit, to salt the word of God
[36:29] and make it to where, oh, I love that.
[36:32] I love it. It's just so good when we
[36:36] have a Bible study or whatever it might
[36:38] be. Oh, it just feels so good to read
[36:40] the B. I love it when this sister or
[36:43] this brother, I love it when they read
[36:44] the Bible because you can see it really
[36:45] comes out through them. It's because
[36:47] they love it. is because they are
[36:49] seasoning that word with love and
[36:51] they're not changing the word. It's the
[36:53] word that's beautiful. It's the word
[36:55] that has the nutrients. It's the word
[36:56] that's everything. They're just putting
[36:58] a little salt on it and making it making
[37:01] it palatable. Making it taste good.
[37:03] Psalm 34, we sing it often. Taste and
[37:06] see
[37:08] that the Lord is good. Blessed is he who
[37:11] hides in him.
[37:14] Taste and see. Taste this. Come and
[37:16] taste it. It's good. It's it's loving
[37:19] and it this is all part of we are part
[37:21] of this great this great plan of God.
[37:25] Verse number 14.
[37:28] You are the light of the world.
[37:32] A city is set on a hill cannot be hid.
[37:36] So Jesus goes from the salt. He says you
[37:38] are the salt of the world. Don't lose
[37:39] your savor.
[37:42] You know you are not the nutrients. I'm
[37:44] the nutrients. You're just making it
[37:45] taste good. And then he says, "You are
[37:48] the light of the world." But Jesus also
[37:49] said, "He's the light." But now he says,
[37:52] "You are the light. You are the light of
[37:55] the world. A city that is set on on a
[37:58] hill cannot be hid."
[38:02] The love of God
[38:04] shining from you, friends.
[38:08] Then nothing can hide it. You turn on a
[38:11] light in a dark room, that light is
[38:14] going to spread.
[38:16] That light is going to be what you see.
[38:19] The world should be looking at us,
[38:22] should be pointing up at that city on
[38:24] the hill. But if you notice a city on a
[38:26] hill, it's not one light. That's the
[38:30] best part about a city. When you're when
[38:32] you're driving into a to a city in the
[38:35] dark or or when you're hiking and you
[38:37] look at and you see the city down in the
[38:39] valley, you see that it's not one light.
[38:42] You see the whole city, but as you look
[38:44] close, it's a It's a million different
[38:47] lights and they all create one big
[38:50] beautiful light and it's different
[38:51] colors and different shapes and
[38:53] different sizes and it makes this
[38:56] beautiful light up on a hill and Jesus
[38:59] is saying that cannot be hid. Look at
[39:01] that.
[39:03] The world should be looking at you this
[39:06] city on the hill and each one of us has
[39:10] a light to shine forth. If you had just
[39:12] one light it wouldn't do much. You
[39:15] wouldn't even hardly see it.
[39:17] But man, you put a whole bunch of lights
[39:21] together, it is so beautiful.
[39:25] And he's saying here, he's saying,
[39:28] you're the light of the world and you're
[39:30] a city that's set on a hill and it
[39:32] cannot be hid. I want to read the lyrics
[39:37] to a song
[39:39] that um when I read this scripture,
[39:44] it uh it it really struck me. It brought
[39:47] my mind back to this song by casting
[39:50] crowns.
[39:52] And uh I don't think we've ever it's not
[39:53] really a congregational song, but it
[39:55] says this name of it is city on the
[39:58] hill.
[39:59] Listen to this. Do you hear of a city on
[40:02] the hill? said one man, said one old man
[40:04] to the other. It once shined bright and
[40:08] it would be shining still, but they all
[40:11] started turning on each other.
[40:14] You see, the poets thought the dancers
[40:16] were shallow, and the soldiers thought
[40:18] the poets were weak, and the elders saw
[40:21] the young ones as foolish, and the rich
[40:23] men never heard the poor man speak.
[40:27] But one by one they ran away
[40:30] with their with their madeup minds to
[40:33] leave it all behind. And the light began
[40:35] to fade in the city on the hill.
[40:39] Each one thought that they knew better.
[40:42] But they were different by design.
[40:46] Instead of standing strong together,
[40:48] they let their differences divide.
[40:52] And one by one they ran away with their
[40:54] madeup minds to leave it all behind. And
[40:57] the light began to fade in this city on
[41:00] the hill.
[41:02] And the world is searching still.
[41:06] But it was the rhythm of the dancers
[41:09] that gave the poets life.
[41:12] It was the spirit of the poets that gave
[41:14] the soldiers strength to fight. That
[41:17] song that Josiah that sang at the
[41:19] beginning, the battle hymn of the
[41:20] republic, it gave those soldiers
[41:23] strength. It gave them courage to go and
[41:27] fight the battle. But it wasn't the one
[41:29] that wrote the song that was fighting
[41:31] the battle.
[41:33] It was the rhythm of the dancers that
[41:35] gave the poets life. It was the spirit
[41:37] of the poets that gave the soldiers
[41:39] strength to fight. It was the fire of
[41:41] the young ones. It was the wisdom of the
[41:44] old. It was the story of the poor man
[41:48] that needed to be told.
[41:51] But one by one
[41:53] will will we run away with our madeup
[41:56] minds to leave it all behind as the
[42:00] light begins to fade in the city on the
[42:03] hill.
[42:06] And that's that city, friends. That's
[42:09] that city Jesus wanted to have. It's a
[42:12] city where there's all different colors,
[42:13] different shapes, different sizes,
[42:15] different brightnesses, different a
[42:18] different people. The the enemy wants us
[42:20] all to be the same. He wants us all to
[42:21] look the same, to act the same. He wants
[42:23] us all to stand at attention whenever
[42:26] the the politics say to do this or do
[42:29] that. But God wants diversity. God wants
[42:32] different people. He wants people that
[42:33] will stand up in their own way for what
[42:36] they believe like Stephen did. Stephen
[42:39] had a different calling than Abel had.
[42:42] Moses had a different calling than
[42:45] Abraham had. Esther had a different
[42:48] calling than the Apostle Paul. But they
[42:51] are all lights up on the hill shining.
[42:54] And each one of us has a different
[42:56] calling. But we are all lights up on the
[42:59] hill. And Jesus says, "Let those lights
[43:01] shine."
[43:03] Let's continue on.
[43:10] Listen to this verse. Where we at? Verse
[43:12] 15. And we'll close with this. The
[43:14] worship team can can come.
[43:16] Neither do men light a candle
[43:20] and put it under a bushel, but on a
[43:22] candlestick, and it giveth light unto
[43:25] all that are in the house. Let your
[43:28] light so shine before men, that they may
[43:31] see your good works, and glorify your
[43:33] father, which is in heaven. How
[43:36] beautiful is that?
[43:38] Let your light shine. Neither does a ma
[43:40] man light a candle and put it on a under
[43:42] a bushel, but he puts it on a
[43:44] candlestick so it can light up the whole
[43:46] house. And what's it lit lit up for?
[43:48] It's lit up for everybody else
[43:52] that everyone may see these good works
[43:54] and glorify
[43:56] not you,
[43:58] not me, but glorify your father which is
[44:02] in heaven.
[44:05] Let the salt,
[44:08] don't let the salt overwhelm the
[44:10] potatoes,
[44:12] but salt it just enough
[44:15] so you can taste that. So you can taste
[44:19] and see, so you can feel that presence
[44:22] of God because everyone is just bringing
[44:26] their own light into the into this
[44:28] building or bringing on their own light
[44:30] out into the world. This light of love
[44:32] and they are standing up. They are not
[44:35] weak Christians. They are strong
[44:37] Christians that know when to stand up
[44:39] and say, "No, I will not bow to that. I
[44:43] won't do it. I will still treat you in
[44:45] love. I will still love everyone. I will
[44:47] still keep my testimony. I won't lose my
[44:49] temper. I won't do I won't I won't
[44:51] spread a rumor. I won't fight with my
[44:53] mouth. But I will fight with my life. I
[44:56] will live this life as a Christian. And
[44:58] I will be that light. And now you can
[45:00] look to me because I am sweetening up
[45:04] the word.
[45:06] I'm making it to where here I am that
[45:09] light. Jesus says, "You are the light.
[45:12] I want to be that light. I want to be
[45:15] that light that lights up the room.
[45:17] I want to be one of those lights in that
[45:19] city of God that people can look to and
[45:24] see and and and want and just just
[45:27] admire it because it's God.
[45:32] You may look at God. God's the big He's
[45:34] the whole city. And he's proud. He's
[45:37] like, "These are all my little lights.
[45:40] These are all my little people." And
[45:43] each one of them has a little light. And
[45:45] not any light is more important than the
[45:47] other. We need all of those lights to
[45:50] light up this mountain.
[45:53] Now,
[45:54] if we are the light of the world,
[45:59] we let that light shine before the
[46:02] world. Let me read that 2 Timothy 3:1
[46:04] again.
[46:08] This is the light that this is where we
[46:09] live, friends. Second Timothy 3:1 says
[46:13] this, "Know also,
[46:16] know this also that in the last days,
[46:19] perilous time shall come." We're there.
[46:22] I think we've proven we are there. In
[46:24] the last days,
[46:27] perilous times shall come. For men shall
[46:30] be lovers of their own selves,
[46:33] covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers,
[46:35] disobedient to parents, unthankful,
[46:37] unholy, without natural affection, truce
[46:40] breakers, false accusers, incontinent,
[46:42] fierce, and despisers of those that are
[46:44] good, traitors, heady, high-minded,
[46:50] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[46:52] God, having a form of godliness, but
[46:54] denying the power thereof from such turn
[46:59] away.
[47:02] But
[47:04] God has raised up a standard against
[47:06] that.
[47:09] Bible says we don't fight anymore with
[47:10] flesh and blood, but God has raised up a
[47:14] standard. He's put lights up on the
[47:17] hill. He has he has taken salt and put
[47:20] it into the the soup, put it into the
[47:24] potatoes to make it taste good. He has
[47:27] made us friends. He told us you are
[47:33] the salt of the world.
[47:35] We are the ones that make this Bible
[47:40] make it taste good. Because you know why
[47:44] the whole thing is because this Bible is
[47:45] living in me. This Bible is living in
[47:48] you.
[47:50] It's become alive
[47:52] in us. And it's not just a book anymore.
[47:56] It's a living breathing document that is
[47:59] bringing itself that is showing itself
[48:02] in my life
[48:04] and in your life.
[48:07] That's what Jesus is saying here
[48:09] in the opening parts of this sermon on
[48:13] the mount.
[48:15] I mean he said he prophesied he says
[48:18] basically they're going to kill me
[48:20] they're going to hate me and they're
[48:21] going to hate you. They're going to kill
[48:22] you but you'll be blessed for it.
[48:25] Because why? Because you're the salt of
[48:28] the earth.
[48:30] You are a city on the hill. You are a
[48:33] light, the light of the world. That's
[48:36] who you are, my son, my daughter. That's
[48:40] who you are. Now you go out and light up
[48:42] this world. Put the salt in the soup.
[48:47] You go out and light that candle. Take
[48:50] your place in that city on the hill.
[48:53] That is what it is.
[48:55] We'll move on.
[48:58] We'll continue on on this this sermon on
[49:02] the mount. Friends,
[49:04] it gets better. Oh, man. It's so
[49:07] beautiful. It's good.
[49:10] [Applause]
[49:16] I just I just want to
[49:19] put a little salt on it because it's the
[49:21] best food you could ever eat. Oh man, it
[49:24] is so good. Just open it up and you read
[49:29] it and then talk with each other and
[49:31] then you be that you be that light. You
[49:34] be that salt of the earth. Amen. You
[49:38] feel good? Let me tell you friends, you
[49:40] are the salt of the earth. You're a
[49:43] blessing. You're a blessing to me. I can
[49:46] see what what you all do for other
[49:48] people. I can see the love that you
[49:50] have. I know that Jesus, I believe he
[49:53] always wanted a church that would be
[49:56] identified, not because of how the
[49:59] pastor preaches the word, not because of
[50:03] the way that the congregation dresses,
[50:05] not because of the building, not because
[50:07] any of that. I think Jesus really wanted
[50:10] a congregation that could be identified
[50:12] by their love that they have one for
[50:15] another. And I think we have a good
[50:17] start. I just I'm so I feel good to be
[50:21] part of this. What's going on here?
[50:24] Do we have
[50:27] I know that we all want to be that salt.
[50:32] Do we want to sprinkle a little a little
[50:34] bit more? Is anyone Does anyone want to
[50:36] be baptized this morning?
[50:39] Eva, God bless you, sweet. This little
[50:42] this little girl, she is such a blessing
[50:44] to me. She writes me these little she
[50:47] She's a wonderfully talented artist and
[50:50] she draws little pictures of what I'm
[50:53] speaking of and then she'll give them to
[50:55] me after service and I can tell if I got
[50:58] a little bit too salty or I didn't have
[51:00] enough salt because one time she's she
[51:03] gave me a picture and you know a lot of
[51:04] times it's it's just you know the the
[51:08] the donkey that carried Mary or it's
[51:11] something like that that I'm preaching
[51:12] on. The other day she gave me one that
[51:16] said,
[51:18] um, I forgot the guy's name, but it was
[51:22] something the Mexican potato.
[51:27] I was like, well, I tried.
[51:31] I might have missed the mark on that
[51:32] one, but she's just a blessing. Sister
[51:36] Ava, God bless you. Appreciate your
[51:38] testimony. Anyone else that wants to be
[51:40] baptized, if you want to be baptized, go
[51:42] back and uh and see the um ushers back
[51:46] there and they will bring you up to the
[51:48] baptismal.
[51:50] Friends,
[51:52] it is not always the Christian's role to
[51:56] be quiet.
[51:58] It is not always the Christian's role to
[52:02] just give whatever anybody wants. There
[52:06] is a time and a place for that. But
[52:08] there is also a time and a place to
[52:11] stand up and preach the word and stand
[52:15] for what the word says. There is that
[52:18] time and I believe we are seeing today
[52:22] that evilness that was in the world. And
[52:25] it's the same evilness that crucified
[52:28] Jesus and laughed at him on the cross.
[52:31] God bless you.
[52:37] [Applause]
[52:44] [Music]
[52:48] Let's put verse one up there. Brother
[52:49] Jeremy,
[52:52] &gt;&gt; I have heard
[52:54] how Christians
[52:57] long
[52:59] ago
[53:01] were brought before
[53:05] a tyrant's
[53:07] throne.
[53:09] They were told
[53:11] that he would spare
[53:15] their lives
[53:17] if they would reounce
[53:22] the name
[53:24] of Christ.
[53:26] But one by one
[53:30] they chose to die.
[53:34] The son of God
[53:38] they would not deny
[53:42] like a great
[53:45] angelic
[53:47] choir
[53:49] sings.
[53:51] I can almost hear
[53:55] their voicees
[53:57] ring.
[53:59] I pledge
[54:01] alance
[54:03] to the land.
[54:07] With all my strength,
[54:11] with all I am, I will seek
[54:17] to honor
[54:20] his command.
[54:23] I pledge
[54:26] alence
[54:28] to
[54:32] the lamb. Now the years.
[54:36] Now the years have come
[54:40] and the years have gone
[54:44] and the cause of Jesus
[54:48] still goes on.
[54:52] Now our time has come
[54:55] to count the cost,
[54:59] to reject this world,
[55:04] to embrace
[55:05] the cross.
[55:08] And one by one,
[55:11] let us live our lives
[55:15] for the one who died
[55:20] to give us life.
[55:23] Till the trumpet sounds
[55:27] on that final day.
[55:31] Let us humbly stand.
[55:35] Oh, and boldly
[55:38] say, I pledge
[55:41] alance
[55:44] to the lamb.
[55:47] With all my strength,
[55:51] with all I am, I will seek to honor
[56:00] his commands.
[56:03] I pledge
[56:05] alce
[56:08] to
[56:11] the to the lamb of God
[56:14] to the lamb of God
[56:19] who bore my pain,
[56:23] who took my place,
[56:27] who bore my shame.
[56:31] I will seek to honor
[56:35] his
[56:37] commands.
[56:39] I pledge
[56:41] alence
[56:43] to
[56:47] the lamb.
[56:49] Let's sing it with just our voices.
[56:53] I pledge
[56:56] alce
[56:58] to
[57:00] the lamb
[57:02] with all my strength.
[57:06] With all I am, I will seek
[57:13] to honor
[57:16] his
[57:17] commands.
[57:19] I pledge
[57:22] alce
[57:24] to
[57:28] the lamb.
[57:32] I will seek
[57:34] to honor
[57:37] his
[57:39] commands.
[57:41] I pledge
[57:44] alce
[57:46] to
[57:50] the lamb. Sing again. I will seek to
[57:52] honor.
[57:54] I will seek
[57:57] to honor
[58:00] his
[58:01] commands.
[58:04] I pledge
[58:06] alce
[58:09] to
[58:13] the lamb.
[58:18] Amen.
[58:20] [Applause]

[59:19] a wretch
[59:21] like me.

[59:28] was lost,
[59:30] but now
[59:33] I'm found.

[1:00:24] young lady
[1:00:27] who I believe is a good example of a
[1:00:30] Christian to her friends and to all of
[1:00:33] us that are around. As I as I've said,
[1:00:35] she's salulted many of my sermons and I
[1:00:39] appreciate all that she's done and and I
[1:00:43] appreciate her role here at the church.
[1:00:44] She also helps out in the back and um
[1:00:48] she's just a she's a special special
[1:00:51] young lady.
[1:00:52] She's come here to be baptized. I asked,
[1:00:54] "Do you want to say something?" She
[1:00:55] said, "No."
[1:00:57] I think that she um she is that light,
[1:01:02] one of those lights that just shines out
[1:01:05] and and you don't necessarily have to
[1:01:06] say anything. You just you just let your

[1:08:07] morning,
[1:08:09] when I woke this morning,
[1:08:13] I didn't have no doubt.
[1:08:16] I knew that the Lord would bring me out.
[1:08:21] [Music]
[1:08:22] I got down on my knees and said, "Lord,

[1:08:35] Oh, victory is mine.
[1:08:39] Victory is mine.

[1:09:01] Happiness is mine. Happiness is mine.
[1:09:06] Happiness is mine.

[1:10:24] taste good to the world. Doesn't it feel
[1:10:27] good friends? We are that Jesus said,
[1:10:29] not me saying Jesus said that we are the
[1:10:33] salt of the earth. Wow. And he says
[1:10:36] we're the light.
[1:10:38] And he says, "Don't hide that light. Let
[1:10:41] it shine. Let it shine forth to all
[1:10:43] men." Amen. Remember, no service
[1:10:46] tonight. I'm going to ask my friend,
[1:10:48] Brother Lionel, to close in prayer.
[1:10:54] Greetings to y'all and God bless.
[1:10:57] Did y'all hear anything good this
[1:10:58] morning?
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:11:03] [Applause]
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; You know, I I've been away for a while,
[1:11:09] me and uh me and my wife when we were
[1:11:11] out working the fires and stuff, and
[1:11:15] it's just a blessing to be able to come
[1:11:16] back this morning, get to see y'all, and
[1:11:19] to be able to be able to hear these
[1:11:20] words that we heard this morning. And uh
[1:11:24] I think that uh there's many places in
[1:11:27] the world where people are gathered this
[1:11:29] Sunday, but to look at you all and to
[1:11:32] realize
[1:11:34] that we are the ones right here this
[1:11:37] morning that God gave to each other.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; This is our family.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; We're part of a kingdom,
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; an eternal kingdom that's made up of
[1:11:45] people everywhere. But this here is our
[1:11:47] family here.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; You're mine and I'm yours. It's just a
[1:11:51] blessing to be able to be here this
[1:11:53] morning and to know each one of you. Um,
[1:11:56] I just want to say a few words. Uh,
[1:11:59] in this world that we live in, we deal
[1:12:02] with a bunch of evil and we hear a bunch
[1:12:04] of things in the news and
[1:12:06] certain things that happen. You know,
[1:12:08] the whole thing with Charlie Kirk and
[1:12:10] everything and we hear all this negative
[1:12:13] stuff.
[1:12:15] But as the pastor Dan mentioned this
[1:12:17] morning, he seen a video.
[1:12:22] And on that video,
[1:12:27] it was a boy
[1:12:31] right here in the city of Tucson who was
[1:12:32] missing a leg. He had a prosthetic leg
[1:12:36] fitted to him. And this morning, he went
[1:12:38] down into downtown Tucson to run a race
[1:12:42] with the other people.
[1:12:47] the other people of Tucson that gathered
[1:12:48] for the race.
[1:12:51] Now, in that video that I seen,
[1:12:56] it renewed my faith in humanity in this
[1:12:59] day of evil because
[1:13:01] as he was running the race and he was
[1:13:04] hobbling and he was hopping and he was
[1:13:07] trying to make it to the finish line,
[1:13:18] There were some people who were the salt
[1:13:20] of the earth this morning.
[1:13:24] [Music]
[1:13:27] There were some people who let their
[1:13:29] light shine
[1:13:33] for just a moment in the darkness.
[1:13:36] Those people were the good people of
[1:13:38] this city, Tucson, Arizona.
[1:13:42] who ran behind the boy and didn't
[1:13:45] surpass him so they could win the race.
[1:13:49] They ran behind him to cheer him on, to
[1:13:52] get him to the finish line.
[1:13:56] That was a beautiful thing. And I
[1:13:58] thought, well, there's a message in
[1:14:00] that. There's a message in that for us
[1:14:03] because we are the salt of the earth for
[1:14:05] each other. each one of us the light God
[1:14:08] placed in us his light for each other.
[1:14:12] And as a brother was talking, I was
[1:14:14] thinking about that. And let me ask you
[1:14:16] a question.
[1:14:18] If the chariots of fire landed in front
[1:14:20] of this church this morning and they
[1:14:23] said, "Here we are.
[1:14:25] Chariots here to pick us up to take us
[1:14:27] to the other side."
[1:14:29] I wouldn't trample over brother Manny to
[1:14:32] get to that chariot or brother Heath or
[1:14:35] brother Daniel.
[1:14:37] I'd grab you guys and say, "Let's go,
[1:14:39] man. The chariots are out there waiting
[1:14:42] for us, man. They're here." As we went
[1:14:45] out this church, some might fall with a
[1:14:47] broken ankle or back or something. There
[1:14:50] wouldn't be one person left in this
[1:14:51] church. Wouldn't we gather each other
[1:14:54] and say, "Let's go.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; We're here. Let's make it to the end."
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's gather each other and go.
[1:15:00] That's the salt of the earth. That's the
[1:15:02] light. It's in us. Let's take it take it
[1:15:05] with us this week. Let's take it with us
[1:15:07] and let it let's do as they did in
[1:15:09] downtown Tucson. Let's season
[1:15:12] the path for somebody else through God's
[1:15:14] word. Let's let God's light shine
[1:15:17] through us for somebody.
[1:15:20] Let's let it happen through him, through
[1:15:22] his word, through his blood, through his
[1:15:25] mercy. Amen. Let's take it before him
[1:15:27] this morning in prayer.
[1:15:29] [Music]
[1:15:31] Father, as we come before you this
[1:15:33] morning,
[1:15:35] I ask you to bless this group of people
[1:15:37] here, Father, and those that are
[1:15:38] watching on through the video. Father, I
[1:15:41] ask you that your salt, the seasoning of
[1:15:45] your word, and your grace and mercy
[1:15:48] follow with us through this week, and
[1:15:51] that you be the light that shines
[1:15:52] through us, Father. For we know that you
[1:15:56] come down in earthly flesh and you
[1:15:59] didn't die for yourself. You died for us
[1:16:03] because you wanted us to be on that side
[1:16:05] with you.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; You could have took the kingdom for
[1:16:10] yourself,
[1:16:12] but you seemed that
[1:16:15] you wanted us to be there with you.
[1:16:17] There was no kingdom going to be a
[1:16:18] kingdom without us, Father. And we thank
[1:16:20] you for that. We thank you, Father.
[1:16:23] Father, we ask you that your spirit goes
[1:16:24] with us.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; I ask you to bless everybody that's here
[1:16:28] today, Father. Let them be strong this
[1:16:30] week. Let them have the hearts of lions
[1:16:32] this week.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; Let them rise up, Father. Let them say,
[1:16:36] "We're not going to make it to the
[1:16:37] finish line by ourselves. We're going to
[1:16:40] bring our neighbors with us, our
[1:16:41] friends, our families, the city of
[1:16:44] Tucson.
[1:16:46] We're going to bring them with us to the
[1:16:48] finish line. Father, for there's a
[1:16:50] crossing of the old river Jordan.
[1:16:52] somewhere, Father. But there's a
[1:16:54] promised land somewhere, Father. And
[1:16:56] when we get there, we don't want to get
[1:16:58] there by ourselves.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; We want to bring everybody with us,
[1:17:01] Father.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; Let it be so. Let us gather. Father, let
[1:17:05] us take each other and carry each other
[1:17:07] to the finish line.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; Let it be the salt. Father, when we salt
[1:17:11] something to season it, it isn't just
[1:17:13] for ourselves. It's for our friends, for
[1:17:15] our neighbors, for our family. Father,
[1:17:17] when we light the path, it isn't for
[1:17:20] ourselves. It's so that somebody else
[1:17:21] don't stumble. Let your light be in us,
[1:17:24] Father. Your season be in us, Father.
[1:17:26] Let us forgive and let us love. Let us
[1:17:28] go on. Let us be strong this morning.
[1:17:30] Let us look at each other and say,
[1:17:32] "Here's the ones that were given to to
[1:17:34] me to us. Let us be there for each
[1:17:36] other. Father, we ask it in your
[1:17:39] precious name. In the name full of mercy
[1:17:41] and grace this morning, in the name of
[1:17:44] Jesus, we pray. Amen.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; Praise God."
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; Amen means so be it. Thank you, Father.
[1:17:50] [Applause]
[1:17:55] I'm gonna I'm gonna quote a great I'm
[1:17:57] going to quote a great man. He said,
[1:17:59] "Let's make heaven crowded."
[1:18:02] So, let's make heaven crowded this week.
[1:18:04] Amen. Brother Josiah, one more.
[1:18:10] Just before we go, let's sing Winds of
[1:18:12] Faith. There are two roads you can take.

[1:19:41] Much too high.
[1:19:44] Just speak the word of God.
[1:19:49] By and by,
[1:19:53] it will move
[1:19:56] or you will fly.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Set your wings
[1:20:04] to the winds of faith.
[1:20:09] You can fly
[1:20:13] in a higher place.
