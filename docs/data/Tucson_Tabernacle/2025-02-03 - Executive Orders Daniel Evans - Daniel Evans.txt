want to come up oh and he reached down his hand for me oh and he reached down his hand for me oh I was lost and undone without God for his son when he reach down his for me you love the Lord this morning brother Daniel I asked him if we could I could share this testimony probably doesn't need much introduction but this is my uncle brother Russell Wallace shared this testimony on our family chat last night about 10 30 last night he says I have a testimony that is beyond any scientific explanation it is a miracle straight from the hand of God I'm ashamed to say that I can be a bit of a skeptic and my faith is often quite weak eight years ago when the good when fire swept through here I'll always remember the morning that the fire reached our property line Wesley his son and I got on the quad to take the back rout out of here and my faith was very weak I said to Wesley everything we have is going going to burn to the ground and there will be nothing left this is a precious memory I'll have forever Wesley said dad even if it wasn't God's will to preserve our property he would change his mind because so many Saints are praying there were Saints around the world praying and the fire came right up to their property line and then just went around their property one week ago you were all gracious enough to ask the Lord's blessings on the new well we are drill we were drilling I think this is their third well they've drilled in three or 30 about 30 years on their property as you recall I told you 10 days ago that our old well had been diminishing for years and was the worst ever currently at less than one Court per minute I know this well like an old old friend for years now I have regularly tested the output and kept a chart in recent history in March 2022 we were at 8/10 of a gallon per minute in October of 20123 down to 66 gallons per minute and then in August of 2024 4.55 Gall per minute and then this month January was this past month 2025 was. 23 gallons per minute so this has been our worst month ever with the well only producing 14 gallons per hour so here's the testimony this afternoon I went down to the well head to do another volume test for the test I bypassed the safety switch and kick the pump on full time in less than 10 minutes the water is all pumped out and the the pump starts sucking air I then turn it off let the well recharge for 15 minutes to turn turn it back on and check the volume today after 10 minutes it was not sucking air after an hour I it had still not pumped dry it's been on for 8 hours now and it is still not sucking air I checked our storage tanks and we have pumped 1,00 gallons in the last 8 hours this is an impossibility the impoverished well was only producing 112 G in 8 hours it could be proposed that the new drilling activity affected the old well but there's no chance of that the new well is on is on the farthest northeast corner of our property 60 Acres away from this one hope his granddaughter was quite excited and went down with me regularly to check the output today she said to me we were all praying for the new well and the Lord healed the old one too he says I'm so humbled and thankful to the Lord for a supernatural intervention and then this morning he posted this update at 7:00 a little after 7:00 this morning he says this morning's update our 3,000 gallons of storage tanks are all full and the water is overflowing onto the ground it is so surreal to be in the middle of a supernatural event thank you Lord what a testimony I imagine brother Daniel's going to have something to say about that if he wants to come out let's all stand to our feet and let's sing that old Hymn of the church only believe all things are possible no matter what it is we just heard that only believe only Bel all things are possible only be with all your heart only believe hear us Lord Jesus only Bel all things are possible if we'll only be again oh be oh only believe all things are possible only believe oh only believe only believe all things are possible only bless you my friend God bless you amen let's bow our [Music] heads Our Father we are grateful once again to come into the house of the Lord Lord to give you praise and to give you Thanksgiving and Lord just to learn of these testimonies that you still do miracles and father that we can trust in you that if we pray Lord you will hear our prayers and then father you will answer those prayers Lord may we get ourselves out of the way when we ask and may our prayers and the things that we ask may they be not for ourselves father but according to your perfect will and may it not be us that speak our prayers but it may be the Holy Spirit speaking through us that is our desire father bless our service this morning I pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you brothers and sisters you can be seated appreciated that testimony from Brother Jordan I appreciate all the testimonies God God's God's good um first I want to welcome our visitors there a few sister AA good to see you again God bless you welcome home um look around and I I see brother Tony good to see you my friend brother seven back there God bless you welcome brother John Martin and family where are you oh there you are over there God bless you brother welcome it's good to have you good uh good to have you visiting with us um sister nah God bless you it's good to good to see your friend here sister N I used to when um I was Stephanie and I were going back and forth and I'd have to come for a couple a couple days a month between Jeffersonville and Tucson i' I'd always sit behind nah in church and I'd always look at over over her shoulder and she draws so well and she draw these pictures so I don't mean to embar embarrass you but uh I always enjoyed that watching watching you draw welcome to uh as I said to to all of our visitors if I didn't um but didn't recognize you we're still thankful to have you brother Dan sister Jacqueline good to see you're back at it and you're over the sickness God God bless you um that testimony from Brother Jordan uh you may know a little bit about your pastor you may know that I'm a I'm a a scientist um you may also know that not only am I a scientist but I'm an environmental scientist well what you probably don't know about me is I'm not just an environmental scientist but I'm a hydrologist that actually studies groundwater groundwater and surface water interaction groundwater flow through different aquifers and that and uh when brother Jordan read the um the testimony from his uncle uh the brother said that it's beyond any scientific explanation um well when I look at it I don't see any way that something like that could ever happen and when he says scientific explanation I mean without as a scientist you say well I haven't done a study on it I haven't collected these data but I don't see any way something like that could happen it is an absolute true and Bonafide Miracle he said 23 gallons per minute you can drink .23 gallons in a minute That's how little was coming out of that well and then I mean the granaries of Heaven just opened up and it just started pouring out water and filling up the tanks it's a miracle that's that's one of those real ones you know you you can you can question things we always want to give God credit and some but we don't we want to be careful we don't want to give God credit for something that he didn't do which is is often the case but wow that's impossible for that to have happened so yeah we got to be part of it and we've been praying for the family and uh we got to brother Aaron my prayers are in there so so praise God that was that was really really tremendous testimony um I uh I won't tell who wrote the note but brother Aaron gave me a note that he wrote from uh saying that it's Unison Sean's 14th anniversary dear friends personal friends to Stephanie and me and uh just just beloved loyal members of this church and and uh and precious family and um it's uh it's been a long road are you the same place you were 14 years ago God bless you I'm glad that we're where we are now brother Sean we still got a long way to go but we're on the we're on the right Road brother Lyle uh he uh he mentioned something last time he ministered on Wednesday night and uh I was like I'll brother a while and we kind of laughed at it when he said it but he uh the previous week he said uh and I forgot the the situation the story but he said you know it was like a bunch of government workers and and then and then the next week brother ly said listen I'm sorry that I said that I shouldn't have said that we all kind of laughed and um but uh then after that we started seeing the uh these all of these executive orders starting to come down from the president and uh it's it's really shaking things up in the government and it's uh some of these things are are kind of hard to accept and then other other ones are um are like well you know this this is really good but it's uh it it's been just amazing and that's what I want to talk about um in this sermon is is executive orders and one thing that uh president Trump did a couple weeks a couple days ago which I was really blessed with is he took he he gave an order to take the pronoun signature off of your emails that's a big deal that pronoun signature is basically us saying that I bow down to somebody who was maybe born a man and wants to be called a woman or born a woman or wants to be called a man or they they don't know what they are and it has been strongly encouraged as in the government brother Tony you're you're a fed too it's been strongly ENC encouraged in the government to put your pronouns on your signature page that's wrong what that is is saying you know what I bow down to someone being saying that they are not what God created them to be and it just it the whole thing is has made me sick and and Donald Trump said the other day take that off of your signature page I appreciate and admire that man's courage of course I'm not against I'm against sin homosexuality is a sin some people struggle with that other people struggle with lying other people struggle with with stealing other people struggle with um with adultery people struggle that sin I don't believe is necessarily any greater than the other but I don't have to bow down to any sin I don't put on I don't put on my signature page Daniel Evans liar or Daniel Evans thief and you got to accept it I don't do that and neither should we have to do this either so I really appreciate that executive order that the president president has has done and what he's doing is he's trying to rebuild our country and the reason this country is failing the reason any country fails is not necessarily because of financial decisions not necessarily because of military decisions the reason countries fail is because of sin in they fail because of dishonesty they fail because of immorality that's why they fail look through history and that is why a country fails and I appreciate our president trying to get us back on the right track I might not agree with him in everything and I've said a number of times from the pull pit that I don't necessarily support before now that he's president I fully support him because he's our president and the Bible teaches us that we should pray for our leaders but God bless him God bless him for trying and what we have seen is 60 70 years ago when brother Brandon was here we saw the enemy come in to society and come into the family and try to take the mother out of the family try to pull her out and that motherly influence on the children take her out and put her in the workforce put her away away from the family so that then the Satan the enemy could come in and get in the children and now we are seeing times change God doesn't change but times change now I believe we are seeing the same attack on the American man and we see that Satan if he knows that if he can get in and take out this man and demasculinize take away his manhood then we know then he knows that he's got the country the man has been degraded and put down more than ever in this past decade or so and I want to see strong men raise up I want to see Godly men raise up the man that will get his family together no matter how tired everybody is and how there's things going on on Netflix and we want to see all the this this all this other stuff get these this man get his family together and say we're going to read our Bible tonight we are going to pray as a family tonight we're going to pray this morning I want to see that return to our families I want to see a man stand up I want to see the power of the American male rise up again godly man I I just I see it in attack and this pronoun thing was just a another step to confuse this next Generation I appreciate somebody sent me a picture I appreciate um president Trump I heard this morning that he maybe is he has just signed a new um a new presidential order a new um executive order to get us back to church I love it man way to go Donald I know it's it's it's Photoshop but it's still it's still good I uh things are going on it's it's it's really it's really strange everything that's happening in the in the country in the world today but I I do appreciate I appreciate striking those pronouns I I appreciate the stand for the American worker the stand for the American Family the stand for men the stand for women and getting us right back on track you know as I was talking about these pronouns this isn't new Jesus said in Luke chapter 17 he says as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man as it was was in the days of Sodom show so shall it be in the second coming of Christ what was going on in Sodom homosexuality has has really it's always been here but what was going on in Sodom is the power of the homosexual Lobby you notice that lot I'm sorry it was I think it's as in the days of lot but it's the same thing lot was the governor of the city and remember when the homosexuals came to his house he was afraid of them even though he's the most powerful man in Sodom he was afraid of their voice he was afraid of their power and he tried to make deals with them and we and Jesus said when you see this start to raise up as it was in the days of lot then look because the second coming of Christ is at hand and here we are and I I just I do pray that this Administration that we have now we'll stay the wrath of God we'll bring back some semblance of godliness so we can continue this work and continue to bring people to the Lord Jesus it's instead it's they're they took prayer out of schools a long time ago because it was offensive but you replace it with transgender athletes and and with with swearing and and cussing and and with pornography and passing out birth control in the high school schools what message does that send to our young people it sends the message that sin is not sin and I I just I do appreciate that we have a little bit more boldness now in being able to serve the Lord and like I said I don't have I'm not against any certain group of people but I want godliness I want godliness in this church church and I want godliness where we work I want godliness in this country because God will continue to bless us if we have godliness if not we've gone through the Book of Judges we're going to see the same thing happen there well our country will be destroyed and it's destroyed from within from sin within um one of the executive orders that came down recently and brother Tony you probably got this one too that that we are not to um work remotely anymore meaning that we are not allowed to um work from home when we could go into the office or even if we can't go into the office there there won't be any more working for home from home and he's trying to increase productivity in the government and when you do that so he issued this executive order and when you do that it's issued at the top and this could be it doesn't have to be the government it could be the corporate world so this comes down from corporate that there will be no working from home anymore that you have to come into the office and as it trickles down questions start to come up and then there they're very valid questions uh like here's some of the questions that we've have what if I'm sick but I want to work I'm contagious but I want to work I need to get stuff done can I work from home or do I have to take a sick day and what if I only need to work a couple hours do I have to drive all the way into the office and work from there what if what if we're behind and I need to work on the weekends can I work from home doing that so the there's all these questions that come down and then they'll come down to finally they they trickle down they come down finally to the employee and this employee will have a set of questions and he will ask his boss or her boss what about this what about that what about if I'm sick what about this so then that boss will either answer the question and make a decision or send it back up the chain let's say in this case that the boss answers the question and let's say it's can I uh can I work at home on Friday then later on that person gets caught breaking the rule breaking the law breaking the executive order and here comes the enforcement down and says dan you on these days you have been working from home there was an executive order said you are not allowed to work from home so then Dan takes his email prints out his email and says no listen right here my boss approved me to do this so then that that responsibility now no longer rests on you it rests on the one who approved it the one who stood for you it's the same thing with sin you can say you swore you cussed whatever it might be or let's say you stole from you stole from work you came into the office and you took things that were owned by the company and you you took them for yourself and sold them and made money on them or whatever and then your boss comes in and he says you did this you stole it but I'm going to approve that that you were given this then when they come to get you again whether it be the police or whether it be the higher-ups to fire you or to put you in jail you said no no no here's my email from my boss I had permission to do that and then the punishment rests upon the person that approved it and that would be it would be resting on that person and that person would have to pay the bill would have to pay for what was stolen you tracking with me and it's the same for us the same with Jesus Christ the the third commandment the third executive order says you shall not take the name of the Lord in your God in vain for the Lord will not hold him Guiltless who takes his name in vain how many times have we heard somebody somebody say oh my God or Jesus Christ in a derogatory way right there you broke that executive order you broke that commandment and there must be punishment and the punishment for it would be death same with adultery if you committed adultery the Bible very plainly says that you are to be stoned but in this case somebody stepped in front and said no I'll take the blame for that I will take I will pay for the the sin I'll take the blame so when God the father comes down and says you have done this and you have done that you have sinned here you have sinned there you have sinned there my word my executive order which can't can't be done away with says that you must die and then something steps in someone steps in and says no it's my fault they're Justified I put my name on what they did and when you put your name on what they did if I put my name on one of my employees that stole something I say no I approve that now I have to pay the price and the price was death the price was hell and so my sins there was somebody that took my place and that price did not go unpaid that's the thing we don't think of very often every time I sin every time I do something wrong there must be a price paid because that was the executive order that was the Commandment somebody has to pay the price so now we have this one this Advocate comes in and says yeah I did it I'm responsible for it and he had to die he had to suffer what I should have suffered so these executive orders that we're seeing right now we've been talking about Parables it's a perfect example of a parable a parable Parable is something that you see every day that you relate to the word of God and we see executive orders coming down we see orders coming down from corporate that we all have to adhere to and if we don't do it there is punishment either we get fired we might get thrown in prison or whatever it might be the same with our lives we sin we do things wrong the executive order here says sin requires death and then somebody stepped in took my place and says I approved it I did it it's my fault and then we go we say father um he signed for me I'm Justified he had to Die the death that I should have died he had to be condemned of the sins that I did he had to be condemned of the most filthy things it might be homosexuality it might be pornography it might be stealing it might be lying it might be murder he did it and not me and that's what Jesus Christ means to us he took that place Matthew chapter 22 Jesus if we truly do love Jesus Jesus said if you love me keep my Commandments Matthew 22 verse 34 I'll read out the new King James version says but when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees they gathered together then one of them a lawyer asked him a question testing him and saying teacher which is the great commandment in the law and Jesus said to him so he's saying what is the great executive order what's the most important of all these that have come down and Jesus answered and he say you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart with all your soul and with all your mind this is the first and great commandment and the second is like it you shall love your neighbor as yourself on these two Commandments hang all the law and the prophets so on these two executive orders h all of the Bible and all of the prophets if Jesus Is God which you believe he is right if Jesus Is God and he say he says if you love me remember it said Jesus said the first commandment the great commandment is to love the Lord God with all your heart and Jesus says if you love me then keep my Commandments basically if you you love me then do what I tell you and in the context it says his second commandment is to love each other and many of you don't know each other here so it's hard to love someone if you don't know them but it says it says to love your neighbor as yourself so you can't really love someone who you don't know but you can love someone who you do know whether you like them or not whether they're nice or not whether they get on your knee your nerves or not whether they do you right or they do you wrong if you know them then you are obligated to love them like you know your neighbor if you know your neighbor some of us don't know our neighbors very well but we know them so if you know your neighbor then you certainly know each other and we have to love one another and some of God's executive orders are truly truly awesome he gave those orders to us and we we we hear God and we see okay Lord you taught us out of this Bible to do these things and to set aside everything else and to concentrate on those and let these things from this Bible let them take preeminence over everything over my own desires over whatever I want to do but he also o had some really some pretty stellar executive orders and I'll read a few of them and uh you don't have to follow me back there because I'll go fast Genesis 1:3 God said let there be light and there was light an executive order straight down from God I love it let there be light and the there was light and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness and he called the day day in the darkness he called night so the evening and the morning were the first day what a commandment it's really the first one in the whole Bible he says let there be light and a place that was dark became light Genesis 1:26 it says this then God said let us make man in our own image according to our likeness let let them have dominion over the fish and the Sea over the over the birds of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creep us so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them all of us are in that boys and girls men and women and how that we are created in the very image of God and if he created us to be like him then shouldn't we be like him Abraham in Genesis 17 when Abram was 99 years old the Lord appeared to Abram and said to him him another commandment I am almighty God walk before me and be blameless and I will make my Covenant between me and you and I will multiply you exceedingly then Abram fell on his face and God talked with him saying as for me behold my Covenant is with you and you shall be a father of many nations a man who couldn't have children we know the story God created the Jewish race and well really all all the race is right there and then when Abraham showing that that this promised son that he just Pro he just promised him right there this promised son was born then God tells Abraham go up and sacrifice your son lay him on the altar get a bunch of sticks just like you would a lamb or a ram get a bunch of sticks take this sacrifice like you would a a ram slice his throat kill him and then burn him Abraham does so and when Abraham but the angel when when Abraham laid him there he raised up the knife to kill his son now listen to this executive order and this one came right at the last minute but the angel of the Lord called him to him from heaven and and said Abra Abraham Abraham and he says here am I he said don't lay your hand on the lad or do anything to him for now I know that you fear God since you have withheld your son your only son from me Jacob at bethl in Genesis 2811 so he came to a certain place and stayed there all night because the sun had set and he took one of the stones of that place and put his put it at his head and he lay down in that place to sleep then he dreamed and behold a ladder was set up on the earth and its top reached to heaven and there the angels of God were ascending and descending on it and behold the Lord stood above it and said an executive order from the king from God himself I am the Lord God of Abraham your father and the god of Isaac the land which you lie you're laying on now I will give to you and to your descendants also to your descendants shall be as the the dust of the earth you shall spread abroad to the to the west and and the East and the North and the South and in you and in your seed all the families of the Earth shall be blessed behold I am with you it's God speaking executive order from the top behold I am with you and will keep you wherever you go and when will bring you back to this land for I will not leave you until I have done that which I have spoken to you then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said surely the Lord is in this place and I did not know it and he was afraid and said how awesome is this place this is none other than the house of God and this is the Gate of Heaven and then still to this day being fulfilled we see two a 2,000 years span where Israel this promise that that God made to him Israel Was Defeated and spread around the world and then recently in the 1940s we see that Israel fulfilling this prophecy that God made I'll bring you back and forming another another Nation a powerful nation and now we're all blessed because of it because of this nation Moses at the burning bush in Exodus 3 Moses goes down and and he sees this bush burning and he goes down and he bows down before it and God says I am the god of your father the god of Abraham the god of Isaac and the god of Jacob and Moses hid his face for he was afraid to look upon God and the Lord said I have surely seen the oppression of my people who are in Egypt the story of The Exodus coming out from bondage so I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up from that land to a good and large land to a land flowing with milk and honey to a place of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the amorites and the pites and the hites and the jebusites now therefore Behold The Cry of the children of Israel has come to me same as our cries come before him when we cry out sayl help my well on my property Lord help my sick son or my sick daughter Lord help me and he says I hear the cries of my people an executive order from the top and I have also seen the oppression which the Egyptians oppressed them now come therefore and I will send you to Pharaoh that you may bring my people the children of Israel out of Egypt there's a lot of them but I'll I'll finish with this one on the executive orders from God Isaiah chapter 7 verse1 14 one of the most important orders one of the most important thing that God set forward therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign Behold a the Virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel and Emanuel means god with us and 740 or so years later this executive order came to pass this commandment came to pass but how was This Promise This commandment this man this Messiah to be manifest itself really how's it to manifest itself in my life and how could it save me how could he save me from my sins Matthew chap 1:8 let's go there familiar Christmas scripture but a very good one for this on God's executive orders now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise when he when as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph before they came together she was found with ch a child of the Holy Ghost then Joseph her husband being a just man and not willing to make her a public example was minded to put her away privy but while he thought on these things behold the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream saying Joseph th son of David fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost and she brought forth a son and thou shalt and and she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins this is the order that came down I am sending this one you will call his name Jesus because he will save them from their sins the the very word Jesus comes from the Hebrew word we pronounce it Joshua Yeshua it means savior now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord by Spoken of the Lord by the prophet saying Behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name Emmanuel which is being interpreted God With Us I talked about the mediator between the law that comes down the executive order that comes down and the law breaker the mediator that that stands in the place of the person who stole from the company but someone else paid the price the scripture says and he shall save his people from their sins now let's get into how this is implemented to me how it's implemented to you how it was implemented in the past in St John chapter 8 this is going to be so now the executive order came down you can't work at home or whatever it might might be it came down and now it's down to the employee to the government employee or the corporate employee in this case it comes down to one of God's elect one of God's people St John 8 verse one Jesus went up under the Mount of Olives early and early in the morning he came into the temple and all the people came unto him and he sat down and taught them and the scribes and the Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery and when they had set her in their midst they said unto him Master this woman was taken in adultery in the very act now Moses in the law commanded us we're going to hear the seventh commandment here now Moses in the law commanded us that such should be stoned what sayest thou this they said tempting him that they might have accused him but Jesus St down and with his finger wrote on the ground as though he heard them not so he ignored them when they said it and they're like Hey listen the the the executive order comes down the command the seventh commandment came down from Jehovah God himself through the prophet Moses now Jesus what are you going to do about it and they knew that Jesus loved the people they knew that he had a burden for sinners in fact they criticized him for for fellowshipping with Sinners so when they continued asking him he lifted up himself and said unto them he that is without sin among you let him first cast a stone at her so there they are standing there they're ready to exact judgment on this woman judgment according to the Bible and he again stooped down and rode on the ground and they which heard it being convicted by their own conscience thank God that they had a conscience convicted by their own conscience show that there was something in them went out one by one beginning at the eldest probably the wisest and even unto the last and Jesus was left alone and the woman standing in the midst when Jesus had lifted up himself and saw none but the woman he said unto her woman where are those thine accusers hath no man condemned thee imagine how she felt there she was she deserved it don't forget we always want to talk about this woman as as being um you know just a blessing and and being sweet and and being innocent and all that she was not innocent she was a sinner sleeping with another woman husband and caught in the very act you know I've heard the question asked well where was the man in all this how come he didn't get punished you don't know that he didn't get punished he may have very well been stoned he may have very well been killed or he may have got away with it somehow but the fact is that this is that this is concentrating on this woman because she was a Believer I believe if the man was a Believer he'd probably be written in here but this woman was real she was she was special she said where are thine accusers she said no man Lord and Jesus said to her neither do I condemn thee go and sin no more so the adulterous woman who according to the letter of the law the letter of the executive order should have been stoned to death but as this trickled down this this commandment came down from God and she was at the person that deals directly with her this man Jesus Christ there is no mediator between God between God and man except for the man Christ Jesus and here is a perfect example of that woman dealing as we would say directly with her boss and him taking him taking the responsibility for it and he says here right neither do I condemn you you're justified in this then spake Jesus and then neither do I condemn thee and then he says this go and sin no more you know if you keep doing it then you're showing I really don't believe in my salvation I really don't believe in this so I'm going to just keep doing this because it's not really real to me but Jesus says no he doesn't just give her a cart Blan he says don't do it again don't sin anymore then Jesus spake unto them saying I am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of Life he's saying that I am the Fulfillment of the law I am the word made flesh I am the light of the world I am the one who brings understanding to the word I am the one who brings the spirit of the law to your understanding if we just follow the letter of the law in in Le in legal terms you have the spirit of the law which is what we should be doing and then you have the letter of the law and no one can survive the letter of the law but God wrote the law in a certain spirit and it wasn't to destroy God wrote this the the law in the Holy Spirit and it was for salvation so that means you don't take the Ten Commandments now you don't take the Old Testament I hear so often well that's Old Testament we have Grace now that's true to a certain extent but we still do have that Old Testament Jesus said that thou shalt not commit adultery as I said the seventh commandment but then he said but you still commit adultery if you look at a woman and you want to have an affair with that woman you're still committing adultery that's the spirit of the law you may not have done it but you're still guilty if we walked in the spirit of the law then we wouldn't have to worry about the letter of the law because we wouldn't be sinning because we would know that that spirit is speaking through me I shouldn't say this because that's a lie and then that we wouldn't need forgiveness of that sin if we walk in the spirit of the law but the letter of the law is hard and it says you lied you're going to hell but if we walk in the spirit of the law we see that oh I'm getting close and if you walked in the if if people that cheat on their wives or cheat on their husband if they would walked in the spirit of the of the law they wouldn't have even got close to that because Jesus said if you just if you just want to if you just desire to that you've committed adultery with her already in your heart then you would not step over that line because you know that this this spirit this holy spirit that wrote the law I need to stay far away from that that's the difference between the letter and the spirit Jesus produced the spirit the Pharisees said to him thou bearest record of thyself thy record is not true so when we have an executive when we have an executive order the seventh commandment Thou shalt not commit adultery then you should be stoned this came down from the headquarters and they said listen your testimony isn't true because she should be stoned you're speaking of yourself you're wrong Jesus and Jesus answered them and said though I be record of myself yet my record is true for I know whence I came and whether I go but I cannot tell whence I come and whether I go you judge after the flesh now listen to this this is good you judge after the flesh but I judge no man you know why he judges no man because he was judged he was judged for me he was judge for you he took the judgment and yet if I judge my judgment is true for I am not alone but I and the and the father that sent me he's saying that I'm not in this by myself I and the father are one we're in this together so why is if we are in this together and we look and Jesus went to the cross for us he took that blame so why is the cross so important why do we have it sitting here in the back of the in the back of the church why do you see crosses on Christian churches because it's everything it's when the law came down I should have been judged I should go to hell as all of you should and any person that's really walked the earth except for Jesus Christ we should all be condemned but because of the Cross because he went there and he took that that punishment for me I don't have to go and then he says to the woman he says now go and sin no more don't do it again look at what I did for you and if you really love that person that that take that took that from you would you want to keep doing it so he has to keep taking your blows and he has to keep paying your debt if you really love Jesus no you wouldn't want to do it he says if you love me keep my Commandments why would he say that I'm going to keep having to answer for you I'm going to keep having to take your punishment if you love me keep my Commandments your life will be better and you'll be a better you everything will be better and then you won't be always you you won't always be condemned by the grace of God we not the Lord Jesus he turned he came with a message that just turned everything upside down people had never heard the things that he he said he says if someone hates you then you love that person these are Commandments these are executive orders from Jesus if someone hates you then you love that person someone steals from you then you give them more than they stole pray pray for your enemies not just your friends who are having trouble that means pray for the weasel young man who's trying to take your daughter out that's rough and don't kill him either it's another commandment I've gotten close pray for the IRS agent who's auditing your taxes pray for the person who is tormenting you at work pray for the woman who's gossiping about about you pray for that person who is a problem to you Jesus commands it it's an executive order you have to pray for them you have to help them even if you can't stand them and you need to love them so change the way that you think Executive Order says Thou shalt not covet and Jesus is very plain remember he turned everything upside down the thing that you want the most in the world sacrifice I your desire for that thing to God again straight from the top don't covet the thing that you want the most thing that you desire the most give it to God it may be your family it may be riches may be popularity it may be a position it may be a job Lord I give it to you I'm going to work as hard as I can I'm going to do everything that I can I want to I want to be right but in the end Lord I give my desires to you we went on Wednesday night we talked about prayer and the key to prayer and the key to having your pray prayer answered is to get down before the Lord and get into the spirit of God so now it's not your desires not your Covetous desires that you want something but now God begins to speak through you and it becomes his will and that's the key to prayer and that's the key to every that's that's the key don't covet if you want something give it over to God remember I gave my heart to the Lord when I was 21 my 21st birthday and the thing that I asked I want to get married I wouldn't have a family the one thing I ask God I said Lord I'm giving my life to you I'm not living this sinful life anymore would you give me a wife and I said but even if you don't I'm still going to serve you for the rest of my life that's and then he gave me the best wife I could ever have imagined I never I never knew being married could be so great but I sacrificed and I was fully willing if if I never get married it's fine Lord I'm going to serve you now in closing I want to go through this Parable we've been go we've started on the series of Parables and I think it goes well and that's the parable of the tower Luke chapter 14:25 it's probably one that that if you don't read your Bible um a lot you probably don't even know this Parable Luke 14 verse 25 and there went great multitudes with them and he turned and said unto them now let me just stop right there and there went great multitudes with Jesus so there's thousands of people with him remember that when he fed the 5,000 there's 5,000 people and here it says there's great multitudes so there's all of these thousands of people they're they're all following him and he's going along and all of a sudden he turns and he said to them so the spirit must have said tell them this very important he turned right around and all of these thousands of people started listening let me ask you this if there were thou thousands and thousands are following Jesus all the time why why were there only 12 in the upper room think about that all of these people following Jesus and all when he came into Jerusalem on his on his on the on the donkey and they were singing hosan and throwing their garments and throwing the Palm leaves on PA Palm Sunday this triumphant King and all the whole city was was celebrating why only 120 of them stayed with it wow Jesus turned with all of these people and he said If any man come to me and hates not his father and mother and wife and children and brother and sister yay and his own life also he cannot be my disciple that's Jesus is that's a I think it's called by the Jewish idiom it means something else he's not saying that you have to hate anybody what he is saying is that you that Jesus first of all he was all about love and he told us many times not to hate he's saying that if you don't love them less than you love me then you're not worthy of me love them less love everything less than you love me if you want to be my disciple and I I know that because it tells the same story there's a parallel scripture in Matthew 10 you don't have to turn there we can stay in Luke Matthew 10:37 says this he that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me basically Jesus needs to be the first person in our life and whosoever does not bear his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple what does that mean bear the cross the cross was the most feared thing in the Roman Empire it was this heartless terrible punishment it struck fear into everyone when you saw someone carrying a cross down the road you knew that person was condemned to death that person is soon going to be hanging up there and dying a slow painful death the most painful death that the Romans had was the cross so you see somebody walking with the cross to the city you know that person is going to suffer like you would never believe and then Jesus says if you don't take up your cross and follow after me then you're not worthy of Me Jesus said earlier in Luke he makes a statement we'll stay in Luke 14 but in Luke 99 he says and he said to them all if anyone desires to come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me this is not a one-time thing I can't go back to the day I gave my heart to the Lord Jesus I can't go back to my 21st birthday Jesus requires more than that he requires every day going back to the day that we gave our heart to the Lord going back to that we have to be careful that we'll just stay there that is the beginning of a journey that go goes on really into eternity every day should be serving the lord every day should be taking up that cross and following him you may you may go back to the to the day that you came to the altar you may come back to the day that you spoke in tongues or you were filled with the Holy Spirit but you need to keep going past that how can you move Beyond it how can you have a closer walk with Jesus it's if it's not an everyday thing I know that we can go back to those times as as a point of faith and I do often but continue on and Jesus said you bear that cross that shame you bear it every day he requires that and we wonder why we haven't moved past we wonder why we haven't progressed as a body of Believers as Christianity why why have we not progressed because you're not taking up your cross daily every day and following him the musicians could come and uh I'll be a few more minutes and sister Jessica also Galatians 2:20 says I have been crucified with Christ it is no longer I who live but Christ lives in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me I do not set aside the grace of God he's saying I don't set aside that for if righteousness comes through the law then Christ died in vain if righteousness comes down just from that executive order then Christ done died in vain because we all fall short but it's that Spirit of the law that Jesus Christ fulfilled and then he paid the price back to Luke ver vers 28 for which of you intending to build a tower said is not on let's uh sister L let's wait just a minute um for which of you intending to build a tower sth not down first and cth the cost whether he have sufficient to finish it lest happily after he laid the foundation and is not able to finish it all that be that behold it begin to mock him saying this man began to build and was not able to finish so he's saying and you start this journey you make this decision right that this is going to be your life and you are going to finish this this whole thing and you're going to be completely surrendered to Christ do you ever see that Stephanie and I moved away in I don't know what was it like 2004 that we moved to Jeffersonville and before we moved there was this guy on I 10 that uh he bought all of this land on the west side of I 10 between Tucson and Phoenix and he had he started putting up these towers in the desert you've seen it if you have ever driven there and he was putting up signs that said wanted used Carnival equipment and he wanted to build this this great big amusement park well he put up some towers and and when Stephanie and I came back we're drive driving through Phoenix it's like wow the towers are still there and the guy did absolutely nothing over the past 17 years and he becomes a laughing stock you started this project but you won't finish it you started being a Christian but does everybody at your school see you as a Christian does everybody at your work see you as a Christian or do you become a laughing star do they make fun of you they should be looking up to you and admiring you or what king is going to make war against another king sth not down first and consult whether he be able with 10,000 to meet him that cometh against him with 20,000 or else while the other is yet AAR off he sendeth an ambassage and desired desireth conditions of Peace So what he's saying here is if you're going to go to battle with this other Army you better be ready because if you're the King Kings were not treated well after they lost a battle in the Bible you know that um zedekiah I believe it was lost the battle with Nebuchadnezzar Here Comes NE Nebuchadnezzar lines up his sons kills them all in front of him then gouges out his eyes in other places they would parade this King through through the through the The Village or through the kingdom have people put their foot on his neck because he lost this battle he's saying before you go you better weigh this out this is an important important decision that's how it is with us I put up the funny picture of trump quit skipping church church is part of it church is important consider the consequences of ignoring the executive order to take up your cross and follow Jesus consider the consequences of not forgiving your brother consider the consequences of speaking gossip about a sister consider the consequences of your language consider the consequences of giving your life to Christ and not sticking with it consider the consequences of putting God second or third or fourth or last in your life are you really too busy are you really too busy really are you too busy to come to church are you too busy to pray are you too busy to study your Bible is getting your way what is really important to you or is it following Christ's leading attending church tithing lending a helping hand taking somebody out out to lunch who just needs a shoulder to cry on and listening to them a ear just lending your ear here to someone means so much I know brothers and sisters I I counsel people I know a lot of times people just they need to get it out they need somebody who really cares but are you too busy for that you're too busy to do anything that doesn't serve yourself that's the world and I say that a lot but that's the way the world teaches today Jesus says so likewise whosoever he be of you that forsakes not all that he hath he cannot be my disciple Jesus requires everything go [Music] back he said you might ask what do I need to do what do I need to do brother you you you talk about this but you never tell me what exactly I need need to do Peter at the day of Pentecost he gave an executive order from God when they asked him the same thing he said repent he said go back from your sins May there be something inside of you that you know that you are a sinner that you know you've done something wrong go back repent and then be bap AP ized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins for take the taking away of your [Music] sins the executive Authority from God was death Hell In The Grave for every one of us and here is Jesus and he says she's Justified with what she did she's justified in her lies she's justified in her immorality he is Justified in all of his sin sins because I take the punishment for it and that's no longer and then we say Lord I lay my sins on you you took you took the authority there this came from the father it came down to me you wiped it away and now Lord what I want I don't want it to be no I don't want it to be me any longer I read that scripture in galations I have been crucified with Christ now I'm taking out my cross now I am following Jesus Jesus a cross is a shameful burden that we have to bear I'm taking up my cross I've been crucified with Christ then Galatians 2:20 says it is no longer I who live but Christ lives in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me I do not set aside the Great of God for if righteousness comes through the law then Christ died in vain once again and no longer I who live but Christ in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me sister Jessica sang that song so beautifully at Harmony in the desert and I asked her to close with that if you could sister Jessica no longer I who live but Christ in

grave Hallelujah you brought me back to life amen the song written after that scripture in Galatians how beautiful he did he brought us back to life I was dead in my sins I was dead in my trespasses I was living a life that was meaningless but God brought me back and he brought me back to life did he bring you back to life brothers and sisters it means so much it's a simple simple story brother Braham said one time Christ preached the whole sermon on it Christ is the mystery of God revealed all the mysteries of God they are represented in Jesus Christ and if we can just know him if we can just understand him if we can just understand what he did in our lives that's the most important thing it's not all of this stuff we love all of we we love all of the Bible we love all of the word but it's all based on this it's all based on Jesus Christ and him alone and if we can Tru truly understand that and truly understand what he did for us the simple analogy of an executive order coming down and your boss taking the blame for you Jesus Took the ultimate blame for us so your sins in your life the things that you have done wrong that man 33 years old he answered for us Brother Juan there's nobody else there's no other mediator between God and man only the man Christ Jesus he is right there between the law and me if it's the if it's the letter of the law I am condemned to hell but I'm not condemned to Hell by his merits I am saved by the blood of Jesus Christ are you a Christian brothers and sisters are you Christians brother James are you a Christian this morning it's so important

how great great thou are How Great Thou Art when sings my soul my savior God to me how great thou how great thou let's bow our heads ask with all of our heads bowed thinking what God did for us the son not sparing he didn't spare his own son that we might be saved and what that man Jesus Christ did for me [Music] if it was just for me I think he would have done it if it was just for this man standing in the pull pit I believe he would have done it just for me but he did it for you too friends if there is sin in your life that you want to get rid of if there was something that is hurting you that's separating you you from this man Jesus Christ don't let the devil do it place it into his hands and do your best and then it'll help you if there's something that you need from God and he's looking down now if there's something you have on your heart that say Lord I need this from you would you just raise your hand and hold that thing that you want help with just hold it in your heart say Lord here is my confession before you with an uplifted hand Lord I need you and I commit this day to taking up my cross and following in your bloody Footprints Heavenly Father the Son of God came
