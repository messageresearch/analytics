just something about that name you may be seated brother Graham says when you begin to talk about him he draws draws now you know so that would tell you when you begin to talk about the negative then the negative withdrawn draw nigh - so just there so we do have a few things to share with you in prayer requesting some announcements ooh I had written down here I'll probably ask brother Matt to sing I know who I have believed in after the service but he's saying it already so I was looking I said I don't know if I can sing it my brother Matt can cuz we know who we have believed it yes and I am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I've committed to him and by committing it to him you give it into his hands you take your hands off of it Lord I'm gonna help you fix this no no committed to him give it to him so we do have a couple of prayer requests and things to mention here sister Rachel Peterson let us know that sister Kelly Fenton had a stroke and sister sister Claire she's requesting a prayer for both of them they just lost their brother been here just not too long ago and my sister Kelly had been in dialysis and also let's remember them at this hour my daughter Naomi is requesting a prayer for a cousin Melissa Valenzuela does cousin on my my wife's side of the family doctors removed cancer in early June and have since found two more forms of cancer she will be beginning chemotherapy on July 9th Aziz she's in her early 40s my daughter Rachel Housel request prayer for a co-worker named March she's had several blackouts episodes recently and they they don't know why the last episode she lost the use of her hand and so they're just believing for a full restoration but she'sshe's a bit of Indian descent there and she's been quite every time she works here in the little place that the restaurant - herb sandwich means to shop there Rachel works and she's so friendly so nice to us just always greeting us and talking to us so you know sometimes somebody just means something to you and and you say well maybe they can call up to God for themselves maybe they can and maybe that would be your place to reach out and touch the Lord and a couple more that we heard of we heard him brothers act Iran was tested positive for the kovetz so his wife and his children there don't know anymore beyond that but we'll remember him and then we have some good friends back in California they were parents were very close to my parents and their boys were good friends of artisan every one of them of the Danny and David and Esther all were in the hospital from kovat and now the dad brother Abel and the mom sister Naomi and and dad's about 88 89 and mom's about 82 and they've just been taken to the hospital also and they were there were very good friends of ours even growing up as a young man I always appreciated them so they'd asked that we remember them in prayer and then my boss his name is Jim Briggs we've been working together abut for about 25 years now or so and he's been a good a good boss to work under and he's always treated me well he's gone out of his way for me he's always told me I want you to stay here I don't want you to I don't want to lose you and he's let us use his cabin several times at no charge and just just been a good friend but he he's separated his tendons or something in his elbow and has been quite painful and then his father is is mr. Briggs is 94 and he's been losing his balance and falling Jim takes care of his dad so I just asked him when we would remember him also if you have a need you'd be willing to raise your hand them and say Lord would you would you be mindful of me if we would stand up together and want to ask for the Jeremy to come up and take these requests in prayer if you would with the Jeremy for us and how many knows that God hears your prayers how many go knows how many experienced God hearing a prayer in a street and you know who and whom you have believed and so brother Jeremy would you do that for us today thank you [Music] but for for this opportunity to come before you lord to turn aside and look look toward you lord we we are in need beautiful people we have needful friends we we look look to your word Lord and that says that we are more more than able to believe that you can do these things we just ask your father to meet every need we ask you to bless a congregation here bless our fellowship would be her fell chef Lord was the minister as he comes and ministers unto us Lord let us hear from you individually not that we have an agenda to minister Lord but to do something on their hearts I know know that you are mindful of us we just ask you Lord to be our God let us know it let us perceive it well let's give you all the praise the glory and honour in your precious name Lord Jesus Christ amen amen thank Jesus there's just [Music] ah say [Music] the right [Music] let all have and Oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] others amen we'd also like to make welcome our sister Sharon Rasmussen is that right from Washington I understand you moved down here is that right welcome god bless you and just trusted you chose the right season to come the monsoons are starting to sound I thank the Lord for that one scripture before we're Cena let's look at 1st Samuel chapter 30 verse 6 Thank You musicians god bless you and we've recently heard two different ministers use this scripture but just let me just share it one time and David was greatly distressed for the people speak of stoning him because the soul of the people are grieved every man for his sons and for his daughters but David encouraged himself in the Lord his God so amen David encouraged himself in the Lord that you may be seated just that was not the thought that I had last Saturday it was looking at been listening to the rapture message and thinking about faith and all but today or actually Monday and Tuesday we were up in Phoenix and Queen Creek area working helping up up there and the last three days we drove about 550 miles for approximately eleven jobs I can do that in town at about 50 miles for 11 jobs so I was a little what say no frustrated a little bit and it's a lot of miles for 11 jobs and but today as I was I was driving here in town working in town and I was headed down to the east side of town and felt God just beginning to speak to me and just saying but you don't have a reason to be discouraged you have reason to be encouraged and and he reminded me through all that David went there he encouraged himself in God in the Lord his God now at a god far away a God he heard about someone else told him but a god that he knew and I began to look at then I say Lord you know and I had been looking at brother Branham says faith and faith is a revelation and my heart had leaned towards revelation comes not just because you heard it but because you've experienced it a become God becomes real to you it becomes personal to you not because somebody else told you about him because you've met him yourself so this my heart was come a little bit that way but I just began to encourage myself and the Lord began to encourage me and just say you have no reason to be discouraged um I promised to be with you never leave you I am here I've kept you you know you just you drove 550 miles ago nothing going wrong you know you have other people to suffered this past week or you know but God has been good to us and my wife had her eye surgery on Monday and got a very good report yesterday and and no blood shot in her eyes and all and and you have just she said make sure you thanked the congregation for their prayers I talking to another brother today and they had lost a important document and they were looking to somewhere they never thought they'd find it there it was they were both rejoicing in the Lord God is mindful of us so you know I was encouraging that and I so I got home and I I remembered this scripture and I looked up but David encouraged himself in the Lord his God because you can begin to look around and hear the the complaints or the criticisms or the moaning and groaning or whatever it is of others and it can drag you down you know it can weigh on you and sometimes you see the suffering of others and and you know in whom you have believed in and he's able because he's shown it to you over and over and over but you look at them sometimes and say they have nothing to turn to and sometimes if you're not careful you can stand up in a little self-righteousness and say huh but I have God and you don't but if your heart is right you would say oh that they would know this same God that I've gotten to know oh that they could experience him you know you've heard it many a times and here in the rapture message brother Branham brings that there where he's speaking of the the mother Eagle that had lost that one one egg and she said I knew there was two so she went out searching and this this eagle had been born in the chicken yard and and brother Graham really tells how the eagle was never comfortable there and didn't understand the language and was trying to eat the food and it just wasn't good at all and and mothers is flying around looking for that that other that other eaglet of hers and when she spots him she cries out and something responds oh that sounds right and I don't know how many I have heard say huh I'm an eagle and they're not was such a haughty attitude and today I heard it again and I just said Lord I am an eagle but there was no haughtiness with it just a creep I've been going to thank the Lord that I can't answer to that that I can respond to that then my heart was glad to hear that scream but then my heart began to think of others Lord how about them how about my brother my sister how about my neighbor how about others Lord I don't know if they are not but could they hear it could they respond to it and and so he just began to encourage me and then I I went to Isaiah chapter 41 verses 4 through 7 I looked up the word encouraged and it was only used like four times in the scriptures the actual word and Harry says in Isaiah 41 we'll we'll go who hath wrought and done it calling the generations from the beginning his question asking a question he said I the Lord the first and with the last I am he who has who has performed all of this who has done all he says I have he's the only one they can talk like that and be honest about it and not be boasting and being wrong because he is more than able he's proved it the isle saw it and feared the ends of the earth were afraid junior and came all of it realized who he was pennies are there and then he says they helped everyone his neighbor and everyone said to his brother be of good courage now I wasn't looking at the one that David said he encouraged himself but I didn't really didn't know this scripture was there and he says so the carpenter encouraged the Goldsmith and he that smooth it with a hammer him that smote with the anvil and he says saying it is ready for the soldering and he fastened it with nails that it should not be moved he began to say look this one encouraged that one and this one said you're doing your part I'm doing my part we're in this together and they encourage one another so we all kind of have a good idea of what it is to encourage someone hey brother you're almost making it but I'm ahead of you boy that's encouraging in it hey brother I'm faster than you that's why you're back there no I wouldn't call that encouragement you know but but encouragement says to talk and remember our conversation is not just words it's a life you live to talk or behave in a way that gives someone confidence to do something if someone would look at your life your conversation hear the words you speak and say yes I can if God has done it through them he can do it through me and then someone who has met God can say Lord if you've done it for me you can do it for them to encourage to hearten to cheer to buoy up to uplift to inspire to motivate to invigorate to spur on to stir to stir up fire up stimulate revitalize and Boldin fortify to rally there's a lot of ways there to encourage someone you know there's there's light at the end of the tunnel I've been through this tunnel you're going through I've been through this portion of life but there was light and there's light for you too you know now the opposite of that is to discourage to dishearten to dispirit to stand there and say you know I don't know God seems you know the scripture told us that they came to a place where they said he delayeth his coming and they began to live away that was disheartening that was discouraging and sometimes we can if we're not careful we can discourage somebody with our actions and our words but there is so much to be encouraged about to look and say Amen God never fails he said if the Sun rises every morning like it does he said so will I keep my promises and he says you know brother Matt brought it very well and he's talking about when he spoke to us at the beginning and just encouraged us to to to be careful in all and people that said it can't the sickness can't get to us and in this and the other then why would he say I am the lord that healeth all thy diseases because he knew they would come but he had already made a provision for it so you don't have to live in fear you don't have to be afraid you could be like job they say though God slay me yet I'll trust him anyways brother Branham says if I pray for 500 today and all $500 I'm gonna pray for 500 more tomorrow why because God's Word doesn't fail now sometimes we need to encourage ourselves also we need to remind ourselves brother Branham said he's driving down the road on his car and Satan would come and sit in the seat next to him and began to question him what about that and what about this and what about that and if you began to listen to it you'll begin to question it yourself - did he really say that was that really true did know then brother Brown would say ok but then what about this and what about this what about this time what about this instance and Satan would have to give up meleave when he sees he's not going to discourage you but you're gonna turn and just put it right back and he says I'm gonna go find somebody else I can discourage the conversation the life we live the words we speak can encourage and discourage both but he says he encouraged himself in the Lord his God and he's your God he's my god he says they helped everyone his neighbor and everyone said to his brother be of good courage don't look at the symptoms but look at the one and the promise that he gave look at what God said and and I asked you how many know him because you've experienced him how many willing to raise our hand and say yes I've experienced it's not it's not because daddy told me it's not because because the pastor said it's not even because brother but because I've met God myself in my time of trouble and in when I least expected it maybe he came by and he met me you know so look at that and then so so I was looking at and I was encouraging myself and I'd got home early today I was home by about 1:00 o'clock this afternoon so it gave me time to to finish some other work that I had to do and then do a little more studying and and I began to look at some more things here a little bit more of the rapture tape and you know but I did because I got home late yesterday and and I was tired and I told my wife I said I'm a lay down and take a little nap well little can be to somebody this big little could be this big to somebody might it was this big this time fell asleep around 6:30 and I didn't wake up till 4:00 in the morning but it was just a little nap and and so I didn't read the daily strength till this afternoon and I I try to read it every night and just see what is so daily strengthened I don't know how many of you get that but it's he quoted the scripture Philippians 4 9 so if we could pull up I didn't give you this one but if we could pull up Felipa philippians 4 9 and this is paul speaking in it if it's so perfect with what what would have been my heart those things which he have both learned and received and heard and seen in me do and the God of peace shall be with you now that's not speaking of me that's Paul speaking here as the first age messenger he's telling those things which you have both learned and how do you learn by experience in it by being around it we can all have a teacher in the school and in class that we did some book learning but the best experience is when you start doing it yourself that's how you really learn how to do it Jesus and received you have to receive it you have to say Amen to it and you've heard with the years going down to your heart becoming a revelation and you've also seen it in those around you whether it's your husband your wife your mother your father a minister a friend whatever you've seen God work you've seen it in yourself do he says put it into practice all right so let's just read how he put it all all the disciples had a courage about them to do the work they were called to do they had all sense of urgency because they had witnessed with their eyes the Savior and had been in my heart not just seeing somebody but being part of it experiencing it yourself Paul was one although he'd never been with Jesus as a disciples till he had witnessed many events that were going on at the time he had an anointing to do the things which had to be done to live for the Lord to preach to pray to spread the good news and to endure hardships so that comes with the package that comes as brother grain used to say with the benefits package you will endure hardships because the other way if there's nothing hard you will never grow you will never mature you know so you go through some testing but when he writes when he writes to the Philip it Philippians he says sure I do all these things but make sure that you do them also a teacher is teaching you so that you can participate so that you can that you can go out and do it you know why go to class if you're not going to if you're going to become go to school for a specific sister Holly there in medical go to whatever amount of time it was but with no plans to go on to medical field then why go to class but you go with that intention to learn but to put what you've learned into practice you know and so he says do them also when he writes the word do which in the Greek is I think you say press it which is where we get our English to practice it literally means just do to go out and practice put it into use how do you learn by doing it and doing it doing it those that those of you that have done whatever your trade is brother Merle and them with the sight of the family there that did all the sheetrock and the finishing I watched some of those guys in the house and they make it look so easy and then I go try to do it and it doesn't come out the same because that's not what I do but they do them watching them the boys if they come in and have to do a repair on a patch job and they blend it right in to look like it was part of the job in the first place but they have years of practice doing it and that's a as a Christian you might see somebody saying boy they seem to well they've done it a time or two or ten or 100 and the same with you you put these things that you have learned into practice into daily doing he's telling us here thus we have the old phrase practice makes perfect when you practice you have to have two things an understanding of what you are practicing and a goal practice practice practice to achieve nothing no you practice because you have an expectation a place you want to get to you want to get to that place where you hear well done thou good and faithful servant so what do you you put those things you have learned into practice you begin to do those things he says our understanding should be the image of Christ that should be our goal not to make our name known well known in the message not to make our name well known in this world but to be like Christ that's it that is our the image before us we see we see that very clearly we should press towards that what we see the mark of your high calling our goal should be to attain perfection now we heard last Sunday perfection being perfect the most frustrating part we have is the this part that we wear that we inhabit because that's the one we want to see perfect I'm waiting for this outer man to become perfect have no flaws no faults never get upset never get mad always smiling never it hasn't happened yet it hasn't happened to any single human Adam and Eve were creative God and they fell now we know God caused it allowed that to express but therefore each after I said you shall die so this outer man and brother Matt laid it out very well he's looking for a heart an attitude of a person they would say like David a man after God's own heart so but does that mean while I could care less what the flesh looks like no we want to bring it into subjection we want to harness it under as much as we can - what - God's will is he tells us how we should act he tells us what spirit we should be if he tells us what attitude we should take he tells us how to dress he tells us men how to act and and sisters how to act in everything and and that's what we strive for you know it if we would look just like everybody else in the world nobody would know we're a Christian there is a mark of a Christian there there is a way a Christian carries himself and God himmat but he knows that you can't do it by herself but he can do it through you and that is where you you're learning to walk this life with him guiding you with him leading you so he says we look we put Christ as our goal and when you put that before you that's what you're walking towards that's what your aim is not I remember back as a young man probably 14 or 15 years old right before the message game or right about that time the church we had gone till had believed that you had to speak in tongues in order to a to - received the Holy Spirit that was the evidence of the Holy Ghost speaking in tongues and and it was one of those things that they did it they put fear in you if you didn't speak in tongues you're going to help you know and so they had a minister come through through the church and and he was well known as a brother who could help you speak in tongues so I went up to the altar because I had not spoken in tongues so I listened to the man as he's praying over me and he's teaching you how to speak in tongues he's China so I learned quickly that if I just did that I'd have the tongue I'd have the Holy Ghost so I just mutter to feel those words and he said he's got it he's got it yet I knew I didn't get anything but to to say he got it so they everybody would be happy about it I did it now it's nothing to brag about but it's what happened I remember coming home from school and-and-and wondering if I don't find mom at home now I knew dad was working but mom was always home if I didn't find mom at home did the rapture take place already I don't know if anybody else went through that but I went through a stage in my life if mom wasn't home the rapture might have taken place I better find out because dad was working okay it's funny now but it wasn't funny when you're 12 14 years old and you believe there's going to be a rapture and you know you're not ready to go so you're looking for it you're pressing for it you're trying to find it everything but Paul tells us stay with what the Word of God says and that's what you press towards that's what you keep you keep Christ in front of you the st. church that we belong to then later on they were they were and I was just before we came the message was coming just before we came one of the the young men he was president of the the youth of that section of the California we lived in and they were going around and they had these SOS packages stood for save one soul and he was trying to get my brothers four years older so there was more addressed to him trying to get him to buy one I don't remember what the cost was and it came with some tracks and a little bit so my I remember my brother asked him do I really have to have one of these to save us all and finally goes no but if I sell the most I get to go on a trip to Hawaii me as a young man said oh my god really is this what we have come to selling salvation putting a different picture up front I'm not looking for a trip to Hawaii I'm looking to go home I'm looking for a change of this mortal to immortality where I don't have to deal with this guy anymore he's the one that gives me most of my problems if not all of them but here we have a goal set and we're going to practice or we're going to continue to do or we're going to what do they say practice makes perfect well you got a practice right you can practice the wrong thing but you can practice that which is right he says our understanding is the image of Christ we see very clearly that what we should press toward the mark of the high calling our goal should not to be to attain perfection but our goal should be complete surrender so he can perform the work because you can't do it on your own okay we had we must put these things we have learned seen and heard into practice part of our daily living and sometimes I find myself and like like today the Lord is just speaking to my heart and I was rejoicing driving down the road and I'm saying Lord how come I just can't be like this all the time and I think he said well I it can be like that with me all the time what about you it's not him it's it's me you know so later on and in the evening or late afternoon I was I was getting had gotten everything and I sent the brothers the the information so that they they could post it and all and and I was just kind of laid back and again he just began to encourage my heart laying there in the bed and I was trying to rest and I'm saying man I just feel like jumping up and shouting her right now so I I put on more of the rapture tape and even more and I got up and I took my wife goes are you gonna get ready to go to church now I said no it's a little early is about three hours still but I just can't slow down it's burning in my heart you know just I want that Lord and and so he's just I'm put things into practice when someone sets out to play an instrument regardless how talented they may be or gifted they don't have a mastery level the first time they play it it takes some learning it takes some repetition it takes a lot of wednesdays in a lot of Sunday's and it just for the musicians to work you know sometimes it seemed like musicians can come up just sit down and everybody play but you don't know the hours spent behind it sometimes to get to that point you know there's a the potential is there but they simply have not practiced to bring out the potential it's the same way with a Christian walk we must put what we hear what we see what we know into practice you you know who you want to be like so practicing and surrender constantly and constantly watch the potential already inside of you come out and that's the best part it's in you already brother branham in the rapture tape as his ministering he begins talking about the seed and he says Billy Paul was in me already but I didn't know that and Billy Paul didn't know that but God did and he begins that time for Billy Paul became to be born and you're typing that to a spiritual life you were part of God you had to be part of God for eternal life it's it's Scripture you know that God has made it clear to us you know some people talk about it being on the back part of back side of God's mind wherever it is that's okay you were there he knew you by name already who knew who you were just like that mother Eagles saying there's one more I've got to go call that one I don't know when that last one's coming in but God has every one of his children so here we are where we want to be like Jesus there's a lot of work that goes to be there it's a lot of yielding a lot of surrendering a lot of times to say not my will but because a lot of times our will is what gets us in trouble lord help me to say you lord you first in all things yeah so then practice makes perfect but make sure you're practicing that which you you wanta with that target you know if you practice the song wrong the whole time well you're gonna do it wrong sister good speed was probably probably the only piano player that I ever played with who would stop in the middle of the song and tell me it doesn't go that way nobody else ever did that to me but she played it by note and she played it the way it went and if I very hated she would stop or very just change it she'd go it doesn't go that way when we went to Indiana and got to spend some time with Loras and Karen Ralph why I took my saxophone he had asked me and he had and he wrote up the music we were going to play a duet and it been years since I read read music and after about four tries he said forget it you pick a song and I'll play the piano and you just play it because he had it all laid out and I couldn't do it I hadn't done it for years I'm glad that he has mercy on us and he'll say I'll help you live it all live in you to do it brother Branham says that don't mean perfection in yourself you can't be then but you see even our people are getting away from the practice of holiness there's something you can practice Lord is this is this righteous before you is this holy before you is this something that would cause you to flee to to have that brother bounce that Holy Spirit just light off a little bit on the branch up there he's telling us you know practice to make yourself oh no holy no practicing what got us so that he can do that in you the the Pharisees and the Sadducees had practiced sit down to a tee how many steps to take what to wear what not to her but God looked at their heart and said your heart is a long ways from what you're doing do this part Lord and then this becoming into subjection to what God isn't and you know a husband and wife for us it'll be 41 years come in in the sixth I think next Monday there's a lot of learning there's a lot of work that goes in there's a lot of times when I say yes dear a lot of times when she says whatever you want and sometimes we don't like it because neither one will make the decision but you're both trying to yeah but there's a lot of work that goes into it why because that that's how you learn that's how you bring it didn't take God five minutes to get the whole plan done this plan has been working on in our time time and time all the way to Calvary from when he spoke it from before the foundation of the world he said he was bruised he was wounded he was slain God had a time God had a plane when he said a plan when he said this is my beloved son hear ye him there was a testing a probing time for Jesus to get to you and I the same way brother Branham says to practice holiness we began to let down so many bars see and and we get to come to that place we got to come to that place of our profession he is our example and he is our sin bearer and then if we profess that he is our peacemaker he is our propitiation then if we profess that then that is supposed to reflect him back in us I'm a Christian any more Christians here who are you saying you're reflecting Christ that's who's the wish to be reflected in us Oh Dave the Saint doesn't like that you're not going to be well loved and liked by everybody but it's who we are and we are a written epistle a lookingglass that people can see Christ in us and now if they don't then we're looking at something else we've got the wrong reflection and we're looking we're not looking to him look to him all the ends of the world and I said lord I don't probably don't even have to preach I think that all just about do it well I know what God was speaking in my heart what do you tell him you know just he was just encouraging me especially after brother man that was Joe something they helped me because I want this guy to be perfect I want him not to cause any troubles anymore I want him not to be drawn away at times but he's flesh man on the outside but I want the heart more than this guy I want the heart like David had a man after God's own heart willing to say I'm sorry when I'm wrong willing to repent willing to have some mercy and grace on others like Jesus when he walked and they brought that woman that woman that had been caught in adultery and they brought her and cast him at his feet here there some that righteous holy son of God is standing there no sin nothing about him and they throw an ill-favored woman and he looks at her he looks down to sand and he's writing and the self-righteous men that brought him are standing there say the law says to stone her to death and I don't know what he was writing different people have said he probably was writing this heap I don't know I don't profess to know but whatever he wrote had a meaning I don't think he was drawing cartoons on the ground or just whatever something was written there and then he just turns out he looks at with a simple answer okay they knew that our perfect cast the first stone because that's how they brought her the word has to be obeyed perfectly you've got to be just like this you got to be just like that and who can do it so he says you're judging that way cast the first stone they begin to look at themselves and they begin to turn and walk away because not a one of them was perfect and God looks at her and says are thine accusers and I know maybe at that point she hadn't turned and looked around yet she turns around and it goes they're gone and he says neither do i condemn thee but then he tells her go and sin no more he didn't condemn her but he didn't tell her go back and live that same life he said go and send more go and disbelieve God's word no more God is more than able encourage yourself in the Word of God because it's true its faithful by the Word of God these world the world was created and it's exactly like you said the Sun will rise and the Sun will set brother Lyle you know you I don't know how much you were involved but I know some of the things you did went up in some of the Rockets everything is precise right you couldn't be off by and that's close enough and to be very precise they know when the sun's going to rise when it's going to was gonna set why because God's laws are perfect not because the scientists figured out would they begin to study and say hey it comes up and in the rotating because God said it in motion I've always said if you're having trouble in school you're in school and you're having trouble with the subject he's really good at languages he knows them all he's really good at math because he said all the laws in order he knows all about history he laid it all out why not ask him you have not because you ask not well why would God be interested in that little boy he's interested in all for his children Abraham I mean Adam how was your day today oh it was wonderful it was this it goes how do was this he's talking with his children you know what we'd have a little bit about it when the girls were young and all the girls played violin and stringed instruments and in elementary school and they all started with the same songs can-can and mary had a little lamb and all the ones they start you with so every year the you know Naomi first and then Elizabeth and then Sarah and we would go to the concert and we knew what songs we were gonna hear same ones we heard last year the same ones we heard the year before they didn't change and as a dad and mom you had to be just as thrilled and just exciting just as happy for him even though it was a sixth one oh boy you learned how to play mary had a little lamb play it for me I've never heard it before and I were the big cheesy smile on your face that was part of it when I don't want this come around but God likes that justice really he knows all about it but he wants to hear from you he wants to know what your heart he wants you to verbalize he want you to say lord I trust you lord i love you lord i want to know you personally see my aim my goal all that one is i won't go home live with him i won't be part of that rapture experience i want that to be part of my life i want to encourage myself with the word of god you know an aim and today i was i was as i was going there as i said lord if somebody and service wants to jump up and shout at him and let him do it why not why don't one time yeah i went to a football game and nobody was yeah only nobody was shouting the band didn't play the football team didn't even run out hasn't happened yet everybody's shouting when the team comes out or be screaming and yelling people are doing oh they're all excited about it it's the same thing I've been to enough of them now to know they play the same songs over the fireworks go off when they come running out there's that the other but everybody gets all excited every time why can't we get excited when God is moving why can't we say Amen and it won't it won't hurt us and a good loud Amen might wake me up too okay but if your heart is happy just thank the Lord and praise God wherever you are so Amen I love you Lord Jesus you know and with just at my heart today and don't take it as a scolding I'm just wanting to encourage you let's love the Lord Jesus with all our heart he said he's coming soon and he keeps his word he never fails he's perfect keeps us now let's just get into a little bit we got a little bit of time do we brother Mauro just you know I don't even know what time it is yeah we got a little bit time let's go to Hebrews chapter 11 and verse verse 1 I believe it is now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen faith it's a substance it's got a reality it's it's tangible I know I have felt his presence I know he is real I know that when he is here you know he's easier he has spoken to me in an audible voice he's gotten my attention by reaching out and getting my attention I know he's real he's the same yesterday today and forever I laid in my bed one day getting ready to minister some years back and I was laying in bed resting maybe around 4 o'clock the after and just just laying there getting off after work just resting before service that night and his presence came down and physically began to bless me I know he's real I watched a healing sitting right back in that corner i watch a young lady and receiver Healy should happen God he's the same yesterday today and forever it's it's a something it's not an imagination something far away it's something you can have realize and and taste-off participate in Hebrews 11:6 both without faith it's impossible to please them that's the thing without faith brother Lord I've dressed to the T Lord I've never missed a service Lord I've paid my tithe all the time Lord I've done all this and he says but where's your faith is he going to find faith it's what he said when he comes is there gonna be a people that are gonna take him at his word and stand on it are there is there gonna be a people they're gonna believe is enough as word to become the Living Word taking them by faith without faith it's impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is he must believe that there is a God that he's real that he changes not that he hears an answers prayer that he'll walk with you he'll go with you he'll sit in the car with you and talk to you because he's done it has anybody ever experienced where he's sitting in the corn talking to you he has to me in an audible voice because I especially know because he chose to talk to me and I appreciate it very much when he does that but you know sometimes he'll use your brother and your sisters voice and it's God too we just got to be willing to listen you must believe that he is he's not a figment of somebody's about to hear is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him they're here on Sunday morning in service and the rest of the week I'm not sure where they're at I think that's what diligently means did I miss the interpretation there may be diligence somebody is seeking somebody's looking somebody's spending a lot of time come back to that I still World War two history really I really liked World War two history I don't know why but he did and and I would read some of the story some of the things the time spent and the amount of time spent to develop the things that today we would look back and say wow that's so ancient but at that time it was right up front it was the latest it was the the best and they could the men could spend hours staring at a chalkboard because one thing was wrong in there they knew because the equation wasn't working when when they were developing the atomic bomb and the chalkboards were as big as each one of those and just full of all the equations and he's standing there and I don't remember which which man it was but he stand there looking because something was wrong took him three days to find it if I remember right he walks and he said up switches it and then there it worked diligent not giving up the time when there's time you're there and sometimes you got to work but that doesn't mean that what you're working he can't be around you you can keep a good spirit a good attitude you can have a praise in your lips you can be singing a song you can be thinking about him and that's part of it you must you must be and believe that he is a rewarder that in other words in this you're going to get to spend time with him you're going to get to know him you're going to get to fellowship with him he's going to speak to you and you're going to be able to answer back and then in in Hebrews 12:2 looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith he gave it to you he will also help you finish it up he says who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God he's the author and the finisher he started he finish or he who began the good work in you will perform it you must believe it when things don't look like they're going that way when things seem to be spinning backwards when you seem to be sliding back down the hill instead of climbing he says no you are good I have seen you already on this side lord help my vision to look that way lord have you seen me then I know that I will be there my job said though God slay me yet all trust romans 1:16 and 17 for i am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth to the Jew first and then to the Greek for therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith as it is written the just shall live by faith because everything that we're doing we're not fighting against flesh and blood yes and you're not against your brother again you're not against your neighbour you're not against the Methodists or that church or this church or whatever we get we're against something that is deceptive something that you can't see with the physical eye he said but you got to live by faith and faith brother Graham said is a revelation the simplest explanation to me is revelation is something being made now something revealing you know if I had maybe something to show with a put a put something over that speaker and I'm gonna reveal it I'm just gonna remove the cover the speaker was there because I removed the cover didn't make a speaker the speaker was there it was covered God's Word is eternal it has always been there brother Bram talked about it in the heavens he talked about it written he talked about a Living Word okay but not all of it had been no and it had its time and he says you will live if I could say this by faith you will live by revelation God begins to unveil it to you God begins to make it real to you when you begin to walk in that will walk in the light what is light do it unveils it reveals it shows turn off all the lights completely right here and how many would jump out of the out of your chair and just take off running down the center aisle here hey this you know the center aisle is there right it's not going anywhere but most of us would not get up out of a chair take I've run into foot it just got pitch dark in here but turn the lights on and reveal Center wait have no problem walking down the middle of it when God begins to reveal it unveil it to show you can walk right down in it it's not a hidden mystery anymore it's not a guess at it but it's God making it richer Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen he's the one that heals all my diseases amen how because I've experienced it because I know it to be I tell you that the our old landlord when we first bought the mobile home and on a piece of property and and any saw my girls dressed as young girls with her dress and their hair combed it all and in living on the other half of the land was another family and they were living in a little RV that they put together and their kids looked a little different than my kids they were usually running around in their diapers outside and Thanks so he questioned and he asked me said where do you go to church why would he think we went to church because we look like Christians maybe kind of stranger that he would get that idea but he said what church you go to I told him the name of the church attend we are attending the Spanish Tabernacle then and he said really what do you believe I said that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever gives me a little strange look like what do you mean by that he's still a healer he's still oh no no no no no just literally stopped me right there I say I don't know how old he was he's probably in 60s or so no sir no sir all that ended with the apostle's that was the end of that and I said no sir he still Hills he and then began to share thinking he goes no no you've been deceived I'm thinking no I think it might be the other way around you know and so being and what's the name of your church so I told him oh no no there's a courtney of the scripture your church can only be doing this and they brought a scripture first and he began tell me how deceived i was and i finally all i could answer him was sir you've come a little too late to tell me that he's not the same yesterday today and forever because i've met him myself we must believe that he is and a rewarder of those and he says from faith to faith from revelation to revelation as God begins to unveil himself more and more to you he's not only my provider he's not only my healer he's also my friend he's also my comforter he's the one that supplies my every need he's my peace when there's distress on him he's my water when I'm thirsty he's my food when I'm hungry he begins to unveil all brother Brown says word upon word upon word and he begins to make himself known and I like this as we would go to Matthew chapter 8 in a this was the one that I thought of because here's a man who's a Roman a Roman centurion and there's nothing there that says that he was a Christian a believer but obviously he knew enough about Jesus had heard enough or seen enough and when Jesus was entered into Capernaum there came unto him a centurion beseech him that's a Roman soldier who was ahead of a hundred men i capped him a hundred men and asking him saying Lord my servant life at home sick of the palsy and he's grievously tormented and Jesus said I will come and heal him God was no respecter of persons he said and say now wait a minute wait a minute let me give you a test do you believe all of this do you no he just okay I'll come the Centurion sir said lord I am not worthy that thou should has come under my roof but Speak the word only and my servant shall be healed something tells me that this soldier had heard something or seen something already somebody had told him or he saw it himself I don't know for I am a man under Authority and then having soldiers under me I say unto this man go and he goeth and to another come and he cometh and to my servant do this and he does it first of all he says I'm a man in authority and I know what Authority is I have to answer to somebody - like these have to answer to me I'm told by my superior to do this and then I'm told those under me to do that he recognized God's position and when Jesus heard it he marvelled and said to them that followed verily I say unto you I have not found so great a faith no not in Israel it caught his attention I said this faith he understands my authority over that spirit he Anders my understands my position I'm over at the top of that I tell it to go and where it should and who do come in and he said just like that it works just say and it caught God's attention it stopped him on his tracks I could say and said Wow I have not found faith like this he says no not even amongst the Jewish my brother he's the same yesterday today and forever your faith can reach out and stop him on his tracks if I could say it that way in turn and he says Amen I'm responding here's one that knows and he knows that I'm a reward of them that call upon me he was marveled at it he it was amazing he had come looking for that mark 11 22 and 23 and Jesus answering saith unto them have faith in God and another translation says have the faith of God if it's God in you you should be able to have that faith because it's him and you take God at His Word and stand on it just the same way he did for verily I sent to you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but believe that those things which he said shall come to pass he shall have whatever he says Amen or oh me he's saying you he's speaking to you but your name in there I can ask but Lord I need that miracle now I'll believe it if I see that mountain jump up and run off immediately Abraham twenty-five years said God said so therefore I'm gonna stand on it so Abraham was perfect never failed never made a mistake he was flawless for 25 years that's another version of another Bible God in the history shows that Abraham had his problems because it's not the perfecting of the flesh it's in the inner man it's the man inside that brother Graham said in the control room God's Word is true I don't care what this flesh says God's Word is true and like David said Lord I failed you that man should have his life taken the Prophet Nathan says David that was you and David says Oh God have mercy on me let me repent let me say I'm sorry let me fix that now not blaming his brother now turn around and throwing the fault on somebody up and saying lord have mercy on me st. John 11 41 and 42 I finished with this here and maybe a quote or two here st. John chapter 11 verses 41 and 42 this is where Jesus is coming there with Lazarus and and you know they you know the story there what how it's written where they called him and said let your friend Lazarus is sick and and generally if someone says your friend you know we respond quickly as quick as we can as soon as we can pray for them at all and and he didn't hurry and they began to wonder oh well maybe he really wasn't his friend Jesus had a reason to do what he's going to so we come to this place now when he has told him and he says let's take me to the place race then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid and Jesus lifted up his eyes and said father I thank thee that thou hast heard me have you ever prayed that father I thank you that you hear me have you ever been his old brother that was Jesus it's you you need to come to that same place thank you Father for hearing me and I knew that thou hearest me always that's where I was going to he's never not listened to you he's never not heard you he's never turned his back on you and this is what he says I knew that thou hearest me always I've learned that I've worked with that I've come doing that and learned that in my life you've never forsaken me you've never turned your back on me you've never left me alone you've been there all along but because of the people which stand by I said it that they may believe that thou has sent me and you know what when you stand there and believe that others will take notice why is it that when they call out to God God answers but when I call out to God there seems to be no answer and they might come and ask you what is the secret how is it that you can talk to God and he answers and you can begin to share this living real God with others because who what are we here for to let others know that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever to let others know that they can have the same joy and hope that we have because I don't know who is a new ism therefore to me everyone is because I want to be included in that number also I want God to have mercy on me I know that thou hearest me always there's never a time even in my despair and even in my failures that he's ever turned his back on me and said I can't listen to you you're too ugly you're - you're too down sod you're - this year - that when that prodigal son that he talks about and he's looking at he said when he came to in that Pigpen in that mess that he had made and he said I will go back to my father's house and he says the father is here looking for that returning son he's done God is back and say boy when he gets back over here I'm gonna let him have it with both barrels know he's his heart is yearning for the fellowship that he had with his son this is no different than you and him today because she's a couple of quotes here and then we'll finish him for tonight in fact the musicians could probably go ahead and come up the first quote there from the message called Joe if a man once under the blood feels afraid that God won't keep his word it's an insult to him to God you're insulting God when you're questioning whether he keeps his word is something you're saying you're just like us God because I can't always keep my word you bring into him down to a level that he's not he says say Jehovah perhaps this is your word but I don't know whether it's right or not Oh shame on you why once under the blood he said I am the lord that he lathy I believe it that's all don't insult him take God his word and stand on it he says he said he that cometh unto me I will in no wise cast out I believed it once coming under the take his word for anything he says and every believer here it is get it every man or woman that has once been brought under the blood of Christ all fear and condemnation has gone out then he will believe every word that gods write in the Bible to be truth he will not say it's not inspired and that's not inspired but he'll believe every word of it and punctuated with punctuate it with a Amen Beulah than I'm longing for you the message perseverant that was the next one the whole arm of God is supernatural and this one caught my attention the whole armour of God is supernatural what is the armor of God love I don't know that I'd ever read that or cut that before love what is love scientifically proved to me that there's such a thing as love where is it at you know how many loves raise your hand how many loves raise your hand okay loves your wife loves your brother loves your friends well I want somebody some science to prove to me what part of you is love how can we go in and have them remove love well they can do that they could remove hatred - then he says where do you buy it and what drugstore I want a bunch of it Lovejoy you got joy peace longsuffering gentleness patience what is it it's all supernatural God is supernatural you don't scientifically prove God you believe God you believe it if you don't believe it then a man says everything that is not scientifically his unorthodox not right then that man can never be a Christian - he says he has to believe by faith we believe God not by education not by theology but by faith you are saved when brother Brown says the whole armour of God is love that stopped me because when you get into the scriptures he's speaking of the armour the faith and all and I was speaking to brother Matt for a little while on on Monday we were sharing a couple of things I said you know you can dress yourself in the whole armor of God but if the love of God is not in there you will use your armor to beat up people you'll take the shield of faith and bash people in the head because they don't have the same faith you have but if you have that full armor of God with the love of God you'll be a soldier for Christ that's why he would say something like that it's base because God is love that's his old motive the rapture let's go to the last quote the rapture there but to the church the bride the rapture is a revelation to her it's an unveiling to her God makes it plain God makes it clear to you it's revealed to her that there that the revelation the true Bride of Christ will be waiting for the revelation of the rapture now it is a revelation for the revelation is faith you cannot have a revelation without it being faith faith is a revelation because it's something that's revealed to you faith is a revelation faith is something that had has been revealed to you like it was to Abraham that could call anything contrary to what had been revealed to him as though it wasn't so now faith that's what faith is is a revelation of God the church is built upon revival a revelation the whole entire body God making it and revealing it to you unveiling it and then therefore you can stand on it and know that it will you can state your eternal destination you can stake your health on it you can stake your whole being upon God revealing it to you making it real to you how many want Beulah then how many wall go home is it real to you is there a draw is there a call Beulah I'm longing for and someday [Music] handi house man [Music] they're my own shall be returned you sweet [Music] hope you ah [Music] and someday [Music] host and if you know you will be standing on it right now they're my [Music] god bless who sweet [Music] and look here [Music] the my face we'll just [Music] and I will take my hair you [Music] [Music] Sunmi um I'm staying [Music] they're my Shelly [Music] [Laughter] you sweet [Music] I'm kind of [Music] Oh which I am there [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I won't marry [Laughter] [Music] and meow [Applause] where my yeah [Music] Lord Jesus we just ask that you bless this night Lord bless our church here Lord bless those who listen in in tonight Lord watching almost dream Lord Jesus we just Lord will thank for Lord that you've been protecting this church Lord and that's what we're gonna keep believing Lord in these times Thank You Laura for faith Lord to believe in miracles to believe that we can be under Authority Lord and know that when you speak Lord it will be done thank you Lord for your word Lord all the things you don't know Jesus -
