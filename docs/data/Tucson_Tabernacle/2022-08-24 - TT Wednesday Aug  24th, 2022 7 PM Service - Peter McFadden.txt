to think about ourselves father for [Music] there's nothing good to think about there except for the part of ourselves that's you lord when we think about you father we're we're strengthened we're encouraged lord we're corrected your example that gave the lord in the life of jesus christ such a convicting example to us to really look the revival in your word and father we want to see you though that you'd open our eyes lord we could open this book and we could we could read in the natural but lord only you can open it in the spiritual only you can open your word to just let your spirit be here let it be pleased lord outside let your spirit rain down on us in here other quick runs away everything that's not of you father all unbelief all bitterness and envy and pride and lust lord any anything that's really in the kingdom of god lord hands in my lips are in great need of you every part of me lord is in great of you but lord said blessed are they longer and first after right thanks in jesus name amen i'm glad to be here let's let's turn while you're standing to jeremiah which come to worship in the lord's house all the words that i command thee to speak unto them diminish not a word if so be they will hearken and turn every man from his evil way that i may repent me of the evil which i purpose to do unto them because of the evil of the doing and let's go to matthew 4 and 4. this is jesus when the tempter is coming to him just like the tempter comes to every one of us this is jesus answering says in matthew chapter 4 verse 4 but he answered and said it is written and shall not live by alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god amen you may be seated and lord out of his blessings the reading of his word i believe that if we're to go home now and we were to go through the puddles and the rain and everything it would have been worth it for us to come because we've read this holy book and these words he said his words our spirit and their life i believe that's true and so in my great need that i see that my my own life is inadequate i need his life i need i see my own spirit inadequate i need his spirit and in this word is that spirit and that life that i i so need and i want to just come and give a theological lecture or something like that but i just want to share my heart with you that i'm hungry i want more god and i want i want to be closer to him than i've ever been i want to be more sensitive to his spirit than i've ever been and look at the way that our lord jesus did things he went and he he preached and great crowds came and they they loved his word right i said wow we've never heard a man speak like this this is great loved the word but they didn't love every word they just loved part of it and it's always been that way it's always that time of jeremiah god had to speak to these prophets speak all the words that i command don't diminish because some of these words are easy to love some of these words cut us like a knife but all through the bible there's many time after messages we can't live just part of it we can't just take the parts that are easy to deploy and everybody can enjoy um but we've got to take it as it is we've got to take it in its entirety and that's how it is spirit and life but if you try to chop it up and take this part of it without this other part of it you take the life out of it you kill it and and what you end up having is you end up having instead of this good news this world that will set you free that'll break the chains and give that spirit in life and let you live above sin and let you be born again and baptized in the spirit of god instead you just get something that's natural just the thoughts of of man once you change it once you take away from it it's like when they ask you to testify in court and they bring you up to come and give your witness they don't just say will you tell the truth because partial truth can be misleading and an innocent man can be hung on a partial truth a guilty man can get away on a partial truth so what they do they don't just say will you tell the truth because that in itself is not enough but what they say is will you tell the truth all truth and nothing but truth and that's what i want that's what i believe will bring the power of god if we'll stay with this word genesis revelation all the parts in between the parts that i don't understand it's many but i'll just say lord help me understand i have a desire for this word i have a desire to know you because to know him christ the word his life his word is spirit and life and i want to know that i want to know the one who wrote this book the one who hung the stars the one who made the rain and the wind and this book says that i can know him in the power of his resurrection i want that that's my heart's desire it says i can know him in the fellowship of his sufferings i want that too i want everything that's in here because i believe that we are living in a very a very important age very difficult age and i believe that the way that we live has a great effect and if you look at that really doesn't matter much to me except for those individual people have a value they have their presence and the sight of god and they're precious in our sight our friends and family that are not here but if you can i know you can use me so help me to get out of the way they wouldn't see me but they see you they heard it they had intellectual understanding of it and then they uh is that enough for them to go and change the world it wasn't enough see that they were with jesus for three and a half years they listened to the words they heard the miracles they were right there they slept with them they ate with him i mean what an experience opportunity that was you think well this was christ the person and i so i so appreciated what brother matthew watkins came in and speak to us about the balance that we need and talked on one side there's there's the jumping and shouting and then on the other side there's no in the bible he talked about we need everything we need every word and and there's so many ways that you can look at the bible and and so many ways that you can just take the part the side that you want you can take law or you can take grace and you can just major on that and leave the other side out and you could come and you could always just preach oh well god loves you peace peace well that wouldn't bring the spirit that wouldn't bring the life because that's not the word of god it's part of the word of god it's true but it's not the whole truth and on the same side you could come and you could preach law and you could preach holiness and you could preach repentance and and boy you could just really kill everybody with that sword it is true but it is not the whole truth so let us just come and if we'll really surrender to that if we'll really just get serious about seeking him as he is i believe the lord will do great things in our i believe if we can really get in one mind in one accord if there will be a fire that same fire that same holy ghost you know i was talking to to abel my son about fire and fire is one of these great mysteries in life it's it's one of the the most supernatural natural things you can see it's it's it's amazing but if you look at the requirements for fire it's really simple you just need wood something to burn some fuel doesn't have to be wood but some fuel you need oxygen and you need heat and it's going to burn most everything that you see in this world it's it's just you know it's under this air that's everywhere just like the spirit of god is everywhere where could i go from your presence where could i hide from it nowhere just like the air that's all around us and each one of us potentially we're on fire for god pretend we're we're fuel maybe we just need some heat maybe we just need to to draw close to that that spark of life that same same word that that one word went and created heavens and earth one word brought light if we can just really get on fire and then if we can keep from being so scattered keep from being so far from one another but if we can really love one another until we're just really close we want to know christ the word we want to know every part of it well his word says that if we say we love god and we hate our brother we're a liar the truth's not even in us so if you say well i finally got it all i'm gonna go up on my mountain and retire just me and god alone because i've really got it now maybe you missed it because i believe that if you really got what these men in the bible had what these disciples had you wouldn't be up on the mountain alone but you go find your brother and your sister and you go light them on fire not with anything of of your own self but just with that part of your life you surrender to the holy ghost because his power is the same jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and some of you all got to see that some of you all have seen miracles we've all heard of them but how much do we believe them how much are we hungering for that how much are we willing to say lord whatever parts of your word that i've discarded that i've diminished as it says in jeremiah that i've just taken and decreased the font size a little bit so i can read over it quicker if we just say lord i don't want to do that i just want to take every word i want to take the whole truth and i just want to know you bring that same life and that same power that same manifested life of god but if we'll just stay true to this where it hurts where it kills us where it where it just cuts us to pieces i believe we'll see that same original life it says in the book of hosea i really like this hosea chapter 6 and verse 1 we'll just read through here the first three three verses of hosea we've heard of the the former rain and the latter rain these these movements of the holy spirit how many want to be part of that how many want to just be in that great rain that that reviving washing cleansing rain but but look look at the lead-up to this rain there's pain before the rain it says hosea six and one if we can put it put it up and we'll read down to verse three it starts with a sermon in one word and i believe if we would just really obey this this one word with all our heart we'd get to that reign you know what this word is let's let's put this up hosea 6 and 1. the word has come hosea before we can do anything else let's just get where he is before we worry about our theology and and everybody else and even our sins let's just get in his presence i believe that if we just took that one word we could have a real good service with that if we just said oh god if that's in your word i want to do that i want to come to you i want to be where you are i was preached a sermon the other day by my dog said that's quite a dog that can preach yeah god speaks that way he speaks through donkeys and chickens this dog is a real friend to my kids but i'm like the disciplinarian and samia and this dog we're not even the best friends i'm kind of the mean guy but something in this dog he knows that i'm i'm kind of the the leader of his pack and he just wants to be where i am and we're outside and he's eating i'd gone outside he just came to eat and then as soon as he starts eating i leave to go inside he forgot the food and he just came and followed me he just wanted more than anything in this life just to be right where i was i thought i'm not even nice to this dog and he just wants to be in the same room with me more than anything in this world this is just a dog i don't even think he's a christian really but he uh he has that desire and i thought i'm supposed to be so in love with jesus christ that we're getting married that i'm part of his bride and i got convicted because this dog just wants to be where i am i thought am i that way with the presence of god that all i want to do is be where he is and as soon as his spirit leaves the room i say i don't care there's food here i'm out of here i'm gonna get where he is what if we live like that what if that was our primary concern it's just to be where his spirit is just to come and reason together and let him take away the sins of this world take this sin that was a scarlet and make it white as snow but the devil's whole plan is just to keep you away from that to distract you away from that to get you to sell your birthright for a little bit of porridge we read that in the bible and we say oh esau how could you do that how could you sell your birthright so cheap for a little bit of stew a little bit of porridge whatever it was isn't our birthright greater than esau's esau's birthright was some blessings some some little blessings our birthright is the holy ghost to have communion with the lord of lords and the king of kings the the creator of heaven earth that we could talk to him and have him talk to us we could say lord i have these sins in my life would you cleanse me would you change me lord i don't care about you and i don't care about people like i should lord give me your love my love is not enough lord my joy is not enough i need your joy my peace is not enough i need your peace that's your birthright to go and kneel where he is and know that he's not looking down at you in wrath but he's looking down in love he's not seeing you as the wretch that he should see you of as but he sees you through the blood as spotless as perfect look at how much greater our inheritance our birthright is an esau and look how cheap we sell it spend time joking looking at the news looking at the internet thinking about how to get rich hating one another being jealous you're trading that for that we do i do but there's a desire in me to be where he is there's a part of me that says i've got to throw aside these weights that i picked up that are dragging me down away from him i've got to tear away not in my own strength but by his strength these carers of this life that have choked this life out of me this life that should be shining such a light to my loved ones that's just being choked up i don't want to sell my birthright that cheap but i just want to be where he is come and let us return unto the lord for he hath torn oh don't talk about that part of the gospel sometimes god has to break us sometimes he has to tear us sometimes we have to go through years of pain before we can get to the place that he can pour his blessings on us but he loves us too much to leave us the way that we were to leave us in our sins to leave us in despair and hopelessness so he tears that away from us though it's grown in so close that it tears me apart to tear it out he knows what he's doing by the word that sharp two-edged sword that's quick and alive he knows what he's doing and though he cuts away everything that's not of him it won't hurt that seed of god that he's placed down inside he knows how to operate that he can tear but he will heal us he has smitten and he will bind us up if you want to be healed and bandaged you've got to get where he can operate on you with this word this is the only way that he can tear and smite away the sin from our life the things that we really need free of the things that are keeping our loved ones from seeing jesus christ but if we'll come if we'll return to the lord everywhere in our lives that we've gotten far away everywhere that we've lost our first love and our hearts have grown cold say lord i want to come back just like samson there his eyes gone out i said oh once more lord maybe years ago we were filled with the holy ghost and we were alive and we're rejoicing maybe we're far from that but if god's still calling you come return to me there's a way back today if you can hear his voice harden not your heart say oh god i want to come into your presence want to take every word though it tears me so it shows the things that i've let to bind me the prison of my own making and allowing though it sheds light on that oh dr jesus come and operate but see he doesn't chase us down and beat us over the head and operate in some alley he's a gentleman he's waiting for us to come he's waiting for us to want to be healed he's waiting for us to want to be with him he's not going to make you love him if you want to live your whole life and and just love him a little bit that's your that's your free will your choice but oh i want to love him i don't want to love him just with my own failing feeble love but i want to come to him that he can heal me and give me his love that i could love unconditionally that i could love everybody that i could just draw other people close that we could light on fire together that we could glorify his name see god doesn't really delight in all the hours of our singing i just came to glorify glorify his name he doesn't delight in that as much as he delights in one sinner that comes to repentance and i'm not saying one of you sinners i'm saying i need to repent i need healing i've been looking through this bible and i'm lacking i'm not living like these that we're really surrendered or we're living but i believe he's the same and i believe he's calling in a full answer that we'll see the same i believe we could live in such a way we say you know i was walking over to church and you know how god is my shadow fell on somebody and they were healed because that's just how our god is that's still how he is but we just say oh i'm that that's a little hard let me let me just keep with the part of the gospel that makes me feel good let me just get in his presence a couple times a year get right before communion and that's enough for me i'm busy got things to do places to be but i want to live in his sight he says after two days will he revive us in the third day he will raise us up and we shall live in his sight verse three says it's hosea 6 and 3 after this it says then shall we know after this after we come after we're torn and healed it says then shall we know if we follow on to know the lord his going forth is prepared as the morning and he shall come unto us as the rain as the latter and former rain upon the earth that rain is going to come are you going to be ready for it where is it going to pass you by fall on somebody else i don't want to pass me by if god's getting somebody to the place that they love him with all their heart why not me why can't i just come god's no respecter of persons what he did for them back then he'll do the same for you god doesn't honor any man's person he honors faith how do we get that faith by going climbing a mountain or beating our chest or good music faith comes by here hearing the word of god so lord anoint our ears give us ears to hear and eyes to see see here's the thing about this it's easy to take and say well it's about every word and it's all about these these preachers that diminished part of the word and you know if i could just get a good church boy i could really be a good christian but the ministry here you know not not so good and so they're leaving stuff out and so it's their fault some other life maybe i could be a good christian verse 1 doesn't say come and come to your pastor but let him bring you to me it just says come if we'll just seek the lord it's an individual thing and god knows what we have need of and here's the thing if we'll really come hungry say lord feed me from your throne today this bible says he doesn't give the child that asks for a fish a stone or the child that asks for bread a serpent so if you really come hungry god will find a way to feed you and there were there are people that listen listen to brother branham every day but they don't hear the whole word they don't hear every word you can have the best preacher in the world you can have the best church in the world but if you're not hungry if you're not coming to the lord and saying lord would you operate on me that word is not going to be effective in your life because you're not receiving every word we don't receive this just intellectually it's not just in our saying okay well i've got to get a really good understanding on the law and i've got to get a really good understanding on grace and then then i'll have the whole word and then i can manifest but it's god coming and revealing it in simplicity that he can give you the faith to believe it and give you the heart to receive it and and where you don't know how to apply it he can give you the wisdom on how to apply it he does use other other people he does use the ministry he does use your brothers your sisters to to shine this light in such a way that we can receive it aren't you glad that we're not in this alone we don't just have to go and and get all weird by ourselves but we can be with god's people and we can say i know that's right something in me says that's god moving in my brother my sister's life that's an encouragement to me because i know they're human like i'm human if god will draw them and change them god will do the same for me if i'll just come and receive it see jesus said to peter blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it to me but my father which is in heaven we're never going to get there by by our intellect by our our own doings but it's by his grace if we just come to him stay with him just like that dog just wants to be where i am but are we hungry this is the day that we've waited for that the men of old had longed to see this is the day of christ's return our bible tells us he stands at the door and knocks if any man opens here's my voice opens the door i will come in that's a promise we'll sup with him it says if any man and i believe that applies to our sisters too but if we have we stopped hearing him knock are we listening to other things our minds on other things or our hearts on our other things where your treasure is that's where your heart's going to be and all this is going to burn where is my treasure what do i think about you know i was thinking you think of getting over there to heaven people come well i was i was one of those that gave my life as a martyr back back in the coliseum it's good to meet you oh you you were from the very end you were from that final day what was that like how did you how did you overcome in that day oh well i went to church when it was open and prayed 10 minutes a day worked pretty hard at my job people in the community thought i was pretty good and so you know just that's what i did wasn't too hard we deceive ourselves we take part of the word but there's going to be someone there maybe some little sister that just says well i didn't do anything really i just love the lord jesus i just stayed where he was and his grace brought me through it's serious times we have an enemy that has been doing this for a long time and is very good at getting us to to leave out part of the word to kill the life but we have a god that's greater we have a god of restoration we have a god that knew you before the foundation of the world and said to as many as received him this in its entirety the truth the whole truth nothing but the truth as many as received that he gave power to be the sons of god to be just like jesus christ i believe if we'll really seek that with all our heart to know him to know this word that's spirit and life i believe we're coming to the point where our lives are gonna be so so like his that people aren't gonna see the difference they're not gonna see us anymore they're just gonna see jesus christ i believe that with all my heart that we're coming to that time that time that's going to show that that corn of wheat that fell on the ground and died did it for a reason to bring forth much fruit see when we talk about knowing this this word talk about knowing christ we're not talking about just knowing knowledge that you can know the law side or you can know the grace side we're talking about knowing a person the person of jesus christ to know him as life we can put up this is this is what i've really been convicted by this this next scripture is john 15 4 and 5. but these scriptures that are there to convict us they're there to heal us that they're to bring us to the place that we're meant to be this is jesus word it says abide in me and i in you i believe we could we could just take that for the next six months and if we'd really take it with all our heart i believe we'd see a revival if we just say oh god let me abide in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye except you abide in me i am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and i in him the same bringeth forth much fruit that's a promise if you will come let his word operate on you if you'll abide in him your life will bring forth through say oh but i'm nothing i've i've messed everything up i'm too far gone nobody even cares about me those are lies the king of heaven cares about you he's looking at you with love he's saying son daughter come on up come on back to where you left me and if you'll just abide in him look what else is there says he that abides in me and is pretty smart and has things figured out it just says abides in me don't you love how simple that is any one of us can do that it just comes down to our desire is that the first desire in our life or is it not you can't do it if it's your second desire if you care about food more than that you'll abide in him until the food comes out then you'll be gone if you care about friends more than that you'll abide in him until the friends come out they're gonna be gone in the old testament there's joshua and caleb that they just stayed in that tabernacle continually they were the minority but it says oh they they just stayed there our example christ jesus he was god in flesh say he didn't really need anything right but where was he in his free time he was praying he was caring for people he was always about the father's business he is our example the devil will try to tell you no just live a kind of halfway christian life and you know come to church it's fine we're not called to that we're called to be like jesus he said the they that believe he that believes on me the
