praise of them that do well for so is the will of God that with well-doing you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men as free and not using your Liberty for a cloak of maliciousness but as Servants of God honor all men love the Brotherhood fear God and honor the king let's bow our heads Lord may you add the blessings to the reading of that word father May your anointing be present tonight as I talk about your servants and father may we receive something that will give us Direction each life that's here father May each one of us receive a direction from you on the path that lays before us we ask in Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you all you can take your seats brother Austin I'm sorry for calling you Amos this morning oh yeah yeah Daniel told me he's like Dad you called Austin Amos sorry you know like the peanut gallery you know everybody's I'm thinking about I got that wrong God bless you my friend it's it was good to meet you it's it's an honor um I was talking about talking this morning about this book of Chronicles and how we have first and second Samuel we're first and second Kings they were all four written together by the same author and we have first and second chronicles written by a different author but both talk about the same period of time and they talk about the same people as I said before just different perspectives as we read through those two books I'm reading reading in second chronicles today and um to give a little background as I went over this morning we have Jehoshaphat was a righteous King in Judah as I said this morning that after Solomon came the kingdom split into two we have Judah and we have Israel there was never a good King after Solomon in Israel but there were some good kings that came through in the line of Judah went down to where we have Ahab the king of Israel and we have Jehoshaphat the king of Judah and we know the story I didn't talk about it this morning but we know the story about when Michaela the prophet gave the prophecy about um when zedekiah and a lie or zedekiah and Ahab wanted to go to battle and um the prophet McKay gave the prophecy that you won't even return from this battle that was that was this time and Jehoshaphat he was the king over in Judah at that time so then after Jehoshaphat his son joram took the throne to horm was a evil man he married the wrong girl married Ahab and Jezebel's daughter and um he brought in sin into Judah and the Lord condemned him for doing that he he condemned them with the Prophet Elijah when he wrote a letter to johoram and he he said that that sickness is going to come in it's going to spread through the country and you are going to get sick and you are going to die because of the whoredoms that you've brought in to this country and the idols that you've set before the people so then we see that he died and he and his wife athaliah who was the daughter of Ahab and Jezebel they had a number of sons most of which died one of those sons was a hazia and a hazia he he took the throne and and he was counseled by his evil mother and then eventually a hazia is killed by this man named jehu and once a hazia is killed then athaliah she took the throne and she was as we know a very very evil person and let's let's turn to Second Chronicles and we'll get right back into the word um 22 and we'll start with verse 10. but when athaliah the mother of ahasia saw that her son was dead she arose and destroyed all the seed Royal of the house of Judah again she took the opportunity to take this Kingdom for herself and she killed all the Royal Blood so that there was no heirs if she would not have any competition but g g hashibath the daughter of the king took joash the son of ahasia and stole him from the king's sons that were slain and put him in his and his nurse in a bed chamber so Jehoshaphat the daughter of King johoram the wife of jehoiada the priest for she was a sister of ahasia hid him from athaliah so that she slew him not so this lady Jehoshaphat protected the baby who was the royal seed from athaliah who was purging anyone that could possibly take the throne from her and again we see that Spirit attacking anyone that is a threat when people when many people get into power and he was with them hid in the house of God six years and at the LIE reigned over the land now when joshabeth saved this baby she wasn't thinking of herself because as I said this morning she had a fairly prominent husband in Judah and life probably wasn't so bad but it wasn't to her it wasn't about the quality of life it was about doing the right thing and uh you know I think about today and how we're often faced with things that lay before us and we say are we going to do the right thing and going to rather going to school going to work whatever it might be we're always faced with we're always faced with a choice and that choice we can either take the easy way or we can take the more difficult Road and most of the time that is the right way to do things if we turn in Revelation brother I'm sorry I didn't give you this this scripture but if we turn to Revelation chapter 3 I want to talk about briefly what we see in this age verse number 14 and we're very familiar with this this we know as the laodicean church age and this is the last Church age that we have in history we have we have about 4 000 years of Jewish history that comes through then it comes to Malachi Malachi prophesies that there is going to come a a man that that turns the hearts of the fathers to the children that man came and and make the the Crooked ways straight and that man came in the in the form of John the Baptist then we see this man the Lord Jesus raise up God in flesh introduced by the prophet and he came and redeemed the whole world and then we see after he ascended up on high and after the day of Pentecost and the people went out and they started spreading this gospel that the Messiah had come then we see this time start ticking on the Gentile time there was no Gentile ages before then we see right after Jesus we see Paul and he's going to these different Gentile churches and the gospel is spreading we see the at the very beginning the Ephesian age all the way down through for 2 000 years and then it comes to this last age which is this laodicean age verse 14 it says this and until unto the angel of the Church of the laodiceans right these things say it's the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God I know that works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would that thou were cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because thou saith I am rich and increased in goods and have need of nothing and know us not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked imagine if Jehoshaphat would have said would have had the same spirit that we see here in this layout to see an age things are good I don't really need anything you know I've got air conditioning I've got a good job everything everything's going fine you know my husband she you know he's he's in a prominent place in the church and you know my kids are good everything everything's good I don't really have need to really get on my knees and pray I don't really have need to make a stand why would I make a stand I don't have to she didn't have to make this stand she didn't have to take put her life in danger but she did and she helped this baby this joash this King this baby king that was being purged she grabbed this baby took it home with the baby's nurse took it home and protected it at her own peril and it says this Verse 18 I counsel thee to buy of me gold try it in the fire that thou mayest be rich in white arraignment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with isav that thou mayest see now listen to this in this laodicean age as many as I love I rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent this is the only age that he says to be zealous because this age has no zeal this age is lazy it's sitting back it's not doing anything you know we're instead of studying our Bibles we're texting each other we're playing on the phones and instead of coming to church we're doing other things we we're busy with work we are not thinking about God enough and right here it says be zealous Jesus is crying out be zealous don't don't forget me you know he says I stand at the door and knock the only only one that he he won't even be let in is because we're too busy with our other things you know I was thinking brother Jeremy set me up a text just now and it really brother Jeremy that was great you mind if I read it I'm going to read it anyways can I get your approval good he sent me a scripture brother Jeremy says this brother Jeremy said let's bring all of those who have left back to church amen and then brother Jeremy gave me a scripture listen to this scripture Isaiah 58 12. and they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places and they and they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places Thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations and thou shalt be called the repairer of the breach the restorer of the paths to dwell in amen let's go out and get those that have left let's go out and encourage those that are down and let's get them back in and say come back in here this place loves you this place has zeal this place believes on Jesus Christ and the power that he has and to do that brother Jeremy we can't just talk about it to do it we can't sit back like the laodiceans and said I'm fine let somebody else do it we have to make the move to do something it's up to us not just one or two people all of us and all of us know people that need it all of us know people that that are hurting that's our job to reach out to them to do something don't just sit back I was and I tell one on myself I was um at the gym I don't know a couple weeks ago and I was I um I get on the treadmill and I usually take I usually take calls and and um and I'm going and and there's a window there and I think I was listening to a tape as I was as I was on there and I'm going and I see and it's in in the Fry's parking lot at Thornydale and tangerine and I see this big tractor trailer it drives in through the parking lot tight and I'm I'm going I'm like wow what's he doing and he drives he drives past the big window there and I'm thinking don't hit my car don't my car and he and he didn't and he stops and then he backs his tractor trailer up and he wants to turn around in this little parking lot and I'm like what what's this guy doing so he he's in the parking lot and he starts to back up and he cranks it around and he he goes and there's a curb there and then there's a big Palo Verde tree giant Palo Verde tree and he just and he's backing up and he he pulls a tractor-trailer around and it's going next to this Palo Verde tree and he just barely scrapes it on on the side of his of his big uh trailer there and he keeps going back and he's trying to turn around and I'm watching them I'm like this guy what is he thinking and I'm going like what what is going on so he pulls around and he he pulls back and he kind of straightens out and he's got about I don't know for me to meet her brother Aaron to pull this big tractor trailer out and he hits the tree a little bit and then he starts wiggling back and forth and I'm watching this thing and then the other old men he's he goes up next to me goes look at this guy I'm like yeah look at this guy and he's going back and forth and he's getting closer and closer to that Palo Verde tree and I see the pilot fruity Street start to move and then and then the people that work in the gym there they come over and we're all looking out this window like this guy's he's nuts back and forth wiggling back and forth getting closer to the tree closer to the tree and I'm like he's gonna knock the tree down he's going to turn a big hole in the side of that trailer back and forth Closer Closer I see I see the tree moving I see the limb sticking out I see the limb break I see a big gash cut through the side of his trailer and he's still wiggling and he starts he just says okay and he just and then he just pulls out and it just goes over the curb knocks the tree all the way over boom you're talking about a peanut gallery and there were there's this guy what is he thinking so he he pulls out hops the curb drives up to Fry's backs in and unloads his gear unloads his cargo so a few of the people from the store came out said he's got to be on drugs he's got to be high he's got to be something they walk up to him and he's shaking and he's a young man and they're like what happened he says I didn't know how he says I just got my license I just got my CDL and he says he says I knocked down that tree and he and he was ready to cry the young man and you know they're standing there and they're like well it's okay you know a big tree is falling down thank goodness didn't land on a car and and I I thought to myself Lord what's the matter with me I sat there and watched this thing unfold for probably 10 minutes making fun of the poor guy and I'm responsible I could have gone out there and said hey brother You're Gonna Knock the tree down pull over this way I could have helped him I could have done something I could have probably saved the poor guy's license it ripped a whole hole in the side of his trailer ah it's like Lord I'm sorry I didn't do something I could have why did I not instead I was just laughing at him and what kind of a Christian is that what kind of a man am I and not doing something oh I felt terrible for that Never Gonna I'm I wanna I always want to do something I look at this man jehoiada and his wife and they see that this child is going to be killed they could have done like I did just stand back and watch the tree fall down but no they did something they risked their lives all I would have had to do is stop my workout my meaningless workout it's not working that good brother Bobby okay I could have stopped I could have walked outside and helped the guy but I didn't and how many of us are in that position how many of us are in that position daily that we can reach out to someone have you ever regretted doing something for someone have you ever regretted reaching out you know no but I have regretted not doing it that poor kid that's my fault that he knocked that tree down and I I read the story about Jehoshaphat and his wife Jehovah I'm sorry jehoiada and his wife and I think there for the Lao is an example there's an example for all of us that we can that this man and this woman put their lives in danger they got this kid they hit him for I don't know what was it six or seven years every day probably worried that this evil woman athalia that her henchmen were going to come knocking at the door give us the baby and I want to cut your heads off too but they did it they did something now today we're not faced here in the United States with death if we don't reach out if we don't do something we're living laodicea the the stakes are much lower for us but think about the people that we could help they're a lot higher you know I was talking this morning about the guy Daniel at the um at the ball game the old man he was so happy man he's like everybody's here you know he's just I remember you I remember your grandpa you know with Rod had the had the season tickets he's just talking he just he just loved having Daniel there and he would love the game because the team won everything was just so good but brother what about your soul have we reached out have I have I reached out to as many people as I can you know Jeremy the the text that you sent me how important it is is that we can reach out and restore these people that are lost and these are our family members these are our friends these are people that need it not to build the church the church isn't going to amount any it's a building but this body needs us Jesus God chose men and women he didn't choose as brother Brown said he didn't choose a machine that preach his gospel he chose men and women to reach out to those that need it and that's what we have to do I never ever want to be guilty of watching a man like that tear down a tree ruin his career Maybe Lord let me never be guilty again I learned my lesson and I hope that you see my faults and my mistakes and that you don't make the same one so here we have this joita and his wife and all of their days all of the days that this priest lived God blessed Judah because he was willing to do something let's read a little bit about what he did second chronicles 23. and in the seventh year jehoiada strengthened himself I love that I don't know exactly what it means but I like the wording on that is probably he got on his knees and said Lord give me strength because we're about to do something big Lord guide us Lord protect us and he took the captains of hundreds Azariah the son of johoram and Ishmael the son of johannan and Azariah the son of Obed and Messiah the Son of iodide and the last effect the son of zikri into the Covenant with him I wonder how much time he spent in prayer and we look at these men that he went to what were they thinking here is this man jehoiada this priest and we're about to take over the entire country we're about to attack probably the biggest witch in the world in atalia we're going to go after them us and joette is like yep we're gonna do it so these people had to make a decision what are they going to do and they went about in Judah and gathered the Levites out of the cities of Judah and the chief of the fathers of Israel and they came to Jerusalem and all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of God and he said unto them Behold The King's son shall reign as the Lord has said of the sons of David and johada tells us he jehota tells the Levites he said surround he said arm yourselves surround this this young man this King because we're going to bring him in and we are going to anoint him and Crown Him King protect this boy he was precious so they all followed this jehoia is leading and I wonder why at the light had the power she was the queen she was the boss why did they follow this man jehoiada you know why they followed him I think it doesn't say why but I think he had their respect they may have seen this man's dedication to the Lord they may have seen how much this man prayed they may have seen how much Judah meant to this man and these Warriors and these Levites they made the decision put their own lives at risk we're going to go with this priest and not with the one that's ruling this country let's skip down to verse 8. so the Levites and all Judah did according to all the things that jehoiah the priest had commanded and took every man his men that were come in on the Sabbath with them that were to go out on the Sabbath for jehoiah the priests dismissed not the courses moreover they still had Church even this time brother Wilson we're not going to skip church no we're going to continue on moreover Jehovah the priest delivered to the captains of hundred Spears and bucklers and shields that had been in been King David's which were in the house of God and he said all the people every man having his weapon in his hand from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple Along by The Altar and by the temple by the king roundabout and they brought out the King's son and put him and put upon him the crowd and gave him the testimony and made him King and jehoiah and his sons anointed him and said God Save the King now somehow they kept this from athaliah and again I see this man jehoiada he must have had such a testimony with the people with them all to risk their lives like this and they had to ask themselves who are we going to trust I look thousands of years or however long was 1500 years later or whatever it was when the when the Book of Revelation was written and I think about that laodicean age I think how few jehoias we have today and how few of us that are willing to lay down our lives willing to draw our swords and go forward saying Lord I'm going to be a warrior I'm going to learn this book Whenever there is something Whenever there is a battle to fight I'm going to be so one with this book I'm going to know how to fight it now when athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king she came to the people into the house of the Lord she was expecting probably something a little different than what she received and she looked and behold the king stood at his pillar at the entering Inn and the princes and the trumpets by the king and all the people of the land rejoiced and sounded with trumpets also the singers with instruments of music and such as taught to sing praise then at the Laya rent her clothes and said treason treason I'm the boss how dare you now look who was the real boss then jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds that were set over the host and said unto them have her forth of the ranges and whosoever followeth her let him be slain with the sword for the priest said slay you're not in the house of the Lord this evil woman not only met her end that day but she brought down everyone that followed her so friends be careful Who Your Friends Are be careful who you are following okay two more verses and then we're gonna see who we really follow so they laid hands on her and when she was come to the entering of the horse gate by the King's house they slew her there now listen to this and jehoiada made a covenant between him and between all the people and between the king that they should be the Lord's people that's who jehoiada wanted these people to be loyal to when you see that word Lord there you'll notice in your King James Bible it's written different than all the other words it has a capital l and then small caps o r d it's called the tetragrammatin am I right brother Lyle that is referring to Jehovah God that is referring to the I am that spoke to Moses that is referring to the Eternal Father not a king not a ruler but God himself is who that is referring to their loyalty in Jehovah or jehoiada was a great leader he said you'd be loyal to God then all the people now watch what this produces sure that they took courage too then all the people went into the house of Baal and break it down and break his altars and his images and pieces and slew Matan the priest of Baal before the altar with the right influence they got rid of that sinful living that johoram had introduced the garbage that johoram and ahasia and athalia the immorality the the idolatry all of that stuff all of a sudden you have you start surrendering to God the real Jehovah then it starts to leave and we see here it starts to go they started with the idolatry Let's uh let me read let me just finish it also jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the Lord by the hand of the priests the Levites whom David had distributed in the house of the Lord to offer burnt offerings of the Lord as as it is written in the law of Moses with rejoicing and with singing as it was ordained by David they were happy to go to church they were excited and he set the porters at the gates of the house of the Lord that none which was unclean in anything should enter in and he took the captains of hundreds and the Nobles and the governors of the people and all the people of the land and brought down the king from the house of the Lord and they came through the high gate into the King's house and set the king upon the throne of the Kingdom and all the people of the land rejoiced and the city was quiet after that they had slain athalia with the sword let's go to uh chapter 24. let's just keep on moving joash was seven years old when he began to reign and he reigned 40 years in Jerusalem and his mother's name also was zibia of Beersheba and Joe Ash now this is a very key scripture right here you know it just blessed me this morning when when I walked out and I was introducing one of my favorite people in the Bible which is this jehoida and I talked to brother Lyle and brother Lyle said they named their son that name I thought I was the only one that knew knew about this guy now what did you say you had a you had a king Samuel a prophet second was Josiah the king third one was I'm going to say it in English jehoida and the priest amen you know and so talking with him it just it did my heart good this brother's testimony has always been encouraging to me and it did me good with a while it really encouraged my heart I was telling I was telling Stephanie and Daniel about this as we were coming home like wow somebody so much that you named your son that that about after this dear person very important scripture here 24 2. and joash did that which was right in the sight of the Lord all the days of jehoiada the priest now notice the influence of jehoiada on joash he did that which was right because he had a good example let's go to verse 6. and the king called for jehoiada the chief and said unto him now the king gets a little older here and uh he gets married and and um remember he's being mentored by this man and he sees the church and he says hey we got to do something about this we gotta we gotta rebuild this and the king called for jehoiah the chief and said unto him why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem The Collection according to the Commandment of Moses the servant of the Lord and for the congregation of Israel for the Tabernacle of witness for the sons of athaliah that Wicked Woman had broken up the house of God and also all the dedicated things of the house of the Lord did they bestow upon Balaam and at the king's commandment they made a chest I like this part because I can see it back there and at the king's commandment they made a chest and said it without the gate of the house of the Lord and they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem to bring into the Lord The Collection that Moses the servant of God had laid upon Israel in the wilderness and the princes and all the people rejoiced and brought in and cast into the chest until they had made an end and it came to pass that at what time the chest was brought unto the king's office by the hands of the Levi by the hand of the Levites and when they saw that there was much money the king's scribe and high priest officers came and emptied the chest and took it and carried it to his place again thus they did day by day and gathered the money in abundance the people were excited you know they they wanted they had this zeal that's talked about that lacks in the layout of cnh they had this Zeal to do something now it may be it may not be a monetary donation but all of us have a part to play so then we when it was all put together then they hired these contractors to come in if you look at Kings and I'm gonna I'll dig on Jehovah just a little bit in in Kings jehoiah he had kind of had the priests you know they were going to do the fixing in the building it just didn't work and and finally the king's like hey do this right jehoida so then jehoiah hires contractors hires the experts and then they rebuilt the church Let's uh let's keep going let's go to verse 14. and when they had finished it they brought the rest of the money before the king and jehoiada whereof were made Vessels for the house of the Lord even the vessels to minister and to offer with all and spoons and vessels of gold and silver and they offered burnt offerings in the house of the Lord continually all the days of jehoiada wow but Jehovah waxed old and was full of days when he died 130 years old was he when he died and they buried him in the city of David among the Kings because he had done good in Israel both toward God and toward his house now after the death of jehoiada came the princes of Judah and they made obedience to the king they paid homage to the king then the king hearkened unto them now look what happens when the king lost the influence of this great man they left the house of the Lord God of their fathers and served the Groves and idols and wrath Came Upon Judah and Jerusalem for this trespass yet he sent prophets to them to bring them again unto the Lord and they testified against them but they would not give ear and the spirit of God Came Upon Zechariah the son of jehoiah the priest which stood above the people and said unto them thus saith God why transgressity the Commandments of the Lord that ye cannot prosper stop right there for a minute you transgressed the Commandments of God you sin you bring an idolatry and he says right here that you can't Prosper because of that you know I I think about God wants us to be successful I'm not talking monetarily God wants us to be successful he set Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden and he built this beautiful place and he was you know the Lord must have just been happy here are my two children and I just love them so much and I placed them in the nicest place on Earth I gave them everything that they could have need of and I even warned them but watch for this Danger you see this tree stay away from it and what's the first thing that they do what tree like our kids God wants us to succeed he wants us to be he wants us to be happy in life he wants us to have families he wants us to be to have enough money to to live our lives and not to struggle at any time but then we go and we mess it up do you ever see a successful drug user no why do it it's only going to hurt you why run with the wrong boy or the wrong girl it's just going to hurt you don't do it and we've warn our children God warns us and yet we do it and it says here the son of jehoiada he says you're not going to prosper sinning where was I at verse verse 20 verse 20 because you have forsaken the Lord he hath also forsaken you who made the first move because you have forsaken the Lord because I have sinned the Lord's also forsaken us and they conspired against him and stoned him with stones but they didn't like hearing this preacher talked the way he was talking and they conspired against him and stoned him with stones at the Commandment of the king and the corn of the court of the house of the Lord thus joashed the king remembered not the kindness which jehoi to his father had done to him but slew his son and when he died he said the Lord look upon it and require it this son of jehoiada he cried out for Revenge a little foreign to us but he did he cried out for Revenge and I think that probably many of us right now are thinking of a man that had the Holy Ghost and was being stoned Stephen and he cried out for mercy but this is the Old Testament we're talking about right now and it came to pass at the end of the year that the host of Syria came up against him and they came to Judah and Jerusalem and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people and sent all the spoil of them under the king of Damascus he's losing everything for the army of the syrians came with a small company of men and the Lord delivered a very great host into their hand because they had forsaken the Lord God of their fathers so they executed judgment against joash and when they were departed from him for they left him in great diseases his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of jehoiada the priest and slew him on his bed and he died and they buried him in the city of David but they buried him not in the supplicers of the king but jehoiada not being a king he got buried right there with the Kings notice joash returned to the sins of the world after the Lord took jehoiada it was a very very sad story and you know we look at the influence that jehoiada and his wife had on Judah and how this place just prospered probably for decades how good life was that this man of God was there and pointing people in the right direction and living this life and today it doesn't have to be Pastor in the pulpit it doesn't have to be a great priest or it doesn't have to be a great leader it can be a little Widow sister it can be somebody that nobody even thinks about and yet this person has that same calling in their lives to seek God as jehoiada and his wife and praying and asking the Lord and doing everything that they can and then it's like it's like a calm pond on a calm day and taking a rock throwing it out there and it makes the Splash and then the ripples they start to go and it could be sister Shirley could start anywhere they could start right there and those ripples they spread throughout the congregation and then that congregation spreads throughout the city and then that City spreads throughout the country and then that country spreads throughout the world and we leave this place finally it's never friends it could be anybody it could be playing your instrument it could be whatever gift God has given it could be a song whatever gift God has given us use that gift for his glory use that gift like jehoiah did use it for the people and have an influence and never something changed years hundreds of years after jehoiada left something changed this man God himself came down in flesh gave his life on the cross ascended up on high and then sent his Spirit down into 120 in the upper room I know I talk about it a lot I'm going to preach about it I think every sermon I ever preached is talk about the Holy Spirit it is the most important thing in the world and here it comes down into these people and then they go out and it's no more like jehoiada's son avenge them now it's Lord have mercy on them and we see it's starting to spread and that love comes in and then it's never it is never he's gone too far I'm sick of him or she's gone too far I'm sick of her that may be somebody's child they may be somebody's daughter that may be somebody's son and continue to pray for those people brother Jeremy that text that you sent me those ones that have gone out bring them back it doesn't have to be this church as Jordan said dedicate them to the Lord bring them to Christ and it is never impossible I don't care what they have done I don't care how far that they have sinned it doesn't matter Jesus Christ is more than able let us just do our jobs let us just present it present it in love not correction not you're doing wrong and this and this and this love and then we may see something happened like happened with this brother jehoiah amen the Holy Spirit operating we have much more ability today than jehoiah the priesthood because we are filled with that same Spirit of Christ amen if the musicians who you come we have that opportunity let me read again our opening scripture First Peter chapter 2 verse 11. wonderful I love the word you know I love I love what these stories in the Old Testament and I love how everything changed it all changed when Jesus came you know before we had all we had we had all this time of no evangelism is all fear it was all law and then Christ came oh Lord I can just fall down whatever sin I've committed Lord I can just come and if there is a desire in my heart to be forgiven that's what this cross here's for and don't forget it's about friends it's about family sons and daughters and mothers and fathers and brothers and sisters and friends they have not sinned so far never right anyone off we are we together brother Wilson would you come in closing second First Peter chapter 2. verse 11 dearly beloved I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul having your conversation honest among the Gentiles that were as they speak against you as evildoers they may buy your good work they may by your good words Works which they Shall Behold they'll see it glorify God in the day of visitation submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake follow the rules and don't always try to Buck the system whether it be to the king as supreme or under governors as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and for the praise of them that do well for so is the will of God that with well-doing you may be you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men no matter what they say against us no matter how they insult us no matter what they do still do good as free and not using your Liberty for a cloak of maliciousness but as the Servants of God honor all men love the Brotherhood fear God honor the king learn please from my mistake with the guy in the truck I feel terrible about that I wish I could I wish I could go back in time I could have helped him so friends let's I could have witnessed to him I could have talked to him about the Lord Jesus I'm not going to make that mistake again and I don't want you all to make that mistake let's stand for Christ brother Jeremy let's bring him back those that have left Sons and Daughters let's go get them tell them about Jesus tell them about what Jesus has done in our lives maybe telling the story about this priest named jehoiah God bless you all brother Wilson if you come [Music] brother saying say whatever's on your heart praise whatever you want to do bless you my friend for how long can you put the words of the solid little course when he sees me he sees the blood of the Lamb can you put that on the screen [Music] some of you might remember that and when he sees me he sees the blood of the Lamb he sees me as perfect foreign [Music] foreign [Music] me in garments as wide as the snow for the land of God 's worthy he watched me this I know I claim the blood Jesus shared on cow for real those precious blood stains were made that just for me for us all my sins my sickness and my pain when I need healing I claim those precious blessings you know why there is power power Wonder working Power in the Blood I believe there is power power in the precious [Music] [Applause] well there is [Music] it one more time there is power power [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] in the Precious Blood of the lamb in the Precious Blood of the lamb in the Precious Blood of the land in the Precious Blood of the land [Music] foreign [Music] I guess Dan told me not to preach so I won't do that okay he asked me how long I was going to preach and I I didn't really know so I'll just say what's on your heart I appreciate the word today but I thought of another story there and actually in the second Samuel [Music] about a guy that was he was part of the royal family and under Saul Jonathan's son I can't even pronounce his name but anyway I won't even go there I looked at it several times and my my lips and my brain won't process it [Music] but a nurse because all the royal family was being killed because that was the that's what you did you didn't want any competition and did you know what churches get into that same mode because they don't want any competition and so this nurse took this this child which was John uh Saul's grandson Jonathan's son and took him and fled but while she was running to protect him because he was the last member of the Royal Family and trying to protect him she fell and and this this boy fell and he was lame he was only just a few years old and he was lame the rest of his life just a sad picture and she was trying to protect him but yet here he is now he's lame but then you know this thing of trying to destroy competition it's not God for him because look look look I don't have to make you less than I am to make me better than what I am you know you know that's not the way it works we make him great and whatever he wants to do that's just fine with me Hallelujah so anyway after a period of time David all of a sudden I want that David Spirit In Me Lyle I want David's Spirit of me David always repented always repented I want to always repent and so after while David's sitting here let me just wonder I said I wonder if there's any of the royal families still living so he kind of made an inquiry and see if there wasn't finally brought this guy and said yeah there's there's Jonathan's son Saul's grandson he yeah he's uh but he's you know he's he's not in good health he's um he's lame [Music] go fetch him can you imagine when the king's Chariot pulled up in front of his house he was scared to death yeah amen because he knew he was a dead man he was already a dead dog he said but he knew he was he was done for it and he thought oh God I mean you know here's here's the king's chariot but looks friend that's what happened to you and I [Music] we thought we were done for it but the king's Chariot come our way right Hallelujah I see the camels coming Hallelujah who's on the camel Hallelujah this bride is going home my friend and so so here here's this chariot find they finally finally get him to open the door now it took him a while to get to the door [Music] he's crippled the Bible says in both feet and he's trying to get to the door he finally gets there oh God King has requested you come and have an audience with him oh no they finally persuade him can you imagine this guy that is a nobody he gets comes up on the king's chariot he's going alone he said well I might as well enjoy this ride because I'm fixing I'm fixing it they go down we all felt that way for him some of us have made so many mistakes the blunders and over and over again but it's okay he's still a god of a second chance third fourth Hallelujah yes he is and so finally they get there and this guy walks in before the king and passed before him and David said get up [Music] Hallelujah and here's what David said oh church let me let me let me tell you to that this is what God's telling you Hallelujah because a friend if he's done this this for you and I we should want this for all of our friends we should want this for every brother every I don't care how far they've gone I don't care how far they've went away from God I don't care what they said against God against his Bible against his church it doesn't matter let's go get him amen let's go get them yeah yeah and so David says [Music] brother let me tell you something from this day forward you'll sit at my table the rest of your life you'll eat dinner breakfast lunch brunch and all the rest of them in between all the sex that's why that put lights in refrigerators for midnight snacks you could be here anytime you want to and so and and and this guy said I'm just a dead dog beside this everything that was your

they're going to repair on the houses it's all taken care of all that you're required to do is sit at the king's table but let me make one more observation [Music] when he sits down to the king's table and that beautiful tapestry that beautiful table covering when he sits down you don't see his lame feet he's covered Hallelujah let me tell you something one more thing I'm sorry please forgive me one more thing did you know what when when all of all of the sons David's Sons were going in to sit at the table we're talking about Good Men Great Men Mighty Men and and they were probably off-sitting and they're getting ready to to enjoy the the lamb or maybe a good T-bone steak or something and and but it took it took this guy a while to get there and they made a lot of noise trying to get there [Music] but look for him one thing about it they all saw him when he came in and let me tell you friend the world's going to see you when you come in too you know why because you're not
