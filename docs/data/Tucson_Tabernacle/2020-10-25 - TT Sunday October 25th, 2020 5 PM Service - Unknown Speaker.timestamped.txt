[44:04] this morning to encourage and to help
[44:05] you
[44:06] and to bless you in your journey and i
[44:08] just want to take a thought here tonight
[44:10] in
[44:10] book of proverbs the 24 24th chapter
[44:14] and the third verse solomon writing here
[44:17] says
[44:18] through wisdom isn't a house builded and
[44:22] by understanding
[44:23] it is established through wisdom isn't
[44:26] house builded
[44:28] and by understanding it is established
[44:30] in the book of first corinthians the
[44:32] third chapter
[44:33] first corinthians the third chapter and
[44:36] the eighth verse i want to
[44:38] speak to you a little bit tonight about
[44:40] building here
[44:41] and in first corinthians 3 and verse 8
[44:45] paul here writing says now he that
[44:48] planteth
[44:49] and he that watereth are one and every
[44:52] man shall receive his own reward
[44:54] according to his own labor
[44:56] for we are laborers together with god ye
[44:59] are god's husbandry ye are god's
[45:02] building according to the grace of god
[45:05] which is given unto me
[45:06] as a wise master builder i have laid the
[45:09] foundation
[45:10] and another buildeth their own but let
[45:12] every man take heed how he built a
[45:14] therapon
[45:15] for other foundation can no man lay
[45:18] then that is laid which is jesus christ
[45:21] now if
[45:22] any man build upon this foundation gold
[45:25] silver
[45:25] precious stones wood hay stubble
[45:29] every man's work shall be made manifest
[45:32] for the day
[45:32] shall declare it because it shall be
[45:34] revealed by fire
[45:36] and the fire shall try some of they say
[45:38] try
[45:39] the fire shall try every man's work of
[45:42] what sort it is
[45:44] if any man's work abide which he hath
[45:46] built thereupon he shall receive a
[45:48] reward
[45:49] if any man's work shall be burned he
[45:52] shall suffer loss
[45:53] but he himself shall be saved yet so as
[45:56] by fire
[45:57] then in second peter the first chapter
[46:00] one last place i'd like to read this
[46:01] evening and we'll
[46:02] pray and let you be seated in second
[46:04] peter the first chapter
[46:07] and i want to look there in the fifth
[46:08] verse the bible tells us that my
[46:11] wisdom is a house builded by
[46:12] understanding is a house established
[46:15] then paul's going to tell us about the
[46:16] foundation
[46:18] now we realize if you're going to build
[46:19] something you've got to have material to
[46:21] build it out of
[46:22] in second peter first chapter in the
[46:24] fifth verse peter says and besides this
[46:27] giving all diligence add to your faith
[46:29] virtue
[46:30] and to virtue knowledge and to knowledge
[46:33] temperance
[46:34] and to temperance patience and patience
[46:36] and the patience godliness
[46:38] and the godliness brotherly kindness and
[46:40] the brotherly kindness
[46:42] charity for if these things be in you
[46:45] and abound they make you
[46:49] if these things be in you and abound
[46:52] they
[46:52] make you they build you they establish
[46:54] you that ye shall neither be barren
[46:57] nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our
[47:00] lord jesus christ
[47:01] we ask lord this evening to add the
[47:03] blessing to the reading of his word as
[47:04] we just buy our heads together
[47:06] and we'll just ask the lord to come and
[47:07] speak to us heavenly father
[47:09] lord as your believing children have
[47:11] gathered themselves together here this
[47:12] evening
[47:13] father i realize that this is lord
[47:15] another service another opportunity lord
[47:19] that you have given us in this hour that
[47:21] we could come into your house and we
[47:22] could lay aside the cares of life
[47:24] we could lay aside the situations and
[47:26] the circumstances the things we're going
[47:28] through
[47:29] and father for just a few moments
[47:31] tonight i would ask that your grace
[47:33] would be ministered to our hearts i pray
[47:35] that you would come lord
[47:36] may you anoint us afresh tonight dear
[47:38] god lord may you
[47:40] move us aside lord that we could lord be
[47:42] a vessel that you could come and speak
[47:44] through but father may you not just
[47:46] anoint the speaker
[47:47] but may you anoint the here also lord
[47:48] and whatever lord
[47:50] any spirit that would try to hinder this
[47:52] meeting or bind it in any way
[47:54] i pray oh god you would drive it out of
[47:56] the building you would drive it away
[47:57] from the hearts of your children that
[47:59] liberty could come in this meeting
[48:00] tonight
[48:01] and lord when we would leave this place
[48:03] may we be able to say lord as those on
[48:04] the road to emmaus
[48:06] did not our hearts burn within us as he
[48:08] come and talk to us along the way and
[48:10] we'll be sure
[48:11] to give you all the praise and to give
[48:12] you all the honor and glory
[48:14] for it's in the wonderful name of our
[48:15] lord and savior jesus christ we pray
[48:18] and all the believers said amen
[48:21] and amen and may god richly bless you
[48:23] this evening as you have your seats
[48:25] amen from those scriptures tonight i
[48:27] want to talk to you here
[48:28] for just a few moments on a thought and
[48:30] if i would title this tonight
[48:32] i want to speak to you on the material
[48:34] that god
[48:35] built his church out of the material
[48:37] that god built his church out of and the
[48:39] message the infallible word of god
[48:41] brother brahma says what kind of
[48:43] material are you built out of
[48:45] is it methodist baptist catholic
[48:47] presbyterian
[48:48] lutheran pentecostal nazarene pilgrim
[48:50] holiness
[48:51] he says if you're not built out of bible
[48:53] material
[48:54] he said the boards drove on by the holy
[48:57] ghost
[48:58] he said then you better tear off the
[48:59] boards and get built right so if you're
[49:02] not built out of bible material
[49:04] he's actually saying tear down what's
[49:06] been built without the right material
[49:08] and go back and build it with the right
[49:09] material in another quote he says i
[49:11] think
[49:11] every christian amen ought to take the
[49:13] same attitude that's right
[49:15] we want to know where we're standing we
[49:17] don't want our eternal destination
[49:19] amen built upon the shifting sands of
[49:22] some
[49:22] church theology amen but on the eternal
[49:25] word of the living god
[49:27] right because remember every one of you
[49:29] sitting here tonight
[49:30] he said stormy times is going to hit
[49:32] that building that you're setting in
[49:34] tonight that's right
[49:35] he said death is going to strike it and
[49:37] you better know
[49:38] what kind of a sand it's built upon
[49:41] or what kind of a foundation it has now
[49:44] i think tonight that we're all aware
[49:46] that we're not angels here tonight but
[49:47] we're humans we're
[49:48] we're human beings we have trials we
[49:50] have tribulations we have persecution
[49:53] amen we go through all kinds of things
[49:54] and sometimes i
[49:56] i'll be reading through the bible and
[49:57] i'll read about paul or peter or james
[49:59] or john
[50:00] amend different men in the bible and you
[50:02] read about them and you see the things
[50:04] they went through
[50:05] and when you read about the things they
[50:06] went through something comes over you to
[50:08] say how
[50:09] did they go through that and come out
[50:10] still a christian how
[50:12] how did they go through that and come
[50:13] out a believer and then sometimes i
[50:15] think well
[50:15] you know i'd like to go find those
[50:17] people i like to sit down and talk to
[50:18] him which we all know that they've gone
[50:20] beyond the curtain of time now they've
[50:21] passed on to their reward
[50:22] amen but then the reality strikes my
[50:24] heart amen
[50:26] that those people that went through
[50:27] those things amen may be gone
[50:29] amen but the god that got them through
[50:31] what they went through is the same god
[50:34] that is here with the church tonight and
[50:36] therefore if god got them through their
[50:37] trials if god got them through their
[50:39] tribulation
[50:40] then that same god is here tonight so
[50:42] i'm speaking to a people tonight
[50:44] amen that as i said this morning is a
[50:45] people of paradox amen
[50:47] it is a people that you it is incredible
[50:49] that you're still here amen
[50:51] amen the world don't know why you're
[50:52] still here let's just preach for a
[50:54] moment
[50:54] amen the the you may not even know why
[50:57] you're here tonight but let me say this
[50:59] amen if god has still got you here he's
[51:01] got you here for a purpose amen
[51:03] if god has preserved your life and has
[51:05] kept you amen through everything you've
[51:07] been through
[51:08] amen then you're here for a purpose
[51:09] tonight now i was just
[51:11] recently listening to a tape and the
[51:13] tape was presuming preached in 1962
[51:16] and the prophet of god says amen to
[51:18] presume
[51:19] means to venture without actual
[51:21] authority now we realize that the world
[51:23] tonight is in a presuming state can you
[51:26] say
[51:26] man amen they're presuming they're
[51:28] guessing they're hoping they're probing
[51:30] they're looking for something
[51:31] amen the world is in a presuming mode
[51:33] then we find
[51:34] amen that the church world has moved
[51:36] under that same condition
[51:38] where it's not just the world presuming
[51:40] it's not just governments presuming or
[51:42] politicians presuming
[51:43] but actually churches are presuming
[51:45] church leaders are presuming
[51:47] but the problem of god is going to say
[51:49] this is not the hour
[51:50] amen to be presumed he would say now
[51:52] we're not here presuming anything
[51:54] we see it we know that god is here amen
[51:57] the holy spirit the great god the god of
[52:00] elijah
[52:00] amen the holy ghost which is the witness
[52:03] of the last
[52:04] day is pulling his ministry right into
[52:06] the church
[52:07] the same thing that our lord did he said
[52:10] the high priest is descending from the
[52:12] throne
[52:13] amen to the church and the church is
[52:15] heaping itself up with the word
[52:17] because he can only come to the word he
[52:19] is the word
[52:20] he said the word can't come to an
[52:22] almanac it won't fit
[52:24] amen so the word has to come to the word
[52:27] amen
[52:27] then we find tonight that we're not
[52:29] building out of theology
[52:31] amen we're not building out of education
[52:33] but we're building
[52:34] actually by bible material which is the
[52:37] word
[52:37] then we find tonight that the bride of
[52:39] jesus christ she is not presuming
[52:42] amen she knows who she is amen she knows
[52:45] who's she is amen she knows where she
[52:48] come from she knows where she's at
[52:49] and she knows where she's going the
[52:51] right of jesus christ he is not
[52:53] presuming we
[52:54] have amen scriptural and supreme
[52:57] authority tonight can you say amen
[53:00] amen your amens won't scare me okay amen
[53:02] we have supreme authority
[53:04] and we have scriptural authority now we
[53:06] find denied
[53:07] that not anybody can be the bride of
[53:09] jesus christ
[53:10] it is not an open invitation it is only
[53:12] to the elected
[53:14] amen the chosen of god from before amen
[53:17] the foundation of the world those are
[53:18] the ones that god
[53:20] amen has called to be his bride amen
[53:23] in this hour then we find amen that the
[53:25] bride is not amen she is not called to
[53:27] be
[53:28] bribed by her own will amen but god
[53:30] called her to be the bride
[53:33] in the message of total deliverance the
[53:34] prophet said when god sends a man to do
[53:36] anything
[53:37] amen he completely equips him with
[53:40] everything that he has need of
[53:42] if god calls a man to be a preacher then
[53:44] he puts something in him to preach with
[53:46] if he calls him to be a teacher he puts
[53:48] something in him to teach with
[53:50] if he calls him to be a prophet then he
[53:52] put something in him to see visions
[53:54] and to be a prophet god always amen
[53:57] completely
[53:58] equips his man amen so if he calls him
[54:01] to be a preacher
[54:02] he's not asking the man to go out in the
[54:04] world or to something
[54:05] some seminary and find a material to
[54:08] preach with but actually
[54:10] he's going to give him the stuff to
[54:11] manifest the call that is upon his life
[54:14] then i'll say it this way
[54:15] amen we're not looking for material
[54:17] tonight to be the bride
[54:19] amen but we already have the material to
[54:21] be the bride of jesus christ when god
[54:24] calls a man he completely equips the man
[54:26] when god calls a teacher
[54:28] he completely equips the teacher when
[54:30] god calls a singer
[54:31] amen he completely equips the singer
[54:33] amen then when god
[54:35] calls a bride he completely equips the
[54:38] bride
[54:38] amen with what she has need of to
[54:40] fulfill amen the commission that has
[54:42] been placed upon her life
[54:44] by the almighty god amen i think of how
[54:47] in genesis the sixth chapter
[54:48] amen that noah did not call god amen but
[54:51] god called noah amen
[54:53] and he called him to do something he
[54:55] called him to build he meant and to
[54:57] build the ark now brother
[54:58] says god actually gave noah the order
[55:00] amen the form and the use of the ark
[55:03] in genesis 6 chapter and the 13th verse
[55:06] and god
[55:07] said and in noah the end of all flesh is
[55:09] come before me
[55:10] for the earth is filled with violence
[55:12] through them and behold
[55:14] i will destroy them with the earth but
[55:16] make thee an
[55:17] ark of go for wood amen room shalt thou
[55:19] make in the ark and shall pitch it
[55:21] within and without with pitch
[55:22] and this is the fashion which thou shall
[55:25] make it of the length of the ark
[55:27] amen shall be 300 cubits and the breadth
[55:30] of it 50 cubits
[55:31] and the height of it 30 cubits a window
[55:34] shalt thou make to the ark and in a
[55:35] cubit shall thou finish it above
[55:37] and the door of the ark shall thou set
[55:39] in the sight thereof
[55:40] amen with lower second and third story
[55:42] shalt thou make it
[55:44] and behold i which is god even i do
[55:47] bring
[55:48] a flood of waters upon the earth amen to
[55:50] destroy all flesh wherein is the breath
[55:52] of life
[55:52] amen from under heaven and everything
[55:55] that is in the earth shall die
[55:56] amen but i love verse number 18 amen but
[55:59] with fee
[56:00] i will establish my covenant and thou
[56:02] shall come
[56:03] into the ark thou shalt and my sons and
[56:06] thy wife and thy son's wife with thee
[56:08] and of every living thing of all flesh
[56:11] amen two of every sort shall i bring in
[56:13] the ark
[56:13] amen to keep them alive with thee and
[56:15] thou shall be male
[56:16] and female of fouls after their kind of
[56:19] cattle after their kind
[56:20] of creeping thing of the earth after his
[56:22] kind amen too of every sort shall come
[56:25] unto thee to keep them alive
[56:26] and take thou unto thee all of the food
[56:28] that is heated and thou shall
[56:30] gather it to thee and it shall be for
[56:32] food for thee and for them
[56:33] and thus did noah according to all that
[56:37] god
[56:37] commanded him amen so did he amen what's
[56:41] amazing here is god
[56:42] actually delivers unto noah some
[56:45] instructions
[56:46] and he says no i want you to build an
[56:47] ark now the prophet picks this up
[56:49] and says noah's works expressed to man
[56:52] what his faith was
[56:53] in god's promise he said now god met
[56:56] noah and he said noah it's going to rain
[56:59] i'm going to destroy the whole earth
[57:00] with water now it never had rain that's
[57:03] the impossibility
[57:04] amen but said prepare an arc of the
[57:06] dimensions that i tell you about
[57:08] and him being a carpenter he went to
[57:11] work and began to take his footed eyes
[57:13] and everything to cut the boards
[57:15] and fix it up there with the him
[57:17] wood and put the pitch in it just like
[57:18] he said
[57:19] and you imagine what people thought
[57:21] about that man
[57:22] they said that man is actually crazy
[57:26] because he says it's going to bring
[57:28] water out of the heavens and there's no
[57:30] water up there
[57:31] but you see noah didn't think about that
[57:33] his works was
[57:34] expressing to the people what his faith
[57:37] was
[57:37] and what god said would take place
[57:40] that's the reason the genuine christian
[57:42] amen separates himself from everything
[57:44] but the word of god
[57:46] amen no matter what the people think
[57:48] what anybody else says
[57:49] he isn't just saying that if he is it
[57:52] won't be long till his works will be
[57:53] make known
[57:54] he'll fall back and slip this way and
[57:56] join this when he'll show what he is
[57:58] but if he is a genuine if the word of
[58:00] god has been it in him
[58:02] then it's going to bring forth of its
[58:04] kind you'll see that man preparing for
[58:06] that great hour
[58:08] see that's the way noah did amen now
[58:10] think of this noah receives instructions
[58:13] amen to build an ark and the prophet put
[58:14] a beautiful thing in there
[58:16] he said and noah being a carpenter amen
[58:19] noah being a carpenter receives
[58:21] amen the blueprint amen now here's what
[58:23] astounding to me
[58:24] is no one is not look at it and say god
[58:26] we need to change this
[58:28] and we need to change that and we need
[58:30] to change this but noah just receives it
[58:32] and he actually begins to work on it no
[58:34] matter how crazy
[58:36] it looks no matter how ridiculous it is
[58:38] he meant because noah had a commission
[58:41] and god sent him the material to fulfill
[58:44] the commission
[58:45] amen we didn't know until the prophet
[58:46] told us that there were other boats in
[58:48] those days
[58:49] we just thought there was the ark amen
[58:51] but the prophet said in those days
[58:53] there were other boats you do know
[58:56] brother baby said that right
[58:58] in those days there were other boats in
[59:00] the days of noah when noah was building
[59:02] that great boat
[59:03] that was going to stem the tides well no
[59:05] doubt but many of the church members of
[59:07] that day
[59:07] said why that fanatic what if it does
[59:10] happen what if it does happen what if it
[59:12] doesn't happen
[59:12] what if there does come a storm well
[59:14] we'll get an our boat and ride
[59:16] amen because our boat is as good as
[59:18] their boat our boat will float as much
[59:20] as theirs
[59:21] whether it's god constructed or not they
[59:24] say i belong to this church i joined
[59:26] over here
[59:26] that's as good as any of them he said
[59:28] remember when the floods came
[59:30] amen only the god-constructed boat
[59:33] floated
[59:34] when the floods began to descend amen
[59:37] only the god-constructed boat
[59:39] was the only one that flooded in other
[59:41] words they presumed they would be all
[59:43] right
[59:43] amen but presuming amen was the ticket
[59:46] to drowning
[59:47] amen but obedience was the ticket amen
[59:50] to getting on the god constructed boat
[59:52] and he says unless that is god
[59:54] constructed it will not stand
[59:56] no denomination unless it's god
[59:58] constructed by god's construction here
[1:00:01] that it will not stand see it has to
[1:00:03] come the way
[1:00:04] that god said build it amen it's got to
[1:00:07] be holy ghost material and holy ghost
[1:00:10] material
[1:00:11] actually makes holy ghost people
[1:00:15] holy ghost material amen makes holy
[1:00:18] ghost people
[1:00:19] he said a cypress boat material amen
[1:00:22] makes a cypress boat
[1:00:24] a poplar material makes a poplar boat
[1:00:26] see what i mean and
[1:00:28] a worldly material makes a whirly church
[1:00:30] amen but a holy ghost material
[1:00:33] actually makes a holy ghost church amen
[1:00:36] then you find noah's construction
[1:00:38] amen was according to his instruction
[1:00:41] which came from god
[1:00:42] he said he know that his construction
[1:00:44] had been according to his instruction
[1:00:46] and i wonder if our construction will
[1:00:49] compare with the instructions that we
[1:00:51] have been given
[1:00:52] see now when noah's family got on the
[1:00:54] ark amen they saw the other boat seeking
[1:00:57] amen they looked out the window and no
[1:00:58] doubt noah's daughter-in-law's
[1:01:00] no doubt noah's sons and his and his and
[1:01:03] all those people
[1:01:04] amen no doubt they knew those other
[1:01:06] people amen no doubt they had went to
[1:01:08] school with them
[1:01:09] amen they had played with them amen and
[1:01:11] when they got in that ark
[1:01:12] and noah and the door was closed and
[1:01:14] they looked out the window and they saw
[1:01:16] amen the rain began to fall and they
[1:01:18] begin to see it accumulate
[1:01:20] and they begin to see those other boats
[1:01:22] that their friends were in they begin to
[1:01:24] see them sink
[1:01:25] the prophet said it this way he said
[1:01:27] finally the waters got deeper
[1:01:29] he and deeper and deeper he said but
[1:01:31] noah checked
[1:01:32] everything every corner was pitched in
[1:01:36] he said mother it's got to work god
[1:01:38] promised it this way
[1:01:39] why she said i looked out there and i
[1:01:41] saw the joneses and so forth
[1:01:43] their boat sunk right down and ours is
[1:01:45] still setting on the ground
[1:01:47] amen it just takes a little more
[1:01:49] persecution amen a little more judgment
[1:01:51] of god to bring it up
[1:01:52] and finally the waters got deeper and
[1:01:55] deeper and after a while
[1:01:56] the whole family felt something move he
[1:01:59] meant and she left the ground
[1:02:01] amen all of a sudden they began to feel
[1:02:03] a move and she left the ground and i'm
[1:02:05] kind of getting tired
[1:02:07] of this old pest house at 53 years old
[1:02:09] one of these days
[1:02:10] i expect amen to feel something move we
[1:02:14] want to leave and the ark was going up
[1:02:16] while the other sank amen the ark was
[1:02:19] going up
[1:02:20] god in his word had fulfilled his
[1:02:22] promise amen and
[1:02:23] now here's what i want you to notice
[1:02:25] amen satan tried to discourage him
[1:02:27] amen he tried to discourage him through
[1:02:29] the people of that day
[1:02:31] through the religions of that behavior
[1:02:33] amen to the science of that day
[1:02:34] but there was nothing the devil could
[1:02:36] anoint people
[1:02:38] amen to discourage noah with amen that
[1:02:40] was enough to stop him from building
[1:02:42] because a commission fell upon his life
[1:02:45] and in the face of every adversary
[1:02:47] amenoa was made out of stuff
[1:02:50] amen that was not destroyed amen that
[1:02:52] was not that was not that was not
[1:02:54] persecuted enough to quit working
[1:02:56] amen is it okay to have church here
[1:02:57] tonight i mean i think that's what we
[1:02:58] gathered for a ride
[1:02:59] amen let me say this church the only
[1:03:02] reason why you're here
[1:03:03] is because you're not made out of stuff
[1:03:06] amen that falls apart
[1:03:07] at the first trouble that falls apart at
[1:03:10] the first situation
[1:03:11] amen can we preach tonight amen some of
[1:03:13] you have been through enough stuff
[1:03:15] you shouldn't be sitting here tonight
[1:03:16] amen satan's trying to discourage you
[1:03:19] he's tried to beat you he's tried to
[1:03:21] kill you amen but the reason why you're
[1:03:23] here tonight
[1:03:24] is because you're a holy ghost church
[1:03:27] aiming with holy ghost material
[1:03:29] and that's the material that will
[1:03:31] weather the flood
[1:03:32] it will weather the bombs it will
[1:03:34] weather the war
[1:03:35] oh god it'll weather every storm
[1:03:38] that comes this way because it's god's
[1:03:41] material
[1:03:43] my to thank noah amen was discouraged
[1:03:46] amen noah was
[1:03:47] he was he was beat down he was lifetime
[1:03:50] he was made fun of
[1:03:51] amen but he never lost the vision
[1:03:56] he never lost sight of what god told him
[1:03:59] to do
[1:04:00] now one thing that amazes me is in order
[1:04:02] to accomplish a project
[1:04:04] amen there has to be a master
[1:04:08] which a master means one in charge
[1:04:12] amen now you found the ark it would have
[1:04:14] never got
[1:04:15] built amen had noah left the
[1:04:17] instructions
[1:04:18] up for opinions amen it's amazing when
[1:04:21] noah received the instructions from the
[1:04:23] lord
[1:04:23] and he takes them down there he doesn't
[1:04:25] go down there and gather all the city
[1:04:27] around
[1:04:27] and say what do you think about this
[1:04:31] amen but he judged him faithful that
[1:04:33] delivered the instructions
[1:04:35] amen because people would have said noah
[1:04:37] amen there's no need to build it this
[1:04:38] big
[1:04:39] and there's nobody to deal with that big
[1:04:41] amen but god was looking for obedience
[1:04:43] amen god was looking for somebody amen
[1:04:46] that would just stand
[1:04:48] and do what he called him to do in the
[1:04:50] face of criticism
[1:04:51] i think it's amazing how the prophet
[1:04:53] said i'm not trying amen to a serp
[1:04:55] authority or something like that but you
[1:04:56] see a man
[1:04:57] or anything with two heads to it doesn't
[1:05:00] know how to go
[1:05:01] god never did have two heads to his
[1:05:03] church he never did
[1:05:05] it's one head he always dealt in every
[1:05:07] generation
[1:05:08] as we've studied through the scriptures
[1:05:10] there's always one individual that he
[1:05:12] deals with
[1:05:13] because you get two men amen you get two
[1:05:15] opinions
[1:05:16] it's got to come to one final absolute
[1:05:19] amen and my absolute is the word amen
[1:05:22] the bible
[1:05:23] amen then you see why amen we got 900
[1:05:27] different denominations
[1:05:29] it's because they never came to one
[1:05:32] absolute
[1:05:32] we've got amen we've got now that was
[1:05:34] that was in the 60s
[1:05:36] that we had 900 amen but think about
[1:05:38] tonight i think last time i had a camp
[1:05:40] there was 33
[1:05:41] 000 amen different sections and
[1:05:43] different breakups and different
[1:05:45] denominations
[1:05:46] amen based upon one bible they're all
[1:05:48] claiming the same bible
[1:05:50] and 33 000 different churches amen
[1:05:53] different opinions of one bible
[1:05:55] which one do we follow amen but here's
[1:05:57] the shout material
[1:05:59] in the last days god would send a
[1:06:01] prophet that would take the same bible
[1:06:03] that they were divided by and would open
[1:06:06] it up to the bride
[1:06:07] and that bible would not divide the
[1:06:09] church that bible would unite the church
[1:06:12] and i say tonight amen because we've got
[1:06:14] a message
[1:06:15] amen i don't think there should be any
[1:06:17] opinion different on predestination
[1:06:20] than what a prophet taught i don't think
[1:06:22] there's any room
[1:06:23] amen for a different opinion on the
[1:06:24] seventh seal than what the prophet
[1:06:26] taught
[1:06:26] are you hearing me amen sometime or
[1:06:28] another church we've got to come back
[1:06:31] amen to one final absolute or that job
[1:06:34] will never get done
[1:06:35] amen see we've got to come back amen to
[1:06:38] one
[1:06:38] final absolute and that is the word
[1:06:42] see now you find then in colossians 1 16
[1:06:45] my bible says for by him somebody say by
[1:06:48] him
[1:06:49] we're all things created that are in
[1:06:52] heaven and that are in earth visible
[1:06:54] and invisible whether they be thrones or
[1:06:56] dominions or principalities or powers
[1:06:59] all things were created by him
[1:07:02] and for him created by him and for him
[1:07:06] and he is before all things amen and by
[1:07:09] him all things consist
[1:07:11] see then if there's got to be a master
[1:07:13] amen then christ
[1:07:15] is the master of all things he
[1:07:18] is the master of all things and let me
[1:07:20] say this
[1:07:21] and he is in all things the prophet said
[1:07:23] whether it be father son holy ghost
[1:07:25] he is before all things before all
[1:07:28] things that's in heaven and earth
[1:07:29] visible invisible or anything this son
[1:07:32] of god
[1:07:33] was before all things that's right i
[1:07:35] don't care if it's thrones dominions
[1:07:37] whatever it is
[1:07:38] amen heavenly thrones amen kingdoms
[1:07:40] whatever it might be
[1:07:42] in the great supernatural realm beyond
[1:07:44] in the eternities where it was
[1:07:46] whatever it was angels gods whatever it
[1:07:49] was
[1:07:50] he is before all things
[1:07:53] and there is nothing amen that can make
[1:07:55] it run but
[1:07:56] him see then a prophet here
[1:07:59] is turning our focus amen back not to a
[1:08:02] man but to christ
[1:08:04] and saying whether it's god the father
[1:08:06] god the son
[1:08:07] whether it's the angels the
[1:08:08] principalities the powers
[1:08:10] dominions whatever it is all things run
[1:08:13] by him
[1:08:14] and all things consist by him and the
[1:08:17] prophet shouts
[1:08:18] he amen let's say that together he see
[1:08:21] who is that he
[1:08:23] it is christ amen the return of christ
[1:08:26] in the church see the master what what
[1:08:29] does the word master mean
[1:08:30] the word master means having or showing
[1:08:33] very great skill
[1:08:34] amen or proficiency amen the main thing
[1:08:38] or the principal thing
[1:08:39] now we find then that the prophet is
[1:08:41] going to tell us that christ
[1:08:43] is the principal or the master he says
[1:08:46] he is the principal theme
[1:08:47] of the entire bible the bible is christ
[1:08:51] another place he says he is the thing he
[1:08:53] was the prophets
[1:08:54] he was in them he was in the psalms he
[1:08:56] was in the history
[1:08:57] and he is in the thanks to come he is
[1:09:00] the same yesterday
[1:09:01] amen today and forever amen see notice
[1:09:04] here he should be
[1:09:06] the principal amen tucson tabernacle can
[1:09:08] i talk to you tonight
[1:09:09] amen if you're going to go forward amen
[1:09:12] if you're going to take your family
[1:09:13] forward
[1:09:14] if you're going to go any further amen
[1:09:16] than where you are right now
[1:09:17] amen christ has got to return as the
[1:09:20] principal theme
[1:09:21] amen of our talking amen of our singing
[1:09:24] of our church gathering
[1:09:25] amen if christ is not the theme of this
[1:09:28] church we might as well turn the lights
[1:09:30] off
[1:09:30] amen and board up the doors it's another
[1:09:33] building with a bunch of religious
[1:09:34] people
[1:09:35] amen but if christ comes in amen if
[1:09:37] christ comes in the church
[1:09:39] he will be the principal theme of our
[1:09:41] thinking he will be the principle theme
[1:09:43] of our singing
[1:09:44] he will be the principle theme of our
[1:09:45] walks he should be the principal
[1:09:48] theme of our life
[1:09:51] oh somebody say christ amen christ
[1:09:55] if he's the principal theme of the bible
[1:09:57] and the bible is in us
[1:09:59] amen then he should be the principal
[1:10:01] theme of everything we do
[1:10:03] amen say or think should be christ
[1:10:06] that might say it this way only what's
[1:10:09] done by
[1:10:10] christ and for christ will last
[1:10:15] only what's done by christ amen and for
[1:10:18] christ
[1:10:18] will last now if you look in psalms 127
[1:10:21] verse 1
[1:10:22] david says it this way he says accept
[1:10:24] the lord
[1:10:25] amen build the house except who the lord
[1:10:29] build the house amen they labor in vain
[1:10:32] that build it
[1:10:33] except the lord keep the city then the
[1:10:36] watchman waketh but in vain
[1:10:38] see so david here is showing you if the
[1:10:40] lord does not do it
[1:10:42] then we're wasting our time if the lord
[1:10:44] is not in it
[1:10:45] then it will not be a success if christ
[1:10:48] is not the principle of it then it's
[1:10:49] only a matter of time
[1:10:51] amen before it falls apart before enough
[1:10:54] storms hits it
[1:10:55] before enough troubles hit it before it
[1:10:57] crumbles at the foundation
[1:10:58] amen but if it is built by christ amen
[1:11:01] there is no fire too hot
[1:11:03] there is no water too powerful there is
[1:11:05] no storm too strong
[1:11:07] that can tear down amen what god has
[1:11:09] built up
[1:11:10] and i'll say to you tonight church amen
[1:11:12] let's just have church here tonight if
[1:11:14] that's okay
[1:11:15] this church amen if you'll agree with me
[1:11:17] you've been through some things
[1:11:19] you've been through some troubles you've
[1:11:20] been through some hard times
[1:11:22] you've been through some let downs
[1:11:24] you've been through some victories
[1:11:25] amen but why is tucson tabernacle amen
[1:11:28] still standing here tonight
[1:11:30] amen because the lord built the house
[1:11:32] amen because the lord
[1:11:34] amen would raise up a ministry amen to
[1:11:36] build the church
[1:11:37] not on the foundation of a man on the
[1:11:40] foundation of christ the word
[1:11:41] and if it's built on christ then it'll
[1:11:44] last
[1:11:46] are you hearing me if it's built on
[1:11:48] christ then there's nothing coming
[1:11:50] there's nothing being and there's
[1:11:52] nothing that is that'll tear down what
[1:11:54] the lord has done
[1:11:56] my to think tonight if the lord builds
[1:11:59] the house
[1:12:00] amen if christ amen is the master of the
[1:12:03] building now you realize there in first
[1:12:04] corinthians 3 where we read
[1:12:06] the bible says paul amen was a master
[1:12:09] builder right
[1:12:10] amen now what made paul a master builder
[1:12:12] it was because
[1:12:13] christ was in him
[1:12:17] and who is christ christ is the master
[1:12:20] see the master was in paul amen see now
[1:12:24] if i said this way
[1:12:25] amen if you take a man who is a murderer
[1:12:27] and he goes around killing people
[1:12:29] and he goes around shooting and cutting
[1:12:31] and all kinds of terrible crimes
[1:12:33] but he's a murderer see he's a he's just
[1:12:35] any kind of murderer
[1:12:37] amen but if john dillinger's spirit
[1:12:38] comes in him that's going to make him
[1:12:41] the master murderer amen because john
[1:12:43] dillinger was actually titled
[1:12:45] amen the master murder amen let me say
[1:12:47] it this way if you take an individual
[1:12:49] that plays a piano
[1:12:50] they play the piano beautiful amen
[1:12:52] they're just another piano player
[1:12:54] amen but if beethoven's spirit comes in
[1:12:56] them he meant because beethoven was
[1:12:58] claimed to be
[1:12:59] amen a master pianoist then if
[1:13:02] beethoven's spirit comes in them
[1:13:04] it's going to move them amen from being
[1:13:06] a pianist
[1:13:07] amen to being a master pianoist amen
[1:13:10] then you see
[1:13:11] amen paul was another builder among
[1:13:13] other builders
[1:13:14] amen but when the spirit of christ amen
[1:13:17] descended into paul
[1:13:18] it moved him amen from being a prophet
[1:13:21] amen to being a master prophet
[1:13:23] amen from being a preacher and just a
[1:13:26] builder amen to a master builder
[1:13:28] why because christ was in him then can i
[1:13:31] say tonight
[1:13:32] church it was not paul building amen but
[1:13:34] it was christ
[1:13:37] it was christ who had claimed paul's
[1:13:39] body amen see it wasn't paul building
[1:13:42] amen paul was a surrendered vessel amen
[1:13:44] that christ
[1:13:45] had claimed amen it was christ building
[1:13:48] through
[1:13:49] paul in first corinthians 3 10 according
[1:13:52] to the grace of god which is given to me
[1:13:53] as a
[1:13:54] wise master builder
[1:13:58] amen as a wise master builder now the
[1:14:01] the word definition their master builder
[1:14:03] is an architect
[1:14:06] the superintendent in the erection of
[1:14:08] buildings
[1:14:09] the master of a project so when paul is
[1:14:12] talking here
[1:14:13] he is not talking about a physical
[1:14:15] building amen but what he's talking
[1:14:17] about
[1:14:17] he's talking about a people see the
[1:14:20] church
[1:14:20] that paul's talking about was not a
[1:14:22] building amen the church was a body
[1:14:26] a men of people who truly believed in
[1:14:28] jesus christ
[1:14:29] i find it amazing that god actually gave
[1:14:32] paul the grace
[1:14:33] amen the strength and the power and the
[1:14:36] ability to reach people
[1:14:38] for jesus christ and to assemble them
[1:14:41] together
[1:14:41] into a body to worship god see whether
[1:14:45] where they met did not matter amen can i
[1:14:47] preach to you tonight
[1:14:48] amen this church here this building is a
[1:14:50] beautiful building
[1:14:51] amen but if tomorrow it was gone the
[1:14:53] church is still here
[1:14:55] are you hearing me if tomorrow the
[1:14:56] building and god forbid but if the bill
[1:14:58] didn't burn up or or a flood was trying
[1:15:00] to build and amen and you couldn't
[1:15:02] gather in this building the church is
[1:15:03] still here
[1:15:04] amen the church is not dissolved amen
[1:15:07] the church is not washed away
[1:15:08] because the church is not a building
[1:15:11] amen the church
[1:15:12] is a body so what paul is saying is
[1:15:15] they could meet in a home they could
[1:15:17] meet in a hut they could meet in a cave
[1:15:20] they could meet in a field a backyard a
[1:15:22] public building or a church building
[1:15:24] but wherever the body was they could
[1:15:26] have church
[1:15:29] brother amen so it so then that tells me
[1:15:32] the church
[1:15:33] amen actually it's not the building but
[1:15:35] it's the people
[1:15:37] so when paul says i am a wise master
[1:15:40] builder
[1:15:41] he's not talking about laying concrete
[1:15:43] he's not talking about putting up
[1:15:45] sheetrock
[1:15:45] amen or putting tuba force together but
[1:15:48] he's talking about taking people
[1:15:49] amen and beginning to build with people
[1:15:52] now now the message here ye him
[1:15:54] so glad to be here at the church again
[1:15:55] tonight the church is not exactly a
[1:15:57] church building
[1:15:58] amen but a church is where the people
[1:16:01] have gathered another place he says the
[1:16:02] old testament
[1:16:03] amen the church was called the kingdom
[1:16:05] of god in other words god is a king
[1:16:08] and the church is his domain amen seek
[1:16:10] god's kingdom the old testament
[1:16:12] in the new testament it's called the
[1:16:14] messianic empire
[1:16:15] oh i like that messianic in other words
[1:16:17] and otherwise the messiah's empire
[1:16:19] therefore amen the church is not an
[1:16:22] organization
[1:16:23] amen the church is not a gathering of
[1:16:26] people
[1:16:27] amen the church is the people of god
[1:16:30] that has been called out
[1:16:31] of the world to serve in another kingdom
[1:16:35] amen now let me see it this way through
[1:16:36] seven amen successive church ages
[1:16:39] amen god has been building a people
[1:16:43] in the message dedication now we already
[1:16:46] have the stones
[1:16:47] amen the stones that god for ordained
[1:16:49] see and we've got them
[1:16:50] all the way from ephesus amen to
[1:16:53] laodicea
[1:16:54] now think about this the prophet goes
[1:16:56] all the way back amen to ephesus
[1:16:59] and says from ephesus to smyrna amen to
[1:17:01] pergamos to fight tyra
[1:17:03] amen this hardest to philadelphia until
[1:17:06] all those seven ages
[1:17:07] amen was stoned amen but was people
[1:17:10] amen and we've got them but we're only
[1:17:12] waiting amen for that headstone
[1:17:15] that the builders rejected waiting for
[1:17:18] his coming
[1:17:19] he says the capping stone now but the
[1:17:22] troop ride another place the first seal
[1:17:24] the true bride will be made up of
[1:17:26] thousands times thousands of people
[1:17:28] but it will be the elect out of every
[1:17:31] age
[1:17:31] every time a message went forth and the
[1:17:33] people believed it and accepted it all
[1:17:35] the light it was
[1:17:36] when they were sealed amen then they
[1:17:38] were sealed
[1:17:39] away until that day of redemption are
[1:17:42] you hearing me
[1:17:42] amen then paul amen built the ephesians
[1:17:46] amen each messenger built the people
[1:17:48] amen but in this last day
[1:17:50] there's going to be more in heaven than
[1:17:52] just what come out of laodicea
[1:17:55] he says another place harvest time look
[1:17:57] hurry and there must come a true seed
[1:17:59] amen see there's got to be one because
[1:18:01] he's coming for the bride without spot a
[1:18:02] wrinkle
[1:18:03] he is coming for it amen he calls it a
[1:18:05] word
[1:18:06] vindicated bride oh she'll be such a
[1:18:09] bitty
[1:18:09] a little bitty group but jesus said as
[1:18:11] it was in the days of noah
[1:18:12] wherein eight souls were saved so shall
[1:18:15] it be in the coming of the son of man
[1:18:17] how many
[1:18:18] i don't know but seek the bride somebody
[1:18:20] shout the bride
[1:18:21] but the bride is going to be made up of
[1:18:24] all down true that had the word in
[1:18:28] their age it's not just this last group
[1:18:31] but god is going to take the whole thing
[1:18:34] out of there
[1:18:36] then if you'll look within the book of
[1:18:37] revelation the first chapter and the
[1:18:39] 12th verse
[1:18:40] here paul is writing about the patmos
[1:18:42] vision and in the 12th verse he says
[1:18:44] and i turn to see the voice that spake
[1:18:46] with me and being turned
[1:18:48] he says i saw seven golden candlesticks
[1:18:51] and in the midst of the seven
[1:18:52] candlesticks was
[1:18:54] one amen was one like in the son of man
[1:18:57] who was clothed the garment down the
[1:18:59] foot and dirt about with pabst with a
[1:19:01] golden girdle now notice here
[1:19:03] you've got you've got seven candles i
[1:19:04] mean you've got seven candlesticks
[1:19:06] you've got seven amen seven spirits amen
[1:19:10] one with each age
[1:19:11] but in the middle of those it's not two
[1:19:14] men
[1:19:14] amen it's not three men but it's one
[1:19:17] like unto the son of man which is christ
[1:19:21] amen then you read that and you say what
[1:19:23] what is that seven candlestick what what
[1:19:25] is that then in verse 20 jesus speaking
[1:19:28] the mystery of the seven stars which
[1:19:30] thou sawest in my right hand
[1:19:32] and the seven golden candlesticks the
[1:19:35] seven stars
[1:19:36] are the angels of the seven churches and
[1:19:39] the seven candlesticks
[1:19:41] which thou sawest are the seven churches
[1:19:43] can i say it this way
[1:19:45] those seven stars amen were seven master
[1:19:48] builders
[1:19:51] seven stars amen seven master builders
[1:19:54] each age messenger amen was building but
[1:19:57] they were building by christ
[1:19:59] amen in the star messenger of that age
[1:20:02] see
[1:20:02] it was christ that came into paul it was
[1:20:05] christ that came into luther
[1:20:07] it was christ that came into wesley it
[1:20:09] was christ
[1:20:10] are you hearing me that came into martin
[1:20:12] it was christ that came into columbia
[1:20:14] the product of god picks this up in the
[1:20:15] church age book how many thanks gone for
[1:20:17] a church age book
[1:20:18] he says in his right hand were seven
[1:20:20] stars and he had in his right hand seven
[1:20:22] stars
[1:20:23] now of course we already know from verse
[1:20:26] 20
[1:20:26] that the seven stars actually are he
[1:20:29] said the mystery the seven stars are the
[1:20:31] angel messengers
[1:20:32] amen of the seven churches now we
[1:20:35] couldn't make a stake here on any
[1:20:36] account
[1:20:37] as he interprets it for us notice here
[1:20:39] brother brahm's not interpreting this
[1:20:41] but he's saying he that wrote it is here
[1:20:43] to interpret it
[1:20:46] he is interpreting it for us these seven
[1:20:49] stars
[1:20:50] are the messengers to the seven
[1:20:53] successive church ages
[1:20:54] they are not called by name they are
[1:20:56] just set forth at seven but one do we
[1:20:58] change
[1:20:59] from the ephesian age on down to this
[1:21:01] layout of sin age each messenger
[1:21:03] brought the message of truth to the
[1:21:05] people never failing to keep the word of
[1:21:07] god
[1:21:08] amen to that particular church h
[1:21:11] amen see each one held to it they were
[1:21:13] steadfast somebody
[1:21:14] somebody shot steadfast amen they were
[1:21:17] steadfast in their loyalty to the
[1:21:19] original lie
[1:21:20] notice here they were a light amen but
[1:21:23] notice where their light was coming from
[1:21:25] it was coming from the original light
[1:21:27] amen which who was the original
[1:21:29] which was christ which was like in the
[1:21:31] son of man
[1:21:32] in the uh are you hearing me tonight
[1:21:34] amen the whole purpose here
[1:21:36] is christ has got to be the master
[1:21:39] he has got to be the conductor he has
[1:21:41] got to be the architect
[1:21:43] he has got to be the superintendent or
[1:21:45] it will not
[1:21:46] stand their strength
[1:21:50] amen was from the lord or they could
[1:21:52] have never stemmed the tide
[1:21:54] they truly were yielded to him and kept
[1:21:56] by his omnipotence
[1:21:57] now notice here it's not hard amen now
[1:22:00] it's not hard to stand up
[1:22:02] and keep true to a creed it is easy for
[1:22:04] the devil is right behind all that
[1:22:06] but it is something else to be true to
[1:22:09] god's word
[1:22:10] and go back to what the word originally
[1:22:12] produced after pentecost
[1:22:14] see not only men said the roman catholic
[1:22:16] church had to be the true church how
[1:22:18] many has ever heard that
[1:22:20] he said now notice here they said it'd
[1:22:21] be the true church because all the
[1:22:23] things has been through all the changes
[1:22:25] he said and it's still going brother
[1:22:27] branham said any church
[1:22:28] with the government behind it and with
[1:22:31] its own creed
[1:22:32] which isn't the word at all and with no
[1:22:34] manifested ministry
[1:22:39] with no manifested ministry
[1:22:42] to cause the devil to get aroused could
[1:22:45] surely
[1:22:45] carry on see there's no mystery why that
[1:22:48] the roman catholic church is carried on
[1:22:51] because the government's been behind it
[1:22:53] amen politicians
[1:22:54] has come out of it are you hearing that
[1:22:56] amen all kinds of corruption is being
[1:22:58] amen laying right there brother matthew
[1:23:00] and the bed of that thing
[1:23:01] amen and it stemmed ever tied amen and
[1:23:03] the prophet of god capped it off
[1:23:05] and said another reason why amen there's
[1:23:07] been no persecution against it
[1:23:09] is because there's no manifested
[1:23:11] ministry what is a manifested ministry
[1:23:14] it is a ministry amen that christ gets a
[1:23:17] hold of
[1:23:18] and christ manifests himself through
[1:23:20] that ministry
[1:23:21] you tell me one time amen that christ
[1:23:24] has manifested himself to the pope
[1:23:26] but i'll tell you of another man by the
[1:23:28] name of william branham
[1:23:29] amen that for seven times around the
[1:23:31] world amen christ would meet him on the
[1:23:34] platform
[1:23:35] amen christ would meet him in the
[1:23:37] jungles of india
[1:23:38] christ would meet him in portland oregon
[1:23:41] christ
[1:23:41] wouldn't mean him right here in tucson
[1:23:43] arizona and would claim his body
[1:23:45] and would manifest himself through that
[1:23:48] ministry
[1:23:50] are you hearing me tonight amen this
[1:23:52] comfort is not for the seven church age
[1:23:54] messengers only
[1:23:55] but every true believer is in the hand
[1:23:57] of god
[1:23:58] and can draw from his loving power and
[1:24:00] receive the full benefit
[1:24:02] of all that god is to the believer
[1:24:06] what god gives the messenger and how he
[1:24:09] blesses and uses the messenger
[1:24:11] is an example to all believers of his
[1:24:13] goodness and care to all members of his
[1:24:16] body amen now what is his body the
[1:24:19] building
[1:24:20] see then we say paul was a wise master
[1:24:23] builder
[1:24:23] then can i say william branham by the
[1:24:26] same grace of god
[1:24:27] that was given paul was a wise master
[1:24:30] builder of that age
[1:24:31] was given brother branham to be a wise
[1:24:34] master builder of this age
[1:24:35] see he says on the angel amen of the
[1:24:38] church of the laodiceans right now
[1:24:40] i'm one that don't like to read
[1:24:41] scripture when i've got an
[1:24:42] interpretation on it and continue
[1:24:43] reading it in ignorance is that okay
[1:24:45] amen let me say it this way unto william
[1:24:48] mary and branham
[1:24:50] there's an angel there but let's put a
[1:24:52] name there
[1:24:54] is this okay amen there's no resistance
[1:24:57] to stand here and call billy graham's
[1:24:59] name
[1:24:59] there's no resistance to call oral
[1:25:01] roberts or but but call the prophet's
[1:25:03] name
[1:25:04] and every devil in hell raises up amen
[1:25:06] to try to shut that man up
[1:25:08] amen but there are some men in this last
[1:25:10] day that is anointed with the same
[1:25:12] spirit
[1:25:13] that was up on paul to withstand that
[1:25:15] persecution
[1:25:16] there is some men in the land today that
[1:25:18] will withstand
[1:25:19] every devil and will preach this message
[1:25:22] until every sickness is healed until
[1:25:24] ever demon is defeated
[1:25:26] until the power of god moves in the
[1:25:28] church again because we're not under
[1:25:30] another dispensation
[1:25:32] we're under our dispensation see under
[1:25:34] the angel
[1:25:35] under brother branham the church of our
[1:25:37] sins write these things said the amen
[1:25:38] the faithful and the true witness amen
[1:25:41] the beginning of the creation of god
[1:25:44] brother says we're not building an
[1:25:45] organization i'm not here this morning
[1:25:48] amen to build an organization christ
[1:25:49] never sent me amen to build an
[1:25:51] organization
[1:25:52] christ sent me a men to build
[1:25:54] individuals
[1:25:55] to the stature of jesus christ that they
[1:25:58] might be the powerhouse somebody shall
[1:26:00] powerhouse that they might be the
[1:26:04] powerhouse
[1:26:05] and the dwelling place of the spirit by
[1:26:08] his word by his word see what now know
[1:26:10] this year
[1:26:11] build up the individual to that place
[1:26:14] not the organization
[1:26:15] the individual amen now we're made up of
[1:26:17] light meters inside of us is cosmic
[1:26:19] light
[1:26:20] now that cosmic light is a light that
[1:26:22] they can take an x-ray with
[1:26:23] but the x-ray doesn't come from the
[1:26:25] x-ray light it comes from your own light
[1:26:28] and then if that cosmic light say could
[1:26:29] be pushed to a place where not cosmic
[1:26:31] light would eternal light
[1:26:32] god could dwell supremely amen to do our
[1:26:35] thinking
[1:26:36] to do our walking to do our talking then
[1:26:39] it's no longer the man
[1:26:41] it's god in the man are you hearing me
[1:26:44] tonight church
[1:26:45] amen then when the prophet said those
[1:26:47] seven angel messengers
[1:26:48] were drawing from the original light
[1:26:51] they were not drawing from cosmic light
[1:26:53] they were not drawings next to ray light
[1:26:55] they were drawing from
[1:26:56] eternal light and a prophet right here
[1:26:59] says if you push the cosmic light out of
[1:27:01] the way
[1:27:01] and the eternal light comes in then
[1:27:03] that's god in the man
[1:27:05] doing his thinking doing his talking
[1:27:07] doing his walking it's no longer the man
[1:27:10] it's god in the man doing the building
[1:27:14] see every building amen must have a
[1:27:16] foundation do you agree with that
[1:27:18] there are two types of foundations jesus
[1:27:21] spoke of those
[1:27:22] in matthew 7. he said there is one that
[1:27:24] is built upon a rock
[1:27:25] he said there is another one that is
[1:27:26] built upon the sand now isaiah 28 16
[1:27:30] if you can give me that verse i'd
[1:27:31] appreciate it isaiah 28 16
[1:27:33] the bible says therefore thus saith the
[1:27:37] lord god
[1:27:38] amen behold i lay in what
[1:27:42] behold i lay in zion amen for a
[1:27:45] foundation stone
[1:27:47] now what is zion a type of the prophet
[1:27:50] said the
[1:27:50] zion is a type of the bride so here
[1:27:54] isaiah prophesies
[1:27:55] and the lord says behold i lay in zion
[1:27:58] amen behold i put in zion amen a
[1:28:01] foundation stone
[1:28:02] which is a tried stone which is a
[1:28:05] precious cornerstone
[1:28:06] it is a sure foundation he that
[1:28:09] believeth shall not make haste
[1:28:11] amen leave that up there for me if you
[1:28:13] don't mind in saint john 6 53
[1:28:15] verily verily i say unto you except you
[1:28:17] eat the flesh of the son of man
[1:28:19] and drink his blood you have no life in
[1:28:21] you you realize that
[1:28:22] offended them and jesus picked it up and
[1:28:25] said do this offend you
[1:28:26] in verse 66 from that time many of his
[1:28:29] disciples went back
[1:28:33] and walked no more with him
[1:28:36] then said jesus unto the twelve will ye
[1:28:39] also go away
[1:28:43] but notice who speaks here then
[1:28:47] simon peter answered and said unto him
[1:28:50] lord to whom shall we go
[1:28:53] for thou hast the words of eternal life
[1:28:57] and we believe notice this next word
[1:29:00] and are sure
[1:29:04] we believe and are sure
[1:29:07] and what did the bible say i lay a sure
[1:29:10] foundation we believe and are sure
[1:29:13] amen that thou art that christ the son
[1:29:17] of the living god
[1:29:18] now you know brother picks this up into
[1:29:19] whom shall we go and says it this way
[1:29:21] he said there are seven things that we
[1:29:23] must come to jesus for
[1:29:25] he said the fourth is jesus is the only
[1:29:28] safe and secure foundation he said
[1:29:31] that's right
[1:29:32] a lot of people build upon riches what
[1:29:34] does it do it leads to slavery
[1:29:36] you become a slave to your money see
[1:29:38] there are jesus many penny heirs
[1:29:40] as there is millionaires will be in hell
[1:29:41] because it's your attitude towards it
[1:29:44] what god has given you now if you build
[1:29:45] it upon riches it'll fall
[1:29:48] can i tell you a few things if you can
[1:29:50] leave that there i appreciate it amen
[1:29:51] can i tell you a few things here that
[1:29:52] america's doing
[1:29:54] america right now is trying to build
[1:29:56] upon the foundation of popularity
[1:29:58] and then you look at young people they
[1:30:00] try to look and act like the television
[1:30:02] and the movie stars and the brother said
[1:30:04] what does it do it leads to a ruined
[1:30:06] life of chaos
[1:30:07] it stumbles of hay it stubbles of hay
[1:30:12] which will be burned at the judgment
[1:30:15] many people
[1:30:16] are building upon the foundation of
[1:30:18] education and the prophet says school
[1:30:20] is all right but it will never take the
[1:30:22] place of christ
[1:30:24] teenagers he says have gotten so rough
[1:30:27] till we can't even get teachers to try
[1:30:29] and teach them
[1:30:29] he said little oswald and let's run the
[1:30:32] teacher out of the building
[1:30:33] but we're talking about education he
[1:30:35] said but the trouble of it is
[1:30:36] we've tried to educate our pulpit
[1:30:41] and when we did we took the way out
[1:30:44] and christ is the foundation and that
[1:30:47] way
[1:30:48] we cannot build upon the foundation of
[1:30:50] political powers
[1:30:51] both parties are rotten he said the
[1:30:53] nation needs to build
[1:30:54] upon the foundation of jesus christ now
[1:30:57] one time the brain was arriving in new
[1:30:58] york with a friend of his
[1:30:59] and he's going through there and he sees
[1:31:01] this great big mammoth build them and he
[1:31:02] says now it's probably 50 or 60 stories
[1:31:04] high
[1:31:05] and i said well why didn't somebody move
[1:31:06] into it he said because come to find out
[1:31:09] the foundation wasn't right
[1:31:10] he said it had been laid upon some kind
[1:31:12] of soap stone not a real stone
[1:31:14] therefore the building was condemned and
[1:31:16] said it's only served for one thing
[1:31:18] that's for the contractor who built it
[1:31:20] to climb up to the top of it and jump
[1:31:22] off to commit suicide he said see no
[1:31:25] matter how good the outside looks
[1:31:26] there's not another foundation that's
[1:31:28] sure but the foundation of jesus christ
[1:31:32] he is the real foundation to be built
[1:31:34] upon
[1:31:35] amen revelation 3 17 says because thou
[1:31:37] sayest i am rich
[1:31:39] and increased with goods and have needed
[1:31:41] nothing and know us not that thou art
[1:31:42] wretched miserable poor and blind and
[1:31:44] naked the prophet said that word
[1:31:46] miserable there means pity
[1:31:47] he said they vault what they have but
[1:31:49] what they have will not stand
[1:31:51] amen the test of time they have built
[1:31:53] upon quicksand
[1:31:55] rather than the rock of revelation of
[1:31:57] god's word
[1:31:58] amen if you're going to build a building
[1:32:00] you've got to dig down
[1:32:01] and lay the right foundation that's why
[1:32:04] paul said
[1:32:05] for other foundation can no man lay then
[1:32:08] that is laid which is what
[1:32:10] which is jesus christ ephesians 2 20
[1:32:14] and are built upon the foundation of the
[1:32:16] apostles
[1:32:17] and the prophets and jesus christ
[1:32:19] himself being the chief cornerstone
[1:32:21] first timothy 6 19 laying up in store
[1:32:24] for themselves a good amen foundation
[1:32:27] against the time to come
[1:32:30] that they may hold that they may lay
[1:32:33] hold on eternal life
[1:32:34] another place in second timothy 2 19
[1:32:37] nevertheless
[1:32:38] the foundation of god standeth sure hey
[1:32:40] then somebody say sure
[1:32:42] having this seal that the lord knoweth
[1:32:45] him that are his
[1:32:46] let everyone that nameth the name of
[1:32:48] christ depart from iniquity
[1:32:50] what does that word sure mean brother
[1:32:52] sister it means strong
[1:32:54] it means firm it means immovable it
[1:32:57] means
[1:32:58] firm steadfast amen now notice here
[1:33:01] he said wherefore also it is contained
[1:33:02] in the scripture behold i lay in zion
[1:33:05] amen a chief cornerstone notice the word
[1:33:08] timothy or peter uses here
[1:33:10] elect amen he's going to lay in zion
[1:33:13] amen a chief cornerstone
[1:33:15] which is elect which is precious and he
[1:33:18] that believeth on him shall not be
[1:33:19] confounded
[1:33:20] therefore isaiah prophesied of it and
[1:33:23] said behold i lay in zion
[1:33:25] amen a sure foundation a tried stone
[1:33:28] a precious cornerstone and peter comes
[1:33:30] along
[1:33:31] and says an elect stone amen a precious
[1:33:34] stone
[1:33:34] and brother bram comes along and says
[1:33:36] because there's a new creation
[1:33:38] not a denomination you're a creation of
[1:33:41] the word
[1:33:42] why oh my because the foundation stone
[1:33:47] was laid in you before the foundation of
[1:33:51] the world
[1:33:53] predestinated to be the sons
[1:33:55] and daughters of god
[1:33:58] oh i'm trying to behave myself amen but
[1:34:01] what did timothy say
[1:34:02] timothy said he would lay in you a
[1:34:05] foundation stone against the time to
[1:34:07] come
[1:34:08] amen listen church jesus christ knew
[1:34:11] this time was coming
[1:34:12] he knew these troubles was coming he
[1:34:14] knew this virus was coming
[1:34:16] he knew pandemonium would break out in
[1:34:18] this nation he knew all about it
[1:34:20] amen and at the same time he knew you
[1:34:23] would be here
[1:34:24] he knew i would be here but he was not
[1:34:26] nervous
[1:34:27] he was not concerned that coronavirus
[1:34:29] would be what would shut the church out
[1:34:31] and what would take our victory
[1:34:33] and what would cause us to quit serving
[1:34:35] god
[1:34:36] because before you was born he laid in
[1:34:40] you
[1:34:40] a foundation stone which was a tried
[1:34:43] stone
[1:34:43] which was a precious stone oh i thank
[1:34:46] god tonight
[1:34:46] we ought to shout to the top of our
[1:34:48] voices satan you can't take me out
[1:34:51] i'm still here amen throw it you want
[1:34:53] you at me
[1:34:54] punch at me all you want to but before i
[1:34:56] was born
[1:34:57] god amen laid a stone in my heart
[1:35:01] against this day
[1:35:05] oh church my
[1:35:08] god in you he laid something
[1:35:11] that would not be shaken something
[1:35:15] that would not be destroyed he built you
[1:35:18] up on something of surety see that in
[1:35:21] order to build
[1:35:22] you have to have material to build with
[1:35:24] right
[1:35:25] now what is material material is the
[1:35:28] matter
[1:35:29] amen from which a thing is or can be
[1:35:31] made
[1:35:32] facts information or ideas for use
[1:35:36] in creating something
[1:35:41] now in first corinthians 3 12 now if any
[1:35:44] man
[1:35:45] build up on this foundation gold silver
[1:35:49] precious stones
[1:35:52] or wood hay stubble
[1:35:57] now do you realize permanent and
[1:35:59] valuable materials
[1:36:00] are materials that are not corruptable
[1:36:07] they do not deteriorate
[1:36:11] this stone has been in the church
[1:36:14] since before the foundation of the world
[1:36:18] and it's not corrupted one bit
[1:36:22] it's not deteriorated one bit see
[1:36:25] permanent materials last forever
[1:36:29] they are incorruptable they are
[1:36:31] undefiled
[1:36:32] they do not fade away and paul says
[1:36:36] that gold silver and precious stones
[1:36:39] are permanent materials then you go
[1:36:41] through the scriptures and you find
[1:36:42] examples
[1:36:43] of those permanent materials in
[1:36:45] galatians 5 the fruits of the spirit
[1:36:47] love joy peace long suffering gentleness
[1:36:49] goodness faith meekness and temperance
[1:36:51] in second peter 1
[1:36:52] you find the seven virtues faith virtue
[1:36:54] knowledge temperance patience goldenness
[1:36:56] brotherly kindness and charity
[1:36:58] in first peter 2 the souls and lives of
[1:37:01] believers
[1:37:01] who become living stones in the church
[1:37:04] amen that is that is permanent material
[1:37:07] to whom coming verse first peter 2 4 to
[1:37:10] whom coming as unto a living stone this
[1:37:11] allowed in need of men
[1:37:12] but chosen of god and precious amen i
[1:37:15] tell you this is a beautiful study
[1:37:17] amen to run it all the way from here
[1:37:19] amen in the bible and see that precious
[1:37:22] and sure is connected with that stone ye
[1:37:25] also as lively stones are built up
[1:37:28] somebody say built up
[1:37:30] you are built up amen a spiritual house
[1:37:32] and holy priesthood
[1:37:34] to offer up spiritual sacrifices
[1:37:36] acceptable to god by
[1:37:38] jesus christ not the same time that
[1:37:40] you've got permanent materials
[1:37:42] you've also got perishable materials at
[1:37:44] the same time
[1:37:46] there's a church being built out of
[1:37:48] permanent materials
[1:37:49] there is another group that's being
[1:37:51] built out of perishable materials
[1:37:52] and paul likens that to wood amen to hay
[1:37:56] and to stubble as perishable materials
[1:37:58] amen let me tell you some of those an
[1:38:00] example in the scriptures
[1:38:01] treasures amen wealth and cares of this
[1:38:04] world
[1:38:04] are perishable materials galatians 5
[1:38:07] amen the works of the flesh are
[1:38:10] perishable materials
[1:38:11] colossians 2 amen the false teachings of
[1:38:14] the scriptures
[1:38:15] are perishable materials but god in this
[1:38:18] middle of all that
[1:38:21] in the middle of all of that god is
[1:38:23] building a bride
[1:38:25] that is not out of perishable materials
[1:38:27] but it's out of
[1:38:28] permanent material the prophet said god
[1:38:32] is building somebody say god is building
[1:38:35] in
[1:38:35] in seven ages a bride
[1:38:38] for christ through the philadelphian
[1:38:42] through the thytiran through the
[1:38:44] pergamus through the sumernian to the
[1:38:46] ephesus
[1:38:47] another place he says we know i love
[1:38:49] this we know there's going to be a bride
[1:38:53] we know that and there's going to be a
[1:38:55] wedding supper served in the skies
[1:38:57] that's just as sure to be here's that
[1:38:59] word again
[1:39:00] amen just as sure to be as god is
[1:39:03] because it's his word and we know that
[1:39:06] those that are going to make up that
[1:39:08] bride
[1:39:09] is going to be his church and they have
[1:39:12] the material on the earth now to make
[1:39:14] themselves ready
[1:39:17] now a natural carpenter comes along and
[1:39:20] you know what he'll do brother sister
[1:39:21] he'll tell you how to build your natural
[1:39:23] house but the prophet says
[1:39:25] i'm going to tell you how to build your
[1:39:27] spiritual house
[1:39:28] where god can dwell he wants to dwell in
[1:39:31] you

[1:39:50] that the foundation stone has been laid
[1:39:53] in
[1:39:54] then there are two bodies there is a
[1:39:56] human body
[1:39:57] and there is a spiritual body now the

[1:40:02] which is calcium

[1:40:07] but the spiritual body is made up of
[1:40:09] three elements

[1:40:16] are perishable items
[1:40:17] or perishable materials amen that the

[1:40:21] but the spiritual body is made up of
[1:40:23] three elements which is water

[1:40:28] elements that came from his body
[1:40:30] is somebody say is is what
[1:40:34] makes his body see it comes from his
[1:40:36] body

[1:46:50] i've come to grips this is my death it's

[1:47:17] again give me a rock i'm not born to die
[1:47:20] i'm born to fight are you seeing what
[1:47:22] i'm talking about there's some people
[1:47:24] here

[1:47:29] oh glory to god amen can i bring that
[1:47:32] right here
[1:47:32] i don't know many of y'all here tonight
[1:47:34] but i'll say this there's people here
[1:47:36] tonight
[1:47:36] that the devil's been waiting on you to
[1:47:38] quit he's been waiting on you to give up
[1:47:40] he's been waiting on you to say well
[1:47:41] this is the end but something in you
[1:47:46] something in you begins to move
[1:47:48] something in you
[1:47:49] begins to feel a wind something in you
[1:47:52] begins to feel a charge
[1:47:53] what is it church it's the material
[1:47:56] you're made out of
[1:47:59] this bride is not handmade
[1:48:02] she's not handmade she's not theologia
[1:48:05] she's not hatched out of some seminary
[1:48:08] she
[1:48:09] is a spoken word bride
[1:48:12] are you hearing me she is a spoken word
[1:48:15] bride
[1:48:16] amen second corinthians 5 17 says
[1:48:18] therefore if any man be in
[1:48:20] christ who is christ the master
[1:48:23] if any man be in christ he is a new
[1:48:26] creature
[1:48:27] all things are passed away and behold
[1:48:30] all things are become new
[1:48:31] brother andrew what does that word
[1:48:33] creature mean it means creation
[1:48:35] it means building glory
[1:48:39] he is a new building amen a new
[1:48:43] establishment
[1:48:44] amen the building of individuals the
[1:48:46] prophet said here it is
[1:48:47] amen kind of an evolution rising higher
[1:48:50] he is creating his bride
[1:48:52] but you see this bride is not going to
[1:48:54] be made up of just what little group
[1:48:55] show on earth now
[1:48:56] when the seventh when the seventh watch
[1:48:58] when he came all those virgins raised
[1:48:59] trim their lamps
[1:49:00] all the way back everyone that believed
[1:49:05] the anointed word down through the h
[1:49:07] come forth like the pyramid
[1:49:11] he says the bottom part
[1:49:15] but the headstone had to come
[1:49:19] to pick the whole thing up to make it a
[1:49:21] pyramid
[1:49:23] see put it together
[1:49:29] this is the bride
[1:49:32] building of christ
[1:49:36] this is the body
[1:49:39] to receive the head
[1:49:42] the bridegroom
[1:49:46] things that are to be now these are
[1:49:47] attributes of god we cannot live by
[1:49:49] creeds we cannot live by
[1:49:50] denominationalism we must live by the
[1:49:51] word
[1:49:54] because the bride is a part of the
[1:49:56] bridegroom
[1:49:57] like any wife is a part of her husband
[1:50:00] therefore we must be that word bride
[1:50:02] and what is that word bride the
[1:50:04] manifestation of this
[1:50:06] hour the bride
[1:50:09] not a creed or a denomination but a
[1:50:12] living oracle of god
[1:50:14] a living attribute of god displaying to
[1:50:17] the world
[1:50:18] the attributes of god in the formation
[1:50:21] of the bride that's to be expressed
[1:50:25] in this hour that we're now living
[1:50:27] believing god 52
[1:50:28] you get you got a soul beside your
[1:50:30] senses god never give you those senses
[1:50:32] to trust him with
[1:50:33] then you can believe the impossible
[1:50:35] things because you're made up
[1:50:37] of the miracle working god
[1:50:41] i pray this is helping you tonight
[1:50:44] remember it says here in perfect faith i
[1:50:46] mean substance faith
[1:50:47] now speaking here he is isolated from
[1:50:49] the entire world
[1:50:50] and becomes a new creature becomes
[1:50:54] a new building in christ see
[1:50:57] there now you're getting into bright
[1:51:00] material
[1:51:03] but andrew what do you say and i'll tell
[1:51:04] you what i'm saying god
[1:51:07] wants a time tested church
[1:51:14] you know what really proves
[1:51:17] a building
[1:51:20] time
[1:51:25] time a contractor could build that
[1:51:29] building
[1:51:31] get his check and walk away and you
[1:51:33] could get 500 men together
[1:51:35] and get them all circled around that
[1:51:37] building and get them to put all their
[1:51:38] pressure
[1:51:39] and try to push that thing down and
[1:51:42] it'll stand right there
[1:51:45] and that contract will say see i did a
[1:51:46] good job
[1:51:50] but give that thing 20 years
[1:51:53] and nobody pushing on it and it
[1:51:55] collapses
[1:51:57] are you hearing me only time
[1:52:01] proves a building
[1:52:04] the bible says in the time tests
[1:52:06] memorials of god and jesus christ
[1:52:08] came from heaven the glory
[1:52:12] from glory down here to build a church
[1:52:15] and the material that he's putting in it
[1:52:17] is time

[1:57:30] brother matthew put your name there
[1:57:31] amen everybody put your name there and
[1:57:34] say devil see
[1:57:35] i'm still here the wind didn't get me
[1:57:39] the storm didn't break me the trouble
[1:57:41] didn't discourage me
[1:57:42] i'm built upon a rock that the very
[1:57:45] gates of hell
[1:57:46] shall not prevail against it
[1:57:51] what is it it's a revelation what is
[1:57:53] faith is god by the spirit revealing to
[1:57:55] you is something that he's going to do
[1:57:56] or he's promised
[1:57:57] now if you only hear faith cometh by
[1:57:59] hearing but hearing is not faith
[1:58:01] a loaf of bread is purchased for 25
[1:58:03] cents but 25 cents is not the loaf of
[1:58:05] bread see
[1:58:06] hearing only brings the word
[1:58:10] that produces faith but faith
[1:58:16] is the substance of things hoped for the
[1:58:19] evidence of thanks not seen
[1:58:21] then you see you hear the word god
[1:58:23] reveals it to you
[1:58:25] that it's the truth and by spirit
[1:58:27] revealed truth confirms your faith to
[1:58:29] god
[1:58:29] you get it now notice then that's the
[1:58:32] church
[1:58:32] that god built upon the rock that the
[1:58:35] gates of hell will never
[1:58:37] prevail against it
[1:58:41] as musicians come tonight
[1:58:44] how many remembers me saying that there
[1:58:46] were many boats
[1:58:49] in the days of noah
[1:58:53] but there was only one
[1:58:56] god constructed boat
[1:59:03] just as there was many boats in the days
[1:59:05] of noah
[1:59:07] there are many churches and brides today
[1:59:13] there's been churches churches brides
[1:59:15] brides
[1:59:17] churches brides brides churches bride's
[1:59:19] brides
[1:59:20] churches brides churches churches brides
[1:59:22] brides
[1:59:23] but there's got to come one
[1:59:28] hallelujah there has to come a real
[1:59:31] bride
[1:59:31] there must come one that's not only got
[1:59:34] the mechanics
[1:59:35] but the dynamics of it that makes that
[1:59:38] church live
[1:59:39] and move in the power of his
[1:59:42] resurrection
[1:59:46] then testing time will come and only the
[1:59:50] god
[1:59:50] constructed church will pass
[1:59:54] the test
[1:59:58] oh there's too many here to read can i
[2:00:00] read one more
[2:00:02] that's what too many is doing today
[2:00:04] trying to float through on a popular log
[2:00:05] but we find out it sunk
[2:00:06] and they thought they could build a boat
[2:00:07] and it would be all right but their
[2:00:09] boats went down
[2:00:10] that's what you think today that we can
[2:00:11] build an organization or educate a bunch
[2:00:13] of people into it it'll go anyhow
[2:00:14] whether it's god constructed or not
[2:00:16] but the only thing that'll pass the test
[2:00:19] is a god-constructed church by the word
[2:00:23] filled with the holy ghost got to be god
[2:00:27] constructed and god inspired
[2:00:35] how many say tonight lord tear down
[2:00:38] every board on this building
[2:00:41] that's not bible material
[2:00:45] tear down every board
[2:00:49] that's not holy ghost material
[2:00:54] let the inspector come in tonight
[2:00:59] let the inspector inspect the building
[2:01:05] let him go through and see what kind of
[2:01:06] materials in it
[2:01:09] let him check and see if there's any
[2:01:11] false teachings in it
[2:01:15] let him check and see if there's any hay
[2:01:18] or stubble
[2:01:21] let him check and see if there's any
[2:01:23] works of the flesh
[2:01:26] in that building tonight
[2:01:29] [Music]
[2:01:31] because if there is there's a storm
[2:01:34] coming
[2:01:36] that'll hit that building and if it's
[2:01:39] not god constructed
[2:01:42] it'll fall apart
[2:01:49] how many how many ministries have we
[2:01:50] seen around this message
[2:01:53] build out a perishable materials
[2:01:57] might have could breach like a house on
[2:01:58] fire
[2:02:00] but a storm hit it
[2:02:04] down it came how many churches have we
[2:02:08] seen
[2:02:09] oh this is it this is the church and a
[2:02:12] storm hit it
[2:02:18] he said andrew you're getting pretty
[2:02:20] pretty discouraged no i'm not
[2:02:23] i'm telling you what a prophet said he
[2:02:26] said we're going to sail
[2:02:27] through treacherous waters
[2:02:30] he said we're already selling through
[2:02:32] them now
[2:02:34] christ revealing his own word 65 we're
[2:02:36] already selling through them now
[2:02:39] he said but here's the good thing about
[2:02:40] it the stabilizers
[2:02:45] the stabilizers are already on the boat
[2:02:48] the stabilizers are already on the
[2:02:50] church
[2:02:52] that church she spoke about already come
[2:02:54] into existence
[2:02:56] she's still here she's still standing
[2:03:02] how many wants to testify to the devil
[2:03:04] tonight
[2:03:06] i want you to stand up to your feet and
[2:03:07] say devil i'm still here
[2:03:10] after all i've been through i'm still
[2:03:12] here
[2:03:14] after all the troubles and all the
[2:03:15] storms and all the hurts and losses and
[2:03:17] disappointments and sicknesses and
[2:03:19] sorrows and
[2:03:20] deaths we just still stand here as a
[2:03:25] [Music]
[2:03:27] a testimony built out of god's material
[2:03:33] if you're here tonight and you're not
[2:03:36] built out of the material of god
[2:03:38] i encourage you tonight pressure's
[2:03:42] coming
[2:03:44] the pressure test is coming
[2:03:48] says it this way he says anyone a
[2:03:51] chemist anyone else will always test
[2:03:53] something
[2:03:54] i used to work for a gas company and
[2:03:55] they'd test those pipes
[2:03:57] by putting a plug in the end and a valve
[2:03:59] and i don't remember now just how many
[2:04:01] hundreds of pounds of pressure
[2:04:02] they had put on them pipes to see if
[2:04:05] there's a little
[2:04:06] sand hole that would blow
[2:04:11] do you see how close this has got to be
[2:04:14] how how big is a grain of sand
[2:04:17] can't even hardly see it but if there's
[2:04:19] a bit of a grain of sand hole
[2:04:22] it'll blow apart and if they could not
[2:04:25] stand the test
[2:04:27] then it was thrown into scrap heap and
[2:04:30] when you're put
[2:04:30] under a test anybody here tonight under
[2:04:32] a test
[2:04:36] glory when you're put under a test
[2:04:39] when you're fixing to be people out
[2:04:42] there maybe you're christians
[2:04:43] and wonder why you're put under this
[2:04:46] test
[2:04:47] god is fixing to use your testimony
[2:04:52] but he wants to see how you'll react
[2:04:55] so he puts the pressure on if you blow
[2:04:58] up
[2:04:59] well then he can't do nothing with you
[2:05:01] but if you'll hold on
[2:05:05] and stand the test
[2:05:08] [Music]
[2:05:12] i wish i could say tonight to you that
[2:05:14] [Music]
[2:05:17] it's going to get easier
[2:05:20] brother matthew i'd be lying to you
[2:05:24] i wish i could tell you tonight that
[2:05:27] things are going to get better
[2:05:29] trials are going to get less but i'd be
[2:05:32] lying to you
[2:05:35] but can i tell you this he's proven you
[2:05:38] [Music]
[2:05:40] every trial every test
[2:05:44] every storm he's proven you
[2:05:48] to come out on the other side
[2:05:52] to stand to stand
[2:05:55] as a witness what are you playing here
[2:06:00] you later snap brother

[2:06:36] the pressure
[2:06:38] tear it down
[2:06:42] refilled me to not
[2:06:45] [Music]
[2:06:57] maybe you don't know the reality of this
[2:07:00] message like you need to
[2:07:03] he can give you the reality of it

[2:08:56] at the end of the service i just began
[2:08:59] to call some
[2:09:01] people out in the service not in

[2:09:04] you may know out here brother kenneth

[2:09:08] traveled many years i said brother
[2:09:09] brother walker how many years you've
[2:09:11] been on the field brother
[2:09:12] i think he said 30 40 50 years something
[2:09:15] like that traveling preaching
[2:09:17] i said why are you still here today
[2:09:20] because you're made out of god material
[2:09:23] ask our deacons in the back i said
[2:09:25] brother how long have you been a deacon
[2:09:26] how long you been a deacon
[2:09:28] i said why why are you still here
[2:09:31] because you've been god constructed ask
[2:09:34] our musicians and i'll ask these tonight
[2:09:37] why are you still here god built you
[2:09:42] holy ghost material makes holy ghost
[2:09:45] musicians

[2:09:55] holy ghost tonight i encourage you to
[2:09:57] get it

[2:10:15] your grace
[2:10:17] lord we thank you for the spirit of
[2:10:19] faith and
[2:10:21] lord the grace that you've given us in
[2:10:22] this hour
[2:10:25] lord you know us well as i know lord at
[2:10:28] times i'll
[2:10:29] go out to my office and just sit there
[2:10:31] and
[2:10:33] just listen to a tape or reading or just
[2:10:36] studying along
[2:10:37] in the mornings or in the afternoons
[2:10:41] lord i'll just sit there and begin to
[2:10:42] think about the churches and the people
[2:10:45] that i've been privileged to preach to
[2:10:48] and lord i realize that i'm not just
[2:10:49] standing there before
[2:10:52] church members and religious people
[2:10:56] but lord i think about how i'm standing
[2:10:57] before people that's been through tests
[2:10:59] and
[2:11:00] hurts and disappointments and losses
[2:11:04] lord i'm speaking to people that have
[2:11:06] ever right
[2:11:08] and every excuse they could come up with
[2:11:11] not to be serving you today not to be
[2:11:14] still pressing the battle
[2:11:17] but lord then i realize i'm speaking to
[2:11:18] people that i believe would testify
[2:11:21] their best day serving the devil
[2:11:25] cannot even compare to their worst day
[2:11:27] serving the lord
[2:11:29] the the best day they had serving the
[2:11:32] devil
[2:11:33] could not beat cannot come near the
[2:11:36] worst that they had serving you
[2:11:39] for lord i would rather have struggles
[2:11:42] and trials
[2:11:44] and be serving you than everything going
[2:11:47] well
[2:11:48] and be serving the devil lord i believe
[2:11:51] that's the testimony of this people
[2:11:53] tonight

[2:11:57] this church

[2:12:00] through father you see the struggles and
[2:12:03] the difficulties they've been through
[2:12:06] but lord here they stand tonight as a
[2:12:08] testimony

[2:12:17] lord things they've been through
[2:12:19] perishable materials

[2:12:23] done fallen apart
[2:12:25] oh how satan must hate this body of
[2:12:28] believers here
[2:12:30] because there's permanent materials here
[2:12:33] that no matter how much pressure is put
[2:12:36] upon them
