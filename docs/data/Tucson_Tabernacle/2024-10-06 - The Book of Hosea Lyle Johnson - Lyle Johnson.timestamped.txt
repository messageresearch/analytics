[23:34] us some more we thank you we thank you
[23:37] Lord Jesus
[23:43] amen I was going to ask you to sit down
[23:45] but I see you've already taken that so
[23:48] but I can't let this opportunity
[23:52] pass regarding this Feast it ties in so
[23:55] perfectly with the message of the book
[23:57] of Hosea that we'll be reviewing
[24:01] tonight Feast of
[24:04] trumpets Feast of trumpets what is the
[24:09] trumpet a
[24:11] chofar a chofar what is a chofar a
[24:14] chofar is is a horn from a from a kosher
[24:18] animal that the marrow has been pulled
[24:20] out and it's used and when the when the
[24:23] chofar is blown it's always blown either
[24:25] Straight Ahead or to the right never to
[24:27] the left
[24:28] remember in the New Testament judgment
[24:31] Jesus those that were on the right hand
[24:33] the hand of Mercy the hand of Grace the
[24:36] hand of Love they made it in the ones on
[24:39] the left not so much so when the chofar
[24:42] is blown it's always blown to the right
[24:44] I'm not very good at this I practiced a
[24:47] little bit today and Louie our dog got
[24:49] very upset with me
[24:53] [Music]
[24:58] if anybody is good at this my
[25:04] apologies Feast of trumpets from the IM
[25:07] Israel website I just like to read this
[25:10] little bit the Feast of trumpets known
[25:12] as yum
[25:14] turu is a festival which revolves around
[25:17] hearing the blast of the chofar
[25:19] connecting with God and repentance this
[25:22] day is also commonly called rosha Shana
[25:25] the head of the
[25:26] year of all the feasts
[25:29] the Feast of trumpets is the most
[25:32] concealed and shrouded in mystery
[25:35] whereas the other festivals commemorate
[25:37] an event from Israel's history or have
[25:39] specific religious purposes around them
[25:42] God's people were not told the reason to
[25:44] celebrate yum T Rua in the scriptures
[25:48] they were simply told to gather together
[25:51] and blow the
[25:52] chaar but the sound of the chaar when
[25:55] it's done by someone better than I
[25:57] elevates the hearts of men and women
[25:59] with the sense that the king is coming
[26:03] the most prominent activity of this day
[26:05] is the blowing of the chofar the
[26:07] ramshorn there are over 100 chofar
[26:10] blasts heard throughout the prayer
[26:11] services culminating with a final blast
[26:14] being known as the last Trump this Regal
[26:17] sound is a call to repentance that
[26:20] reaches the souls of all who hear with
[26:22] each blast denoting a sense of Spiritual
[26:27] Awakening but based on biblical Clues
[26:29] and ancient tradition Jews believed that
[26:32] God breathed life into Adam on this day
[26:36] in the days of the Bible this was a date
[26:38] on the calendar when the Kings of Israel
[26:40] were crowned and took the
[26:42] throne the resurrection of the dead and
[26:44] complete in gathering of Israel are also
[26:47] tied to the Feast of
[26:49] trumpets and Jewish Tradition at least
[26:52] today the Jewish people see yum as the
[26:56] day when the bridegroom will will return
[26:59] for his
[27:00] bride the prophets foretold Joel to from
[27:04] the complete Jewish Bible blow the
[27:06] chofar in seon proclaim a holy fast call
[27:10] for a solemn assembly gather the people
[27:13] consecrate the congregation assemble the
[27:15] leaders gather the children even infants
[27:18] that are nursing let the bridegroom
[27:20] leave his room and the bride the bridal
[27:24] chamber Christians see the biblical holy
[27:27] days as foreshadows of the work of the
[27:28] Messiah what he has accomplished and
[27:31] what he will accomplish in the future
[27:33] while the spring feasts Passover and so
[27:35] forth look back at yeshua's first coming
[27:38] the fall feasts look forward to his
[27:41] second
[27:42] coming after Pentecost there's a long
[27:45] summer break before the next biblical
[27:48] appointed time this is prophetic for the
[27:50] time in which we live now since
[27:53] messiah's atonement this long period of
[27:56] time will suddenly come to an end when
[27:59] the blast of the trumpet
[28:01] sounds followers of Jesus see yum as the
[28:05] future day when the last Trump will
[28:07] sound Yeshua will again set his feet on
[28:10] this Earth the faithful will be
[28:11] resurrected and the long awaited king of
[28:13] Israel will sit on the throne of his
[28:16] father
[28:17] David in 1 Thessalonians 4 we read for
[28:21] the Lord himself shall descend from
[28:24] heaven with a shout with a voice of the
[28:26] Archangel and with a chaar of God and
[28:30] the dead in Christ shall rise first then
[28:33] when we we which are alive and remain
[28:35] should be caught up together with them
[28:37] in the clouds to meet the Lord in the
[28:38] air and so shall we ever be with the
[28:42] Lord the Feast of trumpets is also
[28:45] called yum hesha the hidden day because
[28:49] it's the only holy day designated by the
[28:53] Lord to be kept on the new moon and
[28:57] ancient Israel citing the small sliver
[29:00] of the new moon could be challenging and
[29:02] unpredictable unlike the other feast
[29:05] days no one could precisely calculate
[29:07] the exact day or hour the festival could
[29:10] begin that's why even today two days are
[29:14] reserved for the feast in case the moon
[29:16] isn't visible on the first
[29:18] night when the disciples asked Jesus
[29:20] what will be the sign of his coming he
[29:22] told them of that day and hour no one
[29:24] knows not even the angels of Heaven nor
[29:26] the son except the father alone Matthew
[29:29] 24 this saying is one of the reasons why
[29:32] some Believers connect the Feast of
[29:34] trumpets with
[29:36] yeshua's
[29:39] [Music]
[29:47] return let's stand

[31:45] Soul thank you so
[31:51] much praise the lord it's Shai it's the
[31:55] Feast of trumpets I just couldn't let
[31:58] this night pass it's October 2nd it is
[32:00] the night the sun just went down this is
[32:03] the
[32:03] start back to the book of Hosea or
[32:06] actually not back but
[32:08] forward this
[32:10] evening as we continue our series on the
[32:12] books of the Bible our portion is the
[32:14] book of
[32:15] Hosea the content of Hosea is
[32:19] shocking yet
[32:22] comforting in our Christian Bible Hosea
[32:26] is the first of the 12 books of what we
[32:28] call the Minor Prophets The Final
[32:30] section of our Old Testament minor just
[32:33] means that although they left us written
[32:35] prophecies the the length of each
[32:37] preserved writing is much less than that
[32:39] of any of the Major Prophets like Isaiah
[32:41] or Jeremiah or
[32:43] Ezekiel while we don't know the exact
[32:46] years when Hosea wrote and prophesied we
[32:49] do know that his ministry was
[32:51] contemporary with Isaiah Micah and
[32:56] Amos hosea's marriage life directed by
[33:00] the Lord was intended to shock to secure
[33:03] the attention of the people and to
[33:07] illustrate how God perceived their
[33:10] conduct and demonstrate his love
[33:14] compassion and
[33:16] mercy the attributes we associate with
[33:19] Jesus of the New Testament are clearly
[33:21] declared and the Prophecies of
[33:23] Hosea you may already realize it but one
[33:27] prophecy of Hosea reference in the
[33:29] gospels does not appear to be a prophecy
[33:32] at all that's probably a good place to
[33:35] read for our opening verses Hosea 11 the
[33:38] first two verses it's the Lord speaking
[33:41] when Israel was a child then I loved him
[33:45] singular speaking of the nation and
[33:47] called my son out of Egypt and now
[33:50] speaking to the people as they called
[33:53] them the more the prophets spoke to the
[33:56] people so the more they
[33:58] the people went from them from the
[34:00] prophets and their calls for repentance
[34:03] and righteousness they sacrificed unto
[34:05] balim and burned incense to graven
[34:10] images yet this recitation of the
[34:13] history of the Hebrew nation is also a
[34:17] prophecy about Jesus turn with pet to
[34:20] Matthew Chapter two The the context here
[34:24] is that the Magi traditionally linked to
[34:27] Daniel which we just studied have seen a
[34:30] Heavenly sign while they were in the
[34:32] East and have come to the Roman province
[34:34] of Judea looking for the young child
[34:37] born to be King Herod the Great called
[34:41] them told them to search find the child
[34:43] and report back to him but they left the
[34:46] province after finding Jesus without
[34:50] telling
[34:52] Herod and when the Magi were
[34:55] departed behold
[34:58] the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph
[35:00] in a dream saying arise wake up get up
[35:04] take the young child and his mother and
[35:06] flee run for your lives Don't Walk Don't
[35:09] Wait flee into Egypt and stay there
[35:13] until I bring the word for Herod will
[35:15] seek the young child to destroy
[35:19] him so Joseph no no Joseph arose he took
[35:24] the young child and his mother by night
[35:27] that very every night this was a serious
[35:30] warning he loved his family absolutely
[35:33] trusted what the Lord had told him and
[35:36] departed into Egypt recall that they
[35:38] couldn't afford the the the good
[35:40] offering for the sanctification when
[35:42] Jesus was born so they offered the doves
[35:43] because they were so poor but now the
[35:46] Magi have left them gold now they have
[35:48] the funds they need just at the right
[35:51] time they need those funds to escape to
[35:53] go to Egypt and to stay there as long as
[35:56] they need to stay there God always
[35:58] provides he always works at both ends he
[36:01] brings it about and the family was there
[36:04] in Egypt until the death of Herod the
[36:06] Great that it might be fulfilled which
[36:08] was spoken of the Lord by the prophet
[36:12] saying out of Egypt have I called my
[36:16] son it was a prophecy please be
[36:20] seated we we just read that referenced
[36:23] prophecy and found it was in the book of
[36:25] Hosea we'll touch on this again but but
[36:28] first you're probably asking who was
[36:32] Hosea when did he
[36:35] Minister what do we know about
[36:40] him Hosea
[36:42] 1:1 the word of the Lord that came unto
[36:46] Hosea the son of beri in the days of
[36:49] Uzziah yam ahaz and Hezekiah Kings of
[36:54] Judah and in the days of jeroboam son of
[36:58] joash king of Israel and by the way for
[37:02] the young people there were some quizzes
[37:03] in the back be sure you've got that it
[37:05] might help you stay
[37:07] awake in fact if you see me falling
[37:09] asleep if you could bring me one at that
[37:11] point then I'll stay awake
[37:13] too so take a look at this who were the
[37:18] Kings during hosea's time so from the
[37:21] opening verse we learn that
[37:24] Hosea anyone know what Hosea means
[37:29] salvation Hosea prophesied in the mid
[37:32] 700s BC you see that in the don't look
[37:36] at the laser L you see that here in the
[37:40] middle since one king of Israel is named
[37:43] but Four Kings of Judah we ascertain he
[37:45] prophesied to and probably in Israel at
[37:47] least at the beginning of his ministry
[37:49] but ended it in
[37:51] Judah so the Israeli King that is
[37:54] mentioned is on your left
[37:58] jeroboam II and the Kings Uzziah yam
[38:02] ahaz and Hezekiah Kings of Judah are
[38:05] listed on the other side and you can see
[38:06] that right in the middle of all this is
[38:08] the Assyrian captivity where the 10
[38:10] tribes are
[38:13] exiled so his ministry included the time
[38:16] of the Assyrian conquest of the northern
[38:18] kingdom we don't know from which tribe
[38:20] Hosea descended we know nothing of his
[38:23] father except that Barry was his
[38:24] father's name my last name Johnson
[38:28] with in other cultures and eras inform
[38:30] you that my father's name was John
[38:32] except it wasn't it was Reynold so Hosea
[38:35] would have been Hosea Ben ble or Hosea
[38:39] Bary it's a cultural
[38:41] convention before we dig into the book
[38:44] let's look at an overview of its
[38:49] topics these are the major sort of
[38:51] headline topics that I found in one of
[38:53] my
[38:54] Bibles we'll touch on each of these as
[38:56] we proceed through the 14 chapters of
[38:59] the book I need to tell you in
[39:02] advance that what the Lord required of
[39:04] Hosea is
[39:07] shocking and there's some pretty plain
[39:09] language in its
[39:12] descriptions I also want to point out
[39:14] that many of you this book is nothing
[39:15] but Doom and Gloom I indicated the
[39:19] topics that lead to this perspective by
[39:20] highlighting them in read as you can
[39:23] easily see the majority of the book is
[39:25] about accusation and judgment by God due
[39:28] to the people's continual willful
[39:31] Disobedience and especially their
[39:34] unfaithfulness toward the lord yet
[39:37] scattered among these are topics that
[39:39] indicate Love and Hope and Redemption
[39:42] highlighted in gold and even the topics
[39:45] coded in red there are pleas and
[39:47] Promises related to repentance and hope
[39:52] Hosea is in fact an amazing affirmation
[39:56] of God love and grace and compassion for
[40:01] his rebellious and sinful
[40:04] people the two topics left in white deal
[40:07] with hosea's actions as As We Begin The
[40:10] Narrative portion of the book consider
[40:13] that Hosea represented the Lord God and
[40:17] his wife represented the descendants of
[40:20] Jacob called
[40:25] Israel this is made clear in verse
[40:30] two we begin with the story of hosea's
[40:32] marriage his three children and what
[40:36] they represent let's read now from
[40:38] chapter 1 verse two the beginning of the
[40:40] word of the Lord by
[40:42] Hosea the Lord said to Hosea go take
[40:47] unto thee a wife of whoredoms and
[40:48] children of whoredoms for the land hath
[40:50] committed great H whoredom departing
[40:53] from the
[40:54] Lord
[40:55] what Hosea is to marry a woman who is
[41:00] Unfaithful and this is by command of the
[41:04] Lord the Old Testament uses this word
[41:08] Edom to describe faithlessness toward
[41:11] God it compares the the faithful sexual
[41:14] relationship between husband and wife
[41:15] with the worship of the Lord not
[41:18] replaced by or in concert with the
[41:20] worship of any other God or gods in our
[41:25] time we use a similar compar
[41:28] speaking of the Bride As the Christians
[41:31] faithful to and solely to the Lord not
[41:33] mixed with worship of Idols relics icons
[41:37] Saints prophets Ministries and the like
[41:39] this is at least part of the reason that
[41:42] sexual immorality was so harshly judged
[41:44] and condemned under the law why a person
[41:47] can be a
[41:48] murderer and repent and become or remain
[41:51] a
[41:52] minister but one who is unfaithful to
[41:55] his marriage cannot
[42:00] verse three so Hosea went and took
[42:03] Goomer the daughter of deim this again
[42:06] is a naming convention so she was Gob
[42:09] deim which conceived and beam a
[42:13] son and the Lord said unto Hosea call
[42:16] his name Jezreel for yet a little while
[42:20] and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel
[42:22] upon the house of juu and will cause to
[42:24] Cease the kingdom of the House of Israel
[42:27] and it shall come to pass at that day
[42:29] that I will break the bow of Israel in
[42:32] the valley of
[42:35] Jezreel Jezreel means God will seow like
[42:40] a farmer not like a seamstress or God
[42:42] will
[42:43] plant but here the Lord isn't
[42:45] emphasizing the
[42:48] meaning this slide shows the valley of
[42:50] jezrael and its location in
[42:53] Israel please notice the markers I
[42:56] placed on the map this is in Northern
[42:58] Israel all the activity with Hezbollah
[43:00] right now is taking place uh about at
[43:03] the very top of the screen not the
[43:04] screen that's displayed with the
[43:06] physical screen the bottom of those
[43:08] curtains so this is in the northern
[43:10] portion of Israel Jerusalem on this map
[43:13] would
[43:14] be Jerusalem's probably right about here
[43:17] in this map can you see see the Temple's
[43:20] right there
[43:24] okay so the markers I put on on them at
[43:27] the the red oval circles the valley of
[43:30] Jezreel you can see it Southwest of the
[43:32] Sea of Galilee the arrow labeled with a
[43:35] numeral one points to the location of
[43:37] Nazareth where Jesus was raised and you
[43:41] can see where the local population
[43:42] wanted to throw him down from a cliff it
[43:44] would have been into the valley of
[43:48] Jezreel Arrow 2 points to the town of
[43:51] jezrael where Ahab and Jezebel lived
[43:54] where nebo's Vineyard was located you
[43:56] remember the story of The Vineyard Arrow
[44:00] three points to a town called
[44:02] megiddo and that suggests the other name
[44:05] for the valley of jezrael which you may
[44:07] be more familiar
[44:11] Armageddon the avenging of the blood of
[44:13] Jezreel upon the house of juu refers to
[44:15] the events of 2 Kings 10 where Elisha
[44:18] sent his Messenger to anoint juu King
[44:20] and J who then extracted Vengeance on
[44:22] Jezebel and others in 2 Kings 10:11 J
[44:26] who killed all who remained of the House
[44:27] of Ahab and Jezreel with all and all his
[44:31] great men and his familiar friends and
[44:33] his priests until he left him without a
[44:37] Survivor well back to
[44:41] Hosea verse
[44:43] four goes on to predict the conquest of
[44:46] Israel by Assyria which took place 30
[44:49] years after the death of jeroboam II
[44:52] Hosea lived to see the Fulfillment of
[44:55] this dire prophecy but notice noce this
[44:58] doesn't
[44:59] mean that God is saying he will destroy
[45:02] all the descendants of Israel or Jacob
[45:05] the the house means the political entity
[45:09] the the dynasty the idolatrous kingdom
[45:12] that is what will cease to exist the
[45:14] kingdom will cease to exist with not the
[45:17] people
[45:19] they the verse five indicates the
[45:22] destruction of the military power of the
[45:24] northern kingdom and the same as J
[45:28] exercised that power eradicating ahab's
[45:30] Dynasty or
[45:34] house verse six and Goomer conceived
[45:38] again and bear a daughter and God said
[45:42] to
[45:43] Hosea call the baby girl's name
[45:46] L for I will no more have mercy upon the
[45:50] house of Israel but I will utterly take
[45:53] them
[45:55] away if you read this verse in various
[45:57] translations you'll say I will no longer
[45:59] have mercy uh be unloved I will no
[46:02] longer pity the the root word is raim
[46:07] which means compassionate so to have
[46:09] compassion love Mercy have pity all
[46:13] these nuances all these meanings of this
[46:15] word seem to apply here and that's why
[46:17] various translators use different of
[46:20] these words in English to describe this
[46:24] so be very careful when you read this
[46:27] in verse six God is Not declaring he
[46:29] will no longer have compassion or Mercy
[46:33] on the descendants of Jacob the people
[46:36] of Israel but that he will no longer
[46:38] have mercy or care or pity on their
[46:40] political institution the idolatrous
[46:43] kingdom established after the death of
[46:46] Solomon the phrase is the house of
[46:50] Israel same as you read in verse four
[46:52] the Lord is underscoring that the
[46:54] northern kingdom will be destroyed as a
[46:56] political entity and that the people of
[46:58] that house its residents or citizens
[47:00] will be scattered utterly take them away
[47:03] not utterly destroy them they'll be
[47:05] scattered contrast with the next verse
[47:08] seven but I will have mercy that word
[47:12] Rahim upon the house of Judah and will
[47:15] save them by the Lord their God the Lord
[47:20] is still their God not the idols at
[47:22] bethl or Dan that the first jeroboam set
[47:25] up and will not save them by Bow nor by
[47:29] sword nor by battle by horses nor by
[47:32] Horsemen in other
[47:35] words I will intervene on their behalf I
[47:38] will save them
[47:41] supernaturally the prophecy is that the
[47:44] political entity called the house of
[47:46] Judah what we often call the kingdom of
[47:48] Judah or the southern Kingdom would be
[47:51] saved preserved not by military might
[47:54] but by the direct intervention
[47:56] of the Lord
[47:59] himself there's such a contrast between
[48:01] the northern and southern kingdoms one
[48:03] receives Mercy the other does not one is
[48:07] consumed by idolatry the other at least
[48:09] for a Time focuses on worship of and
[48:11] obedience to the
[48:15] Lord Israel is conquered and its
[48:17] population scattered during the reign of
[48:19] its final King fellow named hosia not to
[48:22] be confused with Hosea and this is
[48:25] during the Reigns of ahaz and hezek in
[48:28] Judah did you recognize in verse 7 what
[48:32] we read when we took a look at the book
[48:35] of Isaiah a couple of months
[48:39] ago we saw that in hezekiah's reign much
[48:43] of Judah had been conquered by the
[48:45] Assyrians Jerusalem was under attack by
[48:48] an overwhelming military force but
[48:51] Hezekiah went to the temple to seek the
[48:55] Lord not to his military
[48:57] to seek a strategy Isaiah 37 we read
[49:01] Isaiah speaking therefore thus saith the
[49:02] Lord concerning the king of Assyria he
[49:05] shall not come into this city nor shoot
[49:07] an arrow there nor come before it with
[49:09] shields nor cast a bank against it by
[49:11] the way that he came by the same shall
[49:13] he return and shall not come into this
[49:15] city saeth the Lord for I will defend
[49:19] this city to save it for my own sake and
[49:21] for my servant David's
[49:23] sake verse seven that we just read in
[49:25] Hosea then the angel of the Lord went
[49:28] forth and smote in the camp of the
[49:30] syrians 104 score score is 20 so four
[49:34] score is 80
[49:38] 185,000 and when they the survivors
[49:42] arose early in the morning behold they
[49:45] were in the midst of all the dead
[49:51] corpses in the first book verse of the
[49:53] book of Hosea he stated his ministry
[49:55] continued into the rain of Hezekiah it's
[49:58] very likely that he lived to see the
[50:00] Fulfillment of Isaiah's
[50:03] prophecy back to
[50:06] Hosea verse eight of chapter 1 now when
[50:10] goer had weaned
[50:12] Lama she conceived and bear a
[50:15] son then said God call his name Lo am me
[50:21] for you are not my people and I will not
[50:24] be your God
[50:27] L am me literally means not my people
[50:30] loow means no you ask a child to do
[50:33] something and they say l no they're not
[50:35] going to do it LO means no or not um
[50:39] means people and the E suffix makes
[50:42] people become my people thus Lo am me is
[50:46] not my
[50:48] people why this
[50:51] name God refuses to be identified with
[50:54] those who do not worship him and him
[50:56] alone
[50:57] it's not a permanent sance or
[50:59] relationship as we'll
[51:01] see this brings us to a place in the
[51:03] scripture that I found a little
[51:05] surprising the last two verses we show
[51:07] of chapter one of Hosea that is verses
[51:10] 10 and 11 aren't in the Hebrew Bible the
[51:13] Hebrew Bible ends at verse 9 but those
[51:15] next two verses are part of chapter two
[51:18] of the Hebrew Bible so the Hebrew Bible
[51:20] has two more verses in Chapter 2 than we
[51:23] do because they felt apparently that
[51:26] they tied better with chapter
[51:28] 2 well don't
[51:31] worry I won't be going verse by verse
[51:34] through the whole
[51:35] book but the first portion of the book I
[51:38] think merits this close scrutiny in
[51:40] order to more carefully comprehend the
[51:42] prophecies that make up the bulk of the
[51:45] book going on to verse
[51:48] 10 after these people are going to be
[51:50] scattered the Israel Judah so forth he
[51:55] says the Lord speak speaking still yet
[51:57] the number of the children of Israel
[51:59] shall be as the sand of the sea which
[52:02] cannot be measured nor numbered and it
[52:04] shall come to pass that in the place
[52:06] where it was said unto them ye are not
[52:08] my people that is L am there it shall be
[52:14] said unto them ye are the sons of the
[52:17] Living
[52:18] God the Lord goes on in this prophecy to
[52:21] assure that in spite of estrangement
[52:24] caused by the unfaithfulness of the
[52:26] people
[52:27] God will fulfill his promise to Abraham
[52:30] that his descendants will be as the sand
[52:32] of the sea in Genesis as the stars of
[52:34] the heaven is the dust of the
[52:36] earth Israel here is
[52:43] Jacob and at some future time rather
[52:47] than Lo
[52:48] Ami they will be the children of God
[52:51] this tells us that the relationship
[52:53] between the Lord and the descendants of
[52:55] Jacob will eventually be restored the
[52:58] sin forgiven we'll get back to this
[53:01] verse in a moment verse 11 then shall
[53:05] the children of Judah this is the Lord
[53:07] speaking again then shall the children
[53:09] of Judah and the children of Israel be
[53:11] gathered together and appoint themselves
[53:14] one head and they shall come up out of
[53:17] the
[53:18] land for great shall be the day of
[53:24] Jezreel here we see that the descendants
[53:26] of Jacob shown as peoples of two
[53:28] kingdoms will be gathered together under
[53:30] one leader and now the meaning of
[53:33] hosea's firstborn jesrael is not simply
[53:35] symbolic of the valley of jezrael but
[53:38] God will plant is reinforced by stating
[53:41] that they will come up out of the land
[53:44] they shall come up out of the land for
[53:46] great shall be the day of God will plant
[53:50] there's going to be a
[53:51] harvest not Doom and Gloom but promised
[53:55] restoration
[53:57] not an easy path to be sure but one
[54:00] whose end will be
[54:06] glorious the next topic Israel's
[54:09] unfaithfulness punished the first half
[54:12] of chapter 2 through verse 13 begins
[54:15] with the Lord telling Hosea to plead
[54:17] with the nation to abandon its
[54:20] unfaithfulness otherwise the Lord will
[54:23] punish the nation and its people the
[54:26] descriptions are rather
[54:28] graphic the first section reads the
[54:32] conclusion of it in anyway verse 11
[54:35] after he's had these very graphic
[54:38] descriptions I will also cause all her
[54:40] mirth her happiness to cease her annual
[54:43] feast days her new moons her sabbaths
[54:46] and all her solemn feasts the feasts and
[54:49] celebrations demanded under Moses
[54:54] law cause them to seee
[54:57] I will destroy her Vines and her fig
[54:59] trees whereof she has said these are my
[55:03] rewards the wages that my lovers have
[55:06] given me for my infidelity failing to
[55:09] recognize the harvests and the goodness
[55:11] of the Lord were gifts from the Lord to
[55:13] his people I will make them a forest
[55:16] Tangled thickets and the wild beasts of
[55:19] the field shall eat them they won't be
[55:21] tended
[55:23] anymore and I will visit upon her I will
[55:26] will punish her for the days of balim
[55:29] wherein she burned incense to them and
[55:32] she decked herself with her earrings and
[55:34] her jewels and she went after her lovers
[55:37] and forgot me sayith the
[55:42] Lord baalim sometimes we look at that
[55:45] and say balum and we think that it's
[55:47] some God of the Canaanites or
[55:50] something as a kid I always heard this
[55:53] word as being the name of a particular
[55:54] Canaanite god
[55:56] it's incorrect baalim is a Hebrew word
[56:00] and is a plural of Baal which means
[56:02] Master Lord owner that's why the text
[56:05] said Israel burned incense to
[56:08] them them them is a plural not to be
[56:12] confused with some of the preferred
[56:13] pronouns demanded by the gender confused
[56:15] of our time the Lord is really angry
[56:19] with Israel for idolatrous Behavior
[56:22] worshiping all sorts of things rather
[56:24] than worshiping the Lord
[56:27] and he's sad that the nation has
[56:30] forgotten
[56:34] him the second half of chapter 2
[56:36] starting at verse 14 is this next
[56:38] section the Lord's Mercy on Israel it
[56:40] tells how the Lord will Mo back to
[56:42] himself the nation that has left
[56:45] him after he visits his punishments
[56:48] remember the Lord's
[56:49] discipline is intended to teach and to
[56:54] correct not to destroy
[56:57] this is so beautiful I want to read this
[57:01] section not so much to dissect it but so
[57:04] you can hear the voice of the patient
[57:07] forgiving gracious and merciful god the
[57:11] one we love the one we try to serve
[57:14] verse
[57:16] 14 therefore behold I will Allure her I
[57:19] will woo her I rewin her back again and
[57:22] bring her into the Wilderness and speak
[57:24] comfortably kindly tenderly unto her
[57:26] I will give her her Vineyards from there
[57:28] and the valley of acho for a Door of
[57:30] Hope and she shall sing there as in the
[57:34] days of her youth as in the day when she
[57:36] came up out of the land of Egypt and it
[57:40] shall be at that day sayeth the Lord
[57:42] that thou shalt C me
[57:44] ishi literally means my man my husband
[57:48] and shalt no more call me b Ali My Lord
[57:52] for I will take away the names of baalim
[57:55] the pantheon of false gods out of her
[57:58] mouth and they shall no more be
[58:00] remembered by their name and in that day
[58:04] I will make a covenant for them with the
[58:06] beasts of the field and with the fowls
[58:07] of heaven and with the creeping things
[58:09] on the
[58:11] ground and I will break the bow and The
[58:14] Sword and the
[58:16] battle out of the earth and will make
[58:19] them to lie down safely
[58:26] I don't see sister Rachel Peterson she
[58:28] may be here she may be streaming she may
[58:30] be in a different room but when I read
[58:32] that
[58:33] verse I can hear the voice of sister
[58:37] Rachel's grandfather brother Harrison
[58:40] Phillip singing there will be peace in
[58:43] the valley for me
[58:46] someday he used to sing that many
[58:49] decades ago in the Tabernacle and I
[58:52] whenever I read that verse the verses in
[58:53] Isaiah that say the same thing I just
[58:56] there's just a little tape or something
[58:58] that plays in my head and I hear Brother
[59:00] Harrison singing that and it just brings
[59:02] a smile to my
[59:04] face and I will be Troy unto me
[59:09] forever forever yay I will bet try unto
[59:12] me in righteousness and in judgment and
[59:15] in loving kindness and in
[59:19] mercies doesn't that sound like our
[59:21] future relationship is the bride of
[59:23] Christ God isn't after a her
[59:27] Solomon not the example will be one with
[59:30] our Jewish brothers and sisters at that
[59:33] time oops wrong button I will even betro
[59:38] thee unto me in faithfulness and thou
[59:40] shalt know the Lord and it shall come to
[59:43] pass on that day I will hear sayeth the
[59:46] Lord I will hear the heavens and they
[59:48] shall hear the Earth and the Earth shall
[59:50] hear the Grain and the wine and the oil
[59:53] and they shall hear Jezreel they shall
[59:55] hear God God has
[59:57] planted and I will swow her unto me in
[1:00:01] the earth that planting again and I will
[1:00:05] have mercy upon her that had not
[1:00:07] obtained mercy and I will say to them
[1:00:10] which were not my people you're are my
[1:00:13] people and they shall say you're my
[1:00:17] God what a promise what hope Mercy
[1:00:23] love before we look at the next chapter
[1:00:26] recall our opening verses a part of the
[1:00:29] historical background of the Lord's
[1:00:31] complaint about Israel was referred to
[1:00:34] in Matthew's gospel as a
[1:00:36] prophecy concerning Jesus brother
[1:00:39] brandom used that verse to explain that
[1:00:42] scripture can have what he called a
[1:00:44] compound
[1:00:46] meaning well this last verse of chapter
[1:00:50] two is also a verse with compound
[1:00:53] meaning along with verses 9 and 10 of
[1:00:56] the first chapter let's read from Paul's
[1:00:58] epistle to the Romans chapter n he's
[1:01:02] telling of his heartache for his people
[1:01:04] Israel their inability to recognize
[1:01:07] Jesus as their Messiah Romans 9:22 what
[1:01:11] if God willing to show his wrath and to
[1:01:14] make his power known endured with much
[1:01:17] longsuffering the vessels of Wrath
[1:01:19] fitted to destruction and that he might
[1:01:22] make known The Riches of his glory on
[1:01:24] the vessels of Mercy Mercy which we had
[1:01:26] a for prepared unto
[1:01:30] Glory even us whom he hath called not of
[1:01:35] the Jews only but also of the
[1:01:40] Gentiles as he has said also in hos
[1:01:43] that's Hosea this was from the Greek so
[1:01:45] it's spelled a bit
[1:01:48] differently I will call them my people
[1:01:50] which were not my people and her beloved
[1:01:53] which was not beloved and it's a come to
[1:01:56] pass it in the place where it was said
[1:01:57] unto them ye are not my people there
[1:02:00] shall they be called the children of the
[1:02:03] Living
[1:02:05] God let's see this compound meaning just
[1:02:07] a moment we just read in Hosea about God
[1:02:10] and Israel Paul says this applies to
[1:02:11] Gentiles too look Romans
[1:02:14] 9:25 and Hosea 2:23 I've highlighted in
[1:02:18] in yellow these particular
[1:02:20] matches Romans I will call them my
[1:02:23] people which were not my people Hosea
[1:02:26] I will say to them which were not my
[1:02:28] people Thou Art my
[1:02:32] people and her beloved which was not
[1:02:36] beloved I will have mercy upon her that
[1:02:38] had not obtained
[1:02:41] Mercy recall the daughter named
[1:02:45] Luma the root raahim means compassionate
[1:02:49] love Mercy the are saying the same thing
[1:02:52] Paul's writing in Greek Hosea wrote in
[1:02:54] Hebrew or what about verse 26 the whole
[1:02:57] verse it shall come to pass that in the
[1:02:59] place where it was said unto them ye are
[1:03:01] not my people there they should be
[1:03:02] called the children of the Living God
[1:03:04] Hosea 1:10 the second half of the verse
[1:03:07] it shall come to pass that in the place
[1:03:08] that was said unto them ye are not my
[1:03:10] people there it shall be said unto them
[1:03:11] you are the sons of the Living
[1:03:14] God so we as Gentiles can claim the same
[1:03:20] promise of forgiveness grace mercy and
[1:03:24] ultimate Redemption the Bible is
[1:03:27] consistent with this theme from Genesis
[1:03:29] 1:1 and the Old Testament through
[1:03:32] Revelation 22:21 in the
[1:03:35] new Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[1:03:41] and
[1:03:41] today and forever his word is
[1:03:46] consistent are we ready for chapter
[1:03:49] three yeah okay let's go Hosea redeems
[1:03:53] his
[1:03:54] wife Rec that hosea's marriage and its
[1:03:57] problems were directed by the Lord to
[1:04:00] represent his relationship with
[1:04:04] Israel this chapter is only five verses
[1:04:06] so let's
[1:04:09] read the Lord said unto me go yet love a
[1:04:13] woman beloved of her friend yet an
[1:04:15] adulteress according to the love of the
[1:04:17] Lord toward the children of Israel who
[1:04:20] look to other gods and love flagin of
[1:04:24] wine that's a little strange I'll I'll
[1:04:27] leave this on the screen so you can
[1:04:28] follow but I'm going to read from the
[1:04:30] NIV translation I think it makes it a
[1:04:32] little clearer the Lord said to me go
[1:04:37] show your love to your wife Goomer again
[1:04:40] though she is loved by we'd say living
[1:04:43] with another man and is an
[1:04:47] adulteress stop right there the penalty
[1:04:50] for this under moses' law is death
[1:04:53] Leviticus 20:10 says the man that
[1:04:55] committed adultery with another man's
[1:04:57] wife Goomer even he that committeth
[1:05:00] adultery with his neighbor's wife the
[1:05:02] adulterer and the adulteress shall
[1:05:04] surely be put to
[1:05:08] death but Hosea is not asked to kill her
[1:05:11] and her boyfriend instead he was asked
[1:05:14] to love her as the lord loves the
[1:05:17] Israelites though they turn to other
[1:05:19] gods and love the sacred raisin cakes
[1:05:23] raisin cakes King James flagin of wine
[1:05:26] the Hebrew is grapes pressed together
[1:05:29] you do that you let get the juice
[1:05:31] ferment you get wine otherwise you get
[1:05:33] raisin cakes raisin cakes were a food
[1:05:34] that was used in a lot of pagan Worship
[1:05:37] in Israel at that time most translations
[1:05:40] say raisin cakes but not sure that it
[1:05:43] really matters which one it was I'm
[1:05:46] certainly not going to make a Doctrine
[1:05:48] out of either
[1:05:49] one so I bought her back to me for 15
[1:05:53] pieces of silver and for an Omer of
[1:05:56] barley and a halfer of
[1:05:57] barley it's the price of a slave we're
[1:06:01] not told how hosea's wife came to become
[1:06:03] the slave possession of
[1:06:06] another what we are told is that he is
[1:06:09] redeeming
[1:06:10] her like us she is bought with a
[1:06:14] price and I said unto her Thou shalt
[1:06:17] abide for me many days Thou shalt not
[1:06:20] play the Harlot Thou shalt not be for
[1:06:22] another man and so I will also be for
[1:06:24] thee in other words it'll remain in
[1:06:27] seclusion for some time our relationship
[1:06:30] will be strictly platonic during that
[1:06:33] time and now the symbolism is explained
[1:06:37] for the children of Israel shall abide
[1:06:39] many days without a King Without a
[1:06:42] prince without a sacrifice without an
[1:06:45] image without an ephod the the Priestly
[1:06:48] uh vest without teraphim teraphim are
[1:06:51] household Gods it's a plural little
[1:06:54] idols and sounds like the
[1:06:57] diaspora from about 135 ad and including
[1:07:01] modern
[1:07:02] times afterward shall the descendants of
[1:07:05] Israel return return this means to turn
[1:07:08] around in other words they will
[1:07:11] repent and seek devote themselves to the
[1:07:15] Lord their God and and David their King
[1:07:18] referring to Jesus Son of David King of
[1:07:21] Kings and shall fear tremble in awe of
[1:07:24] the Lord and his goodness in the latter
[1:07:30] days that's the day we're living
[1:07:34] in next chapter chapter four The Lord
[1:07:38] accuses Israel chapter four is a
[1:07:40] description of the offenses of Israel
[1:07:42] it's focused on those that dwell in the
[1:07:44] northern kingdom as we read in h chapter
[1:07:48] 4:1
[1:07:49] 15 though thou Israel play the Harlot
[1:07:53] yet let not Judah offend
[1:07:56] and Come Ye not un gilgal neither go ye
[1:07:58] up to beavan nor swear the Lord liveth
[1:08:01] so he's separating the northern and
[1:08:02] southern kingdoms here this was written
[1:08:06] then in the reign of jeroboam 2 as Hosea
[1:08:08] listed at the beginning of the book
[1:08:10] Israel is still a nation Judah still
[1:08:13] under a righteous
[1:08:16] King punishment coming for Israel in
[1:08:19] Judah chapter 5 tells Israel and Judah
[1:08:22] that punishment is coming to both
[1:08:24] Nations do to their
[1:08:27] infidelity Israel and Judah are
[1:08:29] unrepentant chapter six opens with the
[1:08:33] plea for repentance but Israel and Judah
[1:08:36] will not let's read the first few verses
[1:08:39] the first three verses are Hosea
[1:08:41] pleading with the people the subsequent
[1:08:43] verses are the Lord's thoughts and
[1:08:45] musings over the sad state of the people
[1:08:48] and note that in verse four when we get
[1:08:50] to that and often throughout Hosea the
[1:08:53] the name of Ephraim one of of the tribes
[1:08:56] is used to represent the Northern
[1:08:59] Kingdom of Israel Hosea speaking 61 come
[1:09:04] let us return unto the Lord he hath torn
[1:09:08] he will heal us he ha smitten he will
[1:09:11] bind us up after two days he will revive
[1:09:14] us the third day he will raise us up and
[1:09:16] we shall live in his sight then shall we
[1:09:19] know if we follow on to know the Lord
[1:09:22] his going forth is prepared as the
[1:09:24] morning and he will come unto us as the
[1:09:26] rain as the latter and former rain unto
[1:09:28] the
[1:09:29] Earth but these rains spring and late
[1:09:33] summer Reigns are necessary for a
[1:09:34] successful Harvest this is an
[1:09:36] Agricultural Society Hosea is telling
[1:09:39] the people that they will be blessed of
[1:09:41] the Lord if they will only repent and
[1:09:44] truly follow him and and now the Lord
[1:09:48] speaks
[1:09:49] Oham what shall I do unto thee Judah
[1:09:52] what shall I do unto thee for your
[1:09:54] goodness is as a morning Cloud as the
[1:09:56] early duw it goes away the worship the
[1:10:00] lies reflecting obedience are
[1:10:03] insincere therefore have I hewed them by
[1:10:06] the prophets I have slain them by the
[1:10:08] words of my mouth and thy judgments the
[1:10:11] judgments of the Lord upon them are as
[1:10:13] the light that goeth
[1:10:15] forth for I desired Mercy not sacrifice
[1:10:20] and the knowledge of God more than burnt
[1:10:24] offerings Jesus Jesus quotes this in
[1:10:27] Matthew
[1:10:31] 12:7 but they like men have transgressed
[1:10:34] the
[1:10:35] Covenant there have they dealt
[1:10:37] treacherously against
[1:10:40] me chapter 7 continues the theme of
[1:10:43] Israel and Judah being unrepentant we'll
[1:10:45] we'll move quickly through most of the
[1:10:47] rest of these
[1:10:48] topics excuse me please read these
[1:10:51] chapters at
[1:10:53] home Israel
[1:10:55] will reap the Whirlwind chapter 8 tells
[1:10:59] of the continuing sin of the people
[1:11:01] their worship of Idols forsaking of the
[1:11:03] Lord he declares that they have swn the
[1:11:06] wind but they'll reap the Whirlwind
[1:11:09] there'll be a
[1:11:10] harvest the Lord will punish Israel
[1:11:13] chapters nine and 10 describe the causes
[1:11:17] and the punishment that the Lord will
[1:11:23] perform the Lord's love for is Israel
[1:11:26] chapter 11 contained our opening
[1:11:29] verses like many of the selections which
[1:11:31] describ the Lord's complaint to Israel
[1:11:34] yet offer hope through repentance so
[1:11:37] this section whose theme is God's love
[1:11:38] for Israel describes his complaints yet
[1:11:41] offers his love let's read a few verses
[1:11:45] from it
[1:11:46] here when Israel was a child then I
[1:11:49] loved him and called my son out of Egypt
[1:11:52] and as they called them the more the
[1:11:54] prophet spoke to the people people so
[1:11:55] the more the people went from them from
[1:11:57] the prophets and their calls for
[1:11:59] repentance and righteousness they
[1:12:02] sacrificed unto baalim and burnt incense
[1:12:04] to graven images I taught ephriam also
[1:12:07] to go taking them by their arms but they
[1:12:10] knew not that I healed them I drew them
[1:12:12] with cords of a man with bands of love I
[1:12:15] was to them as they that take off the
[1:12:16] Yol on their jaws I laid meat unto them
[1:12:19] these verses may be a little confusing
[1:12:21] but it's speaking of leading them out of
[1:12:24] slavery in Egypt eypt through Moses
[1:12:26] cords of a man and laid meat on them
[1:12:30] Mana in the
[1:12:34] desert they they were living in a land
[1:12:37] that could not possibly sustain them by
[1:12:40] his
[1:12:41] grace he shall not return unto the land
[1:12:43] of
[1:12:44] Egypt not going back to slavery there
[1:12:48] but the Assyrian shall be his King why
[1:12:52] because they refuse to return return
[1:12:55] means repent so Assyria will conquer the
[1:12:59] northern kingdom because they refuse to
[1:13:01] repent and return to the Lord and the
[1:13:04] sword shall abide on his cities and
[1:13:06] shall consume his branches and devour
[1:13:08] them because of their own counsels and
[1:13:10] my people are bent determined to
[1:13:13] backsliding from me though they the
[1:13:16] prophets called them to the most high
[1:13:19] none at all would exalt him would exalt
[1:13:23] the Lord
[1:13:25] how shall I give thee up Ephraim how
[1:13:27] shall I deliver thee Israel how shall I
[1:13:30] make thee as adma how shall I set thee
[1:13:31] as zeboim my heart is turned within me
[1:13:35] my repenting are kindled
[1:13:37] together my heart burns with anger
[1:13:40] however I will not execute the
[1:13:42] fierceness of my anger I will not return
[1:13:45] to destroy
[1:13:46] Ephraim for I am God not man in spite of
[1:13:51] their fickleness and insincerity in
[1:13:53] spite of their forgetting that I rescued
[1:13:55] them from slavery that I fed them in a
[1:13:57] Wilderness that could not support them I
[1:13:59] won't destroy them because I'm God I'm
[1:14:02] not a man the opposite of say
[1:14:06] Nebuchadnezzar skipping to the last
[1:14:09] verse Ephraim compasses me about he
[1:14:12] surrounds me with lies the house of
[1:14:15] Israel with deceit but Judah yet ruleth
[1:14:18] with God and is faithful with the Saints
[1:14:20] the the holy
[1:14:22] ones the chapter ends with a suggestion
[1:14:24] that at the time of this prophecy the
[1:14:26] northern kingdom had not yet been taken
[1:14:28] by Assyria there was still time to
[1:14:31] repent though the Lord knew they would
[1:14:36] not the next section is the Lord's
[1:14:38] indictment of Israel and Judah chapter
[1:14:42] 12 is more of the Lord's reflection on
[1:14:44] the state of Israel he again reminds
[1:14:47] them what they must do verse
[1:14:51] six therefore turn thou to thy God keep
[1:14:55] keep mercy and judgment and wait on thy
[1:14:57] God whenever it's
[1:14:59] convenient whenever you're in church
[1:15:03] whenever you're having morning
[1:15:06] devotions wait on thy God
[1:15:11] continually by the way when you read
[1:15:14] chapter 12 read chapter 13 you'll see a
[1:15:17] reference to the East
[1:15:20] Wind what does that mean the East Wind
[1:15:27] when Heather and I lived in Israel we
[1:15:29] learned that the name for the East Wind
[1:15:31] was
[1:15:33] hamim the context is that this wind
[1:15:36] blows in from the Arabian Peninsula it's
[1:15:39] hot and very very dry it dehydrates and
[1:15:44] desiccates if you're not careful it'll
[1:15:47] take the very life from you so when they
[1:15:51] refer to the East Wind in the Old
[1:15:53] Testament
[1:15:55] this is the
[1:15:56] context I just thought you wanted to
[1:15:59] know
[1:16:01] that the Lord's Relentless judgment on
[1:16:05] Israel chapter 13 is not just a reminder
[1:16:08] of what Israel lost but a warning to us
[1:16:12] in our day of following the same path
[1:16:16] let's read the first six
[1:16:20] verses when ephriam spake trembling when
[1:16:23] Ephraim spoke people trembled they
[1:16:24] should with fear he exalted himself he
[1:16:27] was a power in Israel but when he
[1:16:30] offended incurred guilt to the worship
[1:16:32] of Bal he
[1:16:36] died now they sin more and more they
[1:16:40] have made them molten images of their
[1:16:42] silver Idols according to their own
[1:16:44] understanding all of it the work of the
[1:16:48] Craftsman they say of them let the men
[1:16:52] that sacrifice kiss the Cales to kiss
[1:16:55] the idols the
[1:16:57] consequences therefore they shall be as
[1:16:59] a morning Cloud as the early due that
[1:17:01] passes away as the chaff that is driven
[1:17:03] with the Whirlwind out of the threshing
[1:17:05] floor and as a smoke out of the
[1:17:09] chimney they'll become as nothing yet I
[1:17:13] am the Lord thy God from the land of
[1:17:15] Egypt I took you from the land of Egypt
[1:17:17] and thou shalt know no God but me for
[1:17:21] there is no savior beside me
[1:17:26] I did know thee in the wilderness in the
[1:17:29] land of great drought according to their
[1:17:32] pasture so were they
[1:17:34] filled they were filled their heart was
[1:17:38] exalted therefore they have forgotten
[1:17:42] me these two verses in particular are a
[1:17:46] warning to us when things were hard when
[1:17:48] we lived in a Land of great drought
[1:17:51] people turned to and trusted God like
[1:17:54] verse five
[1:17:56] but for many years now here in America
[1:17:58] and many other places we lived in a Land
[1:18:00] of Plenty like verse six as a nation we
[1:18:03] are filled we speak of our president as
[1:18:06] the most powerful man on Earth the
[1:18:08] leader of the Free World our nation's
[1:18:11] heart has become
[1:18:13] exalted and therefore the Lord warns us
[1:18:16] through Hosea we as a nation have
[1:18:19] forgotten the
[1:18:21] Lord but we can also identify with verse
[1:18:26] oh Israel thou Hast destroyed
[1:18:30] thyself but in me is thine help this is
[1:18:35] true not just for Israel in hosea's day
[1:18:38] but for our nation for
[1:18:39] ourselves our help is in the
[1:18:45] Lord the last section the last chapter
[1:18:49] is is a plea to return to the Lord we
[1:18:53] we'll get into that
[1:18:57] what lessons can we take home from
[1:19:00] Hosea I I think the Final Chapter a
[1:19:04] plead to repent to repent to turn to the
[1:19:07] Lord I think that that should be the
[1:19:11] take home it's only nine
[1:19:15] verses so let's read it I'll try to
[1:19:18] separate the voices of Hosea and the
[1:19:20] Lord this chapter takes a form of a
[1:19:22] conversation between Hosea and and the
[1:19:27] Lord oh Israel return unto the Lord thy
[1:19:31] God thou has fallen by thine iniquity
[1:19:35] take with you words and turn to the Lord
[1:19:37] say to him take away all iniquity
[1:19:40] receive us graciously so we will render
[1:19:43] the sacrifices of our lips Asher shall
[1:19:46] not save us we will not ride upon horses
[1:19:48] neither will we say any more to the work
[1:19:50] of our hands ye are our gods for in thee
[1:19:54] the father
[1:19:55] findeth
[1:19:57] mercy and with that the Lord says I will
[1:20:01] heal their backsliding I will love them
[1:20:04] freely for mine anger is turned away
[1:20:07] from him I will be as the Dew unto
[1:20:10] Israel he shall grow as the Lily cast
[1:20:12] forth his roots as levanon his branches
[1:20:15] shall spread his Beauty shall be as the
[1:20:17] Olive Tree his smell as Lebanon they
[1:20:20] that dwell under his shadow shall return
[1:20:24] they shall Rive is the grain grow is the
[1:20:26] vine the scent thereof shall be as the
[1:20:29] wine of
[1:20:30] Lebanon Ephraim shall say what have I to
[1:20:34] do anymore with
[1:20:36] Idols
[1:20:37] repentance I have heard him and observed
[1:20:40] him I am like a green fur tree from me
[1:20:44] is thy fruit
[1:20:46] found back to the voice of Jose in the
[1:20:49] concluding verse of the
[1:20:50] book who is wise and he shall understand
[1:20:54] the these things prudent and he shall
[1:20:57] know
[1:20:59] them for the ways of the Lord are right
[1:21:03] and the just shall walk in them but the
[1:21:07] transgressors shall fall
[1:21:09] therein i' like to invite the musicians
[1:21:11] to please
[1:21:13] return I trust you've received something
[1:21:16] from the Lord through the reading of his
[1:21:18] word this evening and that you're
[1:21:20] encouraged to read the short book of the
[1:21:22] Prophet Hosea
[1:21:25] one of the reasons I like to read so
[1:21:26] much from the Bible on these evenings is
[1:21:28] that my words will fail I may say
[1:21:31] something incorrect maybe many things
[1:21:34] but God's word is true it's
[1:21:37] reliable I'd like to close this portion
[1:21:39] of the service with words from David
[1:21:42] found in the 19th Psalm verses 7-
[1:21:45] 11 just like Hosea
[1:21:48] 149 the ways of the Lord are right and
[1:21:50] and also in this particular uh few
[1:21:53] verses of uh
[1:21:55] of the 19th Psalm it mentions the
[1:21:57] honeycomb and some of you may be aware
[1:22:00] but the traditional snack for this
[1:22:02] evening although I neglected to bring it
[1:22:05] and I apologize is slices of Apple

[1:26:31] the new translation he who keeps back
[1:26:34] his Rod is unkind to his
[1:26:37] son the loving father gives punishment
[1:26:41] with
[1:26:43] care I felt that tied right into the
[1:26:45] book of Hosea when I read it he loved us
[1:26:48] he cared for us even though we fail him
[1:26:52] many times
[1:26:54] but he says you know what you're still
[1:26:56] mine I care for you I'll straighten you
[1:26:59] out I'll fix you and sometimes you know
[1:27:03] uh as a father as a grandpa now too

[1:27:10] get upset we maybe but we love our
[1:27:13] children we love our family we want the
[1:27:16] best and how much more
[1:27:18] him appreciate that I I again reading
[1:27:21] through the book of Hosea I went through
[1:27:23] the the book book I like to do that
[1:27:26] nobody's going to say but I like the
[1:27:28] songs to tie in with that that would
[1:27:30] speak of his of of both sides we've
[1:27:34] we've gone against you yet you've called
[1:27:36] us
[1:27:37] back and
[1:27:39] um I still am amazed how brother Lyall
[1:27:42] and brother Daniel can do
[1:27:44] this but to each one God allows you to
[1:27:48] understand and see what he want to do
[1:27:52] so he looked beyond my
[1:27:55] fault and he saw my need how many
[1:27:58] appreciate that of him you know that I
[1:28:02] look at myself in the mirror and I
[1:28:04] always say this to my wife I said why

[1:28:10] there and then she walks in and she
[1:28:12] looks at she says because it's
[1:28:15] beautiful but you know sometimes as you
[1:28:17] look at yourself you don't see anything
[1:28:19] good you're frustrated with yourself
[1:28:21] you're upset with yourself but but when
[1:28:24] God looks at you through the blood
[1:28:25] you're pure you're clean you're whole
[1:28:28] he's what you want you to be
