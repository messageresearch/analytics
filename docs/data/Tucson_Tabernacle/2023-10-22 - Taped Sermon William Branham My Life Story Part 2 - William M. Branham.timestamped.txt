[36:24] the service over to brother Aaron to do
[36:26] the prayer requ ests and introduce the
[36:28] second portion of the sermon tonight I'm
[36:32] going to have him reread the prayer
[36:33] request from the linards for Brother
[36:35] David from this morning I rushed through
[36:38] that prayer request and didn't do it
[36:39] justice so forgive me for that but we'll
[36:42] have them read that as well as some
[36:44] other prayer requests let's just sing
[36:45] the song Jesus Jesus Jesus oh
[36:51] Jesus
[36:54] Jesus Jes
[36:59] Jus there's just
[37:02] something
[37:04] about that
[37:10] name
[37:13] Master
[37:16] Savior
[37:20] Jesus like a
[37:24] fragrance after
[37:27] the
[37:30] rain oh
[37:34] Jesus
[37:37] Jesus
[37:41] Jesus let all
[37:44] Heaven and
[37:46] Earth
[37:48] [Music]
[37:52] Proclaim
[37:54] Kings and kingdoms
[37:58] will
[37:59] all pass
[38:01] away but there's
[38:04] something
[38:06] about that
[38:11] name yes
[38:14] Jesus
[38:16] Jesus my
[38:21] Jesus there's just
[38:24] something about
[38:27] that
[38:37] name
[38:41] Jesus like the
[38:44] fragrance
[38:46] After the
[38:51] Rain
[38:54] Jesus Jesus
[38:56] [Music]
[39:00] Jesus let all
[39:03] Heaven and Earth
[39:10] Proclaim
[39:12] King and
[39:15] kingdoms shall
[39:17] all pass
[39:19] away but there's
[39:22] something
[39:24] about that
[39:29] you may be seated for a moment here just
[39:30] keep playing
[39:33] that you know it's when you you create
[39:36] an atmosphere and he comes down
[39:39] and he's not obligated to us in that
[39:42] sense but he loves
[39:44] us and you make him welcome he
[39:47] comes you know sure we've all
[39:51] experienced somebody somewhere someplace
[39:53] that you kind of just stand there and
[39:54] you know that they're just not making
[39:56] you
[39:58] welcome they're being nice because they
[40:00] have to
[40:02] be but if in your heart you just make an
[40:06] atmosphere that he says you know they
[40:07] want me close they're calling on me
[40:11] he'll come because he keeps his word
[40:14] so we do have a couple of requests
[40:18] and that are written here and this
[40:23] morning the update on Brother David
[40:28] linhard and we'll read the from the
[40:32] linhard family many have been asking
[40:35] me how he's
[40:37] doing he had a setback about 3 weeks ago
[40:40] with a staff infection in his original
[40:44] incision this led to new pain pain meds
[40:48] necessary and dialysis for the
[40:51] kidneys he had been seriously Delirious
[40:54] during this time
[40:56] [Music]
[40:57] last evening he suddenly came out of it
[41:01] talking normally and very
[41:03] hungry we appreciate all the prayers and
[41:07] concerns and believe God for totally
[41:09] hating for that's from the linart
[41:12] [Applause]
[41:14] [Music]
[41:16] [Applause]
[41:17] family sometimes things look really hard
[41:19] and
[41:22] impossible and sometimes he seem like
[41:24] he'll delay his coming
[41:27] you think about
[41:29] Lazarus he's asleep he told his
[41:32] disciples and disciples said he's doing
[41:34] well he's resting he said no he's he's
[41:38] gone on to the other side but let's wait
[41:41] a little
[41:42] while you know Lord we want you here
[41:46] now but God has reasons why and how he
[41:49] does
[41:50] things didn't make a difference to him
[41:52] Lazarus had been in the
[41:54] grave three days
[41:57] but it was no different God said
[41:59] Lazareth come for us and Lazareth came
[42:02] out he seal Jesus Christ the same
[42:04] yesterday today and
[42:06] forever
[42:10] so those of you that have been here for
[42:12] a while remember Brother David Nash down
[42:14] from the Washington
[42:16] area um he's still up there
[42:19] and I have his phone number on my phone
[42:22] and I scan past it a few times looking
[42:25] for another number and today I said I'm
[42:27] going to call him he answered the phone
[42:30] and he said brother Aaron he goes wow he
[42:33] said it's been a while hasn't I said yes
[42:34] he said well I appreciate you calling me
[42:36] and we got to talking a little bit and
[42:39] him sharing his just what the Lord has
[42:42] done with them and still doing a lot of
[42:44] missionary work and I remember the
[42:46] testimony he gave about when he was in I
[42:49] don't remember which country it was in
[42:52] but he went they took him to a hospital
[42:53] that everybody had heart problems
[42:55] serious serious heart
[42:57] problems and there was a a young lady or
[43:00] lady laying there on the ground when he
[43:02] walked by and he began to pray for
[43:05] them and every single patient in that
[43:09] portion of the Heart Hospital walked out
[43:11] of there
[43:13] well and when he came back there was one
[43:16] standing at the door and she looked at
[43:19] him he says do you remember me he says
[43:22] no I was that one laying down on the
[43:23] ground there look at me today
[43:29] [Applause]
[43:31] okay he told me today he said when I
[43:34] went back when I've gone back they told
[43:36] me I'm welcome in any one of their
[43:39] hospitals because I serve a living
[43:42] God so sometimes we we read a request
[43:45] and some but our God
[43:47] answers in his right time and but he did
[43:50] ask me to remember his wife sister
[43:52] Deborah
[43:54] Nash um she has a in intestinal
[43:58] infection that may require
[43:59] surgery so he was requesting prayer how
[44:03] sometimes it's harder for us to believe
[44:05] for
[44:05] ourselves than it is but but God is more
[44:08] than able so we'll remember
[44:12] that sister
[44:14] Melia she says thank you for your
[44:17] prayers for my daughter Lisa is back
[44:20] home and doing well she was the one that
[44:23] was went up to Colorado for the the
[44:25] blood transfusion or or bleeding there
[44:28] and then Eva who's here with her today
[44:30] is going to take medication for high
[44:32] blood pressure she has another
[44:34] appointment coming up so we can believe
[44:36] for that
[44:38] also and then sister
[44:40] hope for brother Amos Miller and family
[44:44] his wife sis Arie went to be with the
[44:46] Lord this morning and left small
[44:49] children
[44:51] behind they were the part of the the
[44:53] Fisher and H stus family which was that
[44:58] family that would come the Amish family
[45:00] would come for
[45:02] harmony it's that family so we do
[45:05] remember them in prayer and and if you
[45:08] have a
[45:09] need we we'll stay SE if you have a need
[45:11] and you say lord it's it's been a while
[45:15] it's been some time but I'll still
[45:17] believe you so if we just bow our heads
[45:23] Lord sometimes we just we get impatient
[45:27] we we get frustrated we say Lord are you
[45:31] even
[45:31] hearing but you did tell us to
[45:34] knock and the door will you said to to
[45:37] ask Lord you didn't say just once you
[45:40] just said to so Lord we're believing
[45:42] we're taking you at your word and and
[45:45] not only are we taking you at your word
[45:47] but we're going to begin to give you
[45:48] praise and thanksgiving for what you've
[45:51] done for us Lord every need supplied
[45:53] Lord when you cried out it it is
[45:56] finished it was finished Lord so we
[45:59] thank you for that today Lord and every

[46:05] mentioned Lord we commit un you now in
[46:09] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Amen
[46:12] brother Daniel sent me a text here said
[46:16] I'm on streaming he said greet the
[46:18] congregation for me show you guys all
[46:21] remember brother
[46:23] Daniel if he's watching wave clap
[46:29] so yeah we we appreciate him and all
[46:33] he's done
[46:34] so and this this
[46:38] morning the brother was here uh for a
[46:42] couple of services he was with brother
[46:43] Dave Fritz and and
[46:48] them brother uh he was a pastor brother
[46:52] Steven I think it's bani Bima from from
[46:55] the Assembly of the Saints Tabernacle in
[46:58] Uganda and he had hoped to be able to
[47:01] greet the
[47:02] congregation and I told him this evening
[47:04] but he had to leave so he said just tell
[47:07] him I said hello you probably saw him
[47:09] here but he had to head home so you know
[47:12] it's a privilege for them to come here
[47:14] this place is well known and all that
[47:16] the
[47:17] Tabernacle and and sometimes we take it
[47:20] for granted but for many
[47:22] others it it is a privilege and a
[47:25] blessing so so this evening we'll listen
[47:28] to the second
[47:29] half and in the in there's parts of here
[47:32] where brother Brandon you his
[47:35] heartbreaks but you know he's on the
[47:37] other side now and I heard a statement
[47:39] or read it maybe there's more of them on
[47:42] that side now and my dad was telling me
[47:46] the other day we were
[47:47] talking and he said I began to count
[47:50] those that when we first came to Tucson
[47:52] that I knew that were my age maybe a
[47:54] little younger but there's over
[47:57] 250 that have gone on to be with the
[48:00] Lord and I I read the statement maybe
[48:02] there's more on that side and their pull
[48:05] is getting to be a little stronger now
[48:08] and maybe we're just that much closer to
[48:10] going home
[48:12] so so as as as we sing only believe if
[48:17] you'll
[48:18] stand remember the angel of the Lord was
[48:21] pleased with that song only believe he
[48:24] said if you can get the people to
[48:27] believe nothing will be
[48:30] impossible but Lord I've had this for 50
[48:33] years I've had this whatever it is he's
[48:36] still God so we'll we'll just sing
[48:41] then
[48:43] only
[48:47] be
[48:49] only
[48:52] be all things are are
[48:58] possible
[49:00] only
[49:03] believe
[49:05] only
[49:08] be

[50:06] Lord God bless
[50:24] you
[50:50] so when we got married we didn't have
[50:52] nothing nothing go housekeeping I think
[50:54] had2 or3 do
[50:55] so we rented a house it cost us $4 a
[50:59] month it was a little old two room place
[51:03] and someone give us an old folding bed I
[51:05] wonder if anybody ever seen an old
[51:06] folding bed and they gave us that and I
[51:10] went out to Sears and robu and got a
[51:12] little uh table with four chairs and it
[51:17] uh it wasn't painted you know and we got
[51:20] that on time and so then I went over to
[51:23] Mr Weber a junk dealer and bought a
[51:25] cooking stove I paid 75 cents for it and
[51:28] a dollar and something for grates to go
[51:29] in it we set up housekeeping I remember
[51:32] taking a painting a shamrock on the
[51:33] chairs when I paint him and oh we were
[51:37] happy we had one another so that's all
[51:40] necessary God by his mercy and his
[51:43] goodness was the happiest Little Couple
[51:45] could be on the earth I found this that
[51:49] happiness does not consist of how much
[51:51] of the world's good you own but how
[51:53] contented you are with a portion of led
[51:55] to
[51:57] you and after a while God came down and
[52:01] blessed our little home we had a little
[52:04] boy his name is Billy Paul it's in the
[52:08] service right now
[52:09] here and uh a little later from that
[52:12] about 11 months he blessed us again with
[52:15] a little girl called Sharon Rose taken
[52:19] from the word of the Rose of
[52:22] Sharon and I remember one day I I had
[52:26] saved up my money and I was going to
[52:28] take a little vacation going up to a
[52:31] place POA Lake to fish and on my road
[52:36] back and during this time I'm leaving
[52:37] out my conversion I was converted and
[52:40] was ordained by Dr Roy Davis in the
[52:42] Missionary Baptist Church and had become
[52:45] a minister and have the Tabernacle that
[52:47] I now preach in in
[52:50] Jeffersonville and um I was pastoring
[52:53] the little church and I no money I
[52:55] pastored the church 177 years and never
[52:58] got one penny I didn't believe in take
[53:01] there wasn't even an offering plate in
[53:02] it and what tithings I had from work and
[53:05] so forth had a little box on the back of
[53:07] the building said little sign on it in
[53:09] so much as you have done the least of
[53:11] these my little ones you have did it
[53:13] unto me and then that's how the church
[53:16] was paid for we had 10 years a loan to
[53:20] pay it and was paid off less than two
[53:22] years and I never took an offering of no
[53:25] kind
[53:26] and then I had a few dollars I saved up
[53:29] for my vacation she worked too at fine
[53:32] shirt factory a lovely darling
[53:35] girl and her grave is probably snowy
[53:40] today but she's still in my
[53:43] heart and I remember when she worked so
[53:47] hard to help me to have enough money to
[53:49] go up to this Lake to fish and when I
[53:52] was coming back from the lake I began to
[53:55] see coming into mishala South B
[53:59] Indiana and I be to notice cars that had
[54:02] signs on the back said Jesus
[54:04] only and I thought that sounds strange
[54:07] Jesus only and I began noticing those
[54:10] signs in his own anywhere from bicycles
[54:13] Fords Cadillacs and what more Jesus only
[54:17] and I followed some of them down and to
[54:19] come to a great big church and I found
[54:22] out they were Pentecostal I'd hurt of
[54:25] Pentecostal but they were a bunch of
[54:27] Holy Rollers they laid on the floor and
[54:29] froed their mouth and everything that
[54:32] they told me about so I didn't want
[54:34] nothing to do with it so I heard him all
[54:37] carrying on in there and I thought
[54:38] believe I'll just walk in so I stopped
[54:41] old forward and walked in and all the
[54:44] singing you ever heard in your life and
[54:47] I come to find out there were two great
[54:49] churches one of them called the PA of JC
[54:52] and the PA of w many of you people might
[54:54] remember those old ARG I think they're
[54:56] United call now I called the United
[54:58] Pentecostal Church well I listen to some
[55:02] of their teachers they were standing
[55:04] there oh they were teaching about Jesus
[55:06] and how great he was and how great the
[55:09] everything was and about a baptism of
[55:11] the Holy Ghost I thought what are they
[55:13] talking about and after a while somebody
[55:16] jumped up and started speaking with
[55:18] tongues well I never heard anything like
[55:20] that in my life and here comes some
[55:23] woman up through there running just as
[55:25] as hard as she could then all of them
[55:26] got up and started running and I thought
[55:29] well brother they sure ain't got no
[55:30] church manners screaming and shouting
[55:33] and carrying on I thought what a bunch
[55:36] this is but you know something about it
[55:39] longer I sit there the better I liked
[55:42] it there was something seemed to be real
[55:45] good and I began to watch him and it
[55:47] went on I thought I'll just bear with
[55:48] him a while because I I'm close the door
[55:50] if anything starts this rational I'll
[55:53] run out the door I know where my car
[55:55] Park just around the corner and I begin
[55:57] to hear some of them preachers as
[55:59] Scholars and students I thought that's
[56:02] fine so it comes supper time and said
[56:04] everybody come to supper but I thought
[56:06] wait a minute I got $1.75 to go home and
[56:10] I that's all I had for gasoline money
[56:12] just taking that to take me home I had
[56:14] my old Ford it was a pretty good old
[56:16] Ford it wasn't backslid it's just like
[56:18] this one out here just wore out and it I
[56:21] actually believe that Ford would go 30 m
[56:23] an hour but of course that was 15 this
[56:26] way and 15 this way you see put it
[56:28] together you had 30 and so it um I
[56:31] thought well that night I think I would
[56:34] go out and after the I was stay for the
[56:36] night's service and all he said all of
[56:38] the preachers regardless of denomination
[56:41] come to the platform well there's about
[56:44] 200 of us that there I went up and so he
[56:47] said now we haven't got time for y'all
[56:48] to preach he said just walk by and say
[56:51] who you are and where you from well it
[56:52] come my time I said William Brandon
[56:55] Baptist Jeffersonville Indiana walk by I
[56:58] hear all the rest of them calling
[57:00] themselves Pentecostal Pentecostal
[57:01] Pentecostal PFW PC PW I walked by I
[57:05] thought well I guess I'm the ugly
[57:07] duckling so I sat down waited that day
[57:10] that had fine young preachers out there
[57:12] and they preached powerfully and then
[57:15] they said the ones go to bring the
[57:16] message tonight is I believe they called
[57:18] them Elder and the ministers instead of
[57:20] Reverend it was Elder they brought an
[57:22] old colored man out there he had one
[57:24] these oldfashioned preachers coats I
[57:26] don't guess you ever seen one long
[57:29] pigeon tail in the back you know with a
[57:31] velvet collar and he had just a little
[57:33] white rim of hair around his head poor
[57:35] old fell cannot like this you know he
[57:37] stood there and he turned around and
[57:39] where all the preachers have been
[57:41] preaching about Jesus and the great how
[57:43] great he was and so forth that old man
[57:45] took his text from over in job where was
[57:48] you when I laid the foundation of the
[57:49] world or when the morning Stars sang
[57:52] together and the sons of God shouted for
[57:53] Joy the poor old fell I thought why
[57:55] didn't they put some of them young
[57:56] fellas up there to preach great the
[57:58] place is packed in jam and I thought why
[58:01] didn't they do that so then uh this old
[58:03] fell instead of preaching what was going
[58:05] on down here on Earth he begin to preach
[58:07] what was going on in the heaven all the
[58:09] time well he tuck him up at the
[58:11] beginning at the beginning of time and
[58:13] brought him back in the second coming
[58:15] down the horizontal rainbow I never
[58:17] heard such preaching in my life about
[58:19] that time the spirit hit him he jumped
[58:20] about that high and clicked his heels
[58:22] together throw his shoulders back went
[58:23] tipping off that plat for said you
[58:25] haven't got room enough up here for me
[58:26] to preach and he had more room than I
[58:28] got
[58:29] here I thought if that'll make an old
[58:31] man act like that what would he do if he
[58:33] got on me I don't know maybe I need some
[58:37] of that why he come out there I felt so
[58:39] sorry for the old fell but when he left
[58:41] I was feeling sorry for myself and I
[58:44] looked at him go off there I went out
[58:45] that night and I thought now the next
[58:48] morning I'm not go to let nobody know
[58:49] where who I am so I went that night I
[58:53] pressed my trousers I took the when I
[58:54] out in the cornfield to sleep I went out
[58:56] and bought me some stale rolls you I've
[58:58] bought a whole bunch of them for a
[58:59] nickel there's a hydrant down there I
[59:00] got some water so I know that would last
[59:02] me a little while so I got me some water
[59:04] and drank it and went and eat my rolls

[59:07] went out in the cornfield took the two
[59:09] seats and laid my little sear sucker
[59:11] trousers in there pressed them on the
[59:13] seat and that night I prayed prer all
[59:16] night I said Lord what is this I got
[59:17] into I never seen such religious people
[59:20] in my life and I said help me to know
[59:22] what this is all about and the next
[59:25] morning I got down there invited us for
[59:26] breakfast of course I wouldn't come eat
[59:27] with him because I had nothing to put in
[59:29] the offering and I just went back and
