[22:33] but oh if he
[22:34] just send the power just now

[43:53] starting at the 25th verse
[43:58] and we read behold
[44:00] a certain lawyer stood up and tempted
[44:03] jesus saying
[44:05] master
[44:06] what shall i do to inherit eternal life
[44:11] and jesus said to the lawyer
[44:14] what's written in the law how how do you
[44:16] read it
[44:17] and the lawyer answering said well thou
[44:20] shalt love the lord thy god
[44:22] with all thy heart remember thy thou in
[44:26] in this kind of english is personal it's
[44:28] not the you plural it's the you singular
[44:32] thou shalt love the lord thy god with
[44:34] all thy heart with all thy soul with all
[44:36] thy strength with all thy mind
[44:38] and
[44:39] thy neighbor is thyself
[44:42] and jesus
[44:44] said to the lawyer
[44:46] that's right
[44:48] do this
[44:49] and you'll live
[44:51] and please be seated
[44:55] this event in luke's gospel occurs just
[44:58] as the 72 are returning from having
[45:00] spread the good news
[45:02] some think that this unnamed lawyer
[45:04] might have been one of the 72 we don't
[45:07] know
[45:08] but the answer
[45:09] is telling
[45:11] the pentateuch the five books of moses
[45:13] genesis exodus etc contain the
[45:15] commandments of god
[45:17] the law for the descendants of jacob
[45:20] for israel
[45:22] we're told that there are 613 different
[45:24] commandments to observe
[45:27] yet we just read that jesus
[45:30] indicated there's really only two
[45:34] the others derive or depend on these two
[45:38] and one of those isn't even listed among
[45:40] the ten commandments
[45:45] during his final week of ministry in
[45:47] jerusalem
[45:49] a person variously described the
[45:52] different gospels say he was a scribe or
[45:54] a lawyer he heard jesus debating with
[45:57] the sadducees and informing them of the
[46:00] truth of the resurrection
[46:02] so this fellow then approached jesus we
[46:05] can read it together it's found in mark
[46:07] the 12th chapter
[46:09] starting at verse 28.
[46:13] and one of the scribes came and having
[46:16] heard jesus and the sadducees reasoning
[46:18] together
[46:19] and perceiving that jesus had answered
[46:22] the sadducees well
[46:24] asked jesus
[46:26] which is the first commandment of all
[46:30] and jesus answered the scribe
[46:33] the first
[46:34] of all the commandments is shema israel
[46:38] adonai eloheinu adonai
[46:40] god hear o israel
[46:43] the lord our god the lord is one
[46:47] thou shalt love the lord thy god with
[46:49] all thy heart
[46:51] and with all thy soul
[46:53] and with all thy mind
[46:55] and with all thy strength
[46:58] this is the first commandment
[47:00] well
[47:01] this is found in deuteronomy 6
[47:04] hero israel the lord our god is one lord
[47:08] thou shalt love the lord thy god with
[47:10] all thine heart
[47:11] with all thy soul
[47:13] with all thy might
[47:15] well note the change here
[47:17] in deuteronomy it says with all all thy
[47:20] might the hebrew word
[47:22] it means vehemently holy completely
[47:24] utterly
[47:26] but in the new testament it doesn't say
[47:28] that it says mind
[47:30] and strength
[47:33] it isn't just doing something like a
[47:35] trained animal or a robot it's not
[47:37] simply physical or external but it has
[47:40] to be
[47:42] motivated and come from love from within
[47:44] the heart and
[47:45] within the mind
[47:47] now jesus goes on past the question to
[47:49] the first he's answered the fellows
[47:50] question but he's not going to stop
[47:52] there
[47:53] he states that there's another law
[47:55] another commandment that's that similar
[47:58] of a like comprehensive nature as the
[48:01] first let's read on in mark and the
[48:03] second is like namely this thou shalt
[48:06] love my neighbor as thyself
[48:09] there's no other commandment greater
[48:11] than these
[48:13] well this isn't found in
[48:15] even in the book of deuteronomy it's
[48:17] found in leviticus
[48:20] thou shalt not avenge
[48:22] nor bear any grudge against the children
[48:24] of thy people
[48:26] but thou shalt love thy neighbor as
[48:28] thyself
[48:30] i am the lord
[48:32] this wasn't written on the tablets of
[48:34] stone that came down from the mountain
[48:37] it's not part of the decalogue it's
[48:39] about attitude
[48:41] it's about love and respect it's about
[48:43] recognition of the body
[48:45] as well as the individuals that comprise
[48:47] it
[48:49] well returning to the temple mark 12
[48:51] that fateful week
[48:53] the scribe said to jesus
[48:55] well
[48:56] master
[48:58] thou said the truth
[49:01] there is one god and none other but he
[49:04] and to love him with all the heart
[49:07] and with all the understanding
[49:10] and with all the soul the the hebrew
[49:12] word there's the the nephesh the nature
[49:14] of being that which has breath
[49:17] and
[49:18] with all the strength
[49:20] and to love his neighbor as himself
[49:23] is more than all whole burnt offerings
[49:26] and sacrifices i imagine he gestured
[49:29] when he said that they're standing in
[49:31] the temple square
[49:33] the altar where they're doing the
[49:34] sacrifices is right over there
[49:37] this is passover week
[49:40] this is a very important time of
[49:42] sacrifice a very important time of
[49:44] gathering and celebration and he's
[49:45] saying these two things are more
[49:47] important than this thing that we're
[49:48] doing right here at this time what a
[49:51] statement
[49:52] what a place what a context
[49:57] and when jesus saw that the scribe
[50:00] answered discreetly prudently with
[50:03] understanding
[50:05] jesus said to the scribe
[50:08] you're not far from the kingdom of
[50:10] god no man after that dare to ask jesus
[50:14] any question
[50:18] some of you here this evening
[50:21] some of you might be old enough to
[50:22] remember the civil rights movement of
[50:24] 1950s and 60s
[50:26] i remember parts of it quite clearly
[50:29] i remember one of the topics of
[50:30] conversation then could be summarized as
[50:33] you can't legislate love
[50:35] you can tell people they got to get
[50:37] along but you can't make them do it in
[50:38] their heart sorry about that
[50:42] well
[50:43] a few years ago
[50:45] i read a book dealing with persecution
[50:47] of christians in various places
[50:49] including china
[50:51] that china we know is governed by a
[50:53] totalitarian regime
[50:56] they're bent on retaining power they
[50:58] want to dominate at least their part of
[51:00] the world and they broke no dissent
[51:04] one point consistently made is this
[51:06] fellow that wrote the book was
[51:07] interviewing these different people that
[51:09] had been oppressed
[51:11] was that the chinese government
[51:13] didn't care at all what you thought
[51:16] what you believed meant nothing to them
[51:19] they wanted to know
[51:21] and control what you said
[51:24] what you did
[51:26] how you acted
[51:28] they would punish or reward you
[51:30] based on your behavior
[51:33] not on what you thought not on what you
[51:34] believed much like the law
[51:37] handed to moses because
[51:40] you can't legislate love
[51:44] yet the mosaic law demanded
[51:47] that very thing
[51:49] love of god
[51:51] love of your neighbor
[51:53] the history of israel is related to us
[51:56] in the old testament shows us what
[51:57] happens when you try to force internal
[52:00] behavior in this case love
[52:03] by rules
[52:05] obedience to god needs to derive from
[52:07] love of him not fear of reprisal
[52:13] what got me going on this topic was
[52:15] meditating on what our brother evans
[52:17] shared with us last wednesday night
[52:25] i woke up thursday morning with a single
[52:27] word in my mind
[52:29] onus
[52:31] i thought what's that
[52:33] so i looked up found several
[52:35] dictionaries several definitions
[52:37] some of them include a difficult
[52:39] responsibility of necessity
[52:41] a burden
[52:43] or obligation
[52:45] the burden of proof
[52:48] words related to onus are
[52:50] duty
[52:51] obligation
[52:53] responsibility
[52:56] commitment
[52:58] that last one commitment
[53:01] that really jumped out at me
[53:04] i had a friend he passed away about 20
[53:07] years ago and he and i worked on
[53:10] spacecraft projects together designing
[53:12] satellites and different things
[53:15] and some people would come around and
[53:16] say wow i'd like to be involved in a
[53:18] project like that
[53:20] my friend larry would respond that it
[53:22] takes commitment
[53:24] to get a spacecraft on orbit
[53:26] he illustrated the difference this way
[53:28] he said next time you have a breakfast
[53:30] of bacon and eggs consider this
[53:33] the chicken was involved
[53:35] but the pig was committed
[53:39] onus
[53:41] commitment
[53:45] another thing about the word onus it
[53:47] breaks down to on us
[53:51] the onus
[53:53] is on us
[53:54] i think the message to me was clear the
[53:56] onus commitment responsibility duty
[53:59] obligation burden
[54:02] is on us
[54:03] to love one another
[54:05] and in so doing
[54:07] to draw closer to him to break down the
[54:11] walls that separate us
[54:13] that separate me
[54:16] lyle johnson the walls i erect
[54:19] or that others erected might affect me
[54:24] can mean a burden
[54:26] well that sent me to the oldest writings
[54:29] we have
[54:30] in the new testament
[54:31] the book of galatians
[54:34] we'll read a little bit from chapter six
[54:36] just five verses
[54:38] verses one through five this is where
[54:40] we're told to bear one another's burdens
[54:42] yet we're also told that each must bear
[54:44] his own burden
[54:46] how does that work
[54:49] now as as i read this verses i'm going
[54:52] to inject commentary
[54:54] the commentaries from john wesley the
[54:56] one who recognizes the messenger to the
[54:58] sixth church age philadelphia
[55:01] i'll also read comments that brother
[55:03] branham made about two of these verses
[55:05] he didn't comment on the other three
[55:07] that that i was able to find
[55:12] galatians six beginning at verse one
[55:15] brethren
[55:16] if a man be overtaken in a fault
[55:19] by surprise
[55:21] ignorance or stress of temptation
[55:24] ye which are spiritual
[55:26] who continue to live and walk by the
[55:28] spirit restore such and one
[55:31] by reproof instruction or exhortation
[55:35] everyone who can ought to help herein
[55:38] only in the spirit of meekness
[55:41] this is essential to a spiritual man and
[55:44] in this lies the whole force of the cure
[55:47] considering thyself
[55:49] the plural is beautifully changed into
[55:51] the singular
[55:53] let each take heed to himself
[55:55] lest thou also be tempted
[55:58] temptation easily and swiftly passes
[56:01] from one to another
[56:03] especially if a man endeavors to cure
[56:05] another without preserving
[56:08] his own meekness
[56:10] bear ye one another's burdens
[56:13] sympathize with and assist each other
[56:16] in all your weaknesses
[56:18] grievances
[56:20] trials
[56:21] and so fulfill the law of christ
[56:24] the law of christ an uncommon expression
[56:28] is the law of love this our lord
[56:30] peculiarly recommends
[56:32] this he makes
[56:34] the distinguishing mark
[56:36] of his disciples
[56:38] we'll get back to this law of christ in
[56:41] a few minutes now here's something
[56:42] brother brandon said about verse 2 and
[56:44] in fact he said it
[56:46] in february of 1961 and i believe he was
[56:48] standing right about here
[56:51] when he said these very words
[56:54] he says now put water on this desert and
[56:56] leave it here for several years that
[56:58] cactus would come up with leaves on it
[57:00] be soft that's the way the churches get
[57:03] sometimes when we run without spiritual
[57:05] water
[57:06] we just roll up real tight sticking one
[57:09] another
[57:10] but put water on it it softens out
[57:12] and it's flexible
[57:14] and i think that's what we have churches
[57:16] for is where we can have spiritual water
[57:18] that keeps us sweet and soft
[57:21] so that god can use us
[57:23] and flexible and not sticking one
[57:24] another but just laying softly and
[57:26] sweetly upon the other fellow children
[57:29] each one of us bearing another's burdens
[57:31] and so fulfill the law of christ
[57:36] later in 1961 he spoke in early november
[57:39] just after his mother had passed away
[57:43] he said many of you have sent in cards
[57:45] from different places and saying
[57:47] sympathy cards putting some money to
[57:49] help out on the expenses and things
[57:51] never realized that a little gift to
[57:54] someone or a little thing like that
[57:56] would mean so much
[57:58] until it come to me
[58:01] god richly bless you i'm so glad to know
[58:03] that i'm part of the people that has
[58:04] this kind of a spirit
[58:06] i'm so glad to know that i'm your
[58:08] brother
[58:10] and if i had was was eloquent enough or
[58:13] had the speech i'd like to just tell
[58:15] each one of you what i think
[58:17] but i can't do that i don't even know
[58:19] how to express it
[58:20] but i'm saying it this way that that you
[58:22] each one would know what i mean
[58:25] i thank you
[58:26] from the depths of my heart and how the
[58:28] scriptures fulfilled
[58:30] bear you one another's burdens
[58:32] and so fulfilled
[58:34] the law of christ that's from the
[58:35] testimony of a true witness
[58:38] continuing in galatians 2 verse 3
[58:42] for if a man think himself to be
[58:43] something
[58:44] above his brethren or by any strength of
[58:47] his own when he is nothing he deceives
[58:50] himself
[58:51] he alone
[58:52] will bear their burdens who knows
[58:54] himself to be nothing
[58:56] but let every man prove his own work
[59:00] narrowly examine all he is
[59:03] and all he does
[59:05] and then shall he have rejoicing in
[59:06] himself alone
[59:08] he will find in himself matter of
[59:11] rejoicing if his works are right before
[59:13] god
[59:14] and not in another
[59:17] not in glorying over others wesley tells
[59:19] us
[59:21] for every man shall bear his own burden
[59:24] and that day
[59:25] shall give an account of himself to god
[59:29] the link i found to verse 5 where
[59:31] brother branham spoke a little bit
[59:33] regarding this he doesn't actually quote
[59:35] the verse
[59:36] i found it through the through the hub
[59:39] but it reflects the thought i think
[59:42] it's from the greatest battle ever
[59:44] fought
[59:45] he says one time when caesar after a
[59:48] great battle he said i want my most
[59:51] famous warrior to ride by me in this
[59:53] great celebration of triumph over our
[59:55] enemy
[59:56] and every one of the officers trimmed
[59:58] their plumes and polished their armor
[1:00:01] and their shields and they they marched
[1:00:03] by whoever so correctly you know as real
[1:00:06] soldiers is after a while he says a
[1:00:09] little old fella came by cut he just
[1:00:12] kind of looked up and started on like
[1:00:13] that
[1:00:15] caesar said wait a minute wait a minute
[1:00:17] you
[1:00:18] not even dressed like an officer said
[1:00:20] come here
[1:00:21] said where'd you get them scars at
[1:00:24] he said
[1:00:26] out on the battlefield
[1:00:28] caesar said
[1:00:30] climb up here you're the guy i want to
[1:00:32] set by me
[1:00:34] why
[1:00:35] he showed he'd been in battle
[1:00:38] oh god have mercy on a man that can cut
[1:00:40] his hand on a sardine can and get a
[1:00:42] citation
[1:00:44] i want to be battle-scarred as paul said
[1:00:46] i bear in my body the marks of jesus
[1:00:48] christ
[1:00:49] that's why i want to battle on the field
[1:00:52] someday when our great chief captain
[1:00:54] shall come who armored us who gave us
[1:00:56] the armor of god the holy ghost give us
[1:00:57] his word to fight with stand out there
[1:01:00] when our great chief captain comes
[1:01:02] riding in i want to step up on the
[1:01:04] chariot and ride home with him
[1:01:07] don't you
[1:01:09] and when the battle's over we'll wear
[1:01:11] the crown oh my oh soldiers of the cross
[1:01:13] this morning pull that arm of faith out
[1:01:15] there get a hold of this weapon
[1:01:20] so the burdens we share
[1:01:22] are those where we support
[1:01:24] help
[1:01:25] encourage one another
[1:01:28] the onus is on us
[1:01:31] the burden we bear alone
[1:01:33] is answering for our personal conduct
[1:01:36] our thoughts our motives our actions
[1:01:39] as we heard sunday
[1:01:40] let's approach that judgment seat while
[1:01:42] it's sprinkled with the blood of our
[1:01:44] sacrifice jesus which cleanses us from
[1:01:47] all sin
[1:01:48] all unrighteousness
[1:01:50] and makes that seed of judgment a seed
[1:01:52] of mercy
[1:02:00] speaking of sunday what effect
[1:02:03] did john's experiences on the isle of
[1:02:05] patmos have on him
[1:02:08] the visions that when they were recorded
[1:02:10] for in the book that we call the
[1:02:11] revelation of jesus christ we heard two
[1:02:13] sermons about that on sunday
[1:02:16] and that was just from a fragment of
[1:02:17] that vision just a portion of chapter
[1:02:20] four
[1:02:22] and after experiencing all of this
[1:02:26] what's the conclusion
[1:02:28] what did john get from that experience
[1:02:32] the man who had those visions
[1:02:36] here's what brother branham said about
[1:02:37] it
[1:02:39] from jesus christ the same yesterday
[1:02:40] today and forever he said john after he
[1:02:43] returned from the isle of patmos out in
[1:02:45] the aegean sea only thing he could say
[1:02:46] was little children
[1:02:49] love one another
[1:02:53] he found that there was something real
[1:02:57] and that was the disciple that wanted to
[1:02:59] call fire down on the city and burn them
[1:03:01] up because they wouldn't give them
[1:03:02] nothing to eat
[1:03:04] but how christ got a hold of them and
[1:03:05] let them know you don't know what kind
[1:03:07] of a spirit you have
[1:03:08] john he said trying to destroy life we
[1:03:11] come to save life
[1:03:13] that's what we have to have is love for
[1:03:15] one another
[1:03:19] john wanted to call fire down from
[1:03:21] heaven and destroy a city
[1:03:24] john the disciple that we associate with
[1:03:26] love
[1:03:30] the event referred to
[1:03:32] as jesus was on the road to jerusalem
[1:03:35] his final journey on earth
[1:03:37] ascending to the climax of his mission
[1:03:40] to redeem us you and me
[1:03:43] back to the father
[1:03:45] we read about this in
[1:03:47] luke chapter 9.
[1:03:50] starting at verse 51
[1:03:52] it came to pass
[1:03:54] when the time was come that jesus should
[1:03:56] be received up that's an interesting way
[1:03:58] to put it
[1:04:00] he's going to calvary he's going to
[1:04:01] suffer gethsemane all those things that
[1:04:04] lay before him but
[1:04:06] luke tells us
[1:04:07] it's he's going to the time when he
[1:04:09] should be received up he's looking
[1:04:11] beyond the suffering to the victory
[1:04:13] he steadfastly without wavering
[1:04:17] jesus set his face
[1:04:19] to go to jerusalem he knew what weighted
[1:04:22] him there
[1:04:24] and sent messengers before his face his
[1:04:26] disciples right and they went and
[1:04:28] entered into a village of the samaritans
[1:04:30] to make ready for jesus
[1:04:35] why would he think
[1:04:38] that the samaritans would receive him
[1:04:42] samaritans recall the woman at the well
[1:04:45] the two-day revival in samaria where
[1:04:47] they constrained him to stay many
[1:04:49] believed he was the messiah the anointed
[1:04:51] one perhaps that's the reason that he
[1:04:53] thought we'll just stop here in scenario
[1:04:58] they did not receive jesus
[1:05:00] why
[1:05:02] because his face
[1:05:04] was as though he would go to
[1:05:06] jerusalem
[1:05:08] remember the samaritans celebrated and
[1:05:11] worshiped on mount gerizim they did not
[1:05:13] recognize jerusalem you recall the
[1:05:15] conversation with a woman at the well
[1:05:17] they have their own set of priests their
[1:05:19] own sacrifices their own way of going
[1:05:22] about all these things yet they claim to
[1:05:24] embrace
[1:05:25] the books of moses as
[1:05:27] the basis of their religion
[1:05:30] so jesus is determined to go to
[1:05:32] jerusalem and the samaritans don't
[1:05:34] recognize that they didn't have dealings
[1:05:36] with each other the jews and the
[1:05:37] samaritans weren't buddies
[1:05:41] when his disciples
[1:05:43] james and john saw that they didn't
[1:05:45] receive him they said lord
[1:05:48] will you that we command fire to come
[1:05:50] down from heaven and consume them just
[1:05:52] like elijah did
[1:05:54] oh
[1:05:55] you want us to do that lord
[1:05:57] the jewish people and the samaritans
[1:06:00] there wasn't a lot of love between them
[1:06:03] but jesus turned and rebuked james and
[1:06:06] john
[1:06:08] and said
[1:06:09] you don't know what kind of spirit you
[1:06:11] have
[1:06:12] the son of man does not come to destroy
[1:06:15] men's lives
[1:06:17] but to save them
[1:06:20] jesus and his disciples went to another
[1:06:22] village
[1:06:25] well back to the visions on patmos the
[1:06:26] effect of john on the visions he
[1:06:28] experienced
[1:06:30] it wasn't deep mysteries john didn't
[1:06:33] after that be sending letters and saying
[1:06:35] oh i've got this revelation of this and
[1:06:37] i've got this revelation of that
[1:06:39] it wasn't amazing doctrines
[1:06:42] it was simply
[1:06:44] love
[1:06:45] one another
[1:06:47] is this the law of christ
[1:06:50] let's read the opening lines of john's
[1:06:53] second letter
[1:06:58] sorry i didn't keep up with that the
[1:07:00] elder under the elect lady
[1:07:03] that's the called out the church
[1:07:05] the bride
[1:07:07] and her children
[1:07:09] that includes us
[1:07:12] whom i love in the truth
[1:07:14] the truth jesus said i am the way the
[1:07:17] truth and the life no man comes to the
[1:07:19] father but by me whom i love and the
[1:07:21] truth and not i only but also all they
[1:07:24] that have known the
[1:07:26] truth for the truth sake
[1:07:30] for jesus sake which dwelleth in us
[1:07:34] and shall be with us forever
[1:07:37] that's jesus in the form of the holy
[1:07:39] spirit i will never leave you nor
[1:07:40] forsake you
[1:07:42] he goes on
[1:07:44] grace be with you
[1:07:46] but this includes me
[1:07:48] grace
[1:07:49] be to you and mercy
[1:07:51] and peace
[1:07:53] from god the father from the lord jesus
[1:07:56] christ the son of the father and truth
[1:07:58] and love
[1:08:01] i rejoice greatly when i found of thy
[1:08:03] children walking in truth as we have
[1:08:06] received a commandment from the father
[1:08:09] the commandment from the father what
[1:08:10] commandment is that
[1:08:13] and now i beseech thee lady
[1:08:16] this is a singular
[1:08:18] i beseech thee lady
[1:08:21] he's addressing
[1:08:22] this to the believers the church as a
[1:08:25] body
[1:08:26] as one
[1:08:27] body
[1:08:28] not as though i wrote a new commandment
[1:08:30] unto thee but that which we had from the
[1:08:33] beginning
[1:08:35] that we love one another and breaks it
[1:08:38] right down to the individual again
[1:08:41] each member of that body
[1:08:43] the onus
[1:08:44] is on us
[1:08:47] schofield puts a very interesting note
[1:08:49] here if you have a schofield bible and
[1:08:51] you read
[1:08:52] second john it takes all of a half a
[1:08:54] page so there's a note on the bottom of
[1:08:57] it
[1:08:59] where he's talking about the law of
[1:09:00] christ a summary of it he says
[1:09:03] the the new law of christ is the divine
[1:09:06] love as wrought into the renewed heart
[1:09:09] by the holy spirit
[1:09:11] and outflowing in the energy of the
[1:09:13] spirit
[1:09:14] unforced and spontaneous toward the
[1:09:16] objects of the divine love
[1:09:18] it is therefore the law of liberty
[1:09:20] in contrast with the external law of
[1:09:22] moses
[1:09:24] and this is the part that
[1:09:25] jumped out at me
[1:09:28] moses law
[1:09:30] demands
[1:09:31] love
[1:09:34] law
[1:09:35] is
[1:09:36] love
[1:09:38] and so takes the place of the external
[1:09:40] law by fulfilling it
[1:09:43] it's the law written in the heart under
[1:09:46] the new covenant
[1:09:49] i think this is what we mean when we say
[1:09:51] that christ fulfilled the law
[1:09:54] the external law is replaced by the
[1:09:56] internal one the external law had at its
[1:09:59] heart and foundation the requirement
[1:10:02] that we love god and love our neighbor
[1:10:05] didn't tell us how
[1:10:08] it measured our success and compliance
[1:10:10] by our external actions
[1:10:12] just like the example i gave early about
[1:10:14] the chinese if you break the sabbath
[1:10:16] we're going to take out and stone you
[1:10:17] why
[1:10:18] because you don't love god
[1:10:21] murder steal sexual sins
[1:10:24] you aren't loving your neighbor
[1:10:27] ignore your parents you don't honor them
[1:10:30] you just aren't showing love
[1:10:34] now
[1:10:35] we still look at outward actions now we
[1:10:37] call them fruits or works
[1:10:41] but the motive
[1:10:43] is a response
[1:10:45] to god's love to us the motive is not
[1:10:48] fear of a reprisal if we don't
[1:10:51] we do it because it pleases him
[1:10:55] right
[1:10:56] heather my wife dresses as she does
[1:11:00] because she believes it pleases the lord
[1:11:04] and heather loves the lord
[1:11:06] she desires to please him
[1:11:09] she understands this is one of the
[1:11:11] things that pleases him
[1:11:13] so she doesn't
[1:11:14] now the fact that i'm happy too is
[1:11:16] important
[1:11:18] but it's not as important
[1:11:20] nor should it be
[1:11:24] how do we have this love this response
[1:11:26] to god's love
[1:11:29] by accepting jesus sacrifice
[1:11:32] yielding our will to his
[1:11:34] such that he fills us with his spirit to
[1:11:36] motivate and guide and lead and
[1:11:40] influence us
[1:11:41] by being obedient
[1:11:43] to his word
[1:11:48] when we fail
[1:11:51] as we will and continue to do so
[1:11:54] we seek his mercy
[1:11:56] and we seek his forgiveness
[1:11:59] and we extend
[1:12:00] the same mercy and the same forgiveness
[1:12:04] to others
[1:12:08] were to be his little children
[1:12:10] right
[1:12:11] trusting
[1:12:13] but also
[1:12:15] and very importantly
[1:12:17] growing
[1:12:18] he didn't say
[1:12:20] be and remain as little children
[1:12:23] paul scolds those who don't grow and
[1:12:25] always need to repeat kindergarten
[1:12:27] lessons
[1:12:29] love
[1:12:30] one another
[1:12:32] the onus
[1:12:33] is on us
[1:12:35] in his final evening with his disciples
[1:12:37] jesus hammers his point home
[1:12:40] again and again
[1:12:46] john 15
[1:12:48] we read
[1:12:50] starting at verse 9 as the father hath
[1:12:52] loved me
[1:12:54] so have i loved you
[1:12:56] continue me ye in my love
[1:13:00] how
[1:13:02] if you keep my commandments
[1:13:05] plural
[1:13:06] you shall abide in my love
[1:13:09] even as i have kept my father's
[1:13:11] commandments
[1:13:13] and abide in his love
[1:13:16] these things have i spoken unto you that
[1:13:18] my joy
[1:13:20] the joy of the lord is our strength that
[1:13:22] my joy might remain in you and that your
[1:13:25] joy might be full
[1:13:28] okay what are your commandments then
[1:13:30] lord this is my commandment
[1:13:33] we've gone from plural to singular
[1:13:36] this is my commandment that you love one
[1:13:38] another
[1:13:40] with what kind of love as i have loved
[1:13:43] you
[1:13:45] greater love hath no man than this
[1:13:47] that a man lay down his life for his
[1:13:49] friends
[1:13:50] just like the 613 commandments under
[1:13:54] moses were expressed in two commandments
[1:13:57] so christ commandments to us under this
[1:13:59] new covenant are reduced to one
[1:14:01] which he expounds upon so we can see the
[1:14:04] degree of the love that he had for us
[1:14:06] and that he expects
[1:14:08] us to have
[1:14:10] you're my friends
[1:14:13] if
[1:14:14] you do whatsoever i command you
[1:14:19] our relationship is not that of a
[1:14:21] servant
[1:14:23] but of a friend if we're obedient
[1:14:28] that's kind of a curious thing in other
[1:14:30] words both relationships whether you're
[1:14:32] a servant or a friend they both require
[1:14:35] obedience
[1:14:37] but the servant because he must obey the
[1:14:40] one to whom he owes servitude
[1:14:42] but the friend
[1:14:43] because he desires to please his buddy
[1:14:46] he desires to please his friend you want
[1:14:48] to obey christ because he's your friend
[1:14:51] and you want to please him or do you
[1:14:52] want to obey christ because he's going
[1:14:54] to smack you if you don't
[1:15:02] i'm sorry
[1:15:03] henceforth i call you not servants for
[1:15:05] the servant knoweth not what is the lord
[1:15:07] doeth i have called you friends for all
[1:15:09] things i have heard of my father i've
[1:15:10] made known unto you
[1:15:12] you have not chosen me but i have chosen
[1:15:15] you
[1:15:16] and ordained you
[1:15:18] that you should go
[1:15:20] and bring forth fruit
[1:15:21] and that your fruit should remain that
[1:15:23] whatsoever you shall ask the father in
[1:15:25] my name he may give it you these things
[1:15:27] i command you
[1:15:30] that she love
[1:15:31] one another
[1:15:34] love one another
[1:15:37] i'm going to shift gears here for just a
[1:15:39] moment
[1:15:40] well
[1:15:41] a few minutes
[1:15:43] and talk about sickness and healing
[1:15:47] it's intrinsically related to the topic
[1:15:49] of love
[1:15:51] and to the onus that's on us regarding
[1:15:54] it
[1:15:56] i had nine excerpts i'm not going to
[1:15:57] read all nine
[1:15:59] various messages from 56 through 64
[1:16:01] where brother banner mentioned the
[1:16:03] sickest body he knew i'll read just a
[1:16:06] few of them
[1:16:07] now he was talking about denominations
[1:16:10] and creeds and so forth that separated
[1:16:11] people these days
[1:16:13] i think it might have a little more
[1:16:15] impact if when we hear the word
[1:16:16] denomination we think faction
[1:16:20] if we hear creeds we think
[1:16:23] interpretations
[1:16:27] he says but since you have included me
[1:16:28] in your rank and this is at the azusa
[1:16:31] street
[1:16:32] celebration revival back in 1956 i'm
[1:16:35] trying my best to stand mutually between
[1:16:37] the different denominations
[1:16:39] factions and saying we're brethren
[1:16:43] i love all the denominations i'm trying
[1:16:45] to stand in the gap like that and say
[1:16:47] we're brothers together
[1:16:49] and i believe that if god will let me to
[1:16:52] have something to do with uniting the
[1:16:54] body of christ i think that's the
[1:16:56] sickest body i know of
[1:16:58] we have these prayer requests for
[1:17:00] healing
[1:17:01] almost every service
[1:17:03] but the sickest body that i know of
[1:17:06] is the body of jesus christ the greatest
[1:17:09] divine healing that needs to be done
[1:17:10] tonight is the body of christ to be
[1:17:12] healed into one person
[1:17:15] that's from the lamb and the dove
[1:17:17] in 1957 hear ye him
[1:17:20] now notice just a few minutes i want to
[1:17:22] say this before i start preaching
[1:17:25] the greatest need of healing tonight and
[1:17:27] the sickest body i know of in all the
[1:17:28] world is the body of jesus christ the
[1:17:31] church
[1:17:32] it's horribly sick it's broke up
[1:17:35] scattered
[1:17:37] it needs healing
[1:17:38] may god send the holy spirit in such a
[1:17:40] power to the whole body of christ will
[1:17:43] be brought together bond with love and
[1:17:46] unity
[1:17:47] until then you'll see things happen you
[1:17:48] never thought of before jesus will come
[1:17:52] it'll all be over
[1:17:56] later in 57 i think too much stress has
[1:17:59] been put on divine healing
[1:18:01] i think the sickest body i know of is
[1:18:02] the body of the lord jesus christ it's
[1:18:04] needing healing
[1:18:06] and it takes conventions like this where
[1:18:08] men have different denominations
[1:18:11] interpretations
[1:18:13] set together
[1:18:14] as brothers
[1:18:16] that's what does the healing the great
[1:18:18] ransom church of god should be one heart
[1:18:20] and one accord
[1:18:22] god will live in it that's from faith
[1:18:24] once delivered to the saint
[1:18:27] i want to give you two more
[1:18:29] brief excerpts here because he's talking
[1:18:31] about
[1:18:32] the bomb that heals the body
[1:18:34] and all the days of our life 1959 this
[1:18:37] is a sick world isn't it
[1:18:41] but you know it's the sickest body on
[1:18:42] earth i say this with reverence not to
[1:18:44] be sacrilegious god forgive me if i say
[1:18:47] wrong
[1:18:47] the body of jesus christ
[1:18:50] it needs healing
[1:18:51] and it can only be healed by brotherly
[1:18:54] love
[1:18:56] that's the sickest body i know of all
[1:18:58] broke to pieces and tore up god i pray
[1:19:00] for the healing of that body
[1:19:02] and you're the members of that body
[1:19:04] so god heal you physically and
[1:19:06] spiritually
[1:19:07] make you what you should be
[1:19:13] brotherly love
[1:19:15] the onus
[1:19:17] is on us
[1:19:19] there's another component to that
[1:19:20] healing as well
[1:19:24] this is uh
[1:19:26] from go wake jesus in 63 i announce i'm
[1:19:29] going to have a meeting the first
[1:19:30] thought is divine healing
[1:19:32] but there's more to the ministry than
[1:19:34] divine healing the sickest body i know
[1:19:37] of is the body of jesus christ it needs
[1:19:39] spiritual healing
[1:19:40] there's only one bomb i know that will
[1:19:42] heal and that's the word
[1:19:44] that's a sick body that we want to stand
[1:19:46] up in the strength and vitamin power of
[1:19:48] the gospel
[1:19:49] and that's why you use much of the time
[1:19:50] now in trying to strengthen the church
[1:19:52] by the word
[1:19:56] brother branham was consistent with this
[1:19:58] from the 1950s until his passing
[1:20:02] what about divisions over
[1:20:03] interpretations
[1:20:05] doesn't unity mean to be of one mind
[1:20:09] doesn't that mean like being in lockstep
[1:20:12] in total agreement
[1:20:13] amos said can two walk together
[1:20:16] except they'd be agreed
[1:20:19] what does this mean
[1:20:22] what is agreement
[1:20:25] again i want to read something from
[1:20:28] taking sides with jesus
[1:20:31] i'm very grateful that in these days i
[1:20:33] see it's got little satellites to it
[1:20:35] brother branham is talking about the
[1:20:37] church in jeffersonville that there's
[1:20:39] other sister churches
[1:20:42] uh brother cruz here his eldersburg
[1:20:44] group the brother back there just taken
[1:20:46] brother snelling's place at utica
[1:20:47] brother ruddle up there brother junior
[1:20:49] jackson those precious boys who were
[1:20:51] fine men wonderful men of god they
[1:20:53] preached this message now they may one
[1:20:55] might disagree just a little upon
[1:20:58] something or other he says that's only
[1:21:00] human amongst a group of ministers yet
[1:21:02] and if ministers have a little
[1:21:04] difference that one that won't be a
[1:21:06] shadow of difference in it
[1:21:08] maybe one might say i believe that the
[1:21:10] millennium will come and jesus will be
[1:21:12] on a white horse
[1:21:14] others say i believe when he comes he'll
[1:21:16] come in a white cloud
[1:21:18] you get those two guys together see what
[1:21:20] happens right well as long as they
[1:21:22] believe he's coming
[1:21:24] that's the main thing see no matter how
[1:21:26] he's coming just they believe he's
[1:21:28] coming and making ready for it
[1:21:32] it's from taking sides with jesus
[1:21:34] so we need to be able to distinguish
[1:21:36] between the big picture
[1:21:38] the the genesis to revelation thread
[1:21:41] and the small details
[1:21:43] remember
[1:21:45] i was going to tell you about an event
[1:21:46] that occurred when jesus was passing
[1:21:48] through samaria on his way to jerusalem
[1:21:50] for the last time
[1:21:53] how he was rejected in a village and
[1:21:55] james and john wanted to destroy the
[1:21:57] town
[1:22:01] you realize
[1:22:03] the samaritans did not accept jerusalem
[1:22:05] as a place of worship
[1:22:07] nor did they accept the sacrifices made
[1:22:10] there
[1:22:11] nor
[1:22:13] the jewish priesthood
[1:22:17] yet they claim to follow the law handed
[1:22:18] down by moses
[1:22:22] we just read about disagreements over
[1:22:24] little things
[1:22:25] i want to read you what happened next in
[1:22:27] samaria after that event where they were
[1:22:30] rejected
[1:22:32] this is found in luke 17 you'll you'll
[1:22:35] find that
[1:22:36] the gospels aren't necessarily
[1:22:38] chronologic
[1:22:40] so luke 17 11 it came to pass as jesus
[1:22:42] went to jerusalem
[1:22:44] it's the same journey he passed through
[1:22:46] the midst of samaria and galilee
[1:22:50] and as he entered into a certain village
[1:22:51] there met him ten men
[1:22:54] that were lepers
[1:22:55] they stood afar off as required by the
[1:22:58] quarantine rules of their day they were
[1:23:00] at least six feet away
[1:23:04] and the group of lepers
[1:23:06] lifted up their voices
[1:23:08] they weren't whispering said jesus
[1:23:10] master have mercy on us
[1:23:14] ten lepers
[1:23:17] and when jesus saw them
[1:23:19] he said to the group of lepers go show
[1:23:22] yourselves to the priests
[1:23:25] he didn't say you're healed
[1:23:27] he didn't pray for them he didn't lay
[1:23:29] hands on them he didn't approach them
[1:23:31] they stood afar off and the law of moses
[1:23:35] of leprosy and so forth is when you're
[1:23:37] cleansed you go to show yourself to the
[1:23:38] priests or certain sacrifices and so
[1:23:40] forth jesus just said go show yourself
[1:23:42] to the priest
[1:23:44] to the priests
[1:23:48] there's something very striking going on
[1:23:49] here it came to pass that as they went
[1:23:52] as they went
[1:23:54] they were cleansed
[1:23:58] whoa what's going on and one of the
[1:24:00] group of lepers
[1:24:02] when he saw that he was healed
[1:24:04] he turned back
[1:24:06] and with a loud voice
[1:24:09] glorified god he got a little emotional
[1:24:12] a great credit where it was due he
[1:24:14] expressed his thanks
[1:24:17] remember jesus didn't tell them to show
[1:24:19] the priests that they were healed
[1:24:21] he didn't even proclaim their healing he
[1:24:23] said nothing about it
[1:24:26] they asked him for mercy
[1:24:28] and he directed them to the local
[1:24:30] priests
[1:24:32] the local priests
[1:24:34] and the former leper
[1:24:36] fell down on his face at jesus feet
[1:24:39] probably grabbing by the ankles
[1:24:42] giving him thanks
[1:24:45] the healed man was a samaritan
[1:24:48] we can probably infer that the other
[1:24:50] nine were as well we don't know that
[1:24:55] there's something there related to what
[1:24:57] we're talking about here jesus answering
[1:24:59] said
[1:25:00] were there not ten cleansed
[1:25:04] where are the other nine
[1:25:06] they are not found that return to give
[1:25:08] glory to god save this
[1:25:10] stranger
[1:25:12] this non-jew
[1:25:14] this samaritan this one who doesn't
[1:25:17] realize that i'm about to be the
[1:25:18] ultimate sacrifice for his sins at the
[1:25:21] very place that he scoffs and he rejects
[1:25:26] jesus said to him arise go thy way thy
[1:25:29] faith has made thee whole
[1:25:31] he's a samaritan so what priest is he
[1:25:34] going to go to
[1:25:36] a samaritan priest
[1:25:38] he's not going to go to a jewish priest
[1:25:40] he's not going to go to the one that
[1:25:42] sacrifices at the temple he's going to
[1:25:44] go to the guy that sacrifices on mount
[1:25:46] gerizim
[1:25:48] that's what jesus sent him go show
[1:25:50] yourself to the priests
[1:25:54] had no dealings with each other the
[1:25:55] samaritans and the jews what love is
[1:25:57] this
[1:25:58] what grace what mercy
[1:26:02] i'm going to end tonight with another
[1:26:04] excerpt from one brother random sermons
[1:26:06] it's a little long
[1:26:08] but
[1:26:09] i think we're told in it what we need to
[1:26:11] do
[1:26:12] now you who know me realize that i'm not
[1:26:15] one who often reads a lot of excerpts
[1:26:17] from brother random's message it's
[1:26:19] pretty unusual for me but
[1:26:21] but tonight's unique
[1:26:24] there'll never be another wednesday
[1:26:26] august 25 2021. this is the only one
[1:26:29] they'll ever be
[1:26:31] so we can do things a little differently
[1:26:33] approach things a little differently
[1:26:35] is that okay
[1:26:37] this is from 1955 and it's a strange
[1:26:40] title on this message
[1:26:42] the seal of the
[1:26:44] antichrist
[1:26:48] he says pentecostal preachers sometimes
[1:26:52] and men will go downtown you see them on
[1:26:54] the streets sometime will just jump into
[1:26:56] traffic
[1:26:57] and consider your friends if you see
[1:26:59] them fixing to get a ticket i don't care
[1:27:01] who he is put a nickel and don't let
[1:27:03] them be fine
[1:27:04] understand what's going on here these
[1:27:06] are these are people not necessarily
[1:27:08] part of brother branham's church or any
[1:27:10] other particular church they're just
[1:27:12] they're just people that want to be
[1:27:13] witnesses for jesus christ and so they
[1:27:16] stand on the street corner and unlike in
[1:27:18] tucson in 2021 they're not panhandling
[1:27:20] they're not asking for anything they're
[1:27:22] giving
[1:27:23] they're trying to give the gift of life
[1:27:26] and he says
[1:27:27] this you recognize this fellow and you
[1:27:30] recognize oh that's his car over there
[1:27:32] and it's parked and the parking meter
[1:27:33] has popped up and says expired
[1:27:36] he says
[1:27:37] go put money in the meter
[1:27:39] don't let the guy get a ticket he's
[1:27:41] trying to do good help him out he's your
[1:27:44] brother
[1:27:45] he may not be a member of your church he
[1:27:47] may not see things the way you do but
[1:27:49] he's doing the right thing you do the
[1:27:51] right thing help him out
[1:27:56] and not just that he says even in
[1:27:58] everything
[1:28:00] and he says what it'll grow on you
[1:28:04] and then
[1:28:06] i found this to be a little strange and
[1:28:08] it really struck me with onus
[1:28:11] try
[1:28:12] to be good to one another
[1:28:16] try if if if when my son was really
[1:28:19] little and he said daddy i can't pick
[1:28:21] this up and say try son and
[1:28:24] he'd try he'd put effort he put focus he
[1:28:26] put strength
[1:28:28] that's what he was trying to do he's
[1:28:30] wanting to do it
[1:28:32] right he's trying to please me right
[1:28:35] try
[1:28:36] to be good to one another try
[1:28:39] to shake hands
[1:28:40] and be friendly
[1:28:42] and nice
[1:28:44] try to be nice
[1:28:46] tear down all the walls of partition
[1:28:49] around you
[1:28:50] malice and difference
[1:28:52] ungodliness tear it down
[1:28:56] keep doing good to one another
[1:29:00] every time you meet one another
[1:29:03] make yourself be good to one another
[1:29:07] and the first thing you know
[1:29:09] it'll go around you
[1:29:11] till a bundle of love will wrap you up
[1:29:14] he says hallelujah that's the marking of
[1:29:16] god remember this is the seal of the
[1:29:19] antichrist the mark of the beast he's
[1:29:21] saying this is the mark of god
[1:29:26] it's the opposite
[1:29:28] love one another be kind to one another
[1:29:35] what did he say to little old david when
[1:29:36] he was up there she said your soul was
[1:29:39] wrapped in a bundle of love amen when
[1:29:41] abigail the great woman that met david
[1:29:43] said we know your enemies will be flung
[1:29:45] out like a sling that's right said
[1:29:47] because you're wrapped in the bundle of
[1:29:49] the love of god
[1:29:52] he says
[1:29:53] he's talking now from corinthians 13 he
[1:29:56] says brother where there's prophecies
[1:29:59] it'll cease
[1:30:00] where there's healings
[1:30:02] it'll fail
[1:30:03] where there's all this
[1:30:05] knowledge of the mysteries and so forth
[1:30:08] it'll cease
[1:30:09] but when that which is perfect has come
[1:30:13] he says
[1:30:14] the love of god
[1:30:16] will set us together
[1:30:20] he says what we need today we talk about
[1:30:23] pentecostal people knowing more
[1:30:26] getting farther along than the
[1:30:28] old-fashioned methodists they'd rise on
[1:30:30] the scene and make us ashamed of our
[1:30:31] life
[1:30:33] you know that's the truth
[1:30:34] when they'd have revivals
[1:30:36] from house to house
[1:30:38] you had it once
[1:30:40] that's right but you begin to break up
[1:30:43] set over this way set this way come this
[1:30:45] way creeds and denominations can i say
[1:30:48] interpretations and factions
[1:30:51] put the that put the barriers down
[1:30:55] broke fellowship within the body
[1:30:58] says that's all right if you want forty
[1:31:00] thousand churches
[1:31:01] as long as you can recognize one another
[1:31:04] as brothers
[1:31:05] and love one another
[1:31:08] if you're different in doctrine
[1:31:11] little bitty old things about your
[1:31:13] baptisms
[1:31:17] and all these little ins and outs forget
[1:31:19] it be brothers with one another
[1:31:22] that's right
[1:31:24] little video things
[1:31:26] interpretations
[1:31:27] factions following this preacher that
[1:31:29] teacher
[1:31:33] when a revival comes to town brother
[1:31:35] matthew if you'd come
[1:31:37] when a revival comes to town with one
[1:31:39] great united effort everybody go in and
[1:31:42] help out
[1:31:43] that's the way
[1:31:44] then you'll see ministers get together
[1:31:46] in a fellowship in love with one another
[1:31:48] and such things that you've never seen
[1:31:50] before will take place
[1:31:52] amen oh i love him because i know that's
[1:31:55] the truth
[1:31:56] i can say it in the name of the lord
[1:31:58] it's thus
[1:32:00] saith
[1:32:01] the lord
[1:32:03] that's right
[1:32:05] that's the truth
[1:32:08] did you catch that
[1:32:11] how do you tear down the walls of
[1:32:13] separation
[1:32:15] how do you love one another on a
[1:32:17] practical hands-on get out of the
[1:32:19] classroom
[1:32:20] way
[1:32:21] by sitting back
[1:32:23] by criticizing
[1:32:25] no he said make yourself be good to one
[1:32:28] another
[1:32:30] every time you meet one another keep
[1:32:31] doing it
[1:32:33] and the parking lot
[1:32:35] grocery store
[1:32:37] restaurant
[1:32:39] maybe even a church
[1:32:42] pretty soon
[1:32:43] it'll come naturally
[1:32:45] it'll come from your heart
[1:32:48] it won't be a great effort
[1:32:50] it'll be a pleasure and a joy
[1:32:52] but it takes work
[1:32:54] it takes effort to get to that place
[1:32:58] are you willing to put in that effort am
[1:33:00] i willing to put in that effort
[1:33:03] to love one another
[1:33:05] to live the love not just express it in
[1:33:07] words or claim to have it
[1:33:09] to have that level of
[1:33:11] commitment
[1:33:13] remember the chicken and the pig
[1:33:16] the onus
[1:33:18] is on us
[1:33:20] his brother aaron comes to close the
[1:33:22] service
[1:33:23] let's worship and sing
[1:33:25] i love him
[1:33:27] let's start at verse 1
[1:33:30] gone from my heart
[1:33:32] the world and all its charms
[1:33:36] gone from my heart
[1:33:40] the world and all its charms
[1:33:44] [Music]
[1:33:45] now
[1:33:46] through the
[1:33:48] blood i'm saved from all along
[1:33:52] [Music]
[1:33:55] down at the cross
[1:33:58] my heart is bending low
[1:34:03] the precious blood of jesus
[1:34:07] cleanse
[1:34:11] [Music]
[1:34:19] i
[1:34:19] [Music]
[1:34:21] love him
[1:34:25] because he first
[1:34:29] [Music]
[1:34:32] and
[1:34:33] [Music]
[1:34:35] purchase my
[1:34:39] [Music]
[1:34:46] one more time i love him
[1:34:51] [Music]
[1:35:12] my salvation
[1:35:28] he was willing to go to the extreme
[1:35:31] whatever it took
[1:35:33] to show that he loved us that he cared
[1:35:37] if you think back over the last month
[1:35:40] month and a half
[1:35:41] it's three sermons now that we've heard
[1:35:44] addressed to tucson tabernacle to us
[1:35:47] to love one another
[1:35:49] to to
[1:35:51] and sometimes
[1:35:54] in a family
[1:35:56] mom and dad and
[1:35:58] especially if there's five six seven
[1:36:00] children
[1:36:01] things happen
[1:36:04] and i know some families
[1:36:06] would tell the the children he said if
[1:36:08] you don't
[1:36:11] get along
[1:36:13] i'm going to make you kneel down
[1:36:15] and wash your
[1:36:16] siblings feet
[1:36:18] [Music]
[1:36:20] and
[1:36:21] boy they would settle down quick
[1:36:25] and you know when you think about it
[1:36:26] but you know what you're doing when you
[1:36:28] wash one another's feet
[1:36:30] when jesus said by this shall all men
[1:36:32] you know you are my disciples you're
[1:36:34] humbling yourself and saying i love you
[1:36:37] i'm willing to put myself at a low
[1:36:39] enough place where i washed the feet of
[1:36:41] the one that walked amongst the dirt of
[1:36:44] the earth and all remember brother
[1:36:45] branham called him the the flunky
[1:36:49] the little flunky that would wash the
[1:36:51] feet of those coming in
[1:36:54] getting low enough to say i love my
[1:36:55] brother i love my sister
[1:36:58] and in my heart i had said
[1:37:01] the lord shared something in my heart
[1:37:03] and i thought
[1:37:05] there is a people
[1:37:06] or today
[1:37:08] that this word is taking in effect
[1:37:10] and they're becoming the very expression
[1:37:13] of the word of god
[1:37:15] because that's what it is and brother
[1:37:16] branham the statement that brought that
[1:37:17] brother branham said you see mary was
[1:37:20] the word of god being fulfilled that day
[1:37:23] and we've heard now three times the
[1:37:25] people
[1:37:26] becoming the expression and john says
[1:37:28] that god is love
[1:37:31] and you know and
[1:37:33] he was saying the the denominations and
[1:37:36] and
[1:37:37] brother i was saying the differences the
[1:37:39] partitions
[1:37:40] we've had some ministers meetings and
[1:37:42] coming up in a few weeks we're going to
[1:37:43] have another one
[1:37:46] and the brothers from arizona different
[1:37:48] churches have come
[1:37:50] but i've watched too and there are some
[1:37:52] churches that have not come not been
[1:37:54] represented
[1:37:56] and
[1:37:58] we can let that get to us or we can go
[1:38:00] and do our part
[1:38:02] the onus is on us
[1:38:04] so i appreciate that
[1:38:06] the lord would remind us again
[1:38:09] the greatest manifestation of god on
[1:38:11] earth is god's love in you being given
[1:38:13] out to everybody else because god is
[1:38:15] love so
[1:38:17] beyond the healing beyond the miracles
[1:38:20] his love reaching somebody's heart
[1:38:22] and saying because i showed him love
[1:38:26] through the god that is in me and it
[1:38:28] affected them to turn towards christ
[1:38:31] that's what it is so i appreciate that
[1:38:36] but remember the illness is on us
[1:38:39] wherever we go and sometimes it gets
[1:38:41] hard sometimes you get
[1:38:43] but you know quickly as you can catch
[1:38:45] your attitude and repent
[1:38:47] that's why it's as quickly as you can
[1:38:49] say i'm sorry
[1:38:50] how quickly that diffuses a just a quick
[1:38:54] simple i'm
[1:38:57] i sorry
[1:38:58] and
[1:38:59] just a couple of things to bring to your
[1:39:01] attention here
[1:39:03] brother matthew watkins called me today
[1:39:08] and what he said i'll just have you call
[1:39:10] the other brothers rather than me make
[1:39:12] four calls
[1:39:14] his plans are to be here this coming
[1:39:16] weekend
[1:39:17] minister both services
[1:39:20] come and spend the weekend with us
[1:39:22] as our brother
[1:39:24] and just
[1:39:25] just as a as he put it as a visiting
[1:39:27] minister but with the intention of let's
[1:39:30] just get to know each other a little bit
[1:39:31] more for the weekend
[1:39:33] and the following weekend
[1:39:35] which we're not sure if it's going to be
[1:39:37] the following or the third weekend from
[1:39:39] there because brother
[1:39:42] ed dougall and brother jordan will still
[1:39:45] be will be out of town so we may move it
[1:39:47] out
[1:39:48] he would come in the morning sunday
[1:39:49] morning and minister
[1:39:51] and lay his heart out if he was to
[1:39:54] become pastor here
[1:39:56] what his vision would be
[1:39:59] before the congregation
[1:40:01] and then the sunday evening service
[1:40:03] he would open up to questions
[1:40:06] for the congregation to question him
[1:40:08] saying
[1:40:09] what name so
[1:40:11] it's what he has asked if he could do
[1:40:12] that
[1:40:13] and then spend some time
[1:40:16] for us to pray and seek the lord
[1:40:18] and what the congregation would make as
[1:40:20] a decision yes we want him to be our
[1:40:22] pastor
[1:40:23] or no
[1:40:25] so that's what he is asked if he could
[1:40:27] come and do
[1:40:29] and express his heart
[1:40:30] and rather than tell us to tell you let
[1:40:32] him
[1:40:34] share what his vision is so this sunday
[1:40:36] he was coming to minister
[1:40:39] spend a few days here
[1:40:41] just he said just stay in that
[1:40:42] atmosphere
[1:40:44] and then
[1:40:45] possibly the next sunday just depending
[1:40:47] on how we feel
[1:40:49] brother brother and brother jordan said
[1:40:51] it would be fine for him to come we
[1:40:52] didn't have to be here but he kind of
[1:40:54] felt it would be nice to have everybody
[1:40:56] here
[1:40:57] so it may go out one more sunday beyond
[1:40:59] that
[1:41:00] but then at that point giving his heart
[1:41:03] expressing to the congregation
[1:41:05] where what he would desire how what his
[1:41:08] vision would be for the church
[1:41:10] he did not say i'm coming to be the
[1:41:12] pastor he says i'm going to lay my heart
[1:41:14] before the people and see how the people
[1:41:16] feel about that so
[1:41:18] you'll be praying about it see what what
[1:41:20] god wants us to do so
[1:41:23] and then a little update on my daughter
[1:41:25] sarah she left church on
[1:41:29] sunday night and took herself over to
[1:41:31] the hospital the northwest her
[1:41:35] the head doctor
[1:41:36] dr fadia who was head of the nephrology
[1:41:39] there
[1:41:41] at
[1:41:42] northwest hospital sort of just go there
[1:41:44] because the port
[1:41:47] had either cracked or come apart and was
[1:41:49] leaking into her system
[1:41:52] and
[1:41:54] though you just go
[1:41:55] and put yourself there i'll get you into
[1:41:57] the hospital no matter what they think
[1:41:59] well that weight was about 10 o'clock
[1:42:01] you guys went somewhere around there
[1:42:03] 5 30 in the morning before they were
[1:42:05] able to put her into a bed
[1:42:07] and then
[1:42:09] monday afternoon they were able to take
[1:42:11] the old port out and put the new one in
[1:42:15] and
[1:42:17] they had to put on some medication that
[1:42:19] she had been taking for quite some time
[1:42:20] so it left her quite feeling quite
[1:42:23] drowsy sleepy
[1:42:25] nervous and all
[1:42:27] so um
[1:42:29] yesterday morning when she woke up she
[1:42:30] just was not feeling very good
[1:42:33] and then they were going to dialyze her
[1:42:36] once they got everything done
[1:42:38] i got a chance to get over i had a break
[1:42:40] between jobs and i went over to the
[1:42:41] hospital and they were finishing
[1:42:43] dialysis
[1:42:44] and she was recovering and
[1:42:47] she looked at me and she said i'm
[1:42:48] feeling a whole lot better i'm starting
[1:42:50] to feel better in fact she says i'm
[1:42:51] hungry
[1:42:53] and so
[1:42:55] the the nurse was doing the dialysis
[1:42:58] running the machine
[1:43:00] and the other nurses came in and she got
[1:43:02] to being a little more herself in fact
[1:43:04] we were gonna fight over the food
[1:43:06] and just started playing with her and
[1:43:08] laughing
[1:43:10] and so she spent that night and then she
[1:43:12] had the alice's today and rachel
[1:43:15] brought her home rachel said she got off
[1:43:17] the car her color was the same she was
[1:43:19] the happy sarah she was so
[1:43:21] she wanted just to appreciate your
[1:43:23] prayers and thank you and thank the lord
[1:43:25] for him being
[1:43:26] mindful of that appreciate that so
[1:43:29] mama stayed home to be with her tonight
[1:43:31] and
[1:43:32] just make sure because some of the
[1:43:33] effects wear off after a little bit but
[1:43:36] she was the sarah that that we've gotten
[1:43:38] to know she'd come into going through a
[1:43:40] hard time so phil stand with me
[1:43:45] how many would say lord i want to live
[1:43:48] that way
[1:43:49] making no difference no separation
[1:43:52] because god didn't look and they said
[1:43:53] now wait a minute leper you're a you're
[1:43:55] a samaritan i don't deal with samaritans
[1:43:57] he just said go
[1:44:00] and i want to have that love that
[1:44:02] brother branham says that's going to get
[1:44:04] us to the other side that's what's going
[1:44:06] to be recognized
[1:44:08] brother brahm talked about the the
[1:44:09] cattle
[1:44:10] when he said it wasn't the brand they
[1:44:13] were looking at the blood tag
[1:44:15] and if you've come under that same
[1:44:16] sacrifice under that same blood tag
[1:44:19] you're my brother
[1:44:20] you're my sister i'm your brother also
[1:44:24] let's pray lord we thank you for your
[1:44:25] word today
[1:44:27] and sometimes it's
[1:44:30] it's just a reminder it's just something
[1:44:32] to to to make us look at ourselves
[1:44:35] closely and say what is my motive
[1:44:38] what am i trying to accomplish why am i
[1:44:40] acting that way
[1:44:42] why am i thinking that way what's the
[1:44:44] motive down in my heart lord
[1:44:46] let it be always motivated by the love
[1:44:48] of god that's in our hearts
[1:44:51] and that's what it would allow him to
[1:44:53] look at peter even after peter denied
[1:44:56] him and said i don't know him i cursed
[1:44:58] at him
[1:45:00] and he would tell his disciples and tell
[1:45:02] peter to come also
[1:45:04] look at a woman that they had caught in
[1:45:06] the very act of adultery and said woman
[1:45:09] where are thine accusers
[1:45:12] that love that would look past all the
[1:45:15] outside look at past all the differences
[1:45:17] look at maybe
[1:45:19] previous history and things
[1:45:21] and say no i i laid down my life for my
[1:45:25] friends so
