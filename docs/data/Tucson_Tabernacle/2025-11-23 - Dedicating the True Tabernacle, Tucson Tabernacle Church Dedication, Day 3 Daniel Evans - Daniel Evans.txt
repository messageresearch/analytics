Burn like fire. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus is awesome this morning. You may be seated. So before I I play this song, [clears throat] it's called song's called You Were Were you You It's It's You Were Worth It is is the song I'm going to play. Um I'm gonna just share a threeinut uh testimony that I've only shared with a few individuals. [clears throat] Um and I just trust it's going to help you to better understand who you are and just who who we are. So at the beginning of my uh my career, I was I was living in Bangkok, Thailand. And um I'm gonna just make this make this quick. Um, I was in this social gathering and I was talking to a number of people. One of them was this girl from Hong Kong. She was a Catholic. And shortly into the conversation, she asked me if I was a Christian. I said yes. Um, so after after a couple more conversations, um, you know, I I started just telling her what the Lord did for me and I said, "Do you do you want to be baptized? Um, do you want to repent and be baptized?" Um, what I wasn't expecting was for her to say yes at 11 o'clock at night. [clears throat] Um because I was like, I don't know where water is. Um so fortunately the the building I worked downtown had a fountain in front of it. So we hopped in a taxi. Um we drove down there. The security guard was was asleep half the time. Then he woke up when he saw us get in the fountain. But uh so I baptized her. We got back in the taxi. It's midnight. We drove back. [clears throat] Um so I was I want to tell you that that was just like the context. But the part I want to tell you about is what I want to hopefully encourage you and just help you with your faith. It helps. And the Lord just showed me this as I was on the on the flight from Tampa here a couple days ago because I I I hadn't remembered this and he never showed that he never I think he kind of explained to me why why um he allowed this part to happen. So I was laying in bed and I don't know if this was a vision but I wasn't I I dream a lot and it wasn't a dream. I think I was awake and I was in my room laying on [clears throat] my bed and um something a dark presence came to the room and started pushing me into my bed. Um and I could not get up um and I I cried um I cried Jesus, Jesus. And this is the first time I've heard an audible voice like there was something else. It wasn't just in my head a thought. There was an audible voice from the darkest place. It was from hell. And it said, "The people of the Lord." The people of the Lord. And then another voice came and said, "Get out of the room. Get out of the room." And it left. So I want to tell you that because Satan knows who you are. Okay? So you are the people of the Lord. God knows who you are. Do you know who you are? Okay. So, I'm gonna just give you the background for this song. Last uh last weekend before I knew I was going to be coming here, I sat down 10:30 at the piano and this song just just happened. And it happened as a result of just feeling very burdened for um a neighbor that we're close to. We did carpool with them and she's tried to commit suicide this year. Um just going through a really hard time. And I just wrote this song called You Were Worth It because you were so you were so worth it. And even when you think back um the very beginning of the Bible, it says in the beginning God created. He did that for you. And he did all the math, all the physics, all the biology. He did all of that. So you know that you're worth it. And he did that even for for people that don't accept him. and and he so so you you are worth it no matter what. And I just I just wanted to remind you of that and just give you the context. [clears throat] I have a story about somebody. You know, [singing] sometimes they feel like they are a nobody. But that's not what God said about you. Before there was time, he was all alone in his mind, not thinking about the earth and the stars. He was thinking of you. No matter how you are, he knows it. Whatever the price, he paid it. No matter how lost, you're worth it. You're worth it all. [music] You're worth it all. Oh, you [music] might think when you're looking in that sunrise, you're all alone there in the sunlight. But he made that horizon for you. [music] As the world's turning, we're lost in its meaning. Life has a way of only defeating our spirits all longing for something to guide [music] the way. No matter how you are, he knows it. Trust me, [music] whatever the price, he paid it. No matter how lost, you're worth it. You're worth it all. [music] You're worth it all. [music] Before you say goodbye, let [music] him look into your eyes and let him [singing] tell you that you are beautiful but [music] wasn't for your sin. Why on earth would he begin to [music] tell you all the reasons you [singing] are worth it all? Worth it all. No matter how you are, he knows it. Whatever the price, he paid it. No matter how lost, you're worth it all. Worth it all. Worth it all. You're worth it all. [music] Amen. Thank you, brother Stephen. Um, if the brothers want to make ready for the prayer requests and offerings, if we could stand and we're going to sing, "How great is our God. How great is our [singing] God." Oh, sing with me. How [singing] great is our God? And all will [singing] see how great how great is our God. You believe that you were worth it all? you would look at yourself and say not worthy. But he that day when he had to make that decision, he had [music] taken his disciples with him and he said, "We're going to pray cuz I'm about to go through something." And he and he came in a body of flesh so that he could be touched by the filling of your infirmities so he could understand. And he said, "Father, is there another way we could do this. But he said, "No, not my will, but your will be done." Cuz he saw you and he said, "I've got to get to that one. You're worthy of it all. No question about it. I didn't make myself worthy." He took care of it all. Amen. You can say, "Thank you, Lord. I appreciate that, God. There's nothing too wrong, too bad that you can't He will. Thief on the cross. He turned around and said, "Remember me when you come into your kingdom." And he [music] said, "This day you'll be in paradise." Somebody might have asked him, "How did you get here?" And he just [music] said, "He said I could come." &gt;&gt; And if he said you can come, you're welcome. &gt;&gt; As he took paid for it all. Amen. Sister Rebecca Zbrunner requests here. Prayer healing for healing for my aunt Rosanna who has had a few operations on her intestines. [music] So again, he was wounded. He was bruised. So I would be covered. Pray for guidance for a not Lisa who has to find a new place to live in 3 weeks. Nothing impossible for him. If Lord, I have a need. And you know what that is. So I'll let you answer it, Lord, the way it should be answered. Lord, we It's hard for us to imagine that you would come down in flesh so that you could be touched by the filling of our infirmities. You even [music] question when that day came to surrender yourself to what was going to be some really hard days ahead of you. But you said not my will but thy will be done Lord. We have the same attitude. We have questions. We have desires. We have wants. But we want it to be directed and led by you, Lord. Because the end result will be what you've desired, Lord. You saw every hand raised. You see every every heart represented here. those that might be listening to in today, Lord, that they realize that if they were the only ones, you still would have given your life to redeem them, Lord. So, we just want to say thank you and we appreciate as they take up the offering, Lord. May we give with a cheerful heart, Lord, and then you bless it for its intended [music] use. We ask in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; You may be seated at the Brassan. girls wants to start getting ready. The splend of the king. Oh, clothe in mesty. Let all the earth rejoice.

We're grateful, [music] Lord, that you brought us together in this Sunday morning. Father, I'm excited maybe to see what you're going to do this morning. Lord, you've done so many things, great things. Now, Lord, we ask maybe that you would make yourself known in our midst this morning. That you would be here with us, Father. And Lord that every person that come has come into this building this morning father may they leave Lord receiving what they are expecting. May they receive father what they [music] have asked for. We pray what is written in your word. Lord you ask not because you receive not or you receive not because you ask not. And Lord, we are asking Lord that you would give us, Father, what's on our heart. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you, brothers and sisters. You can be seated. I think it's been a good two days. What do you think? [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Now we come to the close of our church dedication. Uh first I want to thank all of the people that have worked so hard, especially the sisters that are in the kitchen that have been doing everything. [applause] [applause] It's been good food. Real good. And that stuff comes it does it comes at a price and they have definitely paid the price. They have worked hard and and it's for us. It's just it's they've working for us because they love us. So I really really appreciate what they've done. Uh the first thing I want to talk about is some directions that I want the church to go that I'm really excited about. The um the first thing is it's a it's a bit of a testimony. It's not just a bit of one. It's a very great testimony. Daniel and I were working on a project and we were trying, what we wanted to do is we wanted to put together a video for the church that we could just put it on our YouTube page that you could share with your friends and if somebody wants to be introduced to what we stand for at the church, just something really short that you could send them a le link or something like that. And so we tried and we interviewed some of you and and we did our best, but we're not pros. And it just wasn't coming together. And I was sitting in my den and I was actually at that moment I was going over this script that just wasn't working. And I get a text from my cousin who I don't talk to very often. and it popped up and it said, "Hi, Daniel and Stephanie. I want to I had it on my heart. I want to gift you and your church a video that you can use to send people." And she says, "I want to pay for it and I want this professional videographer that I know to do it." And he's like us. He's a Christian. He's a believer. And when I saw that text, I was like, "No way. I know that we are in the Lord's will in doing this." My cousin Hope is and her husband Craig, dear, just dear wonderful people. Hope and I grew up together. We're the same age. She's like 10 years younger than me. Hope and Craig, stand up in the back. Yeah, you got to stand up. [applause] I love I love that girl. We've been we were very very close growing up. And I hope Thank you so much. If we could play the video in John chapter 17, Jesus prays that the disciples would be in such unity that the world would see their unity and know that God sent Jesus Christ to the world. Jesus is asking the father for a church that would produce such love that sinners would come to salvation not through their doctrine necessarily and not necessarily through their music but through the love that they have for each other. &gt;&gt; Spirit of the church is loving, caring. When I came here, the first smile I saw was actually sister Heathers and she welcomed me with a huge hug and I felt welcomed and not judge or anything. &gt;&gt; I would say uh loving for sure and accepting and we don't care what anyone looks like or what your background is, but we just want souls to be saved and them to come to the Lord and have a better life through him. &gt;&gt; My favorite thing about Tucson Tabernacle is the pastor. He has a lot of compassion and love for us. The second is the congregation and you know all the brothers and sisters get together and it's [music] all love. They don't discriminate. &gt;&gt; I think Tucson Tabernacle is a great place u for someone who is scared of meeting new people. We understand those struggles and those fears and I feel like you always have someone there to shake your hand or greet you and that helps so much to take that nervousness away. &gt;&gt; I value our pastor. He's very special. has a lot of depth and loves the people. That's for sure. And I value that very much. &gt;&gt; Gone to church all my life since I was born. But coming to Tucson Tabernacle uh changed my outlook as a Christian that a Christianity was not a set of deeds but was a life lived. I found that at the tabernacle that was the emphasis to live a life worthy of the gospel in the sense that others could see Christ in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's amazing whenever you you hear the congregation singing and you know you're all just singing to the one creator. You're just singing to Jesus Christ and it's 150 whether it's 150 on Sunday morning or 50 people on Wednesday night. It's you get there and the spirit comes down because All of us are singing to one person. It's and that's the Jesus Christ. It's not about me. It's and it's not about the congregation. It's just about Jesus. The Tucson Tabernacle is a place of refuge where you can come in. You can feel accepted. [snorts] You can worship with great music, hear a Bible-based sermon, but it is also a place of ministry. You may be dealing with your own sins, but don't forget the guy next to you. He's dealing with something, too. come into this church to serve. Not to serve yourself, but to serve others. I promise you'll get what you need, but make it the focus. Make it your focus to serve others. That's the spirit of Christ. And that is the Holy Spirit. That's what I want to see in a church. That's what I want to see in the Tucson Tabernacle. And I really think that we are moving in the right direction. [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Thanks, Hope and Craig. God bless you both. And uh we'll get to this link. Just a a simple introduction to our church. And uh I pray that the Lord will use it. Another thing that I want to do, another direction that we have with this congregation is with our children, especially our little ones. It's important to give the kids what they need and give it to them early. Build that foundation in the young ones. So, I talked with Brother Jordan, Sister Martha, and I actually the other Wednesday or Sunday night, I believe it was, I brought all the kids up in the front, and Brother Jordan led them in a song, and it was just it was really cool. These these kids laughing and singing out loud. And what I want to do is once a month I want to have children's church and we'll do it on a Sunday night and the kids are going to sing. We'll have sing alongs. We'll have Bible readings. We'll have stories. It's going to be focusing on them. And hopefully they'll start singing specials. Hopefully they'll they'll start reading scriptures. And we might even find a couple of these little guys might even be the future preachers, maybe even the future pastor of this church. [applause] [applause] So, we'll put that on the calendar. And I think I I just have really high expectations for Children's Church. I think it's going to be something that these kids will always remember their whole lives. And then the last thing and this is very very important also I have uh a brother that I know he's in South Africa he's watching I'm sure right now his name is Steven Young. Stephen Young is a man of God. A real deal man of God. He loves the word with all of his heart and he has a calling in his life to be a pastor. He's pastored for many years and he has suffered. And one thing I I look at my life and most of my suffering has been because of my own doing. Almost all of it as I look back. Stephen lately has suffered because he has stood for the word of God. And he is, as I said, he's he's one of the best preachers I've ever heard. And now he's starting a grassroots effort to build a church in Durban, South Africa in his home. He's got a congregation of very few people right now. He's just he's been on the field doing this for about a month now, I guess. And he has about 12 in his congregation, which that number should sound familiar. That's how many people the Ephesian church started with. One of the greatest churches in the entire Bible. Stephen is he's just got a heart. He's got a heart for the people. He's got a heart for evangelism. And I wanted and I talked with the trustees and we all voted unanimously on doing this. I want to take one offering a month from our church and give it to Stephen to get him going. This isn't a forever thing. We're going to continue this as long as as he's progressing and as as long as he feels called to continue on doing this and until this church gets established. We now the Tucson Tabernacle has a specific overseas missionary program and that is investing in this church in Durban, South Africa. And let me tell you something, I don't think that we could invest in a better group of people than Stephen Young and this little group that's forming there in Durban. of Jordan. &gt;&gt; Dear brother Dan and the believers at Tucson Tabernacle, we want to thank you from the bottom of our hearts for your prayers and for your supports for us during our the difficult times that we've been facing here. But we thank God for your love and for your support over there. So from all of us here in Durban, South Africa, &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Let's [applause] we have an opportunity friends to give. We have an opportunity to support something that could be great. One soul is worth 10,000 worlds. But I look forward to seeing this work that we're doing in South Africa as being a great work. And it's neat because we get to see it from the very foundation of how this is this is going to go. This is these are not tithing. These are offerings. These are something that we can do on top of our um tithing to the church. This is a way that we are able to be generous for someone else. So, one offering a month we are going to send overseas to brother Stephen and the group that you saw there to hopefully get them a place to worship and continue on with brother Steven's outreach. And we're going to start with the offering that we took today. So, this money the trustees will are prepared this money will go to brother Stephen and as I said once a month. So that's the direction some of the exciting new things we have here at Tucson Tabernacle. Brother Steven will also give us um regular reports from the church. I look at these things. I look at our video. I look at the children's church that we're doing overseas missionary efforts. And I don't ever want us to lose perspective. We have to think, is it really going to do any good? Are these things all the the work that we've done really has it done any good? And I think behind the right souls and behind the right attitude and behind prayers, I think it can do good. But we can't lose perspective. all all of the renovations that we've done here at the church and all of the the stuff that we've done outside this church, it's just going to get old again. The carpet's going to wear out that we're going to have to repaint the walls again. We're going to have to redo things in the fellowship hall. There's going to be constant maintenance on it. It's not when when we're investing in this, it's it's a perishable thing. This church isn't going to be here forever. This building, this church will one day be be reduced to rubble. One day it will. But the souls that this church touches, &gt;&gt; those are eternal, &gt;&gt; that is the work that we focus on. &gt;&gt; And and the of putting out a video, it's good. And but it's that's not the focus. And and the children's church and having fun, that's not the focus. through renovations. That's not the focus. What is the focus? Is are we touching people and is it having an effect? &gt;&gt; That's the main thing. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Is anything working? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We have to ask ourselves that in our own lives. &gt;&gt; We all are familiar with the scripture Malachi 4:5. My question is, have any hearts really changed? Has anything really happened? Let me read the amplified version version of Malachi 4:5. Behold, I'm going to send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord. And he will turn the hearts of the fathers to their ch to the ch to their children and the hearts of the children to their fathers. Reconciliation produced by repentance. So that I will not come and strike the land with a curse of complete destruction. Reconciliation is what the amplified adds there. A reconciliation produced by repentance. &gt;&gt; And I'm asking the question, did it happen? Has that happened? Has it happened in our lives? I'm asking you personally, has it happened in your life? Has this produced something, a change in your heart? Has your heart turned back to the apostles and the prophets? &gt;&gt; Has it done anything? &gt;&gt; We're going to celebrate Christmas coming up. You know that we'll have the some people have the tree and the star and the and the presents underneath and all of this, but do we lose the real meaning behind Christmas [snorts] &gt;&gt; with all of the packaging? &gt;&gt; Do we lose the meaning behind it? Are the gifts, do they represent what the wise men brought to Jesus? Does the star on the tree, does that represent the star of Bethlehem? Does it represent the birth of Christ? Or do we lose it all and we just say Christmas? Oh, it's a Christian holiday. But have we lost the meaning of it just with the packaging? &gt;&gt; How about Thanksgiving? It's coming up this week. &gt;&gt; Do we understand what it's about? &gt;&gt; Do we understand the importance of Thanksgiving? how people gave their lives so that we might have freedom here in the United States so that we could have freedom of worship so that we could have prosperity in this new land. Do we understand as we're putting the turkey out and the stuffing and everything else? Do we understand the meaning behind it or have we lost it just in the packaging of Thanksgiving? &gt;&gt; Do we understand what all of these things are about? And how about this church? The Tucson Tabernacle was originally founded really on the promise of turning the heart of the children back to that of the fathers. My question is a reconciliation produced by repentance. Has it happened? Have hearts truly been changed? Has it produced a group of people who have such an outward love for Jesus Christ and for each other? Not with their outward works, but has it produced a love that people have as Jesus prayed that you would I would know you for your love one another. Has it produced that? really ask yourself &gt;&gt; or is it just the same old thing just wrapped in a different package? something we need to ask. And for this generation, this new generation that's coming up that when we as we're dedicating ourselves in this church, is this going to be another generation that just has the same packaging on the outside? Or is this generation going to be truly the ones that their hearts are turned back to what the book of Acts taught &gt;&gt; and what Jesus Christ taught? &gt;&gt; Is it truly going to be that way? Is it truly going to be our hearts are turned back to that of Peter and of James and of John where they had such love one for another that everything was in common. If anybody had any need, they they were helped. They weren't they weren't they weren't hating each other and gossiping about each other. They were supporting each other. Our our lives, our spirits, are they going to be turned back to that? Really? I don't see it yet. What's a tabernacle? We call ourselves the tabernacle. What is a tabernacle? It's just a tent. It's just a a dwelling place is what it is. Moses, when he brought the Israelites out of Egypt, God instructed him to build a portable place of worship, a tabernacle, a tent. It wasn't the biggest tent in the world. It wasn't even probably the nicest tent in the world, but it was built according to God's instructions. And when they finished it exactly how how God had laid it out and they built it exactly. He he gave the specific instructions to the prophet of Mo prophet Moses on how to build it. And when they built it, you know what it was? It was just a tent. It was not special. It was a tent. It was a shelter. But then when the spirit of God came down and dwelt in that tabernacle, then it became something very, very special. Otherwise, it was nothing. Exodus 40 verse 34, look what happens when the spirit of God comes down on this tent. Exodus 40 verse 34. Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle. And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation because the cloud abode therein, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle. Even the prophet Moses couldn't even come in there. And it because of this spirit of God that was so great in this tent. And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward on in all their journeys. But if the cloud were not taken up, then the journey then they journey not till the day that it was taken up. For the cloud of the Lord was upon the tabernacle by day, and fire was on it by night in the sight of all the house of Israel throughout all of their journeys. We call this the Tucson Tabernacle. Why is it just the name that we just we just call ourselves or do we really know what the tabernacle in the wilderness represented? It represented the Holy Spirit coming down in a place of dwelling and abiding there and the pillar of fire by night. If this thing moved, they packed up the tent and they followed it wherever it went. They weren't f the tent was following the Holy Spirit and not the other way around. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We heard testimonies on Friday night. Paul with a vision and a and a prophetic utterance from someone else. And it came to pass. Esther delivered of alcoholism. Manny delivered of drug abuse and immoral living. James and John asking God for a place to fellowship. Cleano delivered from a demon that was tormenting him. Friends, these aren't stories from another generation. This isn't us telling our kids about how the pillar of fire followed the tabernacle in the wilderness. This is real. This is modern day. &gt;&gt; We're not telling ourselves. We're not telling testimonies about about something else that none of us ever saw. &gt;&gt; These testimonies that we heard, they produced something. They produced a change of heart. &gt;&gt; That was the main thing. &gt;&gt; The Lord does miracles. Yes. But it's that that heart that changed. Turn that heart of the CHILDREN BACK TO something that is great. &gt;&gt; Don't forget the meaning of the whole scripture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is to make a change in our lives. We forget that part. &gt;&gt; Brother Steven Bryant here, he sang the song earlier and and gave the testimony. He wrote me this this morning. I hope it's okay because I'm going to read it anyway. Stephen, I have nice permission. I realize he he said this. I realized that last night he was talking about our service last night. Stephen says this. I realized that last night I was back in the same pews I was as an infant and a child. And now I'm standing here as a grown man. And somehow God loved me enough to chase me down all those roads and made me into something I never thought I wanted to be. &gt;&gt; But there I was praying under such an anointing under such anointing for him to take 100% control. Then something new happened. It was faith to believe that he could take 100%. How many How many here really want him to take a 100%. That's a hard That's a hard That's a hard one to raise your hand on. &gt;&gt; Take 100% because that means you're going to have to give 100%. &gt;&gt; Because God's not going to take anything that you won't give him. Lord, I'll give you my Sunday morning. &gt;&gt; But Tuesday night, you know that's mine. I'll give you my five minute prayer in the morning, but the rest of the time it's mine. &gt;&gt; Jesus, that spirit of Christ, it's a sweet spirit. It's just going to take what you give him and and he'll be grateful for it. He'll take as much as you want to give. But our hearts should be turned back to those ones that we read about in the Bible. Peter and James and John and Philip and Thomas. Mary Magdalene. Talked about her the other night. Mary of Bethany, Martha, all the way back. Rahab, Hannah, David, and Samuel. Moses. turn our hearts back to have that same character, that same faith that they had. That's the meaning of this scripture. We forget the second part. There was a purpose in it. Brother Brandham did a great job. He actually did it himself. He had that spirit. What was that spirit? It was love. &gt;&gt; My aunt Jacqueline's here. one of the few people that actually knew him. Growing up, I didn't hear stories about the miracles. I didn't hear the stories about all the great doctrines. I didn't hear any of the stories about that. You know what I heard? I heard the stories about the man and the love that he had and the the presence that was around him. That's why people loved him. That's why people admired him. He actually did it. His heart was turned back. Now, what about us? &gt;&gt; Is it going to happen within me? &gt;&gt; It's about me. It's about you. &gt;&gt; Am I actually going to be one of those ones &gt;&gt; that really serves Jesus Christ? &gt;&gt; Am I going to be one of those ones? I talked about Stephen on Sunday morning last week and there's something about the name Stephen and uh it's been brother Ste brother Steve and I have been talking about this. You got Stephen Young in South Africa. You got Stephen Brousone here ministering for us. You got Stephen Bryant here. There's just this these meetings. I think I'm even married to a Stephven. Actually, when we when we talk to French people, that's usually what they call her. [laughter] Oh, Stephen. My French accent isn't so good, is it? It's just been a it's it's been a blessing to me. And I mentioned this man named Stephen in the Bible. This deacon who [snorts] stood for Christ. And you know what they crucified him? You know what they stoned him for? They stoned him because they said he was against the prophet Moses. &gt;&gt; And that was the reason. Oh, you're against Moses. Picked up the stones and killed him. because they said he was against the prophet. &gt;&gt; Listen to what Stephen said just before he died. Preached one of the most amazing sermons. Acts chapter 6 and 7 if you want to go back to it. Acts chapter 7 verse 44. He Steven is talking about the ta the tabernacle in the wilderness. And look what he listen to what he says. our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness as he had appointed speaking unto Moses that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen. So God had given Moses these directions on how to build this tabernacle, which also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus into the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drove out before the face of the fathers unto the day of David, who found favor before God, and desired to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob. So David, this king, Moses built the tent and then hundreds of years later, here comes David and they still have a tent. But God was God would come down and he would dwell in that tent for a moment. And David wanted to give God a permanent place to dwell. Not a tent, but a brick andmortar structure. Something that would really something that would weather the storm. Something that wouldn't get old and wouldn't have to be replaced. David had a vision for it, but David couldn't do it. The next verse says, "But Solomon built him a house." Solomon did it, but it was still. That was the temple in Jerusalem. The first temple that Solomon built, it replaced that tabernacle in the wilderness. And Jesus and God, the shikina of glory would come down and dwell within that temple. But it the temple wasn't wasn't real. It was just a building. God didn't live there. He just showed up once in a while. It was never God's desire to live in a church building. We call it the house of the Lord, but it's not really the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; This is the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's the house where the tabernacles, this building in the temple, that's where, that's the house where the tabernacles of the Lord come in. &gt;&gt; The ones that are that dwelling place for God. That is what this tabernacle is. That is what a true church is. But the true tabernacle is the person. &gt;&gt; It's not the building. It never was. Remember the the tent was just a tent. The temple is just a building. But it was the God that came down into the building that made it special. And we we're just people. &gt;&gt; We're just flesh and blood. But it's the God that comes down and dwells within us. That's what makes us special. It's not claiming this or that. It's the real God that dwells within us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's poured out upon us. Romans chapter 5 verse 5 says this. Listen to this. And hope maketh not ashamed because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given to us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Modern translations, the modern wording, New King James Version says, "The love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who was who was given to us." So he's pouring he pours out that spirit into us. That was the motive of God in the first place. He never the the temple was never important. He wanted to pour his heart out. God wanted to pour his love into us. That was the whole purpose of it. All of the Old Testament, it was just a type. It was it was a prophecy of what was going to come to pass at the day of Pentecost when God no longer came just into the temple. Then he spread himself into the hearts of men and women. that shakina glory. It came down into the temple after Solomon built it and it was in the it was in the tent. But when it came into 120 people in the upper room, that was the real thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's when it was fulfilled. The other was just a symbol. But when it came down in a man, that is was that was the fulfillment of the prophecy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That was the real gift. The rest the rest of it was just a package. Ask again, what about today? Did it really happen? Have we really received the Holy Ghost? Are we that tabernacle that God dwells in? Acts chapter 4, what happened was in Acts chapter 2, the Holy Spirit came down and fell upon 120 in the upper room. They spoke with tongues. They went out. They were staggering. They were so touched by the spirit and they they prophesied and they started healing the sick and they started doing these same things that Jesus did. Now Jesus wasn't just a man. Now, he was people everywhere that had his same spirit doing the same thing. They received the Holy Ghost in Acts chapter 2. But I want you to think about this. You may say, "I received the Holy Ghost when I was 12 years old." And you look back at that time. It's good. But what about today? &gt;&gt; What about Have you received the Holy Spirit lately? &gt;&gt; Acts chapter 2, they received it. Peter and John were there. John Peter was the main spokesperson. Then two parag two chapters later in Acts chapter 4, watch what happens. Same people, Peter and John and all the disciples, same one. Watch what happens. Acts 4:31, it says this. Remember couple who knows how long before they received the Holy Ghost. Now watch this. And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and they spake the word of God with boldness. &gt;&gt; They were filled again. A revival. You ever heard of the word? I've heard it a few times over the past few days. &gt;&gt; And the multitude of them believed that believed. Now listen to this. Watch what it produces. I'm talking about the spirit going back, us going back to that same spirit that they have. Turn our hearts back to these these apostolic fathers, these great ones. Watch this. And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul. Where's that today? One heart and one soul. Neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own. But they had all things in common. The Holy Spirit filled Peter and John and the disciples again. Are we satisfied with just the package that we're in now? Are we satisfied with who we are now? Are we satisfied with an experience from 20, 30, 40 years ago? Or maybe even an experience yesterday? &gt;&gt; I want more today. &gt;&gt; You know what? I ate that good food last night. It was good, but I haven't eaten today. &gt;&gt; And I'm starting to get hungry again. And that's how it is with the Holy Spirit. Lord, I feel just full. I feel so good. Oh, thank you, God. It feels so good. And then tomorrow, Lord, I'm hungry again. &gt;&gt; I need it again &gt;&gt; and again and more and more. [applause] Constant infilling of the Holy Spirit. Remember when they were when when the temple was put there, that Holy Spirit didn't come down in Jerusalem just one time when they dedicated the church. It came again and again and again when that spirit would fill the holy of holies in that room. [sighs] Or are we just satisfied? I read a scripture the other day and it we all know it and when I read it you're going to recognize it. It's in second Peter chapter 2. And it just kind of struck me and I think Lord this scripture is really relevant for even dedicating a church. Second Peter chapter 2 verse 22. The apo the uh the apostle Peter is talking about the people who return to their sins. But it has happened unto them according to the true proverb. The dog is turned to his own vomit again and the s that was washed to her wallowing in the mire. It's a strange thought. I was I've gone over the past three or four years. I've been traveling back and forth to southern Baja Mexico doing a a humanitarian work there. And there's this ranch that that has this big giant pen. It's probably I don't know as big as this whole church. And I always see this same pig in the same spot and it's this big fat s and she, you know, has these big floppy ears and she's always laying in the same spot. She's always laying in in the same mud hole. Every time I come, she never moves. I walk in, I walk walk by her, we drive by her, and there she is. You know, she's laying there. It's like, okay, has she moved in the past six months? And she has all of this area to roam. And I'm sure that she does, but she always comes back to that same mud hole. That's so often with a sinner. We may come out of our sins, but there's something that brings us back to that sin. And he also talks about this dog. As a dog returns to his vomit, I know we probably all have seen that where a dog someone will make it sick and it'll throw up and then it'll leave and then it'll come back and it'll eat it again. It's gross. I know. It's really a nasty thought. But Peter is trying to tie in us and our sins to going back and eating the vomit again. &gt;&gt; We We might come to the altar. We might hate the way that we are and we might just come out right there at the altar and I might change my appearance. I might I might cut a couple of sins out in my life. But am I really the same person inside? Do I still want to lay in that mud? When we're walking through our daily walk, do I find myself in mud again? And Lord, I thought I came out of this. I thought my heart was changed. I thought I am a different vessel. And here I am in the same mud. And it might be resentment of someone. It might be it might be gossip. It it might be pornography. It it could be drinking. It could be any of those things. And you find yourself, Lord, I thought I was different. I thought I had changed. And here I am right back in this pool of mud again. &gt;&gt; Am I that same pig? Lord, I need a change in my life. &gt;&gt; I need I need these these demons that are are bothering me. I need them to go. And then that void that's created, I need that Holy Spirit to replace that. I need a change. That pig will always want to lay in that slop always because it's a pig. But if that nature changes, &gt;&gt; then she becomes something different. And the same with with this dog, you know, you you come and and make a change in your life and then on the inside, is there still pride? Is there still resentment? Is there still sexual immorality? And is there still fear maybe that you're going to get out of your comfort zone? You know, you look down at your feet and you say, "Lord, here I am in this mud. I I want to change." or or you you you go back and and it's like, man, I thought I gave that up and I just ate it again. &gt;&gt; It's a disgusting thing to go back to our sins. &gt;&gt; We've moved past those. And I get it. You go back to the sin and it's like, "Oh, it's just disgusting. Lord, I did it again." But you place it into his hands and you constantly work. And Lord, I don't want to be that that person. I don't want to be that same person I used to be. I don't want to be that that pig in the in the muck. I don't want to be that dog that eats its puke. I want to be something different. The importance of Malachi 4 is to turn our hearts back. That's the part we leave out. &gt;&gt; That's the part that affects me. That's that's the importance of it, but instead we're putting it on some somebody else or something else, but the importance is did it have an effect in my life? The importance of this church, it's not a video. It's not a a a new paint on the walls. It's not stone on the on the pulpit. Is it changing my life? Have I changed? That's the important thing. Everything else is just the wrapping. &gt;&gt; That's what matters with the tabernacle in the wilderness, with the temple. It was just a tent or it was just a building, but God came in there. &gt;&gt; That's the important thing. &gt;&gt; Let's go back to Stephen verse number 48, Acts chapter 7. Stephen is saying the same thing. He says, "How be it, the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands, as saith the prophet, heaven is my throne and earth is my foottool. What house will you build me? sayeth the Lord, or what is the the place of my rest? Hath not my hand made all of these things? Back to Romans, he said, God's love has been poured out in our hearts and he did that. He created the heavens and the earth. He separated the light from the darkness. He did these things and he gave us a Bible to read that we might know him better. Amen. &gt;&gt; This Bible at the very beginning, God created the heavens and the earth and then the Holy Spirit steps on the scene and starts forming all of these these things. The Bible wasn't written. People tried to say, "Oh, well, you know, it's 6,000 years and day one and day two and try to try to figure out this and try to figure out that and then the big bang over here now and that's when uh there was moisture in the in the earth and then that protected the that built the atmosphere and it's not written for that. If God would have wanted to write a a science book, he would have chose a great scientist. &gt;&gt; And neither is it a book of history. &gt;&gt; It's got good history in it. But there's things in the genealogies. It's like, well, what is was it this person or was this person was the ancestor? And you try to put it together. It wasn't written for that. If God would have wanted to write a history book, he would have chose some history professor. It wasn't written for that. This book, this Bible was written as a book of relationship between God the Father and us ourselves. You can't get the other stuff out of it. [applause] Amen. That's when you read this Bible, you see, oh, this is God dealing with us. &gt;&gt; This is this is him wanting a relationship. He built he made the Garden of Eden. Why? so his children could be there. &gt;&gt; That's what it was about. You know, day one, day two, day three. We got all the creation there and and God didn't think it was it was applicable applicable to our lives to explain how it happened. He put it there. But the main thing is that you have a relationship with me. &gt;&gt; That's what I want. &gt;&gt; God wanted to dwell with man, mankind. He wanted to dwell with women. He wanted to come down and he wanted to fill that that tabernacle in the wilderness. He wanted that fellowship. He wanted to be around people, but they were too sinful. They couldn't get close enough to him. There was no sacrifice there. If they would have got too close, they would have died. That that glory of God is too holy to where a sinful person if it comes in the presence, you couldn't even be on the same mountain or you would have died. But then he sent his son because he wanted to be he wanted to fellowship with us. He wanted that holy spirit to come down and dwell within us. So he sent his son so his son could take those sins and now he can fellowship with us like he did at the beginning. &gt;&gt; That's the whole purpose of the book. &gt;&gt; I want a relationship with you. Here it is in the Old Testament. It's laying a foundation. and now I will send my son and he is the propitiation of sins. He takes those sins away and now I have a relationship with you because that's what I've wanted from the beginning. This tabernacle, this tabernacle and the tabernacle in the wilderness was made with human hands. We can come. Daniel and the the um the team can come. This was made with hands. This building was built by people. It doesn't matter. That's not the important thing. The work that that we do, we want to make it as nice as we can, but it's not it's not it's not the building. Don't look at the packaging. The main thing when you celebrate Thanksgiving, don't look at the turkey on the table, you know, and the stuffing and all of that, look at the reason that it's put there. &gt;&gt; When you go to when when Christmas, don't look at all the all the tensil and all the the trees and and the and the gifts. Look at the reason that that we celebrate the birth of the Messiah, &gt;&gt; our savior. That's what it should be about. faith is recorded in this book. The faith of our fathers is recorded right here. God wants to turn our hearts back to this, back to these men and these women, these great warriors of old. That's the purpose of it. And he said that he pours his love into this tabernacle. And Stephen before he died, he said, "You stiff neck and uncircumcised in your hearts and ears. You do always resist the Holy Ghost. As your fathers did, so do you." Friends, I want a church that's turned back to that original faith of the disciples. [music] I want that spirit that is promised. I want that spirit to to have its way in my life. I want it to be a success in my life. Not just pointing to something, but I want it to be alive in me. &gt;&gt; I want to be a tabernacle of witness. &gt;&gt; I want to be that place where God dwells because he made a way now because of his son Jesus Christ. He made a way for God to dwell within me and within you. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the most important thing. That's the point of it. That's the sum of the matter. I want a church that's been turned back to the original faith of the disciples. We'll dedicate this church. You know what? This church has already been dedicated. You know, we don't have to dedicate the church. It's been dedicated before. But I want to dedicate the tabernacles of God that come into this church. &gt;&gt; Can we do that? &gt;&gt; Can we dedicate those individual tabernacles that Lord, I want to be the tabernacle? It's a building. Who cares about the building? I want to be that tabernacle. Lord, the tabernacle is not 2555 nor stone. The tabernacle is right here. &gt;&gt; And I want my heart, Lord. &gt;&gt; I want my heart to turn back. I want my heart to turn back to the same faith that Peter had, that same burden that Paul had. Lord, I want that. I Lord, that's my desire. Can you imagine if it really happened? It's going to happen. Jesus prayed that there would be unity, such unity in the church that he would know that they're his disciples because of not their doctrine. We get so messed up. Not their doctrine, but because they love each other. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's too simple. &gt;&gt; That's meat. &gt;&gt; The other stuff is salad. &gt;&gt; That is meat. &gt;&gt; That is what really means something. That's how you will be identified, &gt;&gt; by your love one for another. And then he goes on to say, "And Lord, I pray that there they would love each other so much that other people would know that I'm the Messiah because of their love." Yeah. [applause and music] That's what we want. And it's not pointing our fingers at anybody else. It's pointing fingers right here. Lord, I want to be that tabernacle. If there's only one in the world, Lord, I want to be that tabernacle. This church dedication, this is not a rededication. This church, as I said, it's already been dedicated to the Lord. That's been done. I want a dedication of myself today. &gt;&gt; If you haven't dedicated your life to the Lord, then today is the best day to do it. And if you have dedicated your life to the Lord, today is the best day to do it. &gt;&gt; Put in put the things that are in the past in the past. All the way all the way back. Sometimes it's like, Lord, I'm standing in the mud again. Lord, it made me sick, but I just ate it again. Made me sick again. That's what I pray that sin would be. That every time we sin, it [music] just makes us sick. Yes, &gt;&gt; I can't stand it, Lord. Oh, I did it again. Here I am. It just makes me sick. Then the Lord says, "Ah, now I got something to work with &gt;&gt; now. Now you're doing something now. Now you're my son. I can start forming and here I come down into this vessel and fill you with the Holy Ghost and say, Lord, thank you so much. Thank you, dear God, for filling me. I know I am a child of God, but it it leaked out. I need some more. I need more. Lord, fill me again like you filled Peter and John the second time in Acts chapter 4. [music] &gt;&gt; And then the walls shook that the Holy Spirit was so strong the walls of the building shook and they were of one heart and one soul. Can you imagine a tabernacle, a church where everyone is one soul? They love each other so much. That's what I want to dedicate my life to today. Can we do it in one in one accord, one mind? Will you dedicate your tabernacle to God? Let's all stand. With your heads bowed, Jesus wants to fill that tabernacle. That shikina of glory that's written through the whole Bible. It wants to be in that tabernacle of flesh that you are. It wants to dwell there. God wants it. He loves us. He wrote the book so that we would have a relationship with him. Now, please, please dedicate your life to him. Dedicate your tabernacle to him. Daniel, let's let's sing while we're while we're just thinking on these things. All throughout my history, your faithfulness [singing] has walked beside me. The wind storms make way [music] for every [singing] season from [music] where I'm standing. I see [music and singing] the evidence of your goodness all over my life. All over my life and I [music and singing] see promises in fulfillment. All [singing and music] over my life, all over my life. [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now with our heads bowed, this is not a rededication of a church. This is a dedication of a tabernacle. Dedicate your life to him, friends, now and promise him, Lord, I am yours and you are mine. Oh dear God. Lord, we thank you for all that you've given us, Lord, you've blessed us beyond measure. But, Father, may that same spirit that you promised, Lord, to turn us back to the faith of our fathers, Lord. May it be manifested in us. that spirit of reconciliation, Lord, may we be reconciled with our father after all of our sins and all that we've done. And then, Lord, may we love one another. Stand for one another, Father. Lord, I dedicate my life aresh to you in the name of your son Jesus Christ. Lord, that I might be used on this earth as a vessel, as a tabernacle, of the Holy Spirit, of the pillar of fire, of the shikina glory. Lord, may it rest within me. May it rest within each person in this building. And dear God, may it be manifested outwardly through [snorts] Lord love as you promised that you would pour the love of God out upon us. Lord, pour it right into our souls. We pray and we dedicate our lives to you in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. [singing] Reme [music] just for fear may [singing] come and feel. [music] You [singing] lead my heart to victory. [music] You are my [singing] strength and you always will be. And I see [singing] the evidence [music] of your goodness. Oh, [singing] all over my life. All over my life. [music and singing] And I see [music and singing] your promises in fulfillment [music] all over my life. All over my life. You see the cross and see the cross. The empty grave. [singing] The evidence [music] is sinless. All my sins [singing] rolled away because [music] of you. Oh Jesus. See the cross [singing] the empty grave. The [music] evidence is endless. All my sins rolled [singing] away because of you, oh Jesus. Oh, [music] and I see the [music] evidence of your goodness all over my life. All over my life. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; And I see your promises in fulfillment [music] all over my life. All over my life. &gt;&gt; What a beautiful name [singing] it is. What a beautiful name it is. [music] The [singing] name of Jesus Christ my king. What a beautiful name [singing] it is. [music] Nothing compares to this. What a beautiful [singing] name it [music] is. The name of Jesus.

Nothing compares to this. What a beautiful name it is. The [singing and music] name of Jesus. I want to worship some more. You can be seated if you want to be seated. You can stand if you want to stand. Let's just worship. It's just good, friends. It is just good. Daniel, one more time with the evidence before we we sing. &gt;&gt; I see the evidence [singing and music] of your goodness. All over my life. All over my life. [music] And I [singing] see promises in fulfillment. Oh, all over my life. All over my life. &gt;&gt; There's a beautiful blessing. in the Old Testament. And we're going to hear it, I think, probably sang as beautiful as it's ever been sung. I think maybe the day that it was given. I wonder if it was if it was this beautiful as this blessing that's going to be sang before us now. Remember this is a dedication service. The Lord bless you [singing] and keep you.

Shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword? As it is written, for thy sake we are killed all the day long. We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. Nay, in all things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
