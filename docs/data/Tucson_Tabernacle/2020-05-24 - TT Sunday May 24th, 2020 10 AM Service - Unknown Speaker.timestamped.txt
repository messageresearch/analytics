[27:50] my
[27:52] I will give you
[27:59] you are
[28:04] [Music]
[28:16] the wash
[28:23] but the sons and daughters
[28:26] [Music]
[28:30] hurry
[28:35] I surrendered to the
[28:40] [Music]
[29:04] blender
[29:09] the worshipers
[29:15] that the sons and the daughters
[29:18] [Music]
[29:22] and during my
[29:28] [Music]
[29:32] such a desire this morning even in my
[29:40] life Lord be glorified my life Lord be
[29:53] glorified be glorified
[30:05] [Music]
[30:07] be glorified today in your church
[30:15] in your
[30:22] [Music]
[30:44] amen if you will let him he will but if
[30:49] you'll fight it it'll be a struggle so
[30:51] we we surrender all this will bring the
[30:55] requests to your attention some praises
[30:57] and then just and so when we have a
[31:04] request for my daughter Sarah she's been
[31:08] struggling quite a bit with the port and
[31:11] the doctors want him do some changes and
[31:15] she's asked the Lord that that a request
[31:20] for all these years as it's gone would
[31:21] just continue the same but one of the
[31:24] doctors told her the other day if it
[31:25] doesn't work they're just going to do
[31:27] what they're going to do to her so it
[31:29] kind of puts us in mind also as to and
[31:32] last night me and my wife were talking
[31:34] about it it's it's more on my wife to
[31:37] help take care of her and all but God
[31:41] gave me a scripture brother Jeremy if he
[31:44] would put up Romans sure give him the
[31:48] right scripture Romans chapter 8 verses
[31:56] 35 to 39 as as we were praying and
[32:01] asking God to take control and not
[32:05] reminding him so much as reminding
[32:07] ourselves God does but this is what I
[32:10] felt and I was reading this to my wife
[32:12] who shall separate us from the love of
[32:14] Christ shall tribulation or distress or
[32:18] persecution or famine or nakedness or
[32:22] peril sword then it says as it is
[32:25] written but I think we are killed all
[32:27] the day long we are accounted as sheep
[32:29] for the slaughter this is part of life
[32:33] as God's children but then Paul says no
[32:37] or nay in all these things we are more
[32:40] than conquerors through him that loved
[32:42] us so let the worshipers arise and begin
[32:45] to thank him and praise them with that
[32:48] that's that's our part to say yes Lord I
[32:50] believe said for I am persuaded that
[32:53] neither death nor life nor Angels nor
[32:56] principalities nor powers nor things
[32:59] present nor things to come nor height
[33:02] nor depth nor any creature can separate
[33:05] us from the love of God which has
[33:07] increased Christ Jesus our Lord
[33:09] so I say amen amen to that so we just
[33:13] asked and I'll read the testimony but
[33:16] let's remember sister
[33:17] Cybill Shepherd II for continued health
[33:19] but I'll read you the testimony
[33:23] [Music]
[33:27] brother Robert Chacon says I want to
[33:29] give God the praise and the honor and
[33:31] the glory I had a doctor's appointment
[33:33] on May 15th through the 20s I had blood
[33:36] work done and everything came back fine
[33:38] so thank the Lord for that
[33:41] and then sister Shirley Moore and sister
[33:48] Sarah Connor sister Marilee Carol's that
[33:50] it's from the three sisters first of all
[33:53] we want to praise God that we were able
[33:54] to be back in church amen amen
[33:57] that's good for some of us we've had the
[34:03] opportunity to be here but we've missed
[34:06] you and I'm not going to call all your
[34:07] names out because I might have forgotten
[34:09] some of them already that does it's not
[34:11] hard to do but good to see y'all sister
[34:14] Sarah sister Marilee and sisters myself
[34:18] went to see just sister Gilmore's for a
[34:20] luncheon upon arriving there we found
[34:22] our sister not doing well we thought
[34:25] maybe she had an infection sister Sarah
[34:28] called the paramedics they assessed her
[34:30] and found that she had a fever of 103
[34:32] point 5 but she was responding to them
[34:35] when she asked the questions they
[34:37] decided they said we would not be able
[34:41] to go and be with her but you call in
[34:43] about one and a half hours and they
[34:47] would be able to tell us more after
[34:49] doing some tests we prayed all would be
[34:51] well with her sister sister Sarah called
[34:53] the air ER after one and a half hours
[34:55] and put the year nurse on speaker phone
[34:58] he then said she tested positive for the
[35:01] kovat virus we looked at each other in
[35:03] disbelief he said we would we would be
[35:06] in in a kovat ward or she would be in a
[35:08] kovat award and we could call so later
[35:10] to see later how she was we joined hands
[35:13] and we prayed we rebuke that spirit The
[35:15] Devil's trying to put on our sister and
[35:17] a notic accept that
[35:19] except that the hospital called sister
[35:21] Sarah with our sister's room number and
[35:23] her nurse's name I call the sister
[35:26] siblings daughter and gave her the room
[35:28] number and the phone number so she could
[35:29] get information hers south from her
[35:31] mother nurse after the daughter called
[35:34] the hospital and spoke with the nurse
[35:35] she called me and said the mother did
[35:37] not have the nurse asked where she got
[35:44] the information she said from the ER
[35:45] nurse the nurse said she had pneumonia I
[35:47] just jumped for joy and praise the Lord
[35:49] God is good
[35:51] God is Almighty God is God amen how many
[35:54] have a testimony of the of the grace of
[35:57] God there is time you see God doesn't

[45:21] just sit back and on her couch and have
[45:24] her coffee and and enjoy but there's
[45:28] been labor there's been effort that's
[45:29] went into it amen a lot of effort is
[45:32] went into it but the Jordan has been
[45:34] working tirelessly amen amongst other
[45:36] brothers to upgrade some stuff and to
[45:38] have a good stream amen and so I just
[45:40] like to say today I thank you amen I'd
[45:43] like to also
[45:45] [Applause]
[45:48] and then thank you also I'd like to say
[45:51] thank you to brother Aaron I don't see
[45:52] him wherever he is today who's just been
[45:56] faithful consistent here carrying the
[45:58] midweek services it's difficult I tell
[46:01] you what to preach to a crowd of just 10
[46:05] you know and at 10 or 12 or something
[46:07] like that it can be tough you know it
[46:09] can be it can be hard sometimes but I
[46:11] believe the Lord Amen gives us extra
[46:14] measure of grace amen and I know I
[46:17] experienced that I fell asleep by the
[46:19] errand also he testified of the same
[46:21] thing Amen that even in the midst of
[46:25] separation and and being apart and not
[46:28] having everybody hear things not normal
[46:30] Amen yet the Holy Spirit was here amen
[46:33] and that's the most important person
[46:36] amen I'd like to say a few things you
[46:39] can be seated amen
[46:40] rather than have you continue to be
[46:41] standing keep playing for me got to keep
[46:44] it keep the atmosphere moving here I'd
[46:48] like to say just a couple things today
[46:50] concerning what we've done how we're
[46:55] gathered here today separated apart the
[46:57] church looks twice as full so but we do
[47:02] have some wheat we sent out some
[47:04] guidelines and some just some different
[47:07] recommendations and so I want to just to
[47:09] make a couple comments on that and I
[47:12] don't want to further muddy up the water
[47:14] or your understanding but maybe add
[47:16] clarity to just a couple things I just
[47:20] like to say first and foremost that this
[47:22] has been difficult it's been been very
[47:25] difficult time not just for the rest of
[47:29] the world be even for us as believers
[47:31] we're not made to be a part God didn't
[47:34] design us that way but community is as
[47:37] part of the church and we find that in
[47:40] the book of Acts they they gathered in
[47:42] one place and one Accord we know the
[47:45] scripture says that you assemble
[47:47] yourselves more as you see the Day
[47:50] approaching so we know is from a
[47:52] believers perspective it's tough these
[47:54] kind of things are hard to be distance
[47:57] to be separated to be cut off this has
[47:59] been a difficult time
[48:01] it's been it's been difficult but at the
[48:04] same time I trust that it's accomplished
[48:07] something the purpose that God had in
[48:09] his mind in your life because I believe
[48:13] that the entire world has reacted you
[48:16] know in the way they would react and the
[48:18] world is the the economy has had a
[48:20] reaction it's had an effect governments
[48:23] have had a had a reaction and it's an
[48:26] attack the world has reacted in a
[48:30] certain way and I believe God had a
[48:32] purpose for that but oftentimes God does
[48:34] something and it's a there's multiple
[48:37] purposes there's multiple layers of why
[48:40] God does certain things and I believe
[48:42] that what we should be asking is not
[48:44] sinking our being synchronous with the
[48:47] world and the rhythm that the world's
[48:49] moving to but to ask the Lord Lord what
[48:52] does this mean for me what would you
[48:54] have me learn from this what is it sent
[48:57] to do to me and I believe that's what I
[49:01] expressed before any of this began I
[49:03] expressed it to you and expressed it to
[49:05] my family and I and I and I just said
[49:08] Lord ah I want to hear your voice in the
[49:10] middle of this storm I want to see what
[49:12] are you trying to accomplish in me and I
[49:15] want to come out of this time stronger
[49:18] I want to emerge out of this not weaker
[49:22] not more discouraged but encouraged Amen
[49:27] appreciative of each other appreciative
[49:29] of the house of God of a church we're
[49:31] thankful now more than ever before to
[49:33] have a building where we could gather or
[49:35] we can meet we're thankful for each
[49:38] other and for the fellowship and I
[49:40] believe that there's an importance to
[49:42] fellowship there's a there's a there's
[49:44] an importance to that and I don't
[49:46] believe it's Satan who tries to separate
[49:49] us and push somebody off to the side but
[49:52] there's a harmony there's a there's a
[49:55] strength that comes from unity and
[49:57] fellowship one with another but you know
[50:00] before it all began out of sand Lord ah
[50:02] I want to now more than ever before the
[50:06] drop that the movie the the treadmill
[50:09] has been paused has been
[50:11] you know shut down and you're on that
[50:14] treadmill whether you realize it or not
[50:16] before you know Cova 19 you were busy on
[50:20] that treadmill going as fast as you can
[50:22] you know life was just as normal but
[50:24] then suddenly that treadmill stops and
[50:27] and everything pauses and at that time
[50:30] you know I just begin to think in my own
[50:32] mind I know other ministers have
[50:34] Illustrated it pointed to it of the
[50:36] children of Israel and Goshen when the
[50:38] death angel was passing and they
[50:39] quarantined themselves and they had a
[50:42] stay at home order and it wasn't from a
[50:44] president but it was from Jehovah and
[50:47] they stayed at home and they separated
[50:50] themselves at home but you know what
[50:51] they didn't sit in their houses and see
[50:54] and say well you know what was me you
[50:56] know what a horrible situation I'm you
[50:58] know I'm losing this and but the the
[51:01] Bible teaches us that when they went in
[51:03] their homes they they sacrifice the
[51:06] sacrificial lamb they worked the Lord
[51:09] they had communion they broke bread they
[51:11] had unity they were worshiping the Lord
[51:14] no matter where they were and I think if
[51:17] anything we've learned and the devil has
[51:19] learned a lesson that you can separate
[51:21] us you could break us up you can
[51:23] disconnect us close down our churches
[51:24] but the bride is gonna keep marching on
[51:27] she's gonna stay in rhythm and in
[51:29] harmony with the conductor amen and
[51:31] we're gonna continue we will go on as
[51:34] the Apostle Paul says let us press
[51:36] towards that mark of the high calling in
[51:38] Christ move on go on and so it's been
[51:42] difficult what's been difficult also is
[51:46] the this the timing and knowing what to
[51:50] do and when to come back together you
[51:55] know and I could I could miss my entire
[51:57] sermon and and to speak to you all day
[51:59] on this so I got to be careful here on
[52:01] my time but you know
[52:05] I think that it's been difficult because
[52:08] there's been such a sentiment amongst
[52:10] people that all you know they're there
[52:13] they're closing our churches and and
[52:15] we're just bowing down to the government
[52:16] and we're bowing it well this wasn't a
[52:19] this wasn't a persecution 'el this was a
[52:22] this was a a disease that struck the
[52:24] entire world sports arenas closed down I
[52:26] mean airports shut down airlines are
[52:28] going out of business it the whole world
[52:30] shut down this wasn't a specific attack
[52:32] on churches now we know there's been
[52:35] some of that and disconcerting sections
[52:37] of the country and I'm not getting into
[52:39] politics here today so don't meet me
[52:42] after the service and give me a news
[52:44] article snippet from something some
[52:47] governor said I understand I'm fully
[52:49] aware there's been some of that but that
[52:52] was true before Cova night team the
[52:55] world systems the harlot system is is
[52:59] opposed to amend the kingdom of God
[53:02] that's always been true Jesus says the
[53:05] Antichrist is is at work right now
[53:07] that's not just in our day that we know
[53:09] there's a fulfillment of that but that's
[53:10] been through throughout all history so
[53:12] this hasn't been a spiritual persecution
[53:15] and and so we chose to obey you know and
[53:19] to you know to listen to the guidelines
[53:23] that in fact the governor of Arizona
[53:24] very much like the governor of South
[53:26] Carolina much like the president you
[53:28] know has said emphatically that churches
[53:31] are an essential service and I'm
[53:33] thankful for that and and there's been
[53:36] no order ever to shut churches down but
[53:39] recommendations and guidelines it should
[53:42] be no different than if we lost power
[53:44] and the power grid suffered and we
[53:46] couldn't gather because there was no
[53:47] power no air conditioning to me it's
[53:49] it's been no different than that and so
[53:52] we've approached it cautiously and you
[53:55] know I also know there's a side of this
[53:57] where people say well you know that's
[53:59] just a conspiracy and it's a Trump
[54:01] takedown and it's all this and you know
[54:04] I'm not even gonna get into that today I
[54:05] can say this I'm not a I'm not a
[54:08] conspiracist because there's never any
[54:12] answers there's only questions and I'm
[54:15] not I'm not at all saying that there's
[54:17] not truth to a lot of it
[54:18] but at the end of the day a conspiracy
[54:20] theories just lead you to that a theory
[54:22] and it's never there's never any
[54:24] concrete I don't believe God intends us
[54:27] to live that way but I believe we live
[54:30] by faith we're not even part of this
[54:31] world system we're part of another
[54:33] economy this world is not my home the
[54:36] song says I'm just passing through my
[54:38] treasures are laid up beyond the blue
[54:40] and so we don't we you know we're in the
[54:43] world or not of the world but you know I
[54:45] know that there's probably some truth
[54:47] I'll just say this you know on that day
[54:49] Jesus said there would be a day where
[54:52] the hearts of all men's hearts would be
[54:54] made clear you know that statement it'll
[54:57] all come out in the wash back in back in
[55:00] the South we say it will all come out in
[55:02] the hogwash but it does everything
[55:05] eventually comes to pass eventually all
[55:08] the secrets of all men's hearts will be
[55:11] made clear and and on that day I won't
[55:14] be surprised to learn that our
[55:16] government was involved in this or this
[55:18] government was involved this leader did
[55:19] this and there was a secret deal and
[55:21] secret thing and you know but if you're
[55:23] not careful friends let me just
[55:24] admonished you here just for a moment if
[55:26] you're not careful you get so you you
[55:29] ingest so much of that anxiety and fear
[55:32] and and suspicion that's not how God
[55:37] called us to live we live by faith by
[55:40] discernment not suspicion by revelation
[55:44] amen and so enough said on that I'll
[55:48] just say that you know that we can we
[55:50] can go either way with this and I know
[55:52] that I think the majority of a lot of
[55:54] our attitudes has been well you know
[55:56] it's big deal it's blowing over it's out
[55:59] of here and you know and I honestly I
[56:01] think South Carolina and Arizona
[56:02] synchronous and about the same stages
[56:04] and the governors are very similar both
[56:06] conservative and they've approached it
[56:09] really lightly not real they've not had
[56:12] a tight grip but very loose with the
[56:14] laws and you know in different things
[56:16] and we haven't been hit very hard
[56:17] Arizona hasn't been hit very hard but I
[56:20] tell you what it's hit a lot of places
[56:23] really hard and there's no denying that
[56:26] I know we'd like to deny it but there's
[56:28] no denying this disease has has taken
[56:31] the lives of messy
[56:32] believers there's been pastors who have
[56:34] gotten this a former pastor back home
[56:37] his wife 69 years old passed away just
[56:39] last week from coronavirus so we can
[56:43] approach it and say aw big deal it's all
[56:45] just you know it's all just hype and I
[56:46] get it tight I get there's a lot of hype
[56:48] to it but you know I think the attitude
[56:50] we have to be balanced we have to be in
[56:52] the middle of the road not a little
[56:54] ditch on the left not in the ditch on
[56:55] the right but we've got to be balanced
[56:58] in everything that we do and that's what
[56:59] we've tried to do so with our guidelines
[57:03] and our recommendations we've put forth
[57:05] I know that you're not going to agree
[57:07] with all of them and you're not gonna
[57:09] feel the same way that we feel but can I
[57:12] just ask you today to give us a little
[57:14] bit of grace as brothers and then just
[57:16] trying to be led of the Holy Spirit and
[57:18] do as we feel led and I know none of you
[57:20] like being distanced today and I'll also
[57:22] say that you know there's gonna be no
[57:25] there's no police here and we're not
[57:28] gonna police what you do and what you do
[57:30] is your business at your own discretion
[57:31] if you hug or shake hands or whatever no
[57:34] one's know deacons gonna come to you and
[57:36] and SWAT you on the hand you know you do
[57:40] that as you feel it's our recommendation
[57:41] that you don't but that you don't
[57:44] congregate and all those things we've
[57:46] put out as our requests but I just want
[57:49] to make it clear we've said the same
[57:50] thing about those that are 65 years and
[57:52] older and you know the underlying health
[57:54] conditions we'll leave that at your
[57:56] discretion if you want to come and
[57:59] you're here today well then that's at
[58:00] your own choosing and we're gonna
[58:02] evaluate this day by day where we are
[58:06] today may be different than where we are
[58:08] next weekend and so just pray for us
[58:11] that we were letting the Holy Spirit and
[58:13] you know as I said we could you know we
[58:17] could go there's churches who have much
[58:18] higher being much more strict than what
[58:20] we are today
[58:21] you know our churches back home
[58:23] denominational churches aren't open at
[58:25] all they're not open until in August and
[58:28] so we don't know what tomorrow holds but
[58:30] we know who holds tomorrow amen and
[58:33] that's who our confidence is in it's not
[58:35] in a man
[58:36] amen and I believe he's got it all under
[58:38] his control amen and we've not been
[58:42] given the spirit of fear but of power
[58:45] and of love and of a sound mind
[58:47] and then stand to your feet with me if
[58:49] you have your Bible amen thank you
[58:55] sisters so I've also you know it was
[59:01] quite shocking to me when we came here
[59:04] it was very difficult out of analysis
[59:06] before we once I get into a preaching
[59:08] Darrell won't be able to stop so we it
[59:13] was difficult getting here our flights
[59:15] that we normally take into Tucson were
[59:17] not available they were plus one day
[59:19] every single flight was 24 hours total
[59:21] so you'd have to stay in your connection
[59:23] to go the next day so Phoenix was the
[59:25] only option and typically there's I
[59:27] think four flights from Phoenix from
[59:29] Atlanta and there was that's been
[59:31] limited to one and so I was really
[59:34] praying Lord get me on that plane didn't
[59:37] know for sure what would happen and even
[59:39] warned some of the brothers here about
[59:40] that you know and it was it was shocking
[59:43] to me when I landed in Atlanta the
[59:45] busiest airport in the world and it was
[59:48] a ghost town I was not expecting that at
[59:50] all that businesses were shut down and
[59:53] gates over everything and you know and
[59:55] and we're typically in a concourse
[59:58] there's thousands there was literally
[59:59] just hundreds just a few hundred at any
[1:00:02] given time made me realize real quick
[1:00:03] that you know back home and I'm sure
[1:00:05] here in Tucson it seems like things are
[1:00:07] this is blowing over and things are
[1:00:09] getting back to normal but in other
[1:00:11] parts of the world it's not that way not
[1:00:13] completely that way so we have to take a
[1:00:16] very early morning flight out of Phoenix
[1:00:19] tomorrow I debated on just leaving after
[1:00:22] the service today and going to Phoenix
[1:00:23] to get some rest before him amen but I
[1:00:26] don't want to do that I've asked for the
[1:00:27] law I was allowed to preach and Minister
[1:00:29] first tonight so he's gonna be taking
[1:00:31] this evening sir
[1:00:32] part of it so we're going to move the
[1:00:35] service up tonight to 4:00 p.m. so
[1:00:38] that'll be 4 p.m. for the evening
[1:00:40] service and get a little less pressure
[1:00:42] to have to to get back a man I got to be
[1:00:44] at the airport about 5:00 a.m. I got
[1:00:46] here at about 10 o'clock last night so
[1:00:48] if I'm a little fog
[1:00:50] maybe not myself then you just you just
[1:00:52] overlook it today hey man I don't think
[1:00:56] I've forgotten anything if you have your
[1:00:57] Bible let's turn to the book of second
[1:00:59] Samuel chapter 11
[1:01:01] second Samuel Chapter 11 amen
[1:01:10] welcome all of our visitors and our my
[1:01:13] family that's here mayn't good to see
[1:01:15] everybody in the house of the Lord we
[1:01:18] have something upon our heart we just we
[1:01:20] just want to be obedient to and it's not
[1:01:23] at all what you'd probably stereotypies
[1:01:26] the sermon for the first service back
[1:01:29] together
[1:01:29] I wanted to preach something very
[1:01:31] different but the Lord had other plans
[1:01:33] and and I learned a long time ago just
[1:01:36] to obey and just just to be obedient to
[1:01:40] the Lord and and so we just have
[1:01:42] something upon her heart you know the
[1:01:44] Lord God doesn't do stereotypes
[1:01:47] you know we stereotype things and we put
[1:01:49] everything in a box and tradition and
[1:01:51] it's got to be this way and God just
[1:01:53] steps out of our box and and he's God
[1:01:56] he's sovereign amen and he does what he
[1:01:58] wants to do amen and we just want to be
[1:02:01] in we want to be in harmony with his
[1:02:02] plan and so today I'd like to speak to
[1:02:05] you here in 2nd samuel chapter 11 and a
[1:02:09] lot of this is going to be very
[1:02:12] evangelistic is just the way the Lord's
[1:02:14] woke me up even in the middle of the
[1:02:16] night and then early this morning about
[1:02:18] 5 a.m.
[1:02:18] started just to deal with dill upon the
[1:02:21] heart and burden me with this and so I
[1:02:23] just would like you to be sensitive to
[1:02:25] the voice of the Lord amen today can you
[1:02:28] do that and then say Lord let me be
[1:02:30] sensitive to your voice amen and hear
[1:02:33] what you have to say I'd like to speak
[1:02:35] to you today on a time of war a time of
[1:02:39] war second samuel chapter 11 and it came
[1:02:44] to pass after the year was expired
[1:02:46] at the time when Kings go forth to
[1:02:49] battle that David sent Joab and his
[1:02:52] servants with him in all Israel and they
[1:02:54] destroyed the children of Amon and
[1:02:56] besieged Rabbah but David tarried still
[1:03:00] at Jerusalem and it came to pass in
[1:03:03] evening tide that David arose from off
[1:03:06] his bed and walked upon the roof of the
[1:03:08] king's house and from the roof he saw a
[1:03:10] woman washing herself and the woman was
[1:03:13] very beautiful to look upon David said
[1:03:16] and inquired after the woman and once
[1:03:18] said is not this Bathsheba the daughter
[1:03:21] of Eliam the wife of Uriah the Hittite
[1:03:25] and David sent messengers and took her
[1:03:29] she came in unto him and he lay with her
[1:03:30] for she was purified from her and
[1:03:32] cleanness and she returned unto her
[1:03:34] house the woman conceived and sent and
[1:03:37] told David and said I am with child
[1:03:39] David sent to Joab saying send me Uriah
[1:03:41] the Hittite and Joab sent Uriah to David
[1:03:45] we know how the rest of the story most
[1:03:48] of us know how it goes
[1:03:50] David brings him in and David has Uriah
[1:03:53] murdered and so we'd like to look in
[1:03:56] Ecclesiastes chapter 3 if you have just
[1:03:59] turn over there let's read here just for
[1:04:01] a few verses and we'll have you be

[1:05:08] let's just bow our heads here together
[1:05:10] Lord Jesus we father all Lord bow our
[1:05:14] heads here today looking Lord from the
[1:05:17] dust to the ground father from whence we
[1:05:19] came knowing Lord and reminded father of
[1:05:22] our own human frailty Lord our own human
[1:05:26] weakness Lord but we stand here today
[1:05:29] father
[1:05:29] just seeking something from above Lord
[1:05:33] longing for something Lord that you
[1:05:35] would speak God that would inspire us
[1:05:38] that would rebuke us that would Lord
[1:05:41] challenge us God your word has the
[1:05:43] ability to do all of those things Lord
[1:05:45] so I ask God that you would come Lord
[1:05:48] we're gonna cover Lord something that's
[1:05:50] maybe very difficult Lord to read about
[1:05:53] but it's in your word Lord in your word
[1:05:55] says that these things were the Word of
[1:05:57] God has given for repute for reproof or
[1:06:00] reboot for rebuke Lord that the man of
[1:06:03] God may be thoroughly equipped Lord and
[1:06:05] I pray God you would come and speak to
[1:06:07] us out of your word may Lord the hearts
[1:06:09] of all of your children that are here
[1:06:11] under the sound of my voice Lord those
[1:06:14] that are streaming at home Lord those
[1:06:16] that will listen to this by way of
[1:06:17] archived God may your Holy Spirit run to
[1:06:22] their need we ask we believe and we
[1:06:24] trust in you now in Jesus Christ's name
[1:06:26] amen you can be seated
[1:06:28] amen this morning Solomon speaks here of
[1:06:38] at of a season and a time to every
[1:06:42] purpose under the heaven he tells us in
[1:06:45] verse 8 that there's a time of war and a
[1:06:49] time of peace I'm going to quickly cover
[1:06:51] just some of the ground work for this
[1:06:54] sermon here and then we'll move to maybe
[1:06:55] another photo of it and come back to it
[1:06:57] but I'd like to look here at this time
[1:07:00] of war and a time of peace you'll find
[1:07:04] in 2nd Sam scripture that the Bible says
[1:07:08] it came to pass and follow if you could
[1:07:10] there with me and your Bible just turn
[1:07:13] back over to second Samuel 11 and hold
[1:07:15] your place theirs we're going to read it
[1:07:17] and then a few times as we speak on this
[1:07:19] today it says then it came to pass and
[1:07:22] verse 1 after the year was expired at
[1:07:25] the time when Kings go forth to battle
[1:07:29] so we know that this
[1:07:31] a season now a lot of this is ancient to
[1:07:35] us and maybe unrelatable to us here
[1:07:38] today but there was especially in those
[1:07:41] days there was a season there was a time
[1:07:44] when you went to war and then there was
[1:07:47] a time when you stayed at home and
[1:07:49] that's why Solomon says there's a time
[1:07:51] of war and there's a time of peace and
[1:07:54] and a king had to be a discerning man he
[1:07:58] had to understand the season in which he
[1:08:00] lived and we know that the Old Testament
[1:08:03] with the Kings was was a lot about war
[1:08:06] and it's a lot about battle and there's
[1:08:08] a lot of stories you can read about
[1:08:10] victory and their stories you can read
[1:08:12] about defeat I believe it translates to
[1:08:16] something greater than a historical
[1:08:19] account to us today but I believe it
[1:08:21] speaks to the very fibers of our being
[1:08:25] as men as women as sons and daughters of
[1:08:29] God serve it in the army of the Lord
[1:08:31] that whether you realize it or not we're
[1:08:35] in a war and you're in a constant battle
[1:08:38] and there is a war that's happening we
[1:08:43] know that the Bible and revelation
[1:08:44] speaks of a war that broke out in heaven
[1:08:46] and then it comes into the earth and so
[1:08:49] we know that in other realms and in
[1:08:51] other dimensions there's a spiritual
[1:08:54] battle taking place there's always a
[1:08:56] struggle taking place there's always a
[1:08:59] struggle happening you could take it
[1:09:01] into the ethereal into the realm of God
[1:09:03] and you could even go down into your
[1:09:06] very daily life you're in a daily
[1:09:10] struggle you're in a daily battle you're
[1:09:13] in a daily war people think come serve
[1:09:16] the Lord and all my battles are over and
[1:09:18] all my troubles over brother Branham
[1:09:22] said like the old old sister said to him
[1:09:24] said that's when my trouble began that's
[1:09:27] when my war started that's when all of
[1:09:29] the struggle started because now there's
[1:09:32] a voice inside of you that wants to do
[1:09:35] right but there's a flesh that doesn't
[1:09:38] seem to always line up to that you know
[1:09:40] I believe that we're living in an age of
[1:09:43] troubled people
[1:09:44] to where
[1:09:45] there's we see a time of trouble like
[1:09:47] never before
[1:09:49] there's a-there men's minds are
[1:09:51] suffering today from a troubled mind and
[1:09:56] that troubled mind that troubled speaks
[1:09:58] of a continual or a permanent state of
[1:10:02] discontentment and I believe that the
[1:10:04] age that we live in today is so
[1:10:06] pressured at such a pressurized age and
[1:10:10] we live in it today we're not exempt
[1:10:12] from some of that pressure but the world
[1:10:14] lives in constant pressure it lives in a
[1:10:17] state of chaos and if you ever study the
[1:10:21] chaos theory it's amazing how many
[1:10:24] spiritual types are in just the chaos
[1:10:26] there if where you have you you you have
[1:10:29] a sense of peace and a sense of of you
[1:10:33] know of prosperity middle of that
[1:10:37] there's chaos on on every side you take
[1:10:39] the man who invest in the stock market
[1:10:41] it's a it's a lie it's a it's a constant
[1:10:44] chaos just up and down and up and down
[1:10:46] and wins and losses the world is
[1:10:49] pressured it's it's Restless the age we
[1:10:53] live in is more Restless than ever
[1:10:55] before there's no calm there's no time
[1:10:58] of peace there's no rest for anybody
[1:11:01] Humanity is in a constant state of worry
[1:11:05] he's always worried about his future
[1:11:08] he's always worried about the risks that
[1:11:11] he's taking him
[1:11:12] what will he have for his tomorrow and
[1:11:15] and so he's always constantly in a state
[1:11:17] of labor trying to to put up so that he
[1:11:21] can he's always taken care of and he's
[1:11:24] always under that pressure
[1:11:25] he's always best that's not unique to
[1:11:28] just a sinner that's that's how me and
[1:11:31] you always feel every single day since
[1:11:33] the days of the fall there has been a
[1:11:35] pressure there has been a disturbance a
[1:11:40] restlessness to what they had in Eden
[1:11:45] man is always fretting about his future
[1:11:49] and if he's not afraid about his future
[1:11:51] then he's fretting about his past and
[1:11:53] what he missed out on him what he didn't
[1:11:55] do in his circumstances and I'm
[1:11:58] convinced
[1:11:59] that now more than ever before and it's
[1:12:02] you and it's it's very became even more
[1:12:04] like a neon sign it's emboldened with
[1:12:07] this pandemic that the world is going
[1:12:10] through its emboldened now that we live
[1:12:14] in an age to where there's more troubled
[1:12:18] minds than ever before more troubled
[1:12:20] spirits than ever before than any times
[1:12:23] any time past and you know it's amazing
[1:12:28] to me to see how troubled a believer can
[1:12:30] come I can't Ken can become how troubled
[1:12:33] we can get in our own spirits with fear
[1:12:35] and be overcome with anxiety and
[1:12:37] worrying about this and worrying about
[1:12:39] that and you can see you can see it
[1:12:42] today that that that there's a constant
[1:12:45] distress and a constant trouble just
[1:12:48] give me a moment here I'm deviating from
[1:12:50] sermon but I just felt the Lord pressing
[1:12:53] me to go in this direction but so many
[1:12:56] people are so troubled in their mind and
[1:12:59] you know for decades and for millennia
[1:13:01] now the the experts you know you have an
[1:13:04] expert for everything they never they
[1:13:07] rarely name the expert that they just
[1:13:10] say expert
[1:13:12] know that if you do this and you will
[1:13:13] who are these there they never they
[1:13:16] never linked them there's no citation
[1:13:18] there's always just the experts have
[1:13:21] said you need to wear a mask and the
[1:13:23] experts have now said you don't need to
[1:13:25] wear a mask and you know it's like who's
[1:13:27] the experts here and and the experts of
[1:13:31] secular experts of for years have told
[1:13:34] people they have preached a sermon that
[1:13:37] prosperity is the answer to all of your
[1:13:40] problems and just get more you know than
[1:13:43] what you have and and they asked
[1:13:45] rockefeller that and they said what how
[1:13:47] much is enough and he said just a little
[1:13:49] more than I've got and there there's
[1:13:51] always just that constant sense you know
[1:13:55] to to be more increased than you were
[1:13:57] yesterday and it's always this the this
[1:14:01] message that's preached that you know
[1:14:03] prosperity is the answer to all of our
[1:14:05] problems all of humanity's issues and
[1:14:08] all of their problems just get a good
[1:14:11] education and then you go to college and
[1:14:13] you get a a good job and then you get a
[1:14:16] nice house and and then you put money in
[1:14:18] the bank and and and then you become a
[1:14:20] celebrity and and you go and you become
[1:14:23] you know worshipped and you get all this
[1:14:25] fame and you can imagine Oh a person has
[1:14:28] all that surely they just live in peace
[1:14:29] and they live in harmony and they've got
[1:14:31] everything you know if I could just be
[1:14:33] that guy oh if I could just be that
[1:14:35] person who seems like they got
[1:14:36] everything and there's they got more
[1:14:38] than they've ever been you know than
[1:14:39] anybody else but yet we find some of
[1:14:41] those celebrities dead at 21 years old
[1:14:44] dead at 19 years old
[1:14:45] to drugs and to alcohol into pills and
[1:14:48] you say what is it what does it mean
[1:14:50] brother Matt money's not the answer
[1:14:53] sometimes prosperity is more of a curse
[1:14:56] than poverty money's not the answer
[1:15:01] popularity is not the answer and the
[1:15:03] answer you know and we can see some of
[1:15:06] the people who have rose to great Fame
[1:15:09] and great success yet they still are
[1:15:11] empty yet they still a restless yet they
[1:15:14] still no matter how much they gain
[1:15:16] they're never content with what they
[1:15:18] have that there's never any peace
[1:15:20] because there's only peace in Jesus I
[1:15:23] know that's so simple but I'll say it
[1:15:25] again
[1:15:26] there's only peace in Jesus there's
[1:15:28] really you only know peace when you meet
[1:15:30] the person the Prince of Peace
[1:15:33] and that kind of peace means that you
[1:15:35] may not have anything you may not have
[1:15:38] no money you may have trouble you may
[1:15:39] not have the greatest success in your
[1:15:42] human life but in the midst of all of
[1:15:44] that calamity and in the middle of all
[1:15:46] of that trouble there's a deep settled
[1:15:48] peace down inside of your soul it's an
[1:15:51] anchor that always holds that's why
[1:15:54] Jesus says the peace I give not as the
[1:15:57] world gives but the peace that I give
[1:15:59] passes your own intellectual
[1:16:01] understanding if and you can you always
[1:16:05] have this message you know if everyone
[1:16:07] can just have a piece of the pie of the
[1:16:10] American dream and the experts say that
[1:16:13] all of our crime problems would go away
[1:16:15] our drug problems would be solved it you
[1:16:18] know the the the the same theory states
[1:16:21] that people end up as alcoholics and
[1:16:24] addicts because they never had any
[1:16:26] self-worth in their life their poverty
[1:16:28] deprive them of opportunities they would
[1:16:30] have been provided with them with a you
[1:16:33] know a sense of dignity so now we just
[1:16:35] provide them with you know a decent
[1:16:37] paying job a good place to live a
[1:16:39] regular income then you know their lives
[1:16:42] would just be fine and all their
[1:16:43] problems
[1:16:45] would just go away then I just ask you
[1:16:47] then why isn't the world happy why isn't
[1:16:51] the whyatt why aren't we at peace why is
[1:16:53] there war
[1:16:54] why is there conflict why is there
[1:16:56] struggles with other nations why is
[1:16:59] there constantly an issue if money
[1:17:00] prosperity if all of this American dream
[1:17:03] is the answer to all of our problems
[1:17:05] then why are so many people so troubled
[1:17:09] in their mind today they have everything
[1:17:13] that they've been told they need to be
[1:17:16] fulfilled
[1:17:17] they make good incomes have good
[1:17:19] vacations they you know they they smoke
[1:17:23] the nicest cigars and drink the most
[1:17:25] expensive wine and have all the the
[1:17:28] greatest pleasures of the world they
[1:17:31] drive the most expensive cars and and
[1:17:34] they but but yet those same people have
[1:17:37] to go to bed
[1:17:38] two sleeping pills those same people
[1:17:40] have to wake up in the morning and have
[1:17:42] a hat you know and and and most of some
[1:17:45] of the most richest people in the world
[1:17:46] or some of the most addicted to drugs
[1:17:49] and alcohol and they sit on the other
[1:17:51] end of the bottle if that was supposed
[1:17:53] to manufacture happiness then my brother
[1:17:56] and my sister why is the world such an
[1:17:59] unhappy place you here today Jesus gives
[1:18:05] us a warning he says there shall be
[1:18:07] signs in the Sun and then the moon and
[1:18:09] in the Stars and upon the earth distress
[1:18:11] of Nations with perplexity I read this
[1:18:17] this morning and I just thought my
[1:18:20] goodness I don't think I could read a
[1:18:22] better no matter how eloquent a man
[1:18:24] could be I could never read a more
[1:18:26] accurate definition of the day of 2020
[1:18:32] perplexity he says in Luke 21 that men's
[1:18:38] hearts would fail them for fear and and
[1:18:41] for looking after those things which are
[1:18:43] coming upon the earth for the powers of
[1:18:45] heaven shall be shaken then shall they
[1:18:47] see the Son of man coming in a cloud
[1:18:49] with power and great glory and notice he
[1:18:51] says and when these things begin to come
[1:18:53] to pass then look up and lift up your
[1:18:56] heads for your Redemption draweth nigh
[1:19:00] you know Jesus speaks of these end times
[1:19:02] and said it would be so frightening
[1:19:04] people would literally drop from heart
[1:19:07] failure that their hearts would fail
[1:19:09] them for fear and I believe we're
[1:19:11] witnessing some of those things even
[1:19:13] today were witnessing those things the
[1:19:16] world chaos the the chaos the
[1:19:19] bewilderment the confusion of the news
[1:19:21] that you read every single day don't
[1:19:24] don't don't be load to sleep by this age
[1:19:27] my brother my sister the world was dying
[1:19:30] long before March that the stress of
[1:19:35] nations were here before Kovan they were
[1:19:38] here there it wasn't a rosy picture that
[1:19:41] we all if I can just go back to normal
[1:19:43] but let me ask you was it really normal
[1:19:46] before is this what is this what God had
[1:19:51] in mind
[1:19:51] this kind of economy oh let me just say
[1:19:56] this world is not my home
[1:19:57] just passing through my treasures are
[1:20:01] laid up somewhere beyond the blue I'm
[1:20:04] longing like hey bruh ham to see a city
[1:20:06] whose builder and maker is God whose
[1:20:08] economy is established by God who has
[1:20:11] one king and he's on the throne he's the
[1:20:14] light of all of the world believe I'm
[1:20:16] going to that place one day and yet
[1:20:20] Jesus tells us in the middle of all this
[1:20:23] perplexity in the middle of all this
[1:20:25] distress he gives us a reassurance in
[1:20:28] our soul and says see that you be not
[1:20:32] troubled see that you be not troubled
[1:20:37] for all these things must come to pass
[1:20:40] but the end is not yet we know Matthew
[1:20:43] 24 very well the fact is let me just say
[1:20:47] this here today and this is where we
[1:20:50] wanted to come to here's what the real
[1:20:53] truth is for the believer uh no none of
[1:20:57] us as a believer no true servant of the
[1:21:00] Lord no true son or daughter of God is
[1:21:02] going to be concluded really troubled I
[1:21:04] mean not to say that you wouldn't have
[1:21:06] worry in your life but really it's not
[1:21:08] the potential loss of anything material
[1:21:11] that troubles us it's not the loss of
[1:21:14] anything in this life that troubles us
[1:21:15] but the the real plague of troubles
[1:21:18] comes in a different realm for a
[1:21:20] believer comes in a spiritual realm and
[1:21:25] Paul speaks of what calls to him
[1:21:27] perplexity and what calls him distress
[1:21:31] in Romans chapter 7 Paul says it this
[1:21:34] way says for that which I do allow that
[1:21:38] which I do allow not that which I don't
[1:21:42] want to do in my spirit I find myself
[1:21:45] doing those things that that inner man
[1:21:50] wants to do I don't find that that I do
[1:21:54] them Paul says he says it this way for
[1:21:58] the good that I would do not he says for
[1:22:01] the good that I would I do not but the
[1:22:03] evil which I would not
[1:22:05] that I do what is what is Paul saying
[1:22:08] this is the perplexity of the Christian
[1:22:10] as a desire for righteousness it's a
[1:22:15] desire for holiness it's a desire to be
[1:22:18] pleasing to the Holy Spirit yet we look
[1:22:21] at this carnal nature and it perplexes
[1:22:24] us can you say Amen Paul saying the very
[1:22:28] thing that I don't want to do I end up
[1:22:30] doing but the one thing I would love to
[1:22:31] do so much in obedience to God I can't
[1:22:34] seem to figure out how do I accomplish
[1:22:37] this I believe he was speaking for me I
[1:22:40] believe he was speaking for you I read
[1:22:42] those words and I say that's exactly how
[1:22:44] I feel Paul you felt it then I feel it
[1:22:47] now I want to be pleasing to the Lord
[1:22:49] it's not my desire that gets me in
[1:22:51] trouble it's this carnal nature that
[1:22:53] that never seems to like the things of
[1:22:55] God and I've got to struggle I've got to
[1:22:58] I've got to push I've got a I've got a
[1:23:00] press to be spiritual I've got to
[1:23:02] struggle to read my Bible I've got to
[1:23:04] press to to have a good attitude in the
[1:23:07] midst of trial but let me say this to
[1:23:09] you my brother my sister let it be an
[1:23:10] encouragement the struggle is
[1:23:12] intentional God made it that way
[1:23:16] and let me go further the struggle is
[1:23:18] good for you are you here that struggle
[1:23:23] that you feel to always you you have
[1:23:26] that that struggle that inward man
[1:23:28] struggle that I got I got a press to
[1:23:31] constantly I find myself cooling off and
[1:23:34] I find myself you know getting lukewarm
[1:23:36] on the Lord and I'm not reading my Bible
[1:23:38] like I used to and oh and I just feel so
[1:23:40] bad and I just feel so that's so all fun
[1:23:43] I'm not a good Christian and I'm not
[1:23:44] what I should be that's how God designed
[1:23:47] it that struggle that you feel is
[1:23:49] healthy for you spiritually God made it
[1:23:52] that way I believer wants to do right
[1:23:58] they want to live holy want to live pure
[1:24:00] they they hate the sin that does so
[1:24:05] easily beset them tempts them disrupts
[1:24:10] their communion with the Lord
[1:24:16] yet somehow we find ourselves
[1:24:19] continually going back to it let me say
[1:24:23] this to you the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:24:27] the true family of God are not worried
[1:24:29] about an economic crash or the world's
[1:24:33] crisis's they're not worried about that
[1:24:36] nearly as much as they're fretting in
[1:24:39] their spirit over their failures in the
[1:24:41] past week to the Lord I've read much
[1:24:44] more over my shortcomings than I do
[1:24:47] about the world economy I've read much
[1:24:52] more about what I didn't do that I
[1:24:54] should have done for the Lord last year
[1:24:56] I'm more stressed about that it's more
[1:24:59] of a crisis to me right now then what's
[1:25:02] happening with with this pandemic you
[1:25:07] know III believe that that even that in
[1:25:09] your own life you can you can get a
[1:25:11] besetting sin and maybe something in
[1:25:13] your life that comes upon you and and
[1:25:15] and now you're grieved maybe over
[1:25:17] something that you thought you had the
[1:25:19] victory over and remember I'm just this
[1:25:22] is brother Matt the Evangelist today so
[1:25:23] give me some grace here I may have to
[1:25:26] take off of the kid gloves here today
[1:25:28] and just be real honest with you can you
[1:25:30] appreciate that I believe we could know
[1:25:34] our true spiritual condition by how
[1:25:38] troubled we are over the sin in our life
[1:25:41] I believe we can have a barometer and a
[1:25:45] good measuring line of how spiritual we
[1:25:48] really are not how loud you shout or how
[1:25:50] high you jump but our real spiritual
[1:25:53] measuring line it can be measured by how
[1:25:56] for how much worried or how much how
[1:26:00] much how troubled you are over the
[1:26:03] failures you see in your life
[1:26:06] spiritually you could say this that your
[1:26:10] righteousness can be measured by your
[1:26:13] unwillingness to accept anything that
[1:26:16] grieves the Lord Jesus you you find the
[1:26:23] sin although we've got to turn corners I
[1:26:24] wish I can continue going in this
[1:26:26] direction but I just got to turn here
[1:26:28] and I believe we're going to directing
[1:26:30] this so it's okay David comes to such a
[1:26:34] place in his life and the scripture says
[1:26:38] here that that it's a time of war it's a
[1:26:41] time of it's a time when Kings go to
[1:26:43] battle 2nd Samuel chapter 11 it said it
[1:26:46] come to pass after the year was expired
[1:26:49] at the time when Kings go forth to
[1:26:51] battle but David sent job and have
[1:26:53] servants with him and all Israel may
[1:26:55] destroy the children amen and besieged
[1:26:56] Rabbah
[1:26:56] notice this this this last sentence here
[1:27:00] but David tarried still at Jerusalem I
[1:27:06] don't want to get ahead of myself here
[1:27:08] today but as I read those words I just
[1:27:12] iiiiii remember when I read this for the
[1:27:14] first time I just said out loud I said
[1:27:17] why oh if you would have just went to
[1:27:20] battle David like you should have been
[1:27:21] if you wouldn't have stayed in Jerusalem
[1:27:24] all how much calamity you could have
[1:27:27] saved your family if you would have just
[1:27:30] been in sync with the harmony of the
[1:27:33] Holy Spirit if you would have discerned
[1:27:35] that this is a time of battle and not a
[1:27:37] time of peace there was a time when it
[1:27:39] was okay to be in the castle in
[1:27:41] Jerusalem but then there was a time when
[1:27:44] it was detriment to the kingdom for the
[1:27:46] King to be in Jerusalem and David failed
[1:27:50] to discern this you can go and read
[1:27:52] chapter 11 and they're fighting the
[1:27:54] ammonites and they go in Chapter II led
[1:27:57] chapter 10 you can read after 10
[1:27:59] fighting the ammonites in chapter 9 and
[1:28:02] they almost conquer them but they don't
[1:28:04] completely wipe them out they they have
[1:28:06] a partial victory and chapter 11 should
[1:28:09] have been about David going back as a
[1:28:12] king with his troops to finish the job
[1:28:16] but what we find is something very
[1:28:18] different in David the Bible says at the
[1:28:22] time when the season when war is
[1:28:25] supposed to take place it's not a time
[1:28:27] of peace it's a time of war David
[1:28:29] decides to stay home you know there's a
[1:28:34] there's an amazing thing an amazing
[1:28:38] principle we should say that you can
[1:28:41] find
[1:28:42] the Word of God and believe it's a
[1:28:43] principle that remains ever true and the
[1:28:47] principle is this that no matter how
[1:28:50] much you may try you cannot hide from
[1:28:53] God there's a principle here in the word
[1:28:58] of what we're going to look into it just
[1:28:59] in a moment that no matter how much the
[1:29:02] facade you build or where you go or what
[1:29:04] place you go to one of the greatest
[1:29:06] truths in life that we live by one of
[1:29:10] the greatest principles and and all of
[1:29:12] us today someday will learn that lesson
[1:29:16] whether we've learned it today or not
[1:29:17] is that there is no escape from God
[1:29:22] there is no place you can run to where
[1:29:25] he's not there is no there is no
[1:29:28] pleasure you can bury yourself in there
[1:29:31] is no there is no replacement that you
[1:29:34] can give yourself to satisfy yourself
[1:29:36] enough to escape from God and like a
[1:29:39] fugitive we can run from the presence of
[1:29:42] God but ultimately we can't hide God
[1:29:48] penetrates the darkness no matter how
[1:29:51] what you cover up with no matter what
[1:29:53] cover and you use and let me just say
[1:29:56] this if you manage to dodge him in your
[1:29:58] life if you manage to run from him and
[1:30:01] dodge him your entire existence here on
[1:30:04] earth
[1:30:05] you're still gonna stand and be exposed
[1:30:07] before him one day I'd rather face him
[1:30:12] now his brother branham said I'd rather
[1:30:13] face him as anything just not a coward
[1:30:15] I'd rather face him now and be judged by
[1:30:18] let my life be judged now by the Word of
[1:30:22] God than than then because now there's
[1:30:26] mercy glory it's an amazing principle
[1:30:32] that David learns it's what the Bible
[1:30:36] says very simply be assured that your
[1:30:40] sins will find you out he speaks of
[1:30:44] something here in weekend we're going to
[1:30:46] pick it up in the scripture you don't
[1:30:47] have to turn brothers if you could put
[1:30:49] it on the screen includes yes these
[1:30:50] eight verse 11 I want to read some of
[1:30:52] these because this is Ecclesiastes 8
[1:30:55] verse 11 because sentence against an
[1:30:59] evil work is not executed speedily
[1:31:02] notice follow closely here because
[1:31:04] sentence the passage of a sentence is
[1:31:06] not executed speedily against an evil
[1:31:09] work therefore the heart of the sons of
[1:31:11] men is fully set in them to do evil in
[1:31:14] other words just because you don't reap
[1:31:18] what you sow the day after you sew it
[1:31:22] doesn't mean you're not going to reap
[1:31:25] what you sow I know it's a very simple
[1:31:28] principle but this is what Solomon is
[1:31:31] saying here that just because you plant
[1:31:33] a seed and you don't see any results
[1:31:36] from that seed doesn't mean that there's
[1:31:37] a seed that's gonna you're gonna reap
[1:31:39] harvest that goes both ways so a good
[1:31:42] seed start doing the right things in
[1:31:45] your family for your children for your
[1:31:46] home for your marriage you may not see
[1:31:48] the results right away but you'll reap
[1:31:51] what you sow you sow a seed of
[1:31:54] discrepancy you you'll reap what you sow
[1:31:56] numbers chapter 32 verse 23 this is this
[1:32:01] is an amazing scripture says but if you
[1:32:02] will not do so behold you have sinned
[1:32:05] against the Lord and be sure this
[1:32:08] numbers 32:23
[1:32:09] be sure your sin will find you out he
[1:32:14] what a what a picture he paints here of
[1:32:17] a of a searching that your sins will
[1:32:21] literally haunt you they'll follow you
[1:32:23] and brother Branham said some men's sick
[1:32:26] for them some men's follow after them
[1:32:30] you know and any sincere your sins he
[1:32:34] says your sins will find you like a like
[1:32:37] a fugitive you're you you may run you
[1:32:40] may go you may move you may change the
[1:32:42] dynamics of your life but there always
[1:32:45] be sure your students will always find
[1:32:48] you and the wages of sin we know is
[1:32:51] death it's never worth it you'll pay the
[1:32:55] price and it's never never worth it it's
[1:32:59] an amazing thing because he says here in
[1:33:02] Isaiah 59 let me just read a few more of
[1:33:04] these
[1:33:05] Isaiah chapter 59 verse 1 and verse 2
[1:33:08] I'm filling pressure
[1:33:09] from time so uh so just let me not go
[1:33:12] too fast and we'll stop I'll pull the
[1:33:14] parachute when uh when I'm when the
[1:33:16] Lord's ready you okay he says behold the
[1:33:20] Lord's hand this is Isaiah 59 the Lord's
[1:33:23] hand is not shortened that it cannot
[1:33:25] save neither is his ear heavy that it
[1:33:27] cannot hear but your iniquities have
[1:33:29] separated between you and your God and
[1:33:31] your sins have hid his face from you
[1:33:34] that he will not hear Isaiah 29 verse 15
[1:33:39] woe unto them that seek deep to hide
[1:33:42] their counsel from the Lord and their
[1:33:44] works are in the dark and they say who
[1:33:46] cieth us and who knoweth this job
[1:33:48] answers that question and we can we know
[1:33:51] it by memory says for his eyes job says
[1:33:54] for behold he says his eyes are upon the
[1:33:57] ways of man and he cioth all his goings
[1:34:03] he knows your heart of hearts he knows
[1:34:06] the deed the depth of your conscience he
[1:34:09] looks beyond the facade or the portrait
[1:34:13] we give to everybody else and it's
[1:34:18] amazing because sin has something ends
[1:34:22] Oh such a but the man he preached at
[1:34:24] home sin today I am so just bear with me
[1:34:27] here I believe it's what the Holy Spirit
[1:34:29] just began to burden upon my heart sin
[1:34:33] and especially remember brother Brennan
[1:34:35] says gives us this he says the sinner
[1:34:37] doesn't sin a sinner is sin a believers
[1:34:40] who he who sins he says because a
[1:34:43] believer has the ability to backslide
[1:34:45] have the ability no backsliding brother
[1:34:47] branham covers that he says now
[1:34:48] backsliding doesn't mean you're not
[1:34:49] saved he said Paul even the Apostle Paul
[1:34:52] says I died daily so so there's a
[1:34:56] constantly he says mortify the deeds of
[1:34:59] your flesh so there's there's constantly
[1:35:01] a potential to fall from grace what is
[1:35:05] what does it even mean to backslide the
[1:35:08] Senate means to miss the mark so secret
[1:35:13] sin causes us to hide it's an amazing
[1:35:16] response that you see here in fact I'll
[1:35:18] say this is an automatic response after
[1:35:22] sin is to hide you can see that in in
[1:35:25] Genesis with Adam the very first
[1:35:28] reaction emotional the very first
[1:35:31] reaction that a human makes after he
[1:35:34] sins is he hides the first thing Adam
[1:35:37] did and God comes down and says Adam
[1:35:40] Adam we're at the hall I was afraid Lord
[1:35:42] so I hid myself it's an automatic
[1:35:46] response and let me just let me go just
[1:35:49] here for a moment in labor in this it's
[1:35:51] in that reaction it's in that hiding
[1:35:55] that Satan tries to create a covering
[1:35:59] and that covering oftentimes is religion
[1:36:02] and if we're not careful we pacify our
[1:36:04] conscience and we pacify our our
[1:36:07] condemnation with religion and it's just
[1:36:09] a covering we go to church and we look
[1:36:13] the part we dressed the part we act the
[1:36:15] part we talk the part and we we that's
[1:36:19] exactly where Satan wants to take us to
[1:36:21] he wants to push you into a closet he
[1:36:25] wants to push you in the dark
[1:36:27] he wants to shut the lights off let no
[1:36:29] let it be concealed just cover it up no
[1:36:31] one who ever know just just Powell put
[1:36:33] it put you know put something over top
[1:36:35] oh but but the Holy Spirit doesn't well
[1:36:39] God doesn't want you to cover that up
[1:36:40] God wants to expose it because he knows
[1:36:43] it's in the exposing in the light to
[1:36:46] where the devil is defeated in your life
[1:36:50] you you begin to hide and people have
[1:36:53] creates they create a religion uh a and
[1:36:57] then you become a wonderer that's why
[1:37:00] Cain became he become it became a
[1:37:02] vagabond a wonderer it's what the
[1:37:04] scripture says about him there was a
[1:37:06] very big difference between a very
[1:37:10] symbolic mark and came and that was that
[1:37:13] Cain couldn't repent wasn't it was not
[1:37:19] the act of the murder of murdering his
[1:37:23] brother follow this here just for a
[1:37:26] moment that was not the problem God even
[1:37:31] says if you'll do well you you know God
[1:37:33] that you won't you be received
[1:37:35] even God tries to go to Cain and tries
[1:37:37] to talk to him
[1:37:38] if murder is what separated the seed of
[1:37:42] God from the seed of Satan if it was the
[1:37:45] act if it was the behavior if it was the
[1:37:48] murder then David would you'd have to
[1:37:49] say David was a seed of Satan because
[1:37:52] David murders Uriah you say then brother
[1:37:55] Matt what's the difference they're both
[1:37:56] murderers the difference is is that when
[1:37:58] Cain was confronted with his sin he
[1:38:01] refused to repent but David when he was
[1:38:04] confronted had the ability to repent and
[1:38:07] turn around and go the other way he had
[1:38:12] something in his heart that wouldn't let
[1:38:14] him stay in that condition you become a
[1:38:20] wonderer and and you you you know that's
[1:38:23] exactly what happens to a person they
[1:38:25] begin to wonder and this is what this is
[1:38:28] exactly what Cain turns into is a
[1:38:31] fugitive a a vagabond that's why the
[1:38:34] Bible says sin lieth at the door and it
[1:38:36] shall become thy master you know the
[1:38:38] statement all too well we quoted it last
[1:38:40] Sunday sin will take you further than
[1:38:43] you want to go it'll cost you more than
[1:38:45] you want to pay and it will keep you
[1:38:47] longer than you intended to stay you
[1:38:51] begin to wonder spiritually wonders you
[1:38:54] know if warts a wonderer brother man
[1:38:55] it's like a person those who seem to
[1:38:57] have no spiritual direction and their
[1:39:00] life they're just aimless just going
[1:39:02] about pillar to post church to church
[1:39:04] place the place camp the camp they go in
[1:39:08] circles you know a wonder or sort of
[1:39:11] this goes in a circle he searches for
[1:39:13] old landmarks and old historical
[1:39:15] boundaries brother Branham preaches that
[1:39:17] sermon about the spiritual amnesia and
[1:39:19] he talks about the the the soldier boy
[1:39:22] that came back from war he gets off the
[1:39:24] train and he says and he didn't know
[1:39:26] where he was he said he just had amnesia
[1:39:28] so shell-shocked from battle
[1:39:30] forgotten who he was forgotten you know
[1:39:32] where he lived and and and that amnesia
[1:39:35] that begins to set in you you go into
[1:39:38] that cycle of sin you know that that
[1:39:41] cycle of constant you know what the
[1:39:43] cycle of sin is where you you you sin
[1:39:46] and then you repent and you go into the
[1:39:47] same thing
[1:39:48] and you repent then you do the same
[1:39:49] thing then you repent then you do the
[1:39:50] same thing you repent then you do the
[1:39:53] same thing
[1:39:54] say it again brother Matt you repent and
[1:39:56] you do the same thing
[1:39:57] it's that cycle there's and there's but
[1:40:00] there's never a victory it's no
[1:40:02] overcoming in that but you know the
[1:40:05] greatest danger in that place is what
[1:40:09] the Bible refers to as a seared
[1:40:12] conscience and there's a conscience
[1:40:16] searing that takes place when you stay
[1:40:19] in that pattern and you never have
[1:40:21] victory in your life and there's a
[1:40:23] searing that can take place to where you
[1:40:25] become theirs you become apathetic
[1:40:29] towards spiritual apathy 'he's one of
[1:40:32] the greatest worst diseases the preacher
[1:40:37] can diagnose in someone spiritual apathy
[1:40:41] you know I would rather have a person
[1:40:43] that's why Jesus says I'd rather you be
[1:40:44] hot and cold how hot or cold than
[1:40:47] lukewarm because I would rather take a
[1:40:50] person who's just completely doesn't
[1:40:52] want anything to do with with God
[1:40:54] doesn't want anything to do with
[1:40:55] Christian living I'd rather have that
[1:40:57] person than a person who just yeah yeah
[1:41:00] well I mean yeah big deal I know the
[1:41:05] word says that I know that yeah mmm just
[1:41:07] that apathy apathy comes from a
[1:41:11] conscience that's been seared David is
[1:41:16] at risk for this and we're gonna move
[1:41:18] through his life here he's at risk for
[1:41:20] this and it's amazing because this the
[1:41:22] sin here with David and Bathsheba it's
[1:41:26] as you begin to read it
[1:41:28] speaking of hear it it says that it's a
[1:41:31] time when Kings go to war look at it
[1:41:34] they're in second Samuel Chapter eleven
[1:41:36] I'm gonna try to hurry it's a time when
[1:41:40] Kings go to war it's springtime
[1:41:45] springtime my favorite season it is my
[1:41:49] favorite you know if it was up to me
[1:41:52] it'd be spring all always springtime you
[1:41:57] know it's a time when Kings go to war
[1:42:02] it was important it was important to
[1:42:05] fight during the right time if you
[1:42:08] waited until winter then it was too late
[1:42:11] and it was it was so I know what fought
[1:42:13] in the winter it was the time of peace
[1:42:14] because in the winter time there was
[1:42:16] your men had no no way to eat from the
[1:42:19] fruit that the ground was bare and
[1:42:21] everything was cold and and and and so
[1:42:23] you don't fight in the wintertime you
[1:42:25] know your men will die in the cold you
[1:42:27] don't wait until summer especially in
[1:42:30] Tucson you don't wait until summer
[1:42:32] that's not the time of war I'm trying to
[1:42:35] get you to catch something here that
[1:42:37] that there was a season that that the
[1:42:40] King had to discern that there was a
[1:42:42] time when there was a battle to take
[1:42:45] place and it was important that he
[1:42:47] didn't fail to discern the season it was
[1:42:52] important with spring it was a time of
[1:42:54] life a time when Kings go to war
[1:42:57] circumstances had arisen in such a way
[1:43:00] when it was important for you David the
[1:43:03] King the father the leader the head of
[1:43:06] the home it was important for you to be
[1:43:09] at war not in your castle not in your
[1:43:15] castle David the Bible says he last
[1:43:17] verse their last sentence but David
[1:43:19] tarried still at Jerusalem you know I
[1:43:23] wrote this just as the Lord gave it to
[1:43:25] me and meant something very personally
[1:43:27] to me a time when when dads go to war
[1:43:33] not to stay at home and lose their
[1:43:35] children but a time to fight a time when
[1:43:38] leaders go to war to fight for their
[1:43:42] family to fight you say brother man is
[1:43:44] it a struggle it's a struggle and you've
[1:43:47] got to be willing to fight in that
[1:43:48] struggle to fight for righteousness to
[1:43:51] fight for godliness to fight for
[1:43:54] holiness when the world is pushing
[1:43:56] against it so hard when the systems of
[1:43:59] the world are pushing against everything
[1:44:01] godly it's not a time to give up or sit
[1:44:04] down or give in or compromise it's a
[1:44:07] season of war my brother my sister
[1:44:08] you're in a season of battle you're in a
[1:44:11] season of war this isn't the time to get
[1:44:14] lukewarm it's not the time to
[1:44:16] stop reading your Bible it's not the
[1:44:18] time to to get lackadaisical in the age
[1:44:20] you live in it's the time to be
[1:44:22] spiritual it's the time to be zealous
[1:44:25] for the Lord Jesus it's a time more than
[1:44:29] ever before to have sincerity to have
[1:44:34] sincerity and consecration as brother
[1:44:37] Branham has the vision of the Mumba and
[1:44:39] Annie says you can bind him remember
[1:44:41] that the mama that struck the brother in
[1:44:43] the vision and and then the voice comes
[1:44:45] to brother Branham and he says you can
[1:44:47] bind him and he says but you need to be
[1:44:50] more sincere sincerity is an important
[1:44:54] thing to the Lord
[1:44:55] consecration and dedication you say how
[1:44:58] do I do that brother Matt well how do
[1:45:02] what does that even look like for the
[1:45:03] man it's a life that is focused and not
[1:45:08] distracted it's a it's a determination
[1:45:13] spiritually that you come to in your
[1:45:15] life to where you say I no matter what
[1:45:19] the cost is the song says whatever it
[1:45:22] takes Lord to draw closer to you that's
[1:45:26] what I'll be willing to do whatever it
[1:45:29] costs me it was a time of battle it was
[1:45:32] a time for a higher calling it was a
[1:45:35] time for the love of God to abide it was
[1:45:39] a time for for worship real worship in
[1:45:42] spirit and in truth it was a time for
[1:45:45] greater dedication it was a time for a
[1:45:48] determination to serve the Lord it was
[1:45:51] it was a time of battle of time to fight
[1:45:53] a time for spiritual maturity and not
[1:45:57] spiritual empathy not a time to be at
[1:46:00] home and let others fight for you David
[1:46:04] but the king should be on the
[1:46:07] battlefield there's a season you'll go
[1:46:11] through in your life you know I'll just
[1:46:13] stop here and get practical here for a
[1:46:15] moment
[1:46:15] there's a season you go through in your
[1:46:17] life I don't care what stage of life
[1:46:18] that you're in even as a teenager
[1:46:21] there's a season in your life to where
[1:46:23] you you go through a struggle harder
[1:46:26] than you've ever struggled before
[1:46:29] and and it comes to as the brother
[1:46:31] branham said it comes to a time of
[1:46:33] decision he preached that message this
[1:46:35] season that you hit in your life to
[1:46:37] where to leave and you become your Havis
[1:46:41] you have a maturity and you've got to
[1:46:43] make a decision you know it's it's it's
[1:46:46] it's a true statistic that you know
[1:46:49] though even if I'm a statistic from a
[1:46:52] Christian point of view that those that
[1:46:55] are going to make a decision to serve
[1:46:56] the Lord do it before the age of 18 and
[1:47:00] they say that beyond the age of 18 19
[1:47:03] you get over that age it's it there
[1:47:06] there becomes a hardening of the heart
[1:47:11] can I get anybody to witness that here
[1:47:13] today there becomes a hardening that
[1:47:16] happens in your heart and that
[1:47:18] tenderness that you have at that young
[1:47:20] age oh that's why more than ever before
[1:47:23] it's it's the duties the duty the the
[1:47:26] the the onus is on us as parents to tell
[1:47:31] our children about Jesus to form their
[1:47:35] their their understanding in their mind
[1:47:37] through the examples not through the
[1:47:40] serve not through the the do's and the
[1:47:42] don'ts
[1:47:43] not through the stunts to the code of
[1:47:45] legalism that listen that that that's
[1:47:47] never going to save your children
[1:47:48] they've got to see a life that lives
[1:47:51] behind and real true living color
[1:47:53] they've got to see a real example you
[1:47:56] say brother Matt do they need to see our
[1:47:57] dad who's perfect absolutely not see a
[1:48:00] mother who never makes mistakes
[1:48:02] I don't that'll destroy them worse but
[1:48:05] they've got to see a man who's a real
[1:48:07] man who can make mistakes but he can
[1:48:09] repent for his mistakes they've got to
[1:48:12] see a desire to sincerity that this home
[1:48:15] we want it to be a spiritual home we
[1:48:18] want to have a spiritual house we want
[1:48:20] an atmosphere where the Lord is pleased
[1:48:21] to dwell you go through that struggle in
[1:48:26] your life somewhere in your years and
[1:48:28] you've got to make a decision and it's
[1:48:31] harder to make that decision later in
[1:48:33] your life let me just give you the words
[1:48:37] of the Apostle Paul today is the day of
[1:48:40] salvation
[1:48:41] you don't have a promise of tomorrow you
[1:48:45] go through a season in your marriage
[1:48:47] maybe a struggle a time a hard time and
[1:48:53] none of us are exempt from that because
[1:48:55] this is how God intended it to be growth
[1:48:58] only comes their struggle growth only
[1:49:02] comes through trouble you know we wish
[1:49:06] it would be springtime all the time I
[1:49:07] wish it would be I wish it was always
[1:49:09] that time of year you know my wife loves
[1:49:11] winter she wish it would just be cold Oh
[1:49:14] year long and just to have a fireplace
[1:49:16] going all year long we I'm just I'm not
[1:49:19] that way at all I can't relate I can't
[1:49:22] wait for the cold season to be over and
[1:49:25] some people like the summer I don't know
[1:49:27] why but some people like the summer they
[1:49:30] love it just to be Hana you know I like
[1:49:33] I like in the summer as long as I have
[1:49:35] air conditioning and a good one a good
[1:49:39] air conditioning system but we would
[1:49:41] want it to be summer or maybe winter or
[1:49:44] maybe spring oho you know but God didn't
[1:49:47] intend and God doesn't grow anything by
[1:49:50] one season but everything that's gonna
[1:49:52] have to grow go through a winter it's
[1:49:55] gonna have to go through a struggle it's
[1:49:57] gonna have a spring time where there's
[1:49:59] life and there's peace it's gonna have
[1:50:00] to go through an order it's gonna have
[1:50:02] to go through a full you've got to learn
[1:50:04] to say Lord no matter what season of
[1:50:07] life I find myself in I'm gonna worship
[1:50:10] you the same I'm gonna serve you the
[1:50:12] same I'm going to press the city no
[1:50:15] matter what you're trying to do in my
[1:50:17] life it doesn't matter what you're
[1:50:19] trying to bring forth whether it's
[1:50:20] sorrow whether it's a hard time a good
[1:50:23] time a time of peace a time of war let
[1:50:25] me learn to serve you no matter what
[1:50:28] season I find myself in this was
[1:50:33] important for David to understand that
[1:50:37] it was a time to stay on the battlefield
[1:50:40] it wasn't a time to stay home and it
[1:50:48] sent home that castle that he stays in
[1:50:53] let me just say this to you here today
[1:50:55] he didn't stay home to write songs some
[1:51:05] people I just I'm you know I'm gonna
[1:51:07] stay home at church stay home from
[1:51:08] church I'm just gonna become more
[1:51:09] spiritual I'm gonna pray I thought why
[1:51:12] are you staying home he didn't stay home
[1:51:15] to meditate on the law of Moses he
[1:51:18] didn't stay home to you know to write
[1:51:20] another summer or to eat he stayed home
[1:51:24] for what by all purposes of second
[1:51:28] Samuel 811 his purpose was to stay home
[1:51:31] was to stay in bed to be lazy that's
[1:51:39] exactly what the scripture says he's not
[1:51:41] raised it up in the morning he wakes up
[1:51:42] in the evening what a cycle he gets on
[1:51:46] he's sleeping in are you with me here
[1:51:48] today hope that's okay yeah he he'd he'd
[1:51:52] he stays home it's he stays in in the
[1:51:56] midst I want you to catch this and the
[1:51:58] time of war and the season when he
[1:52:00] should be spiritual in the season when
[1:52:02] his children need him the most and his
[1:52:04] children when his family needs him the
[1:52:06] most in a season when God needs him the
[1:52:08] most when he should have went back and
[1:52:11] finished the ammonites off instead of
[1:52:15] finishing the job he stays home he stays
[1:52:22] in bed he stays and the Bible says that
[1:52:26] he wakes up and and he and we know the
[1:52:30] story everything falls apart after that
[1:52:33] he doesn't he gets up in the middle of
[1:52:35] the night and he's walking around his
[1:52:37] rooftop and sees this woman and and you
[1:52:39] know and then and then her the man
[1:52:43] because he's an as you slurred in school
[1:52:45] he's in the wrong place at the wrong
[1:52:47] time doing the wrong thing and all you
[1:52:52] teenagers said Amen doing the wrong
[1:52:58] thing
[1:52:59] and you know this is this cycle starts
[1:53:02] in his life because he's out of sync
[1:53:04] with the Holy Spirit when you become out
[1:53:06] of sync and out of harmony with the Holy
[1:53:08] Spirit in your life you can expect
[1:53:11] calamity and find homes you expect
[1:53:13] calamity and your teenagers expect
[1:53:15] calamity and your job expect calamity in
[1:53:17] your marriage you fall out of sync and
[1:53:19] out of harmony with the word he stays
[1:53:23] there and the Bible says that we know
[1:53:26] the story let me just say this to you
[1:53:28] here today prosperity can sometimes be
[1:53:33] dangerous you know it's as we said it's
[1:53:36] sometimes more dangerous than poverty
[1:53:38] and adversity and we don't like
[1:53:42] adversities we do everything possible to
[1:53:45] stay away from adversity to stay away
[1:53:49] from trouble to stay away from calamity
[1:53:53] no one goes looking for it
[1:53:55] no one goes searching for it no one's
[1:53:58] asking for more of it you don't pray and
[1:54:00] say God let me suffer greater let me let
[1:54:02] me suffer more you know no one prays
[1:54:05] that we do everything we can to avoid it
[1:54:08] to avoid adversity you know he and this
[1:54:11] was no doubt where David was in his life
[1:54:14] he comes to a place in his life and I
[1:54:17] want you to pause the David in the
[1:54:19] castle here for a moment and let's
[1:54:22] rewind the tape just for a moment let's
[1:54:24] go back to 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 years
[1:54:29] David's a young man younger and he's
[1:54:32] he's in a cave with just some men and
[1:54:37] this is a very different season in his
[1:54:39] life he's not a king at this point he's
[1:54:41] he's not doesn't have a castle as I have
[1:54:44] a throne that prosperity he's just a
[1:54:48] shepherd boy with an anointing on his
[1:54:50] life and a promise from a prophet and he
[1:54:56] takes what he's got and the Bible says
[1:54:59] that he's running he's he's in a cave
[1:55:01] now I want to ask you a question
[1:55:03] maybe I've asked this here before I'll
[1:55:05] just ask it again which David would you
[1:55:08] choose I want to give you two versions
[1:55:11] of David you have
[1:55:12] David in the castle now let let me tell
[1:55:15] you something let me tell you about this
[1:55:16] David David in the cave this David ten
[1:55:19] years before in the cave is running for
[1:55:23] his life
[1:55:24] from a man named Sol who's tried on
[1:55:26] multiple occasions to take his life he's
[1:55:32] living in constant stress he's living in
[1:55:35] constant worry he's living in constant
[1:55:37] anxiety you know he's sleeping with one
[1:55:40] eye open
[1:55:41] he's always looking over his shoulder
[1:55:43] and you know it's all gonna try to kill
[1:55:45] me he can't he flees from Sol the Bible
[1:55:48] says he runs from him and he's he's
[1:55:51] living not in that tent not in a house
[1:55:53] he's living in a cave he's taking his
[1:55:56] baths in creeks the fairy few baths that
[1:56:01] he's able to get he's he's surrounded by
[1:56:06] pressure he's surrounded by stress he's
[1:56:10] surrounded by adversity he's surrounded
[1:56:12] by worry he's constantly worried he's
[1:56:15] constantly just under this constant
[1:56:17] struggle in his life now take that David
[1:56:23] let me give you another David fast
[1:56:24] forward ten years he's in a castle he's
[1:56:29] got money in the bank all the money he'd
[1:56:33] ever need he's got servants he's got
[1:56:36] maid servants he's laying in a hammock
[1:56:38] you know and he's got his servant sir
[1:56:41] waving him with palm branches keeping
[1:56:43] the Flies away
[1:56:45] he brings in one of his singers and they
[1:56:48] begin to sing to David oh how great is
[1:56:51] David how mighty is David he's kicked
[1:56:53] back arms behind his head kicks back no
[1:56:56] rat no worry he's got no struggle he's
[1:56:59] the king of the world
[1:57:02] he got no he got enough salt chasing him
[1:57:04] no worry no stress man got it all no
[1:57:07] trouble not worried about anything just
[1:57:09] got it made in the shade which David
[1:57:14] would you choose about us ask yourself
[1:57:18] that question which David would I choose
[1:57:23] see here David will struggle David with
[1:57:25] worry stress you say it anxiety for the
[1:57:27] Matt yeah not many you know rare rare
[1:57:31] occasions he could take a bath yeah a
[1:57:34] lot of trouble
[1:57:36] yeah yeah a lot of stress yeah and that
[1:57:39] David in the castle he's no no you no no
[1:57:41] no seemingly no problems at all you know
[1:57:44] most of us would take that David but let
[1:57:46] me let me let me reveal something to you
[1:57:48] about the David with adversity versus
[1:57:50] the David with no stress the David in
[1:57:54] the castle was the most vile corrupted
[1:57:59] cold backslidden David you can read
[1:58:04] about and the David in the cave was the
[1:58:09] David that you opened your Bible to the
[1:58:11] Book of Psalms and you begin to read
[1:58:14] Psalms because those Psalms that you
[1:58:17] loved and all my favorite Psalms Psalms
[1:58:18] 119 Psalms 27 Psalm 63 those Psalms were
[1:58:22] not written in the castle with no
[1:58:24] adversity and no trouble and no pain in
[1:58:26] his life those Psalms were born out of
[1:58:29] the David and the cave the David who
[1:58:32] struggled the David who had stress that
[1:58:36] David who had worried that David who Eng
[1:58:38] had anxiety but it was in that crushing
[1:58:41] and under that pressure that inspiration
[1:58:44] comes flowing freely from David you will
[1:58:48] never find a more spiritual in sync in
[1:58:51] harmony with the Holy Spirit David than
[1:58:53] the David who had trouble adversity and
[1:58:56] pain in his life
[1:59:01] we questioned so many times the trouble
[1:59:04] in our own life God why does it got to
[1:59:07] be this way as I said at the beginning
[1:59:09] I'll say it again the struggle is good
[1:59:11] for you
[1:59:14] how many Psalms do you think David and
[1:59:18] it's palatial bed and and and and and
[1:59:21] Palace with with everything around him
[1:59:23] none zero numero Saito he didn't write
[1:59:30] anything he he he's living has
[1:59:33] everything but he's no meditation of the
[1:59:37] there's there's there's you know there's
[1:59:40] nothing there's there's no meditation
[1:59:43] that takes place and David when he was
[1:59:45] interred in Jerusalem instead of being
[1:59:48] on the battlefield you know I don't
[1:59:50] believe for one minute we're to pray and
[1:59:52] say God just make my life trouble and
[1:59:53] just give me as much worry as you can no
[1:59:55] none of us need to pray that but on the
[1:59:58] other hand we should recognize that
[2:00:00] success is often a greater test than
[2:00:05] adversity and often times when it
[2:00:08] appears that everything's going my way
[2:00:10] we are in the greatest danger in our
[2:00:13] life that's why the Bible says I think
[2:00:15] it's in the book of James let no man say
[2:00:18] when he is tempted that he is tempted of
[2:00:21] God for God doesn't tempt any man he
[2:00:26] says but each one is tempted when he is
[2:00:30] carried away picked up and carried away
[2:00:34] and enticed by his own lusts and when
[2:00:40] lust has conceived it gives birth it
[2:00:44] brings forth it reaps sin and when sin
[2:00:51] is finished it brings forth death and
[2:00:57] sin doesn't stay it's not static it's
[2:01:00] dynamic it snowballs it gets greater it
[2:01:02] gets larger it gets bigger what sin
[2:01:05] starts his murder and starts as adultery
[2:01:07] turns into a murder and then a murder
[2:01:10] turns into a cover-up and a cover-up
[2:01:12] turns into a lie and it's all a big
[2:01:15] facade look just look at the progression
[2:01:17] that this takes place in his life it
[2:01:21] starts out as a very private only Joab
[2:01:24] and David knows about it it ends with
[2:01:28] the whole world finding out about it
[2:01:34] concealment trying to conceal now notice
[2:01:37] this here can I have just a few more
[2:01:38] minutes I know we're almost 12 o'clock
[2:01:40] and now you're hungry but just give me
[2:01:42] just a minute David's sin notice what
[2:01:47] proverbs this is a scripture you
[2:01:49] probably know very well power
[2:01:50] 28:13 says he who conceals his
[2:01:53] transgression shall not prosper but he
[2:01:57] who confesses and forsakes them will
[2:01:59] find compassion out of sin he says when
[2:02:04] I kept silent my body wasted away
[2:02:08] through my groaning all the day long he
[2:02:11] says in verse 4 for day and night your
[2:02:13] hand was heavy upon me my vitality is
[2:02:17] drained away as with the fever heat of
[2:02:20] summers with the fever and the heat of
[2:02:22] summer
[2:02:22] what is David saying that it was in that
[2:02:25] time when he tries to cover this whole
[2:02:27] thing up and just no one will know and
[2:02:29] I'm just gonna get away with it I'm just
[2:02:30] gonna keep going I don't need to tell
[2:02:32] anybody I could use prick keep pressing
[2:02:34] through it it says it's all gonna work
[2:02:35] itself out I got this all figured out
[2:02:37] you know I can figure all this out I'll
[2:02:39] I'll put out all the fires where
[2:02:41] everything will be fine
[2:02:43] yet when he lays his head on his pillow
[2:02:45] at night and he's it's just him the
[2:02:47] pillow and the ceiling David knows who
[2:02:51] he is
[2:02:51] and you know you know you you can you
[2:02:55] can be anybody at church you could be
[2:02:58] anybody in front of your family your
[2:03:00] parents your husband your wife but when
[2:03:03] it's you and the pillow and the ceiling
[2:03:05] and God you know you know you know what
[2:03:08] manner of person you are david says this
[2:03:12] in Psalms 119 and I want to I want to
[2:03:14] show you this just here you don't need
[2:03:15] to turn here as it begins to struggle
[2:03:18] with this just he begins to come to this
[2:03:22] place to where he says that he becomes
[2:03:24] miserable Satan will convince you that
[2:03:27] sin to Springs pleasure its pleasure for
[2:03:29] a season but after that it's misery and
[2:03:34] David's plagued with the guilt he can't
[2:03:37] sleep he can't eat he's he's not
[2:03:40] sleeping he's not he's losing weight and
[2:03:43] you know it seems like such a horrible
[2:03:45] time now whether David realizes it and
[2:03:47] realizes it or not the suffering that is
[2:03:51] going through is the tender loving hand
[2:03:54] of Jehovah it's God beginning to soften
[2:03:58] his heart and it's it's God it were it's
[2:04:02] God's greatest gift
[2:04:04] of Mercy that God begins to tenderize
[2:04:07] his heart they begin to tenderize his
[2:04:11] spirit David says this in Psalms 119 by
[2:04:14] the Jeremy if you could put it up somes
[2:04:16] 119 in verse 59 this is such a key note
[2:04:20] verse here for me and maybe we could
[2:04:23] just we could Center and on it here
[2:04:24] before we close he says I thought on my
[2:04:28] ways I thought on my ways you imagine is
[2:04:34] he suffering through all of that and
[2:04:37] he's laying his head on his pillow at 90
[2:04:39] this verse I thought on my ways but the
[2:04:42] Brandon preaches a sermon as I thought
[2:04:44] on my ways and he picks up this verse
[2:04:46] here David begins to think on his ways
[2:04:50] and it begins to think of all of the
[2:04:53] calamity in his life and everything that
[2:04:56] he had done brother Bentham says and I
[2:05:00] don't have it for the screen you can
[2:05:01] keep that up prophet of God says here
[2:05:04] and he says David after he had did wrong
[2:05:07] and took your eye of the Hittites wife
[2:05:09] the lovely Bathsheba and was gonna be
[2:05:11] the father of her child and caused her
[2:05:13] gallant husband to be killed in battle
[2:05:14] when the prophet Nathan come in and
[2:05:17] revealed his sins to him then David
[2:05:20] thought on his ways and he turned
[2:05:23] himself to repentance and sackcloth and
[2:05:25] ashes and listen to what he says here he
[2:05:28] says that's the way to turn God heard
[2:05:32] him God will always hear a man or a
[2:05:36] woman that'll turn their feet to his
[2:05:41] testimony God will always hear a man or
[2:05:47] a woman that'll turn not their
[2:05:49] confession not their mouth not how you
[2:05:51] come up here and cry at the altar but
[2:05:53] when you turn your feet to his testimony
[2:05:57] brother Adam says that gets God's
[2:05:59] attention and he says oh he says it
[2:06:02] should it should bring us to repentance
[2:06:04] in cycle office and confession what the
[2:06:08] church needs tonight is a confession
[2:06:10] making right to come back to the
[2:06:12] testimony of the Lord
[2:06:14] there's mercy there's forgiveness
[2:06:17] seems like it would haunt people going
[2:06:19] on know that you're walking hour by hour
[2:06:21] in the face of death
[2:06:22] why do we continue in selfishness greed
[2:06:24] and ungodliness and our eyes on the
[2:06:26] things of the world it's time we turn
[2:06:29] back to God's testimonies as I thought
[2:06:31] on my ways I turned my feet to thy
[2:06:35] testimonies God tenderizes the heart of
[2:06:40] David and and and it prepares him for
[2:06:43] this moment when God is going to bring
[2:06:46] this prophet Nathan in his life second
[2:06:52] Samuel Chapter twelve turn there in your
[2:06:54] Bible and we'll just read this here I
[2:06:58] promise I'm closing
[2:07:07] this is going to be God's greatest gift
[2:07:10] of mercy was sending him a prophet that
[2:07:14] would expose his sin Nathan confronts
[2:07:18] David and says notice what he says here
[2:07:21] in 2nd Samuel chapter 12 the Lord sent
[2:07:24] Nathan unto David and he came unto him
[2:07:26] and said unto Him there were two men in
[2:07:28] one city the one rich and the other poor
[2:07:30] the rich man had exceeding many flocks
[2:07:32] and herds but the poor man had nothing
[2:07:34] saved one little ewe lamb which he had
[2:07:35] bought a nourished and grew up together
[2:07:36] with him with his children to eat of his
[2:07:39] meat drink of his own cup lay in his
[2:07:40] bosom
[2:07:41] what son to him as a daughter there came
[2:07:43] a traveller into the rich man and spared
[2:07:45] to take of his own flock and of his own
[2:07:46] herd to dress for the Wayfarer and man
[2:07:48] that was come unto Him but took the poor
[2:07:50] man's lamb and dressed it for the man
[2:07:52] that was come to him he's painting the
[2:07:54] picture of a marriage he's painting the
[2:07:57] picture of Uriah Bathsheba David do you
[2:08:00] realize what you've destroyed do you
[2:08:03] realize in your arrogance and in your
[2:08:05] pride you realize what you've done
[2:08:08] David at this point it's covered up no
[2:08:10] one knows just at least he thought Joab
[2:08:15] David but now Nathan gives him this
[2:08:19] story notice here he says here in verse
[2:08:22] in verse five and David's anger was
[2:08:27] greatly kindled against the man and he
[2:08:29] said to Nathan as the Lord liveth the
[2:08:31] man that has done this thing shall
[2:08:34] surely die and he shall restore the lamb
[2:08:39] fourfold because he did this thing and
[2:08:43] because he had no pity remember when
[2:08:48] Jesus says that for with what measure
[2:08:52] you mete it shall be meted unto you and
[2:08:56] you judge we're so quickly to judge a
[2:08:58] situation it's amazing to me how people
[2:09:01] can judge other people in a situation
[2:09:05] that you've never went through yourself
[2:09:07] it's amazing how is the family of God we
[2:09:10] can become so judgmental I've watched
[2:09:14] I've watched
[2:09:16] I shouldn't go this way but I will I've
[2:09:21] watched I've watched young married
[2:09:23] couples who criticize other couples who
[2:09:28] you believe all that mess I'm just going
[2:09:31] on you just wait that little little
[2:09:33] two-year-old right there this is this
[2:09:37] let them grow up a little bit
[2:09:38] watched how many times they've had to
[2:09:40] eat their words many times much worse
[2:09:43] than the people they were criticizing
[2:09:45] you know it and as the Prophet says it
[2:09:47] ought not to be that way or so fast the
[2:09:51] judge or the only army that you know
[2:09:54] berries are are sick and wounded David
[2:10:00] immediately lashes out he shall restore
[2:10:03] the lamb fourfold David did you realize
[2:10:06] when you spoke those words you were
[2:10:08] gonna lose four little lambs four
[2:10:12] children are gonna die your children did
[2:10:17] you realize when you were speaking those
[2:10:18] words David you were pronouncing
[2:10:21] judgment on your own life Nathan said to
[2:10:26] David thou art the man thus saith the
[2:10:31] Lord God of Israel I had nobody the king
[2:10:32] over Israel deliver to the end the hand
[2:10:34] of this Liberty out of the hand of Saul
[2:10:35] gave thee thy masters house thy masters
[2:10:38] wife to that bosom gave him the house of
[2:10:40] Israel and Judah that had been too
[2:10:42] little I would have noticed this
[2:10:45] moreover given the such and such things
[2:10:47] I would have given you anything verse 9
[2:10:50] wherefore has thou despised the
[2:10:52] commandment of the Lord to do evil in
[2:10:53] the sight that was killed Uriah the
[2:10:54] Hittite with the sword of his taken his
[2:10:56] body ain't healing with the sword of the
[2:10:58] children of ammon now therefore the
[2:11:00] sword shall never depart from thine
[2:11:02] house because thou has despised me that
[2:11:05] was taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite
[2:11:07] to be thy wife thus saith the Lord
[2:11:09] behold I will raise up evil against the
[2:11:11] out of thy own house would take that
[2:11:12] wives before this notice here's this
[2:11:14] judgment he's going to pass upon him
[2:11:17] listen to what brother Branham says here
[2:11:18] prophet of God speaking when the message
[2:11:21] of grace love this message here in the
[2:11:23] message of grace brother Branham says
[2:11:25] when David did that evil thing
[2:11:28] his own judgment should have killed him
[2:11:31] when that profit came up there he
[2:11:34] thought it was hid this old profit old
[2:11:36] bald-headed fella stomped in Oh Nathan
[2:11:38] out of the wilderness sat down said
[2:11:40] David what's how's everything going
[2:11:41] said fine oh oh prophet of God live
[2:11:44] forever hallelujah oh he was just he
[2:11:46] thought everything was fine he thought
[2:11:48] he could hide it but you can't hide from
[2:11:50] God he knows what you're thinking right
[2:11:53] now he knows your thoughts for he's God
[2:11:57] that's the Holy Spirit that's in the
[2:11:59] building this morning knows your
[2:12:00] thoughts who you are where you came from
[2:12:02] what you've done listen to what brother
[2:12:06] Branham says here now you think brother
[2:12:09] Matt that's so horrible Oh
[2:12:11] could there be any recovery now as long
[2:12:16] notice as long as you're wanting and
[2:12:19] Hungary to get back to God there's a god
[2:12:22] somewhere calling to you or you wouldn't
[2:12:27] be hungry there's a place that you can
[2:12:30] cross where you can't get back but when
[2:12:32] that is you're down there again in the
[2:12:35] same shape you was it just goes to show
[2:12:37] you only fell from grace in other words
[2:12:42] if you couldn't get back to God you
[2:12:44] wouldn't want to get back to God
[2:12:47] listen to what he says backslidings not
[2:12:50] lost I want somebody to tell me where
[2:12:53] backslidings lost prove it in the Bible
[2:12:54] backsliders are not lost he's just out
[2:12:57] of fellowship David lost the joy of his
[2:13:01] salvation when he took Bathsheba Araiza
[2:13:03] but he never lost his salvation he
[2:13:06] didn't say restore to me the joy
[2:13:07] restored to me my salvation he says
[2:13:09] restore to me the joy of my salvation oh
[2:13:12] he says oh listen to what brother
[2:13:14] Branham says here oh there's so much of
[2:13:17] this legalism today touch not taste not
[2:13:19] you do things legally he says I didn't
[2:13:22] come to this church tonight legally I
[2:13:25] feel tired I feel nervous I'm upset I'm
[2:13:28] wondering about something that's before
[2:13:29] me my heart's burning even as such as to
[2:13:32] my heart's fluttering I got a cramp a
[2:13:34] pain right at this moment listening to
[2:13:36] brother Mannis begins to say even I feel
[2:13:38] I'm he was battling a physical
[2:13:41] ailment he says did my pain to shoot him
[2:13:43] up my back up here nervous I'm trembling
[2:13:45] he says oh he says I felt anything but
[2:13:49] to come to the house of God but why did
[2:13:51] I come because I love God live or die I
[2:13:56] must stand here it's not because I have
[2:14:00] to he wouldn't care about whether I did
[2:14:03] it or not I if I'd died I'd go to heaven
[2:14:06] anyhow but I come because I love him you
[2:14:10] serve God because you love him because
[2:14:16] you just got to do it because you love
[2:14:20] him enough David begins notice this here
[2:14:28] he begins to cry I want you to turn to
[2:14:31] Psalms 51 musicians could you come
[2:14:35] Psalms chapter 51 I want you to look at
[2:14:38] this here
[2:14:49] no doubt they begin to break what a
[2:14:52] reaction he has you notice he could have
[2:14:57] rose up and and just lashed out at
[2:15:01] Nathan how dare you how dare you expose
[2:15:04] me and you know but there was something
[2:15:07] inside of him there was even beyond all
[2:15:09] of the sin beyond all of the cover
[2:15:12] behind of all of the crust but by beyond
[2:15:15] all of the layers he had put over all of
[2:15:18] the religion all the covering and way
[2:15:21] down inside the core of that man was
[2:15:24] still along in a desire for Jesus to
[2:15:29] live for God and he begins to pray and I
[2:15:37] want you to notice this prayer here in
[2:15:40] Psalms chapter 51 that you can turn
[2:15:43] there brother Jeremy if you just pulled
[2:15:45] it up here Psalms chapter 51 I want you
[2:15:48] to notice the words that David begins to
[2:15:51] pray is Nathan confronts him says thou
[2:15:54] art the man you know no doubt
[2:16:00] David is broken he knows now that's all
[2:16:05] it's all out he's now judgments been
[2:16:09] passed upon him judgments gonna be
[2:16:13] passed upon his entire house do you have
[2:16:15] it brother Jeremy put it up there for me
[2:16:17] stomps 51 verse 1
[2:16:20] have mercy this is the words he begins
[2:16:23] to pray have mercy upon me O God
[2:16:27] according to thy loving-kindness
[2:16:29] according unto the multitude of thy
[2:16:34] tender mercies blot out my
[2:16:37] transgressions just keep going by the
[2:16:39] Jeremie with me wash me thoroughly from
[2:16:42] mine iniquity and cleanse me from my sin
[2:16:44] for I acknowledge my transgressions and
[2:16:47] my sin is ever before me against thee
[2:16:50] and the only have I sinned and done this
[2:16:52] evil in thy sight that now notice that
[2:16:55] thou mightest be justified when thou
[2:16:57] speakest and be clear when thou judgest
[2:17:01] behold I was shapen in iniquity and in
[2:17:05] sin did my mother conceive me behold
[2:17:08] this is what David the revelation David
[2:17:11] gets behold thou desirest truth in the
[2:17:16] inward parts and in the hidden parts
[2:17:20] thou shalt make me to know wisdom in
[2:17:28] other words it doesn't matter how
[2:17:29] polished or how we're find I am on the
[2:17:32] outside that's not what you're looking
[2:17:33] for God because I could be so polished
[2:17:36] on the outside and have everything right
[2:17:38] on the inside on the outside but my
[2:17:39] inside could be a mess but today Lord
[2:17:42] I'm raising my hands that I'm saying
[2:17:43] Lord I don't want truth just to be on
[2:17:46] the outside but how many could pray with
[2:17:48] David and say Lord let truth be on the
[2:17:51] inside let me know it from the inside
[2:17:54] let my outside be a working from my
[2:17:57] inward parts in the hidden parts that no
[2:18:00] one else sees make me to know wisdom
[2:18:02] verse 7 purge me with hyssop and I shall
[2:18:05] be clean wash me and I shall be whiter
[2:18:08] than snow make me to hear joy and
[2:18:11] gladness that the bones which thou has
[2:18:13] broken may rejoice hide thy face from my
[2:18:18] sins and blot out all mine iniquities
[2:18:22] create in me
[2:18:24] a clean heart oh when I read those words
[2:18:29] when I speak them when your eyes see
[2:18:32] them I know that there's something
[2:18:33] inside of you that just says yes Lord
[2:18:36] yes Lord created me a clean heart as
[2:18:40] david prayed and i'm praying here today
[2:18:42] created me you know david uses a very
[2:18:45] special word in verse 10 create it's the
[2:18:48] first word in that sentence because he
[2:18:51] knows that only one person is attributed
[2:18:54] to that word because there's only one
[2:18:57] person who can create and that's the
[2:18:59] creator and david is attributed and
[2:19:01] saying god i can't do this i've solved
[2:19:06] for the wrong things i've looked at the
[2:19:08] wrong things i've sought after the wrong
[2:19:09] things but i'm going to ask you to do
[2:19:11] something I can't do create in me a
[2:19:15] clean heart O God and renew a right
[2:19:18] spirit within me and then he prays cast
[2:19:27] me not away
[2:19:29] [Music]
[2:19:32] want you to bow your heads with me here
[2:19:33] this morning
[2:19:37] David just for a moment here before we
[2:19:40] have you stand to stay there every hand
[2:19:43] out no doubt when the words thou art the
[2:19:50] man come through David's ears his mind
[2:19:55] begins to race no doubt David Koepp
[2:20:00] remember and he goes back in his memory
[2:20:02] he asks himself how how could I get here
[2:20:07] his mind begins to go back and he could
[2:20:10] remember another king when he was a
[2:20:13] young man he could remember another king
[2:20:16] who was confronted by another prophet
[2:20:18] here he David being a king Nathan being
[2:20:21] a prophet but he Bree whines in his mind
[2:20:24] and he says I was a teenager and I was I
[2:20:28] was put in the courts of king named Saul
[2:20:32] and I watched and I learned and I
[2:20:36] watched that Saul and he had a prophet
[2:20:40] and his name wasn't Nathan his name was
[2:20:41] Samuel and David begins to reminisce and
[2:20:45] remember in his mind I remember just
[2:20:48] like now just like Nathan's coming and
[2:20:52] confronting me there was another King
[2:20:54] and there was another prophet who
[2:20:56] confronted him and David says but I
[2:20:59] watched time after time he'd confront
[2:21:02] Saul and old Saul would get emotional
[2:21:05] and Saul would begin to cry sob would
[2:21:07] raise a sense Allah Oh Oh God forgive me
[2:21:09] me and the people Lord forgive me but
[2:21:11] David says but but he never changed he
[2:21:14] repented over and over but he nothing
[2:21:16] ever changed
[2:21:17] he can't kept with the desires desire
[2:21:19] never changed but but he kept coming to
[2:21:21] the same place and David begins to race
[2:21:23] in his mind as he hears those words thou
[2:21:26] art the man and now here he is King now
[2:21:29] here's a prophet and now it's his
[2:21:32] opportunity
[2:21:33] David says I remember Saul as God gave
[2:21:38] mercy time and time and time and time
[2:21:40] and time again but with each dismissal
[2:21:46] there was a season of
[2:21:49] verbal repentance but his feet never
[2:21:52] turned and he continued continued ASPs
[2:21:58] and david says but there came a point it
[2:22:03] didn't just stay that way that cycle
[2:22:05] that remained there came a point when
[2:22:08] God
[2:22:10] repented that he had made Saul King and
[2:22:14] the Bible says that the Holy Spirit
[2:22:17] departed from Saul and David remembers
[2:22:21] this and David says I remember the Holy
[2:22:23] Spirit the presence of God the presence
[2:22:25] of the Lord the communion with the
[2:22:28] Spirit of God the hand of Mercy that was
[2:22:30] upon his life as a king and the
[2:22:31] anointing upon his life David begins to
[2:22:34] shudder in fear as he begin to realize
[2:22:37] that Holy Spirit that means so much to
[2:22:41] me departed from that man he gets to
[2:22:43] such a place he sees goes to a witch the
[2:22:46] Witch of Endor and and and and Saul by
[2:22:49] his own confession says the Spirit of
[2:22:51] God has departed for me and you know
[2:22:55] what that may have not scared any other
[2:22:57] king but to a man like David the
[2:23:02] presence of God meant everything David
[2:23:08] could say you may get your satisfaction
[2:23:10] and money maybe that satisfies you maybe
[2:23:13] you get your satisfaction and in the
[2:23:15] world and maybe maybe that appeases your
[2:23:17] appetite and entertainments maybe that
[2:23:18] appeases you and maybe that's your life
[2:23:20] maybe you're content with that david
[2:23:23] says but not me i can't relate to that
[2:23:25] because my the ingredients of my life
[2:23:27] are made up of the things of god they're
[2:23:30] made up of the presence of god they're
[2:23:32] made up of the word of god the presence
