[30:14] [Music]
[30:17] us a really nice service on Sunday
[30:22] I am
[30:23] so blessed
[30:26] and I think the the thing that topped it
[30:29] off for me
[30:31] seeing all the people here and and many
[30:34] that haven't been
[30:35] for a long time coming and joining us in
[30:39] many new faces that we've seen that
[30:42] haven't been introduced to what we know
[30:44] got introduced this Sunday and the
[30:47] Highlight for me was
[30:49] after the service
[30:52] I walked back and I was shaking people's
[30:54] hands and
[30:56] his brother Ed
[30:57] pointed over in the corner in the back
[31:00] far corner where you all are
[31:03] and there's a young man
[31:06] has head down he had hair that covered
[31:09] covered his his head his hair is about
[31:11] down to here
[31:13] his hands in his face
[31:16] is dressed in white and he had
[31:20] chains around his neck
[31:23] the Lord was dealing with him
[31:27] I walked over there
[31:28] [Music]
[31:29] everyone pretty much had left the
[31:31] congregation
[31:32] [Music]
[31:33] I said God bless you brother
[31:37] he said
[31:38] he says I don't know what to say
[31:41] he said what you were saying
[31:44] about a life being Resurrected
[31:48] he said I want that to be to my life
[31:51] he said
[31:53] what you said about
[31:55] us being the cause of everything that's
[31:58] happened in our lives and and how most
[32:01] of the things that we bring on ourselves
[32:03] he says he says brother that was me
[32:06] and he said
[32:07] he says I just
[32:10] he says I want to get back to who I was
[32:13] so we prayed and it turns out that for
[32:17] the Arne Peterson
[32:19] and he was the man was here and
[32:23] maybe doing something he shouldn't been
[32:25] doing and brother Arnie approached him
[32:29] and he said that man approached me and
[32:32] he said you know what he said you know
[32:33] what he did he said he was kind to me
[32:37] and he said
[32:39] something in me said you need to go to
[32:42] that church
[32:43] and he said here I am he says I don't
[32:45] even know why I'm here he says I've
[32:46] never been to this church he said I
[32:47] don't know anything about this church
[32:50] so we came and brother Arnie came and
[32:54] and we came up to the Altar and we all
[32:56] knelt down and prayed here for a while
[32:58] and brother Arnie stayed with him and
[33:00] prayed for I don't know how long after
[33:03] service
[33:05] but I believe something happened in the
[33:07] young man's life
[33:08] I look forward to seeing him again he
[33:10] had the same name as the homeless man
[33:13] that I've been witnessing to named Alex
[33:14] and they they're both their names are
[33:16] Alex
[33:16] [Music]
[33:18] I am thankful thankful that we do have a
[33:22] little Lighthouse here
[33:24] people can come in
[33:27] they'll feel free to come in and you're
[33:29] always welcome
[33:31] brother there in the back you're welcome
[33:32] to come anytime you want to my friend
[33:34] all the way in the back in the black
[33:36] raise your hand God bless you my brother
[33:39] you're welcome to come and you sister
[33:41] back here you're also welcome raise your
[33:43] hand if you could
[33:44] be good welcome my sister
[33:45] [Music]
[33:47] we want you to come
[33:49] we want you to Come As You Are
[33:51] all of us are sinners all of us have
[33:53] done things wrong but our lord Jesus was
[33:57] sent to this Earth for Sinners he
[34:02] himself said the sick he himself said
[34:05] those that are well don't need a
[34:07] physician
[34:08] it is those that are sick that need help
[34:12] and I have been sick so many times in my
[34:14] life and I thank God that he has always
[34:17] been there for me and he has never given
[34:19] up on me
[34:21] Stephanie and I went over the past few
[34:23] days we wanted to get get away and get
[34:25] some rest so we went up the White
[34:27] Mountains and stayed up there we visited
[34:30] the camp that we're going to be having
[34:32] in the middle of September really
[34:35] excited
[34:36] about it it's it's a beautiful place
[34:38] it's in it's way up in the pine trees
[34:40] there's elk and deer up there and and I
[34:45] believe that the Lord is going to bless
[34:47] us while we're up there it's a life for
[34:50] the congregation to start praying
[34:53] about the what we should have at the
[34:55] camp and how we should have the camp go
[34:59] we have a few prayer requests also
[35:03] please pray for sister Mercy's zamaran
[35:06] one of her legs is swelling
[35:09] sister Rachel Guerra writes please pray
[35:11] for my daughter
[35:14] Abby and the children they're sick
[35:16] you know she also says thank you for
[35:18] praying brother David we've been praying
[35:21] for you my brother brother David Murray
[35:23] pray that the Lord's had his hand on you
[35:25] or sorry to hear about your sister
[35:28] but sometimes we don't know the Lord's
[35:30] will
[35:31] we don't know why things happen but one
[35:34] thing that we do know that everything
[35:36] happens for a purpose
[35:38] and that God had a purpose in it we just
[35:40] pray our biggest prayer is we want to
[35:42] find that purpose
[35:44] also sister Amelia has a prayer request
[35:50] says here I'm asking for prayers for
[35:53] myself
[35:54] I've been suffering all week long with
[35:56] allergies or cold a lot of coughing and
[35:59] congestion I claim my healing in Jesus
[36:02] name
[36:03] amen I like that
[36:06] Stephanie and I on the way over here we
[36:08] stopped by this Spanish church that's on
[36:11] Miracle Mile and Oracle there
[36:14] and the pastor I asked the congregation
[36:16] also pray for that church they want to
[36:19] build a building and they've got a sweet
[36:22] little congregation the pastor's name is
[36:24] Luis
[36:25] so let's let's also pray for that group
[36:29] serving the lord
[36:30] doing their best
[36:32] to bring Sinners to the Lord Jesus to
[36:37] serve him the best that they know how
[36:39] amen can we stand as we pray Brother
[36:41] David fontenere come on up and and lead
[36:44] us in prayer
[36:44] [Music]
[36:48] we're going to hear
[36:50] in the sermon I believe
[36:52] I can guess that we're going to hear in
[36:54] our sermon tonight
[36:56] about a couple believers
[36:59] that healed the sick man at the gate
[37:01] called Beautiful in Acts chapter 3.
[37:04] let me tell you the god that healed that
[37:06] man is still alive today and he is still
[37:11] a Healer he's still a miracle working
[37:13] God
[37:14] let's bow our heads though David if you
[37:17] would come
[37:17] [Music]
[37:19] as Brother David is coming
[37:21] if you'd have a request upon your heart
[37:24] and ask that you raise your hand in the
[37:27] name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[37:28] [Music]

[37:35] to be able to gather like this in this
[37:37] this building Lord
[37:40] we can feel your presence moving up and
[37:43] down the aisles Lord we just ask that
[37:44] you would forgive us where we've fallen
[37:46] short so many times
[37:48] when we look around us Lord we'll
[37:51] stumble by the things that we see and
[37:55] unfortunately Lord when people look at
[37:57] my life I'm afraid that they'll they
[37:59] would stumble as well but when we all
[38:01] look up Lord and we
[38:03] Look to You Lord that's our that's our
[38:06] only hope is so help us Lord Jesus to
[38:10] keep our eyes on you and and
[38:13] May our Focus be the end of the the road

[38:43] lean on each other but you're the only
[38:46] one who really understands each one and

[45:32] and second when thou art converted
[45:37] strengthen thy brethren
[45:40] and we'll see him do exactly that in our
[45:42] lesson this evening please be seated
[45:46] even though Jesus warning was directed
[45:48] to Peter I doubt Satan gave up
[45:52] or that he doesn't want to sift every
[45:54] believer the same way that he wanted to
[45:56] sift Peter
[45:57] and Jesus prayer contains good advice
[46:01] don't let our faith fail
[46:03] and strengthen each other
[46:07] by this Jesus said will all men know
[46:11] that you're my disciples
[46:13] when thou art converted
[46:16] that's a strange word
[46:19] in Modern English it implies a change in
[46:22] nature or position or function a
[46:26] transformation if you will but Peter was
[46:28] certainly transformed not long after
[46:29] Jesus said these words in Luke 22.
[46:32] we'll learn another meaning of the word
[46:34] translated as converted as we proceed
[46:38] this evening
[46:39] brother Daniel shared with us the last
[46:41] time he spoke on this series from Acts 2
[46:43] that the day of Pentecost was the day
[46:46] that Peter was filled with the Holy
[46:47] Spirit
[46:48] he was converted
[46:50] and what happened
[46:52] the church was born
[46:57] Pentecost
[46:58] that's when he preached that sermon
[47:00] there's something I want to share with
[47:02] you about the feast days of the Lord
[47:04] commanded the descendants of Israel to
[47:06] observe bear with me that I think it
[47:09] helps bring context to the events and
[47:12] the first few chapters of Acts
[47:14] as you may be aware last Wednesday was
[47:17] Passover
[47:19] and we are now this evening at the
[47:21] conclusion of the Feast of unleavened
[47:23] bread which is a seven day observance
[47:25] immediately following Passover
[47:28] I'm going to go into just a little bit
[47:30] of detail about these feasts I was going
[47:32] to go into a lot of detail but
[47:34] as I mentioned it to Heather her eyes
[47:36] kind of glazed over
[47:38] so I took that as a signal I'd better be
[47:41] brief
[47:44] so in addition
[47:46] to the weekly Sabbath these are the
[47:48] feast days that are all listed in
[47:50] Leviticus chapter 23.
[47:52] there are seven of them the first three
[47:55] Passover unleavened bread and first
[47:57] fruits occur in this spring and notice
[47:59] I've listed the Hebrew month Nissan 14
[48:01] Nissan 15 to 20. their months don't
[48:04] overlap or align exactly with ours
[48:07] that's why sometimes Easter can vary
[48:09] from late March to late April even
[48:12] though it always falls in a certain time
[48:15] in the month of Nissan
[48:18] the next Festival is weeks would we call
[48:22] Pentecost it's in the late spring
[48:25] in the fall there are three more
[48:27] trumpets atonement or Yom Kippur and
[48:30] Tabernacles
[48:32] as you can see in this slide
[48:35] five of these occur on specified dates
[48:37] of the month
[48:38] which means they may fall on any day of
[48:41] the week
[48:42] think of Independence Day July 4th in
[48:44] our holidays it can fall on any day of
[48:46] the week
[48:48] some years people get unhappy if it's on
[48:50] a Sunday because they don't get Monday
[48:51] off of work right
[48:52] but two of the feasts I've marked them
[48:54] with question marks they don't fall on a
[48:57] specified date
[48:58] but rather on a specific day of the week
[49:03] like our Thanksgiving holiday which is
[49:05] always on the fourth Thursday of
[49:06] November regardless of the date
[49:11] which are those two Feasts
[49:14] first fruits
[49:15] where a Sheaf of grain is waived before
[49:18] the people
[49:20] this is the start of the spring barley
[49:22] Harvest and it's a unique celebration
[49:25] this is the only feast day
[49:28] where a Sheaf of grain is waved
[49:33] the first fruits occurs on the day
[49:36] following the Sabbath that occurs during
[49:39] the Feast of unleavened bread which
[49:41] starts the day after Passover everybody
[49:43] got that
[49:44] so skipping the math and the logic it
[49:47] may fall as early as the 16th of Nisan
[49:50] to as late as the 22nd of Nissan
[49:54] the date can vary
[49:56] but the day of the week does not
[49:59] it always falls on a Sunday
[50:03] always
[50:05] first fruits from our Christian
[50:07] Perspective we celebrate as Easter
[50:12] Paul tells us Jesus was the first fruits
[50:15] of the Resurrection First Corinthians 15
[50:17] he says but now is Christ risen from the
[50:20] dead as we just sang Jesus is Alive
[50:23] and become the first fruits
[50:26] of them that slept
[50:28] Jesus rose on the Feast of first fruits
[50:31] he was the wave chief
[50:33] on that day of days and that same day
[50:37] after he arose we're told many of the
[50:40] Dead appeared in Jerusalem Matthew 27
[50:42] tells us the graves were opened many
[50:45] bodies of the Saints which slept
[50:49] and came out of the grace after his
[50:51] resurrection
[50:53] and went into the holy city
[50:57] appeared unto many
[50:59] again
[51:00] Jesus was the first
[51:02] the first fruits
[51:04] and we worship on Sunday to honor that
[51:06] resurrection and renew the promise we
[51:08] have as a result
[51:10] the other Feast that has an unspecified
[51:13] date but always falls on the same day of
[51:15] the week as first fruits as weeks what
[51:18] we call Pentecost
[51:20] it's tied directly it's anchored to
[51:24] firstfruits
[51:26] 50 days later
[51:28] I find this Beyond interesting it was
[51:30] pre-planned in detail by the Lord that
[51:33] the only two feasts in the list of
[51:35] Feasts that are not specified by date
[51:37] but by the day of the week are the two
[51:39] that have the most meaning to us as
[51:41] Christians Easter and Pentecost and the
[51:45] specified day of the week is not the
[51:47] Sabbath as you'd expect but the first
[51:49] day of the week
[51:51] Sunday
[51:53] Jesus rose on first fruits what we call
[51:57] Easter Sunday the day the priests and
[51:59] the temple were waving the Sheaf the
[52:01] resurrected Jesus was on display
[52:06] bringing this back to the book of Acts
[52:08] now seven weeks and one day after that
[52:10] first year Easter Peter preached a
[52:12] sermon to those gathered outside the
[52:15] upper room that morning marking the
[52:17] Feast of Weeks Pentecost
[52:20] Sunday
[52:21] which by the way is the only other feast
[52:26] that includes waving
[52:29] and that's what happened on that first
[52:31] Pentecost
[52:33] in this case two loaves made of fine
[52:36] flower
[52:38] but Satan hadn't sifted the wheat Christ
[52:40] had
[52:42] and the bread of life was now on display
[52:45] through his disciples
[52:48] Luke reports to us at about three
[52:50] thousand Souls were added that very day
[52:52] to the ranks of Believers in Christ in
[52:54] direct response to Peter's anointed
[52:56] words
[52:58] tonight
[52:59] we explore a bit about what happened
[53:02] next
[53:03] there'll be a lot of reading this
[53:05] evening if I go too fast please signal
[53:08] me slow down bro I tend to get carried
[53:11] away at times likewise if I speak too
[53:14] softly signal me to speak up if I speak
[53:17] too loudly let me know that I'm hurting
[53:19] your ears
[53:21] this section of Acts is so applicable to
[53:24] us and our lives and our experiences
[53:26] right here in Tucson today
[53:29] so turn in your Bibles please to Acts
[53:33] chapter 3. we'll start at verse 1.
[53:38] we'll be reading the first 34 verses
[53:44] I'm expecting somebody to raise their
[53:45] hand and say wait a minute brother Lyle
[53:47] there are only 26 verses in Acts 3.
[53:51] I can count
[53:53] the first 31 verses of chapter 4 are
[53:56] part of the same Narrative of what
[53:58] happened over the two days that this
[54:00] part of the account covers
[54:01] chapters in the Bible are often not at
[54:04] logical breaks many times you lose a
[54:06] threat or the meaning if you stop
[54:07] reading at the end of a chapter I'm sure
[54:10] you've noticed that in your quiet times
[54:11] your devotions at home
[54:13] well we'll stop after the first eight
[54:15] verses of chapter four
[54:17] setting the stage for the next
[54:19] installment of Acts chapter 4 which I
[54:21] believe brother Daniel will be teaching
[54:22] from perhaps next Wednesday
[54:25] that's not a prophecy or a prediction
[54:27] that's just an opinion everyone have
[54:30] Acts 3 located
[54:31] okay here we go
[54:34] now Peter and John went up together into
[54:38] the temple at The Hour of Prayer
[54:40] being the ninth hour
[54:43] that's about three in the afternoon it's
[54:46] the time of the afternoon sacrifice
[54:48] it's the moment Jesus yielded up his
[54:51] Spirit on Good Friday
[54:54] we'll stop here for just a moment
[54:57] we know about the temple and its
[55:00] centrality to Jewish worship Peter and
[55:03] John were practitioners of Judaism were
[55:05] living in Jerusalem it made sense that
[55:07] they'd go to the temple and pray at the
[55:08] normal hour for such prayer Jesus never
[55:11] told his followers to stop being Jewish
[55:14] during the week leading up to his death
[55:17] he was in the temple every day
[55:20] but we need to ask ourselves
[55:22] we know about this Peter and John
[55:25] they're Central characters in our
[55:27] chapter this evening what are their
[55:29] backgrounds their Natures their
[55:31] temperaments were they super Saints
[55:35] or
[55:36] were they just like us
[55:39] Jesus had a number of followers that at
[55:41] one point early in his ministry he
[55:43] whittled the number of men down of his
[55:45] disciples his students
[55:48] to 12 men and there was also an unknown
[55:51] number of women after all we're told in
[55:53] Luke 8 that many women of some means
[55:55] provided Financial Resources for his
[55:57] team and ministered to them three of
[56:00] them were named Mary Magdalene Joanna
[56:02] Susanna
[56:04] well regarding the 12
[56:06] the gospels record the calling of six
[56:09] the brothers Peter and Andrew the
[56:12] brothers James and John and the not
[56:14] Brothers Philip and Matthew
[56:17] we don't know when or how or in what
[56:20] order he called the others
[56:22] here's the only disciple
[56:24] if it were told was married
[56:27] we also know that he along with his
[56:30] brother Andrew and another pair of
[56:31] brothers James and John were fishermen
[56:33] on the lake we call the Sea of Galilee
[56:36] they weren't Scholars of the Tanakh or
[56:39] anything like that Peter was a man of
[56:42] faith
[56:44] who trusted Jesus remember Jesus prayed
[56:47] that thy faith fail not recall when he
[56:49] saw Jesus walking on the water in the
[56:51] dark of night during a storm
[56:54] he asked to walk with Jesus
[56:57] he got out of the boat and he did so for
[56:59] a moment
[57:01] when his faith faltered he cried out and
[57:04] Jesus reached out
[57:07] pulled him up they entered the boat
[57:09] together the storm ceased all the
[57:12] disciples in the boat declared that
[57:14] Jesus was the son of God
[57:16] that's related in Matthew 14. two
[57:19] chapters later and a little while later
[57:21] in Matthew 16 they're walking along the
[57:24] road and Jesus asked the disciples who
[57:26] they thought he was
[57:27] Peter replied Thou Art the Christ
[57:31] that's a Greek word it's the anointed
[57:33] you're the Messiah
[57:34] son of the Living God
[57:38] and what was Jesus reply blessed art
[57:41] thou Simon barjona gods revealed this to
[57:44] you I'm going to call you Peter a rock
[57:48] blessed
[57:50] blessed art thou Simon but a few days
[57:52] later in just a few verses later Jesus
[57:55] reveals what he's going to go through at
[57:57] Jerusalem
[57:58] and what does Peter do thou art the
[58:01] Christ the son of the Living God he
[58:02] takes Jesus aside and says no don't talk
[58:05] like that that's not going to happen no
[58:09] he's he's
[58:11] you can keep scolding
[58:13] Christ
[58:15] and what does Jesus say to the one that
[58:17] he had said just a few verses early was
[58:19] blessed get thee behind me Satan Thou
[58:23] Art an offense to me
[58:26] Peter says he will stick by Jesus no
[58:28] matter what at the Last Supper and some
[58:31] tens of minutes later he runs away
[58:34] along with all the others who'd said the
[58:36] same thing and goes on Peter does to
[58:38] denounce Jesus claiming he didn't even
[58:41] know him denouncing him with a curse
[58:44] and this was after trying to defend him
[58:47] from arrest by taking a sword and
[58:49] taking the ear off of one of the people
[58:51] that was out there to arrest Jesus
[58:54] Peter was volatile
[58:56] he was loyal but at times
[58:58] not so dependable
[59:01] sounds a bit like brother Lyle
[59:05] sounds like many of us I suspect well so
[59:08] much for Peter what about John the other
[59:10] character in this narrative we think of
[59:12] him as the disciple of love he calls
[59:14] himself the disciple whom Jesus loved in
[59:17] his own Gospel account
[59:19] but he was pretty political
[59:21] he sought position
[59:23] he sought influence
[59:25] and he was pretty judgmental
[59:28] recall it the Last Supper Peter asked
[59:30] John to ask Jesus to identify the
[59:32] betrayer
[59:33] right
[59:34] John 13 but a few days before that
[59:37] John and his brother James along with
[59:39] her mother privately tried to get Jesus
[59:42] to promise that these two brothers would
[59:44] sit next to Jesus one on the right one
[59:46] on the left when he sat on the throne of
[59:47] his kingdom the power seats the
[59:49] positions of influence
[59:51] Matthew 20 mark 10.
[59:55] when they found others casting out
[59:56] devils in Jesus name not trying to they
[1:00:00] were accomplishing it John reported to
[1:00:02] Jesus that he and the others forbade
[1:00:04] them since they weren't part of their
[1:00:06] group they followed not us they'd go to
[1:00:09] a different Church we're right they're
[1:00:11] wrong
[1:00:12] Jesus was pretty unhappy with this
[1:00:14] report and basically told them to get
[1:00:16] over it draw their circle of Fellowship
[1:00:18] a little larger he that's not against us
[1:00:21] is for us
[1:00:23] Mark 9 Luke 9.
[1:00:26] 9 how often do we put God in a box
[1:00:28] restrict him to only working within what
[1:00:31] we call the message or how we interpret
[1:00:34] it
[1:00:35] later when a Samaritan Village rejected
[1:00:38] Jesus and the disciples John and his
[1:00:40] brother James wanted to call down fire
[1:00:42] from heaven and consume them
[1:00:44] Jesus told them you don't know what
[1:00:46] Spirit you're of
[1:00:48] Luke 9.
[1:00:50] like Peter
[1:00:52] John was an imperfect human
[1:00:54] not a super saint
[1:00:57] yet in spite of these shortcomings
[1:00:59] Peter and John were both part of what we
[1:01:02] might think of as the inner circle of
[1:01:03] disciples
[1:01:05] Peter James and John were the only ones
[1:01:08] Jesus allowed to accompany him into the
[1:01:10] home of Jairus to raise his daughter
[1:01:12] from death
[1:01:14] Mark 5 and Luke 8. at the
[1:01:17] Transfiguration experience only Peter
[1:01:19] James and John were allowed to accompany
[1:01:21] Jesus
[1:01:23] mark 9. Matthew 17.
[1:01:26] after Jesus death all the disciples went
[1:01:29] into hiding
[1:01:30] including John they were afraid can you
[1:01:33] see yourself and any of these attributes
[1:01:35] of Peter or John
[1:01:37] or any of the other followers
[1:01:40] with that brief background We Now find
[1:01:43] Acts chapter 3 opening with Peter and
[1:01:45] John going to the temple to pray
[1:01:47] we've learned that 50 days after Jesus
[1:01:49] resurrection as the wave chief on Easter
[1:01:52] on the day of Pentecost they were filled
[1:01:53] with the Holy Spirit
[1:01:55] had they changed
[1:01:57] Jesus said the purpose of the infilling
[1:02:00] of the Holy Spirit the power that they
[1:02:03] would have was so his followers would
[1:02:05] have power to be his Witnesses
[1:02:08] spreading the good news without fear
[1:02:12] and on that Pentecost they became the
[1:02:15] wave loaves
[1:02:17] with that background in context the
[1:02:20] stage is set for our lesson tonight Acts
[1:02:22] 3 starting again at verse 1. now Peter
[1:02:25] and John went up together into the
[1:02:26] temple at The Hour of Prayer being the
[1:02:28] ninth hour
[1:02:29] and a certain man we are never told his
[1:02:32] name
[1:02:33] lame from his mother's womb
[1:02:36] this was a birth defect
[1:02:38] it wasn't a disease it wasn't the result
[1:02:40] of an injury this man had never walked
[1:02:44] he was carried well that means that this
[1:02:47] lameness was in both legs if it was one
[1:02:50] leg that was Lane he could have used a
[1:02:51] cane or a crutch and gotten around but
[1:02:54] he was carried and who carried him
[1:02:57] we don't know family friends did they do
[1:03:00] it begrudgingly or cheerfully out of
[1:03:04] love as an act of giving to the Lord a
[1:03:06] good deed with the Jewish people call
[1:03:08] them mitzvah
[1:03:09] we don't know but he was laid daily
[1:03:12] six days a week a year after year
[1:03:17] at the Gate of the temple not the Gate
[1:03:19] of the city but of the temple inside the
[1:03:22] city it's on Mount Moriah so not
[1:03:23] wherever they lived they had to go
[1:03:25] uphill they had to carry this guy up
[1:03:28] hill six days a week
[1:03:30] after week month after month year after
[1:03:34] year
[1:03:35] decade after decade
[1:03:37] it was the gate called Beautiful to ask
[1:03:40] alms to beg
[1:03:42] Gifts of money a Mitzvah ask arms of
[1:03:46] them that entered into the temple
[1:03:48] now the people going into the temple you
[1:03:50] assume are religious people they're
[1:03:52] observant so they're traditionally
[1:03:54] compelled to do good deeds and maybe
[1:03:56] they're a good deed that day
[1:03:58] is going to be to help this guy out
[1:04:01] well we don't know where the gate called
[1:04:04] Beautiful is or was because the only
[1:04:08] reference to a gate called Beautiful is
[1:04:10] in the New Testament it's not in any of
[1:04:13] the histories or writings of Josephus
[1:04:14] Etc so we don't know but these images
[1:04:17] are of something called the the double
[1:04:19] gate
[1:04:20] it's here and and here this is modern
[1:04:24] times of course
[1:04:26] this may have been the gate called
[1:04:28] Beautiful
[1:04:29] no one knows for sure but archaeological
[1:04:32] excavation through this double gate
[1:04:34] enters a passage with ornate domes and
[1:04:36] so forth that led up to the temple area
[1:04:39] as you can see the place where it would
[1:04:41] have exited is now occupied by the
[1:04:43] el-oxo mosque was in the news this last
[1:04:47] week this passage certainly was part of
[1:04:50] a beautiful gate if not the beautiful
[1:04:53] gate
[1:04:56] so this guy was laying there by the gate
[1:04:58] and and the lame man seeing Peter and
[1:05:01] John about to go into the temple asking
[1:05:03] alms
[1:05:04] hey buddy can you spare me a dime
[1:05:07] he asked a gift of money of everyone
[1:05:09] that passed by nothing out of the
[1:05:11] ordinary
[1:05:13] and Peter
[1:05:15] being shown by the holy spirit that this
[1:05:18] man had the faith to be healed
[1:05:20] fastening his eyes upon him with John
[1:05:23] with John how can two walk together
[1:05:26] unless they be agreed said look on us
[1:05:31] don't look down don't cast your eyes
[1:05:33] aside Don't Look Away you're about to
[1:05:36] receive a lot more than you anticipate
[1:05:38] from a couple of poor men like us
[1:05:40] and the lame man
[1:05:43] gave heed he listened he responded to
[1:05:46] them do Peter and John
[1:05:49] why
[1:05:50] expecting to receive something of them
[1:05:52] expecting to receive money he wasn't
[1:05:54] looking for healing
[1:05:56] then after Peter and John had the man's
[1:06:00] complete and focused attention
[1:06:03] Peter said
[1:06:05] Silver and Gold Have I None I imagined
[1:06:07] his eyes kind of dropped at that point
[1:06:09] but such as I have
[1:06:14] was he possessive or selfish or
[1:06:18] protective of it
[1:06:19] was he willing to give it away
[1:06:22] such as I have I give to you
[1:06:26] in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth
[1:06:29] rise up
[1:06:31] it's amazing and walk
[1:06:35] impossible this man had never watched he
[1:06:38] he did he have good enough balance to do
[1:06:41] that we don't know
[1:06:43] I'd like to share a little testimony
[1:06:46] with you about a time why I think this
[1:06:49] is such a miracle there was a time a few
[1:06:51] years ago where I had a uh an incident
[1:06:55] and uh I wound up tearing uh something
[1:06:58] in my leg so my from my hip to my toe
[1:07:01] turned black it was just one gigantic
[1:07:03] bruise and I wound up in the hospital
[1:07:06] and I wound up with you know what they
[1:07:08] call a shotgun pulmonary embolism
[1:07:10] basically my chest was moving but I
[1:07:13] wasn't really able to breathe
[1:07:15] um
[1:07:16] anyway
[1:07:18] what I'm getting to was after we went
[1:07:21] through some medical procedures and so
[1:07:22] forth that uh I I wound up being con I
[1:07:27] had to stay in bed for a while for a few
[1:07:29] weeks actually
[1:07:30] and I could get up you know and hop or
[1:07:33] hobble or something but I couldn't put
[1:07:34] any weight on that leg well if I put my
[1:07:37] hands around my thigh you can see
[1:07:39] there's a big gap between my thumbs well
[1:07:41] at that point my thumbs overlapped
[1:07:43] pretty pretty completely so I had lost a
[1:07:46] huge amount of muscle mass in my leg
[1:07:49] when it was okay for me to get up and
[1:07:52] walk that was great news except I
[1:07:54] couldn't
[1:07:55] because I had no strength in my leg
[1:07:58] so I had been lame in one leg for just a
[1:08:01] matter of a few weeks
[1:08:03] and I couldn't walk I used a cane and I
[1:08:06] managed to hobble around but but that's
[1:08:09] just a few weeks it turns out that this
[1:08:12] guy was 40 years old so for 40 years
[1:08:15] he'd been carried for 40 years he'd been
[1:08:18] unable to walk if in a few weeks
[1:08:21] I couldn't walk what about this guy
[1:08:24] after all this time
[1:08:26] well Peter No Doubt when he was saying
[1:08:30] this to the man he remembered Jesus
[1:08:32] words from Matthew 5 The Sermon on the
[1:08:34] Mount give to him that asketh thee and
[1:08:37] from him that would borrow thee turn not
[1:08:39] thou away
[1:08:41] such as I have
[1:08:43] I give to you and Peter
[1:08:45] took the lame man by the right hand
[1:08:49] oh now this guy's got to make a decision
[1:08:53] do I accept this offered hand attempt to
[1:08:56] stand risk damage pain and injury
[1:09:00] or do I refuse and just shake my money
[1:09:03] cup Adam
[1:09:05] he made his decision
[1:09:07] and lifted him up
[1:09:09] and immediately the lame man's feet and
[1:09:13] ankle bones
[1:09:15] received strength
[1:09:18] feet is plural so both legs are lame
[1:09:23] notice a reference to his feet and ankle
[1:09:25] bones not withered limbs this may have
[1:09:28] been severely deformed feet and ankles
[1:09:31] like clubbed feet it's a birth defect we
[1:09:34] know that I'm going to just show you an
[1:09:36] image of of club feet that's a little
[1:09:38] disturbing so if you've got people with
[1:09:41] you that shouldn't see something
[1:09:42] disturbing I'll just have it up there
[1:09:44] for a moment
[1:09:45] but you can't walk
[1:09:48] that you just can't do it
[1:09:50] okay these are examples of club foot and
[1:09:53] this is likely I think what the lame man
[1:09:55] had at the temple
[1:09:57] I've taken the picture away
[1:10:00] many times you might recall brother
[1:10:03] green told us the first time he saw a
[1:10:05] brother Branham in Texas in 1950
[1:10:09] there was a small child with clubbed
[1:10:12] feet
[1:10:13] brother Branham asked everyone to Bow
[1:10:15] their heads and he took this little
[1:10:17] toddler this little
[1:10:19] very young child
[1:10:22] and he prayed for the little boy
[1:10:26] and then he dropped him to the floor
[1:10:29] he dropped him to the floor brother
[1:10:30] green says there was a collective gasp
[1:10:32] from the audience
[1:10:34] well they didn't have their head spout
[1:10:37] and that included brother Greene
[1:10:39] at that time he was a 16 year old youth
[1:10:41] Brother game reports he saw the club
[1:10:43] feed on the toddler and witnessed the
[1:10:46] miraculous healing by the time the child
[1:10:48] reached the floor
[1:10:49] feet were normal and he was standing
[1:10:54] many times in the gospel accounts Jesus
[1:10:57] Took the petitioner by the hand after
[1:10:58] proclaiming healing
[1:11:00] Peter's mother-in-law Jairus daughter
[1:11:03] and so forth
[1:11:05] Peter's doing what he saw Jesus do
[1:11:10] and Peter took the lame man by the right
[1:11:14] hand and lifted him up and immediately
[1:11:17] the lame man speed and ankle bones
[1:11:20] received strength
[1:11:23] and heed the stricken man leaping up
[1:11:26] leaping up this is the only time in the
[1:11:30] New Testament where that phrase is used
[1:11:33] leaping up this is unique
[1:11:37] to it and walked
[1:11:39] and entered with them
[1:11:43] Peter helping stabilize him perhaps on
[1:11:46] one side John on the other we can infer
[1:11:48] that from from what follows into the
[1:11:51] temple walking and leaping
[1:11:54] and praising God
[1:11:57] and all the people in the temple area at
[1:12:00] that time saw him walking
[1:12:03] and praising God
[1:12:07] and they the people in the temple area
[1:12:10] knew that this man leaping and walking
[1:12:13] and praising God was he which sat for
[1:12:15] arms at the beautiful gate of the Temple
[1:12:18] and they were filled with wonder and
[1:12:21] amazement
[1:12:22] at that which had happened unto him
[1:12:26] now I realized as I read some of those
[1:12:28] verses that I said some things that
[1:12:29] weren't written I I said Peter knowing
[1:12:31] by the holy spirit that the man had
[1:12:33] faith I said the man had to make a
[1:12:36] decision to be lifted up
[1:12:38] those are statements brother Branham
[1:12:40] made about these particular verses and
[1:12:42] Conference a time of decision acts of
[1:12:45] the Holy Spirit and other messages we
[1:12:46] have
[1:12:49] and as the no longer lame man
[1:12:53] which was healed help Peter and John he
[1:12:55] helped them perhaps he needed a little
[1:12:58] support he'd never walked before he had
[1:13:00] strength but did he have balance anybody
[1:13:02] here ever ride a bicycle
[1:13:04] when you learn how to ride a bicycle did
[1:13:06] anybody ever fall over maybe of the day
[1:13:09] that the training wheels came off and
[1:13:11] then you had to turn and you discovered
[1:13:13] that you lean you don't do that
[1:13:16] well this guy was 40 years old and he'd
[1:13:19] never walked what was his balance like
[1:13:21] don't know
[1:13:27] all the people Shrugged and got back to
[1:13:30] praying reciting the Amada
[1:13:33] no
[1:13:34] no they soldered over in mild curiosity
[1:13:38] no they scolded the man for disturbing
[1:13:41] their worship and carrying on
[1:13:45] those who saw this evidence of a miracle
[1:13:47] ran together unto them
[1:13:49] them
[1:13:50] demand Peter John
[1:13:53] and the porch that is called Solomon's
[1:13:56] it's within the the outer Court as near
[1:13:59] as I've been able to determine
[1:14:01] just after they had passed the beautiful
[1:14:03] gate and climbed the steps up to the
[1:14:06] temple Plaza
[1:14:08] greatly wondering
[1:14:10] what is this
[1:14:12] and this porch or Portico was at a
[1:14:14] higher elevation in the gate
[1:14:17] so they're no longer lame man had to
[1:14:19] climb these steps with Peter and John
[1:14:23] here again you can see this was the the
[1:14:25] double gate that saw the picture of
[1:14:27] earlier this is a model that's at the
[1:14:29] Israel Museum of what people somebody
[1:14:31] some artists thinks that Jerusalem
[1:14:33] looked like at the time of the second
[1:14:35] temple
[1:14:37] gates are down here this Plaza and then
[1:14:40] you're gonna have to go upstairs somehow
[1:14:42] to get up to this level
[1:14:45] here you can see a slightly different
[1:14:47] those steps were down over here and
[1:14:50] somewhere around here is what's called
[1:14:53] Solomon's porch
[1:14:56] so he was walking he was leaping he was
[1:14:59] climbing
[1:15:02] and when Peter saw it when Peter saw the
[1:15:04] crowd rushing towards his small group
[1:15:07] he answered
[1:15:09] he responded by addressing the people
[1:15:12] there was a large group of people so we
[1:15:15] had to raise his voice a bit ye men of
[1:15:17] Israel
[1:15:18] so not speaking to the Gentiles not
[1:15:22] speaking to the women's Court not
[1:15:24] addressing them as judeans or other
[1:15:26] provincial residents but as descendants
[1:15:29] of Jacob ye men of Israel why Marvel ye
[1:15:32] at this
[1:15:33] why look he's so earnestly on us as
[1:15:35] though by our own power or Holiness we
[1:15:38] made this man to walk
[1:15:40] Jewish tradition is that you keep the
[1:15:43] rules you worship sacrifices and and
[1:15:46] some may achieve a higher level of
[1:15:49] spirituality
[1:15:50] but sodak as we would say in Hebrew and
[1:15:54] perhaps you could work miracles or
[1:15:56] render healings or cast out demons it
[1:15:59] had to do with your level of spiritual
[1:16:02] achievement
[1:16:03] so Peter first explains this isn't the
[1:16:05] case
[1:16:06] even though it's the expectation of the
[1:16:09] crowd they're training their tradition
[1:16:11] established over many centuries
[1:16:13] Peter continues
[1:16:15] the god of Abraham and of Isaac and of
[1:16:18] Jacob in other words the god of our
[1:16:21] forefathers hath glorified his son Jesus
[1:16:27] this is already a radical Concept in
[1:16:29] Judaism
[1:16:30] it's common among those that worship the
[1:16:34] emperor Caesar or earlier times in
[1:16:36] worship Pharaoh is a God
[1:16:38] calling a human being God's son is
[1:16:41] radical in Judaism and that God The God
[1:16:45] Who said I will not share my glory with
[1:16:47] another Peter says he has glorified
[1:16:52] in other words
[1:16:54] this Jesus
[1:16:55] is God in flesh
[1:16:58] that's what he's telling the crowd
[1:17:01] glorified his son Jesus whom ye
[1:17:03] delivered up
[1:17:05] ye remember is a plural it's a
[1:17:08] collective you delivered up and denied
[1:17:10] him
[1:17:11] I think that was hard for Peter to say
[1:17:13] because just 50 days plus some unknown
[1:17:17] amount of time before that he denied the
[1:17:19] Lord many times the very night before
[1:17:22] the crucifixion
[1:17:24] but Peter was now converted
[1:17:27] as Jesus had prayed
[1:17:29] and we read on our opening verses
[1:17:31] delivered up and denied him in the
[1:17:33] presence of pilate when pilate was
[1:17:35] determined to let him go
[1:17:38] all four gospel accounts attest to this
[1:17:41] but he collectively and
[1:17:44] doing so had to also be individually you
[1:17:47] denied the Holy One and the just and
[1:17:50] desired a murderer to be granted unto
[1:17:52] you
[1:17:54] Peter's reminding them of that awful day
[1:17:57] of their recent past and the complicity
[1:18:01] of the crowd and condemning Jesus to
[1:18:03] crucifixion and releasing Barabbas you
[1:18:06] know that some of these people in this
[1:18:08] large crowd had to have been part of
[1:18:10] that crowd too
[1:18:11] and killed the Prince of Life
[1:18:15] and now comes the the Zinger
[1:18:18] whom God hath raised from the dead
[1:18:23] it's not just something we're repeating
[1:18:25] because regard s Resurrection whereof we
[1:18:29] John and myself are witnesses
[1:18:33] are witnesses that was that was a pretty
[1:18:36] severe punishment for bearing false
[1:18:37] witness for lying about things in those
[1:18:39] days
[1:18:41] but he's standing up and saying we Are
[1:18:44] Witnesses of this and his name
[1:18:47] Jesus through faith in his name
[1:18:51] not some magic incantation like another
[1:18:54] Simon thought when he attempted to buy
[1:18:56] the power to use the Holy Spirit to cast
[1:18:58] out Devils as we'll read in a later
[1:19:00] chapter of Acts
[1:19:02] but through faith in his name hath made
[1:19:05] this man strong whom ye see you know
[1:19:09] this man's a new stranger isn't somebody
[1:19:12] that we brought in as part of our
[1:19:14] traveling troop to to you know cheat you
[1:19:17] beat you out of some money or something
[1:19:19] right
[1:19:20] but he's been at this gate he's been
[1:19:23] brought here carried here for decades
[1:19:27] no doubt Jesus saw him lying there too
[1:19:30] the time for his healing as a witness of
[1:19:33] the Resurrection had not yet come
[1:19:36] yea the faith which is by him
[1:19:40] by who
[1:19:41] Jesus hath given him
[1:19:45] who this formerly lame man this perfect
[1:19:48] soundness in the presence of you all
[1:19:53] this isn't done in a corner they weren't
[1:19:54] the only ones on the steps at the gate
[1:19:56] called Beautiful it was The Hour of
[1:19:58] Prayer there was a crowd moving up at
[1:20:00] the same time it wasn't just these guys
[1:20:02] in the corner now they're going up and
[1:20:03] saying hey guess what
[1:20:05] this was not done in a corner
[1:20:08] and for us tonight notice
[1:20:11] this guy wasn't hanging around the pool
[1:20:13] of Bethesda waiting for the waters to be
[1:20:15] agitated
[1:20:16] he wasn't looking for healing he wasn't
[1:20:19] expecting healing
[1:20:21] but Peter had extended his faith to the
[1:20:23] man
[1:20:24] when you are converted strengthen your
[1:20:28] brethren
[1:20:30] as we read in our opening scripture that
[1:20:32] act operated the gift of healing in
[1:20:35] recent times
[1:20:38] a couple of weeks ago a few weeks ago
[1:20:39] Heather and I were were visiting our
[1:20:41] brother Nathaniel Dougal at in prison
[1:20:44] near El Paso Texas
[1:20:47] he has seen God do Miracles and healings
[1:20:50] of men who claim to not have faith
[1:20:52] because Nathanael told them he had faith
[1:20:55] if they would allow him to pray for them
[1:20:58] same principle
[1:21:00] book of Acts
[1:21:01] happening
[1:21:03] in a prison
[1:21:05] outside of El Paso
[1:21:07] and now brethren
[1:21:09] Peter's identifying himself with them
[1:21:12] he's not pushing them out not enemies
[1:21:15] but brothers and now Brethren I walk
[1:21:18] that through ignorance
[1:21:19] what is one of those it's not like how
[1:21:22] many watts of Illumination in a light
[1:21:24] bulb this is this is I realize I know
[1:21:27] this is King James English right that
[1:21:30] through ignorance she did it as did also
[1:21:33] your rulers
[1:21:35] Peter's extending grace to the crowd
[1:21:38] Peter's experienced Grace
[1:21:41] he's extending grace to the crowd even
[1:21:43] to the high priests and others
[1:21:45] responsible for the execution of Jesus
[1:21:49] Jesus after all said father forgive them
[1:21:52] they don't know what they're doing
[1:21:56] Peter goes on but those things
[1:21:59] the rejection
[1:22:01] horrible method of death of Jesus which
[1:22:04] God beforehand showed by the mouth of
[1:22:06] All His prophets
[1:22:08] first after verse after verse in the Old
[1:22:10] Testament talks in this Genesis 3 15.
[1:22:13] Isaiah 15 6 all of Isaiah chapter 53
[1:22:16] Zechariah 12 10 13 7 Daniel
[1:22:20] Psalms 22 69 uh
[1:22:25] he says that all His prophets that
[1:22:28] Christ the Messiah the anointed one
[1:22:31] should suffer
[1:22:34] Jesus hath fulfilled
[1:22:37] okay Peter says so much for background
[1:22:41] seeing this man here and hearing what I
[1:22:44] just said
[1:22:45] you should be feeling unimaginable guilt
[1:22:51] so here's what you need to do
[1:22:53] he's not going to leave them
[1:22:55] hanging
[1:22:57] he says repent ye therefore what is
[1:23:00] repent
[1:23:01] it's an attitude
[1:23:03] sorrow
[1:23:04] and be converted
[1:23:07] that your sins may be blotted out
[1:23:10] this is an action
[1:23:12] converted the word means to turn around
[1:23:15] to turn back to go again
[1:23:19] it's the meaning of the Greek word
[1:23:20] translated convert that I alluded to
[1:23:22] earlier this evening
[1:23:24] that your sins may be blotted out
[1:23:26] smeared over removed obliterated
[1:23:28] Isaiah 44 22 for example says I have
[1:23:32] blotted out as a thick Cloud thy
[1:23:34] transgressions and as a cloud thy sins
[1:23:37] return unto me be converted for I have
[1:23:41] redeemed thee
[1:23:44] may be blotted out when the times of
[1:23:46] refreshing
[1:23:47] recovery Revival shall come from the
[1:23:51] presence of the Lord
[1:23:53] and he the Lord as the father shall send
[1:23:57] Jesus Christ which before was preached
[1:24:00] unto you on the day of Pentecost
[1:24:02] probably every day since then
[1:24:05] whom the Heaven Must receive
[1:24:08] until the times of restitution of all
[1:24:12] things
[1:24:13] in Divine Healing 1954 brother Branham
[1:24:17] says this means new Heavens new Earth
[1:24:18] new beginning with no ending
[1:24:21] which God hath spoken by the mouth of
[1:24:24] all his holy Prophets
[1:24:26] since the world began
[1:24:28] it gives a couple of examples
[1:24:30] Moses truly said unto the fathers a
[1:24:33] prophet shall the Lord your God raise up
[1:24:35] unto you of your brethren like unto me
[1:24:37] him shall ye here in all things
[1:24:40] whatsoever he shall say unto you
[1:24:43] that's Deuteronomy 18 15.
[1:24:47] and it shall come to pass
[1:24:49] that every soul which will not hear that
[1:24:52] Prophet shall be destroyed from among
[1:24:55] the people
[1:24:56] that's Hosea 9 17. my God will cast them
[1:24:59] away because they did not hearken unto
[1:25:01] him and they shall be Wanderers among
[1:25:03] the Nations
[1:25:05] yea and all the prophets from Samuel and
[1:25:07] those that follow after
[1:25:09] as many as have spoken have likewise
[1:25:13] foretold of these days
[1:25:17] he says you're the children of the
[1:25:20] prophets the The Descendants the
[1:25:21] relatives
[1:25:23] and of the Covenant
[1:25:26] what what Covenant which Covenant
[1:25:28] the Covenant which God made with our
[1:25:31] fathers saying unto Abraham
[1:25:34] and in thy seed shall all the kindreds
[1:25:37] of the earth be blessed
[1:25:39] that's Genesis 22 18 and I see to all
[1:25:42] the nations of the earth be blessed
[1:25:44] because
[1:25:45] thou Hast obeyed my voice
[1:25:48] that was spoken to Abraham right after
[1:25:51] God rescued Isaac from being sacrificed
[1:25:54] on Mount Moriah the very place of the
[1:25:57] temple where Peter is making this
[1:25:59] declaration
[1:26:00] unto you first
[1:26:03] God having raised up his son Jesus sent
[1:26:06] him to bless you and turning away every
[1:26:08] one of you from his iniquities
[1:26:11] Peter is now preaching his heart to the
[1:26:14] people
[1:26:14] the disciples were told to spread the
[1:26:16] good news beginning at Jerusalem
[1:26:19] thus Peter says unto you first
[1:26:22] he's in the middle of his sermon
[1:26:24] maybe he and John are just getting
[1:26:26] warmed up
[1:26:29] and as they Peter and John spake unto
[1:26:33] the people
[1:26:34] the priests and the captain of the
[1:26:37] temple and the Sadducees Came Upon them
[1:26:41] not by chance
[1:26:43] this was a deliberate action of the
[1:26:45] authorities they heard something going
[1:26:48] on and they went to check it out
[1:26:50] here's why they came being grieved
[1:26:54] for a couple of reasons first that they
[1:26:57] Peter and John taught the people who are
[1:26:59] these guys what gives them the authority
[1:27:02] to do this they're not our guys
[1:27:05] and second preached through Jesus the
[1:27:09] resurrection
[1:27:10] from the dead
[1:27:12] now this Doctrine
[1:27:14] Resurrection from the dead or even just
[1:27:17] the concept of an afterlife
[1:27:20] the Sadducees denied
[1:27:22] this was heresy to them
[1:27:25] and recall the temple was run by which
[1:27:27] group
[1:27:29] the Sadducees
[1:27:31] not the Pharisees
[1:27:33] not the essenes the Sadducees have made
[1:27:36] a path with the Maccabees after the
[1:27:37] revolt against the seleucid rule or
[1:27:39] Antiochus the fourth epiphanies back
[1:27:41] around 160 BC nearly two centuries
[1:27:44] earlier
[1:27:45] for the Sadducees
[1:27:47] Temple worship was the Cornerstone of
[1:27:50] the Jewish religion everything revolved
[1:27:52] around the temple the sacrifices it was
[1:27:55] temple-centric no Temple
[1:27:58] no Judaism
[1:28:01] for the Pharisees
[1:28:03] well they they took the written word in
[1:28:05] the oral tradition and and their
[1:28:07] religion was portable if you didn't have
[1:28:09] a temple they tried to interpret things
[1:28:11] in the context of the culture and the
[1:28:13] times that they found themselves so they
[1:28:15] wanted the temple there but if the
[1:28:17] temple was gone that wasn't the end of
[1:28:19] it all as far as they were concerned for
[1:28:21] the Sadducees it was and they were the
[1:28:23] ones that ran the temple
[1:28:27] so while the Pharisees survived the
[1:28:30] destruction of the temple some 40 years
[1:28:32] later
[1:28:33] the Sadducees didn't
[1:28:35] they disappeared shortly after that as
[1:28:37] an influential sect
[1:28:40] and they these authorities laid hands on
[1:28:43] them now it wasn't to extend a blessing
[1:28:46] it wasn't to pray for them it was to
[1:28:49] seize them it was to arrest them
[1:28:53] and they put them
[1:28:55] and hold now we'll we'll discover when
[1:28:58] we get deeper into chapter four I say we
[1:29:01] not when I lead you deeper into chapter
[1:29:03] four but somebody else is going to do
[1:29:05] that
[1:29:06] that wasn't just Peter and John but the
[1:29:08] lame man was also put in hold
[1:29:11] well you'll see that in the context of
[1:29:14] what happens
[1:29:16] so they're in jail
[1:29:18] until the next day
[1:29:20] why
[1:29:21] it's evening
[1:29:23] so it says here that uh for it was now
[1:29:26] even tied so these events transpire over
[1:29:28] a period of one or two hours because
[1:29:30] remember it was about three in the
[1:29:31] afternoon as they approached the gate
[1:29:33] then the miracle took place then they
[1:29:36] went up to the porch then the crowds
[1:29:39] came then they started to address them
[1:29:40] then they got arrested they got dragged
[1:29:42] off to jail
[1:29:44] so it took a couple of hours
[1:29:47] however
[1:29:49] however
[1:29:51] how be it
[1:29:53] in spite of the intimidating actions of
[1:29:55] the authorities witnessing the seizure
[1:29:57] and arrest of Peter and John and the
[1:29:59] healed man many of them many of the
[1:30:02] crowd gathered at Solomon's porch which
[1:30:05] heard the word
[1:30:06] Peter and John
[1:30:08] believed
[1:30:10] they accepted their teaching and
[1:30:13] instruction and exhortation and the
[1:30:15] shadow were maybe more accurately in
[1:30:18] light of
[1:30:19] the undeniable miracle
[1:30:22] and the number of men was about five
[1:30:25] thousand
[1:30:26] so this sermon
[1:30:28] after a miracle of healing this
[1:30:30] interrupted sermon
[1:30:32] was more effective
[1:30:34] than the sermon on the day of Pentecost
[1:30:36] which added three thousand
[1:30:39] so now they're up to nearly ten thousand
[1:30:41] people in a pretty short time we can
[1:30:44] only speculate that other disciples and
[1:30:46] followers of Jesus stepped up and helped
[1:30:48] these new converts they didn't just
[1:30:50] stand around with their hands on their
[1:30:51] pockets
[1:30:53] it came to pass on the morrow
[1:30:56] next day that their rulers the the
[1:30:59] Jewish rulers and elders
[1:31:02] and scribes
[1:31:04] and anus the high priest
[1:31:07] note again this was a political office
[1:31:09] after the Revolt of The Maccabees the
[1:31:11] the aaronic priesthood the descendants
[1:31:14] of Aaron to be priests had disappeared
[1:31:15] centuries before
[1:31:18] so this was now a political thing and
[1:31:20] the Sadducees were the office holders
[1:31:22] ran the temple they were the ones that
[1:31:24] would be threatened by this kind of
[1:31:25] thing
[1:31:26] so Annas the high priest and kfs that
[1:31:29] these two Anderson kaifa said just weeks
[1:31:31] earlier presided over Jesus trial
[1:31:34] and John not the disciple we don't know
[1:31:37] who this John is and Alexander And as
[1:31:39] many as we're the Kindred of the high
[1:31:41] priests were gathered together at
[1:31:42] Jerusalem
[1:31:43] a little bit of nepotism going on here
[1:31:46] and this list was written for the for
[1:31:48] the benefit of the generation at the
[1:31:50] time of the writing of the ACT some of
[1:31:51] these names don't mean a lot to us now
[1:31:53] but it meant something these were people
[1:31:55] that they knew of then at that time
[1:31:59] and when they
[1:32:01] the ruling Council
[1:32:03] had set them Peter and John and as we'll
[1:32:07] see the healed man in the midst they
[1:32:08] asked by what power
[1:32:11] or by what name
[1:32:13] have you done this
[1:32:15] then Peter
[1:32:18] filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:32:20] remember what Jesus says about the
[1:32:22] reason for the infilling of the spirit
[1:32:24] to be Witnesses of him starting in where
[1:32:27] Jerusalem where is this Council and
[1:32:30] Jerusalem he said unto them ye rulers of
[1:32:33] the people and Elders of Israel
[1:32:38] we're going to stop
[1:32:41] we set the stage now
[1:32:43] hopefully it's a bit of a cliffhanger
[1:32:45] and you'll come back next Wednesday and
[1:32:47] at this time if the musicians would
[1:32:48] please come back to their instruments
[1:32:52] and while they're coming
[1:32:54] are reminded of a song written by our
[1:32:57] brother Fred Barker many years ago
[1:33:00] it's it's the life behind the name is
[1:33:03] the name of the song
[1:33:07] I suspect some of you here may have been
[1:33:09] present in the old Tabernacle on South
[1:33:12] Stone the day brother green invited
[1:33:14] brother Fred to come and share his
[1:33:16] testimony and his experience with with
[1:33:19] brother Branham
[1:33:20] at that time brother Fred lived in
[1:33:22] California he wasn't what we would call
[1:33:24] a follower of the message he was
[1:33:26] associated with a Full Gospel
[1:33:28] businessman and was a very solid
[1:33:30] Christian man but it was during that
[1:33:32] service while he was sharing
[1:33:36] the brother Barker received a revelation
[1:33:38] of what brother branham's Ministry was
[1:33:41] all about
[1:33:42] shortly after that he and his family
[1:33:44] moved to Tucson were part of the
[1:33:46] fellowship here until his passing
[1:33:49] so I wonder if if we could sing this
[1:33:51] together I hope you know it I hope you
[1:33:54] can drown me out and don't have to
[1:33:55] listen to me
[1:33:57] it's the life behind the name
[1:34:01] that makes the demons tremble it's the
[1:34:07] life behind the name
[1:34:10] that makes the proud heart
[1:34:14] it was God who devised a plan
[1:34:19] that in all things as a man
[1:34:26] [Music]
[1:34:32] it's the life behind the names
[1:34:36] that makes the demons tremble this will
[1:34:42] fly behind the name
[1:34:45] that makes the proud heart humble this
[1:34:50] was God who divides the plan
[1:34:55] okay
[1:35:08] it's the life
[1:35:12] that makes the demons trampled it's
[1:35:17] right behind the name
[1:35:20] that makes
[1:35:25] life
[1:35:40] let's stand one more time

[1:39:25] just means so much to us because as our
[1:39:29] brother Lyle said these are common
[1:39:30] people but they had the very same Spirit
[1:39:35] of Christ that Jesus Christ himself had
[1:39:38] and they walked in that spirit and they
[1:39:42] did these Miracles I I appreciate it
[1:39:45] brother Lyle pointing pulling that out
[1:39:47] in the scripture about brother about
[1:39:50] John
[1:39:51] and how have John he wanted to be one of
[1:39:55] those one of those elevated ones and and
[1:39:58] even brother Lyle didn't have he could
[1:40:00] have gone much deeper brother brother
[1:40:02] John he even knew the high priest we see
[1:40:06] that that in the in the gospels that
[1:40:09] John had connections to some of to some
[1:40:12] of the the uh the Sadducees it would be
[1:40:15] and he was able to go in to the areas
[1:40:18] that other people wouldn't wouldn't be
[1:40:20] able to go into so I really appreciate
