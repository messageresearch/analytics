my friend welcome God bless you can I have a few minutes and just to just to say a few words um first let me read a scripture book of 1 John chapter 4 verse 7 it says this 1 John 47 it says beloved let us love one another for love is of God and everyone that loveth is born of God and knoweth God he that loveth not knoweth not God for God is love love in this was manifested the love of God toward us because that God sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him believe brother is also quoting John 3:16 there he wrote he wrote both of those herin is love not that we loved God but that he loved us and sent his son to be the perpetuation of our sins beloved if God so loved us we ought also to love one another no man hath seen God at any time if we love one another God dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in US hereby know that we that hereby hereby know we that we dwell in him and he in US because he hath given us of his spirit and we have seen and do testify that the father sent the son to be the savior of the world whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the son of God God dwelleth in him and he in God and we have known and believed the love that God hath to us God is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God in him amen wonderful words I want to say a few words tonight before we um we go into our our tape service I was outside before service and I uh I drove I drove by Stone and I took a left uh to come into the church and there was two uh two young people they were sitting on the on the wall over there and I uh so I pulled in and they were um sitting there on the wall talking and and I got out and and I told them I said hey this is this is private property and uh they're like oh okay and and they they get up and they they left they they um started to leave and brothers and sisters listen right there is the time that you have a decision to make and I had a decision to make am I going to just let them go or am I going to take an opportunity and talk about the Lord and worry about and and do something for these two Souls that were there one of them was a red-headed young man he had kind of long hair and he was 19 years old his name is Johnny the the other is um his name is Alex and he's 22 years old and he's what looks like a trans what we would call a trans um looks like he he was born a boy and and um he is taking looks like he's taking hormones I can't speak for him but he's he's making a some sort of a transition and so I said I said hey I said uh you guys live around here or what and so we we were standing um in the street and they're like well yeah you know we do and and I said I said so why why are you sitting here what what do you guys do and the one kid said he had a job doing this and the other kid says he says I am completely unemployed I don't do anything so I I said you know what come on over here let's come back and let's let's start talking about this and I I started talking to him on the sidewalk there and I said list listen I said you boys I said you're you you need to do something you need to make a living you need this is a pivotal time in your life we started talking and then I said you know what come on over here let's go sit down and I said do you have anything to do and they said no we're just you know we're just hanging out so I said let's let's sit here and we we sat there um on the short wall and I started talking to them about the Lord and I said I said do you do you all have any type of Rel relationship with God or anything like that and the one um Alex said and they're they're speaking in their in their vernacular of a young man that that they're not used to talking to a minister or someone that that that goes to church so so there was there was some what be would be perceived as disrespect but it wasn't disrespect it was just the way that they talk and uh and using the swear words and stuff and and the one young man said he says you know he says 'well if there is a God he said all the things that are going on right now he said something on the order of you know he he'd be really messed up and I said uh I said okay and then then the other one he um I don't remember what he said and I started talking to them about the Lord and I said I said well have you ever considered him have you ever thought about about if there is If there really is a true God and I said I said what you said I said that's because that's the way that you think and you have in your mind you have an image of what God should be and this is if you were God this is how you would be I said but God is different than you and he's different than me God has his way of doing things and I'll tell you God's way of doing things he does everything in one thing and it's in love and I quoted this scripture to him that I just read I said God knows the beginning from the end God knows what we have need of and the other young man the redheaded boy he started listening and he he started saying he he says yeah he says he says you know some people say that there's no God he says I'm agnostic and a very bright young man extremely intelligent you could just feel it just emanating from him the other one said yeah I'm an agnostic too and and he didn't I don't think he knew what agnostic meant but I said I asked them I said well what is agnostic and they were like well and I said basically you're not denying that there could be a God but there is just nothing in you that's seeking that God and they said yeah and especially the redheaded young man said that and I said I said listen I said when God God does things he does them for a purpose and I say you see all of the death and all of the suffering and and all of these problems that are in the in the world I said do you think maybe that they're for a purpose I said it's not because God wants someone to suffer but God sees the end and we're here right we're here right at the very beginning or in the middle but God sees the end and he wants salvation for his children he really cares for us and and the the one young man said said yeah and and he started talking and I said you know I said there's a there's a a scripture I said there is a prophet in the Bible I said a prophet is someone that speaks on behalf of God and I said this Prophet was named Isaiah and he addressed what you're saying he said God's ways are not your ways his thoughts are not your thoughts his ways are higher than our ways and his thoughts are higher than our thoughts he understands these things and he wants us to be successful in life to where at the end that we will have this eternal blessing and then the the one young man he starts talking about he says you know he says churches Don't Preach about demons and I saidwell I said I said they do I said some of them do I said they're definitely in the Bible and he says that's right he says they're real and I said you know what these demons do they influence and I said there's demons on this side and there's angels on this side and both of them are influencing and I said the angels are influencing people to love to selflessness to giving to helping to sacrifice I said that that is what the angels are are influencing people to and I said the demons are influencing people to self-righteousness to selfishness to serving themselves more than serving someone else to hatred to vitriol I said that's what they are influencing us to and that and the other is what God's angels are influencing us to and I said and they are influencing us I said you know what they're influencing us right now in this Courtyard and then and I and I started conversing with the young W with both of them and and talking with them and and the one young man he was like this is this is amazing and I told him a story about Daniel and how Daniel was got down and he he started praying and he and fasting he said Lord I've had this experience I need to know what it means I this is this is vital to me and then 21 days later an angel came to Daniel and he tells him this he says that Daniel from the moment you started praying 21 three weeks ago God sent me he dispatched me to come to you and to give you understanding he said but when I was on the road he said I met a demon this Prince of Persia and he says I've been fighting with him all this time and he says I needed help and then this other angel came down this Prince Michael and he helped me and I said explain that and these boys were locked on now like really yes that's what the Bible is full of and and this Angel gets to Daniel and he gives him this understanding and I said do you think those angels are here with us today they said yeah and I and I tried to explain to them that these that God loves us these things are important and it's you know what it's stuck I could feel it brother Joe in the young man named Johnny I could feel he was his his he started quivering when he was talking he started he started to getting excited and I said that's what it's about and I said that's what a church is about a church is about serving other people and and trying to get people to the Lord and I told them the story I said you know you've heard about Sin and all this and I looked at the young man and I said I said I said brother I said you're wrong in what you're doing you're wrong in this this sexual deviation that that is that you're going towards in your life I said but also I said you have a weakness there I said but other people have a weakness for lying other people have a weakness for stealing other people have a weakness for gossiping I said it's all being influenced by the enemy and I said you know what there's going to be some people that overcome these things and I said why do you think that God allowed you to have this weakness and he says he says well you know I was born this way and I said yeah I'm sure you were born that way I said some people are born Liars some people are born cheaters but they overcome those things and I said you can overcome this and he said he he said well basically he didn't want to it's fine it's not fine it's sin and if there's no condemnation for sin in us then there's there's a lot worse problems there than than being a a sexual deviant but now if there is something in us that wants to change that wants to get better I said do you think maybe that God allowed you to have this weakness or I looked at the other young man or you have your weaknesses or me have my weaknesses that God allowed us to have these weaknesses so that we would build character and that we could be able to overcome and make it on the other side through the salvation of Jesus Christ and I said it's twofold old brother I said that you can overcome I said but why overcome am I famous that I always say because it's not about you maybe you can help someone else who has the same weakness if you overcome these weaknesses then you can say Hey Brother listen I used to be like that here here how I overcame it I used to be this I used to suffer with this perversion or I used to be a liar or I used to be a a cheater a thief or a drug addict and I overcame it now you can overcome it if I can do it you can do it explaining to him how you can help someone else we had a great conversation and and and I said oh you know we've been here long and I said I said I'm sorry for taking your time and the one kid was like no no no no he goes I'm really liking this all right I'll keep going so we continued talking about these different perspectives of the Lord and I said let me tell you I said when Jesus came I said you know why he was hated hated so much he was hated so much because he hung out with Sinners I said it's all over the Bible it's all over the New Testament you can't deny it he was hated and they said you the reason we hate you is because you're hanging around with prostitutes and sinners Tax Collectors it's in the Bible you can't deny it it's not my Doctrine it's Jesus's Doctrine or John or Matthew or Mark or Luke it's their doctrines so I said and I tell them the story of there was a woman that was caught in adultery in the very Act of adultery with a married man and Moses's law which was the Bible Moses's law was that these people would be put to death by stoning I said it was written in the Bible that's what the punishment was so they were into this and I said so there was a bunch of preachers they came up and they're like oh here's the new Young Rabbi and he always takes the side of the Sinners so we're going to trap him so they look at Jesus they knew that he had a heart for for all of the Sinners and they said this woman was caught in the very Act of adulter they knew the Bible they knew that this word commanded that they would be they would be killed by stoning so they said what should we do and I said you know what Jesus did and and the one boy when I said that he stood up and he was like what he got excited he said what what did they do what did he do and I said he knelt down and I said he just drew in the sand and he left all of these preachers there looking at him and he made him wait Drew in the sand and then he stood up and when I stood up they both kind of went back like that and he said you that is without sin cast the first stone the other boy said hey I know that story and I said you know what happened the older and wiser they started dropping their Stones because they knew they had sin in their lives all the way down dropping their stones and they all walked away and I said you know what he said he looked down at the lady and he said where are your accusers and she looked around they're all gone and I said this is so Jesus this is so Jesus he says neither I do I accuse you he said but go and sin no more and I said guys I said it's important that you live right and then he the the the one young man he's like man he goes I want to I want to like a I want to go to a philosophical do you have any like like philosophy classes that you teach here in the in the church and I said you know I said some of the young people have been asking for to do that I said maybe we'll start doing it and and they were they were just they were excited the one was really excited and so I went back and and uh I walk in and I see sister Shirley's there and she's praying and only one in the church and I just said Lord I'm the lowest of the low Lord I'm below that young man that was a transsexual that doesn't know if he's a boy or a girl no better than him I see these these people walking out down the street and and strung out on drugs and everything and I said I said 'lord I had good parents my parents led me my parents took care of me they taught me right they they they steered me away from that stuff these people don't have that they're better than I am I looked at the the young man told me I said where are your parents I said do you live with your parents he said he said no my parents are 2,000 miles away this kid's 19 years old he said my parents are 2,000 miles away I said why he says they're mentally ill he says I had to leave and I said where do you live he says I just live right down the street right down here and I said how are you how are you how you making ends meet he says I live by myself he says I have a job that kid I look at that kid he's better than I am I look at him he's got more potential than I ever had I had it and I told them I told when they were leaving I said you know what I said I've had it easy I said you guys you can do something with your lives you can be something great serve God and that's how I feel now and and tonight we're going to listen to this this sermon on Hebrews and let me tell you let me tell you a man that was low that was the lowest of the low is the man that's going to be preaching tonight I was I met a man named Don Weber um do you for the people that listen to tapes did you ever hear Brother brandom's story of when they couldn't make ends meet at the church and there was a little lady in the front and they'd always they'd always Pass the Plate but brother brandom came out and he said because they wouldn't get enough money and I was actually able to to look at the records of the church in that time they would get like 90 cents in an offering I was telling somebody the other day you know how much that is today it's like 30 bucks how could we run a church on $30 a week you can't but that's about how much they were getting brother brandom they couldn't they had to pay the electric bill and and they couldn't they couldn't do it so he said you know what I'm going to take the offering back then there wasn't a lot of people at the Tabernacle so he goes out and he says okay we're going to take an offering we need this help and there was a little old lady in the front and she pulled out her little purse and opened it up and he just couldn't do it he said I was just kidding I was just kidding we're not going to do that that lady's name was Sister Weber I met her son he's about 90 years old when I met him he was was there he was a young boy when they were laying the Cornerstone for the brandom Tabernacle at eth and Pinn Street in Jeffersonville and he said that they had two big wagons and they had the big trusses that they were bringing down the street to to put it up and he told me who loaned brother brandom the money he told he he had just wonderful information about all of this history and he says there was nobody very few people in church for for years and years and years and this Don Weber he says you know he says I want you to talk to my sister who was there too so and neither of them were were message Believers like we would call message Believers and I so I met this his sister I can't remember her name and I sat down with her in her house sweet lady and she says she tells me this she says you know she says you probably don't know it but them brandom's were Drinkers and I said no I actually knew that and she said now we went to school she says I went to school with Billy and she says this was The Depression she says everyone was poor she said but those brandom boys she said they were poor poor they were the poorest of the poor she says I remember them and the clothes that they would wear and she said that they would make make fun of them now this is a woman that went to school with this family and she remembered how destitute these people were it shows you the character that was built in that man and how he grew up and why how God could put him through those things and how he could do so much for so many people is because he went through it it was hard and he came out the other side of with a as a man of great great character thinking on those things and and brothers and sisters like I said I feel like I'm nothing compared to what these people could be brother Paul and I have been talking before about how we'd we'd like to witness to some of these homeless people and TR and try to encourage them to get on the right track the problem is the same problem with with the others they don't want to that that something else is more important it's usually drugs but if we could just present Jesus Christ to these people if we could just say here is what Jesus is today and you know what it is it's that scripture I just read God is love they would know that these people showed me love that these people made me feel important and that's what the man that we're going to hear tonight and preaching on this book of Hebrews he came from the worst he came from the lowest of the low he's a good man he knew how it was not to have any money he knew how it was not to have shoes he knew how it was not to even have a shirt he had to go to school he was embarrassed he didn't have a shirt so he wore a jacket wore a coat and and and it was too warm the teacher made him sit as you know the story by the stove by the wood burning stove because he was wearing his coat and he he told the teacher he's cold he was embarrassed that he didn't have anything on underneath it Jesus Christ said he said the foxes have dens no he said he said birds have trees he said they have homes these animals have homes but I don't even have a home I don't even have a place to sleep tonight Jesus knew how it was and brothers and sisters we need to always remember those people that don't have as much as we do and put them as more important as you are make them more important because they need it brother brandham did I've often said I used to write an article for the magazine that we did and I would drive I would ride my bike around and I talk to I talk to these these old people sitting on their porch and and I'd ask them if they knew William brandom almost all of them did and almost and all of them without exception with no exceptions not one exception and I talked to I'd say probably a hundred people not one exception no one said a bad word word about him no one had a bad experience with the man William brandom they say a lot about him now because he's gone but the ones that met him loved him without exception and I can say I am a witness to that I they all thought he made everyone feel so good he made them feel like they were special I'm brothers and sisters I'm sorry for for taking all the time I just I wanted to get it out let's all [Applause] [Music] stand from Leviticus 1918 Thou shalt not avenge nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people but Thou shalt love the neighbor as thyself I am the Lord that was my scripture today [Music] only be only be all things are possible only only be only be all things are possible only the following sermon Hebrews chapter 4 57- 91e we'll start at the beginning and we'll go about 50 minutes into the sermon brothers and sisters whether you agree with him or not this man was a Christian this man showed the spirit of Christ Hebrews chapter 4 God bless you brother is to know more about our blessed Lord amen and that's our our purpose of gathering here is for that purpose and now and to pray for God's sick children and this morning we had a a wonderful blessing from the scriptures we are trying to take each time of the service a part of I'm teaching in the book of Hebrews have been for the last couple weeks now and now if the Lord willing will continue on Wednesday night then on Sunday morning and Sunday night on for as long as I'm to be here in this time not a Revival but it's Revival a meeting on our regular nights amen and so we're very very happy to have this time to meet with our good friends around about in the cities and around about the fall cities here and if um if we happen to have a cancellation or something it might be that the Lord might lead us pretty soon to maybe we could have a few nights maybe in the gym or something after a while if the Lord seems to lead that way to a place where we could get our people together and we've seen people as it's coming up going back saying there was not room to to come in of course the Tabernacle is awful little it just seats a very very few people and we are uh just so glad that you're willing to come out and set in the heat uh to hear the word of the Lord and we're praying that God will exceedingly abundantly bless you and to help you and now tonight we want we're beginning on the fourth chap how many we here this morning let's see your hands oh that's wonderful practically all of you and we are on beginning on the fourth chapter of the book of Hebrews oh what a marvelous book are you enjoying it and it's comparing scripture by scripture and Paul before he would ever witness to his experience he first had to go down to Arabia and find out by the word if it was the truth I like that and this morning's lesson we found out in the teaching this morning that Christ was the same yesterday today and forever and Paul found that the same Pillar of Fire that led the children of Israel had met him on the road to Damascus we found out that the pillar of fire that led the children of Israel out of the Wilderness to the promised land met Paul on the road to Damascus and called himself Jesus amen then we find out the real Supreme deity of Jesus Christ the whole book here is just a revelation of Jesus Christ and he come we find it in Sun Times and in diverse manners God spoke to the fathers through the prophets in this last days through his son Christ Jesus he's revealed himself and the book from Genesis to Revelations is nothing but one constant Perpetual revelation of the Lord Jesus and we find out that he was the one that was in the burning bush we find out that he was the one that was with God before the foundation of the world and we find out that in the New Testament he was God in man together amen and then when he left the New Testament to go into heaven he said I came from God and I returned to God and then when Paul met him he was in the same form that he was when he led Israel a pillar of fire and Paul looked him right into the face being unconverted and it caused him to have eye trouble the rest of his days he went blind and for several days he could not see nothing at all he had to be led to a street called straight and God had a prophet down there that he spoke to by the name of ananas who came in by a vision and laid his hands on Paul and said brother Saul receive thy sight and we find out then that that same holy spirit that same Lord Jesus came to Peter in the farm of a light and delivered him out of the prison and we find that that same Lord Jesus and these days is still in that Pillar of Fire Light that's leading his people his church performing the same thing giving Visions come in and lay hands on the People by a vision the Lord Jesus who met last Sunday morning at the house and said there was a man coming blackheaded graying he was a Greek his wife was middle-aged and would be Weeping at the altar some of them had told it and know it was happening he was both crippled the the banel nerve in his head was gone he couldn't even have control of his feet or his Limbs and he was blind and to make it double prooof I had a little lady to come pray for the sick first then turned back around and had brother Thomas to come pray and we sitting here watching it develop and then I went out and prayed for the sick and walked back and she come just exactly according to the vision and caught me by the arm and began weeping and said Dr aaman had sent them here Dr aaman is the bosom friend of mine Catholic his boy is a priest at the monastery at um at St Miner and down Indiana this man was from Jasper and the Lord healed him out of that church got up and walked and could see as good as anybody else and walked out of the building nor and ho all by a vision brother Saul the Lord Jesus that appeared to you in the way has sent me that I might lay my hands on you that you might receive your sight and be filled with the Holy Ghost amen wonderful praise the Lord then we find out seeing that we have this great salvation we should not we could not escape the penalties and wrath of God if we neglect such a great salvation now we're going to start reading tonight out and begin the fourth chapter of the book of Hebrews if anybody wants to follow along we got some Bibles here if they want one while one of the ushers will bring it to you hold up your hand these these bibles if one of the Brethren here will uh take there's two Bibles Ling there I believe and um and and now we'll hurry because we have communion after a bit and where we get done tonight Wednesday night we begin again now I believe this morning in our reading we begin on the 15th verse somebody maybe not know me putting on glasses to read by I'm getting old and I can still read but I can't pick it fast especially when I'm got fine reading here fine print and I went to have my eyes examined to see if I was really losing my sight my eyes were 10 10 he said but you're past 40 son you had a thing for me to read says start reading I read it and I kept getting closer it got slower and slower and it got about like this I stopped then he put out there for 10 10 I could read it anywhere but he said what it is when you pass 40 your eyeballs get flat now I can squint my eyes and read just that post to me but you have to squint so he just made me a pair of of glasses I can see it anywhere when it's real close to me now when it gets all from me can't see it all with these things but I read them uh read from this with the glasses now this morning we had the last part of the third chapter of the Hebrews and oh what Rich Colonels we find I listen I want to read again so we get a background now not talk on it but just kind of go go over it a little while it is said today if you hear his voice Harden not your hearts as in the provocation for some then they heard the word when they had heard the word did provoke how be it not all that came out of Egypt by Moses I end that this morning we find that he said don't Harden your heart now as in the days of provocation that's when they provoke God to anger because that he had give to them Moses his prophet and a sign that was with Moses how many of the class tonight knows what that sign was Pillar of Fire Hebrews 13 now we don't know whether the congregation saw that sign or not but Moses saw it for Moses first met him in in a burning bush he was a fire and the children of Israel obeyed Moses and left Egypt and as soon as they come out of Egypt God we found LED them right into a trap where Pharaoh's Army behind them the Red Sea on either side and God put them to test and they got scared and it provoked God he said why do you cry at me said just speak and go forward amen I like that now they were following Moses as Moses followed the pillar and cloud and they were on their way to the promised land beautiful picture of the church tonight on our way to the promised land led by The Same Spirit same signs and wonders as God spoke of now notice then they come to the Wilderness of sin the W the waters were bitter M why did God lead him to Bitter Waters looks like he'll led him to good water but he led them to Bitter Water so he could prove their faith he likes to do it amen he likes to let tribulation come on you so he can show you his love and his power how can people today who doesn't believe in the miracle working of God when tribulations come they just give up and go on but we believe that God works miracles amen he can't God has listen to this if God doesn't act the same when the the same circumstances arise than God's guilty of being partial to his people amen God's sovereignty demands of him to work in every case like he did the first case or he was wrong when he worked in the first case amen if God does not act in the same way he did on the first case if he'll act different to the second case that he acted wrong when he acted on the first case if God healed was sick in the Old Testament he's got to do it in the New Testament and today or he did wrong when he healed him back there he's got to act the same every time and he will do it when the same Faith meets a condition the faults in us not in God for we see him on some and many work great outstanding Miracles we know it the critic cannot say it's not so for we see it prove it there it is they used to say show me a miracle they can't say that no more science can't say it no more we can absolutely prove to the scientific world and the scientific world has witness that a supernatural being in a form of a pillar of Fire is with us here's this picture right here and one hangs in Washington DC tonight it is the same Christ therefore is a while my ministering brother used to tell me oh brother BR that's the devil don't you fool with that have me scared and I would not preach it until God came and revealed it that he's the same Jesus the same one oh then try to shake it out of me can't be done for it's the scripture it's God's word it's not just an experience that's loose it's an experience that's backed up by God's word and God's Eternal blessed promise Hallelujah now we notice over here then that he said for some when they had heard did provoke certainly they got weary every time they get to a place where a showdown come then what would they do they would fly loose and get weary and want to turn back and why did this happen to me strange thing this morning after preaching that just as hard as I could there was many came to the alter and questioning why does this happen to me you see how it go it goes over the top of the people's head help it's it's just the same people Jesus said you have eyes but you can't see he said that to the disciples they said Lo now thou speakest plainly now we believe no man has to tell you anything because God shows it he said do you now believe after all this time see you mustn't question anything to God amise God for the footsteps of the righteous is ordered out of the law and every trial is put up on you to prove you and the Bible said there're more precious to you than gold amen so if God let a few light afflictions happen to you remember it's far the correction of you amen every son that cometh to God must first be chastened of God and tried amen help us Lord child trained there's no exceptions every son that cometh these afflictions are done brought about to see what attitude you'll take amen see it's God on this Proving Ground that's all Earth is is The Proving Ground amen and where he's trying to prove you now listen as we go ahead and I want to get the last part of this and to whom he swear that they should not enter into his rest now that's where we're coming to tonight into his rest but to them that believe not so we see that they could not enter because of unbelief now what is sin unbelief God had come to him in a pillar of fire sent his prophet and anointed him give him signs to do before the people and then the pillar of Fire by the prophet LED them out every circumstance they come to they begin to murmur and say every little fault they found with Moses begin to chat and chatter against him and God was displeased because he said they were sinning amen they should have listened but instead of that they listened to reason how can it be how can these things be if he's got everything is possible and he'll make all things work together for good to them that love him now we're going into a great study here that is on the rest the Sabbath amen now they were pilgrims in their Journey see they had been down in Egypt 400 years and in bondage and now they were being brought out by The Miracles of God according to his promise and they were on the road to the promised land and here a supernatural light appears in amongst them and begins to lead them now some of them would say now look at here who is this Moses who made you a ruler overs aren't you one of us who put you down here to be our boss you think you know more than our pastor does you think you know more than the priest does you think you're you're smarter than what our religious man are this day that had nothing to do with it it was God Amen in the pillar of fire of vindicating that he was in the move didn't make any who was smart who wasn't smart it was the idea of following what God put before them well Moses as far as physical done a foolish thing when he tried to deliver the children by the word of God taking a bunch of people out in the wilderness when he had his well he was an heir to everything to had he had every Army there was and all the world whipped and there he was a great military General and the next movie is to be king pharaoh of Egypt why he could just have stepped up to the throne and said all right children go on back to your home that settles it he was a pharaoh but Moses oh here it is Moses by faith saw the promise of God and the angel of the the Lord come to himen and he know more about God in five minutes in the presence of that angel and he learned in 40 years with the teachers of Egypt he know that he was he seen the supernatural down he said I'll be with you Moses I'll go before you and they understood and he give him signs to perform now they were on their road to the land of rest rest God had them a rest a place where they wouldn't have to be test Masters over them to drive them to make them do things what a beautiful picture it is today when we look at the church and see the church in its condition every man that's born to the spirit of God despises the world J if you love the world are the things of the world the love of God's not even in you that's what the Bible said and the real Pilgrim on his Road simply hates the things of the world he hates to see man drinking he hates to see man smoking he hates to see women on the street with them little little dirty clothes on he hates to see bunk clothes and card parties and yesterday while brother Tony or brother woods and I were coming through the street and some more some of the man there was a little lady there in Louisville coming down the street lovely looking little woman with a clothes on that was horrible just a little way up on the hip and a little ribbon tied on her hips on each side and a little bitty round piece of cloth in front of her and tied with a string behind walking down the street horribly and every man on the street looking at her I said she doesn't realize that she's guilty in the sight of God with committing adultery with every man that looked on her in that manner and she'll answer at the day of judgment for committing adultery with those men Jesus said whosoever look at TH old woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already amen that's right so you see brother wood said to me what do you allow for that brother Bram I said it's either mental deficiency or devil possession amen there's only two things to make it a decent clean woman won't wear those things unless she's devil possessed it's exactly the truth now a pilgrim that's on his road to Heaven he lives in a different atmosphere you don't have to worry about him looking at her he'll turn in his head if he's got God in his heart for he's living in an atmosphere that's a million miles from those things that's right you don't want to be guilty of that stuff at the Judgment so he turns his head and think God have mercy on the woman and on he goes we're in our journey we're on our way to canaan's land we're on our way to that Eternal and bless for rest that God has given us and in the journey we are tempted we are tempted of all kinds of things but yet be tempted without sinning now notice as we go to the fourth chapter let us therefore fear let us therefore fear L the promise being left us to enter into his rest I want you to remember that unless we find out unless God has revealed it to us no matter how much we go to church that has nothing to do with it God must come by Revelation and reveal himself to us that takes all the things of the world out now while it is said today if you now let's start the the fourth chapter let us there fear lest a promise being left us to enter into his rest I remember when they were on the road to rest the pillar far LED them now we want to find out what is this rest let us fear lest the promise being left us to enter into his rest watch any of you should seem to come short of it now here's the promise here's what we got to fear if there's not a promise left us but there is a promise and then the next thing don't come short of it amen now the thought is if we are on our way to the rest what is the rest where is it is it joining church is it being uh baptized a certain way is it becoming a member of the greatest Church in the city wearing better clothes is it education is it money so we can get work just lay down rest the rest of her life as we call it that's not it listen what the Bible says it is and how we get it let us therefore fear less a promise being left us to enter into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it for unto us the day then the gospel was was preached as well as unto them what is the gospel the good news the good news came to them in Egypt that God has sent a deliverer and it's going to bring us out and take us to the promised land the good news to us now that God has sent a deliverer the Holy Ghost and we're on a road to the promised land now people has made it Creeds and denominations but God Still Remains at our rest is the holy ghosten Lois gospel was preached un them as well listen to us but the word preached did not profit them the remember the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it oh my brethren let me stop here for a minute no matter how much the word is preached how well you like the way it's been preached unless you yourself are a PO Aker of that amen it won't do you one bit of good not being mixed with Faith by them that heard it amen they seen the Miracles of Moses they said that's pretty good and they walked over and they they seen perform Miracles and seen the pillar of fire maybe or heard them talk about it oh that's all right but it wasn't mixed with personal faith for as soon as they got to the Wilderness they every every one begin to murmur and God said because if they doubted it was sin amen don't doubt nothing amen believe don't doubt no matter how hard the case is believe it now they begin to murmur and God overthrow them and then he swore in his wrath that they should never enter into his rest and the Bible said here I believe it's in the the third chapter that their carcasses fell in the wilderness the third chapter the 17th verse but with whom he was grieved for 40 years was it not with them that had sin whose cares fell in the wilderness and of all of them that come out of Egypt only two went into the promised land out of the whole anti luian world in the days gone by there were eight Souls saved out of billions straight is the gate and narrow is the way amen and but few there will be that'll find it some people says say brother R what about all these thousands that the Bible said appear there just remember how many's died in each generation it's been Christians down to the age they'll all resurrect that makes up the body amen you're expecting to be 100 billion in this America come out or some other this world to today there might not be 50 come out amen but the great Ransom church is laying in the dust awaiting there are God's Jewels that's resting in the dust but their souls are under the altar of God they're not in their right state they're in a body truly but a theosophy and they cried out to God how long they could see one another but they couldn't shake each other's hands that kind of a body you meet your mother in glory tonight if you should go you couldn't shake her hand cuz she has not that kind of a hand you couldn't feel it like could feel now because five senses is what's putting this body could of control the presence of her would be felt in a different atmosphere that's like a husband and wife there'll be no married or giving in married in heaven why because there is a different kind of love there's no sexual desire all those things has passed away you you're cleansed and pure but you never did live in that state therefore you wasn't created for that state you're just waiting there but you're longing to come back amen where you was created a man in a woman and there God will raise that body Out of the Dust of the earth and glorify then you'll see taste feel smelling hair and Associate praise the Lord we'll never know we can never enjoy Angels life we wasn't created angels God created angels but he created you and I men and women that's the state we'll be forever at his blessed coming now see other fell short because they sin and come short of the glory god showed them the pillar far he showed them signs and wonders he led them out he brought them into temptation to try prove them now haven't you had a lot of Temptation don't complain about him Rejoice God's with you he's trying to prove your faith look at job in the Old Testament when he said have you considered my servant job a just man a perfect man there is none like him on the earth oh he said sure you got him hedged up doesn't have any troubles doesn't have any wearies he doesn't have any Financial burdens everything's fine he don't have any sickness any pain let me have him I'll make him curse you to your face he said he in your hand but don't you take his life oh he done everything but take his life but he couldn't move job job know he stood pat on the word that's right all the Devils Out of Hell couldn't move him for he know he had offered that sacrifice he was justly accused him said you sined job and God's a punish you he knew that God had that he hadn't sinned before God he knew that he was righteous not because he was a good man but because he was accepting the burnt offering in his sin and tonight we know that his life proved out that he was righteous and when you not trying to get home to Glory because you try to help your neighbor that's good not because you join church that's good but you get home to Glory because you accept the righteousness of Jesus Christ nothing that you've done yourself now as we read on Far unto us was the Gospel preach second verse as well as to them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it Faith wasn't in them that heard the word just think today in the little humble Ministry that the Lord has given me there should be 40 million Americans saved tonight you know what they say watch mental telepathy he's a mind reader no such stuff well he don't belong to our church see it's not no matter how much you lay it on the word and prove that it's God's word it's God's promise how much science would prove it that is true they'll still can't believe that's right the Bible said they couldn't said then what used of preaching God has to have a witness to condemn them at that day amen the word was preached and proved among them and they still ignorantly walked away there nothing left but judgment God could not just could not justly judge a nation unless it had mercy before it had judgment amen he's God he couldn't do it now what do we say for we which believe to have entered into rest as he said as I have sworn in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest although the works was finished from the foundation of the world for he spake in a certain place on on the seventh day on this wise I I do not want to hurt people's feelings against their religion that's not my purpose out in the fields I just preach a regular great Evangelical fundamental doctrines but in the Tabernacle amongst my children here I feel I have a right to preach what I think is Doctrine and Truth see I think that it's right now I have thousands of good saboorian friends of people who are 7-Day Adventists some of the dearest friends that I got some of them are 7-Day Adventists although the great move of the What's called the prophet the um voice of Prophecy they're firmly against me they said that I make the statement in the pull pit and said I was God and um at this light that followed was an angel and I was God and I come to the world to do great things to prove people that I was God now that's what the voice of Prophecy said about me over in California and every who told that you know told something wasn't so but in the first place not taking a thought against the Seventh Day Adventist Church or any other sabbatarian church but only for the sake of the Gospel we're going to get down in a few minutes on Pentecost too yeah true on Baptist we're going to get out on that and show that God doesn't favor any denomination that's right he only favors the individual and he doesn't deal with any denomination he never did and he never will according to his word but he deals with the individuals in every denomination yes it's individuals God deals with now listen to this real clear and if ever any time that question ever comes up to you it'll be settled now may the Lord help us now closely for the fourth verse for he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise now watch he's talking about Sabbath how many knows that the word sa a b b a t h in the he is a Hebrew word that means r s how many knows that English sure don't Sabbath sound a funny word it is don't sanctify sound a funny word sanctify is a Greek word sanctify means to be made holy Hebrew means make holy Greek means sanctify English means make clean Sabbath means a day of rest that's what the old Sabbath was a day of rest when you see rest it means Sabbath look it up in your manuscript if you happen to have a Greek Bible and find out if the word if you got a scof your Bible look at your Marg reading on rest and see if it don't run you back to Sabbath Sabbath means rest amen all right now watch let us therefore fear less a promise being left to us to enter into his Sabbath rest now many people keeps d like keep Sabbath day Saturday others make a Sunday an idol a worship day and by the grace of God and by the God's word God help me tonight I can prove to you that they're both wrong both the Sunday worshipper and the Sabbath keeper there are absolutely both wrong according to the word and after all it's the word that we have to go by not the what Adventist say or not but what the Protestant says or the Catholic says it's what the Bible says now now watch for he spake in a certain place on the seventh day on this wise now we're going to put up a something like this and call this the God's rest the seventh day now watch and God listen to the scripture now God did rest the seventh day from all his work God had a Sabbath and that seventh day was 1,000 years long a type of the Millennium for he spake of the seventh day on this wise and God did rest from all his his work the personal pronoun all his works he rested on the seventh day that's God and in this place under the law if they shall enter into my rest God rested physically for he had made the heavens and earth in six days and on the seventh day he rested from all his work he rested 1,000 years for the Bible said that one day on Earth is a thousand years in heaven a thousand years in heaven is one day on the earth how many knows the scripture says that in second Peter all right God rested on the seventh day and he spoke on this wise at a certain place listen close for he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise and God rested from all his works and in this place again the law if they shall enter into my rest he gave the Jews on their way from the promised land or from the egyp up to the promised land the seventh day Sabbath now listen seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein and to they whom it was first preached the rest God given the law and the Sabbath was the fourth Commandment entered not in because of unbelief now watch he's talking about the law how they entered in wasn't mixed with faith they didn't keep it they kept the Sabbath in a memorial that they were going to a land of Sab AB to have everlasting rest am from all their troubles and all their wearies no more task Masters no more restless nights they were on their way to the promised land of rest it flowed with milk and honey The Grapes was so big that two men packed one Bunch over their shoulders amen oh what a land of blessed rest amen but they failed to get it when they got there because of their unbelief they were turned aside at only 40 miles from where they left in Egypt to the promised land and they were 40 years getting there because of their unbelief amen God gave him the prophet gave him his sign gave him the pillar fire showed signs and wonders and preached of gospel to them and they walked out after the fishes and Loaves and fell in the wilderness and their carcasses perished in the wilderness Jesus at the fountain he they said our fathers eat man in the wilderness for 40 years he said I am that bread of life that come from God out of Heaven amen I am the bread of life Moses didn't give you that bread my father give that bread and I I am the bread that comes from God out of Heaven if a man eats this will never die there's the difference now watch they said he they drank from the rock that was in the wilderness for the space of so many years he said I am that rock Blessed Be His holy name amen I am that rock how could he be that Rock that Rock was a spiritual rock it followed the children of Israel and Moses had a stick in his hand which was a judgment Rod of God and God told him to Smite The Rock and he smoke The Rock and when he did Waters came from the Rock and Christ was that rock and the Judgment of God's penalty of sin was struck upon him God caused to lay on him the iniquity of us all and that iniquity bursted forth his heart and from his heart poured the Holy Spirit like rivers of water to a perishing dying people thank God I am that rock that was in the wildness why he said you mean to tell he said Moses the one that told you that he longed to see my day and he saw it in portion he said now you mean to tell us that you're greater than Moses that You' seen Moses and Moses has been dead 800 years said now we know that you got a devil other words crazy we know that you're crazy he said before Abraham was I am I was a great I am that was in the burning bush I'm that fire that was in the burning bush I'm that angel that went before them and he said I come from God and I I go back to God and he came from God made flesh and dwell Among Us went back to that same pillar far and here he is tonight after 2,000 years the same yesterday today and forever doing the same thing praise the name Lord leading his blessed children and many are coming in because of unbelief now he said he limited a day and day when God finished his work then he limited another day and on this wise that if they shall hear if they shall come they keep the Sabbath go on through the new moons and so forth that's where the Advent Brethren tries to take you back now let's read on notice see therefore that some must enter therein and them to whom it was preached first enter not in because of unbelief now the seventh verse Oh I say the scripture is mathematically inspired amen I say the scripture is uh in an every way inspired the mathematics of the Bible are perfect did you notice this United States is number 13 and everything it does you know it establish a 13 colonist you know the flag will had 13 stars in it first amen you know what everything that the United States does is in a number 13 Did You Know It appears in the Bible in Revelations 13 certainly does the Little Beast the lamb that come up out of water not thickness and multitudes of people not out of the water but out of the land where there's no one it had two little horms civil and ecclesiastic powers and he was a lamb freedom of religion and after a while they went together and he spoke like the dragon and exercise all the power that Rome did before him that's coming to our nation amen you mark it down you watch to the confederation of churches and the Catholic unite together and watch what takes place people who follow the pillar of fire will certainly have a rough time but they're ready for the translation at that time that's right just ready to go fire the lamb overcome them the Bible and they thought him because they were called The Chosen and the faithful the elected of God keep from getting onto that prophecy now so we can run this on listen close the seventh chapter the I mean the four chapter the 7th verse seven is the number of completion three is the number of Life seven is the number of completion and this gives a complete Sabbath and again remember he spoke God on this wise then he spoke of the law on this wise and then again he limited a third day third time again he limited a day a certain day saying in David today after so long a time today after so long a time as it is said today if you will hear his voice Harden not your heart watch if Jesus had given them rest a Sabbath would he not after have spoken of another day the dispensations change with Jesus Christ from the law to Grace from Works into Grace from something you do to what something God did upon your own merits or upon his merits it changed when Moses come out of the Wilderness with the law he said Thou shalt not commit adultery Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not kill keep the Sabbath day holy when Jesus come out of the Wilderness when Moses come the devil tempted him it soon that devil tempted him he heeded to it Moses had a weak spot how many knows what it was temper and as soon as he seen him worship the golden cast he threw down the Commandments and broke them showing you that priesthood would be broken and God give them to him again but when Jesus came out of the Wilderness 40 days of fasting he was hungry the only weak spot he had and the devil come to him and said if thou be the Son of God turn these stones in the bread do a miracle here let me see you do it and I'll believe you Jesus said it's written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeded the mouth of God he know he didn't meet Moses there for he went to the word talk him upon the pinnical temple said if thou be the Son of God cast thyself down and cated not quoted but coed the scripture that it's written to give the angel charge concerning that same time to dash foot against the stone he'll bury the up and Jesus went straight to the word and rebuked him took him up on the mountain and showed him the United States and Germany and Switzerland all the nations of the world whatever would be so they're all mine I do them whatever I want to no where we got Wars and trouble said I do them no wonder women dressed and get by with it by the law they're all governed of the devil that's what the Bible said Satan said they're mine I do with them whatever I want to said if you worship me I'll make you King like I am Jesus said it's written thou shall Worship the Lord thy God only shalt thou serve get thee behind me Satan why Jesus knew that he had fall air to them in this great Millennium when his kingdom had come thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven there will be no more sharks more there will be no more drinking there will be no more lust there will be no more adultery there will be no more death there will be no more sorrow Falls air to Every Nation they are his that's right they are his and he will fall air but Satan has them for a space of time that is the day that we're living you appreciate that I want to uh brother random said something that um let me see I highlighted it here brother Braham said this he said here it is he said Moses by faith saw the promise of God and the angel of the Lord came to him and he knew more about God in 5 minutes in the presence of that angel than he learned in 40 years with the teachers of Egypt that shows you how important an experience is when you truly have that experience with the Lord Jesus when your life truly that's when your life changes when you have that contact with that Holy Spirit there is something that changed and you could be in seminary for 20 years you could have a PhD and all the Theology and and everything that that you could have stud studied the Bible since you were born but if you come into the presence of God just one time everything will change and you'll know more from that one moment than all of the studying can ever give to you and I'm a witness to that let's all stand there oh I anchored my soul in the Haven
