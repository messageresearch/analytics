[53:00] you know brother Roger and Sister Laura
[53:01] have been have uh there at
[53:05] well they've been with us for
[53:08] since the early 80s that's right I was
[53:10] maybe about two or three years old when
[53:12] Sister Laura and brother Roger they they
[53:16] moved there to to Silver City
[53:18] and um we are we're we're so uh thankful
[53:23] that what God has done through them all
[53:26] these years and uh and what he is
[53:29] continuing to do amen I I had a um
[53:32] just a small thought this morning but
[53:35] I'm going to ask you to stand for the
[53:36] reading of the word
[53:37] and um
[53:42] you know
[53:46] we find ourselves in so many uh
[53:49] situations sometimes
[53:52] um and I found myself in many situations
[53:55] that
[53:57] that I that I looked at and I S and I
[54:02] finally realized those are self
[54:05] made
[54:07] situations
[54:09] wounds that are self-inflicted
[54:12] so many times we we uh we feel wow the
[54:15] devil's on my tail
[54:16] the devil's after me my goodness and no
[54:20] it's you know you you really have to
[54:22] look at yourself in the mirror and say
[54:23] man that is my that is my worst enemy
[54:27] right there
[54:28] that's that's my greatest enemy right
[54:30] there is I have to overcome William
[54:33] Bettis
[54:35] I don't know about you you guys might be
[54:38] different this morning than me but
[54:40] but this is what I have to overcome
[54:42] sometime
[54:44] but the word of the Lord says in the
[54:46] Book of Psalms
[54:47] chapter 27 verse 1.
[54:50] simply says the Lord is my light
[54:53] and my salvation
[54:56] Whom Shall I Fear
[54:59] that is the question
[55:01] the Lord is the strength of my life
[55:04] of whom shall I be afraid another
[55:07] question
[55:09] when the wicked even mine enemies and my
[55:12] foes Came Upon me to eat upon my flesh
[55:15] they stumbled and fell
[55:18] though an host shouldn't encamp against
[55:20] me my heart shall not fear
[55:23] the war should rise against me and this
[55:27] will I be confident
[55:29] one thing have I desired of the Lord
[55:32] that will I seek after that I may dwell
[55:36] in the house of the Lord all the days of
[55:38] my life to behold the beauty of the Lord
[55:41] and to inquire in his Temple
[55:44] for in the time of trouble
[55:46] he shall hide me in his Pavilion
[55:50] I don't know if any one of you can say
[55:52] um
[55:54] for in the time of trouble
[55:56] he shall hide me in his Pavilion
[55:58] in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he
[56:01] hide me He Shall Set me upon a rock
[56:05] amen let us pray

[56:10] your goodness we thank you for this day

[56:50] seated
[56:52] I bring greetings from our from our
[56:54] pastor brother Kayla Perez

[56:59] and my also my brother Tomas Perez Jr
[57:04] we uh they want us to greet you
[57:07] this morning and they send their love
[57:10] and we
[57:13] we uh we sure
[57:16] love the people here in Tucson
[57:18] Tabernacle we sure love our brothers and
[57:20] sisters here
[57:22] amen
[57:23] this uh this scripture the lord gave to
[57:26] me just maybe just a few minutes before
[57:28] I got up here
[57:29] I was uh
[57:31] I was talking with brother Aaron this
[57:33] morning
[57:34] he said just be yourself
[57:36] and um I thought I my thought changed
[57:41] just slightly after he told me that
[57:44] said just be yourself because
[57:48] when I was growing up
[57:51] this was the last place I wanted to be
[57:53] was behind a Pulpit
[57:57] I never I never grew up saying
[58:00] how I can't wait to be a preacher
[58:03] no
[58:05] I I grew up my my father was a was a
[58:09] pastor missionary for for over 50 years
[58:14] um the Lord sought it fit on the 8th of
[58:18] this month to take him home
[58:20] and we uh we had the privilege of of
[58:24] laying his body to rest this past
[58:26] Wednesday
[58:27] and
[58:28] what an example that he has laid in my
[58:33] life
[58:34] in lives of so many people
[58:36] and I was uh
[58:38] I was going back to what brother Aaron
[58:40] was saying I said you know
[58:43] I told my dad when I was young I said I
[58:45] don't want to be like you
[58:49] I don't I don't think I have that
[58:51] calling
[58:53] my brothers they were both pastors
[58:56] and everyone assumed well you're going
[58:58] to follow in the same in the same
[59:00] footsteps I said nope
[59:02] I said I'm happy I I started playing the
[59:06] uh I started playing the drums when I
[59:08] was seven years old in church I played
[59:10] different instruments in church and I
[59:12] said I am so happy doing this
[59:16] just stick me in the corner away from
[59:18] everybody and don't put me in front of
[59:20] people
[59:22] so As I Grew Older
[59:23] I um I developed when I was younger a
[59:27] problem stuttering
[59:30] so I said Lord well that's that just
[59:33] proves everything I can't even speak in
[59:36] public so so you so thank you Lord
[59:39] there's there's another excuse I have
[59:42] so as time progressed
[59:46] um I I felt that I felt that pool later
[59:49] on in life
[59:51] and my dad told me son
[59:54] you can't run away
[59:57] anymore
[59:59] you're done running I said well
[1:00:03] I said I I feel like Jonah you know you
[1:00:07] know what was interesting I was I was uh
[1:00:09] I was looking at the life of Jonah
[1:00:13] and how he was how he was running from
[1:00:17] what God was calling him for
[1:00:20] and this is how this is how far he he
[1:00:23] was running brother and
[1:00:25] I want to give you a little perspective
[1:00:27] of how far Jonah was running
[1:00:30] Joppa was on the Far Eastern side of the
[1:00:32] Mediterranean Sea
[1:00:34] tarsh's is on the western side of the
[1:00:37] coast of Spain bordering the Atlantic
[1:00:39] Ocean
[1:00:41] that is approximately approximately 2200
[1:00:45] miles
[1:00:46] that would be the distance from Atlanta
[1:00:48] to Los Angeles
[1:00:51] of how far Jonah was trying to run away
[1:00:56] imagine that in a small ship
[1:01:00] but imagine this now the distance from
[1:01:02] Joppa to Nineveh is approximately
[1:01:05] approximately 700 miles
[1:01:08] in essence Jonah ran as far away as he
[1:01:11] could
[1:01:12] in the opposite direction
[1:01:14] I found myself
[1:01:16] in that situation so many times trying
[1:01:20] to run away from what God had planned in
[1:01:24] my life
[1:01:26] I tried everything that I could as a
[1:01:29] human
[1:01:30] to distance myself from Ministry
[1:01:35] even though I loved coming to church
[1:01:39] I loved playing for the Lord
[1:01:42] worshiping the Lord I said that's that
[1:01:45] is going to be the Pinnacle of my life
[1:01:48] that's going to be the Apex that's
[1:01:51] exactly what I want to do is just be
[1:01:54] there to worship
[1:01:56] you know many times we do find ourselves
[1:02:00] struggling
[1:02:02] trying to find what our purpose in life
[1:02:04] is
[1:02:06] it's so it's so easy especially as young
[1:02:10] people
[1:02:11] and I've and I feel for our for our
[1:02:14] youth
[1:02:16] for our young people what
[1:02:19] situations that they go through each and
[1:02:22] every day
[1:02:24] and how much harder
[1:02:25] it is each generation that passes by it
[1:02:30] gets harder and it gets more difficult
[1:02:33] for them
[1:02:34] and you look and you see young people
[1:02:36] that are still serving God and you say
[1:02:39] wow
[1:02:41] to serve God as a young person in this
[1:02:43] age you say wow
[1:02:46] because you know that God truly is
[1:02:48] working in their lives and I see some
[1:02:51] young people this morning and I say wow
[1:02:54] God is working in lives
[1:02:56] God is still changing lives
[1:02:59] no matter how difficult the situation is
[1:03:02] he's still changing he's still calling
[1:03:05] he still wants you as his son and
[1:03:06] daughter
[1:03:08] you know and I I
[1:03:11] found myself
[1:03:15] trying to compare myself to an eagle
[1:03:20] thank you
[1:03:21] but really when I looked at how my
[1:03:24] spiritual life was
[1:03:26] it was not the life of an eagle
[1:03:31] amen we we have so many songs we have so
[1:03:34] many poems uh different things we have
[1:03:36] pictures of beagles and saying that's me
[1:03:40] and we and we get so pumped up we get so
[1:03:43] excited yes brother Branham talks about
[1:03:46] the eagle that's what I am
[1:03:48] but really when we look at ourselves
[1:03:52] who do we see
[1:03:54] what do we see
[1:03:56] and you know what I found myself looking
[1:03:58] at
[1:04:00] it's going to blow your mind I don't
[1:04:02] think you're all ready for it this
[1:04:03] morning
[1:04:04] it's the craziest thing
[1:04:07] I found myself like an ostrich
[1:04:16] I don't know if you ever heard a message
[1:04:17] about an ashes before
[1:04:21] but I found myself as an ostrich
[1:04:25] I looked at myself and I and I say wow
[1:04:29] I've got these
[1:04:31] beautiful wings I stretched I would
[1:04:34] stretch out
[1:04:35] look how beautiful my wings are
[1:04:38] I would flap them around I would say my
[1:04:41] goodness
[1:04:42] I look beautiful
[1:04:46] but as I looked in the heavens and I saw
[1:04:48] those around me flying
[1:04:51] how I wished
[1:04:53] I could fly with him
[1:04:56] and as I tried to to maybe
[1:05:00] flap my wings a little bit
[1:05:04] for some reason I couldn't get off the
[1:05:06] ground
[1:05:08] because an ostrich
[1:05:11] is not made for the air
[1:05:13] an eagles made for the air
[1:05:16] but a ostrich
[1:05:19] definitely is not made for the air
[1:05:23] you know when we when we uh
[1:05:27] when we see an ostrich
[1:05:30] you know in the in the Book of Job and
[1:05:33] what's amazing about the Book of Job is
[1:05:35] is God is uh in in
[1:05:39] in the uh if you want to turn it into
[1:05:42] the uh book of jobs it's chapter 38
[1:05:53] excuse me I'm sorry it's chapter 39.
[1:05:59] and we're going to start with verse 13.
[1:06:03] and it says gave us doubt the goodly
[1:06:05] wings unto the peacocks
[1:06:07] or wings and Feathers unto the ostrich
[1:06:12] which leaveth
[1:06:13] her eggs in the Earth
[1:06:16] and warmeth them in the dust
[1:06:19] and what's amazing about if you go and
[1:06:22] read this chapter of job 39
[1:06:25] God is asking job these questions about
[1:06:28] different animals
[1:06:31] and it's so amazing that thousands and
[1:06:34] thousands and thousands of years ago
[1:06:36] that this text was written
[1:06:39] scientists can go back and say
[1:06:41] how
[1:06:43] correct that is
[1:06:47] which leaveth her eggs in the earth and
[1:06:49] warmest them in dust
[1:06:52] and this is this is when you find
[1:06:54] yourself
[1:06:56] not caring about
[1:07:00] what you want in your life not caring
[1:07:04] about church not caring about your
[1:07:05] brother not caring about your sister
[1:07:09] you find yourself as the ostrich
[1:07:12] is when which excuse me verse 15 and
[1:07:16] forgetth that the foot may crush them
[1:07:22] or that the wild beast may break them
[1:07:26] she is hardened against her young ones
[1:07:30] as though they were not hers
[1:07:34] her labor is in vain without fear
[1:07:40] because God
[1:07:42] hath deprived her of wisdom
[1:07:47] neither hath he imparted to her
[1:07:50] understanding
[1:07:52] and when you take a look at this
[1:07:54] scripture God is trying to convey
[1:07:57] something to job
[1:07:59] he says you see these animals you see
[1:08:01] you see how I've made them I want you to
[1:08:05] take a good look I want you to realize
[1:08:08] what I do not want you to be
[1:08:13] many times we see scriptures of things
[1:08:15] that God wants us to reflect of things
[1:08:19] that God wants us to be but we see the
[1:08:23] scriptures and we see scriptures of what
[1:08:26] God does not want us to be like
[1:08:32] we see we want to be like Jesus
[1:08:36] oh how I long to be like him we sing the
[1:08:39] songs
[1:08:42] and I take a look at the mirror
[1:08:44] and I see myself
[1:08:46] I had seen my reflection I said that is
[1:08:49] not a reflection of Christ
[1:08:52] that is a reflection of William Bettis
[1:08:59] because when I looked around I I
[1:09:03] when you grow up as a as a pastor's son
[1:09:07] as a preacher's kid
[1:09:10] you develop complexes
[1:09:13] you develop uh you you sometimes develop
[1:09:18] develop bitterness
[1:09:20] towards the brothers and sisters
[1:09:22] that has nothing to do with you
[1:09:27] and you start
[1:09:29] and you start disliking people I don't
[1:09:31] don't want to say hating people that's
[1:09:33] that's that's that's harsh I I never did
[1:09:36] that but you you start disliking people
[1:09:40] and you start wishing wow
[1:09:44] why
[1:09:46] why can't they why can't they get it
[1:09:49] together
[1:09:51] why can't they just be good people
[1:09:55] quit fighting love each other
[1:09:58] and you have no problems
[1:10:01] and I I tried to figure that out as a
[1:10:05] child and I I just could not figure that
[1:10:07] out
[1:10:08] could not figure out why there was so
[1:10:10] many issues
[1:10:13] and when you try and figure things out
[1:10:14] as a child you start like I said to
[1:10:18] start developing complexes
[1:10:21] complexes and then you start developing
[1:10:24] bad feelings
[1:10:26] and then I started developing
[1:10:29] I didn't start liking people
[1:10:33] and I I saw myself in the mirror one
[1:10:37] time
[1:10:38] as I as I Grew Older
[1:10:41] I just said I I just I just don't want
[1:10:44] to be around these people I just I just
[1:10:46] I just uh I just
[1:10:50] just don't like the situation
[1:10:53] I looked at myself and I said wow
[1:10:58] I'm uh I'm a good person
[1:11:02] I don't cause too many problems
[1:11:07] I don't have too many issues
[1:11:09] I think I'm a better Christian than
[1:11:12] those people
[1:11:14] that have been in the message 30 40
[1:11:16] years that I didn't think gotten that
[1:11:19] that I didn't think had it together
[1:11:22] and I I started I started having uh bad
[1:11:26] feelings
[1:11:27] but I also started getting this
[1:11:29] superiority complex
[1:11:31] I started yeah look at me I wear a suit
[1:11:34] to church every day or every service I
[1:11:37] get up and I and I and I S and I sing
[1:11:40] and I and I and I play and I am a I am a
[1:11:45] good Christian I don't cause any
[1:11:47] problems I don't cause any issues look
[1:11:49] at me
[1:11:50] wow
[1:11:53] so one day I had a dispute
[1:11:57] with a with the brother
[1:11:59] and I said you know what
[1:12:01] I can't I can't forgive you for that
[1:12:03] there's
[1:12:05] what you've done what you've talked
[1:12:07] about what you did
[1:12:09] it's Unforgivable
[1:12:14] how can you even call yourself a
[1:12:16] Christian
[1:12:19] and and as I as I walked back I said I
[1:12:23] felt pretty good about it because I said
[1:12:25] you know what I stood my ground
[1:12:28] I said what I had to say
[1:12:30] I didn't mix words but I I
[1:12:34] I did it I stood up for what for what is
[1:12:37] right
[1:12:40] and when I and when I looked at myself
[1:12:46] I said
[1:12:48] it's pretty good
[1:12:51] but there was a time that I had to ask
[1:12:53] for forgiveness
[1:12:56] there was a time that I that I had said
[1:13:00] something bad about a brother
[1:13:05] and as I was contemplating on how to
[1:13:08] approach the situation
[1:13:12] I remember looking at myself my
[1:13:16] reflection
[1:13:18] and asking myself these questions
[1:13:23] have you ever lied
[1:13:26] I said yes I have
[1:13:29] you ever stolen
[1:13:32] yes I have
[1:13:34] you ever talked evil against a brother I
[1:13:37] said yes I have
[1:13:41] so
[1:13:43] why
[1:13:45] are you not
[1:13:47] forgiving a brother
[1:13:52] and why are you asking for forgiveness
[1:13:59] and I looked at myself and I said and
[1:14:01] these thoughts came just roaring in my
[1:14:04] mind
[1:14:05] I said if I'm if if I'm not able to give
[1:14:09] forgiveness
[1:14:12] how am I able to receive forgiveness
[1:14:18] and I remember the Lord as he came down
[1:14:21] he said first of all before you even
[1:14:25] asked for forgiveness she goes you make
[1:14:27] things right
[1:14:29] you get on your knees not on not just on
[1:14:33] your knees but you go to that person and
[1:14:35] you forgive them
[1:14:37] he said you want forgiveness in your
[1:14:39] life you want to be an eagle you can't
[1:14:41] be an eagle you can't even fly you can't
[1:14:44] even walk
[1:14:45] your EarthBound
[1:14:47] you're you're so Bound in Chains but
[1:14:51] you're not bound in the chains of Satan
[1:14:53] you're bound in the chains of William
[1:14:55] Bettis
[1:14:57] you're bound in chains that you have
[1:14:59] created for yourself
[1:15:04] and I said wow Lord
[1:15:07] all it takes is a moment
[1:15:10] to look at yourself in the eyes
[1:15:16] and then you and then you'll understand
[1:15:19] what it is
[1:15:21] to be forgiven
[1:15:23] you'll understand what it is
[1:15:26] when somebody speaks evil against you
[1:15:28] and save me and you tell them brother
[1:15:31] it's okay I forgive you it's all right
[1:15:34] but let's not do it again
[1:15:36] let's continue on
[1:15:39] so as I was reading about the ostrich
[1:15:45] I
[1:15:47] I took some things from from this from
[1:15:50] this passage
[1:15:53] and I said wow
[1:15:55] how the ostrich is so selfish
[1:16:00] many times we can't be selfish right
[1:16:04] only only William from New Mexico is
[1:16:07] selfish thank God nobody in here from
[1:16:09] Tucson is selfish praise the Lord for
[1:16:11] that we've come a long ways
[1:16:14] but so many times we
[1:16:16] we get so selfish of of of what God has
[1:16:20] given to us and so many times we keep it
[1:16:24] for ourselves
[1:16:26] now I know this message this morning is
[1:16:28] is is simple very simple but I want to
[1:16:33] make sure that this message this morning
[1:16:37] not it might not help just but one
[1:16:39] person this morning and that and praise
[1:16:41] God if it just helps one person
[1:16:44] but
[1:16:46] but as as the scripture is unfolding and
[1:16:49] it is telling us about this this ostrich
[1:16:53] it says the ostrich
[1:16:55] doesn't even give natural affection
[1:17:00] for her offspring
[1:17:03] and I'm and I say wow Lord
[1:17:06] how different
[1:17:09] that is from an eagle
[1:17:13] you know you see an eagle
[1:17:16] you'll never see a nest of an eagle on
[1:17:18] the ground like an ostrich
[1:17:22] you'll see the nest of an eagle way up
[1:17:25] high on the cliff
[1:17:28] you'll see where it's protected
[1:17:31] the ostrich doesn't care about
[1:17:33] protection for its eggs
[1:17:36] it doesn't care about
[1:17:39] its natural affection towards its eggs
[1:17:43] it just lays the eggs
[1:17:46] and goes on
[1:17:48] let the sun warm up the eggs let this
[1:17:52] let the let the dust cover the eggs
[1:17:56] who cares if if feet trample on these
[1:17:59] eggs it doesn't matter because I have no
[1:18:02] connection to the eggs anymore
[1:18:06] so many times when we see our brother
[1:18:08] and sister
[1:18:11] we're like the ostrich
[1:18:14] we might see our brother and sister go
[1:18:17] off they might not come to church
[1:18:19] anymore or they might even go to a
[1:18:21] different Church
[1:18:25] and you can say well
[1:18:27] since they don't come here anymore they
[1:18:29] don't go to to Williams church anymore
[1:18:31] well I don't have any affection for them
[1:18:34] anymore
[1:18:36] I don't have I don't have a sense of
[1:18:39] responsibility for them anymore they're
[1:18:41] going to do whatever they want so I'm
[1:18:42] going to do what I what I need to do and
[1:18:45] that's it
[1:18:46] and we get the ostrich mentality
[1:18:50] of not caring
[1:18:52] of not
[1:18:54] of not having that affection for our
[1:18:57] brothers and sisters
[1:18:59] how
[1:19:00] how important it is
[1:19:03] to love one another
[1:19:07] I mean it it's this is this is
[1:19:10] kindergarten first grade stuff
[1:19:12] but if we can't even do the very the
[1:19:16] very simple things in life
[1:19:19] how is God going to give us more
[1:19:22] responsibility in the greater things in
[1:19:25] life if he sees we can't even we can't
[1:19:28] even take care of our neighbor
[1:19:30] that we can't even take care of our
[1:19:32] brother
[1:19:33] take care of our sister
[1:19:35] how can he give us much more
[1:19:37] responsibility
[1:19:39] it's just like me in a business
[1:19:41] I ask God Lord bless my business
[1:19:46] Lord just may may just open up the
[1:19:51] windows of heaven and just ring down on
[1:19:55] us
[1:19:56] you know we live in a desert right I
[1:20:00] live in a desert right Tucson is in a
[1:20:02] desert
[1:20:03] you know what happens
[1:20:05] when you get an abundance of rain at one
[1:20:08] time
[1:20:11] everybody's well aware of that right
[1:20:13] we're in the desert we're not there in
[1:20:15] Florida or any place okay
[1:20:17] you know what happens when we get a
[1:20:19] bunch of rain
[1:20:20] we get destruction
[1:20:25] so basically
[1:20:28] if you don't have
[1:20:30] your stuff together
[1:20:35] God is not going to rain down on you
[1:20:37] with blessings
[1:20:39] because those blessings are going to
[1:20:41] destroy you
[1:20:44] they're going to bring bring destruction
[1:20:46] to your life
[1:20:48] so here am I Lord open up the windows
[1:20:53] just let your blessings fall upon my
[1:20:57] business fall upon my family
[1:21:00] and what does the Lord do
[1:21:02] he starts his Blessing he's like okay
[1:21:06] here you go
[1:21:11] wow that's all God had
[1:21:15] that's all God had was just a door
[1:21:18] but I I mean I I thought I was going to
[1:21:20] be at least at least driving a beamer by
[1:21:23] the end of the year
[1:21:25] still I'm in my 2013 Ford Ford Fusion
[1:21:29] it's 120 000 miles I'm gonna say Lord
[1:21:36] but that's the way he does things
[1:21:38] he says I can't take you to the heights
[1:21:40] if you if you're if you're just if you
[1:21:43] can't even handle the little the little
[1:21:46] thing that I'm that I'm that that I have
[1:21:49] given you
[1:21:51] if you can't even handle that and take
[1:21:54] care of that how do you expect more
[1:21:59] oh but he opens up that window and it
[1:22:01] starts or opens up that door
[1:22:04] and the blessings start flowing out
[1:22:06] little by little
[1:22:07] it's not what you wanted because God
[1:22:10] doesn't give you what you want
[1:22:13] because if we're given if God has given
[1:22:15] us what we wanted we'd be pretty messed
[1:22:17] up
[1:22:18] right
[1:22:20] Lord give me that uh give me that 10 000
[1:22:24] square foot mansion they're up they're
[1:22:26] up in the catalinas you know I I deserve
[1:22:29] that
[1:22:30] you know and when it comes time for
[1:22:33] property taxes when it comes time for
[1:22:35] for for heating and and cooling it it's
[1:22:37] like Lord I mean you blessed me and I
[1:22:40] can't even I can't even pay the the
[1:22:42] electricity on this place
[1:22:44] it's not going to bless you with that
[1:22:46] because he knows you can't
[1:22:47] he knows I can't handle that
[1:22:52] but what he gives to us
[1:22:54] what he shares with us
[1:22:57] that's so wonderful it's so great what
[1:22:59] God does for us and how thankful we are
[1:23:02] and what and what does he do it starts
[1:23:05] growing
[1:23:07] starts growing
[1:23:09] I'm not trying to teach a a Prosperity
[1:23:13] Gospel at all no it's not it's not what
[1:23:15] that's not what we're all about
[1:23:18] if God didn't do anything for me for the
[1:23:21] rest of my life it's already sufficient
[1:23:23] what he's done
[1:23:25] you got to look at God that way
[1:23:28] and and instead you're we're just like
[1:23:30] Lord give me this give me that give me
[1:23:31] this give me that give me that no he's
[1:23:34] he says I've already done enough isn't
[1:23:37] my grace sufficient for you
[1:23:39] isn't what I've done on the cross
[1:23:41] sufficient for you
[1:23:46] so I found myself as an ostrich
[1:23:51] trying to get up to the Heights
[1:23:56] when troubles came around
[1:24:00] when fear was around what did I do
[1:24:03] I ran
[1:24:07] I ran like the ostrich
[1:24:10] when trouble was near
[1:24:12] when I couldn't run
[1:24:15] I put my hand in shame
[1:24:19] I put my head in the floor
[1:24:21] but you know what's wrong with that
[1:24:24] so many times when we when we feel like
[1:24:28] we well I'm gonna just I'm gonna hide
[1:24:31] I'm gonna put my head in the dirt like
[1:24:34] like an ostrich and No One's Gonna find
[1:24:38] where I'm at
[1:24:41] you because you see in our minds
[1:24:44] it's like that that uh uh it's like that
[1:24:47] that saying out of sight out of mind
[1:24:50] right
[1:24:51] so if I turn my my back from a from a
[1:24:55] problem and and not look at it
[1:24:59] while it's not there
[1:25:02] it's what we have in our mentality right
[1:25:04] that's like the ostrich she's he's he's
[1:25:06] he's putting his head down
[1:25:10] thinking
[1:25:12] that all his problems all the fear
[1:25:16] all that all that what's coming against
[1:25:18] him if he puts his head down that it's
[1:25:21] just gonna vanish
[1:25:22] that it's just gonna go away
[1:25:25] and so many times we we
[1:25:28] I'm gonna say I I look at that
[1:25:33] and I see myself well if I wait five
[1:25:37] more days all this is gonna pass by okay
[1:25:40] so I'm not gonna I'm not gonna think
[1:25:41] about it
[1:25:43] I'm not going to deal with it
[1:25:46] I'm gonna just let it fly by
[1:25:50] well after five days
[1:25:52] your problem is still there and now it's
[1:25:54] worse
[1:25:57] so here's brother will the ostrich
[1:26:00] putting his head in the sand
[1:26:03] thinking that all his issues all his
[1:26:06] problems are just going to go away
[1:26:09] but you know the the issue with that
[1:26:13] people might not see your head
[1:26:16] but they see that gigantic body sticking
[1:26:19] out
[1:26:21] right
[1:26:22] they see that gigantic body sticking
[1:26:25] down they're like
[1:26:27] like what's his deal
[1:26:31] he's trying to hide are are you serious
[1:26:35] God's looking at you and he's like are
[1:26:37] you serious you're trying to hide you
[1:26:39] think you've you think you've hidden
[1:26:40] yourself from me I can see that gigantic
[1:26:43] body
[1:26:45] poking out are you serious
[1:26:50] and it's like wow wow Lord I'm just I'm
[1:26:53] just
[1:26:54] I'm just trying just to get away
[1:27:00] and he says haven't I shown you
[1:27:04] haven't I shown you that in the time of
[1:27:06] trouble where I would hide you
[1:27:10] where I would take you
[1:27:13] he says I I am I'm not taking you
[1:27:18] and laying you on the Earth
[1:27:21] I'm not taking you and laying you in a
[1:27:23] nest by a bush where anything can get a
[1:27:26] hold of you
[1:27:27] but where I'm taking you
[1:27:30] is to a place
[1:27:32] where nothing else
[1:27:35] where nothing else is going to harm you
[1:27:39] and when you look at that
[1:27:41] your mentality
[1:27:44] everything in your life starts to change
[1:27:53] you start looking at yourself
[1:27:55] instead of an ostrich
[1:27:59] you start looking at yourself
[1:28:01] as an ego
[1:28:04] job 39 again
[1:28:07] verse 27
[1:28:10] doth the eagle Mount up at thy command
[1:28:13] and make her nest on high
[1:28:17] she dwelleth and abideth on the Rock hmm
[1:28:22] upon the Crag of The Rock and the Strong
[1:28:24] place
[1:28:27] from thence
[1:28:28] she seeketh the prey
[1:28:30] and her eyes behold afar off
[1:28:35] her young ones also suck up blood
[1:28:38] and where the slain are there is she
[1:28:42] you know I I was uh
[1:28:45] I was trying to find a quote of brother
[1:28:47] Branham on an ostrich and I found one
[1:28:53] and it says
[1:28:54] as careless as the ostriches of her eggs
[1:28:59] excuse me
[1:29:00] and some of them remarks that
[1:29:04] how that the ostrich thinks he had hid
[1:29:07] himself
[1:29:09] now that's true when he sticks his head
[1:29:11] in the ground
[1:29:12] but the most of him is still is still
[1:29:15] looking out
[1:29:16] so that's about the way we do some time
[1:29:19] we try to hide our head behind something
[1:29:25] there's always
[1:29:27] maybe we're still showing you know
[1:29:30] he sees
[1:29:31] every bit of us you see
[1:29:35] you know as I as I as I Grew Older and I
[1:29:39] got into my teenage years
[1:29:43] I would see this and when
[1:29:46] and when brother Branham made this quote
[1:29:49] we try to hide our head behind something
[1:29:56] to me that something was religion
[1:30:01] I don't know about you this morning
[1:30:04] I would hide my head
[1:30:07] I wasn't a bad a bad child
[1:30:10] I didn't party
[1:30:12] I didn't drink
[1:30:14] I didn't smoke
[1:30:16] I didn't do drugs all of that
[1:30:19] all of that I didn't the stuff that I
[1:30:22] just mentioned I didn't do it because I
[1:30:24] I felt convicted I just thought it was
[1:30:27] disgusting
[1:30:28] that was my thing I I hated this the the
[1:30:31] smell of smoke I hated the smell of beer
[1:30:35] that's why I didn't do that stuff it was
[1:30:37] disgusting to me not because oh I'm a
[1:30:40] pastor's kid I'm convicted Lord no it
[1:30:43] wasn't that way at all
[1:30:46] but I hid
[1:30:48] myself
[1:30:50] behind religion
[1:30:53] I hid myself behind the fact that I was
[1:30:58] a pastor's son
[1:31:02] that's where I would hide myself
[1:31:08] this morning I want you to ask the
[1:31:10] question
[1:31:12] where am I hiding
[1:31:17] where are you hiding ask yourself the
[1:31:19] question where am I hiding
[1:31:24] are you hiding behind something
[1:31:29] or are you like the eagle
[1:31:31] hiding on something
[1:31:35] because what a difference that is
[1:31:38] when you are hidden
[1:31:40] when you hide yourself behind
[1:31:42] religion
[1:31:44] you hide your yourself behind that
[1:31:47] you're a good person
[1:31:49] and that's and that's and that's okay
[1:31:51] that to be a good person that's great
[1:31:53] there's a lot of people I encounter on a
[1:31:56] daily basis on a daily basis that I that
[1:32:00] I know
[1:32:02] I would say these people are the nicest
[1:32:04] people I've ever met these people are
[1:32:07] just are just so welcoming and they have
[1:32:09] never once in their life stepped into
[1:32:11] church
[1:32:14] they never once in their life
[1:32:16] had anything to do with God but yet they
[1:32:18] are the nicest people
[1:32:21] and many of you have met them
[1:32:24] many of you have met people like that
[1:32:27] and then you deal with some people in
[1:32:29] church and my gosh they're the rudest
[1:32:31] people I've ever met
[1:32:37] the brother knows what I'm going through
[1:32:39] you know what you know what I mean
[1:32:41] brother
[1:32:42] Amen to that
[1:32:47] and so were so we're hiding ourselves
[1:32:51] behind something
[1:32:53] always hiding
[1:32:55] waiting
[1:32:57] to make sure nobody sees what we're
[1:33:00] doing
[1:33:02] did I believe
[1:33:05] to a certain extent I believed
[1:33:07] I believe this message I believe there
[1:33:09] was a prophet I believe what God did for
[1:33:11] me what Jesus did for me on the cross
[1:33:15] there was one day
[1:33:18] there was there was a brother
[1:33:20] a very very close friend of my father
[1:33:23] because his name was brother Fabio
[1:33:24] Bernal from Bogota Colombia
[1:33:28] I must have been 16 17 years old
[1:33:31] he preached the message that just shook
[1:33:34] me to my core
[1:33:36] and his title of his message and his
[1:33:39] thought
[1:33:40] was close to the cross
[1:33:42] but far from the blood
[1:33:46] I found myself
[1:33:48] as I was playing in church
[1:33:53] close to the cross
[1:33:58] but that's all that I would see
[1:34:02] I would I would just see the cross
[1:34:05] thank you Lord cry some tears every now
[1:34:07] and then thank you God for what you did
[1:34:10] but yet I found myself so far
[1:34:14] from where God wanted me to be
[1:34:17] shook me to my core
[1:34:20] and I said wow
[1:34:22] how is that possible
[1:34:26] that I have been in church my entire
[1:34:29] life
[1:34:31] I never went to a bar I never went and
[1:34:34] did drugs I never went partying and and
[1:34:36] and and and did all these all these bad
[1:34:39] things
[1:34:42] how can I still be so far from God
[1:34:47] because it doesn't matter that you come
[1:34:49] to church you
[1:34:51] every single day
[1:34:53] you could be in church every single day
[1:34:55] and that just means that you have
[1:34:59] nothing else to do
[1:35:04] because you're not you're not coming for
[1:35:06] the right reasons you're just coming
[1:35:07] just to fill up just to fill a pew
[1:35:13] you're still far from God
[1:35:15] I said I'm not like those people out
[1:35:17] there look there's they're way further
[1:35:19] from God than I am
[1:35:22] and God will show me are you are you
[1:35:24] serious
[1:35:27] I said well it's the way God deals with
[1:35:29] me sometimes that's the way that I hear
[1:35:31] hear hear hear hear and speak to me
[1:35:33] sometimes is when he says are you
[1:35:35] serious
[1:35:39] are you are you really are you really
[1:35:42] trying
[1:35:45] everything that you're that you're doing
[1:35:47] everything that you're going through are
[1:35:48] are you just are you just trying to find
[1:35:51] a way out
[1:35:53] and I said Lord I I'm not I'm not bad
[1:35:59] and God says you're still far
[1:36:02] you're still far
[1:36:04] you're still an ostrich
[1:36:07] can't go up to the you can't go up to
[1:36:09] the cliffs yet
[1:36:11] you gotta you've got to make your way to
[1:36:13] the cliffs
[1:36:15] he says but I'm going to provide you
[1:36:17] away
[1:36:19] I remember I was I was I was I was I was
[1:36:23] 14 when my mother passed away
[1:36:26] and for many years I I
[1:36:29] I took it out on God I said God
[1:36:34] I said I can't believe that you would do
[1:36:36] something this to me
[1:36:38] I can't believe that you would that you
[1:36:40] would hurt me so bad
[1:36:43] and my my mother had she had uh she had
[1:36:47] cancer she had she had passed away from
[1:36:49] cancer
[1:36:51] um and she had it I was I was seven
[1:36:53] years old
[1:36:54] when when we when she first got
[1:36:56] diagnosed with cancer
[1:36:58] and I said Lord I said
[1:37:00] I said I see so many so many people that
[1:37:03] are being healed I see I see so many
[1:37:05] people that are that that that didn't
[1:37:09] even know you that that didn't even come
[1:37:11] to church and I I see I see them I see
[1:37:14] them being healed off the street
[1:37:16] you know I saw that so many times in the
[1:37:19] ministry of my father when I was a kid
[1:37:21] that he would just be be outside he
[1:37:25] would yeah we would leave a service he
[1:37:28] would go down the street many people
[1:37:30] would just follow him and he was there
[1:37:32] for hours just praying for people on the
[1:37:34] streets and Miracle after miracle that I
[1:37:37] saw and and and and I said Lord
[1:37:41] why aren't you doing that in my life
[1:37:45] you know years years past
[1:37:49] and the Lord revealed a scripture to me
[1:37:55] that I would that I'll never forget that
[1:37:57] and that I had read hundreds of times
[1:38:00] and it's about the it's about the Hebrew
[1:38:02] children
[1:38:04] and when the when the when the Hebrew
[1:38:08] children are talking to the king
[1:38:11] they said yes we know that
[1:38:13] that if we don't bow
[1:38:16] that you're going to throw us into this
[1:38:18] fiery furnace
[1:38:21] he says
[1:38:22] the Lord
[1:38:24] or he says our God is able to save us
[1:38:28] we believe that
[1:38:31] but even if he doesn't
[1:38:35] he's still the same
[1:38:38] so when I look at that that sign says
[1:38:41] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:38:43] and forever
[1:38:46] just because God does something for me
[1:38:48] doesn't make him greater
[1:38:50] just because God doesn't answer a prayer
[1:38:52] that you think should be answered it
[1:38:54] doesn't make him any less
[1:38:56] he's the same
[1:38:59] he doesn't he doesn't decrease
[1:39:02] or he doesn't increase because of what
[1:39:04] he's doing in your life
[1:39:06] he's the same
[1:39:10] when I read that scripture I said what
[1:39:12] faith that they had
[1:39:16] they said because they knew there was a
[1:39:18] possibility of death
[1:39:22] but they knew
[1:39:23] that there was a possibility of life as
[1:39:25] well
[1:39:27] and that they knew that either outcome
[1:39:30] was the same
[1:39:34] I'm going to say that to you one more
[1:39:36] time
[1:39:37] they knew that whatever outcome
[1:39:42] was at the end
[1:39:43] it had the same results
[1:39:48] because God Was the Same
[1:39:51] in their lives
[1:39:53] whether
[1:39:54] whether they died
[1:39:57] or whether they lived the results were
[1:40:00] the same
[1:40:03] and when I looked at that and I saw God
[1:40:07] in the scriptures
[1:40:10] speaking directly to my heart
[1:40:13] he said oh my goodness
[1:40:18] how
[1:40:21] how so many years I have wasted just
[1:40:24] just dwelling on my own self-pity
[1:40:30] not realizing
[1:40:32] yes the Lord took my mom
[1:40:36] but the Lord healed my mom
[1:40:41] and what greater thing to see
[1:40:44] and to understand
[1:40:47] is that when God takes someone
[1:40:49] what their what whatever physical
[1:40:52] ailment they went through
[1:40:55] God has healed them from that
[1:40:58] and when I begin to understand as a
[1:41:00] young man that is that is what God is
[1:41:03] doing
[1:41:05] I said okay Lord
[1:41:07] I'm ready to shed these ostrich
[1:41:11] wings
[1:41:13] I'm ready to get rid of these
[1:41:15] I'm ready to get rid of these wings
[1:41:19] I said Lord
[1:41:20] I'm ready to start flying he said well
[1:41:23] you can't fly yet
[1:41:25] you're just a little baby
[1:41:28] he says I'm I'm gonna I'm gonna show you
[1:41:31] how eagles take care of their babies
[1:41:35] he says when
[1:41:37] when they have the eggs they take them
[1:41:39] up into into a high place
[1:41:42] they build their nests high from
[1:41:44] everything from all the elements from
[1:41:46] any any predators
[1:41:48] and what they do is when as when is when
[1:41:51] the little the little eaglet starts
[1:41:54] coming out of its out of its shell
[1:41:58] the mother eagle
[1:42:00] start going and she'll start feeding him
[1:42:03] and as it grows
[1:42:05] and it's ready to take its flight
[1:42:08] the mother eel just doesn't throw
[1:42:11] This legal and out
[1:42:13] no
[1:42:14] she takes them on their on her back for
[1:42:16] a few test runs
[1:42:19] she says I want you to to fill the wind
[1:42:22] in your face
[1:42:25] I want you to I want you to experience
[1:42:27] how how the rain
[1:42:30] when it's coming down touches your beak
[1:42:34] I need you to experience that before I
[1:42:36] let you go
[1:42:40] and when you experience that
[1:42:44] when I experienced of what God has has
[1:42:47] for me
[1:42:49] then I realized okay
[1:42:52] it sure beats being on the ground
[1:42:56] because as as Malachi four five
[1:42:59] believers
[1:43:01] how many Malachi 4 5 believers do we
[1:43:03] have in here
[1:43:04] we have a few in here right
[1:43:07] we weren't made
[1:43:09] to be on the ground
[1:43:11] we were made to be up in the heavens
[1:43:14] to fly to fly in the heavens
[1:43:17] oh but when you're ready you might get
[1:43:20] nervous because that's your that's your
[1:43:24] that's your first flight your first solo
[1:43:28] flight
[1:43:29] you might get a little bit nervous
[1:43:33] but God says I'm I'm don't worry I'm
[1:43:35] right there
[1:43:37] you're gonna
[1:43:38] you're gonna get a little push
[1:43:40] you're going to be in the air
[1:43:43] he says but remember how you flapped
[1:43:45] those wings when you were when you were
[1:43:47] an ostrich and you thought you were so
[1:43:48] awesome
[1:43:50] but you couldn't you weren't going
[1:43:51] anywhere
[1:43:53] he says now you want to you want to do
[1:43:57] the same thing
[1:43:58] you want to start flapping those wings
[1:44:01] it's going to take you places
[1:44:04] it's going to take you to places that
[1:44:05] you've never even been before
[1:44:08] it's going to make it's going to make
[1:44:10] you look at your brother a little bit a
[1:44:12] little bit better
[1:44:14] why because you're not seeing your
[1:44:16] brother from a perspective of the ground
[1:44:19] you're seeing your brother in a
[1:44:20] different light your senior brother your
[1:44:22] brother from a different angle
[1:44:25] and when you see your brother and your
[1:44:27] sister from a different angle of what
[1:44:29] you used to see them before you start to
[1:44:31] appreciate
[1:44:33] what God is doing in their lives
[1:44:37] now I can understand brother Ed
[1:44:41] now I can understand brother Aaron
[1:44:44] what they've gone through
[1:44:47] not just from my perspective
[1:44:50] but when we look at somebody
[1:44:53] when we're up and up in the air
[1:44:56] we can look at them through God's eyes
[1:44:59] God's perspective and seeing okay
[1:45:02] man was I wrong about them
[1:45:04] man was I was I was I judging them so
[1:45:08] harshly so fiercely why was I even doing
[1:45:10] that
[1:45:12] what a what a great what a great man
[1:45:14] brother Ed is
[1:45:18] I never I
[1:45:21] know why because now we have a different
[1:45:23] mentality we have a different thought we
[1:45:25] have a different way to think we have a
[1:45:27] different way to view things
[1:45:29] not just in a natural sense but in a
[1:45:32] spiritual sense
[1:45:34] and when I
[1:45:36] when I was finally able to grasp that
[1:45:40] when I'm finally able
[1:45:42] to understand
[1:45:43] what God is doing and what the purpose
[1:45:46] of my life
[1:45:48] and what God wants me to do
[1:45:53] I finally realized
[1:45:57] of where I needed to be
[1:46:01] you know I I
[1:46:04] spoke in my father's service on Tuesday
[1:46:07] night
[1:46:09] and I spoke of a man
[1:46:12] that has so much love for his family
[1:46:14] so much love for his church
[1:46:17] so much love for his people
[1:46:22] and I was so grateful
[1:46:26] because
[1:46:29] when you see
[1:46:31] when you truly see the love
[1:46:33] that that someone
[1:46:36] genuinely shows you
[1:46:39] you're not seeing that person love you
[1:46:42] you're seeing the way that God loves you
[1:46:46] and that's what I was so grateful for
[1:46:49] is because in the beginning I didn't see
[1:46:51] it
[1:46:53] because I was trying to to view things
[1:46:55] in a natural way but when we really
[1:46:58] start looking at our our our brothers
[1:47:01] and and we start looking at each other
[1:47:03] and in in a different way in a different
[1:47:06] light
[1:47:07] you just see God all over them
[1:47:10] you see the love of God displayed from
[1:47:13] one human to another
[1:47:15] it's incredible what God can do
[1:47:19] just with you
[1:47:22] just as insignificant as you might think
[1:47:25] you are
[1:47:26] just as small as you might think you are
[1:47:29] this morning
[1:47:30] God doesn't see you that way
[1:47:33] God doesn't see you as nothing God
[1:47:35] doesn't see you as just just just
[1:47:38] uh just a blip on the radar no he sees
[1:47:41] you as his child he saw me as his child
[1:47:45] when I was unlovable
[1:47:48] when I was
[1:47:50] without hope without without without
[1:47:53] uh uh without a plan without without
[1:47:57] anything in my life
[1:48:00] he came down to me and he said you said
[1:48:04] that word you're supposed to be
[1:48:06] supposed to be up in the heavens with me
[1:48:08] and I thank God for that
[1:48:11] and I know that you this morning you do
[1:48:13] as well
[1:48:15] but this morning
[1:48:17] whatever your situation is
[1:48:20] whatever your condition is this morning
[1:48:23] God sees you
[1:48:26] there is not
[1:48:28] a place
[1:48:32] that God will not go
[1:48:35] to get you
[1:48:38] he sees you
[1:48:40] don't ever think for one minute
[1:48:43] that God doesn't see you
[1:48:47] he knows where you're at
[1:48:50] but he's waiting for something
[1:48:52] he's waiting for you to tell him Lord
[1:48:56] I need a change
[1:48:58] I need to change these wings
[1:49:01] I need to change my situation from being
[1:49:04] someone stuck on the ground
[1:49:08] to being in the heavens I'm going to ask
[1:49:10] you to stand this morning
[1:49:12] if you find yourself in that situation
[1:49:14] this morning
[1:49:16] even if you need
[1:49:19] just something
[1:49:21] just just a prayer this morning
