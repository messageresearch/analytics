[37:09] of the Earth shall awake
[37:11] some to everlasting life
[37:13] and some to shame
[37:15] and everlasting contempt

[37:30] righteousness as the Stars forever and

[39:19] my subject this morning I want to speak
[39:21] on influence
[39:23] and I know that it's a broad subject but
[39:25] I want to touch on some different things
[39:27] some different influences that we have
[39:29] in our lives
[39:30] and most of how we can be an influence
[39:32] on others so to start
[39:34] I want to read a few scriptures I'm
[39:36] going to go through them fast brother
[39:37] Jeremiah let's start with both with
[39:40] Proverbs chapter 12 verse 26.
[39:44] then I'm going to go to Proverbs 13 20
[39:46] Proverbs 22 24 Proverbs 27 First
[39:50] Corinthians 15 and Matthew 5 16.
[39:53] I'm not expecting you all to keep up
[39:55] with me
[39:57] thank the Lord for this thing up here
[39:58] and thank the Lord for for our brothers
[40:00] in the back
[40:01] Proverbs chapter 12 verse 26 it says
[40:04] this the righteous
[40:06] is more excellent than his neighbor the
[40:08] water that's a that's an Old English
[40:10] term the Modern English would be the
[40:12] righteous is a guide to his neighbor
[40:15] but the Way of the Wicked seduces them
[40:18] Proverbs Chapter 13 Verse 20. it says
[40:21] this
[40:22] he that walketh with wise men shall be
[40:25] wise but a companion a companion of
[40:28] fools shall be destroyed
[40:30] Proverbs chapter 22 verse 24.
[40:34] make no friendship with an angry man and
[40:36] with a furious man Thou shalt not go
[40:40] lest thou learn his ways
[40:43] and get a snare to thy soul
[40:47] Proverbs chapter 27 verse 17 it says
[40:50] this and I like this one iron sharpeneth
[40:53] iron
[40:54] so a man sharpeneth the consonant
[40:57] countenance of his friend
[40:59] First Corinthians chapter 15 verse 33.
[41:09] oh wait uh wait yeah I can just read it
[41:12] be not deceived evil communication
[41:16] corrupt good manners Modern English
[41:19] translation of that would be
[41:21] evil Communications corrupt good morals
[41:25] Matthew chapter 5 verse 16 says this let
[41:29] your light so shine before men that they
[41:32] may see your good works and glorify your
[41:34] father which is in heaven
[41:37] amen friends
[41:39] influences are all around us
[41:42] they're around us all the time
[41:45] and and we always think about our
[41:46] children we always think about ourselves
[41:48] and when we think about these influences
[41:50] that are on us but don't forget you're
[41:52] an influence
[41:54] you're an influence to whoever you're
[41:55] around
[41:57] I was um my son and I a couple years ago
[42:00] we were in Walmart and we were we're in
[42:03] the fishing section
[42:05] and I was looking at the the different
[42:07] uh lures and and stuff and uh my son
[42:11] who's a lot more observant than I am
[42:14] he noticed that there was this man this
[42:17] big man the big beard long hair he was
[42:21] in he was in like uh biker clothes and
[42:24] change you know how they they walk and
[42:27] they they make a noise when they walk
[42:28] because all the chains that are on them
[42:31] and
[42:32] he uh he looked like that typical biker
[42:35] and he would say I'd say he was in his
[42:37] 50s
[42:39] and I was I was looking at the fishing
[42:42] gear I was focused on that and Daniel
[42:44] said that he was down at the end of the
[42:46] aisle
[42:47] and he walked up behind me and he stood
[42:51] there
[42:52] and then he walked away
[42:55] and then
[42:57] he came back
[42:59] and then he walked up next to me and I
[43:02] was looking at the stuff and and he said
[43:04] he says you know the pumpkin seed color
[43:06] is good for bass
[43:08] he said he said they like that color
[43:11] and I said oh yeah I said I've used that
[43:13] and he said my wife just left me
[43:16] he said she took my my son she said he
[43:19] said I don't know what to do
[43:21] big tears in his eyes
[43:24] this big man you would never think
[43:27] that that big man the way he looked and
[43:30] and and all that was on him that he had
[43:33] a heart like that
[43:35] and I said I said well brother I said
[43:38] do you know the Lord Jesus
[43:41] and he said
[43:43] it's on my heart to know him he said but
[43:46] I don't know what to do he said he said
[43:48] I had some Jehovah Witnesses come by and
[43:50] the other day and I was thinking well
[43:51] I'll go with them
[43:52] and I said well no you know that's maybe
[43:54] not the best thing to do and and we
[43:57] talked about the Lord and and I talked
[43:59] to him about the blood of Christ and and
[44:01] how the Lord wants to fellowship with
[44:03] him and how the Lord sent him there to
[44:06] the Walmart that day
[44:08] so that I could be a witness to him
[44:11] and the man with big tears in his eyes
[44:15] and and he says I I got to know the Lord
[44:19] so we had a little prayer meeting at
[44:21] Walmart that day
[44:23] and it was just it was just precious to
[44:27] me
[44:28] but friends it broke my heart and this
[44:31] is this is a few years ago this is in
[44:32] Jeffersonville
[44:34] I didn't have a place to send him
[44:38] to church
[44:40] I didn't have a place that I felt
[44:42] comfortable sending him that he wouldn't
[44:44] get discouraged that would teach about
[44:46] Christ
[44:49] because so often they come people will
[44:51] come into a congregation and they don't
[44:54] even speak the same language as we speak
[44:57] we start talking about the seventh angel
[44:59] we started start talking about
[45:00] Revelation 10 and we started talking
[45:02] about these things and they come in and
[45:04] they say
[45:06] where's Jesus
[45:08] in all this
[45:09] I came to know Jesus
[45:13] and it just it broke my heart's friends
[45:15] and and I'll I'll tell you I know that
[45:18] we have a smaller congregation here and
[45:21] I just felt on my heart to maybe share a
[45:24] few things that are that are just deep
[45:25] in my heart
[45:27] you know I don't know if we're streaming
[45:28] I don't know if if we're recording and
[45:30] it's good if we are but
[45:32] um I was told that we probably wouldn't
[45:34] so I thought you know I'll just share a
[45:35] little bit deeper things in my heart
[45:37] today
[45:39] and I it is the desire of my heart and
[45:42] it has been my wife can testify for a
[45:44] long time
[45:46] that I could have a place
[45:48] that would
[45:49] people could come
[45:52] and that that I could Point people to
[45:56] and that that it would be a place that
[45:58] is just filled with love
[46:01] that preaches Jesus Christ and him
[46:04] crucified and that they could come in
[46:07] and they would be welcomed in The Sinner
[46:10] could come in
[46:11] The Sinner could come in and say I'm
[46:13] wrong and there wouldn't be no fingers
[46:16] pointed at him because let me tell you
[46:17] something we're all sinners
[46:19] none any worse than any other
[46:23] but come in and that biker the way that
[46:25] he looked and and somebody would look at
[46:28] him and say there's nothing to that man
[46:30] and who knows what his past was but he
[46:33] had a tender heart
[46:35] and I would love to have that it's been
[46:39] the desire of my heart for a long time
[46:43] and I think that the Lord may be moving
[46:47] that way around the world
[46:49] that we can
[46:51] set aside
[46:52] some of our doctrines I'm not talking
[46:54] about this church here I'm talking about
[46:55] around the world that we can set aside
[46:58] some of our doctrines and realize these
[47:01] things aren't that important
[47:04] you know when we we hear so much people
[47:07] get Revelations and they get Revelations
[47:10] of oh this is this is who brother
[47:12] Branham was and and it's and the seventh
[47:15] angel and Malachi 4 tie in this way and
[47:17] and oh and he had this Vision about the
[47:19] tent and this is how it's going to be in
[47:21] the third pole and the squeeze and all
[47:22] this how come that Revelation is never
[47:24] Jesus Christ died for my sins
[47:27] how come it's never God came down in
[47:30] human flesh and died for my sins
[47:33] because that's the revelation we should
[47:35] have
[47:36] and that's when you see the arms open
[47:40] and that's when you see sinners come to
[47:45] the altar remember Jesus
[47:47] he said he had a hundred sheep
[47:50] one left and was astray and he left
[47:54] those 99 to get to that one sheep
[47:57] and that should be our our Focus
[48:02] you know the ones that are
[48:04] saved and filled with the Holy Ghost
[48:06] they're not sick
[48:09] but there's others that are
[48:11] and that needs to be where we reach out
[48:15] and we're not trying
[48:17] to get someone to our way of thinking
[48:22] but get them to Christ and then they can
[48:25] have a relationship with him it's the
[48:27] most important thing man there's nothing
[48:29] more important than that if we know
[48:31] Christ and we're preaching Christ
[48:35] then
[48:37] all the other Revelations will come
[48:39] the first memory I have I mean I was I
[48:43] remember I couldn't even walk I remember
[48:44] pulling myself up and looking over a the
[48:49] big reel the real console players
[48:52] brother Joe I don't want to give away
[48:54] your age but you're about where I am you
[48:56] remember those remember the big reel to
[48:58] reel
[48:59] players and uh brother Wilson you do
[49:02] and I remember pulling up and looking
[49:05] over that and watching those tapes go
[49:08] around
[49:09] and hearing brother Branham preach and I
[49:12] remember thinking okay if this side gets
[49:14] small then then Daddy will come over and
[49:17] he'll flip it over and then when that
[49:19] side gets small we get to the end which
[49:20] is the prayer line I love that as just a
[49:23] little kid I loved it when when brother
[49:25] Brown was talking to the people it was
[49:27] it was such a blessing to me I liked
[49:29] that
[49:30] my point in saying that is this message
[49:33] is inside of me
[49:35] I mean whatever I preach it has
[49:38] influenced me
[49:40] and it's gonna come out I don't have to
[49:43] always make an effort to to get in the
[49:45] cookie cutter way of doing things
[49:48] and say okay you have to read this many
[49:50] quotes you have to read this many
[49:51] scriptures and do that no believe me
[49:53] what's inside of me is going to come out
[49:55] I brother Branham preached about um he
[49:58] prophesied about a squeeze that's coming
[50:01] and there's been so many different
[50:03] interpretations of what the squeeze is
[50:06] going to be
[50:07] you know but if you take sister Angela
[50:09] if you take a orange
[50:11] and you squeeze it what comes out
[50:14] orange juice
[50:16] and that's how you know what's inside of
[50:17] it so let me tell you friends when we
[50:19] get squeezed which is happening which is
[50:22] going to happen and if it's not
[50:23] happening now what's going to come out
[50:25] of us
[50:27] is it going to be love
[50:29] is it going to be compassion
[50:31] or is it going to be judgment is it
[50:34] going to be uh thinking about about
[50:37] ourselves
[50:39] when we get squeezed
[50:41] what's going to come out and it we are
[50:43] going to get squeezed believe me the
[50:45] prophet said we were and it's going to
[50:46] happen so
[50:49] when I when I'm ministering
[50:52] what's inside me my upbringing will come
[50:54] out
[50:55] and that's all of us we had my brother
[50:58] and I my brother Adam
[50:59] and I excuse me
[51:04] my brother Adam and I
[51:06] I've said this before we started a
[51:07] Ministry in the Inner City
[51:11] um of Jeffersonville
[51:12] and these are mostly
[51:15] um black kids that didn't have father
[51:18] figures in their lives and they needed
[51:21] something to to help to help them so we
[51:25] saw a need and our sons were boxing
[51:28] and we saw just the boxing gym that we
[51:30] had them in was so worldly it was just a
[51:33] terrible place to be and I didn't want
[51:34] my kid my son there my brother Adam
[51:37] didn't want his kids there so
[51:39] eventually
[51:41] one of the coaches approached Adam and
[51:43] me
[51:44] and he said hey your kids are really
[51:47] good
[51:48] and he said I want to start a gym
[51:52] and I want to start it with your three
[51:55] kids my son and Adam's two boys and then
[51:57] there was a professional heavyweight
[51:58] fighter that was that was really good
[52:01] and he says I want to start it with just
[52:03] those four
[52:04] and
[52:06] he says and I want to make it a Ministry
[52:11] and now you're speaking my language so
[52:13] so we got we got this together we
[52:15] started with four kids and we started
[52:16] having a Bible say he said well what
[52:18] should we do I said well let's just have
[52:19] a Bible study
[52:21] so we started getting together and
[52:23] started to grow
[52:24] it started to get bigger
[52:27] more people started to come we rented a
[52:30] building
[52:31] pretty soon the building was too small
[52:34] we we formed a 501c3 non-profit we made
[52:37] it a church
[52:39] the the not only were the boxers coming
[52:41] but they're moms and their dads started
[52:44] coming
[52:45] and it started to grow with just this
[52:47] little bible study
[52:49] it continued to grow
[52:51] and then recently
[52:54] a local church
[52:56] donated an eight hundred thousand dollar
[52:58] building
[53:00] and 250 000 cash to renovate it
[53:04] it just it just got bigger and bigger
[53:06] and bigger and testimony started to
[53:08] started to come in and these these
[53:10] churches saw how they would send their
[53:13] kids here
[53:15] in boxing I mean again think of probably
[53:17] a more worldly sport
[53:19] but they would find Christ in this place
[53:23] there was this one kid
[53:25] his name's Jacob Jacob is going deaf
[53:29] he's probably I don't know he's 10 or 11
[53:32] he's probably 11 or 12 years old
[53:35] and uh Jacob loved Bible study it wasn't
[53:40] a very good boxer but it didn't matter
[53:42] he just loved it when we would talk
[53:44] about the Lord so he would listen and I
[53:47] was teaching on Jesus and how Jesus
[53:51] would
[53:53] said it was better to give than to
[53:55] receive
[53:56] and then the coach his name's Jeremy the
[53:59] coach that um that kind of was the
[54:02] spearhead in all of this
[54:04] after I was finished he wanted to give a
[54:06] testimony he talked about a man
[54:09] a homeless man that he saw walking down
[54:12] the road and the guy only had one shoe
[54:15] so Jeremy stopped and if you knew this
[54:17] this brother he is first class man just
[54:19] he's tattooed from the top of his head
[54:21] to the bottom of his feet but he's got a
[54:24] good Soul right inside of there and
[54:27] he said that he stopped and he saw this
[54:30] man with one shoe and he said hey you
[54:32] know where's your shoe and he said well
[54:34] I lost it and he said you know what he
[54:36] had about the same size feet he took his
[54:38] shoes off and he gave it to the Man
[54:40] so you know it's just a nice little
[54:42] testimony so
[54:43] so Jacob hears this it influenced Jacob
[54:49] this this kid
[54:51] so Jacob
[54:53] he his mom
[54:55] is about this tall
[54:58] and about this wide
[55:01] and hair about as short as mine
[55:05] and no teeth
[55:07] and uh
[55:09] I don't know how to say it as Butch as
[55:11] you can be
[55:12] I mean if I don't know if everybody
[55:14] knows what that means but
[55:16] um well I'll figure it out
[55:19] um but
[55:21] but uh
[55:23] I mean rough looking woman
[55:25] and
[55:26] so Jacob he goes and he's and they're
[55:29] poor is dirt they don't have anything
[55:31] public housing and and not two nickels
[55:34] to rub together and and Jacob's out
[55:36] riding his bike and he sees this man
[55:39] sitting on the on the curb with no shoes
[55:42] on and bleeding
[55:45] and Jacob in his in his voice he doesn't
[55:47] talk really well because of his his ears
[55:49] and he says he comes up to he says what
[55:52] happened to you
[55:54] and he says well I got beat up he says
[55:56] where are your shoes
[55:58] and he says well they took them they
[56:00] beat me up and they took my shoes
[56:03] and Jacob says
[56:06] wait here you stay right here and you
[56:08] wait here
[56:09] Jacob takes all the money that he had
[56:12] he goes to the store
[56:14] he buys the guy a pair of shoes he buys
[56:17] him some clothes
[56:20] and he comes back and he gives him to
[56:23] this man sitting on the curb
[56:26] and he says I just want you to know
[56:29] he said God loves you
[56:32] and he said God cares about you
[56:35] this is an 11 year old kid
[56:39] I want you to know God loves you
[56:41] and he says this man on the street he
[56:43] says
[56:45] I don't know what to do
[56:47] and he says he says Jacob says this he
[56:50] says you just thank Jesus for this
[56:53] so Jacob he goes back home and he tells
[56:57] his mom
[56:58] remember they're poor
[57:01] and
[57:02] he says mom I did this and she says you
[57:05] took all of your money
[57:07] he says I did
[57:09] and his mom started thinking about it
[57:11] she wasn't happy with him so so his mom
[57:14] is back at the gym and and this is
[57:16] before I'm I'm scheduled to teach Bible
[57:19] study we have all these Fighters going
[57:20] everywhere you know everybody's boxing
[57:22] and doing their thing and I see this
[57:24] woman sitting there
[57:26] so I said
[57:27] I want to go talk to her so I went down
[57:30] and I sat down next to her and I I
[57:31] started talking with her and she gives
[57:33] me that testimony of Jacob
[57:36] and what he did
[57:37] and I said well she says I was mad at
[57:40] him I said well uh
[57:42] what do you think about it she says he's
[57:45] the best kid I could ever imagine
[57:47] she says I'd have never done anything
[57:49] like that my whole life
[57:51] and I said I said sister do you know the
[57:54] Lord Jesus
[57:56] she said well I come to your Bible study
[57:58] don't I I never would have thought
[58:01] never would have thought that she was
[58:03] actually interested
[58:05] but there she is sitting there taking in
[58:08] everything that we're talking about the
[58:10] Lord Jesus
[58:12] so Jacob starts witnessing to his mother
[58:18] and you know what that lady gave her
[58:22] heart to the Lord
[58:24] and she and Jacob went to that same
[58:27] church that that sponsored our our gym
[58:30] and got baptized
[58:32] and they even got baptized in the name
[58:34] of the Lord Jesus
[58:36] and even if they wouldn't have it would
[58:39] have been
[58:40] it would have been something that she
[58:42] did for the Lord and I think the Lord
[58:44] even the inner ignorance I think the
[58:45] Lord would have honored it but he
[58:47] honored it and did baptize her in the
[58:49] name of the Lord Jesus and I saw her the
[58:52] other day and Jacob still texts me every
[58:53] once in a while asked me questions about
[58:55] the Bible and the kid loves the Lord and
[58:58] that was probably four or five years ago
[59:00] that that happened to him but an
[59:02] influence
[59:04] so I'm we're teaching this Bible study
[59:07] and like I said the message that's
[59:09] inside of me it's going to come out
[59:12] what I've learned and that God sent this
[59:15] prophet and and that these wonderful
[59:18] things happened and that this book
[59:20] became not a history book but a living
[59:23] book
[59:24] that's in me
[59:26] so I never mentioned
[59:29] brother Branham it wasn't the place for
[59:32] it
[59:32] in teaching these kids
[59:34] the coach
[59:36] remember his name's Jeremy he's got a
[59:40] tattoo across his chest that says you
[59:43] can't judge me
[59:46] no no I'm sorry it says only God can
[59:49] judge me uh you know it's like
[59:52] I you know it's good so
[59:55] I'm teaching these Bible studies months
[59:59] go on
[1:00:00] my brother and I are doing this
[1:00:02] and uh
[1:00:03] Jeremy the coach
[1:00:06] I see him on his phone and he says hey
[1:00:08] check this out
[1:00:10] and he's on a group chat
[1:00:12] with coaches around the country
[1:00:15] at least 10. boxing coaches around the
[1:00:18] country well I remember I saw one of
[1:00:20] them was in Las Vegas I don't remember
[1:00:22] and there was one in Philadelphia but
[1:00:23] they are all around
[1:00:25] and you know what they were sending to
[1:00:27] each other
[1:00:28] they were sending quotes of brother
[1:00:30] Brown
[1:00:31] to each other
[1:00:33] and they're like man that guy he doesn't
[1:00:35] put any punches and they're sending them
[1:00:36] to each other and me never mentioning it
[1:00:40] and I asked Jeremy I said I said Jeremy
[1:00:43] uh
[1:00:45] you know what is this he says I love
[1:00:46] brother Brandon
[1:00:48] he says man he says he preaches it he
[1:00:50] says that man was a prophet of God
[1:00:53] I was salty Adam was salty and they got
[1:00:57] thirsty they wanted the same thing that
[1:00:59] we have
[1:01:00] and it and by the grace of God now my
[1:01:04] brother is it has continued to grow and
[1:01:06] he sends me every week he sends me a
[1:01:09] little video of the Bible study and
[1:01:10] there's probably 30 or 40 or more
[1:01:14] boxers there and they're everywhere from
[1:01:18] 12 years old all the way up to moms and
[1:01:21] dads loving the Lord
[1:01:24] influencing these people
[1:01:27] God blessed them and we have to make
[1:01:30] sure
[1:01:31] that we know
[1:01:33] everything that we say everything that
[1:01:36] we do
[1:01:37] is an influence on others and it could
[1:01:39] be good
[1:01:41] and it could be bad
[1:01:42] we have to watch it all the time
[1:01:46] it uh last time I ministered
[1:01:51] I can turn to Second Chronicles chapter
[1:01:53] six last time I ministered I talked
[1:01:56] about the Tabernacle that was in the
[1:01:58] wilderness
[1:02:00] and how this Tabernacle they would set
[1:02:02] it up it was a tense and there was there
[1:02:05] was the Holy place and then there was
[1:02:07] this place in the back of the Tabernacle
[1:02:10] that had a thick curtain of in front of
[1:02:13] it called the holy of holies
[1:02:15] and that Tabernacle eventually when they
[1:02:18] crossed over into the promised land
[1:02:21] years later there was a man named David
[1:02:24] who got inspired to take that Tabernacle
[1:02:27] that was mobile and make it a temple of
[1:02:31] worship make it God's house
[1:02:36] so David wanted to do it he had it on
[1:02:38] his heart he laid out all of the plans
[1:02:41] he wanted to build it and God said no
[1:02:44] you can't build it
[1:02:46] he said you can't build it because
[1:02:48] you've been a man of violence
[1:02:51] you fought battles and you've killed
[1:02:53] people he said
[1:02:55] but your son
[1:02:56] Solomon
[1:02:58] he can build the temple
[1:03:01] so David passed on he had all the plans
[1:03:05] there and Solomon took those plans that
[1:03:09] God had had given
[1:03:11] and he made it into the temple
[1:03:16] and it's famous
[1:03:18] is one of the most famous periods in
[1:03:21] fact they even judged the Bible by the
[1:03:23] temple period
[1:03:25] so they they date the Bible by the
[1:03:27] temple which Temple was this
[1:03:30] so Solomon it was seven years
[1:03:34] building this Temple
[1:03:36] it had to be perfect
[1:03:39] everything in it the gold and the and
[1:03:42] and the sensors the way that the priest
[1:03:44] would come in as I said before the the
[1:03:46] Aaron had two sons they had their
[1:03:49] sensors they had to put just the right
[1:03:50] kind of fire they had to walk into the
[1:03:52] holy the holies just perfectly they
[1:03:55] didn't I said as I said they took church
[1:03:57] for granted they came in with a bit of
[1:04:00] the wrong Spirit their little
[1:04:01] lackadaisically coming in and then God
[1:04:04] struck them dead good men
[1:04:07] God struck them dead
[1:04:09] he said grab them by the coat and pull
[1:04:11] them out
[1:04:13] it was a place of reverence it was a
[1:04:16] holy place
[1:04:18] consecrated place
[1:04:20] so then they build this Temple
[1:04:25] seven years as I said it was in the
[1:04:27] making
[1:04:28] excited everything
[1:04:31] had come together everything was
[1:04:33] finished
[1:04:35] but you can just build something with
[1:04:37] your hands
[1:04:39] and if God doesn't bless it it's not
[1:04:41] worth it then it's just for you
[1:04:44] so they were waiting on God to come down
[1:04:49] and dwell in this house that they had
[1:04:52] built him
[1:04:53] Solomon comes up before the people he
[1:04:56] built a platform a little bit higher
[1:04:58] than the people and he addressed the
[1:05:01] people and he prayed a prayer
[1:05:04] in second Chronicles chapter six and
[1:05:07] let's start with verse 19.
[1:05:11] Solomon says this
[1:05:14] and he's praying to God
[1:05:17] have respect therefore to the prayer of
[1:05:19] thy servant
[1:05:21] and to his supplication O Lord my God to
[1:05:24] hearken under the cry and the prayer
[1:05:25] which thy servant prayeth before thee
[1:05:28] that thine eyes may be opened to this
[1:05:30] house day and night upon the place
[1:05:32] whereof thou has said that thou would
[1:05:35] have put thy name there to hearken under
[1:05:37] the prayer which thy servant prayed
[1:05:40] toward this place
[1:05:42] hearken therefore unto the supplications
[1:05:44] of thy servant and of thy people is real
[1:05:48] which they shall make toward this place
[1:05:50] hear thou from thy Dwelling Place even
[1:05:53] from heaven and when thou heareth
[1:05:55] forgive
[1:05:57] look how important this Temple is
[1:06:00] if the people bow down and just face
[1:06:02] this building
[1:06:05] and God will hear their prayers
[1:06:08] if a man sinned against his neighbor and
[1:06:10] an oath be laid upon him to make him
[1:06:13] swear and the oath come before thy altar
[1:06:16] in this house then hear thou from heaven
[1:06:19] and do and judge thy servants by
[1:06:22] requiting the wicked by recompenting his
[1:06:24] way upon his own head and by justifying
[1:06:27] the righteous by giving him according to
[1:06:29] his righteousness and If thy People
[1:06:31] Israel be put to the worst before the
[1:06:32] enemy because they have sinned against
[1:06:34] thee and shall return and confess thy
[1:06:37] name and pray and make supplication
[1:06:40] before thee in this house
[1:06:44] then hear thou from heavens and forgive
[1:06:47] the sin of thy People Israel and bring
[1:06:50] them again into the land which thou gave
[1:06:52] us to them and to their fathers
[1:06:55] when the heaven is shut up and there is
[1:06:57] no rain because they have sinned against
[1:06:59] thee yet if they pray toward this place
[1:07:03] and confess thy name and turn from their
[1:07:05] sin when thou Dost afflict them then
[1:07:08] hear thou from heaven and forgive the
[1:07:10] sin of thy servants and of thy People
[1:07:13] Israel when thou has taught them the
[1:07:16] good way wherein they should walk and
[1:07:18] sin Reign upon thy land which thou Hast
[1:07:21] given unto thy people for an inheritance
[1:07:24] and Solomon goes on
[1:07:27] in his prayer before the Lord and before
[1:07:29] the people whatever sin they've
[1:07:31] committed
[1:07:32] whatever enemy is before them if they
[1:07:35] will just face this Temple and pray to
[1:07:37] God then God will step on the scene the
[1:07:39] temple is sacred before the Lord
[1:07:44] it's the most important place in the
[1:07:47] world back there
[1:07:50] if we go to Second Chronicles chapter
[1:07:51] seven
[1:07:53] so Solomon had finished praying and he
[1:07:56] he had respected this Temple he had made
[1:07:59] the Lord welcome
[1:08:02] and it says this
[1:08:04] is second Chronicles chapter 7 verse one
[1:08:07] now when Solomon had made an end of
[1:08:09] praying
[1:08:10] the fire came down from heaven and
[1:08:13] consumed the burnt offering and the
[1:08:14] sacrifices and the glory of the Lord
[1:08:16] filled the house and the priest could
[1:08:18] not enter into the house of the Lord
[1:08:19] because the glory of the Lord had filled
[1:08:22] the Lord's House
[1:08:23] and when all the children of Israel saw
[1:08:25] how the fire came down and the glory of
[1:08:27] the Lord upon the house they bowed
[1:08:29] themselves with their faces to the
[1:08:31] ground upon the pavement and worshiped
[1:08:34] and praised the Lord saying for he is
[1:08:37] good for his mercy endureth forever can
[1:08:41] you imagine being there when this
[1:08:45] happened
[1:08:46] can you imagine you worked on this
[1:08:48] Temple and here the temple come is and
[1:08:50] you're you're coming and you see Solomon
[1:08:52] pray and then
[1:08:55] get reverent and quiet and then the
[1:08:58] glory of the Lord comes down in Fire and
[1:09:02] consumes the offering I wish I could
[1:09:04] have been there
[1:09:06] oh I wish I could have seen something
[1:09:08] like that
[1:09:09] the power of God consuming the sacrifice
[1:09:15] and everybody saw it
[1:09:19] and they fell down on their faces with
[1:09:22] their faces on the pavement
[1:09:24] and even the ministers couldn't minister
[1:09:26] because the glory of the Lord was there
[1:09:29] can you imagine can you imagine seeing
[1:09:32] something like that
[1:09:34] I would have loved to have seen it
[1:09:38] to see how important that this was the
[1:09:42] reverence that was there the sacredness
[1:09:44] of that Temple and then could you
[1:09:46] imagine if somebody walked up
[1:09:49] to this Temple
[1:09:51] during this time
[1:09:53] pulled out
[1:09:55] a sledgehammer
[1:09:57] or a can of lighter fluid
[1:10:00] sprayed it on the temple
[1:10:02] or took a sledgehammer and was just
[1:10:04] ready to take a chunk out of it
[1:10:07] can you imagine what would you do if one
[1:10:09] of your friends went up to do that with
[1:10:11] the power of God here and the sacredness
[1:10:14] of this Temple
[1:10:16] they're like whoa whoa Whoa man don't
[1:10:17] what are you doing don't don't do that
[1:10:20] well I don't like the way the pillars
[1:10:21] are the pillars aren't exactly right and
[1:10:24] and these Stones how they're all placed
[1:10:26] they're not placed right they should
[1:10:27] have used Limestone and instead of
[1:10:29] ground they should have they should have
[1:10:31] changed the shape of the stones wait a
[1:10:33] minute that is God's Temple
[1:10:36] what are you doing he will strike you
[1:10:39] dead don't you remember Aaron's sons
[1:10:42] he's God
[1:10:44] don't touch that
[1:10:46] leave it alone
[1:10:48] be careful
[1:10:51] that is God's Temple
[1:10:54] it's sacred before God
[1:10:57] remember
[1:10:58] the god of the Old Testament brother Dan
[1:11:01] he's the god of the New Testament too
[1:11:03] and he said I am God and I change not
[1:11:07] he's the same God that something
[1:11:09] happened
[1:11:10] when he sent his son
[1:11:12] thank God for that
[1:11:15] but don't forget he's still the same God
[1:11:19] I'm building this up
[1:11:23] because I want to get
[1:11:24] to a scripture that brother Lyle spoke
[1:11:26] about last on Wednesday
[1:11:29] First Corinthians chapter 3.
[1:11:33] we we see this man
[1:11:36] this woman
[1:11:38] friend whoever it might be
[1:11:41] come to the temple spray
[1:11:44] lighter fluid on it
[1:11:46] maybe the light of match take a hammer
[1:11:49] to it say I hate it I don't want it
[1:11:54] think about what would have happened to
[1:11:55] that person what would you have done
[1:11:58] brother Joe if that was one of your
[1:11:59] children
[1:12:01] what would you have done if it was your
[1:12:02] friend
[1:12:03] what would you have done I've done
[1:12:05] everything I could to stop them don't do
[1:12:07] it
[1:12:08] don't touch that Temple it's sacred
[1:12:12] First Corinthians
[1:12:14] chapter 3 verse 9.
[1:12:17] that Temple is gone
[1:12:20] today
[1:12:21] there's the Temple mount the Muslim Dome
[1:12:24] of the Rock
[1:12:25] the Muslim Dome of the Rock sits there
[1:12:27] now in the place probably where
[1:12:29] Solomon's Temple was it was after
[1:12:32] Solomon came it fell into disrepair they
[1:12:35] fixed it up somebody Nebuchadnezzar came
[1:12:37] he tore it down
[1:12:39] they you know they tried to rebuild it
[1:12:41] again it was a building
[1:12:44] but as the glory of the Lord that made
[1:12:46] it important
[1:12:48] First Corinthians chapter 3 verse 9.
[1:12:51] for we are laborers together with God
[1:12:55] ye are God's husbandry ye are God's
[1:12:59] Building
[1:13:02] today that Temple is you and me
[1:13:06] it's alive
[1:13:08] it's Lively Stones it's not dead it's
[1:13:10] not it's not a bunch of rocks piled up
[1:13:12] making a building it's alive it's it's
[1:13:14] flesh and blood
[1:13:16] skip to verse 16.
[1:13:19] no ye not that ye you
[1:13:25] are the temple of God
[1:13:27] and that the spirit of God dwelleth in
[1:13:29] you
[1:13:31] read it again know ye not that ye are
[1:13:33] the temple of God and the spirit of God
[1:13:34] dwelleth in you something happened as I
[1:13:37] send this as I said the Son of God came
[1:13:39] he promised that this Same Spirit The
[1:13:42] Same Spirit that came down and burnt
[1:13:45] the sacrifice
[1:13:47] the temple the same God that came down
[1:13:50] in the pillar of Fire
[1:13:51] came down on 120 people in the upper
[1:13:54] room
[1:13:55] after Jesus said he had left and he said
[1:13:57] I will send my spirit
[1:14:00] and he did and then those people
[1:14:04] became that temple of God
[1:14:07] and that's what Paul here is referring
[1:14:09] to let's continue on
[1:14:13] If any man
[1:14:15] defile the temple of God
[1:14:17] him shall God destroy
[1:14:22] for the temple of God is Holy
[1:14:24] which Temple ye are
[1:14:30] you say it again
[1:14:32] for the temple of God is Holy which
[1:14:33] Temple ye are
[1:14:37] first Peter
[1:14:39] chapter 2 it says that we are those
[1:14:42] stones
[1:14:45] those living stones that that make the
[1:14:47] temple and Jesus himself is the
[1:14:49] Cornerstone
[1:14:51] he's the one that you start at
[1:14:53] and then you build up this Temple
[1:14:58] and Paul goes on Paul says he says
[1:15:00] you're the temple of God
[1:15:02] and that God's spirit dwells in you
[1:15:05] and he says that if anyone defiles that
[1:15:08] Temple
[1:15:09] then God will destroy
[1:15:12] that math
[1:15:13] remember Aaron's sons
[1:15:16] remember the guy that goes up that I
[1:15:18] made up the guy that goes up with the
[1:15:19] hammer and he's going to hit the stone
[1:15:21] in the temple
[1:15:23] he's going to desecrate that Temple
[1:15:25] remember that guy
[1:15:26] I don't want to be that guy
[1:15:32] you know
[1:15:33] we think about
[1:15:37] that we
[1:15:39] are that Temple and if we if what I've
[1:15:41] read is true
[1:15:44] and what Paul said is true which it is
[1:15:47] that we are that temple of God then
[1:15:51] friends how careful should we be in
[1:15:55] speaking against each other
[1:15:59] are you with me
[1:16:01] how careful should we be in saying one
[1:16:04] word
[1:16:06] against that temple of God no matter how
[1:16:09] much we don't think that they're right
[1:16:12] or like the guy that uh wanted to hurt
[1:16:15] that wanted to break down the temple
[1:16:17] it's not built the way I think it should
[1:16:19] be built
[1:16:21] they don't believe the way that I think
[1:16:22] they should believe
[1:16:25] and we go and we attack that
[1:16:29] we come against it
[1:16:31] and we speak against it
[1:16:35] and I think Lord
[1:16:37] why am I not dead
[1:16:40] me Daniel Evans why am I still breathing
[1:16:45] how am I still alive
[1:16:48] when I see Aaron's sons they just made a
[1:16:51] little mistake
[1:16:52] and how much have I done why aren't
[1:16:54] there dead people all over the place
[1:16:59] blood of Christ
[1:17:00] has stayed God's Wrath
[1:17:03] but friends we have to get there
[1:17:07] and I've always wondered Lord how can we
[1:17:09] you know I talked about a place to go to
[1:17:11] church I've wondered Lord how can we get
[1:17:14] there I want a church that has miracles
[1:17:18] I want a church where the sinner can
[1:17:20] come to the altar
[1:17:21] I want a church that's just so filled
[1:17:23] with love even it's five people
[1:17:26] I want to have that I want that and I
[1:17:29] thought Lord how can that ever be and I
[1:17:31] thought for years Lord how could that
[1:17:34] ever be but now I see you know what it
[1:17:36] can be
[1:17:37] it can be if the fear of God would be in
[1:17:41] our hearts
[1:17:43] not just not just wanting to do right
[1:17:47] but fear God
[1:17:49] to say that if we destroy that temple of
[1:17:53] God if we destroy that person if we
[1:17:55] speak against him God it's a promise God
[1:17:57] will destroy us
[1:17:59] how careful we should be
[1:18:02] let's turn to Titus
[1:18:08] there's a there's a place in numbers
[1:18:11] and I wanted to preach on today I was
[1:18:13] reading Stephanie and I were reading it
[1:18:15] yesterday man it was It was a serious
[1:18:19] altercation between Moses
[1:18:21] and Cora and dathan and it was an
[1:18:26] intense
[1:18:27] it was an intense conflict I don't have
[1:18:30] time maybe I'll do it maybe next week
[1:18:32] I'll talk about that but in saying that
[1:18:36] Cora and dathan and these ones that were
[1:18:38] Moses with Moses they influenced others
[1:18:42] against the servant of the Lord they
[1:18:44] were the ones that were the aggressors
[1:18:47] Moses was like hey don't do that
[1:18:50] just believe God they were the ones
[1:18:52] attacking
[1:18:53] all the time
[1:18:55] and I'll tell you next time I preach
[1:18:57] what happens to them and it wasn't good
[1:19:01] Titus
[1:19:02] chapter 3.
[1:19:08] this is a faithful saying
[1:19:11] and these things
[1:19:12] I will that thou affirm constantly
[1:19:16] that they which have believed in God
[1:19:18] might be careful
[1:19:20] to maintain good works
[1:19:23] these things are good and profitable
[1:19:25] unto men
[1:19:27] but avoid foolish questions and
[1:19:30] genealogies and contentions and
[1:19:32] strivings about the law for their
[1:19:34] unprofitable and vain
[1:19:38] a man that is a heretic
[1:19:41] after the first and second admission
[1:19:44] admonishment admonition reject
[1:19:49] let me read
[1:19:50] the English Standard Version of that
[1:19:53] says this remember the King James
[1:19:56] version I love it it's the absolute for
[1:19:58] me
[1:19:59] it's it's so inspired but English has
[1:20:02] changed over the God's word doesn't
[1:20:04] change but English has changed over the
[1:20:06] past 300 years
[1:20:08] it says this verse 9 but avoid foolish
[1:20:10] controversies and genealogies
[1:20:12] dissensions and quarrels about the law
[1:20:14] for they are unprofitable and worthless
[1:20:15] as a person as for a person who stirs up
[1:20:18] division
[1:20:20] after warning him once and then twice
[1:20:24] have nothing more to do with him
[1:20:29] stirring up division
[1:20:31] it doesn't say that about homosexuality
[1:20:34] it doesn't say that about murder
[1:20:37] it doesn't say that about about
[1:20:39] fornication it doesn't say that about
[1:20:42] these dark sins that we think are so
[1:20:43] dark it says that person
[1:20:46] that stirs up division
[1:20:49] worn them twice
[1:20:51] and then cut them off
[1:20:53] this is New Testament
[1:20:57] that's how careful we should be
[1:20:59] so careful we should be in about
[1:21:01] speaking about each other
[1:21:03] we should love one another
[1:21:05] go to battle
[1:21:07] for one another
[1:21:09] scares me to death
[1:21:11] you know
[1:21:13] I think about I read I've read these
[1:21:15] scriptures
[1:21:16] I was like Lord I'm guilty
[1:21:20] I am guilty I don't be guilty anymore
[1:21:23] no more Lord forgive me for for anything
[1:21:26] that I've said I didn't know now I know
[1:21:30] I don't want any anything coming out of
[1:21:32] my mouth against anybody
[1:21:35] be careful
[1:21:37] remember what I said the god of the Old
[1:21:39] Testament is the same God that when we
[1:21:43] sing Amazing Grace and we're raising our
[1:21:44] hands he's the same one
[1:21:46] he hasn't changed
[1:21:48] he was a loving God before he's loving
[1:21:51] God now he was a god of judgment before
[1:21:53] he's a god of judgment now
[1:21:58] be careful
[1:22:00] negativity
[1:22:02] negativity spreads and it does damage
[1:22:07] every word that we say should come
[1:22:11] through the Holy Spirit filter
[1:22:14] love one another
[1:22:16] and never say a bad word about anyone
[1:22:20] I don't think that our church
[1:22:21] necessarily has a problem with that
[1:22:23] that's not why I'm saying that about
[1:22:25] this Tabernacle
[1:22:27] um itself but the world has a problem
[1:22:31] with it
[1:22:32] therefore we have an issue with it it's
[1:22:35] everywhere
[1:22:36] and we need to be careful we look so
[1:22:39] often
[1:22:40] there's some people that are easy to
[1:22:42] attack
[1:22:44] like our president
[1:22:47] you know and it's aggravating the things
[1:22:49] that are doing we see this country we
[1:22:51] see this country just going off a cliff
[1:22:53] because of these policies but yet be
[1:22:56] careful even speaking against him
[1:22:59] we should watch our tongue
[1:23:02] be careful talking against them ain't
[1:23:04] going to do any good
[1:23:06] but it could hurt us
[1:23:08] you know you say
[1:23:10] brother Daniel
[1:23:11] um
[1:23:12] you know God's Gonna
[1:23:14] God's Gonna destroy me for for something
[1:23:17] that that's not even that important
[1:23:19] if it's not that important then don't
[1:23:21] say it
[1:23:22] you're with me
[1:23:24] it's not it's it's more important that
[1:23:26] we're right with God
[1:23:28] amen yes
[1:23:32] speaking about these things in Jude
[1:23:35] verse 8
[1:23:37] says this
[1:23:40] likewise also these filthy dreamers
[1:23:43] defile the flesh despise Dominion speak
[1:23:46] evil of dignities Yet Michael the
[1:23:49] Archangel
[1:23:50] when contending with the devil he
[1:23:53] disputed about the body of Moses does
[1:23:55] not bring against him a really railing
[1:23:58] accusation but said the Lord rebuked
[1:24:00] thee
[1:24:02] but these speak evil of those things
[1:24:04] which they know not
[1:24:06] but what they know naturally as brute
[1:24:09] beasts in those things they corrupt
[1:24:11] themselves
[1:24:13] woe unto them
[1:24:15] for they have gone the way of Cain
[1:24:17] and ran greedily after the error of
[1:24:20] Balaam for reward
[1:24:22] and perished in the gain sayings of
[1:24:25] Korah
[1:24:26] you know the most evil King I can think
[1:24:28] of in the Bible there's a lot of bad
[1:24:30] ones but one of the worst was
[1:24:32] Nebuchadnezzar
[1:24:34] that guy he was a killer
[1:24:37] he came in he's the one that destroyed
[1:24:40] that Temple that I was talking about
[1:24:42] before the natural Temple
[1:24:45] came in he gouged the eyes out of the
[1:24:47] king's Sons
[1:24:49] and then or the king I mean killed his
[1:24:52] sons in front of him
[1:24:54] awful awful person
[1:24:56] but yet this Bible
[1:24:58] when God was speaking about
[1:25:00] Nebuchadnezzar says the strangest thing
[1:25:03] brother Wilson it says my servant
[1:25:05] Nebuchadnezzar
[1:25:08] wow
[1:25:09] we've got to be careful
[1:25:11] be careful when we speak
[1:25:13] even against
[1:25:16] Joe Biden or Donald Trump or or whoever
[1:25:19] it is
[1:25:20] we
[1:25:22] have raised the bar
[1:25:25] and one day Jesus Christ will return for
[1:25:30] a bride
[1:25:32] he will return and what will that bride
[1:25:36] be acting like
[1:25:38] that bride will be this book in flesh
[1:25:42] that bride if it says walk this line she
[1:25:46] walks that line
[1:25:47] you know um I mentioned the saying the
[1:25:51] other day aim small Miss small
[1:25:54] she's going to be aiming small
[1:25:56] so when we miss
[1:25:57] it's all right we'll get back on we'll
[1:25:59] get back on the on the trail we'll get
[1:26:02] back on the target
[1:26:03] but that bride when God when Jesus
[1:26:05] returns
[1:26:07] she's going to be walking the walk she's
[1:26:09] going to be talking The Talk
[1:26:13] second Peter
[1:26:15] chapter 9. I'm chapter two I'm sorry
[1:26:20] verse 9.
[1:26:25] the Lord knoweth how to deliver The
[1:26:27] Godly out of Temptations
[1:26:29] and to reserve the unjust unto the day
[1:26:32] of judgment to be punished
[1:26:34] but chiefly them that walk after the
[1:26:37] Flesh and the lust of uncleanness
[1:26:39] and despise government presumptuous are
[1:26:42] they self-willed they are not afraid to
[1:26:45] speak evil of dignities whereas Angels
[1:26:48] which are greater in power and might
[1:26:50] bring not railing accusations
[1:26:52] accusations against them before the Lord
[1:26:55] wow
[1:26:57] even the angels they're not talking
[1:26:59] about about their enemies they're not
[1:27:01] talking bad about them
[1:27:04] but these As Natural brute beasts made
[1:27:07] to be taken and destroyed speak evil of
[1:27:10] things that they understand not
[1:27:12] and shall utterly perish in their own
[1:27:14] corruption
[1:27:15] and shall receive the reward of
[1:27:17] unrighteousness
[1:27:19] as they that counted pleasure to Riot in
[1:27:22] the daytime
[1:27:23] spots they are and blemishes supporting
[1:27:26] themselves with their own deceivings
[1:27:28] while they Feast with you
[1:27:32] right in Among Us
[1:27:36] communion table maybe
[1:27:39] Fellowship
[1:27:40] friends
[1:27:42] they're right here
[1:27:44] and I don't want to be that
[1:27:47] I don't want to be one of those negative
[1:27:49] people
[1:27:50] you know I've I've done it like I said
[1:27:53] I shouldn't be alive
[1:27:55] today
[1:27:57] I should not be here if if God judged me
[1:28:01] which he will
[1:28:03] only by the grace of God and the blood
[1:28:05] of Jesus Christ in my life today
[1:28:08] but I thank God for his son I thank God
[1:28:11] for Jesus I thank God that that he sent
[1:28:14] somebody to bring this scripture alive
[1:28:17] in this day
[1:28:19] a man that loved the Lord
[1:28:21] and people would come
[1:28:24] to the platform
[1:28:26] sick and be healed
[1:28:29] because he believed
[1:28:31] he was an example to us
[1:28:35] but let me tell you something the man
[1:28:38] I'm speaking about is William Branham
[1:28:40] you know what he preached
[1:28:42] Jesus
[1:28:44] he please you've tried to find me a
[1:28:46] taper he tried to find me a page
[1:28:49] that he didn't he didn't preach the Lord
[1:28:50] Jesus you can't find it
[1:28:52] it's because he is the one
[1:28:55] Jesus Christ is the one and Lord let me
[1:28:58] stand for him
[1:28:59] that's the bridegroom that's the one I'm
[1:29:02] loyal to
[1:29:03] I love him so much and I thank him Lord
[1:29:07] I see you in this Old Testament and it
[1:29:09] scares the liver out of me
[1:29:11] it does I mean I'm it scares me to death
[1:29:16] and in the New Testament goes and says
[1:29:19] the same thing
[1:29:21] by the grace of God
[1:29:23] thank you Lord
[1:29:25] I'm one of your people I'm one of your
[1:29:28] servants
[1:29:29] I read it here I'm going to do it I'll
[1:29:32] fail
[1:29:34] I don't want to jinx myself but
[1:29:36] I'm a human I'm a fail
[1:29:40] but I'm going to try
[1:29:42] I'm going to do a better job
[1:29:45] I am
[1:29:48] thank God
[1:29:49] you know I
[1:29:52] I don't know if we're
[1:29:55] recording or not but uh like I said I
[1:29:58] want to just make it a little bit more
[1:30:00] personal
[1:30:01] is
[1:30:03] I left
[1:30:05] voice of God Recordings
[1:30:07] because they didn't agree
[1:30:09] but let me tell you something
[1:30:11] there's two sides
[1:30:14] no matter how thin you slice it there's
[1:30:17] always two sides
[1:30:19] and with with Brother Joseph Branham and
[1:30:22] I love him and and I don't agree with
[1:30:25] him
[1:30:26] but
[1:30:28] but
[1:30:29] there's two sides he may be on this side
[1:30:32] I'm on that side but we're the same
[1:30:33] piece of bread
[1:30:35] and we love the same Lord Jesus I will
[1:30:38] never and you never heard me and nor
[1:30:40] will you ever hear me say anything
[1:30:42] negative
[1:30:43] about where I come from because
[1:30:46] it's been a it's been a blessing to me
[1:30:48] and I'm for these men of God you'll
[1:30:51] never hear me speak about
[1:30:53] a negative word about brother Donnie
[1:30:55] Reagan or brother Eddie Biscoe or any of
[1:30:57] these Great Men of God even though I
[1:30:59] don't know but even though I may not
[1:31:01] agree with him like I don't know if I do
[1:31:02] or not I don't know them all enough
[1:31:05] but even if I do
[1:31:07] doesn't matter
[1:31:08] like I said we're the same piece of
[1:31:10] bread
[1:31:12] we love the same Lord Jesus
[1:31:16] and then this
[1:31:18] body this body is God's Temple I know
[1:31:22] he's got my back
[1:31:24] he does he says whoever comes against
[1:31:26] you all destroy
[1:31:28] he's got my back but I also remember
[1:31:30] that he's got your back too
[1:31:33] and I don't ever want to be guilty of
[1:31:36] saying anything
[1:31:37] against anyone amen don't you love our
[1:31:41] lord Jesus
[1:31:42] don't you love how good he is
[1:31:44] his mercies
[1:31:46] that Temple that came down that Temple
[1:31:50] that was built seven years in the making
[1:31:52] how perfect he was and then God came
[1:31:54] down and oh I would have loved to been
[1:31:57] there but I'm here today
[1:32:01] and I get to be that Temple
[1:32:03] and I want to take care of it
[1:32:05] I want to make sure that it's not the
[1:32:07] filed I want to make sure that I am
[1:32:10] living for the Lord
[1:32:12] I'm going to end a little bit early I
[1:32:14] have a lot more notes
[1:32:16] I think that's enough
[1:32:18] you know I
[1:32:20] I'm just
[1:32:21] I'm grateful sister hope I don't know
[1:32:23] where you are if you could if you could
[1:32:24] come to the piano there you are
[1:32:27] um
[1:32:29] I'm grateful
[1:32:30] I'm grateful for each one of you
[1:32:33] you know I look and each one of us is a
[1:32:37] stone in that Temple and every one of
[1:32:40] them is different
[1:32:42] but am I going to look at this Stone
[1:32:44] over here because it's a different shape
[1:32:46] than me or it has a different
[1:32:47] perspective that me I may be on this
[1:32:50] side of the corner it may be on that
[1:32:51] side of the corner it may be looking
[1:32:52] East I may be looking South
[1:32:56] but it's still a stone in the temple and
[1:32:59] I'm no more important than that stone
[1:33:02] a one stone that's important is that
[1:33:04] Cornerstone
[1:33:05] and that's the Lord Jesus
[1:33:07] and friends with the love
[1:33:10] that our God has for us
[1:33:14] it's the same love that needs to come
[1:33:17] out of us
[1:33:20] and I want to think all of us to think
[1:33:24] Lord I want to serve you better
[1:33:26] I want to be a better Christian
[1:33:28] I want to be better
[1:33:30] and as I'm as I'm speaking if you're
[1:33:32] thinking about
[1:33:34] all the people
[1:33:37] that have done you wrong and you are
[1:33:39] that stone
[1:33:42] and you know God has your back you're
[1:33:43] wrong in thinking that
[1:33:45] what you should be thinking about
[1:33:48] is what you have said about others
[1:33:50] and you should have that repentive
[1:33:52] sweetheart
[1:33:54] and say Lord forgive me for that I want
[1:33:57] to do better
[1:33:58] I want to be
[1:34:00] what this word
[1:34:03] wants me to be
[1:34:05] amen
[1:34:06] you raise your hand if you want to be
[1:34:08] that I want to be it with all my heart
[1:34:12] I'll close with something
[1:34:15] I've talked a little bit about brother
[1:34:17] Branham I want to close with something
[1:34:19] that he said
[1:34:21] says this
[1:34:23] oh how wonderful how glorious
[1:34:26] I know that he's present
[1:34:29] oh I wished you felt like I do I know
[1:34:33] you think I may look silly but I'm not
[1:34:36] you may think that I don't know where I
[1:34:39] am but I do
[1:34:40] oh it is the spirit of the Living God
[1:34:44] I just can't preach no more there's
[1:34:46] something The Joy bells of Glory has
[1:34:48] just set in on me
[1:34:50] I never had it happen like that
[1:34:52] there's just something I know there is
[1:34:56] coming a Time
[1:34:58] there's coming something that's going to
[1:35:01] take place I see it in the near future
[1:35:04] the spirit of the Living God falling
[1:35:07] fresh on his church
[1:35:11] there's going to be something take place
[1:35:15] I hear a sound in the mulberry bushes
[1:35:19] something just spoke to my heart listen
[1:35:21] to the prophet prophesied
[1:35:23] something just spoke to my heart and
[1:35:25] said fear not preacher
[1:35:28] there'll be one one of these days
[1:35:32] one
[1:35:33] with each other
[1:35:35] one with Christ there'll be one one of
[1:35:38] these days
[1:35:39] they'll believe
[1:35:41] it may take persecution and things to
[1:35:44] drive us together but God will drive his
[1:35:46] church together just as certain as I'm
[1:35:48] standing in this Pulpit under one that's
[1:35:52] Christ
[1:35:53] Christ will be the head no denomination
[1:35:55] will be the head
[1:35:57] Christ will be the head of every
[1:36:00] believer
[1:36:01] Hallelujah
[1:36:03] amen
[1:36:04] can we all say we believe that
[1:36:08] friends I hope
[1:36:10] know that
[1:36:12] I wasn't trying to correct
[1:36:15] any certain person I'm preaching from my
[1:36:18] heart I'm correcting myself

[1:36:39] when this word ends
[1:36:41] Revelation chapter 22. you know who's
[1:36:44] speaking
[1:36:47] I'll read it to you
[1:36:55] Revelation chapter 22 at the end
[1:37:00] I can quote it by heart but I figured
[1:37:02] it'd be good to just to read it right
[1:37:03] out of the book
[1:37:05] it says this revelation 22 17 and the
[1:37:08] spirit
[1:37:10] that's the bra that's the Holy Spirit

[1:37:48] how good he's been to our families
[1:37:53] he's allowed us to live
[1:37:56] and some of the things that that we've
[1:37:58] done we would have been struck down
[1:38:00] before the blood of Christ was shed
[1:38:03] but now it's shed
[1:38:05] and we're grateful for forgiveness
[1:38:09] we bring up before him these prayers and
[1:38:12] don't ever think that he doesn't hear
[1:38:14] your prayers

[1:38:20] child or
