[18:20] number tonight but those of us that are
[18:23] here I promise you are going to receive
[18:25] a very special special blessing
[18:29] uh we have a a visitor is it Cedric
[18:33] is that your name God bless you my
[18:35] brother welcome it's good to have you we
[18:39] um tonight we're going to be listening
[18:40] to a taped sermon in this sermon was um
[18:45] from many decades ago in the 1950s
[18:49] and it was from a very special man this
[18:54] man's named William Branham he is the
[18:57] one that started have you heard of the
[18:59] charismatic Revival back in the 50s it
[19:02] gave rise to people like Billy Graham
[19:04] and Oral Roberts and even do today like
[19:07] Benny Hinn and all of them have followed
[19:09] in brother branham's footsteps
[19:12] and this
[19:14] part of this sermon brother Cedric we're
[19:17] going to hear tonight
[19:18] is the supernatural way that this man
[19:22] William Branham got his commission to go
[19:25] forth and
[19:28] um pray for the sick and really it
[19:30] changed the world
[19:31] the Pentecostals and and the
[19:34] denominations that it switched to a
[19:36] healing Revival it was a great move that
[19:39] that spread around the world
[19:41] and
[19:42] tonight we're going to hear for all of
[19:45] us we're going to hear
[19:47] how brother Branham got that commission
[19:51] to pray for the sick now
[19:54] there's a few things that I want to talk
[19:57] about before
[19:59] we get to the sermon
[20:02] and um
[20:04] lay a foundation
[20:06] brother Branham had had very
[20:09] Supernatural things that had followed
[20:11] his whole life
[20:12] when he was born
[20:14] they witnessed a supernatural light come
[20:17] into the room and and hover over him
[20:19] when he was born in this little Log
[20:21] Cabin way back in the hills of Kentucky
[20:24] and he had a special gift that we don't
[20:29] see
[20:30] very often but we do see it in this book
[20:35] especially among the prophets of old we
[20:38] also see it in the in the New Testament
[20:40] we see it among the disciples but this
[20:43] gift is the gift of the Supernatural and
[20:47] it's something that we should be seeing
[20:49] more of today
[20:52] so what happened was brother Branham
[20:56] um he was really upset because he would
[20:59] see visions and he would have these
[21:01] Supernatural experiences and the
[21:04] preachers that he was in his circle of
[21:07] friends would tell him that no those
[21:09] things aren't right those things are
[21:11] evil
[21:12] those things are from the Devil
[21:15] and it as a young man it really it
[21:17] really upset him and and it kept
[21:19] happening in his life and it came to the
[21:22] point in his late 30s that he just
[21:24] couldn't handle it anymore
[21:27] so what he did
[21:29] was he told his wife he said he was
[21:31] working a job for the power company and
[21:34] he said uh he says I'm going up to my
[21:38] place he had a cave
[21:40] up in the mountains north of his
[21:42] hometown in Southern Indiana called
[21:44] Jeffersonville he had about 30 minutes
[21:47] North near the town of Charlestown
[21:50] is a uh a river a creek called 14 Mile
[21:54] Creek
[21:55] and um it uh it's I don't know it's
[22:00] probably as wide as as this building is
[22:02] and it shrinks down fairly fairly small
[22:04] most time of the year and you can just
[22:06] wait across it but he had a cave it's
[22:08] Limestone up there he had a cave that he
[22:10] would go back in there and he would pray
[22:11] and he and the Lord would deal with him
[22:13] there well he had to get away and to get
[22:19] things right and to see are these things
[22:22] from God
[22:23] or are they from the devil like all
[22:26] these preachers are telling me
[22:28] and he was under the impression that
[22:31] these things are from the devil and he
[22:33] wanted to be delivered of them
[22:35] so he went up now there's
[22:38] two different versions of his life story
[22:41] that we tell that that he was either in
[22:43] a cave or he was in a cabin but this
[22:46] tape that we're going to hear tonight
[22:48] answers that question
[22:50] so what happened was brother Branham was
[22:54] on his way up to that cave to pray
[22:59] and
[23:01] he went up there and I think he prayed a
[23:03] little bit and then he came back to the
[23:05] cabin now the distance between the cabin
[23:08] and the cave
[23:09] is probably less than a half a mile
[23:12] they're right next to each other at a
[23:15] place called tunnel Mill
[23:16] so the the really close brother Brandon
[23:20] would pray in the cave so he was staying
[23:22] the night as you'll hear on the tape in
[23:25] this cabin
[23:26] and you're going to hear him tell the
[23:29] story of what happened
[23:31] on that very special night
[23:34] um but I wanted to share a couple
[23:37] testimonies with you
[23:39] of um brother Branham tells a story a
[23:42] couple stories and I actually had the
[23:45] honor of meeting a couple people that
[23:47] were there when brother Branham tells
[23:49] these stories one of the stories
[23:52] was brother Brahm tells that he was
[23:53] baptizing a number of people
[23:57] and there was a young lady
[23:59] that got in a boat
[24:02] and she paddled out to where brother
[24:05] Branham was baptizing people and started
[24:08] making fun of him
[24:10] now this man that I met he was in his
[24:13] 90s and I probably met him about 10 10
[24:16] years ago or so so and he passed on not
[24:19] too long after I talked with him his
[24:21] name is Robert E Lee I'll never forget
[24:22] his name
[24:24] and and he uh he had many many
[24:27] experiences with brother Branham but in
[24:31] this instance he was telling me this
[24:33] story and he said that he was standing
[24:36] on the bank and there were many people
[24:40] going to baptism
[24:42] brother Branham was out baptizing in the
[24:44] river and this woman young lady
[24:48] she paddles out in a boat and she's
[24:51] showing off in front of her friends and
[24:54] she's heckling brother Branham now
[24:57] brother Branham knew her
[24:59] he called her by name
[25:01] and he said hey you know stop doing it
[25:04] you know and she just kept on and this
[25:07] Robert this young man was watching this
[25:10] whole thing and
[25:11] she's out in her boat brother Branham is
[25:14] baptizing and he kept asking her will
[25:17] you stop it have some respect
[25:19] and she just kept on making fun of him
[25:22] and making fun of the people coming out
[25:24] to be baptized
[25:26] well
[25:28] Robert told me now there's
[25:31] this has got to be the same story I
[25:33] don't know how it could be different
[25:34] Robert
[25:36] um Robert Lee
[25:39] he said that while she was out there
[25:43] that something happened to her
[25:47] and she started losing her mind
[25:50] and she just kept on saying it more and
[25:54] it just it kept getting worse and worse
[25:57] and he knew this woman from before
[26:00] and she just started acting more and
[26:03] more irrationally
[26:05] and
[26:06] watching her out there and and she just
[26:08] kept on and finally she just leaned
[26:11] forward
[26:12] and Robert said he said you know he said
[26:16] I knew her family and he says I never
[26:19] saw her again after that
[26:22] he says he says I think that she died
[26:26] he said within two weeks he says
[26:29] she was she was dead because I never saw
[26:32] her again
[26:33] and her family still lived there
[26:35] but what I don't think he knew was she
[26:38] was actually committed for the rest of
[26:40] her life into an insane asylum and she
[26:43] died there
[26:45] so very very serious thing that happened
[26:50] right there and you're going to hear on
[26:51] the tape so when brother random mentions
[26:53] it remember the story that I told
[26:56] and this is another story that I was out
[26:59] I used to go out and ride my bike around
[27:01] Jeffersonville and I'd talk to old folks
[27:04] and and finally I made my way to this
[27:09] um old black man that had a barbecue
[27:12] restaurant called Marvin's barbecue and
[27:15] it was good did you ever go there buddy
[27:16] ever take you there yeah I took Daniel
[27:18] there it was really really the best
[27:20] barbecue in Jeffersonville but he also
[27:22] had a little convenience store
[27:25] so
[27:26] I had heard that he knew brother random
[27:28] so I started talking with him
[27:30] and uh I said you ever know William
[27:33] Branham he goes oh yeah
[27:35] he says I know him well
[27:37] he said
[27:39] he said back way back in the 40s when he
[27:43] knew him
[27:44] he said that there was segregation
[27:48] and he said blacks and whites did not
[27:51] mix
[27:53] and he said he went to an all-black
[27:56] School
[27:57] and he said brother Branham he'd be
[28:00] walking to school this young man
[28:02] teenager he'd be walking to school and
[28:06] brother Branham would pick him up in his
[28:07] car
[28:08] and Marvin said he said he always had
[28:12] he said he was always shined up he says
[28:15] I got in that thing and I used to
[28:18] feel really good
[28:20] so brother random would take him to
[28:22] school
[28:24] and he said he says that was in the you
[28:26] know the late 40s and he said
[28:29] I never knew he was a preacher
[28:32] he said he was just a down-to-earth guy
[28:34] he said he talked like everybody else he
[28:37] said he he said he didn't talk like
[28:39] other Preachers did he said he talked
[28:41] like us like a normal person
[28:44] he said boy I really liked him he says I
[28:47] knew that he worked for the um the
[28:49] fishing game in conservation and he said
[28:52] he said he was just wow he's just he's
[28:54] just a really great guy and he said then
[28:58] he said
[29:00] he came up missing
[29:03] and he said I didn't see him for months
[29:06] and I thought I wonder whatever happened
[29:08] to that guy Billy Branham
[29:11] and he said then he came back
[29:15] and he said he was famous
[29:19] he said all of a sudden all of these
[29:22] people started coming from all over the
[29:24] world to come to our little town of
[29:27] Jeffersonville to hear Billy Branham and
[29:30] he's not even know he's a preacher and
[29:31] then they were telling me he's a he's a
[29:33] preacher and and he's famous and and all
[29:36] of this healing he said he said I had no
[29:39] idea he said but I knew him he said I
[29:42] knew him before he got famous he said
[29:44] but I don't know what happened
[29:47] when he came up missing
[29:49] and he came back and he was famous
[29:52] and friends the tape that we're going to
[29:54] hear tonight is the answer to that
[29:57] question
[29:58] brother Branham was in the Wilderness
[30:01] Area there in tunnel Mill he was in that
[30:04] little cabin and this
[30:07] supernatural being came to him and gave
[30:11] him his commission to to he to pray for
[30:15] the sick
[30:17] and then you'll notice right afterwards
[30:21] brother Branham went out on the field
[30:24] and he started traveling the country
[30:27] and
[30:28] these great healing revivals they they
[30:32] just started growing and growing until
[30:36] these healing revivals were the biggest
[30:40] religious gatherings that had ever been
[30:43] in the United States
[30:46] when brother Branham was preaching them
[30:48] that's how famous according to Marvin's
[30:52] words brother Branham was when he went
[30:55] out and he was doing these things and
[30:57] that was in the late 1940s just after he
[31:01] got this commission to pray for the sick
[31:05] so very very exciting time and I've told
[31:10] you I've given the testimony how I
[31:12] looked back in the Branham Tabernacle
[31:15] records and I saw from I think they
[31:18] started in 1934
[31:20] all the way until like 1945 or 46 the
[31:25] offering was like a dollar
[31:27] didn't change much
[31:28] the same amount of people came to church
[31:32] Church wasn't really growing it was you
[31:35] know you could tell that it was a good
[31:37] church it was a solid church but brother
[31:39] Branham like I said
[31:41] um with Marvin he had to work
[31:43] he was he was doing other things and and
[31:46] trying to make a living and then
[31:49] all of a sudden it exploded
[31:53] and it exploded because of this sermon
[31:57] this testimony that we're going to hear
[32:00] tonight
[32:01] very very special so for time's sake
[32:05] we're going to start
[32:08] with
[32:10] paragraph number 30
[32:12] 5
[32:14] brother Jordan and if we could end on
[32:17] paragraph 214.
[32:20] after after paragraph 214.
[32:23] okay
[32:25] and
[32:27] but I want to encourage everyone to go
[32:30] hear the whole sermon
[32:32] because at the beginning it's basically
[32:34] a life story he talks about what I just
[32:36] talked about when he was born and then
[32:39] at the end of this sermon
[32:43] it is the most amazing thing and I want
[32:45] you to listen to it on your own it's the
[32:48] most amazing thing brother Branham tells
[32:51] the people gives them a hint what's
[32:54] going to happen because he's talking
[32:55] about this Angel and this Angel tells
[32:57] him that you're going to know the very
[32:58] secrets of the people's hearts
[33:01] and then at the end of the sermon
[33:05] brother Branham starts going from person
[33:08] to person
[33:09] you have this wrong with you your name
[33:12] is this you have that wrong with you
[33:14] going from person to person all the way
[33:17] in the back and to the front
[33:19] every different problem that you can
[33:22] imagine and he proves what this angel
[33:25] said was the truth and again for time's
[33:29] sake we're not going to hear the only
[33:30] the whole thing
[33:32] but I want you all to listen to it
[33:35] um
[33:36] January 17 1955
[33:39] in Chicago at Lane Tech High School I
[33:43] think that was a Monday it was a Monday
[33:44] night that he preached us and it was a
[33:46] start of meetings that he was going to
[33:48] have again we'll start on paragraph 35
[33:51] and I've already read the scriptures and
[33:53] and brother branham's into the sermon
[33:55] now so I'll sit down and I will turn the
[33:58] service over to brother Branham God
[34:00] bless you
[34:01] and now
[34:03] anyhow at the as a little boy you know
[34:06] the vision had spoke to me is about
[34:08] seven years old and said don't drink or
[34:10] smoke or defile your body in any way
[34:12] there'll be a work for you do when you
[34:13] get older and you've heard that told in
[34:16] the book well that's right
[34:18] all alone he kept happening
[34:21] when I become a minister well then it
[34:24] then it really started happening all the
[34:27] time
[34:28] and uh one night saw our lord Jesus I'm
[34:32] saying this with permission I believe
[34:35] from the Holy Spirit the angel of the
[34:37] Lord it comes is not the Lord Jesus it
[34:41] doesn't look like him in the same time I
[34:43] thought if I could just get him to
[34:44] accept the Lord Jesus I went out laid
[34:47] down a little old palate out in the
[34:49] front room near the door and something
[34:52] said to me rise up
[34:54] and I raised up went walking and went
[34:57] back into the field behind me no broom
[34:59] Sage field they're studying out over 10
[35:01] feet from me stood a man white garment
[35:04] on little fella had his arms folded like
[35:06] this a Beard's kind of sharp hair down
[35:09] to his shoulders and he's looking
[35:10] Sideways from me like that
[35:12] peaceful looking figure but I couldn't
[35:15] understand how his feet weren't just
[35:17] behind the other and the wind blowing
[35:18] his Road moving Sage blowing I thought
[35:21] now wait a minute I bit myself I said
[35:23] now I'm not asleep and I pull down pull
[35:26] a little piece of that Sage off you've
[35:28] got it like a toothpick in it I put it
[35:29] in my mouth I looked back towards the
[35:31] house I said no
[35:33] I was in there praying for Dad something
[35:35] said come out here and here stands this
[35:36] man I thought that looks like the Lord
[35:38] Jesus I thought I wonder if it is and
[35:41] he's looking just exactly directly
[35:43] towards where our house sets now so I
[35:45] moved around this way to see if I could
[35:47] see him and ever moved him I thought I'd
[35:50] leave our calling I said Jesus and when
[35:53] he did he looked around like that
[35:55] as all I remember he just reached out
[35:57] his arms there's not an artist in the
[35:59] world could paint his picture the
[36:01] characters of his face
[36:03] the best I've ever seen is that
[36:05] Hoffman's head of Christ at 33 I've got
[36:09] it on all literature and everything I
[36:10] use that's it because that looks just
[36:12] like it and so then or Premier as low
[36:15] close as it could be he looked like a
[36:17] man if he'd speak the world would come
[36:19] to an end and yet there's so much love
[36:21] and kindness to you I just pitched over
[36:24] in a daylight I found myself just to
[36:26] break a day pajama shirts soaking wet
[36:29] with tears when I come to myself walking
[36:31] back to the broomstage feel home
[36:33] I told it to a minister friend of mine
[36:36] he said Billy that'll run you crazy
[36:39] he said that's the devil and said don't
[36:42] you fool with nothing like that I was a
[36:44] Baptist minister at the time
[36:46] well I went over to another old friend
[36:48] of mine I sat down and told him about it
[36:50] and I said uh brother what do you think
[36:52] about that he said well Billy I'll tell
[36:55] you he said I believe if you'd try to
[36:57] keep your life just preach what's in the
[36:59] Bible hear the grace of God and so forth
[37:01] I wouldn't go off after some fantastic
[37:03] thing something like that I said sir I
[37:05] don't mean to go off after some
[37:07] fantastic thing I said only thing I'm
[37:09] trying to find out is what this is he
[37:12] said Billy years ago they used to have
[37:14] those things in the churches but said
[37:16] when the apostles ceased those things
[37:19] ceased with it and said now the only
[37:21] thing that we have in any kind of seeing
[37:24] those things said it's spiritualist
[37:25] demons House of old brother McKinney you
[37:28] mean that he said yes sir
[37:30] I said a whole God have mercy on me
[37:34] I said ah
[37:36] ah old Brunswick will you join with me
[37:38] in prayer that God will never let it
[37:40] happen to you know I love him and I
[37:42] don't want to be wrong in these things I
[37:45] said You Prayed with me he said I will
[37:46] brother Billy and so we had prayer right
[37:49] there in them in the parsleys I asked
[37:52] several ministers the same thing would
[37:54] come then I got scared to ask him
[37:55] because he'd be thinking I was the devil
[37:57] so I I didn't want to be like that I
[38:00] noted my heart something happened now
[38:02] that's all there there's something in my
[38:04] heart that happened and I didn't want to
[38:06] be like that never so later on in years
[38:11] I heard one day down at the First
[38:13] Baptist Church where I was a member at
[38:17] the time I heard someone saying say you
[38:20] are to one over and heard them Holy
[38:22] Rollers last time
[38:23] and I thought holy Rose
[38:26] and a friend of mine Walt Johnson bass
[38:28] singer and I said what was that brother
[38:30] wall he said a bunch of these
[38:32] Pentecostals I said what he said
[38:35] Pentecostals said Billy if you'd ever
[38:37] see that said they was rolling on the
[38:39] floor like that and jumping up and down
[38:41] and said they said that they had to
[38:44] jabber off in some kind of unknown
[38:46] tongues or they wasn't saved
[38:49] and I said where's that at all says
[38:52] little old tent meeting out there the
[38:53] other side of Louisville said colored
[38:55] people of course and I said
[38:58] and he said there's a lot of white
[39:00] people there I said did they do that too
[39:02] said yes yes
[39:04] and I said
[39:05] that's funny as people get mixed up and
[39:08] stuff like that I said well I guess we
[39:09] just have to have those things on a
[39:11] Sunday morning I never forget if he's
[39:13] eating a piece of dry orange peeling for
[39:15] indigestion he had and I just sit as
[39:18] well as it was yesterday and I thought
[39:20] jabarding jumping up and down
[39:23] what kind of religions will they get
[39:25] next and so I I went on
[39:28] later from that I met an old man it's
[39:31] here in a church maybe now or he was
[39:33] here or to church the name of John Ryan
[39:36] and I met him at a place old fellow long
[39:38] beard and hair and um and he may be here
[39:41] I thought he's from the Benton Harbor up
[39:43] here at the house of David
[39:45] and um they had a place in Louisville
[39:47] ice trying to find them people they
[39:49] called it the school of the prophets
[39:52] so I thought I'd go over to see what
[39:53] that was well I didn't see nobody
[39:55] rolling on the floor but they had some
[39:57] strange doctrines and that's where I met
[39:59] this old man he invited me came up to
[40:00] his place I went up for a vacation I was
[40:03] there one day and I went back to his
[40:05] house and he's done gone
[40:07] and he'd gone somewhere down in
[40:08] Indianapolis said the Lord called in his
[40:10] wife I said you mean you let that man
[40:12] run off like that she said oh he's God's
[40:15] servant poor old thing died a few weeks
[40:17] ago I heard him and she's devoted to him
[40:20] my that's kind of wife to have
[40:23] him that's right right or wrong he's
[40:25] right anyhow
[40:27] I said well I know the now he brother
[40:30] iron are you here
[40:33] um he isn't here he was another day
[40:35] wasn't he boys
[40:37] well they just live with what they get a
[40:39] hold of it he didn't have nothing to eat
[40:40] in the house that's right and I caught
[40:42] some fish out to a pond or a lake in
[40:44] Michigan I come back down and I come
[40:46] back down to the place and they didn't
[40:49] even have lard in the house or grease to
[40:51] cook the fish with and I said he let you
[40:53] without anything in the house so but
[40:56] he's God's servant brother Bill said he
[40:59] I thought well bless your old heart run
[41:01] I'll stand right by you that's right do
[41:03] you think that much your husband I'm
[41:04] ready to jar up and stand by you for
[41:06] that that's right we need more women
[41:08] like that today and more men thinking of
[41:10] their wife like that that's right you'd
[41:13] be a better America if husbands and
[41:15] wives are joined together like that
[41:16] right or wrong stay with them we'll be
[41:19] so many divorces
[41:21] so we we went to then I went on and Omar
[41:25] wrote home is a strange thing I come
[41:27] down to Mishawaka
[41:29] and I've seen little little old cars now
[41:32] sitting on the street called big signs
[41:34] on them said Jesus only
[41:37] I thought what Jesus on that must be
[41:39] religious I went over here and his
[41:41] bicycles had on it Jesus only Cadillacs
[41:44] Model T Fords Everything Jesus only on
[41:47] it I thought I wonder what that is so I
[41:50] followed it around come to find out it
[41:52] was a religious meeting 1500 2 000
[41:54] people there and I heard all that
[41:56] they're screaming and jumping up and
[41:58] down and going on I thought say here's
[42:00] where I'll see what holy earlers is so I
[42:03] am Old Forge you know what I claim would
[42:05] make 30 miles an hour 15 this way 15 up
[42:08] down this way so I'm pulling over to one
[42:11] side I got a place to park walk back
[42:14] down the street
[42:15] walked in looked around and everybody's
[42:19] standing it could stand I had to look
[42:20] over their heads and they were screaming
[42:22] and jumping and falling and carrying on
[42:24] I thought
[42:27] what a people that is but the longer I
[42:30] stood there
[42:31] better I felt
[42:34] that seems pretty good
[42:36] oh there ain't nothing wrong van people
[42:37] they ain't crazy I got talking to some
[42:40] of them so they they were fine people
[42:43] so I said well now that's the same
[42:46] meeting I went out and stayed all night
[42:48] that night and the next day I went in
[42:50] and you've heard me tell that my life
[42:52] story and I was on the platform as 150
[42:55] or 200 ministers maybe more and they
[42:58] want everybody to raise up and stay
[42:59] where they was from and I said
[43:00] evangelist William Branham
[43:02] Jeffersonville sit down Baptist so sit
[43:05] down each one tell where they were from
[43:06] so um that next morning when I got in
[43:10] there I was slept in the field all night
[43:12] that night and pressed my trousers
[43:14] between the two Ford seat snow and I I
[43:17] old Searsucker trousers little t-shirts
[43:19] you know so the next morning on went to
[43:22] the meeting my little t-shirt on I went
[43:24] I didn't have a three dollars I had to
[43:26] get enough gas to get home on and
[43:29] I got you some rolls it's kind of old
[43:32] you know but I was already I got to the
[43:34] Hydra got me a glass of water you know
[43:36] and they were pretty good so I soaked
[43:38] them up a little I had breakfast I could
[43:40] eat with them now they ate twice a day
[43:42] but I couldn't put nothing in the
[43:43] offering so I wouldn't
[43:44] sponge on them so then I'm
[43:48] and I I got in there that morning and
[43:50] said I just have to tell this part of it
[43:53] so got in there that morning and he said
[43:55] we're looking for William Branham a
[43:57] young evangelist was on the platform
[43:59] he's not a Baptist so we wanted to bring
[44:01] the message this morning I seen this
[44:03] gonna pull me hard that bunch of people
[44:05] me a Badness
[44:06] so I just kind of scooted down in the
[44:08] seat I had on seersucker trousers a
[44:11] t-shirt you know and we wore clerical so
[44:14] when I stepped back to the seat like
[44:16] this
[44:16] so he asked two or three times and I sat
[44:19] down by a colored brother and the reason
[44:21] they had their convention in the north
[44:22] because of segregation was then on in
[44:24] the South so they couldn't have it in
[44:26] the south
[44:27] so I wonder what this Jesus only was
[44:29] about
[44:29] now those lungs is Jesus it's all right
[44:32] so don't make any difference whether
[44:34] it's how it is just as long as it's him
[44:36] so I sat there a little bit and watched
[44:39] him and so they called two or three
[44:42] times more and
[44:43] this color brother looked over me said
[44:45] do you know him
[44:55] putting more lie to the man I didn't
[44:56] want to I said look brother
[44:58] yes I know him he said well go get him
[45:02] I said well I'll tell you brother I said
[45:06] I am he but you see I said look I these
[45:09] seersucker trousers get all that there
[45:10] and I said no I can't go up there I said
[45:13] but these trousers on I guess this
[45:15] little t-shirts and damn people don't
[45:16] care how you dressed and I said well
[45:19] look don't you mention it here I said
[45:21] see I so the next morning when the Lord
[45:23] had given me this great opportunity to
[45:25] hold these meetings I thought oh my I'll
[45:27] get with this bunch of people that must
[45:29] be the kind of what they used to call
[45:31] the shouting Methodist just went a
[45:33] little farther I thought maybe that's
[45:34] what it is so I well I'm I sure like
[45:37] that oh there's something about in my
[45:38] life they're humble and sweet so one
[45:41] thing I couldn't understand was that
[45:43] speaking in tongues that got me and I
[45:47] this one man say sitting here and one
[45:49] over here and they were the leaders of
[45:50] the group this would raise up and speak
[45:52] in tongues this would interpret it
[45:54] and would tell things about the meeting
[45:56] and so forth
[45:58] oh my sure I got to read that so then it
[46:01] vice versa follow on this and then back
[46:03] on that one and each one Speaking
[46:04] tongues interpret the rest of the church
[46:06] would speak but it didn't seem like the
[46:08] interpretation come like these two men
[46:10] now I've seen this sit close together I
[46:12] thought oh myland must be angels
[46:15] so while sitting back there ever what
[46:19] that was you know what I couldn't make
[46:20] out it would come on me
[46:22] and I have a way of knowing things if
[46:24] the Lord wants me to know it and I don't
[46:27] I Serena say I don't breathe this out
[46:30] never before in public but if I really
[46:32] want to find out anything
[46:34] the Lord usually tells me about these
[46:36] things that's what the gift is foreign
[46:38] so you can't just throw that out before
[46:40] the people it becomes like cast your
[46:42] pearls before swines it's a sacred holy
[46:44] thing and you don't want to do that so
[46:48] God will hold me responsible like
[46:50] talking to Brethren and so forth I
[46:52] wouldn't try to find out something evil
[46:53] about a brother one time sitting at a
[46:55] table with the man him with his arm
[46:57] around me said oh brother Branham I love
[46:59] you and I kept feeling something moving
[47:01] I looked at him he couldn't have told me
[47:04] that I know he didn't do it see well
[47:06] there it was he was absolutely a
[47:08] hypocrite if he ever was one see and
[47:11] right there this arm around me I said
[47:12] well
[47:13] okay walked away I don't want to know
[47:16] that I'd rather just know him the way I
[47:17] know him as my brother Let It Go like
[47:19] that let God do the rest of it see and I
[47:21] don't want to don't want to know those
[47:23] things
[47:23] and many times on these things it's not
[47:25] here in a church I'll be sitting in the
[47:27] room setting a restaurant and the Holy
[47:28] Spirit will tell me things that's going
[47:30] to happen people's right ears knows that
[47:32] to be true I'll sit at my home and I'll
[47:34] say now be careful there's a car coming
[47:35] after all be a certain certain person
[47:37] bring them on in for the Lord has said
[47:39] they'd be here when we go down the
[47:40] street there'll be certain things happen
[47:42] watch that Crossing there because you're
[47:44] going to almost get hit and just sit me
[47:45] that way you see every time just
[47:47] perfectly so you don't want to throw
[47:49] yourself too much into that because you
[47:52] can use it it's a gift of God but you
[47:55] have to watch what you do with it God
[47:57] will hold your response look at Moses
[47:59] Moses was a God sent man do you believe
[48:02] that predestinated for ordained and made
[48:05] a prophet and God sent him out there
[48:06] said go speak to the Rock after Don been
[48:08] smitten say go speak to the rotten to
[48:10] bring forth his Waters but Moses angry
[48:12] right out there struck the rock the
[48:14] water didn't come he smoked it again
[48:15] said you rebels must we bring you water
[48:18] out of this rock you see what God did
[48:20] the water come
[48:22] they come up here Moses that was the end
[48:24] of it see you have to watch those things
[48:26] so you what you do with Divine gifts is
[48:29] like a preacher a good forceful preacher
[48:31] and get out and preach just to take up
[48:33] offerings and money God will hold him
[48:34] responsible for that right you have to
[48:37] watch what you do with Divine gifts and
[48:39] or try to make some big Prestage a big
[48:41] name for some church or a big name for
[48:43] himself I'd rather have two or three
[48:44] nights meeting in braze on somewhere
[48:46] else and be humble and stay down and you
[48:49] know what I mean yes sir always keep
[48:51] your place where God can put his hand on
[48:53] you
[48:54] this is inside life now remember
[48:57] so then this day I thought well I'm
[49:00] going to walk up and I just sold alarm
[49:03] with those people I thought I'll find
[49:05] out about those man and out in the yard
[49:07] I kept looking for him after the service
[49:09] is over I looked around and found one of
[49:10] them
[49:11] I said howdy do sir he said how'd he do
[49:14] said was you the young preacher preached
[49:16] this morning I was 23 years old and I
[49:18] said yes sir and he said uh what was
[49:21] your name I said Brandon I said yours
[49:23] and he told me his name and I thought
[49:25] well now if I can just get his contact
[49:26] of his Spirit now
[49:29] and uh yet not knowing what that was
[49:31] doing it and I said well um say sir I
[49:35] said
[49:36] you people have something here that I
[49:38] don't have he said have you got the Holy
[49:40] Ghost since you believe
[49:42] I said well I'm a Baptist he said but
[49:44] have you received the Holy Ghost since
[49:46] you believe
[49:47] and I said well brother what do you mean
[49:51] I said I haven't got what you all got I
[49:53] know that
[49:54] I said because you've got something that
[49:57] seems to be powerful and so have you
[49:59] ever spoke with tongues and I said no
[50:01] sir I said I'll tell you right quick you
[50:03] haven't got the Holy Ghost and I said
[50:05] well if I if that's what it takes to get
[50:07] the Holy Ghost I haven't got it and so
[50:10] he said well if you haven't spoke with
[50:12] tongues you haven't got it and keeping
[50:13] this conversation I said well can
[50:15] I get it I said get on in the room there
[50:16] and start seeking the Holy Ghost
[50:18] now I kept watching you know he didn't
[50:20] know what I was doing but he I knew he
[50:22] had a little strange feeling because he
[50:23] his eyes begin to get little glasses he
[50:25] looked at me and he but he was really a
[50:28] Christian he was absolutely wrung out
[50:31] 100 a Christian that's right well I
[50:34] thought praise God here it is I've got
[50:37] to get to that altar somewhere
[50:39] I went out looked all around thought I'd
[50:42] find the other man and when I found him
[50:44] and started talking to him I said how'd
[50:46] he do sir he said say
[50:48] what church you belong to said they tell
[50:50] me you're a Baptist I said yep
[50:52] and he said you ain't got Holy Ghost
[50:54] here have you I said well I don't know
[50:56] so you ever spoke in tongues I said no
[50:57] sir said you haven't got it
[50:59] and I said well I know I haven't got
[51:01] what you all got I know that I said but
[51:04] my brother I'm really wanting it he said
[51:06] well there's there's the pool already I
[51:10] said I've been baptized but I said I I
[51:12] haven't received what you all got I said
[51:14] you got something and I I really want
[51:17] and he said uh well that's fine I was
[51:19] trying to catch him to see and if I when
[51:21] I finally got his Spirit now that was
[51:22] the other man if I ever talk to a low
[51:25] down hypocrite there was one of them
[51:28] he was living his wife was a
[51:30] black-headed woman he is living with a
[51:31] blonde and had two children by her
[51:34] drink cursed run to taverns and
[51:38] everything else and yet in there and
[51:40] speaking in tongues and prophesying
[51:43] then I said Lord forgive me
[51:46] I went home
[51:48] that's right I said I'll just get I
[51:51] can't understand it seemed like the
[51:52] Blessed Holy Spirit falling in on that
[51:55] hypocrite I said can't be that's all
[51:58] during this long pure Demi studying and
[52:00] crying thought if I could get out the
[52:02] Bible or it's not right it has to come
[52:04] from here is to be proved in the Bible
[52:07] not just one place but it has to come
[52:09] all the way through the Bible I have to
[52:11] believe it has to dovetail and tie
[52:13] together with every scripture or I don't
[52:15] believe it
[52:16] and then because Paul said if an angel
[52:18] from Heaven Come preach any other gospel
[52:20] let him be accursed so I believe the
[52:22] Bible now I said I could never see
[52:24] nothing like that in the Bible two years
[52:26] later
[52:27] after I lost my wife and everything I
[52:29] was up there to Greens Mill my little
[52:31] old place up there praying been back in
[52:34] my cave back there for two or three days
[52:35] two days at well I walked out to get a
[52:38] bit of a breath of air and when I walked
[52:40] out there my Bible is laying out there
[52:42] on the end of a log just as you come in
[52:44] an old tree blow down had a fork in it
[52:45] now you had four clean up like this the
[52:48] tree laying down and I just set straddle
[52:49] that log and lay out there at night time
[52:51] looking up towards the skies like at my
[52:53] hand laying up like this and sometimes
[52:54] go to sleep laying around on the log
[52:55] like that brain be up there several days
[52:57] just don't eat or drink it's their
[52:59] praying and I walked out to get a little
[53:02] fresh out all that cave is cool damped
[53:05] back in there so then uh come out and
[53:07] there leave my Bible where it had it the
[53:09] day before and it was turned to Hebrews
[53:12] the sixth chapter and I begin to read
[53:14] there let us lay aside on go on to
[53:17] Perfection not laying again the
[53:18] foundation of repentance and dead words
[53:20] and Faith towards God and so forth for
[53:23] it is impossible for those which were
[53:24] once enlightened made partakers of the
[53:26] Heavenly gifts callings and so forth but
[53:29] said
[53:30] but thorns and thistles which is not
[53:32] unto rejection who's in the water the
[53:34] rain cometh off upon the Earth to dress
[53:36] it and prepare for that which is that
[53:39] which is not into a rejection with
[53:40] thorns and thistles whose end is to be
[53:42] burned and something like
[53:45] [Music]
[53:47] oh here it is oh here now whatever he he
[53:51] won't be up here he's fixing to give me
[53:53] a vision right now I waited around into
[53:55] that log and waited I cut up walked back
[53:57] and forth up and down walked back
[53:59] nothing happened walked back to my cave
[54:02] again nothing happened I stood there
[54:04] well what is this I walked over to my
[54:07] Bible again and oh it just come all over
[54:09] me again I picked it up and I thought
[54:11] what's in there he wants me to read I
[54:13] kept reading on down about uh repentance
[54:16] towards God and faith and so forth and I
[54:19] read on downward said the rain cometh
[54:21] off upon the Earth to dress it and
[54:23] prepare it for what's meant for for here
[54:26] but the uh thorns and thistles which is
[54:29] not into rejection whose end is to be
[54:31] burned and or just shake me I thought
[54:33] Lord are you going to give me a vision
[54:35] of what I was up there asking for
[54:37] something another that all at once
[54:39] before me I seen the world are rolling
[54:42] there's all disc it up and here one a
[54:45] man with white with his head up a sowing
[54:47] seeds like this and when he went coming
[54:50] this is he went over the hill here come
[54:52] a man behind him dressed in black with
[54:54] his head down a sowing seeds and when
[54:57] the good seeds come up it was sweet and
[54:59] when the bad seeds come up it was Weeds
[55:02] and then become a great drought on the
[55:05] earth and the wheat had its head hanging
[55:08] over just about Paris wanting water I've
[55:11] seen all the people with their hands up
[55:13] praying for God to send water and then
[55:15] I've seen the weed it had its head down
[55:17] Bound for water and just then the great
[55:20] clouds come across and the rain just
[55:23] gushed down and when it did the little
[55:25] wheat that's all been overwined
[55:28] stood right up and the little weed right
[55:30] but siren
[55:31] did right up
[55:33] I thought well what's that
[55:35] then they come to me there it is the
[55:39] same rain
[55:41] that makes the wheat to grow makes the
[55:43] weed to grow
[55:45] and the same Holy Spirit can fall in a
[55:48] bunch of people and can bless the
[55:50] hypocrite just the same as it blesses
[55:52] the others Jesus said buy their fruits
[55:56] you shall know them not whether he
[55:58] shouts whether he rejoices
[56:00] but it's by his fruit you shall know him
[56:03] I said there you are I got it Lord I
[56:06] said then that really is the truth this
[56:09] man you could have gifts without knowing
[56:12] god
[56:13] so then I then I was getting too
[56:15] critical on speaking with tongues you
[56:17] see
[56:19] one day then how God have indicated that
[56:21] to me
[56:22] I was baptizing down on the river my
[56:24] first converts at the Ohio River and the
[56:28] 17th person I was baptizing as a star to
[56:30] baptize them I said fathers I baptized
[56:33] him as water you baptized him with the
[56:35] Holy Spirit I started
[56:37] the put him out of the water just then a
[56:40] whirl come from the heavens above and
[56:42] here come that light shining down
[56:45] hundreds and hundreds of people on the
[56:47] bank
[56:48] right at two o'clock in the afternoon in
[56:50] June and hung right over where was that
[56:52] a voice spoke from there and said as
[56:55] John the Baptist was sent for the
[56:58] Forerunner of the first coming of Christ
[57:00] you gotta have a message that will bring
[57:03] forth the forerunning of the second
[57:05] coming of Christ and it like scared me
[57:08] to death and I went back and all the
[57:10] people there the the foundrymen and all
[57:12] them the drug us and all them on the
[57:13] bank at baptized by two or three hundred
[57:16] that afternoon and when they taken me
[57:18] out pull me out of the water the deacons
[57:20] and so forth went up they asked me said
[57:22] what did that lightning a big group of
[57:24] colored people from the uh the Gilded
[57:27] Age Baptist Church and and the Lone Star
[57:29] Church down there and many of those down
[57:31] there they begin screaming when they saw
[57:32] that happen people fainted a girl I
[57:35] tried to get out of a boat they're
[57:37] sitting there with a swimming suit on
[57:39] a Sunday school teacher in a church
[57:42] and I said won't you get out Margie she
[57:45] said Billy I don't have to get out I
[57:47] said that's right you don't have to but
[57:48] I'd have enough respects for the gospel
[57:50] to get out where I'm baptized he said I
[57:52] don't have to and when that she sat
[57:54] there snickered and laughed at me
[57:55] baptizing
[57:57] of course she didn't believe in
[57:58] baptizing so then when the angel of the
[58:01] Lord come down she pitched forward in
[58:03] the boat
[58:04] the day the girls in the insane
[58:06] Institution so
[58:08] you just can't play with God
[58:11] now later on a beautiful girl went to
[58:15] drinking later on was hit with a bottle
[58:17] of beer bottle cut all over her face
[58:19] down all a horrible looking person and
[58:22] there that happened and then all along
[58:26] down through life I'd see that see that
[58:29] moving see that Visions how those things
[58:32] would happen then a little later on it
[58:35] kept bothering me so much and everybody
[58:38] tell me it was wrong and I took off to
[58:40] my old stamping grounds up there were
[58:43] always prayed through and I no matter
[58:46] how much I keep praying for that not to
[58:48] come to me it come anyhow

[1:00:11] but I don't want the devil having
[1:00:13] anything to do with me
[1:00:14] and I said I can't go on like this I'm a
[1:00:17] prisoner
[1:00:19] I said all the time when this thing

[1:01:01] while call them up tell them I'll I'll
[1:01:03] may be back tomorrow I may not never be
[1:01:05] back if I ain't back in the next five
[1:01:07] days put a man on in my place now I said
[1:01:09] meeting I'll never come out of that
[1:01:12] Woods until God promises me he'll take
[1:01:15] that thing away from me and never let it
[1:01:17] happen again think of the ignorance that
[1:01:20] a man can be thy went up there that
[1:01:22] night
[1:01:23] went back into the low cabin for his
[1:01:25] next day it was kind of late I was going
[1:01:26] to go up to my Camp the next day up on
[1:01:28] the farther around the mountain
[1:01:30] or the hill rather and get up in the
[1:01:32] woods there I don't believe the FBI
[1:01:35] could find me up there so this is a
[1:01:37] little cabin I've been praying all that
[1:01:39] afternoon and before it got too dark I
[1:01:42] prayed was reading over there in a Bible
[1:01:44] where it said the spirit of the prophets
[1:01:46] is subject to the prophet
[1:01:49] I couldn't make that out so it got too
[1:01:51] dark in the little cabin where I used to
[1:01:53] trap when I was a boy I had a trap line
[1:01:55] through there and go up there and fish
[1:01:57] and stay all night to the little
[1:01:58] dilapidated cabin something or whatever
[1:02:00] been in there for years some tenant
[1:02:02] might have had it before it all come to
[1:02:03] that
[1:02:05] and so I I was just waiting there and I
[1:02:07] thought well
[1:02:08] got along towards one o'clock two
[1:02:11] o'clock three o'clock in the morning
[1:02:13] I was walking up down the floor
[1:02:16] walking back and forth
[1:02:18] I sat down a little still there a little
[1:02:21] not stool a little
[1:02:22] box of a thing I sit down there and I
[1:02:25] thought oh God
[1:02:28] why do you do this to me
[1:02:31] I said father you know I love you
[1:02:34] you know that I love you
[1:02:37] and I I don't want to be possessed with
[1:02:40] the Devil
[1:02:41] I don't want them things to happen to me
[1:02:44] please God don't never let it happen no
[1:02:46] more
[1:02:47] I said I I love you I don't want to go
[1:02:50] to hell
[1:02:51] what's the use of me preaching and
[1:02:54] trying and put my efforts forth if I'm
[1:02:57] wrong I'm not only taking myself to hell
[1:03:00] I'm misleading thousands of others or
[1:03:03] hundreds of others in them days and I
[1:03:04] said I had a big Ministry and I said
[1:03:07] well I I don't never want to happen to
[1:03:09] me again I sit down on this little steel
[1:03:11] and I'm just setting all kind of
[1:03:14] disposition
[1:03:18] just like that and all at once I've seen
[1:03:21] a light thickering room I thought
[1:03:23] somebody was coming up with a flashlight
[1:03:26] and I looked around and I thought well
[1:03:28] and here it was right out in front of me
[1:03:29] an old wooden boards on the floor and
[1:03:32] there it was right in front of me
[1:03:33] there's a little old drum stole sitting
[1:03:35] in the corner the top was tore out of it
[1:03:37] and and right in here there was a a
[1:03:40] light on the floor and I thought well
[1:03:41] where is that
[1:03:43] well that couldn't be coming I looked
[1:03:45] around
[1:03:46] and here it was above me
[1:03:49] this very same light
[1:03:51] right there above me hanging right like
[1:03:53] that
[1:03:54] circling around like a fire is kind of
[1:03:56] an emerald color going
[1:04:00] I got just above it okay and I look at
[1:04:03] that and I'll go what is that now
[1:04:05] it scared me I heard somebody come in
[1:04:09] just walking oh it's barefooted and I
[1:04:12] seen the foot of a man come in dark in
[1:04:14] the room all but right here we're
[1:04:15] shining right down I've seen a foot of a
[1:04:17] man coming in and when he come in to the
[1:04:20] room
[1:04:23] walked on up is the man about to Look
[1:04:26] Away about 200 pounds he had his hands
[1:04:28] folded like this now I've seen it in a
[1:04:31] whirlwind I'd heard it talk to me and
[1:04:33] seen it in a form of a light but the
[1:04:35] first time I ever seen the image of it
[1:04:37] it walked up to me real close all our
[1:04:40] honest friend I thought my heart would
[1:04:41] fail me I just imagine put yourself
[1:04:44] there it'd make you feel the same way
[1:04:46] you're maybe farther along the road than
[1:04:48] I am they've been a Christian longer but
[1:04:50] it would make you feel that way cause
[1:04:52] after hundreds and hundreds of times of
[1:04:55] visitation it paralyzes me when he comes
[1:04:57] near
[1:04:58] sometimes it even makes me up almost
[1:05:01] completely pass out just so weak and
[1:05:04] I'll leave the platform many times if I
[1:05:06] stay too long I'll go completely out
[1:05:09] I've had them ride me around for hours
[1:05:10] not even know where I was at
[1:05:12] now I can't explain it read down here in
[1:05:15] the Bible and it'll explain it what it
[1:05:17] is the scripture says so so our Center
[1:05:21] and they're looking at him I
[1:05:23] can't let my hand up like that he's
[1:05:25] looking right at me just as pleasant
[1:05:28] but he had a real deep voice
[1:05:30] and he said do not fear
[1:05:33] I am sent from the presence of almighty
[1:05:35] God
[1:05:36] and when he spoke that voice that was
[1:05:39] the same voice that spoke to me when I
[1:05:41] was two years old all the way up I know
[1:05:43] that was him
[1:05:45] and I thought now and here now listen to
[1:05:47] the conversation I'll quote it the best
[1:05:50] that I can knowingly word by word
[1:05:52] because I hardly remember and he
[1:05:56] I said
[1:05:57] looked at him like that he said do not
[1:05:59] fear
[1:06:00] this is quite said I'm sent from the
[1:06:03] presence of almighty God to tell you
[1:06:05] that your peculiar birth as you know
[1:06:07] what my birth was up there that same
[1:06:09] light hung over me when I was first born
[1:06:12] and so I said the your peculiar birth
[1:06:14] and misunderstood life
[1:06:17] has been to indicate that you're to go
[1:06:19] to all the world and pray for the sick
[1:06:22] people
[1:06:24] it said
[1:06:25] and regardless of what they have and he
[1:06:28] designated God who's my judge knows that
[1:06:30] he designated cancer said enough if you
[1:06:33] get the people to believe you and be
[1:06:35] sincere when you pray nothing shall
[1:06:38] stand before your prayer not even cancer
[1:06:40] thank you if you get the people to
[1:06:43] believe you
[1:06:44] and I've seen you wasn't my enemy he was
[1:06:47] my friend
[1:06:49] I didn't know where you where I was
[1:06:50] dying or what was happening when he's
[1:06:52] coming up to me like that and I said
[1:06:54] well sir I said I am
[1:06:57] what I know about healings and things
[1:06:59] like that those gifts I said well sir I
[1:07:02] am a I'm a poor man and I said I'm among
[1:07:06] my people I I live with my people who's
[1:07:08] poor I'm uneducated and I said and uh I
[1:07:13] I would not be able they're not they're
[1:07:15] not understand me I said they they
[1:07:17] wouldn't um they wouldn't hear me and he
[1:07:20] said
[1:07:21] as the prophet Moses was given two gifts
[1:07:25] signs rather to have Vindicated his
[1:07:29] ministry
[1:07:30] so will you've given to so are you given
[1:07:34] two gifts
[1:07:35] to vindicate
[1:07:37] your ministry
[1:07:39] he said one of them will be that you'll
[1:07:42] take the person that you're praying for
[1:07:44] by the hand with your left hand and
[1:07:46] their right
[1:07:49] and said then just stand quiet and it'll
[1:07:53] be a physical effect that'll happen on
[1:07:55] your body
[1:07:57] and said then you pray and if it leaves
[1:07:59] the disease is gone from the people if
[1:08:03] it doesn't leave just ask the blessing
[1:08:05] and walk away
[1:08:07] well I said sir I'm afraid they won't
[1:08:10] receive me he said and the next
[1:08:12] thing will be if they won't hear that
[1:08:15] then they will hear this
[1:08:17] said then it will come to pass that
[1:08:19] you'll know the very secret of their
[1:08:21] heart
[1:08:22] said this they will hear
[1:08:25] well I said sir that's why I'm here
[1:08:29] tonight
[1:08:30] I have been told by my clergyman that
[1:08:33] those things has been coming to me was
[1:08:36] wrong he said you were born in this
[1:08:38] world for that purpose
[1:08:40] see gifts and calling without repentance

[1:08:46] that purpose and I said well sir I said
[1:08:48] that my curcumen told me it it was the
[1:08:51] the evil spirit
[1:08:53] and I said they uh
[1:08:56] that's why I'm here praying and here's
[1:08:59] what he quoted to me he related to me
[1:09:02] the coming of the Lord Jesus in his
[1:09:05] first time
[1:09:06] and I said the strange thing was friends
[1:09:09] well I'll stop right here just for a
[1:09:11] minute
[1:09:12] go back what made me more scared than
[1:09:14] ever every time I met a fortune teller

[1:09:20] happened and that would just nearly kill
[1:09:23] me pray this is one day my cousins and I
[1:09:26] was going down to a carnival grounds we
[1:09:28] just boys walk along so there's a little

[1:12:44] wise man to Jesus Christ
[1:12:47] and I kind of stolen you know I said
[1:12:50] well I don't know about religion and she
[1:12:52] said well you've heard about the wise
[1:12:54] man coming to see Jesus I said yes
[1:12:57] and she said well what was wise man oh I
[1:13:01] said it was just wise man all I know she
[1:13:03] said well what is a wise man
[1:13:06] she said the same thing that I am an
[1:13:08] astrologist Stargazer they call him and
[1:13:11] she said you know if before God does
[1:13:13] anything in in the earth he always
[1:13:15] declares in the heavens and then on the
[1:13:17] earth and I said I don't know
[1:13:20] and she said well she called two or
[1:13:23] three two three stars like Mars Jupiter
[1:13:26] and Venus it wasn't them but she said
[1:13:28] they crossed their path and come
[1:13:30] together and made said there was three
[1:13:34] wise men that come to meet the Lord
[1:13:36] Jesus and one was from the lineage of
[1:13:38] ham and one sham another japheth and
[1:13:41] said when they met together at Bethlehem
[1:13:43] the three stars that they were from
[1:13:45] every person on Earth said it has
[1:13:47] something to do with the Stars said ask
[1:13:49] that sailor there when the moon goes out
[1:13:51] and the Heavenly Planet goes out this
[1:13:53] tide doesn't go with it coming out said
[1:13:54] I don't have to ask him that I know that
[1:13:56] and she said well your birth has
[1:13:58] something to do with the Stars up there
[1:13:59] and I said well that I don't know and
[1:14:01] she said now these three wise men came
[1:14:04] and said when they ate three stars when
[1:14:06] they they come from different directions
[1:14:07] and they met at Bethlehem and they said
[1:14:09] they found out and consulted one versus
[1:14:12] the lineage of ham Shem and Jeff is the
[1:14:15] three sons of Noah and she said then
[1:14:17] they come and worship the Lord Jesus
[1:14:19] Christ
[1:14:20] and said when they departed said they
[1:14:23] brought gifts and put to him and said
[1:14:25] Jesus Christ said in his ministry that
[1:14:28] when this gospel has been preached to
[1:14:30] all the world ham Shem and Jeff is
[1:14:33] people then he would come again
[1:14:35] and she said now those planets Heavenly
[1:14:38] planets as they move around so they
[1:14:39] separated they've never been on the
[1:14:41] earth since no one but said ever so many
[1:14:44] hundred years they cross their Cycles
[1:14:46] like this if they have to be astronomer
[1:14:49] here you might know what she thought
[1:14:50] about I don't so when she talked it said
[1:14:53] they crossed like that and said in
[1:14:54] commemoration of the greatest gift that
[1:14:56] was ever given to mankind when God gave
[1:14:59] his son when these planets cross
[1:15:01] themselves again well I said he sends
[1:15:03] another gift to the Earth and said you
[1:15:06] were born on the crossing at that time
[1:15:10] and I said that's the reason I knew it
[1:15:13] eventually I said lady the first place I
[1:15:16] don't believe anything about it I'm not
[1:15:19] religious and I don't want to hear no
[1:15:20] more about it walked away and so I cut
[1:15:23] her off pretty sharp so I went on out
[1:15:25] and every time I get around one of them
[1:15:27] that's the way it would be and I thought
[1:15:28] why does them Devils do that then the
[1:15:31] preacher's saying that's the devil
[1:15:32] that's the devil they had me believe in
[1:15:34] it and then that night up there when I
[1:15:36] when he referred to that I asked him I
[1:15:38] said well why is it all them mediums and
[1:15:40] things like that and then devil possess
[1:15:42] people that always tell me about it and
[1:15:44] the clergy that my brother and tell me
[1:15:46] that it's of the evil spirit now listen
[1:15:48] to what he said this one who's hanging
[1:15:51] over there in the picture
[1:15:53] he said as it was then so is it now
[1:15:58] and he began to refer to me that when
[1:16:00] the ministry
[1:16:02] of our Lord Jesus Christ begin to take
[1:16:05] place the ministers said he was the
[1:16:08] elves above the devil
[1:16:10] but the Devils said he was the Son of
[1:16:13] God the Holy One of Israel
[1:16:16] devils and look at Paul and Barnabas
[1:16:19] when he's up there preaching the
[1:16:21] minister said these men turned the world
[1:16:23] upside down they were evil they're
[1:16:25] they're the devil and a little old
[1:16:27] fortune teller out on the street
[1:16:28] recognize that Paul and barnes's man of
[1:16:31] God said they're a man of God who tell
[1:16:32] us the way of life
[1:16:34] is that right yeah spiritualists and
[1:16:37] soothsayers
[1:16:39] demon-possessed people but we get so
[1:16:42] soured down on theology so we don't know
[1:16:45] nothing about the spirit
[1:16:48] I hope you love me after this
[1:16:51] but that's what it is I mean Pentecost
[1:16:53] too
[1:16:54] that's right
[1:16:56] just shouting and dancing around doesn't
[1:16:58] mean you know anything about the spirit
[1:17:00] it's personal contact face to face
[1:17:04] that's what you need that's the kind of
[1:17:07] church God speaks in the raise up
[1:17:09] that's right when they come together in
[1:17:10] unit in power
[1:17:12] spirit
[1:17:14] and he referred to that and he told me
[1:17:16] how that the ministry misunderstood it
[1:17:19] and assured me that the ministry had
[1:17:21] misunderstood it and when he told me all
[1:17:24] about this and how did Jesus I said well
[1:17:26] what about this these things that
[1:17:28] happened to me he sees that'll multiply
[1:17:30] and get greater and greater
[1:17:33] and he referred to me tell me how Jesus
[1:17:35] did it how did he come and he was
[1:17:37] possessed with the power that could
[1:17:39] foreign old things and tell the women at
[1:17:41] the well claim not to be a Healer claim
[1:17:44] to do those things just as the father
[1:17:45] showed him I said well what kind of
[1:17:47] spirit would that be said it was the
[1:17:49] Holy Spirit
[1:17:53] there's something there happened inside
[1:17:56] of me that I realized that the very
[1:17:59] thing that I turned my back on was what
[1:18:01] God brought me here for and I realized
[1:18:03] that it was just like those Pharisees
[1:18:05] and the days gone by they had
[1:18:07] misinterpreted the scripture to me so
[1:18:09] from then on I took my own
[1:18:11] interpretation of it what the holy
[1:18:13] spirit said I told him I'd go he said
[1:18:15] I'll be with you
[1:18:17] and the angel stepped into the light
[1:18:19] again they'll begin to come around
[1:18:21] around and around around his feet like
[1:18:23] that went up into the light and went out
[1:18:24] of the building I went home a new person
[1:18:28] walked over to the church and told
[1:18:29] people about it the on Sunday night and
[1:18:32] on the Wednesday night they brought a
[1:18:33] woman there one of males nurses dying

[1:20:12] went out down to Texas across the world
[1:20:15] and one night on about four or five
[1:20:17] times out I couldn't understand uh
[1:20:20] speaking in tongues and so forth I
[1:20:22] believed in the baptism of the Holy
[1:20:24] Spirit believe that people could speak
[1:20:26] in tongues one night when I was walking
[1:20:27] out onto the in a cathedral San Antonio
[1:20:30] Texas walking out there a little fella
[1:20:33] setting up here beginning to speak in
[1:20:34] tongues like a shotgun firing or a
[1:20:37] machine gun rapidly way back way back
[1:20:39] there fellow raise up and said
[1:20:42] thus saith the Lord
[1:20:45] the man is walking to the platform is
[1:20:48] going forward with a Ministry that was
[1:20:51] ordained of almighty God and if John the
[1:20:53] Baptist was sent as a first Forerunner
[1:20:56] of the coming of Jesus Christ so he
[1:20:58] packs a message that'll cause a second
[1:21:00] coming of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:21:02] I like this sunk in my shoes I looked up
[1:21:05] I said do you know that man he said no
[1:21:07] sir

[1:21:11] said do you know me he said no sir I
[1:21:13] said what are you doing here I said I
[1:21:14] read in the paper and this is as the
[1:21:15] first night of the meeting I looked over
[1:21:17] there and I said how'd you come here

[1:21:21] was going to be here a Divine healer and
[1:21:23] I come I said don't you all know one
[1:21:24] another
[1:21:25] he said no
[1:21:28] there are scenes that the very power of
[1:21:32] the holy spirit for one time back there
[1:21:34] I thought it was wrong and I know that I
[1:21:37] was this same angel of God was
[1:21:39] associated with them people
[1:21:41] that had those things although they had
[1:21:44] frowning a lot of mix up and a lot of
[1:21:46] dampling in it but in there was a
[1:21:48] genuine article
[1:21:53] brother Billy told me that after these
[1:21:56] meetings brother Billy Paul is brother
[1:21:59] Branham the one that was speaking his
[1:22:01] son
[1:22:02] he used to drive him around
[1:22:04] after the meetings and he like brother
[1:22:06] Branham says in this um in this tape and
[1:22:10] he says brother Branham would be still
[1:22:12] praying for the people in the car
[1:22:14] still still
[1:22:16] asking the Lord for mercy and praying
[1:22:19] for them and then he said when he'd come
[1:22:22] to
[1:22:23] but the Billy told me he said
[1:22:26] usually he'd say Billy
[1:22:29] did the people get healed
[1:22:31] did the people get blessed
[1:22:34] so he was concerned with the people I
[1:22:37] got to uh

[1:33:52] streaming in or whoever's gonna see this
[1:33:54] video I want them to hear this brother
[1:33:56] go ahead
[1:33:58] that was about the time of the year my
[1:34:02] dad in all our lives told us that when
[1:34:04] my mom was in the prayer line that he we
[1:34:07] were in Lane he was in Lane Tech a high
[1:34:09] school but he was wrong according to the
[1:34:11] tapes he was in the field she was in the
[1:34:13] Philadelphia church but he was in the
[1:34:15] balcony when that man he told us the
[1:34:17] story about the man with the cigars in
[1:34:19] his coat pocket and the best pocket and
[1:34:22] I I reached though I told him I said
[1:34:25] told me about this
[1:34:27] and uh for 20 years we didn't listen to
[1:34:30] brother Brown we didn't even have his
[1:34:32] tapes right Mary we didn't listen to him
[1:34:34] about maybe in the mid 70s we started
[1:34:38] listening to we break every Sunday up in
[1:34:41] what listen to brother Brown I'm on this
[1:34:43] between the morning and evening service

[1:35:03] search amen pray for your teeth he's
[1:35:05] talking to my mom and here we have a
[1:35:07] witness and I I thought it was great
[1:35:10] when brother random was calling out the
[1:35:11] guy and he said he says you've got to
[1:35:13] quit smoking those dirty things and he
[1:35:16] said in fact he said you got him in your
[1:35:19] pocket and now brother Arnie we have a

[1:35:27] true they are true in the same God that
[1:35:31] was here 60 70 years ago is the same God
[1:35:36] that is alive today and he does the same
[1:35:40] things and this man that came he was to
[1:35:44] show us that the power of God is real
[1:35:47] and to get our hearts ready for the
[1:35:51] second coming of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:35:53] and it will be here soon
