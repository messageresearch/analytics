[45:38] put on your strength
[45:40] put on
[45:41] your strength we're going to read two
[45:43] scriptures the first one is going to be
[45:44] in judges then we'll turn to isaiah
[45:47] chapter 52 judges chapter 13. let's just
[45:49] skip down all the way down
[45:51] and we'll just begin reading
[45:54] at the at the sixth verse let's actually
[45:57] let's just start we'll just begin
[45:58] reading at verse 3
[46:00] and the angel of the lord appeared unto
[46:02] the woman and said unto her behold now
[46:04] thou art bear and embarrass not but thou
[46:06] shalt conceive and bear a son now
[46:08] therefore beware i pray thee and drink
[46:10] not wine nor strong drink and eat not
[46:12] any unclean thing for lo
[46:15] thou shalt conceive and bear a son no
[46:17] razor shall come upon his head for the
[46:19] child shall be a nazarite unto god from
[46:21] the womb notice i'm only reading this
[46:24] just for context we'll reference samson
[46:26] we're not going to preach on him tonight
[46:28] but i just want to key in on a few
[46:30] things we read here
[46:32] in verse 5. notice this he shall be a
[46:34] nazarite unto god
[46:36] from
[46:37] the womb and he shall begin to deliver
[46:40] israel out of the hand of the
[46:42] philistines then the woman came and told
[46:44] her husband saying a man of god came
[46:46] unto me and his countenance was like the
[46:49] countenance of an angel of god very
[46:50] terrible but i asked him not once he was
[46:53] neither told me his name
[46:55] and he said and she repeats everything
[46:56] that he says and let's just read it here
[46:58] but he said unto me behold thou shalt
[47:00] conceive and bear a son and now drink no
[47:03] wine nor strong drink neither eat any
[47:05] unclean thing for the child shall be a
[47:08] nazarite to god
[47:10] from the womb
[47:12] to the day of his death
[47:14] so that covers
[47:16] everything
[47:18] from the womb
[47:19] all the way unto his death isaiah 52
[47:23] turn there with me quickly if you could
[47:24] and we'll have you be seated isaiah 52
[47:27] and we're going to read something here i
[47:28] just want to take a context or
[47:31] a title from you're going to
[47:34] you're going to read
[47:44] awake
[47:46] and he repeats it
[47:48] awake
[47:50] put on thy strength
[47:53] o zion
[47:55] put on thy beautiful garments o
[47:57] jerusalem the holy city
[48:00] for henceforth there shall no more come
[48:03] into thee the uncircumcised
[48:05] and the unclean shake thyself
[48:09] from the dust arise
[48:11] and sit down o jerusalem
[48:14] loose thyself from the bands of thy neck
[48:17] old captive daughter of zion
[48:20] for thus saith the lord you have sowed
[48:22] yourself for naught and you shall be
[48:24] redeemed without money for thus saith
[48:26] the lord god my people went down a four
[48:29] time into egypt to sojourn there in the
[48:31] assyrian oppress them without
[48:34] calls lord we give you thanks for the
[48:37] reading of your word we're already
[48:39] lord blessed just by reading it
[48:42] for truly lord it's more than just a
[48:44] book
[48:45] it's not like a newspaper lord it's not
[48:47] just a novel that we could pick up and
[48:49] be entertained by
[48:51] lord but it's a living book
[48:53] it's one that controls everything that
[48:55] happens in our daily life
[48:57] everything that happens
[48:59] from the cradle to the grave
[49:01] lord it also is controlling everything
[49:03] that happens in the world around us
[49:06] lord and we believe father we're
[49:08] believers of it tonight and lord we
[49:10] believe that it's relevant
[49:12] that it applies to our life our daily
[49:14] life and god i pray that you would come
[49:16] and make the word live lord make it real
[49:19] to your children lord for any sick
[49:21] that's amongst us lord or those that may
[49:23] be at home lord i pray that you would
[49:25] touch them in a special way lord for any
[49:28] of those that are bound or afflicted
[49:30] here god i pray that you'd set them free
[49:32] tonight made tonight lord be a night of
[49:35] freedom for your children lord i pray
[49:37] god as we've re read these words now god
[49:40] may you come and give the unction give
[49:42] the anointing lord and make may your
[49:45] word lord just have free reign in our
[49:47] hearts we give you liberty just now in
[49:50] the name of jesus christ and the church
[49:52] says
[49:53] amen you can be seated awake
[49:56] put on your strength o zion i want you
[49:59] to hold your place there
[50:00] in isaiah 52 and i just want to bring
[50:03] you right where i'm at here so that we
[50:05] know that it's a sunday night and we
[50:06] don't want to keep you too long but just
[50:08] want to minister what the lord put upon
[50:10] our heart knowing he just brought us in
[50:12] this direction
[50:14] i'm going to look at the life of jacob
[50:17] here and we read something about samson
[50:19] that's going to give context to jacob's
[50:21] life but i want to
[50:23] parallel this back to isaiah 52 when
[50:26] he's speaking to the captive daughter of
[50:28] zion and he's saying in this con
[50:31] condition that israel is in that she's
[50:34] like a captive daughter she's laying in
[50:37] the dirt she's groveling
[50:39] on the ground and god comes with a word
[50:42] to this child that's bound and she's
[50:44] afflicted and she's uh she's she's as
[50:47] the bible says that the philistines are
[50:49] coming in and there she's a mockery and
[50:52] the bible now remember this is not
[50:54] jezebel's daughter that's laying on the
[50:56] ground this is the daughter of zion this
[50:58] is the daughter of the lord and god
[51:00] comes with the word and he says awake
[51:03] put on your strength o zion in other
[51:06] words this isn't who you are
[51:09] israel this isn't who i made you to be
[51:13] this is not the real you as we spoke of
[51:16] this morning
[51:17] and he says pick yourself up put on your
[51:19] beautiful garment so apparently whatever
[51:21] they had on was tattered and torn and
[51:24] dusty and and god is speaking to them
[51:27] saying put on your beautiful garments
[51:30] and now what a pitiful sight that she's
[51:33] in
[51:34] the redeemed of the lord
[51:36] once stood in beauty and once stood in
[51:38] honor and glory and now she's on the
[51:41] ground and she's in it you could say it
[51:43] this way that she was in a r in a rut
[51:46] she was in a ditch she couldn't go
[51:48] forward she couldn't get up she was just
[51:51] laying there
[51:52] and groveling on the ground what a
[51:55] pitiful sight and the bible says she's
[51:58] clutching
[51:59] at the yoke that's upon her neck she's
[52:02] she's in bondage and and the bible says
[52:05] release yourself or set yourself free
[52:09] uh loose yourself from the bonds of your
[52:13] neck o captive daughter of zion
[52:16] and so then you notice here this
[52:18] condition that she comes into and and
[52:21] it's a it's a it's a horrible place you
[52:24] could say she's in a horrible condition
[52:26] but i want you to notice
[52:28] the the loving words of a kind heavenly
[52:31] father to a child who has enslaved
[52:35] themself now
[52:36] make no mistake god didn't put her here
[52:39] and not even the devil put her here but
[52:42] she put herself and many times you come
[52:46] under bondage and you come under
[52:47] affliction and it's at your own hands
[52:52] that's why the apostle paul says be not
[52:54] entangled again with the yoke of bondage
[52:57] wherewith christ has set you free
[53:00] you did run well what did hinder you oh
[53:03] foolish galatians notice all of these
[53:05] times where you come up and you're
[53:08] you maybe you could say that they were
[53:10] on a high and then they come down to a
[53:12] low and the bible says here that he says
[53:15] awake awake this is the words of a
[53:18] heavenly father awake and put on your
[53:21] strength
[53:23] put on your strength this isn't who you
[53:25] are
[53:27] you've got to recognize that you're a
[53:29] daughter of the king and you don't
[53:31] belong
[53:32] on the ground
[53:34] you don't belong bound
[53:36] didn't save you so that you could live
[53:38] in bondage i saved you so that you could
[53:41] be free
[53:43] free from sin
[53:45] free from yourself free from pride free
[53:47] from complex free from fear
[53:50] hello
[53:52] free from anything whatever you need
[53:54] freedom
[53:55] for whatever you need freedom from
[53:56] tonight god has freedom for you whoever
[53:59] the son sets free the bible says is free
[54:02] indeed in other words he's free of
[54:04] everything
[54:07] and he says here awake put on your
[54:09] strength
[54:11] put on your beautiful
[54:14] garments
[54:15] what a condition he says here put on
[54:18] your beautiful garment notice there's no
[54:20] rebuke
[54:22] there's no chastisement in his voice
[54:25] there's no condemnation there's no
[54:28] taking back of his love for his child
[54:33] there's no taking back of his mercy let
[54:37] me say this god never takes back his
[54:40] mercy
[54:42] people forsake their own mercy that's
[54:45] why that book of i think it's the book
[54:46] of isaiah says you have forsaken your
[54:48] own mercy but god never
[54:51] withdraws his promise
[54:54] oh i'm so glad for that here tonight he
[54:57] never withdraws his promise that means
[55:00] it's always available to you it's always
[55:04] just a prayer away his promise is always
[55:08] available to you
[55:12] he never withdraws his mercy he never
[55:14] withdraws his promise he never abandons
[55:19] his children
[55:21] never i don't care what the devil's lied
[55:23] to you and told you god's abandoned you
[55:24] he's never abandoned his children
[55:28] notice the lord this is this is how god
[55:30] responds
[55:31] and this is this is what the bible says
[55:33] here in isaiah it says when the
[55:35] afflicted daughter of zion she says the
[55:37] lord
[55:38] hath forsaken me this is isaiah 49 the
[55:42] lord
[55:43] hath
[55:44] forsaken me no notice how god responds
[55:47] to this in isaiah 49
[55:49] verse 14 brother jordan you can put it
[55:51] on the screen this is the way that god
[55:53] replies
[55:55] to this statement god has forsaken me
[55:59] can a woman notice the bible the zion
[56:01] has said the lord has forsaken me my
[56:03] lord hath forgotten me verse 15.
[56:07] can a woman zion said yet verse 15 can a
[56:10] woman forget her suckling child that she
[56:13] should not have compassion on the son of
[56:15] her womb yea
[56:18] yea they may
[56:20] forget
[56:22] yet i will not forget thee
[56:26] behold i have graven thee upon the palms
[56:30] of my hands
[56:32] thy walls are continually
[56:36] before me
[56:37] notice this this word here and i know
[56:39] we've covered this here in in months
[56:41] past but i just want to revisit it here
[56:43] just for a moment for the sermon
[56:45] thy walls notice i've graven thee upon
[56:48] the palms of my hands thy walls
[56:52] are continually
[56:54] before me that wall
[56:56] is the hebrew word shoma i may not be
[56:59] pronouncing that right but i just want
[57:00] to give you the definition for this word
[57:03] it literally means to be joined to a
[57:06] wall it's amazing how alone we feel in
[57:10] our personal battles and our personal
[57:12] struggles satan will if he can give you
[57:14] any feeling he'll make you feel that
[57:16] you're all by yourself and you're all
[57:19] alone and you're isolated all to
[57:21] yourself and nobody's going to come for
[57:23] you has he ever made you feel that way
[57:25] if you could ever pour it on like the
[57:27] prophet of god says when satan gets you
[57:29] down that's when he really throws on the
[57:31] punches and if he could ever get sell
[57:33] you a lie it'll be that god has forsaken
[57:36] you you're isolated you're abandoned
[57:39] you're all alone in your struggle god
[57:41] has left you because he's angry at you
[57:46] and he's left you to battle the enemy
[57:48] all by yourself
[57:50] and it's so incredible how a son of god
[57:53] a believer
[57:54] can get a deformed distorted thinking
[57:57] like this about god
[57:58] it's a vain imagination
[58:02] but god's word says the contrary
[58:06] i will
[58:07] not
[58:08] forget you
[58:10] let me go further i cannot forget you
[58:14] hallelujah
[58:16] i've graven you on the palms of my hands
[58:20] what a promise thy wolves
[58:24] the choma that's the word it literally
[58:26] means to be joined
[58:29] to a wall and that wall speaks of a
[58:31] prison wall captive wall of a captive
[58:34] i've joined myself
[58:37] to you
[58:38] in your captivity
[58:41] this is going to make sense here in a
[58:42] moment
[58:43] i've joined i've joined myself to you
[58:47] when i gave you a promise i want you to
[58:49] know i've not just verbally
[58:52] given you a promise but i've attached my
[58:55] life i've attached myself to you let me
[58:58] give you the new testament language for
[59:00] this same exact phrase
[59:03] i'm a high priest who can be touched by
[59:07] the feelings of your infirmities
[59:10] i'm a high priest who can be touched
[59:12] when you feel an infirmity i can fill it
[59:16] to when you feel despondent i can feel
[59:18] it too when you feel abandoned i can
[59:21] feel it too when you feel rejected i am
[59:24] a high priest who can be touched
[59:27] by the feelings of your infirmities
[59:30] hallelujah
[59:32] notice this man and i want you to turn
[59:34] to genesis 28 if you could you could you
[59:36] could if you have a bible i'd love for
[59:38] you to use them they have it here on the
[59:39] screen but i just believe we should be
[59:42] uh wearing our bibles out we should be
[59:44] replacing them every few years from worn
[59:47] pages amen
[59:51] genesis chapter 28 notice what god
[59:53] promises
[59:56] this man jacob now
[59:58] this is not a good man
[1:00:01] i want to get that clear he's not a good
[1:00:04] man esau's a much better man
[1:00:07] he's not a good man
[1:00:10] but if i could get away with saying this
[1:00:12] but he's god's man
[1:00:15] and many times god's man is not always
[1:00:18] at that moment a good man
[1:00:21] and jacob at this moment is not a good
[1:00:23] man he's a he's a the the bible uses the
[1:00:26] word in the prophet if god uses it he's
[1:00:28] a shyster he's a conniver he's a
[1:00:30] supplanter
[1:00:32] he's a deceiver he would even deceive
[1:00:34] his own father and he's a he's the kind
[1:00:37] of a man that when he's going to go
[1:00:39] before battle and he's when he's going
[1:00:41] to go from to it through a uh he's uh to
[1:00:44] a to an enemy a hostile enemy and he
[1:00:47] doesn't know he's going to cross over uh
[1:00:49] into this unknown territory he's the
[1:00:52] kind of man that says i'm not sure if
[1:00:54] this is an enemy if it's a foe or it's a
[1:00:57] friend so you know what i'm gonna do i'm
[1:00:59] gonna send my wife and children ahead of
[1:01:01] me
[1:01:02] to see if they get killed i'll know
[1:01:03] whether it's a foe or a friend
[1:01:07] well you can decide if you think he's a
[1:01:09] good man or not
[1:01:11] i'd say he's not a good man
[1:01:14] he's jacob and that's the problem
[1:01:18] this isn't
[1:01:20] the real you
[1:01:22] he's jacob
[1:01:24] and that's the problem
[1:01:27] notice here in genesis chapter uh where
[1:01:30] did i tell you to turn genesis 28. let's
[1:01:32] just read this together just for a
[1:01:33] moment i want you to notice this promise
[1:01:37] that god gives to this man
[1:01:40] and it's incredible you can see this
[1:01:42] that he was such a disobedient
[1:01:46] servant
[1:01:47] he was such a disobedient one who was
[1:01:50] anointed with the promise but him and
[1:01:53] his own selfishness
[1:01:54] and his own pride
[1:01:56] took his entire family down to rock
[1:01:59] bottom and you could call it rock bottom
[1:02:01] took him to disgrace
[1:02:04] because of his pride
[1:02:06] everybody but long before this record of
[1:02:09] jacob's
[1:02:10] struggles and all of his mistakes
[1:02:13] long before that jacob has a
[1:02:15] supernatural experience he has a
[1:02:18] powerful supernatural
[1:02:22] vision that god gives him it's in
[1:02:24] genesis chapter 28 and
[1:02:26] let's just begin reading here let me
[1:02:28] find my place
[1:02:30] let's just begin reading here at verse
[1:02:31] 11.
[1:02:32] and he lighted upon a certain place and
[1:02:35] tarried their own night because the sun
[1:02:37] was set
[1:02:38] and he took of the stones of that place
[1:02:40] and put them for his pillows
[1:02:42] and lay down in that place to sleep and
[1:02:45] he dreamed
[1:02:46] and behold a ladder
[1:02:49] set up on the earth
[1:02:51] and the top of it reached to heaven
[1:02:54] and behold the angels of god
[1:02:57] ascending
[1:02:59] and descending on it
[1:03:02] so what does god give jacob
[1:03:04] god gives jacob a very special
[1:03:08] look he gives them a very special peek
[1:03:11] he peers back the dimensional curtain in
[1:03:14] jacob's mind and jacob is going to peer
[1:03:16] into a a powerful picture and a powerful
[1:03:19] scene of a of a ladder a way of uh
[1:03:23] of of of communication between heaven
[1:03:26] and earth
[1:03:27] and jacob's dreaming all of this and he
[1:03:29] sees angels that are ascending and
[1:03:32] angels that are descending and angels
[1:03:34] that are ascending and angels that are
[1:03:37] descending listen friends
[1:03:39] that vision that jacob had if god could
[1:03:41] give you hit you'd get the same vision
[1:03:43] today if you laid your head at your
[1:03:45] pillow tonight and god opened your eyes
[1:03:48] you know what you would see you would
[1:03:50] see angels that are working constantly
[1:03:53] for your family for your children for
[1:03:56] your for your mind for your body for
[1:03:58] your health for your home for the
[1:04:00] believers
[1:04:01] the bible says those that fear the lord
[1:04:03] an angel uh uh encamps themselves angels
[1:04:07] and cabbed themselves around the family
[1:04:09] of god
[1:04:11] what are these elijah servant have
[1:04:12] trouble seeing oh he sees the armies on
[1:04:15] the hills and the prophet praise and
[1:04:16] says god open his eyes
[1:04:19] for they that are with us are more than
[1:04:22] they with them
[1:04:24] do you realize what what the bible's
[1:04:26] called
[1:04:27] jehovah calls him the the lord of hosts
[1:04:33] the lord of hosts i love the english
[1:04:36] translation for that it literally means
[1:04:38] the god of angel armies
[1:04:41] what a powerful name the god of angel
[1:04:45] armies this is what god is trying to get
[1:04:47] his family to understand that when you
[1:04:49] as the song says when you feel like
[1:04:51] you're surrounded i'm surrounded by you
[1:04:54] when i feel like i'm surrounded lord i'm
[1:04:57] surrounded by you
[1:04:59] jacob sees a ladder with angels going up
[1:05:02] and down and up and down what's god
[1:05:04] saying jacob i'm always working for your
[1:05:07] life
[1:05:11] even when it feels like you're not
[1:05:13] working
[1:05:14] you never stop working
[1:05:18] angels ascending and descending what a
[1:05:20] powerful vision notice here
[1:05:23] he says the the he he wakes up he sees
[1:05:26] this dream and verse 12 and the top of
[1:05:29] it reached to heaven and behaved behold
[1:05:30] the angels of god has sinned and sinning
[1:05:32] and behold the lord
[1:05:35] stood above it
[1:05:37] and said now notice the promise god
[1:05:40] gives to jacob
[1:05:42] the lord stood above it and said i am
[1:05:45] the lord god of abraham thy father and
[1:05:48] the god of isaac
[1:05:50] the land wherein thou liest to thee will
[1:05:53] i give it and to thy seed and thy seed
[1:05:56] shall be as the dust of the earth and
[1:05:59] thou shalt spread abroad to the west and
[1:06:02] to the east and to the north and to the
[1:06:05] south and in thee and in thy seed shall
[1:06:10] all the families of the earth be
[1:06:13] blessed
[1:06:15] what a promise
[1:06:17] god makes to what we would call a very
[1:06:22] bad
[1:06:23] man
[1:06:24] but i want you to notice because i
[1:06:26] preached to you this morning on the real
[1:06:27] you
[1:06:29] i want you to notice that there was more
[1:06:32] to jacob
[1:06:33] than just the shyster that we see
[1:06:37] but there was a seed gene of god down
[1:06:40] inside of him
[1:06:42] that was the real jacob
[1:06:45] and god predestinated
[1:06:48] that seed
[1:06:52] and the apostle paul picks it up in the
[1:06:53] new testament and says
[1:06:55] jacob have i loved esau have i hated
[1:07:01] and paul says and god
[1:07:03] made that choice
[1:07:05] before
[1:07:09] before
[1:07:11] either were born
[1:07:15] or either had done right
[1:07:18] or wrong
[1:07:21] you see the power of the true revelation
[1:07:23] of election
[1:07:25] when you are part of god's family god
[1:07:28] places a seed down inside of you
[1:07:31] and the potential of that seed let me
[1:07:34] say it this way the confidence that god
[1:07:37] has in that he doesn't have confidence
[1:07:39] in you or your flesh but he has
[1:07:41] confidence in the seed that he placed
[1:07:44] down inside of you that if it gets in
[1:07:46] the right atmosphere it'll bring forth
[1:07:48] the potential he put inside of it
[1:07:52] and god says before either had done
[1:07:54] wrong before either had sinned before he
[1:07:56] that had done right or wrong
[1:07:58] god says i've made that choice and paul
[1:08:00] says that election
[1:08:03] might stand
[1:08:05] god makes
[1:08:07] this
[1:08:08] man a promise
[1:08:10] and he says here notice
[1:08:12] here in verse 15
[1:08:14] and behold
[1:08:16] i
[1:08:17] am with
[1:08:18] thee
[1:08:20] what a powerful promise
[1:08:23] when god
[1:08:24] joins himself
[1:08:26] by covenant by a promise i am joined
[1:08:31] like like we just read the definition
[1:08:32] thy walls are continually before me i
[1:08:36] cannot forget thee by your graven unto
[1:08:38] that to my hands and to the palms of my
[1:08:41] hands i've joined myself to you behold
[1:08:44] jacob i am with thee
[1:08:48] and will
[1:08:49] keep thee
[1:08:52] in all the places
[1:08:56] all the turns
[1:08:58] all the u-turns
[1:09:00] all the left turns all the right turns
[1:09:06] i'll keep you in all the crossroads
[1:09:08] i'll keep you in all of the major times
[1:09:11] and all of the minor times i'll never
[1:09:14] leave you i'm making you a promise jacob
[1:09:17] and it's a powerful promise i'm with you
[1:09:20] and will keep you in all the places
[1:09:23] whether thou goest and will bring thee
[1:09:26] again into this land for i will not
[1:09:31] leave thee
[1:09:34] do you know that this is the same
[1:09:37] promise that is transferred to the new
[1:09:40] testament believer when jesus said i'll
[1:09:42] never leave you and i'll never forsake
[1:09:45] you you want to you ought to hit the
[1:09:47] devil in the face with that promise the
[1:09:49] next time he comes to you i've got a
[1:09:51] promise from my father he'll never leave
[1:09:53] me
[1:09:54] he'll never forsake me doesn't matter
[1:09:56] where i go he'll stay right by my side
[1:10:00] as paul says even when we're not
[1:10:02] faithful he remaineth
[1:10:05] faithful
[1:10:07] i love that
[1:10:08] until notice i will not leave thee
[1:10:11] until i have done that which i have
[1:10:14] spoken to thee of
[1:10:16] and jacob woke out of his sleep
[1:10:19] and said surely the lord is in this
[1:10:22] place
[1:10:23] and i knew it not verse 16.
[1:10:26] surely the lord is in this place
[1:10:29] verse 17 and he was afraid
[1:10:32] and said how dreadful that actually is
[1:10:34] not how you think it means awesome
[1:10:36] how how dreadful is this place there
[1:10:39] this is none other but the house of god
[1:10:43] and this is the gate of heaven
[1:10:46] joke of jacob rose up early in the
[1:10:48] morning and took the stone
[1:10:51] that he had put for his pillows and set
[1:10:53] it up for a pillar and poured oil what's
[1:10:56] he trying to do
[1:10:57] he's trying to memorialize something
[1:11:00] has happened
[1:11:02] something has taken place he's humanly
[1:11:05] he's trying to do anything he can just
[1:11:07] imagine you wake up out of this kind of
[1:11:10] a dream
[1:11:11] and and and then you have a promise i'll
[1:11:13] never leave you i'll uh until i've
[1:11:15] accomplished that until i've i've done
[1:11:17] that which i've spoken of jacob is is
[1:11:20] trying to do anything so he picks up the
[1:11:22] stones and he looks this is this is
[1:11:24] where my head was this is where i slept
[1:11:26] last night and he picks up the stones
[1:11:28] and he starts to place a memorial and
[1:11:30] then he takes some oil and he pours the
[1:11:33] oil over on top of it
[1:11:36] now you know a lot of people would look
[1:11:38] and say oh brother you're just getting
[1:11:40] emotional
[1:11:42] oh come on jacob you're just getting a
[1:11:44] little bit come on ain't you getting a
[1:11:46] little bit carried
[1:11:47] you know but later on you're going to
[1:11:48] find out when jacob did that god noticed
[1:11:51] what he did
[1:11:53] and god reminds him of what he did
[1:11:56] he said i'm the god of bethel when you
[1:11:58] anoint us the pillar
[1:11:59] when you made a monument when you made a
[1:12:01] memorial
[1:12:03] something took place
[1:12:05] something happened
[1:12:08] and jacob pours oil on the top of it
[1:12:10] verse 19 and he called the name of that
[1:12:14] place bethel
[1:12:17] he gives it a name
[1:12:20] anoints it he builds a he builds a
[1:12:23] monument you know when god
[1:12:25] does something for you
[1:12:28] you should mark it even if it's just in
[1:12:30] your mind you should mark it and put it
[1:12:33] in your pocket and every time the devil
[1:12:34] comes knocking and trying to lie to you
[1:12:36] you pull out and say no satan
[1:12:39] god met me and i'm positive of that i
[1:12:42] may not feel him right now but i know
[1:12:44] he's real
[1:12:45] and i know that you're a liar and you're
[1:12:47] a bluff
[1:12:51] and he calls the name of that place
[1:12:53] bethel
[1:12:55] jacob valdival verse 20 saying if god
[1:12:58] will be with me and will keep me in this
[1:13:00] way that i go
[1:13:01] and will give me bread to eat and rain
[1:13:03] it to put on so that i come again to my
[1:13:05] father's house in peace
[1:13:07] then shall the lord be my god and this
[1:13:09] stone which i have set for a pillar
[1:13:13] shall be god's house
[1:13:15] and of all that thou shalt give me i
[1:13:18] will surely give the tenth
[1:13:20] unto thee this is a special
[1:13:23] experience
[1:13:25] jacob has
[1:13:27] special experiences god
[1:13:30] gives him this dream and you know what
[1:13:32] this is a powerful
[1:13:34] powerful vision
[1:13:36] that helps jacob no doubt for the rest
[1:13:38] of his life
[1:13:40] he could draw back from this dream you
[1:13:43] know i reminded so much of god's prophet
[1:13:45] when he's laying his head on his bed and
[1:13:48] he says my hands behind my head and just
[1:13:50] and they're sitting in that room and the
[1:13:52] butt and brother adam says and the voice
[1:13:54] spoke the voice angel of the lord spoke
[1:13:56] to me and said would you like to look
[1:13:59] just beyond the curtain
[1:14:02] and brother branham says oh
[1:14:04] it would help me so much
[1:14:08] and god opens back that dimension just
[1:14:10] as he did for jacob and god opens up the
[1:14:13] curtain of time
[1:14:14] and you know what let me just say this
[1:14:16] he went to a real place he's seen real
[1:14:19] people it wasn't a figment of his
[1:14:21] imagination it was appearing into
[1:14:23] another dimension and when he said it
[1:14:25] would help me so much let me echo that
[1:14:27] to you it helps me so much it helps you
[1:14:31] so much it helps you and your family
[1:14:33] today to know that just beyond this
[1:14:35] mortal realm that they call time is a
[1:14:38] place without pain without sorrow
[1:14:41] without sadness without pressure without
[1:14:44] stress oh are you going there church i'm
[1:14:46] so glad to live within a with a reality
[1:14:49] that it's really
[1:14:51] real
[1:14:52] brother madam says do whatever you got
[1:14:53] to do but don't
[1:14:55] miss that place
[1:14:57] lay aside everything
[1:15:04] jacob has this powerful dream
[1:15:09] and you know what happens
[1:15:12] 20
[1:15:13] years
[1:15:14] go by
[1:15:16] like that man time just flashes by
[1:15:21] 20 long years of jacob's life
[1:15:25] following this powerful
[1:15:28] experience
[1:15:30] that god does for him
[1:15:32] and 20
[1:15:33] long
[1:15:34] years
[1:15:35] 20 years of trial
[1:15:38] sorrow
[1:15:40] disobedience
[1:15:45] calamity
[1:15:47] that jacob brings upon himself
[1:15:49] god says go left jacob goes right
[1:15:53] god says stop
[1:15:55] jacob goes forward
[1:15:57] god says turn around jacob keeps going
[1:16:01] 20
[1:16:02] long years
[1:16:04] of disobedience you know you can spend a
[1:16:06] long time
[1:16:09] in disobedience
[1:16:12] he spends 20 long years
[1:16:14] of trial
[1:16:16] and sorrow
[1:16:17] disobedience and sinfulness
[1:16:21] and loose
[1:16:22] laxadaisical
[1:16:24] living lukewarm living
[1:16:28] but you know what
[1:16:30] god was with jacob the whole time
[1:16:35] you know why
[1:16:36] because he was joined to jacob
[1:16:39] he never left him
[1:16:42] he stayed with him
[1:16:44] after leaving bethel jacob settles down
[1:16:48] and instead of being more spiritual
[1:16:50] instead of
[1:16:51] instead of rising and ascending jacob
[1:16:55] does the very opposite
[1:16:57] it becomes cold
[1:16:59] he becomes backslid he becomes very
[1:17:02] carnal in his nature
[1:17:04] god speaks to him again notice in
[1:17:06] genesis chapter 31 if you just turn two
[1:17:08] two chapters over genesis chapter 31
[1:17:11] notice god appears to jacob again
[1:17:15] and he speaks to him and i want you to
[1:17:17] notice here in genesis chapter 31 and
[1:17:20] let's just begin reading it at verse 13.
[1:17:25] and i god here's what god says to jacob
[1:17:27] i
[1:17:28] am the god of bethel
[1:17:31] where thou anoint us the pillar
[1:17:34] and where thou vow to vow unto me
[1:17:37] now arise
[1:17:40] get thee out from this land
[1:17:43] and return
[1:17:44] unto the land of thy kindred it's almost
[1:17:48] just like what he says to that captive
[1:17:50] daughter of zion awake
[1:17:53] stand up
[1:17:54] get up
[1:17:56] stand up put on your strength
[1:17:58] put on your beautiful garments what are
[1:18:00] you doing down here jacob what are you
[1:18:02] doing for years he goes and years and
[1:18:06] years passes by and year passes by
[1:18:09] five years and then 10 years
[1:18:13] and you say
[1:18:14] surely god you
[1:18:16] surely after five years
[1:18:19] surely you gave up right
[1:18:23] sort of like samson's life god appears
[1:18:26] to manoah his wife you have a son and
[1:18:29] deliver the philistines he'll be a
[1:18:31] nazarite unto god

[1:18:40] share something with you that's that is
[1:18:42] that is uh so true in your life and in
[1:18:46] my life in the life of jacob and the
[1:18:48] life of samson let me just say this when
[1:18:50] god sets his purpose
[1:18:53] upon a life
[1:18:55] nothing
[1:18:56] changes
[1:18:57] that purpose
[1:19:00] not even samson was going to shake the
[1:19:03] purpose of god when god
[1:19:06] gave a promise i want you to notice this
[1:19:09] god didn't wait for samson to be born to
[1:19:12] grow up get past adolescence become a
[1:19:15] man give his heart to god start serving
[1:19:17] jehovah and then god goes uh-huh you

[1:19:21] character right here you know what yep
[1:19:23] that's him that's it that's the got

[1:19:33] gonna appear to sampson and say samson
[1:19:34] i've got a special mission for you no
[1:19:37] no
[1:19:38] before samson's even born
[1:19:41] god makes a promise
[1:19:44] before samson before you ever open your
[1:19:47] bible and turn to judges and start
[1:19:50] reading about the life of samson there's
[1:19:52] already an eternal unchanging
[1:19:55] unstoppable purpose
[1:19:57] that god has put over samson's life
[1:20:00] and no matter where samson goes no
[1:20:03] matter what he does that purpose
[1:20:06] follows
[1:20:08] his life
[1:20:12] oh that's powerful
[1:20:14] it doesn't matter
[1:20:16] where or what samson does
[1:20:18] there's a promise
[1:20:20] over his life in other words god says
[1:20:23] i've already charted your course
[1:20:27] before you ever
[1:20:29] breathe your first breath
[1:20:32] i've charted from the beginning
[1:20:37] to the middle
[1:20:39] to almost to the end
[1:20:41] to the very end
[1:20:43] i've charted the whole thing
[1:20:46] i've mapped it all out
[1:20:48] i've blueprinted your entire
[1:20:51] life
[1:20:52] samson
[1:20:54] now what's up to samson
[1:20:56] is that he surrenders his will
[1:21:00] to the will of him who
[1:21:01] created him
[1:21:05] i've charted your entire life and it
[1:21:08] doesn't matter
[1:21:10] what happens
[1:21:12] i'm going to be with you from the birth
[1:21:15] all the way to
[1:21:17] your
[1:21:19] death
[1:21:20] all the way from the cradle
[1:21:23] to the grave same promise for jacob
[1:21:26] i'll never leave you i'll be with you
[1:21:29] in all the places notice how god
[1:21:31] promises him i'll be with you
[1:21:33] in all the places but not all the places
[1:21:36] that jacob goes is where god told him to
[1:21:39] go
[1:21:41] not all the terms that he makes are what
[1:21:43] god told him to make
[1:21:45] but you know what when god said go left
[1:21:47] and jacob went right god went right to
[1:21:51] and jacob followed god jehovah followed
[1:21:54] his life
[1:21:55] and he appears
[1:21:57] jacob
[1:21:58] arise
[1:21:59] go back to bethel
[1:22:01] notice
[1:22:03] go back
[1:22:04] to where i touched you
[1:22:06] go back to where i spoke to you
[1:22:09] go back to where you made your promise
[1:22:12] to me
[1:22:13] go back to the altar where where you met
[1:22:15] me where you vowed a vow where you
[1:22:17] created a monument where you created a
[1:22:20] memorial and you poured oil over
[1:22:22] remember that jacob i'm the god of that
[1:22:25] i'm not the god of this
[1:22:28] i'm not forsaking you i'm not turning my
[1:22:31] back on you i'm not leaving you i'm
[1:22:33] going to stay right beside you i'm never
[1:22:36] going to quit on you i'm never going to
[1:22:38] forsake you i'm just going to keep
[1:22:40] giving you my word i'm going to keep
[1:22:42] reminding you of my word i'm going to
[1:22:44] keep coming and admonishing you to get
[1:22:46] back up jacob
[1:22:53] go back jacob
[1:22:55] remember all your promises
[1:22:59] so brother matt
[1:23:01] surely
[1:23:02] after that
[1:23:03] jacob finally stood up
[1:23:07] and he went back no he stood up
[1:23:10] but he just kept going
[1:23:13] jacob in genesis 33 turned their two
[1:23:15] chapters over
[1:23:19] he settles in this place called shechem
[1:23:23] and it's incredible because in hebrew
[1:23:26] the town
[1:23:27] shechem means
[1:23:29] going back not going back to bethel
[1:23:32] but going back or backsliding
[1:23:37] and it also means a place
[1:23:40] of burdens
[1:23:41] you know
[1:23:42] when you're out of the will of god when
[1:23:44] you disobey what the lord has told you
[1:23:46] do you know what place you go to you go
[1:23:48] to the place of burdens
[1:23:52] heavy burdens
[1:23:55] and shechem he's going to come into all
[1:23:57] kinds of trouble
[1:24:00] his house is going to become dishonored
[1:24:02] his daughter
[1:24:03] dina
[1:24:05] is going to become defiled
[1:24:07] by a boy from shechem now it's
[1:24:09] incredible because god
[1:24:11] never told him to go to shechem
[1:24:14] he taught him to go to bethel
[1:24:17] don't go to shechem
[1:24:20] around jacob go back but instead jacob
[1:24:23] settles down
[1:24:25] in a place of burdens
[1:24:28] what's the trouble
[1:24:29] with brother jacob
[1:24:31] you know what the trouble is he's jacob
[1:24:35] that's the trouble
[1:24:37] remember what we read today the number
[1:24:39] one enemy you got
[1:24:41] is you
[1:24:44] so don't be you
[1:24:46] you know what i'm referring to don't be
[1:24:47] you be the real you
[1:24:50] and the problem with jacob is as long as
[1:24:52] he's jacob the pattern will never change
[1:24:57] as long as he's jacob it'll never change
[1:25:00] but you know what god will never quit
[1:25:02] and he'll never walk away
[1:25:05] god you gave up to him surely lord after
[1:25:07] this i mean he's defiled his how he's
[1:25:11] shamed his house his daughters raped and
[1:25:14] now your boys have to go and rescue her
[1:25:16] and they end up becoming murderers
[1:25:20] all because
[1:25:22] jacob
[1:25:24] disobeys the lord
[1:25:27] and calamity and collateral damage
[1:25:30] follow the life of disobedience much
[1:25:34] like samson's life if you could chart it
[1:25:36] and pattern samson's life the trouble
[1:25:38] that he brings upon his entire home and
[1:25:40] his entire family because he never
[1:25:43] surrenders
[1:25:45] he never surrenders he just continues
[1:25:48] with a promise
[1:25:50] he's content with an anointing he's
[1:25:53] content with a promise
[1:25:56] but he never changes
[1:26:00] and he barrels over
[1:26:02] warning after warning after warning
[1:26:05] after warning after warning
[1:26:07] mother father samson
[1:26:10] why do you have to go and get a wife
[1:26:12] from the daughter of the philistines is
[1:26:14] there not a girl amongst our own people
[1:26:19] you know samson says
[1:26:21] get her for me to wife for she pleaseth
[1:26:25] me well
[1:26:30] and you know what happens calamity
[1:26:33] and trouble
[1:26:34] and problems and strife
[1:26:38] and destruction
[1:26:40] he wakes up in the middle of the night
[1:26:42] in gaza conviction falls upon his heart
[1:26:44] he's in a mess he's in trouble
[1:26:47] god comes on the scene delivers him you
[1:26:49] know what you know what you notice as
[1:26:50] you notice a pattern
[1:26:53] you notice a pattern of this
[1:26:55] repentance or the sorrow
[1:26:58] that comes upon his life but not real
[1:27:00] true repentance because the bible says
[1:27:02] true god godly sorrow brings forth
[1:27:05] repentance
[1:27:09] but you watch a life that
[1:27:11] that is quick to say i'm sorry
[1:27:13] but never
[1:27:15] changes
[1:27:16] never changes
[1:27:18] this continues going down the same path
[1:27:20] getting the same results
[1:27:23] mom and dad the preacher tries to stop
[1:27:25] in the pastor isn't it incredible how a
[1:27:27] person would get into a vehicle and and
[1:27:30] go down a road and and there's there's
[1:27:32] barricades
[1:27:34] in that road saying don't go this way
[1:27:36] stop flashing lights road closed block
[1:27:40] box signs and barricades and flashing
[1:27:43] lights what kind of person would get in
[1:27:45] their vehicle and just bust over
[1:27:47] barricade and bust over sandbags and
[1:27:49] barrels flying everywhere and flashing
[1:27:51] lights turn around wrong way do not
[1:27:54] enter
[1:27:57] and they would just barrel right through
[1:27:59] every single one of them
[1:28:01] you say oh i would never brother matt i
[1:28:04] would never do that but how many warning
[1:28:07] signs does god
[1:28:08] bring in our life
[1:28:11] and we just barrel right over and right
[1:28:13] over and right over
[1:28:16] and we just continue to go and continue
[1:28:18] to go and continue to go
[1:28:23] arise go back to bethel
[1:28:28] jacob's house is defiled
[1:28:31] we don't want to get into it here
[1:28:32] tonight
[1:28:34] but notice what happens when god speaks
[1:28:37] to jacob
[1:28:39] about his choices
[1:28:41] and about what he does i want you to
[1:28:43] look in genesis 35
[1:28:45] genesis 35
[1:28:51] now we're going to read here
[1:28:54] the lord responding to jacob
[1:28:58] and i wonder
[1:29:01] if it was me
[1:29:04] who would respond
[1:29:06] to a man like this or you
[1:29:09] could respond to a man like this that
[1:29:12] has caused so much trouble
[1:29:14] and so much calamity and ruined his home
[1:29:17] and ruined his daughter and ruined his
[1:29:19] children how would we treat
[1:29:22] how would genesis 35 verse 1 read if it
[1:29:25] was us
[1:29:28] but i want you to notice how differently
[1:29:30] our kind heavenly father
[1:29:34] handles a situation
[1:29:36] than how we handle it you know god looks
[1:29:39] very often at things
[1:29:41] totally different than how you or me do
[1:29:44] you
[1:29:45] isaiah says for his ways are
[1:29:47] are higher god says my ways are higher
[1:29:50] than your ways as high as the heaven is
[1:29:52] from the earth so are my ways god
[1:29:54] oftentimes looks at a situation that
[1:29:57] you're looking at and you think you're
[1:29:58] looking at it correctly and righteously
[1:30:02] and it's totally different than how god
[1:30:03] sees it
[1:30:06] notice how god responds to jacob
[1:30:10] genesis 35 verse 1 and god said unto
[1:30:13] jacob
[1:30:14] arise
[1:30:16] go up to bethel
[1:30:19] wait whoa
[1:30:20] hold on god
[1:30:22] now that's good
[1:30:23] but let's talk about shechem first come
[1:30:26] on
[1:30:27] you got to mention something about dina
[1:30:29] you got to mention something about the
[1:30:31] mistakes you got to chastise him in some
[1:30:33] kind of way you've got to scold him lord
[1:30:35] you've noticed god never mentions any of
[1:30:38] that jacob knows what mess he's made for
[1:30:40] himself
[1:30:41] god never there's no there's no i'm
[1:30:44] giving up that's it i made up my mind
[1:30:47] you know what after this long jacob and
[1:30:49] you messed up this far you just ain't no
[1:30:51] you know what you know what jacob just
[1:30:53] forget it
[1:30:56] just forget
[1:30:57] i forget it forget i ever even made a
[1:31:00] promise
[1:31:02] i'm so glad that's not how god responds
[1:31:04] to jacob because that means that's not
[1:31:05] how he responds to me
[1:31:08] when i busted my head again and again
[1:31:10] and again and again and again and again
[1:31:12] and again
[1:31:13] god just comes back with the same word
[1:31:17] and the same encouragement
[1:31:19] arise child
[1:31:22] get up
[1:31:24] go back to bethel
[1:31:26] and dwell there
[1:31:28] and make there an altar unto god that
[1:31:31] appeared unto thee when thou flettest
[1:31:33] from the face
[1:31:34] of esau
[1:31:36] thy brother
[1:31:37] get up
[1:31:39] jacob
[1:31:40] you know what jacob does
[1:31:42] he gets up
[1:31:44] and the bible says
[1:31:46] he throws out all of his idols
[1:31:49] he throws out gathers up his entire
[1:31:51] family look at verse two if you could
[1:31:52] just keep reading here jacob said unto
[1:31:55] his household and to all that were with
[1:31:57] him put away the strange gods that are
[1:32:00] among you and be
[1:32:01] clean
[1:32:02] and change your garments
[1:32:08] and let us arise
[1:32:09] and go up finally

[1:32:30] distress
[1:32:31] and was with me in the way
[1:32:34] which i
[1:32:36] went
[1:32:38] god comes to jacob time and time and
[1:32:43] time and time again and now jacob gets
[1:32:47] up takes his family you know what he
[1:32:49] starts with
[1:32:50] repentance
[1:32:53] it must
[1:32:54] always
[1:32:56] start
[1:32:57] with repentance
[1:33:00] it must always i'm going to say it to
[1:33:03] you say amen it must always start with
[1:33:06] repentance
[1:33:09] a true turning back a cast in the side
[1:33:12] of my idols
[1:33:14] and it starts with building an altar
[1:33:17] and coming back
[1:33:19] to god notice this here
[1:33:21] awake awake

[1:33:44] your strength
[1:33:46] that hebrew word is oe

[1:33:56] boldness

[1:34:01] that you may find grace to help in the
[1:34:04] time of need

[1:34:14] raising up from his bed and shaking his
[1:34:17] mane to stirring to reveal his strength
[1:34:21] this is what god is saying to that
[1:34:23] daughter i've put something inside of

[1:52:35] memory of something that happened

[1:52:41] when i first started working i drove a
[1:52:42] truck for the company delivering
[1:52:44] cabinets
[1:52:46] and if you went down tangerine you got
[1:52:47] to first that's as far as i went you had
[1:52:49] to go down towards town
[1:52:52] and the cdo wash didn't have a bridge
[1:52:54] then
[1:52:55] and they had it all barricaded
[1:52:57] and said go back
[1:52:59] but other cars were going around the
[1:53:01] barricades
[1:53:03] and making it across
[1:53:05] so i said so can i
[1:53:07] and about halfway through i kept going
[1:53:09] drifting away from the edge where the
[1:53:11] water was falling
[1:53:13] and i got into the sand and the truck
[1:53:15] went like this
[1:53:17] and in the middle of cdl wash i was
[1:53:19] stuck
[1:53:22] and then the sheriff comes
[1:53:25] and he tells me i should give you a
[1:53:27] ticket for crossing the barricades
[1:53:30] when it was blocked
[1:53:32] i had to walk out and hook up a chain
[1:53:34] and tow the truck out
[1:53:36] but the whole time i'm stuck other cars
[1:53:39] are going around me
[1:53:41] and and yeah i'm feeling like a full and
[1:53:43] embarrassed
[1:53:45] now i get to the other side he said
[1:53:46] that's going to be a 40 charge for this
[1:53:50] i learned my lesson i didn't cross
[1:53:52] another barricade
[1:53:54] but i had to go through that experience
[1:53:57] but you know what
