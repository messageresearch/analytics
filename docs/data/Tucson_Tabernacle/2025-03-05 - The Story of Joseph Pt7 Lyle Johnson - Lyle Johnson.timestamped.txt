[25:54] going around let's always remember to
[25:56] pray for each other in our country
[25:59] is that a pivotal time really and and I
[26:03] don't think we should ever underestimate

[26:10] would give them
[26:11] wisdom and
[26:14] that he would protect us all and and
[26:19] help us as a country to
[26:21] prosper don't NE neglect to pray for

[26:26] you're expecting to somebody else to
[26:28] pray for it maybe they're expecting you
[26:29] to pray for it so somebody's got to pray
[26:32] for it so let's make sure that we always
[26:34] pray for our country pray for the
[26:36] direction we're going pray for wisdom
[26:38] there I don't have
[26:41] any other prayer requests besides Daniel

[46:42] seven we'll see some amazing evidence
[46:45] from secular history this evening that

[47:52] precious name amen
[47:57] for our opening verses I'd like to read
[47:59] from two places in Genesis the first is
[48:04] chapter 12 verses
[48:08] 1-3 now the Lord had said to Abram get
[48:11] thee out of thy country and from thy
[48:14] Kindred and from thy Father's House unto
[48:16] a land that I will show thee and I will
[48:20] make of thee a great nation and I will
[48:23] bless thee and make thy name Great Thou
[48:26] shalt sh be a blessing and I will bless
[48:30] them that bless thee and curse him that
[48:34] curses thee and in thee shall all
[48:37] families of the earth be
[48:41] blessed and the next few verses are from
[48:44] Genesis chapter 45 part of Joseph's
[48:47] words when he identified himself to his
[48:50] brothers it was part of our Study last
[48:53] week Genesis 45 at verse 4
[48:58] excuse me and Joseph said unto his
[49:02] Brethren come near to me I pray you I I
[49:06] I pray you the the the Hebrew word is n
[49:09] it often is translated as please but in
[49:12] the case of a command or an imperative
[49:14] it it softens it it's not so strident
[49:17] it's not so absolute so he's not
[49:21] commanding them to come near or else but
[49:24] he's insisting that they come and they
[49:27] came near and they're troubled troubled
[49:30] that his presence this strange
[49:33] forbidding Egyptian man and he
[49:37] said I am Joseph your
[49:40] brother this is a complete shock this
[49:44] Egyptian Noble whom they partied with
[49:46] the previous day not only speaks their
[49:49] Hebrew dialect but claims to be their
[49:52] brother
[49:54] Joseph what and in the same breath he
[49:58] reminds them your brother whom ye sold
[50:00] into
[50:01] Egypt at this Reuben must have looked at
[50:05] his brothers and seen their guilt-filled
[50:07] countenance filled with fear if this guy
[50:11] really is Joseph and has the power he
[50:14] clearly has as zaf a pan this might not
[50:17] be good news at all Joseph goes on to
[50:21] reassure them of his good intentions
[50:24] toward them
[50:27] now therefore be not grieved nor angry
[50:30] with yourselves that she sold me here
[50:33] for I have not forgotten but I have
[50:37] forgiven why because I've come to
[50:41] realize God did send me before you to
[50:45] preserve
[50:47] life Joseph knows his
[50:51] role for these two years hath the famine
[50:55] been in the land and yet the there are
[50:57] five years still to come in the which
[50:59] there shall be neither earring nor
[51:01] Harvest you think it's been bad for
[51:03] these two
[51:05] years it's even worse it's coming and
[51:08] God sent me ahead of you he repeats this
[51:11] emphasizing to them he recognizes that
[51:14] what they did God used it was God's
[51:17] doing and he hath made me a father to
[51:20] Pharaoh we talked about this in part
[51:23] four that senusret 2 who had the dreams
[51:26] died about the time the years of plenty
[51:28] ended s set three his son who had been
[51:31] tutored by Joseph for several years was
[51:35] now
[51:36] Pharaoh made me father to pharaoh and
[51:39] Lord of all his house and ruler
[51:40] throughout all the land of Egypt haste
[51:45] ye go up to my father say to him thus
[51:48] saith thy son Joseph God hath made me
[51:51] Lord of all Egypt come down unto me T
[51:54] not don't delay
[51:57] please be
[52:01] seated the story of Joseph is taken us
[52:04] from his birth in padanaram in in Syria
[52:08] his move as a young child about six
[52:10] years old to Canaan his dreams at age 17
[52:14] and the treachery of his brothers
[52:16] selling him into slavery at that age he
[52:19] was purchased by potier the captain of
[52:21] Pharaoh's guard we followed him as he
[52:23] learned all about agricultural practice
[52:26] in Egypt on the plantation of
[52:28] potier we saw him rise in responsibility
[52:31] to become what we would call the Chief
[52:33] Operating Officer to potier taking care
[52:35] of all those properties all his
[52:38] businesses he avoided the advances of
[52:40] Mrs P and ended up in the viip Detention
[52:43] Center called The Roundhouse on Piper's
[52:46] estate soon he was running it he
[52:50] correctly interpreted two dreams of
[52:52] Pharaoh's attendance the chief Baker and
[52:54] chief cup Bearer
[52:57] later couple of years later this Pharaoh
[53:00] Senor shet 2 had dreams and Joseph was
[53:03] summoned to interpret them predicting a
[53:06] period of bumper crops followed by a
[53:08] year of severe and lengthy
[53:11] famine he was put in charge of the
[53:13] country to prepare things for the
[53:16] oncoming famine and just as the famine
[53:18] began the Pharaoh died and was succeeded
[53:22] by his son senusret 3 whom Joseph had
[53:25] tutored he left Joseph in charge of
[53:28] things we also saw that during the 22
[53:31] years since Joseph had been betrayed by
[53:33] his brothers Judah fled to Canaan was
[53:36] married met with personal tragedies that
[53:39] mirrored those of his father
[53:42] Jacob as he was about to commit a
[53:44] highness crime Judas saw himself for
[53:48] what he had become publicly confessed
[53:51] his
[53:52] shortcomings he repented returned home
[53:55] to Hein
[53:57] the famine hit Canaan Jacob's 10 oldest
[54:00] Sons were sent to Egypt to purchase
[54:03] grain they had to see a Stern forbidding
[54:08] powerful man named zafaf pinea he was
[54:12] their brother Joseph but they didn't
[54:13] recognize him he sent them back to
[54:15] Canaan with grain and their money and
[54:18] with a warning that they would never see
[54:20] him again and thus never buy more food
[54:23] unless they brought their brother
[54:25] Benjamin he kept Simeon in prison as a
[54:28] hostage until they
[54:30] returned when the brothers returned and
[54:32] reported to Jacob he refused to let
[54:35] Benjamin go to Egypt but they ran out of
[54:38] food the famine continued finally Judah
[54:42] persuaded his dad to send Benjamin with
[54:44] them and Judah would take full
[54:46] responsibility for his safe return we
[54:48] saw this is a very different
[54:51] Judah they went to Egypt Joseph brought
[54:54] them to his Mansion they had an all day
[54:56] all night party though they still didn't
[54:58] know who he was he then arranged a
[55:01] deception to have them leave Benjamin
[55:04] with
[55:05] him Judah
[55:07] intervened and his impassioned plea
[55:10] caused Joseph to reveal his true
[55:12] identity to them as we just read a
[55:14] portion of he explained their treachery
[55:18] was really the means god used to send
[55:22] him to Egypt and prepare things so they
[55:25] all could survive the famine God even
[55:28] used the ishmaelites their sworn enemies
[55:31] he sent them home with Pharaoh SES
[55:33] threat three active participation and
[55:35] blessing to bring their families and his
[55:38] dad Jacob to him in Egypt they returned
[55:41] to heon and Canaan and had to face the
[55:43] consequences of the truth coming out
[55:47] exposing their deception regarding
[55:49] Joseph having been killed 23 years
[55:53] prior
[55:54] finally they gathered up all their stuff
[55:57] their animals their families let's pick
[56:00] up the story now at chapter
[56:06] 46 and Israel took his journey with all
[56:10] that he had and came to Barba and
[56:13] offered sacrifices under the god of his
[56:16] father Isaac we we see that's short
[56:18] distance it's only 20 miles or so 25
[56:21] miles why did he stop at
[56:24] BBA did something happened there in
[56:27] Jacob's past that would make him want to
[56:30] stop his journey so soon and offer
[56:33] sacrifices it's a form of
[56:36] worship let's take a moment and look
[56:38] during a previous famine Jacob's
[56:41] grandfather Abram went to
[56:43] Egypt there's no comment in the
[56:46] scripture if God told him to go or even
[56:49] if he asked God if he should go we're
[56:51] only told that God said Abram go to
[56:54] Canaan and Abram went to Canaan and and
[56:56] kept going to
[56:57] Egypt and in Egypt he used deception
[57:01] it's a family trait I think he used
[57:02] deception to
[57:04] survive Jacob may have been having some
[57:06] second thoughts about deception after
[57:08] learning about Joseph and what his sons
[57:10] had done and deceiving him Jacob's dad
[57:14] Isaac during a subsequent famine was
[57:18] tempted to go to Egypt God told him not
[57:20] to Genesis 26 we read there was a famine
[57:23] in the land besides the first famine
[57:25] that was in the days of Abraham and
[57:28] Isaac went unto aimc King of the
[57:30] Philistines unto guar now Abraham also
[57:32] went to a fellow named ailec but aimc is
[57:35] not a name it's a title like Pharaoh so
[57:38] it's not the same guy that somehow was a
[57:40] couple of hundred years
[57:41] old and God appeared unto Isaac and said
[57:47] go not down into Egypt dwell in the land
[57:50] which I shall tell thee
[57:52] of so Isaac stayed in guer in fact he's
[57:55] the only one one of the Abraham Isaac
[57:57] and Jacob Trio that never left the
[58:00] promised land he us the same deception
[58:03] Abraham had used in Egypt claiming his
[58:05] wife was his sister after some time had
[58:09] passed he was asked to please leave
[58:13] gar and he Isaac along with his wife
[58:17] Rebecca went up from then gar and an
[58:20] intermediate stop to berseba where he
[58:24] settled the Lord appeared unto him the
[58:26] same night that Isaac came to Bersa and
[58:28] said I am the god of Abraham thy father
[58:32] fear not I am with thee and will bless
[58:35] thee and multiply thy seed for my
[58:37] servant Abraham's sake he's confirming
[58:40] the promise he'd made to Abraham that we
[58:42] read in our opening
[58:44] verses and Isaac built an altar there
[58:48] and called upon the name of the Lord and
[58:50] pitched his tent there and there Isaac's
[58:53] servants died a well and there they
[58:57] dwelt bersheba is almost certainly where
[59:00] Jacob deceived Esau for the birthright
[59:03] and it is there that Jacob partnered
[59:06] with his mom Rebecca and deceived Isaac
[59:09] for the blessing of the
[59:11] firstborn it's where the family lived
[59:13] when Jacob fled for his life from Esau
[59:17] Genesis 27:41 we read Esau hated Jacob
[59:21] because of the blessing wherewith his
[59:23] father Isaac blessed him and Esau said
[59:26] in his heart the days of mourning for my
[59:29] father are at hand then I'm going to
[59:32] kill my brother
[59:34] Jacob not empty phrases he's talking
[59:37] about literal murder and we read Jacob
[59:41] went out from Beersheba and went toward
[59:45] haran now Jacob's beloved Son Joseph is
[59:50] telling him dad leave the promised land
[59:54] come to Egypt to survive yet another
[59:59] famine should he
[1:00:01] go as he starts out from heon the road
[1:00:04] leads through Beba the place where his
[1:00:08] deceptions began where he did so wrong
[1:00:12] he is now tasting the fruit of deception
[1:00:15] having mourned his son Joseph for 23
[1:00:19] years you can sort of hear him
[1:00:23] thinking maybe i' better start acting
[1:00:27] like Israel and not like
[1:00:30] Jacob so he decides to ask God for
[1:00:33] direction always a good idea when you
[1:00:35] have a decision to make fork in the road
[1:00:37] a corner to turn sometimes you get a
[1:00:39] clear answer go to Egypt other times you
[1:00:42] get an answer that's clear but not what
[1:00:45] you expected just walk okay I don't know
[1:00:48] where I'm going but you said walk so I'm
[1:00:53] walking brother bradam tells about that
[1:00:55] story in Memphis Tennessee at other
[1:00:57] times it seems you get no answer at all
[1:01:00] you have to trust and move
[1:01:03] forward returning to our
[1:01:06] story Israel took his journey with all
[1:01:08] that he had came to beeba and offered
[1:01:12] sacrifices unto the god of his father
[1:01:14] Isaac probably on the very altar where
[1:01:17] the sight of its remains that Isaac had
[1:01:20] built several decades earlier offering
[1:01:23] sacrifices was an expression of worship
[1:01:27] and God spake unto Israel in the visions
[1:01:30] of the night and said Jacob
[1:01:33] Jacob and he said
[1:01:36] he Hebrew it means here am I it's always
[1:01:40] a good answer God calls you stop here am
[1:01:51] I and God said I am God the god of thy
[1:01:56] father Isaac fear not to go down into
[1:01:58] Egypt for there I will make of thee a
[1:02:02] great nation your descendants will be
[1:02:05] there for many years become a numerous
[1:02:08] people continuing to confirm the promise
[1:02:11] he made to Abram and he had renewed to
[1:02:14] Isaac as we read earlier furthermore I
[1:02:17] will go down with thee into Egypt and I
[1:02:20] will also surely bring thee up again
[1:02:23] referring to both Jacob the individual
[1:02:26] and the nation that he has just said
[1:02:29] would
[1:02:30] become in Egypt and Joseph shall put his
[1:02:33] hand upon shall close Thine Eyes in
[1:02:37] other words Jacob you'll die there
[1:02:40] Joseph will close your eyes you'll
[1:02:43] return in a casket you live out your
[1:02:46] remaining days in
[1:02:50] Egypt and Jacob now having his answer
[1:02:54] from God rose up from Beersheba and the
[1:02:57] sons of Israel that's Jacob carried
[1:03:00] Jacob their father and their little ones
[1:03:03] and their wives in the carts which
[1:03:06] Pharaoh had sent to carry
[1:03:08] him and they took their cattle and their
[1:03:11] goods which they had gotten in the land
[1:03:13] of Canaan and came into Egypt Jacob and
[1:03:17] all his extended family with
[1:03:20] him his sons and his son's Sons with him
[1:03:25] his daughters implying he had more than
[1:03:28] one daughter not only Dina and his sons
[1:03:31] daughters and all his descendants
[1:03:33] brought he with him into
[1:03:36] Egypt and these are the names of the
[1:03:38] children of Israel which came into
[1:03:42] Egypt I won't read the list of names
[1:03:45] some names are left out the names of his
[1:03:47] daughters-in-law and in fact all the
[1:03:49] females traveling with them with the
[1:03:50] possible exceptions of Dina bilha and
[1:03:53] zilpa are left out the math is
[1:03:56] challenging to say the
[1:03:58] least skipping to verse
[1:04:01] 26 all the souls that came with Jacob
[1:04:04] into Egypt which came out of his loins
[1:04:06] besides Jacob's sons wives all the souls
[1:04:09] were three score and six that's
[1:04:12] 66 and the sons of Joseph which were
[1:04:15] born in Egypt were two Souls all the
[1:04:18] souls of the House of Jacob which came
[1:04:20] into Egypt were three score and 10
[1:04:22] that's 70 we'll just accept the stated
[1:04:25] numbers
[1:04:28] and Jacob sent Judah ahead of him unto
[1:04:32] Joseph to direct Jacob's face to Goan
[1:04:36] I'm coming to another fork in the road
[1:04:38] which way do I turn and they the
[1:04:40] extended family group came into the land
[1:04:43] of
[1:04:44] Goan and Joseph made ready his Chariot
[1:04:48] as how it's translated cart I think
[1:04:50] would be more accurate a couple of
[1:04:52] lessons ago I showed an image of a
[1:04:53] chariot from the tomb of King Tut
[1:04:56] at the time of Joseph a chariot or a
[1:04:58] cart would have had solid Wheels not
[1:05:01] lightweight spooked wheels and again we
[1:05:03] have no illustrations or examples from
[1:05:05] this
[1:05:07] period after Joseph's era in the Middle
[1:05:09] Kingdom and before moses' time in the
[1:05:11] New Kingdom Egypt would be conquered by
[1:05:15] a mysterious people called the hixus and
[1:05:17] one of the weapons that gave the hixus
[1:05:19] great advantage over the Egyptians was
[1:05:21] their spoke wheel chariots
[1:05:26] and Joseph went up to meet Israel his
[1:05:28] father to
[1:05:30] Goan and presented himself unto
[1:05:34] him what a
[1:05:36] reunion and he fell on his neck and wept
[1:05:39] on his neck a good while and you say
[1:05:41] well who does that he refer to brother
[1:05:42] Lyle I think it refers to both of them I
[1:05:45] think Joseph fell on his dad's neck and
[1:05:47] I think his dad fell on Joseph's
[1:05:50] neck and wept a good while at last they
[1:05:55] can cry all the pent up emotion and hurt
[1:06:00] turmoil and
[1:06:01] confusion pain and grief can be
[1:06:06] released for both of
[1:06:08] them it's a time where a
[1:06:11] wound becomes a
[1:06:14] scar the difference of course I I
[1:06:17] had some material removed from my body
[1:06:19] some chunk taken off a few weeks ago and
[1:06:22] I had to be careful how I slept because
[1:06:24] it hurt it it was a wound but
[1:06:27] now it's a scar it doesn't hurt anymore
[1:06:30] we've got past the period of healing
[1:06:32] these guys are having a time of
[1:06:37] healing and Israel said unto Joseph now
[1:06:42] let me die since I have seen thy face
[1:06:46] because Thou Art yet
[1:06:49] alive and Joseph said unto his Brethren
[1:06:52] and unto his father's house I will go up
[1:06:54] and show pharaoh and say unto him my
[1:06:58] brethren and my father's house which
[1:07:00] were in the land of Canaan are come unto
[1:07:03] me and the men are Shepherds for their
[1:07:05] trade hath been to feed cattle and they
[1:07:08] have brought their flocks and their
[1:07:09] herds and all that they have and and it
[1:07:12] shall come to pass when Pharaoh shall
[1:07:14] call you and shall say what is your
[1:07:17] occupation it's not so like today it's
[1:07:20] not who are you but what do you do for a
[1:07:24] living
[1:07:26] well when he asks you that she shall say
[1:07:30] thy servant's trade hath been about
[1:07:32] cattle from our youth even until now
[1:07:35] both we and also our fathers that she
[1:07:38] may dwell in the land of Goan for every
[1:07:40] Shepherd is an Abomination to the
[1:07:44] Egyptians Joseph is his father's son and
[1:07:48] he's a skilled
[1:07:49] politician he knows what to say and what
[1:07:52] to not say what to leave out since you
[1:07:55] raised cattle and sheep just admit to
[1:07:58] the cattle no need to tell them you also
[1:08:00] kept sheep it's enough that your hairy
[1:08:03] smelly Hebrew
[1:08:04] Hillbillies don't make things more
[1:08:07] difficult by telling sesr 3 that you uh
[1:08:10] take care of
[1:08:17] sheep then Joseph came and told pharaoh
[1:08:21] and said my father and my brethren and
[1:08:23] their flocks and their herds and all the
[1:08:25] they have are come out of the land of
[1:08:27] Canaan and behold they are in the land
[1:08:30] of
[1:08:32] Goan and Joseph took some of his
[1:08:34] Brethren even five unnamed men and
[1:08:38] presented them unto
[1:08:41] pharaoh and Pharaoh said unto Joseph's
[1:08:45] Brethren what's your
[1:08:48] occupation and they said unto
[1:08:51] Pharaoh thy servants are Shepherds both
[1:08:54] we and also our father fathers Joseph
[1:08:57] we've learned our lesson about deception
[1:08:59] and hiding
[1:09:01] truth he's going to find out where
[1:09:03] Shepherds when his men report back to
[1:09:05] him about our flocks who brought with us
[1:09:07] let's just deal with it
[1:09:09] now they said moreover to Pharaoh for to
[1:09:12] sojourn in the land are we come for thy
[1:09:15] servants have no pasture for their
[1:09:16] flocks for the famine is soore in the
[1:09:18] land of Canaan now therefore we pray
[1:09:21] thee please let thy servants dwell in
[1:09:25] the land of
[1:09:26] Goan we understand that's your intent
[1:09:28] anyway but we want you to know we're
[1:09:30] grateful and we'd love to stay where you
[1:09:33] have provided for
[1:09:35] us and Pharaoh spake unto Joseph saying
[1:09:40] thy father and thy Brethren are come
[1:09:41] unto thee the land of Egypt is before
[1:09:44] Thee the best of the land make thy
[1:09:47] father and Brethren to dwell in the land
[1:09:50] of
[1:09:52] Goan let them dwell
[1:09:57] if thou knowest any men of activity
[1:10:00] among them then make them rulers over my
[1:10:02] cattle it's kind of a strange turn of
[1:10:05] phrase other translations say in effect
[1:10:08] if uh any of your brothers are competent
[1:10:10] or skilled or have ability or are
[1:10:13] otherwise capable put them in charge of
[1:10:16] my
[1:10:17] cattle and as we'll see Pharaoh had
[1:10:21] immense herds of cattle to manage but
[1:10:24] the egyp Egyptian
[1:10:26] stereotype was that Hebrews sematic
[1:10:29] people in general were lazy incompetent
[1:10:32] and unskilled in addition to being
[1:10:34] bearded hairy and
[1:10:37] smelly anti-Semitism is nothing new we
[1:10:40] see it here 4 thousand years
[1:10:42] ago but uh hey Joseph if you're a smart
[1:10:46] guy and you cleaned up pretty well maybe
[1:10:49] one of your brothers is not the typical
[1:10:51] Hebrew either
[1:10:53] maybe and Joseph J brought in Jacob his
[1:10:56] father and set him before pharaoh and
[1:10:59] Jacob blessed
[1:11:01] pharaoh and
[1:11:02] Pharaoh probably taking a good look at
[1:11:05] him said unto
[1:11:08] Jacob how old are
[1:11:12] you and Jacob said unto
[1:11:15] Pharaoh the days of the years of my
[1:11:19] pilgrimage or 130 years few and evil
[1:11:24] have the days of the years of my life
[1:11:27] been and have not attained unto the days
[1:11:30] of the years of the life of my fathers
[1:11:32] and the days of their
[1:11:34] pilgrimage now let me assure you they
[1:11:38] were
[1:11:42] old and Jacob blessed pharaoh and went
[1:11:46] out from before
[1:11:48] pharaoh and Joseph placed his father and
[1:11:50] his Brethren and gave them a possession
[1:11:53] in the land of Egypt
[1:11:55] in the best of the land in the land of
[1:11:58] ramesis as Pharaoh had
[1:12:01] commanded
[1:12:03] ramisis this is a word that is again
[1:12:05] used to question when Joseph was in
[1:12:07] Egypt the first pharaohs named ramisis
[1:12:10] were in the New Kingdom around 1300 BC
[1:12:13] more than 500 years after
[1:12:18] Joseph ramisis is a name meaning raah
[1:12:21] the son God has fashioned him it it's
[1:12:24] POS possible an area of Goan being the
[1:12:27] best land was called this in the Middle
[1:12:29] Kingdom Period this is so good the son
[1:12:31] God must have just created this we don't
[1:12:34] know that if the Exodus occurred around
[1:12:37] 1446 BC it was about 150 years before
[1:12:42] the Pharaoh rameses 1 who reigned in the
[1:12:45] 1290s it's possible that a region or sub
[1:12:48] region of Goan was known by this name in
[1:12:52] Moses time Moses is the fellow that
[1:12:54] wrote Genesis
[1:12:55] but it is more likely that the Scribe
[1:12:57] copying Moses writings or a copy of such
[1:13:00] writings inserted the name ramisis to
[1:13:02] make the location clearer to the readers
[1:13:05] of his time not changing but clarifying
[1:13:09] likewise the name of Pome which appears
[1:13:11] in the book of
[1:13:12] Exodus there's no evidence either way we
[1:13:16] don't have a copy of Genesis older than
[1:13:18] the Dead Sea Scrolls and those were some
[1:13:20] 1500 years after Moses the text is clear
[1:13:24] however that pharaoh said
[1:13:26] Goan and so did
[1:13:30] Joseph and Joseph nourished his father
[1:13:33] and his Brethren and all his family's
[1:13:36] household with bread grained from the
[1:13:39] storehouses according to their
[1:13:42] families there was no bread in all the
[1:13:45] land for the famine was very sore so
[1:13:48] that the land of Egypt and all the land
[1:13:50] of Canaan fainted by reason of the
[1:13:53] famine
[1:13:57] here we see another model of Christ
[1:13:59] Joseph is taking care of his family
[1:14:02] Joseph is bearing the entire
[1:14:05] cost his
[1:14:07] motivation is
[1:14:09] love it's at a time of a Great
[1:14:12] Famine part of the scriptures our pastor
[1:14:15] brought last Sunday morning Paul wrote
[1:14:17] in Romans 8 who or what shall separate
[1:14:20] us from the love of Christ shall
[1:14:22] tribulation or distress pers persecution
[1:14:26] famine nakedness Peril sword as it is
[1:14:30] written for thy sake we are killed all
[1:14:32] the day long we are counted as sheep for
[1:14:34] the slaughter nay in all these things we
[1:14:38] are more than conquerors through him
[1:14:41] that loved us for I am persuaded that
[1:14:44] neither death nor life nor angels or
[1:14:47] principalities or powers or things
[1:14:49] present or things to come nor height nor
[1:14:53] depth nor any other creature
[1:14:55] shall be able to separate us from the
[1:14:57] love of God which is in Christ Jesus our
[1:15:02] lord and we think of the words of Amos
[1:15:07] and of our own time Amos 811 behold the
[1:15:12] days come sayeth the Lord that I will
[1:15:15] send a famine in the land not a famine
[1:15:18] of bread nor a thirst for water but of
[1:15:22] hearing the words of the Lord and they
[1:15:25] shall Wander from sea to Sea and from
[1:15:26] the north even to the east they shall
[1:15:28] run to and fro and seek the word of the
[1:15:31] Lord and shall not find
[1:15:34] it but it is our Lord who sends his word
[1:15:38] and sustains us as Joseph sustained his
[1:15:42] family brother brandham often referred
[1:15:45] to this in the last days it would be a
[1:15:47] famine for hearing the word of
[1:15:50] God well now let's look at Joseph in a
[1:15:53] slightly different role
[1:15:56] Joseph the master
[1:16:02] Publican the famine was very sore so
[1:16:06] that the land of Egypt and all the land
[1:16:08] of Canaan fainted by reason of the
[1:16:12] famine and Joseph gathered up all the
[1:16:15] money that was found in the land of
[1:16:17] Egypt and in the land of Canaan for the
[1:16:21] grain which they bought and Joseph
[1:16:24] brought the
[1:16:25] money into Pharaoh's
[1:16:30] house picture this the Grain and storage
[1:16:34] was collected as a tax on the land you
[1:16:37] may recall this model from uh part two I
[1:16:40] think in addition Joseph had developed
[1:16:43] the fiume Basin he stored the grain
[1:16:46] during such Plenty when wheat was
[1:16:49] cheap now the people were starving he
[1:16:52] sold the grain back to them it was
[1:16:55] scarce so the price was no longer cheap
[1:16:58] economics 101
[1:17:03] right money at that time was precious
[1:17:05] metal measured by weight didn't matter
[1:17:08] whose mint it was from it was silver or
[1:17:10] gold by
[1:17:13] weight it wasn't printed paper or IUS or
[1:17:17] waving your ey stone at the cash
[1:17:20] register but there's only so much silver
[1:17:23] and gold it's why we have Federal
[1:17:26] Reserve notes in our day and are
[1:17:27] transitioning to electronic
[1:17:30] transfer when I was a kid there were
[1:17:32] silver certificates as well as Federal
[1:17:34] Reserve notes but in the early 1960s the
[1:17:37] government demoted the silver
[1:17:39] certificates and set a date after which
[1:17:41] they were no longer going to be accepted
[1:17:43] in trade for silver so it says silver
[1:17:47] certificate it says $1 in silver payable
[1:17:50] to the bearer on demand and they said
[1:17:53] we're just kidding after such such and
[1:17:55] such a day we're not doing that anymore
[1:17:58] I I remember when several people I knew
[1:18:00] during the last week or so of
[1:18:03] redemption in the 1960s they they drove
[1:18:06] from where we lived in San Jose to the
[1:18:07] mint in San Francisco to redeem their
[1:18:10] silver certificats for
[1:18:13] silver had they done that before the
[1:18:15] famine they could have got some grain in
[1:18:18] Egypt when money failed in the land of
[1:18:22] Egypt and in the land of Canaan all the
[1:18:25] Egyptians came unto Joseph and said give
[1:18:28] us bread why should we die in thy
[1:18:31] presence why should we starve to death
[1:18:34] money's gone it failed there is no money
[1:18:37] you have all of it all the silver all
[1:18:39] the gold how can we buy
[1:18:43] Grain Joseph didn't extend credit he
[1:18:46] didn't make
[1:18:48] loans instead Joseph said
[1:18:55] give me your cattle and I'll give you
[1:18:57] grain for your cattle if you don't have
[1:18:59] any money give me your
[1:19:02] livestock so they brought their cattle
[1:19:04] unto Joseph and Joseph gave them bread
[1:19:06] grain in exchange for horses and flocks
[1:19:09] and cattle of the herds and for the
[1:19:11] asses he fed them with bread for all
[1:19:14] their cattle for that
[1:19:16] Year good thing he was taking care of
[1:19:18] his family or the brothers fear from our
[1:19:21] last session that Joseph wanted their
[1:19:23] donkeys might have come true
[1:19:27] true when that first year of the famine
[1:19:30] was ended they came to Joseph the second
[1:19:33] year and said unto him we'll not hide it
[1:19:37] from my Lord our money's gone my Lord
[1:19:41] also hath our herds of cattle there's
[1:19:44] not a there's nothing left in the sight
[1:19:46] of my Lord but but our bodies and our
[1:19:50] lands why should we die before your eyes
[1:19:54] well both we and our land buy us and our
[1:19:57] land for bread and we in our land will
[1:20:00] be servants slaves unto pharaoh and give
[1:20:03] us seed that we may live and not die
[1:20:05] that the land be not
[1:20:09] desolate this is the time of the
[1:20:12] brother's second visit they saw Z apan
[1:20:16] was making slaves of everyone and
[1:20:17] getting all their livock so their fears
[1:20:19] that he's going to make us slaves and
[1:20:21] steal our donkeys had some basis
[1:20:27] Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for
[1:20:31] Pharaoh ad includes Goan for the
[1:20:34] Egyptians sold every man his field
[1:20:37] because the famine prevailed over them
[1:20:39] so the land became
[1:20:43] pharaohs and as for the people he
[1:20:46] removed them to cities from one end of
[1:20:48] the borders of Egypt even to the other
[1:20:50] end thereof with neither earring nor
[1:20:54] Harvest no point in working the lands
[1:20:56] along the Nile easier to keep and feed
[1:20:59] and employ people in cities than in
[1:21:02] rural
[1:21:04] areas only the land of the priests
[1:21:07] bought he not for the priests had a
[1:21:09] portion of grain assigned them of
[1:21:11] pharaoh and did eat their portion which
[1:21:13] Pharaoh gave them wherefore they sold
[1:21:15] not their
[1:21:16] lands then Joseph said unto the
[1:21:21] people behold I have bought you this day
[1:21:24] and your land for
[1:21:27] Pharaoh Lo here's seed for you you shall
[1:21:30] seow the land in the future after the
[1:21:32] years of Dr are finished and it shall
[1:21:34] come to pass in the increase at Harvest
[1:21:36] time that you shall give the fifth part
[1:21:38] unto Pharaoh you remember that 10% tax
[1:21:41] it's
[1:21:42] 20% and four parts shall be your own for
[1:21:46] seed of the field and for your food and
[1:21:49] for them of your households and for food
[1:21:52] for your little ones
[1:21:58] sorry I got behind here
[1:22:01] by and they said thou Hast saved Our
[1:22:05] Lives let us find Grace in the sight of
[1:22:07] my Lord and we will be Pharaoh's
[1:22:10] servants will be your
[1:22:12] slaves and Joseph made it a law over all
[1:22:15] the land of Egypt unto this day the time
[1:22:18] of Moses some 450 years later that
[1:22:22] Pharaoh should have the fifth part 20 %
[1:22:25] except the land of the priests only
[1:22:27] which became not
[1:22:30] pharaohs are you ready for a little
[1:22:32] break in the story with a a little
[1:22:34] history
[1:22:35] sidebar the correct answer is
[1:22:39] yes oh okay well here we go thank
[1:22:44] you you may recall from part three of
[1:22:47] this series that under Senor threet 2
[1:22:49] the one who had the dreams I mentioned
[1:22:52] that he was known for having good
[1:22:53] relations
[1:22:54] with the nomarchs uh these were the
[1:22:57] regional rulers or Governors some of
[1:23:00] whom were nearly as powerful as pharaoh
[1:23:02] and I know you can't see that but all
[1:23:03] those little dots on there represent
[1:23:05] nark areas so there was I don't know 45
[1:23:08] or 50 of them I forgotten the number and
[1:23:10] didn't look it
[1:23:12] up and that Joseph was in prison during
[1:23:17] the white space between chapters 40 and
[1:23:19] 41 after he interpreted the dreams of
[1:23:22] the Butler and Baker in that interval
[1:23:24] before sence thre 2 had his dreams
[1:23:28] Joseph learned the protocol of the Court
[1:23:30] found out who was in the list of
[1:23:32] powerful men in Egypt at that time God
[1:23:35] Was preparing him for his upcoming
[1:23:37] audience with the Pharaoh and his
[1:23:40] subsequent
[1:23:48] service I also mentioned in part four
[1:23:51] and answer to some questions from young
[1:23:53] people in the audience
[1:23:55] that senet died about the time of the
[1:23:58] end of the years of
[1:23:59] plenty his son senusret 3 took the
[1:24:04] throne at the onset of the years of
[1:24:06] famine 1878
[1:24:10] BC senusret 3 is known in
[1:24:15] history as the pharaoh who destroyed the
[1:24:19] power of the
[1:24:21] nomarchs by the end of his reign the
[1:24:24] narks were no longer a major force in
[1:24:27] Egyptian
[1:24:29] politics this is from secular history
[1:24:33] secular history doesn't recognize Joseph
[1:24:36] doesn't
[1:24:37] recognize the truth that's contained
[1:24:40] here in Genesis but they
[1:24:43] align from Wikipedia we read Senus
[1:24:46] threet 3 ruled from 1878 BC the year we
[1:24:51] deriv from the Bible is the transition
[1:24:53] from the 7 years of plenty to the seven
[1:24:56] years of famine in part four he ruled
[1:24:59] from 1878 to 1839 BC during a time of
[1:25:02] great power and prosperity he was the
[1:25:05] fifth King of the 12th dynasty of the
[1:25:07] Middle Kingdom he was a great pharoh
[1:25:10] with the 12th Dynasty considered to rule
[1:25:12] at the height of the Middle
[1:25:15] Kingdom thank you
[1:25:18] Joseph his military campaigns gave rise
[1:25:22] to an Era of peace and economic
[1:25:24] Prosperity that reduced the power of the
[1:25:27] regional rulers the
[1:25:30] nomarchs and led to a Revival in craft
[1:25:33] workk and trade got to do something to
[1:25:36] be productive while the land lays
[1:25:39] valow and a Revival in Urban
[1:25:43] Development we just read that Joseph
[1:25:45] moved them into the cities in verse
[1:25:48] 21 It just fits together if you studied
[1:25:53] this sort of thing in school or or just
[1:25:55] because you were curious about the world
[1:25:57] we live in and its history you may have
[1:25:59] asked well s you thre three well how did
[1:26:02] he do
[1:26:04] that and we just read the answer the
[1:26:07] Nars were impoverished during the famine
[1:26:10] and had to surrender their Estates their
[1:26:12] land and their wealth to Pharaoh this
[1:26:16] made SES threat 3 an incredibly powerful
[1:26:18] man and it was thanks to Joseph no
[1:26:22] wonder Pharaoh was willing to tolerate
[1:26:24] the Hebrew Hillbillies and
[1:26:26] Goan and now that he owned all the land
[1:26:29] except for the temples of the priests
[1:26:31] and their surrounding Estates Goan was
[1:26:34] his to do with as he wished letting
[1:26:36] Joseph's family settle there was a small
[1:26:38] gift to acknowledge the man who made
[1:26:41] sesr 3 perhaps the richest and most
[1:26:43] powerful person known at that
[1:26:46] time there's another piece of secular
[1:26:50] history that ties into all of this s
[1:26:54] thre 3 was also known for his military
[1:26:58] conquests and his exploits but these
[1:27:01] didn't happen until the eighth year of
[1:27:06] his
[1:27:08] Reign he carried out at least four major
[1:27:11] campaigns into Nubia that's South when
[1:27:14] you head in Egypt you head upriver
[1:27:17] you're going south and the Nubians were
[1:27:20] at the border there and they uh they
[1:27:23] didn't really recognize the border so
[1:27:25] much four major campaigns into Nubia in
[1:27:28] his years the years of his reign of
[1:27:30] pharaoh years 8 10 16 and
[1:27:34] 19 year
[1:27:38] eight his year eight Stella it's a
[1:27:42] engraved
[1:27:43] Stone year eight that's the year after
[1:27:47] the famine
[1:27:48] ended this year 8 Stella at semna
[1:27:51] documents his victories against the
[1:27:53] Nubians through which he is thought to
[1:27:55] have made safe the Southern frontier
[1:27:57] preventing further incursions into Egypt
[1:28:01] raids during the
[1:28:04] famine ever wonder why he waited till
[1:28:07] year
[1:28:08] eight maybe because his army was busy
[1:28:11] guarding and distributing the grain
[1:28:12] during the famine and protecting Egypt
[1:28:15] during its weakness from both famine and
[1:28:17] political upheaval due to consolidation
[1:28:20] of power from Nars who didn't want to
[1:28:23] give up their
[1:28:25] power my
[1:28:27] friends God's word is
[1:28:29] true even the
[1:28:32] Rocks the inscribed Stones known as
[1:28:34] Stella declare
[1:28:37] it enough history back to
[1:28:41] Joseph and Israel Joseph's dad dwelt in
[1:28:45] the land of Egypt in the country of Goan
[1:28:48] and they had possessions therein and
[1:28:51] grew and multiplied exceedingly
[1:28:56] and Jacob lived in the land of Egypt 17
[1:28:59] years so the whole age of Jacob was 147
[1:29:05] years five years of those were during
[1:29:07] the continued famine with Joseph
[1:29:09] consolidating things under and four the
[1:29:13] Pharaoh SES 3 and then 12 years of
[1:29:16] relatively normal agricultural
[1:29:18] production while SES thre 3 is launching
[1:29:21] military campaigns to secure Egypt
[1:29:24] Southern frontier and to secure his
[1:29:29] legacy and the time Drew near that
[1:29:33] Israel Jacob must
[1:29:35] die and he called his son
[1:29:38] Joseph and said unto
[1:29:42] him if now I I have found Grace in thy
[1:29:46] sight a little dry
[1:29:49] son if now I have found Grace in thy
[1:29:52] sight put I I pray thee thy hand under
[1:29:55] my
[1:29:56] thigh and deal kindly and truly with me
[1:30:00] Bury Me Not I pray thee in
[1:30:04] Egypt but I will lie with my fathers
[1:30:08] Thou shalt carry me out of Egypt and
[1:30:11] bury me in their burying
[1:30:14] place and Joseph said I will do as thou
[1:30:18] Hast
[1:30:19] said and Israel
[1:30:22] said swear unto
[1:30:25] me and he swear unto
[1:30:27] him and Israel bowed himself on the
[1:30:30] bed's
[1:30:34] head I want to give you a very short
[1:30:36] preview of our final part part eight
[1:30:40] Next Time chapter 48 will be a
[1:30:43] surprising development when Joseph
[1:30:45] brings his two sons to see their
[1:30:47] grandfather God willing will also touch
[1:30:49] on part of the realization of what
[1:30:51] happens in that chapter chapter 49 is
[1:30:55] Israel's blessings on his 12
[1:30:57] sons or is it
[1:31:00] 14 and it records the death of
[1:31:03] Jacob chapter 50 concludes the Book of
[1:31:06] Genesis we'll see the honors accorded
[1:31:08] Jacob by Pharaoh Senus thre 3 we'll see
[1:31:11] the Brothers still concerned about
[1:31:12] Joseph taking Vengeance on them for
[1:31:14] their betrayal of him than 40 years
[1:31:17] earlier we'll learn of Joseph's death
[1:31:19] extracting a promise of his extended
[1:31:21] family similar to the promise we just
[1:31:23] read of
[1:31:24] Israel extracting from Joseph and the
[1:31:28] book closes with a dramatic comparison
[1:31:30] of its opening and closing
[1:31:33] lines and just as I think about it at at
[1:31:36] this particular moment uh for those of
[1:31:38] you that aren't familiar the back by the
[1:31:40] AV Booth I've got a single sheet that
[1:31:42] has some of the images we've used and a
[1:31:44] list of all the verses if you want to
[1:31:45] take them home and and uh review
[1:31:50] things what lessons can we take home
[1:31:53] from from this part of the story of
[1:31:56] Joseph years ago there was an
[1:31:59] advertising slogan used by army
[1:32:01] recruiters and it's coming
[1:32:03] back be all you can be in the Army and
[1:32:08] the life of Joseph I think we can
[1:32:10] rephrase this a bit be all God made you
[1:32:13] to be and don't allow yourself to limit
[1:32:17] him sold into slavery Joseph set his
[1:32:21] sights on the estate mansion
[1:32:24] to be Piper's Chief Operating Officer
[1:32:27] for a slave that's the Pinnacle but from
[1:32:31] God's perspective Joseph's sights were
[1:32:34] way too
[1:32:36] low along the path serving in the
[1:32:38] Mansion Joseph learned all the physical
[1:32:40] labor aspects of the plantation how to
[1:32:42] get best shield for the crops low-level
[1:32:45] management and so forth in the Mansion
[1:32:48] Joseph learned how to be invisible among
[1:32:50] the elite how they conducted themselves
[1:32:52] at the parties and dinners and whatnot
[1:32:54] that Piper undoubtedly threw during
[1:32:56] those
[1:32:57] years he learned that misunderstandings
[1:33:00] happen sometimes we might say no good
[1:33:03] deed goes unpunished with doing the
[1:33:06] right thing regarding Mrs P for which
[1:33:08] she landed in the VIP holding tank
[1:33:12] surely this was a huge step down but
[1:33:14] there in the white space between
[1:33:16] chapters 40 and 41 Joseph learned about
[1:33:19] the power structure in the Kingdom where
[1:33:21] loyalties lay who could be trusted who
[1:33:23] could not all the ins and outs of Royal
[1:33:25] politics and
[1:33:27] governance then Joseph was catapulted
[1:33:30] from the dungeon to the second spot in
[1:33:32] the superpower of the day Egypt he
[1:33:35] didn't sit on the throne but he wielded
[1:33:38] the power and authority of the
[1:33:43] throne when the famine hit he fully
[1:33:46] realized why God had put him in the
[1:33:49] place he
[1:33:51] was Joseph then had to confront the ones
[1:33:55] who had tormented him in the first
[1:33:59] place he had to see what he himself was
[1:34:04] really made
[1:34:05] of Joseph had to forgive what he could
[1:34:09] not
[1:34:10] forget and save those who had tried to
[1:34:14] destroy him musicians would would please
[1:34:18] return Jesus said this as he was
[1:34:21] preparing to go on his final journey to
[1:34:25] Jerusalem Luke 17 he said take heed to
[1:34:29] yourselves If thy brother trespass
[1:34:31] against thee rebuke him but if he repent
[1:34:34] forgive him if he Tres to pass against
[1:34:37] thee seven times in a day and seven
[1:34:40] times in a day turn again to thee saying
[1:34:42] I Repent Thou shalt forgive him and just
[1:34:46] after this perhaps seeking clarification
[1:34:49] we read in Matthew Peter came to him and
[1:34:52] said uh now l get this straight Lord how
[1:34:55] often shall my brother sin against me
[1:34:56] and I forgive him seven
[1:34:59] times Jesus said unto him I say not unto
[1:35:03] thee until seven times but until 70
[1:35:06] times
[1:35:08] seven how often does our father forgive
[1:35:12] us our life in Christ isn't just about
[1:35:16] words attitudes as brother Daniel
[1:35:20] ministered recently as includes service
[1:35:22] investing in each other
[1:35:24] in James 2 we read if a brother or
[1:35:27] sister be naked and destitute of daily
[1:35:29] food one of you say unto them depart in
[1:35:32] peace be warm have a belly full
[1:35:36] notwithstanding you don't give them
[1:35:38] those things that they
[1:35:39] need what good is that even so faith if
[1:35:45] it doesn't do anything is dead being
[1:35:49] alone as we close this portion of
[1:35:52] tonight's service
[1:35:54] I can't help but think of the message of
[1:35:56] love and grace so perfectly Illustrated
[1:35:59] in the life of Joseph and fulfilled in
[1:36:03] the life of
[1:36:05] Jesus let's sing together a song
[1:36:08] marvelous Grace it's a hymn that was
[1:36:11] written about 115 years ago containing

[1:41:08] sin I suppose there's not many men in
[1:41:11] history that knew Grace more than Joseph
[1:41:16] did I was amazed brother L was telling
[1:41:20] the
[1:41:21] story and
[1:41:25] Joseph took taxes on all the grain that
[1:41:29] the people produced they brought them
[1:41:32] in he he
[1:41:35] took the Grain and then when the famine
[1:41:39] hit and the grain ran out he sold it
[1:41:42] back to the ones that produced it and
[1:41:46] then when they couldn't pay he took
[1:41:48] their
[1:41:49] land and yet God was with him sometimes
[1:41:52] we don't understand God's ways but God
[1:41:55] used it to save all of Egypt let's all
[1:41:57] let's all stand
