hand and leads me through the promised [Music] that will be once more what a day that [Music] upon his face the one who saved is [Music] i don't sing so spare everybody that while you're standing if you'd open your bibles to the romans the fifth chapter read verses one and two romans chapter 5 starting at verse 1. therefore being justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ by whom we have we also have access by faith unto this unto this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in the hope of the glory of god let's just pray our most gracious and loving heavenly father it is always our privilege to gather ourselves together round your word to quieten our hearts and our minds and sing songs of worship and praise unto you because lord you're worthy of all those things but then lord we come to the time in the service when we want to hear from you you've chosen to speak through men but lord it's our desire as men as ministers of the gospel to let it not be our thoughts and our words but lord let it be yours so use me lord this evening as your servant move me aside guide the thoughts of my mind that the words that are spoken lord may they glorify you grant this lord for i ask it in jesus christ's name amen you can be seated over the last couple of years god's been dealing with me in different ways but i came across this verse in romans and it says therefore being justified by faith which we are we are peace and sometimes i look at my own life and there's a struggle because sometimes i'm never quite sure of my relationship if you will with my with god because i keep looking at myself i have false shortcomings i know you don't but but but i do and i'll make up for all of yours but it comes down to the place when i was reading this in in romans 5 it talks about having faith it talks about taking what god has said and actually believing it when it says we're justified it means you're without sin you stand as righteous and pure as god himself is and that's awful hard for most of us to accept but in reality that's how god views us when adam and eve sinned in the garden what happened god went and he took two animals he killed those animals he skinned them then he took the skin to those animals and gave it unto his children and so whenever god looked at them what did he see he saw the sacrifice that he himself had made for them and so whenever he looked upon them he had to be reminded blood was shed blood was said in order to take and cover their sins and and to re-establish the relationship that god desired to have with him with them and sometimes we forget the fact you know god desires our fellowship more than we often desire his but it comes down to the place where we have to be able to accept what god has said to to us in our christian life seems to be a struggle for most people but i believe it's because we are not willing to rest in the promises god has given to us because if we have the faith to believe if faith is not believing for someone or for something but faith is believing in someone and if we have the faith to believe in the god that we claim to serve and we believe that he's faithful and just to forgive us of our sins that we've if we believe that he's faithful to honor his word if we believe that he's faithful to take care of us and watch over his children if we can if we can never come to the place of of of taking our our lives and placing them in his hands and then we can be at rest i i know it it's i mean coming to this place of rest i mean it's it's it's there's no there's no longer a struggle in our lives yeah i mean we struggle day by day we have our problems we have our shortcomings we have areas that okay we we're constantly battling we're constantly trying to overcome but see god has made god has provided a way when we look at the at the bible the bible is the history of the book of redemption redemption it means restoring us back to our rightful position with our father in the beginning you were a part of god you were part of god from the beginning brother branham makes that statement more often more times quite often anyway because he says you have to if you're a part of god now you had to be a part of god then if you weren't of card of god then he says there's no way for you to ever be a part of him and because you are a part of him he says god has provided a means of salvation to to take us and restore us into our position that we should rightfully have with him and we have our f and our father loves us you know it's interesting when you he knew you before before the foundations of the world he knew what you would be liking brother brown says he knew the color of your hair how high or how big you'd get and your your hair color he knew what you would be like as you were going through your childhood you know the mistakes that you'd make he knew your attitudes and what you would make what the mistakes you would make as a teenager he knows the mistakes that you made today he knows the mistakes she'll make tomorrow but he loved you and when when we were in sin he died for you greater love had no man than this than a man would lay down his life for his friends but here again it comes down to the place we have to we have to be willing to come to the grasp and actually believe this it has to be more than just words on a piece of paper it asks me more than just a nice sermon that somebody preached now that has to come to the place in our lives this becomes a reality to us you know a couple of years back i i did a study in a book called habakkuk it's only three chapters long very short but you know habakkuk lived in the time when when when uh during the time of jeremiah just before the destruction of jerusalem and god had showed him him being a prophet god had shown to him the hypocrisy of the priesthood he showed them the lives of the people that were there that oh yeah we you've got to bring another sacrifice well yeah i think this one might do hopefully the priests will accept it if not i'll bribe them maybe you know they would go but their worship was not sincere it was just it was a formality that they went through but see too often in our christian life in too many churches coming to church is a formality it's something we do because well yeah it's sunday i guess i better go otherwise pastor is going to preach against me this time or else can you come come to wednesday well you have nothing better to do so i guess i'll come to church you know but see there has to be the time there has to be the desire to come there has to be the desire to worship there has to be something within our heart that desires to draw ourselves closer to god so havoc lived during this time and after god had showed him all these things god's habit because lord why don't you bring a judgment why don't you bring condemnation to these people and god says okay i think i will i'll bring the chaldeans which are the assyrians or that maybe those anyway but habakkuk didn't like that answer because he was afraid for himself if all of a sudden the nation or the city is is invaded and the and the soldiers come going through the city they kill because they enjoy killing they they would they would kill men women children young old it didn't matter to them they did it because that's what they like to do and because the more that they killed the more spoiled they could take and that's how they that's how they made their living and so havoca became disturbed at this and then god began to answer him and have a good two and four says behold the soul which is lifted up is not upright in him but the just shall live by his faith and that's where paul gets in this thing and the just being justified by faith this is the reference it goes back to is back in habakkuk and it's interesting the way that the wording is here it says it says it talks about he whose soul is not right in he he whose soul is lifted up is not upright in him in other words from what i was able to understand from the commentary i read it talks about a man that is self-reliant talks about a man i can do this myself i don't need god's help and so he says yeah oh there's a there's an invasion coming fine i've survived a few other ones yeah i can survive this one you know yeah i'll just make preparations i'll take care of it and i can do this by myself but but see god says okay if you're going to do it by yourself he says you don't need my help i'll just take my hands off and good luck but it says this but he says the the the but it says the just shall live by his faith and this is an interesting wording in here and the faith that it talks about here is a total dependence between the creature and the creator it's not where you get where you say well i can do this by myself no it comes to the beyond that place it says lord he says without you he says i can't do anything lord without you i need your assistance i mean we got up this morning why because god woke you up you have no guarantee for tomorrow you have no guarantee for anything i mean our illustrious president can sign a declaration or whatever like that he can shut the whole country down and overnight we factor he may be already doing that we don't know this i mean our last president shut it down for how many months so we have no guarantee for tomorrow we have no guarantee for our jobs we have no guarantee for anything but it comes down to the place if we put our faith and our trust in god god has guaran god had said he will watch over us and he will provide for us and he will take care of you and this is what god was trying to impress upon habakkuk because habakkuk maybe he was going to be self-reliant maybe even even the relationship that he had with god yet he was had to come to he had to come to the place in his relationship with god where he would trust god literally for everything and this is what god's been dealing with me over the last couple years that's that's why this scripture has meant so much to me but you know when we when we when we jesus christ gave a parable in luke the 18th chapter and he talks about two people went into that went into the temple to pray says one was a pharisee one was a publican now the pharisee were the righteous or the righteous they figured they kept the law the public and on the other hand was a tax collector he would collect money from his own people and give it to the roman government so he was basically he was a traitor to his own people but the pharisee would go in and says oh i thank god that i'm not like all the other people he said i fast twice in a week i i give tithes of all that i possess and i'm sure he had a whole list of things he was telling god how great he was but then when we look at the public and he said he said he was a standing afar off would not lift up so much as his eyes to heaven but smote upon his breast saying god be merciful to me a sinner and the scofield notes it says be to me be toward me as thou are when you're looking upon the atoning blood in other words don't look at me because i have nothing to offer you but what i want to do i want you to look upon the blood that's been placed upon the mercy seat because the public can realize that's the only hope that he had you know we sing songs about the cross but see it's in the cross everything that you have need of that's where you'll find it the stripes laid on his back you has already healed you but you have to accept that you have to believe that if i mean we all make our mistakes so what do we do we so we go to the we go there before god we confess him he says he's faithful and just to forgive us of all of our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness but see it talks it there it's a relationship here that we're looking at jesus said that he said i tell you talking about the public and this man went down to his house justified rather than the other for everyone that exalts themselves shall be abased but say here again it's how do you approach god whenever i whenever i pray i realize i'm approaching not only my not only god but he's my father when i was i was making that statement once and i was preaching something and all of a sudden i there was a scripture there it says and he's god has given you the holy spirit because god is your father and as i was preaching all of a sudden i thought about that as i was preaching god actually is my father my earthly parents gave me this tabernacle i live in but yet i was a part of god from the beginning in the process of time i came into manifestation and god has a plan for my life just as he has a plan for all of your lives you don't know what your plan is and maybe you you haven't fulfilled it maybe god will reveal it later on or maybe you are fulfilling it now i mean i don't know but it has to come to the place in our lives we have to accept that god actually is my father and if we accept the fact that god is your father then there's certain there's certain privileges which goes along with with that with that with with you being his son or his daughter you know when we look at when we go into the bible and we look at elisha and he was there and the king of syria was sitting there waging war against the nation of israel or was judah at that point anyway he goes in and the prophet was there and he would tell the king he says don't go by this way the king of syria is sitting there and the king of syria was waiting for the people to come by or for the army or something like that then they moved to another place another place and somebody and so the king of of of syria has he says who is a traitor in my in my midst who is telling the king of israel he says where you were living and where we're camping and when guy says oh yes you don't understand he says there's a prophet in the land and god is showing that prophet well where is he at well he's in dothan so that that that night they packed up they went around oath and they surrounded the city and so all of it and so in the morning elijah as he lied your elijah kept the two mixed up but anyway he said he said well go get me my breakfast and so the servant went up there and all of a sudden he looked over the wall of the city and says oh my he said all the syrian army is camped around about us so he went running back to the prophet and and the and the prophet says well where's my breakfast he says no you don't understand we're surrounded by the army he says they're going to invade the city and we're all going to die he said no we're not he said there's more with us than there is with all of with all of them and the pride and the servant would look at you and me and me and you you me me you um and so the prophet said lord open his eyes and all around the hills with chariots of fire and angels and all the other stuff the servant did not realize the position that he had but the prophet did but see we have to come to the same realization of ourselves if god is our father god will protect us god will guide us and he he will he he will watch over us and he becomes our provider he becomes our protector you have because you are a son and a son and daughter of god you have access to everything god is god will bankrupt heaven i think brother branham says before he'll let one of his promises to one of his children fail but you have to accept the promise you have to come to the realization in your life god made the promise to you often we say oh yeah god heals and that's great but you have to come down to the place by his stripes i am healed and you have to take the promise and make it personal to yourself because once you make it personal to yourself then god is obligated to you to fulfill that promise but then if you have the faith to believe in him then what you do is after you've asked for ask for healing then you wait you rest waiting for the fulfillment of that promise but see this is the way our christian life should be it should not be a struggle of wondering today what's going to happen today or wondering what's going to happen tomorrow and you know oh lord we're all in a turmoil we don't know what's going to we don't know what's going to happen within our country but yet if we rest in him tomorrow doesn't matter because he's already been there he already knows what you're going to face tomorrow he already knows the trials the trump troubles and the things that they're going to that are going to come your way and if you can believe god if you can put your faith and trust in him then he then you can rest in the god that has called you you know brother browner makes an interesting statement in ministry explain somebody says how does divine healing is it does it last all the time brother rams it lasts just as long as faith lasts and salvation lasts the same way just as long as faith lasts when you when you feel that you're not saved anymore he said then you're not saved and sometimes brother branham in his own life he says there are times i don't feel like i'm saved but he says i have to go back to what the scripture says and because i have fulfilled the requirements of the scriptures by that basis by the basis of the word of god and his faith in that word he says on that basis i am saved it can't it can be on your emotions it can't be on the circumstances that you're in no it has to come between a relationship between you and between god too often when we get into this message it's all intellectual stuff oh we have to understand the deepest the mysteries oh we have to understand the revelation of the seven seals oh we have to understand where the time frame we're in we have to understand the spoken word we have to understand the ten vision we have to that's nonsense what you have to have is a personal relationship with jesus christ because that is what will sustain you the rest of the stuff won't having an intellectual knowledge of stuff doesn't help you no it's a faith relationship it's you coming to a time between you and god where you are in a personal personal relationship with him it's like when you look at abraham god god spoke to abraham we don't know what what age he was then but his father decided to to do and god told him he says you have to leave the place of your nativity your friends your family and everything else and then his father decided to move from where they were and go to a place called heron well god had to take abraham's father home so that abraham would continue on and come down into the palace into the promised land but then when he got into the promised land god says ah this is the land that i promised you this is the land i was leading you to but there was a famine going on at that point in time so abraham looked around and says well maybe the promised land but right now it's in trouble so what did he do he journeyed on down into egypt but see egypt to me speaks of the world it talks about self-reliance it talks about you're going to do it yourself you're where you're relying upon yourself so god had to bring circumstances to pass to force abraham out of egypt and take him back up to the promised land then god had to create circumstances where lot and abraham would separate it wasn't until lot and abraham separated that all of a sudden god could fulfill the promise that he had made unto abraham but all the time that abraham lived in that land it wasn't always easy but see during the time that abraham lived there he got to he to see the hand of god in his life he got to be re he got he began to realize that okay god is the one he provided for me today he'll provide for me tomorrow well we're in a famine but god brought the rain so now we can feed our sheep and our cattle and all the other types of things abraham had to learn over time to believe god until one time abraham came into god and key questioned he says he says you keep promising me a son i'm to be a father of many nations but i have no children so that that means eleazar is going to inherit everything and god says no i promise it through sarah and abraham says how do i know you're going to fulfill this so god had to come to abraham and says okay you have a way in your country during your time in to make a covenant so you go ahead you take the animal you kill that you kill the beast you split the animal and you sit in the middle of the of the carcass and because in his time what they did when they made an agreement he said both of the parties would sit in the carcass of that animal and whoever broke the agreement of the thing he says then you would have to die like this sacrifice had died so then abraham sat there and as the sun was sitting down all of a sudden god put asleep on him showing him he actually he should go to hell but then god in the light he came through and he passed between the sacrifice and that god came down and said see if i do not fulfill my promise to you i will die the same way that sacrifice has died and god can't die so god made a promise to abraham and it was unconditional there was no conditions on abraham's side and what brother branham has tried to express unto us with his agreement with us is unconditional it's not whether you keep the law it's not whether you fulfill certain obligations no it's whether you accept jesus christ as your savior and from that point on god will watch over you and care for you and provide for you whenever when god when abraham finally came to the place where it says he believed god and god counted it to him for righteousness from that point on god always regarded him as righteous when you accept jesus christ as your savior all of a sudden god regards you as righteous and god from that point on does not change his opinion in the eyes of god you are righteous you may not feel like it you may not you know you have your struggles and whatever else in your in your life but god does not change his opinion of you you are righteous because god said yet you are not because you think you are we go a little bit further on we look at a man named david now david was sitting there and taking care of his dad's sheep a lion came in and took one of the one of the lambs and david went after the lion he's killed the lion so he could rescue the lamb a little while later bear came in did the same thing so what did david do he ran after the bear he killed the bear so he could rescue the lamb but see there was going to come a point in david's life when he was going to have he was going to refer back to that time when god smote those animals for him because he was going to stand before a man named goliath in fact when all of a sudden he goliath was making his boast and david heard it and he went before saul and saul says oh he says you can't go you're better you're but a youth he says god gave god god smote the lion and god smote the bear god will give me this goliath also when david went he took he took five stones put him in his little shepherd's pouch and when he saw goliath after making his most he ran toward goliath he didn't crouch down he didn't try and hide behind the trees or the bushes whatever no he said god is going to deliver you into my hand because god has because because i believe in god that he will do that but see we have our goliaths we have our struggles we have the things that we face but see you should be able to look back in your life and you can see well god healed me here if you healed me there he he'll heal me here well i had a need here and god and god provided for me then god will provide for me now well i had this other need in my life and god intervened and god took care of that well if god did that then he'll do for me now it should have it should give us faith to rely upon him well we cannot we actually come to our lives where we rest in the promises of god there came a time also david was watching over the sheep one of the servants came over and says hey your dad wants to see you so david goes into the house and there's this crazy old man takes his horn of oil pours it all over david said you're the next king of israel says really um okay you say so um what did david do he ran to say hey i'm to be the next king teach me how to be a king now he says ah he went back to sheep he was more comfortable with the sheep but then god called god made circumstances come to pass where david became david was taken into the court of saul and that began his education how do you how do you govern a nation but then saul became jealous since he tried to kill david but see so david had to run and hide in caves in different places but see always in the back of his mind there was a prophet that came to me and said i was to be the next king of israel and he refused to kill king saul he said no no god will bring it to pass in his own time in his own way but see it has to come to the place in our lives here we will rule and reign with jesus christ that is our that is what god is preparing us for now to reign with him during the millennium but we have to learn to rest in him we have to be able to sit at his feet even now and begin to take instruction what does it mean to rule the bible says you are kings and priests what does kings do they rule what do we rule we rule over satan's kingdom satan has to obey us because of who we represent we have the authority we don't have the power we have the authority because jesus christ has given us that authority he gave it to his disciples he go into the villages around about you i you know i've given you you go ahead and heal the sick and raise the dead and cast out demons freely i've given you this authority freely use it he never took that back so we have that but see why did god send the prophet in our generation so we would begin to actually believe what we are we would be actually begin to believe we actually have we actually have the have the authority to rule over satan's kingdom when sickness comes what can we do we can rebuke it we can tell that demon to leave when he'll do it don't know but he has to go because we have the authority to tell him to go but you have to believe it it can't be just a mental thing it can't be well the bible says that so i guess it's true no it has to come from inside the heart if you say you believe in your heart and you say the mountain go from hence the underplay and you believe in your heart it has to move which means it has to be an integral part of you it has to be a faith which is unmovable it has to be a faith without question because oh yeah i want the mountain to move and i wonder if it will no it won't but if all of a sudden god comes out like with brother branham he says oh yeah there's going to be a miracle. and they they were they were fishing like brother banks was i guess and a few of the other ones that were there and all of a sudden god told brother brown stand up okay what happened he says little fish i give you your life okay but see god commanded god instructed him what to do and you look at the times in the spoken word god instructed him what to say it wasn't he said well hey you know i think it'd be great today well let's why don't we have a snowstorm i'd like to go skiing or i like to go sledding or something and it's the middle of july okay no that ain't going to happen but see it has to come under the anointing it has to come where god inspires us to say i know there was a brother in recently in our in our church and he came to me and says we were at a function within the church and the brother came to me he says you know he said i've had this terrible headache i've taken these pills and stuff but it doesn't seem effective and so i said well let's pray so as i was praying i said i was going to say lord lord be gracious to heal him and all of a sudden it changed i said satan i command you to leave in the name of jesus christ because i have the authority because jesus christ has given me that authority and you have no rights because that brother is a purchase of the blood of jesus christ it had to go we had another brother in our church and uh they did an operation on one of his elbows and doctors as far as they were concerned the operation was successful but he got an infection a staph infection they treated with antibiotics they had to open up one other time and pump it for more antibiotics and drain it some more and you can only do that so many times and the damage that becomes irreversible and so they were he was in the hospital again and the doctors were going to treat him one more time and god told me he says go and pray for him um okay i don't like going to charlotte traffic is heavy i don't like traffic that's why we live where we live anyway so i went in there i found the room he was in we visited for a few minutes and i said you know why i'm here he said well no not really i said god sent me here to pray for you and to rebuke this thing because no longer is a physical problem it's a spiritual one so i prayed and i rebuked that thing and cast a demon out of that out of the the bacteria that was in his elbow and from that point on it began to heal it doesn't make me anything it's merely i was trying to be obedient to what god had god would have me to do i i know well i know my wife she worked for labor and delivery she was she worked there as a doula and labor support and uh she would hear the nurses are there and they'd oh yeah this lady is having problems giving giving birth or whatever like that and shirley would hear it so she'd started praying and all of a sudden the nurses came in to her and says you've been praying again haven't you well yeah yeah because now the baby has turned and now we hadn't had a normal delivery and that's not just one time that's multiple times so through her prayers all of a sudden you know i mean that you know the whole labor and delivery of it it was it was it was different because she was there that's why she was there but it comes down to the place we have to rule we rule satan's kingdom you look at brother branham's life brother branham when he was born he was born a prophet but see brother branham even when he was born a prophet he had no he had no idea exactly what that entailed he refused to accept jesus christ as his savior until finally got put him basically on his deathbed and from that point on when he said well if you let me live he says i'll serve you so say okay so god so god healed him and then the visions that god had given brother branham the people told him well that's of the devil but yet every vision that he had it always proved out to be correct he had faith in those visions he says if i see a vision i know that's exactly what's going to happen and then you go and he was reading through his bible and he looked at how god dealt with prophets he said well that's how god deals with me as a prophet so i must be a prophet therefore so it was the bible referencing him that made him believe that he was a prophet when all of a sudden the discernments began he says hey there's the scripture about that that's when that's when god came down in human flesh and and and actually had a uh could discern the thoughts of sarah sarah's heart and so he from that point on he would turn his back and says say god is here he was trying to prove god was present he was not trying to exalt himself look at what i am i am you know i am this mighty angel that's here no he wasn't even trying to do that he said i want you to see god is actually here because if you can believe god is here then if you can believe that then god will answer your prayer then he always believed that billy graham was was the church age messenger he preached that up until 63. because he preached in 62 kennedy was elected president he says oh yeah it's the vote of the women that i'll put him in office so he says we this is that we must be there he says you know so many of the visions have already been fulfilled so then he preached the church ages and after he preached them he said the angel told him now you go read malachi 4. that's when he began to understand i'm the messenger to this age but it says in the days of the voice of the seventh angel and he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished brother branham says that that seventh angel did not begin to sound until the opening of the seals and then he says there there's been a message committed to me and i have to obey that so you have to look at his life and now as his life progressed from one thing to another thing to another because god was training him for the final thing to be the final to be to be the seventh church age messenger to be able to take into and to speak to the bride you know it's interesting when you read the church ages god was always had messages to two different groups one was the true vine one was the false mind but when you get to the lady of certain church age all he's talking about is to the false mind because god had to send a prophet in this generation say no no he says you're not luke roman like the ladies in church no you are the virtuous sinless bride of jesus christ god through him was trying to tell the bride this is who you are god does not hold anything to your charge in your in god's eyes you are the virtuous sinless bride of jesus christ and we have to begin to accept that you know going back to habakkuk habakkuk after god had been dealing with him habakkuk came to a revelation of what it was going to what it's going to take in his life in hebrews 3 and 16 it says when i heard he said my belly trembled my lips quivered at the voice rottnest entered into my bones and i trembled in myself that i might rest in the day of trouble when he cometh up unto the people he will invade them with his troops havoc was scared it wasn't just another passing day no he was looking at his own life and says i wonder what's going to happen am i going to be able to survive this but he had to come to the real to the revelation within himself he says although the fig tree shall not blossom neither shall fruit be in the vine the labor of the olives shall fail in the field shall yield no meat the flock shall be cut off from the fold and there shall be no hurt in the stall those will be total devastation though everything is lost he said yet i will rejoice in the lord i will joy in the god of my salvation he will go back to the temple and he will shout and he will dance and he will and he will with all the energy that he had he will praise his god it did not matter what he had it did not matter the conditions of the world did not matter the conditions of the city he said nothing will happen which will change my relationship with my god but see we have to come to the same i know in covet when coveted hit i know it devastated india and i've been going there for the last 15 years and and i have a burden for the people and so i preached on habakkuk shortly after after the covet hit and i told the brother i work with i says out in the villages he says make sure they have food don't worry about the building projects or any anything else make sure they have food what good is a building if everybody's dead i mean you know and so and you know um i have some say in how the money is distributed i i don't control it control it but at least if i make a recommendation normally he'll follow my recommendations but i told him i said if all of a sudden you have nothing and there were times in india really they had nothing they could not leave their neighborhood they had they had they had the military was posted around the neighborhood nope and they even had it roped off you cannot leave your neighborhood there's a place where you can get some fresh some vegetables there's a place where you can get some bread there's a place you can get the the necessities you have but you're not leaving your neighborhood okay what about the people that worked in india you work today so you can eat tomorrow and all of a sudden if there's no work there's no money if there's no money there's no food but see this is the can this was the condition in india you say oh that's not going to happen here well how many restaurants have closed how many people have been put out of work okay do you trust god if everything is lost will that affect your relationship with your god you're right now you're blessed what happens tomorrow if everything's gone well you'll still come to church and worship and praise god as if you still possessed everything and this is something only you can answer yourself like i say faith is not believing for something but it's believing in someone it's coming to the realization that god is god and god is all-powerful and god is omnipotent he can do whatever he desires to do and he is that he is in control of the mess that we're in as a nation in fact i look around this nation why why is all the this why is why is the judgment falling upon this nation why does god send judgment to have people turn their heart back to him because all of a sudden they begin to cry out at least that was the hope though they begin to cry out they'll repent of their sins and their iniquities and all of a sudden then they'll turn back to god and then god then god will will restore you know the things which they were losing but our nation doesn't want god it's run by a bunch of infidels well maybe not all of them but at least on the outward sign it sure seems that way but it comes down to the place where where god is wanting this nation to turn back to him but brother branham says in 15 i think it was 54 or something like that he says this nation has turned their back on god from that point on and so it's it's judgments destruction you know there was there's a lady in me she was in memphis tennessee and this this just struck with me when i when i when i read the story of this this lady she was she said i'm the pseudomite woman where's your elijah her prayer caused the plane brother branham was on to land in memphis brother branham got up in the morning he was going to mail a letter or something like that and god says i want you to keep walking he said well where am i going no i just want you to walk but no he has no butts just walk and brother branham knew to be obedient so he went walking along down into the poor section of town and there was this colored sister which was there and she'd been there since daybreak brother branham walked by and she said morning parson how did you know i was a parson well you see if i fell asleep and god gave me a dream you were coming he said well i'm brother i'm brother branham have you heard me nope never heard of you before well i have healing campaigns well that's nice she didn't understand the seven seals did not have a revelation of the spoken word she didn't have a revelation of all these things that people in this message put so much emphasis on but she had a relationship with jesus christ where when she prayed god heard and brought that plane down and sometimes i wonder is our relationship as good as that sisters have we come to the place in our relationship with god where we believe that if we pray god will hear our prayer and god will answer that prayer because this is where we have to come this is where we have to come brother branham he swore by himself brother branham makes this statement he says faith is unconscious he says you've got faith and you don't even know it he said that's right he said jesus christ no matter if he was in a storm in the in the gales knocking the boat from one side to the other or he was standing in the face of a mess of demons or if he was hanging anywhere never moved him he walked right along just as calm and quiet as he could be why he was simply unconscious of fear of anything around him he that's right he said whether it's going to happen or whether it wasn't going to happen he knowed it was going to happen because god said said so he just walked right on unconscious of fear but see he knew who he was and the problem i find within most of the message believers we are we're not willing to accept who we are we keep looking i know when i was in the baptist church and even in the assemblies of god and stuff i've been in that we'd always you know we they would preach and say yeah you are a sinner saved by grace the emphasis being sinner because they always want you to realize you're imperfect you're sinner but god's grace has saved you well that's true but in this message it tells me i am a son of god that has been fully restored to my rightful position with my father i may be a sinner saved by grace because that is true but also in the presence in the present age in which we're living no i am a son of god and i have been fully restored to my rightful position with my father and therefore everything that my father is i have access to all i have to do is have the faith to believe it brother branham and obama and gilead it's one thing we have to move up to now is supreme faith supreme faith oh my that's you know what it how we can ever come to supreme faith he said most people don't have enough faith to believe for a toothache okay but then he goes on and and he gives examples he say well you say well i'm going home i'm going to go out and start the car he said that's all an act of faith tomorrow they meet you at a certain place he said that's all an act of an act of faith he says because you've just done it so much because it's a regular routine with you you're going to go out and start your car you put the key in the ignition or push the button however they are now you expect it to start there is no question well if there is no question that is supreme faith you just expect it you go into your house it's dark you you feel for the light switch you flip the switch you expect there to be light why you don't doubt well that's supreme faith by his stripes you're healed well god said so well if god said so i am okay now i just wait for its manifestation that's supreme faith you don't question you believe in the god that has made the promise in one place in in talking about abraham abraham believed in the god that had made the promise to him that he he believed that the god that had made the promise was more than able to bring that promise to pass but see this is where it comes down with us do you actually believe that when you pray you that god will hear and moses says well i believe god will heal others but but me i i don't know i mean i haven't i haven't done everything right today that's irrelevant i'm not saying you have a license to sin i'm not saying you can go out in the world and live in the world and corrals with the world and do the things of the world and then expect god to answer your prayer in fact if you can do that you've never met jesus christ when you met jesus christ there has to be a change in your life conversion indicates there is a change but once the change takes place god regards you as righteous it doesn't matter what you think about you brother brown says it's more important for you to believe god says you are than what you think you are because then when you go to god in prayer say well lord i have a need today okay what's your need well okay and you ask and god you know you expect god to fulfill it because there should be no more question and that is supreme faith and brother branham he goes on he said that's the way the things of god are after you have trusted him and watched him do so many things till it becomes just a regular routine and that's the condition i think the church will be in just before the coming of the lord so the rapture will go on right that way it'll just be regular routine of following the scriptures and the plan of god your walk with god day by day is that walk is what will take you in a rapture because you have faith and you're walking with enoch walked with god and he was not because god took him well are we walking with god are we walking in the scriptures are we walking in the plan of god do we walk trying to please him serving serving jesus christ is not a bunch of rules and regulations it's not by law i serve him because i love him it's the love i have for him that motivates me to live the life that i live it's not because i'm afraid of judgments not because i'm afraid of being chastised no i love him i want to please him i know there were days when i was when i was young i wasn't always good but i remember there was one day that i don't know what i did but mom looked at me and says wait till dad gets home when she said that i knew man i crossed the line i made sure dad had his slippers i made sure he had his paper i made sure he had us you know and dad look oh what have you done today oh nothing i've just been wonderful well let me go talk to your mom then i had to go and i don't know if you know what a willow switch is um nice and flexible and uh go get yourself one so i got to stand up for dinner that night but i was always his son even though i had made even though i had made my mom mad even though i had crossed the line more than once yet it never changed my relationship with my father my father loved me i respected him well i my heaven do i make mistakes should i do we all do but he says if you confess your faults you say faithful and just to forgive you of your sins and all unrighteous and all in righteousness okay so you confess it it's gone brother brother greene i know he made mention here he says you know repentance is one of the was one of the biggest bargains you have as a christian because once you confess it it's gone god can't even remind can't even find it i know there was one minister once he was having problems there was some people in the church those people were going through some problem and the minister said well lord show me what the problem is in their life so i can i can help them and god spoke back and says i can't show it to you because i can't find it because they've already confessed it see that's our relationship but you have to believe this it has i mean it's god's word i'm not trying to get you to believe it because i say no this is god's word this is what god himself has said but you have to grasp hold of this to the point where now all of a sudden it becomes a reality to your life brother brown or yeah and god who is rich in mercy he says i'm only saying this not to mix up doctrine but just straighten it out that we might get away from this fear and the scare what are we scared of what is this fear that grips us as christians you don't know who you are that was in 65. you're not willing to acknowledge what you are you're not willing to acknowledge you are a son and a daughter of god you want to look at your humanity you want to look at the problems around you you want to look at all the different things going on in your life but if you can if you can accept what god says you are if you can accept the fact god is your father and you can believe that and you can establish the relationship between a child and their and their father then god is there always for your be on your behalf god is always there to answer your prayer we i was we were at some place and this little kid he was running around just being a kid he's four or five maybe not even that old anyway he was running his trip and skipped and and skinned his knee what does he do runs to his dad his dad didn't say ah grow up be a man. no he picked the son up and put him on his shoulder and said oh it's all right son it's all right it'll be okay you know it's you know you'll be all right it's fun daddy loves you that'll take care of you dad will watch out for you a few minutes later put the kid down kid ran off to play but the father by showing his love to his child by the father comforting his son his son to gain strength and then could go out and play some more so whenever we stumble and fall and skin our knee we just run into our father father made a mistake today father i've had some problems today father i haven't quite lived up to your expectations i know but father i love you and he'll grab you in his loving arms and he'll wrap his arms around you and says but you're my child i loved you enough to die on the cross for you i've redeemed you back into myself we now have a relationship that is unbreakable now just go ahead just don't sin anymore try harder but see this is how it is this is the relationship i'm trying to get across he says you're not going to be but now you are sons of god say you always were sons of god for when god had you in his thinking from the beginning you have to some part of you and in your life your life it had to be there um he says and when you heard the word you you know that you come you know where you came from you know what was the truth god when you were born god placed his seed in you and that said when when the bible says and and and he quickened you to life what did he do you accepted jesus christ as your savior that seed gene that god had placed in you at the time of your birth that is what germinated that is what sprouted and that began to grow and brother branham says what it comes into your you get the holy ghost it comes in about the size of a button or your fingernail or something but he says the more you feed on god's word he says what happens is by you feeding on god's word by you praying by you coming and worshiping doing the things that christians do he says what does it do he says all of a sudden he begins to push at all the unbelief and all the things of the world until slowly but surely god cleanses you from the inside out under the law he said god wrote it on tables of stone but he said now he says in the christian dispensation i'm going to write in your heart and in your mind why because it will become a part of you you will live it because it's your nature to live it but you're still going to have to battle the the shell that you live in brother branham in the written exposition of the seven church ages he talks about he talks about satan he says he knows that if the people can get a true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army and if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church and by god's spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit satan is powerless before her so why aren't we an invincible army invincible means undefeatable it says when they get it the true revelation of the true church when you realize your bride when you realize you're not false the false vine but you're the true vine when you realize you are a part of god from the beginning when you realize it's god in you god changing your very nature from the inside out when you begin to understand your relationship that you have with god where where you and god have you and god literally become one in fact when you talk about oneness um brother branham he in one place i don't have that in front of me but he talks about one you see all the god was he poured into christ all the christ was important to the church see the church therefore collectively is the fullness of the godhead body he said don't you see the oneness of god he's elevating you to the place where you are part of the godhead at least that's that that's how i understand this it doesn't mean i can die for your sins it doesn't it i mean you know it's jesus christ was the only sinless character jesus christ was he came so that he could die on the cross so he could pay for my sin so there i mean that that doesn't doesn't even enter into the picture but i come to the place where i where where god it so lives in me until it's no longer i living but it's christ living living through me through me paul and he talks about in the he talks about there's a great mystery which has been hidden down through time what is this great mystery it's christ in you it's god living his life in you god doesn't want you to live a christian life he wants you to die to yourself so he can live his life through you because you'll never be able to live it by yourself you have to yield your bodies to to god and let god live his life through you jesus christ never performed one miracle he says that the father dwells in me he performs the miracle brother branham and so when they when what when god came down on the ohio river he said i just happen to be standing there and all of a sudden he's standing there and discernment line he's well i just happen to be standing there and god just using my voice and this had this miracle happen that merely happened well i just happened to be standing there and god performed it brother branham never took it to himself he never claimed that he had the power and the authority to do it by himself in fact one time when the angel said oh yeah he says you're going to take a message of divine healing around the world and so he would advertise in his effort in his first few campaigns he saw yeah bring the halt and the blind and the lame he says watch god perform miracles and the angel says don't do that. he did that two or three times and all of a sudden god says you think you can do it go for it brother brahm called the prayer line i think the people were hard of hearing one person came up hard of hearing when they left they were still hard of hearing next person came up i think and he prayed that person went off deaf i think the third one was a child if my memory serves me right and that's not always the best thing to go by but all of a sudden he stopped the meeting and he went back to god he began to pray lord what happened he says i told you not to do it the angel says the gift god placed in you is for god to use not you and so when he and he had to repent i mean i think he talked in the next few sermons like that he said i was like balaam but he said after that he took the gift and he gave it to back to god and said god now you use it he stands up there and here for a prayer line he said and he would just sit there and talk and talk and talk he said you know what i'm waiting for i'm waiting for him because if he doesn't come i can't do anything he acknowledged that but then i says he's here i take every spirit under control in the name of jesus christ because at that point god was there and god was directing and god was using him in that capacity but so it comes down into your lives you have the power to speak it but you have to have a relationship with god so you know what god's will is you have to come to a place in your relationship with god where you're on a personal name basis where he isn't god up in heaven someplace i mean i can be driving in my car and all of a sudden have a thought come along oh lord i don't understand that scripture could you help me out and then all of a sudden i'd be driving it along another thought will come another one thank you lord i was wondering about that one or else i ask a question he doesn't answer me that my pastor will get up the next service and he'll answer my question or something else will come along and i'm wondering about this and all of a sudden somebody else will be talking to another brother and he'll make he'll say something and ah that's what that means okay thank you lord but see god has different ways of speaking but you have to be you have to be sensitive enough to him to be able to recognize that and to be able to claim it for yourself i know we have in our church and i'm pretty sure it's in most places when we come to church we quieten ourselves down and try to forget about the today and try and forget about tomorrow and try to forget about the things that have happened and you try and get your mind upon god upon jesus christ so that all of a sudden when the word comes forth you're in a con in a condition where you could receive it well i just wrote my bible one sunday and i turned to isaiah 31 and again 31 1 it says woe unto them they go down to egypt for help and stay on horses and trust in chariots because they are many and horsemen because they are very strong but they look not unto the holy one of israel neither seek the lord and verse 3 it goes on now the egyptians are men and not god and the horses are flesh and not spirit and i got to think because this was the time when when hezekiah was the king of jerusalem and the the babylonian army had surrounded the city and he was going to go to egypt for help because egypt had only had the largest military available to be able to counter the this other army and isaiah went to him and says don't go to egypt trust god that would be awful difficult for the for hezekiah what about the people if these people storm the gates we can't withstand them if these people put their ladders up on the wall and cry crawl over the wall what are we going to do and isaiah says trust god god is trying you god wants you to trust him hezekiah did but anyway we my wife and i were flying to to india and uh we had landed in london after a six-hour flight i think it was and then we took off from london for a 10 or 12 hour flight or more to go to india and the food's not what it used to be but it's food and my wife wasn't eating i says well what's wrong he said i got this terrible headache i must have picked up something something when we were in london i said oh well all of our pills happen to be in the like i called the belly of the beast you know in the luggage compartment and uh well we'll get to indiana in a few hours you can take a couple of pills and go to bed and sleep and get some rest you know you're kicking you'll kick this thing and then god reminded me of isaiah woe to them that go down to egypt for hell egypt speaks of the world egypt speaks of self-reliance to me it does why do i always rely upon myself why do i always rely upon what i can do why do i always rely upon the things i believe i can accomplish rather than relying upon god the egyptians they're just men men is limited all men are limited no matter what they think they are no matter how great they are no matter how much money they got or whatever else they're limited so why do why do we put our trust there and see this is what god was trying to deal with me because when we were in india that that time there were a couple of three instances when we were there that i needed god then so there were some situations that arose and if it hadn't been for god's intervention we we would have been in tough shape but see god was trying to get me don't rely upon egypt don't rely upon yourself rely on me i have sent you i promise to take care of you and so if you put your trust in me i will i will do that and so here again it goes back to habakkuk habakkuk had to come to the time in his own in his relationship with god where if everything be gone i will still worship god nothing will happen which will change my relationship with my god and so here again it came to the place in my life that and in the last year so anyway i've come to this i i believe personally if i take my hand and i put it in god's and ask him ask him to hold my hand that he will guide me he will take care of me he'll provide for me i have to take and put my faith and my trust in him it's not believing for something it's not believing for healing it's not believing for riches it's not believing for anything no it's it's believing in the god that has made the promise and then taking the promise god has made to me and resting in that until god brings it to pass one last thing before i close with i was in we had youth meetings we were up in uh i think that was in probably in ohio when they had the meetings up there and i don't know who preached it really was kind of irrelevant but a minister would get up there and he would preach and eighty percent of the congregation the young people would head for the altars and we'd go around as ministers we pray for all these people i feel oh great you know they're finally getting what they want well the next night same thing figured well i wonder what's going on their night the same thing and i began to question i says lord what is the hindrance here why is it that they cannot receive because they're seeking they're asking they're crying out but why can't they break through why can't they receive and so all of a sudden some thoughts came in my mind and and the thoughts were there there was there was this lady and she was in a in a city or village whatever like that and and she was she was destitute she was going in the street her hair was a mess her clothes were all filthy and she was going around persons who were begging please could i have a little piece of bread please i'm so hungry just just give me just a little morsel of bread i've i haven't eaten for days and i'm just so hungry can you just spare me just a little something and this went on for a while and finally she says you know i understand there's a real kind man up on the mountain i'll go to him so she goes up to the mountain and she goes up there and she begins to knock and this good man opened the door and she begins to beg please can i have just a little morsel of bread i haven't eaten for three four days now and i'm just i'm just so hungry i just i just please please help me would you please help me and the good man he looks at her and says sweetheart why are you begging i wondered where you've been we have a banquet table set there with all the food that you've always liked and enjoyed oh and sweetheart look at your dress it's so filthy why don't you go in there oh take a nice hot bath and washing the water by the word and go take in one of the gowns we have plenty of them they're all pure white and stuff just go ahead and put one of them on and then come down and sit at the table and feast she was his wife she did not have to beg everything in the house belonged to her by virtue of who she was we are the bride of jesus christ we are the pure virtuous sinless bride of jesus christ everything you have need of is there you are hungry feed on his word you need you need forgiveness it's there for you he died on the cross for that the why his stripes are healed so you already have your healing everything you have natives at the cross it's not a matter of begging it's a matter of accepting it's a matter of having having faith in the one that has called you it's having faith in the god that has watched over you from the time of your birth even until this present day that is the god you need to have faith in and have faith to believe his word because if you can believe it like we like we read there in romans therefore being justified by faith believing that we are the pure virtuous sinless bride of jesus christ believing that we stand before him as if we had never sinned that we are pure and sinless as god himself is pure therefore being justified by this faith by actually believing this by having a relationship with god where we don't rely upon ourselves we don't rely upon our thoughts we don't rely upon our own abilities if we do have any no we rely totally upon him for literally everything i'm justified because he justified me i'm sinless because he told me i am i am healed because he already said i was and because i believe that i have peace through jesus christ let's pray our most gracious and loving heavenly father has been chopped up i know and for that i'm asking i'm sorry lord but lord your place is upon my heart and i don't know if the thought was managed to get across but lord we love you because you loved us you justified me because of what you did at the cross you healed me because of the stripes it was put on your back and lord you're
