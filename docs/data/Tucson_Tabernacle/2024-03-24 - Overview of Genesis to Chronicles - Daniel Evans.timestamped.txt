[24:59] is eternal and you're part of that
[25:03] you're part of that amen so brother ly
[25:07] and I think there was some sisters
[25:09] singing with you it's going to sing a
[25:12] little song special they'll have the
[25:15] words it's um a little bit of different
[25:18] language that we normally sing
[25:20] in but the words are easy they'll have
[25:23] them up
[25:23] [Music]
[25:27] there
[25:32] ladies on
[25:35] your good
[25:37] evening you're not really going to be
[25:40] having to deal with only me singing a
[25:42] song special because we all know that I
[25:44] can't sing but everybody knows that
[25:46] today is Palm Sunday right okay so Jesus
[25:50] entered Jerusalem many times if not
[25:52] hundreds but this time it was different
[25:54] from all the
[25:55] others we know that the crowds including
[25:59] the 12 disciples shouted hosana blessed
[26:03] is he that cometh in the name of the
[26:05] Lord hosan give now salvation that's
[26:08] what that means blessed is he that
[26:11] cometh in the name of the Lord they were
[26:12] saying what David has said in one of the
[26:15] Psalms Psalm
[26:18] 18:26
[26:21] actually blessed is he that cometh in
[26:24] the name of the Lord we have blessed you
[26:27] out of the house of the Lord blessed is
[26:29] he that cometh in the name of the Lord
[26:31] hosana blessed is he that cometh in the
[26:33] name of the Lord I'd like us to welcome
[26:35] the Lord in songs so I'm actually going
[26:36] to teach you a song and you're going to
[26:38] help me and the way that you're going to
[26:39] get me to be quiet and sit down is when
[26:41] you've got it so pay close attention
[26:44] because you're invested in this as well
[26:47] so I'd like us to welcome the Lord in
[26:50] song as many of them did that momentous
[26:52] Day in Hebrew Okay so we're going to
[26:55] speak in tongues tonight but there's an
[26:57] interpretation so won't cause anybody a
[27:00] problem the tune is simple and are the
[27:03] words so we'll speak in tongues the the
[27:05] words I don't know if you have that
[27:07] entered in yet there it is the words
[27:10] are
[27:12] habash
[27:14] Adonai so if you just say that with
[27:18] me
[27:20] habash Adonai let's try that
[27:25] again Adonai you say brother l i can say
[27:28] baruk I don't how don't know how to say
[27:30] baluk well if you say the letter R
[27:33] you'll notice when you say an R you go
[27:35] say r that that your tongue curls up
[27:39] towards your pallet towards the roof of
[27:40] your mouth when you say an R you maybe
[27:43] haven't noticed it but that's what it
[27:44] does if you leave your tongue laying
[27:47] flat then R becomes a and that's B
[27:52] that's the that's a Hebrew version of
[27:54] the letter R they call
[27:56] it they do it by keeping their tongue
[27:58] laying down so it's habash Adonai so now
[28:03] you've you've got that here's what it
[28:05] means the first word b means
[28:08] blessed ha is the ba is come or coming
[28:14] and the object of that is implied in its
[28:17] male gender here so Haba means blessed
[28:22] is he that
[28:24] comes blessed is he that comes B in Shem
[28:30] is name and we say Adonai it's actually
[28:34] the yud Jehovah capital l r d and our
[28:38] King James version but in Hebrew we
[28:41] never say the name of the Lord we always
[28:44] say Adonai which means Lord or sir it's
[28:47] a it's a respectful thing that we
[28:49] say so so now you have it in tongues
[28:53] bashem Adonai and you know that it means
[28:57] blessed is he that comes in the name of
[28:59] the Lord so we're going to sing and I'm
[29:01] going to have a lot of help from the
[29:02] ladies here because we all know that I
[29:04] can't sing but we're not going to stop
[29:05] until you
[29:07] participate so you've got it up there so
[29:10] go ahead
[29:17] [Music]
[29:27] ladies
[29:31] [Music]
[29:57] ad
[29:59] [Music]
[30:08] both there's another one that's coming
[30:11] in the name of the Lord tonight as our
[30:12] pastor comes let's sing it one more
[30:18] [Music]
[30:26] time sh
[30:28] [Music]
[30:36] there is no way I was going to come up
[30:37] to that microphone until that song was
[30:40] [Laughter]
[30:42] done good
[30:45] [Applause]
[30:47] job what a
[30:51] blessing I already forgot
[30:53] it I was gonna quote it and I forgot
[30:56] it
[31:02] no thank you sister
[31:04] Martha she gave me the words of the
[31:07] song Let's uh let's stand and let's open
[31:12] up the service in a word of
[31:15] prayer let's bow our heads Heavenly
[31:18] Father we're grateful Lord for your love
[31:21] to us we're grateful
[31:23] for the word of God that sits on this
[31:27] desk before me we thank you Father for
[31:30] all that you do for us we thank you for
[31:32] a loving church that we can come
[31:35] together tonight and talk about your
[31:37] word and enjoy the fellowship that we
[31:40] have with each other father we pray that
[31:42] you're with us tonight and that close
[31:45] our mouths Lord if it would be something
[31:48] that's not pleasing to you and when we
[31:50] open our mouths may it come forth as a
[31:53] word of God we pray in Jesus name amen
[31:57] God bless you all you can take your
[31:58] seats thank you to the
[32:02] Musicians we have
[32:04] a little different service tonight I'm
[32:07] I'm excited about it we started on our
[32:11] Bible
[32:11] study in uh over a year ago at the book
[32:15] of Acts and we went through the entire
[32:16] book of Acts and I felt in my heart
[32:18] let's go through the the every book of
[32:20] the Bible so we started in Genesis and
[32:24] we just finished through 2 Chronicles
[32:26] and brother ly
[32:29] suggested that hey why don't we take a
[32:31] break and see if there's any questions
[32:34] on anything that we've said to this
[32:37] point and uh I thought it was a very
[32:40] very good idea so I have a few questions
[32:44] that were just given to me but uh
[32:47] they're very very good questions so what
[32:50] we'll do is we're going to go through
[32:51] these questions and once we finish if we
[32:54] can finish in time then I would like to
[32:57] briefly go through each book of the
[33:00] Bible and get the the um audience more
[33:04] involved when we uh when we get to that
[33:07] so I think that'll be that'll be a fun
[33:09] time too it'll be enjoyable time so the
[33:12] first question is from The Book of
[33:15] Genesis it says here is it possible the
[33:19] serpent was just out in the garden and
[33:22] perhaps talked to Adam and Eve
[33:25] before understanding the Serpent's Seed
[33:28] was the serpent only allowed in the
[33:30] midst of the garden if they weren't
[33:33] allowed to eat of one certain tree were
[33:36] all the other trees actually fruit or
[33:39] something else very very good question
[33:42] very good question very deep question
[33:44] and I could spend a couple services on
[33:46] that but I'll answer B briefly let's
[33:49] turn to Genesis chapter
[33:56] 3 believe it's verse
[34:01] one I'll read the
[34:04] story Genesis 3:1 now the serpent was
[34:08] more subtile than any beast of the field
[34:11] which the Lord God had made he said unto
[34:14] the woman y hath God said ye shall not
[34:17] eat of every tree of the garden and the
[34:19] woman said unto the serpent we may eat
[34:22] of the fruit of the tree trees of the
[34:24] garden but the fruit of the tree which
[34:26] is in the midst of of the garden God
[34:29] hath said ye shall not eat of it neither
[34:31] shall ye touch it lest you
[34:35] die and then the serpent said unto the
[34:37] woman you shall not surely die so right
[34:39] there we see that the serpent was
[34:43] deceiving the woman number one we know
[34:45] that a snake can't talk so we know that
[34:49] this was not some sort of a reptile this
[34:51] was more like a man like looked like a
[34:54] human being talked like a human being
[34:57] Act Ed like a human being or else they
[35:01] could not have an intelligent
[35:03] conversation and we can we we don't know
[35:06] for sure about the first part of this
[35:10] question had they talked had this
[35:12] serpent talked to Adam and Eve
[35:16] before I would assume the answer was yes
[35:21] because they were together but but we
[35:23] don't know that for sure because it
[35:24] doesn't say this is really the first
[35:26] mention of this one of the questions
[35:29] that I asked one time was we see the
[35:33] serpent and obviously this serpent was a
[35:35] a male or was there a female
[35:39] serpent well there was there had to be
[35:42] because every Beast that was in the
[35:45] field he created male and
[35:48] female so if this serpent was not a
[35:51] human
[35:52] being which it
[35:54] wasn't a fully human being then there
[35:57] had to to be also a female serpent but
[35:59] as far as did they talk with Adam and
[36:02] Eve I I can't give a definitive answer
[36:06] understanding the serpent seed was the
[36:07] serpent allowed in the midst of the
[36:09] garden well I think that's a that's a
[36:12] little bit of a misconception here it's
[36:16] the serpent wasn't necessarily in the
[36:19] midst of the garden the tree was in the
[36:23] midst of the garden so the serpent
[36:27] probably like every other animal it was
[36:29] in this area so it's probably free to go
[36:31] as it as it pleased like Adam and Eve
[36:34] were and and then it says if they
[36:38] weren't allowed to eat of one certain
[36:40] tree were all of the other trees
[36:42] actually for fruit or something
[36:44] else we know that there's a fruit
[36:48] metaphorically speaking many times in
[36:50] the Bible it talks about the fruit of
[36:53] the womb we know that that be fruitful
[36:57] and multiply it doesn't mean plant
[37:00] orange trees and and grow fruit it means
[37:04] have children so we see that word fruit
[37:08] is metaphorically speaking there but
[37:10] then there were also fruit trees and
[37:11] there also trees all throughout the
[37:13] garden but there was also this tree that
[37:16] this woman ate of was the tree of
[37:19] knowledge of Good and Evil but there was
[37:22] another tree in the garden do you know
[37:25] what it
[37:26] was
[37:28] of life and what was that tree of
[37:32] life amen it was Jesus it was Jesus and
[37:38] only life can come from Christ right
[37:41] there so we see that it wasn't
[37:46] necessarily an actual
[37:48] fruit Adam and Eve could eat of every
[37:51] tree of the garden they could do pretty
[37:52] much whatever they wanted except they
[37:54] just couldn't do this one thing because
[37:57] that one thing would bring in sin and
[37:59] human nature
[38:02] wanted to bring in sin you tell your
[38:05] kids you can do whatever you want you
[38:07] can play in the
[38:09] playground but don't get up on that
[38:12] slide because it's broken you turn your
[38:14] back what they're what are they going to
[38:15] do right up on the slide it's human
[38:18] nature it's sad but that's what happened
[38:20] there in the Garden of Eden let's go
[38:22] let's uh let's read the end end of this
[38:25] so we continue on
[38:29] and the serpent said unto the woman ye
[38:30] shall not surely die for God doth know
[38:33] that in the day that you eat thereof
[38:35] your days shall be open that your eyes
[38:37] shall be
[38:38] opened and ye shall be as Gods knowing
[38:40] good and evil and when the woman saw
[38:42] that the tree was good for food and that
[38:44] it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree
[38:47] to be desired to make one wise she took
[38:51] of the fruit thereof and did eat and
[38:53] gave to her
[38:54] husband with her and he did eat in the
[38:56] eyes of both both them both were opened
[38:59] and they knew that they were naked and
[39:00] they sewed fig leaves together and made
[39:03] themselves
[39:04] aprons so they sewed these fig leaves
[39:06] together why would they do
[39:09] that and how would they know that they
[39:12] are naked from eating an apple or an
[39:15] orange or whatever it is it was an act
[39:18] that they did and then they understood
[39:20] human biology let's continue on and they
[39:24] heard the voice of the Lord Walking In
[39:25] The Garden in the cool of the day and
[39:27] Adam and his wife hid themselves from
[39:29] the presence of the Lord God amongst the
[39:30] Trees of the garden and the Lord God
[39:33] called unto Adam and said unto him where
[39:35] art thou and he said I heard thy voice
[39:37] in the garden and I was afraid because I
[39:39] was
[39:40] naked and I hid myself what's the first
[39:43] thing that I would ask if I was
[39:47] God he said who told you that you were
[39:51] naked hast thou eaten of the tree
[39:53] whereof I commanded thee that thou
[39:55] should not eat and the man said said the
[39:57] woman whom thou gavest me to be with me
[40:00] she gave me of the tree and I did eat
[40:03] and the Lord said unto the woman what is
[40:06] this that thou Hast done and the woman
[40:08] said the serpent beguiled me and I did
[40:12] eat he tricked her he deceived
[40:16] her and the Lord God said unto the
[40:19] serpent because thou Hast done this Thou
[40:21] Art cursed above all cattle and above
[40:23] every beast of the field upon thy belly
[40:25] shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat
[40:28] all the days of thy life now that we now
[40:30] we see
[40:33] the appearance of the modern
[40:36] Serpent and I will put enmity between
[40:39] thee and the woman and between thy seed
[40:42] and her
[40:44] seed what is a
[40:46] seed right it's your babies it's your
[40:50] Offspring so that we know the serpent
[40:52] had a seed here and we know um that the
[40:58] woman has a seed which is Christ the
[41:02] seed of the woman and we see hatred
[41:06] between them enmity between them from
[41:08] this point all the way to the end now
[41:11] listen to
[41:14] this now they had just committed this
[41:17] act God is going one by one he goes to
[41:20] the serpent I love the way that he
[41:22] doesn't ask the serpent anything he just
[41:25] curses him he doesn't
[41:27] he doesn't care what he
[41:29] says and unto the woman he
[41:32] said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow
[41:35] in thy conception in sorrow Thou shalt
[41:39] bring forth
[41:42] children you're
[41:44] pregnant and not just with one
[41:47] child children and thy desire shall be
[41:50] to thy husband and he shall rule over
[41:52] thee and unto Adam he said because thou
[41:55] Hast hearkened under the voice of thy
[41:56] wife and Hast eaten of the tree which I
[41:58] commanded thee saying Thou shalt not eat
[42:00] of it curse it as the
[42:02] ground for thy sake in sorrow shalt thou
[42:06] eat of it all the days of thy life
[42:08] thorns and thistles shall shall it bring
[42:10] forth to thee and thou shalt eat of the
[42:13] herb of the field in the sweat of thy
[42:15] face shall thou eat bread Thou shalt
[42:17] return under the ground for out of it
[42:21] was thou taken for dust Thou Art and
[42:23] unto dust Thou shalt return very very
[42:26] common in a funeral that scripture is
[42:30] read so um I think we have both to
[42:35] answer shortly I think we have both we
[42:37] have metaphorically speaking we have um
[42:40] the the The Offspring and multiplying
[42:44] and then Naturally Speaking we have the
[42:47] fruit that is in the garden and the the
[42:50] um the fruit that they can eat of and
[42:56] consume
[42:58] and uh was the serpent only allowed in
[43:00] the midst of the garden that's where the
[43:02] tree was is in the midst of the
[43:05] garden I don't know of anything that I
[43:08] could answer that was he only allowed
[43:09] right there so the next
[43:12] question also from The Book of Genesis
[43:15] what is the significance of MDC he has
[43:18] spoken little about yet highly spoken
[43:20] about so
[43:22] MDC is if you remember Abraham met this
[43:25] man mzc very very mysterious man also
[43:29] called the king of Salem and this man is
[43:33] mentioned in the Book of Psalms and he's
[43:35] also mentioned in the book of Hebrews
[43:37] and the book of Hebrews gives a very
[43:38] very good example if you want to hear a
[43:41] wonderful wonderful sermon about mzc go
[43:45] back I believe it was in
[43:48] 196 it'll be between 63 and 65 I think
[43:52] it was 65 that brother Brandon preached
[43:54] a sermon called who is thus mzc it was
[43:57] preached at I believe it was um it was
[43:59] preached at a junior high school in
[44:01] Jeffersonville my grandpa and this is
[44:04] off the subject but it's a it's a funny
[44:06] story my grandpa was a deacon in in the
[44:09] brandom Tabernacle at this time this is
[44:11] way back as I said in the mid-60s and
[44:16] they were everybody was waiting to get
[44:18] in and excited to get in and my
[44:21] grandpa the deacons opened the doors and
[44:24] the people just ran in
[44:27] and were throwing elbows and doing
[44:30] everything else and they got into their
[44:32] seats and my grandpa and the other
[44:35] deacons they got together and they went
[44:38] out into the seats and said everyone get
[44:43] out and they kicked them all out out of
[44:46] the auditorium and he said then they
[44:48] said now every one of you come in and
[44:51] act like
[44:52] Christians so then they all came back in
[44:55] but as far as mzc little is spoken about
[44:59] mzc but this is a very very deep subject
[45:05] brother brandham taught on having that
[45:08] we
[45:09] are a Triune being we've heard of the
[45:13] Trinity Father Son and Holy Ghost
[45:15] brother brandom said that there's not
[45:18] three Gods but there is some truth to
[45:21] being a Triune being and he said that
[45:24] God is a Triune being and he says we are
[45:26] a Triune being the father Son and the
[45:29] Holy Spirit the same God just in
[45:31] different manifestations and he said all
[45:33] of us are also Triune beings we have H I
[45:37] believe he said Body Soul and Spirit so
[45:41] there is a Daniel
[45:44] Evans that is
[45:48] somewhere in another
[45:51] dimension and then there is this one
[45:54] that you see right here
[45:57] the one that's in the other dimension
[45:59] Lily it's about your
[46:00] age but this one you see is not your age
[46:03] this is a corruptible body and then
[46:06] there is another body waiting for Daniel
[46:10] Evans on the other side that is the
[46:12] glorified body so Jesus when he came he
[46:17] came in a fleshly body just like mine
[46:21] just like yours this body got old this
[46:24] body got sick this body was hung on the
[46:29] cross and
[46:31] died it was what we call a
[46:35] corruptible body remember the I believe
[46:38] it was the psalm that said his body
[46:39] shall not see
[46:41] corruption even the body of Jesus Christ
[46:43] would have
[46:45] rotted that that was that body but then
[46:48] there was this other
[46:51] Jesus that was looked like him and it
[46:55] was him but it was in another dimmension
[47:00] and if you listen to that wonderful
[47:02] sermon who is this
[47:04] mestic you'll see that brother brandom
[47:07] said that that
[47:10] body that theophany body he calls it
[47:13] half the time he calls it a theop
[47:15] theophany body and the other half of the
[47:17] time he calls it a Celestial body same
[47:19] thing he uses them
[47:21] interchangeably that body was the one
[47:25] who went to Abraham and talked with him
[47:30] then brother brandom said one time he
[47:33] was he was telling a story now I don't
[47:34] know if brother Brandon meant this to be
[47:36] Doctrine but it really it really aligns
[47:40] aligns the same he said that
[47:43] when the Lord Jesus died on the cross
[47:47] and when he went down into this place to
[47:53] bring
[47:55] out the Souls that were that that had
[47:59] had been in a waiting place this place
[48:02] called maybe Paradise or it's it's a
[48:05] it's an area that
[48:07] wasn't heaven but it was a waiting place
[48:10] it was it was
[48:12] almost it was just a waiting
[48:15] Place Jesus went down there now this is
[48:18] Brother brandom's
[48:20] story and there was Abraham and his wife
[48:25] Sarah and Abraham Hears A his brother
[48:28] brandom's dramatizing it he says Abraham
[48:30] here's a knock on the
[48:33] door and he opens the
[48:36] door and he looks and he says honey look
[48:40] it's the one that met us under the oak
[48:43] tree which was
[48:46] MDC so it looked exactly the
[48:51] same as that man Jesus that went down
[48:55] and got them same person just a
[49:00] different um just a a different body a
[49:04] different
[49:09] dimension he's spoken little about yet
[49:12] highly highly spoken about um if you
[49:15] want to read about mezic I I believe
[49:17] it's
[49:17] Hebrews chapter 6 I
[49:20] think I would recommend that and then I
[49:25] would recommend
[49:28] Hebrews Hebrews chapter
[49:30] 7 yeah Hebrews chapter 6 and 7 if you
[49:33] want to read it in the Bible and then
[49:35] brother brandom uses those scriptures
[49:36] and who is this MDC wonderful wonderful
[49:40] sermon next question Jacob was angry
[49:44] with Simeon and Levi for avenging dena's
[49:47] death for avenging dena's assault that
[49:51] was their
[49:52] sister was there a better
[49:55] alternative or was Jacob only concerned
[49:59] with being outnumbered that is a wellth
[50:02] thought out question brother L do you
[50:03] want to tell do you want to tell the
[50:04] story of what happened and and then
[50:07] maybe give the explanation I'll I'll
[50:09] leave
[50:10] the I'll leave the question right here
[50:15] okay what is it that Simeon and Levi had
[50:20] done if you remember that Dino went down
[50:23] into the town of sheum to hang out visit
[50:27] the other young ladies that were there
[50:29] get used to this new neighborhood they'd
[50:30] moved into and and the the the son of
[50:35] the main guy there took a shine to her
[50:38] and carried her away
[50:42] and misbehaved raped her so the brothers
[50:46] got really incensed about this as they
[50:49] should have and Simeon and Levi then
[50:53] took something that God had given them
[50:56] as a sign of their separation that is
[51:00] circumcision and weaponized it turned
[51:04] this symbol of God this symbol of of of
[51:08] uh election and turned it into a weapon
[51:12] so they had all the men agree to be
[51:15] circumcised and while they were
[51:17] recovering from this these two guys went
[51:19] in and slaughtered them and they didn't
[51:22] just slaughter them but when we read in
[51:24] at the end of Genesis when Jacob is uh
[51:27] is giving his uh His blessings on his
[51:31] deathbed he talks about these two guys
[51:34] and what they had done and even to the
[51:35] point where they had um hamstrung the
[51:38] animals it was just it was brutal and it
[51:41] was cruel it was far beyond it was far
[51:43] beyond Revenge but they had weaponized
[51:46] this sign from God and and I I think
[51:50] that that is
[51:52] the the root cause of of the anger that
[51:56] was there Jacob also at this point uh
[52:00] Jacob is still
[52:02] Jacob he his name may have been changed
[52:05] to Israel but he was still there was a
[52:07] lot of Jacob still there there I you
[52:09] know
[52:11] I I desire to be a Christian but there's
[52:14] far too much Lyall Johnson that's still
[52:17] here okay so there was an awful lot of
[52:20] Jacob that was still in Israel and and
[52:23] that man and so he was very concerned
[52:25] for his own safy remember when when he
[52:27] came back from uh from Syria and he came
[52:30] back uh to see his brother Esau he ran
[52:33] away because he was afraid he was going
[52:34] to be killed he came back and Esau had
[52:36] this big crowd of guys coming and he was
[52:38] afraid again and and and so Jacob has a
[52:41] natural tendency to be afraid of people
[52:45] that might be angry with him and uh
[52:48] there's there's every reason to believe
[52:50] that the guys in this town are all dead
[52:53] but they have a lot of neighbors and
[52:55] there's reason to believe Jacob is well
[52:58] he says I'm very concerned we're going
[52:59] to be outnumbered and he says we're
[53:01] going to be the equivalent of extension
[53:04] their nostrils where they're they're
[53:06] really not going to like us we got to
[53:07] get out of here because we're in danger
[53:09] now because of because of what you've
[53:12] done um and so I I I think I think there
[53:17] is a better alternate not a better
[53:19] alternative for for the Revenge
[53:23] necessarily uh but that the the root
[53:27] uh Badness that happened here apart from
[53:29] the from that Slaughter was weaponizing
[53:32] this this symbol you want to add
[53:35] something to
[53:37] that
[53:41] okay the next question we have here is
[53:44] is is about the umum and the Thum do we
[53:47] know exactly what this is and how it
[53:49] works it's referenced many times but
[53:52] what specifically comes to mind is 1st
[53:54] Samuel 28:6 what is the IR that Saul
[53:57] consulted the Lord through it well
[54:01] the there was a breastplate that Aon war
[54:05] that was created that had 12 Stones on
[54:07] it and he was to wear it at certain
[54:10] times uh and and it was representing the
[54:13] 12 tribes of Israel the 12 Clans if you
[54:17] will and later when Joshua was going to
[54:21] be installed as the person to succeed
[54:24] I'm sorry I I keep thinking I have a
[54:25] microphone here but it's here when if
[54:28] I'm not speaking loud enough just go
[54:30] like that and I won't think that you're
[54:31] saying oh good job you're saying speak
[54:34] up okay okay so you don't have to worry
[54:37] about being confused that you're
[54:38] accusing me of doing a good job you're
[54:40] telling me to speak up okay so so elaser
[54:45] who was then the high priest at that
[54:47] time was the was to wear that ir and
[54:50] thunder when he installed Joshua as the
[54:52] high priest now we're we're told I
[54:55] believe that uh that sometimes they'd go
[54:58] and inquire they'd have a question and
[54:59] they'd ask the Lord what what what's the
[55:01] answer here and they'd look for this
[55:03] kind of a flashing light amongst the
[55:05] stones if you will the word urm is is
[55:07] again it's a Hebrew word and or or is
[55:10] light so orim is literally lights so
[55:14] there would be this flashing on the
[55:17] stones
[55:18] um the the particular story of 1 Samuel
[55:22] 286 that's when Saul is is kind of at
[55:25] his wits end and he goes to the prophets
[55:27] they won't answer him he goes here they
[55:28] won't answer he goes to the irum and and
[55:31] gets no response Lord should I do this
[55:34] or should I
[55:36] not he doesn't get any response so then
[55:38] he goes to the witch at Endor and and
[55:41] the story he devolves uh from that point
[55:45] so the irum at We Believe then would be
[55:48] the that breastplate that they
[55:50] apparently still had possession of at
[55:52] that time later uh when we get to the
[55:55] post exilic period and hear about Ezra
[55:58] and Nehemiah discover that there is no
[56:00] priest that has the um they they don't
[56:02] have it anymore so they can't inquire of
[56:04] it but it was one of the ways that they
[56:07] used to get an answer from the Lord
[56:11] remember this is before this is before
[56:14] uh they had the infilling of the holy
[56:16] spirit this was the era of God above us
[56:19] not God with us and not God in
[56:22] us there's another question here 2
[56:26] Samuel why didn't David do anything
[56:29] against Ammon for assaulting Tamar there
[56:31] seems to be a theme for the mistreatment
[56:33] of
[56:35] women Amon Aman was the firstborn of
[56:39] David so he was the Crown Prince if you
[56:42] will uh just due to birth order and and
[56:47] we we read or touched on the we when we
[56:50] studied 2 Samuel about how Amon had
[56:54] deceived his half sister and then had
[56:58] assaulted her and then sent her away and
[57:01] she was the
[57:03] sister of uh of our
[57:05] friend well he wasn't our friend
[57:08] Absalom and uh so so absolum then wanted
[57:12] revenge and abelam then got revenge and
[57:15] and and killed Ammon and he had this
[57:16] party we we read about all that and the
[57:18] other King's sons all fled and and and
[57:21] so forth so why didn't David do anything
[57:24] about it I don't know that's the honest
[57:28] answer it was the Crown Prince maybe he
[57:31] thought that that if we just sort of
[57:33] ignore this it'll sort of go away this
[57:36] sort of thing unfortunately seemed to be
[57:39] not all that uncommon as we just read
[57:41] about the the the example of uh din
[57:45] assault uh and so there seems to be a
[57:48] theme to the mistreatment of women and
[57:51] and I would say that that is a theme
[57:53] that does appear to be there that that
[57:56] there is often times uh crimes that are
[58:00] unanswered that are not uh brought to
[58:03] Justice if you will it doesn't mean that
[58:05] what they did was right or that it was
[58:07] approved it was ignored it was brushed
[58:10] under the carpet so to speak
[58:13] um okay next
[58:17] question judges 19 there's a very tough
[58:20] account to read of what happened to the
[58:22] Levites concubine he reclaims her but
[58:25] seems just missive of her to let her be
[58:27] assaulted then again seems callous
[58:29] against her when he opens the door the
[58:31] next morning and tells her to get up why
[58:33] did he cut her up and send her body
[58:35] parts around the coast of Israel judges
[58:38] 19 I think I'm going to step back on
[58:40] that
[58:46] one
[58:48] um along with what brother Lyle
[58:51] said the um the
[58:54] women back then
[58:56] we didn't live in a they didn't live in
[58:58] a modern society that we we live in
[59:00] where women had rights women had the
[59:02] right to vote women had the right to own
[59:04] property and that type of thing they
[59:05] didn't have that back then women were
[59:07] basically property and it was just
[59:11] different than
[59:13] today that's that's the best way to say
[59:16] it is that it doesn't mean that there
[59:18] wasn't love between a man and a woman or
[59:22] there wasn't um there wasn't in some in
[59:26] es there wasn't monogamy between a man
[59:28] and a woman but things were just very
[59:32] different number one many of the men
[59:34] were were dead so there were a lot more
[59:36] women than there were men back then
[59:38] because of wars and and that that type
[59:40] of thing so it it was just things were
[59:44] thought of back then so the reason let
[59:47] me read this again very tough accounted
[59:49] to read of what happened to the Levites
[59:51] concubine and and number one also the
[59:54] Book of Judges
[59:56] is it's a tragedy of a book this shows
[1:00:01] how low morals can SN when you don't
[1:00:06] have God in your life you don't when and
[1:00:09] also when you don't have good
[1:00:11] leadership it shows
[1:00:14] that it says in the book of Justice many
[1:00:16] times that every man did which was right
[1:00:18] in his own
[1:00:19] eyes and those things there was no
[1:00:22] morality being taught it just wasn't it
[1:00:26] was a different time and it was a very
[1:00:28] very low time in history very tough
[1:00:31] account so why did he cut her up and
[1:00:33] send her body parts around the coast of
[1:00:35] Israel um he did it to stir everybody up
[1:00:39] he wanted to go to battle and I believe
[1:00:42] it was against Benjamin um The Tribe of
[1:00:44] Benjamin the city of Benjamin and it
[1:00:47] upset him which of course it would have
[1:00:51] have upset anyone so he um Cuts this
[1:00:56] woman up and sends her to the different
[1:01:00] tribes and tells them the story and then
[1:01:04] they get fired up and it worked what he
[1:01:09] wanted to do and they almost wiped out
[1:01:12] the entire race the entire Tribe of
[1:01:16] Benjamin because of all that that
[1:01:18] happened next
[1:01:20] question I uh brother L this one has a l
[1:01:24] next to it so I'll give this this one to
[1:01:26] you it says here Ahab asked Jehoshaphat
[1:01:28] to go to war with him and while ahab's
[1:01:31] prophets said Ahab would be successful
[1:01:34] Jehoshaphat asked him to find a prophet
[1:01:37] of the Lord who were Ahab ahab's
[1:01:41] prophets that Jehoshaphat didn't want to
[1:01:45] take their word very good
[1:01:51] question yeah that is a very good
[1:01:54] question so we know that the kingdom is
[1:01:58] split at this time into a northern
[1:02:00] kingdom called Israel that was
[1:02:01] established under jeroboam and was
[1:02:03] established under worshiping these these
[1:02:06] gods that he created and and put these
[1:02:09] Idols in Dan and in bethl and that he
[1:02:12] created the feasts and he created
[1:02:14] holidays he just created a whole new
[1:02:15] fake religion so that people wouldn't
[1:02:17] want to go down to Judah and worship in
[1:02:20] Jerusalem um so that's the context of
[1:02:24] Ahab and his
[1:02:26] uh and his reign in Israel secondly his
[1:02:31] wife was Jezebel she was uh from uh from
[1:02:35] siden so she was a gentile and and and
[1:02:39] also from a from a heathen place if you
[1:02:41] will and she had great influence Ahab
[1:02:43] was was weak morally in many other ways
[1:02:46] but he was a weak man so she could
[1:02:48] manipulate him and she did so who are
[1:02:50] these 400 prophets they were the
[1:02:52] ministers if you will within this
[1:02:56] Society of this religion that was a
[1:02:58] false religion to begin with and and
[1:03:00] brother brandham talks about this and
[1:03:02] and and says well the Lord's you well it
[1:03:04] it says in the Bible well well uh who
[1:03:07] who who will we send uh to convince uh
[1:03:11] these prophets to tell Ahab to go into
[1:03:13] battle so he'll be killed and fulfill
[1:03:15] the word that was prophesied over him by
[1:03:17] a real prophet and the lying Spirit
[1:03:19] comes up and says I can do it and uh God
[1:03:23] says yeah yeah you got it you got it you
[1:03:26] go down there you take care of this for
[1:03:28] me and I think brother brandom said that
[1:03:30] these were Seminary trained yeah yeah so
[1:03:34] so so you've got basically prophets of a
[1:03:37] false religion to begin with and so
[1:03:40] they're they're going their way and why
[1:03:42] is Jehoshaphat questioning this because
[1:03:44] he's an Israel he's allying himself with
[1:03:46] Ahab for some reason and the Lord kind
[1:03:48] of scolds him for that a bit later but
[1:03:52] but he's he he he knows that he's in a
[1:03:55] place where where they were supposed to
[1:03:57] have been worshiping the true God but
[1:03:59] they've gone off into this other place
[1:04:01] and so he says I'm glad that all your
[1:04:03] guys agree it's a little unusual to get
[1:04:05] 400 people in one place and all agree on
[1:04:07] something but you all your guys are
[1:04:09] somehow agreeing but
[1:04:12] but I've got this funny itch in the back
[1:04:14] of my neck or something I don't isn't
[1:04:16] there one more and he says well yeah
[1:04:18] there's this guy Mya this son of but I
[1:04:20] hate him because he never says good
[1:04:21] stuff about me and Jas is probably
[1:04:24] thinking well yeah yeah Elijah never did
[1:04:26] have anything good to say about you I
[1:04:27] want to hear what this guy has to say so
[1:04:29] so they bring M out and he prophesies
[1:04:32] the truth and Ahab says put this guy in
[1:04:35] jail feed him bread and water when I
[1:04:37] come back in Victory I'll take care of
[1:04:38] him and M says if you come back at all
[1:04:41] God never spoke to me and then we know
[1:04:43] the story that Ahab went out and and uh
[1:04:46] was destroyed have a
[1:04:48] question why did J B why did josph still
[1:04:53] go to battle and and and
[1:04:57] without having time to research this I'd
[1:04:59] say that it's because he was already in
[1:05:02] Alliance with Ahab so so jehos ofet goes
[1:05:06] out to battle with
[1:05:08] him and as I say later when they come
[1:05:12] back uh the Lord scolds joset for having
[1:05:15] done that and says joset you're a good
[1:05:17] guy but why he had exactly the same
[1:05:20] question why did you go out there with
[1:05:22] Ahab I even sent a prophets and said
[1:05:24] he's going to be killed you
[1:05:26] but but joset did that and when when the
[1:05:28] battle turned not the way that he wanted
[1:05:31] you know the first thing you read in in
[1:05:33] in the account of it is it he turned
[1:05:35] tail in his Chariot and went the other
[1:05:37] way as fast as he could go um he was
[1:05:40] dressed up as a king and Ahab was
[1:05:42] disguised as a soldier and and uh Ahab
[1:05:45] got an arrow and Jehoshaphat outran the
[1:05:48] arrows apparently
[1:05:50] okay
[1:05:52] okay uh another question here from First
[1:05:56] Kings same chapter please ex explain the
[1:05:59] exchange between the Lord and the host
[1:06:00] of Heaven in verse 19 who is the host
[1:06:03] and what was the spirit reference in
[1:06:04] verse 21 I think of God in heaven and
[1:06:07] Satan and all his followers down in hell
[1:06:10] are they all in the same place are they
[1:06:12] in each other's space brother
[1:06:19] Daniel I love that question in fact I
[1:06:23] had a conversation with uh someone this
[1:06:26] morning after service about this very
[1:06:30] same thing that's going on right
[1:06:32] here um remember what I
[1:06:36] said that there's a a spirit another
[1:06:40] Daniel that's somewhere else and then
[1:06:43] there's this Daniel and then there's a
[1:06:46] Daniel that's going to be that's going
[1:06:47] to be in this eternal body there's
[1:06:50] things going on in heaven brothers and
[1:06:52] sisters that we don't
[1:06:54] understand
[1:06:56] but one thing I do know from The Book of
[1:06:58] Revelation and I didn't we didn't have
[1:07:00] any time to prepare for these so I
[1:07:02] didn't have time to look up the the
[1:07:04] scriptures or the quotes on
[1:07:06] these but one thing that we do
[1:07:09] know is that Satan is not in hell today
[1:07:15] Satan is actually at the Throne of God
[1:07:18] right now and he is accusing each one of
[1:07:23] us before the Lord and and he is saying
[1:07:27] that you sinned you you said this wrong
[1:07:31] you blasphemed the Holy Ghost you can't
[1:07:33] be forgiven he's saying all of these
[1:07:36] things before the Lord right now and we
[1:07:38] are
[1:07:39] feeling many times that Spirit of
[1:07:43] condemnation God is not a spirit of
[1:07:47] condemnation Jesus Christ is the spirit
[1:07:49] of Salvation and
[1:07:52] Redemption and not a ACC Ching spirit so
[1:07:59] my point in saying that is there's
[1:08:01] something going on in heaven that we
[1:08:03] might not totally understand but I want
[1:08:06] to read a story to you that you might
[1:08:09] find very very interested interesting
[1:08:12] and it might answer this question that
[1:08:16] is asked here it says here please
[1:08:18] explain the exchange between the Lord of
[1:08:20] hosts in heaven in verse 19 who is the
[1:08:23] host and what was the spirit referenced
[1:08:25] in verse 21 I'm going to read it here in
[1:08:27] a minute I think of God in heaven and
[1:08:30] Satan and all his followers I think of
[1:08:33] God in heaven of God in heaven and Satan
[1:08:38] and all his followers down in hell are
[1:08:40] they all in the same place are they in
[1:08:44] each other's space so let's go to First
[1:08:47] Kings chapter
[1:08:50] 22 love these questions first Kings
[1:08:54] chapter 22
[1:08:59] verse
[1:09:08] 19 uh we'll start with verse n uh First
[1:09:11] Kings
[1:09:24] 22
[1:09:29] I'm in second
[1:09:31] Kings
[1:09:33] sorry I was very confused for a minute
[1:09:37] all right First
[1:09:41] Kings chapter
[1:09:48] 22 verse 18 let's start with Verse 18
[1:09:50] and the king of Israel said unto
[1:09:52] Jehoshaphat did not I tell thee that
[1:09:55] thou that he would Pro prophesy no good
[1:09:57] concerning me but evil and he and he
[1:10:01] said hear thou therefore the word of the
[1:10:03] Lord this is the prophet MAA speaking I
[1:10:07] saw the Lord sitting on his throne and
[1:10:10] all the host of Heaven standing by him
[1:10:14] on his right hand and on his left hand
[1:10:17] and the Lord said who shall persuade
[1:10:19] Ahab that he might go and fall at ramoth
[1:10:23] Gilead and one said on this Manner and
[1:10:25] another on that manner and there came
[1:10:27] forth a spirit and stood before the Lord
[1:10:30] and said I will persuade him and the
[1:10:34] Lord said unto him wherewith and he said
[1:10:37] I will go forth and I will be a lying
[1:10:40] spirit in the mouth of All His
[1:10:44] prophets and he said Thou shalt persuade
[1:10:47] him and Prevail also go forth and do
[1:10:51] so very
[1:10:53] strange thing that was going on in up in
[1:10:57] heaven right there let me read to you
[1:11:00] brother brandom by the way references
[1:11:02] this story all the time many many times
[1:11:06] let me read to you a quote brother
[1:11:08] brandom says
[1:11:11] this well the one was saying this one or
[1:11:14] that one and after a while a evil spirit
[1:11:17] a lying Spirit came up from underneath
[1:11:19] and said if you'll just permit me I'm a
[1:11:22] lying Spirit I'll go down and get in all
[1:11:24] of them preachers because they haven't
[1:11:27] got the Holy
[1:11:29] Ghost that's the
[1:11:31] difference between Jezebel's
[1:11:33] prophets because they haven't got the
[1:11:35] Holy Ghost and I'll make them see
[1:11:37] they're just School trained boys and
[1:11:40] I'll go down and I'll get in every one
[1:11:42] of them and deceive them and make them
[1:11:44] prophesy a
[1:11:46] lie that's the way we'll deceive so he
[1:11:49] went
[1:11:50] down and he said and God said you have
[1:11:53] my permission to go
[1:11:56] and he went
[1:11:58] down and got into those false prophets
[1:12:01] School trained Ministry and made them
[1:12:04] prophesy a lie it was a lying Spirit
[1:12:07] working to the will of God let let me
[1:12:10] just something else you might see here a
[1:12:12] minute
[1:12:14] so the the main part of this is it was a
[1:12:18] lying Spirit working the will of God
[1:12:23] then brother brandom quotes the story
[1:12:26] about um turning someone over to the
[1:12:29] destruction of the flesh he goes to the
[1:12:31] New Testament I believe it's in First
[1:12:33] Corinthians and uh well we can just go
[1:12:36] keep going up if you would please um he
[1:12:40] keep
[1:12:42] going uh keep going I think I'm
[1:12:51] right uh maybe it's a different quote
[1:12:54] what's that
[1:12:57] oh okay okay well he he mentions First
[1:13:00] Corinthians and what had happened was
[1:13:01] this this man was sleeping with his
[1:13:04] stepmother and it it just causing
[1:13:06] problems so Paul instructs the
[1:13:07] Corinthians he said tell this man to to
[1:13:12] leave and turn him over to this to Satan
[1:13:15] for the destruction of his
[1:13:17] flesh so then what happens is Satan then
[1:13:22] now is loosed on this person and God
[1:13:26] uses the influence of Satan to make this
[1:13:29] person sick or cause problems and then
[1:13:32] that person will get so
[1:13:35] low that that person will then return to
[1:13:39] God you've heard of people taking other
[1:13:41] people out from under the
[1:13:43] blood that's not that's not that's that
[1:13:48] is it's actually a kind thing it's
[1:13:51] actually something you do in compassion
[1:13:54] because if you are right in doing it
[1:13:57] that person will stop
[1:14:00] sinning not just not doing what your
[1:14:02] church says but that person will stop
[1:14:06] sinning and return into the fold and if
[1:14:10] you look in second Corinthians that man
[1:14:12] had come back and had
[1:14:14] repented so we see that there God can
[1:14:18] use these evil spirits for his own to to
[1:14:22] accomplish his own will so now we see
[1:14:24] the question is there is this meeting
[1:14:27] that's going on in heaven it happened
[1:14:30] before happened in two other places that
[1:14:32] I know for sure if we go to the Book of
[1:14:37] Job And this is simply amazing Book of
[1:14:41] Job chapter
[1:14:43] 1
[1:14:46] verse
[1:14:50] 6 now there was a
[1:14:53] day when the sons of of God came to the
[1:14:56] Pres came to present themselves before
[1:14:58] the Lord remember I was talking about
[1:15:01] our theophany body our Celestial body
[1:15:05] that other body that's in the presence
[1:15:07] of God right
[1:15:09] now that the sons of
[1:15:12] God came to present themselves before
[1:15:15] the Lord and Satan came also among them
[1:15:20] so he was able to go to the same place
[1:15:24] as these sons of God and I believe
[1:15:26] that's the same thing that happened on
[1:15:28] this
[1:15:29] question
[1:15:32] that there was another meeting in
[1:15:35] heaven and I don't understand it it's
[1:15:39] another dimension it's something that I
[1:15:40] don't think any of us understand but
[1:15:42] something happened to where this demon
[1:15:45] came up just like Satan himself came up
[1:15:47] before God with the sons of God here in
[1:15:50] the Book of Job and then a couple
[1:15:51] chapters later I believe the same thing
[1:15:53] happens so there are things brothers and
[1:15:56] sisters there are things that are going
[1:15:58] on right now that are influencing us
[1:16:02] here there's demons that are
[1:16:07] influencing there's
[1:16:09] angels that are influencing and there is
[1:16:12] a battle that's going on all the time
[1:16:15] there's one time that Daniel he said
[1:16:18] this Angel comes to Daniel I believe it
[1:16:20] was
[1:16:21] Gabriel he comes to Daniel and Daniel
[1:16:24] had prayed
[1:16:26] I believe it was 21 days before was that
[1:16:29] is it 21 days I think it was 21 days
[1:16:31] before Daniel had prayed 21 days before
[1:16:34] and this Angel Gabriel comes up and he
[1:16:36] says
[1:16:38] Daniel he said I would have been here
[1:16:43] earlier but here's the thing the Prince
[1:16:46] of Persia hindered me I had to go and
[1:16:49] battle with him but then the the Angel
[1:16:53] Michael came and helped me
[1:16:56] and here I am and I'm going to take care
[1:16:57] of everything tell me how in the world
[1:17:00] all of this is happening I don't
[1:17:02] understand it but things are going on
[1:17:05] brothers and sisters there are things
[1:17:06] going on behind the scenes there's
[1:17:08] things going on up in heaven right now
[1:17:11] Satan as I said is up there he's
[1:17:13] accusing us he hates us he wants us to
[1:17:15] end up in hell where he is going to end
[1:17:18] up in the Book of Revelation you can see
[1:17:20] that there is going to be a time when
[1:17:23] Satan's up there right now there is
[1:17:25] going to be a time when he comes down
[1:17:29] and he becomes incarnate in a man and
[1:17:32] when he comes down the bride goes up to
[1:17:36] meet the Lord in the air and then that's
[1:17:39] when this tribulation starts it's a
[1:17:41] wonderful wonderful lesson a wonderful
[1:17:44] study it's in the Seven Seals it's in
[1:17:46] through the Book of Revelations a
[1:17:48] beautiful beautiful
[1:17:49] subject we'll get
[1:17:51] there any questions about what we've
[1:17:54] heard so so
[1:17:56] far okay now I'm going to get everybody
[1:17:59] involved wonderful questions whoever
[1:18:01] wrote these questions I can tell this
[1:18:03] person studies and really has a good
[1:18:07] understanding of the word so I'm going
[1:18:08] to grab microphone number
[1:18:15] two
[1:18:17] now the Book of Genesis who wrote the
[1:18:20] book of
[1:18:21] Genesis Moses the first 11 chapters of
[1:18:25] Genesis are about creation and and the
[1:18:27] line of Adam we just talked about what
[1:18:29] happened in the Garden of Eden and then
[1:18:32] after uh chapter 11 we go to chapter 12
[1:18:36] and then this man Abraham comes on the
[1:18:38] scene and then basically the rest of the
[1:18:41] book is about Abraham and his family
[1:18:45] remember Abraham's
[1:18:47] son
[1:18:48] Isaac Abra and and then Isaac Jacob and
[1:18:54] then Jacob
[1:18:55] well Jacob had the 12 Patriarchs changed
[1:18:58] his name to Israel and that's why we
[1:18:59] call the country Israel very simple and
[1:19:03] then it goes through to Joseph
[1:19:06] Joseph is uh is just is blessed he he
[1:19:10] gets thr impr prison he he moves the
[1:19:13] family everybody to Egypt then there's
[1:19:15] this long period of time after Joseph
[1:19:18] dies hundreds of years that they're in
[1:19:21] Egypt and they're doing well and they're
[1:19:23] multiplying and then they're raises up a
[1:19:25] pharaoh that did not know Joseph and he
[1:19:28] gets threatened by all of these
[1:19:31] multiplying
[1:19:32] Hebrews very fruitful people as we go
[1:19:36] back to the metaphor in the book at the
[1:19:38] beginning of the book so what I'd like
[1:19:40] to do we'll start with Genesis and we'll
[1:19:43] go 15 minutes we have about 15 minutes
[1:19:44] to do this and then we'll go book by
[1:19:46] book we know that we see Adam and Eve
[1:19:51] all the way down through Joseph we we
[1:19:53] see methus and we see Enoch and we see
[1:19:56] all of these these different great
[1:19:58] people we see Sarah um the wife of
[1:20:01] Abraham we see Hagar coutura um we see
[1:20:06] Rachel and we see
[1:20:08] Rebecca I want to ask
[1:20:13] someone have you ever thought if you
[1:20:16] could just drop yourself in the Bible
[1:20:19] you know Google when you when you when
[1:20:21] you go there and you're on your computer
[1:20:24] screen
[1:20:25] and you grab the guy and you drop him
[1:20:26] into Google Maps and he like Wiggles his
[1:20:29] hand and he he lands and then he just
[1:20:31] you're on the street in street view you
[1:20:34] know that so let's have you ever done
[1:20:36] that and thought what would I do if I
[1:20:40] knew one of these people what would I
[1:20:43] ask them what would I say to these
[1:20:46] people in the Book of Genesis I need
[1:20:48] somebody to help
[1:20:50] me have you ever thought about somebody
[1:20:52] in Genesis and what would you like to
[1:20:55] ask that
[1:20:56] person brother
[1:20:59] Ronnie I'll just I'll say it go
[1:21:05] ahead L he got he got the he got the
[1:21:09] blessing what was that blessing was it
[1:21:12] an infilling the Holy Spirit did he meet
[1:21:13] an angel did he cry because we know when
[1:21:16] Cain he was wroth he had saw this and
[1:21:20] God did not accept his his um uh
[1:21:23] offering and he recognized a true
[1:21:26] worshipper I'm just what kind of
[1:21:28] blessing was
[1:21:31] it what a what a question so what
[1:21:34] happened was
[1:21:37] is both Cain and Abel made sacrifices do
[1:21:43] you remember what Abel's sacrifice
[1:21:46] was right do you remember what Cain's
[1:21:48] sacrifice
[1:21:50] was yeah it was plants and that
[1:21:56] so God accepted Abel's sacrifice do you
[1:22:01] know
[1:22:02] why because of the
[1:22:04] blood because this was it it
[1:22:09] was it was it
[1:22:12] was it it had to do with Christ later
[1:22:15] on and remember when um they were naked
[1:22:20] and God took skins and clothed them well
[1:22:24] he made the first sacrifice and then
[1:22:26] there is Abel knows this story and then
[1:22:29] Abel does the same thing that God did
[1:22:31] Cain he goes and he offers some
[1:22:35] beautiful thing plants or whatever and
[1:22:38] God accepted Abel's but did not accept
[1:22:41] Caines and then as brother Ronnie said
[1:22:44] he received these blessings what were
[1:22:48] the blessings that Abel received we
[1:22:50] don't
[1:22:52] know but it's seems like there is the
[1:22:57] father what greater blessing would you
[1:23:00] want to have than the Lord saying well
[1:23:03] done my good and faithful servant
[1:23:07] amen great question so we go through
[1:23:11] Genesis one more question about Genesis
[1:23:14] does someone want to talk say something
[1:23:16] about brother
[1:23:22] Josiah fine
[1:23:25] uh Genesis
[1:23:28] 17:17 God tells in the verse before in
[1:23:33] the verses before he says
[1:23:36] uh he renames Abram Abraham he renames
[1:23:40] Sarai Sarai Sarah and he says I will
[1:23:43] bless her and give thee a
[1:23:45] son and uh she'll be a mother of many
[1:23:49] nations and they'll be Kings and it says
[1:23:51] and Abraham fell upon his face and
[1:23:55] laughed when Sarah laughed she
[1:23:59] immediately got called out why didn't
[1:24:02] Abraham get called
[1:24:03] out anybody want to
[1:24:08] answer let me ask you I will answer your
[1:24:11] question with a
[1:24:12] question what was Abraham's son's
[1:24:16] name what does Isaac
[1:24:19] mean
[1:24:22] laughter my answer answer which may be
[1:24:26] right or may not be
[1:24:28] right is that that was the name of that
[1:24:33] young man and that's how Abraham fell
[1:24:36] down and
[1:24:39] laughed yes now we get to give it to the
[1:24:45] Theologian Abraham is
[1:24:47] laughing wow this is going to happen to
[1:24:49] me I can't believe it and Sarah is
[1:24:53] saying I don't think
[1:24:55] so there so it's it's it's translated
[1:24:58] the same but we lose that in the
[1:25:01] translation but I believe if you go back
[1:25:03] and look at at at the original language
[1:25:07] that you'll see that there's a
[1:25:08] difference in the nature of the laughter
[1:25:10] that's occurring it is important
[1:25:12] brothers and sisters it is important to
[1:25:14] understand these things and and these
[1:25:16] scholarly people like brother L they
[1:25:19] bring a lot to the table I think the
[1:25:22] answer of laughter it's the same it's
[1:25:24] correct that I that was Isaac's name but
[1:25:28] it was the good laughter not the bad
[1:25:29] laughter right so then we go through
[1:25:33] Genesis all the way to the end it ends
[1:25:36] with Joseph dying and going
[1:25:40] to Egypt and his family and then it goes
[1:25:45] along hundreds of years like 400
[1:25:49] years and There Rose up a pharaoh that
[1:25:52] did not respect
[1:25:54] the Hebrews the Bible says didn't know
[1:25:58] Joseph so this man starts killing the
[1:26:03] children starts
[1:26:05] persecuting these these Hebrews because
[1:26:07] there was just too many of them starts
[1:26:11] Exterminating they're enslaved they had
[1:26:13] a hard life this man named a amram
[1:26:17] prayed and prayed and the lord gave him
[1:26:21] and his wife jobed a son um they they
[1:26:24] already had a at least one son and and
[1:26:27] at least one daughter and gave them a
[1:26:30] son and this man was going to be the
[1:26:32] deliverer to take them
[1:26:34] out you know the story of Moses they put
[1:26:38] Moses in the N River and he floats down
[1:26:43] and a relation to um was it his sister
[1:26:47] or his his his uh
[1:26:50] daughter no his um Pharaoh's sister
[1:26:54] Pharaoh's daughter so Pharaoh's daughter
[1:26:57] finds the basket in the in the water she
[1:26:59] takes it out and then she takes this
[1:27:02] Hebrew baby to be her own and this man
[1:27:06] Moses
[1:27:08] raises up to be does anybody know about
[1:27:12] how old he was when when he came to full
[1:27:15] maturity and he ended up leaving
[1:27:18] Egypt 40 years old he goes then he
[1:27:22] leaves he he ends up killing an Egyptian
[1:27:24] his own people betray him he goes
[1:27:27] out and uh spends another 40 years in
[1:27:31] the wilderness we don't know much about
[1:27:33] what happened at that time he gets
[1:27:35] married comes back God God talks to him
[1:27:38] in in a burning bush sends him back to
[1:27:42] Egypt to pull the people out he brings
[1:27:46] plagues everything from frogs and
[1:27:50] turning the water to blood all the way
[1:27:53] till the last the death angel came and
[1:27:55] killed the firstborn son that did not
[1:27:57] have the blood over the lentil and on
[1:28:00] the doorpost the death angel brings the
[1:28:03] people
[1:28:05] out they go great Miracles the Red Sea
[1:28:09] Parts brings them through there brings
[1:28:11] them to the other side they start
[1:28:13] complaining they start having
[1:28:15] problems in the book of Exodus goes all
[1:28:19] the way to
[1:28:22] um is it Cades Baria where does the book
[1:28:25] of Exodus go to all the way to the
[1:28:28] end right right to it gets them to Mount
[1:28:32] Mount Si now with all the people that we
[1:28:35] have we have Moses we have amram we have
[1:28:38] um we have jocked we have Miriam we have
[1:28:42] Joshua we have all these characters in
[1:28:46] the book of Exodus what would you want
[1:28:51] to ask one of these characters in the
[1:28:53] book of
[1:28:55] exus what would you like to have a
[1:28:57] conversation
[1:29:04] Naomi why did Aaron agree to build the
[1:29:07] golden
[1:29:14] calf you have an answer brother
[1:29:16] Lyall why did Aaron agree to build this
[1:29:21] golden calf at Mount at Mount
[1:29:27] S
[1:29:31] no I I I think that
[1:29:34] Aaron again people didn't have the Holy
[1:29:36] Spirit at that time he'd seen the
[1:29:37] Miracles Moses has been gone for a long
[1:29:39] time they see the Thunder they see the
[1:29:41] lightning they're afraid they don't want
[1:29:43] to approach the mountain they think
[1:29:45] Moses is dead and what is their
[1:29:47] background their background is from
[1:29:49] Egypt and what was one of the chief
[1:29:51] goddesses of Egypt the goddess of all
[1:29:53] sorts of stuff was was hator who was
[1:29:56] symbolized as a coward so so a calf
[1:30:00] would be yeah well we're descendants
[1:30:01] from that we've come out of golden calf
[1:30:05] so it it's it's part of the culture that
[1:30:07] they came from and so they thought
[1:30:10] well my opinion just my opinion that
[1:30:14] they they went back to what they were
[1:30:16] familiar with when which I think also
[1:30:18] indicates that worshiping Idols was
[1:30:21] something that they had done all their
[1:30:22] life understand that there was no penit
[1:30:25] there was no law there was no rules
[1:30:27] there was no there was no anything just
[1:30:29] this we circumcised our kids and God
[1:30:31] said he's going to do something good for
[1:30:33] us someday end a story that's their
[1:30:35] entire religion they don't they don't
[1:30:37] have a religion so their only religious
[1:30:38] practice is what they learned in Egypt
[1:30:41] and you'll find that when they make the
[1:30:42] Tabernacle when when Solomon builds a
[1:30:44] temple it's patterned very similar to
[1:30:47] the temples that uh that were in Egypt
[1:30:49] that Heather and I saw when we were
[1:30:50] there three years
[1:30:52] ago and also
[1:30:54] um they thought Moses was
[1:30:56] gone they didn't think he was coming
[1:30:58] back and the Bible also says as the dog
[1:31:03] returns to its vomit and the hog to its
[1:31:06] wallow so many times brothers and
[1:31:08] sisters we will come out of
[1:31:11] something and then we'll go right back
[1:31:13] into the same thing have you heard I
[1:31:15] know you've in in school and taken
[1:31:17] psychology classes you see that they
[1:31:19] they often use a an abused
[1:31:22] woman and if if a if a her husband
[1:31:25] mistreats her and physically abuses her
[1:31:28] many times or her dad does many times
[1:31:31] that woman will find a husband that does
[1:31:34] the same thing that acts the same way
[1:31:37] it's because that is what she has grown
[1:31:40] up that's what she understands and it's
[1:31:43] the same thing with the church you see
[1:31:44] so many people they'll come out of a
[1:31:47] cult like church and man they go right
[1:31:51] back into another one and that's exactly
[1:31:56] at least my understanding it looks like
[1:31:58] and and also what brother Lyle said it
[1:32:00] looks like that's just what that was
[1:32:01] their comfort zone so they went right
[1:32:04] back to
[1:32:06] that and also keep in mind that in Egypt
[1:32:09] Moses did a miracle Janice and jambers
[1:32:11] did Miracles too it's not like they were
[1:32:13] coming from something that was just
[1:32:15] psychology it's something that they had
[1:32:18] seen Now The Book of Leviticus so we
[1:32:21] talk about going to this Mount Si the
[1:32:23] Book of Leviticus takes place right at
[1:32:27] the foot of this mountain and they're
[1:32:30] there for one year am I right brother
[1:32:32] Lyall this whole book is written in just
[1:32:35] one short time span so Leviticus it's
[1:32:40] kind of like the
[1:32:43] sun and what it is
[1:32:46] is Moses God is telling the people he's
[1:32:50] like he's telling them that you don't
[1:32:55] want to get too
[1:32:57] close to
[1:32:59] God because you'll die but then if you
[1:33:02] get too far away from God you'll you'll
[1:33:05] die
[1:33:06] too so it's like this it's like the sun
[1:33:09] you can enjoy the warmth of the Sun but
[1:33:13] don't sit there and stare at it or
[1:33:15] you're going to go
[1:33:16] blind and that's how the Book of
[1:33:18] Leviticus is The Book of Leviticus is
[1:33:21] how to stay in the presence of God don't
[1:33:26] get too
[1:33:27] close but then don't get too far away so
[1:33:31] we we see in Leviticus we see mainly we
[1:33:35] see the different types of sacrifices
[1:33:39] and this is really this is the law you
[1:33:41] you hear in the New Testament you hear
[1:33:43] in the Old Testament that they talk
[1:33:44] about the law The Book of Leviticus is
[1:33:47] quoted over and over and over again
[1:33:51] being the law that Moses
[1:33:54] brought um it's short does does anyone
[1:33:58] have anything about the The Book of
[1:34:00] Leviticus I doubt you do but it's it's
[1:34:02] about the sacrifices and and how and and
[1:34:06] really every single sacrifice that you
[1:34:07] read in the Book of Leviticus it
[1:34:09] pertains to
[1:34:11] Christ there's there's a couple
[1:34:14] sacrifices that there's really there's
[1:34:17] five types of of sacrifices there's two
[1:34:20] that are in Thanksgiving gratitude for
[1:34:23] God's blessings and then there's three
[1:34:25] for repentance and that would be when
[1:34:27] they when they kill the animal brother
[1:34:32] Jordan go ahead and yell it out and I'll
[1:34:34] I'll repeat it on the
[1:34:52] microphone
[1:35:02] when brother Jordan says they they chose
[1:35:04] law over
[1:35:05] Grace I believe that brother brandom was
[1:35:08] referring to
[1:35:12] when
[1:35:14] Moses wanted the people to go up and to
[1:35:17] speak to God and they got afraid and
[1:35:21] they said let not God Speak but let
[1:35:24] Moses speak because Moses with Moses
[1:35:28] there was there was a lot more um
[1:35:32] patience there was a lot the stakes were
[1:35:35] much lower with Moses than they were
[1:35:37] with Jehovah God on the mountain so they
[1:35:40] chose to have this
[1:35:44] law rather than Grace and how would
[1:35:47] Moses have done different i' like to ask
[1:35:51] him brother
[1:35:52] Moses
[1:35:55] what would you have done I know that you
[1:35:56] covered your face one time when your
[1:35:58] face Shone maybe it was to so the people
[1:36:01] didn't concentrate on you that's a very
[1:36:05] very good question brother Jordan I
[1:36:07] don't I don't
[1:36:09] know all of us would do things
[1:36:13] differently but I don't know I don't
[1:36:15] know what he would have done so then
[1:36:18] Leviticus goes through and then we pick
[1:36:20] up with
[1:36:22] numbers and
[1:36:24] numbers picks up right off at the end of
[1:36:27] Exodus so numbers goes along and and
[1:36:31] this is when Moses sends the 12
[1:36:35] Spies over the Jordan Rim River into the
[1:36:38] promised land there they followed a
[1:36:42] pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of
[1:36:46] Fire by
[1:36:48] night
[1:36:50] and some of the characters there
[1:36:55] um oh oh yeah that's when that Moses
[1:36:57] built the bronze serpent so they're out
[1:36:59] there in the wilderness and there's
[1:37:00] these these snakes these vipers these
[1:37:02] poisonous snakes and they keep getting
[1:37:04] bit and and dying and having problems
[1:37:07] and Moses sets up this brass or bronze
[1:37:11] serpent up in the wilderness and when
[1:37:13] you get bit you just look at that and
[1:37:16] you're you get
[1:37:18] healed um so that's the Book of Numbers
[1:37:20] does anyone have anything to say about
[1:37:22] the book of numbers
[1:37:25] we're running out of time this is
[1:37:28] a this is enjoyable book of
[1:37:32] Deuteronomy means the second
[1:37:35] law and it's the last book of Moses it
[1:37:38] begins with Moses and he's instructing
[1:37:40] this new
[1:37:42] generation the old generation they
[1:37:45] complain they they they angered God so
[1:37:48] God said none of you are going to go
[1:37:50] over to this promised land except for
[1:37:53] two do you know who the two
[1:37:55] were Joshua and Caleb even Moses himself
[1:37:59] didn't get to go over you know why he
[1:38:00] didn't get to go
[1:38:01] over he smot The Rock when God told him
[1:38:04] to speak to the
[1:38:06] Rock so then the Deuteronomy Deuteronomy
[1:38:09] goes until the the end and it's
[1:38:13] basically Moses
[1:38:15] giving encouragement and
[1:38:18] correction to the people and it
[1:38:22] ends basically with Moses saying he says
[1:38:24] listen I know what's going to happen and
[1:38:26] you're going to
[1:38:28] fail and then Moses goes up on the
[1:38:30] mountain and the Bible says that Moses
[1:38:34] the servant of the Lord died so then we
[1:38:37] have the first five books of the Bible
[1:38:38] the last chapter Deuteronomy was most
[1:38:42] likely written by Moses's right-hand man
[1:38:46] Joshua then we move into Joshua Joshua
[1:38:49] now has the promise to go over all of
[1:38:51] the other ones are have died out and now
[1:38:54] Joshua brings the people and they go
[1:38:57] over the Jordan River and they start
[1:38:59] Conquering the new land this is when
[1:39:02] they it's really a neat story he get
[1:39:05] he's he's about to he's about to go over
[1:39:07] he's about to go to battle and Joshua
[1:39:10] was a fighter man he was a warrior and
[1:39:14] he's he's an old man now but Joshua's
[1:39:16] going along and he sees this man with
[1:39:20] this sword
[1:39:22] drawn and the old man
[1:39:25] Joshua he pulls his sword and he looks
[1:39:29] at this man and he says you're you for
[1:39:31] us are you for our enemies and you know
[1:39:33] what this man
[1:39:35] said he said
[1:39:37] neither he said I come from the I am the
[1:39:40] captain of the host of the Lord he was
[1:39:43] an angel that came from God but I love
[1:39:45] the way he said that basically Joshua
[1:39:48] was like are you for us are you for our
[1:39:49] enemies he's like no I'm on God's side
[1:39:52] as long as you're on God's side you're
[1:39:54] going to do well so then they go over
[1:39:56] they conquer Jericho the walls fall
[1:39:59] down they uh they talk to Rahab the
[1:40:02] Harlot then they go into the this next
[1:40:05] city Ai and we see aen and he messes
[1:40:08] everything up and then Joshua piles up
[1:40:11] the stones in the Jordan River and then
[1:40:12] he piles them takes them and piles them
[1:40:14] up a Gil gal and says bring your
[1:40:16] children back to these stones and tell
[1:40:18] this story does anyone have any to say
[1:40:20] about the Book of Joshua Brother Joseph
[1:40:24] go ahead and I'll repeat
[1:40:30] it there's a lot of good guys and
[1:40:33] there's a lot more bad guys and and we
[1:40:38] find that today we feel like we're good
[1:40:40] guys here I for the most part right and
[1:40:44] uh there's a whole lot of bad
[1:40:46] guys did God create the bad guys did he
[1:40:50] create them to be bad guys is is that a
[1:40:53] fate that could bestow me could I be a
[1:40:56] bad
[1:41:03] guy uh yeah
[1:41:07] um
[1:41:09] there's we are all free moral agents as
[1:41:12] the New Testament teaches
[1:41:15] us but there are those that God has
[1:41:21] predestinated to eternal life
[1:41:24] now though that doesn't mean that you
[1:41:25] don't have a
[1:41:26] choice you can't saywell God just
[1:41:29] predestinated me to destruction Judas
[1:41:31] was born the son of Destruction he was
[1:41:34] born that way but Judas had to make a
[1:41:36] choice and all of these bad guys they
[1:41:39] make the wrong choice they choose the
[1:41:43] wrong side because generally their heart
[1:41:46] is not
[1:41:48] right so they are given a
[1:41:50] choice but God knows through pred
[1:41:53] destination God knows what choice that
[1:41:55] they're going to make very very good
[1:41:58] question after Joshua we go to the Book
[1:42:00] of Judges and this is all the stories
[1:42:04] the Book of Judges can be summed summed
[1:42:06] up with every man did that which was
[1:42:08] right in his own
[1:42:10] eyes and there was no good
[1:42:14] leadership in the Book of
[1:42:16] Judges
[1:42:18] then they would they would well there
[1:42:20] was some good leadership but they would
[1:42:22] they would sin God would send them a
[1:42:25] deliverer anneal or Gideon or Samson or
[1:42:30] Deborah or or baric or or these these
[1:42:33] different Great Men God would send the
[1:42:37] deliverer and get them straightened out
[1:42:41] that deliverer would eventually die and
[1:42:43] then they would again go back into sin
[1:42:46] it is a vicious cycle that has happened
[1:42:48] throughout history and it's even
[1:42:50] happening today and you see how
[1:42:52] important important leadership
[1:42:56] is leadership in the church leadership
[1:42:59] in the families leadership in the
[1:43:03] country it's all very very important and
[1:43:06] the Book of Judges shows how important
[1:43:09] and how bad leadership and we answered a
[1:43:12] question I believe on um cutting up the
[1:43:15] a woman and and sending her out to
[1:43:18] different places it's just an immoral
[1:43:22] Society
[1:43:25] Ruth does anyone have any statements on
[1:43:29] the Book of
[1:43:30] Judges couple more minutes Book of
[1:43:34] Ruth
[1:43:35] um beautiful love
[1:43:38] story between Ruth and Boaz really types
[1:43:42] the Lord Jesus and his bride here's this
[1:43:44] woman Ruth she's a gentile she uh her
[1:43:47] husband dies and and she goes with her
[1:43:51] mother-in-law and she is Redeemed by a
[1:43:54] kinan redeemer named
[1:43:56] boas any comments on the Book of
[1:44:02] Ruth of Ruth I don't know wasn't
[1:44:08] Ruth you you'll find in our society
[1:44:11] there's a title of the book and then
[1:44:12] there's the author and in our culture
[1:44:15] it's important to know who wrote it or
[1:44:17] who claims to have written it in ancient
[1:44:20] times it wasn't about who wrote it it's
[1:44:22] about what is it say so we don't know
[1:44:25] who wrote the Book of Ruth we do know
[1:44:27] that after the period of captivity and
[1:44:30] so forth when when various writings were
[1:44:33] collected together to create what we
[1:44:34] call the Bible canonize them as we say
[1:44:37] that this was recognized by the people
[1:44:39] of the day as being this is the word of
[1:44:42] God and so but but it's not because Fred
[1:44:45] wrote it or Arthur wrote it or John
[1:44:47] wrote it it's because of what it
[1:44:50] says amen 1 and 2 Samuel they were
[1:44:55] originally one
[1:44:56] book they're about uh this lady named
[1:44:59] Hannah who was Barren and God gave her a
[1:45:02] child this priest named Eli who raised
[1:45:05] this child this child's name was Samuel
[1:45:08] he grew up to be a great prophet of God
[1:45:13] he anoints this man king named Saul
[1:45:15] because the people want a king they
[1:45:17] don't want to be ruled by God they want
[1:45:19] to be like everybody else so God gives
[1:45:23] them what they want and God usually
[1:45:25] gives us what what we
[1:45:26] want God gives them what they want he
[1:45:29] gave him this big tall good-looking guy
[1:45:30] named Saul Saul was good for a couple
[1:45:32] years he ruled over Israel for 40 years
[1:45:35] for like 38 39 yard years he was not
[1:45:39] good then this young man David raises up
[1:45:43] kills Goliath Saul hates him they go
[1:45:47] round and round and Saul keeps trying to
[1:45:49] kill him and uh it ends up with Saul
[1:45:52] dying in
[1:45:53] battle then we continue on in 2 Samuel
[1:45:57] we can David is anointed king he has
[1:46:00] problems with Absalom his son he um
[1:46:04] fights many many battles and and wins
[1:46:07] many battles there's a prophet Samuel is
[1:46:10] there Samuel dies the next Prophet is
[1:46:12] Nathan Nathan instructs Samuel or
[1:46:15] instructs David on things David has an
[1:46:18] affair with basba they have a son son
[1:46:24] dies David before before the son dies
[1:46:27] David sends out the the husband of basba
[1:46:30] in the battle he instructs joab I
[1:46:36] mean Uriah this man even brought the
[1:46:38] orders himself gives them to joab joab
[1:46:43] reads the orders sends them out into the
[1:46:46] heat of the battle and then tells the
[1:46:47] soldiers to pull back and leave this man
[1:46:50] Uriah who was a Mighty Man to die in
[1:46:55] battle shows the the weaknesses of
[1:46:58] David first and 2
[1:47:01] Samuel 1 and 2 Kings 1 and 2 Chronicles
[1:47:06] they all tell many of the same
[1:47:08] stories then David has a son with this
[1:47:12] same woman Bas Sheba this son's named
[1:47:14] Samuel Samuel turns out to be a very
[1:47:17] very prosperous King he lives in
[1:47:19] probably the most prosperous time I'm
[1:47:22] sorry did I say Samuel I yeah Solomon
[1:47:26] Solomon lives in the most prosperous
[1:47:29] time and God instructs David wants to
[1:47:32] build a temple he wants to build a house
[1:47:36] for the Lord the Lord says no you can't
[1:47:38] build it build it David but your son can
[1:47:40] build it so then Solomon builds a temple
[1:47:43] um first and second Kings goes along we
[1:47:45] we see the Prophet Elijah we see Elisha
[1:47:48] we see these great prophets rise up so
[1:47:52] what what happens is is God sent the law
[1:47:55] but then he also sent prophets after the
[1:47:59] law to make sure the people are
[1:48:00] following the
[1:48:02] law and that is basically the book of 1
[1:48:05] and 2 Samuel they were one book first
[1:48:08] and second Kings or one book and then 1
[1:48:11] and 2 Chronicles 1 and 2 Chronicles
[1:48:13] cover the time from David on to the
[1:48:17] Captivity when Nebuchadnezzar came in
[1:48:20] then um first first and second Kings
[1:48:23] covers
[1:48:24] from um Solomon all the way to the
[1:48:29] Captivity there any
[1:48:32] questions brother
[1:48:36] Andrew you forgot let me get let me get
[1:48:38] Andrews first questions and answers on
[1:48:45] Genesis I've just wondered from the
[1:48:47] perspective of Saul I'm sorry Solomon we
[1:48:51] know what happened to Solomon
[1:48:53] but I'd like to ask him did he ever
[1:48:55] fulfill what he wanted to on his heart
[1:48:58] to serve the people of Israel with all
[1:49:01] everything God blessed him with did he
[1:49:03] ever fulfill that desire I'd like to
[1:49:05] know what he said about it so what
[1:49:07] brother Andrew is talking about is when
[1:49:10] Solomon was anointed
[1:49:11] king he went before the Lord and he he
[1:49:14] asked the Lord he
[1:49:18] said if you will just give me the Lord
[1:49:22] asked as Solomon what shall I give you
[1:49:24] and Solomon saids if you will give me
[1:49:26] wisdom to judge the people and to lead
[1:49:30] the people
[1:49:31] well and then God says not only will I
[1:49:33] give you wisdom because you requested
[1:49:35] this this Noble request not only will I
[1:49:38] give you that but I will also give you
[1:49:40] peace through your entire Reign and what
[1:49:44] brother Andrew is saying we know that
[1:49:46] the first time we see that wisdom you
[1:49:49] know when do you remember when it was
[1:49:51] with the baby and the two
[1:49:54] women and Solomon says so the the two
[1:49:57] women one of them rolled over on the on
[1:49:59] her baby and it died the other then she
[1:50:01] goes and she steals the one's baby
[1:50:03] they're sleeping in the same room she
[1:50:04] takes the one baby and she takes her
[1:50:06] dead baby and and puts it over next to
[1:50:08] the lady and then she walks wakes up
[1:50:10] she's like this isn't my baby that's my
[1:50:12] baby and then there's a big fight they
[1:50:13] come to the king and the King says cut
[1:50:15] the baby in half if they can't work it
[1:50:18] out did Olivia that's what he said
[1:50:21] Olivia gave me the was like
[1:50:23] what did they do it they didn't do it so
[1:50:26] what happened was the king said cut the
[1:50:28] baby in
[1:50:30] half and the real mother said no no no
[1:50:33] no no no she can have the baby because
[1:50:35] she really cared and the one that didn't
[1:50:38] that was not her baby she said yeah cut
[1:50:39] it in half so then we see the wisdom of
[1:50:43] Solomon but I would like to know that
[1:50:45] brother Andrew did that wisdom continue
[1:50:47] and did he
[1:50:49] accomplish what he wanted to do in
[1:50:51] serving Israel
[1:50:53] so there we
[1:50:55] have we have our first I don't know how
[1:50:58] many books brother ly musicians can
[1:51:03] come tell us
[1:51:07] something talking
[1:51:10] well regarding Solomon I've often
[1:51:13] thought that sometimes you have to be
[1:51:14] careful what you ask for I I think
[1:51:16] Soloman really cared about the people
[1:51:19] and he was seeking wisdom um and and and
[1:51:23] the Lord said I I'll give it to you so
[1:51:25] therefore I I believe that he had it but
[1:51:28] the Lord it I I always find it strange
[1:51:30] that the Lord said and I'm going to give
[1:51:31] you wealth and all that stuff but in
[1:51:33] Deuteronomy he says if you are a king
[1:51:35] forget about wealth and he specifically
[1:51:37] says no horses from Egypt and the first
[1:51:39] thing we read after that prayer is
[1:51:41] Solomon gets a bunch of horses from
[1:51:42] Egypt and and it's like the lord gave
[1:51:45] him wisdom for the people but not wisdom
[1:51:47] for his own life and and and so I think
[1:51:51] when we go before the Lord we need to be
[1:51:53] careful that that not only to be careful
[1:51:56] what we asked for but to be careful I
[1:51:59] don't want to I'm not sure how to say
[1:52:00] but to include oursel in some way if
[1:52:02] Solomon I think had included himself
[1:52:04] don't give me give me wisdom for the
[1:52:06] people and for my own life that I can be
[1:52:08] the right example I think the story
[1:52:10] might have been different that that's an
[1:52:12] opinion very good very good
[1:52:17] stat I um I don't mean this
[1:52:20] wrong but I do appreciate appreciate the
[1:52:23] mistakes that all of these people
[1:52:26] made it shows that they were human David
[1:52:29] was a prophet Not only was he a king and
[1:52:33] a man after God's Own Heart but he was a
[1:52:35] prophet and look at the mistakes that he
[1:52:37] made Solomon the most wise person
[1:52:42] ever and yet made many mistakes married
[1:52:45] the wrong girls did things wrong it just
[1:52:49] shows that we're human and we make
[1:52:53] mistakes but we can recover from those
[1:52:57] mistakes and we can move forward in our
[1:53:01] lives no more
[1:53:04] questions I've kept you brother
[1:53:21] Joe
[1:53:25] it's a that's a hard hard one to answer
[1:53:28] that's so brother Joe asked he said how
[1:53:31] can we Rec
[1:53:33] reconcile the Roman
[1:53:36] influence on what we call the Canon what
[1:53:41] we call the inspired word of God
[1:53:45] today and in short and I think that we
[1:53:48] should get into this question when we
[1:53:51] get into the New Testament but in short
[1:53:53] we have to
[1:53:54] trust that God is able to protect his
[1:53:58] word God's able to keep it and protect
[1:54:02] it but as I was preaching about this
[1:54:04] morning but God also requires us to pray
[1:54:07] about it there's many things in this
[1:54:09] Bible that are very hard to understand
[1:54:12] and if we pray about these things then
[1:54:14] he will give us that understanding and I
[1:54:18] think brother Joe I think that we should
[1:54:21] never leave out the influence of the
[1:54:25] holy spirit in reading our
[1:54:28] Bible because if we read it wrong we get
[1:54:32] these strange
[1:54:34] interpretations we get these Cults that
[1:54:36] are started we we we excommunicate
[1:54:40] people because they don't think like we
[1:54:43] [Music]
[1:54:44] do they don't follow our rules so when
[1:54:48] we take a couple scriptures and we
[1:54:49] misinterpret them and um
[1:54:53] cause all kinds of
[1:54:55] problems but we have to trust that the
[1:54:57] Lord God put this Bible together and
[1:55:01] used men of old men of renown Great Men
[1:55:04] of God to record it and to put it in
[1:55:08] place and
[1:55:09] then we also have to rely on the Holy
[1:55:12] Spirit as we read it that we don't
[1:55:15] interpret it wrong
[1:55:21] amen
[1:55:22] [Music]
[1:55:26] there is a
[1:55:29] soul in time of
[1:55:33] need that gives me
[1:55:37] hope that brings me
[1:55:40] peace in every
[1:55:44] trial through every
