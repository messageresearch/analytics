[47:29] good morning
[47:30] you're very surprised to see me here
[47:33] if you're not you probably should be
[47:36] because I'm actually going to attempt
[47:40] to share a song with you and you all
[47:43] know that when you find a piano the
[47:45] white keys and The Black Keys are very
[47:47] wide and the cracks are very narrow I
[47:50] tend to inhabit the cracks
[47:52] so but we just had Sunday school this
[47:55] morning we had 11 students and thank you
[47:57] so much for those of you that brought
[47:58] your children we pray that it will be a
[48:00] blessing
[48:04] so I thought the song that I'd like to
[48:05] show you this morning I'd start with a
[48:07] picture that looked like it might come
[48:08] from a Sunday school book
[48:10] but today as you know
[48:13] it's Palm Sunday we know that Jesus
[48:15] entered Jerusalem many times
[48:17] dozens perhaps hundreds but one time one
[48:22] time it was different than every other
[48:25] time that he entered it occurred on what
[48:29] we refer to as Palm Sunday
[48:32] and today
[48:34] Palm Sunday
[48:35] it's a day of the triumphal entry of
[48:38] Jesus into Jerusalem to start what we
[48:42] call the passion week
[48:44] and today today Palm Sunday
[48:49] 2023 falls on April 2nd
[48:54] and the 70th week of Daniel brother
[48:56] random tells us now now Jesus Messiah
[49:00] rode into the city of Jerusalem Triumph
[49:03] on the back of a white mule on Palm
[49:06] Sunday April the 2nd
[49:09] 83
[49:12] [Applause]
[49:16] 1993 years ago to the day
[49:20] April 2nd most years Palm Sunday is not
[49:24] April 2nd
[49:26] today it is
[49:27] and we know the crowds including the 12
[49:30] disciples were shouting Hosanna which
[49:33] means o save or give now salvation
[49:37] blessed is he that cometh in the name
[49:41] [Music]
[49:43] put a pair Mark 11 they that went before
[49:46] and they that followed cried saying
[49:49] Hosanna blessed is he that cometh In The
[49:53] Name Of The Lord
[49:55] and they were saying what David said in
[49:58] the Psalms and in Psalm 118 26 it starts
[50:01] out blessed
[50:04] be he that cometh
[50:06] in the name of the Lord they were
[50:08] fulfilling scripture that very day and
[50:13] and I've got it in yellow up there on
[50:15] the screen for those of you that read
[50:17] Hebrew it says Adonai
[50:20] [Music]
[50:22] I'd like us to welcome the Lord in song
[50:25] as so many of them did that momentous
[50:27] Day in Hebrew as you know only too well
[50:32] I'm not a singer so I'm going to need
[50:34] you to join me the tune is so
[50:37] are the words but but for the moment
[50:40] we're we're gonna we're gonna speak in
[50:43] tongues we're gonna sing I just want you
[50:46] to repeat this and and I want you to
[50:48] read it and I want you to repeat it I
[50:50] want to hear you if you can hear me
[50:52] you're not saying it loud enough
[50:55] Baruch
[50:57] bashem Adonai say it with me Adonai
[51:12] now here's what it means if we spoke in
[51:15] tongues you shouldn't do it publicly
[51:16] unless there's interpretation so we're
[51:18] going to interpret it for you
[51:19] [Music]
[51:22] means blessed
[51:24] ha means the
[51:28] ba is comes or coming the object the he
[51:32] is implied by his male gender Hebrews a
[51:35] very compact language so that's
[51:39] blessed is he that comes
[51:43] but is a preposition that means in or in
[51:47] the Shem
[51:49] means name
[51:52] Adonai the the The Vape you might not
[51:56] recognize the Hebrew but the lower
[51:58] left-hand corner there is a good a hey
[52:01] evolve and hay that's the
[52:03] tetragrammatron the Jewish people never
[52:06] pronounce or attempt to pronounce that
[52:09] name so instead they substitute Adonai
[52:13] which simply means Lord
[52:17] [Music]
[52:21] is blessed is he that comes in the name
[52:25] of the Lord
[52:26] now you've said it in Hebrew you've
[52:29] spoken it in tongues we're going to sing
[52:31] it together how often are we going to
[52:33] sing it it's a simple tune we'll sing it
[52:36] till you get it when I can't hear you
[52:38] anymore I'll sit down on our pastor can
[52:40] come
[52:41] so I'll sing it once so you get the tune
[52:43] and then we'll go from there
[52:46] [Music]
[52:50] um
[52:54] I don't know
[52:56] I don't know
[53:01] [Music]

[53:52] to praise the Lord
[53:54] introduced on the anniversary of
[53:55] atonement all of Jerusalem was praising
[53:58] and welcoming him with these very words
[54:01] in great expectation
[54:03] what's your expectation this morning
[54:06] let's do it again in the same language
[54:09] the same words let's stand to our feet
[54:12] let's sing this with enthusiasm it's the
[54:15] same Lord Jesus that rode into Jerusalem
[54:18] on the back of a donkey 1993 years ago
[54:21] is here with us this morning
[54:24] and we should be in the same expectation
[54:27] if not greater than they were then
[54:30] so we'll sing it as we welcome our
[54:33] pastor to the pulpit
[54:34] [Music]
[54:38] I don't know
[54:43] [Music]
[54:54] [Applause]
[54:55] [Music]
[55:06] [Applause]
[55:08] [Music]
[55:17] man that feels good
[55:23] that is the first time that I have ever
[55:26] spoken Hebrew
[55:29] thank you thank you
[55:32] thank you let's um while I have you here
[55:34] let's turn in our Bibles to the Book of
[55:37] Luke
[55:38] chapter 14.
[55:40] we've been
[55:43] studying this
[55:44] this author
[55:46] in another book that he wrote
[55:48] and now I want to go back to the
[55:51] original the first book that he wrote
[55:53] [Music]
[55:56] Luke Chapter 14. we'll start with verse
[55:59] 11.
[56:05] for whosoever exalt us himself shall be
[56:08] abased and he that humble himself shall
[56:11] be exalted
[56:13] then said he also to him that bait him
[56:15] when thou makeest a dinner or supper
[56:17] call not thy friends nor thy Brethren
[56:20] neither thy Kinsmen nor thy Rich
[56:23] neighbors lest they also bid thee again
[56:26] and recompense be made
[56:30] another version that's a little easier
[56:32] to understand it says when you give a
[56:34] dinner or a banquet don't invite your
[56:36] friends or your relatives or Rich
[56:37] neighbors unless they also invite you in
[56:40] return and you be repaid
[56:41] verse number 13 when thou makeest a
[56:44] feast call the poor and the maimed the
[56:47] lame the blind
[56:49] and thou shalt be blessed
[56:51] for they cannot recompense thee for Thou
[56:54] shalt be recompense that the
[56:56] resurrection of the just
[56:58] and when one of them that sat at meat
[57:00] with him heard these things he said unto
[57:03] him blessed is he that shall eat bread
[57:05] in the kingdom of God
[57:07] then said he unto him a certain man made
[57:10] a great supper and made many
[57:14] sent his servant at supper time to say
[57:17] to them that we're bidden come for all
[57:19] things are now ready
[57:21] and they
[57:23] all with one consent began to make an
[57:25] excuse the first said unto him I've
[57:28] bought a piece of ground and I must
[57:30] needs go and see it I pray that you have
[57:33] me excused and another said I bought
[57:36] five yoke of oxen
[57:38] and I go to prove them
[57:40] I pray to have me excused
[57:42] and another said I have married a wife
[57:44] and therefore cannot come
[57:46] so the servant came
[57:48] and showed his Lord these things then
[57:50] the master of the house being angry said
[57:52] unto and said to the servant go out
[57:54] quickly into the streets in the lanes of
[57:56] the city and bring in hither the poor
[57:58] and the maimed and the Halt and the
[58:00] blind
[58:01] and the servant said Lord it is done as
[58:04] thou has commanded and yet there is room
[58:07] and the Lord said unto the servant go
[58:09] out into the highways and the hedges and
[58:11] compel them to come in that my house may
[58:14] be filled for I say unto you that none
[58:17] of those men which were Biden shall
[58:19] taste of my supper
[58:20] and there went great multitudes with
[58:22] them and he turned and said unto them if
[58:25] any man come unto me and hate not his
[58:27] father and his mother and his wife and
[58:29] children and Brethren and sisters yea in
[58:32] his own life also he cannot be my
[58:34] disciple
[58:35] whosoever does not bear his cross and
[58:38] come after me cannot
[58:41] be my disciple may the Lord add the
[58:45] blessings to the reading of his word you
[58:46] can be seated thank you
[58:54] I forgot one thing and I forgot to give
[58:57] it to brother Aaron
[58:58] brother Glenn
[59:01] tablinger sent in this prayer request
[59:04] and I want to read it before the
[59:05] congregation
[59:10] this Monday at 8 45 I'm seeing a guest a
[59:13] gastrointolo in gastroenterology
[59:16] specialist
[59:17] they are going to do an exploratory
[59:19] ultrasound and biopsy procedure on the
[59:22] mass in my abdomen the procedure will
[59:25] take about 45 minutes
[59:27] they will be determining the next step
[59:29] they'll need to take
[59:31] I'm believing that the word is true that
[59:34] by his stripes I am healed and that by
[59:36] his stripes I was healed
[59:38] I'm believing for no foreign life in it
[59:41] and that it is benign and will be easily
[59:44] taken care of it'll take about three
[59:46] days for the biopsy results to be
[59:49] returned pray for the Lord's Mercy Grace
[59:51] and deliverance
[59:53] and the results being negative and all
[59:55] is well
[59:56] thank you and God bless you brother
[59:58] Glenn

[1:02:41] report of his recent trip to Africa
[1:02:45] looking forward to that
[1:02:47] greetings all the visitors I see a few
[1:02:50] faces that I don't readily recognize God
[1:02:53] bless you all welcome
[1:02:55] and we have some people that are far
[1:02:58] less of a visitor than I am the married
[1:03:01] brother Mark back there God bless you
[1:03:03] sister Bonnie and uh sister I didn't get
[1:03:06] your name
[1:03:08] next to sister Bonnie
[1:03:12] God bless you my sister welcome it's
[1:03:14] it's good to see you here it's good to
[1:03:16] see everyone here
[1:03:18] this morning
[1:03:20] The Book of Luke
[1:03:23] this testimony this parable
[1:03:27] that I just read about
[1:03:30] this wedding supper and
[1:03:33] and how this man this great man it was a
[1:03:37] story that Jesus told
[1:03:40] and he was typing it to something
[1:03:44] and I don't believe that there is a
[1:03:45] parable in the Bible that Jesus told
[1:03:48] that is more applicable to this day
[1:03:52] than this Parable that I read to start
[1:03:55] the service in the Book of Luke
[1:03:58] it is
[1:03:59] it's this man I would assume probably
[1:04:03] represents Christ
[1:04:06] calling people to his supper calling
[1:04:09] people to him
[1:04:11] and
[1:04:13] the the people that are represented are
[1:04:16] those that maybe are the church members
[1:04:18] maybe are the people that should know
[1:04:20] Jesus the most that should know this man
[1:04:23] of the house the most and they're the
[1:04:25] ones that get invited first
[1:04:28] and then they have something else to do
[1:04:32] and they don't see the importance
[1:04:34] of the supper of this this banquet that
[1:04:38] this great man is putting on
[1:04:42] so you'll you see as I read that that
[1:04:44] they come up with different excuses to
[1:04:48] why they can't go
[1:04:50] one of them
[1:04:52] you know he was busy he just he just
[1:04:54] bought some land and he wanted to go see
[1:04:56] it another one just got married and it's
[1:04:59] just excuse after excuse so it upset
[1:05:04] this man of the house
[1:05:07] and he had his servant there
[1:05:10] and he said if they're not going to come
[1:05:13] I have all these seats laid out he says
[1:05:16] I want every seat taken
[1:05:19] so he says go out
[1:05:21] go out to the poor people
[1:05:24] go out to the sick people
[1:05:27] and compel them to come in
[1:05:30] brother Branham said when he when he was
[1:05:32] reading that scripture one time he said
[1:05:33] there's three polls even associated with
[1:05:36] that that Parable the first it went out
[1:05:39] to the it went out to the ones that
[1:05:41] should know and then it went out to the
[1:05:42] sick
[1:05:43] in the healing and it said it said come
[1:05:45] into these poor people so this servant
[1:05:47] he goes out and he starts filling up
[1:05:50] this room
[1:05:52] filling up this church filling up this
[1:05:54] table and and he sets them down and
[1:05:57] they're still
[1:05:58] their seats open
[1:06:00] so he goes back to the master and he
[1:06:03] says the master says is my table full he
[1:06:05] says he says I did what you said and
[1:06:08] there's not enough people
[1:06:10] and he says go back out
[1:06:13] and find people and bring them here I
[1:06:17] want every seat full amen amen and
[1:06:20] another thing those ones that I invited
[1:06:22] they will never taste of my supper
[1:06:26] they won't ever they'll they'll never be
[1:06:29] invited back it's going to be these
[1:06:32] people taking these seats that were
[1:06:34] really meant for someone else
[1:06:36] but because they will humble themselves
[1:06:40] and because you know what they
[1:06:41] appreciated Brother Martin they
[1:06:43] appreciated a meal
[1:06:44] they appreciated someone inviting them
[1:06:48] and showing them a little bit of love
[1:06:52] and they they came in and they filled
[1:06:54] they filled this this place up
[1:06:59] and the bad thing was those
[1:07:03] people that had such a good life Maybe
[1:07:07] they were spoiled
[1:07:09] it didn't mean anything to him they
[1:07:12] didn't appreciate it
[1:07:14] they didn't appreciate
[1:07:16] and I'll say with with maybe with church
[1:07:18] they didn't appreciate a church that
[1:07:20] they could come to because they were so
[1:07:22] used to it
[1:07:23] they didn't appreciate a group of people
[1:07:26] maybe that loved them
[1:07:29] because they were used to it it wasn't
[1:07:31] something different to them
[1:07:34] but these people that came off the
[1:07:36] streets they were like wow
[1:07:39] this is this is special will come or you
[1:07:42] bet will come I want to sit at that
[1:07:44] table I want to eat that food I am
[1:07:47] honored to even be here
[1:07:51] but the others
[1:07:55] it's an excuse Lord you know I'm busy
[1:07:59] I'm gonna start praying
[1:08:01] I'm going to start coming to church I'm
[1:08:03] going to start reading my Bible I'm
[1:08:05] going to start I'm going to start a work
[1:08:06] at church I'm gonna I'm gonna start
[1:08:08] reaching out to my friends maybe that
[1:08:10] have left
[1:08:12] I'm going to start
[1:08:14] who's not sir these people that aren't
[1:08:16] serving the lord Lord I'm going to reach
[1:08:18] out to them I know them I'm going to
[1:08:20] start I'm going to I'm going to welcome
[1:08:21] them I'm going to maybe have them over
[1:08:23] to my home for dinner
[1:08:25] I'm gonna I'm going to I'm gonna be nice
[1:08:27] to them but Lord you know how busy I am
[1:08:30] today
[1:08:31] I just don't have time to do it
[1:08:33] I'll do it tomorrow
[1:08:35] you know what you won't do it tomorrow
[1:08:37] because tomorrow will come and you'll
[1:08:40] still be busy
[1:08:41] you'll still have something better to do
[1:08:44] than serve the Lord
[1:08:47] and then you'll be busy the next day
[1:08:49] and eventually you won't be capable of
[1:08:52] doing it anymore
[1:08:53] and then you look back
[1:08:56] and maybe say you know I really wish
[1:09:00] that I would have done more
[1:09:02] but you'll get to a point
[1:09:04] that it's too late now
[1:09:07] but as I say many times
[1:09:10] if you're breathing today in the
[1:09:12] audience it looks like everybody is then
[1:09:14] there is still time to start working
[1:09:19] one of the greatest experiences of my
[1:09:22] life
[1:09:23] people a lot of times they say well the
[1:09:25] Lord spoke to me about this and this and
[1:09:27] this and this and then it gets to be too
[1:09:30] common and they think maybe because they
[1:09:32] have a thought that the Lord spoke to
[1:09:34] them but I really believe on my 33rd
[1:09:37] birthday
[1:09:38] the Lord spoke to me
[1:09:40] I was
[1:09:42] on my knees
[1:09:44] and I was praying
[1:09:47] and I said Lord
[1:09:49] I am 33 years old
[1:09:53] I'm the same age as Jesus was
[1:09:56] as you were
[1:10:00] when you gave all of you gave your life
[1:10:02] for all of humanity
[1:10:06] and I've never done anything for you
[1:10:12] and yes as a young man I I was paying my
[1:10:17] tithes I was going to church I had a
[1:10:20] good life
[1:10:21] I had a couple of babies that were you
[1:10:25] know the the healthy and good you know
[1:10:27] sweet kids I had a good job I was making
[1:10:30] plenty of money we had a new house up in
[1:10:32] Oro Valley we were doing really good at
[1:10:35] a pretty wife
[1:10:36] I still got one same one
[1:10:42] um I was a good Christian
[1:10:46] I was doing what I should have been
[1:10:48] doing yet there were still there was
[1:10:51] something missing in my life
[1:10:54] there was something when I was praying
[1:10:55] when I was on my knees that day there
[1:10:57] was something that wasn't there that
[1:11:00] should have been there and I I
[1:11:02] understood that and I asked the Lord
[1:11:05] Lord I'm I'm this age and I've never
[1:11:07] done anything for you
[1:11:11] and the thought came to my mind
[1:11:16] of this young man that we call the Rich
[1:11:20] Young Ruler
[1:11:21] in the very same position I was
[1:11:26] at that time on my 33rd birthday
[1:11:29] he most likely if you read the
[1:11:31] scriptures looks like he had a wife
[1:11:33] he probably had young children
[1:11:37] he was doing well in life
[1:11:39] so much so that he was progressing in
[1:11:41] the work that he was doing that later on
[1:11:43] we see that he had to build barns for
[1:11:45] all of his stuff that he had
[1:11:49] and
[1:11:51] I was
[1:11:52] on my knees and I was I was praying and
[1:11:55] then felt like the Lord told me
[1:11:59] he said move to Jefferson though
[1:12:04] and it's a long story but the Lord just
[1:12:06] opened up all these doors and I was so
[1:12:08] excited and and Stephanie and I and the
[1:12:10] kids you know we moved
[1:12:13] we got there and the Lord continued to
[1:12:15] bless me
[1:12:17] and and I kept thinking about this man
[1:12:21] the Rich Young Ruler
[1:12:23] and what he did
[1:12:27] and it scared me
[1:12:29] because I was that same I was in his
[1:12:33] position
[1:12:35] and there's many here we may not be
[1:12:38] young
[1:12:39] but there's many here that are in the
[1:12:41] same position
[1:12:43] maybe we all are
[1:12:45] and what are we going to do with what
[1:12:48] God's given us
[1:12:51] let's turn to Mark I have time let's
[1:12:53] turn to Mark chapter 10.
[1:12:56] and I want to read this story it's it's
[1:12:58] short
[1:13:03] verse 17.
[1:13:08] Lord Jesus when he was gone forth into
[1:13:11] the way
[1:13:12] there came one running and kneeling
[1:13:15] kneeling to him and asked him good
[1:13:17] master
[1:13:18] what shall I do that I may inherit
[1:13:21] eternal life
[1:13:23] and Jesus answered him and said why call
[1:13:25] us thou me good
[1:13:26] there is none good but one that is God
[1:13:28] thou knowest the Commandments do not
[1:13:31] commit adultery do not kill do not steal
[1:13:33] do not bear false witness defied not
[1:13:35] defraud not honor thy father and thy
[1:13:38] mother
[1:13:39] and I could have answered the same
[1:13:42] as this man answered
[1:13:44] he said and he said unto him Master I've
[1:13:46] observed all these from my youth
[1:13:50] I'm doing it I'm living this Christian
[1:13:52] Life I'm already doing it
[1:13:55] Jesus
[1:13:57] beholding him loved him
[1:14:00] I've always known the Lord's loved me as
[1:14:03] you do you can feel that
[1:14:06] and said unto him one thing thou lackest
[1:14:09] go thy way sell whatsoever thou Hast
[1:14:12] and give to the poor
[1:14:15] and thou shalt have treasure in heaven
[1:14:16] and come and take up the cross
[1:14:20] and follow me
[1:14:22] Jesus is telling him he's you're a good
[1:14:24] man you pay your tithes you live true to
[1:14:26] your wife you don't lie you honor your
[1:14:29] parents and your parents are very proud
[1:14:31] of you and what you've accomplished in
[1:14:33] life
[1:14:34] but I require that you give everything
[1:14:38] especially
[1:14:40] the thing that means the most to you
[1:14:45] and he was sad
[1:14:47] at that saying and went away grieved for
[1:14:52] he had great possessions
[1:14:56] he knew good and well
[1:14:59] that he wasn't going to do that
[1:15:03] you know Jesus you're asking too much of
[1:15:06] me
[1:15:07] I'm a good Christian I go to church I
[1:15:11] never miss a service do you know how
[1:15:14] hard I have worked to build up this
[1:15:16] wealth that I have
[1:15:18] this wealth is what makes me important
[1:15:23] this wealth is what gives me respect in
[1:15:27] the church
[1:15:28] this wealth wealth is when I walk into
[1:15:31] the church is in the clothes that I wear
[1:15:34] I have nicer clothes so I I'm welcomed
[1:15:37] and I don't want to be like Peter and
[1:15:40] John
[1:15:42] these guys who look at the way they're
[1:15:44] dressed I don't want to be like that
[1:15:45] they don't have any money at all
[1:15:48] they're not respected
[1:15:50] but I have this respect
[1:15:53] I have this respect because I've what
[1:15:55] I've worked for and and I've put this
[1:15:58] together and now I can contribute to the
[1:16:01] church
[1:16:03] and I like that
[1:16:09] and you know he's he I'm sure he was
[1:16:11] thinking I'm able to buy people lunch
[1:16:13] I'm able to give to the poor I may I'm
[1:16:16] able to do all of this
[1:16:20] but
[1:16:22] we can see that that problem that he had
[1:16:26] that money and what that money got him
[1:16:30] was the very thing
[1:16:32] that was going to send him to hell
[1:16:36] and Jesus loved this young man
[1:16:39] just as he loved me and he he loves you
[1:16:42] he loved this man and Jesus understood
[1:16:46] that what's on this Earth is not that
[1:16:49] important but what's on the other side
[1:16:51] is what's important and if this thing it
[1:16:54] may buy you happiness it may give you
[1:16:56] respect but if this thing is going to
[1:16:58] send you to hell and keep you from the
[1:17:00] kingdom get rid of it
[1:17:03] it's not worth it
[1:17:07] you know if and I'm not telling
[1:17:09] everybody to go go sell everything and
[1:17:11] and give it to the poor
[1:17:13] but if there's something that is
[1:17:15] standing between you and God
[1:17:18] that that is the most important thing in
[1:17:20] your life
[1:17:21] then get rid of it
[1:17:24] it may be
[1:17:26] it may be your time it may be a
[1:17:28] television standing between you and God
[1:17:32] that you just that's the most important
[1:17:35] thing I spend my time doing that or it
[1:17:37] might be your phone
[1:17:39] it might be social media it might it
[1:17:41] could be anything
[1:17:43] but whatever that is that stands between
[1:17:46] you and God get rid of it you know what
[1:17:49] you know what it was for me this may
[1:17:52] sound really strange
[1:17:54] it was hunting and fishing
[1:17:57] when I was that age when I was 33 years
[1:18:00] old and I was there praying in my in in
[1:18:02] my room
[1:18:04] my thoughts were always up in the
[1:18:07] mountains
[1:18:09] oh and how I loved and I would take
[1:18:11] Stephanie and the kids and we put the
[1:18:12] kids in the backpacks and we we'd go and
[1:18:14] I used to always think about just how
[1:18:17] much I love this hunting and I and I
[1:18:19] would guide other people and and it was
[1:18:21] just so important to me but it was
[1:18:24] separating me from God
[1:18:27] such a small thing like that you think
[1:18:29] well that's a wholesome thing where it
[1:18:30] could sin come in
[1:18:32] it wasn't sinful
[1:18:34] it was it was standing between me and
[1:18:37] God I spent more time thinking about
[1:18:38] that
[1:18:40] so then when I moved to Jeffersonville
[1:18:42] you know what I didn't have anymore he
[1:18:45] said I didn't have hunting anymore man
[1:18:47] remember when we used to go
[1:18:49] you can't do that back there
[1:18:52] it's just yeah yeah you rent a oh
[1:18:55] you rent a farm and you go Massacre some
[1:18:58] poor deer that walks by with them
[1:19:01] 50 feet of you or whatever it's just the
[1:19:03] dumbest thing to hunt back there but
[1:19:07] I digress
[1:19:09] don't tell anybody who said that
[1:19:13] but
[1:19:15] it it was it was something that was
[1:19:18] important to me
[1:19:20] and I was able and I thank God I was
[1:19:22] able to to
[1:19:24] give that up
[1:19:25] and I gave it up for the Lord and now I
[1:19:27] come back and I no I still enjoy but
[1:19:29] it's not as it's not like it used to be
[1:19:33] and I
[1:19:35] I look at this young man
[1:19:38] and
[1:19:41] I can see how much
[1:19:44] how much that money meant to him
[1:19:47] it was just it was the most important
[1:19:50] thing because that's what gave him his
[1:19:52] importance
[1:19:54] he drove the nice car
[1:19:56] people he would show up to church and
[1:19:59] people would respect him
[1:20:02] and imagine
[1:20:04] if Jesus and he didn't know Jesus was
[1:20:07] the Messiah really here he seek all them
[1:20:10] good masteries he says basically you're
[1:20:12] a good preacher you're a good Minister
[1:20:14] you say things that are really
[1:20:15] encouraging to me and when he heard
[1:20:19] Jesus say this it was like oh
[1:20:21] no and the same thing could be with the
[1:20:24] whoever the minister is in the Pulpit or
[1:20:27] some one of your friends tell you
[1:20:29] he doesn't have to be some important
[1:20:32] person but when he says something
[1:20:36] and you take it like oh that's right
[1:20:40] and there's something inside of you
[1:20:44] that knows
[1:20:46] that this is
[1:20:50] something I have a problem with
[1:20:53] and you
[1:20:54] ignore it
[1:20:56] and continue on
[1:20:59] and that voice is speaking to you
[1:21:03] like it was to me
[1:21:05] you're spending too much time you're
[1:21:07] thinking about it too much
[1:21:09] there's not enough time
[1:21:11] in this Bible
[1:21:12] there's not enough time in prayer
[1:21:15] and
[1:21:18] the more it's like no no
[1:21:21] it may be your money
[1:21:23] you know it's you're thinking too much
[1:21:25] about it you're you're you're you're
[1:21:27] earning too much money it's it's taking
[1:21:28] it's taking the toll on you it's taking
[1:21:31] the toll on your walk with the Lord
[1:21:33] and you start ignoring that voice and
[1:21:35] ignoring that voice pretty soon that
[1:21:38] voice will become silent
[1:21:41] as it did with this man
[1:21:44] and that voice will stop speaking to you
[1:21:48] and then your time is over
[1:21:51] when there's no more of a conviction
[1:21:53] anymore
[1:21:55] and that's what happened with this young
[1:21:57] man
[1:21:59] and he kept on the way he was going and
[1:22:01] he didn't fail he didn't fall
[1:22:04] he continued to prosper
[1:22:08] verse number 23.
[1:22:10] and Jesus looked around about and saith
[1:22:12] unto the disciples how hardly shall they
[1:22:15] that have riches enter into the kingdom
[1:22:17] of God
[1:22:19] how many people has the Love of Money
[1:22:21] sent to hell
[1:22:25] and think about it does your testimony
[1:22:27] go out the window
[1:22:28] when you're dealing with money
[1:22:30] how many times have I heard that
[1:22:32] so-called Believers cheating each other
[1:22:34] and fighting and not paying their bills
[1:22:36] and not living up to an agreement
[1:22:39] these things can send us to hell just as
[1:22:43] drinking and smoking and drugs and
[1:22:46] prostitution and and fornication and
[1:22:49] adultery those things too these things
[1:22:51] can send us to hell too
[1:22:54] let's skip to verse 28.
[1:22:57] then Peter
[1:23:00] began to say
[1:23:03] Lo we have left all and have followed
[1:23:06] thee Peter's like obviously we don't
[1:23:08] have any money we left our jobs we gave
[1:23:11] away everything and Jesus answered and
[1:23:13] said verily I say unto you
[1:23:15] there is no man that has left house or
[1:23:17] Brethren or sisters or father and mother
[1:23:19] or wife or children or lands for my sake
[1:23:23] and the Gospels
[1:23:25] but he
[1:23:27] shall receive a hundred fold now in this
[1:23:30] time houses and Brethren and sisters and
[1:23:33] mothers and children and lands with
[1:23:36] persecution
[1:23:38] and in the world to come
[1:23:40] eternal life
[1:23:43] he said Peter Peter's like
[1:23:46] Lord
[1:23:48] we've left everything we've left our
[1:23:49] money
[1:23:51] we we we've left our jobs to follow you
[1:23:54] and Jesus very plainly said that is not
[1:23:57] enough
[1:23:59] you've got to leave everything
[1:24:02] Peter this Christianity isn't just I'm
[1:24:06] just going to make a little sacrifice
[1:24:07] here and there
[1:24:08] I'm going to come to church I'm going to
[1:24:10] be a faithful Church guard I'm going to
[1:24:12] be I'm going to pay my tithes I'm going
[1:24:13] to I'm going to I'm not going to cost
[1:24:15] not going to drink not gonna smoke not
[1:24:16] gonna do those things he requires
[1:24:18] everything
[1:24:21] every part of our Lives Jesus requires
[1:24:26] and you can see why he said straight As
[1:24:28] the gate and narrow is the way brother
[1:24:30] Dan and few there will be to find it
[1:24:32] very few
[1:24:35] but he gave us a blueprint here
[1:24:40] you've got to let me read that again
[1:24:43] verse number 29 and Jesus answered and
[1:24:45] said verily I say unto you there is no
[1:24:48] man that hath left house or Brethren or
[1:24:51] sisters or father or mother or wife or
[1:24:55] children or lands for my sake in the
[1:24:57] gospels but he shall receive a
[1:24:59] hundredfold now in this time houses and
[1:25:02] Brethren and sisters and mothers and
[1:25:04] children and lands with persecutions and
[1:25:07] in the world to come
[1:25:08] eternal life
[1:25:10] you've got a much greater reward if you
[1:25:14] make a little sacrifice for God he's
[1:25:17] going to give you a lot not Prosperity
[1:25:19] Gospel like oh if I give my church a
[1:25:22] thousand dollars I'm gonna get ten
[1:25:23] thousand dollars that's nonsense no what
[1:25:25] will happen is if you give the church a
[1:25:28] thousand dollars you're gonna be out a
[1:25:29] thousand dollars
[1:25:31] you're not gonna you're not gonna
[1:25:33] receive that because that's not what
[1:25:36] it's about it's not so you're gonna have
[1:25:38] more money what it's about is you giving
[1:25:41] it because you believe in the cause
[1:25:43] but many that are first shall be last
[1:25:46] and the last shall be first
[1:25:50] and I really believe
[1:25:52] that that Rich Young Ruler
[1:25:55] that was me
[1:25:57] that made the right choice
[1:25:59] I think about I think about him and
[1:26:02] Jesus himself loved him
[1:26:05] and this man
[1:26:07] he was he's probably just very very
[1:26:10] capable a very capable person somebody
[1:26:12] that all of us would want to have in
[1:26:14] church
[1:26:16] he comes up and he kneels down and he
[1:26:18] said he says what do I need to do to
[1:26:19] receive eternal life and there is Jesus
[1:26:22] Jesus says forsake everything and follow
[1:26:24] me
[1:26:25] think about that statement
[1:26:28] I wonder we'll never know
[1:26:31] he wasn't even important enough to put
[1:26:33] his name in there
[1:26:35] but I wonder if he would have been a
[1:26:37] disciple
[1:26:39] I wonder if he would have been one of
[1:26:41] the twelve
[1:26:42] and look at how much we know about all
[1:26:44] these disciples and all that they did
[1:26:46] and here is this man we don't even know
[1:26:48] his name and he just couldn't couldn't
[1:26:51] do it that one thing he couldn't do it
[1:26:54] and now
[1:26:56] he's alive today and he's regretting
[1:26:58] that decision
[1:27:00] and I think back about
[1:27:02] this table
[1:27:04] that this master has set
[1:27:08] and he says these people like the Rich
[1:27:10] Young Ruler
[1:27:12] were invited
[1:27:16] and they said well I'm busy
[1:27:19] I got to go take care of this I gotta go
[1:27:20] take care of that and here's the Master
[1:27:22] of the House saying
[1:27:24] he'll never
[1:27:26] he will never eat at my table
[1:27:28] I don't care how important he is I don't
[1:27:31] care how good he is I don't care I want
[1:27:33] my table filled now
[1:27:35] I want these church pews filled now
[1:27:38] and I want the people to come in that
[1:27:40] appreciate it that want it
[1:27:44] I was
[1:27:47] you know we were teaching on the book of
[1:27:49] Acts chapter one the other
[1:27:51] a couple weeks ago
[1:27:53] and Peter knew
[1:27:57] that it was prophesied that they that
[1:27:59] that this one that was taken out this
[1:28:01] Judas that it had to be replaced
[1:28:05] and he replaced him with Matthias
[1:28:08] but there was there was a void there and
[1:28:12] it had to be filled
[1:28:14] and that is the same as God's table if
[1:28:17] there is a void taken out it has to be
[1:28:19] it has to be filled
[1:28:23] because the Lord was really
[1:28:25] dealing with me this week
[1:28:28] especially on Tuesday
[1:28:30] I woke up in the morning
[1:28:33] I uh took the day off of work
[1:28:37] I woke up in the morning and I just I
[1:28:39] just felt the presence of the Lord
[1:28:43] and it's this it's this heavy feeling I
[1:28:46] feel and I just felt like Lord there's
[1:28:50] something
[1:28:51] you're doing something
[1:28:53] and
[1:28:55] prayed and and I feel like when that
[1:28:58] when I feel but I'm gonna when I feel
[1:29:00] that presence I feel like ask pray
[1:29:04] because he's listening to me
[1:29:07] so I was praying
[1:29:10] and then I said Lord I just feel like
[1:29:12] you're going to do something today and
[1:29:15] I uh
[1:29:18] went picked up Heath and uh and your boy
[1:29:22] and they came and helped in the in the
[1:29:25] room up here and
[1:29:27] um
[1:29:28] the moral sister Roberta came and helped
[1:29:31] also and
[1:29:32] I just had this heavy feeling all day
[1:29:35] it's like Lord I feel like you're gonna
[1:29:37] like you're gonna do something and and
[1:29:39] we worked and we were painting and we
[1:29:41] were doing our thing and and putting
[1:29:43] together furniture and and I took Heath
[1:29:45] back to his house and I picked up uh
[1:29:48] Daniel came and and started we kept
[1:29:50] working up there in the room up there
[1:29:52] trying to get things ready continued to
[1:29:55] work and as I said on Wednesday the the
[1:29:57] door was open and we heard these voices
[1:30:00] from outside the church
[1:30:05] a very strange thing there was only a
[1:30:07] couple cars in the parking lot
[1:30:10] and it's these these girls and they say
[1:30:12] hello anybody there
[1:30:15] who would drive up
[1:30:17] to the Tabernacle with only a couple
[1:30:19] cars and then walk up about here and
[1:30:22] start hollering is anybody home
[1:30:25] so
[1:30:27] uh Daniel walked out and greeted them
[1:30:29] and and and showed them around
[1:30:32] and I was thinking of my mind Lord is is
[1:30:34] this it
[1:30:36] is is this what is this what you've been
[1:30:39] dealing with me about and and Daniel
[1:30:41] showed him around and they ended up
[1:30:43] saying they said we used to we used to
[1:30:45] come to church here when we were little
[1:30:48] we went to the school
[1:30:50] up here
[1:30:51] and they were so excited and they were
[1:30:53] talking about everything that was going
[1:30:54] on and and they were just so happy and
[1:30:57] fellowshipping and uh the one girl said
[1:31:01] she says you know what she says I was
[1:31:03] baptized right there
[1:31:07] and I I was just like oh Lord maybe this
[1:31:10] is it maybe it's these two young ladies
[1:31:12] and they end up coming to church on
[1:31:15] Wednesday night with their families
[1:31:16] Salazar family
[1:31:18] is the name and many of you know Sister
[1:31:20] Salazar
[1:31:21] they ended up coming to church on
[1:31:23] Wednesday night
[1:31:24] but
[1:31:26] we were they left and and uh
[1:31:30] we finished up upstairs and then I and
[1:31:32] it was dark it was it was pretty well
[1:31:34] into the evening and I walked into the
[1:31:37] church
[1:31:38] to shut off all the lights
[1:31:41] still just heavy on my heart Lord
[1:31:44] what is going on is it those two Souls
[1:31:48] so I walked in and I shut off all the
[1:31:51] lights and then brother Ernie I walked
[1:31:54] in to the sanctuary
[1:31:55] it was dark
[1:31:57] and the lights
[1:31:59] were on the platform
[1:32:02] and I thought oh God
[1:32:05] I walked in and I could feel
[1:32:07] the presence of the Lord
[1:32:09] and and I was standing back there and
[1:32:13] I didn't know what to say didn't know
[1:32:14] what to do and seeing this light and I
[1:32:17] thought I have never seen a more
[1:32:19] beautiful place in my whole life
[1:32:22] than where I'm standing right now
[1:32:25] seeing this cross lit up in this light
[1:32:29] and the Darkness out there
[1:32:32] I was just overwhelmed and I I leaned on
[1:32:36] the Pew and I said Lord
[1:32:38] do you want
[1:32:42] This Place full
[1:32:44] of people
[1:32:46] and I was leaning there and
[1:32:49] I had a
[1:32:51] um a thought a vivid thought and and I
[1:32:54] was looking around the audience and I
[1:32:56] was seeing just every Pew just a thought
[1:33:00] every Pew full and
[1:33:04] and I bowed my head and I said Lord I
[1:33:06] don't know what to pray for I don't know
[1:33:08] what you want
[1:33:10] do you want that
[1:33:13] I prayed as the Lord If It Be Your Will
[1:33:16] and then fill this place up
[1:33:19] but if it not be not your will then Lord
[1:33:21] bring somebody
[1:33:23] whoever it is that wandering soul I went
[1:33:27] and got Daniel and I brought Daniel
[1:33:29] Daniel in and we stood back there and
[1:33:31] Daniel was just like wow
[1:33:33] and we just stood back there for a
[1:33:35] little bit just taking it in
[1:33:39] so I I get back in the car get back in
[1:33:42] in my vehicle and I'm driving home
[1:33:45] I said Lord is
[1:33:47] was that it
[1:33:49] driving home
[1:33:51] it's I don't know 8 30 or whatever 8 or
[1:33:54] 8 30 whatever time it was and
[1:33:57] I was just just feeling
[1:34:00] the presence of the Lord
[1:34:02] and I stopped to pick up a Subway
[1:34:04] sandwich at Subway for Stephanie and me
[1:34:08] and walked in
[1:34:10] to the place and it was this um
[1:34:14] black man there
[1:34:16] middle aged
[1:34:18] and uh started talking to him
[1:34:21] ordered my sandwich I was the only one
[1:34:24] in the store
[1:34:25] started talking with him
[1:34:27] and he made a statement
[1:34:31] he said
[1:34:34] something on the order of
[1:34:37] well I said something I can't remember
[1:34:38] what I said he said something on the
[1:34:39] order of well it's either Heaven or Hell
[1:34:43] and
[1:34:45] I looked at him
[1:34:47] and
[1:34:49] I said do you believe that there's a
[1:34:51] real hell
[1:34:54] and he says yeah he says he says I
[1:34:56] believe that you could be in Hell on
[1:34:57] Earth
[1:34:59] and I could tell right there he's
[1:35:01] struggling
[1:35:03] he needed something
[1:35:05] because I could tell he was thinking
[1:35:07] that he was on this hell on Earth
[1:35:10] and I said
[1:35:11] I said I'm a minister
[1:35:14] and uh
[1:35:16] he didn't really answer
[1:35:19] and I said um

[1:35:35] why I'm working here
[1:35:37] he says you can you can imagine the
[1:35:40] mistakes that I've made
[1:35:42] I said well
[1:35:44] I said why don't you come to church

[1:36:24] said do you believe in the Holy Ghost
[1:36:26] I said yes ma'am
[1:36:29] I said I said I believe that that should
[1:36:30] be the goal of all of us
[1:36:33] to receive the Holy Spirit
[1:36:36] and she said
[1:36:37] she talked to me about a few other
[1:36:39] things
[1:36:40] and I said why don't you why don't you
[1:36:42] come to church
[1:36:44] and
[1:36:46] she says okay
[1:36:48] she says I have a nine-year-old son
[1:36:49] brother Lyle
[1:36:52] and I said we're just this weekend's

[1:36:58] she said but she said but I'm going to
[1:37:00] try she says I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm
[1:37:02] gonna switch with somebody and I'm gonna
[1:37:04] come to church
[1:37:06] and and then the man his name's will and
[1:37:08] he said he says yeah I'll come too
[1:37:11] and I said I said my praise God I said I
[1:37:14] want to see you
[1:37:15] so I went and I got in my my vehicle and
[1:37:20] I sat there
[1:37:22] I said Lord what am I doing
[1:37:25] I said
[1:37:30] these people
[1:37:33] and my mind went worldly
[1:37:36] my mind went to the world and I said I
[1:37:38] said these people they don't have much
[1:37:41] that they can bring to our church they
[1:37:43] don't have much to offer
[1:37:45] and I said you know and I was I was just
[1:37:47] thinking and there was been somebody
[1:37:49] this has been a family in my heart that
[1:37:51] I've been wanting to come to church and
[1:37:53] and they just haven't given me the time
[1:37:55] of day some a family that could really
[1:37:57] bring a lot
[1:37:59] and and I was I was thinking about that
[1:38:02] person and I was oh they have you know
[1:38:05] they're well off and they're just
[1:38:07] they're just good people
[1:38:09] and I was thinking about those people
[1:38:11] and then I was thinking about this woman
[1:38:14] and this man inside of Subway and I was
[1:38:17] like Lord
[1:38:19] what am I doing am I doing right
[1:38:22] for however long that you want me to be
[1:38:25] in this position at church am I even
[1:38:27] going in the right direction
[1:38:29] I was thinking I should be witnessing on
[1:38:31] the golf course or something
[1:38:33] no I was like Lord what do you want me
[1:38:36] to do and then I felt that same presence
[1:38:41] and the question came in my mind
[1:38:43] who do you want
[1:38:46] to be there at your church
[1:38:49] and I didn't hesitate I said Lord I want
[1:38:52] them that are in Subway those are the
[1:38:55] people that I want here
[1:38:57] those are the people that you cried out
[1:39:00] to come and fill my table up
[1:39:04] and he did
[1:39:07] and they're going to be they're going to
[1:39:08] come to church I assume they're going to
[1:39:10] come where else are they going to go
[1:39:12] who else cares about them
[1:39:16] think about it
[1:39:19] who else cares
[1:39:22] but God cares who is more important is
[1:39:26] it the Rich Young Ruler I'm not I'm not
[1:39:28] comparing the the other guy to the Rich
[1:39:30] Young Ruler but
[1:39:32] this is different but isn't the Rich
[1:39:34] Young Ruler
[1:39:36] or is it Peter
[1:39:39] and John that don't have two nickels to
[1:39:41] rub together
[1:39:42] who's more important
[1:39:45] it's the ones that will humble
[1:39:47] themselves that will come
[1:39:49] it's the ones that feel honored it's the
[1:39:52] ones that come to that table say I'm not
[1:39:54] worthy to come to this table
[1:39:56] it's the ones that that are out there
[1:39:59] maybe the drug addicts
[1:40:01] maybe the ones that were in prison
[1:40:04] whoever it is it's them that we compel
[1:40:07] to come in it's scripture bring them in
[1:40:12] I think about
[1:40:13] I think about my grandpa brother Evans
[1:40:18] being as close brother branham's two
[1:40:20] best friends woods and Evans to nobodies
[1:40:25] in this world
[1:40:27] nobodies
[1:40:29] my grandpa he ran a filling station down
[1:40:32] in Georgia he would save up all of his
[1:40:34] money and spend it to go and hear a
[1:40:38] message to drive wherever it was because
[1:40:41] he saw something real he saw the Holy
[1:40:44] Spirit working so he would give
[1:40:46] everything just to go
[1:40:49] my my grandpa and my um and brother
[1:40:53] woods and brother Branham were out to
[1:40:55] eat one time
[1:40:57] brother Woods looked over he looked over
[1:40:59] the table and the waitress comes and he
[1:41:01] says I'll have what their what that
[1:41:03] person's having over there
[1:41:06] so so they ordered off the menu
[1:41:10] then
[1:41:11] brother Woods gets up and and go goes
[1:41:14] somewhere brother Brandon tells my
[1:41:16] grandpa
[1:41:18] he says you see how he ordered
[1:41:20] he said he can't read
[1:41:23] this man brother Brown's best friend
[1:41:27] he can't read
[1:41:30] think about that same Spirit of Christ
[1:41:34] I think about sister Alberta and your
[1:41:37] family
[1:41:39] sister batazzi sold her wedding ring
[1:41:44] so that they could come down and come to
[1:41:46] a meeting where the Holy Spirit was
[1:41:48] moving
[1:41:50] when I when she told me that she said I
[1:41:52] don't think anything of it
[1:41:54] what was more important to her
[1:41:57] compared David and Carol batazi to this
[1:42:01] Rich Young Ruler
[1:42:02] look at the difference because they
[1:42:04] appreciated it
[1:42:07] and that's where brother Brandon came to
[1:42:08] this little place Jeffersonville had
[1:42:10] this little church
[1:42:11] it wasn't much
[1:42:13] but it was what God chose and the people
[1:42:16] came
[1:42:19] brother
[1:42:20] I think about Elijah
[1:42:23] he was out and he called the famine and
[1:42:26] who did God send Elijah the prophet to
[1:42:29] he sent her to a poor widow woman with a
[1:42:33] son that we're about to die
[1:42:36] that were as poor as you get
[1:42:41] brother Ed they
[1:42:43] that's who God chose
[1:42:46] was this poor widow woman
[1:42:49] and that's who he we should never
[1:42:52] neglect these people
[1:42:58] Luke chapter 7.
[1:43:04] I love this story
[1:43:06] of Mary of Bethany
[1:43:10] verse 36.
[1:43:17] it means so much to me
[1:43:19] it means so much to me to see people to
[1:43:22] see people that want the Lord
[1:43:24] not not are thinking they're so good
[1:43:27] but people that want to be here that
[1:43:30] people that want to hear the gospel
[1:43:31] people that want to be healed people
[1:43:34] that want to give their hearts to the
[1:43:35] Lord people that have a desire that's
[1:43:38] who fills up his table
[1:43:41] and it's people like this sister I'm
[1:43:43] going to read about right now
[1:43:45] those are God's people
[1:43:48] and one of the Pharisees
[1:43:51] desired him that he would eat with them
[1:43:53] speaking of the Lord Jesus
[1:43:55] and he went into the Pharisees house and
[1:43:57] sat down to meet and behold a woman in
[1:44:00] the city which was a sinner
[1:44:03] when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in
[1:44:06] the Pharisees house brought an alabaster
[1:44:08] box of ointment
[1:44:09] and stood At His Feet behind him weeping
[1:44:12] and began to wash his feet with tears
[1:44:14] and did wipe them with the hairs of her
[1:44:16] head and kissed his feet and anointed
[1:44:18] them with ointment now when the
[1:44:20] Pharisees which had bitten him saw it
[1:44:24] he spake within himself
[1:44:27] this man Simon the Pharisee
[1:44:29] if this man were a prophet would he have
[1:44:32] known
[1:44:34] who and what manner of woman this is
[1:44:38] that touches him
[1:44:40] for she is a sinner
[1:44:44] a low-life poorly dressed woman that had
[1:44:49] lived in sin that everybody knew her
[1:44:53] and what a bad reputation that she had
[1:44:58] Jesus wasn't too good for her
[1:45:03] and Jesus answering said unto him Simon
[1:45:05] I have somewhat to say unto thee
[1:45:09] and he saith Master say on there was a
[1:45:12] certain creditor which had two debtors
[1:45:15] the one owed 500 Pence the other 50.
[1:45:18] and when they had nothing to pay he
[1:45:20] frankly forgave them both
[1:45:23] tell me therefore which of them will
[1:45:26] love him the most
[1:45:28] Simon answered and said I suppose that
[1:45:31] he to whom he forgave most
[1:45:35] and he said unto him thou Hast rightly
[1:45:37] judged
[1:45:38] and he turned to the woman and said unto
[1:45:40] Simon seethau this woman I entered into
[1:45:42] thine house and gave us and now gave us
[1:45:45] me no water from my feet but she hath
[1:45:47] washed my feet with tears and wiped them
[1:45:49] with the hairs of her head thou gavest
[1:45:51] me no kiss but this woman since the time
[1:45:53] I came in has not ceased to kiss my feet
[1:45:56] my head with oil thou does not anoint
[1:45:59] but this woman hath anointed my feet
[1:46:01] with ointment wherefore I say unto thee
[1:46:03] her sins which are many are forgiven for
[1:46:06] she loved much
[1:46:08] but to whom little Is Forgiven the same
[1:46:10] loveth little
[1:46:13] and he said unto her thy sins are
[1:46:16] forgiven
[1:46:17] she believed imagine how that felt
[1:46:23] and they that sat at meat with him began
[1:46:25] to say within themselves
[1:46:28] who is this that forgiveth sins also and
[1:46:31] he said to the woman
[1:46:33] thy faith has saved thee
[1:46:35] go in peace
[1:46:40] Simon the Pharisee looked at the way
[1:46:42] that she was dressed
[1:46:44] he looked at the way that she looked
[1:46:49] and he didn't he could not see and he
[1:46:52] didn't care that there was a desire to
[1:46:55] serve God
[1:46:58] she was wrong she sinned
[1:47:02] she didn't maybe she didn't know better
[1:47:06] and here she comes in
[1:47:09] and she sees
[1:47:11] maybe this congregation
[1:47:14] oh God
[1:47:16] oh Lord
[1:47:18] thank you
[1:47:20] thank you for giving me the honor of
[1:47:23] coming in here
[1:47:25] and we and we might say well you know
[1:47:28] the way that the way that she looks or
[1:47:30] there may be somebody come in the man
[1:47:32] and maybe the man doesn't look maybe
[1:47:34] he's not dressed right maybe he doesn't
[1:47:36] look like he should
[1:47:40] never
[1:47:42] Jesus did not cast them out
[1:47:45] at least they came which is more that we
[1:47:49] could say about this Rich Young Ruler
[1:47:52] he was he was he wanted the world he
[1:47:55] wanted his own
[1:47:57] if the sisters if the musicians could
[1:47:59] come
[1:48:01] I remember I knew a brother
[1:48:03] in Jeffersonville
[1:48:06] and
[1:48:07] he heard
[1:48:09] the gospel of the hour and he just loved
[1:48:13] it rough background
[1:48:16] he'd go on his way home from work
[1:48:19] pick up a six-pack
[1:48:21] go home set it down
[1:48:24] crack One open and listen to a tape
[1:48:28] he didn't know any better
[1:48:32] and as he started listening the Lord
[1:48:34] started working on him
[1:48:36] and he started he started getting better
[1:48:38] and better and he's like oh I should not
[1:48:40] have done that
[1:48:43] but he was innocent in doing it
[1:48:46] now the brother is a Believer one of the
[1:48:50] strongest Believers you'll ever know
[1:48:52] but that's how that's how he came and
[1:48:54] that's how he started
[1:48:58] that Rich Young Ruler he didn't have any
[1:48:59] baggage
[1:49:00] [Music]
[1:49:01] he didn't have a past behind him
[1:49:05] he came in everybody's accepted all the
[1:49:08] you know the the the the good young man
[1:49:10] like I wasn't 33 years old everything
[1:49:12] going just right
[1:49:14] [Music]
[1:49:16] but
[1:49:17] he cared more about the things in the
[1:49:20] world than the things of God and look at
[1:49:22] these sinners
[1:49:24] these people that we say well
[1:49:28] a pastor might say well what do they
[1:49:30] bring to the church
[1:49:32] let me tell you something they bring
[1:49:33] Jesus Christ to this church I'd rather
[1:49:36] have Jesus than anything else I'd rather
[1:49:39] have Mary Magdalene than Jezebel any day
[1:49:42] of the week
[1:49:43] I'd rather have I'd rather have Peter
[1:49:46] and James and John these people that
[1:49:47] were that were rough
[1:49:49] than this Rich Young Ruler anytime
[1:49:53] and
[1:49:54] [Music]
[1:49:57] we don't look our brother last week
[1:50:01] how did he put it
[1:50:04] he said
[1:50:05] defiled
[1:50:07] in the body
[1:50:09] pure in spirit
[1:50:11] boy did I appreciate
[1:50:13] brother Jonathan that was good wasn't it
[1:50:16] appreciated what he said
[1:50:18] [Music]
[1:50:22] when I was at Subway I don't necessarily
[1:50:25] [Music]
[1:50:27] know that it was those two people
[1:50:30] but I know God was
[1:50:32] teaching me
[1:50:34] he was telling me
[1:50:36] it was showing me these are my people
[1:50:42] these are the people that I have already
[1:50:45] asked these other ones to come
[1:50:47] they refused me
[1:50:51] but my table will be full
[1:50:56] we're looking at we're looking at Palm
[1:50:58] Sunday today
[1:51:01] it was probably brother Lyle it was
[1:51:03] probably the highlight of Jesus's
[1:51:05] Ministry
[1:51:06] there he is coming into this coming into
[1:51:09] the city of Jerusalem the holiest place
[1:51:11] on Earth
[1:51:13] riding on a donkey people throwing their
[1:51:15] their clothes down in front of him so so
[1:51:18] the donkey wouldn't walk on the dirt and
[1:51:20] throwing Palm leaves down and waving
[1:51:22] singing Hosanna Here Comes This
[1:51:24] triumphant King
[1:51:26] [Music]
[1:51:27] into the city
[1:51:29] this great king this great young Rabbi
[1:51:32] at 33 years old
[1:51:34] [Music]
[1:51:35] and in less than a week he was dying on
[1:51:38] the cross a convicted felon a convicted
[1:51:41] sinner
[1:51:44] with two men on either side two of the
[1:51:47] worst two of the biggest sinners in the
[1:51:49] world
[1:51:51] and there is Jesus
[1:51:52] [Music]
[1:51:54] completely
[1:51:56] forsaken
[1:51:58] and there is Jesus
[1:52:00] there with his arms stretched out
[1:52:03] and yet
[1:52:05] [Music]
[1:52:07] he led someone
[1:52:09] to the kingdom even in his death even
[1:52:13] before he died
[1:52:14] still leading Souls
[1:52:17] to the kingdom of God and there is Jesus
[1:52:22] now coming into us
[1:52:24] [Music]
[1:52:28] and how that burden should be in us all
[1:52:31] the time
[1:52:32] Jesus said take up your cross
[1:52:36] and follow me
[1:52:38] that cross is heavy he was carrying that
[1:52:42] cross that cross put him out of the
[1:52:44] churches
[1:52:46] that cross caused him to give up any
[1:52:48] type of riches that he would have ever
[1:52:49] had
[1:52:51] that cross required a complete and total
[1:52:55] separation from Jesus Christ himself
[1:52:59] and then he said now you take up your
[1:53:01] cross
[1:53:03] you take your cross and you did you do
[1:53:06] what I do
[1:53:09] it's not just being a good Christian
[1:53:12] it's everything in our lives
[1:53:18] carrying that cross
[1:53:20] Lord whatever you would have me do
[1:53:23] whatever Lord that that I can give to
[1:53:26] you that I can get rid of or that I can
[1:53:28] do I want to do it and I want to I want
[1:53:31] to be that one
[1:53:33] I want to be that one that the master
[1:53:35] sends out
[1:53:37] and says go get them
[1:53:39] and then I might bring one in and I Lord
[1:53:42] I I brought one in since there's all
[1:53:45] these empty seats go get more
[1:53:48] go get em continue to bring them in
[1:53:52] that is Christianity
[1:53:54] that is the true meaning behind this
[1:53:58] parable
[1:53:59] but Martin you go all over the world I
[1:54:01] know and and you're you're doing your
[1:54:04] best
[1:54:05] to give more into this Kingdom
