========================================

40 he says things that are to be things that are now that's where we're at right now things that are now are only potential calling for uh calling for the things that are to be and and my message is what I am to be so what I am now I'm only potential of what I'm going to be amen and you are all living in a potential right now and and the the the the word potential is the existing impossibility it's capable of development in into actuality what it is it's a a dormant power it's a hidden strength that hasn't been manifested yet but it's in each and every person and and and right now we are only the potential of what we are going to be but it's not so much in the future the way we think it's going to be when we see Jesus when we're in the Rapture but I believe that we are potentially manifesting it every single day the closer we get to the Lord and the only reason is not to glorify ourselves not to say oh I'm this or I'm that but it's so that we could give to other people yes so that we could display Jesus Christ to those that are less fortunate so that we could be that reflection and brother Bram I know he would always say about that old black sister that she would say I'm I'm not what I ought to be and I'm not what I want to be but I'm so glad that I'm not what I used to be and and for every Christian when brother bam says this comforted by those words because we see our failures we see everything we are and we we have an expected end and we see our condition and sometimes it's overwhelming to see our expected end or to see the vision and yet see our condition and we say ah man I'm not what I I'm supposed to be but I'm glad that I'm not what I used to be am and I started to think think about that about we rejoice in that I'm not I'm glad that I'm not what I used to be but if you think about that the first words brother bam says that I'm glad that I'm not what I used to be that shows that God has saved us and that that shows that by grace and only by Grace God has took us out of the place that we used to be so in thinking about those words and thinking about that thing that brother brandham says that I'm so glad that I'm not what I used to be then I I I'm comforted by the words I'm not what I'm supposed to be and I'm not what what I'm what I want to be because if God has taken me by Grace from what I used to be to what I'm now I know by Grace he's gonna take me on I know by Grace he's gonna allow me to develop because because the I'm not what I'm supposed to be is means that you still got potential it means you still got dormant power in you it means that you haven't hidden strength still and that there's still development that needs to be done I'd rather be that than say I'm all finished in this broken up condition I might look nice in my suit I might look like this and that but I'm still broken up to compare to what I'm supposed to be so I don't want to be satisfied of who I am right now I want more I want more and I want more and I want more of God I want more and what that means is each and every one of us has potential inside of us and that potential is a hidden strength from God it's a hidden power that is not developed yet well brother I've been in the message 50 years it doesn't matter if you're Paul Paul said I press toward the mark of the High Calling he says I haven't come I haven't apprehended yet imagine that man saying that that man that that the Bible says he went up to the third Heavens yet he says I count not myself to apprehend it yet but I I forget about those things that are in the past and I press towards the mark of the High Calling that's where we're at today whether you're a new Christian whether you started your your journey in the Lord or you've been here for 20 years we're marching on you still have potential because you still have Breath of Life in you and that means there's more of God to receive and there's more of God to give to other people that's where we're at today potential is not what's already been done potential means there is more to come brothers and sisters and all of that potential of Eternity is in you now sometimes I look here and I look there to find a fulfillment of God but all all of that potential the Bible said he that predestinated you has already called you and he that has called you has already Justified you and he that has Justified you has already glorified you so everything that that you need for your journey today everything that you're going to have to go through is already inside you right now brother brandham says in the Easter seal preached in 1965 in paragraph 97 he says now notice it's the earnest or the potential the quickening power of your Resurrection when you receive the holy spirit is dwelling in you the potential of it brother we're waiting for that Resurrection we're waiting for those body changes and he says it's already in you potentially you've got the potential in it when you receive the Holy Spirit but but if we continue on even before the Holy Spirit you already have the potential in you let's see what brother brandham says he says in the exposition of the seven Church ages in the sard sardan church age he says and the way it was done was by God's perfect will and programming now he's going to talk about Lutheran Methodist and Pentecostal and he's going to talk about how the seven Church ages they went from these stages historically he says the way it was done was by God's perfect will and programming the lutherans had the Holy Ghost potentially under justification the Methodist had it potentially under sanctification and today it is brought back a restoration the Holy Ghost is here and now we are living those Church ages individually when somebody gives their heart to the Lord they have been Justified and if you've been Justified it means you were predestinated in the beginning that's what the Bible says in Romans so so whenever you've already received justification you already have have the potential and whenever you're Sanctified you're potentially receive the Holy Ghost but he says now the Holy Ghost is here there's no more waiting there's no more waiting and waiting and waiting you could receive the Holy Ghost as you sit here today you could receive it you could receive eternal life now he says God the great God if you've got eternal life The Germ of Life Of God was in God at the beginning so if you've got eternal life that eternal life was already in God and that's a piece of God and that's you okay and you were there you were in his thinking your name and all and he by Foreign knowledge or dained you to see this he already knew what kind of color of hair I would have my name how what I would do all of my mistakes sometimes we think that things are just happened coincidentally or or or by accident we do not live as Christians by accident it could be a surprise for me and you but it's not accident to God it's for ordained he says we did not become seed see we are the germ or we are seeds today each and every person that has believed in Jesus Christ we are seeds and he says we did not become seed by the rebirth we are seed and therefore we were reborn only the elect can be reborn because we were seed and is the reason we could be quickened so you already have the seed in you and and whenever you receive the holy spirit all the holy spirit is doing is quickening that life that was there in the beginning with God that's who you are and no matter what the devil says no matter what your own mind tries to tell you of who you are you were there in the beginning and everything is on purpose that's what I love about God's word that if you truly understand that every single word every single period every single cross te and dotted eye in the word is on purpose this Bible becomes a new Bible and nothing is by accident so all of the begats so and so begat that person so and so God begat him and them and that's all on purpose and there is a message there too amen every single word in this Bible is on purpose and as far as I know we were in this word and you are on purpose you are intentional God has predestined you the Bible says I want to read it again it's in Romans 8:30 he says moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he also called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified that word predestined is a very very amazing word for us because pre means before destination means end even before we were a twinkle in God's eye even before there was an Adam there we were already predestinated pre means before destination means end that means that that when he had you in his thinking he already set your end before you even started he already put everything that you're going to need for the journey inside you before you even were born in this earth that's what predestined means that we are packed we're full of life what our healing that we're waiting on God for is in us already the holy ghost that we're asking for that peace of God it's already in us and that seed that already brother Bram says already has the transforming power inside of itself it just needs the word it just needs the gospel preached to it and something happens to it brother brandham says or I'm going to go to Genesis 1:1 and 12 it says and God said let the Earth bring forth grass and the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after its kind whose seed is in itself so the fruit of after his kind whose seed is already inside of it upon the Earth and it was so and the Earth brought forth grass and Herb yielding seed after its kind and the tree yielding fre fruit whose seed was in itself after his kind and God saw that it was good when God in the beginning laid forth the seeds he said every single seed is going to have every single tree that you see here today all the forest that you see started with the seed sometimes the seed doesn't look too pretty I I was um forgive me Brothers but I was there just rumaging there in the in the office and I saw the mustard seats there you guys have sitting there little tiny mustard seat right there tiny tiny tiny if I drop it I'm going to lose it if I had one in my hand that's how how tiny it is but inside of that seed holds one of such a large large tree and within that tree holds thousands and thousands more seeds and inside of every individual seed holds more another tree that holds more seeds that holds more trees that holds more seeds that holds more trees all the way to the end inside one seed that's who we are Jesus says in Revelations 1 18 he says I am the Alpha and the Omega I am beginning and I am end inside that man had the beginning and the end inside of him he was a stoop shouldered man when they saw him nobody um cared about who he was yet inside of him was everything all life all of God's attributes everything that God wanted to express to you and I was in that man Jesus Christ my salvation everything that I needed that was in him when God created the seed he put its purpose in it and it put the a potential to achieve that purpose whatever you might be whatever God has called you to do God has put a purpose inside you an eternal purpose sometimes we feel like oh well maybe I'm not supposed to do anything no God wants you to be working amen when you have a purpose in your heart he'll put every potential he'll put his power in you so that you could fulfill that potential or that purpose and whenever we have that Vision whenever we have that goal inside of us it gives us a clear path of where to go because when we don't have Vision when we don't have a goal we're not we're not going to know where to go I can come to church every single Sunday every single Wednesday and and still if I don't have a purpose of God if God is not in my vision Jesus Christ then I'm just I'm just wandering around I'm taking any path I can can take even though I I look like a Christian even though I look good in a suit even though I have my family here if I don't have my purpose as Jesus Christ then I'm wandering Any Which Way But when you have Jesus Christ in Your Vision many of us have many Ambitions and we have a purpose to be successful that's great brother brandham says let's be sane Christians and work to the the very minute and let's do what we have to do if you're a mechanic if you're this he said if you're hoing potatoes or if you're planting wheat he says God will find me there until the very end so that that's what we should be doing but then we should be centered in the greatest ambition the greatest Vision which is Jesus Christ and whenever we have that all of our our family our work our successes our adventures whatever we want to do if it's centered in Jesus Christ oh man you're going to be the best at what you do you're going to have everything that that you need for the journey so God when he created all those seeds the Bible says in that seventh day he rested he didn't have to plant no more he didn't have to work and continue to work and continue to uh to bring forth seed and trees no everything that was in that seed that seed had everything to transform itself and that's why we have this beautiful desert that's why we have beautiful forests and jungles and all of that because those seeds had all the power and the transforming power brother brandham says and what is that transforming power where is it we we come to church so we can we can receive something but from God we go go here we go to conventions we go there but the transforming power is in you already that's where it's at where wherever you might be you might be in your closet in your room you might be at work you might be driving and that transforming power can transform you where you are at it's not a location it's not some some great preacher here and there it's you God already put everything inside of you when God told Adam to multiply Adam already had everybody inside of him he had all the potential was once he told Abraham he said he said your your seed is going to be like the Sands of the sea and and like the stars in the sky your seed from one man he had the all of Israel in him and and when he told Adam that Adam was supposed to do that he was supposed to bring forth not only life naturally but he was supposed to bring forth eternal life yes through him he was supposed to that spoken word he was supposed to give that life to each and every person but we know that he failed and and he multiplied sin in everything that's what he gave to everybody was sin was failure was problems and the Bible says that through one man all are Fallen under sin because he that's what he multiplied because he fell and it was all in him when that came out sin came out but then Jesus fulfilled God's desire the Bible says that we were in him we were in Jesus Christ I I've heard many many people say and I think even brother bradam said that man Jesus lived a solitary life Jesus didn't have the pleasures that we could have he he he couldn't have a girlfriend he couldn't have a wife and family he couldn't have a great career because because he had a purpose to be done but but I realized in the message things that are to be that his bride he that's all he was doing was working for his bride getting things ready see when you're about to get married you start getting the house ready you make sure she has a home to live under you make sure everything is good before you guys say your idos you prepare a mansion might be a little home might be a little humble place there it might be a nice place but you're preparing your Mansion Jes Jesus says I go to prepare a mansion I go to prepare a place for you I'll come back and as Jesus as he was walking even though he seemed alone the Bible says and the message declares that the bride was already in him just like Adam Adam was all alone and God says it is not good for man to be alone so he didn't go and get another piece of dirt out of Adam out of him because he's a seed out of him produce his bride and Jesus whenever he was being when the spirit of God left him in Gethsemane it says that the bride was there with him the bride was there and when he died he died for her and the Bible says that that if the if the uh corn of wheat fall into the ground and it die it biteth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit amen he was alone but inside of him had all the life and he had to die he had to be planted so much fruit can come out of him he was that seed and now we are the result of Jesus Christ maybe we lived a certain life back then maybe we're we're still struggling to be Christians maybe we're solid in the Lord but God has called each and every seed and we are a product of that man Jesus Christ he died alone but inside of him had millions and millions and millions of souls waiting and crying and saying praise the Lord there has been a lamb worthy to open up that book who was he he was the slame lamb he was the only one worthy because he paid the price for you and I that was Jesus Christ for us he suffered and we suffered with him we died with him we were buried with him and now you are risen with him and manifests his attributes of God setting in Heavenly places brother brandham says that in the things that are to be that right now we're manifesting his attributes and he was able to say it is finished and now you have all that power in you but remember it's it's dormant it's a hidden and it's inactive and it needs to be developed you have to act on it you have to take your step of Faith you have to believe that God by his grace he could offer more within you now all we have to do is accept it brother brandham said that if Jesus Christ was here to this morning or when he was talking he said if Jesus Christ was here tonight he can't do no more for you amen imagine Jesus Christ with with his blood and his nails and and brother baram says he can't do no more for you because he did everything on the cross everything that you need has already been done brothers and sisters if you need the Holy Ghost it's here amen if you need healing if you need restoration if you need your family amen it's already here and he's ready to give it to you we have to step up and say lord it's for me we have to take that that purpose and that potential and move on with it and say Lord I'm gonna grab it I'm gonna take everything that you have to offer me and and I'm going to be greedy about it we we have to be greedy about what God has given us because the more we give the more he has to give God is never exhausted in power he's never exhausted in healing the more you take the more he wants to give believe me on that I'm I'm a testimony of that my wife is a testimony if if if God wouldn't have healed her I don't know where I would be at if God wouldn't have saved me I don't know where I would be at but because of his healing power because of his salvation I'm standing here today just as a little testimony just as a little light for those that are in my work or somebody some of my family I'm there as a little light showing the the manifested glory of God maybe it sounds tremendous oh you are the manifested word no it's your daily life your little light that you give to people that's manifesting the word of God today everything that you do every word that you speak you're giving life to somebody there was a story in the Bible it's it's in Matthew 25 and he talks about a man this this this great man that go went to another country because he was going to get his kingdom and and he had all these servants and he said you know what I'm going to a far country but I'll be back to receive my kingdom and he says I'm going to give you talents I'm going to give you coins I'm going to give you money I'm going to give you something and he the Bible says that he one he gave five talents and the other he gave two and the other one he gave one and he said he given it to them according to their ability God will give you the potential according to your ability he'll give you something a purpose in your life a gift in your life according to your ability each and every one of us God has given us something and that's the Holy Ghost the Bible says that the Holy Ghost is a gift and when I think about gifts oh man I who doesn't love gifts that's mine that's that's for my salvation that's for my restoration that's for my my mind to be sane that's for my healing that's for my protection that's he is my comforter he is everything to me that's for me but whenever he said he given the gift of the Holy Spirit and he's given the Holy Spirit as a gift he also INSP Spanish they call it Thon it means that he it it's it's a responsibility it's it's a gift a talent that God has given you every single thing and that kind of gift it's not just for us now it's to give to other people it's to be put into work amen and when God has given us the holy spirit it's just not so that I can stay home come to church go home go to work come to church go home go work and that's it but it's for me to use and me to work with and whenever I know that there's somebody that is in need nobody's nobody's uh talked to them but God has put that in your heart God is doing something God's saying here I gave you this Talent I giving you this gift to use it Lord I'm not a preacher Lord I'm not a singer Lord I I don't know what to do but you can give them your testimony you can just be an open ear to them a lot of people just need somebody to sit there and and sympathize and empathize with them what I've realized is one of the greatest gifts I I heard this from a brother and it hit me like a ton of bre bricks he said one of the greatest gifts you can have is empathy but empathy comes with a great price yes the brother that was talking about this just lost his son he lost his son from drugs and instead of saying why why did God take my child why did God do this he said God gave me a gift that I could empathize with those that have lost their children and I know exactly what they're going through and now I can be the help for them what a gift brother brandham says there there was never one crosseyed person come to him without being healed that came with a price every time he would see that person he thought of his little baby girl how she was suffering so much much that her eyes crossed and now every time somebody would come he would see her and he say that's that's my baby whenever he would see the old Spanish man he said without shoes he said that's my dad he didn't say oh there's this man oh he didn't say oh well I don't know who this person is he started to look at his father how he was 50 some years old and he died because he was a drunk but yet he gave his heart to the Lord at the very end he saw his dad and he said that man had to be healed why because he had the gift of empathy he suffered he suffered so that he could give and brothers sometimes our suffering we don't know why we're going through it sometimes we don't know why our Trials Come A like waves they come like waves not knowing God is preparing you to give eternal life to somebody else to to give Li words of encouragement to somebody that needs it and only you can understand that person so he gave these people talents according to their ability according to their purpose he gave them this potential and God will give you a certain amount of potential according to your purpose and one one he went with that five and what did he do he doubled his propit and whenever the king came back as the king the righteous King he said what have you done with my talents he said I've doubled it for you Lord the two came and he doubled it to four and he said praise God he doubled it then he went to the one that had the one the gift that he gave him and he went and he hid it he said he said I don't want to lose it I I don't want anything to happen to it I'm going to hide it the gift that God gave him the potential God gave him with his ability God knew he had the ability to do it but he instead he hid it and when he said well why didn't you do anything with it the Bible actually says he says I was afraid I was afraid Lord I didn't know what to do with it I was afraid many times we we hide from what God has called us to do it's easier to hide from the gift that God has called us when you know there is a call a deep deep calling coming from Heaven to your soul but we're hide we're hiding from our gift we're hiding from the potential that God giv potential that God has given us and when God one day has to come he says what have you done with what I've given you Lord I'm I was just too afraid I was too scared to use my gift I was too scared to testify I was too scared to tell that person before they got into that car and started drunk driving I was too scared but today is the day we still alive brothers and sisters and each and every one of you have potential according to your ability you God has given you his eternal power not not when you were born not when you accepted Christ he predestinated that potential in you he already knew who you were going to be he already knew all of your plans all of your detours everything you were going to do and he says I'm going to place it in them because they are my faithful servant they are the ones to carry on this Mission God has missions for each and every one of you wherever it might be whatever whoever it might be to God has given it to us the worst feeling for me is not making mistakes Brothers Brothers we make well I won't include you in that you guys might be perfect but I make so many mistakes I make too many sometimes it hurts other people sometimes sometimes I I I just make these little mistakes that I shouldn't have made him but you know what that's not the worst feeling my worst feeling is the should have would have could have that's the worst feeling I'd rather go I'd rather go to God's purpose knowing that I'm just a baby and I'm going to fall and I'm going to get back up and I'm I'm not going to make the right decision ision sometimes but I'm going and I'm fulfilling God's purpose I'd rather do that than say man I should have done that I could have done that I would have done that but I didn't do it I was afraid Lord no I'd rather go as much as I can and I know by Grace if he has taken me out of the World by Grace he's going to take me on that's what that's our life today mistakes we make brother Bram says a Christian backslides every day it's getting back up and going it's saying God has a purpose for me I have a mission to do I'm going to do it whether it's to bring your whole family in or it's to preach to thousands or it's to go here or to go there to the sick go to the needy it's whatever it might be maybe it's to suffer so other people don't have to yeah whatever it might be I always sympathize with with Jeremiah because God promised him so much you're going to speak to Kings you're going to speak to monarchs you're going to preach to Nations and he was a little boy saying oh praise God then he finds himself in a dungeon not anybody's dungeon but his own people's tied up suffering nobody listened to him when he said Babylon is coming Babylon is coming Babylon is coming nobody listened to him and then he was there saying Lord you lied to me Lord Lord you promised me all these things Lord and then when he said Lord I don't want to do this anymore I I give up I don't want to do anything no more in that dungeon the Bible says that the word of God came up like fire in his bones and he said I couldn't help but to prophesy that gift is coming out one way or another and and now we are blessed because of that man thousands and thousands of years of people have been blessed and saved because of those books that's us whether you live a good life whether you got to live a hard life we are here to give and and and knowing that that in US is all of eternity inside of each and every person there was that Young Rich ruler as I'm going to just take a little bit more time but there was a young Rich ruler just in his name he was an ambitious man he was rich and he was a ruler so he had Ambitions he had purposes in his life he he if he had a goal he would achieve it he was a young Rich ruler but the Bible says he was lacking something he was still missing something so he goes to the very best person to go to he went to the Fountain of eternal life and he says Jesus I've done everything I could do he said he said how can I receive eternal life I've accomplished this and I accomplished that see a potential is something that has not happened yet him he fulfilled his potential I've done this and I've done that and and I'm successful but Lord I'm still lacking something Lord he says drop everything he looked at that man and he saw all the potential that was in that young man he saw his gift inside of him and he says you drop everything and come and follow me and that man looked and he said all my success and everything no I can't do it and he dropped eternal life and he left and the Bible says that he in the end of his life he had many many storehouses and he had many many many riches and he sat there happy and he said oh my soul is satisfied I I have storehouses here I have this and I am satisfied you know what satisfied means there's no more potential I've completed everything I wanted to do I I'm I'm depleted of potential everything that I've wanted to do on Earth has been done he said I'm satisfied then the next look we see and his eyes are looking up in hell and brother he goes and he cries out to to Abraham says just give me a drink and brother brandham he says in the message come follow me he says that his gift begin to rise up with in him and he wanted to be an evangelist then Jesus when he saw him he saw his gift he saw his potential but whenever he was there in Hell his potential began to rise up and he said go and and I've got Brothers out there in the world that are are not saved please send somebody what his potential begin to rise up inside of him the very potential brother bam says Jesus was going to call him to be an evangelist but he pushed that down so that he could do his Earthly Ambitions that's okay but do what God has called you to do because one soul is worth all of the money that we're going to make is worth more than all the success more than everything all the adventures we're going to take God's going to bless you don't worry but put him first put him first he says people try to put the finger on someone that goes too high he said well it's true we find many people who try to jump instead of fly and they make a wreckage there on the side of the shore but they never try to point the finger to those who doesn't go high enough I encourage you to go jump go as hard as you can for the Lord yes I'd rather that than saying I should have I could have and I would have but I didn't he says that many people here on Earth are living under the god-given privilege and he says I'm not saying that you're lost he says but you're you're you're son and daughter of God you're living under your under your privilege and your conduct each day as the Holy Spirit brings forth it before the father and gives away these things the way that you do and you're still a son and daughter but you'll never be brought up to the place where you should be now each and every one of us have a responsibility and it's not to be the best here or there it's just to give God your very best that God has placed eternal life inside of you and potential Brothers God has potential still well God is God he has everything already no God the Bible says he's omnipotent you know what that means all powerful potent potential he has all potential in him even though he's got eternity to Eternity he still got potential when he created all the galaxies the huge Sun that you see and the great big stars that are greater than this sun all of the galaxies and all of the the the Milky Way that we see and all of the stars and moons and planets and everything and once he did all of that he still had potential he still had more to give yes then he began to create everything on this Earth he created the animals he created the fish the sky he created the birds he created everything creeping thing and all every crawling thing and still yet was he depleted no he still had potential am he still had more in the chamber he still had more and us we have that potential because we are a peace of God today you have everything every Power that he used to create all of that you have it inside you now and the way you receive or you ignite that potential is whenever you see Jesus Christ as a resurrected King when you see him in the Holy Ghost then that Resurrection life has opened up and has re you've received that potential you've received that Awakening Jesus says I am the resurrection and life when you see Jesus Christ you've received it God is your potential and then your potential with his potential brother Bram says when two omnipotent meet all powerful Alpha and Omega there in front of you then you've received eternal life maybe those are big words but God has promised it to us as simple and as as people full of failures he's promised it to us simple people praise God for that I'm not somebody great I'm not somebody I'm nobody yet God has chosen to put the seed of eternal life in me he put it in you also so that you can pack that eternal life let us stand to our feet Brothers every time I see when I saw all those mustard seeds in there no matter how ugly they might look how small they might be have you seen acorn you've seen different kinds of seeds they there's no beauty that you can desire of them but if you look deep enough you'll see a forest in them if you look deep enough you'll see fruits that will bear more seeds that will bear more trees more seeds and more trees all the way to Eternity just in that one seed and maybe we're no bodies
