[38:51] [Music]
[38:53] yes amen let's all stand
[38:57] sister Jessica if you could put up
[38:59] Romans chapter 8 verse number
[39:04] 26 familiar scripture if you're here on
[39:07] Wednesday
[39:10] night it reads like this sister Lily go
[39:12] ahead and continue
[39:14] please likewise the spirit also helpeth
[39:17] our infirmities so we know not what we
[39:20] should pray for as we ought but the
[39:22] spirit itself make it intercession for
[39:25] us with groanings which cannot be
[39:28] uttered and he that searcheth the hearts
[39:31] knoweth what is the mind of the spirit
[39:34] because he maketh intercession for the
[39:37] Saints according to the will of
[39:40] God let's bow our heads Our
[39:43] Father those words father have been such
[39:46] a comfort to
[39:47] me I pray Lord that you'd bless us
[39:51] tonight bless our speakers father bless
[39:53] the music and Lord may you your presence
[39:57] be here with
[39:58] us in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[40:03] amen you can be
[40:06] seated we're doing something different
[40:09] thank you we're doing something
[40:11] different tonight and uh I'm excited I
[40:13] already see the Jeremy bagot fan club
[40:17] over
[40:17] there with all those kids they're
[40:21] pointing and waving and everything
[40:22] there's daddy up there on the pulpit
[40:24] brother it's good to see you my friend
[40:26] God bless you
[40:28] keano God bless you um so tonight what I
[40:33] want to do as I had on my heart to have
[40:36] some of the brothers in church that
[40:39] don't necessarily get a chance to come
[40:41] up and to talk about a subject and
[40:46] they're maybe a bit out of their comfort
[40:48] zone but I I think it's it's okay for us
[40:51] to get out of our comfort zone sometimes
[40:54] and uh I'll say a few words on this
[40:57] subject of prayer and then I've asked
[41:01] brother Jeremy bagot brother Josiah AO
[41:04] to say a few words after me between 10
[41:07] and 15 minutes each and I um I think
[41:12] it's going to be a blessing to hear hear
[41:14] from somebody besides me and brother ly
[41:17] and brother Aaron in this church
[41:20] um I uh on Wednesday night I'll give you
[41:22] a little recap I spoke on prayer and and
[41:28] I tried every way that I
[41:30] could to say the same thing in many
[41:35] different
[41:36] ways and uh I I read the scripture I
[41:40] just read and what I kept saying was if
[41:44] you really get into the spirit of
[41:47] prayer then it's no longer you that asks
[41:52] for these things it's the spirit that's
[41:54] inside of you that asks I give a
[41:58] testimony
[42:00] um maybe I said it this morning was I
[42:03] gave my heart to the Lord when I turned
[42:07] 21 and the first thing that I asked is
[42:11] okay I see a career on on the horizon I
[42:14] see I'm graduating from college here
[42:15] pretty soon Lord I need a wife and and I
[42:19] want a wife and I want kids and and I
[42:22] want to this is the direction I want to
[42:24] go but Lord I will never no matter if
[42:27] you give me a wife or not I will never
[42:30] return to the sinful ways that I've
[42:33] lived and it was that
[42:35] night I uh I got on my knees and and I
[42:38] asked the Lord for that and I really
[42:40] don't believe that that was necessarily
[42:42] Daniel Evans praying I believe that it
[42:45] was a spirit within me wanting to be
[42:48] with me for
[42:49] eternity and laid it on my heart to make
[42:52] a change I'll read that scripture again
[42:56] Romans 8:26 six says this likewise the
[42:59] spirit also helpeth with our infirmities
[43:01] helpeth our infirmities for we know not
[43:04] what we should pray for as we
[43:07] ought so we really don't know the mind
[43:11] of God he says we probably should know
[43:13] the mind of God but we really don't know
[43:15] the mind of God we think we know what we
[43:19] want to pray for we think we we want to
[43:21] pray for being healed or like me as a
[43:23] young man I wanted I prayed I wanted a
[43:25] wife
[43:27] we think we know but we don't
[43:29] necessarily know
[43:33] but the spirit
[43:36] itself makes
[43:38] intercessions for us with groanings
[43:41] which cannot be uttered so these words
[43:45] that the the spirit speaks through us as
[43:48] we pray if we really surrender ourselves
[43:50] and the most important thing is we have
[43:52] to surrender our own desires we have to
[43:55] surrender the Bible to King James says
[43:58] lusts lusts in in this context it means
[44:02] our desires our wants we need to
[44:05] surrender those things to truly get into
[44:08] the spirit and then that is when you see
[44:11] prayers answered believe we heard a
[44:14] testimony this morning that brother
[44:15] Jordan gave of a prayer that was was
[44:17] truly
[44:18] answered and uh believe it was Russell
[44:21] right I think his brother Russell
[44:23] Wallace um was praying and that his how
[44:27] his farm wouldn't be destroyed his his
[44:28] Ranch wouldn't be destroyed with the
[44:30] fire and then that they would have water
[44:35] and then the Lord just overd delivered
[44:38] with just an incredible gusher of water
[44:41] in this
[44:42] well and we have to understand that we
[44:45] have to trust in God and it says the
[44:49] next verse and he that searches the
[44:53] hearts knows what is the mind mind of
[44:57] the spirit so this one that searches the
[45:00] hearts is our Lord and savior Our God
[45:03] and he
[45:05] knows he knows what we need he knows
[45:10] what the mind of the spirit is because
[45:13] he makes intercessions for the Saints
[45:16] according to the will of God the will of
[45:20] God is the key there and then look at
[45:23] the next verse it's a verse we've all
[45:25] memorized it's a verse we all know about
[45:27] than probably any other verse maybe John
[45:30] 3:16 and we
[45:32] know verse number
[45:34] 28 and we know that all things work
[45:37] together for good to them that love God
[45:40] and to them who are called according to
[45:42] his
[45:43] purpose so we pray we get on our knees
[45:46] we try to surrender ourselves to the
[45:48] Lord Lord I I want what you want in my
[45:50] life I know I know that that you know
[45:54] what's best for me I want to get into
[45:56] your spirit I want to pray and then we
[45:59] know that all these things work together
[46:01] for the good and many times we
[46:04] struggle and we pray and we struggle and
[46:08] nothing seems to happen sister Irma I
[46:11] saw you walking great
[46:14] today you couldn't walk a couple weeks
[46:16] ago the Lord you struggled you suffered
[46:20] but the Lord stepped on the scene and we
[46:23] still have little aches and pains but
[46:26] those aches and pains are for our own
[46:28] perfecting those struggling is is for
[46:30] our own perfecting when I was that young
[46:32] man at 21 years old Lord give me a wife
[46:36] I want to get married I want to have a
[46:38] family I want to have this career and
[46:40] then I still said but but Lord I no
[46:44] matter if you give me one or not I'll
[46:45] still serve
[46:48] you then got
[46:51] up I was in the middle of the night woke
[46:54] up the next morning I said all right

[46:59] nope same girls that are usually
[47:01] [Laughter]
[47:03] here went to uh went to Young people's
[47:08] functions nope this isn't really
[47:11] working six months passed a year passed
[47:16] two years passed three years four years
[47:20] five years six years past and I still
[47:23] hadn't met this one that I prayed for
[47:26] that night but I always look back and I
[47:28] said Lord I'm going to keep my end and
[47:31] if you don't give me a wife then I'm
[47:34] still going to serve you then we had a I
[47:37] went to a volleyball game a youth event
[47:42] at Jacob's Park and I met this young
[47:46] lady who was I know I don't know like 18
[47:50] years
[47:51] old and started talking
[47:54] and here we are
[47:58] married but brother Dan you know when I
[48:00] when I prayed that when I was
[48:03] 21 I was on my knees and I was praying
[48:05] and I got up and I was like Lord where's
[48:06] my wife at that time she was only
[48:11] 14 so I couldn't have married her then
[48:14] anyways God had to raise her up a little
[48:16] bit before I got old before she got old
[48:19] enough and I could you know marry her so
[48:21] she was 20 and I was uh I was I
[48:25] 26 yeah she always tells me I'm seven
[48:28] years older than her but I'm actually
[48:29] only
[48:31] six depends on what time of the year I'm
[48:34] I'm July and she's December and yeah um
[48:39] but prayer is so important I gave the
[48:43] testimony on Wednesday night that I
[48:45] witnessed to a
[48:47] lady and I said something that that
[48:49] didn't mean much to me because it was
[48:52] just something that I deal with every
[48:54] day I told her I said The more more you
[48:57] pray the more you want to
[49:00] pray and the less you pray the more
[49:04] difficult it is to
[49:06] pray and it's true with us you'll find
[49:10] that if you haven't prayed and you say
[49:11] Lord I really want to start praying it's
[49:12] going to be the hardest thing that you
[49:14] can do your mind's going to be going all
[49:16] over the place you're goingon to be
[49:17] checking your text your phone your your
[49:19] wrist is going to be vibrating with a
[49:21] phone call or or a text or or whatever
[49:23] it is and and every distraction is going
[49:25] to be there but stay with
[49:28] it and
[49:30] try and then the next day keep praying
[49:34] and the next day keep praying and and I
[49:36] feel like I've gone years
[49:38] before and I feel like Lord did you hear
[49:41] anything that I've said in this past
[49:43] year Lord did you I haven't seen any
[49:46] sign from you I haven't seen anything
[49:47] Supernatural you haven't you haven't
[49:49] gave me a dream you haven't given me a
[49:50] vision you have't you haven't given me
[49:53] anything Lord I don't know am I doing
[49:54] something wrong
[49:57] Lord are you even hearing
[50:00] me and
[50:01] then I'll see I'll be able to look
[50:05] behind me and see this road that I came
[50:08] and wow he was hearing me every step of
[50:11] the way and he was providing for me
[50:13] every step of the way and I just didn't
[50:15] notice because he was so humble and so
[50:18] subtle and here we are today I uh always
[50:22] prayed for my children and always prayed
[50:24] for Daniel and meline and and the times
[50:27] got really hard when they stray like all
[50:29] kids stray and you do but God loves you
[50:33] still and God's God's taking care of you
[50:36] his hand is upon you when you
[50:39] stray and you go on and on and on and as
[50:43] parents you pray for your children and
[50:46] then all of a sudden your son will be
[50:50] singing in church your daughter will be
[50:53] married to a fine Christian boy and you
[50:56] think wow W I struggled I fasted I
[51:01] prayed and I didn't even
[51:03] notice and here we are and he answered
[51:07] every single prayer when you're praying
[51:10] for your children when you're praying
[51:13] for a husband when you're praying for a
[51:15] a
[51:16] wife go before him in prayer and the
[51:20] Bible says Jesus said he that knocketh
[51:23] it shall be opened not
[51:28] wait
[51:30] no
[51:31] Lord
[51:33] Lord
[51:35] father father and keep on knocking keep
[51:38] on knocking Lord I am going to be here
[51:40] knocking at this door until it's open
[51:43] because your word says that he that
[51:45] knocks it shall be open I'm going to
[51:48] stand here and keep knocking until you
[51:50] open it have a clear conscience and have
[51:53] a clear heart and be willing to take the
[51:56] gift that he gives you because I promise
[51:58] you it'll work out better for you in the
[52:00] end but don't give up on prayer keep
[52:04] praying and like I said I've gone years
[52:07] and not had the
[52:09] experiences that I I I remember
[52:12] having and I look back and he answered
[52:15] every single prayer it was just in his
[52:18] way and if we have time I'll read a
[52:20] scripture that says that very thing when
[52:23] I put out um that we were going to do
[52:27] this brother Jeremy I said I would like
[52:30] to get some a few of the brothers to
[52:33] that haven't been up here in the Pulpit
[52:35] to say a few words to the congregation I
[52:38] said 10 or 15 minutes brother Jeremy
[52:40] sent such a sweet and humble text and I
[52:45] uh I don't have my phone I'd like to
[52:48] read it to the congregation but it it
[52:49] was just so sweet and he basically said
[52:52] like I'm not worthy but I'll give it
[52:55] I'll try
[52:57] brother Jeremy is somebody that he's in
[53:00] the word he's in the word all the time
[53:03] he's always listening to sermons he he
[53:06] reads his Bible a lot he's they're if
[53:09] you know Jeremy and Angela they're
[53:11] always in church even now they got a got
[53:14] a whole herd of kids it's good thing
[53:18] they looked at me they just give me
[53:19] thumbs up it they got all the all these
[53:22] kids and they're still here and they're
[53:24] they're raising their these new children
[53:27] to to fear the lord and to love the Lord
[53:30] and to be in church they're teaching
[53:32] them right and brother Jeremy has just
[53:34] been he's been a blessing to me he's
[53:36] been a friend to me and I asked him he
[53:40] he volunteered and I said yes I think it
[53:43] would be a blessing to hear what the
[53:45] Lord might place on your heart about
[53:47] this subject of prayer so brother Jeremy
[53:51] I'll introduce you and may God be with
[53:53] you and and bless every word word that
[53:57] you
[54:17] say good
[54:20] evening Let's
[54:23] uh guess we've already prayed
[54:30] and I'm a little nervous I don't talk to
[54:33] many people at once I talk to
[54:35] individuals
[54:37] at at times and uh it's uh it's a little
[54:41] different but it's
[54:44] um because I got to look at
[54:47] you and talk at the same time and uh
[54:51] keep my
[54:52] thoughts um straight um let's let's go
[54:56] to
[54:57] Luke and you don't have to put this one
[55:00] up on the screen if you have your Bibles
[55:02] you can go to Luke 22 because I'm only
[55:05] going to read half of one verse and our
[55:08] machine back there does not read
[55:21] half and it's Luke uh 2231
[55:28] when you have it say
[55:31] amen and the Lord said Simon Simon
[55:35] behold Satan hath desired to have you
[55:38] that he may sift you as wheat but I have
[55:42] prayed for thee that thy fa Faith fail
[55:47] not a lot of times we uh we go through
[55:52] this life and we we we like all the
[55:55] scriptures that he has hid hid these
[55:57] words in our hearts and they'll manifest
[56:02] as time goes on because we learn them by
[56:04] and
[56:05] by and so um just just thinking that you
[56:10] know Jesus prayed for
[56:14] me and because he's present
[56:18] today if he's just 2,000 years ago this
[56:21] is just a book a history lesson um
[56:25] something that you can't really rely on
[56:28] but it's the
[56:29] blueprint and brother either brother
[56:32] brother brother brandham said that any
[56:35] testimony you have you should find a
[56:37] word to it so you can anchor it in the
[56:41] heart that God's already given
[56:44] you so
[56:47] um I uh I was working and construction
[56:51] it was uh the first years of Harmony we
[56:53] did Harmony at uh the fox Fox um Fox
[56:57] Theater
[56:58] downtown and
[57:00] um and I was working construction and I
[57:05] got through my day almost to the end of
[57:08] it and I picked up a bucket too heavy
[57:11] and I pulled something in my arm and it
[57:14] hurt I didn't tell anybody of it I
[57:17] always try to practice that scripture in
[57:19] Psalms that
[57:20] says
[57:22] um if I was hungry I would not tell you
[57:27] so I I uh I really believe that God
[57:31] knows our every action he um even his
[57:35] word he says I I write down every thing
[57:39] you say and was like Lord forgive me for
[57:42] all the bad things that I
[57:45] say
[57:46] um and uh and give me encouragement for
[57:50] the things that I do do
[57:52] good but um we were I went to Harmony
[57:56] that night I don't know about you but I
[58:00] I think the devil's been fighting me
[58:01] pretty hard just to get up here um it
[58:05] always happens we're
[58:06] always fighting at home or something
[58:10] something drastic happens and you know
[58:13] you just want to throw in the towel am I
[58:15] am I supposed to encourage people when
[58:18] I'm having such a hard
[58:20] time but we went to Harmony and I was
[58:25] actually still single
[58:27] I went through myself like brother Dan
[58:29] says when you give your heart to the
[58:31] Lord you're you're in the Lord's
[58:34] service and this is the Lord's Arena and
[58:38] he he he's here he invited you here and
[58:42] you came
[58:44] voluntarily sometimes we feel like we're
[58:46] dragged because we're part of the family
[58:48] but you know listen
[58:51] intently to people who who have
[58:55] sojourned with Jesus Jesus a long
[58:58] time um that's why I listen to tapes but
[59:02] at Harmony I was sitting in the
[59:04] balcony and um they were singing a song
[59:07] one of the nap
[59:09] families um was singing a song and I
[59:11] don't remember the song was but I just
[59:14] you know I lifted up a hand like this
[59:16] and this one was the one that hurt and I
[59:19] praised the Lord with this hand most of
[59:21] the time because I just want to remind
[59:25] him yes that he came over a sweet
[59:29] presence came over me and what was hurt
[59:33] stopped
[59:35] instantly
[59:39] um the next testimony I want to tell you
[59:42] is
[59:45] in I put all my things in bookmarks so I
[59:49] wouldn't have to do a lot of
[59:51] flipping um hadasa um she I Pastor her
[59:56] testimony the other night and um it's
[1:00:01] it's been a trial in the half because um
[1:00:05] each of these individual Souls that we
[1:00:07] look
[1:00:08] after
[1:00:10] um
[1:00:13] they they are somewhat
[1:00:17] abandoned and they're they're like just
[1:00:20] ripped apart from their
[1:00:22] families by a by a system to um to the
[1:00:27] preserving of their life really from
[1:00:31] families with hard habits and things
[1:00:35] like that and uh it's it's
[1:00:39] hard and so um we were going to church
[1:00:42] and she really wanted to be baptized and
[1:00:45] the system wouldn't allow that because
[1:00:47] they were saying that you know we were
[1:00:50] influence her in some way and I said no
[1:00:53] you have to go to your dad and you have
[1:00:55] to ask ask him I mean if you were our
[1:00:57] child you could get baptized instantly
[1:01:00] no no questions asked because it's a
[1:01:03] it's a good conscience towards
[1:01:05] God that you want to serve him and uh
[1:01:09] she had um she had trouble in dreams she
[1:01:13] has really bad dreams and if anyone's
[1:01:16] had a nightmare you know brother
[1:01:18] brandham said dreams are when you sleep
[1:01:22] and Visions are when you're
[1:01:24] awake and um and dreams no one can dream
[1:01:28] a dream some people don't dream at all
[1:01:31] they go to bed and they wake up the next
[1:01:33] morning and they're gung-ho and some of
[1:01:36] us are
[1:01:38] troubled we while we sleep and so
[1:01:42] she's troubled sometimes and um and our
[1:01:47] dreams are
[1:01:49] bad and uh we so we my wife and I
[1:01:53] instructed her next time you have back
[1:01:56] dream call on the name of
[1:01:59] Jesus and
[1:02:01] so so
[1:02:04] I this was just given to me
[1:02:09] um uh just in the office something to
[1:02:14] tie your testimony
[1:02:16] to but um first uh first Peter
[1:02:20] 2 9 and
[1:02:23] 10 but ye are a chosen generation
[1:02:27] of royal priesthood a holy nation a
[1:02:30] particular people that you shall should
[1:02:33] show forth the Praises of him who hath
[1:02:37] called
[1:02:39] you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous
[1:02:44] Light which in time past were not a
[1:02:48] people but are now the people of God
[1:02:52] which had not attained mercy and now
[1:02:56] have a tame
[1:02:58] mercy so we instructed her and and uh so
[1:03:03] she woke up from one of these bad dreams
[1:03:06] and she said Jesus Jesus Jesus and she
[1:03:10] said the second Jesus she heard a a deep
[1:03:14] voice and said yes
[1:03:18] wow and she said take away these bad
[1:03:22] dreams and she slept through the night
[1:03:25] prise God thereafter wow
[1:03:28] amen so you know God works on both
[1:03:35] ends
[1:03:36] um and then the last testimony that I'd
[1:03:39] like to give on prayer you know it's all
[1:03:43] these prayers but this is more like
[1:03:45] prayer in action because Jesus prayed
[1:03:48] for us am and so some sometimes you know
[1:03:53] was telling the group chat we everyone
[1:03:56] has a sister's chat and we have a men's
[1:03:58] chat and I said it's not so important to
[1:04:02] try to do something but you need to
[1:04:04] start and if it's a one second do it for
[1:04:08] 10 seconds you need get up into a minute
[1:04:12] get into five minutes and like enjoy
[1:04:15] being content quiet by
[1:04:19] yourself and um and don't and if
[1:04:23] anything start looking on the Affairs of
[1:04:26] others if you have a notepad or
[1:04:29] something write down prayer
[1:04:31] requests and bring those before the Lord
[1:04:34] amen before your own needs because you
[1:04:37] know God is our Shepherd and we shall
[1:04:40] not want we should th those are strength
[1:04:44] kind of scriptures that God says
[1:04:48] we don't have a need necessarily but
[1:04:53] when we have a need then we need to ask
[1:04:55] and like brother Dan was saying knock
[1:04:57] knock I have that um license plate I was
[1:05:01] sitting over there and I was like oh
[1:05:02] that's on my license plate Matthew 6:33
[1:05:06] seek ye the seek ye first the kingdom of
[1:05:09] God the word seek means
[1:05:12] search and his um his riches are
[1:05:18] unsearchable so there's
[1:05:20] nothing nothing great little small
[1:05:23] insignificant all these testimonies are
[1:05:27] little but you know we serve a really
[1:05:29] big God yes amen and when something
[1:05:32] little happens to you and you have a
[1:05:33] little little um little
[1:05:36] praise
[1:05:38] um write it down so when you're in a
[1:05:43] battle or a disturbing thing see what he
[1:05:45] did for you later on in life and it will
[1:05:48] encourage
[1:05:49] you um let's go to um Psalms
[1:05:58] this one this one's a little
[1:06:00] older kind of thing but I um I my my
[1:06:05] wife gets talk to the Lord a lot more
[1:06:08] than I do and so when I'm in trouble I
[1:06:12] asked God to give my my wife a
[1:06:15] scripture because she just she's
[1:06:18] sensitive enough I mean you know we we
[1:06:22] stopped going to um theer a long time
[1:06:26] ago unless it's a really good thing like
[1:06:30] the last thing we watched was chosen in
[1:06:32] the theater it was awesome um
[1:06:37] but even then that was a year or two
[1:06:41] ago um but I ask God to and she she kind
[1:06:46] of gets Restless in the middle of the
[1:06:49] night and and she's is like okay I gotta
[1:06:52] get up God's got me something and she
[1:06:55] throws open her Bible and she starts
[1:06:58] reading and then something hits it hits
[1:07:00] her right there and it's like this is
[1:07:02] what we need
[1:07:05] so um just right before Co hit the news
[1:07:09] and that whole shebang came um God woke
[1:07:14] her up one night and so it was in the
[1:07:18] middle of the night she had the Light
[1:07:20] lamp on downstairs she was reading and
[1:07:24] when she came to these two vers is the
[1:07:26] light went blew
[1:07:29] out and so um it was it was just about
[1:07:33] that time but it says because thou Hast
[1:07:37] made the Lord which is my refuge even
[1:07:40] the most high thy
[1:07:43] habitation there shall no evil be follow
[1:07:45] thee neither shall any plague come nigh
[1:07:49] thy
[1:07:50] dwelling and so at that time we were
[1:07:53] watching 12 13 kids in the house before
[1:07:57] Obama made a law that we only could
[1:07:59] watch
[1:08:00] five um but we
[1:08:03] had and you you've never seen so much
[1:08:08] sickness come through the children when
[1:08:10] they go to school I got lies then we're
[1:08:13] all wondering if we got lies we start
[1:08:16] scratching and stuff like that but you
[1:08:19] know it was just it was just the Lord
[1:08:23] because their parents were all
[1:08:26] um I wouldn't want to say faithless they
[1:08:28] had their own research that they did on
[1:08:30] it and the whole shebang and we have to
[1:08:34] get vaccinated and it's like nothing's
[1:08:38] tested Kennedy fought for the post
[1:08:41] office so we didn't have to be
[1:08:44] vaccinated um it was a big
[1:08:47] thing but um yeah that's that was our
[1:08:50] anchor through Co and um I think I
[1:08:54] shared it actually with with the
[1:08:56] world on Facebook at the time but
[1:09:00] anyways that's all I have for tonight
[1:09:04] may God bless
[1:09:06] [Applause]
[1:09:19] you that was
[1:09:21] great brother just brother um
[1:09:26] Jeremy uh he mentioned kids coming home
[1:09:30] with
[1:09:31] lice and uh I got to share testimony
[1:09:33] this is humbling yourself
[1:09:36] okay we uh things when I was in
[1:09:40] Jeffersonville uh things towards the end
[1:09:43] before I left things began to
[1:09:45] deteriorate a little bit and I'm just as
[1:09:48] far as me and and and my position there
[1:09:51] and uh it wasn't it's I was just as
[1:09:55] fault as as as anybody else and uh I got
[1:09:59] demoted at Still Waters Camp I got
[1:10:03] demoted from the highest office which
[1:10:05] was chaperon I got devoted to checking
[1:10:08] for
[1:10:13] lice I I guess maybe it was because um
[1:10:17] there was no chance of me ever getting
[1:10:20] it so I made the best of it and I became
[1:10:24] the head lice checker
[1:10:28] you get
[1:10:29] it but that was that was the title I
[1:10:32] gave myself I said I'm the headlights
[1:10:33] Checker and you know it was a blessing I
[1:10:36] was able to to help out with the camp
[1:10:40] and then of course I I got to go back to
[1:10:42] chaperon but I got to be able I got to
[1:10:44] help out and and it just it was really
[1:10:46] really good but when you're
[1:10:49] praying humble yourself before the Lord
[1:10:52] be willing to take the lowest position
[1:10:57] and then God well he promised you if you
[1:10:59] will take the
[1:11:01] lowest he that exalts
[1:11:03] himself will be abased but he that
[1:11:07] lowers himself will be exalted it's not
[1:11:11] in our desire it should be in our desire
[1:11:13] to be exalted but we should knowingly
[1:11:18] lower ourselves and take the lowest
[1:11:20] place I um I really appreciate brother
[1:11:23] Jeremy mentioned Luke 22
[1:11:26] verse 31 and and he said that Jesus said
[1:11:29] Peter Satan can you imagine Jesus
[1:11:32] telling you nah Satan has sought
[1:11:38] you can you
[1:11:39] imagine can you imagine some the Lord
[1:11:43] Jesus telling you Lionel Satan has
[1:11:47] sought you Satan is after you and he and
[1:11:51] Jesus said he is after you to sift you
[1:11:55] you like wheat what does that mean when
[1:11:58] wheat they put it in a sifter it has to
[1:12:01] be violently shaken to separate the
[1:12:04] wheat from the chaff the seed from the
[1:12:06] chaff and it is a violent thing that
[1:12:09] that wheat goes through and Jesus says
[1:12:11] Peter the devil has sought to do the
[1:12:14] same thing to you but listen to this but
[1:12:18] I have prayed for you
[1:12:21] Peter Jesus Christ himself I have prayed
[1:12:24] for you imagine the Son of God God
[1:12:28] standing in Flesh on Earth even he
[1:12:34] prayed when he chose his disciples he
[1:12:37] chose his
[1:12:39] 12 Jesus prayed all
[1:12:42] night the night before he chose those
[1:12:45] disciples he wanted to be sure this is
[1:12:47] the Son of God so how much should we
[1:12:49] pray how much should we put these things
[1:12:51] into the hand of the Lord and not seek
[1:12:53] our own but seek what God wants
[1:12:58] amen our brother coming up next brother
[1:13:00] Josiah he's he's been a blessing to us
[1:13:03] all and in singing and and he and sister
[1:13:07] Katie are just two of the most gifted
[1:13:10] people I've ever seen and I am so
[1:13:13] thankful they're they're both what are
[1:13:15] you
[1:13:16] 22 22 years old and doing what they both
[1:13:21] are doing for this church at such a
[1:13:24] young age
[1:13:25] it it needs to be recognized and and how
[1:13:28] much of a blessing that they are to us
[1:13:30] and I wanted to get some youth up here
[1:13:35] and and have brother Jeremy who I know
[1:13:38] is really is loves the Lord with all of
[1:13:40] his heart and and he's always and always
[1:13:43] praying and always in the word and now
[1:13:47] get brother Josiah who is another man of
[1:13:50] God and to see a perspective on this
[1:13:53] topic of prayer that we might not
[1:13:56] normally see as Elders in the church so
[1:14:00] brother Josiah if you would
[1:14:02] come and say what's on your
[1:14:12] heart the closer uh brother Jeremy got
[1:14:16] to being done the faster my heart rate
[1:14:19] got and then brother Daniel's up there
[1:14:21] talking and it's like just talk keep
[1:14:24] going take your time give my heart rate
[1:14:27] a chance to slow
[1:14:29] down um I have the handheld because I
[1:14:32] move a lot not without thinking I just
[1:14:35] move around and that's hard sometimes
[1:14:37] when I pray because I can't sit still so
[1:14:41] I'll go out maybe to sit in the car and
[1:14:43] pray be like okay be still stand out
[1:14:46] here so I can hear from
[1:14:49] God a truck goes by and I'm like oh man
[1:14:53] that's the 73 I've always always wanted
[1:14:55] one of those and I get down this like
[1:14:58] six or seven minute Rabbit Trail in my
[1:15:01] head not even realizing where the time
[1:15:04] went it's all
[1:15:05] gone that's a struggle I have but uh I
[1:15:10] was able to sit down and think about
[1:15:13] this about prayer I've had a uh a few
[1:15:16] words on my heart that NE not not
[1:15:19] necessarily was about
[1:15:21] prayer but um the Lord kind of opened a
[1:15:26] scripture up and I thought it'd be
[1:15:29] really good to share I would like to say
[1:15:31] I think prayer is one of the most
[1:15:35] important things about being a Christian
[1:15:37] because to know the Bible is wonderful
[1:15:41] but there's actually lots of people that
[1:15:43] know the Bible that don't know the Lord
[1:15:47] even even atheists a true atheist a real
[1:15:51] atheist is actually a a master and a and
[1:15:55] wise on all religions he studies all of
[1:15:57] them and decides he doesn't want
[1:15:58] anything to do with any of them but so
[1:16:02] KN knowing the Bible is one thing and we
[1:16:04] must know it but to know God and to talk
[1:16:07] to him personally sets aside the
[1:16:09] Christian from somebody else who just
[1:16:11] reads a book bringing God out of History
[1:16:14] we listen to that message here you can
[1:16:15] bring God out of History by your prayers
[1:16:18] so if you'd put up Matthew
[1:16:22] 16 verse 13
[1:16:27] so praying and realizing that the Lord
[1:16:30] is real he's real in your life he wants
[1:16:33] to help you I think we can agree that's
[1:16:37] that's like the first
[1:16:39] step that you realize God is real and I
[1:16:43] can talk to him so we're going to learn
[1:16:45] about this
[1:16:46] this time when Peter was now I wrote
[1:16:50] down this I think in our circles this is
[1:16:54] probably
[1:16:56] like fifth or sixth most common
[1:16:59] scripture I just thought about it from
[1:17:01] all the churches I've gone to growing up
[1:17:03] all the camp meetings and stuff I've
[1:17:05] been to I've heard this scripture a lot
[1:17:08] um there's one thing I never noticed
[1:17:09] though
[1:17:11] so when Jesus came into the coast of
[1:17:13] cesia Philippi he asked his disciples
[1:17:17] saying whom do men say that I the son of
[1:17:21] man
[1:17:23] am and they said
[1:17:26] some say thou art John the Baptist some
[1:17:29] Elias others jeremias or one of the
[1:17:33] prophets and he saith unto
[1:17:36] them but whom say ye that I
[1:17:41] am whom say ye that I am he's asking
[1:17:45] each and every one of us this too
[1:17:46] because he directed it at this at the
[1:17:48] group and Peter steps up and
[1:17:50] answers but he's asking every single
[1:17:53] person every day who do you say that I
[1:17:56] am with what you do with your life how
[1:17:59] how you spend your
[1:18:01] time what place are you putting him
[1:18:04] in and Simon Peter answered and said
[1:18:06] Thou Art the Christ the son of the
[1:18:09] Living
[1:18:11] God and Jesus answered and said unto
[1:18:14] him blessed art thou Simon barj Jonah
[1:18:19] for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed
[1:18:21] this unto thee but my Father which is in
[1:18:24] heaven
[1:18:26] and I
[1:18:27] say unto thee that thou art Peter and
[1:18:31] Upon This Rock so what he just said you
[1:18:34] are the Christ the son of the Living God
[1:18:35] Jesus said that's a revelation from God
[1:18:38] and upon that I'll build my
[1:18:41] church and the Gates of Hell shall not
[1:18:44] Prevail against it so I've heard it read
[1:18:47] many times you have too the gates of
[1:18:50] hell now we learned in our Wednesday
[1:18:52] night bible studies that the difference
[1:18:55] between a town and a city is that a city
[1:18:59] has a wall around it is that right a
[1:19:03] city has a wall around it and a town is
[1:19:05] just open so when it when it fortifies
[1:19:08] itself builds a wall around then it's a
[1:19:11] city and it says the gates of hell so
[1:19:15] every city had a primary entrance point
[1:19:20] and it would be the gates of that City
[1:19:22] if you wanted to get into the city you
[1:19:24] you had to go through those Gates you
[1:19:26] couldn't the wall was there to protect
[1:19:27] the whole city so it it didn't matter if
[1:19:30] you came with a huge Army you could only
[1:19:33] get so many through at a time so the
[1:19:36] gate was the strongest point in the city
[1:19:38] because they could protect from that
[1:19:40] point do you follow me a huge Army
[1:19:43] couldn't rush into that gate because
[1:19:45] maybe only 10 people wide could get
[1:19:47] through it so then the city was strong
[1:19:50] right there they could put guards there
[1:19:51] and you wouldn't be able to get in so it
[1:19:53] says the Gates of
[1:19:55] Hell will not Prevail against
[1:19:59] it that means that this
[1:20:02] church is an offensive
[1:20:06] church so the Gates of Hell will not be
[1:20:10] able to defend
[1:20:12] it I think this is me speaking my
[1:20:17] testimony I think I pray too much
[1:20:22] defensively only when I'm on the run
[1:20:27] and I I'm I'm going through something
[1:20:29] hard I'm struggling I'm having a really
[1:20:31] hard time and I need I I'm I'm I'm
[1:20:35] running then I turn to God but Jesus
[1:20:38] said on this revelation of who I am I'm
[1:20:41] going to build my
[1:20:43] church and when you
[1:20:45] pray you're actually moving
[1:20:49] forward do you follow that the Gates of
[1:20:53] Hell will not Prevail against against it
[1:20:55] how does the Lord's Prayer
[1:20:57] start our father who are in heaven I can
[1:21:00] imagine Peter many times later in his
[1:21:03] life probably
[1:21:05] said Lord Jesus Christ son of the Living
[1:21:10] God because it was real to him he looked
[1:21:13] to the
[1:21:15] Lord and he knew exactly who he was and
[1:21:19] that is the fundamental part I believe
[1:21:22] the beginning of Christianity
[1:21:25] if I could be so bold to say you can't
[1:21:28] be a Christian without a prayer
[1:21:30] life you can't be a Christian without
[1:21:33] talking to the Lord that's something I
[1:21:35] struggle with because it's
[1:21:38] easier for me to just sing a song
[1:21:41] glorifying God or to read my Bible or to
[1:21:44] read something or to just listen to a
[1:21:46] sermon rather and all those things are
[1:21:48] wonderful and I encourage everyone to do
[1:21:50] all of those things but if you're not
[1:21:52] talking to him anyone can just listen
[1:21:55] anyone can read but you need to be
[1:21:58] talking to the Lord I'll I'll I'll be
[1:22:00] willing to say I struggle with that
[1:22:03] that's something I have a hard time
[1:22:04] doing and then I find myself in these
[1:22:06] defensive situations where I'm running
[1:22:08] away when we're supposed to be the
[1:22:12] church that the Gates of Hell cannot
[1:22:14] Prevail against so we're just moving
[1:22:17] forward and it's so
[1:22:19] amazing it's not it's not this Grand
[1:22:23] dramatic thing
[1:22:25] it's simply getting on your knees Jesus
[1:22:28] said in
[1:22:29] secret and your heavenly father who sees
[1:22:32] you in secret will reward you openly
[1:22:35] it's not it doesn't have to be a huge
[1:22:37] dramatic thing it's so calm and the
[1:22:41] Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it
[1:22:44] it's such a wonderful
[1:22:46] thing what greater thing than to be able
[1:22:49] the one to be able to talk to the one
[1:22:50] who created
[1:22:53] everything I I said bringing God out of
[1:22:55] History you can do that by just getting
[1:22:58] on your knees and talking to him that
[1:23:00] brings him out he's not he's not just
[1:23:03] the one I read about anymore he's not
[1:23:05] just the one I hear about I actually
[1:23:07] talk to him not just about him but I
[1:23:10] talk to
[1:23:12] him and so uh before I go to the the
[1:23:16] next part I'm halfway through and I'm
[1:23:20] eight minutes in we're good the so
[1:23:25] there's a scripture we read in James
[1:23:27] that says the effectual fervent prayer
[1:23:29] of a righteous man availeth
[1:23:31] much who knows the first half of that
[1:23:36] scripture that's the second
[1:23:39] half confess your faults one to
[1:23:43] another and pray for one
[1:23:46] another that ye may be
[1:23:50] healed it's really humbling to be able
[1:23:52] to stand up here and talk about
[1:23:55] prayer because many of you have spent a
[1:24:00] lot longer in your life praying a lot
[1:24:03] longer knowing the Lord and I will say
[1:24:05] again this is something that's been hard
[1:24:07] for me to be able to say I need to lay
[1:24:10] aside this time I'm going to lay aside
[1:24:12] this time to talk to him that's
[1:24:15] something I struggle with I want to say
[1:24:16] that's confessing my fault to you asking
[1:24:19] that you would pray for me and that we
[1:24:21] would pray for each other that we could
[1:24:23] all do better better at
[1:24:26] this so I just wanted to say that before
[1:24:28] I go to the Lord's
[1:24:30] Prayer and I want to talk about two
[1:24:33] parts in the Lord's prayer Our Father
[1:24:36] who art in
[1:24:37] heaven we have these ways of of starting
[1:24:40] a prayer Jesus said after this manner
[1:24:43] pray ye so he didn't say pray exactly
[1:24:47] like this every time he said after this
[1:24:50] manner pray Our Father in heaven and
[1:24:53] what's so great about this prayer is it
[1:24:56] challenges
[1:24:57] you it really puts you to the test if
[1:25:00] you if you really think about some of
[1:25:02] these words and apply them to your
[1:25:04] personal life it's
[1:25:06] challenging it's not
[1:25:08] easy Our Father who art in
[1:25:12] heaven Hallowed Be Your
[1:25:15] Name Your Kingdom
[1:25:18] Come your will be done so you're laying
[1:25:21] down what you
[1:25:22] want give us this day our daily
[1:25:26] bread and forgive
[1:25:29] us as we forgive so it's a
[1:25:33] challenge you know in your heart and I
[1:25:36] know in my heart when I get down there
[1:25:37] to pray and ask for forgiveness Lord am
[1:25:40] I forgiving like I should it's a
[1:25:43] challenge and the Lord is saying this is
[1:25:46] open everyone this is something after
[1:25:49] this manner pray
[1:25:50] ye lead us not into temptation
[1:25:56] now only you know in some cases what
[1:26:00] that
[1:26:01] is but that's really
[1:26:03] vulnerable to say
[1:26:05] Lord lead me not into temptation and you
[1:26:08] know what that thing is Lead Me Not onto
[1:26:11] that
[1:26:13] website lead me
[1:26:15] not to a group of people like that lead
[1:26:19] me not into that kind of music you're
[1:26:21] opening up yourself acknowledging the
[1:26:23] fact Lord Lord I'm weak in this area and
[1:26:26] I can't do it I can't do it without
[1:26:28] you I can't do this without
[1:26:31] you when you get to that
[1:26:35] point when you're a humble
[1:26:37] vessel God can come in and deal with you
[1:26:41] I think the only T the the times where
[1:26:44] the Lord has really spoke to
[1:26:47] me is after I I've tried hard I've tried
[1:26:52] to do it my way for so long and I
[1:26:54] finally just
[1:26:56] sayl I can't do it I have this this this
[1:27:01] this this I can't get
[1:27:02] through and you lay yourself before the
[1:27:05] Lord and he appreciates that humility
[1:27:07] and he's saying right in this prayer
[1:27:09] Lord lead us not into
[1:27:11] temptation like I said everybody knows
[1:27:15] what that is in your own life what that
[1:27:18] temptation is what that what that thing
[1:27:20] is that you need to get through and it
[1:27:22] challenges us to have better faith
[1:27:26] and the best thing about
[1:27:28] following these things the Lord said to
[1:27:31] pray about you know it's his
[1:27:34] will he said after this manner pray ye
[1:27:37] you know you're praying his will because
[1:27:39] it aligns right with his word if you're
[1:27:41] praying Lord I don't want to be led in
[1:27:43] led into temptation that's right in the
[1:27:46] scripture that's right out of the Bible
[1:27:49] if you're praying Lord may your kingdom
[1:27:52] come that right in his will that's right
[1:27:56] what he
[1:27:57] wants give us this day our daily bread
[1:28:00] he wants
[1:28:02] to he wants to do that for you Lord
[1:28:04] forgive us he wants to forgive
[1:28:07] us and he wants us to forgive one
[1:28:10] another and that's the that's a
[1:28:12] challenge right there Lord help me to
[1:28:15] forgive better because I want to be
[1:28:17] forgiven by you as
[1:28:19] well for thine let's say it together is
[1:28:23] the kingdom
[1:28:25] the power the glory
[1:28:28] forever amen healing is his will it's in
[1:28:33] the
[1:28:34] word salvation is his will salvation for
[1:28:37] others salvation for your own heart to
[1:28:40] receive the Holy Ghost is his will for
[1:28:43] others for
[1:28:45] yourself peace Joy love these are all
[1:28:47] things he wants you to
[1:28:50] have and I pray that
[1:28:54] we as a
[1:28:57] church can be a church that lifts up our
[1:29:01] city the needs here in
[1:29:03] Tucson I pray that we
[1:29:06] wouldn't speaking to my myself also we
[1:29:09] wouldn't always just look inwardly but
[1:29:11] we look outward
[1:29:13] Lord how can we help how can we do more
[1:29:16] for others how can we lead people to you
[1:29:19] it's your will Lord It's Your Will to
[1:29:22] bring to bring people to you how can we
[1:29:23] do better better at that thank you for
[1:29:26] listening God bless
[1:29:29] [Applause]
[1:29:34] you yes amen we don't always have to be
[1:29:38] defensive as Christians you know we all
[1:29:41] I like what brother Josiah said he says
[1:29:43] we're always in the defensive mode Lord
[1:29:46] protect Lord Lord get get me out of this
[1:29:49] out of this mess Lord help my son that's
[1:29:52] that's in that's struggling or help my
[1:29:54] daughter that's
[1:29:56] this you can go after the devil I was I
[1:29:59] was thinking as brother Josiah was
[1:30:02] speaking James 4:7 says submit
[1:30:04] yourselves therefore to God resist the
[1:30:08] devil how do you submit yourselves
[1:30:10] before God you pray that's what I talked
[1:30:13] about in Romans chapter 8 Lord your will
[1:30:16] be done Lord what is you what do you
[1:30:19] want submit yourselves give yourself up
[1:30:23] to God
[1:30:25] and resist the devil and you know what
[1:30:26] it says next and he will flee from you
[1:30:31] that's offensive not defensive the devil
[1:30:34] starts running away when you get down
[1:30:37] and you really pray and you really
[1:30:39] submit yourself to God then the devil
[1:30:42] takes off and he he's he's he's he's
[1:30:45] running like a scared rabbit then
[1:30:48] William
[1:30:49] cper as brother Josiah was talking
[1:30:52] William cper said this he said Satan
[1:30:55] trembles when he sees the weakest of
[1:30:57] Sinners go to his
[1:30:59] knees that's beautiful it's so so true I
[1:31:04] have a few minutes left and if it's okay
[1:31:07] I would like to read I was praying
[1:31:10] before
[1:31:11] service and I I said Lord do you want me
[1:31:15] to say anything should I should we just
[1:31:19] sing songs should and have brother
[1:31:22] Josiah and brother Jeremy speak and I
[1:31:25] think that now I was a little bit
[1:31:28] worried but I think 15 minutes now it
[1:31:30] should be a
[1:31:31] minimum and and not maybe a maximum
[1:31:34] maybe 15 to 20 minutes um because I
[1:31:37] really I thought both of them could have
[1:31:39] kept going and I really enjoyed both of
[1:31:41] them so we will continue on with at
[1:31:44] least 15 minutes now as I was
[1:31:48] praying I was saying
[1:31:50] Lord what do you what do you want what
[1:31:54] what can I say to the church do you want
[1:31:57] me to say
[1:31:58] anything and I said if you do Lord let
[1:32:02] me just let me open up my
[1:32:04] Bible and uh maybe give me something now
[1:32:08] how many times have I said the same
[1:32:10] thing and I opened up my Bible and it's
[1:32:12] like okay Lord I must have turned to the
[1:32:15] wrong page let me try that
[1:32:18] again oh no you know God's perfected in
[1:32:21] threes let me let me do that again and
[1:32:22] then and eventually you're going to get
[1:32:24] something that meets exactly what you
[1:32:26] what you want I don't believe that the
[1:32:28] Bible should be something like as
[1:32:31] brother brandom said a Ouija
[1:32:33] board um I do I do have a um quote um
[1:32:38] brother the Michael sent me this it's
[1:32:41] it's really beautiful it says that the
[1:32:44] power prayer is the most powerful weapon
[1:32:46] that was ever put into the control of
[1:32:47] the human being there's no atomic bomb
[1:32:50] there's no hydrogen bomb as powerful as
[1:32:52] prayer Pray prayer will change the mind
[1:32:55] of God did you know
[1:32:57] that it did it did it one time and
[1:33:02] that's the time that we know the story
[1:33:03] about Hezekiah when God said that you're
[1:33:06] going to die to make things ready and he
[1:33:07] said Lord I I need I need some more time
[1:33:09] on Earth then the prophet came back and
[1:33:12] told them but I really feel as if the
[1:33:17] Lord laid on my heart when I open my
[1:33:19] bible this time to Isaiah chter 55 and I
[1:33:24] just really I just want to read the word
[1:33:26] Isaiah chapter 55 and we'll read we'll
[1:33:29] read the whole
[1:33:31] scripture it says
[1:33:33] this Isaiah
[1:33:36] 551 listen how beautiful this is when
[1:33:39] we're praying and how perfectly this
[1:33:42] scripture lines
[1:33:43] up oh everyone that thirsteth Come Ye to
[1:33:47] the
[1:33:49] waters and he that hath no money Come Ye
[1:33:53] and buy
[1:33:54] if you have no money how can you buy but
[1:33:57] he says you come here no matter what you
[1:33:59] have no matter how down you are no
[1:34:01] matter what you've done you come and you
[1:34:04] buy you come if you're thirsting come to
[1:34:06] these
[1:34:07] Waters yay come by wine and milk without
[1:34:11] money and without price wherefore do you
[1:34:13] spend money for that which is not bread
[1:34:16] and your labor for that which satisfieth
[1:34:19] not hearken diligently unto me and ye
[1:34:22] that which and ye and eat ye that which
[1:34:26] is good and let your soul Delight itself
[1:34:29] in fatness he wants us to be happy
[1:34:31] brothers and sisters he doesn't want us
[1:34:33] to always be suffering like brother
[1:34:35] Josiah said don't always be defensive
[1:34:37] get on your knees and say Lord I want to
[1:34:40] go after the enemy I want to submit
[1:34:42] myself to you you don't have to always
[1:34:44] be sad so often Christians think oh me
[1:34:49] we live in this world and it's so hard
[1:34:51] yeah we live in this world and it is so
[1:34:53] hard but we've got a purpose here and
[1:34:55] we've got a living God that is with
[1:35:01] us incline your ear and come unto me
[1:35:05] hear and your soul shall live and I will
[1:35:07] make an Everlasting Covenant with you

[1:35:14] have given him for a witness to the
[1:35:16] people a leader and a commander to the
[1:35:18] people behold Thou shalt call a nation

[1:35:29] Lord thy God and for the Holy One of
[1:35:31] Israel for he hath glorified
[1:35:34] thee I'll put that into today the world

[1:36:00] ye upon him while he is
[1:36:03] near what a statement seek ye the Lord
[1:36:07] while he may be found that means there's
[1:36:10] one day that he won't be found there's
[1:36:12] one day that you'll call on him not you
[1:36:15] there's one day that people will call on
[1:36:17] him and he won't be there to answer but
[1:36:20] he says seek ye the Lord while he may be
[1:36:22] found call upon call ye upon him while
[1:36:25] he is near let the wicked forsake his
[1:36:27] way and the unrighteous man his thoughts
[1:36:30] and let him return unto the Lord what
[1:36:32] we've been preaching return unto the
[1:36:34] Lord and He will have mercy upon him and
[1:36:38] to our God for he will abundantly pardon
[1:36:43] oh remember I said this morning no Satan
[1:36:47] I got a signed email here I got a signed
[1:36:51] letter that this is not not me that I am
[1:36:57] justified for he will abundantly pardon
[1:37:00] only through Jesus Christ can he pardon
[1:37:03] for my thoughts are not your thoughts
[1:37:05] neither are your ways my ways sayeth the
[1:37:07] Lord one of my favorite scriptures we
[1:37:10] don't understand why things happen why
[1:37:12] why is this doing this why why do we
[1:37:14] have to why do I have to go through all
[1:37:15] this he says listen he says my ways are
[1:37:17] not your
[1:37:18] ways he said that my thoughts are not
[1:37:22] your thoughts just trust me for as the
[1:37:25] heaven Heavens are higher than the earth
[1:37:27] so are my ways higher than your ways and
[1:37:30] my thoughts higher and my thoughts than
[1:37:32] your thoughts I love that part for as
[1:37:35] the rain cometh down and the snow from
[1:37:37] heaven and returneth not hither but WTH
[1:37:41] the Earth and make it make it bring
[1:37:43] forth and Bud that it may give seed to
[1:37:46] the S and bread to the eater so shall my
[1:37:51] word be that
[1:37:54] goeth forth out of out of my mouth it
[1:37:57] shall not return unto me
[1:38:00] void but it shall accomplish that which
[1:38:03] I please and it shall prosper in the
[1:38:07] thing where to I centered I tell brother
[1:38:09] Aaron had that one
[1:38:11] memorized that's very very much a
[1:38:14] comfort to me that I try to minister
[1:38:18] this and and I try to read this even
[1:38:20] this very chapter that I'm reading right
[1:38:23] right now it's going upon our ears and
[1:38:27] God said it will not return to me void
[1:38:31] but it will accomplish that where with i
[1:38:34] that thing with for the reason I sent
[1:38:37] it for ye shall go out with joy and be
[1:38:42] led forth with peace the mountains and
[1:38:45] the hills shall Break Forth before you
[1:38:48] into singing and all the trees of the
[1:38:50] field shall clap their hands instead of
[1:38:53] of the
[1:38:54] thorn shall come up the fur tree and
[1:38:57] instead of the Brier shall come up the
[1:38:59] Myrtle tree and it shall be to the Lord
[1:39:03] for a name for an everlasting sign that
[1:39:07] shall not be cut off brother Michael and
[1:39:10] the musicians could
[1:39:13] come for ye shall go out with joy and be
[1:39:16] led forth with peace and the mountains
[1:39:18] and the hills shall Break Forth before
[1:39:21] you into singing and all the trees of
[1:39:23] the field shall clap their hands that's
[1:39:25] a joyous time that's a time that we look
[1:39:29] forward to that there's not going to be
[1:39:30] any sin there's not going to be any
[1:39:31] sickness not going to be any dying
[1:39:33] there's just going to be all joy and all
[1:39:35] happiness and brothers and sisters what
[1:39:37] I said about a a Christian being sad and
[1:39:40] down all the
[1:39:41] time why would you be sad and down if
[1:39:45] you have that hope right there so this
[1:39:49] chapter that I read out of Isaiah
[1:39:53] it shall not return unto me void but it
[1:39:56] shall accomplish that which I I please
[1:39:59] and it shall prosper in the thing where
[1:40:02] to I sent it even that very scripture
[1:40:05] it's going to be a joyously time joyous
[1:40:08] time it's going to be a happy time and a
[1:40:10] Christian no matter how bad things get a
[1:40:12] Christian always looks forward to that
[1:40:14] time and we can get on our knees and it
[1:40:16] may be the worst time in your life but
[1:40:19] you can get on your knees and you can
[1:40:21] thank God you can thank God for this
[1:40:24] time that you're going through and you
[1:40:26] can thank God for his promise because
[1:40:27] it's if God if I promise it there's a
[1:40:31] chance it won't happen but if God
[1:40:33] promises it it will happen and we can we
[1:40:37] can take joy and we can thank God just
[1:40:40] as if we have it now amen let's all

[1:44:56] Jordan I want you to close in prayer
[1:44:58] [Music]
[1:44:59] also the Apostle
[1:45:01] John the Bel beloved disciple laid his
[1:45:05] head on Jesus's bosom his different his
[1:45:08] gospel is different than the other three
[1:45:12] his gospel is completely and solely
[1:45:15] dedicated to the deity of Jesus Christ
[1:45:18] listen to what this man says when he
[1:45:20] quotes the Lord
[1:45:24] Jesus says
[1:45:26] this in St John chap 14 verse
[1:45:30] 13 and whatsoever you shall ask in my
[1:45:35] name that will I do that the father may
[1:45:39] be glorified in the
[1:45:41] son and he repeats
[1:45:44] himself if there might have been a
[1:45:46] question upon the the minds of those
[1:45:49] that were
[1:45:50] listening he says this
[1:45:53] [Music]
[1:45:54] if you shall ask anything in my name I
[1:45:59] will do it and if you love me keep my
[1:46:03] Commandments What a promise what a
[1:46:06] promise of prayer that if you ask
[1:46:08] anything in my name and it will glorify
[1:46:11] the father through me you can have what
[1:46:14] you ask for do you believe in prayer I
[1:46:18] don't think that we believe enough in
[1:46:20] prayer do you really believe that you
[1:46:22] are a son or a daughter or a daughter or
[1:46:25] a child of God if you do this scripture
[1:46:28] is for you and in Isaiah I just read
[1:46:30] that this scripture these words will not
[1:46:34] return to God void but they will
[1:46:36] accomplish that which they which they
[1:46:38] were intended
[1:46:39] for I'll read it again brother Jordan if
[1:46:41] you come and whatsoever you ask in my
[1:46:43] name that will I do that the father may
[1:46:46] be glorified in the sun if ye shall ask
[1:46:49] anything in my name I will do it I love
[1:46:52] that
[1:46:54] amen one more
[1:46:59] time shout Jesus from the
[1:47:03] mountains Jesus in the
[1:47:07] streams Jesus in the darkness over every
[1:47:14] enemy Jesus for my family I speak the
[1:47:19] Holy
[1:47:21] Name Jesus
[1:47:27] Jesus your name is
[1:47:30] power your name is
[1:47:34] healing your name is
[1:47:41] life break every
[1:47:44] stronghold shine through the
[1:47:48] Shadows burn like fire
[1:47:57] back there I felt like brother Daniel
[1:47:58] was going to call me up and I looked at
[1:48:01] this scripture because it was sort of on
[1:48:03] my heart and there's three times I think
[1:48:06] I maybe shared this a little bit with
[1:48:08] the church years ago but I thought about
[1:48:10] three different times to
[1:48:13] pray and just kind of what I felt like
[1:48:15] the scripture kind of gave us examples
[1:48:17] of these three different times and the
[1:48:19] first is in Mark
[1:48:21] 14 37 and
[1:48:23] 38 this is Jesus in The Garden of GE
[1:48:26] Gethsemane and he cometh and findeth
[1:48:28] them sleeping and saith unto Peter Simon
[1:48:31] sleepest thou couldest not thou watch
[1:48:33] one hour watch ye and pray lest you
[1:48:35] enter into temptation the spirit truly
[1:48:38] is ready but the flesh is weak and you
[1:48:40] see these examples through scripture
[1:48:42] where Christ will pray go alone and pray
[1:48:44] for an hour or more and I've always felt
[1:48:47] like that's just that one ton of time to
[1:48:49] pray where you just dedicate that hour
[1:48:51] or more and just really seek the Lord
[1:48:54] the second time or the second type of
[1:48:56] time to pray I felt like is in Daniel 6
[1:49:00] verse 10 through 12 it says now when
[1:49:03] Daniel knew that the writing was signed
[1:49:05] he went into his house and his windows
[1:49:06] being open in his chamber toward
[1:49:08] Jerusalem he kneeled upon his knees
[1:49:10] three times a day and prayed and gave
[1:49:12] thanks before his God as he did a four
[1:49:15] time then these men assembled and found
[1:49:17] Daniel praying and making supplication
[1:49:19] before his God then they came near and
[1:49:21] spake before the king concerning the
[1:49:23] king's
[1:49:24] decree and it goes on but he took that
[1:49:27] time three times a day to pray when I
[1:49:29] was in Dubai it was very striking where
[1:49:32] they had all the speakers set up or five
[1:49:34] times a day they would stop and pray I
[1:49:38] mean talk about the
[1:49:40] dedication and the last the last time I
[1:49:43] feel like in the scripture tells us
[1:49:44] about praying is in Thessalonians
[1:49:47] 5:17 1 Thessalonians 5:17 says pray
[1:49:51] without ceasing so just kind of these
[1:49:53] three examples praying for an hour
[1:49:55] praying three times a day maybe there
[1:49:57] that might be a little shorter maybe
[1:49:58] that's when we pray for our meals but
[1:50:00] then we just have that heart where we're
[1:50:02] just always in a mind of prayer let's
[1:50:04] pray this evening Heavenly Father you
[1:50:08] know that prayer is probably one of my
[1:50:09] favorite subjects Lord Lord where we can
[1:50:12] talk to you our great Creator yes Lord
[1:50:15] we hear these Miracles and Supernatural
[1:50:18] things Lord
[1:50:19] and we hear what brother brandham says
[1:50:21] about prayer being
[1:50:23] powerful weapon Lord and it's really
[1:50:25] just a connection that us as mortal
[1:50:28] human beings have with you Lord and all
[1:50:31] these other things while they are
[1:50:33] wonderful and great lord it's nothing
[1:50:36] like talking with you and hearing from
[1:50:38] you
[1:50:39] lord lord just help us Lord
[1:50:42] to take
[1:50:44] and rededicate our lives to you in a way
[1:50:48] of prayer Lord that would be pleasing
[1:50:50] and acceptable to you Lord and
[1:50:53] may we just have more Zeal to talk to
[1:50:56] you every day in our Our Lives
[1:50:59] Lord forgive us for where we've fallen
[1:51:01] short Lord and not done what we should
[1:51:04] Lord but just help us Lord strengthen us
[1:51:07] according to your word
[1:51:09] Lord Lord help each one that's come this
[1:51:12] evening Lord and keep us all Lord this
[1:51:14] week Lord give us a good week Lord
[1:51:20] blessings Lord Lord trial and
[1:51:22] temptations I'm sure will come to most
[1:51:24] of us Lord but would you just be there
[1:51:26] to protect us to lead us and help us
[1:51:28] through each one
[1:51:30] Lord thank you for your blessings in our
[1:51:32] lives Lord

[1:51:36] for us Lord we love

[1:53:30] f brothers and sisters I'm sorry I I
[1:53:33] forgot
[1:53:35] something and we are going to get a
[1:53:37] [Music]
[1:53:39] chance once
[1:53:41] again to pray brother Jordan sent out a
[1:53:46] prayer request last night for our dear
[1:53:48] friend loyal servant of this church
[1:53:51] brother Kevin Cary
[1:53:53] he said he's not feeling well he went to
[1:53:55] the doctor and they say he has
[1:53:58] bronchitis and he says thank you for
[1:54:00] your prayers so let's continue to pray
[1:54:02] for our brother Kevin he's he's been a
[1:54:05] blessing to this church and he's always
[1:54:07] working so hard back in the back so when
[1:54:09] you pray tonight pray for brother Kevin
[1:54:13] and when I was closing if you'll notice
[1:54:16] me I don't know if you've ever noticed I
[1:54:18] almost never will ask one of the
[1:54:20] officials in the church to close was in
[1:54:23] prayer but when I was when I was closing
[1:54:26] I was looking brother Jordan was gone
[1:54:29] and something ins inside of me said just
[1:54:31] wait a little bit and have brother
[1:54:34] Jordan close and he wasn't he wasn't
[1:54:36] back there and we sang another verse and
[1:54:39] then our brother came
