[8:41] God bless you all nobody get up and
[8:43] leave I'm not leading songs
[8:47] tonight I want to give a report a
[8:49] financial report before we get started I
[8:52] that it was funny we're just back there
[8:54] brother Aaron's been trying to get me
[8:55] the lead songs all week and uh he keeps
[8:59] sing me texts and
[9:01] U then uh brother Josiah just just said
[9:05] he said you know he said if you lead
[9:09] songs he said then they'll appreciate
[9:11] what we do
[9:13] more thanks
[9:17] buddy
[9:19] um so what I'm going to do right now is
[9:21] I'm gonna give a financial report in our
[9:24] bylaws we say that uh we give the report
[9:28] at the first of April of every month
[9:30] that's why I made the announcement I had
[9:32] just I make the announcement last week
[9:34] that um we will give the financial
[9:36] report and from now on we will make this
[9:38] report at the end of March we will make
[9:41] it on the last probably Wednesday in
[9:45] March from this point
[9:47] on so what I wanted to do is tell the
[9:51] church here are the total
[9:54] expenses and then here is the total
[9:57] income special thanks to sister sister
[10:00] Rachel for working so hard on the books
[10:02] and um saving us so much money and uh
[10:06] all the effort I I know I complain when
[10:09] I have to do my taxes I can imagine how
[10:11] much it is to keep track of all the
[10:14] expenses of this church and we have
[10:15] quite a few more than you might think
[10:19] for the
[10:20] ministry the ministry
[10:22] includes um it includes the ministers
[10:27] Hospitality which means that whenever
[10:29] someone comes in we will give them an
[10:33] offering and then a lot of times we'll
[10:35] take them out to eat we'll put them up
[10:37] for the night or two nights or however
[10:39] long that they're staying um that's
[10:43] includes any missionary offerings that
[10:44] we give that includes any type of salary
[10:47] that I get or any of our brothers here
[10:51] that Minister here any um offerings that
[10:54] they get and like I said any visiting
[10:57] ministers so this is a a big expens for
[10:59] the church the church spent
[11:02] $85,000 last year on the
[11:06] ministry the next one is our Outreach
[11:08] and benevolences which is the fellowship
[11:11] hall supplies food for the church
[11:13] dinners special meetings Mother's Day
[11:16] gifts um money given to those in need
[11:20] which is a big expense and gifts to
[11:23] maybe in bereavement uh someone that is
[11:27] um struggling maybe to pay their Funeral
[11:31] for a loved one um and that also in
[11:35] their uh any type of Outreach materials
[11:39] which is Bibles and that um those
[11:42] supplies we spent
[11:44] $440,000 on that last year any special
[11:48] events which includes last year included
[11:51] Harmony um and included our family camp
[11:55] we went to I took um a group to Phoenix
[11:57] for special meetings last
[12:00] year um that was
[12:03] $21,000 you wonder why it's important
[12:07] brothers and sisters to take up an
[12:10] offering and I know that our example is
[12:14] brother brandom and the way that he did
[12:16] things and he said that giving and
[12:21] passing the plate was part of
[12:24] worship and he said uh they tried to get
[12:26] brother brandom to pull on the people
[12:28] for money and brother brandham he made
[12:30] this statement he says no he says just
[12:33] Pass the Plate he says that's all we do
[12:36] and brother brandham as you know he
[12:37] never got into money problems he was
[12:39] always on the level the lord always
[12:41] provided just as much as he needed so in
[12:45] these special events and um special
[12:49] services that's why we usually take up
[12:51] an offering is to pay because they do we
[12:54] do incur a lot of expenses in doing that
[12:58] administrative well for the Youth um
[13:01] that is food when we buy food for
[13:03] upstairs for the Youth if we um have any
[13:05] type of a youth Gathering and um any
[13:08] type of supplies that we buy that was
[13:11] $6,000 last year administrative fees
[13:14] which is Paypal fees and the fees that
[13:16] the church pays if you um make your
[13:19] donations online they're small but uh
[13:22] it's still um is um the church still
[13:26] pays fees for that um the
[13:29] phone hookup um the videos postage
[13:34] telephone internet um we installed a new
[13:38] phone system this year or last year
[13:42] piano tuning copyright and Licensing
[13:48] $177,000 the church
[13:50] property that's Insurance repairs
[13:53] maintenance um any type of if we do a
[13:56] special cleaning if we have someone come
[13:58] in and and do um any type of special
[14:02] work the new parking lot that we put in
[14:05] when we resealed it utilities and then
[14:08] um any type of Renovations like we did
[14:10] for the the room outside
[14:14] $13,000 we spent on the on the church
[14:17] building last
[14:19] year and then we also have the church
[14:21] has two properties um that it owns and
[14:26] uh if the Lord's willing we are going to
[14:29] sell one of those at least one of those
[14:32] and we spent $99,000 last year on those
[14:35] properties which is a very very small
[14:37] amount um considering that they're the
[14:40] full properties um we have uh some big
[14:45] expenses coming up this next year but
[14:47] all of that totals up the total expenses
[14:50] is $
[14:52] 28,749
[14:54] that were expenses for the church and as
[14:58] I looked at had it and went over it we
[14:59] didn't have any big expenses really last
[15:02] year so that is going to go up a lot
[15:07] this year because of our Renovations
[15:10] over in this room over here and then if
[15:13] the Lord's willing in renovating this um
[15:16] this area here I've asked them uh the
[15:19] trustees to let's please do our best to
[15:22] stay under
[15:24] $200,000 for all of our Renovations and
[15:27] everything that we're doing and I know
[15:28] brother has taking the lead there he's
[15:29] doing a very very good job he's pinching
[15:31] every penny that we can but we also we
[15:34] don't want to sacrifice quality for um
[15:38] low prices and we're doing our best
[15:42] to do the make a nice renovation for the
[15:45] church so as I said we spent $
[15:49] 28,730
[15:51] $774 last
[15:53] year and here's a
[15:57] miracle we took in
[16:05] [Applause]
[16:12] $336,600
[16:14] um I think I've already spent it on on
[16:19] over here and uh like I said we're going
[16:21] to incur some pretty big expenses this
[16:24] next year and if the Lord's willing to
[16:27] pay for the these expenses that we're
[16:30] going to incur in all of these new
[16:33] Renovations um praying about it and
[16:36] we're moving forward and selling the one
[16:38] property that we have down the street
[16:39] here to pay for um our uh church and I'm
[16:46] just I'm thankful brothers and sisters
[16:48] it is a great honor for us to give it's
[16:52] a great honor that we have a place to
[16:54] pay our ties and that we have a place to
[16:56] give extra offerings and what's so
[17:00] great about
[17:02] giving is seeing results from giving you
[17:07] don't want to just give to your church
[17:09] and then it just goes away and you don't
[17:11] see any results you don't see any
[17:14] progress but as we're going to hear
[17:16] tonight when our brother Josiah talks
[17:17] about the book of Ezra these there were
[17:20] great Renovations going on in the temple
[17:23] and that money had to come from
[17:26] somewhere that money just didn't show up
[17:29] it was given freely by the people and it
[17:32] was it was given so that they might have
[17:36] a place to worship that the Lord would
[17:38] be welcome as he descended on on the
[17:43] people and uh that's what we're working
[17:45] towards today and and I tell you the
[17:47] truth as I studied on the book of Ezra
[17:49] over over the past little
[17:52] while it's really amazing that we are
[17:56] going through what we're going through
[17:59] now and we are going into this book
[18:03] right now this book of Ezra it's they
[18:07] were doing the exact same thing we are
[18:11] they were rebuilding a temple that had
[18:14] been built and beautiful and it was
[18:16] wonderful but it was time to rebuild it
[18:20] and that's what they were doing in this
[18:21] book of
[18:22] Ezra so to give a little background
[18:24] before we start before we start our
[18:27] worship the book of Ezra is the
[18:30] beginning of What's called the second
[18:32] temple period the first temple we just
[18:35] went through first and 2 Kings and 1 and
[18:38] 2 Chronicles how Solomon built this
[18:41] Temple for the Lord and then the Lord
[18:44] blessed them and then it after a while
[18:47] the temple got worn down and and
[18:50] Nebuchadnezzar comes in and he steals
[18:54] the people away now this book of Ezra
[18:58] comes right here at the end when they
[19:01] come back to Jerusalem and they're able
[19:04] to leave and brother Josiah will give us
[19:07] an explanation of that so brothers and
[19:09] sisters if you have any
[19:12] questions on any of the finances feel
[19:15] free to reach out to me and ask me I'd
[19:17] be happy to answer any questions that
[19:19] you have and once again I want to thank
[19:21] everyone for their generosity for their
[19:24] love for this church and how that we're
[19:27] we're moving forward forward and we are
[19:29] able to spend some money and make some
[19:33] changes that uh I think all of us are
[19:35] going to benefit from God bless you all
[19:37] brother
[19:43] Aon hey man brother Dan had asked me
[19:47] before I came out if I had any
[19:49] idea and I think uh if we could run with
[19:52] my budget be a lot
[19:53] cheaper I said
[19:56] 40,000 I had no idea
[19:59] but you know God can meet a million I he
[20:02] can meet one so appreciate let's stand

[38:49] Bible so in that book you have an Old
[38:52] Testament and a new testament you have
[38:54] an Old Testament thank Ezra that's right
[38:58] so this is a significant character in
[39:00] The Bible Ezra is a big
[39:03] deal and he doesn't get enough respect
[39:06] as I and my dad have said many times
[39:07] Ezra doesn't get enough respect let's
[39:09] just sing that chorus cuz God's word and
[39:12] God's truth is marching on and I think

[40:58] thank you musicians appreciate you let's
[41:01] have a word of
[41:03] prayer dear Lord Jesus thank you so much
[41:06] for letting us be here tonight thank you
[41:08] for this
[41:09] building there's a lot of work that's
[41:11] going to be going on to make this place
[41:15] as as best as we can make it lord it's
[41:17] just all about you it's all about
[41:19] worshiping you you've blessed us you've
[41:21] done so much good and I believe there's
[41:23] going to be more good
[41:25] Lord but if you're not pleased Lord it
[41:28] doesn't
[41:29] matter I pray that we would learn some
[41:33] lessons from this book we're going to be
[41:34] reading tonight and that it would impact
[41:38] us Lord Jesus I pray this this simple
[41:41] little presentation would help
[41:44] somebody love you Lord and we just
[41:46] commit it all into your hands For Your
[41:48] Glory in Jesus name amen you can all
[41:51] have your
[41:54] seats the story contained in EZ ER ra
[41:57] has been told many
[42:00] times so God has a bar or a golden
[42:05] standard and humans fall from that so
[42:08] we've we've been studying the Bible you
[42:10] see that God has a standard a uh
[42:15] something and humans fall from that and
[42:18] then what happens then God takes a
[42:20] flawed man and he uses that man that
[42:24] vessel to restore I guess the that gold
[42:28] standard and it's a and it's a common
[42:30] story and it always we learn one thing
[42:33] from it that without
[42:36] God it's over you know we're nothing we
[42:39] can't do anything without God and the
[42:41] sooner we understand that that we can't
[42:45] do anything without God the sooner we
[42:47] can just run to Jesus
[42:50] now and we don't have to we don't have
[42:53] to do that cycle so if we just if we
[42:56] just realize we're not going to do it by
[42:58] ourselves we won't be okay alone let's
[43:01] just go to God now let's just rely on
[43:04] him now let's trust in him now then it
[43:07] would turn out a lot
[43:08] better the grace of God brother Aaron
[43:11] was talking earlier and some of the
[43:12] chapters we're going to read tonight are
[43:14] terrible awful and you just wonder how
[43:17] did God love these people how did and
[43:19] then you think how did how does he love
[43:20] me how does he love me so you see up
[43:24] there Ezra and you see a picture of a
[43:26] temple because as brother Daniel said
[43:29] Ezra rebuilt the Temple of the Lord the
[43:32] second time so Ezra and all the children
[43:36] of Israel are captive in Babylon they
[43:38] come back and they rebuild and I have a
[43:41] scripture there
[43:43] Ezra and it says for Ezra had prepared
[43:46] his heart to seek the law of the Lord
[43:49] and to do it and to teach in Israel
[43:53] statutes and judgments so Ezra is a big
[43:56] part with zerubabel and rebuilding the
[43:58] temple but Ezra his heart is for the
[44:01] word he wants to get the word back into
[44:04] the hands of the
[44:06] people and um I want to make the word
[44:10] clear to you tonight I hope I can do a
[44:12] good job brother Daniel or brother Lyall
[44:14] would do a lot better I just kind of
[44:16] piece together this little PowerPoint
[44:19] really to help me honestly it's you know
[44:23] it'll hopefully help you but it's really
[44:25] to help me stay on track so if we go to
[44:28] the next slide so what's the book about
[44:31] uh it's in two parts so part one you get
[44:34] a decree from Cyrus and I'm going to
[44:36] introduce all these characters to you
[44:38] they all have very very cool stories
[44:41] part one uh is a decree from the
[44:45] king
[44:46] and the second half of the book is the
[44:49] ministry of Ezra so it's broken up it's
[44:51] divided into two sections like that and
[44:53] the book spans about 80 years and Ezra
[44:56] and neem IAH the next book are wrote
[44:59] actually has two books or one book
[45:01] originally it's two books but it was
[45:04] originally one so it's hard to not read
[45:07] out of Nehemiah for this I tried to
[45:09] avoid that because I think brother
[45:10] Daniel is going to do Nehemiah but
[45:13] they're written as one
[45:14] book so who is
[45:17] Ezra Ezra followed and restored the law
[45:20] and
[45:21] ritual he's not a prophet that's a
[45:24] that's a that's a key thing Ezra and
[45:26] Nehemiah were not prophets they
[45:29] accomplished such great things and they
[45:31] didn't have Angel visitations and and
[45:34] visions and they were just normal people
[45:37] so a priest this would be like Ezra's a
[45:40] priest like like brother Daniel or a
[45:42] minister just a regular guy with a
[45:46] vision I think that's yeah a man with a
[45:48] vision that's Ezra he doesn't get enough
[45:50] respect I'm going to say that throughout
[45:52] so he's such a big deal to the Jews as
[45:55] you see up there there are Jews that say
[45:58] if the law of Moses had not come to
[46:01] Moses it would have come to Ezra that is
[46:04] a saying I don't know if you've ever
[46:06] heard that brother Lyall but there are
[46:07] Jews that that that say that if it
[46:10] hadn't come to Moses it would have come
[46:11] to Ezra he's so he's so highly respected
[46:14] to the Jews and we don't you know we
[46:16] know very little about
[46:25] him so here we're going to I'm going to
[46:28] introduce some of these other important
[46:29] characters so Nehemiah I talked to you
[46:32] about Nehemiah that wrote is the same
[46:34] book so Ezra restored the word and this
[46:37] guy zerubabel really heads on rebuilding
[46:40] the temple Nehemiah helped rebuild the
[46:44] city and rebuild the wall around the
[46:47] city Zechariah and hegi the prophets as
[46:50] we know them we're going to run into
[46:52] them this study Cyrus I have him
[46:55] highlighted because I love Cyrus I have
[46:58] a funny story hopefully you know some
[47:02] all not all of this will be boring
[47:04] there's a really funny story with Cyrus
[47:07] and then Malachi is actually not
[47:09] referred to in the book of Ezra but he's
[47:11] contemporary on all this the three
[47:13] prophets Zachariah hegi Malachi are all
[47:16] in this era and Malachi has a very big
[47:19] deal a very uh significant part at the
[47:21] end of this and we'll read some of
[47:24] Malachi after and you'll know why
[47:28] so Israel is in the Exile they were
[47:32] taken away for 70 years it was
[47:34] prophesied by Jeremiah I have all these
[47:36] scriptures and I'm not going to read all
[47:38] of them but if you want to like take a
[47:39] picture or write those down those are
[47:41] really good scriptures I'm going to read
[47:43] the first one which is Jeremiah and this
[47:46] is the NIV I have up here I'm going to
[47:48] read from the King James though it's
[47:50] basically where God prophesies that he's
[47:53] going to take Israel out um um and give
[47:57] them to the king of Babylon so it's
[48:00] Jeremiah
[48:03] 25 verse 9 and Jeremiah's prophesying
[48:08] behold I will send and take all the
[48:09] families of the north sayith the Lord
[48:11] and Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon
[48:14] my servant isn't that interesting uh a
[48:17] Babylonian King a gentile and God says
[48:19] this is my servant I'm going to use and
[48:22] I will bring them against this land and
[48:23] against the habitants and all the
[48:25] nations and I will UT l l destroy them
[48:27] talking about the Jews and make them
[48:29] basically make a make a lesson out of
[48:32] them and I will take uh I will take all
[48:35] the the the good s the good songs and
[48:37] the happiness and this whole land shall
[48:40] be a desolation and they shall serve the
[48:43] king of Babylon 70 years so Jeremiah
[48:46] prophesies they're going to come and
[48:49] they're going to be taken away and
[48:51] they're going to serve 70 years and it
[48:53] shall come to pass when 70 years are
[48:55] accomplished that I'll pun the king of
[48:57] Babylon which isn't Nebuchadnezzar it's
[48:59] another king and that Nation sayith the
[49:01] Lord for their iniquity and and the land
[49:05] of the Chalan and will make it Perpetual
[49:07] desolations so they're not always going
[49:10] to be slaves to Babylon God is
[49:12] prophesying Jeremiah's
[49:16] prophesying and so then Daniel he's one
[49:19] of the people who is carried away to
[49:21] Babylon and he's an old man and he's
[49:25] reading the scroll of of
[49:27] Jeremiah here's a question for you how
[49:30] did he have
[49:32] that cuz he didn't have the Bible as we
[49:35] have he didn't have a copy of this they
[49:39] didn't they didn't pass these out at the
[49:41] fair they didn't they didn't have it
[49:43] uploaded on a site he could go and find
[49:46] they didn't have an app or a tablet or
[49:48] something he could read Daniel has
[49:51] Jeremiah's message
[49:53] books because Jeremiah has a scribe
[49:56] named baru
[49:58] and uh Baro copies down Jeremiah's
[50:01] prophecies so somebody's handing out
[50:03] Jeremiah's message books to people and
[50:06] Daniel gets a hold of this message book
[50:09] and Daniel who's a
[50:10] prophet understands that jermiah is a
[50:13] prophet and he says in the first year of
[50:17] Darius different
[50:20] Darius uh I Daniel
[50:25] understood uh by the by books the number
[50:28] of the years whereof the word of the
[50:30] Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet that
[50:33] he would accomplish 70 years in the
[50:35] desolations of Jerusalem So Daniel
[50:39] realizes time's almost up it's almost 70
[50:42] years and I'm not going to read the
[50:45] whole chapter but this is a beautiful
[50:47] chapter if you want to learn how to pray
[50:50] read this chapter because Daniel falls
[50:53] on his face before God and he says we're
[50:57] terrible we're Sinners we're awful and
[50:59] Daniel Daniel's a clean righteous man
[51:01] but he he stands in the gap for the
[51:03] children of Israel and he prays and
[51:05] repents and it's a beautiful prayer if
[51:08] you want to learn how to pray read
[51:10] Daniel 9 it's helped me a lot so then
[51:14] Isaiah so this is the last scripture
[51:17] before we go into Ezra this is
[51:21] incredible because this is about 200
[51:25] years if you want to verify you can talk
[51:28] to brother Lyle
[51:31] before Cyrus even ever existed and
[51:34] here's God calling him by name Cyrus
[51:38] isn't even born
[51:39] yet so it says thus saith the Lord to
[51:43] his anointed to Cyrus whose right hand I
[51:47] have Holden and the joke is coming whose
[51:49] right hand I have Holden to subdue
[51:52] Nations before him and I will loose the
[51:53] loins of Kings to open before him the
[51:56] two Le Gates the gate shall not be shut
[51:59] I will go before thee speaking to Cyrus
[52:01] and make crooked places straight I will
[52:03] break in pieces the gates of brass I
[52:06] will give you treasures and riches in in
[52:08] secret places that you will know that I
[52:12] the Lord have called I I am the Lord
[52:14] which call thee by name and the god of
[52:17] Israel and for my servant for Jacob my
[52:20] servant's sake and Israel my elect I
[52:23] have called thee by name I have surnamed
[52:26] thee
[52:27] though thou Hast not even known me so
[52:29] Cyrus isn't even born and God is using
[52:32] Isaiah years and years before to say
[52:37] Cyrus is going to be the one to head all
[52:40] this now where's where's the joke
[52:45] so Cyrus is the one who pulls up to
[52:49] Babylon and takes
[52:51] over does anybody remember what was
[52:53] happening in Babylon when they fall
[52:58] there's a famous thing called the
[53:00] handwriting on the wall the handwriting
[53:03] on the wall comes up brother brandham
[53:05] preaches that message the handwriting on
[53:07] the wall he talks about they're having a
[53:09] drunken rock and roll party and then
[53:12] they take the vessels of
[53:14] God and they make fun of the Jews they
[53:17] pour wine into the the holy vessels of
[53:20] God and drink out of it and then
[53:22] handwriting appears on the wall it says
[53:25] Bel shazar you're days are numbered and
[53:29] and you know your Kingdom's going to be
[53:30] destroyed well right after that
[53:32] handwriting on the wall happened Cyrus
[53:34] Pulls
[53:35] Up and destroys everything and it
[53:37] happens immediately after so what's
[53:40] funny is when Bel shazar sees the
[53:44] handwriting on the wall and I love the
[53:47] King James version for this it says his
[53:51] knees
[53:53] buckled and his loins were loosed
[53:57] and he's drunk so he soiled
[54:01] himself it's
[54:04] prophesied he will loose the loin of
[54:09] Kings can I say it he he pooped his
[54:15] pants and it was prophesied that he
[54:18] would poop his pants that King and it
[54:21] was
[54:22] Cyrus who fulfilled that God included
[54:25] that he will loose the loines of Kings
[54:28] so then now we're going to go into Ezra
[54:30] 1 so if you want to open up to Ezra
[54:32] chapter
[54:34] 1 so we we met
[54:37] Cyrus this great king he pulls up to
[54:40] Babylon kills the King kills all the the
[54:44] bad people and here's Daniel standing
[54:47] there Daniel had just interpreted the
[54:49] handwriting on the wall so Ezra chapter
[54:52] 1 verse
[54:54] one and I think brother Daniel or
[54:57] brother Lyall pointed out that the last
[54:59] two verses of 2 Chronicles are the same
[55:01] as the first two in Ezra so that makes
[55:05] us believe that Ezra wrote
[55:07] Chronicles so Ezra chapter
[55:13] 1 in the first year of Cyrus King of
[55:17] Persia uh that the word of the Lord by
[55:19] the mouth of Jeremiah referring back to
[55:21] Jeremiah again might be fulfilled the
[55:23] Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus King
[55:25] of Persia that he made a proclamation so
[55:28] he just conquered the greatest Kingdom
[55:31] in the world at that time and he doesn't
[55:34] gloat he doesn't throw a big party the
[55:37] first thing he he he the first big thing
[55:39] he does is for the Jews this little
[55:42] insignificant group of people the first
[55:44] thing he just had a glorious Victory how
[55:47] they snuck in that's a whole another
[55:49] study they have this great military
[55:51] Victory and then the first thing he
[55:54] says the Lord God Of Heaven hath given
[55:56] me all the kingdoms of the earth and he
[55:58] hath charged me to build him a house in
[56:00] Jerusalem so I ask this
[56:03] question how did he know how did he know
[56:07] that maybe he had an experience with God
[56:10] maybe an angel came to him maybe like
[56:14] you know it says it stirred up the Lord
[56:16] stirred up his
[56:18] heart whatever that means well I tend to
[56:23] think that Daniel who was standing there
[56:27] knew about the prophecy of Isaiah
[56:30] because Daniel was reading the book of
[56:31] Jeremiah So Daniel standing right there
[56:34] I just bet he walks up to Cyrus and says
[56:37] you're
[56:39] Cyrus look I have you right here already
[56:42] WR already wrote down see the date
[56:44] that's a few hundred years ago God
[56:47] already knew you were coming he already
[56:48] called you for a
[56:50] purpose can you imagine Cyrus pulling up
[56:52] and then this old man comes out with a
[56:54] scroll that's how I imagine it it
[56:56] doesn't say that in the Bible but I
[56:57] imagine Daniel came out and
[56:59] said God's called you by name Cyrus
[57:03] isn't that
[57:04] beautiful and so the Jews who have been
[57:06] in captivity all these years now have a
[57:09] proclamation from the most powerful guy
[57:11] on Earth to go and rebuild the Temple so
[57:14] things things are looking
[57:16] better and Cyrus gives them in this
[57:18] first
[57:19] chapter uh well in verse three he says
[57:21] who is there among you of all his people
[57:24] uh if God be with him let him go up to
[57:26] Jerusalem which is in Judah and build
[57:28] the house of the Lord God of Israel he
[57:32] is the god which is in
[57:34] Jerusalem and whosoever remaineth in any
[57:38] place uh where he sojourneth let the men
[57:42] of his place help him with silver and
[57:44] with gold and with goods and with
[57:46] beasts beside the Free Will offering of
[57:49] the house of God that is in Jerusalem so
[57:51] he helps them he gives them gold silver
[57:53] he gives them a bunch a bunch of stuff B
[57:56] of Gold Silver and he sends them to
[57:59] rebuild the Temple what a glorious thing
[58:02] God bringing his children
[58:04] back so Ezra chapter
[58:09] 2 so they return we won't
[58:12] read Ezra chapter 2 it's it's a number
[58:16] chapter so uh these are the children
[58:18] there's
[58:20] 42360 rep people people that returned to
[58:24] Jerusalem and there's seven
[58:26] ,000 uh maids and servants and I loved
[58:30] this I had to include 200 singing men
[58:33] and women that return and it says
[58:36] singing men and
[58:38] women I was talking to Katie about men
[58:43] and women worshiping because it's always
[58:45] put on the the song leader you know the
[58:49] the the brother who stands up here and
[58:50] leads songs but men and women worshiping
[58:55] I had to throw that in there we're all
[58:57] worshippers and this is what this was
[58:59] all about it's not so they could have a
[59:00] nice Temple and a nice church this was
[59:03] to restore worship that was at the heart
[59:05] of it all to restore worship to restore
[59:07] the word of God to the people and 700
[59:10] horses mules camels and for some reason
[59:13] they had 6,000
[59:16] donkeys so we can move on past Ezra
[59:21] 2 to Ezra
[59:23] 3 you'll see this phrase pop up in the
[59:25] book of Ezra La all the people came
[59:27] together as one man as one man I want to
[59:31] maybe I'll maybe I'll make that a thing
[59:33] at church we're all here together
[59:34] worshiping as one man they all come
[59:37] together I love
[59:39] that so Ezra chapter 3 all the people
[59:42] come together as one man and they uh
[59:46] they they offer some sacrifices they
[59:49] kind of settle back in can you imagine
[59:50] coming back to
[59:52] church after 70 years so imagine you're
[59:55] a little little a little kid getting
[59:57] carried away to Babylon and now all
[59:59] these years later with 42,000 50,000
[1:00:02] people this great big Caravan you come
[1:00:04] back and you offer that first sacrifice
[1:00:08] you you s you're singing songs you're
[1:00:10] worshiping it's a great happy time and
[1:00:13] it was actually two years before they
[1:00:15] even started building the Temple this is
[1:00:16] a big lengthy process they had to bring
[1:00:19] back all the gold all the silver
[1:00:22] everything and uh so they offer the
[1:00:27] offerings and in the second year so two
[1:00:31] years uh began zerubabel oh and I forgot
[1:00:35] to include this
[1:00:36] zerubabel would have been King so he's
[1:00:39] in the the davidic line he would have
[1:00:42] been the king so he uh Cyrus makes him
[1:00:46] the governor so he even recognizes this
[1:00:49] is their leader I'll let him run the
[1:00:51] show over here he gives them power he
[1:00:53] gives zerubabel so that's zerubabel he's
[1:00:55] in the davidic line he would have been
[1:00:57] King is that right brother Lyall he
[1:00:59] would have been the king you wouldn't
[1:01:01] tell me I'm wrong in front of everybody
[1:01:03] though
[1:01:06] so and so they
[1:01:09] uh the builders laid the foundation of
[1:01:12] the temple so there's that's verse 10
[1:01:14] Ezra 3:10 they laid the foundation of
[1:01:17] the
[1:01:17] temple and they they have symbols and
[1:01:20] they praised the Lord and they sang
[1:01:23] together giving thanks unto the Lord
[1:01:26] because he is good for his mercy
[1:01:28] endureth forever toward Israel you see
[1:01:30] that phrase pop up a lot he's good for
[1:01:32] his mercy endureth forever in Ezra and
[1:01:34] Nehemiah and they shouted with a great
[1:01:37] shout when they praised the Lord because
[1:01:39] the foundation was laid and they're all
[1:01:42] happy but it's kind of an
[1:01:45] interesting thing that happens because
[1:01:49] they're shouting and they're so happy
[1:01:52] but some of the some of the people who
[1:01:53] were little and they were alive when
[1:01:57] they were carried off and now they're
[1:01:58] old that they came back it says in verse
[1:02:01] 12 many of the priests and the Levites
[1:02:04] and the chief of the fathers who were
[1:02:06] ancient men 70 80 years I don't know it
[1:02:11] says ancient had seen the first house
[1:02:14] when the foundation of the house was
[1:02:15] laid before their eyes and wept with a
[1:02:18] loud voice because they saw the first
[1:02:21] thing they saw Solomon's Temple and so
[1:02:24] you get the end of this chapter is kind
[1:02:25] of like are we happy are we sad because
[1:02:28] it says so the people could not discern
[1:02:30] the noise of the shout of Joy from the
[1:02:33] noise of
[1:02:36] weeping for the people shouted with a
[1:02:38] loud shout and the noise was heard AAR
[1:02:41] off so remember when Solomon dedicated
[1:02:43] the temple and the cloud and the fire
[1:02:45] and and God comes down and it's this
[1:02:47] glorious thing well it doesn't happen
[1:02:50] when they lay the foundation and so the
[1:02:53] people who had seen it before were there
[1:02:55] and they just start crying it's not the
[1:02:59] same and when I was reading that I
[1:03:01] didn't really know what to think about
[1:03:02] that you know God blessed them they came
[1:03:04] back they have this Foundation you think
[1:03:06] they'd be grateful but they remember
[1:03:08] what it
[1:03:09] was and so now we go on to Ezra 4 we'll
[1:03:13] leave that as
[1:03:16] is so when the enemies if you all look
[1:03:20] at Ezra 4 verse one when the adversaries
[1:03:23] of Judah and Benjamin heard that the
[1:03:26] children of the Captivity builded the
[1:03:29] temple unto the Lord God of Israel they
[1:03:31] came to
[1:03:32] zerubabel and the chief of the fathers
[1:03:34] and said let us build with you for we
[1:03:37] also seek your God as you do and we
[1:03:40] sacrificed to him uh since the days of
[1:03:43] this
[1:03:44] guy that brought us up hither but
[1:03:48] zerubabel and this is kind of harsh
[1:03:50] zerubabel and Yeshua and the rest of the
[1:03:52] chief of the fathers of Israel said unto
[1:03:54] him you have nothing to do with us to
[1:03:57] build a house to our
[1:03:59] god so these people are coming up
[1:04:01] offering to
[1:04:03] help and zerubabel says no we don't want
[1:04:07] your help have nothing to do with us
[1:04:10] we'll build it we will build the temple
[1:04:13] to God as king Cyrus has commanded us so
[1:04:16] it's kind of harsh I read that and I was
[1:04:18] like why aren't you going to let him
[1:04:20] help
[1:04:21] zerubabel but you see his discernments
[1:04:23] right because the very next part so so
[1:04:27] he says no you can't help us build so if
[1:04:29] they really just wanted to help they
[1:04:32] would have said okay we'll just mind our
[1:04:34] own business if that's what they really
[1:04:37] wanted to do but right
[1:04:39] away so these people of the
[1:04:41] land weakened the hands of the people of
[1:04:44] Judah and troubled them in building so
[1:04:47] they they don't let them build they
[1:04:49] don't let them help building and then
[1:04:50] they say all right well if you're not
[1:04:52] going to let us help then we're going to
[1:04:53] work against you like come on so one
[1:04:58] thing I learned about these people
[1:05:02] is they did actually offer sacrifices to
[1:05:05] Jehovah they
[1:05:07] did what they're saying is
[1:05:11] true but they had also allowed idolatry
[1:05:15] in they were worshiping all kinds of
[1:05:17] other gods they were doing all kinds of
[1:05:20] things it it reminds me of of some
[1:05:22] Christian churches today that stand for
[1:05:25] things that Christians shouldn't be
[1:05:27] standing for and they come to zerubabel
[1:05:31] and they say oh yeah we're just like you
[1:05:34] guys and zerubabel knows if I let them
[1:05:37] in they're going to bring all that bad
[1:05:39] stuff with them so he says no no thank
[1:05:43] you Cyrus commanded us to build we have
[1:05:46] nothing to do with
[1:05:48] you and it was the right call because
[1:05:51] these people are clearly against them
[1:05:54] and so they weaken the hand hands and it
[1:05:56] even says they hired
[1:05:58] counselors these people were working
[1:06:01] hard to keep to keep them from building
[1:06:04] their Temple I mean they really care
[1:06:07] that the Jews are getting something done
[1:06:10] if you want to if you think this if you
[1:06:12] think this uh this thing is funny just
[1:06:15] look at Israel
[1:06:16] today they try to do something
[1:06:19] immediately everybody's all on it they
[1:06:20] can't be doing that they can't be
[1:06:22] occupying this area they can't be here
[1:06:24] they're doing that they we want to have
[1:06:26] this this part of land every time Israel
[1:06:28] wants to do something it this is this is
[1:06:30] nothing
[1:06:32] new and and it's still happening to this
[1:06:35] day Israel tries to do something so I
[1:06:39] have on the bottom there the devil gives
[1:06:41] away what is true by what he
[1:06:44] fights so the fact that they have all
[1:06:47] these adversaries it's clear that's God
[1:06:49] that God is with them it's clear that
[1:06:50] he's blessing it but then there's people
[1:06:52] fighting it that proves God is with them
[1:06:55] so if you know just to bring it down to
[1:06:58] home if you know I'm in the Lord's will
[1:07:01] I'm doing what I believe pleases him but
[1:07:03] nothing's working out and you you're
[1:07:05] facing all these all these little
[1:07:07] obstacles here and there the devil gives
[1:07:10] away what is true by what he
[1:07:13] fights so they hire counselors they
[1:07:16] fight against
[1:07:17] them and uh there's one problem is the
[1:07:21] king is on the Jews side so they wait
[1:07:23] for Cyrus to be gone
[1:07:26] and then they write a letter to
[1:07:28] azerus to get this building project
[1:07:30] stopped so they're two chicken to go to
[1:07:35] Cyrus and and talk to him about it
[1:07:38] because they know Cyrus is with them so
[1:07:40] they write a
[1:07:42] letter uh to AR Xerxes and they say uh
[1:07:46] I'll just
[1:07:48] paraphrase they write and this is a copy
[1:07:51] of the letter verse 11 be it known unto
[1:07:54] the king that the Jews which came up
[1:07:56] from thee and are come to
[1:07:58] Jerusalem uh building the rebellious and
[1:08:02] bad City and have set up the walls
[1:08:05] thereof and joined the foundations be it
[1:08:07] known now to the king that if this city
[1:08:09] is builded and the walls set up again
[1:08:12] that they won't pay toll they won't pay
[1:08:14] tribute so they won't pay their taxes
[1:08:16] they won't help the
[1:08:18] kingdom and they're just badmouthing the
[1:08:20] Jews saying they're not they're going to
[1:08:22] be a terrible group of people you
[1:08:23] shouldn't let them do do this so and
[1:08:26] then they say search the records see
[1:08:28] that the Jews have been difficult in the
[1:08:30] past
[1:08:32] so the
[1:08:34] king says I command a search be made in
[1:08:38] verse uh
[1:08:40] 19 and he finds he finds these documents
[1:08:46] and he says there have been mighty Kings
[1:08:48] in
[1:08:49] Jerusalem so he sees that in the past
[1:08:54] Israel Judah they've been blessed and so
[1:08:57] he says yeah uh stop the
[1:09:01] building stop so until indefinitely
[1:09:05] until another commandment is given stop
[1:09:07] the
[1:09:08] building and why should this this all
[1:09:11] this stuff continue if it's going to
[1:09:12] hurt my kingdom basically the king says
[1:09:15] so these group of people think about it
[1:09:17] originally they came up offering to
[1:09:19] help and now they've wrote a letter to
[1:09:22] the king
[1:09:24] and the king because of all their
[1:09:27] trouble they went through the king says
[1:09:29] stop the work so Ezra
[1:09:35] 5 it continues on this chapter doesn't
[1:09:38] start a new story so the building
[1:09:40] continues so the
[1:09:43] prophets on the scene in Ezra 5 vers1
[1:09:47] hegi and the and
[1:09:49] Zachariah prophesied to the Jews so if
[1:09:52] you read the book of hegi hegi is
[1:09:54] encouraging zerubabel build do it so the
[1:09:58] king told him don't build stop and and
[1:10:01] hegi comes and says no God is with you
[1:10:03] I'll read just a few verses out of hegi
[1:10:05] just real
[1:10:08] quick in the seventh month 12th day of
[1:10:11] the month came the word of the Lord to
[1:10:13] the prophet hegi saying speak now to
[1:10:15] zerubabel the governor of Judah and to
[1:10:18] Joshua and and to the priest and the res
[1:10:20] of the people saying who is left among
[1:10:23] you that saw this house in her first
[1:10:25] Glory glory and how do you see it now
[1:10:28] it's nothing so he says in verse four
[1:10:31] God through
[1:10:33] hegi yet now be strong o zerubabel be
[1:10:38] strong and sayith the Lord and work for
[1:10:43] I Am With You sayith the Lord according
[1:10:46] to the word and so God basically comes
[1:10:49] to hegi and he says tell go tell them
[1:10:53] even though the king said to stop
[1:10:54] building
[1:10:55] go tell them to keep building so they
[1:10:58] have a commandment from the king not to
[1:10:59] build but they have the prophet praise
[1:11:03] God that he has a prophet there to tell
[1:11:06] him and so they they start building
[1:11:09] again because the prophet said so and
[1:11:12] immediately these idiots come back right
[1:11:15] away they come back maybe I shouldn't
[1:11:17] say that word they come back and
[1:11:21] immediately I mean they just start
[1:11:23] building again and these guys they can't
[1:11:25] get enough and they
[1:11:27] said who told you it's like it's like
[1:11:31] have you who has
[1:11:33] siblings and and you're and you're doing
[1:11:36] something and hey did Mom say you could
[1:11:37] do that it's like they're just building
[1:11:40] their Temple and they immediately come
[1:11:42] and says who said you could build
[1:11:45] this and then said we as we speaking
[1:11:48] unto them after this manner or they they
[1:11:51] said uh what are the names of the men
[1:11:54] that make this build building but the
[1:11:56] eye of God was upon the Elders of the
[1:11:58] Jews so God was watching over
[1:12:00] Israel uh that they could not cause them
[1:12:03] to cease so they're trying to make them
[1:12:05] stop they're trying to make him stop
[1:12:07] building but God was watching over them
[1:12:09] so then they write another letter to the
[1:12:11] king so it's immediately
[1:12:13] Mom they're building again and so they
[1:12:17] write a
[1:12:18] letter be it known to the king that we
[1:12:21] went to the province of Judea to the
[1:12:23] house of the great God uh which was
[1:12:26] builded with great Stones Timber and and
[1:12:29] we asked the elders uh who commanded you
[1:12:31] to build and we asked their names and uh
[1:12:36] they returned to us we are the Servants
[1:12:38] of the god of Heaven and Earth and build
[1:12:41] the house that was build these many
[1:12:43] years ago which a great king of Israel
[1:12:45] builded and set up speaking of
[1:12:48] Solomon so then they explain the story
[1:12:50] they get carried away they come back
[1:12:52] then they tell them but Cyrus commanded
[1:12:55] us to do this so they're recapping and
[1:12:57] all the vessels of gold and silver in
[1:12:59] the house of God which Nebuchadnezzar
[1:13:01] took and Cyrus the king and he give he
[1:13:04] gives it back to us and so we came to
[1:13:07] rebuild and that's what we're
[1:13:09] doing so verse
[1:13:11] 17 now therefore if it seem good to the
[1:13:13] king let a search be made so they're
[1:13:15] they're they're trying again to get this
[1:13:17] to stop whether it be true that a decree
[1:13:21] was made from Cyrus to the house of God
[1:13:24] and let the king send his pleasure to us
[1:13:28] concerning this matter so like I said
[1:13:30] they come running back to Mom trying to
[1:13:34] they they really care like I said the
[1:13:36] devil gives away what is true by what he
[1:13:39] fights so Darius makes a decree he gets
[1:13:42] this letter and he says okay yeah let's
[1:13:44] search and see if there was a command
[1:13:48] from Grandpa to build this thing and so
[1:13:52] yes sure enough they find at Etha
[1:13:57] brother Lyall they find a a document a
[1:14:01] scroll and they see this is true that
[1:14:05] Cyrus did command this and
[1:14:09] so uh and He commands how the temple
[1:14:12] should be built and all the stuff all
[1:14:14] the help all the gold and silver that
[1:14:15] should be given to the children of
[1:14:17] Israel to help them He commands that it
[1:14:18] should happen so then he writes a letter
[1:14:21] back now therefore in Ezra Ezra 6: 6
[1:14:27] Governor beyond the river these are the
[1:14:30] enemies that are trying to stop them be
[1:14:33] ye far from V so now God is is using the
[1:14:36] king to help them again let the work of
[1:14:39] this house of God alone let the governor
[1:14:42] of the Jews and the Elders of the Jews
[1:14:44] build this house of God so God's back on
[1:14:46] their side again and he goes even
[1:14:49] further I make a decree that what you
[1:14:52] shall do to the Elders of these Jews for
[1:14:54] the building of the House of the god of
[1:14:57] of God that of the king's Goods even of
[1:15:00] the tribute beyond the river so the land
[1:15:03] you live in the king speaking to these
[1:15:05] annoying people the taxes you pay I'm
[1:15:09] giving it to the Jews to help them
[1:15:12] build ouch ouch that's a real burn he
[1:15:17] says I I I think the king picks up on
[1:15:19] their snotty attitude in their letter oh
[1:15:22] King we just want to help you we just
[1:15:25] want to let you know that the Jews are
[1:15:26] building this Temple he says well I'm
[1:15:29] going to let him keep doing it and the
[1:15:31] taxes you pay you're going to help pay
[1:15:34] for it and furthermore anything they
[1:15:36] have need of you're going to give to
[1:15:38] them day or night if they come ask for
[1:15:40] it you're going to give it to them so
[1:15:42] this this is a
[1:15:43] burn if they need Bullocks Rams Lambs
[1:15:47] for burnt offerings to the god of heaven
[1:15:48] so he's even helping them at church if
[1:15:51] they need wheat salt wine oil what ever
[1:15:55] the priests say you give it to them day
[1:15:58] by day without fail that they may offer
[1:16:01] sacrifices of sweet savors unto the god
[1:16:04] of heaven and pray for the life of the
[1:16:07] king and his sons and I have made a
[1:16:09] decree so you think okay so he's
[1:16:11] supporting
[1:16:13] them he's he's giving them money he's
[1:16:15] helping them out but he even he even
[1:16:17] give he even makes it even more intense
[1:16:20] he
[1:16:22] says who show whosoever shall alter this
[1:16:25] word let a Timber a beam be pulled down
[1:16:29] out of that guy's house and let him be
[1:16:32] impaled on
[1:16:34] it so he takes it even further or or
[1:16:38] hung it either be hung or impaled
[1:16:41] there's two but still he he says I'm
[1:16:44] serious about this if anyone Alters a
[1:16:46] word let it be taken off of his house
[1:16:49] and let him be punished
[1:16:52] severely and uh
[1:16:55] so it's it's pretty clear he supports
[1:16:58] them and I want to read in verse 14
[1:17:01] because it says so they continue
[1:17:02] building obviously they have all these
[1:17:04] resources they have all this help and
[1:17:06] they prospered through the prophesying
[1:17:08] of hegi the prophet and Zachariah I
[1:17:11] think that's beautiful we have we have
[1:17:14] Ministry today we can you know turn on a
[1:17:17] tape and be blessed these people are
[1:17:19] building it's exciting and they have two
[1:17:21] prophets there ministering encouraging
[1:17:24] them
[1:17:25] and it even later says that the prophets
[1:17:27] helped they helped
[1:17:29] build and then it finally comes to the
[1:17:32] moment this house was finished on the
[1:17:35] third day and the children of Israel and
[1:17:37] the
[1:17:38] priests uh kept the dedication of this
[1:17:41] house of God with joy and they offered
[1:17:43] at the dedication 100 Bullocks 200 Rams
[1:17:47] 400 Lambs for a sin offering they
[1:17:49] haven't done this you know all those
[1:17:51] years in Babylon so they're they're
[1:17:53] offering these sacrifices they're
[1:17:54] haven't in church so we don't do that
[1:17:57] today but maybe when we come and sing
[1:18:00] songs Sunday morning maybe we could
[1:18:02] maybe we could put a little more into it
[1:18:04] you know it's a lot of work to kill a to
[1:18:07] kill hundreds of lambs and and and goats
[1:18:10] and and Rams as a song leader myself it
[1:18:15] would be nice if people raised their
[1:18:16] hand you don't have to kill a come up
[1:18:19] and and kill a and make an offering and
[1:18:21] bring a spotless lamb and just raise
[1:18:24] your hand worship him right from right
[1:18:27] right where you are from right where you
[1:18:29] are you can do it you know
[1:18:34] anyway and so they they uh they restore
[1:18:37] the feasts too they have
[1:18:40] Passover and uh the children which were
[1:18:44] come out of
[1:18:46] captivity uh they eat they Feast they
[1:18:50] have a good time it's joyful
[1:18:53] and uh um kept the Feast of unleavened
[1:18:58] bread all
[1:19:02] right now chapter
[1:19:07] 7 so Ezra so they rebuilt the temple but
[1:19:10] I told you at the heart of this Ezra
[1:19:11] wanted the word back to the people he
[1:19:13] wanted worship restored that was what
[1:19:15] was important to
[1:19:17] him and so Ezra this is where we learn
[1:19:20] that he's a descendant of Aaron the high
[1:19:23] priest so we learn in this chapter we
[1:19:24] see he goes all the way back to
[1:19:27] Aaron and it says Ezra went up from
[1:19:30] Babylon in
[1:19:32] 7:6 and he was ready scribe in the law
[1:19:35] of
[1:19:36] Moses uh which the Lord God of Israel
[1:19:38] had given and the King granted him all
[1:19:41] his requests according to the hand of
[1:19:43] the Lord God upon him I got to I got to
[1:19:44] speed up I won't take too much time on
[1:19:47] each of these chapters but the king
[1:19:50] writes him a a really nice letter and
[1:19:53] again says Ezra whatever you need I got
[1:19:58] you so at the end of this chapter I mean
[1:20:01] I mean the king really blesses him gold
[1:20:04] silver anything you need it's yours and
[1:20:08] Ezra says blessed be the Lord God of our
[1:20:11] fathers which hath put such a thing in
[1:20:13] the king's heart to beautify the house
[1:20:15] of the Lord which is in Jerusalem and
[1:20:18] hath extended Mercy unto me before the
[1:20:21] king so Ezra give gives thanks to God
[1:20:26] and now Ezra 8 so it continues on so
[1:20:30] they're there they're not in Jerusalem
[1:20:32] they got to pick all this stuff up from
[1:20:34] the King and they got to take it all the
[1:20:36] way back to Jerusalem so they come
[1:20:39] back they got to walk that whole way and
[1:20:44] and the King says whatever you need any
[1:20:46] protection anything you need I got you
[1:20:49] you know you're carrying all this stuff
[1:20:50] Ezra rounds up a group of guys and
[1:20:52] they're going to carry it all back
[1:20:55] silver livestock Temple vessels and no
[1:20:58] Army to protect them so they fast and
[1:21:02] they pray and it's really funny because
[1:21:04] Ezra stands up and he says we need to
[1:21:07] fast and we need to pray we got this
[1:21:08] long journey back and I'm ashamed to ask
[1:21:12] the king for help because I told the
[1:21:15] king that God was with us Ezra says that
[1:21:17] he says I told the king God would be
[1:21:20] with us and we wouldn't have we wouldn't
[1:21:22] have to worry God would watch over us
[1:21:23] we're God's people you know he's got us
[1:21:25] he's going to watch over us but we have
[1:21:27] all this stuff and we're going 900 miles
[1:21:31] I I did my research it'd be like walking
[1:21:35] with all that gold all that silver all
[1:21:38] those vessels all those animals from
[1:21:40] here to Dallas
[1:21:42] Texas walking all the way so they're at
[1:21:45] this River and he says we need to fast
[1:21:48] and we need to pray and so cuz and it
[1:21:51] even says he was ashamed I don't want to
[1:21:53] ask the king would give him soldiers
[1:21:55] right away you need soldiers I he would
[1:21:56] give it to him to protect him but he
[1:21:59] says my God is with us we'll fast we'll
[1:22:03] pray and it says that
[1:22:07] uh that the Lord intreated them the Lord
[1:22:12] heard them the Lord responded and he
[1:22:15] watches over them and he delivers them
[1:22:18] to Judah safely so you know he's still
[1:22:21] the the same God
[1:22:22] today if you need something
[1:22:25] you can fast you can pray the Lord will
[1:22:28] hear you like I said Ezra was not a
[1:22:31] prophet all these these group of guys
[1:22:33] that were with Ezra with all this stuff
[1:22:35] they weren't prophets they weren't
[1:22:38] Angels they were just people that had
[1:22:41] the vision they wanted to they wanted to
[1:22:43] do something for the Lord they fasted
[1:22:45] they prayed and it's a miracle that they
[1:22:47] went 900 miles and nothing happened to
[1:22:50] them they were perfectly safe not an
[1:22:53] ounce of gold missing not an ounce of
[1:22:56] silver missing and they get back of
[1:22:58] course they offer sacrifices to the Lord
[1:23:01] thanking him they weigh all the gold and
[1:23:03] the silver it's all there every weight
[1:23:06] every piece of it is
[1:23:07] there I also have a feeling that this is
[1:23:10] where Ezra got uh this is it might have
[1:23:14] been this trip that he got the Book of
[1:23:16] Daniel because like I told you Ezra was
[1:23:18] putting together the books of the Old
[1:23:20] Testament so he's back he's acquiring
[1:23:23] all these books
[1:23:25] I think maybe on this on this trip he
[1:23:27] got the The Scroll of Daniel and he said
[1:23:30] this needs to go in the Bible you know
[1:23:31] this so that's just me I have I have
[1:23:34] little
[1:23:37] thoughts Ezra
[1:23:41] 9 so this is where it gets really
[1:23:44] really starts to get
[1:23:47] bad
[1:23:49] so word comes to Ezra so remember let me
[1:23:53] let me back up Deuteronomy 7 is up there
[1:23:55] that's the scripture that says Don't
[1:23:58] marry the jebusites the moabites the
[1:24:02] Hittites don't marry all these people
[1:24:04] brother Lyall read that when he did his
[1:24:06] his study on Ruth it said don't marry
[1:24:08] all these people so these people had
[1:24:10] been gone in Babylon 70 years they
[1:24:13] didn't have the Bible they didn't have
[1:24:15] the word they didn't have access to it
[1:24:18] so they're marrying
[1:24:19] people that they weren't supposed to be
[1:24:21] marrying and it says they bring this
[1:24:24] report to Ezra in verse two they have
[1:24:28] taken of their daughters the Hittites
[1:24:31] the parasites the jebusites they have
[1:24:32] taken these people for themselves for
[1:24:34] their
[1:24:35] sons and the holy seed have mingled
[1:24:37] themselves with the people of those
[1:24:39] lands so they're they're they're trying
[1:24:42] so hard to do everything right and then
[1:24:44] they're like great for all these years
[1:24:46] we' for these past couple years we've
[1:24:48] been marrying these wrong people and
[1:24:50] Ezra says when I heard this thing I rent
[1:24:53] my garment and my mantle and plucked off
[1:24:56] the hair of my head and my
[1:24:58] beard and sat down
[1:25:00] astonished
[1:25:02] and there was assembled unto me everyone
[1:25:06] that trembled at these words so they
[1:25:07] realized this is a big deal this is not
[1:25:10] what God wanted us to do and so Ezra
[1:25:14] falls down and he says oh oh my God I am
[1:25:17] ashamed in verse six and blush to lift
[1:25:20] up my face to thee my God for our
[1:25:22] iniquities are increased over our our
[1:25:24] head and since the days of our fathers
[1:25:27] have we been a great trespass to you so
[1:25:30] so so he said for years we've been
[1:25:32] sinning we've been displeasing the
[1:25:35] Lord and you you've delivered us there's
[1:25:38] a lot of recap they explain What's
[1:25:40] happen there A lot of times they refer
[1:25:42] back to the last 100 years and now verse
[1:25:46] eight for a little space Grace has been
[1:25:49] showed from the Lord Our God and he says
[1:25:52] we don't deserve it but you showed us
[1:25:55] Grace and you allowed us to escape and
[1:25:58] to come
[1:26:00] back and to give us to give us a little
[1:26:03] happiness after all that and we've done
[1:26:06] this terrible thing and he's just
[1:26:09] heartbroken and and now oh God what
[1:26:12] shall we say after this for we've
[1:26:14] forsake we've forsaken your Commandments
[1:26:17] this is also a good lesson on how to
[1:26:18] pray so they've done something wrong
[1:26:22] they don't sidestep it Ezra says we're
[1:26:25] wrong Lord he come he comes humbly now
[1:26:29] if you know
[1:26:31] Jehovah God Jesus you know that he is
[1:26:35] full of
[1:26:37] grace so I believe that with that like
[1:26:40] that it says they're trembling they're
[1:26:41] repenting they're they're weeping I
[1:26:44] believe God would have forgiven
[1:26:46] them I believe they repented if they
[1:26:49] made
[1:26:50] sacrifices if if they did these things
[1:26:52] God would have forgiven them they
[1:26:54] they're sincere they know they were
[1:26:56] wrong and he prays on and he
[1:26:58] says we've done all this and our evil
[1:27:01] deeds and our
[1:27:03] trespasses and uh we broken your
[1:27:06] Commandments
[1:27:08] again and what are we going to do about
[1:27:10] these
[1:27:11] Abominations and in verse 15 he says oh
[1:27:14] Lord God of Israel Thou Art
[1:27:16] righteous for we remain yet escaped as
[1:27:19] it is this day behold we are before thee
[1:27:23] in our trespass we're
[1:27:25] guilty and we cannot stand before thee
[1:27:28] because of
[1:27:30] this so chapter 10 this is the last
[1:27:33] chapter of Ezra so Ezra had got through
[1:27:37] praying it's very
[1:27:39] sad and when he had confessed weeping
[1:27:41] and casting himself down before the
[1:27:44] house of God there assembled unto him
[1:27:47] some guys and and some men and women and
[1:27:50] children and the people all wept so I
[1:27:53] like I said I imagine God would forgive
[1:27:55] them I believe he would
[1:27:57] have and shechaniah the son of
[1:28:01] Jalel one of the sons of a lamb answered
[1:28:04] and said unto Ezra we've trespassed
[1:28:07] against our God and we've taken strange
[1:28:09] wives of the people of the
[1:28:11] land yet now there is hope in Israel
[1:28:14] concerning this thing so now he has an
[1:28:16] idea he says in verse three chapter
[1:28:20] 10 he says uh let us make a Covenant
[1:28:24] with our God to put away all the
[1:28:27] wives and such that are born of
[1:28:30] them so he says let's just divorce them
[1:28:33] all now these people had families kids
[1:28:37] wives and families and he says let's put
[1:28:39] away the wives and
[1:28:42] kids and
[1:28:45] uh according to the council now let us
[1:28:48] make a covenant that we put away all the
[1:28:49] wives and such as are born of them
[1:28:52] according to the counsel of my Lord and
[1:28:55] of those that tremble at the Commandment
[1:28:57] of our God and let it be done according
[1:28:59] to the law they say well we don't know
[1:29:01] what else to do so I guess we have to
[1:29:03] backtrack and put away these wives and
[1:29:05] then go on living good lives and so Ezra
[1:29:08] Rises up and he says okay I guess we're
[1:29:11] going to do that which was a huge
[1:29:13] mistake a few chapters earlier they
[1:29:16] fasted and prayed for something and God
[1:29:18] gave them an answer but they don't do it
[1:29:20] here they just rush into okay we're
[1:29:22] divorcing everybody sending the kids
[1:29:25] away terrible why didn't they fast and
[1:29:28] pray like they did at the river and God
[1:29:31] delivered them and they got their answer
[1:29:33] from God but they don't do that and they
[1:29:36] just rush into this this and it's just a
[1:29:38] mess and this is how this is how this
[1:29:41] book ends it's like after all the
[1:29:43] Miracles all the things God did for him
[1:29:46] it ends this way they're divorcing
[1:29:48] everybody and I counted it
[1:29:51] out 114 record Ed for people that
[1:29:56] divorced that had families there might
[1:29:57] have been more there probably was
[1:29:59] more and it's just and that's the end of
[1:30:03] the book of Ezra it just ends right
[1:30:05] there so I told you I was going to talk
[1:30:08] about
[1:30:09] Malachi so God sends a
[1:30:12] prophet and if anyone is familiar with
[1:30:16] what we call the message Malachi is
[1:30:18] important isn't
[1:30:20] he so Malachi comes on the scene
[1:30:26] in Chapter 2 Malachi 2:
[1:30:30] 16 for the Lord God the god of Israel
[1:30:34] saith that he hateth putting
[1:30:37] away
[1:30:39] divorcing so this is right after all
[1:30:41] this happens God sends a prophet and one
[1:30:43] of the issues Malachi deals with he says
[1:30:45] God hates
[1:30:48] divorce so God really come he comes down
[1:30:50] hard on them this is
[1:30:52] wrong this is not what you were supposed
[1:30:55] to
[1:30:56] do God hates divorce more than the fact
[1:31:00] that they married those wrong people
[1:31:02] they married the wrong people they made
[1:31:04] the mistake but God hates divorce even
[1:31:06] more and God shows it through Malachi
[1:31:10] right there he says he calls it out he
[1:31:12] hits it right on the nail this is wrong
[1:31:14] this is not what you were supposed to do
[1:31:17] so I'm going to put up this timeline
[1:31:18] because I want to show something so
[1:31:21] we've gotten all the way through the
[1:31:22] book of Ezra
[1:31:27] so Jesus is right here where the laser
[1:31:33] is Ezra Esther and Nehemiah are right
[1:31:37] here so when you look at it laid out
[1:31:40] like that Ezra and Nehemiah are not
[1:31:43] right before Psalms like they are in the
[1:31:45] Bible they're actually at the end of the
[1:31:47] Old Testament where Malachi is just just
[1:31:50] the way they uh organize the Bible they
[1:31:53] put them in the middle I don't know why
[1:31:55] I would have put them at the end but
[1:31:57] easier to say hindsight so they're right
[1:32:00] here so right before Jesus we have Ezra
[1:32:05] Esther and Nehemiah and then we have
[1:32:08] silent years and Jesus comes so right
[1:32:12] before Jesus comes they rebuild the
[1:32:14] Temple they get the word back to the
[1:32:16] people they do all this
[1:32:19] stuff why why did God do it then because
[1:32:24] Jesus was
[1:32:26] coming the the whole reason the only
[1:32:30] reason that it mattered was because God
[1:32:33] was establishing the the greatest thing
[1:32:35] the greatest gift that was ever going to
[1:32:37] be sent to the Earth was about to come
[1:32:39] so that's what I wanted to end with that
[1:32:41] because it's all about Jesus that's the
[1:32:44] lesson in this
[1:32:46] now the next slide how does this apply
[1:32:52] today
[1:32:57] well we have a message don't
[1:33:02] we and all of us personally in our lives
[1:33:07] in some way or another have come out of
[1:33:10] Babylon you follow me none of us have
[1:33:13] been to Babylon well some of us have
[1:33:17] gone to historically but none none of us
[1:33:19] have have have been enslaved this way
[1:33:22] but we all in our personal
[1:33:25] lives had to come out of
[1:33:27] Babylon this this is applicable to us we
[1:33:31] had to rebuild this
[1:33:34] Temple we had to rebuild we had to bring
[1:33:37] the word back we had to we we had to we
[1:33:41] had to make it real for ourselves we had
[1:33:43] to come out I can tell you personally in
[1:33:46] high
[1:33:47] school I was a pot
[1:33:50] smoking drinking cussing I'll use that
[1:33:53] word again
[1:33:56] idiot I had to come out of
[1:33:58] that
[1:34:00] why because I believe Jesus is coming
[1:34:03] again soon so he restores all this he
[1:34:07] restores the temple he restores the word
[1:34:09] and what happens Jesus comes
[1:34:13] again and they miss
[1:34:18] it could that happen to
[1:34:21] us should we be prideful and think think
[1:34:24] we have Zachariah heah Malachi now we'd
[1:34:28] say we have brother bram's
[1:34:32] message from God make no mistake from
[1:34:35] God we have
[1:34:38] it but could we get too prideful and
[1:34:40] could it go right over our
[1:34:43] heads this is serious God God does
[1:34:48] Miracles through Cyrus and God has given
[1:34:51] us a nation of free religion like Cyrus
[1:34:53] gave the Jews to come back to Jehovah
[1:34:56] fulfilling prophecy performing what he
[1:34:59] said he would do and Jesus came and they
[1:35:02] missed
[1:35:04] it I didn't bring the quote but in God
[1:35:08] hiding himself in simplicity at the end
[1:35:11] of the
[1:35:11] tape and it everybody's shouting at the
[1:35:15] preaching but brother brandham says it's
[1:35:17] going to come one day and he's in
[1:35:19] Indiana and he says how many will be
[1:35:21] gone from
[1:35:22] Jeffersonville
[1:35:24] maybe
[1:35:27] one brother brenham's friends were
[1:35:30] there his church he was at his church he
[1:35:33] wasn't in Las
[1:35:35] Vegas he wasn't he wasn't in La he
[1:35:39] wasn't he said how many will be gone
[1:35:40] from
[1:35:41] Jeffersonville maybe
[1:35:45] one like I said God brought them back He
[1:35:48] restored the word to
[1:35:51] them and Jesus came
[1:35:55] and they missed
[1:35:58] it let's all
[1:36:01] stand I think we should
[1:36:07] pray dear heavenly
[1:36:11] father we've come to a place in your
[1:36:14] word we see a marvelous thing you
[1:36:19] did Lord we see Miracles you've done
[1:36:23] back in the
[1:36:25] Bible and Lord we've seen miracles in
[1:36:27] our own
[1:36:29] generation we've seen them through the
[1:36:31] ministry of a
[1:36:33] prophet and we know it's from
[1:36:37] you and Lord I believe you're coming
[1:36:41] soon I believe that day it gets closer
[1:36:44] by the
[1:36:46] minute Lord Jesus I pray we would not
[1:36:48] get stuck in
[1:36:51] religion I pray we would not get stuck
[1:36:53] in
[1:36:54] Pride Lord don't let us become
[1:36:57] Pharisees don't let us become
[1:37:01] cold Lord Jesus you brought us in our
[1:37:04] own lives from
[1:37:08] sin you brought us out of
[1:37:14] Babylon don't let us miss when you come
[1:37:16] Lord
[1:37:19] Jesus don't let us miss you
[1:37:22] Lord that's all that really matters is
[1:37:26] you
[1:37:27] Jesus that's all that really
[1:37:31] matters that's the only reason you sent
[1:37:34] all those
[1:37:36] prophets is to prepare the
[1:37:39] way and then you sent a man of God in
[1:37:42] this generation to forerun the second
[1:37:44] coming of Jesus Christ Lord I pray we
[1:37:46] wouldn't miss

[1:39:34] simplicity I was in Jeffersonville and I
[1:39:37] was in my
[1:39:40] backyard and uh we had a a staircase
[1:39:43] that
[1:39:45] went um to up to the second story in the
[1:39:49] backyard and and I was standing next to
[1:39:52] that staircase
[1:39:53] [Music]
[1:39:55] and I heard brother bradam say
[1:39:57] that he
[1:39:59] said how many from
[1:40:01] Jeffersonville he said maybe
[1:40:05] one and
[1:40:07] I it just was
[1:40:10] overtaken by that statement that he said
[1:40:12] and I I sat down on the
[1:40:15] stairs and I started praying I said
[1:40:22] Lord maybe
[1:40:26] one maybe one from this place and I know
[1:40:31] what brother Brandon was saying he
[1:40:32] wasn't telling us that there was only
[1:40:34] going to be one that came from
[1:40:35] Jeffersonville but he was telling us
[1:40:37] that it's going to be a very very few
[1:40:40] that find this and it's going to be a
[1:40:43] very few that are
[1:40:45] [Music]
[1:40:47] taken these are perilous times brother
[1:40:50] Leo as the Bible says this is not a time
[1:40:54] to take these things
[1:40:57] lightly now
[1:41:00] brother let me tell you a lot of work
[1:41:04] goes in to Preparing a sermon like this
[1:41:08] and how my brother went
[1:41:11] through and he brought in
[1:41:13] zerubabel and how zerubabel was in this
[1:41:16] line I believe of
[1:41:18] Judah the king brought him and he
[1:41:21] brought he was a leader that brought the
[1:41:23] people out and here comes these prophets
[1:41:26] and they're prophesying here is Hagi and
[1:41:28] Zachariah and Hagi is there and he is
[1:41:31] encouraging this
[1:41:33] zerubabel to go
[1:41:37] forward now the brother talked about
[1:41:39] Cyrus the king and how how they found
[1:41:41] these
[1:41:43] Scrolls of
[1:41:45] dasas and the decree that he
[1:41:48] issued what a what a what a book this
[1:41:52] book of Ezra is
[1:41:54] and how powerful this man was that he
[1:41:59] brought this
[1:42:01] message to the people and I loved my I
[1:42:05] loved a lot of what brother Josiah said
[1:42:08] but one thing that he started with he
[1:42:10] said he was just a normal
[1:42:12] man he said like the pastor
[1:42:15] here like any of us this man
[1:42:19] Ezra but brother Lyle he wrote these
[1:42:22] books and I believe that the reason that
[1:42:24] the Bible is put in this order is
[1:42:27] because he wrote 2 Chronicles then he
[1:42:29] writes Ezra and then Nehemiah comes and
[1:42:32] then it it goes to Esther and it goes
[1:42:36] through this time of this captivity and
[1:42:39] coming out of this captivity and then it
[1:42:41] goes into the poetic books which are job
[1:42:45] Psalms
[1:42:49] Proverbs just to think of Lord we get to
[1:42:54] live in a time like Ezra
[1:42:59] lived and here we are as brother Josiah
[1:43:02] talked about the main reason for this
[1:43:04] Temple it is not a temple made with
[1:43:07] hands anymore it is a temple of flesh
[1:43:09] and blood today and these temples need
[1:43:12] to be
[1:43:15] rebuilt into the image of Jesus
[1:43:19] Christ and that is how we have to live
[1:43:23] because he is coming soon as you said
[1:43:25] brother
[1:43:26] Josiah and we need to be ready because
[1:43:30] there will come a
[1:43:33] day when they
[1:43:35] say well we thought Elijah was supposed
[1:43:38] to come
[1:43:39] [Music]
[1:43:42] first and then the answer might come
[1:43:44] back he he came already and you missed
[1:43:47] him you weren't
[1:43:50] ready brothers and sisters we have a
[1:43:52] message that came to tell us to get
[1:43:57] ready for the coming of the
[1:43:59] Lord I I want to do everything that's in
[1:44:02] me to get ready do you appreciate our
[1:44:06] young brother young man studying and
[1:44:09] putting this

[1:44:14] lady right here and this young man right

[1:44:54] you and I just this morning earlier
[1:44:56] today there's these little things that

[1:55:24] [Music]
[1:55:28] amen who else will we pledge our
[1:55:29] allegiance to
[1:55:32] amen I believe um brother Lyle I was
[1:55:37] walking down I went to
[1:55:41] Jerusalem I know was probably four years
[1:55:45] ago now something like that and I was
[1:55:48] walking
[1:55:49] down the Mount of Olives and I saw a
[1:55:53] little hand painted
[1:55:55] sign there on the road and it said the
[1:55:58] Tomb of the
[1:56:01] prophets I walked in
[1:56:04] there and I believe it was
[1:56:08] Hagi
[1:56:10] Zachariah and Malachi is that right
[1:56:13] brother ly I think it was those
[1:56:16] three that were once buried in
[1:56:19] there and at least that's where they
[1:56:22] think that was but what struck me the
[1:56:26] most is where they were
[1:56:30] buried there were there were there were
[1:56:32] these tubes hollowed out where they
[1:56:35] would put the bodies but there were many
[1:56:38] many of these these graves in
[1:56:42] there and then there were two there were
[1:56:45] three different rooms and what struck me
[1:56:48] the most was those that really loved
[1:56:52] those those prophets were buried with
[1:56:54] them and it just it blessed me so much
[1:56:57] when I was there to see that and and to
[1:57:01] see now I know why that all three of
[1:57:03] them were together after
[1:57:08] today I'm sure
[1:57:10] that they all would have wanted to be in
[1:57:13] this day that we live in because this is
[1:57:17] the
[1:57:18] day that we don't see the first coming
[1:57:21] of Christ but this is is the day that we
[1:57:22] see the second coming of Christ and this
[1:57:25] is the day that it's all going to end
[1:57:28] that there will be no suffering there'll
[1:57:29] be no more shame and brother Leo he's
[1:57:33] going to have us all around his table
[1:57:37] and we're going to be weeping and and
[1:57:40] and all things are just going to be
[1:57:42] overwhelming and sister Shirley he's
[1:57:44] going to walk by and wipe these tears
[1:57:46] from our eyes that's going to be a
[1:57:49] glorious day I pray that every single
[1:57:51] one one of us is there on that day and

[1:57:58] bunch more let's all get a whole bunch
