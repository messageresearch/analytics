[29:29] Loaves and um I know it's short notice

[29:34] sing it I appreciate Daniel doing for
[29:38] that that for his dad and he has a he
[29:40] has such a good voice and
[29:43] um I uh I just really appreciated
[29:47] it if you continue to play well I'll
[29:49] read the scriptures John chapter 6
[29:51] verse1 says this and after these things
[29:54] Jesus Went Over the Sea of Galilee which
[29:56] is the Sea of t IUS when Jesus then
[29:59] lifted up his eyes and saw a great
[30:01] company come unto him he saith unto
[30:03] Phillip whence shall we buy bread that
[30:06] these may eat and he this he said to
[30:09] prove him for he himself knew what he
[30:12] would do Philip answered him 200 penny
[30:16] worth of bread is not sufficient for
[30:18] them that every one of them may take a
[30:20] little and of his disciples Andrew Simon
[30:23] Peter's brother saith unto him there's a
[30:26] lad here which hath five barley Loaves
[30:28] and two small fishes but what are they
[30:31] among so many and Jesus said make the
[30:34] men sit down now there was much grass in
[30:37] the place so the men sat down in number
[30:40] about
[30:42] 5,000 and Jesus Took the Loaves and when
[30:45] he had given thanks he distributed to
[30:47] the disciples and the disciples to them
[30:50] that were set down and likewise of the
[30:53] fishes as much as they would let's bow
[30:56] our heads
[30:58] Heavenly Father reading that
[31:01] story knowing Lord that that story is
[31:04] true and these things really
[31:07] happened father we pray that the same
[31:11] spirit that was on the hill that day on
[31:13] that grassy
[31:15] Hill when the Son of God multiplied the
[31:18] fishes and the loaves would be here with
[31:20] us
[31:21] today and Father may we have a better
[31:23] understanding of your word when we leave
[31:25] in Jesus name we pray
[31:28] amen God bless you you can take your
[31:32] seats thank
[31:35] you today I was talking with um Joe
[31:39] yesterday when we had lunch and we were
[31:43] talking about I mentioned to him and I
[31:45] was talking about some people and I kept
[31:47] calling him brother Joe and I said I
[31:49] said Joe the reason I call you brothers
[31:51] that's what they did in the
[31:53] Bible and what they were when when you
[31:57] come into fellowship with each other and
[32:00] we call each other brothers and sisters
[32:03] we are as close or we should be as close
[32:07] as family that love should be so strong
[32:13] between us we just say brother and
[32:15] sister maybe haphazardly as a title but
[32:19] we should really mean it how important
[32:23] are the people that that surround us and
[32:26] and how much love love that we should
[32:28] have for each other Jesus said when he
[32:30] was giving one of his final sermons he
[32:32] was talking to his disciples he said
[32:34] that the world would know that I'm the
[32:37] Messiah because of the love that you
[32:39] show for one another imagine how
[32:42] important it is to show that love so
[32:45] that when people come in and they visit
[32:47] they see that these people really love
[32:49] each other and we want to be part of
[32:51] that love that they have Daniel was
[32:55] Daniel and I were talking the other day
[32:58] and and he was praying for a friend that
[33:01] he has that's going through a hard
[33:03] time and he told me he said dad he said
[33:07] he says in the Bible it says that that
[33:09] we should pray and we should fast for
[33:13] one another and he says why aren't we
[33:16] doing that for for this brother that he
[33:19] was talking about he says he says why
[33:21] why am I not doing that why are we not
[33:23] going before the Lord and fasting and
[33:25] doing everything that we
[33:28] can so that the Lord will come in and
[33:30] answer our prayers we owe it to each
[33:33] other and I said Daniel that's exactly
[33:36] scriptural it says in our Bibles in
[33:38] Romans chapter 15 it says those of us
[33:41] that are strong should bear the
[33:44] infirmities of those that are weak and
[33:47] we shouldn't please
[33:49] ourselves so we should carry each
[33:53] other's burdens and yet most of the time
[33:57] we point out each other's
[33:59] faults it never does any
[34:03] good do you know friends as we're as
[34:06] we're seeing people in church and and
[34:10] maybe judging them do we know that
[34:13] person's inner thoughts Like Jesus Does
[34:16] do we know that person's inner struggles
[34:19] do we know that person's prayers do we
[34:22] know they
[34:23] suffering do we know the weight of guilt
[34:27] maybe that they're carrying do we know
[34:29] their illnesses cancer diabetes or or
[34:32] depression or even Suicidal Thoughts
[34:35] maybe do we know that and yet we take
[34:39] our relationships so
[34:44] haphazardly how about
[34:46] condemnation what if that person thinks
[34:49] that they can't be
[34:51] forgiven and how much would a a loving
[34:54] hand reaching out to that person how
[34:56] much would it mean to that person to say
[35:00] no brother sister you're not lost the
[35:03] just the desire in your heart to want to
[35:05] get right shows that you haven't gone
[35:07] too
[35:08] far
[35:11] or friends do I really care what they're
[35:13] going
[35:15] through and I look at look out on the
[35:19] audience right now and I see I see a lot
[35:22] of people who need something I see a lot
[35:25] of people who need a touch from the Lord
[35:27] but one thing that I see from every
[35:30] single person here is I see that every
[35:32] one of us has something to
[35:35] give to hear that song that Daniel that
[35:39] Daniel sang about the fishes and Loaves
[35:41] we all have something that we can offer
[35:43] up and it's not an offering to the Lord
[35:47] how do we serve God we serve his people
[35:50] so when we're serving each other that
[35:53] comes up that offering before the Lord
[35:56] and it is an offer offering to
[35:59] him and I think do we really care do we
[36:02] really care about each other after Jesus
[36:06] ascended and and Herod killed James
[36:10] John's
[36:11] brother ran him through with a sword
[36:14] Herod saw that it pleased the Jews so he
[36:17] put Peter in
[36:19] prison Acts chapter five Acts chapter
[36:23] 12 there's Peter in prison
[36:27] and the Bible says that prayer was made
[36:31] without ceasing for Peter amen can you
[36:35] imagine if we would do that as a
[36:37] congregation if somebody here needed
[36:40] prayer and there was always someone
[36:42] praying 24 hours a day seven days a week
[36:46] there was all always someone on their
[36:48] knees praying for this person and we
[36:51] wonder why things don't happen we wonder
[36:55] why that we don't see the Miracles that
[36:57] we saw in the book of Acts are we doing
[37:00] this all the time 24 hours a day someone
[37:04] is calling out this person's
[37:07] name
[37:09] amen prayer without ceasing and and
[37:12] Friends whatever it was whatever it took
[37:16] these people in the book of Acts they
[37:17] did it we want to see the gifts
[37:19] operating we want to see Miracles we
[37:22] want to see tongues we want to see all
[37:23] of these things that they saw in there
[37:25] but we're not willing for our own lives
[37:28] we're not willing to get on our knees
[37:30] and cry out to the Lord for our Brethren
[37:32] so why do we want the gifts is it just
[37:35] for
[37:36] us or is it for the people is it to
[37:39] glorify God through the people and to
[37:42] help each other and we see that I I was
[37:46] I was witnessing to someone the other
[37:48] day and he knew nothing about the Lord
[37:53] he had never he he when he grew up he
[37:56] didn't that he never went to church he
[37:58] never really considered God and and here
[38:01] I am talking with him and he's
[38:02] struggling with addiction and he wants
[38:05] the addiction more than he wants God and
[38:08] I can see that that's so often when when
[38:10] we want to give to the poor we can't
[38:12] give to them because they
[38:14] want to get strung out they want the
[38:17] drugs more than they want God and when
[38:19] you see when you read the Bible and when
[38:21] they gave to the poor these people
[38:22] needed it they were they were starving
[38:24] to
[38:25] death they they wanted to be healed they
[38:29] wanted to be delivered so that they
[38:31] could get up and work and the people
[38:33] today they don't want it but some do
[38:37] there are some and as I was talking to
[38:39] this
[38:41] man I was
[38:43] thinking so do you know the story of
[38:46] Christ he said well I've heard about
[38:47] Jesus people tell me tell me about him
[38:49] and and I said but do you really know
[38:51] what he stood for so we went through the
[38:54] when someone commits a crime that you
[38:57] always someone El always have to pay has
[38:59] to pay and I told him I said if you
[39:01] steal from me and you get away with it I
[39:04] have to pay it's going to cost me money
[39:07] and with sin that's how sin is when when
[39:10] you sin when you do something wrong
[39:12] someone has to pay and that man just
[39:14] happens to be Jesus Christ so we were
[39:16] talking about that and the thought came
[39:19] to my
[39:20] heart no one has probably ever prayed
[39:25] for this man
[39:27] no one has ever gone to the Lord on his
[39:30] behalf and it struck me I
[39:33] thought
[39:35] Lord he's never he's never had a mother
[39:38] praying for him he's never had a father
[39:40] praying for him a brother or a sister or
[39:42] someone on the street no one probably
[39:44] has ever prayed for this man and now
[39:47] here I
[39:48] am and what's my
[39:50] role brother Kurt it's not to bow down
[39:54] bow my head and say Lord help this man I
[39:56] pray pray and and give him Deliverance
[39:58] in Jesus name that's not a prayer amen
[40:01] that's just saying a few words maybe to
[40:03] make yourself feel better amen but what
[40:06] needs to be is I need to go to prayer
[40:10] Earnest prayer for this man in the
[40:13] privacy of my own home or where I am and
[40:15] cry out to the Lord for him say Lord
[40:18] have mercy and then that scripture the
[40:20] effectual effectual fervent prayer of a
[40:23] righteous man availeth much that's when
[40:26] we can count on things happening is when
[40:28] we bring that to the Lord but instead we
[40:30] have so many distractions we have so
[40:32] many things to do we
[40:34] have social media and we have the
[40:37] internet and we have YouTube and we have
[40:40] entertainment and television and all
[40:41] these things and what these things do
[40:44] now in this day that's never been before
[40:47] by the way it takes our time away from
[40:53] something else you're going to be doing
[40:55] something all the the time so if
[40:58] you're on the little square Idol and
[41:01] watching it and and looking it remember
[41:04] when you're looking at it it's taking
[41:06] time from something else not saying
[41:08] you're looking at anything wrong or
[41:10] whatever
[41:11] but that time could be spent doing
[41:15] something else and it could be spent
[41:18] fellowshipping friends could be spent
[41:21] studying the word it could be spent
[41:22] praying it's it could be spent doing
[41:24] something that's actually productive
[41:26] but nowadays the enemy has come in in
[41:29] his sness and pulled the gift of the
[41:34] people out of the church and replaced it
[41:38] with entertainment replaced it with a
[41:40] phone replaced it with a computer
[41:43] replaced it with a television replaced
[41:45] it with whatever he's replaced it with
[41:49] and we've Let each other
[41:51] down when I waste my time I'm man I'm
[41:56] letting you
[41:57] down because I could be going to the
[41:59] Lord on your behalf I could be reaching
[42:01] out could be just fellowshipping just
[42:04] talking we draw strength from each other
[42:08] but the enemy takes away our
[42:10] gift and then we should be bringing that
[42:13] gift in and helping others and and
[42:17] serving
[42:18] others and time that time spent away
[42:21] from God it hurts not only yourself
[42:25] we're all always thinking about
[42:27] ourselves it not only hurts you but it
[42:30] hurts other people too mothers it hurts
[42:33] your children yes it does fathers it
[42:36] hurts your wife it hurts your children
[42:39] yes it does to waste that time that you
[42:41] could be spending doing something
[42:43] productive bringing your gift to your
[42:47] family and a gift brothers and sisters a
[42:51] gift always costs you something today's
[42:55] my daughter's birthday
[42:57] and Stephanie and I we we send her a
[42:59] gift and
[43:02] um it costs us something to do that come
[43:06] out of the bank account sent it to her I
[43:10] can't just give a gift without me paying
[43:13] something it takes something from me
[43:16] there's a
[43:17] story fairy tale but it's it's a very
[43:21] good lesson about these Travelers that
[43:25] came to this Village and they in their
[43:27] wagon they come to this Village and they
[43:30] see the villagers maybe it's a church
[43:33] they come in and nobody greets them
[43:36] they're hungry they've been on the road
[43:38] for a long
[43:39] time nobody says hello they they they
[43:43] try to reach out and and they they get
[43:45] met with with a cold formal
[43:50] religion
[43:51] and the uh leader of the group he says
[43:54] well he says we'll take care of this
[43:56] so he gets his wagon and he has he has a
[43:58] big pot he drives his wagon down to the
[44:01] creek they fill up the pot with
[44:04] water they put it back in the wagon they
[44:08] uh they take one big Stone from the side
[44:12] of the creek they bring it up and they
[44:14] bring it up right into the middle of the
[44:16] village and they build a fire under this
[44:18] pot and they they um they take this
[44:21] Stone and they place it in the water and
[44:24] they start boiling the water
[44:27] villagers come
[44:28] by said what are you what are you
[44:31] doing and the man he's stirring his
[44:36] water and he says I'm making Stone Soup

[44:58] and the potatoes he gives them to the
[44:59] man he chops them up he puts them in the

[45:33] it's I want everybody to partake in it

[45:48] I've got some cuting let me go get them
[45:49] so he goes and gets them and he puts
[45:51] them in there keep stirring one after
[45:54] one the villagers come in and they say
[45:57] they say here here's this here's that
[45:59] here's potatoes here's celery here's
[46:01] everything the pot starts smelling good
[46:03] and the Roma starts going around the
[46:05] town and everybody starts looking
[46:07] forward to having this meal and he's in
[46:09] there and he's still stirring and maybe
[46:11] some come and say uh what are you making
[46:15] he says Stone Soup um but and we're all
[46:19] putting in and maybe the person says
[46:20] well I don't have
[46:21] anything I don't have we don't have any
[46:24] food at home we're hungry
[46:26] um I don't have anything to offer and
[46:28] the man stirring the pot stands back and
[46:30] he looks up underneath he says my fire
[46:32] is getting low he says can you go out
[46:35] into the woods and can you get some
[46:37] sticks to put under this and and keep
[46:39] the fire going he says I can do that I
[46:42] can do that so he goes out this family
[46:44] this poor family goes out and they they
[46:46] bring in the sticks and they keep the
[46:47] fire going and the pot cooking and then
[46:50] they all
[46:51] partake of the Stone Soup they take the
[46:55] stone out out throw it away not edible
[46:58] it didn't matter but everyone
[47:01] gave everyone participated in this and
[47:05] everyone the whole church was
[47:08] blessed but
[47:10] instead so many times we're not willing
[47:14] to give whatever you have whatever you
[47:17] have got to contribute to this to this
[47:20] work do it and then God will multiply it
[47:24] as as the man with the stone
[47:27] soup beautiful
[47:30] type of how God can use a church to feed
[47:37] the whole church but we all have to make
[47:39] a sacrifice as I said gifts don't come
[47:42] without a sacrifice we do hear a lot of
[47:45] times from the pulpit these Prosperity
[47:48] Gospel preachers and they get up there
[47:50] and they say if you give $1,000 then I
[47:53] promise you then he will God will
[47:55] multiply quiet by 10 praise God praise
[47:57] the Lord it goes that past past the
[47:59] thing and put your rings in there and
[48:00] your watches and everything and you
[48:02] watch how God will just pour it out
[48:04] that's false let me tell you if you
[48:07] give it's a
[48:10] sacrifice you give to let it go you give
[48:15] to contribute and you don't want it back
[48:20] but you will receive it back you'll
[48:22] receive a blessing from doing it but you
[48:25] you don't just give you don't make a
[48:27] deal with God say if I give $1,000 to
[48:30] this Lord you'll give me a better job
[48:32] that's not how God works Simon the
[48:34] Sorcerer one time he came to the to the
[48:37] disciples and he saw how these disciples
[48:40] how they could lay their hands on
[48:42] someone and then the holy spirit of God
[48:45] would enter that person that person
[48:47] would speak in tongues and that person
[48:49] would do Miracles and he saw this and he
[48:51] said
[48:52] wow I could use something like that
[48:56] in my Ministry I could use something
[48:58] like that so why don't I hey Peter come
[49:02] here here's the deal I want to do what
[49:05] you're doing because see I got this i
[49:08] got this ministry and uh it would really
[49:10] help me out it really give me a more
[49:13] standing with the people if I had that
[49:15] gift here's here's a thousand bucks you
[49:18] give that gift to me to where I can lay
[49:20] my hands on people and they will receive
[49:22] the Holy Spirit Peter said let me read
[49:25] what Peter
[49:27] said I'll quote
[49:32] him Peter said to
[49:35] him
[49:37] acts
[49:39] 8:20 Peter said unto him thy money
[49:42] perish with thee because thou has
[49:44] thought that the gift of God may be
[49:45] purchased with money thou has neither
[49:48] part nor lot in this matter for thine
[49:51] heart is not right in the sight of God
[49:53] repent therefore of this wickedness and
[49:55] pray God if perhaps the thought of thine
[49:59] heart may be forgiven thee he says Simon
[50:03] you need to pray to be forgiven for even
[50:06] the thought of doing that for I perceive
[50:10] that thou art in the gall of bitterness
[50:13] and in the bond of iniquity then
[50:15] answered Simon and said pray ye to the
[50:18] Lord for me that none of these things
[50:20] which you have spoken come unto me so we
[50:25] don't give to
[50:28] receive we give because we have the
[50:31] spirit of Christ in us and we give out
[50:34] so That Others May Prosper there's a
[50:39] story the Bible about a young
[50:43] lady she knew of this man Jesus
[50:48] Christ she had heard him preach and she
[50:53] knew that he was sent to the lost and
[50:55] she saw how his ministry blessed the
[50:59] people and she saw this love come come
[51:01] from him and she was just overwhelmed at
[51:05] his goodness and she thought if I could
[51:07] just do something for him if I could
[51:09] just give him a gift she was a
[51:12] prostitute she took her money that she
[51:15] had made and she went to the store and
[51:19] she bought a very expensive we call it
[51:22] the alabaster box of oil
[51:25] and she wanted so bad to give this gift
[51:30] to Jesus so Jesus was on the
[51:34] road all day and it's hot back then he
[51:38] he he comes into the house and back then
[51:40] that they would come in and they'd be
[51:42] they would wash their feet wash maybe
[51:45] their face and get cleaned up and then
[51:47] have dinner and he was at this Pharisees
[51:49] house he comes in Pharisee didn't think
[51:53] much of Jesus he wanted to embarrass him
[51:55] maybe Jesus comes in and doesn't wash
[52:00] his feet doesn't get to wash his face
[52:03] and anoint his hair with the oil he goes
[52:06] in and he sits
[52:08] down this lady she somehow sees inside
[52:12] the house The
[52:14] Prostitute as one that no one would ever
[52:16] want to be around no no one would ever
[52:18] give her any respect but she had a
[52:20] burden to do something she wanted to
[52:23] serve him whatever she could do
[52:26] so she sees him there in the house and
[52:28] and she sees how he's still dirty and
[52:30] she sees all the other people are clean
[52:32] why could why why did you do that don't
[52:35] you know what he's
[52:37] done she comes into the house and takes
[52:40] her very expensive it was probably
[52:42] $1,000 or more in today's money takes
[52:47] this alabaster box of oil goes to Jesus
[52:51] and anoints his head his hair with oil
[52:56] and she falls down at his
[52:59] feet and she just starts weeping because
[53:02] she knows that salvation is there
[53:04] standing sitting there in front of her
[53:06] in the
[53:08] chair and the Pharisees are looking down
[53:10] and they see this woman this nasty woman
[53:13] that that they knew where she'd
[53:15] been even the disciples look down must
[53:19] have been Judas looked down and said
[53:21] that's expensive stuff why didn't she
[53:23] just take that money sell that box take
[53:26] that money and we could feed the
[53:28] poor he didn't care he was looking down
[53:31] on this woman in fact right after this
[53:34] story is when Judas left to betray Jesus
[53:38] and must have clicked in his mind that
[53:41] must have just been just put him over
[53:44] the edge about this man Jesus so there
[53:46] she is she takes this oil she's down
[53:48] there and she's washing his feet not
[53:52] with water that was provided but she's
[53:54] crying
[53:56] and her tears are coming down and and
[53:58] washing his feet and her hair she she
[54:00] didn't have a towel so she takes her
[54:02] hair and she cleans his feet and dries
[54:05] it off she had something to give and she
[54:08] gave
[54:10] everything and we see how many people
[54:13] around in that
[54:17] day nothing they wouldn't give anything
[54:19] they weren't willing to to at all serve
[54:21] this man Jesus but she knew that life
[54:26] was in this man and watch her reward
[54:31] Matthew chapter 26 says this verse
[54:36] 12 for in that she hath Jesus talking he
[54:40] says that he when when Judas or whoever
[54:43] it was said that that you should have
[54:46] just sold this and give it to the poor
[54:48] Jesus said the poor you will always have
[54:51] with you but look what she did for in
[54:54] that she hath poured this ointment on my
[54:57] body she did it for my
[55:00] burial within a few days within a few
[55:03] days Jesus was going to be on the cross
[55:06] within just a few days he was going to
[55:08] be on the cross dying and then dead and
[55:12] laying in a
[55:13] tomb they anointed the bodies with oils
[55:16] back then so they wouldn't smell bad and
[55:19] and that they could that was the
[55:20] embalming way that they did it and he
[55:22] said he said for in that sheath poured
[55:24] this ointment on my body she did it for
[55:26] my burial verily I say unto you
[55:29] wheresoever this gospel shall be
[55:31] preached in the whole world there shall
[55:34] also this that this woman what this
[55:37] woman has
[55:39] done shall be told for a memorial of
[55:42] herj am how would you like to go down in
[55:45] history being someone like that God she
[55:48] gave everything that she had she was
[55:51] living a life that obviously was bad and
[55:54] and she knew it she was stuck in her sin
[55:58] she didn't know how to get out but she
[56:00] saw that that man there's something
[56:02] about him that I can get out of
[56:07] it and recorded in the Book of John and
[56:12] how many people have read that over the
[56:14] past 2,000 years and again I fulfill
[56:16] that scripture i f fulfill that prophecy
[56:18] this morning and telling that
[56:21] story how much does god require of us I
[56:25] think his brother Josiah said just now
[56:28] whatever you'll give
[56:29] him so I asked Daniel to sing that song
[56:33] about that
[56:35] boy that came to Jesus on those days and
[56:39] what had happened was Jesus was
[56:42] sad he was sad because his cousin his
[56:47] friend the Forerunner of the ministry of
[56:52] Jesus Christ this man named John the
[56:54] Baptist had just been
[56:57] murdered his head cut off his body
[56:59] desecrated his head cut off and set on a
[57:03] platter and brought into the court and
[57:06] made fun of
[57:08] him the greatest Prophet that had ever
[57:10] walked the Earth and there they were
[57:13] making fun of the man with his head on
[57:15] this
[57:17] platter Jesus must have really hurt him
[57:21] so he went up tried to get away
[57:25] from the people he had just been doing
[57:27] all these Miracles and and preaching the
[57:30] gospel and he wanted to get away maybe
[57:32] in
[57:33] more walked up to this hill as I as I
[57:37] read earlier it's a grassy area I've
[57:39] been to the place that they say that it
[57:43] happened and it's a it's a place it is
[57:46] it's a grassy area that you can sit up
[57:48] on the hill and then you can look look
[57:50] over the Sea of Galilee and there he was
[57:53] and and he's walking away way and
[57:55] there's no towns near there there's no
[57:57] place really he wanted to just get
[57:59] private but the people had seen all of
[58:02] these Miracles that he was doing they
[58:04] had seen the the the deaf hear and the
[58:08] blind see and they wanted more and Jesus
[58:11] was walking away and here come all of
[58:15] the
[58:16] people and Jesus goes to Philip and he
[58:20] says Phillip and he knew the answer
[58:23] Jesus already knew what he was going
[58:24] going to do he said Phillip he says
[58:27] Where can we get food for these people
[58:30] Philip's like he says it would cost
[58:33] thousands of dollars just to give them
[58:35] just a little morsel of food there's no
[58:37] way we can do them and the disciples are
[58:39] like hey just send them away because
[58:41] they're tired send them away Jesus and
[58:44] but there was a
[58:46] boy there was a young man and that young
[58:50] man had a had compassion he wanted to do
[58:54] something yes he did he must have known
[58:56] he must have
[58:57] seen just maybe a few days earlier a man
[59:02] that was blind that was out of his mind
[59:05] that couldn't talk that couldn't hear he
[59:08] must have seen that man come back into
[59:11] his his normal mind and start seeing and
[59:14] start start conversing and and come back
[59:18] he must have seen the man with the
[59:20] withered hand he must have seen the
[59:23] strength come back in his hand he must
[59:24] have seen the man at the pool of
[59:26] Bethesda or at least his parents T told
[59:28] him about it the man at the pool of
[59:29] Bethesda that was always so sick when
[59:32] the waters would churn and he couldn't
[59:33] get up and move fast enough to get in
[59:35] the water and yet Jesus came to him and
[59:38] healed him this boy knew about all of
[59:40] that because that's why all these people
[59:42] were coming so he comes and he sees and
[59:46] he maybe he heard Jesus say how are we
[59:48] going to feed all of these people am so
[59:52] he comes to Andrew
[59:55] and he says says sir he
[59:58] says I have two fish and Five Loaves you
[1:00:04] know what a loaf was was like a cracker
[1:00:07] it's not a loaf like we think it's just
[1:00:08] a little piece of
[1:00:10] bread and he had this and and this was
[1:00:13] this was his lunch and let me ask you
[1:00:15] something there was there was thousands
[1:00:18] upon thousands of people there do you
[1:00:19] think he was the only one that had
[1:00:22] food no there there's no way but he was
[1:00:26] the only one that was willing to give
[1:00:27] what he
[1:00:28] had how many people in that crowd had
[1:00:32] their lunches how many people were not
[1:00:35] willing to share but this little boy
[1:00:38] sees I've got to do something and in his
[1:00:40] innocence he comes to Andrew and he says
[1:00:43] here take my
[1:00:45] lunch this is all that I have can you
[1:00:49] imagine it's all that he
[1:00:51] had and he was willing to give it
[1:00:55] Andrew takes this ridiculous little
[1:00:58] lunch the Bible even says they were
[1:00:59] little fish they're probably like
[1:01:01] sardines dried
[1:01:03] sardines Andrew takes it to
[1:01:07] Jesus and he says well somebody his kid
[1:01:10] gave us his lunch and he even said he's
[1:01:14] like but what good is it with all of
[1:01:17] this what good is this little bit of
[1:01:20] food that this young man gave it doesn't
[1:01:24] mean anything but Jesus knew what was
[1:01:27] going to happen but he wanted that gift
[1:01:31] someone had to give you think your gift
[1:01:34] isn't isn't enough you think you don't
[1:01:37] have something to
[1:01:38] give everyone here everyone in this room
[1:01:42] without exception has more than that
[1:01:44] little boy
[1:01:46] had and yet he took it and if you give
[1:01:50] it to Jesus you Watch What Happens
[1:01:52] notice when he gave it to Andrew nothing
[1:01:54] happen
[1:01:55] happen it had to go to
[1:01:59] Jesus so he gives it he gives it to the
[1:02:02] Lord Jesus Takes it and somehow some way
[1:02:06] he starts breaking this and all of a
[1:02:08] sudden there's all of this food and this
[1:02:11] food is he tells his disciples he's like
[1:02:13] come over here set them down in groups
[1:02:15] of
[1:02:16] 50 maybe 50 here 50 here 50 here
[1:02:20] thousands upon thousands of people and
[1:02:22] he sets them down he prays over it they
[1:02:24] take the food and it's just one fish
[1:02:26] after the next and one piece of bread
[1:02:28] after the next and they start giving it
[1:02:30] to the
[1:02:31] people feeding
[1:02:34] them in another
[1:02:37] testimony Jesus looked out on the people
[1:02:39] he did it again by the
[1:02:41] way he looked out on the people and he
[1:02:44] had compassion on them he was sad
[1:02:46] because they were
[1:02:47] hungry and that's us do we have the same
[1:02:51] Spirit of Christ where everything that
[1:02:53] that is going going wrong that we see
[1:02:55] and we have compassion and we're willing
[1:02:57] to give whatever we have and one thing
[1:03:00] that we all
[1:03:01] have that we don't give is our
[1:03:05] time we won't get on our knees and cry
[1:03:08] out for someone we won't fast for that
[1:03:11] person we won't give what we have we'll
[1:03:14] just bow our heads and say Lord help
[1:03:15] this person now I did it check that box
[1:03:18] didn't hear that prayer that wasn't
[1:03:22] sincere maybe it was just so you could
[1:03:24] say prayed for
[1:03:26] him do you really the Bible says go into
[1:03:30] the
[1:03:32] closet and pray in
[1:03:36] secret and then God will reward you
[1:03:41] openly he's not talking about exalting
[1:03:44] you no he's talking about answering your
[1:03:47] prayers if you really have a burden for
[1:03:50] someone you go into that PR prayer
[1:03:52] closet and you're asking the Lord Lord
[1:03:54] Lord help this person I'll do whatever
[1:03:56] it takes and you stay there and you pray
[1:03:58] and you pray and you pray then all of a
[1:04:00] sudden he gets
[1:04:02] healed all of a sudden they change their
[1:04:04] lives around all of a sudden the drugs
[1:04:06] they don't want the drugs anymore all of
[1:04:09] a sudden the kids start coming back into
[1:04:12] the
[1:04:13] family and what was it because you
[1:04:16] prayed and God requires that so here's
[1:04:20] Jesus and they're passing all of this
[1:04:22] food out and here's that boy
[1:04:24] I would have loved to seen that kid I'd
[1:04:28] have loved to stand next to him say come
[1:04:30] here buddy stand here
[1:04:33] look that was your
[1:04:36] lunch you did that
[1:04:41] amen and he'll do
[1:04:44] it the Bible says in the book of Hebrews
[1:04:48] chapter
[1:04:50] 13:8 it says Jesus Christ is the same
[1:04:53] yesterday today and forever that same
[1:04:56] Jesus Christ that multiplied those
[1:04:58] fishes and the loaves is the same Jesus
[1:05:01] Christ here that if we will just bring
[1:05:03] what we have to him and give it to him
[1:05:06] then he will multiply it and things will
[1:05:10] change how can we call ourselves
[1:05:12] Christians if we're not doing
[1:05:14] that a Christian is the greatest thing
[1:05:18] if you if you want to pay me a
[1:05:20] compliment call me a Christian because
[1:05:23] it's the greatest thing that I think
[1:05:25] that you could ever call me because my
[1:05:27] roots go back to the ones that this
[1:05:31] Bible was written about and I can set my
[1:05:35] name with those people on being a
[1:05:39] Christian so he fed all of these
[1:05:43] thousands of people and here's the boy
[1:05:47] like
[1:05:48] whoa
[1:05:50] yes that's my
[1:05:52] lunch so he's he's he's standing there
[1:05:55] maybe and and all of the people are
[1:05:58] eating and the miracle was seen by all
[1:06:02] of these people now look what happened
[1:06:04] John chapter
[1:06:07] 6 verse
[1:06:11] 12 when they were
[1:06:13] filled he said unto his disciples gather
[1:06:16] up the fragments that remain that
[1:06:18] nothing be
[1:06:19] lost therefore they gathered them
[1:06:22] together and filled 12 baskets
[1:06:24] loads with the fragments of the five
[1:06:27] barley loads which remained over and
[1:06:28] above them that had
[1:06:32] eaten and then those men this is the
[1:06:36] most by the
[1:06:39] way everybody everybody's attention this
[1:06:41] is the most important part of the whole
[1:06:43] story right here because those people
[1:06:46] got hungry
[1:06:48] again those people they eventually they
[1:06:51] got sick and they died even after all of
[1:06:52] the Miracles every everything that this
[1:06:55] was was an amazing experience but it was
[1:06:58] just a
[1:06:59] meal but watch the purpose behind the
[1:07:03] meal
[1:07:04] right then those
[1:07:06] men talking about all of these thousands
[1:07:09] of
[1:07:10] people when they had seen the miracle
[1:07:12] that Jesus did said this is of a truth
[1:07:17] that Prophet that should
[1:07:19] come into the world this is of a truth
[1:07:22] that that that Prophet should come into
[1:07:25] the world that Prophet is the
[1:07:29] Messiah so here they are they had done
[1:07:32] all the Miracles and and seen everything
[1:07:34] that they they they had seen and they're
[1:07:36] like okay well he's a prophet he's a
[1:07:38] great man maybe he's Elijah maybe he's
[1:07:40] re John the Baptist reincarnated maybe
[1:07:42] he's some great man and then they say
[1:07:45] whoa this is that
[1:07:49] Prophet this is that Messiah from this
[1:07:56] boy giving something that none of us
[1:07:59] would think was important giving his
[1:08:03] lunch helping
[1:08:07] out you think but my little
[1:08:12] gift what could it
[1:08:15] do well all I have brother Daniel all I
[1:08:18] have is I don't have any money to give I
[1:08:20] don't I don't have anything else do you
[1:08:22] have time
[1:08:24] do you have a closet that you can go
[1:08:27] into and
[1:08:28] pray let me tell you God will honor that
[1:08:32] more than all the millions of dollars
[1:08:34] that you could give it would be that
[1:08:36] prayer time crying out to the Lord with
[1:08:38] a sincere
[1:08:40] heart that is what God honors is a
[1:08:44] sincere heart like that little
[1:08:46] boy and in closing the musicians can can
[1:08:52] come
[1:08:54] think
[1:08:56] about the one that really didn't have
[1:08:59] anything to
[1:09:01] give this man Jesus
[1:09:03] Christ he had a he had a garment that
[1:09:07] was an expensive garment that someone
[1:09:09] probably had given him and it was a
[1:09:10] garment that was that was woven without
[1:09:13] a seam was nice he probably was proud of
[1:09:18] this garment that he had poor living
[1:09:21] living with what he did and
[1:09:25] coming to the
[1:09:28] Cross everything had been taken from him
[1:09:31] and even right at the end this garment
[1:09:35] that he had was even taken that was
[1:09:38] taken from
[1:09:39] him taken down there and and here's
[1:09:42] these Ro these these evil disgusting
[1:09:45] Roman soldiers drinking and and gambling
[1:09:49] and gambling over this garment that the
[1:09:53] Lord Jesus had was taken from
[1:09:55] [Music]
[1:09:56] him he goes
[1:09:59] up to the cross the Bible says that all
[1:10:03] he had to
[1:10:04] do was Dash his foot against a stone
[1:10:08] just stump his toe and the angels would
[1:10:11] come and help he said if he would if he
[1:10:15] would just cast himself off of a cliff
[1:10:18] the Angels would grab him and bear him
[1:10:21] up this is a man that had all power over
[1:10:26] everything the very power of the Father
[1:10:30] God himself was in this man Jesus
[1:10:34] Christ and what gift did he
[1:10:37] have he didn't have money he didn't even
[1:10:41] have a
[1:10:42] lunch he didn't have any clothes to get
[1:10:45] they nailed him to the cross up there
[1:10:48] naked even his dignity was
[1:10:51] gone and here he is
[1:10:55] and for me and I hope for you
[1:10:59] too he gave his
[1:11:01] gift he gave his
[1:11:03] [Music]
[1:11:05] life because remember someone has to
[1:11:09] pay and he did and there's Jesus Christ
[1:11:13] up
[1:11:16] there said father forgive them they
[1:11:19] don't know they don't know what they're
[1:11:20] doing and he says father into thy hands
[1:11:25] I commit my spirit not the man that put
[1:11:28] me on the cross not the Roman soldiers
[1:11:31] not the FES and Sadducees none of them
[1:11:34] he said Here I Am Lord I give you my
[1:11:37] life because he could have taken it
[1:11:40] back and there he was he gives it on the
[1:11:45] cross and
[1:11:46] now we can all
[1:11:50] eat of this Stone Soup we can we can all
[1:11:53] eat of the glory of God we can all eat
[1:11:56] of all of his blessings because he gave
[1:12:02] [Music]
[1:12:04] it you think that maybe that your gift
[1:12:07] doesn't mean anything First Corinthians
[1:12:10] I'll close with
[1:12:11] this 1 Corinthians chapter
[1:12:14] 15 verse 57 and
[1:12:18] 58 I was
[1:12:20] down many times over the years
[1:12:25] and tell my wife I I just don't I don't
[1:12:28] think
[1:12:29] that anything that I'm doing
[1:12:32] matters and just the sadness of just
[1:12:35] somebody that that's really just broken
[1:12:38] and and and feels that he's worthless
[1:12:41] and and can't make a difference in
[1:12:43] anything and there was me there was that
[1:12:46] man and my blessed
[1:12:49] wife reads this scripture to
[1:12:52] me but but thanks be to
[1:12:55] God which giveth us the victory through
[1:12:59] our Lord Jesus Christ therefore my
[1:13:02] beloved
[1:13:03] Brethren be
[1:13:05] steadfast
[1:13:07] unmovable always abounding in the work
[1:13:09] of the Lord for as much as you know that
[1:13:14] your labor is not in vain in the
[1:13:20] Lord if you have something to give give
[1:13:25] it give your time give your life give
[1:13:28] your
[1:13:30] testimony give it because if it's given
[1:13:32] with a sincere heart if it's given if
[1:13:34] it's truly given then God will take it
[1:13:38] and he will multiply it like he
[1:13:40] multiplied the fish like he multiplied
[1:13:43] the loaves he will take your efforts if
[1:13:47] they're
[1:13:49] sincere and he will bless it
[1:13:54] like you will never
[1:13:55] imagine but he
[1:13:57] requires he required that
[1:14:01] boy to have a to have a
[1:14:05] burden and to give his
[1:14:07] lunch
[1:14:09] Andrew and Andrew took it and gave it to
[1:14:12] the
[1:14:13] Lord now one of the most known stories
[1:14:17] ever it's one of the greatest stories
[1:14:18] that's ever been
[1:14:20] told is that story of the fish in the
[1:14:24] loaves brother Josiah if you could sing
[1:14:31] Daniel giving my life
[1:14:34] away um that's fine do you want that's
[1:14:37] fine before I knew brother Daniel was
[1:14:39] going to preach what he preached the
[1:14:41] Lord laid this on my heart and it says
[1:14:43] the very least I can offer is my
[1:14:47] all let's sing this together first
[1:14:49] [Music]
[1:14:52] verse and I've seen a
[1:14:55] vision harsh and
[1:14:59] sweet of one who gave all he had for
[1:15:06] me I've seen the
[1:15:10] passion of his
[1:15:13] death and the
[1:15:16] Forgiveness of his
[1:15:20] final and now I can ever be the
[1:15:26] same for my heart has been
[1:15:31] forever
[1:15:34] change I've got to live and love and
[1:15:40] give the way he
[1:15:43] [Music]
[1:15:47] gave and now I'm giving my life for
[1:15:54] [Music]
[1:15:56] way laying it down on the
[1:16:01] altar now I'm giving my life
[1:16:09] away the very least I can
[1:16:15] offer is
[1:16:18] [Music]
[1:16:21] my so here I stand
[1:16:24] [Music]
[1:16:26] today giving my life
[1:16:30] away no earthly
[1:16:34] price and no earthly price could be too
[1:16:40] great and no
[1:16:43] sacrifice too much to
[1:16:47] make no way of
[1:16:51] measuring the
[1:16:54] crost next to the blood of
[1:17:00] calary and so if I live I live for
[1:17:06] him or if I die I count it

[1:18:16] Bible and it's it's wonderful it has
[1:18:21] just beautiful stories in it can you
[1:18:26] imagine if it wasn't just any more us
[1:18:29] reading it but it really became real to
[1:18:34] us that we really decided Lord I am
[1:18:38] going to give my life to you I'm going
[1:18:41] to do it I'm not going to continue
[1:18:45] on being just this lukewarm
[1:18:50] Christian I'm going to do what it says
[1:18:53] I am going to
[1:18:55] be that man that has that effectual
[1:18:59] fervent
[1:19:01] prayer I'm going to be that person that
[1:19:04] gives my my little bit of lunch to the
[1:19:09] Lord I
[1:19:10] remember when uh Stephanie and I were
[1:19:14] just married before we were married a
[1:19:17] friend of mine Royce Hyde and I we
[1:19:19] wanted to do something for the Lord so
[1:19:20] what we decided is we're going to skip a
[1:19:23] meal once a
[1:19:24] week and uh I was married and it was um
[1:19:29] we figured 35
[1:19:30] bucks was what we're going to take and
[1:19:33] we're going to take that money we're
[1:19:34] going to fast that that meal we're going
[1:19:37] to take that money that we would have
[1:19:39] spent eating and we were going to put it
[1:19:41] into the service of the Lord
[1:19:44] somehow and we did that and I think that
[1:19:47] they're still doing it today and this is
[1:19:48] like 20 years later more than 20 years
[1:19:52] later
[1:19:53] where they they take a little bit of
[1:19:56] money every month and they put it into
[1:19:59] the work of the Lord
[1:20:01] somehow imagine if we would do that not
[1:20:03] only with monetary things but imagine if
[1:20:06] we would really do it with our whole
[1:20:09] lives if we would do it with our prayers
[1:20:11] with our time with our
[1:20:13] words imagine the change the difference
[1:20:16] that we can make I think that what this
[1:20:20] boy
[1:20:21] did that day on that Hill would pale in
[1:20:25] comparison to what we could do as a body
[1:20:28] of Believers think
[1:20:30] about they're getting the food ready
[1:20:35] outside and this called the pot luck
[1:20:39] everybody brings stuff everybody there
[1:20:43] there's they've brought soup they've
[1:20:45] brought desserts they've bought bread
[1:20:48] they've brought drinks imagine if we had
[1:20:51] all of the soup and we didn't have any
[1:20:54] [Music]
[1:20:58] bows it'd be
[1:21:02] gross imagine if we had all of the bread
[1:21:05] and all the desserts but we didn't have
[1:21:07] plates to put it on imagine if we didn't
[1:21:10] have
[1:21:11] drinks everything is working together
[1:21:14] but we all have a different gift to
[1:21:18] bring so bring your
[1:21:21] gift Brothers sisters bring your gift
[1:21:24] bring your gift to Jesus remember if you
[1:21:28] brought it to Andrew Andrew still had it
[1:21:31] to bring to Jesus so just skip
[1:21:34] Andrew go right to Jesus and then let
[1:21:38] him multiply the fishes and the loaves
