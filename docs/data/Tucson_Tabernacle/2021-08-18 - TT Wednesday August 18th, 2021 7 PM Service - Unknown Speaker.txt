father help me as i speak lord may my words be set aside and may it be your words i ask in the name of the lord jesus i pray amen god bless you all you can take your seats it's good to be here i appreciate brother aaron and and the brothers asking me to come minister and uh giving me an opportunity to come before you it's good it's good to be here it's good to see my aunt jacqueline back there she's uh she's special to me but she's uh jacqueline has had some wonderful experiences in life if you don't know my aunt jacqueline she's been she was a piano player when she was a young lady for brother branham she um her dad my grandpa was a deacon in brother branham's church jacqueline was there when the church ages were spelled out on the side of the wall of the branham tabernacle so she witnessed that she witnessed brother way losing his life in a heart attack and then being raised up we've heard it on tape my aunt jaclyn was there so it's it's good to have you and i'd like to talk with some of maybe the experiences that some of these folks have had um and when i come when i minister friends i don't i don't want to just come here and and minister just to say something that maybe would encourage you or or to get up here and and try to expound maybe on the word for my own self but what i want to happen is when i when i leave i want you to be closer to the lord i believe that's that's the role for every minister for every pastor for every evangelist whatever it might be is not to introduce the congregation to ourselves to not point people to ourselves or to take the spotlight but to develop a closer relationship between the congregation and the lord jesus that was that was brother branham's role and and how what a wonderful person brother branham was and i want to talk about a few things that that he did but ultimately his goal was to introduce us to the lord jesus we know that god sent a prophet that doesn't do us any good because the devil knows that too but if we know jesus christ then then that is the main thing brother um i'll start i would like to read that quote brother peter if you could put that that quote up on it from the church age book right at the end brother branham preached brother branham wrote this masterpiece called the church ages an exposition of the seven church ages he went through all of his doctrine through the church ages he he talked about serpent seed he talked about marriage and divorce he talked about all of these great doctrines that he brought out as the seventh messenger and this is how he closed that book of the church ages he says here he says not for one moment do i bring a message to the people that they may follow me or join my church or start some fellowship and organization i have never done that and will do not do that now i have no interest in those things but i do have an interest in the things of god and people and if i can accomplish just one thing i will be satisfied now this is the seventh angel message you're talking and if he says if i can just accomplish one thing then i will be satisfied in my ministry everything that i've done if i can just accomplish one thing that one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between god and men wherein men become new creations in christ filled with his spirit and live according to his word that is the role of a true minister of the gospel is to introduce that person to the lord jesus christ and then you step back and then god deals with the individual and you're there to help where you can but you want that that relationship and if that minister takes that relationship if he gets in there between christ and man it becomes the nicolaitan spirit and friends that nicolette and spirit it might be a very loving and sweet we think of we think of it as the pope and hitting the people over the head with a hammer that's not that's not the nicolaitan spirit is as we know it it's a very sweet spirit but it's deceiving and it takes away our relationship with the lord jesus um as i said myan jacqueline there she was a piano player in uh in the bram tabernacle one time jacqueline and my mom they got to go up to mount limit with brother branham they they had moved out here these young ladies they had moved out here and brother branham took his time in sister branham and took my mom and aunt jacqueline up to mount lemmon and he spent his time with them and they just thought he was he was such a great person and i grew up hearing these stories about brother branham and and how special he was and and what a great man he was my my dad as you know if you've listened to many tapes you've heard brother brown talk about brother evans and the times that he had with with brother evans and in the closeness that they had both of my grandpas wheeler and evans were on the mountain with brother branham when he spoke the storm away my my grandpa evans was just a 100 yards or so away from him when that storm came in and brother branham spoke that stormroy and we we see these great miracles but with brother branham it wasn't the reason he was so special it wasn't because of the miracles you know and that jacqueline can attest to this it wasn't the miracles that they saw and they saw some and it wasn't his command of the scriptures and i'm sorry i'm doing something wrong with this mic is that better my friend um and it wasn't even his command of the scriptures brother branham understood the scriptures very very well and he had these great revelations but that isn't why the people thought so much of him there was something different about him so much so that some people would even they would see this this this man and how he would act and they would even say well this has to be jesus christ returned because of because of the way he acted because of the spirit that he had it was an easy mistake to make the apostle john made the same mistake in the book of revelation when he saw the angel he fell down in worship and the angel is like no no no get up he must have had a had a great spirit that angel must have brother branham had that spirit where people just loved him and what was it why was it so different than everybody else and friends that's what i want to talk about today is is christ's prayer for the church and how we should be how each of us should be brother branham had that spirit that he could he could meet you and you just fell in love with him and you would do anything that he said and just anything that he would say you'd believe it and and you'd put him in this place and we see that spirit in other places peter when peter when he had the holy spirit he would just walk by someone and just his shadow casting across someone they would be healed imagine how they thought about peter and how great this man was and then the spirit would come forth and friends that is the church that needs to be in this day and i'm going to close with the scripture tonight i want to lay a foundation for it and i'm going to close with the scripture tonight that i pray that you will be thinking about always for the rest of your life because jesus prays and he says lord i want this church and i want to lay a foundation for that there's a there's a lady in jeffersonville her name's shirley knoll jacqueline do you know shirley noll you you like her like she'd say no uh sister shirley um she knew a young man named garnet peak garnet peak have y'all heard um there there's a sermon it was once called garnet peaks funeral now it's called i am the resurrection and life and it's about a young man who had polio and and he passed away when not only 16 or 17 years old and brother brandon priest's funeral but there's a story behind this garnet peak young man garnet got sick of polio and he lived down in a place called acton kentucky and i don't know it's maybe a couple hours from jeffersonville south and garnet was this poor young man that didn't have any money but he loved to hear brother branham his parents were divorced he would save up his his child support money and he would buy brother branham's tapes and and he would listen to these tapes and he just loved him as he got sicker with polio he was in this iron lung and and he couldn't even get out of bed but he would listen to brother brana well he had a brother a half brother and this brother married this lady named shirley shirley did not like brother branham's message she didn't like it at all these self-righteous people and their long hair their long skirts they think they're better than me i you know i don't want anything to do with them it's so sad to see these people garnet got sicker and sicker and he asks his brother and sh and sister shirley he said brother branham's going to be in jeffersonville he said would you go hear him and then come back and tell me how it was shirley's like no i don't want to go i don't want to go with that bunch of people i'm not going to do it. he says please and she loved garnet garnet was such a nice boy she says okay she agreed so they made the trip up to jeffersonville and i want you to listen to the tape it's called souls that are in prison now preached in 1963 i'm sure we've all heard the tape about 30 minutes into the tape all right shirley is standing along the wall is packed she's standing along the wall and her thoughts were look at these poor people there they just don't understand and now shirley had very short hair her clothes weren't acceptable as we would think brother branham would say acceptable as we might think were acceptable her clothes didn't look like that she had enough paint on her face probably to you know paint a barn door and there she is and she's looking out on the audience and she's saying these poor people about 30 minutes in shirley faints she's never fainted before and she's never fainted from that time and you can hear it on the tape somebody comes to brother branham brother brown says a sister fainted they have prayer for and brother branham goes on preaching and then he stops again and he says bring her up here to the platform i want to lay my hands on her and he lays his hands on this young lady the way she looked the way she dressed whatever brother branham laid his hands on her and he said lord the devil's trying to to cheat your daughter out of a blessing and he takes her brother um doc brother brown's brother gives her a handkerchief she's sweating but the dog gives her a handkerchief brother branham says bring her up here on the platform and set her right here in front of all the congregation now brother brown's office was right here there's a little bit of air coming out there he sets her right here in front of the whole congregation let me tell you something brother branham was proud of that young lady he loved her sister shirley is sitting there in that chair and she takes this handkerchief then she wipes her face and she looks and there was all that paint on the handkerchief and she got condemned from that moment on shirley could not wait to get back into that church and and she became a true believer she's she's alive today and and living in the same place in acton kentucky down there but my point in saying that is brother branham had that spirit and it wasn't the miracles that got shirley it wasn't it wasn't all these things it was that love that he showed towards her and he and he brought her in so much so he's like sitter right here i'm proud of her i love her and and she comes in and and from that moment it wasn't it wasn't all of the stuff that we hear about with brother branham that we think about that we talk about it was his love that he had for her now i want to tell you someone else that had that same love and that was our lord and savior jesus christ in john this isn't the scripture but again i'm trying to get everybody ready for the scriptures that i'm going to read in john chapter 8 verse 10 let's read it real quick now what happened was another young lady far worse than sister shirley she was caught in the very act of adultery the very act now we could think what a vile person this woman was sleeping with another man's husband caught in the act brought out and about to be stoned for adultery that was the law jesus shows up and the pharisees are like what do you think we should do it's famous what he says we all know it he says he that is without sin among you let him first cast a stone at her even those pharisees they even got condemned so they start walking away one by one and then there's just jesus and the woman and they're there i believe it's uh verse number 10 verse 10. there's jesus and there's the woman and it's beautiful and he asks her he says woman where are those thine accusers has no man condemned me and she said imagine how she felt she was about to die for a sin imagine how this young lady felt she says no man lord and jesus said this and friends we always need to remember this when somebody does us wrong when we see someone doing something wrong here's what jesus says he says neither do i condemn me he says go and sin no more what a beautiful statement and what a beautiful thing that happened so much so that god chose it to be recorded in his word for thousands of years for people to be able to read and go back to this story and and live our lives by by that story and friends i uh uh i'll level with you we're we're here on a wednesday night there's not many people and you know it's wednesday nights i think it's it's nice because wednesday nights are when you can really see the pillars of the church these people that are here tonight right now are the ones that are holding the church up sunday we have more people in but this is the group friends if we are going to move forward this is the group that's going to do it in this room right now amen but we have to do something now i'm at a bit of a crossroads in my life many of you know me i've talked to the few of you and i moved here from jeffersonville lord told me to move to tucson and i'm searching i'm and friends i'm searching i'm searching for a church and you might you might not understand me in saying that i want a place that i can go that's not a church that that it's a body of christ working together in love in all the gifts operating in the church and i'm not just talking about spiritual gifts i'm talking about gifts of each other that that we come in and so often i hear oh i want to come to church i want to get fed well friends come to church we don't have to eat all the time no it's not you don't have to come to church to eat all the time sometimes you can feed someone else you can help and imagine imagine if this this lady that we just heard about here in the book of john imagine if she came to church and she sat next to one of you it's not the pastor it's not the deacons it's not the trustees each person comes into the church and has a role to play and i wrote this down as i was i was praying this morning lord what do you want me to say and i uh i felt checked and i thought no i think it is that the church the body of jesus christ i'm not talking about tucson tabernacle i'm talking about the body of jesus christ is only as good as you and you and me now if you're not the body of christ you can say oh well you know you know i can i can i can live the way i want i can you know i just have a problem with that but if you are the body remember you represent the lord jesus and his body is only as good as you are you represent him so imagine if this lady came in and she sat on the pew right here would she feel the same spirit of jesus christ sitting right there not from the pastor necessarily but from you that's sitting next to her and then she might reach out to you i need help i'm a sinner i'm struggling that's the church that i want brother aaron i want to have a church that i can go to that the holy spirit is operating independently in each person and each of us has a ministry and i want to see that in operation that's why i came here and i'm praying lord do you want me in tucson do you want me in phoenix where do you want me to do i know you want me here somewhere but i want a church that does that and this church is making some decisions right now we're choosing our pastor we're we're doing these things and we've got to put the lord first put him first we each have a role to play merely your position is just as important as a pastor it is not a it is not a a total body without you without me without you we have to be one body moving together or it's not right and and that's friends that's what i'm seeking that's what i want and i want a place to send somebody to church if i meet somebody i met the pastor across the street they were they were having a uh car wash and there's these real sweet sisters young ladies you know like like your age and they're having a car wash and i was like oh you know i got to stop so me and my son stop he was like dad come on you know stopping there young girls i was like no buddy come on let's go talk to him dad it was embarrassing sorry man that's what we're gonna do so we stop and it's this church right here and and i met the the associate pastor uh is it a pentecostal church right here well there's it's around here somewhere maybe it wasn't that church right there but i was like oh yeah tucson tabernacle that's where i'm going he's like oh yeah you guys are down on stone friends i want a place it's like hey come to our church you want to meet jesus christ come sit in these pews talk to the person next to you because every single person is here in here has a ministry that's that's the church that i want and you say well good luck brother dan let me tell you i'm going to read a scripture at the end that it will happen i can guarantee you it will happen there was as uh rare knows that that i worked for voice of god recordings for 14 years my job there was when someone called up and they wanted to talk to a minister and it could have been brother brahms william branham's a false prophet you know this question this question this question it could be um it could be anything i'm splitting up with my husband i'm splitting them with my wife i i don't know what to do you know i'm i'm a drug addict or whatever it is the whole gamut people would call well this one lady called and she was distraught her name's tammy robinson she was distraught what happened was she was standing on the street somebody walked up to her and gave her a track she took it she didn't read it she turned it over there was a phone number she called and she got to me and i said i said no no no what's wrong well my husband left me my son's on drugs i just got kicked out of my house i don't know what to do so i said well sister let's pray let's pray about it so we prayed and she said can i call back i said of course sister call anytime so we uh she starts calling back every week or so and we would pray over the phone and and i would try to help her well i sent her a couple tapes i sent her life story and be certain of god was the two cds that i sent her i thought this would be good this would be encouraging for her if you ever heard those two tapes they're beautiful and and they're very very encouraging so i center these two tapes and uh she she says uh yeah brother branham said i need to be baptized she said i want to be baptized i said great she was up in newcastle indiana she was about a four hour drive i said come down we'll baptize you at the tabernacle so this is this is one of the times that i don't know if you all heard but there was some turmoil in the branham tabernacle you had the voice of god people and you had the brahm tabernacle people and it was bad and and this is um it was one of the worst times well i was in the voice of god camp you know i'm in jesus's camp now and i'm in the tucson tabernacle camp too i got i love it but but uh you know it was just you know you act just childish and then i was we're all childish and and i pray that we've learned and learned from that time so so it was it was there was tension coming in to church well she was supposed to meet at church so uh my wife stephanie i said uh well honey we're gonna meet this this lady and why don't you sit next to her and help her you know so she knows where to go to the baptism and all that so we walk into the church early we always we always want the first ones there we walk into the church early and there's three deacons standing there and they're standing around this this big woman and and she's talking loud and they're like now what do you want now who are you here and i was like oh this is tammy you know it must be tammy i walk up and i said sister tammy as soon as she heard my voice she grabbed me i mean i was like you know don't do so i put my hands down and she's no brother dude i love you so much and i'm thinking the deacons are looking at me it's okay it's okay so baptizer and friends what breaks my heart is i didn't have a place to send her that she could have a church and so often people say well give them a tape they don't need a tape they need a body they need a body of believers to help them all of us do we can't operate independently we need that body and this group of pillars here you are that body don't neglect that you be the gift to others but you have to live the life you have to make the commitment you have to i have to and then we can be a blessing blessing to others i uh i want to read before i get to my scripture i want to read first corinthians chapter 12. um last last verse in chapter 12. i just turned 50 like a few weeks ago and some for some reason my the uh i read my bible so much that the uh the words on there have gotten kind of rubbed off and blurry right let me put these on first corinthians chapter 12. we're all familiar with this this chapter it's about the gifts in the church and it it talks about how each of us have has our own part to play and no member of the body is any greater than any other member and it all operates they operate independently but for the collective good of of the body of christ and you go to the to the last verse and and paul says he's he's instructing us on how to on how to have a church and he says this he says but covet earnestly the best gifts and yet i show unto you a more excellent way now the way that the bible's written it isn't written in chapters that came up long time later paul wrote this big long letter to the church at corinth so when we separate it into chapters it helps us keep track of where we are but that's not the way paul wrote it and he says here but covet earnestly the best gifts and yet i show unto you a more excellent way though i speak with tongues of men and angels and have not charity which is love and become as a sounding brass and a tinkling symbol and ann jacqueline that's why brother branham was such a great man is because that's what he had that's why people would worship him because he had love and that's the church that i want to be a part of that's where i want to be and now i'm gonna get to my my scripture let's uh let's go to uh saint john chapter 14. this isn't my scripture yet but i'm gonna get there we're getting closer st john chapter 14. now what's going on right here is we read chapter 13 for the communion service and we're all familiar with with that service but we get to saint john 14 and jesus is talking to his disciples and this is the last supper it's a very very sad time it's just an absolutely awful time in history is is this moment here when judas he says judas go do what you got to do can you imagine the man the young man jesus 33 years old knowing what's going to happen and and i guarantee he was down and he's he's he's he's there and he's like lord i got these these disciples he had 11 men and then and then some women we don't know exactly how many but there was there was women there too and he's he's he's like he has these and he's got just this last few hours with them and he leaves he um he starts he starts talking to them and he talks about a lot of things in in chapter in verse 8 chapter 14 verse 8. philip asks him i'm in first corinthians asks him he says he says lord show us the father and jesus is like philip he says have i been so long with you and you don't know me now it's very important for my scripture when i get a little bit later that jesus philip says show us the father and and jesus is like have i been so long with you and you don't know me look how close the father and the son are that jesus could say that he could say you want to see the father here i am come on phillip you know and and he starts talking about these things and and then he he mentions in saint john 14 12 famous scripture that we all know he says he says verily verily i say unto you that he that believeth on me the works that i al the works that i do shall he do also and greater works than those shall he do because i go to the father greater we know brother branham explain what that is more because jesus was limited by his flesh he was he was one man standing there he had to be there for somebody to be healed he had to be in the place but he says but greater than than these are you gonna do and he starts telling us about a very very important thing and let's skip down to uh i don't know where the first time he mentions it um starts talking about a comforter and he starts talking about this person that's coming and they're not understanding but he says he says hey i'm going to go away i'm going to leave but don't be sad listen the disciples start to get sad and say oh you're going to go what's going to happen he says no no no don't be sad it's a good thing he says i'm going to leave you but i'm going to send the comforter proper translation while i was an advocate i'm going to send this person and he's going to be so close to you that he's going to be in you and he will never leave you i got to leave you i got to go but he's not going to leave you and they they move along and they don't understand what's going on and and jesus says this in uh verse 31 chapter chapter 14 verse 31 he says this they're sitting at the table and he says okay let's get up and let's go so what they do is they're in the old city of jerusalem they're in there in the city of jerusalem they get up and they start walking down the hill now brother lyle's been there that it's not very far that they had to go from the city and they start walking down this trail and as they're walking jesus is telling them all these things and he says listen i'm going to send this comforter he's going to be inside of you he's going to do these things don't worry you know things are going to get bad you're going to suffer you're going to suffer the same thing i'm suffering but it's okay it's gonna be better and they're walking down this hill and they they get down i don't know but a lot of what is it probably a 30 minute walk maybe from from the old city i've done it i've been there you you walk down it's sidewalk now you know it's pavement and roads and stuff but but they walk down the steep hill and they get they they cross this dry creek bed and just on the other side of the dry creek bed is the garden of gethsemane i would have loved to have gone that walk with him i can only imagine what it was like he was about to be crucified within a few hours within if within one day he was going to be in the grave he was going to be on the cross the next morning and the disciples didn't know this he knew it and he's he's telling the disciples about this holy spirit the same holy spirit friends that we need you know i want to read he he says many times he says to love one another it was almost like it was the most important thing to him i encourage you to go read saint john 14 15 16 and 17. it was very very important to him that they love one another he didn't tell us about what kind of music we should have in church he didn't tell us about if we should have four deacons or six deacons or two deacons it wasn't important what was important to jesus was that we love one another and that we're together and he's walking down and he gets down to the bottom of the hill he gets to the garden and he's finished with his last time that he talks with his disciples and how many times he says love in there now i'll get to my scripture saint john chapter 17. we'll start with verse 20. and friends i pray that the holy spirit's with us and i pray that in in speaking tonight that that have prepared your heart for what jesus prayed because it's so important his prayer he says this let's start with verse 19. he says and for their sake for their sakes i sanctify myself that they also might be sanctified through the truth now this is the best part this is my favorite scripture one of them he says this he says this is this is uh friends we gotta you gotta listen to this this is very very important he says this he says neither pray i for these alone but for them also which shall believe on me through their word guess what that's us that's the people in this tabernacle tonight brother matt that's us jesus prayed for me he prayed for me right here here i am reading his words through the apostle john's testimony scripture fulfilled right here i'm here i believe it so let's go on now he says this he says that they all may be won now you probably never thought about this when you've read this scripture that they all may be one as thou father art in me and i in thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou hast sent me the oneness of us as a body in the tucson tabernacle our oneness our love for each other will prove to the world that jesus is the messiah did i read that right yes i did read it right it says here that they may they may they all may be one as thou father art and me and i in thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou has sent me that's our testimony you know we think oh i want to do great miracles oh i want to part to see the red sea like moses did you know i want to do this and maybe we could get maybe we could have a prayer line and then when all the people come through and we see all the people healed then they'll believe or we'll get a some intellectual up here and he'll be such a great preacher he'll be he'll he'll bring them in and he will make them believe no how the world sees that jesus is the christ is by our oneness by our unity how important is it oh man there's more and he says this and the glory which thou gaveth me i have given them that they may be one even as we are one right now remember i read the scripture with philip how close and we as message believers we understand it's very difficult for us to separate jesus and the father there's differences there because one was born one gave his life god can't die jesus died so but but as us as message believers in understanding it's so hard for me to separate the father from the son because you can't because they are one and he said we need to be one as jesus and the father are one you and me we need to be one as close as jesus and the father are one to me that would be impossible but i mean we're all about the impossible how close should we be as a church and keep going oh let me read it one more time and the glory which thou gavest me i have given them that they may be one even as we are one i in them and thou in me that they may be made perfect in one and that the world may know that thou has sent me and has loved them as thou has loved me he loves us as much as he loved jesus christ it's a big deal father oh can you imagine what he's saying here this is jesus praying right before he was betrayed and taken to the cross father father i will that they also whom now has given me be with me where i am that they may behold my glory which thou has given me for thou lovest me before the foundation of the world lord i love these and i want them with me remember he's talking about us o righteous father the world hath not known me but i have known thee and these have known that thou has sent me and i have declared unto them thy name and will declare it that the love wherewith thou hast love me may be in them and i in them our love for one another and the holy spirit operating in each of us friends i have i have a bunch of scriptures but i feel like the lord says stop right there i um it's so important my brother brother aaron if you could think about whatever song you're going to close with and maybe the the piano player whoever the musicians are and let me um this is something friends it's not easy we have been given and as i've read in the scriptures here we've been given a great responsibility and we're not just going to sit around we can't just sit around and let it happen my mother-in-law there merely she um as you know she lost rod a little while ago and she's not alone she has a body here that that were together and she was uh she was riding her bike the other day and she's going to say i'm never going to tell this guy another story again as long as i live she's riding her bike the other day and she fell it crashed seat was too tall and she fell over and she said something that really struck me and i felt the holy spirit when she said it and i didn't tell you but she said as she was sitting there on the ground and here's this little lady lost her husband she doesn't know what to do and here's what marilee said she said well she said i can just sit here and cry she said or i can get up and i thought hey man and i say as a church what are we going to do are we going to just sit here and do nothing or friends are we going to do something are we going to get up are we going to do our part remember i said that the body of christ is only as good as the person sitting in your seat right now it's a big responsibility but it's the truth if you're the body so we need to do something we need to pray so can we pray can we pray together will you pray with me i'm too far away i'm going to get down in here and i want to pray let's let's let's pray think about friends think about yourself and think about the lord jesus just love him the love that he's had for us thank him for your friends and family and never friends never say a cross word about anyone ever again love the bride and serve serve each one and when someone would come into this church remember we each have a ministry oh god you're the one that walked down that hill with your disciples and lord you were so good and lord you instructed us unto love one another in these gifts as our great brother the apostle paul said these gifts are nothing without love lord place that love in our hearts place that holy spirit in our bodies that we may be one lord with you and one with each other i pray and bless our church here tonight father i pray and as i said earlier i believe as you the pillars that are in the church are now visible here on wednesday night they're exposed lord they're here and they're holding up the church i pray for each one i pray for the leadership i i pray for brother matt and the decisions that he's making right now i pray that your holy spirit would lead him lord lead the brethren lead us and may we father be in your perfect will i pray lord we love you thank you for your your holy word thank you that we can read this bible and find our place in there we love you lord we pray to you in the name of the son of god jesus christ amen i love him [Music] i love him because he first loved me [Music] and purchased my salvation [Music] [Music] he said one thing to his disciples he said by this shall all men know you are my disciples when you've understood every mystery when you can repeat everything back no he said when you have love one for another see because when you have love you have god for god is love and when you have god you have everything because he is the creator of all he's the source of all he gives all when the honest truth is when we don't have god we have nothing i i was talking to brother dan before could sense his a little bit of apprehension and his his nervousness a bit and i said god saw this day already god had already said brother dan's going to be speaking that evening so i said speak what god put in your heart because it's for us and somebody can come from the other side of the world not knowing anything about us stand behind here [Music] and god will speak to you current oh that's what we just heard that's what i'm going through because god is fully aware of that and got a chance to just talk with him a little bit before and share some things and when god gets a hold of a person and it's god doing the work that's when people love that person truly love because you're loving the god that's in that person i i remember talking with sister nadine words when does she when brother brandon would drop off brother joseph there to play with her son and he said as soon as brother branham she said oh me as soon as brother abraham got there he would make you feel important it would be he would leave something with you that would encourage you it never she said it was just something that was he did but that was not brother brown that was jesus christ the same one in you i just things as you look back in life and as you go further down the road there's a home a lot more now to look back and i i like the way brother dan said that the words have gotten a little blurrier and maybe it's because i've opened now as life goes on things change and and just i was sharing with him as we shared some things together and you don't know the effects that you've had on someone because you let god be manifest through your life you didn't wake up in the morning and say today i'm gonna go be god to somebody it's just your character nature of christ in you and that little thing you do that little thing you say how you help how you smile to somebody reaches somebody's life we did something for a young man we just tried to help him try to encourage him try to be as i said an older brother to him because mom and dad had separated and he didn't have somebody around him and i filled that for a time and later in life he told his mother and she told me he said brother aaron will never know what he did for me in my life and i said no i won't but if god did that then it'll have its effect and i i'll just say it this way tucson tabernacle it's christ in you the hope of glory but it's also somebody else's hope if you'll share it with them and not hold it to yourself when whatever place or part you are and uh putting that sister down there i was reading something the other day where brother branham was it was question answers and they told him he said how could you let that sister play the piano look at her hair look at how she is look at how she's dressed and brother brandon was letting her play the piano in his service and they're criticizing and he says you have no idea what that's going to do for her if we're not careful we'll throw them out but let god have us let the christ in you reach out and touch somebody i pray that that's that's that's each on all our desires if we'll stand together keep brother dan in prayer it has been a hard road it's been a tough time but god's children are used wherever they're needed the body has a lot of parts that you have no idea about them unless maybe you've studied it until they go wrong and then the doctor says this is this is what's happening in your body because this is failing you right now and i thank god if that great physician goes down and says this is what you have need of so how many appreciate the word of god today how many knows that it was just something they needed to hear amen let's just bow our heads lord we appreciate that i know brother dan was was as he talked to me before and said he was sure to do that but lord you knew this day was coming and you knew what we would hear today and how it would it would remind us that the christ in us is the same christ and our brother and our sister and the world is going to know you because we share you with others lord because there's truly only one god i spoke to a young man yesterday and he told me how he knows there's a god he just doesn't know which one it is but he also noticed that how all the religions fought that they had the right god but in his heart was to see a living god a true god lord and you've chosen to demonstrate yourself a living god through a people who lord would let you dwell in them lord we surrender to you we yield to you say lord let that be us may we love one another and may that love be not just words but a demonstration a part of our life lord jesus because lord with the way things are happening today on this earth it can't be too much longer let the love of god reach out to anyone that we could reach and that that hope would lie in them also lord is our desire in jesus christ's name amen a couple of things to bring to your attention um sister olga she was ramirez and we know her family a lot of them the family is going to have a memorial service here at the tabernacle this friday and they're doing it quickly because zion the youngest son doesn't can only stay here he lives back the midwest so they've asked if they could use a church and they will it'll at 5 30 that the
