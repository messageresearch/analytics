[0:56] Hey

[6:37] Amen. Even when you didn't think you
[6:40] were lovable, he still loved you. He
[6:43] said, "You're my son. You're my
[6:44] daughter. You may be
[6:46] seated." Amen.
[6:49] So, I was Sarah was over at the house
[6:52] and we got to talking and she mentioned
[6:55] such love and I said, "I'm going to
[6:57] change it." And I sent it out. Oh, well,
[7:01] we got to sing both of them. All right.
[7:03] Amen. I've anchored my soul in the haven
[7:07] of
[7:08] rest. You know, if if if you're not
[7:12] resting, he is rest. He is peace. Yes.
[7:16] Check yourself closely. Why am I not
[7:18] resting? And now there's there's a good
[7:20] there's a good
[7:22] struggle in wanting to be like him, but
[7:24] there's rest in him.
[7:27] Amen. My
[7:29] soul
[7:30] [Music]
[7:32] sadness
[7:34] [Music]
[7:37] was so
[7:39] burdened with sin and distress.
[7:47] Till I heard a sweet voice saying, "Make
[7:53] me your
[7:55] choice." And I
[7:57] entered the
[8:04] heaven. I've
[8:06] anchored my
[8:08] soul in the
[8:11] haven of rest.
[8:14] I'll sail the white
[8:17] seas no
[8:22] more. The
[8:24] tempest may
[8:26] sweep or the wild stormy
[8:31] day. In
[8:33] Jesus I'm
[8:35] safe ever more.
[8:40] Oh, I
[8:42] yielded myself to his
[8:47] tender
[8:48] embrace and faith
[8:51] taking a hold of the
[8:57] word. Oh, my
[8:59] feathers fell off and I
[9:04] anchored my soul.
[9:07] Oh, the
[9:08] haven of rest is
[9:12] [Music]
[9:15] alone. Oh, I've
[9:17] anchored my
[9:19] soul in the
[9:22] haven of grace. I'll sail the wild
[9:28] seas no more.
[9:34] The
[9:35] tempest may
[9:37] sweep or the wild stormy
[9:41] day. Oh, in Jesus I'm
[9:46] safe ever
[9:50] more. I've
[9:52] anchored my
[9:54] soul in the
[9:57] haven of west.
[10:00] I'll sail the white
[10:03] seas no
[10:07] more. Oh, the
[10:10] tempest may
[10:12] sweet or the wild stormy
[10:16] day. In
[10:18] Jesus I'm
[10:21] safe ever
[10:23] [Music]
[10:24] more. That last line, in Jesus I'm safe
[10:28] ever more. If you're getting into some
[10:30] trouble, check to see where you're
[10:31] standing. Cuz in him, Amen. I It
[10:35] reminded me the one time I've been out
[10:38] on the boat in the
[10:40] ocean as I was just singing that song as
[10:43] just a young boy. Dad's boss took us out
[10:47] on the out there in the the Pacific. And
[10:50] we went out what seemed like forever,
[10:53] but it wasn't that far. Just when you're
[10:55] little, everything is different in
[10:57] perspective.
[10:58] And we got out into the waves up and
[11:01] down. And uh it's like, "Lord, don't let
[11:05] this boat flip. Lord, don't let this
[11:07] Nothing happened here." Yeah. And those
[11:09] that have been on the boat, knew how the
[11:11] boat worked. They were not worried.
[11:13] Right. The owner and the the pilot, they
[11:15] were doing fine. It was us young ones
[11:17] who were in there the first time were
[11:19] holding on this side. But when you get
[11:21] to know him, and you know, he anchors
[11:24] you. Amen. You can take a hold of his
[11:26] hand, say, "I'm safe ever more."
[11:30] Amen. And that chorus of through it all,
[11:33] I've learned to trust in Jesus. You know
[11:36] how you learn? By
[11:41] experience. Oh, through it
[11:46] all. Oh, through it
[11:50] all, I've learned to trust in Jesus.
[11:56] I've learned to trust in
[12:00] God. Through it
[12:04] all, through it
[12:08] all, I've learned to depend upon his
[12:17] word. Oh, through it all.
[12:22] Oh, through it
[12:26] all, I've learned to trust in
[12:30] Jesus. I've learned to trust in
[12:35] God. Through it
[12:39] all, through it
[12:43] all, I've learned to depend upon. If you
[12:49] have, raise your hand and just
[12:50] acknowledge that I've learned to do it.
[12:53] Oh, through it
[12:57] all. Through it
[13:01] all, I've learned to trust in
[13:05] Jesus. I've learned to trust in
[13:10] God. Through it
[13:15] all, through it
[13:19] all, I've learned to depend upon his
[13:28] word. Amen. Through it all. Through it
[13:31] all. I see Chloe and Asher. They're
[13:34] here. And they're getting old enough to
[13:37] understand that Papa and Mama do mess up
[13:40] sometimes.
[13:41] But there was a time that daddy, papa,
[13:43] mama, grandpa, grandma could do no
[13:46] wrong. You know, they they could they
[13:49] could solve everything, take care of
[13:51] everything. And that was when $1 was so
[13:54] much to them cuz they didn't know the
[13:57] value of money
[13:58] yet. Now it's papa. How about a 20? You
[14:02] know, but you know, when you when you
[14:04] learn you get to know him, there is no
[14:07] fear. Through it all, I've learned to
[14:09] trust him.
[14:12] [Music]
[14:13] So I see that I missed the other
[14:17] song. There's the look I was waiting
[14:19] for. Okay. Thanks. The battle is the
[14:24] Lord's. It is. We make it our battle
[14:27] sometimes. But he says, you know, give
[14:29] it to me.
[14:30] And sorry, I'm making the the sound
[14:33] people there work a little extra today.
[14:36] So
[14:41] We can get the words up
[14:42] [Music]
[14:50] there. I don't know them off the top of
[14:54] my head.
[14:59] [Music]
[15:03] There is a
[15:06] soul in time of
[15:10] need that gives me
[15:15] hope. That brings me
[15:19] peace in every trial.
[15:24] Through every
[15:28] turn, my savior
[15:32] stands in my
[15:36] defense. So when the road you
[15:40] walk, leaves you tired and
[15:45] warm, all your strength is
[15:49] gone and your heart feels torn.
[15:55] Remember,
[15:56] God is greater than the
[16:00] [Music]
[16:02] storm. Take courage
[16:05] for the battle is alone.
[16:11] When the waters
[16:15] rise, he calls your
[16:19] name and bids you
[16:23] come out on the way.
[16:28] He holds your
[16:31] hand lest you should
[16:36] fall and makes you
[16:40] stand upon the
[16:44] water. When the wood you
[16:48] walk leaves you tired and
[16:53] warm. All your strength is gone.
[16:58] and your heart feels
[17:01] tall. Remember,
[17:04] God is gater than the
[17:10] storm. Take courage
[17:14] for the is the Lord's. Now, I sang and I
[17:18] put you in that verse. I wanted you to
[17:21] realize it was you that
[17:23] he's so if you're next close to somebody
[17:26] sing it that way to one another
[17:30] mom and and and and daughter
[17:34] okay let's go to that second
[17:39] verse when the waters
[17:43] rise he calls your
[17:47] name and let you
[17:52] Come out on the
[17:56] way. He holds your
[18:00] hand lest you should
[18:04] fold and makes you
[18:09] stand upon the
[18:12] water. When the road you
[18:17] walk leaves you tired and
[18:21] warm, all your strength is
[18:25] long and your heart feels
[18:29] torn. Remember,
[18:32] God is greater than the storm.
[18:39] Take courage
[18:41] for the battle is the
[18:46] Lord. Remember
[18:49] God's greater than the
[18:54] storm. Take courage
[18:57] for the battle is the Lord.
[19:02] Amen. And he's never lost a battle.
[19:05] That's right. He's never come close to
[19:06] losing a battle.
[19:10] It looked like when he was on the
[19:12] cross that oh this our deliverer has
[19:16] lost. No. The greatest deliverance was
[19:20] getting ready to come. One you could not
[19:21] do for yourself. So he said I'll do it
[19:23] for you. Yeah.
[19:25] Amen. And you know why? Because he loves
[19:29] you. Oh how he loves you and me.
[19:36] Oh, how he loves you and
[19:44] me. Oh, how he loves you and
[19:54] me. He gave his
[19:58] life. What more could he give?
[20:04] Oh, how he loves
[20:08] you. Oh, how he loves
[20:12] me. Oh, how he loves you and
[20:21] me. And oh, how he loves you and me.
[20:28] [Music]
[20:31] Oh, how he loves you and
[20:39] me. He gave his
[20:43] life. What more could he
[20:49] give? Oh, how he loves
[20:53] you. Oh, how he loves you.
[20:59] Oh, how he loves you and
[21:05] me. That's another song you could turn
[21:08] and sing to one
[21:10] another. And oh, encourage one another
[21:12] that way. He loves you. He loves me.
[21:17] Amen. You deserve the glory.
[21:22] This this evening is the last portion of
[21:26] the study on Joseph and brother Lyall is
[21:29] doing and that's a lot of work that he's
[21:32] put in to do that. But you know who gave
[21:35] him the strength and the encouragement,
[21:38] your prayers, your attitude, your
[21:42] receiving it. That's what draws and God
[21:44] coming and does that. Amen.
[21:48] Oh, you deserve the
[21:54] glory and the
[21:59] honor. Lord, we lift our hands in
[22:06] worship as we lift your holy name.
[22:12] You deserve the
[22:17] gloryy and the
[22:21] [Music]
[22:23] honor. Lord, we lift our hands in
[22:30] worship as we lift your holy name. For
[22:36] you are great.
[22:40] You do
[22:42] miracles so
[22:45] great. There is no one else like
[22:53] you. There is no one else like you. For
[23:00] you are
[23:02] great. You do
[23:05] miracles so great.
[23:09] There is no one else like
[23:16] you. There is
[23:19] no one else like Let's stand and sing
[23:25] that one more time as brother Ly
[23:27] prepares.
[23:29] You deserve the
[23:33] glory and the
[23:39] honor. Lord, we lift our hands to
[23:45] worship as we lift your holy name.
[23:52] You deserve the
[23:53] [Music]

[25:20] one
[25:22] else like
[25:26] [Music]
[25:29] you. So true. So true. Thank you all so
[25:34] much. God bless
[25:35] you. Good evening and welcome once again
[25:39] to our Wednesday night Bible study.
[25:42] As I'm sure you know by now, we've been
[25:44] studying the life of Joseph. This
[25:47] evening is part eight, and tonight we'll
[25:49] conclude this series. We'll also look a
[25:52] bit beyond his life and review some of
[25:55] the lessons we can take from his life
[25:57] and apply to our lives. Before we resume
[26:00] our study, let's join together one more
[26:02] time in
[26:04] prayer. Lord Jesus, our sufficiency lies
[26:08] in you. Lord, I'm certainly inadequate
[26:11] to stand here and say anything, but
[26:13] Lord, it's your grace. It's your mercy.
[26:16] It's your love that empowers and enables
[26:18] us. It's it's the blood that you shed.
[26:20] It's the price that you paid to redeem
[26:22] us to yourself. And Lord, we're so
[26:25] grateful. There truly is no one else no
[26:28] one else like you. Lord, as we're
[26:31] studying the life of Joseph and seeing
[26:33] how he models, how he types, how he how
[26:36] he shows attributes that you would fully
[26:39] manifest when you were here and that
[26:42] you're still manifesting today through
[26:44] your Holy Spirit in each of us. Lord, we
[26:47] pray that you would forgive us where we
[26:49] fall short. Open our hearts, Lord. Help
[26:51] us to be receptive to your word. guard
[26:53] my lips, Lord, that I say nothing that
[26:56] would cause anyone any difficulty,
[26:58] anyone to stumble, anyone to be
[27:01] misdirected in any way, but Lord, we
[27:03] just our desire is to draw closer to
[27:06] you, to be yielded to the spirit of
[27:08] Christ. And Lord, drawing closer to one
[27:11] another. We're so grateful for this
[27:13] opportunity and this privilege that we
[27:15] have. We commit the remainder of this
[27:17] evening now to you in Jesus precious
[27:20] name. Amen.
[27:24] While you're standing, I I'd like to
[27:26] start by reading a short passage from
[27:29] Deuteronomy chapter 32. It's about the
[27:32] Exodus. But there would have been no
[27:34] Exodus from Egypt if under Moses if
[27:37] there had not been a migration to Egypt
[27:40] under Joseph. Moses is reminding the
[27:44] people he has led for many decades about
[27:46] their history, about their roots.
[27:49] He says,"Remember the days of old.
[27:52] Consider the years of many generations.
[27:56] Ask thy father and he'll show you thy
[27:59] elders and they will tell
[28:01] thee." Do we do this? Can we summarize
[28:05] our history as Christians from its
[28:08] foundations in Genesis to the present
[28:10] day? The Jewish people divide their
[28:13] Torah, the five books of Moses, into 52
[28:15] divisions. and they read the entire set
[28:18] every year in their synagogue
[28:21] services. How often do we read and
[28:23] review the Gospels, for
[28:25] example? How can we know the God of the
[28:28] word if we don't know the word of God?
[28:31] Hence our review of the Old Testament
[28:33] last year and now looking at the lives
[28:35] of some of its major
[28:38] characters. Moses goes on, "When the
[28:40] Most High divided the nations to the
[28:43] nations their inheritance, when he
[28:46] separated the sons of Adam, he set the
[28:49] bounds of the people, the the borders of
[28:51] the land according to the number of the
[28:53] children of
[28:56] Israel. For the Lord's portion is what?
[29:00] his people. Jacob is the lot of his
[29:05] inheritance. And Paul likening Israel to
[29:09] an olive tree tells us we Gentiles were
[29:12] grafted in not to replace, not to
[29:15] supplant, but to join into the
[29:19] inheritance of eternal life through
[29:21] Jesus Christ. Lord, the Lord found
[29:24] Israel in a desert land in the waste
[29:28] howling wilderness. He led them about.
[29:31] He instructed them. He kept him as the
[29:35] apple of his
[29:37] eye. As the eagle stirth up her nest,
[29:40] flutterth over her young, spreadth
[29:43] abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth
[29:45] them on her wings, so the Lord alone did
[29:48] lead him, and there was no strange God
[29:51] in him. Please be seated.
[29:57] We ended last time with Jacob and his
[30:01] extended family relocating from Canaan
[30:03] to Gan, the best of the land of Egypt.
[30:06] To use the metaphor from Deuteronomy,
[30:09] the place where the eagle built the nest
[30:11] and would raise the chicks. Also, last
[30:14] week I indicated I said something
[30:17] probably a little strange. I said that
[30:18] Joseph was the master publican.
[30:21] But I hope I hope you've considered that
[30:24] statement, given it some careful
[30:27] thought. The Bible studies we doing are
[30:30] not intended to be one and done or
[30:34] enjoyed and quickly forgotten. I use the
[30:36] word publican
[30:39] deliberately. Why? The word publican
[30:42] simply means a person who is a collector
[30:44] of public revenue. But this word has a
[30:47] very negative connotation with us. It's
[30:49] a pjorative term because of the New
[30:52] Testament perspective on publicans. They
[30:55] were hated in Jesus' day because they
[30:57] had a reputation for overcharging and
[31:00] lining their own pockets. Now, Joseph
[31:03] did collect taxes. We read in uh Genesis
[31:07] 41, Joseph was 30 years old when he
[31:10] interpreted Pharaoh's dreams and and
[31:13] stood before the king. Joseph went out
[31:15] from the presence of Pharaoh and went
[31:17] throughout all the land of Egypt. And in
[31:20] the seven plenteous years, the earth
[31:23] brought forth by
[31:24] handfuls. Joseph gathered up all the
[31:27] food via 20% tax of the seven years
[31:30] which were in the land of Egypt, and
[31:32] laid up the food in the cities, the food
[31:34] of the field, which was round about
[31:36] every city, lady up in the same, in the
[31:38] granaries near those cities, within the
[31:41] cities. Joseph gathered grain as the
[31:43] sand of the sea very much until he left
[31:46] numbering for it was without number. It
[31:48] was more than their number system could
[31:51] accommodate. But he did not line his own
[31:55] pockets. He collected and protected the
[31:58] grain. We're accustomed to an economy
[32:00] based on money currency used as a means
[32:03] of exchange representing value. And
[32:06] ancient times economy was more
[32:08] barterbased. Swap grain for bricks for
[32:11] example. Abraham's wealth was described
[32:13] in terms of livestock, as was Job's.
[32:17] Gold and silver were used as well, but
[32:19] measured by weight. The first
[32:21] coins were minted in Lydia, part of
[32:24] modern-day Turkey, and approximately 630
[32:28] BC, more than a thousand years after
[32:30] Joseph.
[32:33] When the time came to sell the grain, we
[32:36] read Joseph gathered up all the money,
[32:38] that is the silver and gold that was
[32:41] found in the land of Egypt and in the
[32:43] land of Canaan for the grain which they
[32:45] bought. And Joseph brought the silver
[32:47] and gold into Pharaoh's house, not
[32:50] Joseph's house. And when the money ran
[32:53] out, Joseph bought all the land of Egypt
[32:56] for Pharaoh. For the Egyptians sold
[32:59] every man his field, because a famine
[33:01] prevailed over them. So the land became
[33:05] Pharaoh's not Joseph's. Though it was
[33:08] through this mechanism that Israel had
[33:10] land granted by Pharaoh on which to live
[33:14] and to
[33:15] thrive. Joseph was a man of great
[33:18] personal
[33:20] integrity. When writing the account of
[33:22] Joseph's life, Moses never even hinted
[33:24] that Joseph was ethically dishonest as
[33:27] in his role as the vizier of Egypt, the
[33:29] viceroy.
[33:31] Finally, note what Joseph said his
[33:33] mission was. What he said was his
[33:36] understanding of why God sent him to
[33:38] Egypt through the treachery of his older
[33:41] siblings. It was not for personal gain
[33:43] or to create generational wealth to be
[33:45] hoarded or invested. The first was to
[33:49] save many lives. If he had not done what
[33:53] he did during the years of plenty,
[33:55] hundreds of thousands of people would
[33:57] have perished. Amen.
[34:00] Joseph said unto his brethren, "Come
[34:03] near to me, I pray you." And they came
[34:05] near. And he said, "I am Joseph, your
[34:08] brother, whom you sold into Egypt. Now
[34:11] therefore, be not grieved, nor angry
[34:13] with yourselves that you sold me hither,
[34:16] for God did send me before you." Why? To
[34:20] preserve
[34:22] life. The second was to preserve and
[34:25] protect Jacob and his descendants.
[34:27] Joseph's family through the political
[34:30] system that existed in Egypt at that
[34:32] time in history. He was able to secure
[34:35] land that was ideal for them to settle
[34:38] in, flourish, and become a
[34:41] nation. He said, "God sent me before you
[34:44] to preserve you a posterity in the
[34:47] earth, and to save your lives by a great
[34:50] deliverance." Skipping to verse 10. And
[34:52] thou shalt dwell in the land of Gan, and
[34:56] thou shalt be near unto me, thou and thy
[34:58] children, and thy children's children,
[35:00] and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all
[35:02] that thou hast. Why? For what purpose?
[35:06] To exploit them, to lord it over them?
[35:11] No. And there will I nourish thee. For
[35:15] yet there are five years of famine, lest
[35:18] thou and thy household and all that thou
[35:21] hast come to
[35:24] poverty. Pharaoh became extremely
[35:27] wealthy and powerful as a result of
[35:31] Joseph's efforts and this enabled Israel
[35:35] to survive and flourish. God then used
[35:38] Egypt to provide for and protect them
[35:41] while the chicks were growing in the
[35:43] nest and go. We learn later in the
[35:46] Torah, the Pentatuk, the five books of
[35:48] Moses, that God sent in motion events
[35:51] that would eventually force the nation
[35:53] of Israel to leave the security of Gan
[35:56] and Egypt and return to Canaan. Pull the
[35:59] feathers out of the nest, make them
[36:01] uncomfortable, make them willing to
[36:03] leave. That was the territory, the land
[36:06] of promise to Abraham. And the return
[36:08] would be under the political and
[36:10] spiritual leadership of Moses, followed
[36:13] by the military leadership of
[36:15] Joshua. We read about this in our
[36:18] opening verses in Deuteronomy. Last time
[36:20] we stopped at the end of chapter 47.
[36:22] Let's pick up our story with the last
[36:25] five verses of chapter
[36:28] 47. Verse 27. And Israel, Joseph's dad,
[36:32] also known as Jacob. Sometimes we get
[36:34] confused. Israel is a nation. In this
[36:37] case, Israel means Jacob. It means the
[36:40] man. It means Joseph's father. Israel
[36:43] dwelt in the land of Egypt in the
[36:45] country of Gan. And they had possessions
[36:48] therein and grew and multiplied
[36:52] exceedingly. It was a good nest. Jacob
[36:55] lived in the land of Egypt 17 years. So
[36:59] the whole age of Jacob was 147 years.
[37:04] How many years did Joseph live under
[37:06] Jacob's loving care before his brother
[37:09] sold him to be a slave in Egypt?
[37:12] 17. How many years did Jacob live under
[37:15] Joseph's loving care in the land of
[37:18] Egypt?
[37:20] 17.
[37:23] And the time drew near that Israel must
[37:25] die. And he called his son Joseph and
[37:29] said unto
[37:30] him, "If now I I have found grace in thy
[37:34] sight, uh, put, I pray thee, thy thy
[37:36] hand under my thigh, deal kindly and
[37:40] truly with me. Bury me not, I pray thee,
[37:44] in Egypt, but I will I want to lie with
[37:47] my fathers. Thou shalt carry me out of
[37:50] Egypt, and bury me in their burying
[37:53] place."
[37:54] And Joseph said,"I will do as thou hast
[37:57] said." And Israel said, "Swear unto me."
[38:02] And he swore unto him. And Israel bowed
[38:05] himself upon the bed's
[38:07] head. Chapter
[38:09] 48. It came to pass after these things
[38:12] that one told Joseph, "Behold, your
[38:15] father's sick."
[38:18] And Joseph set off to see his father and
[38:20] took with him his two sons, Manasseh and
[38:24] Ephraim. Notice Joseph and the son's
[38:26] order. Manasseh, Ephraim, the birth
[38:29] order. And one told Jacob, and said,
[38:33] Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee.
[38:37] And Israel strengthened himself, and sat
[38:40] upon the bed. It it's so easy to just
[38:43] read this as a story, some historical
[38:46] event divorced from our lives today. But
[38:48] this is a personal story. It's filled
[38:51] with emotion. Yeah. Joseph's dad is
[38:54] very, very old. And now Joseph learns
[38:57] that his dad is really, really
[39:00] sick. How many of us have had a similar
[39:02] experience? Going to see an aging parent
[39:04] taken ill, wondering if it's the last
[39:07] time we'll see them, be able to let them
[39:09] know we love them.
[39:11] share final
[39:13] moments. And Jacob struggling to sit on
[39:17] his bed, he's too weak to get up and go
[39:19] sit in a chair, said unto
[39:22] Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at
[39:26] L, later known as Bethl, in the land of
[39:30] Canaan. At the time, he was fleeing for
[39:33] his life from his brother Esau. And God
[39:36] blessed
[39:37] me. And God said unto me, "Behold, I
[39:41] will make thee fruitful and multiply
[39:44] thee. I will make of thee a multitude of
[39:47] people. I will give this land to thy
[39:50] descendants after thee for an
[39:51] everlasting possession." That's Genesis
[39:58] 28:10-19. And now thy two sons, Ephraim
[40:02] and Manasseh. Notice Jacob and the
[40:06] order. Secondborn is listed
[40:08] first. Jacob is
[40:11] Jacob. Which were born unto thee in the
[40:14] land of Egypt before I came unto thee
[40:17] into Egypt. They're mine. As Reuben and
[40:21] Simeon, they shall be mine. Joseph, I'm
[40:25] adopting
[40:27] them. and thy issue which thou be getest
[40:31] after them. Any sons you have after
[40:34] these two. Keep in mind Joseph is almost
[40:37] 60 years old now. And Azeneath his wife
[40:40] is likely at least in her late 40s or
[40:42] early
[40:43] 50s. Any children you have after this
[40:46] shall be thine. And now referring back
[40:49] to Manasseh and
[40:51] Ephraim shall be called after the name
[40:54] of their brethren and their inheritance.
[40:57] In other words, they have the same
[40:59] status and rights of inheritance as
[41:01] their two oldest uncles, greater than
[41:04] their cousins.
[41:06] And then the focus of Jacob's
[41:08] conversation seems to begin to
[41:12] wander. Where where was I? He starts to
[41:15] reminisce. As for me, when when I came
[41:18] from Padanaram in Syria, your mother
[41:23] Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan
[41:26] in the way when yet there was but a
[41:28] little way to come to Ephereth. And I
[41:30] buried there in the way of Ephereth, the
[41:33] same as Bethlehem. And Israel became
[41:37] aware of the presence of Joseph's sons
[41:39] and said,
[41:41] "Who who are these? I I thought it was
[41:45] just you and I here." the the fellow
[41:47] said, "Joseph is coming. Who who's
[41:49] there?" And Joseph said unto his father,
[41:52] "They are my sons whom God hath given me
[41:55] in this
[41:56] place." And Jacob said, "But bring them.
[42:01] I I pray thee unto me. I I will bless
[42:04] them." Now the eyes of Israel were
[42:07] dimmed for age. In other words, he had
[42:11] cataracts so that he could not see. And
[42:15] Joseph brought Manasseh and Ephraim near
[42:17] unto Jacob to Israel. And and Jacob
[42:22] kissed them and embraced
[42:25] them. And Israel turned and said to
[42:29] Joseph, "I had not thought to see thy
[42:32] face, and lo, God hath showed me also
[42:36] thy
[42:38] children." And Joseph brought them out
[42:42] from between Israel's knees. They were
[42:44] probably at the foot of Israel's bed and
[42:46] likely bowing to him just respectfully
[42:50] there. And Joseph bowed himself with his
[42:53] face to the earth. And Joseph then rose
[42:56] up and took them both Ephraim in his
[42:59] right hand towards Israel's left
[43:02] hand and Manasseh in his left hand
[43:05] toward Israel's right
[43:09] hand and brought them near unto him.
[43:12] Now, we sometimes envision these two
[43:15] boys as children being led by the hand.
[43:18] They were born during the years of
[43:19] plenty. So, around 10 or 12 when Jacob
[43:22] arrived. This is 17 years later. So,
[43:24] they're close to 30 years old as this
[43:26] scene unfolds.
[43:29] And Israel stretched out his right hand
[43:32] and laid it upon Ephraim's head, who was
[43:34] the younger, and his left hand upon
[43:37] Manass's head, guiding his hands
[43:40] willingly, for Manasseh was the
[43:44] firstborn. The young men are probably
[43:46] kneeling next to the bed on either side
[43:48] so Jacob can touch their heads for the
[43:51] blessing.
[43:56] And Israel blessed Joseph and said,
[43:59] "God, before whom my fathers Abraham and
[44:03] Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all
[44:07] my life long unto this day, the the
[44:10] angel which redeemed me from all evil.
[44:14] Bless the lads. Let my name be named on
[44:17] them and the name of my fathers Abraham
[44:21] and Isaac. and let them grow into a
[44:24] multitude in the midst of the
[44:28] earth. When Joseph saw that his father
[44:31] had laid his right hand upon the head of
[44:33] Ephraim, it displeased him. He held up
[44:37] his father's hand to remove it from
[44:39] Ephraim's head, put it onto Manass's
[44:42] head. Joseph said unto his father,
[44:45] "Oops, not so, my father, but this is
[44:48] the firstborn. Put thy right hand upon
[44:50] his head." Dad, your mind was wandering
[44:53] earlier. Now your hands are wandering
[44:55] too. You crossed your arms when blessing
[44:57] my sons. You're confused. This is
[45:00] important. Let me help you. And his
[45:02] father refused and said, I know it, my
[45:05] son. I know it. He also shall become a
[45:09] people. He also shall be great, but
[45:12] truly his younger brother shall be
[45:15] greater than he and his descendants
[45:18] shall become a multitude of
[45:21] nations. Brother Brandham referred to
[45:24] this multiple times in uh in the
[45:26] countdown from
[45:28] 1964. And he Jacob or Israel had to take
[45:32] Joseph's two sons, Ephri and Manasseh,
[45:35] the the prophet's children, and bless
[45:37] them. And when he did, his hands crossed
[45:40] and and Joseph said, "Father, not so.
[45:43] Put your hands on Ephraim. It should be
[45:44] on
[45:45] Manasseh." Israel said, "God crossed my
[45:49] hands." Taking it from the older son,
[45:52] the law. And putting it up over on
[45:55] Christ. And through that come through
[45:57] the cross come the change of the
[46:00] birthright. Amen. To the younger son. Oh
[46:03] my, how wonderful.
[46:06] Back to
[46:08] Genesis. And Israel blessed them that
[46:10] day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless,
[46:14] saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as
[46:20] Manasseh. And Israel set Ephraim before
[46:25] Manasseh. And
[46:28] is Israel said unto Joseph, "Behold, I
[46:33] die. But God shall be with you, and
[46:36] bring you again unto the land of your
[46:39] fathers.
[46:41] Moreover, I have given to thee one
[46:43] portion above thy brethren, which I took
[46:46] out of the hand of the Amorite with my
[46:48] sword and with my bow."
[46:53] The way things were in those days, the
[46:55] firstborn would inherit a double
[46:58] portion. Jacob has made clear Joseph's
[47:01] position as having the rights and
[47:02] inheritance of the firstborn in that
[47:05] society at that time. And adopting
[47:08] Manasseh and Ephraim, they will get two
[47:10] territories in the eventual return to
[47:12] Canaan under Joshua rather than one,
[47:15] which would have been to Joseph and have
[47:18] been the case if Israel had not adopted
[47:20] these two.
[47:22] The reference to taking from the
[47:23] Amorites by violence may be a reference
[47:26] to the destruction of Sheckchham,
[47:28] although Jacob disavowed this action and
[47:30] condemns Simeon and Levi because of it.
[47:34] However, Joseph's remains will
[47:36] eventually be buried near Shechum and
[47:38] the plot of land Jacob bought before the
[47:41] slaughter of the people of Sheckchham
[47:43] because of the treatment Dina had
[47:44] suffered at their
[47:47] hand. Chapter 49.
[47:51] And Jacob called unto his sons and said,
[47:55] "Gather yourselves together that I may
[47:58] tell you that which shall befall you in
[48:00] the last
[48:01] days. Gather yourselves together and
[48:04] hear, you sons of Jacob. Hearken unto
[48:08] Israel your
[48:10] father." And now Jacob speaks to each of
[48:13] his 12 sons, not including Manasseh and
[48:16] Ephraim.
[48:23] surprise. I'm not going to read these
[48:25] this evening. Our focus is the life of
[48:28] Joseph. And many of the things said by
[48:30] Jacob are difficult to understand,
[48:32] particularly in the context of the last
[48:34] days. Brother Brandham referring to this
[48:37] section of Genesis a few times basically
[48:40] said that they would all be in the land
[48:41] of Israel in the last days. And that's
[48:43] what Jacob said.
[48:45] He never broke down any of the
[48:47] individual blessings that I've been able
[48:49] to find. So he blesses each of his sons.
[48:54] And we get to verse
[48:57] 28. All these are the 12 tribes of
[49:00] Israel. And this is it that their father
[49:02] spake unto them and blessed them.
[49:05] Everyone according to his blessing. He
[49:08] blessed them. And he charged them and
[49:12] said unto
[49:13] them, I am to be gathered unto my
[49:17] people, bury me with my fathers in the
[49:21] cave that is in the field of Ephron the
[49:24] Hitittite, in the cave that is in the
[49:27] field of Mella, which is near Mamray, in
[49:31] the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought
[49:34] with the field of Ephron the Hitittite,
[49:37] for a possession of a burying
[49:40] place. There they buried Abraham and
[49:44] Sarah, his
[49:45] wife. There they buried Isaac and
[49:49] Rebecca, his
[49:50] wife. There I buried
[49:53] Leia. The the purchase of the field and
[49:57] of the cave that is therein was from
[50:00] from the children of
[50:01] Heath. When Jacob had made an end of
[50:04] commanding his sons, he gathered up his
[50:06] feet into the bed and yielded up the
[50:09] ghost, the spirit was gathered unto his
[50:15] people. The story of Joseph is deeply
[50:18] entwined with that of Jacob. Recall the
[50:21] opening verses of chapter 37 when we
[50:24] started this series. 371, Jacob dwelt in
[50:27] the land wherein his father was a
[50:29] stranger in the land of Canaan. These
[50:32] are the generations of Jacob. Joseph
[50:34] being 17 years old was feeding the flock
[50:37] with his brethren. Interesting way to
[50:40] introduce Joseph. Verse three. Israel
[50:43] loved Joseph more than all his
[50:47] children. Back to our story. Jacob has
[50:50] just died in the presence of his sons.
[50:53] Chapter
[50:55] 50. Joseph fell upon his father's face
[50:58] and wept upon him and kissed him.
[51:01] Joseph commanded his servants, the
[51:03] physicians, to embalm his father. And
[51:06] the physicians embombed Israel. It's the
[51:08] the mummification process of
[51:12] Egypt. And 40 days were fulfilled for
[51:15] him. That's how long it takes to perform
[51:18] mummification. For so are fulfilled the
[51:20] days of those which are embaled. And the
[51:24] Egyptians mourned for him for three
[51:26] score in 10 days. 70 days was a standard
[51:29] period for mourning a VIP in Egypt.
[51:33] Remember what we think of as Judaism,
[51:36] Old Testament burial practice had not
[51:39] been originated. This is all hundreds of
[51:41] years before the
[51:44] Exodus. And when the days of Israel's
[51:47] mourning were passed, Joseph spake unto
[51:50] the house of Pharaoh. Joseph didn't
[51:52] speak to Pharaoh. He spoke to the house
[51:55] of Pharaoh to speak to Pharaoh on his
[51:57] behalf, carefully observing Egyptian
[52:00] protocol for his request,
[52:03] saying, "If now I have found grace in
[52:06] your eyes to the house of Pharaoh, speak
[52:09] for me, I pray you, and the ears of
[52:12] Pharaoh, saying, My father Jacob made me
[52:16] swear, saying, Lo, I die, and my grave
[52:19] which I have digged for me in the land
[52:21] of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me."
[52:23] Now therefore, let me go up, I pray
[52:26] thee, and bury my father, and I will
[52:28] come again to
[52:30] Egypt. And Pharaoh said, Go up, bury thy
[52:35] father, according as he made thee
[52:40] swear. And Joseph went up to Canaan to
[52:43] bury his father Jacob. And with him went
[52:47] up all the servants of Pharaoh, the
[52:50] elders of his house, and all the elders
[52:53] of the land of
[52:55] Egypt. The Egyptians are bestowing a
[52:58] huge honor, recognizing Joseph's
[53:01] importance by honoring his father in
[53:04] this way.
[53:06] and all the house of Joseph and his
[53:09] brethren and his father's house, only
[53:12] their little ones and their flocks and
[53:13] their herds they left in the land of
[53:15] Gan. Further evidence to Pharaoh that
[53:18] Joseph will return as he has
[53:22] promised. And there went up with Joseph
[53:25] both chariots, solid wheeled carts as
[53:28] we've discussed before, and horsemen.
[53:31] And it was a very great company.
[53:34] And they came to the threshing floor of
[53:36] Atad, which is beyond
[53:38] Jordan. And there they mourned with a
[53:41] great and very sore
[53:43] lamentation. And Joseph made a mourning
[53:46] for his father. Seven
[53:49] days. Seven days. Mourning is standard
[53:52] practice in Judaism to this day called
[53:55] sitting Shiva. Shiva is the word for
[54:00] seven. Notice something interesting
[54:02] here. The company did not go the most
[54:05] direct route to Canaan, but went a
[54:07] longer route, requiring them to cross
[54:10] the
[54:11] Jordan. This is most likely a similar
[54:13] route used by Moses, with the exception
[54:16] that Moses deterred much further to get
[54:18] to Mount
[54:20] Si. There's extensive Jewish tradition
[54:23] regarding this route, the order in which
[54:25] the 12 sons carried his cactus, the
[54:27] dates, and so forth. I I put a URL at
[54:30] the bottom of the slide if you want to
[54:32] find out more about these traditions and
[54:34] also in tonight's handout. It's uh it's
[54:37] listed there as
[54:39] well. Joseph did not return to Canaan
[54:42] along the route taken by the spice
[54:44] traders 40 years
[54:46] earlier. And when the inhabitants of the
[54:49] land, the Canaanites saw the mourning
[54:52] and the floor of a tad, they said, "This
[54:55] is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians.
[54:58] Wherefore the name of it was called Abel
[55:01] Misraim. Abel meaning morning and
[55:03] Misraim being the name of
[55:07] Egypt, the morning of the Egyptians,
[55:10] which is beyond
[55:11] Jordan. And Jacob's sons did unto him
[55:14] according as he commanded them. for his
[55:17] sons carried him into the land of Canaan
[55:20] and buried him in the cave of the field
[55:23] of Mechilla which Abraham bought with
[55:25] the field for a possession of a burying
[55:28] place of Ephron the Hittite before
[55:31] Mamray. And Joseph returned unto Egypt,
[55:34] he and his brethren, and all that went
[55:36] up with him to bury his father after he
[55:39] had buried his father.
[55:44] Notice the route back is pretty direct.
[55:47] The rabbis also say that Joseph returned
[55:49] on the same route of the spice
[55:51] traders. This of course would have a
[55:54] profound effect on his
[55:55] brothers as well as bring back many
[55:59] unhappy memories for him.
[56:02] Now, the next few verses we're going to
[56:04] read may be a flashback to when Jacob
[56:07] died during the embombing and mourning
[56:10] period rather than after the return of
[56:12] the journey to bury his remains. Kind of
[56:15] a sidebar, something to pay attention
[56:17] to, to notice when you're reading in the
[56:20] Old Testament accounts of uh of
[56:23] different characters and the gospel
[56:25] accounts as well. They're not always
[56:27] chronological.
[56:29] The writers were more concerned about
[56:31] finishing a a thread of
[56:33] content than keeping all of the events
[56:36] in strict time sequence. Each thread
[56:40] tends to be in time order or sequential,
[56:44] but the various threads are often
[56:46] interwoven in
[56:50] time with many flashbacks and many flash
[56:54] forwards. You see that especially in the
[56:56] Gospel of Luke. It's it's very
[56:59] apparent. So from Genesis 49:28 that
[57:02] we've read when Jacob says he's dying
[57:04] through to 5014 that we just finished
[57:07] reading the family returning to Egypt,
[57:09] the threat is of Jacob's dying wish and
[57:11] its fulfillment. So Moses wanted to
[57:13] carry this all the way through and not
[57:15] interrupt it with other
[57:19] considerations. The attitudes of the
[57:21] brothers aren't relevant to this. But
[57:24] the next verses we're going to read from
[57:28] verses 15 to
[57:29] 21, that's another thread that tells of
[57:32] the brother's attitude and Joseph's
[57:34] response. In terms of storyline threads
[57:37] and lessons, it's it's a separate
[57:39] thread. Chronologically, it may have
[57:42] occurred at any point after Jacob's
[57:44] death. Just because it's presented after
[57:47] the return to Goan doesn't mean that it
[57:49] necessarily took place after the
[57:53] return. Back to our
[57:55] story. When Joseph's brethren saw that
[57:58] their father was dead, suggesting that
[58:01] this was concurrent with Jacob's death
[58:03] early in the inbombing period, clearly
[58:05] they didn't need to go to Cain and bury
[58:07] him and come all the way back to realize
[58:09] that he was dead. When they saw the
[58:11] father was dead, they said, "Joseph will
[58:14] probably hate
[58:16] us. And even if he doesn't exactly hate
[58:19] us, he will certainly requite us. He
[58:22] will certainly pay us back for all the
[58:24] evil which we did unto
[58:26] him." So, so from their fear, they said
[58:30] about being their father's sons.
[58:34] They sent a messenger unto Joseph,
[58:36] saying, "Thy father uh did command
[58:40] before he died." It's doubtful that he
[58:43] did. Did command before he died, saying,
[58:46] "So shall ye say unto Joseph, forgive, I
[58:49] pray thee now, the trespass of thy
[58:51] brethren in their sin, for they did unto
[58:54] thee evil. And and now we pray thee,
[58:56] forgive the trespass of the servants of
[58:59] the God of thy father."
[59:02] And Joseph wept when they spake unto
[59:06] him. Joseph wept. What's
[59:11] happening? The brothers cannot accept
[59:15] the grace and love of the brother they
[59:20] hated and had mistreated. They are
[59:22] afraid. It's maybe it's just all an act
[59:24] for Joseph to reunite with Jacob, the
[59:27] father who loved him so much. With Jacob
[59:30] gone, they've heard that Joseph will now
[59:32] punish them
[59:35] harshly. Here's a related little story
[59:37] fragment from brother Brandham about an
[59:39] incident in the Civil War where an
[59:41] unnamed man came to President Lincoln
[59:44] sinking seeking a pardon for a soldier
[59:46] who was to be
[59:48] executed from tested faith produces
[59:51] goods. And Mr. Lincoln, kind-hearted,
[59:54] generous Christian gentleman as he was,
[59:56] said, "I'll do that." and he wrote on a
[59:59] little piece of paper, "Pardon so and
[1:00:02] so, Abraham
[1:00:04] Lincoln." And the man rushed back as
[1:00:06] quick as he could to the prisoner and he
[1:00:08] said, "Sir, I have your pardon." And he
[1:00:11] laid it before him. Oh, he said, "That's
[1:00:14] not a pardon. It's just a piece of
[1:00:17] paper." But he said, "It's your pardon.
[1:00:19] Look, Mr. Lincoln's name is on it. He's
[1:00:21] the president of the United States." He
[1:00:24] said, "If it was Mr. Lincoln's correct
[1:00:26] paper to be gold trimmed. It would have
[1:00:28] a seal and so forth. He said, "But but
[1:00:32] sir, that's the president's
[1:00:35] signature." And he refused to receive
[1:00:37] it. Thought the fellow was only making
[1:00:39] his life even more
[1:00:41] miserable. The next morning, he was shot
[1:00:44] at sunrise. Then there was a signed
[1:00:47] declaration from the president of the
[1:00:49] United States that the man was pardoned
[1:00:51] the day before. And here he was shot.
[1:00:55] Now what? It was tried in the federal
[1:00:58] courts of our land. And here was their
[1:01:00] decision. A pardon is not a pardon
[1:01:03] except it be received as a pardon.
[1:01:07] That's what every word of God is. It's
[1:01:09] salvation to those who receive it that
[1:01:11] way. It's healing to those who receive
[1:01:13] it is
[1:01:15] healing.
[1:01:17] His brother's rejection of Joseph's
[1:01:20] forgiveness is what drives Joseph to
[1:01:23] tears. He cannot understand why they
[1:01:26] continue to reject him, his love for
[1:01:29] them, his grace towards
[1:01:33] them. And his brethren also went and
[1:01:35] fell down before his face, and they
[1:01:37] said, "Behold, we be thy servants rather
[1:01:41] than be prisoners or or executed for
[1:01:44] their evil deeds of the past.
[1:01:48] Joseph said unto them, "Fear not. Am am
[1:01:52] I in the place of
[1:01:54] God?" It's so much like us. Sometimes we
[1:01:58] so often hide behind, Lord, I'm not
[1:02:01] worthy. Another way of saying, "My sin
[1:02:05] is greater than your power to
[1:02:07] forgive. So I have to do something
[1:02:09] besides repenting to earn your favor."
[1:02:15] Joseph goes on, "But as for you, you
[1:02:18] thought evil against
[1:02:21] me, and that's what motivated your
[1:02:23] actions toward me. You're correct in
[1:02:26] knowing that I've not
[1:02:28] forgotten. How can I?" But you are wrong
[1:02:32] in believing I have not forgiven you of
[1:02:36] your sin against
[1:02:38] me. and as you have seen and
[1:02:41] experienced. But God meant it unto good.
[1:02:46] Paul perhaps thinking of Joseph's life
[1:02:49] would later write Romans 8:28. We know
[1:02:52] that all things work together for good
[1:02:55] to them that love God, to them who are
[1:02:57] called according to his
[1:02:59] purpose. God meant it for good to bring
[1:03:02] to pass as it is this day to save much
[1:03:05] people alive.
[1:03:08] Now therefore, fear ye not. I will
[1:03:12] nourish you and your little ones. Again,
[1:03:17] a model of the Christ, who would later
[1:03:19] say in Luke 12:32, "Fear not, little
[1:03:22] flock. It's your father's good pleasure
[1:03:25] to give you the
[1:03:26] kingdom." And Joseph comforted them and
[1:03:30] spake kindly unto them.
[1:03:33] And now the the final thread of this
[1:03:35] story. Moses summarizes the rest of
[1:03:38] Joseph's life, the final 53
[1:03:42] years. And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he and
[1:03:45] his father's house. And Joseph lived 110
[1:03:49] years. Took 12 chapters to cover 57
[1:03:52] years. Now we take one verse to cover
[1:03:55] 53.
[1:03:58] And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the
[1:04:00] third generation, his great great
[1:04:03] grandchildren. The children also of
[1:04:05] Mahair, the son of Manasseh, were
[1:04:07] brought up up upon Joseph's knees as
[1:04:09] great grandchildren. And that doesn't
[1:04:11] mean that he raised them on his knees.
[1:04:13] It means he lifted them up upon his
[1:04:15] knees. Hey kid, oh, you're getting too
[1:04:18] big for my lap
[1:04:19] now. And Joseph said unto his
[1:04:22] brethren, I die. God will surely visit
[1:04:26] you and bring you out of this land unto
[1:04:30] the land which he swore to Abraham to
[1:04:33] Isaac to our father
[1:04:36] Jacob. Joseph took an oath of the
[1:04:39] children of Israel saying God will
[1:04:41] surely visit you and ye shall carry up
[1:04:44] my bones from hence.
[1:04:48] So, Joseph died being 110 years old and
[1:04:52] they embombed him and he was put in a
[1:04:55] coffin in
[1:04:58] Egypt. Genesis opens, "In the beginning,
[1:05:01] God encloses in a coffin in
[1:05:05] Egypt." What a
[1:05:07] contrast. Genesis spends only the first
[1:05:10] two chapters describing creation and
[1:05:13] quickly getting to the first
[1:05:15] people. The next 48 chapters deal with
[1:05:20] people. This tells us something about
[1:05:22] God and the reason for his
[1:05:25] creation. Of the 48 chapters of Genesis
[1:05:28] that deal with people, 12 of them, fully
[1:05:31] one quarter, are about the life of one
[1:05:33] man,
[1:05:35] Joseph. Now, at the end of our story of
[1:05:38] Genesis, it's 1806 BC.
[1:05:43] Joseph has died, but his story isn't
[1:05:47] over.
[1:05:49] Notice, when Jacob died, Joseph was
[1:05:52] allowed to travel to Canaan and bury
[1:05:55] him. Pharaoh not only gave permission,
[1:05:59] but sent a high ranking delegation and
[1:06:02] an honor
[1:06:03] guard. But when Joseph dies, he extracts
[1:06:07] a promise from his people to carry his
[1:06:09] bones, not his body.
[1:06:12] but his body long dead, reduced to bones
[1:06:16] when they leave
[1:06:20] Egypt. Let's take a closer
[1:06:23] look. Why not just take his coffin to
[1:06:25] Canaan and bury him then as was done for
[1:06:28] Jacob? Let's take a closer look at that
[1:06:32] that one verse, that last 53 years of
[1:06:34] Joseph's
[1:06:35] life. Here we have a timeline of
[1:06:38] Joseph's life like we used in part four.
[1:06:40] And by now you all know to bring
[1:06:41] binoculars or opera glasses or or you
[1:06:44] have you know really superior vision
[1:06:46] there in the back so you can see all
[1:06:49] that. This time I've added Jacob's
[1:06:53] death age 147 1859 or 1860 BC and
[1:06:58] Joseph's death age 110 in 1806
[1:07:03] BC. There's another important moment in
[1:07:06] time that we have not yet shown or
[1:07:08] discussed.
[1:07:10] First a review from Exodus. It relates
[1:07:12] Jacob's entry to Egypt with the Exodus,
[1:07:16] that time anchor of the Exodus. Exodus
[1:07:18] 12. Now the sojouring of the children of
[1:07:21] Israel who dwelt in Egypt was 430 years.
[1:07:25] And came to pass at the end of the 430
[1:07:28] years, even the self-same day it came to
[1:07:30] pass that all the hosts of the Lord went
[1:07:32] out from the land of
[1:07:34] Egypt. So that was 18. That was 1446 BC
[1:07:40] of the Exodus. 1876 is when Jacob
[1:07:44] came. But there's another one we hadn't
[1:07:46] talked about. Genesis 15. The The Lord
[1:07:50] said to Abram, "Know of assurityity that
[1:07:52] thy descendants shall be a stranger and
[1:07:55] a land that is not theirs, and shall
[1:07:58] serve them, and they shall afflict them
[1:08:02] 400
[1:08:03] years." 400 years, not 430. and also
[1:08:08] that nation whom they shall serve will I
[1:08:11] judge and afterward shall they come out
[1:08:15] with great
[1:08:17] substance. So this shows the approximate
[1:08:20] start time of the
[1:08:23] oppression
[1:08:24] 1846
[1:08:26] BC. It's 30 years after Jacob arrived
[1:08:30] and 40 years before Joseph dies.
[1:08:35] And this this time of oppression, the
[1:08:37] beginning of it, it's not necessarily
[1:08:39] slavery and making bricks without straw.
[1:08:42] That's to pull the feathers out of the
[1:08:44] nest and get them out of there, but the
[1:08:45] beginning of restrictions on their
[1:08:51] freedoms. Here I've added the pharaohs
[1:08:53] that we saw before along with a time
[1:08:55] anchor that we had from uh establishing
[1:08:58] the year of Senorus threat 3 so we could
[1:09:01] synchronize all of these pharaohs. But
[1:09:04] let's add the rest of the pharaohs of
[1:09:06] Joseph's
[1:09:09] life. We see that Senus 3's son, Amenhat
[1:09:13] III, took the throne of a transformed
[1:09:16] Egypt about the time of Jacob's
[1:09:19] passing. This could also be part of the
[1:09:22] reason Joseph used intermediaries to
[1:09:24] seek permission to bury his father in
[1:09:26] Canaan. Royal succession is always a
[1:09:29] time of some uncertainty. You just look
[1:09:31] at the turmoil in our nation after a
[1:09:33] presidential succession.
[1:09:36] Many
[1:09:37] Egyptologists, people that study ancient
[1:09:40] Egypt, assert that Senus 3 spent some
[1:09:43] years in a co-regency with his son. He
[1:09:46] brought him up and they ruled jointly.
[1:09:48] And they say it could have lasted as
[1:09:50] long as 20 years.
[1:09:52] I don't know if it's true or not, but I
[1:09:54] suspect if it was true, it lasted more
[1:09:56] like 15 years, coinciding with the
[1:09:59] beginning of the 400year period of
[1:10:02] oppression. By the time Joseph dies, yet
[1:10:05] another pharaoh is in
[1:10:07] power. And Joseph has been in retirement
[1:10:10] for many years. The freedoms of the
[1:10:13] Hebrews living in Gan have been under
[1:10:15] some form of restriction for some 40
[1:10:18] years. 1846 BC to 1806 BC. You notice
[1:10:24] periods of 40 years seem to pop up a
[1:10:26] lot. We're told this number 40 is
[1:10:29] associated with judgment. The word
[1:10:32] judgment is often used to mean
[1:10:34] punishment. It generally has a negative
[1:10:37] connotation.
[1:10:39] Well, let's in our mind, let's move
[1:10:41] forward 360 more years to 1446
[1:10:46] BC. God has been working for 80 years
[1:10:49] preparing another special person, Moses.
[1:10:52] And Moses has to deal with another
[1:10:55] Pharaoh.
[1:10:57] This
[1:10:57] time instead of a prophet interpreting a
[1:11:01] pharaoh's dreams and working with the
[1:11:03] receptive Pharaoh to save Egypt, we have
[1:11:06] a prophet performing miracles to
[1:11:08] persuade a reluctant Pharaoh and in the
[1:11:11] process wreaking havoc on
[1:11:15] Egypt, fulfilling what we just read in
[1:11:18] Genesis 15:14. That nation whom they
[1:11:20] shall serve will I judge, and afterward
[1:11:23] shall they come out with great
[1:11:29] substance. Exodus 13. It came to pass
[1:11:32] when Pharaoh had let the people go that
[1:11:34] God led them not through the way of the
[1:11:37] land of the
[1:11:38] Philistines, although that was
[1:11:41] near. For God said, "Perhaps the people
[1:11:45] will repent when they see war and
[1:11:47] they'll want to return to Egypt." No
[1:11:50] perhaps about
[1:11:53] it. But
[1:11:55] God led the people about through the way
[1:11:58] of the wilderness of the Red Sea, just
[1:12:00] like we saw in the route to bury Jacob,
[1:12:02] that map that I showed earlier. And the
[1:12:04] children of Israel went up harness
[1:12:06] carrying all their goods out of the land
[1:12:08] of Egypt. And Moses took the bones of
[1:12:12] Joseph with him, for he had straightly
[1:12:14] sworn the children of Israel, saying,
[1:12:16] "God will surely visit you, and you
[1:12:18] shall carry up my bones away hence with
[1:12:21] you." They took a really long route. It
[1:12:25] was 40 years before they entered the
[1:12:27] land of Canaan. Moses took them to the
[1:12:30] threshold. Joshua took them in.
[1:12:33] For several years after that, they
[1:12:35] fought the Canaanites, taking control of
[1:12:37] only a fairly small portion of the land
[1:12:39] promised to Abraham. But after some
[1:12:42] years, they stopped fighting. Joshua 24,
[1:12:46] we read. And the bones of Joseph, which
[1:12:50] the children of Israel brought up out of
[1:12:53] Egypt, buried they in Sheckchum, and a
[1:12:56] parcel of ground which Jacob bought of
[1:12:58] the sons of Hamore, the father of
[1:13:00] Sheckchham, for 100 pieces of silver,
[1:13:03] and it became the inheritance of the
[1:13:06] children of
[1:13:09] Joseph. Sheckcham is located in Nablus,
[1:13:12] a city in the West Bank, presently under
[1:13:14] control of the Palestinian Authority.
[1:13:17] Sadly, it's been severely damaged in the
[1:13:20] last 25 years. Jewish worshippers are
[1:13:23] generally prevented from
[1:13:26] entering. Usually, if any go in, it's
[1:13:28] between 11:00 p.m. and 3:00 a.m. They
[1:13:31] kind of sneak in because they are not
[1:13:34] welcome. Well, this is a physical
[1:13:37] memorial of Joseph. But what about a
[1:13:39] spiritual one? of all his
[1:13:42] accomplishments, his character, his
[1:13:45] integrity, saving his people, providing
[1:13:49] the place where the family could be
[1:13:50] turned into a nation. What stands out
[1:13:53] the
[1:13:55] most? Paul tells it. Paul tells us what
[1:13:58] it is from God's
[1:14:01] perspective. By faith, Isaac blessed
[1:14:04] Jacob and Esau concerning things to
[1:14:06] come. By faith, Jacob, when he was
[1:14:09] dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph,
[1:14:11] as we read, and worshiped, leaning upon
[1:14:14] the top of his
[1:14:16] staff. By faith, Joseph, when he died,
[1:14:20] made mention of the departing of the
[1:14:22] children of Israel, and gave commandment
[1:14:25] concerning his
[1:14:27] bones. From God's
[1:14:29] perspective, it was his faith in the
[1:14:32] promise that they would return. From our
[1:14:37] perspective, what are the Christlike
[1:14:39] attributes we see and most
[1:14:42] value? For me, the ones I most value are
[1:14:47] forgiveness and grace.
[1:14:51] There are so many lessons we can learn
[1:14:54] from the story of the life of
[1:14:56] Joseph. Here are some. And by the way,
[1:14:59] this list I'm going to read is on the
[1:15:01] reverse side of this evening's handout.
[1:15:03] the musicians would would please
[1:15:05] return. The Bible is not about coverups.
[1:15:10] It's about honesty and accuracy. It's
[1:15:13] about real people in real situations in
[1:15:16] real life. Not comic book superheroes,
[1:15:18] but people exactly like
[1:15:22] us. Our actions and our words have
[1:15:26] consequences.
[1:15:28] God chooses and uses broken people to
[1:15:31] show his will and love, his power and
[1:15:34] love and care. People like me, people
[1:15:38] like
[1:15:39] us. We are all affected by our heritage
[1:15:43] and our childhood. We see and imitate
[1:15:46] characteristics and behaviors of those
[1:15:48] who raised us. We need to live a good
[1:15:52] example. Don't play favorites with your
[1:15:55] children.
[1:15:56] Don't let hatred or jealousy into your
[1:15:59] life. If we love the Lord, all things
[1:16:02] good and bad, work together for our
[1:16:04] ultimate
[1:16:05] good. The bad, the difficult things can
[1:16:09] help build
[1:16:11] character. In all situations, good or
[1:16:14] bad, God's will is that we follow that
[1:16:16] which is good. Rejoice, pray, give
[1:16:21] thanks. Even when things seem
[1:16:24] insurmountable, the situation seems
[1:16:27] impossible. The Lord comforts us.
[1:16:31] Comfort is a promise. Rescue is a
[1:16:35] hope. We are being sent. Just as Joseph
[1:16:39] was sent, just as Jesus was sent,
[1:16:42] neither had an easy journey. We should
[1:16:44] not expect ours to be easy either.
[1:16:49] It's so easy for us to see our lives and
[1:16:51] the circumstances in which we find
[1:16:53] ourselves and lacking the larger picture
[1:16:56] to misunderstand others, even those
[1:16:58] closest to
[1:17:01] us. Be all God made you to be and don't
[1:17:04] allow yourself to limit
[1:17:07] him. Joseph had to confront the ones who
[1:17:10] tormented him and that he had to see
[1:17:14] what he himself was really made of.
[1:17:18] We see those who were his enemies, his
[1:17:21] brothers who hated him, receive grace at
[1:17:24] his hand. They didn't know who he was at
[1:17:27] the time, but he knew who they
[1:17:30] were. Joseph had to forgive what he
[1:17:34] could not
[1:17:35] forget and save those who tried to
[1:17:38] destroy
[1:17:40] him. Our motivation should always be
[1:17:44] based on love, not fear.
[1:17:48] To close this portion of the service and
[1:17:51] this series on the life of Joseph, I'm
[1:17:53] reminded of a song that that was true
[1:17:55] for him and it's true for us. The
[1:17:58] faithfulness of God, his love, and his
[1:18:01] grace. If we could stand and sing
[1:18:05] together the goodness of
[1:18:07] [Music]
[1:18:12] God. I love love love
[1:18:18] you. Your mercy never fails
[1:18:24] me. All my
[1:18:26] days I've been held in your
[1:18:32] hands. From the moment that I wake
[1:18:37] up until I lay my head, I will
[1:18:44] sing of the
[1:18:46] goodness of
[1:18:52] God. All my life you have been faithful.
[1:19:02] All my life you have been so so
[1:19:09] good. With every breath that I am
[1:19:15] able, I will
[1:19:18] sing of the
[1:19:20] goodness of
[1:19:26] God. I love your voice.
[1:19:32] You have led me through the
[1:19:36] fire in the darkest
[1:19:39] night. You are close like no
[1:19:45] other. I've known you as a
[1:19:50] father. I've known you as a friend. I
[1:19:55] have
[1:19:56] lived in the
[1:19:58] goodness of
[1:20:04] God. All my life you have been
[1:20:12] faithful. All my life you have been so
[1:20:17] so good.
[1:20:19] [Music]
[1:20:21] With every breath that I am
[1:20:26] able, I will
[1:20:29] sing of the
[1:20:31] goodness of God. One more time. I love
[1:20:34] your voice. Love your
[1:20:39] voice. You have led me through the fire.
[1:20:45] In the darkest
[1:20:47] night, you are close like no
[1:20:53] other. Know you as a
[1:20:57] father. I know you as a
[1:21:01] friend. I have
[1:21:04] lived in the
[1:21:06] goodness of God.
[1:21:12] All my life you have been faithful.
[1:21:21] All my life you have been so so
[1:21:28] good. With every breath that I am
[1:21:34] able, I will
[1:21:37] sing of the
[1:21:39] goodness of God.
[1:21:42] Amen.
[1:21:43] [Music]
[1:21:45] Amen. Brother L was speaking. I was
[1:21:47] jotting down as fast as I
[1:21:50] could. The
[1:21:53] type between this man
[1:21:57] Joseph and this man that we call
[1:22:00] Christ. Brother Lyle said at the end, he
[1:22:03] said, "What are the what are the
[1:22:06] Christlike values in
[1:22:09] Joseph?" Listen to this.
[1:22:12] Joseph was the most beloved of the
[1:22:15] father just as Jesus was the most
[1:22:17] beloved.
[1:22:19] Joseph was betrayed by his
[1:22:21] brethren just as Jesus was betrayed by
[1:22:25] his
[1:22:26] brethren. Joseph was given a coat of
[1:22:28] many colors and Jesus was seen in the
[1:22:31] book of Revelation with a rainbow over
[1:22:32] his
[1:22:33] head. Joseph was sold for 20 pieces of
[1:22:36] silver and Jesus was sold for 30 pieces
[1:22:38] of silver.
[1:22:41] Joseph dreamed that his
[1:22:44] brothers would bow down before
[1:22:47] him. And Jesus, every knee shall bow and
[1:22:50] every tongue shall confess that Jesus
[1:22:52] Christ is
[1:22:54] Lord. Joseph was falsely accused in
[1:22:57] Piper's house as Jesus was falsely
[1:23:00] accused.
[1:23:03] Two
[1:23:05] prisoners were in prison with Joseph, a
[1:23:08] baker and a butler. One was condemned
[1:23:12] and one was saved. Two thieves were hung
[1:23:15] on the cross with Jesus and one was
[1:23:17] condemned and one was
[1:23:20] saved. The king the king gave Joseph a
[1:23:24] gentile
[1:23:25] bride and Jesus took a gentile bride.
[1:23:31] Joseph ascended to the right hand of
[1:23:33] Pharaoh and Jesus ascended to the right
[1:23:35] hand of
[1:23:36] God. No one could see Pharaoh without
[1:23:40] coming to Joseph
[1:23:42] first. And Jesus said, "I am the way,
[1:23:44] the truth, and the life, and no man can
[1:23:46] come to the Father except by me."
[1:23:49] Joseph's
[1:23:51] brethren did not recognize
[1:23:54] him. I got to read a scripture in
[1:23:57] closing.
[1:23:59] [Music]
[1:24:01] Zechariah 12:10. Remember, Joseph's
[1:24:05] brethren did not recognize him until he
[1:24:08] made himself
[1:24:11] known. And I will pour out I will pour
[1:24:14] upon the house of David and upon all the
[1:24:16] inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of
[1:24:19] grace and of supplications. And they
[1:24:21] shall look upon me whom they have
[1:24:24] pierced, and they shall
[1:24:26] mourn for him as one mourneth for his
[1:24:30] only son, and shall be in bitterness for
[1:24:33] him as one that is in bitterness for his
[1:24:36] firstborn. And they
[1:24:39] cried. And Joseph
[1:24:42] wept when his brethrens came to
[1:24:45] him. And
[1:24:47] Joseph, this is my favorite
[1:24:50] part. And as he was comforting his
[1:24:54] brothers, Joseph told them all, he said,
[1:24:57] "No, God did it that he might preserve
[1:25:02] life." And Jesus Christ himself came to
[1:25:05] this earth that he might give us eternal
[1:25:09] life. Amen. Brother Lia, wonderful,
[1:25:13] wonderful job.
[1:25:17] Yeah, I loved it. That was so
[1:25:22] good. So, I I I uh I put a request in.
[1:25:26] We do
[1:25:28] David.
[1:25:31] Maybe another wonderful type of Jesus
[1:25:36] Christ. I was so blessed by this man,
[1:25:40] Joseph. I I knew the stories but wow the
[1:25:43] way brother Lyall put them together is
[1:25:45] just just absolutely
[1:25:48] inspired anointed and those type of
[1:25:53] studies don't come without a tremendous
[1:25:58] amount of work and study and prayer that
[1:26:02] our brother put in. So I appreciate I
[1:26:04] appreciate brother L. I appreciate what
[1:26:06] he did. I I do want to make an
[1:26:09] announcement this this Sunday. Um I want
[1:26:12] to have a meeting with the youth Sunday
[1:26:17] after service. It'll probably be about
[1:26:19] 12:15 or so. We'll come back in here
[1:26:22] into the uh the sanctuary and we'll get
[1:26:25] lunch. I'll get pizza or something for
[1:26:27] the kids after Sunday morning service. I
[1:26:30] want to talk to you all about uh some
[1:26:32] plans for the youth. And um I I just
[1:26:36] feel in my heart it's time to start
[1:26:38] moving forward w with our youth and our
[1:26:41] youth
[1:26:42] ministry. You feel good?
[1:26:45] It's a special day for
[1:26:48] me. This
[1:26:50] day my son Daniel was born,
[1:26:54] [Applause]
[1:27:03] you know.
[1:27:05] how much I love my
[1:27:07] son and how proud I am of
[1:27:10] him. You know, Sister Lonnie, how much
[1:27:12] you love your kids and how proud you are
[1:27:14] of them and and you want to see them
[1:27:16] prosper and and and you're just so so
[1:27:20] proud of them. I think our heavenly
[1:27:24] father looks down upon us. Wow. And I
[1:27:28] think our love even the love that we
[1:27:31] have a child for a child is nothing
[1:27:34] compared to the love that he has for
[1:27:37] each one of
[1:27:39] us. Another birthday boy, brother
[1:27:41] Jeremy, would you come up and
[1:27:43] close? It's his birthday,
[1:27:47] [Applause]
[1:27:51] too. I like March 12th. Good good buddy
[1:27:56] of mine.
[1:27:57] It's his birthday and my
[1:28:01] [Music]
[1:28:07] [Music]
[1:28:15] boy. Let's pray.
[1:28:18] Gracious heavenly father, we just thank
[1:28:21] you again for opening your word to us
[1:28:26] that we can
[1:28:27] [Music]
[1:28:29] see see history
[1:28:32] itself state so many things that are
[1:28:35] true.
[1:28:38] We just ask you, Father, to be with
[1:28:41] us the rest of the remainder of this
[1:28:44] week. Lord, thank you and bless everyone
[1:28:47] here that
[1:28:51] come. We just ask you to bless all the
[1:28:55] birthdays in
[1:28:59] March. Be with us, Lord, in your
[1:29:01] precious name, Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:29:07] [Music]
[1:29:10] It will be worth it
[1:29:16] all when we see
[1:29:23] Jesus. Life's trials will seem so
[1:29:29] small when we see Christ.
[1:29:37] One glimpse of his dear
[1:29:41] [Music]
[1:29:42] fame. All
[1:29:45] sorrow
[1:29:46] will
[1:29:49] rain. So
[1:29:51] bravely run the
[1:29:56] race till we see Christ.
[1:30:01] [Music]
[1:30:03] It will be worth it
[1:30:09] all. When we see
[1:30:13] [Music]
[1:30:15] Jesus, life's trials will seem so small.
[1:30:23] When we see
[1:30:27] [Music]
[1:30:28] Christ, one glimpse of his dear
[1:30:35] face, all
[1:30:38] sorrow willy
[1:30:42] rain so
[1:30:44] bravely
[1:30:48] run till we see
[1:30:56] [Music]
[1:30:57] to be
[1:30:59] [Music]
[1:31:01] land. this song. I I was I was actually
[1:31:04] I was it was in my study yesterday and I
[1:31:07] was just thanking the Lord and and I
[1:31:12] thought
[1:31:13] about how a lot of times we sing more
[1:31:17] modern songs and and sometimes it
[1:31:19] doesn't resonate with the um the older
[1:31:23] folks and then sometimes we sing the
[1:31:26] older songs and and sometimes those
[1:31:28] don't resonate with the uh the younger
[1:31:31] folks. folks. And I was thinking I was
[1:31:34] like, Lord, there's one song that I
[1:31:37] think resonates with everybody, and
[1:31:39] that's Bula Land. And then just after
[1:31:41] that, Brother Aaron sent out his list
[1:31:43] and it had closing with Bula
[1:31:47] Land. I asked Brother Lyall what the the
[1:31:51] word ba is. So he pulls up scripture and
[1:31:54] he looks bulering to a land where they
[1:31:58] are married and they're together.
[1:32:01] And I didn't know that. And that's why
[1:32:03] we're longing for that. Be with him
[1:32:06] forever. Amen.
[1:32:08] I'm kind of home.
[1:32:16] for a
[1:32:17] [Music]
[1:32:21] country to which I've
[1:32:27] never been before.
[1:32:34] No sad
[1:32:39] goodbye will there be
[1:32:46] smoke for time won't
[1:32:50] [Music]
[1:32:53] last anymore.
[1:33:00] Oh, build a
[1:33:02] [Music]
[1:33:05] land. I'm longing
[1:33:09] for
[1:33:12] you. And
[1:33:18] someday on thee I'll stand.
[1:33:26] There my
[1:33:30] home shall
[1:33:32] be
[1:33:34] [Music]
[1:33:37] turned. Build the
[1:33:43] land. Sweet
[1:33:45] ma land.
[1:33:50] I'm
[1:33:51] looking
[1:33:56] out
[1:33:57] across that
[1:34:02] river to where my
[1:34:08] faith will end inside.
[1:34:15] Oh, there's just a
[1:34:18] [Music]
[1:34:20] few just a few more days to
[1:34:27] labor. And I will
[1:34:34] take my heavenly flower.

[1:34:41] Oh,
[1:34:42] beautiful
[1:34:44] [Music]
[1:34:46] lamb. I am longing
[1:34:50] for you.
[1:34:54] And

[1:35:06] send there my
[1:35:11] home shall
[1:35:14] be turned.
[1:35:16] [Music]

[1:35:24] love
[1:35:26] sweet land. A chorus one more
[1:35:30] time.
[1:35:33] Oh

[1:35:39] longing for you.
[1:35:45] And
