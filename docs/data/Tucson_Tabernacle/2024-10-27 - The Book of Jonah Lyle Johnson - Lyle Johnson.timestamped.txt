[37:01] me and when I think of all he's done and
[37:07] where he brought me from I've got so
[37:12] much to
[37:14] think
[37:24] for sorry thank you
[37:30] [Music]
[37:34] I've uh got a Psalm that I'd like to
[37:37] read to you share with you that uh is
[37:40] related a bit to Jonah I think and uh it
[37:43] was going through my mind when I thought
[37:46] about all this this evening and i' just
[37:48] like to read it to you before I tell you
[37:50] a little bit about this uh this
[37:53] song they that go down to the Sea and
[37:56] ships that do business in Great Waters
[38:00] these see the works of the Lord and his
[38:02] wonders in the Deep for he commandeth
[38:04] and raiseth the stormy wind which
[38:06] lifteth up the waves they mount up to
[38:09] the heaven they go down to the depths
[38:12] their soul is melted because of trouble
[38:15] they reel to and fro and stagger like a
[38:18] drunken man and are at their wits end
[38:21] then they cry unto the Lord in their
[38:25] trouble and he bringeth them out of
[38:27] their
[38:28] stresses he maketh the storm a calm so
[38:31] that the waves thereof are still then
[38:35] are they glad because they be quiet so
[38:38] he bringeth them unto their desired
[38:40] haven oh that men would praise the Lord
[38:44] for his goodness and for his wonderful
[38:48] Works to the children of
[38:51] men about a week
[38:54] ago I was uh having a hard time going to
[38:57] asleep and and a tune started just going
[39:00] through my head very similar to the
[39:02] chorus of what we just sang and it just
[39:04] kept going through my head and going
[39:05] through my head and oh so I got up and
[39:07] tried to grunt a little bit into a
[39:10] microphone and and capture sort of what
[39:12] was going on and there were words that
[39:14] were kind of in the background there
[39:16] that were coming along and so I wrote
[39:19] those down too and and then uh I I
[39:22] shared my grunting with uh sister Martha
[39:26] and she she put it to music and so by
[39:30] God's grace I want to try and find the
[39:33] right space maybe even on the keys this
[39:35] time I'm usually between them somewhere
[39:38] and and try and and and sing this song

[45:48] evening on Wednesday's evenings we've
[45:51] been going through the books of the
[45:52] Bible as our Pastor Daniel has told us
[45:54] we're breaking the pattern a little bit
[45:56] tonight and we're going to have a short
[45:57] lesson from the Book of Jonah before we
[46:00] open our Bibles to look at this book
[46:02] Let's approach the Lord one more time in
[46:04] prayer together Lord
[46:08] Jesus it's such an
[46:10] honor Lord that we can be gathered
[46:13] together in your name in this place at

[46:22] to read your word to listen for you to
[46:25] speak to us Lord to answer questions to
[46:29] answer needs to touch hearts Lord to
[46:32] just move by your spirit in our midst as
[46:34] our desire Lord that you would accept
[46:36] our worship our praise our singing the
[46:40] thoughts of a heart be pleasing to you
[46:43] forgive us Lord of everything that's

[47:12] Lord and Lord if I say something wrong
[47:14] Lord anoint the ears that hear Lord that
[47:17] they'll receive it in the way that it's
[47:18] intended Lord we commit this to you and
[47:22] Lord all we can do is fall on our knees
[47:24] and thank you for all that you've done
[47:27] in Jesus precious name
[47:31] amen while you're standing and for our
[47:34] opening first verses I'd like to read
[47:36] two short accounts now if you've been
[47:38] here on Wednesdays you know that they're
[47:40] not going to be from Jonah the first is
[47:43] going to be from Genesis the second will
[47:46] be from the gospel of Matthew now the
[47:49] Book of Jonah focuses
[47:51] geographically on the Assyrian capital
[47:54] city of Nineveh
[47:57] in Genesis 10 Noah his sons and their
[48:01] wives have exited the ark After the
[48:04] flood we're given an account of Noah's
[48:06] sons and their
[48:09] descendants did I hit the wrong
[48:17] button technical difficulty there we
[48:20] are now these are the generations of the
[48:23] sons of Noah and I've highlighted Shem
[48:26] and ham because they play a part in our
[48:28] story of Jonah tonight Shem ham and yaet
[48:33] and unto them were Sons born After the
[48:35] flood verse six and the sons of ham Kush
[48:39] and misraim and F and Canan and Kush
[48:43] begat Nimrod and he began to be a mighty
[48:46] one in the
[48:47] earth and the beginning of nimrod's
[48:50] kingdom was Babel and ER and aad and
[48:53] khna all in the land of shinar what we
[48:56] think of was Mesopotamia or modern day
[48:58] Iraq and out of that
[49:01] land Shar or Mesopotamia went forth
[49:04] Asher and builded Nineveh and the City
[49:08] of roobot and
[49:10] Kalah okay so you ask yourself who's
[49:13] Asher well going back to Noah's sons
[49:15] they're children of Noah's son Shem Alm
[49:18] and Asher and araxid and L and Aram from
[49:24] this we see that Nineveh was a very an
[49:26] ancient
[49:27] city one of the first mentioned After
[49:31] the flood it was located in the area we
[49:33] think of as Mesopotamia it was founded
[49:36] by Asher which is the Hebrew word for
[49:38] Assyria when you read in your Bible and
[49:39] it says Assyria the word is Asher this
[49:41] gentleman's name Assyria meaning
[49:44] prosperous or successful just a a little
[49:47] fun fact here in in the ruins of a
[49:49] library found in one of the first
[49:51] archaeological digs in what would prove
[49:53] to be Nineveh in 1853 was a set CL
[49:56] tablets and they contain the Epic of
[49:59] gilgames you you may have heard of that
[50:01] it includes a story about the Earth
[50:04] being destroyed by a flood and the
[50:07] tablet with that portion of the story is
[50:09] known as the flood tablet which you see
[50:12] here excavated from the ruins of
[50:16] Nineveh now from the gospel of Matthew
[50:19] Jesus is being challenged by his
[50:21] detractors Matthew 12 you read then
[50:23] certain of the scribes and of the
[50:25] Pharisees
[50:26] answered saying Master meaning
[50:30] teacher show us a sign we would see a
[50:32] sign from thee and Jesus answered and
[50:35] said unto
[50:37] them an evil and adulterous meaning
[50:40] worshiping the wrong thing evil and
[50:42] adulterous generation seeketh after a
[50:44] sign there shall no sign be given to it
[50:48] to
[50:49] you he's in their face right now but the
[50:53] sign of the prophet Jonah
[50:57] for as Jonah was three days and three
[51:00] nights in the and the whale's belly the
[51:03] Greek word means a big sea creature with
[51:06] a gaping mouth Jonah was three days and
[51:09] three nights so shall the son of man be
[51:11] three days and three nights in the heart
[51:12] of the
[51:13] Earth the men of Nineveh shall rise in
[51:17] judgment with this evil and adulterous
[51:20] generation and shall condemn it he's
[51:23] going to these guys that we're going to
[51:26] hear about tonight are going to condemn
[51:28] you scribes and Pharisees because they
[51:33] repented at the preaching of Jonas and
[51:36] behold Jesus says look at me Behold a
[51:40] greater than Jonas is
[51:43] here please be seated I'm I'm sure their
[51:46] knees got weak and they were seated
[51:50] too we've been studying through the
[51:53] Bible and we're now in the area of the
[51:55] Bible that we call the minor prophet
[51:56] Jonah is fifth among this group and
[51:59] they're just called minor because of the
[52:01] short writings that they left not
[52:02] because of the lack of importance of
[52:04] what they said Jonah is one of only two
[52:09] books of the Minor Prophets The Other
[52:11] being n that deal not with Israel or
[52:15] Judah or an Empire like Egypt or Babylon
[52:19] or a neighboring Nation like Edom but
[52:22] with a single Gentile City
[52:26] and they both deal with the same city
[52:31] Nineveh we know very little about Jonah
[52:35] the Book of Jonah is four short chapters
[52:37] a total of only 48 verses the only other
[52:40] reference to him in the Old Testament is
[52:42] a oneliner that tells us where he was
[52:43] from a place called gath heer though
[52:46] separated by Jesus from some 700 years
[52:51] he was from the same part of the Galilee
[52:55] he wasn't from Jerusalem or some place
[52:58] like that he would have been a neighbor
[52:59] of Jesus if they'd lived in the same day
[53:02] I'm going to try and show you some of
[53:03] the many parallels between Jonah and
[53:05] Jesus one of the reasons or purposes of
[53:08] our brief overviews of the books of the
[53:09] Old Testament has been to see where
[53:11] Jesus is portrayed prophesied or
[53:14] otherwise present and we're pressed for
[53:17] time this evening I I was given 20
[53:19] minutes and remember that when I did did
[53:21] the psalm and sang the song that didn't
[53:22] count against the 20
[53:24] minutes so we're going to get right into
[53:26] this book okay so here's an overview the
[53:28] topics of the Book of Jonah it's a story
[53:32] of the Lord sending Jonah to a gentile
[53:34] City and if you fall asleep as long as
[53:37] you heard that song that the Petersons
[53:39] did you've got the book okay so I'm I'm
[53:42] just filling in a little bit in between
[53:44] the lines for you here it's a story of
[53:48] the Lord sending
[53:49] Jonah to a gentile City
[53:54] Nineveh Jonah thought it was all about
[53:56] judgment and destruction on a terrible
[53:58] Place God knew it was about
[54:01] demonstrating his mercy and kindness his
[54:05] grace to those willing to repent and
[54:08] reform to change their ways and to show
[54:11] that such Grace was not limited to the
[54:14] descendants of
[54:17] Jacob so the first thing we read here is
[54:20] Jonah flees the presence of the Lord was
[54:23] now we'll start reading from Jonah 1:1
[54:26] now the word of the Lord came into Jonah
[54:28] the son of amiti saying arise go to
[54:32] Nineveh that great large Mighty proud
[54:35] city cry against it for their wickedness
[54:39] has come up before me must have been
[54:42] pretty wicked for out of all the world
[54:45] this to come to send a prophet here we
[54:48] see the Lord is sending a Jewish Prophet
[54:50] to a gentile City we're given its name
[54:53] told it's a very large city and that the
[54:56] wickedness of it is Extreme and the Lord
[54:59] wants the people there to be warned God
[55:02] always warns Before Destruction giving
[55:05] people an
[55:06] opportunity to turn to him but Jonah
[55:10] rose up to flee flee that's what that's
[55:13] what Joseph did right with the baby
[55:16] Jesus when the angel came and told him
[55:18] about Herod flee to Egypt so Jonah Rose
[55:21] to flee unto tares from the presence of
[55:23] the Lord and went down to japa that's
[55:26] modern day Tel Aviv and he found a ship
[55:29] going to
[55:30] tarses
[55:32] tares immediate question comes to mind
[55:34] where's this tarish that Jonah was
[55:36] attempting to reach the short answer no
[55:40] one really
[55:41] knows many think it refers to a town on
[55:44] the southern coast of Spain I've seen
[55:46] that in many many references oh he was
[55:48] going to go 25 200 miles to okay this is
[55:51] 8th Century BC we know that ships went
[55:53] there but or maybe another name for
[55:56] Tarsus where the Apostle Paul came
[55:58] from we know of a tarses that Solomon
[56:01] sent ship to ships to every 3 years to
[56:04] get silver in gold and apes and ivory
[56:08] you don't find that in Turkey you don't
[56:10] find that in Spain so this does not
[56:13] describe a place on the Mediterranean
[56:14] but most likely on the east coast of
[56:16] Africa in Solomon's time so there's more
[56:18] than one
[56:20] tarses what we do know is that Nineveh
[56:24] is some 500 miles Overland From Galilee
[56:27] on The Tigress River and if you got
[56:29] there by boat or by fish uh it's about
[56:33] 500 mil from the mouth of the Persian
[56:35] Gulf so little hard to get to I
[56:39] personally suspect that it's the Tarsus
[56:41] of Paul it would be reasonable to find
[56:42] ships going up and down the Eastern
[56:44] Mediterranean coast and to be able to go
[56:46] down to a port and find a ship going
[56:49] that way because it was a lot of trade
[56:50] going on on that route It was a
[56:52] commercial route and it was heavily
[56:54] traveled much less likely to find one
[56:56] going to Spain or East Africa and having
[57:00] space for a
[57:03] passenger so let's continue on so Jonah
[57:07] paid the fair thereof went down into it
[57:09] to go with them unto tarses from the
[57:12] presence of the Lord now we aren't told
[57:15] why he thought tarses would get him away
[57:17] from God's presence only that it was his
[57:20] destination and he was desperate to get
[57:22] there as fast as he could to
[57:25] flee but the Lord sent out a great wind
[57:28] into the sea there was a mighty Tempest
[57:31] in the sea so the ship was like to be
[57:42] broken then the Mariners were afraid and
[57:45] cried every man unto his God and cast
[57:47] forth the Wares that were in the ship
[57:48] into the sea lighten it of them you can
[57:51] see in in this uh slide that that ship
[57:55] ships weren't very large they had a
[57:56] single sail a shallow draft there may or
[57:59] may not have been limited cabin space on
[58:01] the main deck the picture in the upper
[58:03] right of the screen here shows how such
[58:05] Merchant ships were loaded they had a
[58:06] very almost flat a very shallow rounded
[58:09] bottom of a hall it's great if you're in
[58:11] calm water not so good if the WEA is
[58:13] choppy so the bottom of the hall because
[58:16] it's not a nice deep V like we'd have in
[58:18] a modern ship they filled it with rocks
[58:19] for ballast in order to keep the ship
[58:22] basically upright the inner deck
[58:24] covering the ballast was unloaded with
[58:25] Goods to be transported which were
[58:27] segregated and loaded in the HS
[58:29] passengers and Crews might be on this
[58:31] level as well the top deck had Goods
[58:35] lashed down and these typically be the
[58:36] lightest Goods again to maintain the
[58:38] balance of the ship so to empty the ship
[58:41] of its Wares especially in a storm the
[58:43] crew would have to unsecure the cargo
[58:45] crates and jars and carry or hand them
[58:47] up to the top deck to be tossed
[58:50] overboard and as we read in Psalms 107 a
[58:53] little earlier ships were very unstable
[58:55] in a storm Rising near the crest of the
[58:57] wave and down into the trough making
[58:59] this an arduous a very dangerous
[59:03] undertaking but Jonah was gone out into
[59:06] the sides of the ship and he lay and was
[59:09] fast
[59:10] asleep so the ship Master the the
[59:13] captain came to him and said
[59:16] Jonah what meanest thou o sleeper arise
[59:19] call upon thy God if so be that God will
[59:22] think upon us that we perish
[59:24] not you recognize a similar situation
[59:28] with Jesus and the gospels he was
[59:30] sleeping on a ship being tossed about in
[59:33] a storm on the Sea of Galilee the
[59:35] disciples some of whom were experienced
[59:37] fishermen on that Lake were in fear of
[59:39] their lives and went to wake Jesus Mark
[59:43] 4:35 to 38 for those of you taking notes
[59:47] yeah so what's next Jonah is thrown into
[59:51] the sea so back to Jonah the the sailors
[59:54] determined that Jonah is the cause of
[59:55] the
[59:57] problem so they said unto him the
[59:59] Mariners said to Jonah what shall we do
[1:00:01] unto thee that the ship may be common
[1:00:03] unto us for the sea rought and was
[1:00:06] tempestuous and Jonah said to
[1:00:10] them take me up cast me forth into the
[1:00:14] sea so shall the sea be calm unto
[1:00:17] you for I know that for my sake this
[1:00:19] great Tempest is upon
[1:00:22] you nevertheless the men rode hard to
[1:00:25] bring the ship to the land but they
[1:00:27] could not for the sea rot and was
[1:00:29] tempestuous tempestuous against them and
[1:00:32] understand that in these days they
[1:00:33] didn't have compasses they didn't have
[1:00:35] navigation things they batteries were
[1:00:37] dead in their GPS so they always sailed
[1:00:40] close to Land close to shore where they
[1:00:42] could see land it was never far away
[1:00:44] which also meant that they were on
[1:00:46] typically pretty shallow water which
[1:00:49] meant that any storm coming was going to
[1:00:50] be particularly severe if you've ever
[1:00:52] done any scuba diving or just brought in
[1:00:55] a boat from the shore in the ocean where
[1:00:56] it's just a little bit wavy as you get
[1:00:58] close to short tends to get really
[1:01:00] choppy because of the of the of the
[1:01:02] slope and the currents in the motion and
[1:01:04] so
[1:01:04] forth wherefore they Cried unto the Lord
[1:01:08] why would they cry unto the Lord why
[1:01:11] would they cry to Jonah's God because
[1:01:13] they understood that it was Jonah's God
[1:01:15] that was mad with them it wasn't their
[1:01:17] gods they' already figured that out so
[1:01:19] they're crying to Jonah's God we beseech
[1:01:21] thee Oh Lord we beseech thee let us not
[1:01:24] perish for this man's life and let not
[1:01:26] Upon Us innocent blood for thou oh Lord
[1:01:28] Hast done as it pleased
[1:01:31] thee so they took up Jonah and cast him
[1:01:34] forth into the sea and the Sea ceased
[1:01:37] from her raging then the men feared the
[1:01:39] Lord exceedingly and offered a sacrifice
[1:01:41] under the Lord and made vows in Mark 6
[1:01:45] we read of disciples rowing against a
[1:01:47] strong wind Jesus walks on the water as
[1:01:50] soon as he enters the boat the storm
[1:01:54] ceases like the Mariner and Jonah's both
[1:01:56] the disciples we were told were sore
[1:01:58] amazed in themselves beyond measure and
[1:02:01] wondered in Jonah's case he had to be
[1:02:04] cast out of the boat for the storm to
[1:02:06] cease in Jesus case he had to come into
[1:02:09] the boat for the storm to cease in both
[1:02:11] cases those in the boat were
[1:02:14] amazed well what happens next a great
[1:02:18] fish swallows Jonah so Jesus is in the
[1:02:20] boat but what about
[1:02:22] Jonah now the Lord had prepared a great
[1:02:26] fish to swallow up Jonah and Jonah was
[1:02:31] in the belly of the fish three days and
[1:02:34] three
[1:02:35] nights and that brings us to the
[1:02:37] parallel from our opening scriptures
[1:02:39] where Jesus said that he that as Jonah
[1:02:42] was in the belly of the fish for three
[1:02:43] days and nights so Jesus would be in the
[1:02:46] heart of the
[1:02:48] earth what's the first thing Jonah did
[1:02:51] he prayed he prayed to the Lord he
[1:02:53] couldn't see if the storm calmed or not
[1:02:55] he was an in a terrible and fearful
[1:02:56] situation the storm was the last thing
[1:02:58] on his mind at this point this is not a
[1:03:01] Disney cartoon of Pinocchio the puppet
[1:03:04] boy and monstro the whale this is a
[1:03:06] unique as they said in the song a real
[1:03:09] life event is it true yes it's true
[1:03:13] let's read then Jonah prayed unto the
[1:03:15] Lord his God out of the fish's belly and
[1:03:17] said I cried by reason of mine
[1:03:20] Affliction unto the Lord he's no longer
[1:03:23] running he's no longer Aid avoiding the
[1:03:26] Lord he's turning to the
[1:03:28] Lord and he heard
[1:03:31] me out of the belly of Hell cried I and
[1:03:35] thou heardest my voice skipping down to
[1:03:38] verse N I will sacrifice unto thee with
[1:03:41] all that I have what does he have he's
[1:03:44] in the belly of a fish what does God
[1:03:46] really want from us the voice of
[1:03:48] Thanksgiving I will pay that I have
[1:03:51] vowed salvation is of the Lord
[1:03:56] word and the Lord spake unto the fish
[1:03:58] and it vomited Jonah out upon the dry
[1:04:02] land how he was kept alive or preserved
[1:04:06] or breathed inside that sea creature we
[1:04:08] don't know a brother random spoke about
[1:04:10] Jonah many times and said he didn't know
[1:04:13] what we do
[1:04:15] know is that after three days and nights
[1:04:18] Jonah was spit out of the fish onto the
[1:04:21] shore and he was
[1:04:23] alive well what happens next
[1:04:27] oh Jonah's not fleeing the presence
[1:04:29] Jonah goes to Nineveh we don't know how
[1:04:31] long afterwards we don't know ex exactly
[1:04:34] where he was but the Lord had Jonah's
[1:04:40] attention the word of the Lord came unto
[1:04:43] Jonah the second time saying arise go
[1:04:47] into Nineveh that great City and preach
[1:04:50] unto it the preaching that I bid thee
[1:04:56] so Jonah arose and again tried to flee
[1:04:59] from the presence no no Jonah arose and
[1:05:02] he went unto Nineveh according to the
[1:05:05] word of the lord we can only speculate
[1:05:09] how long it took by what means he
[1:05:11] traveled it seems likely that some
[1:05:14] people witnessed his ejection from the
[1:05:16] Monstrous fish and would have followed
[1:05:17] him to see what might happen to share
[1:05:19] the amazing Miracle of Jonah's arrival
[1:05:21] on their Shores God doesn't usually do
[1:05:24] things in the shadow
[1:05:26] but in the open further there were many
[1:05:30] tens of gods worshiped in Nineveh and a
[1:05:32] fish God was among them this would give
[1:05:35] further impact to Jonah's Miracle now we
[1:05:38] read Nineveh was an exceeding great city
[1:05:41] of three days journey that doesn't mean
[1:05:43] it takes three days to get there it
[1:05:44] means it would take you three days to go
[1:05:46] through the place this is a big
[1:05:49] place remember it was about 500 Miles
[1:05:52] Overland from japa where he got on the
[1:05:54] boat about 4 450 mil from his home in
[1:05:57] giley it's like walking from Tucson to
[1:06:02] Albuquerque here's a satellite view to
[1:06:04] give you an idea of the perspective I've
[1:06:05] shown Jerusalem japa where he got on the
[1:06:08] boat and Nineveh where he was headed way
[1:06:11] up on the Tigris
[1:06:16] River at the time of Jonah this is a
[1:06:19] little hard to see but those of you
[1:06:21] sitting in the back understand why we
[1:06:23] always encourage people to sit in the
[1:06:24] front
[1:06:26] at the time of Jonah the Assyrian Empire
[1:06:28] was still expanding it included the two
[1:06:31] darker shades of green that you see here
[1:06:33] but that light shade of green it hadn't
[1:06:36] reached those borders yet it'd be some
[1:06:38] 40 years after Jonah's Ministry that
[1:06:41] Assyria would conquer Israel and
[1:06:43] subjugate
[1:06:46] Judah this is uh just one artist idea
[1:06:50] based on different archaeological things
[1:06:52] and and texts and so forth of what it
[1:06:55] might have looked like in ancient
[1:06:57] Nineveh it was not only the capital of
[1:07:00] the Assyrian Empire it was a major
[1:07:02] Center of Commerce on major eastwest and
[1:07:05] Norths South trade routes you might say
[1:07:08] all roads lead to
[1:07:12] Nineveh this is a picture of one of the
[1:07:14] gates of Nineveh that was uncovered and
[1:07:17] partially restored prior to the general
[1:07:19] destruction a decade or so ago from Isis
[1:07:22] you can see I've circled with an oval
[1:07:24] there a human headed bull at the lower
[1:07:27] right of the entry circled in yellow the
[1:07:29] arrow that I put next to it is about
[1:07:32] I've got shoes on about my height about
[1:07:33] six
[1:07:35] feet gives you an idea the size of that
[1:07:38] gate that is an impressive massive
[1:07:42] intimidating
[1:07:45] structure and Jonah began to enter into
[1:07:47] the city a Day's Journey and he cried
[1:07:50] and said yet 40 days and Nineveh shall
[1:07:53] be overthrown
[1:07:55] interesting word overthrown we don't
[1:07:58] know anything other than this title of
[1:08:01] his sermon or sermons or prophecies to
[1:08:04] the people of Nineveh we don't know for
[1:08:06] how many days he was among them
[1:08:08] preaching proclaiming the word of the
[1:08:10] Lord if he was like any of the other
[1:08:12] prophets and if the Lord is consistent
[1:08:14] he would have been telling the people to
[1:08:17] repent so the people of
[1:08:20] Nineveh believed God that is they
[1:08:23] believed the word of the Lord that Jonah
[1:08:25] spoke no doubt influenced by the miracle
[1:08:28] of his survival inside the sea creature
[1:08:31] and proclaimed a fast put on sackcloth
[1:08:34] from the greatest of them even to the
[1:08:38] least of
[1:08:40] them in this section we see that the
[1:08:42] preaching of Jonah saying what the Lord
[1:08:44] told him to say back in verse one is
[1:08:48] effective for word came unto the king of
[1:08:51] Nineveh and he arose from his throne and
[1:08:54] laid his Ro robe from him and covered
[1:08:56] him with sackcloth and sat in ashes this
[1:09:00] is a sign of mourning and of humility
[1:09:02] skipping to verse eight he said let man
[1:09:06] and Beast be covered with sackcloth and
[1:09:08] cry mightily unto God yay let them turn
[1:09:13] everyone from his evil way and from the
[1:09:16] violence that is in their
[1:09:19] hands the background in this
[1:09:22] slide is a detail from a bronze gate of
[1:09:24] Bell a city near Nineveh of the same era
[1:09:27] from a photo I took at the British
[1:09:29] museum the ninevites the Assyrians were
[1:09:33] an exceedingly cruel and violent people
[1:09:36] I'd left the text obscuring the image on
[1:09:39] purpose there's children here I don't
[1:09:41] want to scare them but there are heads
[1:09:45] hung around the city gate men with their
[1:09:48] hands and feet cut off piles of hands
[1:09:50] and feet on the ground another man
[1:09:52] impaled on a spike afterwards these are
[1:09:56] cruel wanly
[1:09:59] violent Wicked people this is embossed
[1:10:03] on this City Gate warning anyone who
[1:10:06] comes this is a powerful Empire
[1:10:09] tolerates no breaking of its rules you
[1:10:12] have no rights once you enter these
[1:10:14] Gates a place without Mercy a place that
[1:10:17] Rules by
[1:10:20] violence back to the king's Proclamation
[1:10:23] turn everyone from his evil away in from
[1:10:25] the violence who can tell if God will
[1:10:28] turn and and repent turn away from his
[1:10:31] Fierce anger that we perish
[1:10:34] not repent of course means to change
[1:10:36] direction to turn around not God
[1:10:39] repenting from sin but his happiness
[1:10:41] that the people were changing their
[1:10:44] Direction and God heard their words Lord
[1:10:47] if he'll do this and that I promise I'll
[1:10:48] serve you it's not what it says God saw
[1:10:53] their works didn't listen to what they
[1:10:56] said he saw what they did he observed
[1:10:59] their actions that they turned from
[1:11:02] their evil way and God repented of God
[1:11:06] turned from the evil that he had said
[1:11:09] that he would do unto them and he did it
[1:11:14] not this is an unprecedented event again
[1:11:18] Nineveh was the capital of Assyria the
[1:11:21] Assyrian Empire was vast the Army
[1:11:23] ruthless the laws were harsh
[1:11:26] punishment wanly
[1:11:28] cruel think of a rabbi today going to
[1:11:32] the IAH and Iran and telling him Terran
[1:11:37] was going to be destroyed by the god of
[1:11:40] Israel in 40
[1:11:43] days how do you think he'd be received
[1:11:46] by the Ayatollah in tan
[1:11:48] today well that's the sort of place and
[1:11:51] the kind of regime that Jonah was sent
[1:11:54] to
[1:11:56] but the people of Nineveh did repent
[1:11:59] from the King to the lowest person even
[1:12:02] the animals were made to
[1:12:05] fast turns out that Jonah wasn't pleased
[1:12:09] with this result and the Lord then
[1:12:12] proceeded to kindly teach
[1:12:14] him a lesson about the value of human
[1:12:17] and even animal life but oh I'm out of
[1:12:21] time and wait wait I see someone coming
[1:12:24] in the main entrance of the
[1:12:26] sanctuary could it be
[1:12:28] Jonah did you hear what the rabbi said
[1:12:32] about these people of
[1:12:35] Nineveh did you hear how evil they were
[1:12:37] and how filthy they were and all the
[1:12:39] problems that they caused and all of all
[1:12:42] of the filth that's in Nineveh did you
[1:12:44] hear about that do you hear what he said
[1:12:46] he was
[1:12:47] kind they were
[1:12:49] bad they were
[1:12:52] immoral they were violent
[1:12:55] they were
[1:12:56] evil so here I am a servant of the
[1:13:02] Lord and God tells me to go to that
[1:13:07] filthy Wicked place of
[1:13:11] neveh did I get him right or did I get
[1:13:15] him
[1:13:17] wrong you have a place there's this
[1:13:20] place here in these United States it's
[1:13:22] called Los
[1:13:23] Angeles you know play have you heard of
[1:13:25] to that place has anybody been there to
[1:13:26] Los Angeles what's it
[1:13:29] like it's
[1:13:31] awful it's bad
[1:13:34] huh yeah have like nasty people walking
[1:13:38] down the streets and and and uh they
[1:13:41] have like stars in in the in the ground
[1:13:43] and memorials and monuments and and
[1:13:45] idols and all of that this place n of it
[1:13:49] was like
[1:13:50] that so then God tells me go to this
[1:13:55] Place
[1:13:56] Nineveh and cry out against
[1:14:00] it I'm not going to that place brother
[1:14:02] Joe it's
[1:14:05] nasty so I go down to
[1:14:07] Jaffa and I pay my money and I get a
[1:14:10] ticket and off I go to a place called
[1:14:16] Tarsus very nice fine Jewish people
[1:14:19] there it's a nice place this place tarus
[1:14:23] so I get in the boat and I'm going along
[1:14:25] and and we're cruising along I don't
[1:14:28] know how you sisters walk in these
[1:14:30] [Laughter]
[1:14:33] things almost fell back there you need a
[1:14:37] split now I can
[1:14:39] [Laughter]
[1:14:42] see
[1:14:44] so I'm going along and I'm in the
[1:14:48] boat
[1:14:49] and I want to get some rest it's a long
[1:14:52] way so I go down in the bottom in the
[1:14:55] middle of the boat and there's this nice
[1:14:57] bed there I lay down and I'm resting
[1:15:00] really
[1:15:01] well and I'm
[1:15:03] asleep and all of a sudden one of these
[1:15:06] Heathen Gentiles that were up in the
[1:15:07] boat one of the Mariners you know
[1:15:09] they're rough they cuss they do all
[1:15:10] kinds of bad stuff they're violent they
[1:15:12] would fit perfect in Nineveh but he
[1:15:14] comes down he says wake up wake up you
[1:15:16] sleeper get up get up come up with we're
[1:15:19] we're about to
[1:15:20] perish I was like what you know the
[1:15:23] boat's rocking I get up there and the
[1:15:25] the wind is blowing and there's
[1:15:27] lightning and there's rain and and
[1:15:28] there's water all over and the waves are
[1:15:30] coming up over the boat and I and I'm
[1:15:32] there and they're asking everybody what
[1:15:34] are you what's going on and everybody
[1:15:36] starts all of these heathens start
[1:15:38] praying to their own
[1:15:40] Gods my God yeah that's going to do a
[1:15:42] lot of
[1:15:44] good and this one's praying to that God
[1:15:46] and that one's praying praying to this
[1:15:50] God I almost fell off the side and this
[1:15:53] one's it's modest and then this one's
[1:15:56] going over this one and that
[1:15:58] one
[1:15:59] and and I
[1:16:04] say watching and they they have this way
[1:16:09] of finding out the truth and they take
[1:16:13] these like their Dice and they they
[1:16:15] throw them
[1:16:18] out and they knew that it was
[1:16:22] me and they're throwing all their stuff
[1:16:24] over overboard they're trying to lighten
[1:16:26] the ship and they look over at me and
[1:16:28] they say you're the
[1:16:31] one what do we
[1:16:33] do the ship's going to
[1:16:38] sink and I say
[1:16:40] well here's what
[1:16:42] happened you know you're praying to all
[1:16:44] your Gods I serve the true
[1:16:48] God I serve the god that created the sea
[1:16:51] I serve the god that created the land
[1:16:54] and my God told me to go to this place
[1:16:57] Nineveh but now I'm on this boat going
[1:17:00] to
[1:17:01] Tarsus I said are you
[1:17:04] crazy what are you doing if you're God's
[1:17:07] real and he told you to go to Tarsus or
[1:17:11] told you to go to Nineveh why are you
[1:17:13] going to
[1:17:15] Tarsus they said what do we
[1:17:18] do and I said well really the best
[1:17:23] way for you to survive
[1:17:27] this my God is the god he's the almighty
[1:17:32] Jehovah take me throw me over the boat
[1:17:36] throw me into this Raging
[1:17:39] Sea and
[1:17:41] then you'll be safe they didn't want to
[1:17:44] do it I saw that these men weren't what
[1:17:48] I thought they
[1:17:50] were and they started
[1:17:52] praying and they didn't pray to their
[1:17:54] God
[1:17:55] gods they prayed to the God that I told
[1:17:59] them about and they were asking for
[1:18:02] Mercy they said they said Lord Lord God
[1:18:05] we don't want to throw this man
[1:18:07] over I said throw me
[1:18:10] over so they took me they did as I asked
[1:18:15] they threw me overboard and then they
[1:18:18] made a sacrifice to the one true God
[1:18:23] Jehovah and the wind
[1:18:25] stopped and the rain stopped and the
[1:18:28] boat the men on the boat were
[1:18:31] safe and into the water I
[1:18:34] went and down I went and I thought my
[1:18:38] life was over and out of the depths
[1:18:40] comes this giant fish or
[1:18:45] whale swallows me
[1:18:48] up brings me
[1:18:51] down to the bottom
[1:18:56] and I
[1:18:58] thought I was running away from
[1:19:01] God I had left the presence of God and
[1:19:05] if you leave the presence of God you
[1:19:08] never know what calamity is going to
[1:19:10] come across you never know what's going
[1:19:12] to happen to you but I had left the
[1:19:14] presence of God and here I am in this in
[1:19:17] this whale
[1:19:20] stomach it was dark and terrifying there
[1:19:23] was seaweed around my neck
[1:19:26] neck and here I
[1:19:29] am and I cried out to
[1:19:33] God and he heard
[1:19:35] me and when I knew that God had heard
[1:19:39] me I said Lord one day I don't know how
[1:19:44] it's going to happen but one day I will
[1:19:47] again look towards your Holy Temple and
[1:19:49] I will again pray to that Holy Temple I
[1:19:52] had faith in God that he could deliver
[1:19:54] me down there for three days and three
[1:19:56] nights I was in the belly of the whale
[1:19:58] and my oxygen was running out and and my
[1:20:00] my death was upon
[1:20:03] me I was in the very belly of
[1:20:08] hell and yet God heard
[1:20:12] me
[1:20:13] fish swims
[1:20:17] up and spits me out on dry
[1:20:22] land came out
[1:20:26] smelling like whale vomit brother L
[1:20:30] brother Lionel you ever get whale vomit
[1:20:32] in your beard you can never get it out
[1:20:34] it just stays there forever it just it's
[1:20:36] smells bad it's gross you can't you
[1:20:37] can't get it out you never have don't
[1:20:40] it's terrible it is smelling and bad and
[1:20:43] and and then the Lord tells me again
[1:20:46] tells me the same thing that he told me
[1:20:48] at the beginning he said go to Nineveh
[1:20:51] and cry out to these
[1:20:53] people I I wish I would have done it the
[1:20:55] first
[1:20:57] time but now I
[1:21:00] go and I go to this
[1:21:03] place and I cry out to these people of
[1:21:07] neveh and I tell them
[1:21:09] that within 40 days God will
[1:21:15] overthrow this
[1:21:18] city and it felt
[1:21:20] good I was out there and I was I was
[1:21:23] prophesying against it and I figured
[1:21:26] here it comes brother Joe they're coming
[1:21:28] down and there these going to be these
[1:21:30] invading armies and they are going to
[1:21:32] overthrow this
[1:21:35] city but many times a prophet he will
[1:21:41] prophesy and he won't know the meaning
[1:21:43] of his
[1:21:44] prophecy he is just speaking in the name
[1:21:46] of the Lord he speaks it out Isaiah was
[1:21:49] a little bit before my time not much but
[1:21:50] he was a little bit before my time and
[1:21:52] do you remember when he prophesied a
[1:21:53] virgin sh conceive and bear a son you
[1:21:56] remember that that when Isaiah the
[1:21:57] prophet
[1:21:59] prophesied I can't speak for Isaiah
[1:22:01] because Isaiah didn't know him he was a
[1:22:02] little bit before me
[1:22:04] but I don't think he knew what he was
[1:22:07] saying I think it was the Holy Spirit
[1:22:10] speaking through his Prophet God's
[1:22:12] prophet and prophesying that this was
[1:22:15] going to happen so here I am and I was
[1:22:17] prophesying in the name of the Lord that
[1:22:19] 40 days and this city would be
[1:22:23] overturned
[1:22:27] overthrown and then the word gets to
[1:22:31] this filthy
[1:22:34] evil Governor or king of this city of
[1:22:38] Nineveh yeah it's going to happen to you
[1:22:42] man and you know what he
[1:22:44] did he
[1:22:47] repented and he
[1:22:50] said
[1:22:52] maybe maybe he didn't even know for sure
[1:22:56] he said
[1:22:57] maybe if we repent and we turn back from
[1:23:01] our evil ways
[1:23:04] maybe God will have mercy on
[1:23:07] us so he should a decree he said
[1:23:10] everyone
[1:23:11] fasts he said even the animals fast he
[1:23:15] said no one eats and everyone repents of
[1:23:17] their evil ways and everyone go back and
[1:23:20] I'm sitting
[1:23:22] there I'm like these people are sinners
[1:23:25] they're evil they're
[1:23:29] trash let them die but no they
[1:23:34] repented and they they changed their
[1:23:37] ways which is very odd to me think about
[1:23:40] Los Angeles think about the filth San
[1:23:43] Francisco or Las Vegas think about the
[1:23:46] filth that's there this Nineveh was like
[1:23:50] that I wanted it destroyed
[1:23:54] but God sent me there for a reason and
[1:23:57] now I'm
[1:23:58] there I go up on the
[1:24:01] hill and I sit
[1:24:07] down and it's
[1:24:11] hot sun's coming
[1:24:13] down the sun's beating
[1:24:16] down and if you're challenged on the top
[1:24:19] like I am you really know when the sun's
[1:24:23] coming down
[1:24:25] it's
[1:24:26] miserable built a little booth tried to
[1:24:29] get some
[1:24:31] shade and you know what God cared for
[1:24:34] me God loved
[1:24:37] me
[1:24:39] and there grew
[1:24:41] up this
[1:24:44] plant in the tender loving care of
[1:24:48] Jehovah it grew over my head to shade
[1:24:53] brother Manny bald
[1:24:56] head and it felt so good man I just love
[1:25:01] this
[1:25:03] plant that had
[1:25:05] grown and then night time
[1:25:08] came and a
[1:25:10] worm somehow got into this plant and by
[1:25:15] morning the plant was
[1:25:21] dead was dead
[1:25:24] [Laughter]
[1:25:27] sister Martha made that very
[1:25:30] well it was
[1:25:32] dead the Sun starts beating down on
[1:25:38] me and I was like Lord let me just
[1:25:41] die this is terrible I got the sun
[1:25:43] beating down and my my plant died I
[1:25:45] loved that plant it was it it grew up
[1:25:48] and it shaded my my head and Lord you
[1:25:51] gave me this plant and it was so nice
[1:25:53] and now the plant
[1:25:54] dead and I'm burning up in the sun Lord
[1:25:57] let me just die and sometimes brothers
[1:26:00] and sisters sometimes when that
[1:26:02] anointing will come upon you as It Came
[1:26:04] Upon
[1:26:05] me when the anointing
[1:26:08] leaves there's a depression that follows
[1:26:12] in a
[1:26:13] suffering and after I had prophesied in
[1:26:17] the name of the Lord to these people of
[1:26:19] Nineveh I came back and I just got down
[1:26:22] and I got sad and I got upset and then
[1:26:25] the Lord gives me this shade and then
[1:26:27] the worm takes it away and I love this
[1:26:29] PL I say Lord I this this is the best
[1:26:32] plant and now it's dead I just want to
[1:26:34] die just take me just kill me I don't
[1:26:36] want to be here
[1:26:39] anymore and then the Lord spoke to me
[1:26:42] Rabbi can you open your Bible up yes
[1:26:45] sir then the Lord spoke to
[1:26:49] me and he
[1:26:51] said you are more worried
[1:26:56] about this
[1:26:59] plant than you are about those
[1:27:04] 120,000 Souls that are in
[1:27:07] Nineveh he said is that right Rabbi can
[1:27:10] you read those last few few verses yes
[1:27:14] Jonah then said the
[1:27:17] Lord thou Hast had pity on the gourd for
[1:27:20] the which thou Hast not labored
[1:27:26] sorry which thou Hast not labored
[1:27:29] neither mest It Grow which came up in a
[1:27:32] night and perished in her
[1:27:34] night and should not I spare Nineveh
[1:27:37] that great City where in are more than
[1:27:40] six score, 120,000 persons that cannot
[1:27:45] discern between their right hand and
[1:27:48] their left hand and also much
[1:27:52] cattle and
[1:27:55] us we have the
[1:27:57] end of my
[1:27:59] book and it ends with a question why are
[1:28:03] you thinking more about this gourd
[1:28:07] plant why is it more important to you
[1:28:09] than 120 Souls 120,000 Souls out there
[1:28:13] in Los Angeles I mean in
[1:28:16] Nineveh or Las Vegas or San
[1:28:20] Francisco and we think that and tucon we
[1:28:23] think that there are prophecies that are
[1:28:25] going to come there are prophecies from
[1:28:27] real prophets my prophecy that I
[1:28:31] prophesied said that 40 days in this
[1:28:35] this city would be overrun the Hebrew
[1:28:41] word Rabbi what is the Hebrew word oh
[1:28:44] give me a moment to look that up in my
[1:28:46] scroll
[1:28:49] son you appreciate our Rabbi amen
[1:28:58] this Hebrew word that I can't pronounce
[1:29:01] I'm
[1:29:02] sure I learned English and now I forgot
[1:29:05] my Hebrew oh we're wanting the over the
[1:29:07] overturned right overturned yes
[1:29:09] overturned okay I'm in I'm in the wrong
[1:29:11] place on this scroll it's these Scrolls
[1:29:13] I tell you I believe it's like uh maybe
[1:29:16] 3 seven
[1:29:19] yeah up up up up and it's I'm in the
[1:29:22] wrong it's it's three yes I'm in the I'm
[1:29:26] I I got the wrong scroll
[1:29:32] here over yes here we
[1:29:39] go when us rabbis get old we get
[1:29:43] slow the uh the the word is
[1:29:48] neet and it means to turn overthrow
[1:29:53] overturn to turn about to turn over to
[1:29:56] turn around to change to
[1:29:59] transform and here I am I am a prophet
[1:30:02] of God anointed by the Holy Spirit and I
[1:30:06] say 40 days and this city will be
[1:30:10] overthrown over what is the word again
[1:30:13] yes it will be
[1:30:16] kaak overthrown turned over I thought
[1:30:21] differently but it doesn't change the
[1:30:23] fact that I'm a prophet and I did
[1:30:25] prophesy and that city was overturned
[1:30:29] yes it turned from
[1:30:32] sin turned over to
[1:30:36] righteousness and then God had mercy
[1:30:40] upon that City and how many times just
[1:30:44] us brothers and sisters how many
[1:30:46] times have we thought of prophecies that
[1:30:50] were going to happen how many times have
[1:30:53] we thought that this world's going to
[1:30:54] burn according to
[1:30:56] Malachi how many times have we thought
[1:31:00] the prophet William brandom tells us
[1:31:02] that Los Angeles is going to
[1:31:06] sink how many times have we seen these
[1:31:08] things and do we want them to happen are
[1:31:12] we being a
[1:31:13] Jonah they're going to happen because
[1:31:16] they're prophets of God speaking these
[1:31:19] things but we should be crying
[1:31:21] out to the people that are there yes and
[1:31:26] asking for mercy and asking them to turn
[1:31:29] their ways as Jonah did and then maybe
[1:31:33] we can turn
[1:31:34] Souls maybe we can turn someone that
[1:31:38] is the worst of the worst and turn them
[1:31:42] into the best of the
[1:31:43] best as Jonah
[1:31:46] did Jonah's out there prophesying
[1:31:50] Nineveh didn't think anything was going
[1:31:52] to happen he thought they were going to
[1:31:53] be
[1:31:54] destroyed he leaves and God has Mercy
[1:31:58] because they
[1:32:00] repented and he goes down and he sits
[1:32:02] under the
[1:32:04] tree
[1:32:05] loved the
[1:32:07] plant more than he loved the
[1:32:11] people and that's the story of
[1:32:14] Jonah and that's the lesson behind this
[1:32:18] wonderful book this
[1:32:20] wonderful short four chapter
[1:32:24] lesson on Jonah we wonder why it's in
[1:32:26] there it's a wonderful story but it's
[1:32:28] not just to tell a story it's a powerful
[1:32:30] story a Supernatural story he was in the
[1:32:32] belly of the whale then Jesus's brother
[1:32:33] Lyall Rabbi Lyall Rabbi Johnson here as
[1:32:37] he said Jesus himself said as Jonah was
[1:32:40] in the belly of the whale for three days
[1:32:42] and three nights so must the son of man
[1:32:44] be in the
[1:32:45] grave for that
[1:32:47] long Jonah is a very
[1:32:50] important prophetic book but it's also a
[1:32:54] good
[1:32:55] lesson judge not that you be not
[1:32:59] judged cry out to the sins of the world
[1:33:03] and then maybe they will repent I love
[1:33:08] what that King said what that King said
[1:33:10] was so beautiful he said you
[1:33:13] know maybe we don't
[1:33:16] know but possibly God would have mercy
[1:33:19] on us and he did and there was Rabbi
[1:33:21] Johnson was a 40 years later that
[1:33:24] Nineveh was finally destroyed it was 40
[1:33:26] years later that they destroyed Israel
[1:33:29] oh that Nineveh came back and destroyed
[1:33:31] Israel yes and then in Nineveh was
[1:33:33] eventually destroyed another hundred
[1:33:34] years
