[2:07] James chapter 5 verse
[2:12] 14 it says
[2:17] this so is there any is there any sick
[2:19] among
[2:20] you let him call for the Elders of the
[2:23] church and let them pray over him
[2:26] anointing him with oil in the name of
[2:27] the
[2:28] Lord and the prayer faith shall save the

[7:48] come to service brother Teddy is the one
[7:50] he's a he's a good he's he's actually
[7:53] he's a friend of mine um he's the one
[7:55] that uh we sent out a prayer request um
[7:58] that he was stabbed in front of the
[8:00] church and I was talking with him this
[8:02] morning he he um composed this rap
[8:06] song about about the Lord Jesus and and
[8:09] you know he he did it for me this
[8:11] morning and and uh said brother thank
[8:14] you thank you but he loves the Lord and
[8:18] uh he um he was actually he felt like he
[8:21] was defending our our dear brother Arie
[8:24] Peterson um brother Arie is just so he's
[8:27] so sweet he's so humble but he said that
[8:30] there some of the folks were talking
[8:33] back to him and insulting him and and he
[8:36] he didn't appreciate it and let me tell
[8:38] you he was fighting for the right
[8:40] side so God God bless him he might he
[8:43] might come in here in a little bit he
[8:44] comes in um fairly
[8:46] often I appreciated and and any other
[8:50] visitors if I've missed you I see that
[8:53] we were missing some that uh maybe maybe
[8:56] U they got sick I know that wow when I
[8:58] got up to camp last week it just
[9:00] descended on me like a ton of bricks and
[9:03] and uh feel like I'm over it now but I'm
[9:07] uh still kind of weak from from this
[9:10] past so there's there's probably some
[9:12] missing today let's always remember each
[9:15] other in prayer I was I was
[9:21] uh when we first got there um the
[9:25] evening we had on the schedule to go out
[9:28] and have quiet time
[9:30] quiet time as we started doing that at
[9:31] stillwaters camp but I've done it my
[9:33] I've really done it my whole life and um
[9:36] it's something that is probably the most
[9:38] important thing in my life is that time
[9:42] to get just get quiet before the Lord
[9:45] and I want to encourage the congregation
[9:48] to do that so and it is on the camp
[9:50] schedule to have this quiet time so we
[9:53] went out and I was was scheduled to be I
[9:56] think 5:00 and and I sat down in my
[9:58] chair and I saw
[10:00] all of you all many of you going out to
[10:02] your
[10:03] place and I looked at the people going
[10:06] out and finding their tree that they
[10:08] were going to sit under or um place that
[10:11] they were going to sit and I I thought
[10:15] Lord
[10:16] what this is this is a big deal the
[10:20] these are
[10:21] souls these are your
[10:23] children and I thought there's nothing
[10:27] greater that I could do
[10:30] than to encourage each of you to get
[10:32] quiet before the Lord read your Bible to
[10:36] to pray to hear his
[10:38] voice
[10:40] and it's so easy in the world today it's
[10:45] so easy with with all all of our wasted
[10:48] time and all the distractions that we
[10:50] have it's so easy to fall out of love
[10:53] with
[10:55] Jesus but if you get into this book
[10:58] brothers and sister if you just dig into
[11:01] this this precious book right here and
[11:04] you start reading this it is so easy to
[11:07] fall out of love with the world and fall
[11:09] back in love with the Lord Jesus it is
[11:13] it is there is nothing greater that we
[11:16] can do than to just sit down and read
[11:23] these wonderful wonderful
[11:26] words that are the words of Life the The
[11:29] Book of John starts it says in the
[11:32] beginning was the word and the Word was
[11:36] with God and the Word was
[11:40] God this
[11:42] word is God and then that same word came
[11:48] down and made was made flesh and dwelt
[11:51] among
[11:52] us if you don't get anything from this
[11:56] service
[11:57] today I challenge you to take your time
[12:03] and dig into this book every single day
[12:08] you you young people you have tests and
[12:10] you study for that test you go to the
[12:13] textbook you open it up and you read
[12:16] about what's going to be on the test we
[12:18] have a test every day and if we are not
[12:22] reading this test textbook and
[12:25] constantly in it brothers and sisters we
[12:27] are going to fail the test
[12:29] so stay in this
[12:32] book take an hour a
[12:35] day an hour yeah we can spare an hour of
[12:38] our precious
[12:39] time to dig into this Bible and read it
[12:43] and absorb it and if you don't
[12:45] understand what you're
[12:48] reading get another
[12:51] translation we have people brother you
[12:53] speak
[12:54] French you have a French Bible it was
[12:56] translated Louis agon is that the Bible
[13:00] that you
[13:02] use it's translated from the same
[13:06] original texts as our Bible is but it's
[13:11] different but it says the same thing if
[13:14] you can't understand this Bible don't
[13:18] put yourself punish yourself and and try
[13:20] to make yourself understand something
[13:22] you can't get another translation get
[13:24] another good translation and read that
[13:27] there's nothing in the message me or in
[13:29] the word or anything that says you
[13:31] can't I was telling uh told marily my
[13:34] mother-in-law
[13:35] before she wonders how I know my Bible
[13:39] so well and it wasn't because I went to
[13:43] Bible
[13:44] school I read these little kids Bibles
[13:48] to my
[13:50] kids and I learned story after Story
[13:53] every single
[13:55] day we'd spend at least 30 minutes
[13:58] usually an hour hour reading our little
[14:01] kids' Bibles and teaching my children
[14:04] about those things and I there's certain
[14:07] things I might not agree with in there I
[14:09] just leave that part
[14:10] out but it helped me to understand and
[14:15] brothers and sisters I've I've fallen in
[14:18] love with this book at a very very young
[14:22] age and I love it more now than I have
[14:27] ever loved
[14:30] it's everything to me please take time
[14:35] get into it and if you're reading down
[14:38] it doesn't matter how long you take if
[14:40] you're reading down in something doesn't
[14:42] make sense stop write there don't go on
[14:47] to the next verse stop right there maybe
[14:51] look at another translation or look in
[14:53] the context and maybe even pray about it
[14:56] Lord I don't understand this and the
[14:58] Lord will give you the understanding but
[15:01] don't just read over it just to get done
[15:05] this book is meant to be
[15:07] understood excuse me not just meant to
[15:09] be
[15:10] read as I said it's it really is this is
[15:14] the word this is God speaking to his
[15:17] people God speaking to us and if we are
[15:20] going to say that we're Christians if we
[15:22] are going to say that we're Believers if
[15:24] we're going to say these things then we
[15:26] need to dig into this word and put our
[15:30] efforts into it and not just sit back
[15:34] and say well I'm I'm good everything's
[15:37] fine and not having gone through the
[15:40] efforts of studying
[15:42] it as I said you kids in school you
[15:47] study for a
[15:49] test all of us everyone in this room
[15:51] without
[15:52] exception every single person there's
[15:55] tests every day this is your text book
[16:00] this is how you pass the test get to
[16:02] know this
[16:04] book I can't over I can't
[16:07] overstated I was a friend of mine he's a
[16:11] pastor in South Africa he sent me uh a
[16:16] video that I I listen to
[16:19] it and then I listen to it again and I
[16:23] thought you know this is this is really
[16:25] really good and it's a what's called a
[16:28] Christian apologist just he's a he's a
[16:30] theologian and he's just the brothers
[16:32] got a really nice spirit and I thought
[16:35] you know this this old man really put
[16:37] things in
[16:38] perspective and I thought this would be
[16:42] good to share with the congregation it's
[16:45] about five minutes long so brother
[16:47] Jordan if you could put it up there and
[16:49] we'll listen to it we'll watch it Dr
[16:52] Lennox has been foremost known for his
[16:54] work in the field of apologetics and
[16:56] debates against famous atheists like
[16:58] late Christopher Hitchens Richard
[17:00] Dawkins and others he is undoubtedly one
[17:02] of the most well-loved Christian
[17:04] apologists of our time in the year 2019
[17:07] Dr lnox was asked on what would be his
[17:09] final words of wisdom to his children
[17:11] not only to my children but anybody our
[17:14] lives Rush past we've become fixated on
[17:18] digital equipment that's robbing us of
[17:20] time people say to me they've no time
[17:23] they've loads of time if you want to
[17:25] know how much time you've got just ask
[17:27] yourself a simple question how how much
[17:29] time have I spent in the last week
[17:31] fiddling with a piece of digital
[17:33] equipment and doing things that of no
[17:35] relevance whatsoever to my profession or
[17:37] my life and then say have I got any time
[17:40] we're robbing ourselves of the most
[17:42] important thing in life if we're
[17:44] Christians and that is seeking
[17:47] fellowship with God through his word you
[17:50] will never make any impact on This World
[17:52] by reading the Bible for 5 minutes
[17:55] before you jump into bed and I'm
[17:57] brutally practical you you husbands will
[17:59] never make any impact on the world if
[18:01] you're not praying with your wives and
[18:04] leading your families spiritually you
[18:07] just won't it's not possible to develop
[18:10] a deep relationship within a family that
[18:13] is not triangular that is it doesn't
[18:15] include Jesus Christ at one corner and
[18:18] we can seek to repent of these things
[18:20] and really begin to make time so that in
[18:24] that sense we get to know God I used to
[18:28] think that sence and all of these
[18:29] arguments were much more interesting
[18:31] than the Bible and I discussed it with
[18:33] my mentor David Gooding and he said
[18:36] would you like to do a Bible study and
[18:37] he invited me to do one one night
[18:39] transformed my life completely in
[18:42] Cambridge where I for the very first
[18:45] time I met a person that took scripture
[18:47] seriously and he entered a dialogue with
[18:51] Matthew and it was just mindblowing how
[18:55] he began to open the treasures of
[18:57] scripture but it takes input and work
[18:59] many of you people are professional
[19:01] think of the work you had to do to get
[19:04] to where you are now if God has giving
[19:06] you that kind of mind how much of it are
[19:09] you using on him and what worries me
[19:11] silly is people who rise in their
[19:14] professional career like that but their
[19:16] knowledge of scripture remains on a
[19:18] basic baby Sunday school level so the
[19:20] moment their peers raise any questions
[19:23] they instantly detect they've not
[19:25] thought it through and that silences
[19:27] them often forever forever sadly so it's
[19:30] it's a Clarion call and I think it is a
[19:33] way of pushing against this tide of
[19:36] mediocrity where we don't take God's
[19:39] word seriously so what that tells me
[19:42] when I find it in my own heart is I
[19:44] don't really love God all this talk
[19:46] about going to heaven and going to meet
[19:48] with Christ if that happened to you now
[19:50] what would you say to him what would you
[19:52] talk about it is very serious stuff CS
[19:55] Lewis says all the leaves of the New
[19:57] Testament russle with expectation of
[19:59] Eternity and have we've never sensed
[20:01] that the word of God is given to us to
[20:04] make Eternal things real and we need to
[20:06] spend time immersed in it perfectly
[20:09] reading it with other people and alone I
[20:12] had a very close friend at Cambridge
[20:13] years ago we agreed that whoever died
[20:16] first the other remaining person would
[20:19] preach at the funeral he thought I would
[20:21] die first because I was quite a bit
[20:24] older but I never forget the day when he
[20:27] called me and with tears in his eyes he
[20:28] said I got a tumor as big as a
[20:30] grapefruit in here and that's going to
[20:33] be it you'll have to take my funeral I
[20:37] said to him what shall I say without
[20:40] hesitation he said this he said tell
[20:42] them to do what we did as students in
[20:44] Cambridge to pour over the word of God
[20:47] prayerfully and wait on God until his
[20:50] face appears amen and then they will
[20:54] have something to say do you want
[20:56] something to say you Pastor teacher
[20:59] Sunday school if you want something to
[21:01] say there is no shortcut and I'll never
[21:04] forget those essentially last words to
[21:06] the world and I've repeated them many
[21:09] times that was what transformed me it
[21:12] wasn't reading all the philosophy in the
[21:13] world although I love it and find it
[21:15] interesting and it's a way of Building
[21:17] Bridges and dealing with difficulties
[21:18] but in the end unless God is real
[21:21] through his word we're we're missing the
[21:23] central Fellowship that he offers us so
[21:26] thank you very much and God bless you
[21:28] all Dr Lennox underscores the importance
[21:30] of pouring our time in the scriptures
[21:32] prayerfully studying and understanding
[21:35] them in order to become an effective
[21:36] witness for Christ in our own domain of
[21:38] vocation only when we take the word of
[21:40] God seriously can we have something to
[21:42] say to the world thanks for watching God
[21:44] bless you is that not the
[21:47] truth just a simple understanding get
[21:51] into the word amen we waste so much time
[21:55] that's true brothers and sisters and
[21:56] this time one thing that all of us
[21:59] have is time we may not have money we
[22:04] may have money we may have uh this or
[22:08] that but and not have this or that but
[22:11] one thing we all have is we all have
[22:14] time remember brother Israel PO said one
[22:16] time I really appreciated it he said why
[22:19] don't we tithe 10% of our
[22:23] time I thought that's a good thing to
[22:26] think about we tithe 10% of our
[22:29] money let me ask you what would God want
[22:33] more from you on your time or your
[22:38] money with my son my
[22:41] daughter what would I want more from
[22:45] them I would want their
[22:47] time I would want their love so often we
[22:51] have we have too much to do we're too
[22:53] busy and we say Lord I'll get to you
[22:56] when I have time just not right now
[23:00] and the humility of God and the
[23:02] sweetness of God he backs off and he
[23:06] takes whatever we give him that's every
[23:09] one of
[23:10] us why can't we give him more he got he
[23:14] gave us a little
[23:17] bit on he gave us something that that
[23:21] gave us eternal
[23:23] life he gave his life on the cross his
[23:27] blood Spilled Out on the ground for me
[23:31] can't I give him a little bit more time
[23:33] can't I give him a little bit more of my
[23:37] love and can't I spend more time in this
[23:42] textbook understanding God more when we
[23:46] look into this book we are looking into
[23:48] the face of God this is him from the
[23:52] beginning to the end if you want to know
[23:55] God know this book there's a when I
[24:00] watched that
[24:02] um I fell into the trap a little bit and
[24:05] uh I started watching a couple other
[24:08] videos which I believe it was it was the
[24:10] Lord and I got to this man his name is
[24:13] Jeff Durban he I think he's he's got a
[24:16] church up in Phoenix and uh he runs the
[24:19] organization called apologia Studios and
[24:23] his main efforts are to he his Outreach
[24:26] to the local Mormons I believe in Mesa
[24:29] Arizona and also as an anti-abortion
[24:33] activist and the
[24:35] brother he gets into these discussions
[24:38] and I have never
[24:40] seen um a gift like him where he can
[24:44] just quote scripture after scripture
[24:47] after scripture and scriptures that are
[24:50] very um present that are very that that
[24:54] are for the conversation so he was so I
[24:57] I got step and um and we were watching
[24:59] this one video of him and he's talking
[25:01] to these this sweet old Mormon
[25:04] couple and uh they were on the street
[25:06] right outside the Mormon Temple and and
[25:09] he starts up this conversation and and I
[25:11] don't really um I I appreciate his gift
[25:14] and and I appreciate what he's doing I
[25:16] don't really agree with him because he
[25:17] seems like he's just against everything
[25:20] rather than really for something but
[25:22] it's just his gift it's his calling and
[25:24] what he does and and he he Stokes up an
[25:26] argument so what he did is there's these
[25:29] um two Mormon two sweet Mormon couple
[25:32] and they're walking by and he starts in
[25:34] this
[25:35] conversation and he starts saying that
[25:38] that here this Bible verse shows that
[25:41] the Mormon um ideology is wrong it's
[25:45] directly against what the Bible says
[25:47] that I am I am God and I change not one
[25:50] of their tant is God changes and then I
[25:52] am and then I am God I'm one and they
[25:55] say no there's many gods there's Gods
[25:57] all over this is just our God and and
[25:59] then he quotes he says I am God there
[26:02] was none before me and there will be
[26:03] none after me and showing that the
[26:06] Mormon religion is completely wrong in
[26:09] the foundation and and the the Mormon
[26:12] guy kept saying he kept saying well no
[26:14] that's just how how you believe we don't
[26:16] believe that and he says here it is it's
[26:19] the word and he says well how do you
[26:20] know the word's translated right and he
[26:22] says it is and he showed that it that it
[26:25] was and and the the whole convers ation
[26:29] this this Mormon man his his whole
[26:32] Foundation was well God revealed it to
[26:36] me that this is
[26:38] true God revealed it to me that this is
[26:42] true no matter what this
[26:46] says I've had an experience with
[26:49] God so God revealed to me that this
[26:52] religion is right that everything is
[26:54] true in this but it if it doesn't match
[26:57] this brothers and sisters
[26:58] our experience is
[27:02] false no matter how real it
[27:05] seems they kept on and on and going back
[27:08] and
[27:09] forth and then the Mormon man
[27:13] says he says well he says you and I he
[27:15] says we can quote scriptures all
[27:18] day and it's not going to do any good
[27:20] and he said
[27:22] this he said you haven't quoted one
[27:25] scripture to
[27:26] me and and I thought that's right
[27:32] amen the one brother went back to the
[27:36] Bible said this is our
[27:40] absolute this is what's
[27:42] real and this over here I don't care
[27:45] about your
[27:46] experience it has to match this word
[27:51] we've learned that you've listen to it
[27:52] hopefully enough tapes that you can
[27:54] understand that this is the absolute
[27:57] right here and if doesn't match this
[27:59] word then it is not right no matter what
[28:03] your experience is no matter how
[28:05] powerful it was no matter how you came
[28:07] to the Altar and and some miracle that's
[28:09] not it this is the this is the final
[28:13] this is the
[28:15] absolute and when you're faced with a
[28:17] scripture that contradicts how you
[28:20] believe or quote with how you believe or
[28:23] whatever and you respond if you're faced
[28:25] with a scripture that that contradicts
[28:27] how you you believe and you respond that
[28:29] you just don't understand that
[28:32] scripture what you're really saying is
[28:35] that you don't believe that
[28:38] scripture because it doesn't line up
[28:40] with your religion and how many in our
[28:44] circles are guilty of doing that well I
[28:48] just I just don't understand that part
[28:50] no you're saying you don't believe
[28:52] it it doesn't match your religion
[28:55] therefore as the Mormon man my religion
[28:58] is more important than this
[29:00] book
[29:02] no this book is more important than my
[29:06] religion and there's some things that
[29:08] this book is very
[29:09] plain most many things as I said this is
[29:13] the textbook and we we we're given a
[29:15] test every day we must know this
[29:19] word in Acts chapter
[29:22] 17 Paul and
[29:25] Silas brothers that's that's why we're
[29:27] doing our WI Wednesday night bible
[29:29] studies that's why we've gone through
[29:31] the book of Acts that's why we're doing
[29:33] this is I want us to understand I want
[29:37] you to be able to go into the book of
[29:38] Hosea like brother Lyle preached on
[29:41] Wednesday
[29:42] night and I know what it's about
[29:46] now there was a there was a quote in
[29:50] there that said that God will tear us
[29:53] down so he can build us back up and
[29:57] sometimes brother Ed that's how it
[29:58] happens he'll tear us down and we'll get
[30:01] so low and then when he builds us back
[30:04] up we are built up
[30:06] stronger that mortar is set those bricks
[30:09] are even everything is good and before
[30:11] there's cracks in the foundation of
[30:13] everything and we get built up now I've
[30:15] been through it I am a stronger man now
[30:18] than I was then but I had to go through
[30:20] those trials
[30:22] first Paul and Silas were they were out
[30:25] and they were preaching the gospel
[30:28] Paul we know he had to get torn down
[30:32] ripped apart and the religion taken out
[30:35] of him so that God could rebuild that
[30:38] they're out preaching and they're on the
[30:41] road in Acts chapter
[30:43] 17 let's read this blessed
[30:54] word
[30:55] now when they had passed through a
[31:00] amphipolis in abalonia they came to
[31:03] thessalonica where was a synagogue of
[31:05] the Jews and Paul as his manner was went
[31:09] in unto them and three Sabbath days
[31:11] reason with them out of the
[31:14] scriptures stop there for a moment Paul
[31:16] reasoned with the Jews on the scriptures
[31:20] do you think Paul just suddenly had
[31:21] knowledge of the
[31:24] scriptures no he spent hours and days
[31:27] and years years studying the book that's
[31:31] how he could reason that's how he could
[31:33] present it is because he had spent the
[31:37] time he was highly educated he was under
[31:39] one of the greatest professors the
[31:41] Jewish professors that had ever lived on
[31:43] the law of Moses and the prophets G
[31:48] gel and second after after he had had
[31:52] his experience he went into another
[31:55] country for 3 years to study the Bible
[31:59] to make sure that his experience matched
[32:03] this book no matter how powerful Paul's
[32:06] experience was knocked down off his
[32:09] horse smoke blind the Lord Jesus talks
[32:12] to him he comes in gets healed gets
[32:16] baptized still Lord I want to make
[32:20] sure that my Revelation that my
[32:24] experience matches this book spent three
[32:26] years The Scholar that Paul was spent
[32:30] three years studying the book to make
[32:32] sure that his experience no matter how
[32:34] powerful it was matched the
[32:41] Bible read verse one again now when they
[32:44] had passed through amphipolis and
[32:46] abalonia they came to thessalonica where
[32:48] there was a synagogue of the Jews and
[32:50] Paul is his manner was went in unto them
[32:53] and three Sabbath days reason with them
[32:55] out of the scriptures open opening and
[32:58] alleging that Christ must needs have
[33:00] suffered and risen again from the dead
[33:04] and that this Jesus whom I preach unto
[33:06] you is
[33:07] Christ and some of them
[33:10] believed and consorted with Paul and
[33:12] Silas and of devout Greeks and a great
[33:15] multitude and of the chief women not a
[33:18] few it shows that the sisters need to
[33:19] read their Bibles too it's not just your
[33:23] husband we are equal in this sisters you
[33:27] got to read it
[33:30] but the Jews which believe not moved
[33:33] with envy and took unto them a certain
[33:35] LW fellow certain lwd fellows of the
[33:37] baser sort and gathered a company and
[33:40] set all the city on an uproar and
[33:43] assaulted the house of Jason and sought
[33:45] to bring them out to the people and when
[33:48] they found them not they drew Jason and
[33:50] a certain
[33:52] Brethren unto the rulers of the city
[33:54] crying that these have turned the world
[33:56] upside down and are come hither
[34:00] also people are so often offended at the
[34:04] truth because it doesn't match their way
[34:06] of thinking book of Acts is full of this
[34:09] story right here and they think that and
[34:13] then they are they're just as zealous in
[34:15] their beliefs as we are they are just as
[34:18] firm in what they think as we are and
[34:21] they're zealous enough these ones are to
[34:24] want to kill these men they hated Paul
[34:27] and
[34:28] Sil because they disagreed and and
[34:32] quoted scriptures that did not match
[34:35] what they
[34:37] thought whom Jason hath received and all
[34:39] these do contrary to the decrees of
[34:41] Caesar saying that there is another king
[34:43] one
[34:44] Jesus and they troubled the people and
[34:46] the rulers of the city and when they
[34:48] heard these
[34:49] things and when they had taken taken
[34:52] security of Jason and of the other one
[34:54] they let them go and the Brethren
[34:57] immediately sent Paul and Silas By Night
[35:00] unto
[35:02] Berea Who coming tother went into the
[35:05] synagogue of the Jews I love that look
[35:07] at the boldness of Paul and Silas they
[35:09] just about got killed over here they let
[35:12] him out by night they go right back to
[35:14] another city and start doing the same
[35:16] thing these brothers were filled with
[35:19] the Holy Spirit and these brothers were
[35:20] firm in what they believed they had had
[35:22] an experience and they could back it up
[35:24] with the scriptures
[35:29] the bereans these were more
[35:32] noble than those in
[35:35] thessalonica in that they received the
[35:37] word with all Readiness of mind they
[35:40] didn't just cut it off and say this
[35:42] doesn't match my religion I don't want
[35:44] to hear it like the Mormon did in the
[35:47] video they received it with ready
[35:50] Readiness of mind and they searched the
[35:53] Scriptures
[35:55] Daily whether these things were were
[35:59] so they were
[36:01] secure they were confident in the
[36:04] scriptures and their understanding of
[36:06] the scriptures they were so confident
[36:08] that they could go right into the Bible
[36:11] and not be afraid that they were going
[36:12] to be wrong but seeking what was right
[36:15] and they received this word with
[36:17] Readiness of mind and they searched
[36:18] those scriptures every day to see if
[36:21] these things that the Apostle Paul was
[36:22] saying is true they weren't searching
[36:25] the scriptures to prove Paul and Silas
[36:26] wrong
[36:28] and they weren't searching the
[36:29] scriptures to prove Paul and saw this
[36:31] right how many of
[36:33] us always look at myself when we have a
[36:38] conversation how many of us if somebody
[36:41] presents something to us how many of us
[36:43] immediately are trying to think of
[36:45] scriptures to prove them
[36:47] wrong or if somebody in our church and
[36:51] we're talking to each other how many of
[36:53] us are trying to find scriptures to
[36:55] prove them right
[36:57] but instead we should be back like these
[37:00] bereans were and say Lord what is right
[37:05] let me dig into your word let me dig
[37:10] into this and let me see is this that
[37:12] I'm hearing is it right or is it
[37:18] wrong they probably had an idea in their
[37:21] mind what the Messiah would be probably
[37:24] a great king great General but when Paul
[37:27] and M brought them the Bible and showed
[37:29] them the prophecies maybe prophecies out
[37:31] of Isaiah a virgin s conceive or in
[37:34] Genesis or even less known scriptures
[37:37] like in Hosea out of Egypt I've called
[37:39] my son and say this pertains to this man
[37:41] or or Micah that he would be born in
[37:43] Bethlehem and he
[37:45] was we don't know exactly we know that
[37:48] they they brought these things out
[37:49] through the
[37:51] scriptures and these bereans took what
[37:54] they said and they brought it to task in
[37:56] the Bible and they studied it and
[37:59] basically they fact checked them we
[38:02] thought we see fact check oh you're not
[38:04] supposed to fact check during a debate
[38:06] well they waited and they fact checked
[38:10] with the
[38:12] Bible now we know
[38:15] Paul we know that after his experience
[38:19] he didn't agree with the conventional
[38:22] way of thinking he didn't he he the the
[38:25] conventional legalism of the Jews and to
[38:27] the point
[38:30] that he didn't he said that there is a
[38:34] point in all this there is a meaning in
[38:35] all that you're doing and this meaning
[38:38] everything comes back to
[38:40] Christ
[38:42] and these
[38:44] bereans they didn't have a a judgmental
[38:47] attitude either they were just trying
[38:49] they they weren't trying to defend their
[38:50] rhetoric in church they approach the
[38:52] word with a Readiness of M and they
[38:53] search the Scriptures Daily as I said
[38:56] and and they they listen listen to these
[38:58] things that Paul and Silas said they
[38:59] took them in and they maybe even Paul
[39:02] quoted that Jesus said to the the
[39:06] priests of the day he said that you
[39:09] search the scriptures because you think
[39:11] that in them you have eternal life and
[39:14] they are they that bear witness to
[39:17] me he's saying that the scriptures if
[39:19] you would truly know them that's what
[39:21] bears witness to
[39:24] Christ and now twice in the same chapter
[39:27] it wasn't just the brothers the sisters
[39:30] were part of this also therefore many of
[39:32] them believed also of The Honorable
[39:35] women which were Greeks and of men not a
[39:40] few so why did the bereans
[39:43] believe and where did pil Paul and
[39:47] Silas why were they so able to preach
[39:49] the gospel you go back to the video that
[39:52] we just saw and what this man was saying
[39:54] they spent the time they studied they
[39:56] they they they prayed and they didn't
[39:59] waste time on the things of the world
[40:02] they had everything ready let's turn to
[40:05] Ephesians chapter
[40:07] 5 verse 6 it says this the same Apostle
[40:11] speaking here the Apostle Paul let no
[40:14] man deceive you with vain words for
[40:16] because of these things cometh the wrath
[40:18] of God upon the children of Disobedience
[40:20] be not ye therefore partakers with them
[40:24] for ye were sometimes Darkness but now
[40:27] ye are light in the Lord walk as
[40:31] children of
[40:33] light imagine how a son or daughter
[40:35] walks through this world do you think
[40:40] that these CH these children of light
[40:42] are spending their time on unproductive
[40:45] things gossip continually posting on
[40:49] social media constantly keeping your
[40:50] mind occupied on something other than
[40:52] the
[40:53] word remember the brother saying at the
[40:56] beginning
[40:58] he said count how much time you spend on
[41:00] a device going through meaningless
[41:01] things and then count how much time you
[41:04] spend on the word all of us let's do
[41:08] that think about how much time we spend
[41:10] in meaningless things and how much time
[41:12] we spend on on the words of eternal
[41:16] life so walk as children of the light
[41:19] and how do we do that for the fruit of
[41:20] the spirit is in all goodness and
[41:22] righteousness and Truth proving what is
[41:24] acceptable unto the Lord how can you
[41:28] prove what is
[41:31] acceptable it's a simple statement how
[41:34] do you
[41:35] prove the same verse the NIV says this
[41:39] and find out what pleases God it's
[41:42] another translation that same thing you
[41:44] must be studying the word and that is
[41:47] how you prove right from wrong and good
[41:50] Doctrine from Bad
[41:52] Doctrine it's not holding the party line
[41:55] or repeating a religious rhetoric
[41:57] that doesn't work that's been going on
[42:00] throughout history and it's been it goes
[42:02] on today and it doesn't work it is
[42:04] through studying the word about and
[42:06] praying about these things that you
[42:08] don't understand and that's how you find
[42:11] out what is acceptable to
[42:14] God Hosea
[42:16] 46 I think it's Hosea it says my people
[42:20] perish through lack of
[42:26] knowledge let's go back to
[42:29] um
[42:33] 511 and we and have no fellowship with
[42:35] the unfruitful works of darkness but
[42:37] rather reprove them for it is a shame
[42:39] even to speak of those things which are
[42:40] done of them in secret but all things
[42:43] that are are reproved are made manifest
[42:46] by the light for whatsoever doth make
[42:49] manifest is light wherefore he saith
[42:53] awake thou that sleepest and arise from
[42:56] the dead and Christ shall give thee
[42:59] light see then that you walk
[43:03] circumspectly not as fools but as
[43:07] wise and here's my subject in the title
[43:09] and I'm I'm just now getting to the
[43:11] title Redeeming the
[43:13] time because the days are
[43:15] evil saying making the make the most of
[43:18] your time is putting the Lord's first
[43:20] praying and reading your Bible first
[43:21] thing in the in the morning then being
[43:23] productive during the day we might have
[43:26] it on our Minds that the only way to
[43:28] serve God is to constantly read my Bible
[43:30] all the time and pray no we have to go
[43:32] through this life but whatever we're
[43:34] doing do it right put your heart into it
[43:38] if you're going to work do a good job at
[43:42] work if you're studying study if you're
[43:45] if you're in school study and do well on
[43:47] your
[43:48] tests everything should be the best that
[43:53] you do I believe brother brandom said
[43:55] that if you're going to be a bum
[43:58] don't work a day in your
[44:00] life be the best that you
[44:03] can I don't recommend
[44:08] that but he's he's he's proving a
[44:12] point dick Tomy was a football coach
[44:15] from the University of Arizona um in the
[44:17] in the 90s and he used to tell his team
[44:20] my brother would U my brother was on the
[44:22] team and and he would tell me
[44:26] that coach Tomy would always tell his
[44:28] his people his players wherever you are
[44:32] be
[44:33] there if you're at football practice
[44:36] give it 100% if you're in school give it
[44:38] 100% I'm going to add this if you're at
[44:40] church be there don't be thinking about
[44:42] something else don't be thinking about
[44:44] getting out and where you going to go to
[44:46] lunch and all this or how long brother
[44:48] Dan's going to be up there today you
[44:49] know it's always the
[44:54] same but be here
[44:57] and listen to what I'm saying and then
[44:59] as I'm saying it you're taking it in and
[45:02] then you are checking it with your
[45:05] knowledge of the scriptures and you need
[45:06] to have knowledge of the
[45:09] scriptures you need to be able to go
[45:11] back like the
[45:13] bereans and say is this right is what
[45:17] the brother was saying in church whether
[45:18] it be me or visiting minister or
[45:20] something that you hear is this
[45:22] according to this
[45:24] word wherefore be ye not not
[45:28] unwise but understanding what the will
[45:30] of the Lord is how do you understand he
[45:33] repeats himself how do you understand
[45:35] what the will of the Lord
[45:37] is the way almost everyone does it they
[45:41] learn nowadays they just learn from
[45:43] their
[45:44] parents and the parents learn from the
[45:47] parents'
[45:48] parents and then when you want to come
[45:50] to the Lord that's the place that you go
[45:53] you could grow up Catholic it's like
[45:54] okay I got to start getting right so I
[45:56] got to go to the Catholic Church I got
[45:57] to talk to the priest if you grow up
[46:00] among our circles then you do it a
[46:02] certain way but the right
[46:06] way is to get into is Lord seek seek God
[46:11] and and this right
[46:14] here has sanctioned by God
[46:18] himself seek God and study his word and
[46:22] that is how you come to God that is what
[46:25] will give you a last fting a firm
[46:28] foundation on these things verse
[46:31] number 17 wherefore be ye not unwise but
[46:36] understanding what the will of the Lord
[46:42] is one thing we can receive our healing
[46:47] we can receive our Salvation we can we
[46:51] receive after we we pray and we receive
[46:55] the answer to our prayers but one thing
[46:57] brothers and sisters that you won't
[46:58] receive that requires work is your
[47:01] knowledge of the
[47:02] Scriptures it doesn't just pop into your
[47:05] mind God has an ordained path whether it
[47:10] be a prophet or whether it be any of us
[47:13] we must spend that time in the
[47:16] scriptures if we are to know the
[47:19] Scriptures it takes something from us
[47:21] salvation is an unmar gift knowledge
[47:26] comes from from study it comes from
[47:31] work I'm going to read the Amplified
[47:34] version of verses
[47:37] 15 through 17 Ephesians 5 just leave the
[47:41] King James up there therefore see that
[47:44] when you walk carefully living life with
[47:47] honor purpose and courage shunning those
[47:50] who tolerate and enable evil not as
[47:54] unwise but as wise sensible intelligent
[47:57] Discerning people making the most of
[48:00] your time on Earth recognizing and
[48:03] taking advantage of each opportunity and
[48:06] using it with wisdom and diligence
[48:08] because the days are filled with evil
[48:11] with evil therefore do not be foolish
[48:14] and thoughtless but understand and
[48:17] firmly grasp what the will of the Lord
[48:20] is now let's go back a chapter to
[48:23] Ephesians chapter
[48:25] 4 famous chapter we've all heard it
[48:27] preached
[48:29] about but be a Berean
[48:32] here dig into the scripture yourself
[48:35] start with verse
[48:38] 11 and he gave some Apostles and some
[48:41] prophets and some evangelists and some
[48:42] pastors and
[48:45] teachers so what is the purpose of me
[48:48] standing here in this congregation or
[48:50] the prophetic gift operating or a
[48:53] teacher giving an overview of the books
[48:55] of the Bible or the evangelist was
[48:56] calling Sinners to the altar what is the
[48:59] purpose and all there has to be a
[49:00] purpose it's not just we throw it out
[49:02] there oh I believe in fivefold Ministry
[49:04] well what does it mean what does it
[49:06] matter it says it actually answers like
[49:09] the Bible always does you just got to
[49:11] read
[49:12] it he gave some Apostles and some
[49:16] prophets and some evangelists and and
[49:18] some pastors and teachers for the
[49:20] perfecting of the Saints for the work of
[49:24] the ministry for the edifying of the
[49:26] body of Christ not one of the offices in
[49:29] Ephesians 4:11 perfects the Saints only
[49:33] the blood of Jesus Christ can
[49:36] perfect that's all that can perfect a
[49:38] human being is the blood of Jesus Christ
[49:40] but these are for the perfecting of the
[49:43] Saints the modern the every modern
[49:46] translation pretty much says for the
[49:49] equipping of the Saints you know what
[49:51] I'll read it just so you you uh believe
[49:53] me I know you believe me anyways but let
[49:55] me Ephesians
[49:58] 411 it says
[50:01] this sorry
[50:04] 4:12 NIV says to equip his people for
[50:07] the works of the Ser of service so that
[50:10] the body of Christ may be built up the
[50:11] English Standard Version to equip the
[50:14] Saints of the work for the work of the
[50:17] ministry for the building up of the body
[50:20] of Christ New Living Translation their
[50:22] responsibility is to equip God's people
[50:25] and to do his work and build up the
[50:27] church the body of Christ the new King
[50:29] James for the equipping of the Saints
[50:32] for the work of the ministry for the
[50:33] edifying of the body of Christ so this
[50:37] ministry is to equip us all it's not
[50:40] just for a pastor to be standing here
[50:42] trying to preach to his people it's so
[50:44] that all of us are able to be in this
[50:46] ministry in this body collectively
[50:48] working to further God's Ministry till
[50:52] until so it has to come to an end point
[50:55] what is the ultimate goal
[50:57] till we all come in the unity of the
[50:59] faith and of the knowledge of the Son of
[51:02] God that's very
[51:05] important don't forget the Son of God
[51:07] and all
[51:08] this don't forget Jesus Christ till we
[51:12] all come into the unity of the
[51:15] faith and of the knowledge of the Son of
[51:18] God unto a perfect man unto the measure
[51:21] of the stature of the fullness of Christ
[51:23] manifesting his spiritual completeness
[51:28] and exercising our spiritual gifts in
[51:34] unity the body of Christ working
[51:36] together studying the word teaching
[51:39] manifesting the word so that not that we
[51:41] can be equal with Christ but that the ma
[51:44] that we would manifest the stature of
[51:46] the fullness of
[51:49] Christ and this all has a purpose
[51:53] also why do we come to the unity of the
[51:55] faith why do we manifest the spirit of
[51:57] Christ to that perfect man that we
[51:59] henceforth listen to this that we
[52:02] henceforth be no more children toss to
[52:03] and fro and carried about with every
[52:05] wind of Doctrine by the Slate of men and
[52:07] cunning craftiness whereby they lie in
[52:11] weight to
[52:12] deceive brothers and sisters there are
[52:15] deceivers
[52:16] everywhere and we think of a deceiver
[52:19] maybe of this goodlooking slick tongue
[52:22] guy in the pull pit maybe
[52:25] that but think about the two sweet old
[52:29] Mormon
[52:31] couple think about
[52:33] them and them trying to teach others and
[52:37] bring others
[52:39] into this strange doctrine that doesn't
[52:43] line up with a book so who is the
[52:47] deceiver it's anyone it can be the
[52:51] sweetest old fell that you've ever
[52:54] met the kind old
[52:57] priest as we've heard
[52:59] before it could be anyone if they are
[53:02] trying to point you away from this book
[53:06] and this book is about one man in his
[53:09] name is Jesus Christ amen we just read
[53:16] that but speaking the truth in
[53:20] love may grow up into him in all things
[53:24] that we may grow up in every way into
[53:26] him which is the head even Christ so
[53:30] that is the purpose of the ministry it's
[53:32] not to introduce people to a message or
[53:35] to to a certain denomination or or
[53:39] somehow change the point of the Gospel
[53:41] it's to strengthen and equip the body of
[53:43] Christ for the work till we all come
[53:46] into the unity of faith and the
[53:48] knowledge of the Son of
[53:52] God say it
[53:54] again till we all all come into the
[53:58] unity in the faith and the knowledge of
[54:01] the Son of God Jesus Christ that we are
[54:06] no longer tossed to and fro like
[54:07] children with every wind of
[54:10] Doctrine we need to know brothers and
[54:13] sisters this book that we are no more
[54:15] tossed to and fro somebody comes in with
[54:18] a new revelation and it's always a
[54:20] revelation we were talking about this
[54:22] yesterday it's always a new revelation I
[54:24] have this the Lord revealed this to me
[54:26] but that's good but doesn't match this
[54:29] word no matter how great it sounds No
[54:31] matter how powerful it is no matter how
[54:34] it lifts you up or your church up does
[54:36] it match this word and does it come to
[54:40] the knowledge of
[54:42] Christ let's go back to Ephesians 5 and
[54:45] I'll close with
[54:47] this verse number
[54:50] 14 wherefore he saith awake thou that
[54:54] sleepeth and arise from the dead and
[54:56] Christ shall give thee light see then
[54:58] that you walk circumspectly not as fools
[55:01] but as wise be careful how you
[55:04] walk not as fools but in
[55:08] wisdom Redeeming the
[55:11] time because the days are
[55:16] evil don't waste our time brothers and
[55:19] sisters and the musicians can come to
[55:21] close let's not waste our
[55:24] time as I said
[55:27] I challenge
[55:29] you spend an
[55:31] hour every
[55:33] day studying this
[55:38] Bible if you can't understand it get
[55:41] another
[55:42] translation don't put yourself through
[55:44] something that God didn't intend for you
[55:46] to be
[55:48] through understand this word pray about
[55:50] this word and live this
[55:54] word and then if you hear something
[55:56] that doesn't match this word or that
[55:58] that seems wrong go back to the word and
[56:01] study
[56:03] it we have no excuses anymore I mean I I
[56:07] preach against this the
[56:09] little rectangular
[56:11] Idol I preach about it enough but it has
[56:15] also given us the
[56:17] ability to search the scriptures like
[56:20] never
[56:22] before we can use this for the good we
[56:25] can use this to understand better
[56:27] imagine if the bans had
[56:30] this they could have done it quicker
[56:35] probably but then they would have missed
[56:38] out on the blessings of reading of
[56:41] reading the Scrolls of the prophets
[56:43] and and brothers and sisters the some of
[56:46] the best times in my
[56:48] life early in the
[56:51] morning I get a cup of
[56:54] coffee and and
[56:57] sometimes I'll just open up my Bible and
[56:59] sayl where do you want me to read
[57:01] today just like I did the other day in
[57:03] in quiet time
[57:05] I I opened it up and it just happened to
[57:08] be in Hosea where brother Lyall was
[57:10] going to minister on the next the next
[57:13] service and very encouraging scriptures
[57:17] and then as I was reading and and you
[57:19] know don't get discouraged when you try
[57:22] to get be quiet before the Lord and it
[57:25] just ites doesn't seem to work your
[57:28] mind's going this way and your mind's
[57:29] going that way and that's how mine was I
[57:32] was sitting in my chair and it's I'm I'm
[57:34] here and I'm there and I'm thinking
[57:35] about this and I'm thinking about that
[57:37] and then after a
[57:40] while 30 minutes 45 minutes I started to
[57:45] settle down my mind started to calm and
[57:49] I was able to start reading the
[57:51] scriptures and and
[57:53] Hosea turned
[57:57] to First
[57:58] Corinthians and I went into there and
[58:01] and the Lord really gave me the answer
[58:04] of something that that's was on my heart
[58:07] for a long time and it's how that how
[58:12] can we have this group of people over
[58:16] here who are like those with
[58:20] James and the the the
[58:23] real um maybe old oldtimers the ones
[58:27] that that have been there for a long
[58:29] time and and really believe you have
[58:32] those and then their way of thinking and
[58:34] the way that they look and the way that
[58:36] they act and then you have over here you
[58:38] have people that are just coming
[58:41] in and they're they they are excited
[58:44] about the word and they're they're
[58:46] excited about about giving their hearts
[58:48] to the Lord and and we're having
[58:49] Miracles and we're having great great
[58:52] things over here and we we we have this
[58:53] group over here and we have this group
[58:55] over here and and and Paul is saying no
[58:58] you don't have to act the
[59:01] same you don't have to look the
[59:04] same you are
[59:07] different and I believe the Lord laid it
[59:10] on my heart don't discourage this group
[59:12] over
[59:13] here because they're
[59:15] right in their traditional ways those
[59:19] traditional ways are good those
[59:21] traditional ways are right but then also
[59:24] this group over here don't don't
[59:26] discourage them either no you don't have
[59:28] to be like this you don't have to look
[59:31] like this you don't have to act like
[59:32] this
[59:33] either I hope you've read the book of
[59:35] Galatians that's what the book's
[59:39] about and Paul in First Corinthians he
[59:41] says that over here that I can't we
[59:46] don't eat things sacrificed to
[59:48] Idols we don't we don't we don't do that
[59:51] because it'll offend this these these
[59:53] brothers over here and will cause them
[59:54] harm but over here he's saying the
[59:56] Idol's not even real it's fake there's
[1:00:00] no power to it it's just a piece of
[1:00:03] wood you're okay over
[1:00:06] here both sides are right both sides are
[1:00:12] good but don't discourage either
[1:00:15] one I'll tell you man I was I was
[1:00:18] reading that and I just felt the Holy
[1:00:20] Spirit and it came from the book it came
[1:00:23] from the Bible and here it is here it is
[1:00:26] God just coming out of this book showing
[1:00:28] me here's what I want you to do as
[1:00:30] Pastor be
[1:00:33] careful don't
[1:00:35] offend because you could cause harm
[1:00:38] you're right your understanding is right
[1:00:41] but be
[1:00:43] careful and I took it back brothers and
[1:00:46] sisters that's the thing is I took it
[1:00:47] back to the word and I just I just love
[1:00:50] it and it's it it it answers every
[1:00:53] question that you have I promise it does
[1:00:57] it's right there the answer fall in love
[1:01:00] with the Bible don't be afraid of it

[1:01:08] end just read it and I promise you you
[1:01:12] will fall in love it is so beautiful

[1:01:27] and you might look back and say wow I
[1:01:30] could have been something I could have
[1:01:32] done something but I wasted my time
[1:01:36] that's what I was telling the I don't

[1:02:03] it's for the unity of the body it's it's
[1:02:06] for the the the exalting of Jesus Christ
[1:02:09] and yet we
[1:02:10] fight and yet we argue you have this
[1:02:13] side over here and this side over here
