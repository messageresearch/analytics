Because He Lives amen would it be okay if I read the same scripture this evening as I read this morning I just can't get enough of it St John 7 verse [Music] 37 thank you in the last days that great day of feast Jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture ha said out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Water but this spake he of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because that Jesus was not yet glorified amen let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you once again for these words Lord we pray that this scripture would be manifested in us that are here tonight I ask and father may you be pleased with our service tonight as we move to towards taking the body and the blood of our savior father confess our faults to you and and ask for your forgiveness and father ask for your guidance in Jesus name amen God bless you you can be seated appreciate appreciate the word and the promises that are in the Bible appreciate our service this morning I um I can't say it enough that we've got some really talented musicians we've uh got some great leaders in the church and uh we've got the absolute best people in the church I just love you all I appreciate you all so much one of the questions that always comes to me it seems like I think it's come every time is asking should I take communion or should I not take communion and just a testimony from me is when I was I don't know I I gave my heart to the Lord as was on my 21st birthday and I started I started Living living right but I um I could always see sin in my life and I wouldn't take communion and month would go by and year years would go by and and I would always get down and pray and I'd always see that that there was always something more that I could do or something more than I could make right and what it was is it was the enemy the accuser as I say so often that was there and he was telling me that you've done this wrong and you've done that wrong and what I would fail to do is put those things under the blood of Jesus Christ and when you read these scriptures you see that if we don't partake of this communion then we have no part with Christ but if we take it unworthily then we're guilty of his blood but the Lord knows our heart and we want to serve God we want we want to be a Christian and when it's talking about that person that is guilty of the body and the blood of Christ it's not talking about that person that really has a genuine desire to serve God it's talking about that person that is living two lives and one life is outside of this Gathering here in the world and having no desire to serve God and then showing up here in the church and standing at the communion table and making it an Abomination before God that is the one that should not be taking communion but that person that has a genuine desire in their heart that repents of their sins that's the person that should be standing here and should be taking this bread and taking this wine all of us should be able to look at our lives and see that we have sin in our lives because we do the Apostle Paul I talk about a lot because he is was such a wonderful servant of God he even said I died daily and he even said that I am the chiefest of Sinners so taking this communion no we should be here if there is a desire Upon Our Hearts to serve God there will be sin in our lives and and we're human beings I'm not condoning the sin but the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from those sins so brothers and sisters if there is a desire to come and to take of this body and not just to be part of a group of people but to actually come and make your life right and and to be a part of this then yes you should be coming this communion is a wonderful thing it's it's a fellowship the the unity of the body of Christ I think it is so underestimated we look back in in Genesis 11 when the story of the Tower of Babel the the people they got together let's let's read it brother um brother Jordan if you would put on there um Genesis chapter 11 let's just start with verse one now these are sinners take that into into account these are not people that had a relationship with God and the whole earth was of one language is and of one speech and it came to pass as they journeyed from the East that they found a plane in the land of shinar and they dwelt there and they said one to another go and let us make brick and burn them thoroughly and they had brick for stone and slime they had for Mortar and they said go to let us build us a city and a tower whose top May reach into heaven and let us make us a name lest we be scattered upon the face of the whole earth notice that they're saying that we need to make something that we can stay together because they saw there was such power in unity that they could build this tower that could all go all the way up into heaven and almost reach God and they saw that they were able to do this because they had unity and the earth and the Lord came down to see the city and the tower which the children of men builded and the Lord said behold the people is one they were operating in one unit they could do anything with their unit even as Sinners and they have all one language and this they begin to do and now nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do even God was acknowledging these people were in such Unity that they could do anything that they set their mind to go to let us go down and confound their language that they may not understand one another's speech so the Lord scattered them abroad from then upon the face of the Earth of all the Earth face upon of all the Earth and they left off to build the city therefore is the name of it called Babel because the Lord did there confound the language of all the Earth and from then did the Lord scatter them upon the face of all the Earth what an amazing story they were in such Unity that they could do as the Bible says they could do whatever they said set their mind to and then God comes down I love the way God does things he comes down and he says I'm just G to make it to where they can't communicate I'm G to take I won't say it Facebook away from them as I was saying this morning I'm gonna make it to where they can't talk to each other and then they will fail because they won't work together the old saying United We Stand and divided we fall here is a very very good example of this right at the beginning of the Bible how important Unity is and communion is a very very part very important part of unity Jesus when he had this last supper it's such a such a tragic story that there he was with his with his disciples and and they were all gathered around and and we know the story how Judas he was there and he just couldn't accept this Jesus he didn't like certain things that he was doing so Judas goes Jesus sends him away Judas goes to to betray Jesus and then Jesus has all of his disciples around him and and there was just such a sadness upon him and he washes their feet and and and he breaks the bread and he he he uh he gives it to them while Judas is there and then they take the wine and and it was just such a solemn time and he says do this in remembrance of me he knew he was going what a what a sweet thing to say imagine if a love one a dear loved one told you that I'm leaving but would you do something that will make you remember me and this is this is the god of Heaven that was made flesh and he said that to these these beloved his best friends the people that he loved the most so they he says well let let's get up and and let's go Jesus knew what was going to happen so they go and they walk down the side of the mountain there and they're they're going down to the foot of the Mountain at the the Mount of Olives and Jesus preaches them a message and he he keeps telling them love one another this is right after communion he's saying love one another serve one another he says by this all men will know that you are my disciples that you're my people because of how much you love one another he gets down to the bottom bottom of the mountain after this sermon and they get to this famous place called The Garden of Gethsemane and Jesus you know how we close in prayer when we have a service Jesus closes in prayer in John chapter 17 and he says this John chapter 17:9 he says I pray for them he says I pray not for the world but for them which thou Hast given me for they are mine they are thine and all mine are thine and thine are mine and I am glorified in them and now I am come no more in the world but these are in the world and I come to thee Holy Father keep through thine own name Those whom thou Hast given me that they may be one as we are one he is leaving his dear friends right there and he's praying for them and he says while I was with them in the world I kept them in thy name those that thou gavest me I have kept and none of them is lost but the son of predition that the scripture might be fulfilled he had just left to go to get the authorities to betray Jesus and now come I to thee and these things I speak in the world that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves they had no idea going to just say what that Joy was I have given them Thy word and the word hath hated them and the world hath hated them because they are not of the world even as I am not of the world I pray not that thou should us take them out of the world but that thou should us keep them from Evil if he would have taken them out of the world brother Aaron then the gospel wouldn't have spread he didn't want to take them out of that that awful place he wanted to leave them there so that they might spread the gospel to others they are not of the world even as I am not of the world sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is truth as thou Hast sent me into the world even so have I also sent them into the world and for their s sakes I sanctify myself that they also might be Sanctified through the through the truth neither pray I think about that right just what he said that I sanctify myself for their sakes he lived this perfect life for them he could have had a wife he could have had children he could have had a career there was one time he said the fox have have dens and the birds have n but the son of man doesn't even have a place to lay his head tonight I don't even have a home and he did it for his friends as thou Hast sent me into the world even so I send them into the world and for their sakes I sanctify myself that they also might be Sanctified through the truth neither pray I for these alone but for them also which Shall Believe on me through their word this is the disciples word word this is Matthew Mark Luke and John this is acts this is all of Paul's writings this is Jude this is James this these are the writings that have been recorded and then we read those and we give our hearts to the Lord and we are the Fulfillment of this scripture right here that they he's very important he's not just praying for these 11 men with him he's also praying for all of us that will hear as he said the gospel through them that they may that they all may be one as thou father art in me and I in thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou has sent me and the glory which thou gavest me I have given them that they may be one even as we are one what a statement there so there is Jesus and he's praying all of his disciples are around him and he's praying he's saying Lord let these disciples that are here let them be one perfectly one just like you father and I am are one that's close that's us we're coming to the communion table tonight he was praying let's just narrow this all the way down to 2024 Cinco Mayo narrow it down right now this room he prayed that we would be so close just as he and the father are that close think about that do you know brother Rome can you tell the difference between the father and the son it's pretty hard huh yeah the the the godhead is something that it's very hard to separate the father and the son they're just so perfectly one that when we pray we say Lord Jesus or we say heavenly father they are that close to where we can't even hardly distinguish them and he said he wants us to be that close wow that's close close that's loving that's a closeit group and it's for a purpose i in them and thou in me that they may be made perfect in one and that the world may know that thou Hast sent me and Hast loved me as thou Hast loved me he's saying again he's saying that this Perfection this this perfectness will come through their Oneness and not only that he says that they will love so each other so much they will be so close that the very world will know that I am the Messiah that I am the savior because the Tucson Tabernacle loves each other so much WoW put it right down here that there should be converts coming here because they see how much we love each other it's written in the book that's how close we should be father I will that they also whom thou Hast given me be with me where I am how sweet Lord my my my desire is that my people these people that I love Lord I know where where I'm going and I want them to be with me heaven just wouldn't be the same maybe without him I want to take these people with me that they may be with me where I am that they may behold my glory which thou Hast given me for thou lovest me before the foundation of the world this is Christ's prayer for us that we would be with him wherever he is it's a beautiful love story between a bridegroom and a bride and how much this bridegroom loves his sweetheart no matter where he goes he wants her to be there with him oh righteous father the world hath not known thee but I have known thee and these have known that thou Hast sent me and I have declared unto them thy name and will declare it that the love wherewith thou Hast loved me May may be in them and I in them so this love that the father has placed here Lord let that love be in the Tucson Tabernacle not just a group of people not just Christians throughout the ages but right here let that love be in us it was Jesus's desire and you know what what I don't think he would have prayed it if it couldn't be true I don't believe that I believe that it can be Jesus prayed that for his disciples and then he went he was crucified rose from the dead came back a little bit later and at the day of Pentecost this prayer was about to manifest itself it was about to come true they were all in one Accord they were in one place trouble had driven them together because they were being persecuted as I've said before it's sad but trouble is a good thing persecution is a good thing God wouldn't send it to us if it wasn't for our good if things are always going so great and and everything's so wonderful we see that we don't give God the time and the importance that we should but let me tell you you get sick one time or your son or your daughter gets sick or you have a catastrophe happen like job did you you go to your knees and you cry out to God so many times these trials they come or every time these trials when they come they are for our own good and that's what was happening here with these disciples they were in one place 120 of them in one room and they were praying together with one Accord they had one purpose and that purpose brought that Unity now these are God's people we saw in the Tower of Babel just now those were worldly people that didn't weren't seeking God here we have God's people and watch what the unity present represents what it what it um comes to before it came to a big tower that got that fell down when they couldn't talk to each other here it comes to a great purpose they're together they're in one mind in one Accord they they're praying and then the promise of the Holy Spirit what Jesus told them would happen it comes down upon them and it fills them with the Holy Spirit and it's looking around like like in this room I would look at you sister Debbie and I'd see there's a light over your head like a tongue of fire oh it's over sister hope look at over here it's brother John it's all it's all over there was all of these lights these pillars of fire all through the room and then come down through this room the sound of a wind and rushing through and the power of God was felt and they came up and they started speaking in unknown tongues just just crazy things were happening they went out there and they were no more afraid what brought them together is fear but there was no more fear anymore they had the power of God with them they went out and they started preaching and they were preaching in different dialects and in different languages stuff that they never knew but be like me preaching in Spanish to somebody that didn't that that didn't understand English and people were hearing them in their own dialects in their own tongues Peter and John they're going forth in the power of the Holy Spirit Peter preaches about baptism and they said how do we the people said how do we get this and Peter's like repent and be baptized that's how you go forward so then Peter and John they're walking in to the to the city and they come to the to the gate called beautiful and there is a man that had been lame that had been crippled since he was born they had never this hadn't happened before Jesus Jesus had done it Peter John walking by the man was crippled he's laying there he put out his hand like will you give me a coin so I I make a living I'm crippled I can't I can't do it Peter the Bible says they fastened their eyes on him looked down said Silver and Gold Have I None but what I have I have to you I I give to you right rise up and walk in the name of Jesus Christ and the man jumped up started running around and he he he was completely healed there was the power this is what Jesus was talking about and what did it do all these people saw it and they started coming to Christ because of this miracle and because of the tongues and because of all of the gifts all of the gifts for one thing brothers and sisters they're not to glorify us right it's to glorify Jesus Christ it's to lift up Jesus Christ whether it's discernment whether it's prophecy whether it's healing whatever it is it is to get people to Christ because these mortal bodies will get sick again but I'll tell you what there is an immortal body waiting there is an eternal body waiting there's a glorified body waiting and that's what we are trying to get people to and that's when you get them to Christ that's the most important and the people saw this more and more people were coming they saw the disciples going out and preaching the gospel and the high priest always the enemy the high priest called them in and commanded that they shouldn't preach Christ anymore this wasn't lining up with their way and the man who was healed was standing right right there with them and they couldn't say anything about it everybody knew that guy he was born like that he always stayed there the the Pharisees walked by him the Sadducees walked by him every morning on the way to the temple it's like oh that's Jose and give him some money and you know get some money but now he's walking around because they now they couldn't say anything about it all they knew was that this man was born that way and now he's different acts 4: 7 Sanhedrin brings them together and when they had set them in the midst they asked by what power or by what name have you done this then Peter filled with the Holy Ghost said unto them you rulers of the people and Elders of Israel if we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent Man by what means he is made whole be it known unto you all and to all the people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth whom you crucified whom God raised from the dead even by him doth this man stand here before you whole amen that's bold before he was cutting people's ear ears off and running away and cussing and trying to separate him from Jesus now things change when you receive the holy spirit this is the stone which was set at not of you Builders which is become the head of the corner neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under Heaven given among men whereby we must be saved the priests and the rulers they got together and they admitted that there was a genuine miracle done but they held to their religion more than when God was manifested right in their eyes the best that they could do was they commanded them not to preach Christ anymore and they threatened them and they let let them go but Peter and John answered them they said what's right they said should we listen to God or should we listen to you you judge well and then he says we can't speak but the we can't speak the things we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard down to verse 23 and being let go they went to their own company and reported all that the chief priests and Elders had said unto them look at the unity now and when they heard that they lifted up their voice to God with one Accord and said Lord Thou Art God which H has made Heaven and Earth and the Sea and all that that in them is look at the unity we don't even know who's talking it doesn't say it's Peter it doesn't say it's John it says they said they were in such Unity that we don't even know who's speaking right here let's skip to verse 29 and they're praying and now Lord behold their threatenings and Grant unto thy servants that with all boldness they may speak Thy Word by stretching forth thy hand to heal and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of the holy of thy H holy Child Jesus and when they had prayed the place was shaken where they were assembled together and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and they spake the word of God with boldness and the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one Soul that's exactly what what the Lord prayed for they were of one heart they were of one Soul neither said any of them ought of the things which he possessed was his own but they had all things in common and with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus and great grace was upon them all why because they loved one another because they were in unity with one another they were fulfilling what Jesus prayed for and that prayer was was not just for them Jesus said it's to all the people that have received the witness even through them it wasn't just for them this is the unity brothers and sisters this is what communion represents is a unified Body of Christ that we are together that we love one another the age John in his Epistles 1 John 2 John third John he says over and over little children love one another he wasn't going into all these deep doctrines and all all of these Grand things he was just saying just love one another because look what love produces it produces healing it produces power it produces Unity that these disciples would love one another and I believe brothers and sisters I believe he was talking to the Tucson Tabernacle I really do remember don't look back don't look at a time that's gone past don't say oh well this was just fulfilled at the day of Acts and the and and the day of Miracles is over and God doesn't do those things anymore yes he does this was not just for yesterday this is for now amen we can't look back look to right now and say Lord what do you require of me I want love I want Unity I want what they had and if we have it here in Acts chapter 4 the whole church was shaken by the power of God because they are of one heart and one Soul how beautiful and that's communion they were breaking bread when they came together and it represents the body and the blood of Jesus Christ you're too quiet that was a good story and it's the best part about it is it's real it's written in the Bible yes how much does the Lord love us and how good is he to us and it was his prayer before he left it was his prayer Lord let them be one as we are one seem loving a group of people that love one another that serve one another that pray for one another remember when Peter when he was arrested prayer was made without ceasing there was always someone praying for Peter and the Lord sent an angel and brought him out of prison and brought him home and that's the kind of church that we need I want it yeah and it's a promise it's a prayer from Jesus Christ himself so I can take it as a promise and if we keep moving towards that if we keep looking towards that then I believe that God will honor it but there's a reason that he says pray for one another love one another you know what that means it means pray for one another it doesn't mean talking about it w it doesn't mean saying oh I'll pray for you and then not praying it doesn't mean the preacher up there talking about it and then it not happening it means that we have to do it get on our knees and pray for one another and have patience with one another we all make mistakes let it go it's all right amen when the person that doesn't make mistakes when you condemn somebody I'll say it's okay no I won't even say then but there's none of us that don't make mistakes the one that never did make mistakes is the one that doesn't condemn wow he's the one that is an advocate and all of us that make mistakes we're the ones that condemn so let's not do it let's not do it let's pray one for another and when when we come up here for this communion service let's go on behalf of each other the Bible says that there is healing in the cup or I don't know if the Bible said that I think brother brandom said that that there is healing in the cup there's healing there because it's people it's Believers coming together why would there not be healing if Believers come together there should always be healing there should always be the supernatural when Believers come together and when we come together and take this bread and take this wine it should be a super natural experience and not just going through the motions so now brothers and sisters as as we approach the communion service if the musicians would would come maybe we could play um sister who's playing sister Martha um if we could just maybe play some soft music and as you were preparing to come and take this communion brothers and sisters don't always worry about yourself there's going to be sin in your life all of us have it it's not right but we should be make a commitment to to get rid of it but as you come for this communion do as the Lord Jesus said and carry one for another pray one for another so now if we could just have maybe a couple minutes of silent meditation and prayer that we each are ready and then pray brother and sisters for your brothers and sisters pray for those that are in this building right now pray for those that aren't in this building that are members of this body go before the Lord for them for just these next few minutes [Music] w [Music] [Music] [Music] father pray for [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] amen the brothers would come forward to serve the communion remember I forgot okay and remember that as this bread is passed before you brothers and sisters remember what it represents it represents a broken body that was broken that was beaten that was nailed to the cross for me for you personally and individually as you take that broken P piece of bread think about that body that was broken for you and as you take that wine think about that blood that was shed on this cross that dripped down onto the ground for you and for me let those thoughts go through your mind 1 Corinthians chap [Music] 11 verse 23 reads like this for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you do this in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup and when he had SED saying this cup is the new Testament in my blood this do ye as off as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do now show the Lord's you do show the Lord's death until he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworth worthily eateth and drinking drinketh damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body but notice in chapter in verse 28 it says let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that [Music] cup he is telling us that we need to do this I'll read it again for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world [Music] [Music] I hold this bread in my hand these broken pieces that represent a broken body of the Lord Jesus Christ it is not his body body but it represents his body let's bow our heads great Heavenly Father Lord Lord I hold this Lord your body in my hands father Lord I pray that your anointing would be here Lord May a blessing represent be represented on each person that takes a piece of this bread I pray father May a special blessing rest upon each one Lord may we take this according to your perfect will Lord we thank you we ask that you sanctify it now may your blessings rest upon it in Jesus name [Music] amen I hold this wine in my hands that represents the blood of Jesus Christ that was shed on Calvary Heavenly Father oh Lord the blood how much we sing about it Lord and how much we talk about it and here I hold in my hands wine that represents the blood of Jesus Christ father May every person that puts this wine to their mouth father may they remember that day on Calvary and may your blessings father your forgiveness amen may it come into their lives and father May each sin be wiped away and Lord may they be white as snow in Jesus Christ's name I pray amen thank you [Music] [Music] Brothers for [Music] [Music] [Music] for [Music] [Music] [Music] for [Music] [Music] all [Music] than [Music] for [Music] for [Music] l [Music] brothers and sisters the the rest of this bread in accordance as the Mana was burned or it's spoiled before the next day this burn this bread also will be burned before the dawn of another day [Music] tonight because of the construction we are not going to have feet washing but I would like to encourage the congregation to remember that feet washing is an act of service and let's not just we won't do it tonight but let's make this our lives that we are constantly washing the feet of the saints that we are constantly serving each other and I think it's it was on my heart to to preach on on Unity of the body and I think it's it's the Lord's will that we're not able to have feet washing because of the construction tonight but let the Lord magnify it in our lives let it be more service than it would normally be in in just washing feet brother Ron Glide well if you come and close let's serve one another I will go ahead and I will read the read the scriptures St John 13:2 it says this and supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of Judas is Carrot Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from God and went to God he riseth from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself and after that he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with a towel wherewith he was girded then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter saith unto him Lord Dost thou wash my feet Jesus answered and said unto him what I do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt know Hereafter Peter Sith unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet Jesus answered him if I wash thee not thou H has no part with me I love Peter's response Simon Peter saith unto him Lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head Jesus saith to him he that is washed neth not save to wash his feet but is clean every wit and ye are clean clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore said he ye are not all clean so after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments and was set down again he said unto them know ye what I have done to [Music] you you call me master and Lord and you say well for so am so I am if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet ye also ought to wash one another's feet for I have given you an example that you should do as I have done to you verily verily I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if ye know these things happy are ye if you do that how many people brothers and sisters tonight are happy that we're able to take communion I'm happy I think once again we have fulfilled another scripture another prophecy that our lord Jesus had set before us brother Ron if you would come [Music] could we all just pray oh God we're so grateful that we can obey your word father is in the Old Testament they they found a a place where they had not been obeying and they were so glad Lord so father this is just one thing we do but we come sincerely and oh God you know my heart I'm trembling for Lord this is a a Time of of seriousness before you

and I would pray that my heart Lord that each and every one of these lovely saints of God that they have not experienced that infilling of your love that they would that Lord they would not sleep night or day until they have satisfied their souls that they know they have met you amen oh God if there's one here Lord that would have any contempt in their heart against another maybe confess that but I believe they have oh Lord there's no big eyes and little you Lord but I pray Lord that each and everyone here tonight would just take advantage of this time to lay aside Lord to put investments in their treasure in heaven and just love one another father truly and oh God that it be a love Lord that they would put aside anything Lord For Love covers a multitude of sins we know that if we do not forgive you will not forgive us amen and oh God we want to be forgiven we must be forgiven it is absolute necessity oh God that we must be forgiven for Lord there is life and death it is not a
