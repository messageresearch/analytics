[48:18] scripture i see it in the book of acts
[48:19] and
[48:20] something happened the other day there's
[48:21] about five supernatural things that
[48:23] happened in my life and i
[48:24] and i was writing him down i said lord
[48:26] that's what that's what that is that's
[48:28] what's happening in my life and how the
[48:30] holy spirit i'm doing a study on it when
[48:31] the holy spirit spoke in the book of the
[48:33] acts and the holy spirit
[48:35] did this and this and this and so i'm be
[48:37] i'm seeing that in my life and i'm so
[48:39] thankful for it i want to see it in all
[48:41] of our lives i say lord i want to see
[48:44] that branch put forth another that vine
[48:47] put forth
[48:48] another branch and i want to be one of i
[48:50] want to be one of those branches
[48:51] he said i'm the vines you be the
[48:53] branches you bear the fruit amen and i
[48:55] believe it's there for us
[48:56] we have a promise that we have a message
[48:58] that would come and turn our hearts back
[49:00] to the faith of our fathers
[49:02] and i believe god's doing something in
[49:03] my life amen i believe he's getting a
[49:05] people ready
[49:06] right before he comes to take him take
[49:08] that bride home
[49:09] there's a short quick work that he's
[49:11] doing and i want to be a part of it
[49:13] i don't we're not here for popularity or
[49:16] any
[49:17] fame i don't really care about any of
[49:19] those things i'm
[49:21] not here for money i'm just here because
[49:23] i love you all
[49:24] and and the lord has put a burden on my
[49:28] heart for
[49:29] for you all and we'll just try to go
[49:32] through the next four weeks and just see
[49:34] what the lord will do among us
[49:35] i was reading something i went away
[49:37] after i went back i went away for a few
[49:39] days to pray
[49:40] and i was the lord did some things in my
[49:43] life
[49:44] and i was driving up to this one area
[49:46] there and
[49:47] and uh isn't it amazing as you listen to
[49:49] god's prophet you're branded
[49:51] where you are as a geographical location
[49:53] i don't know if you have experiences
[49:54] like that but
[49:55] so i'm going to read this quote where i
[49:57] wa and then i'll go back there
[49:59] virtually in my mind where i was when i
[50:01] heard brother branham say this
[50:02] this is in the message elijah brahm said
[50:05] i want god to love me i want the people
[50:07] to love me that's exactly the truth and
[50:09] if god loves me then the people will
[50:11] love
[50:12] me and if i love his people then he will
[50:14] love me for doing it
[50:17] he said god would rather i'd love you
[50:19] than love him
[50:21] did you know that i'd rather you love my
[50:23] boy back there no matter what you say
[50:25] about me i want you to love my children
[50:27] any father would think that so father
[50:30] god knows the same thing
[50:32] thinks the same thing for he said in so
[50:34] much as you've done it unto the least of
[50:35] these my little ones
[50:37] you have did it unto me so if you want
[50:39] to love god
[50:40] just start loving his children god will
[50:44] reward you
[50:45] if you'll just love his children that
[50:47] shows the love of god
[50:49] is in you amen so i want to love the
[50:52] lord jesus i want to love his people
[50:55] amen i was just just thinking so many
[50:58] memories that we had in the last four
[50:59] weeks of having the revival and having
[51:01] the communion and having the prayer line
[51:03] and
[51:04] seeing god do things in people's lives
[51:06] and i don't think god's finished with
[51:07] this
[51:08] yet i don't know i believe just another
[51:10] season here that god will do more things
[51:12] before
[51:12] i'm anticipating it wherever god is
[51:15] there's supernatural things happening in
[51:17] people's lives happening in marriages
[51:19] happening in children's life young
[51:20] people's life
[51:21] changing their lives we need the holy
[51:23] spirit more than we ever did we were
[51:25] back home dealing with the young people
[51:26] and this and that we were talking about
[51:28] okay
[51:28] i heard my wife on the phone she said
[51:29] you know my child we went through that
[51:31] but when my son received the holy spirit
[51:33] everything changed in his life the
[51:35] rebellion and
[51:36] all the other stuff and all of that
[51:38] stuff changed because of the holy spirit
[51:40] encountering the holy spirit we need it
[51:42] we as adults need it sometimes like the
[51:44] kids need it but we as adults need the
[51:46] holy spirit
[51:47] continue to have experiences through our
[51:49] our lives
[51:50] in christ amen we have a special family
[51:53] special guest our brother john mcfadden
[51:55] and his wife
[51:56] we've grown to love them and know them
[51:59] and appreciated their daughter singing
[52:00] i know brother matthew has grown to have
[52:02] a special place
[52:04] in my heart and i appreciate him i don't
[52:07] know all of their family in fact i've
[52:08] never heard him speak
[52:09] and we've not spent a lot of time
[52:11] together but i can tell by his children
[52:12] that he loves the lord
[52:14] and he's put a lot of work into that
[52:15] that's not an accident and somebody
[52:17] laboring
[52:18] amen and so i want him to come i've just
[52:20] uh he's got a wedding tonight i think he
[52:22] has to attend or perform
[52:24] but i just want him to come and maybe
[52:26] take about 10 or 15 minutes and greet us
[52:28] he doesn't have his bible so
[52:30] it's not maybe it won't be as long as
[52:32] brother daniel but
[52:33] i just want him to greet you all and say
[52:35] something to encourage us the bible says
[52:36] there's many ministry one gives
[52:38] exhortation one
[52:39] prophesies one preaches and so we just
[52:41] want our brother to come and say what
[52:43] the lord's put on his heart brother john
[52:45] god bless you my friend yes
[52:49] all right thank you god bless you it's
[52:52] good to be here
[52:54] and i i promise to be sure i promised
[52:56] him that so
[52:57] that's why i left the bible there
[53:00] i uh i have this one confidence
[53:04] no matter what we think or what we think
[53:06] should be god's in control
[53:08] you know and so sometimes as humans we
[53:11] think
[53:11] things should be this way or that way
[53:12] but i really deep down hope that we
[53:15] trust
[53:16] god's going to have his way and
[53:19] i was talking to brother daniel i really
[53:20] appreciate brother daniel i've heard him
[53:22] preach
[53:22] and he's much better than i am so i'm
[53:25] glad to hear him today
[53:27] but we know that that's god that uses
[53:28] different ministries it's not ever the
[53:30] man
[53:31] the very first time i spoke the lord
[53:33] dealt with me that
[53:35] the gift in the ministry is not for the
[53:38] ministry it's for the people
[53:40] it's like the heavens declare the glory
[53:42] of god right so
[53:44] they're speaking to us every day
[53:46] sometimes we don't look up
[53:48] but it's still speaking and that's what
[53:50] god does he'll put a gift in a man's
[53:52] life
[53:53] and it's not really the man but it's our
[53:56] god who loves to hide himself he comes
[53:58] down and he and he
[53:59] and he speaks and he ministers and
[54:01] that's god's blessing to you
[54:02] so i think we should just respect the
[54:05] the different ministries and it's not
[54:06] just in
[54:07] it's in it's in all of us christ in us
[54:10] the hope of glory
[54:11] so i just wanted to share something that
[54:13] lord's been blessing me with
[54:15] and i had a i was really blessed to hear
[54:17] what he had to say about the book of
[54:18] acts because back home we've been
[54:20] talking about
[54:21] for for many weeks i was listening to
[54:24] brother branham in the third exodus
[54:26] and he said in there and you can listen
[54:28] for yourself
[54:29] he says now they told him about the
[54:31] exodus out of israel egypt
[54:33] he says now the question is why were
[54:35] they out of the promised land
[54:38] and and he says now we've got to go back
[54:39] to genesis to see what happened and why
[54:41] they were there
[54:42] and then he says and you can catch it as
[54:44] you listen to it he says
[54:46] and why is the church out of the land
[54:48] that god promised to them
[54:50] he said pentecost and the book of acts
[54:55] amen you know and i like to be honest
[54:58] with myself i know we
[54:59] individuals like daniel was saying you
[55:00] have experiences but what i'm seeing is
[55:03] not what i see in the book of acts i
[55:04] want to see a book of acts
[55:06] church and so i think that's the holy
[55:08] spirit ministering
[55:10] through daniel and laying on my heart we
[55:12] are promised
[55:13] a book of acts church pentecost is the
[55:16] promised land
[55:18] not churchianity denominationalism
[55:20] intellectualism and all those things
[55:22] we want the supernatural baptism of the
[55:24] holy ghost leading the bride
[55:26] into the rapture and out of here and so
[55:29] um
[55:30] i was so happy to hear that because
[55:32] that's the true church of god
[55:34] what the lord's blessed me with and i
[55:35] got to talk to brother lyle about it
[55:37] he's been feeding on this author
[55:39] hugh ross how many people have heard of
[55:41] hugh ross raise your hand
[55:43] okay there's a few lyle's been
[55:47] feeding on his books for years and just
[55:50] in the past year that i feel like the
[55:52] lord led me to this
[55:54] man who is a christian man but he's an
[55:56] astrophysicist
[55:58] and he's on the autistic scale so when
[56:00] he was seven years old
[56:02] he could hardly talk to people he
[56:04] couldn't really write
[56:05] but he was reading seven physics books a
[56:08] week
[56:09] so he has this gift in his mind and he
[56:11] was he was bullied and things and you
[56:13] can hear him talk about it he's on the
[56:14] internet hugh
[56:16] ross i think it'll be a blessing to you
[56:18] so
[56:19] i just want to share that i think this
[56:22] man
[56:23] god led him you know to realize at a
[56:26] young age
[56:27] through his scientific mind that there
[56:30] was a beginning that the big bang was
[56:32] true he said well if there's a beginning
[56:35] there had to be a beginner
[56:37] and he started looking through
[56:38] philosophy and the holy books looking
[56:40] for the
[56:41] the creator the beginner and he he was
[56:44] he dismissed many of the holy books and
[56:46] he said he was real smug
[56:47] until he got to the bible and when he
[56:50] got to the bible he says all right
[56:51] there's something here he started
[56:52] reading genesis
[56:54] and then he he said all right
[56:57] i'll i'm going to commit to an hour a
[56:59] day and he estimated it would take him
[57:01] four weeks
[57:03] 18 months later
[57:06] he turned to the back of his gideon
[57:08] bible and signed and gave his life to
[57:10] jesus christ he said the god of this
[57:12] bible is the god that created this
[57:13] universe
[57:17] and and i just love this guy he's in his
[57:19] 70s now he has a great demeanor he'll
[57:21] debate these atheists that say you know
[57:23] there's no god and
[57:25] he when they're rude he he holds himself
[57:28] dignified because he knows he's right
[57:30] and he's able to present evidence now
[57:32] here's the thing
[57:33] all the evidence in the universe and
[57:36] and all the modern discoveries are
[57:38] pointing to the fact
[57:40] that the bible is correct
[57:44] and the god of the bible is the creator
[57:47] now we know this so so what's the big
[57:50] deal brother john
[57:51] well as you look at what he's done he's
[57:54] amassed
[57:55] so many evidences of how the universe is
[57:58] fine-tuned it's precise for instance
[58:01] i'll take one little one the sun
[58:03] if it was any bigger or smaller we
[58:05] couldn't be here if we were any closer
[58:07] or farther we couldn't be here
[58:08] there's so many of those things in the
[58:10] universe that
[58:11] his conclusion as an astrophysicist is
[58:14] that it appears
[58:16] that the whole universe was designed so
[58:19] that human life could exist here on this
[58:21] planet
[58:23] and then he's got a book improbable
[58:24] planet there's so many special things
[58:27] about this planet
[58:28] it's unlikely there's another planet
[58:30] like it in the whole universe
[58:33] our galaxy is special we are placed in a
[58:37] special place in the galaxy between the
[58:39] spiral arms
[58:40] we are we have a special solar system
[58:42] our moon is unusually large
[58:44] there's so many things that are
[58:46] precisely fine-tuned
[58:48] our atmosphere everything the tectonic
[58:51] plates
[58:51] you can just look constantly there's if
[58:54] you do the math
[58:55] it's you have a better chance to win the
[58:57] lottery
[58:58] than for all this falling in place to be
[59:01] a coincidence so it's not a coincidence
[59:04] our god is god so then i think of all
[59:07] humanity in the short time that we're
[59:09] here
[59:10] and and then i think of christianity and
[59:13] and
[59:14] you know listen if you realize that the
[59:17] god of creation
[59:19] has revealed himself to you you are
[59:21] beyond
[59:22] blessed we should never take that for
[59:26] granted
[59:27] i was talking a lot about isn't it
[59:28] something that we can really know
[59:31] we're being taught by god we're being
[59:33] schooled sometimes it's correction
[59:35] sometimes he lifts us up when we're down
[59:37] but we're being schooled by god
[59:39] not just for this life but for the
[59:42] beyond
[59:44] and so what encouraged me is i saw all
[59:48] this preparation now i don't believe in
[59:50] seven 24-hour days and and because
[59:52] that's not what it appears to be and i
[59:53] don't think god's like fooling us out
[59:55] there
[59:56] you know it shows that the universe is
[59:58] probably about 13.73 billion years old
[1:00:03] and the earth itself and the sun is
[1:00:05] about 4.5 billion years old
[1:00:07] and when you let this this genius huros
[1:00:10] take you through what happened
[1:00:12] and all the steps and this had to happen
[1:00:13] so this could happen and this could
[1:00:15] happen
[1:00:15] and all the preparation for humanity to
[1:00:19] exist
[1:00:22] god spent a lot of time and effort so
[1:00:25] humans could live here
[1:00:30] it makes me think everything in our life
[1:00:33] is preparation for right now
[1:00:38] god is fixing to do something that
[1:00:41] people have no
[1:00:42] idea what's about to hit this earth
[1:00:45] don't look at the way things are
[1:00:47] remember the ball on the bicycle
[1:00:49] look at where you're going don't look
[1:00:51] where you don't look at the your
[1:00:52] condition the church's condition the
[1:00:54] world's condition
[1:00:55] look at the promise of god he's coming
[1:00:58] back for abroad
[1:01:00] and i just want you to know all the
[1:01:02] trials and all the tests in your life
[1:01:04] everything you're going through it's all
[1:01:05] preparation we can trust god
[1:01:07] he knows what he's doing and
[1:01:10] i for one let's throw in behind daniel
[1:01:13] and his wife
[1:01:14] let's believe god is able
[1:01:17] you know we're not giving complete
[1:01:19] control of the world to daniel and his
[1:01:21] wife
[1:01:22] god's still in control
[1:01:25] but i see committed people and i've
[1:01:28] heard him preach and i enjoy it every
[1:01:30] time so let's hear him preach today
[1:01:32] is that all right
[1:01:39] [Applause]
[1:01:40] man thank you brother
[1:01:44] brother john god bless you let's all
[1:01:46] stand together
[1:01:48] amen isn't god good give us so many
[1:01:52] blessings
[1:01:54] man i've got a tablet here today i'm
[1:01:56] going to try something new preaching off
[1:01:58] this thing because i don't have a
[1:02:00] printer where we're staying and all that
[1:02:02] good stuff so
[1:02:04] if it all of a sudden takes a left turn
[1:02:06] brother aaron you'll know the battery
[1:02:07] died in this thing or something happened
[1:02:09] and brother daniel's on his own but
[1:02:12] amen i studied most of the day yesterday
[1:02:14] and are in the room praying and
[1:02:16] listening to
[1:02:16] some tapes of god's prophet and just
[1:02:19] praying for the lord
[1:02:20] amen speak to our hearts that's what we
[1:02:22] need is god to speak to us
[1:02:24] god just speak to our wife god speak to
[1:02:27] our
[1:02:28] son our daughter our children if they
[1:02:31] can have an experience with god it'll
[1:02:32] make all the difference
[1:02:34] we can teach about god but there's a
[1:02:36] difference when you meet the lord jesus
[1:02:38] christ
[1:02:38] it changed moses it changed saint paul
[1:02:41] and it changed me
[1:02:43] it's so easy to preach about something
[1:02:45] you've experienced
[1:02:46] amen let's just pray together heavenly
[1:02:49] father it's so good to be in your house
[1:02:51] today to feel your presence lord
[1:02:53] we love you father we believe lord

[1:02:57] you're still on the throne today father
[1:02:59] and as we open your word
[1:03:01] lord we just pray you would speak to us
[1:03:04] lord i pray that you would take the
[1:03:05] thoughts that you've placed on my heart
[1:03:07] and i pray that you would help the lord
[1:03:09] to just be effective to
[1:03:11] the those that it's intended for lord we
[1:03:14] believe you're
[1:03:15] we're your children lord and we just
[1:03:17] pray that you would bless us now in a
[1:03:19] special way bless those that are online
[1:03:21] and that are streaming
[1:03:22] i pray that they would feel the presence
[1:03:24] of the lord as well and they would be
[1:03:25] drawn closer to you
[1:03:27] we pray and ask it in jesus name amen
[1:03:31] amen i want to also thank the elders
[1:03:34] brother aaron especially he's been so
[1:03:36] faithful through the years
[1:03:37] how many years you've been going to the
[1:03:38] church brother aaron
[1:03:40] 32 god bless you amen brother aaron i
[1:03:43] appreciate
[1:03:44] him
[1:03:46] [Applause]
[1:03:49] i didn't get through all the trustees
[1:03:51] brother arne and brother
[1:03:52] ed and brother jordan they all are
[1:03:54] special men that have a lot of character
[1:03:56] and i
[1:03:57] am thankful to be associated with men
[1:03:59] who have character
[1:04:00] and not only them but their family amen
[1:04:02] their families each one are special to
[1:04:04] us
[1:04:05] if you have your bible saint john
[1:04:07] chapter 9
[1:04:10] saint john chapter nine
[1:04:21] you know sometimes people take things
[1:04:22] that i say and they take it out of
[1:04:24] context
[1:04:25] so if you hear something about me you
[1:04:27] don't understand it just give me a
[1:04:29] couple more
[1:04:30] services and you'll you'll maybe find
[1:04:32] out that that wasn't exactly right
[1:04:34] so you'll learn about me and give me a
[1:04:37] chance to express myself and
[1:04:39] and that just like having this pulpit
[1:04:41] down here i'm not used to being that so
[1:04:43] far away from
[1:04:44] people that's probably just me where we
[1:04:46] turn we
[1:04:47] uh we're in our church the first
[1:04:49] person's right there and then they're
[1:04:50] just
[1:04:51] packed body to body at our church where
[1:04:53] we are so you all are way away from me
[1:04:56] right now it's
[1:04:57] back in our backyard when i went to the
[1:04:59] branham tabernacle we moved there when i
[1:05:01] was two and i
[1:05:02] helped brother brad when i was 19. so
[1:05:04] for 17 years we went to the branham
[1:05:07] tabernacle and if you've been there the
[1:05:08] pulpit's here and the first row is right
[1:05:10] there
[1:05:10] they've taken a row out now for weddings
[1:05:12] and things but the row is right there so
[1:05:14] when i was sat on the front row
[1:05:16] it was just you were just right in the
[1:05:18] right in the thick of it so it's
[1:05:20] you all just take it for brother
[1:05:22] daniel's got some problems but
[1:05:24] the lord's working on him saint john
[1:05:26] chapter nine
[1:05:28] verse one and as jesus passed by he saw
[1:05:30] a man which was blind from his birth and
[1:05:32] his disciples asking master
[1:05:34] who did send this man or his parents
[1:05:36] that he was born blind
[1:05:38] jesus answered neither what a shocker
[1:05:42] well surely that you know that's the day
[1:05:44] we live in everybody wants to blame
[1:05:45] somebody
[1:05:46] i want to blame somebody i've had this
[1:05:49] problem and i want to
[1:05:50] blame and jesus said neither
[1:05:53] hath this man sin nor his parents but
[1:05:55] that the works of god should be made
[1:05:58] manifest in him
[1:06:00] sometimes we go through things in life
[1:06:01] and we want to blame
[1:06:03] rather than just saying you know what
[1:06:05] this was all for the glory of god
[1:06:07] we'd never had a testimony this man
[1:06:09] being healed
[1:06:10] if the works of christ hadn't come and
[1:06:12] he could manifest himself
[1:06:14] he goes on in verse 4 says jesus said i
[1:06:16] must works the works of him that sent me
[1:06:18] while it is day
[1:06:20] the night cometh when no man can work as
[1:06:22] long as i am in the world i am the light
[1:06:25] of the world may god add his blessing to
[1:06:27] the word you may be seated
[1:06:29] i'm just going to kind of relax and be
[1:06:31] myself this morning if that's okay
[1:06:33] this is just brother daniel i can't be
[1:06:35] brother john mcfadden
[1:06:37] he's brother john mcfadden but i can
[1:06:39] just be brother daniel
[1:06:40] you know every person is an influence
[1:06:44] each one of you are an influence brother
[1:06:46] brandon would have the prayer line at
[1:06:47] the end he said now don't move around he
[1:06:49] said because each one of you is a spirit
[1:06:50] and when you move i
[1:06:51] i watch your spirits so each one of us
[1:06:54] our life
[1:06:55] is speaking today your life has already
[1:06:58] spoken to people
[1:06:58] if you're a father and you got up and
[1:07:00] went to the house of the lord your
[1:07:01] children are watching you
[1:07:03] are you with me today your life is
[1:07:05] speaking
[1:07:06] even if you die abel died and god came
[1:07:08] to cain said where's your brother he
[1:07:10] said i don't know am i my brother's
[1:07:11] keeper he said but his blood
[1:07:13] cries from the earth i got a text this
[1:07:16] morning from my son and said dad
[1:07:18] i appreciate you what you did was right
[1:07:20] in your life
[1:07:21] our lives are speaking our brother said
[1:07:24] you mothers you're the fifth gospel
[1:07:25] sister figueroa your life is still
[1:07:27] speaking to your children
[1:07:28] you're sitting by your grandchildren
[1:07:30] your life is a loud voice she's sitting
[1:07:32] there she's quiet but her
[1:07:33] life is speaking so i say all that to
[1:07:37] say a couple weeks ago
[1:07:38] i logged in and brother peter was
[1:07:40] speaking at the church and i was
[1:07:42] trying to be a part of the service and
[1:07:44] and he was speaking about each one of us
[1:07:46] having a work to do for the lord and
[1:07:48] the lord just began to deal with me on
[1:07:50] this subject here in verse number four
[1:07:52] jesus said i must work the works of him
[1:07:54] that sent me while it is day
[1:07:56] the night cometh when no man can work
[1:07:58] the holy spirit began to deal with me
[1:08:00] that
[1:08:01] the the little subject the work while
[1:08:03] it's day
[1:08:05] work while it's day and so sometimes the
[1:08:08] holy spirit will put something on your
[1:08:09] heart and you just kind of let it go and
[1:08:11] so thursday when we were flying in i'm
[1:08:13] going through the tsi line and a
[1:08:15] tsa and i got all my bags i don't know
[1:08:17] why i think i end up with four trays so
[1:08:20] they're like you want your phone and
[1:08:21] your tablet then your computer
[1:08:23] and then i had a drone in another bag
[1:08:24] and all of a sudden i got all this stuff
[1:08:26] all like
[1:08:27] and i feel like a train going through
[1:08:28] there and the man said no you got to
[1:08:30] stand right here and push
[1:08:31] everything till it goes in there like
[1:08:32] okay i stand there and he pushes all
[1:08:34] and i get to the other line of stuff's
[1:08:36] coming out the other end and the holy
[1:08:37] spirit speaks to me and says work while
[1:08:39] it's day
[1:08:40] the night comes when no man can work
[1:08:44] so as i began to think about this i
[1:08:46] began to think because jesus says it
[1:08:48] here and he's talking about his work
[1:08:50] being impeded or stopped or inhibited
[1:08:54] because the night was coming and as i
[1:08:57] began to think about that
[1:08:58] i just want to read a couple quotes here
[1:09:00] to identify who jesus
[1:09:02] was and then who you are is we can all
[1:09:04] read the bible know who jesus
[1:09:06] is but can you recognize yourself in
[1:09:09] this great plan
[1:09:10] a lot of people recognize jesus 2000
[1:09:12] years ago but what about today
[1:09:14] so brother branham says in the message
[1:09:16] show us the father he said god is a
[1:09:18] spirit he has no hands
[1:09:20] he had no hands till he became jesus he
[1:09:22] had no feet no arms no legs so forth
[1:09:24] until he became
[1:09:25] jesus he manifested no man has seen the
[1:09:28] father at any time the only begotten
[1:09:31] has declared him he god dwelt in a body
[1:09:34] of christ
[1:09:35] it's amazing he said he came to a stable
[1:09:37] born over a manure power
[1:09:39] pile little jehovah crying in a manger
[1:09:41] little jehovah playing as a boy
[1:09:43] little jehovah toiling as a man he cried
[1:09:45] he crossed his cast with us he
[1:09:48] became human i think it's saint john 4
[1:09:50] god is a spirit
[1:09:52] and then the bible says saint john 1 the
[1:09:53] word became flesh and dwelt among us in
[1:09:56] the body of jesus christ
[1:09:58] he said when jesus christ was born god
[1:10:00] was human on earth
[1:10:02] manifesting god what he was he toiled he
[1:10:04] labored he felt
[1:10:05] for the teenager he went through every
[1:10:07] temptation that we go through
[1:10:10] amen brother adam goes on to say
[1:10:13] now christ he ascended up on high we
[1:10:15] know that he gave gifts unto men
[1:10:17] paul meets him on the road to damascus
[1:10:19] the light strikes him down
[1:10:21] and he said who are you lord and he said
[1:10:23] i am jesus
[1:10:24] brother ram goes on to say what he said
[1:10:26] the pillar of fire again to fulfill his
[1:10:28] promise
[1:10:29] he said i came from the spirit world i
[1:10:31] go back to the spirit world
[1:10:33] the flesh was only brought here for a
[1:10:35] sacrifice to redeem us as sinners
[1:10:38] so jesus christ has ascended back but he
[1:10:41] sent his spirit back to live inside of a
[1:10:43] people aren't you thankful for that
[1:10:45] amen he said i won't leave you
[1:10:46] comfortless sister fiora
[1:10:48] amen he said i will come to you i'll be
[1:10:50] a comforter to you
[1:10:51] i love it he said i'll be a guide to you
[1:10:53] oh blessed be the name of jesus christ
[1:10:56] he'll be a guide to you
[1:10:57] how do people ever go through life
[1:10:59] without a guide they need a guide if
[1:11:01] you're here today and you're wondering
[1:11:02] you're like i don't know
[1:11:03] you need a guide you need that
[1:11:05] everlasting eternal god to live
[1:11:07] inside of you he said i'm not going to
[1:11:09] leave you out there you'll have a guide
[1:11:11] that will lead you and will guide you
[1:11:13] i'm so thankful for that guide today
[1:11:15] he goes on to say brother adam said this
[1:11:18] in the message faith he said
[1:11:19] jesus said he said i am the vine you are
[1:11:21] the branches the vine doesn't bear fruit
[1:11:23] it purges the branches the branches
[1:11:26] bear the fruit he has no hands
[1:11:29] but mine and yours
[1:11:32] i think we talked about that a couple
[1:11:33] weeks ago remember jesus can't touch the
[1:11:35] earth because the bible says the dead in
[1:11:37] christ
[1:11:37] will rise first and we'll be caught up
[1:11:39] to meet him in the air so he's limited
[1:11:41] that he can't come down
[1:11:42] and work with people at the at your job
[1:11:44] site or somebody at the
[1:11:45] the laundromat or or so he can't do that
[1:11:48] because he's limited by the scriptures
[1:11:51] so he has no hands but your hands he has
[1:11:54] no
[1:11:55] he goes on to say he has no eyes but
[1:11:57] mine and yours
[1:11:58] because he has returned into the spirit
[1:12:00] and another message be not afraid he
[1:12:01] said
[1:12:02] he hasn't got no lips but mine and yours
[1:12:06] he only has hands as he can use mine and
[1:12:09] yours
[1:12:11] oh i trust this just comes and becomes
[1:12:12] real real to us today
[1:12:15] amen how many of us have hindered the
[1:12:17] ministry of jesus christ by not giving
[1:12:19] him
[1:12:19] our lips not giving him our hands or
[1:12:22] maybe are using our lips for something
[1:12:25] that's maybe how can it not bad it's
[1:12:27] just idle
[1:12:28] using our hands and something that's not
[1:12:30] i think at 12 years old jesus said i've
[1:12:33] got to be about my father's business
[1:12:35] oh isn't it great at 12 years old he has
[1:12:37] a purpose in life
[1:12:39] he has a purpose he's got to be about
[1:12:41] our father's business oh if we would get
[1:12:43] a revelation of that
[1:12:44] that god is totally and he's hampered
[1:12:47] because he doesn't have lips or hands
[1:12:49] or if this would come to such a
[1:12:50] revelation our hearts we as sisters
[1:12:52] could testify and
[1:12:53] pick up our phone and call somebody and
[1:12:56] just talk to them and witness to them
[1:12:57] and be god
[1:12:58] manifested in the flesh great is the
[1:13:02] mystery of godless
[1:13:03] god was manifested in the flesh we can
[1:13:06] see jesus christ but can you see today
[1:13:08] that god is manifested in the flesh
[1:13:11] and modest sisters that play their
[1:13:13] instance or brother enoch sitting here
[1:13:15] playing his instruments that's not an
[1:13:17] accident
[1:13:19] gravity there's a thing called gravity
[1:13:21] and when you let it go things just f
[1:13:23] it's a law
[1:13:25] every one of us have a law it's the i
[1:13:27] think the bible says it's the law of sin
[1:13:30] and being turned loose how's it say in
[1:13:32] revelation man is water
[1:13:34] and man he flows to the water flows to
[1:13:37] the lowest form and picks up dirt and
[1:13:39] contamination along the way we'll say it
[1:13:41] like that that's why brother jordan can
[1:13:43] stand in here and experience
[1:13:44] people having many mental conditions and
[1:13:47] going to the lowest form
[1:13:48] but god rich in mercy has reached and
[1:13:51] touched our lives
[1:13:53] has touched the musicians and now
[1:13:54] they're using their talent not for the
[1:13:56] devil but using it for jesus christ
[1:13:58] i say that's a miracle i say that's
[1:14:01] supernatural
[1:14:02] that's god doing something in their
[1:14:04] their lives and
[1:14:06] not only to use them but each one of us
[1:14:07] god wants to use you as
[1:14:09] as a mother as a grandmother as a
[1:14:12] as a young man amen i see our helicopter
[1:14:15] pilots back there
[1:14:16] god bless them aren't you thankful for
[1:14:18] our military
[1:14:20] i'm standing here today with the freedom
[1:14:22] of religion because people went and gave
[1:14:24] their life
[1:14:25] that we could stand here for the freedom
[1:14:27] of religion
[1:14:29] amen we our hats ought to be off to
[1:14:31] those people it grieves me when you see
[1:14:33] people go the korean war and the
[1:14:35] and the vietnam and come back and and
[1:14:38] the things that were done to those
[1:14:39] veterans amen we ought to i mean
[1:14:40] freedom's not free i'll say
[1:14:42] let's just put a plug in for the
[1:14:43] military freedom's not free
[1:14:46] somebody gave their life i mean this
[1:14:48] gospel is not free people
[1:14:51] gave amen gave their blood as the song
[1:14:53] said there's many that have given their
[1:14:55] blood and there'll be more that'll give
[1:14:56] their life's blood for this
[1:14:57] holy ghost gospel amen i want to be one
[1:15:00] to give my life for christ
[1:15:03] amen how many want to give your life to
[1:15:04] christ today say lord
[1:15:06] take my hands lord take my lips lord
[1:15:09] take my strength lord and
[1:15:11] give me the holy ghost lord and let me
[1:15:12] do something for the kingdom of god
[1:15:15] amen the bible says if you want to be
[1:15:17] great in the kingdom be the servants
[1:15:20] be the servant of all
[1:15:23] matthew chapter five i'm trying to work
[1:15:25] with our audio video keep people i
[1:15:27] wrote i don't i'm just everywhere but so
[1:15:29] i wrote a couple verses down matthew
[1:15:31] chapter 5 verse 13.
[1:15:34] amen matthew chapter 5 verse 13 to 16
[1:15:37] jesus now is talking he said
[1:15:38] ye are the salt of the earth i don't
[1:15:41] know if they gave them to you back their
[1:15:42] brothers or not
[1:15:43] jesus said ye are the salt of the earth
[1:15:46] but if the salt have lost
[1:15:47] its savior wherewith shall it be salted
[1:15:52] as the one man said you you can lead a
[1:15:54] horse to water but you can't make him
[1:15:55] drink
[1:15:57] but the other man said well hey i can
[1:15:58] put enough salt in his oats that he'll
[1:16:01] want to drink
[1:16:02] and i can't make people love jesus
[1:16:04] christ but i trust that we may
[1:16:06] become so salty in our life portrayed
[1:16:09] such a god that loves you and
[1:16:11] cares about you and gave his all that
[1:16:13] you could have peace and
[1:16:14] you can lay down on your bed at night
[1:16:16] and have peace in your soul
[1:16:19] i tell you i remember what it was as a
[1:16:22] 15 year old boy and
[1:16:23] raised in a christian home a godly home
[1:16:25] and and such a never
[1:16:27] anything out of the way just a life
[1:16:29] given to christ and my
[1:16:31] father and my mother what godly people
[1:16:34] and to think i straight away just
[1:16:37] listening to some bad music and at night
[1:16:39] i would lay in bed and just the tears
[1:16:41] run out of my eyes and
[1:16:43] fill my pillow because i wanted to find
[1:16:46] god
[1:16:46] i wanted to experience the lord jesus
[1:16:49] christ
[1:16:50] amen and a young boy at a camp at 15
[1:16:52] years old i
[1:16:53] walked down an order oh i was sitting
[1:16:55] about where brother mcfadden was and i
[1:16:57] remember i walked down and
[1:16:58] knelt down and i gave my whole life to
[1:17:00] jesus christ
[1:17:01] not under an emotion but lord i want to
[1:17:03] give you my life
[1:17:06] amen i want you to live inside of me i
[1:17:08] want to live eternally
[1:17:10] and i can't do this without you
[1:17:13] oh if we could get to that place this
[1:17:15] morning lord i can't do this without you
[1:17:18] jesus says it without me you can do
[1:17:19] nothing but sometimes we get in our
[1:17:21] heads
[1:17:21] hey i got this you might have that in
[1:17:24] your head
[1:17:25] sorry my eyes leak sometimes when god
[1:17:27] squeezes my heart my eyes leak
[1:17:28] it's another problem i have i tell my
[1:17:31] secretaries at work
[1:17:32] i say hey it's one good thing i say you
[1:17:34] can just say hey i work with handicapped
[1:17:35] people
[1:17:36] brother daniel's got so many handicaps
[1:17:38] and that's one of them when god's
[1:17:39] squeezing my heart my
[1:17:40] tears come out of my eyes
[1:17:44] but it wouldn't do us all a little bit
[1:17:45] to cry a little bit
[1:17:48] you see men that can't be touched that's
[1:17:50] not a that's not a man that's a brute
[1:17:53] the greatest man was jesus christ and he
[1:17:56] sat one day and looked at the condition
[1:17:58] of his disciples and the bible says the
[1:18:00] shortest verse you probably if you went
[1:18:01] to sunday school it was your go-to verse
[1:18:03] they said you got a verse that jesus
[1:18:05] wept jesus wept
[1:18:07] jesus wept oh if we could just learn
[1:18:09] that and become like jesus
[1:18:11] and we could weep a little bit when you
[1:18:12] see the condition of the church and the
[1:18:14] people and how things are going away and
[1:18:16] then he climbs
[1:18:17] up on jerusalem and he sits down again
[1:18:19] the bible says he sat down and he
[1:18:21] held jerusalem of jerusalem he's looking
[1:18:23] at the condition of the church
[1:18:25] and he's beginning to weep there was a
[1:18:26] burden in his heart we need more men
[1:18:28] like that
[1:18:29] have a burden for the condition of the
[1:18:32] church of god and
[1:18:33] not just this church but christianity of
[1:18:35] the message as a whole and
[1:18:37] have a bird and say how can it be going
[1:18:38] this way we see the music becoming
[1:18:41] modern and contemporary and those things
[1:18:43] and where is the real sincerity and even
[1:18:45] the preaching sometimes
[1:18:46] where is the preaching that grips your
[1:18:48] heart and convicts you and when you
[1:18:50] leave you say you know what i was
[1:18:52] convicted by the holy ghost i didn't
[1:18:54] hear good you know words and a lot of
[1:18:56] that but i was convicted and when i
[1:18:58] leave i could say you know what
[1:18:59] i felt the presence of god in that
[1:19:01] meeting that's what we need to
[1:19:03] amen not just talk about but experience
[1:19:05] the presence of almighty god
[1:19:08] amen people can come in and feel the
[1:19:10] presence of god and
[1:19:11] no those people are praying people they
[1:19:14] walk out and say i don't understand what
[1:19:15] they believe but there's something
[1:19:16] different about those people
[1:19:18] hey man they've met god there's
[1:19:20] something that touches their hearts
[1:19:24] amen and amen god is a reality
[1:19:28] he said year the salt of the earth but
[1:19:30] if the salt has lost its savior
[1:19:32] wherewith shall it be salted it is
[1:19:34] henceforth good for nothing be cast out
[1:19:36] and to be trodden under foot
[1:19:37] then jesus said ye are the light of the
[1:19:39] world oh i thought he said he was yeah
[1:19:41] he said as long as i am in the world i
[1:19:43] am the light of the world but now he
[1:19:44] said you
[1:19:46] are the light of the world that old
[1:19:49] sunday school song
[1:19:50] this little light of mine i'm gonna let
[1:19:52] it shine hide it under a bush
[1:19:54] oh no i'm gonna let it shine somewhere
[1:19:56] we need to
[1:19:57] take the bush off the bushel and say
[1:19:59] lord let my light shine because jesus
[1:20:01] said i am the light of the world
[1:20:04] if some of you old-timers you get those
[1:20:06] cold those lamps we used to have them
[1:20:08] you
[1:20:08] and you have that little lamp you get it
[1:20:10] up we always turned it up to it i got
[1:20:12] all that smoke and then your
[1:20:13] thing got smokey sometimes people's
[1:20:17] testimony they get away from the lord
[1:20:18] and
[1:20:19] they're the the flames still there but
[1:20:21] it's just covered over with so many
[1:20:23] other things
[1:20:23] cares of the world and smoking you just
[1:20:26] have to take that
[1:20:27] you know what i'm talking about you take
[1:20:28] that globe off and you take it put it in
[1:20:30] the water and you clean it out you set
[1:20:32] it back there and then it shines that
[1:20:33] light again
[1:20:35] we need to come into the presence of the
[1:20:36] lord and say lord will you just cleanse
[1:20:38] me today
[1:20:39] let's listen that tape by the ramp said
[1:20:41] not unchristianized people we just need
[1:20:43] to come back and clean that globe back
[1:20:45] get back to our first works and our
[1:20:47] first love for the lord jesus where the
[1:20:49] very first thing
[1:20:50] jesus what is the greatest commandment
[1:20:52] love the lord with all of your heart
[1:20:54] with all of your soul with all your
[1:20:55] might and then love your neighbor just
[1:20:57] like yourself
[1:20:59] jesus said all the law and all the
[1:21:01] prophets and men are hung on these two
[1:21:03] commandments
[1:21:05] people get so caught up in the law of
[1:21:06] the message and this
[1:21:08] just forget about all that and just love
[1:21:10] the lord jesus
[1:21:11] just love him with all there was a man
[1:21:13] came to our church and
[1:21:15] he had a rough life and a lot of baggage
[1:21:17] and he come one time and like hey can i
[1:21:19] do voodoo and
[1:21:21] i'm like you know i don't know i do know
[1:21:24] but
[1:21:24] i don't know how to just get jesus in
[1:21:27] your heart
[1:21:28] and then let him tell you what's right
[1:21:29] and what's wrong that's the main thing
[1:21:31] we've got to get to christ
[1:21:33] i think i read it here before brother
[1:21:34] raymond said i'm afraid remember rising
[1:21:36] and suddenly said i'm afraid we're
[1:21:37] getting people to church
[1:21:39] we're getting them to a theory but we're
[1:21:40] not getting them to christ
[1:21:42] as a minister i want to get you to
[1:21:44] christ i want you to get to jesus christ
[1:21:48] you say what about the message brother
[1:21:50] daniel well the bible says i think it's
[1:21:51] what is it saint john john
[1:21:53] saint john 14 when he the spirit of
[1:21:54] truth has come he will lead you and he
[1:21:56] will guide you
[1:21:57] into all truth so you really get jesus
[1:22:00] he will guide you into the truth
[1:22:02] now when he begins to lead you into the
[1:22:04] truth and you're not willing to go into
[1:22:05] the truth you better go back and see
[1:22:07] make sure you've got the jesus of the
[1:22:08] bible
[1:22:10] how many understand what i'm saying we
[1:22:12] just fall in love with jesus
[1:22:14] we sing that little song let me fall in
[1:22:16] love with you all over again
[1:22:18] let me know you like never before we
[1:22:20] need to go back
[1:22:22] amen and do our first works over he said
[1:22:24] you are the light of the world a city
[1:22:25] that said on a hill cannot be hid
[1:22:27] neither do men light a candle and put it
[1:22:29] under a bushel but on a candlestick
[1:22:30] and they giveth light unto all in the
[1:22:33] house you say brother daniel it's dark
[1:22:35] outside
[1:22:35] it is dark outside but you know when a
[1:22:37] light shines the light the brightest
[1:22:39] it's when it's the darkest
[1:22:42] so maybe 50 years ago and there's a
[1:22:44] revival man it was just like
[1:22:46] every you know but now it's so dark you
[1:22:48] just shine a light and you let a sister
[1:22:50] walk into walmart with long hair and a
[1:22:52] modest dress like
[1:22:53] wow they just like from another planet
[1:22:56] yeah we're from another planet this
[1:22:58] world is not my home i'm just passing
[1:23:00] through
[1:23:01] i'm an ambassador for another kingdom
[1:23:03] that's why we dress different
[1:23:04] that's why we act different we're from a
[1:23:06] different kingdom
[1:23:08] we represent the kingdom of jesus christ
[1:23:10] don't ever try to fit in with this world
[1:23:12] you'll never do it and be a christian
[1:23:14] jesus said if you love me how do you say
[1:23:16] if the world hated me
[1:23:17] it'll hate you as well so the house the
[1:23:20] bible says be well
[1:23:21] beware when all men speak well of you as
[1:23:24] a minister when everybody speaks well of
[1:23:26] you and they're just high on good fellow
[1:23:27] then beware brother daniel beware when
[1:23:29] all men speak well of you
[1:23:30] amen because that's not what happened to
[1:23:32] jesus jesus
[1:23:34] got a temper he came in our church and
[1:23:35] flipped all the money tables over and
[1:23:36] flipped them all over and said you all
[1:23:38] are doing something contrary to the
[1:23:40] bible
[1:23:40] because the bible says my house shall be
[1:23:42] called a house of prayer
[1:23:43] oh he's got a temper they weren't
[1:23:46] speaking well of jesus
[1:23:48] christ john's out there with
[1:23:51] camel hair locus
[1:23:54] honey running down his beard he says
[1:23:57] repent
[1:23:58] bring forth fruits meet for repentance
[1:24:01] verse 16 let your light so shine before
[1:24:04] men that they may see your good works
[1:24:06] and glorify your father which is in
[1:24:08] heaven
[1:24:10] how we doing on time i made a vow to
[1:24:12] myself yesterday i'm going to try to
[1:24:14] preach shorter
[1:24:19] it's all relative you have to interpret
[1:24:22] that for me in the back rather than
[1:24:24] you know so i was just thinking about
[1:24:26] this because when we think of nighttime
[1:24:28] and jesus is saying
[1:24:30] i've got to work the works of him that
[1:24:32] sent me while it's day the night cometh
[1:24:33] when no man can work now in their day
[1:24:35] they're thinking okay we've got land
[1:24:37] lamps and we can only get out and dig
[1:24:38] this ditch or have my ox to pull the
[1:24:41] plow
[1:24:42] in the daytime and the night comes and
[1:24:44] then i can't work
[1:24:46] and as i begin to meditate on the night
[1:24:48] time and i begin to realize the night
[1:24:50] time is not necessarily
[1:24:52] darkness but it's inhibitions that that
[1:24:55] keep you from accomplishing what you're
[1:24:57] trying to accomplish
[1:24:59] i began to think about that because
[1:25:01] we've conquered
[1:25:03] the night time we have these lights and
[1:25:05] you can put up lights and you
[1:25:06] my son has a roofing company and so
[1:25:08] we've conquered we can bring lights out
[1:25:10] spotlights and do it
[1:25:11] but there's another darkness which is a
[1:25:13] handicap which says your neighbors don't
[1:25:15] want you hammering
[1:25:16] at four o'clock in the morning hammering
[1:25:18] with a power nailer on their roof
[1:25:22] how many understand what i'm saying i'm
[1:25:23] trying i'm saying that there's other
[1:25:25] handicaps that keep you
[1:25:26] which are then defined as that nighttime
[1:25:28] that darkness that keeps you from
[1:25:30] working so
[1:25:31] i might overcome the light and so but
[1:25:34] but there's other handicaps and
[1:25:36] ordinances in your town that says you
[1:25:37] can't do that
[1:25:38] we were walking through a subdivision my
[1:25:40] wife and i the other day and we were
[1:25:41] talking about how that we would probably
[1:25:42] get kicked out of the subdivision in the
[1:25:44] first
[1:25:45] couple of days with our boys because
[1:25:46] they're always banging or building or a
[1:25:48] go-kart or this or this and running
[1:25:50] through the neighbor's yard and
[1:25:51] they were you know so you see that
[1:25:54] there's other things that would
[1:25:56] begin to think about this and just kind
[1:25:58] of meditate on this i thought about this
[1:26:00] pandemic that has just come through
[1:26:02] and so we've been having churches and
[1:26:04] jesus is saying work
[1:26:06] while it's day the night is coming where
[1:26:08] you can't work
[1:26:09] i was thinking about this pandemic that
[1:26:11] i never saw that coming
[1:26:14] but now this darkness let me just say
[1:26:16] like this this darkness this
[1:26:17] circumstance has crossed our nation
[1:26:20] i guess it's more real up at brother
[1:26:22] biscuits church where they're not
[1:26:24] allowed to have church they can't have
[1:26:25] church there
[1:26:26] and isn't it ironic probably two or
[1:26:28] three hundred feet away they have a
[1:26:30] christian school that can be open
[1:26:32] but 300 feet away they have a church
[1:26:34] that cannot be opened
[1:26:36] by regulations of the government now let
[1:26:40] me read this verse again jesus said i
[1:26:41] must work the works of him that sent me
[1:26:42] while it's day
[1:26:43] the night comes the circumstances come
[1:26:46] when no man can work when what you have
[1:26:49] now
[1:26:50] and i just want to maybe jump ahead of
[1:26:51] myself what we think
[1:26:54] is is that we've enjoyed this pleasure
[1:26:56] of being together and going to church
[1:26:58] and that's we must work while it's day
[1:27:00] because there are circumstances that are
[1:27:02] coming when no man can work
[1:27:05] i just want to take a few minutes here
[1:27:06] and go through this with the government
[1:27:08] restrictions so
[1:27:09] one year ago a year in maybe january
[1:27:12] february
[1:27:13] this pandemic began to pass and i don't
[1:27:15] blame the the officials and everybody's
[1:27:17] trying when it first come out trying to
[1:27:18] figure out what is this and the mask and
[1:27:20] things and and but all of a sudden we
[1:27:22] saw regulations there was no flights
[1:27:24] you couldn't fly out to arizona you
[1:27:27] couldn't have any meetings it was
[1:27:29] shelter in place you had to stay in your
[1:27:30] home
[1:27:31] and you had to wear masks and and it was
[1:27:34] it was interesting i think even
[1:27:36] was it thanksgiving i forget where in
[1:27:37] canada you could only have your family
[1:27:39] and one other visitor come into your
[1:27:41] house
[1:27:42] and so now you see how that if god has
[1:27:44] given you a work to do on the earth
[1:27:46] how that the night circumstance come
[1:27:49] when you can't work
[1:27:51] so if we were had the circumstances of a
[1:27:53] year ago i wouldn't have been able to
[1:27:55] fly out here thursday and minister
[1:27:57] so the night time came and now the day
[1:28:01] the circumstances have been lifted again
[1:28:03] for a period of time we don't know
[1:28:06] and here i'm able to to to be here again
[1:28:09] but we don't know when that darkness
[1:28:11] will come again i hope you understand
[1:28:12] what i'm saying you see the
[1:28:13] circumstances that
[1:28:14] that would come and there's so many i
[1:28:16] would like to maybe we won't get through
[1:28:18] this this morning because we have a
[1:28:19] service tonight and so i don't have to
[1:28:21] preach at all this morning
[1:28:22] and you're like praise the lord we get
[1:28:24] shorter sermons
[1:28:26] but i thought about those things that
[1:28:28] you know how that they're saying that
[1:28:29] maybe even
[1:28:30] to fly you have to have a vaccination
[1:28:33] and maybe you feel like i don't want to
[1:28:34] have that vaccination for whatever
[1:28:35] reason to put a foreign substance in my
[1:28:37] body unless i have to i say okay that's
[1:28:39] fine but you're not going to be able to
[1:28:40] fly if you don't do that
[1:28:42] so then there would be a darkness that
[1:28:43] would uh freedom that would be taken and
[1:28:46] maybe we'll talk about some of them
[1:28:47] tonight maybe a health issue
[1:28:49] or or sickness or or old age or maybe a
[1:28:52] deep trial that you go through in your
[1:28:54] life that would cause you
[1:28:55] to not be able to work and maybe when i
[1:28:57] said that there's no hands but your
[1:28:59] hands and there's no voice but your
[1:29:01] voice and maybe
[1:29:02] the lord sparks something in your heart
[1:29:03] that you should do something for the
[1:29:05] lord and maybe that little something
[1:29:06] whatever he spoke to you then
[1:29:08] amen maybe you should write it down and
[1:29:09] say you know i'm going to do that
[1:29:12] because there may be darkness that would
[1:29:14] come in your life
[1:29:16] that you wouldn't be able to do that
[1:29:17] maybe you say you know what i'm going to
[1:29:18] go visit that sick person
[1:29:20] and then maybe there would be a car
[1:29:21] accident that would leave you in a state
[1:29:23] that you're not able to go visit that
[1:29:24] sick person
[1:29:26] the darkness would come and so today if
[1:29:29] you hear his voice don't harden your
[1:29:30] heart say lord i'm going to do that
[1:29:32] i know some of you are doing it some of
[1:29:34] you are sending cards and sending texts
[1:29:36] and
[1:29:37] i don't want to get ahead of myself but
[1:29:38] i want us to just see this darkness
[1:29:40] can come that no man can work i was
[1:29:43] listening to this message yesterday
[1:29:44] church order brother adam said
[1:29:46] and remember god is looking to me to see
[1:29:48] that i stay with the word he's
[1:29:50] he's the oversee of the church he's
[1:29:51] meeting with the brothers and he said
[1:29:53] i'm looking to you to see
[1:29:54] you carry out the word cc in this church
[1:29:57] and keep it spiritual
[1:29:59] that's a good thing isn't it keep it
[1:30:00] spiritual
[1:30:02] he said for remember all the forces of
[1:30:05] the dark kingdom of satan will be turned
[1:30:07] against you
[1:30:08] as you begin to grow in the lord
[1:30:13] so i love a prophet you know i
[1:30:16] i just love to be able to sit and hear a
[1:30:18] prophet and yesterday listening to it
[1:30:20] and i got a book and i'm just sitting
[1:30:21] down and i'm going to school and the
[1:30:23] prophet is sitting there talking to me
[1:30:24] and he's
[1:30:25] teaching me he's teaching he said now
[1:30:26] daniel i want you to know that
[1:30:29] all the forces of the darkness of the
[1:30:31] satan's kingdom will be turned against
[1:30:32] you when you start to grow
[1:30:34] in the lord and not only do i hear a
[1:30:36] prophet say it but now i experience it
[1:30:40] every day i get up and the devil went to
[1:30:42] bed around 11 or 12 whatever
[1:30:43] last night around four o'clock in the
[1:30:45] morning i wake up there and the holy
[1:30:47] spirit's dealing with me i can't sleep i
[1:30:48] got the
[1:30:49] service and the burden of the word you
[1:30:51] go back and read of it
[1:30:52] a preacher is not just somebody gets up
[1:30:54] and does an oration there's a burden
[1:30:56] of the word of the lord that comes to
[1:30:58] the person and they try to get away from
[1:31:00] it they can't get it's a burden
[1:31:02] for the souls of the people and so i'm
[1:31:04] there and the devil's right there to
[1:31:06] come so if you ever run out of
[1:31:07] you want to do something for the lord
[1:31:08] you can pray for brother daniel
[1:31:10] say i want to do something for the lord
[1:31:11] pray put me at the top of your prayer
[1:31:13] list well
[1:31:14] you tell me what it takes to get to the
[1:31:15] top of your prayer list and i'll try to
[1:31:17] do it because i want to be at the top i
[1:31:18] want to know people are praying
[1:31:19] and i know people that are streaming
[1:31:21] today all across the nation are praying
[1:31:22] for me and i thank god for it and
[1:31:24] sometimes i wonder when the devil
[1:31:26] comes so much against my mind i say lord
[1:31:28] how am i even standing
[1:31:30] how because he would love to just
[1:31:31] remember god jesus told peter he said
[1:31:34] satan has desired to have you he desires
[1:31:37] to have every one of you
[1:31:38] he desires to have you as young people
[1:31:40] he decides you have you as a grandmother
[1:31:42] like i just
[1:31:43] no satan said but jesus said i prayed
[1:31:46] for you
[1:31:47] that your faith would fail not oh
[1:31:49] blessed be the name of jesus i'm
[1:31:51] so glad he prayed for me and not only
[1:31:55] him but he has a voice in the earth of
[1:31:57] saints sons and daughters of god that
[1:31:59] are his voice on the earth
[1:32:01] that are praying for me why wouldn't it
[1:32:03] be good to have a prayer chain
[1:32:05] where the bible says pray ye one for
[1:32:07] another
[1:32:08] pray ye one for another
[1:32:11] oh what a supernatural power amen of
[1:32:15] prayer
[1:32:16] you can have experiences with god and
[1:32:18] just while i'm sitting here and i'm
[1:32:19] preaching i'm
[1:32:20] going back the last couple of weeks to
[1:32:22] places in in the motel
[1:32:24] and places uh there that the lord spoke
[1:32:27] to me in dealing with my heart we need
[1:32:29] experiences with god
[1:32:31] we need to meet god in a real way
[1:32:34] amen where god is supernaturally
[1:32:37] speaking to you
[1:32:38] he still has a voice god is a spirit and
[1:32:40] he speaks in a spiritual realm
[1:32:42] amen he had to have dealt with you or
[1:32:44] you wouldn't be here today
[1:32:46] something woke you up this morning
[1:32:49] sister and said why don't you go to the
[1:32:50] house to the lord
[1:32:51] i say we say that was jesus christ
[1:32:54] there's only two forces in the world we

[1:32:59] dealing with your heart

[1:33:28] real
[1:33:29] and he'll be there amen i've told this
[1:33:33] story i'm going to tell it again
[1:33:34] amen we left that brother russ wallace's
[1:33:37] and we were going down the road brother
[1:33:39] ted passed lee's i think he had the
[1:33:40] funeral here just a couple of weeks ago
[1:33:42] i was streaming the service there
[1:33:44] i appreciate brother ted and sister
[1:33:45] murder the wonderful people
[1:33:47] servants of the lord we were getting out
[1:33:49] of church and going down and there was
[1:33:51] two i didn't know i thought it was a
[1:33:53] semi in the middle of the road we were
[1:33:54] there and
[1:33:55] we just pulled off the road and i got
[1:33:56] out and ran up there and i realized two
[1:33:57] vehicles
[1:33:58] this is for somebody today and i went up
[1:34:02] and there were two vehicles a ford f-150
[1:34:04] silver truck is on its side
[1:34:06] another vehicle there and i get up there
[1:34:07] brother zach wallace is there and he's
[1:34:10] running out trying to see if this is the
[1:34:11] people from the church
[1:34:13] we had lingered fellowshipping a little
[1:34:14] bit in the in the
[1:34:16] parking lot and then we run up there the
[1:34:19] people are still hanging in their seat
[1:34:20] belts
[1:34:21] in this in the car and and
[1:34:25] and we just didn't know if it was the
[1:34:26] people from the church and we just went
[1:34:27] up there and said like no that one's
[1:34:29] passed away this one's
[1:34:31] a little bit of a pulse but we don't
[1:34:33] know and i just realized it wasn't the
[1:34:35] people from the church they called the
[1:34:37] paramedics brother jeremy i'm not a
[1:34:38] paramedic so i stay in my lane
[1:34:40] somebody more qualified will take you
[1:34:42] know they were there to help but then
[1:34:43] they came and they were taken
[1:34:45] but i'm walking back to my car and the
[1:34:46] holy spirit said what if they had been
[1:34:48] from your church
[1:34:49] and what if you didn't give a call and
[1:34:51] give them a chance to
[1:34:53] surrender their life to god and didn't
[1:34:55] have a
[1:34:56] didn't challenge them to put their sins
[1:34:58] underneath the blood of jesus
[1:35:00] christ and be forgiven and now they're
[1:35:01] hanging in their seat belt and where
[1:35:03] about you daniel
[1:35:04] what about you why didn't you preach the
[1:35:06] gospel this is the holy spirit preaching
[1:35:08] to me
[1:35:09] his holy spirit preaching to me and say
[1:35:10] daniel did you just preach nice flowery
[1:35:12] words
[1:35:13] do you know daniel you're going to have
[1:35:14] to stand before the judgment seat of god
[1:35:17] one day and give an account for the
[1:35:18] opportunity that you had in my house
[1:35:20] and you didn't challenge people to take
[1:35:22] their sins and put them under the blood
[1:35:23] of jesus christ and because the holy
[1:35:25] spirit
[1:35:26] is training and he's tutoring and he's
[1:35:28] whipping me brother aaron i've never
[1:35:29] tried to always have that opportunity at
[1:35:31] the end of a service that someone could
[1:35:33] surrender their life to jesus christ
[1:35:35] because there is a fountain filled with
[1:35:37] blood drawing from emmanuel's veins and
[1:35:40] sinners plunged beneath that flood they
[1:35:42] lose all of their guilty stains aren't
[1:35:44] you thankful for that
[1:35:46] fountain filled with blood and i believe
[1:35:48] it's still efficacious this morning i
[1:35:50] believe that fountain is still there
[1:35:52] because there's something the holy
[1:35:53] spirit in my spirit is is
[1:35:55] crying out come to the fountain come to
[1:35:58] the fountain
[1:35:59] there'll be a day there'll be no more
[1:36:00] mercy but this isn't that day
[1:36:02] this is the day god is calling there is
[1:36:04] mercy there's room
[1:36:06] at the cross for you was it billy
[1:36:08] graham's greatest son there's room at
[1:36:10] the cross for you
[1:36:11] there's room at the cross for you though
[1:36:14] millions have come
[1:36:16] there's still room for one there's room
[1:36:18] at the cross for you
[1:36:21] i need that cross i need that cross
[1:36:26] blessed be the name of the lord amen so
[1:36:29] brother adam goes on to say
[1:36:31] and satan will try he said he will come
[1:36:33] among you and cause you to sp
[1:36:35] dispute with one another if he can turn
[1:36:38] him down
[1:36:39] just immediately your brethren that's
[1:36:41] the enemy
[1:36:42] and we're here to hold a standard in
[1:36:43] this evening light time that
[1:36:46] when the world listen to this here when
[1:36:48] the world is darkened
[1:36:49] and the whole church kingdom is going
[1:36:51] into the council of churches
[1:36:54] and pretty soon they'll try listen to
[1:36:56] this they'll try to tack a sign on this
[1:36:59] door here
[1:36:59] closed and then we're going to have to
[1:37:03] meet
[1:37:03] other places because they'll certainly
[1:37:05] close these churches one of these days
[1:37:08] if we don't take the mark of the beast
[1:37:11] it's a prophet he's prophesying they
[1:37:14] certainly tried to close the doors
[1:37:16] i know back in our state they're trying
[1:37:18] to close and close it in canada they
[1:37:20] already
[1:37:21] the school can be open but the church
[1:37:22] can't be opened isn't that
[1:37:24] discrimination the bars are open and the
[1:37:26] casinos are open but the church can't be
[1:37:28] open
[1:37:28] you see what the devil is doing he's got
[1:37:30] a scheme i don't know what the virus
[1:37:32] whatever it is at the end of the day one
[1:37:34] year later what has it accomplished
[1:37:36] churches cannot be open you see how the
[1:37:39] devil he's got a plan he knows what he's
[1:37:41] doing
[1:37:41] the bible says forsake not the
[1:37:43] assembling of ourselves together we
[1:37:44] don't know how it's going to happen we
[1:37:45] might have to meet down at the soccer
[1:37:47] field and we're
[1:37:48] oh yeah they're all huddling down there
[1:37:49] we're praying in jesus name god
[1:37:51] strengthen us heal our bodies and
[1:37:53] deliver us

[1:38:04] flower they're all down on their knees
[1:38:07] those people are praying in aisle five
[1:38:11] we laugh about it work while it's day
[1:38:13] the night cometh when no man can work
[1:38:16] but you'll never destroy the church of
[1:38:17] god amen jesus said i'm going to build
[1:38:20] my church and the gates of hell will
[1:38:22] never prevail against it
[1:38:24] amen a little persecution causes the
[1:38:26] church to become
[1:38:27] stronger those that have faith in christ
[1:38:30] they become strong in the lord
[1:38:32] that's where the paul i believe as paul
[1:38:33] said be strong in the lord and in the
[1:38:35] power of his might
[1:38:37] you know the book of acts the brother is
[1:38:38] talking about the book of acts it wasn't
[1:38:40] all miracles and signs and wonders they
[1:38:42] took paul in and they stoned him
[1:38:44] and they threw him outside of the city
[1:38:46] and there was no disciples there he just
[1:38:47] picked up a rock
[1:38:48] picked up another rock picked up another
[1:38:51] rock pushed the rocks up and got up
[1:38:53] that's the book of ass oh i don't want
[1:38:54] that book of acts i just want to
[1:38:56] see the lame man get up and run around
[1:38:57] no it wasn't that way
[1:38:59] amen there was a lot of persecution that
[1:39:01] happened there here's peter throwing in
[1:39:03] prison here's paul amen they're in this
[1:39:04] in the jail with paul and silas and they
[1:39:06] had beat those people
[1:39:09] they had beat them and they're flogging
[1:39:11] them and they're sitting there i don't
[1:39:12] know the stocks
[1:39:13] brothers brother um you know brother
[1:39:16] probably been to israel and
[1:39:17] over there i've never been over there
[1:39:19] and now they've got them in stocks
[1:39:20] you've seen they're sitting like this
[1:39:21] and
[1:39:22] they look at each other what else we
[1:39:24] gonna do
[1:39:25] they started singing the praises of
[1:39:27] almighty god
[1:39:28] hey man and god came right down among
[1:39:30] them the doors and windows started
[1:39:32] shaking their stocks broke loose
[1:39:34] amen we need god to come among us a
[1:39:36] little bit amen take a little beating
[1:39:38] for the gospel's sake
[1:39:40] some of us get so soft and hampered and
[1:39:42] we get a little offended we want to run
[1:39:43] off somewhere hey man we're about to
[1:39:45] the recognition with our brothers and
[1:39:47] sisters that were burned at the stake
[1:39:48] and torn apart by
[1:39:50] lions and my feelings are no and they
[1:39:52] tore johnny apart and he killed
[1:39:54] sally for their testimony in jesus
[1:39:56] christ
[1:39:57] we need strong rugged christians and the
[1:40:00] bible says and they love not their lives
[1:40:02] even unto death
[1:40:04] oh i want to love the lord jesus i want
[1:40:06] to have something of a revelation
[1:40:08] down in my heart though it might might
[1:40:09] cost my life that i
[1:40:11] i know in whom i have believed amen you
[1:40:13] need to have that in your own self and
[1:40:15] you know that you've tried to walk this
[1:40:16] life or maybe you tried to do
[1:40:18] reformation you tried to be a good
[1:40:19] person you realize
[1:40:21] that you couldn't be a good person
[1:40:24] we have an old nature and it's strong
[1:40:26] especially we men we're just
[1:40:28] and you realize i can't do this without
[1:40:30] christ
[1:40:31] and you need to have an experience with
[1:40:32] god and god breaks that old man and he
[1:40:34] breaks him down paul said i can do all
[1:40:37] things through christ who strengthens me
[1:40:40] and then you mothers would say yeah
[1:40:41] that's what my husband needs that's what
[1:40:43] he needs he needs to meet jesus christ
[1:40:46] reformation will never work i tried to
[1:40:48] do a gp i write it on my hand
[1:40:50] gp is a teenager gp go pray it took
[1:40:53] something
[1:40:53] stronger than a tattoo on my hand or a
[1:40:55] little it takes an experience with god
[1:40:58] to break that nature
[1:41:01] brother ram said he goes on to say and
[1:41:02] we're depending on staying true to god
[1:41:04] until death sets it's free and that's
[1:41:06] what we intend to do that's what i
[1:41:08] intend to do so i was thinking about
[1:41:10] that at night cometh when no man can
[1:41:12] work i say we need to keep working for
[1:41:14] the lord
[1:41:15] we need to keep preaching we need to
[1:41:16] keep singing we need to keep teaching
[1:41:18] sunday school we need to
[1:41:19] keep meeting together amen preaching the
[1:41:21] gospel repent
[1:41:22] be baptized in the name of jesus christ
[1:41:24] we need to keep baptizing people in the
[1:41:26] water
[1:41:27] amen let them get filled with the holy
[1:41:29] ghost it's more than being baptized
[1:41:30] there's an experience of the baptism of
[1:41:32] the holy spirit and the fire of god that
[1:41:33] will burn every
[1:41:34] every sin and every desire out of your
[1:41:36] life amen we just need to go
[1:41:38] deep in christ amen i was thinking was
[1:41:40] it
[1:41:41] when we were here the last time it was
[1:41:42] friday night when we were going out of
[1:41:44] the service my brother john preached
[1:41:45] when i was there
[1:41:46] the people were going out sister hosanna
[1:41:48] was over there on her knees with their
[1:41:49] hands raised and
[1:41:50] god was doing something in her life amen
[1:41:52] it's just not oh
[1:41:53] have an experience that's continually
[1:41:55] going on and have an experience after
[1:41:57] experience after experience with
[1:41:58] almighty god great men did it in the
[1:42:00] bible
[1:42:01] amen there's just not abraham god spoke
[1:42:03] to him said get out of this land but he
[1:42:04] went he built altars jacob look at
[1:42:06] all those mighty men they had experience
[1:42:08] after experience after experience with
[1:42:10] god
[1:42:10] we see people like yeah i received the
[1:42:12] holy spirit 20 years ago it's more than
[1:42:14] 20 years ago remember the man i had to
[1:42:16] fall every day
[1:42:17] a fresh experience with god that's what
[1:42:19] happened sometimes we try to keep our
[1:42:21] experience from yesterday to today
[1:42:23] we need a fresh experience with almighty
[1:42:24] god we need to be renewed the bible says
[1:42:27] be renewed in the holy ghost
[1:42:32] we never know when this will be ended
[1:42:36] you know as time goes on we see a
[1:42:37] prophet is prophesying and we think it
[1:42:39] means one thing
[1:42:40] i'll just say this brother ram said
[1:42:41] science and education is the worst enemy
[1:42:43] the gospel ever had
[1:42:44] we thought it was reading and writing
[1:42:46] arithmetic and we realized now the cell
[1:42:48] phone science and education
[1:42:50] is the worst enemy brotherhood said it's
[1:42:52] made the church of god a bunch of
[1:42:54] ragweeds
[1:42:55] just a bunch of common people that
[1:42:57] should be the salt of the earth laying
[1:42:58] their hands on the sick
[1:42:59] the power of the holy spirit casting out
[1:43:01] devils testifying for god and now
[1:43:03] they're just sitting holding the phone
[1:43:05] playing some game frivolous mindless
[1:43:09] game and a waste of time
[1:43:10] and jesus said hey you're my witness
[1:43:13] you're my witness what are you doing
[1:43:15] may it challenge it challenges me i'm
[1:43:16] not preaching i'm preaching to brother
[1:43:17] daniel now
[1:43:18] lord i must be about my father's
[1:43:20] business at 12 years old let it
[1:43:21] challenge us
[1:43:22] as christians we don't just come to
[1:43:23] church to hear a nice flower he said but
[1:43:25] lord let it challenge me today lord let
[1:43:27] me be about my father's business don't
[1:43:29] let me how's the bible say redeem the
[1:43:31] time
[1:43:32] not waste the time redeem the time
[1:43:36] and so i thought about that how brother
[1:43:37] em said that science and education
[1:43:39] now we can see what he was saying is
[1:43:40] being fulfilled he's a prophet he's
[1:43:42] prophesy
[1:43:43] so there's things that he would say like
[1:43:44] oh that means that listen to this
[1:43:46] brother iran said i was thinking as i
[1:43:48] was down there driving down the road a
[1:43:49] while ago being out for a little prayer
[1:43:51] just before entering the pulpit as any
[1:43:53] real sincere
[1:43:54] clergyman does so now he's telling us
[1:43:57] what a real preacher is a clergyman
[1:43:59] man that spends time in prayer not out
[1:44:01] running around all the time in this
[1:44:03] he's a man that's in prayer and he said
[1:44:06] i was thinking you know we're having
[1:44:08] some of the most glorious time
[1:44:09] when we meet here he said but the people
[1:44:12] gathering from many states
[1:44:13] sitting right here now and from all the
[1:44:15] way hundreds and hundreds of miles and
[1:44:17] we've assembled together to fellowship
[1:44:18] around the world
[1:44:20] word he said but there will come a time
[1:44:22] soon when this will just be a fond
[1:44:24] memory
[1:44:26] that's right and i always thought it was
[1:44:28] brother branham having meetings at the
[1:44:30] branham tabernacle because i was a
[1:44:31] member there and then wow
[1:44:32] we play the same tapes and it's a fond
[1:44:34] memory brother ram's there and they're
[1:44:35] standing up my father-in-law said you
[1:44:36] had to come early standing along the
[1:44:38] wall and yes that is a fond memory
[1:44:41] but now brother bam said and these times
[1:44:43] will be taken away from us so therefore
[1:44:45] we must do all
[1:44:46] that we know to do know how to do and
[1:44:48] make this
[1:44:49] every minute counts
[1:44:52] so yes that is a fond memory but what
[1:44:54] about what we're experiencing today is a
[1:44:56] fond memory
[1:44:58] some of you go back 50 years when this
[1:45:00] church was full of people and
[1:45:02] mine just such a revival and a wonderful
[1:45:04] thing
[1:45:05] fond memory and now we're sitting here
[1:45:08] could it be a prophecy that
[1:45:09] one day they will tack something on the
[1:45:11] door and you're like
[1:45:12] you know what i remember the time when i
[1:45:15] could go put a little piece of paper
[1:45:17] into the church
[1:45:17] and if god put a song in my heart i
[1:45:19] could sing a special in front of the
[1:45:20] church
[1:45:21] i remember the time when we could stand
[1:45:23] publicly and open our bibles and read
[1:45:25] our bibles
[1:45:26] and have the freedom of religion what a
[1:45:29] fond memory that was
[1:45:31] i remember brother jordan could come out
[1:45:33] and we could have a public address
[1:45:34] system and we could sing
[1:45:35] christian songs publicly just a fond
[1:45:39] memory
[1:45:40] jesus said work while it's day the night
[1:45:42] comes when no man can work
[1:45:44] oh brother daniel couldn't happen in
[1:45:45] tucson it did a year ago
[1:45:47] they did a year ago said you don't learn
[1:45:49] heaven church you're shutting down it's
[1:45:50] still that way in canada you all can't
[1:45:52] have a church
[1:45:54] the night cometh when no man can work i
[1:45:56] say we take what the prophet said let's
[1:45:58] let make
[1:45:58] every amen minute count let's let make
[1:46:01] every service count for the lord jesus
[1:46:04] amen because we never know when we won't
[1:46:06] be able to have these opportunities
[1:46:08] i was thinking of my brother john and i
[1:46:09] know many people are doing around
[1:46:11] the the world and and doing things for
[1:46:13] the lord i was just thinking of my
[1:46:14] brother john he's
[1:46:15] he was here yesterday he was having a
[1:46:17] revival i think this whole weekend
[1:46:18] they're having a revival
[1:46:20] i don't even know what the the country
[1:46:22] is where they're they're hosting the
[1:46:23] revival but they had they were doing an
[1:46:25] online revival they had 50 countries
[1:46:28] people logged in a thousand people
[1:46:30] logged in virtually to my brother john
[1:46:32] uh preaching the gospel and and
[1:46:34] ministering like wow that is just
[1:46:36] amazing i said brother john just keep
[1:46:37] preaching the
[1:46:38] gospel all around the world my my nephew
[1:46:41] timothy
[1:46:42] was he was he they patched me into a
[1:46:44] link he's preaching to the people in
[1:46:46] pakistan through a translator in a zoom
[1:46:48] meeting
[1:46:48] i mean why because sometimes they can't
[1:46:50] meet up in canada but
[1:46:52] there's a little outlet that just a
[1:46:53] little window that you can say oh yeah
[1:46:55] that's really neat they can do that zoom
[1:46:56] but what about
[1:46:57] when they shut that down oh that could
[1:47:00] never happen they shut your president
[1:47:01] down
[1:47:03] they shut your president down said you
[1:47:04] can't be on social media twitter or
[1:47:06] whatever those
[1:47:07] social media my son william posted a
[1:47:09] verse on facebook
[1:47:10] and they they they banned him said oh
[1:47:12] you can't do that
[1:47:14] so we see brother ben kept using the
[1:47:16] word boycott boycott boycott they'll
[1:47:18] boycate
[1:47:19] boycott you they'll boycott you and when
[1:47:20] they boycott the bible from social media
[1:47:24] and twitter and facebook and youtube and
[1:47:25] you can no longer preach we have the
[1:47:27] freedom today we're streaming and using
[1:47:28] the vehicle brother
[1:47:29] jordan the different brothers are in the
[1:47:31] audio video we're streaming on youtube
[1:47:32] but what about when they say hey that's
[1:47:34] christianity you're preaching
[1:47:36] against sin and what we call alternative
[1:47:38] lifestyles
[1:47:39] you can't preach against that
[1:47:42] well hey i'd have to tell a couple of
[1:47:45] verses out of my bibles we'd have to
[1:47:46] tear go back to genesis we'd have to
[1:47:47] tell romans 1
[1:47:49] we have to tear jude out all these
[1:47:50] things are written for examples that's
[1:47:52] an accelerant that brings the wrath of
[1:47:54] god down on you
[1:47:55] i'm sorry hey they're going to ban you
[1:47:56] well they're going to have to ban us
[1:47:57] because we have to preach the word of
[1:47:59] god
[1:48:00] so what we see is day work while it's
[1:48:03] day do
[1:48:03] something for god because the night is
[1:48:05] coming when they may ban you from all of
[1:48:08] that
[1:48:10] when they banned this message from being
[1:48:12] publicly distributed
[1:48:16] could they do it absolutely pull a
[1:48:17] couple quotes out of context of brother
[1:48:19] ranum
[1:48:20] call him a racist and call him these
[1:48:21] things and call him national security
[1:48:23] when he says russia is
[1:48:24] raised up to destroy america and that's
[1:48:26] a threat and and they start doing these
[1:48:28] things
[1:48:29] my what would they have done to jesus
[1:48:30] christ well i tell you we know what they
[1:48:33] did to all of them i think isaiah they
[1:48:34] saw him asunder and they
[1:48:35] burn them at the stake amen i think john
[1:48:38] the revelator they put him in a vat and
[1:48:39] tried to burn him and try to
[1:48:41] try to boil it out of him but there's
[1:48:42] something about this holy ghost
[1:48:44] amen you can't boil it out of a
[1:48:46] christian amen
[1:48:47] amen when the persecution comes or
[1:48:49] something inside of them it becomes
[1:48:50] stronger
[1:48:52] and i was thinking about that just as we
[1:48:54] come down to a close i was thinking
[1:48:56] romans chapter 15 verse 1. what do i do
[1:48:59] in these times brother daniel
[1:49:01] romans chapter 15 verse 1. the bible
[1:49:04] says
[1:49:06] we then that are strong
[1:49:09] ought to make a million dollars and all
[1:49:11] retire in the bahamas
[1:49:13] and just live our own lives the best way
[1:49:16] that we want to
[1:49:18] is that what your bible says no
[1:49:22] we then that are strong ought to bear
[1:49:24] the infirmities of the weak
[1:49:27] all those people are just a bunch of
[1:49:28] uneducated people and they're just poor
[1:49:30] people god loves poor people
[1:49:32] he made so many of them and you're like
[1:49:35] oh i'm
[1:49:36] i'm educated i've got all these towns
[1:49:37] just forget all those people
[1:49:39] can you be the bride and think like that
[1:49:41] i don't know it's not what the bible
[1:49:43] says
[1:49:44] remember the bible to be the bride you
[1:49:47] have to live by every word
[1:49:48] so when the scripture says we then that
[1:49:50] are strong ought to bear the infirmities
[1:49:52] of the weak and
[1:49:53] not please ourselves let every one of us
[1:49:56] please his own neighbor for his good to
[1:49:58] the edification even so christ pleased
[1:50:00] not himself
[1:50:02] but as it is written the reproach of
[1:50:03] them that reproached thee
[1:50:05] fell on me tell you what i want to stand
[1:50:08] with god's people
[1:50:11] i want i'm not ashamed to be identified
[1:50:13] with the bride of jesus christ and the
[1:50:15] message of the hour
[1:50:17] paul said in the way that's called
[1:50:18] heresy is the way that i worship the god
[1:50:20] of our fathers
[1:50:21] i'm not ashamed to believe that jesus
[1:50:23] christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:50:25] forever
[1:50:26] i'm not ashamed to be identified with
[1:50:28] people that believe in holiness and long
[1:50:30] hair and modest apparel i'm not ashamed
[1:50:32] to be with
[1:50:32] but uh believe amen be identified with
[1:50:35] people that are
[1:50:35] acts book of acts believers and believe
[1:50:37] that they shall lay hands on the sick
[1:50:39] and they shall recover to speak in dongs
[1:50:41] and cast out devils
[1:50:42] because it's the bible i want to be
[1:50:43] identified with those people
[1:50:46] second corinthians chapter 15. i had
[1:50:50] marked a couple verses down i didn't
[1:50:51] want to be long
[1:50:52] because we have another service tonight
[1:50:56] and i want to go through some other dark
[1:50:58] times tonight
[1:50:59] that people go through in their life
[1:51:01] sometimes our health
[1:51:03] you heard my father-in-law said that one
[1:51:04] time he said you know as daniel he said
[1:51:06] there's one thing i never counted on in
[1:51:08] in life that was old age i just thought
[1:51:11] i'd be strong i'd be healthy i'd do that
[1:51:13] you know just
[1:51:14] and he told me something he said daniel
[1:51:15] if you're ever going to do anything
[1:51:17] in life do it while you're young
[1:51:20] and now as i get older i realize
[1:51:21] sometimes my memory and
[1:51:23] things i don't have like that i tell you
[1:51:25] we ought to do all that we can
[1:51:27] while we can today some people have that
[1:51:31] they're procrastinating why put off to
[1:51:32] tomorrow which you can do the day
[1:51:34] after tomorrow what
[1:51:37] why put off to tomorrow which you can do
[1:51:38] today
[1:51:41] we can do something today and jesus is
[1:51:42] telling work while it's day daniel
[1:51:44] there's a time coming
[1:51:45] where you may not be able to stand
[1:51:47] publicly and preach the gospel you may
[1:51:48] not even be able to stream youtube you
[1:51:50] may not even
[1:51:51] be able to send a whatsapp thing out
[1:51:52] from that church because that church is
[1:51:54] identified with those
[1:51:55] holy ghost-filled christian people work
[1:51:57] while it's day
[1:51:59] he goes on ii corinthians chapter 5
[1:52:02] verse 15
[1:52:04] and that he died for all that they which
[1:52:06] lived should not
[1:52:08] henceforth live unto themselves but unto
[1:52:11] him which
[1:52:11] died for them and rose again
[1:52:15] amen may god help us to not live for
[1:52:17] ourselves
[1:52:19] amen but live for him who died for us
[1:52:22] you know i believe there's a people that
[1:52:24] are willing to work just like the book
[1:52:25] of acts there was a man called stephen
[1:52:26] he was just a
[1:52:27] he was a deacon and then they come out
[1:52:29] and he preached the gospel and the bible
[1:52:31] says they
[1:52:31] gnashed on him with their teeth and it's
[1:52:34] so amazing
[1:52:35] you see man here's christ at calvary
[1:52:37] said father forgive them they know not
[1:52:38] what they do
[1:52:39] and just a few years months later here's
[1:52:42] stephen
[1:52:42] giving his life they're stoning him he
[1:52:44] said father lay not this sin to their
[1:52:46] charge
[1:52:47] and the life that was in christ is now
[1:52:50] inside of stephen he's being stoned
[1:52:52] oh we like the book of acts man angel
[1:52:54] came put a shout a force field around
[1:52:56] him he just walked out there and the
[1:52:57] rocks just bounced off
[1:52:58] no he gave his life and he was
[1:53:00] manifesting the life of christ by saying
[1:53:02] father lay not this sin to their charge
[1:53:05] and it was the greatest man
[1:53:07] a great manifestation that the life that
[1:53:08] was in christ now is inside of this
[1:53:10] believer
[1:53:11] i don't know what we're going to have to
[1:53:12] go through but i know one thing i want
[1:53:14] the life that was in christ to be inside
[1:53:16] of me
[1:53:17] when the bible says that he prayed
[1:53:18] earnestly i want to be someone that's
[1:53:20] praying earnestly
[1:53:21] when the bible says paul was pressed in
[1:53:23] the spirit i want to be one that can be
[1:53:25] pressed in the spirit i i want to be one
[1:53:27] the bible is reading there
[1:53:28] was it acts 13 the bible says when they
[1:53:31] fasted and prayed the holy spirit spake
[1:53:33] to them
[1:53:33] and said separate to me paul and
[1:53:36] barnabas
[1:53:37] and the holy spirit is speaking i want
[1:53:38] to be a part of a church like that where
[1:53:40] the holy spirit can speak and we can be
[1:53:42] moved by the holy ghost and we come and
[1:53:44] we pray and we wait on the lord and the
[1:53:46] lord says
[1:53:47] do this and move over here and do this i
[1:53:50] want to be a part of that church some
[1:53:51] people don't want a part of that they
[1:53:52] don't want anything to do with that
[1:53:53] because he starts digging down into
[1:53:55] their personal life and going brother
[1:53:56] man preaches a message called the door
[1:53:59] doors and a door and he goes through and
[1:54:02] he said one is pride
[1:54:04] one is this one is your financial don't
[1:54:06] go in there lord and
[1:54:07] you you welcome but don't go in there
[1:54:09] another one he said is your private life
[1:54:12] we're like lock deadbolt combination
[1:54:15] and you're not going into my private
[1:54:18] life
[1:54:19] but the bible says he already sees all
[1:54:21] how was it david said if you
[1:54:22] i go to the bottom of the sea they're
[1:54:24] there if i go to heaven you're there
[1:54:25] wherever i go lord you're there he
[1:54:27] already knows so we're better off saying
[1:54:29] lord
[1:54:30] here i am maybe something you're like i
[1:54:32] don't like this
[1:54:33] just be say lord you know i don't like
[1:54:35] that sister i pray you would help me
[1:54:37] and make me what i ought to be to love
[1:54:40] my enemies and jesus sister been
[1:54:42] baptized in jesus name and loves the
[1:54:43] lord we take communion together
[1:54:45] lord help me lord help us lord jesus
[1:54:49] amen i was thinking about that just as a
[1:54:51] word of encouragement what could we do
[1:54:53] for the lord
[1:54:54] what about texting these fine elders
[1:54:57] most of us
[1:54:58] i know kids like i think with ours is
[1:55:01] like 16 like okay
[1:55:02] when i when you're driving i don't know
[1:55:04] where you are then maybe a phone
[1:55:05] but now it's like at 12 years old 14
[1:55:09] years old
[1:55:09] i gotta have a phone i gotta you know
[1:55:13] and i'd tell them i said all right
[1:55:15] either parent you instruct them
[1:55:17] about the dangers of pornography or i as
[1:55:19] the youth leader are going to have to
[1:55:20] deal with it
[1:55:22] it's really quiet in here but i'd never
[1:55:25] take a gun and load it up hand it to a
[1:55:26] 12 year old like here you go have a good
[1:55:28] day
[1:55:29] be quiet with that i'm working just sit
[1:55:31] anybody would take a cell phone and hand
[1:55:33] it to a child there's more power
[1:55:34] computing power on that phone than the
[1:55:36] original space capsule that went to the
[1:55:39] moon and you hand it to a child and
[1:55:40] power without character is satanic and
[1:55:43] you give that to a teenager with no
[1:55:44] guidance and no instruction
[1:55:46] just be prepared just be prepared
[1:55:52] and there was i walked up to a teenager
[1:55:56] this week said hey i heard you got a
[1:55:57] cell phone and i'm concerned about it
[1:56:00] even the young girls well that's
[1:56:03] pretty intrusive in people's personal
[1:56:04] life yeah but there's a real devil out
[1:56:06] there
[1:56:07] trying to destroy people's lives as we
[1:56:09] said one time i'd rather my son be in a
[1:56:11] room with a loaded gun than sitting in a
[1:56:13] room with un
[1:56:13] how could i say unattended internet
[1:56:16] access
[1:56:17] where they can go places in their mind
[1:56:18] and leave scott listen to me leave
[1:56:20] scars in their mind that they'll never
[1:56:22] be able to get rid of
[1:56:25] when they see that and i didn't know my
[1:56:27] goodness and it scars that little
[1:56:29] because the internet has taken away all
[1:56:30] innocency
[1:56:32] that little child is in it this is kind
[1:56:34] of pastoral but it's the truth
[1:56:36] that little age where they're little
[1:56:38] kids at 10 years old and all of a sudden
[1:56:39] they go from 10 to 18
[1:56:41] that quick and their innocence of like
[1:56:43] little playing with dollies and
[1:56:44] paper dolls in him and all of it's gone
[1:56:46] like wow what happened the internet came
[1:56:48] in may god help us amen to say burn

[2:12:05] time and frivolous nonsense of the world
[2:12:07] let's have a purpose
[2:12:09] let's have a purpose i was thinking i
[2:12:12] had it i just stuck it in my notes there
[2:12:14] yesterday
[2:12:16] brother ram talked about the psalm of
[2:12:18] life he said tell me not in
[2:12:21] mournful numbers life is but an empty
[2:12:23] dream
[2:12:24] the soul is dead that slumbers and
[2:12:26] things are not what they seem
[2:12:28] life is real life is earnest and the
[2:12:31] grave is not his goal dost thou art to
[2:12:34] dust return us was not spoken
[2:12:37] of the soul lives of great men all
[2:12:40] remind us
[2:12:42] we can make our lives sublime
[2:12:45] and departing leave behind us
[2:12:49] footprints on the sands of time
[2:12:53] footprints that perhaps another sailing
[2:12:56] or
[2:12:56] life solemn maine a forlorn ship left
[2:12:59] brethren seeing shall take heart again
[2:13:03] let us then be up and doing jesus at 12
[2:13:06] years old we
[2:13:07] i'm smart well jesus was doing it at 12
[2:13:09] surely we
[2:13:11] 25 35 45
[2:13:14] 55 65 with all that knowledge
[2:13:18] let us then be up and doing with a heart
[2:13:20] for any fate
[2:13:22] still achieve still achieving still
[2:13:24] pursuing learn to labor
[2:13:26] learn to wait that was long longfellow's
[2:13:29] psalm of life
[2:13:30] let it challenge us today lord let me do
[2:13:32] more for your kingdom
[2:13:34] let me do what i can for the kingdom of
[2:13:36] god
[2:13:37] i think there's a verse in the bible my
[2:13:38] wife tells me that what she wants on her
[2:13:40] gravestone
[2:13:41] i am getting old we are getting all
[2:13:43] that's what i wanted my tim's up
[2:13:44] she did what she could she did what she
[2:13:47] could
[2:13:49] i want to do all that i can for the
[2:13:50] kingdom of god some of you do it some of
[2:13:53] your labor and i hear about like this
[2:13:54] one's doing this and they're
[2:13:55] sending a card they're sending a text
[2:13:56] and brother aaron labor and working and
[2:13:58] brother arnie and brother
[2:14:00] jordan and brother brother ed and
[2:14:02] they're doing and maybe there but each
[2:14:03] one of us
[2:14:04] have something that we can do for the
[2:14:05] kingdom of god and oh brother
[2:14:07] john has labored for years and years and
[2:14:09] years out in the east and
[2:14:10] started with a brother testifying i
[2:14:12] think to your brother wasn't it jerry
[2:14:13] that was in the military terror
[2:14:15] and he went back to a family reunion and
[2:14:16] they knew jerry and his temper and all
[2:14:18] that he was
[2:14:18] and and he was such a changed man like
[2:14:21] what happened to you
[2:14:23] what happened to you somebody testified
[2:14:26] to him
[2:14:26] and i haven't even met his brother as
[2:14:28] far as i know but his testimony his
[2:14:30] life is speaking to me today and i'm
[2:14:32] testifying
[2:14:33] of the power of jesus you say i got a
[2:14:34] temper brother daniel no problem god's
[2:14:36] got the answer for your temper brother
[2:14:38] daniel i got this secret sin that i
[2:14:40] can't overcome
[2:14:41] no problem god created you he can
[2:14:43] overcome that thing
[2:14:45] remember my sermon on palm sunday about
[2:14:47] the the donkey that never been ridden on
[2:14:49] had a nature
[2:14:50] and the creator went and sat on a donkey
[2:14:52] no man and he tamed that
[2:14:54] nature he contained the nature of a
[2:14:56] donkey and then surely he contained the
[2:14:58] nature of sons and daughters of almighty
[2:15:00] god that were
[2:15:00] created in his image oh blessed be the
[2:15:03] name lord there's nothing my god can't
[2:15:05] do
[2:15:05] there's no man that god can't break down
[2:15:08] and
[2:15:08] like paul is a pharisee of the pharisee
[2:15:10] and break him down and make him a
[2:15:12] a pillar make him the first church age
[2:15:14] messenger
[2:15:15] i'm so glad we serve a mighty god like
[2:15:17] that let's sing this little song is
[2:15:19] before we go
[2:15:20] oh
[2:15:25] for you yes lord

[2:15:38] cares for your
[2:15:46] sunshine
