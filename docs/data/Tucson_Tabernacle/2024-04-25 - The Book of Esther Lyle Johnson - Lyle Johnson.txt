you good evening good evening it's so good to see you Heather and I were out on the East Coast for the last few days and just got back sometime after midnight last night and we're really glad to be back not just to be back in Tucson to be back with you we missed you this last weekend and glad to see you glad to see you I have to tell you that I'm almost overcome by the timing of tonight's lesson we have just begun the observance of Passover it's a time to ensure that there's no leaven in our lives and to remember that we were once slaves to sin we see rest in our nation regarding Israel and Gaza prestigious universities are closing campuses and in effect sending Jewish students home because many campuses have become unsafe for them while leaders ring their hands but make excuses and refuse to confront the problem protesters are allowed to encamp on University grounds while hate mongers crowd the gates chanting hate to Jewish people and to America in an attempt to incite violence against this background in our own Nation tonight we'll look at one of the most unusual books of the Old Testament the Book of Esther it's one of only two books in the Bible where God is not even mentioned yet God's hand is apparent throughout and it deals with anti-jewish hatred and violence as we see today it's also the last book that was canonized accepted his Holy scripture in the Old Testament in the Jewish Bible in the Tanakh sometime around 400 BC a holiday called puim is celebrated in Judaism it's not one of the ones listed by Moses but rather it's observed as a celebration of Esther's Victory on behalf of the Jewish people unlike for example Joon of Arc Esther was not a warrior she was the Persian Empire equivalent of Miss Universe or Miss America Esther was an amazingly courageous woman putting her life on the line to protect her people from a vicious and Powerful Foe and the book tells her story It's the final book of the biblical histories of the Jewish people before we dig into its story of Courage of hopelessness versus hope of condemnation and rest restoration let's turn to its author who chose to hide himself within its Pages Lord Jesus we are so in awe of you we are so grateful as we sang you're more than enough Lord that that that sentence Jehovah sha means god you're you're there not here but there so we have to see you in each other to find you Lord we just pray Lord that you'd be very present tonight we thank you because we know that you you are present tonight Lord I pray that you would forgive me Lord of my shortcomings my faults Lord just people have come not to hear what Lyall Johnson has to say no one should care what Lyall Johnson has to say people are here to hear from you speak to us through your word tonight we ask in Jesus precious name amen we'll start our lesson with two verses the first is from the Gospel of John chapter 10 Jesus is speaking he's teaching his disciples about his mission as the Good Shepherd he says the thief who's the thief who does that represent What Spirit the thief cometh not but for to steal and to kill and to destroy but I am come that they who does the Good Shepherd protect that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly the second opening verse helping to set our context is the 30th verse from Proverbs chapter 31 charm is deceitful beauty is passing but a woman who fears the Lord she shall be praised please be seated the Bible is a book that is full of contrasts from its Pages we read of heroes and villains those who do good and those who do evil obedience and Disobedience and always imperfect people just like me we're encouraged to follow the lord and partake of his goodness and his grace all the while being admonished that there are consequences if we stray the Book of Esther is a study and contrasts it is said in shushan also called Susa which contained The Winter Palace of the Persian Empire dasas whom we heard about in the study of Ezra ruled from there but where is Susa well let's start with the world we know I've marked Tucson with a star and Jerusalem with the Magan deid the six-pointed Star of David now we're going to zoom into the area within the red rectangle and replace the modern names which you can't read anyway because it's too small with those of the context of the Book of Esther so there's a map of the Persian Empire here I marked Jerusalem as before and I've circled the location of Susa in today's world it's near the border of Iraq and Iran east of ancient Babylon the palace or Fortress or Citadel at Susa is the setting of the book as you can see on the map the empire was vast from the western edge of what we know is India through turkey much of the Black Sea area along the Eastern porch of North Africa and down to modern day Sudan called Ethiopia in the text under dasas whom we heard about in Ezra and Nehemiah Egypt was conquered and you might not know it but a canal was dug to allow shipping from the Nile to the red c a precursor to the Suez Canal of our time this occurred in 510 BC some 2400 years before the the digging of the Suz Canal As We Know It This is a powerful Kingdom the story of Esther takes place under an unnamed Persian king he's he's called a hazus in the biblical text but that's like saying Pharaoh it it is an individual name but it's a title it's uncertain which of the Persian kings this is many believe it was Xerxes others one of the AR Xerxes there are enough details the number of provinces and so forth in the text to make it uncertain some believe the story is fiction because of the discrepancies and details for example it it declares over and over there's 127 provinces secular history says that at its maximum size it was 120 provinces but take take your pick if the King's actual name were important it would probably have been in the text if it were AR Xerxes then Esther would have been chosen Queen about the time Ezra arrived in Jerusalem and still Queen when Nehemiah made his journey we'll go with Xerxes but keep in mind we simply don't know and no brother random didn't say anything about this that I could find either i' I put the name hadasa up there because that's the Hebrew name of Esther it's widely thought that Ezra or perhaps Nehemiah wrote the book well since this is a Bible study I'd like for each adult and young person who's a reader to hold up your Bible for a minute or two just if you don't have one there's one in the Pew there I'd like you just hold it up for a moment some of you need to be quick because others arms are already getting tired so so please continue to hold it up while I read next slide and then you'll be able to put it down it's from the sardian church age brother brandom says now you got the Bible in your hand yeah now read it believe it don't lay it up on the Shelf say well we got a Bible that ain't going to do you no good up there there's too many lutherans in Pentecost today laying the Bible around and taking what somebody else says about it brother read the word word search the scriptures for they are they which testify of me said Jesus in them you think you have eternal life that's the thing to do read that word you can put your Bible down now it's easier to read when it's not held up quite so high this is why we have a Bible study right it's why you need to read it at home not not because I ask you to or brother Daniel ask you to or that brother bradam asked you to Jesus ask you to and by the way he was referring to the Old Testament including the Book of Esther amen we should have a hunger a thirst for the word don't take my word for what it means I know almost nothing and at my age I forgotten most of that sounds like I'm preaching I better get on with the story of Esther uh I I found ancient copies of the Susan Citadel Courier and their archives dealing with the time of Esther this evening I've chosen to use the What's called the nkjv the new King James version translation rather than the King James version it's almost identical the differences are very minor substituting words like you for ye or he said rather than he answered when there was no question asked and so forth and putting speech and quotes it's just a slightly updated uh version but it's still retaining King James if you will you can follow along in your King James version if you like they they'll track just fine we'll read almost the entire text this evening there's there's only 10 chapters we'll read nine and a half of them so let's start reading it's year three of the king's reign the very beginning of it the first month the king's Banquets and queen vas's refusal well the book opens with a big party at the beginning of the third year of the king's Reign now it came to pass in the days of azerus this was the azerus who reigned over 127 provinces from India to Ethiopia so here we see that this hazus is not a unique name of a king or it wouldn't have said this is this particular azerus it would have just not bothered to put in that detail in those days when King azerus sat on the throne of his kingdom which is in shushan the Citadel or or the palace that in the third year of his Reign he made a feast for all of his officials and servants the powers of Persia and media that's media as an area not media like the news the Nobles the princes of the provinces being before him when he showed the riches of his glorious Kingdom and the Splendor of his excellent Majesty for many days 180 days in all 6 months this is a big party and when these days were completed the king made a feast lasting seven days for all the people who were present in shushan the Citadel from great to small in the court of the garden of the king's Palace there were white and blue linen curtains fastened with cords of fine linen and purple on Silver rods and marble pillars and the couches were of gold and silver on a mosaic pavement of alabaster turquoise white and black marble they of drinks and golden vessels each vessel being different from the other with Royal Wine in abundance according to the generosity of the king you get the picture opulence and ostentatious display of wealth in accordance with the law drinking was not compulsory for so the king had ordered all the officers of his household that they should do according to each man's pleasure in other words drink as much as you want Queen vashy also made a feast for the women in the Royal Palace which belonged to King azerus on the seventh day when the heart of the King was Marry with wine he was drunk he commanded muman besta harbona BTA abaka zetar and carcass seven Unix who served as officers or chamberlains who served in the presence of King azus to bring Queen vashy before the king wearing her royal crown around in order to show her beauty to the people and the officials for she was beautiful to behold but Queen vashi refused to come at the King's Command brought by his Unix therefore the King was Furious his anger burned within him then the king said to the wise men who understood the times for this was the king's manner toward all who knew Law And Justice those closest to him being Kena shettar ad Matata tares meis Merena and mukin the Seven princes of Persia and media who had access to the king's presence well we'll see the implication of this access as the story progresses access to the king's present and who ranked highest in the Kingdom what shall we do to Queen vashi according to law because she did not obey the command of King azerus brought to her by the Unix and mukan answer before the king and the princes it's quite the politician is mukin Queen vashy is not only wrong the king but also all the princes and all the people who are in all the provinces of king of azerus for the Queen's Behavior will become known to all women so that they will despise their husbands in their eyes when they report King azerus commanded Queen Vash to be brought him before him she did not come this very day the noble ladies of Persia and media will say to all the king's officials that they have heard of the behavior of the queen thus there will be excessive contempt and wrath if it pleases the king let a Royal Decree go out from him and let it be recorded in the laws of the Persians and the means so that it will not be altered that vashi shall come no more before King azerus and let the King give her royal position to another who is better than she when the king's decree which he shall make is proclaimed throughout all his Empire for it is a great Empire you have there King all wives will honor their husbands both great and small and the reply pleased the king and the princes and the King did according to the word of mukan remember this is year three then he sent letters to all the king's provinces to each province in its own script and to every people in their own language so that each man should be master in his own house and speak and the language of his own people Ashley is dethroned who will replace her who's Esther Esther chos Queen morai discover who's Mori what's what's going on this this is going to take us to the end of year seven almost five years will have transpired by the end of this little section chapter 2 after these things when the wrath of King hazus subsided he remembered vashi what she had done and what had been decreed against her then the king's servants who intended him said uh let beautiful young virgins be sought for the king and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom that they may gather all the beautiful young virgins to sh on the Citadel into the women's quarters under the custody of hega the king's custodian of the women let Beauty preparations be given them then let the young woman who pleases the king be Queen instead of ashy this thing pleased the king and he did so in chushan the Citadel there was a certain Jew whose name was Mori the son of yir the son of shimi the son of Kish a benjaminite Kish had been carried away from Jerusalem now this isn't actually Kish but it's the descendants of Kish not Kish himself from Jerusalem with the captives who have been captured with yonia king of Judah whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away so that was about 597 BC about 11 years before the destruction of the temple and morai had brought up hadassa that is Esther his uncle's daughter for she had neither father nor mother it's his cousin the young woman was lovely and beautiful when her father and mother died morai took her as his own daughter morai is a steady in contrast himself as we'll soon see so it was when the King's Command and decree were heard and when many young women were gathered at shushan the Citadel under the custody of hegi that Esther also was taken to the king's Palace and to the care of hegi the custodian of the women now the young woman pleased him and she obtained his favor so he readily gave Beauty preparations to her in addition to her allowance then seven Choice maid servants were provided for her from the king's Palace and he moved her and her maid servants to the best place in the house of the women Esther had not revealed her people or family for morai had charged her not to reveal it she kept her Jewish Heritage a secret every day Mor die paced in front of the court of the women's quarters to learn of Esther's welfare what was happening to her each young woman's turn came to go into king aazar after she completed 12 months preparation according to the regulations for their women for thus were the days of their preparation a portion six months with oil of myrr and six months with perfumes and preparations for beautifying women thus prepared each young woman went to the king and she was given whatever she desired to take with her from the women's quarters to the king's Palace in the evening she went and in the morning she returned to the second house of the women to the custody of shaaz the king's unic who kept the concubines she would not go to the King again unless the king delighted in her and called her by name now when the ter came for Esther the daughter of abah el the uncle of morai who had taken her as his daughter to go into the king she requested nothing but with hega the king's unic the custodian of the women advised and Esther obtained favor in the sight of all who saw her so Esther was taken to King azerus into his Royal Palace in the 10th month which is a month of tbit January in the seventh year of his Reign this is almost five years after deposed in vashy the king loved Esther more than all the other women and she obtained grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins so he set the Royal Crown upon her head and made her Queen instead of vashy then the king made a great feast the Feast of Esther for all his officials and servants he proclaimed a holiday from the provinces and gave gifts according to the generosity of a king when virgins were gathered together a second time morai sat within the king's gate this might have been months or years later we really don't know Now esther had not revealed her family and her people just as morai had charged her for Esther obeyed the command of morai as when she was brought up by him in those days while morai sat within the king's gate two of the king's Unix bean and teres doorkeepers became Furious and sought to lay hands on King azerus so the matter became known to Mori who told Queen Esther and Esther informed the king and mori's name when an inquiry was made into the matter it was confirmed and both were hanged on a Gallow and it was written in the book of The Chronicles in the presence of the king it says hanged on a Gallow and we tend to think of uh you know Boot Hill and and all of that sort of thing and you know the wild west no no this is a much more violent time this is not hanging somebody with a rope by the neck this is setting up a pole and then impaling the person on the pole uh it's just terrible and I'm not going to show you a picture but uh just so what you understand when it's talking about hanging on a Gallow it means impaling on a pole well what happens next the cor archives now we're up to year 12 this is another seven years have pass right or another several years anyway we pick up the story again but it says here H Haman plots against the Jews who's h on why does he hate Jewish people chapter three after these things king of hazar promoted Haman the son of Hamad the agagite and advanced him and set his seat above all the princes who were with him now he outranks Muk and he outranks those other seven guys from chapter one so he is the King's senior advisor and all the king's servants who were within the king's gate bowed and paid homage to Haman for so the king had commanded concerning him a bit like bowing the knee to Joseph at the order of pharaoh back in Genesis except how is no Joseph but morai would not bow or pay homage then the king's servants who were within the king's gate said to Mori who do you think you are why do you transgress the King's Command now what happened when they spoke with him daily and he would not listen to them that they told it to hamon to see whether mori's words would stand for morai had told them that he was a Jew perhaps he's thinking like Daniel before Nebuchadnezzar years before after Daniel got away with not bowing down to that image that he didn't have to bow down either we we don't know that or Pride or whatever we we simply don't know when Haman saw that morai did not bow or pay him homage Haman was filled with wrath so we see of this upcoming problem that they're going to have that mori's behavior is triggering the disaster there's no mention of God or a commandment we don't know why he didn't bow why he didn't pay homage we simply know that he did not but Haman disdained to lay hands on morai alone for they had told him of the people of morai instead Haman sought to destroy all the Jews who were throughout the whole Kingdom of a azus the people of Mori I wonder if Haman and Hamas come from the same rote I don't know just I wonder in the first month which is the month of Nissan April in the 12th year of King azerus they cast poor they rolled dice whatever they did in order to figure out oh what are we going to do this terrible thing so they cast Pur that is the lot before Haman to determine the day day and the month until it fell in the 12th month which is the month of Adar March then Haman said to King azerus there is a certain people scattered and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of your kingdom their laws are different from all other peoples they do not keep the king's laws therefore it's not fitting for the king to let them remain if it pleases the king let a decree be written that they be destroyed and I will pay 10,000 talents of silver into the hands of those who do the work to bring it to the king's treasuries going to make you a rich guy and Destroy these people so the king took a signant ring from his hand and gave it to Haman the son of Hamad the agagite the enemy of the Jews a Signet ring well here are two signant rings the the one on the left is a gold ring from the fifth century BC in Persia so this ring existed at the time of Esther it was made about about that time the ring on the right it demonstrates how such a ring was used a document was rolled up ceiling wax melted on it to prevent it from being unrolled and while the wax was still soft the ring was used to make an impression on the wax and this way without a matching ring the document can not be tampered with and its authenticity could thus be verified we're getting back to the text the king said to Haman the money and the people are given to you do with them as seems good to you thus showing it some level his disdain for these people that he ruled as well as his trust in the advice and Judgment of Haman unlike Cyrus or duras he doesn't investigate he doesn't check the records he just tells pan to see to it as his senior advisor he must be correct right then the king's scribes were called on the 13th day of the first month that's April 17th last Wednesday and a decree was written according to all that Haman commanded to the King s traps to the governors who were over each province to the officials of all the people to every Province according to its script and to every people in their language and the name of King azus it was written and sealed with a king's signant ring a little sidebar when I was in Japan several years ago staying with a a Japanese friend over there he showed me he had a a stamp and and it was a handcarved and special little stamp and in Japan in in America if ass signed a contract you sign the contract they try and do a signature verification it's hard to do with me because it's just a weird scribble that changes every time but but in Japan they use this special stem that's his legal signature my friend pointed out to me that if somebody stole that and used it he could become legally obligated to buy a house or a car or whatever because that's his legal signature so signant ring is very much the same thing but that's just a modern example the letters were sent by couriers into all the king's provinces to destroy to kill and to annihilate all the Jews both young and old little children and women in one day the 13th day of the 12th month which is the month of Adar corresponding to March 7th and to plunder their possessions steal their stuff a copy of the document was to be issued his law in every Province being published for all people that they should be ready for that day the couriers went out Ed by the King's Command and the decree was proclaimed in shushan the Citadel so the king and hamon sat down to drink but the city of shushan was perplexed what what's the king doing what's up with him on well we move up a couple of months here over the next couple of months most of the events of the book occur we see Esther is not just a beautiful woman as she becomes a heroine and morai is not just a Man Too Proud to acknowledge the number two person in the Empire chapter 4 when morai learned all that had happened he tore his clothes and put on sack law think of burlap like a feed sack coarse fibrous cloth sackcloth in ashes and went out into the midst of the city he cried out with a loud and bitter cry he went as far as the front of the king's gate for no one might enter the king's gate clothed with sackcloth and in every province with the King's Command and decree arrived there was great mourning among the Jews with fasting weeping and wailing many lay in sackcloth and Ashes you notice not only is God's name not mentioned prayer is not mentioned so Esther's maids and Unix came and told her about morai and the queen was deeply distressed then she sent garments to clothe morai and take a sacko away from him but he would not accept them then Esther called hatok one of the king's unic whom he had appointed to attend her and she gave him a command concerning morai to learn what and why this was so hat hat went out to morai in the city square that was in front of the king's gate and morai told him all that had happened to him and the sum of money that Haman had promised to pay into the king's treasuries to destroy the Jews morai also gave him a copy of the written decree for the Jewish people's destruction which was given at chushan that he might show it to Esther and explain it to her and that he might command her to go into the king to make supplication to him and plead before him for her people so hot returned and told Esther the words of Mori then Esther spoke to hotot and gave him a command for Mori all the king's PE all the king's servants and the people the king's provinces know that any man or woman who goes into the inner Court to the king he has but one law put all to death except the one to whom the king holds out the golden scepter that he may live yet I myself have not been called to go into to the king these 30 days so Esther's servants told Mori Esther's words and morai told them to to answer Esther do not think in your heart that you will escape in the king's Palace any more than all the other Jews for if you remain completely silent at this time relief and deliverance will arise for the Jews from an place but you and your father's house will perish yet who knows whether you have come to the kingdom for such a time as this then Esther's true colors came out and she courageously told them to reply to Mori go gather all the Jews who are in who are present in sushan and fast for me neither eat nor drink for three days night or day My Maids and I will Fast likewise and so I go and to the King which is against the law and if I perish I perish so morai went his way and did according to all that Esther commanded him morai is accustomed to giving orders to Esther he's now taking orders from her and an effort to averted disaster that he had it invert triggered chapter five now it happened on the third day that Esther put on her royal robes and stood in the inner Court of the king's Palace across from the King's house while the king sat on his Royal House facing the entrance of the house on the third day on the third day Jesus rose from Death on the third day Esther Rose to face death so it was when the king saw Queen Esther standing in the court so it was when the king saw Queen Esther standing in the court that she found favor in his sight Grace and the King held out to Esther the golden septer that was in his hand granting life instead of death then Esther went near and touch the top of the scepter I can hear Brother brandom telling us that a pardon is not a pardon unless it's accepted as a pardon Jesus died to pay for our sins but it only has effect if we accept it and the King said to her what do you wish Queen Esther it must be important to you you wouldn't have risked your life to come here what is your request it shall be given to you after to half the kingdom ask what you will in my name and I'll do it says the king so Esther answered if it pleases the king let the king and hamon come today to a banquet that I prepared for him then the king said bring Haman quickly that he may go to do as Esther has said so the king and Aman went to the banquet that ES had prepared at the banquet of wine the king said to Esther what is your petition it shall be granted you what is your request up to half the kingdom it it shall be done you you certainly wouldn't risk your life as you did simply to invite the two of us to lunch oh by the way it was a very good lunch then Esther answered and said if it my petition request is this if I have found favor in the sight of the king and if it pleases the king to Grant my petition and fulfill my request then let the king and hmon come to the banquet which I will prepare for them and I will do as the King has said so hamon went out that day joyful and with a glad heart but when hamon saw Mori in the king's gate and that he did not stand or tremble before him he was filled with indignation against morai nevertheless Haman restrained himself and went home and he sent and called for his friends and his wife his Ares and Haman told them of his great riches the multitude of his children everything which the king had promoted him how he Advanced him above all the officials and Servants of the king moreover Haman said besides Queen Esther invited no one but me to come in with the king to the banquet that she prepared tomorrow I'm again invited by her along with the King yet all this avails me nothing so long as I see morai the Jews sitting at the king's gate then his wife zes and all his friends said to him let a Gallows be made 75 feet tall and in the morning suggested the king that Mori be hanged on it making him a public spectacle as he rise and screams impaled on it then go merrily with the King to the banquet and the thing pleased him on so he had the Galos made but that night the king couldn't sleep so one was commanded to bring the book of the records of The Chronicles and they were read before the king you have a problem in going to sleep find a really boring book read it if you can't read have somebody read it to you right so they brought in the the phone book for shushan and read all the so they brought the book of records and it was found written that morai had told of bana and terish two of the King's unic The doorkeepers Who had sought to lay hands on King azerus some six years earlier then the king said what honor or dignity has been bestowed on morai for this and the King's servants who attended him said nothing has been done for him so the king said who who Who's in the court now Haman had just entered the outer Court of the king's Palace to suggest that the king hang morai on The Gallows that he had prepared for him the king's servant said to him haman's there standing in the court the king said let him come in so Haman came in and the King asked him what shall be done for the man whom the king Delights to honor you're my advisor tell me what what do you think now Haman thought in his heart huh who would the king toight to honor more than me Haman answered the king for for the man whom the king Delights to honor let a royal robe be brought in which the King has worn and and a horse on which the k King has ridden and which has a Royal Crest placed on his head then let this robe and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king's most noble princes that he may array the man whom the king Delights to honor then parade him on Horseback through the city square and Proclaim before him thus shall it be done to the man whom the king Delights to honor the king said to Hammon oh I like that hurry take the robe and the horse as you have suggested and do so for morai the Jew who sits within the king's gate leave nothing of done of all that you have spoken so Haman took the robe and the horse arrayed Mori led him on Horseback through the city square and proclaimed before him thus shall it be done to the man whom the king Delights to honor afterward morai went back to the king's gate but Haman hurried to his house mourning with his head covered when Haman told his wife zarish and all his friends everything that had happened to him his wise men and his wife zarish said to him if Mori before whom you have begun to fall is of Jewish descent you will not Prevail against him but will surely fall before him while they were still talking with him the king's Unix came and hastened to bring Haman to the banquet which Esther had prepared so the king and Haman went to dine with Queen Esther isn't she a beautiful queen I think this is [Applause] just on the second day at the banquet of wine the King again said to Esther what is your petition Queen Esther it shall be granted you and what is your request up to half the kingdom it shall be done it I don't know about you this reminds me of the story of hady Wright you can have what you want just name it and just like Haddie Wright both answered seeking the welfare of their people then Queen Esther answered and said if I have found favor in your sight O King and if if it pleases the king let my life be given me at my petition and my people at my request for we have been sold my people and I to be destroyed to be killed and to be annihilated had we been sold as male and female slaves I would have held my tongue although the enemy can never compensate for the king's loss so King azerus answered and said to Queen Esther who is he where is he that would dare presume in his heart to do such a thing the King still does not know that his Queen is Jewish or he would know that he had agreed to and ordered this very destruction and Esther said the adversary an enemy is this wicked hmon so Haman was terrified before the king and queen then the king arose in his wrath from the banquet of wine and went into the palace Garden but Haman stood before Queen eser pleading for his life for he saw that evil was determined against him by the king when the King returned from the palace Garden to the place of the banquet of wine Haman had fallen across the couch where Esther was then the king said will he also assault the queen while I am in the house as the word left the king's mouth they covered Hon's face now harbana one of the unic said to the king look the Gallow 75 ft High which Haman made for morai who spoke good on the king's behalf is standing at the house of Haman and the King said hang him on it wow so they hanged him on on The Gallows that he had prepared for Mori then the king's wrath subsided chapter8 on that day King azerus gave Queen Esther the house of Haman the enemy of the Jews and Mori came before the king for Esther had told him how he was related to her so the king took off his signant ring which he had taken from Haman and gave it to morai and Esther appointed morai over the house of Haman Now esther went Uninvited and spoke again to the king fell down at his feet and implored him with tears to counteract the evil of hman the a agite in the scheme which he had devised against the Jews and the King held out the golden scepter to Esther so Esther arose and stood before the king and said if it pleases the king and if I have found favor in the side in his sight and the thing seems right to The King and I am pleasing in his eyes Let It Be written to revoke the letters devised by hamon the son of hamadaa the agagite which he wrote to annihilate the Jews who are in all the king's provinces for How Can I Endure to see the evil that will come to my people or How Can I Endure to see the destruction of my countrymen then King azerus said to Queen Esther and Mori the Jew indeed I have given Esther the house of Haman and they have hanged him on the Gallows because he tried to lay his hand on the Jews you yourselves write a decree concerning the Jews as you please in the king's name Seal it with the king signant ring for whatever is written in the king's name and sealed with the king's signant Ring no one can revoke so the king's scribes were called at that time in the third month which is the month of cvon on the 23rd day June 25th and it was written according to all that morai commanded to the Jews the satraps and governors the princes of the provinces from India to Ethiopia 127 provinces in all to every province in its own script to every people in their own language and to the Jews in their own script and language and he wrote In The Name of King azerus sealed it with the king signant ring and sent Letters by couriers on horseback riding on Royal horses bred from Swift steeds by these letters the king permitted the Jews who were in every city to gather together and protect their lives to defend themselves to destroy kill and annihilate all the forces of any people or province that would assault them both little children and women and to plunder their possessions on one day in all the provinces of King azerus on the 13th day the 12th month which is the month of Adar a copy of the document was to be issued as a decree in every Province and published for all people so that the Jews would be ready on that day to avenge themselves on their enemies the couriers who rode on Royal horses went out hastened and pressed on by the King's Command and the decree was issued in shushan the Citadel so morai went out from the presence of the king in Royal apparel of blue and white with a great crown of gold and a garment of fine linen and purple and the City of shushan rejoiced and was glad the Jews had light and gladness joy and honor and in every Province and City wherever the King's Command and decree had come the Jews had a joy and gladness a feast and a holiday then many of the people of the land became Jews because the fear of the Jews fell upon them notice the old decree could not be analed they couldn't tear it up and throw it away it still stood but was sent out under the Seal of the king but the new decree gave the Jewish people the right to resist and further to attack and destroy their enemies our struggle against our natures ly's struggle against Lyle's nature isn't passive against our spiritual enemies is not passive we have to take up our weapons identify and destroy that which would otherwise destroy us nine months go by Esther 9 now in the 12th month that is the month of D on the 13th day the time came for the King's Command and his decree to be executed on the day that the enemies of the Jews had hoped to overpower them the opposite occurred and that the Jews themselves overpowered those who hated them the Jews gathered together in their cities throughout all the provinces of King a hasus to lay hands on those who sought their harm and no one could withstand them because fear of them fell upon all people and all the officials of the provinces the satraps the governors and all those doing the king's worked help the Jews because the fear of Mori fell upon them for morai was great in the king's Palace and his Fame spread throughout all the provinces for this man Mori became increasingly prominent thus the Jews defeated all their enemies with the stroke of the sword with Slaughter and destruction and did what they pleased with those who hated them and in shushan the Citadel the Jews killed and destroyed 500 men all also parata dafon aspath Pata ad ala aidata parashta arasai aridai and vesa the 10 sons of hon the son of hamata the enemy of the Jews they killed but they did not lay a hand on the plunder on that oops on that day the number of those who were killed in shushan the CIT was brought to the king and the King said to Queen Esther the Jews have killed and destroyed 500 men in shusan the Citadel and the 10 sons of Haman what have they done in the rest of the king's provinces now what is your petition it shall be granted to you what is your further request it shall be done then Esther said if it pleases the king let it be granted to the Jews who are in sushan to do again tomorrow according to today's decree and let Hon's 10 Sons be hanged on The Gallows well done so the king commanded this to be done the decree was issued in shushan and they hanged haman's 10 Sons so the dead bodies were impaled on spikes and the Jews who were in shushan gathered together again on the 14th day of the month of Adar and killed 300 additional men at shushan but they did not lay a hand on the plunder the remainder of the Jews in the king's provinces gathered together and Protected Their Lives had rest from their enemies and killed 75,000 of their enemies but they did not lay a hand on the plunder this was on the 13th day of the month of Adar and on the 14th day of the month they rested and made it a day of feasting and gladness but the Jews who at shusan assembled together on the 13th day as well as on the 14th and on the 15th of the month they rested and made it a day of feasting and gladness we're we're running out of time please read the remainder of this chapter nine at home in it the feast or holiday of purm is established to be observed reserved by the Jewish people Forever on the 14th and 15th of Adar Adar is the last month of the Jewish calendar this year 2024 Pim was observed on March 23 and 24 the book ends we'll read the last verse chapter 10:3 for morai the Jew was second to King azerus and was great among the Jews and well received by the multitude of his Brethren seeking the good of his people and speaking peace to all his countrymen excuse me in Jewish practice the Book of Esther is read twice in the evening of the first day as well as in the morning of the two-day celebration of Pim children are given noise [Music] makers this one happens to have a likeness of Haman and the practice is that whenever they're reading the text and the name Haman comes up whenever anyone says Ham on you want to drown out and erase his name from memory and the other thing that you do is boo but you have to be quick because it only takes a moment to say h on the children love this okay this is a holiday that is really focused on children their celebration I I used to call it Jewish Halloween a family that we know really well I remember one year when I was a kid they showed me a picture of their two kids their son and their daughter and one was dressed up as a teapot one was dressed up as a coffee pot it was it was it was just they were just having fun they were having fun they were they were just having fun I think I said that yeah so so what we're going to do this evening when when uh when everyone's excused is we have some for the children so they can practice for pering for next year and uh sister Martha has prepared some treats for the kids because it's uh that's what you do it's a celebration right so uh so as as we leave they'll have that handed out and and and so forth so again this is just part of the of the Jewish tradition and and and celebration well we've just read of Destruction turned to Victory we love these kinds of stories but as I mentioned when we began there's unrest in our nation today unlike any we've witnessed regarding Jewish people last week Heather and I were in Virginia with our oldest son and his wife to celebrate Heather's birthday I won't tell you which one we spent Sunday afternoon in the Virginia Holocaust Museum I've been to the one in Israel yadvashem and found it deeply disturbing the violence portray is not a Hollywood fiction this isn't Star Wars we see it now from a distance of 80 or 90 years people are denying that it happened it's history it's not very real to many when I was a child it was from a distance of 10 or 20 years my friends that had dads that had fought in the War they saw this stuff it was recent it was fresh in the 30s and 40s 1930s and 40s there was no Esther for God to use to stop Hitler the Haman of that time a family we knew in San Francisco during my childhood were actually closer to us than most of our blood relation it turns out that they were Holocaust Survivors Ralph the dad his name before he left Germany was wolf escaped from Germany at age of 11 or 12 early in the Nazi Reign around 1932 or 3 or four I forgotten which year he came to America sponsored by an uncle his future wife lisel escaped in 1941 with most of her family I say most because those that did not make it with them that day that was the last day that any Jews escaped from Nazi Germany her other relatives perished into death camps I remember Lisa telling me that Lisa went when she finally arrived in America as a teenager San Francisco accepted her and her family she vowed she would never live anywhere else and until the day she died she lived in San Francisco I say this Jewish Family the errands were closer than much of our family when Mom and Dad heard the message decided to leave San Jose and come to Tucson the errand told my parents we don't understand why you're doing this but if things don't work out for you there you're welcome to come to our home and stay with us until you can get back on your feet when 911 occurred I reached out to a Muslim friend of mine in the Washington DC area Heather and I invited him and his extended family to come and stay with us until whatever was going on was sorted out I knew he was no part of any faction involved in the events of that day and wanted him to know that he'd be safe with us we don't have to agree with or even understand another's perspective to reach out and provide friendship comfort and support Jesus didn't say come unto me all you who agree with me in my interpretation and I will give you rest I saw a sign in the Holocaust Museum that I want to share with you first this is a pastor in Nazi Germany first they came for the Communists I wasn't a communist I didn't speak out then they came for the Socialists and the trade unionists but I wasn't one of them so I didn't speak out when they went after the Jews I didn't speak I wasn't a Jew when they came for me there was no one left to speak for me I'll end these personal remarks with the observation that compassion is good but it's not enough there's a time to ring our hands and there's a time to roll up our sleeves it's our actions that count coming from the right motives well let's take take a closer look what lessons can we take home from Esther if the musicians would please come as I indicated when we started this evening the name of the Lord never appears in the text the closest we come is when morai admonishes Esther in chapter 4:4 for if you remain completely silent at this time relief and deliverance will arise for the Jews from another place but you and your father's house will perish yet who knows whether you have come to the kingdom for such such a time as this how do we serve God by serving his people Jesus said in Matthew 25 in as much as you've done it unto the least of these my brethren you've done it unto me both good and bad how does God intervene most often through his people what brother random once referred to as god with skin on it Moses followed the cloud and the pillar of fire an amazing display of the supernatural but no one else did not even Jesus we so often look for the supernatural but God's not a showoff and more often Works through natural means quietly in the background yet it's the very same God at work we often Proclaim thus and so in the name of Jesus it's not some magic incantation but we sometimes seem to treat it as such we are to proclaim the name certainly but it's the life that we live that shows if it's just a name just words or if there's something there Heather and I are routine Inseparable but what about the Lord and I the Lord and you women in this book have great influence vashy Esther zarish you can be sure Heather has great influence on me well let's close in song There's a song I learned from franois liar when he came from Switzerland to learn the message if you will Back in 1970 as 20 years old just a young

I also want to remind everyone um brother Lyall touched on at the beginning that we are seeing an unprecedented time in our country and around the world I won't say it's unprecedented I'm sorry it's it's had a precedent set um thousands of years ago we read about it in the book of eser today and uh I preached on the Prince of Persia the other day and you see that same anointing that same evil spirit That Came Upon This Man hon and how he hated the Jewish people and we see now on college campuses around the country hatred for the Jewish people and they use excuses so brothers and sisters I believe that we have an obligation as Christians as those that have benefited from the blind eyes of the Jewish people that we would pray for our brothers and sisters our Jewish brothers and sisters that they would be safe at this time I just pray that it wouldn't escalate and go into something that's happened many times over the years so please keep them a race of people in your hearts and in your minds in the days the coming days and the coming weeks the Lord would protect them I know he will but I also believe that the Lord does honor our prayers I know if there's one person that if you want to get to me and you can't get directly to me there is one person that will get to me and that's my bride that's my wife and I believe as the bride of Christ [Music] that God will lend down his ear for his sweetheart and hear the prayers of us for these people God bless you brothers and sisters you're dismissed I'm so glad I'm a part of the family of God I've been washed in the fountain cleansed by by his blood join is with Jesus as we travel this for I'm part of the family the family of God the first verse notice we say brother and sister [Music] around it's because we're a family
