people traveling we need to remember our our friends all the Petersons are gone um they're I think at a family reunion so we're very short staffed with them we got the the Murrays are gone and quite a few others are gone so remember them as we pray today when we bring our requests before the Lord um Heath who you got with you man I know I know this guy he just followed you in that's good I know Elijah and who's Brandon Brendan Brandon nice God bless you my brother welcome it's good to have you here sister Lonnie who are these folks in front of you ah Cisco oh welcome God bless you all it's good to have you Elijah and Brandon we're clapping for you too God bless you who got here uh Brother David and brother Christian welcome God bless you too welcome all right I'm going through this side I think I think everybody on this side is is an a a regular pointing over there I can't see oh who do we have Sister Sister Priscilla who is this oh welcome I didn't see you back there God bless you good to have you from uh it makes me feel good the kids bringing their friends from school in God bless you Sister welcome I pray that the Lord will bless you bless you this morning look over on this side I see hey brother John brother John right this is Brother Matthew's dad brother John McFadden brother John brother John's a pastor in Philadelphia brother John come up you got to say a few words you got to be instant in season and out of season come on up brother oh it's so good to see you it's been a long time yeah I'm sorry to embarrass you so good well good morning it's good to be here um you know we took a group out to a voice of God where I met Dan first time to be honest I was telling the people don't be critical you know if you see something strange just being honest and uh when we met brother Dan I thought wow he's kind of normal so uh probably true but anyway we appreciated the tour we had and it was a blessing and uh so that's that's the probably the first and last time I met you maybe yeah yeah so uh you know I was thinking sitting there recently um some Jehovah Witnesses came up to our house and um I was going somewhere I was kind of late I'm like I've been through this before you know so they're very nice ladies and tapping on my car window and uh and they wanted to I said that your team will schedule some other time I said well I kind of know what you believe and uh I believe Jehovah the Old Testament is the Jesus of the new yes amen amen and frankly I think you missed the whole point you know and um you know I gave him some scriptures you know Isaiah you know unto us a child was born unto us a son was given you know his name shall be called the counselor principally the the Everlasting your father the Mighty God I said I believe Jesus Is God not the a son the second person but the person of God and when any movement misses the main focus there's something wrong amen even this end time movement yes yes you know I love brother Branham and I believe he fulfilled the scriptures but Jesus Christ is the one that came and touch me save me and uh so uh I just love to hear people want to worship Jesus Christ because we know brother Graham when we get to the other side he's going to stand there with us while we worship Jesus Christ so we've got to keep our focus on the main thing and it's all about him it's all about Jesus so that's all [Applause] well John we miss your boy been trying to get him back I am thank the Lord for what brother John just said it is it's all about our lord Jesus you know this whole Bible was written to point us towards the Lord Jesus every Prophet that has ever come new testament old testament appointed people to Old Testament Jehovah the New Testament Jesus then they're the same one and I thank God that he did send us a messenger in our age that pointed us to the same Jesus Christ the same God Of Heaven that the other disciples and the other Apostles pointed us to and brother John if we miss what he pointed us to then we missed the whole message and it's it's not about a man it's not about um an end time or an age it's about Christ it's about our lord Jesus I'm so thankful for him as I've said many times I wish I had more words to thank him more words to describe him he he is nothing short of the Mighty God the Everlasting father exactly what you said um we have a few Pro requests let me uh I'd like to read a testimony this is Carol Ellis back there assistant Carol uh sent to me yesterday says this she says I have a testimony so grateful for the prayers for my brother David you remember we had the prayer request uh a few Services ago for um sister Carol's brother for my brother David when I arrived last week his legs and arm were paralyzed couldn't move them at all and was in much pain Friday he was able to move to a rehab center he is moving his legs on his own to get out of bed and his arm is healed God is good amen all the time um a few prayer requests number one brother Aaron sister Rachel Guerra are sick they're doing better but Aaron told me this morning he's doing better but he's he's um he's been sick and if we could if we could pray for him um sister Naomi I forgot to

little under the weather a couple of them thank you sister pray the Lord will bless you for making the sacrifice to come and be with us as I mentioned brother Aaron sister Rachel they're doing better but they've um they've been sick brother Nathaniel Dougal he has a cyst in his lower jaw this is Brother Ed's son and he would like the Saints to pray for him and he's having some tests done he would like us as a church to pray for him at the Lord would have mercy on him he's not claiming it he says he said I'm not even claiming it but feels good when you know that the brothers and sisters are praying so let's pray for him um and then as I mentioned earlier there's there's quite a few that are traveling and um pray that not only the Lord's hand will be upon those that are traveling but also that they would be a witness wherever they are whether it be a gas station whether it be a restaurant whether it be a church whether it be a family reunion whatever it is may God bless these brothers and sisters that are traveling and give them wisdom and and strength to spread this gospel brother John what greater thing that we could could we ever do than tell the world about a risen savior about our lord Jesus we have this morning we have brother Ryan long and I'll introduce him here in a few minutes and then tonight I will be ministering the title of my sermon tonight will um will be if the Lord is willing that you must have a testimony and I will tie it in with Acts chapter 26 with Paul's testimony so please come out tonight for that um then this this week next weekend we'll have our normal service on Sunday morning and then next weekend I'd really like to devote to testimonies and singing I'd like to hear we have a lot of new members in the church I'd like to hear what you all

your testimonies if the brothers brother Ed if you and the brothers could come forward to receive the offering we take this offering I wanted to mention to the church I know that we've had a lot of changes obviously lately the the offerings that we take and the tithing the offerings are meant to do the projects that we do like like with camp and and like with the new rooms that we've made and any Renovations that we have planned for the the fellowship hall or the sanctuary that's what these offerings are meant for they're separate than the tithes the tithes are Our obligation where tithes means 10 percent and that's Our obligation to the church and then the offerings are above and beyond that and we do our best to use those offerings as a blessing to the church to the people and um we've got a long way to go friends but I thank God that we're in it together and we're pushing towards the coming of our Lord Jesus if we could stand for a moment as we bring these requests before before our lord Jesus if you bow your heads and if you were to have a request upon your heart know that the almighty God is looking down upon you upon me and if you would have a request that's either been spoken or unspoken would you lift up your hand without request upon your heart almighty God we approach you in the name above all names the name of the Lord Jesus and Lord as you look down upon your children you saw the hands raised we pray Lord that every hand that was raised that you would meet every every need every request my father I pray that these prayer requests that we've brought

there's power in prayer foreign God bless you and I also want to say thank you so much for the prayers past and the church I had gone to Jeffersonville via Chicago I was really wanting to get to Jeffersonville and by his grace and the arrangements of the pasta I went to Jeffersonville so now you can tell the brother from Africa after hearing this message for the past 34 years and I'm hearing the prophet on the tape The Taste months the profit on the tape and now I come to Tucson Tabernacle and this morning when I woke up I was listening to the message that he preached here from this physical pulpit he preached the message expectation Sunday morning and then in the evening the message was Jesus Christ the same yesterday to the end forever and in that message in the morning he was thanking the pastor and then the brother uh brother Norman and his wife they had just taken residence into Tucson and they started attending this church before it became Tucson Tabernacle and then this brother Norman was a carpenter-like so brother Norman was contracted to do these steps and then brother Norman according to the prophet in the tape he says when brother Norman was doing the second or the last step he started crying and he says Lord if you can make brother Branham to step on these steps one day so walesty was there I don't know where he was but the prophet says in the tape he was somewhere there and then the prophet says now I am here I think he made the prophet somewhere and he was crying brother Norman because the desire of the heart was fulfilled I want you to listen to that message again now you can imagine things that we were told now I'm imagining this is the physical pulpit that is stood in preached the message expectation and if you go to the prayer meeting the prayer prayer line in the evening of that message is tremendous so I traveled to Jeffersonville the associate pastor opened for me and I entered into the sanctuary and had prayers there when is the service again and the brother to the pastor brother Adam was here the other day I was at their home for two nights then I was picked by another brother from Africa who has been there for quite some time and at this house there is a friend to this brother he's a brother that I know from Zambia but he comes from Congo so he says brother Jonathan is here he says I'm coming to see him so when he comes to Simi he brings me this jacket and the shirt it is at home he says here is your jacket brother Jonathan I want to tell you the testimony he says uh is ministering in the best place of brother Brennan and he went there and he meets this boy is talking to this boy he invites this boy to the church uh this boy invites this brother to their church and the brother enters he sings a song he starts talking to them and their seats amen there who happens to be the father of this brother this young boy was a church and when they are talking they are talking they are talking they are talking this man believes the message some people in that church they believe the message the church starts and this young man says uh this is my father he's about 90 something years so this man calls this brother from Zambia from Congo he says come here I want to tell you something [Music] and he says uh you know what I am the man that lowered the casket of brother Brennan I saw God from that day on that that man was a man of God and as we are talking today that man has believed this message after the passing now of the prophet I want to say to you that brother sister this message is truth this message is crust we come from Branham Tabernacle and they took me to the Grave side I just wanted to offer a prayer there and thank the Lord for the ministry and from the graveside the brother says let's go for lunch so we walk into this eating place and there are three ladies there 80 something three ladies one is in the wheelchair and they are seated there I think they were waiting to be saved and so we stand by the counter the brother is trying to pay and I'm standing like this behind the brother and I feel a part here and is one of the ladies the old ladies there she walked straight to where I was standing and she passed me here and then I came this way I said hello mom she says hello can I talk to you I said yes please then she says are you a minister of the Gospel I kept quiet I pretended as if I didn't hear I said I beg your pardon says are you the minister of the Gospel I said yes ma'am okay come here so she takes me to where the three were seated then she says which mess well which church is this then I said um my name is Jonathan I'm from Africa I am I believe of the end time message brought by William Brenner and the lady in the wheelchair she says wow I am my believer of that message I used to go to the Tabernacle now I'm on right in Jefferson Town the power behind this message the devil may try to do anything that you try to discourage you and it will make you probably come to a level where you start doubting whether this message is true or not I'm a witness today this message is truth and is Jesus Christ the same yesterday to the end forever I think on Sunday I'll show that speak to those pictures pastor and then when we give the Testament let's land on our feet As we sing that song Let's bow our heads and close our eyes for a moment and just sing that chorus as the pastor comes oh [Music] things are possible [Music] oh only all things are possible [Music] as we raise our hands to him Lord I believe Lord I believe [Music] are possible Lord I believe Lord I believe Lord I believe all things are possible Lord I believe brother mentioned expectation the sermon brother Brandon preached from this Pulpit right here and he said he told some people afterwards brother Aaron has given the testimony to talk to another brother yesterday that gave me the same testimony he said when brother Branham left this church he said that his message was for a group of Mexican people that were over in in the side area here of the church sitting in the front and those people many of their families are with us today and today after service I'm going to be baptizing two more at least two more from that same family that was over there profit it's just some of the things that he said or just they're overwhelming a couple months ago I was at a Minister's meeting and we had a special speaker up in up in Phoenix brother McGarry's Church and this brother had an anointing on him and as I was listening to him speak his revelation of the word just impressed me so much brother John that he had that understanding that it is Jesus Christ and all the prophets pointed to this man Jesus Christ and as I listened to him I started praying and I prayed for for months a few at least a few weeks and asking the Lord as you know there's very few brothers that come to this Pulpit very few and I asked the Lord Lord would you want that brother to speak here to speak to your sheep and believe that it is the Lord's will that that brother speaks to us this morning brother Ryan let's if we could sing only believe one more time as this brother as brother Ryan takes the pulpit brother Ryan long God bless you [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] baby [Music] all things are possible only be delicious bow our heads as they just play that slowly approach the one that we believe in Heavenly Father Lord You're So merciful to us Lord you're so gracious to us Lord You're so forgiving Lord and father that you would just allow us to come together Lord as a group of Believers Lord is no small thing in this day and age it's not something I want to take for granted Lord that you would just provide a place Lord provide a a safe shelter Lord for believers to gather and Lord that you would place in the heart of each person in here Lord the inspiration to walk through the door this morning and Lord we do it in anticipation to hear from you Lord to receive a Divine word Lord a divine revelation straight from the Throne of God Lord that's what I'm after this morning Lord and I believe Lord you see the Heart Lord of each person in here father that Lord maybe we are distracted Lord by things that have happened yesterday Lord or this morning Father but I think you see the intent of the heart of everyone in here Lord is to hear from you this morning Lord would you just help us Lord as as just humans Lord just to set aside those distractions Lord those thoughts of earlier today and maybe later today just set those aside father and just focus in on you this morning I believe that we've worshiped you Lord I believe that we've tried our best Lord to make you welcome father and Lord I believe there's there's two or three in here Lord that I've gathered that believe in your name father and Lord You've promised to be here with us this morning Lord not for our past people or a future people Lord but for this group of people this morning here Lord You've promised to be here and Lord would you just come and speak to us now this morning Lord in Jesus name we ask amen God bless you this morning it's always always good to be in the house of the Lord at least that's how I feel it's not always uh comfortable to be in this position in the house of the Lord I much prefer to be where you're sitting at this morning but it's still good nonetheless to be in the house of the Lord how many how many is happy to be here amen amen it's good to hear this morning and I appreciate the the words that the Pastor said this morning I certainly give all the honor and glory to God as we as we want to do in everything if you know if we do any good thing it's not because we are good but it's because he's good amen and and and it's just the more that God does for us and the more that we see him in our lives the more humble we should be and that is the call I believe of this of this age and this morning is to be humble to be not puffed up and not be thinking great of ourselves but to realize that without the grace of God where would I be where would I be this morning without the grace of God Amen we appreciate the invitation from our brother this morning and and the confidence and we appreciate you coming out this morning to church it's um we just want to lean on God this morning amen how many how many wants to lean on God this morning amen it's good to be here with my my wife there in the middle and I was looking around to see if I knew anybody and I think there's faces that look familiar but I don't know if I if I knew any sister Holly okay I know you I've known her since I was little I didn't see you over there God bless you I'm sorry you have to come out and hear me she's probably had enough of that throughout her life so but it's just good to be here this morning amen let's read a scripture and then I'll let you be seated and you know I have notes and I have scriptures and stuff but we want to do we want to place all this before the Lord you know maybe you have thoughts of what you might need this morning but we want to place that before the Lord and let him give us what he knows we have need of amen and we want to have him speak the words that he would like to speak let's let's turn to Second Corinthians uh chapter two I had a thought on my heart for for about a week or so when brother Dan had asked me to come and brother Dan just a day or so ago the Lord just put a different thought on my heart so I'm just gonna go with that this morning and trust that it's the leading of the Lord if that's okay Second Corinthians chapter 2 and we'll just read two verses and we'll let you have your seats verse 14 and verse 15. for second Corinthians chapter 2 it says now thanks be unto God which always causeth us to Triumph in Christ and maketh manifest the savior of his knowledge By Us in every place for we how many is that talking to you about this morning for we are unto God a sweet saver of Christ in them that are saved and in them that perish you may be seated man I don't know what you think about yourself this morning maybe you have been a Christian a long time maybe you have not been a Christian for maybe a year maybe you don't even consider yourself to be a Christian maybe you're just trying to find the Lord but I want you to know what God thinks about you what God thinks about you is that you to him are a sweet saver you say well when I become a good Christian brother that's not what that scripture says when I deserve to be thought about that way by God that's not what it says you are a sweet saver to God undeserved undeservedly so that's the grace that's the God that I serve that's the grace that he's bestowed upon us is that despite myself he looks at me as I'm a reward I'm I'm something that he purchased and he bought and paid for you know brother bran would say if I had a cup with the blood of Jesus here with a drop of the blood it would be something we would just we would just take and and make it sacred and just and just think so highly of it but he said about have something greater here this morning which is the purchase of that blood and I don't know if you've ever thought about that but but God values you above the blood of his own son that he would take that blood and he would buy you with that blood if that could ever drop down into really truly drop down into our hearts it wouldn't just change us from a sinner into a saint it would change everything about us it would change the way that we we look at one another it would change the way that we talk to one another it would change the way that we look at a sinner it would it would change the way we look at one but talk to One treat one amen if that really would drop down and I and I don't know anyone here so I I Lord knows that I can't really not going to preach at anybody brother Dan you know I just just so if you take it personal it wasn't personal you know I I always feel safe just talking to myself just preaching to myself I feel safe there because I know that this word no matter if it cuts it applies I can apply it to myself you know I talked about you know asking for distractions I I had distractions this morning that I had to pray that Lord would you just remove those out of the way you know the minister or the pastor or they're not exempt from this I don't believe the prophet was exempt from that we want to set ourselves aside for service amen and I just read that scripture if we could read another one I hope it's okay I just have a few scriptures this morning like I said I have some notes here but we want to just put these all in the Lord's hands amen would that be okay let's turn over to uh the book of uh The Book of Luke in chapter 7 of that book and this is just a subject that you know I listened to listen to a lot of messages throughout my life but there's some messages that oh it's hard to say you have a favorite but I'm sure maybe some of us have a favorite and and there's a story that brother Brown tells he reads from the Bible and he dramatizes this story and I don't know why brother Dan but it's just always been something that's just impacted me uh just so heavily and maybe it's because I find myself in that story and when you find yourself in a story in a Bible because I don't believe the Bible is just a collection of fables I believe that there are events that happen and when you find yourself an event that happens in the Bible then you can see how you turn out you can see what the Lord is capable of doing in your life today in 2023 when I find myself in this story in the Bible and I see how it turned out I can say Lord You've laid down a formula for me to follow and if I follow that formula I know what'll happen in the end and so Luke chapter seven and and this should be familiar to us but I just want to read through this and it's a few verses here but if you don't mind we'll just read a little scripture Luke 7 36 it says in one of the Pharisees decide desired that he would eat with him and he went into the Pharisees house and sat down to meet and behold a woman in the city which was a sinner when she knew that Jesus sat at me in the Pharisees house brought an alabaster box of ointment and stood At His Feet behind him weeping and began to wash his feet with tears and did wipe them with the hairs of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment and when the Pharisee which had been in him saw it he spake within himself saying this man if he were a prophet would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him for she is a sinner you can see how the Pharisee was viewing this sinner and Jesus answered and said on him Simon I have somewhat to say unto thee and he said Master say on there was a certain creditor which had two debtors and one owed 500 Pence and the other 50. and when they had nothing to pay he frankly forgave them both tell me therefore which of them will love him the most and Simon answered and said I suppose that he to whom he forgave most and he said unto him thou Hast rightly judged and he turned to the woman and said unto Simon see us thou this woman I entered into thine house and thou gavest me no water for my feet but she has washed my feet with tears and wiped them with the hairs of her head and thou gavest me no kiss but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet my head with oil thou didst not anoint but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment wherefore I say unto thee her sins which were our many are forgiven for she loved much but to whom little Is Forgiven the same loveth little that's a little study and if we have a love problem maybe we should go to this scripture and he said unto her thy sins are forgiven it's one thing to read in the Bible when Jesus says that he has forgiven the sins of a sinner as he's talking to Simon he tells him her sins are many and they're forgiven and it's another thing when he turns directly to you and he tells you that you know I hear a lot I I we read the message we read the Bible and it's so good to hear the message and good so good to hear the Bible but when it becomes personal to you it's a different message and it's a different Bible when it's not just said to a church to a group of people I believe in church I believe in gathering as a group of people but this message in this Bible was sent to individual hearts and when this Bible and this message become individually received by you I'm telling you it's a different Bible and they sat at me and they that sad at me begin to say within themselves who is this that forgive us sins also and he said to the woman thy faith has saved thee go in peace and you think you know I I find myself in that story and you might ask where I find myself and well the obvious answer is I find myself in the place of that sinner I find myself in the place of that woman who did not deserve the forgiveness but she got it anyways and you say when did you find yourself in that place brother when you gave your heart to the Lord no this morning this morning when I found myself doing saying or thinking something that wasn't from God you know a lot of times we take these you know maybe you've maybe you've had a moment where you come to Christ he said brother I gave my heart to the Lord years ago and sometimes that just saying that Lord I gave my heart to him years ago but what about this morning you know maybe he wants to do something new for you today and I don't know what your situation is maybe you haven't given your heart to the Lord but I know that today is a new day today isn't yesterday today isn't the day I first gave my heart to Lord today's a day that he wants to receive that from me again he wants to take from me what I've done wrong what I've thought wrong what I've said wrong again this morning he wants to take it and say son today your sins are forgiven you don't have to rely on your experience from years ago from months ago or for maybe decades ago you don't need to rely on that even though I was there with you today I can give you a new experience with me today I can give you a new Deliverance with me today I can give you a new heart just give me your old one and you know you know for for the somebody that's maybe a sinner who's just coming to church they can hear that and said that brother that makes sense that makes sense I want to give my heart to the Lord but you know it's hard sometimes for us that and I say you know again I don't know your situation so this is this is without bias this morning I don't know your situation or how long you've served the Lord but it's hard for us sometimes that have served the Lord for a little while to get to the point where we can give him our heart again this morning you know sometimes we're relying on that manna from yesterday not knowing that today there's a fresh Manna available that I can't just I can't live on my experience from yesterday today I need a fresh experience for the Holy Ghost today and it doesn't take away from our experience of yesterday but God has something new for you this morning I'll read another scripture if that's okay about this you know it's not the same story but I just love that I love that the Lord you know maybe this this act meant so much to him that it's in the Bible you know in a couple different ways let's turn over to John if you don't mind this morning and I'm if you haven't figured it out already I'm not much of a Preacher uh you know there's definitely more uh Brothers with just more of that gift and that skill but you know what I love the Lord and I love sharing with you what he's done for me and if that's all I could do this morning then I believe that we've accomplished what the Lord wants us to do amen is this this water mine over here I'm Gonna Take It you doing okay this morning I know sometimes it's boy if you're uncomfortable you should you should know how I feel right now but you know it's something about gathering with those that have the same Faith as you and the same the same goal in mind amen where we're going where we're headed to and and that is something that's comforted me uh brother Dan that no matter where you go that spirit is the same that Spirit of the Bride is the same amen let's turn over to John 12. and let's read a story that's similar to this if we could John 12 verse verse 1 says in Jesus six days before the Passover came to Bethany where Lazarus which was uh was which had been dead whom he raised from the dead there they had made him a supper and Martha served but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him and then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard very costly I don't think there's a there's a wasted word in the Bible so if it says that this was costly there's a reason why it says that an anointed the feat of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair and listen now and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment and brother Brandon preaches on this this other woman he says that this oil this oil was so costly and he describes how this oil was made about from the little bud of a flower and how they grind it up and they crush it up and they put it in this oil and it was very costly you know I I did a little bit of research I wouldn't say too much but a little bit of research and and somewhere in today's money value this oil costs there's there's estimations between 20 and 50 thousand dollars in today's money I I we won't get into politics it's probably worth much more than that today that was that was a that was a political I'd say I wouldn't get into it but you got it maybe that's why the estimates range so far brother Dan from 20 to 50 000 it's like the same amount of money today but anyways twenty thousand dollars picture that twenty thousand dollars to go and purchase this to pour it on Jesus's feet now you could say now we look at the story and we say well brother that that that makes perfect sense if I were there I would have bought that oil and I would have poured it on his feet and whenever I catch myself doing that with a with a Bible story I I immediately asked myself but what am I doing today am I doing that same thing today and if I'm if I'm not doing it today I most likely would not be doing it back in the Bible brother I would never I would never talk like some of the people in the Bible talk behind Jesus's back but you know if we're doing that today we would be doing it back then well brother I would not doubt the Miracles I would see somebody brought to life I would not doubt who Jesus is but if we're doing that today we would have done it back then Lord I would have love for everyone all the disciples all those all the people around me I would have love for the Romans but if we're not doing it today we wouldn't have done it back then and he poured it out on his feet and I love this the odor of this perfume it was so strong it says you know they were there to it says there that they were there to eat now I imagine that house smelled pretty good I imagine that the food cooking and the aroma of that food just filled that house you know like when mom makes food when your wife makes food when you just have good good home cooking but this perfume was so strong this oil that it it covered all that up and it says the odor of it just filled the whole house and there's something about that that just I don't it just grabs my attention about how special and how just how special this oil was and that this and that this this sister would would think there's nothing too great for me to give to God do you mind if we read another scripture about the same thing you know I don't believe the Bible has any contradictions do you know when I read another when I read when I read the Bible and it's it it has another perspective of the same story and maybe they don't exactly align you know I think maybe that was just uh that brother was in another corner of the room looking at it from another Direction amen you know and I've brought this example up maybe several times I think brother Dana brought it up in that ministers meeting but sometimes uh perspective makes a big difference and how we treat somebody that has another perspective than us I you know I don't even know what's on that front of that Pulpit brother Dan is it a cross but but I can't see no there's no cross on this pulpit nope is there a cross well you know what you're off the word brother I'm looking at it and there's no cross on this pulpit perspective and and what I do with you really says more about me how I treat you for having a different perspective of this object how much more the Bible how much more the message how much more the word of God when somebody sees something that we don't agree with how do we treat them while they're wrong they're wrong but it's just it's not it's not there I've looked in the message I've looked in the Bible I just can't find it it's not there maybe it's just a perspective yeah and you know sometimes the Lord has has brought somebody through a trial that you haven't been through and through that trial through that experience they have a different perspective of God that maybe we need to have or maybe we should say you know what I'm going to accept the way you look at it and I'm going to treat you as though you are a child of God and if we're doing it today we would have done it back then and so I look at this story it's in Matthew 26 it's another perspective of the same story Matthew 26 verse 6. I'll I'll try to try to move forward a little bit so I don't keep you here too long now in Jesus verse 6 of chapter 26 Matthew when Jesus was in Bethany the house of Simon the leper there came unto him a woman the other one says it was Mary now a woman comes to him having an hour bastard box a very precious ointment and poured it on his head as he sat at me the other one said he poured it on his feet do I think the Bible contradicts itself no I gotta dig deeper into the word to find out where these connect when the disciples saw it now now they didn't talk about this in the other scripture when the disciples saw it they had indignation saying to what purpose is this waste for this ointment might have been sold for much and given to the poor we could have sold that for fifty thousand dollars and maybe uh fixed up the church a little bit or maybe paid for some right that's what they were thinking and when Jesus understood it he said unto them why trouble ye the woman for she hath wrought a good work upon me for ye have the poor always with you but me you have not always for in that she poured this ointment on my body she did it for my burial she didn't even know why she was doing it he said but she didn't know that six days later he would be marched up to Calvary and listen to this this I love this verse now verily I say to you wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world what this woman has done will be told for a memorial of her and here we are two thousand years later talking about a woman who went and anointed Jesus's feet two thousand years later you know what we're doing we're still talking about what she did you know what Jesus is saying to her he's saying what you have done to me I will never forget think about that being able to do something for the Lord that he would never forget is that your desire that's my desire not for me not to do it so that I'm not know that he would remember me that he would know who I am I wonder what kind of what kind of service we would have if our desire was truly to do something for the Lord that he would never forgive to do the Lord a service that's what he wants and yet there was disciples standing by these disciples walked with him they cast out devils they healed the sick they watched him raise people from the dead and when they saw this woman come and pour this ointment on his feet they stood by with indignation not on me to yell at you but but I got to include myself in this message have I been have I had indignation when I've seen somebody come to the Lord and do something for him that maybe I didn't think they deserved to do that maybe I thought well if anybody was to annoying his feet it should be me I'm I'm a I'm a believer I'm a disciple who is this woman that come in and wasting the soil indignation is how they looked at this and you say oh well that's you know that's the disciples can I tell you something you know when we read when we read the Bible scripture and this is you could you could say I don't really do this but I don't know when we read the Bible scriptures and there's characters in these Bibles uh I think almost all the time in our mind we start putting faces on those characters right okay we just read a story about a Pharisee and a woman and Jesus and onlookers and a lot of times if we're not careful we'll start putting a face of a person that we know on that Pharisee you ever done that I'm the only one you ever you ever heard a message preached and you preach it in your mind to somebody else that's the best way I could I could I could say that you hear something you go oh brother I know who needs to hear that brother Dan if they were only here this morning I'll have to tell them to go listen to the message you ever given somebody a tape oh if they can only hear this tape brother Brown just hit so again right sometimes we we preach a message that's preached to somebody else when God's saying no no no I wanted you to hear it I wanted you to hear oh no Lord I don't I don't struggle with this I don't struggle with that but the Lord said no no I sent that message to be preached to you and you're sitting here I ordain the whole thing it's for you but I you know that's okay that's a hard pill to swallow right and I want to tell you what if you want to read the Bible in a new way now I'm young I don't know how to tell all of you how to read the Bible but here's something you could try you know that instead of you know I call it casting the roles you have the roles of the character you have the indignant Pharisee over here you have the humble woman washing his feet you know I think a lot of times we put ourselves as the humble sinner right it's okay if you don't say man it's all right sometimes we put ourselves oh brother just like I told you oh I I identify with that sinner right who came to Jesus but you know what I'm also that Pharisee that hurts sometimes I'm also that indignant disciples sometimes you know sometimes when you haven't been close to the Lord sister I enjoyed that special about praying maybe when you haven't prayed to the Lord and you see somebody else getting blessed you ever get a little indignant about it you ever wonder why someone else deserves to be blessed and you see them go they're not even living brother brother Dan they don't even go to church all the time now I know this is true you don't have to I know it's true they don't even make every service I don't miss a service and I see them over there getting blessed they probably don't even pray as hard as I do and they're the over getting you know what we're doing there's a Pharisee spirit that we have to battle and that we have to defeat you say oh brother I defeated that Spirit no no it's a daily battle it's a daily battle to get rid of that that Pharisee inside or that disciple inside I said Lord I've been a message believer for 10 years and somebody can just come in and get no I don't think we would ever say this right but sometimes our attitude says this indignant and if it's not true then I don't know why it would be in the Bible you know the Bible isn't just stories I don't think it's coincidence it's in the Bible to show us what we have to battle against right but he wants a service done for him I just I just want to just stay on that point though where you know I wonder if I wonder what kind of people I would we would be I'll just point it to myself I wonder what kind of Christian I would be if you know those that I disagree with and disagree with me if I would start putting them as that sinner that was forgiven you know maybe some of you doesn't just see the message just the way that I see it maybe it's just perspective they just don't see it they're different way and I put them as the disciple I put them as the Pharisee I put them out there what if I started to put them as The Sinner who is Forgiven and then put myself in the place of the critic I bet you it would change the way that we do things I bet you we would change the way that I speak to that person fellowship with that person that's a hard one wouldn't you want to fellowship with someone who had been forgiven by Jesus I sure would but in order to not fellowship with somebody and this is this is going to cut but this is the truth in order to not fellowship with somebody who doesn't believe just like you you know you actually have to de-christianize them in your mind that that's that's hard but that's the truth you have to actually in your in your in your thoughts in your mind say you know what they're just not there Lord if you would just help them be there if you just help them see it and the Lord is saying I want you to see something I want you to change because you listen now you were not looking for him when he found you you weren't you said oh I was seeking god brother I was at the end of my rope no he led he drew you to him what brought you to the end of your rope he did what brought you to desperation that without him you would have died he brought you there if I serve God it's because he's called me to serve him and allowed me to serve him and chosen me to serve him not because I decided to if there's any good thing that we do it's him and if we if we can't see that we'll become an indignant disciple think about that since when has the feet of Jesus become a place where you could get mad at somebody for going to since when is the altar call been a place where just new people come to no I'm just getting brother Dan I hope it's okay to say but I I think I think who needs to be at the altar the most are ministers pastors evangelists 40-year Christians 30-year Christians 20-year Christians that's who needs to be at the altar that's who needs to be there the most The Sinner The Sinner doesn't have a problem doing that why because they know they're wrong and they come and they hear the word of God and something convicts them and it Pricks their heart but sometimes our heart gets so Stony after we become a Christian for a long time that God's trying to prick our heart and it's just it's just Stone because we're good because we're saved because we're message Believers now I'm not trying to make you anything that you're not I believe you're a believer but God is trying to do something new for you today and I think Lord willing I think we'll read about that but I tell you I want to do something that God will remember for all time and you know it's just a it's to do a service for him now you could go and I would encourage you to go listen to the message doing God of service without being his will brother Brown walks you through the five must-haves in order to do something for God but let me read you what he says in in beyond the curtain of time he says there's one thing I want to be honest with you about the thing listen now I keep I apologize I'll stop anybody pray for healing and are waiting on that healing do you want you want a formula to receive that healing he says I want to be honest with you the thing the way that God heals is on the basis of service to him you know I believe that his stripes healed you they healed you but in order to accept the healing he's waiting for a service to be done for him you know that he had that forgiveness for that for that woman he had that forgiveness for her all along but what was he waiting for a service to be done he had told Simon her sins are forgiven he hadn't even told her yet Simon her sins there are many but she's loved much and then he turns her and say your sins are forgiven but he was waiting for a service to be done he says that's the way God heals is on the basis of service to him see it's on the basis of service to him he says it twice we must accept our healing on the basis that we will serve him after we're healed now the Bible says confess your faults one to another pray for one another that you might be healed see it's on the basis that you'll serve God I wonder why you know I I wonder why we have to confess our faults to one another isn't it easier I know the answer to the question but I'm just going to ask you isn't it easier just to confess them to God and say Lord I'm sorry I've done this I'm sorry but when I have to go to brother Dan and say brother Dan this is what I was saying about somebody today this was the thought that ran through my mind today no those that we all want to tell each other that right that's hard to that sister that's hard to do right because you know why because we have built up an image of ourself as a Christian and to tell somebody that you've done something that you think is terrible is to try to tear that image down a little bit when that's exactly what God wants you to do I I just preach to myself because that's true I have a hard time confessing my faults to somebody else you know when I tell it to God I don't have to see God's face and his reaction in ways it's easier to tell God what you've done wrong it is to tell somebody else and that's exactly why the Bible says confess it to somebody else he says but you know there's something inside of her telling her to go in she wanted to do a service for Jesus and if you're wanting to do a service for Jesus there ain't enough Bishops and Cardinals on Earth to stop you from getting in his presence you say brother there's not Bishops and Cardinals on Earth I'll tell you where the Bishops and Cardinals are at right here again I could I could put a face to that or I could put my my face on that and say you know what stops me from going and and and before the feet of Jesus Is Me I'm the Cardinal I'm the bishop I'm the self-righteous the two holy to go and be off the altar I'm not trying to get you to come to the altar that's that's not what this is about but but but what stops us from doing a service to God Is Us that's right there ain't enough denomination and hypocrites in the country to do it or enough devils and hell to stop you from doing it if you're wanting to do a service for Jesus and I want to tell you this that that go that I want to say this in the right way but you know a lot of times we come to service we come to church service but are we really doing a service for him what are you doing Sunday morning 10 o'clock oh I'm going to service that's good but are you doing a service for him am I doing a service or or have I just done my duty by coming to church on Sunday coming my coming to church on Wednesday coming to church Sunday night read my Bible once a day praying once a day have I just done my duty to him or does he want more I I believe that the message is the truth is that enough it's not enough I know that's I know that's I know sometimes that's hard to hear right because I'm not I'm not I would never stand up here and tell you that those things aren't the right thing to do they are the right thing to do but you know if I would just realize that that God has so much more so much more I'll tell you this is just this isn't deep this is just about as simple as it gets but but you know the simple things are the hard things to do the simple things you know I'm gonna read this this um we're doing okay I actually I I have a watch and I have this and I still forgot to look at the clock before I started I want to read this quote if you can because I I this came on my heart so strong last night I had to search took me a little while to find it and then this morning here it is I won't tell you the whole thing but this morning the Lord used this quote to straighten me out this morning here I am I'm going to come and and minister to to a group of Believers and the Lord's like not right now you're not nope I I got some changing I need to do on you this morning and he says this it's in the Great Commission this is one of my favorite quotes and I I remembered how he said it but I had to go look it up and he says you know if you want to be a blessing and get a blessing when a man has done you wrong and he absolutely justly I mean he has done you wrong and you know that he's done you wrong he's done you evil don't mention that that means you don't call up someone and say I'm going to tell you I'm going to tell you something I need you to pray for this brother or sister right that's like another way to gossip let me tell you about this brother and then would you pray for him but no brother I'm saying don't do that he says don't mention that you take him to prayer before God and don't take this in a way of just selfish and say well I'm supposed to do this but stand with your shoulder to his shoulder and stand in the presence of God our Father the way a prayer should be made in that presence and say father here's my brother and he is justly he deserves punishment because he has done me evil and I don't see why he did it and then let God go to talking to you and you'll see maybe what that man's been through and the devil has Twisted him up somewhere and caused him to do that and though he's absolutely wrong before you leave the Throne of God you'll be feeling sorry for that man you'll be sympathizing with that brother when you get back down here to Earth you'll go over to that brother and shake his hand because you know what he's been through now listen you cannot stand with a mortal in the presence of God and condemn anybody I don't believe no sir even a rank sinner you know I I've said you know we we we talk about the presence of God and certainly when we have a worship service you can feel it even this morning you feel his presence come down when we hear a word of God preach his presence comes but I wonder how many of us has actually entered into a presence of God because if I look at myself and if I'm condemning somebody I can tell you by the word of God I'm not in his presence now his presence might be all over the building it might be healing this person it might be performing a miracle but if I have a condemning Spirit towards somebody I can tell you this I haven't entered into that presence I might pray every day I might read my Bible every day but if I'm starting to condemn even a rank sinner I'll tell you what I'm not in the presence of God and that presence of God is what brings out the life that's in US you know I I always think about Aaron's Rod you know Aaron's Rod was used so many times by Moses and Aaron to perform Miracles right stretch out your rod and this will happen touch this and with your rod and this will happen that Rod was used in service to God but still had to come into the holiest of holies in order for uh for for life to come forth from what was a dead stick life had to come why it had to come into the presence of God to get rid of that condemning Spirit to get rid of that self-righteous spirit that Pharisee Spirit it had to come into the presence of God before it really even though it had been used by God before it could actually become part of God and have a life of God had to come into His presence that's what I want this morning Lord remove from me anything that inhibits me from coming into your presence this morning and uh oh Lord take away my sin but take away my judgment of The Sinner the more you get there now I'm not brother Brown's not calling wrong right he's he's saying that brother was wrong but taken before the Lord and watched the Lord start to talk to you watch the Lord's her say you know what you think he's the Pharisee in the story but he's not he's The Sinner what are you going to be you know there's a lot of there's a lot of that of of that that sinner who washed his feet there's a lot of that in me you know there's a lot of prodigal son in me now I don't know about you there's a lot of you know a lot of times there's a little doubting Thomas in there it's easy to say oh doubting Thomas I know who that is yeah it's me you know what about what about the ungrateful leper there's a lot of that in me sometimes I battle we read the Bible about a man possessed cutting himself we battled that and God is trying to teach us through his word that those those Temptations those weaknesses they lie in US and if you say no no they don't lie in me watch out he might he might take you through a little trial so he can bring you up on the other side and say look without me you would be that man cutting himself without me you would be that sinner without me you would be that Pharisee without me you would be that Prodigal Son and Not only would be you were you were that I just want to move forward if that's okay we're just to read another well you know I really wanted to talk about I it took so long to get there really wanted to talk about this this Alabaster Box and maybe maybe I'll just do this in in the closing part of this you know the alabaster boxes it's in both stories and it's a box that that contained the oil and and brother Brown goes into how much that cost and he says they took that Alabaster Box and they and they poured it on his feet and I started to think okay let's let's look into the alabaster a little bit and and again just doing a little bit of research I'm not the expert in Alabaster but it's it's actually made of uh of a material brother Dan that's it's similar to gypsum and and and calcium or calcite it's actually it's actually not valuable it's very common but the reason why it was used we just get a little history lesson here if that's okay the reason why I was used is because you could easily form it into what you wanted you could take this you could take this Alabaster and and there's still pieces and museums that have lasted thousands of years of this Alabaster so it's durable in one sense but in other sense you could start to carve on it you could start to you could you could make it into a real nice ornament and then I've seen some of the stuff they've done and you think there's no way they carved that from this but they it's it's pliable it's soft and it's also capable of holding in this oil and not letting no free smells you can't go into the shop where they sell the oil and get a free smell this Alabaster could hold in that precious ointment that costs so much and keep it fresh keep it secure and you know I I want to make the point that this the reason why this this service for Jesus was so costly was not because of the alabaster it was because of the ointment that was inside of it and as long as you take this Alabaster Box for the day and you keep it safe and you keep it protected it will last and keep that oil fresh it'll hold it for weeks years even decades and it will be fresh and he said that's that's pretty good but I want you to know that the alabaster is another character in this story the alabaster box and it's me you say well brother I'm I'm The Sinner yes you're also The Sinner but that Alabaster Box it's you it's your heart it's it's your image as a believer in a Christian it holds in the precious oil of the Holy Spirit it contains it now I don't know if you've had an experience with the Lord I don't know I don't know hardly anybody here so I can't speak for you but if you've had an experience with the Lord and he's filled you with his holy spirit that's what's holding it if you haven't had an experience with the Lord you know he wants to give it to you more than you want to have it the problem is is that the alabaster box sometimes has become more valuable than the oil that it holds and when I look at myself I I don't I'm not judging you I'm judging myself as somebody who has has been a believer for most of their life the longer we are believers and the longer we are Christians the more beautiful and decorative that box gets the more we start to carve on it rather Dan and make it into what we think a Christian should look like set some gems in the corners I don't think any of us give us any credit right we don't give ourselves credit but sometimes the way that I act I act like somebody who forgot where God took them from I act and I see a sinner at his feet and think they don't deserve to be there now maybe that's just me and maybe this is for me this morning but the longer I'm a Christian the more this box gets carved and decorated and it looks better and better the longer I'm a Christian and you know this is I hope this is okay but this is not a problem for the center off the street it's not a problem for them they might have a different problem but this is a problem for the seasoned believer this is a problem for the veteran believer this is a problem for those of us that maybe gave our heart to the Lord years and years ago that's who that's who struggles with this problem that's the problem of pride you know rarely is a sinner proud but Christians are proud that Pharisee Spirit gets in there starts to make you feel puffed up will you see where the Lord has taken you from and if for a moment I forget that it's not because of me I start to feel good about myself I start to feel a little oh you know what I'm doing good that's a mistake right there Lord if I if I fall today Lord would you be gracious to pick me up the longer you're a Christian the longer your image as one gets more and more perfected and honed but but God doesn't want that kind of Christian he doesn't want that because he doesn't want the alabaster box he wants the ointment inside the alabaster box what is that ointment it's my service it's my service to him it's my Mercy for somebody it's my grace for somebody it's my forgiveness for that person who has done me absolutely wrong and as long as it's held inside it will stay there for years and years and I'll sit in a Pew and I'll come to service service in service out sing songs and my alabaster box juice gets more and more ornate and beautiful but that's not what God wants you'd be okay if I I don't want to spill some of this water but I'll drink some of it so the the folks that clean the church don't have a big mess but he don't I think that sometimes I just preached myself a little bit but I think sometimes when I come this is I serve God like this there's a little bit of that ointment a little bit of that oil oh lord it's it's so costly brother Dan I don't want to use it all up this is just a regular Sunday right it's not a special service it's not meetings I barely made it today right you know what I mean you know what I mean I barely made it here today brother I'm gonna I'm gonna hold that in I'm gonna hold it and sometimes we come to the feet of Jesus and we do this there you go Lord a little bit of oil I I tell you I've been guilty of that there's another there's another uh perspective of this story in mark 14 3 says and being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper he sat at me and there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious and she broke the Box she broke the box and poured it on his head brother Ram talks about this woman in that Pharisees house and he said she didn't just give him a little bit of this oil he said she she poured it all she poured all the oil a drop of that oil just to drop would have made that whole house smell and yet she took I hate to get your floor wet brother Dan she said Lord you get all of it all of it break the Box that's how I want to serve him that's how I want to serve him this morning and you could say oh brother that sounds good but do we do it do we do it do we take ourself that image the image of ourself that we've built up we've built up as a Christian as a message believer and do we just crack it open a little bit and go here you go Lord I'll give you back a little bit of what you gave me but I better keep this other one in we got meetings coming up and oh you know what Lord I'll give it all to you at those meetings he doesn't want that that's not the kind of believer he wants that's not the kind of service that God wants the kind of service he wants is for you to take everything that you are both good and bad and break it and break it I don't you know I I know that the Lord has done things for you but he today wants to take that image of you and break it you have to do that you have to Lord I come to you and Lord you saved me so many years ago yeah but today you are a sweet smelling Savor to him if he can save you today and I think so many times we're we're operating off of an experience from yesterday or many yesterdays ago when today and Lord we bring our we bring ourselves to church I know I do I bring myself to church as a holy Christian as a good message believer and that's not what the Lord wants you know what the Lord wants a broken and contrite heart he doesn't want an alabaster box that's not what's valuable although it's it's pliable and although it's ornate and all these things but we spread that service sometimes over a few Services over a few months you know sometimes we get that oil we spread it over years and years oh I'm almost out of it when when the Lord's saying yeah but I get I got a fresh refilling for you today a fresh refilling of the Holy Spirit today you don't need you don't need to rely on the Manna From Yesterday although I gave it to you and I fed you and I brought you to this point but today I have fresh Manna for you today I have fresh oil from you but the problem is is I don't have any room for it because everything he's given me I haven't used it up yet I haven't given him my service I haven't given him My Worship I haven't given them my whole heart I've been holding forgiveness back from somebody and then wonder why I don't get filled sometimes with the Holy Spirit I see somebody over here getting blessed and I see somebody over here where you know the Lord's working with him he said Lord I want some of that and the Lord's saying your box it's full your box is full with what I did for you yesterday but I want to do something new for you today and I can't because you have to come to me at my feet and break it and you know what she had to break it so that not one drop brother random says not one drop was wasted every single drop went on his feet was it too much it was a lot but that's what God wanted that's the kind of service that Jesus wanted he doesn't want he doesn't want your image as a Christian he wants what's inside there he wants your heart he wants your service he wants your forgiveness I I keep going back to that but when I'm withholding forgiveness from somebody who has done me wrong I haven't been in his presence you could say oh Lord I'm doing your service but I'm telling you you're not doing a service to him you might be doing service to a man to a Doctrine to a church to yourself to a family but you're not doing a service for God because if you are coming in the presence of God you couldn't condemn anybody and all that tells me is that Pharisee even though he was sitting there next to Jesus wasn't in his presence because all he thought was what kind of woman is that and those disciples even though they had walked with him they hadn't really been in his presence right then which we know they had to go to an upper room they really hadn't been in his presence because they looked down at Mary who's washing his feet and get indignant about it can I I'll read you a quote and I'll finish is that okay this is so this is broken up and but it's just it it is what it is he says the thing of it was now I carry this this quote with me everywhere because I just love it he says the thing of it was was not how she was gonna get there because right away when you want to do a service for God all the obstacles start popping up in your place right and I'm gonna tell you who puts those obstacles there you do you say oh the devil okay what does he do well I don't you know brother Dan I don't want somebody to think that that I'm not a good Christian no you think that somebody else doesn't think that brother Dan I remember being a service where a man that I respected as a minister went down to the Altar and was out the altar longer than anybody else you know what I had more respect for him not less respect I never thought once oh what is he doing down there what has he done wrong I thought there's somebody I can have confidence in that's somebody who has taken the image of himself and said Lord my image as a minister as a Christian as a believer that doesn't matter I just want more of you and Lord to get more of you I need to pour out every single thing that you've given me not just pour it out I need to break this image of myself that I've built up he says not how she was going to get there she didn't care how she was going to get there you know this woman she didn't care what anybody thought about her and I know this is a simple message but I'm telling you the thing that stops us from doing a service from God is we care too much about what someone else thinks [Music] that I that's that's the truth we care too much about what somebody else thinks she was going to make an effort to get there he says I can see her elbowing her way through the crowd what crowd the church crowd right the church crowd that's who she was going through there's nothing that's going to stop me from getting to the feet of Jesus if I really want to get there he says no matter what she he says no matter what said or who said it she was on her road to meet Jesus he says do you do that would you elbow your way through the differences in the world today could you elbow your way through over the vulgarity and over the picture shows and the dancing and the carry-on that you do calling yourself a Christian to get to Jesus you say brother I don't I don't I don't I don't go dancing I don't go in there say okay that's fine could you lay down aside all your worldly social entertainment to come to the Lord Jesus to be entertained by him brother I don't struggle with social media I don't struggle with social I'm a Christian I've been a Christian a long time okay there's more she elbowed her right way through she was gonna get there regardless of how vile she was you are never ever too vile to go to the feet of Jesus and I'll tell you this too we're never too good that we don't need to be there as well I think sometimes that's a problem I think sometimes it's not that we think that we're too vile it's not that we think that we're too good to be there I know it was out of order here's another one here's another one that keeps us I know it was out of order he says God help us to get out of order every once in a while the trouble of it is this is his words now not my words the trouble of it is you got too much order now I can come into a church and I can preach this because I don't know what problems are in the church right yeah you could get mad at me but I don't know if we have too much order if we have too little every church has something right but if that's what it is he says the problem is you got too much order God help you to get out of order once in a while the troubled of is you got too much get out of order I hope the church gets out of order long enough to get saved oh that's good he says I remember when Jesus saved me he says I'll never forget it this little old Kentucky heart of mine was jumping 90 miles an hour he goes I wept I cried I shouted I didn't care who was standing around most of all I didn't care about this person who said don't do that that's the one that stops me I didn't care what this Pharisee what this bishop said I didn't care I wasn't paying attention to order I was in the presence of Jesus and she wasn't noticing how much order she was in or how much order she was out of the main thing was to get to Jesus to get to his feet and there he sat with dirty feet he sat without being kissed he wasn't welcome and she wanted to make him welcome she didn't care about the old pharisaical orders about the old traditions and nominations she pressed her way through to get to Jesus and God help us to have a Revival like that where men and women right I could put somebody else's face right there oh brother I know what church needs to hear that right oh I know what brother in the church or sister needs to hear that no right here where men and women will elbow their way through the crowds and the denominations and the barriers until they get to the presence of Jesus I don't know what to tell you do you want to do that kind of service for him or do you want to just continue just church on Sunday church on Wednesday sing three songs brother don't sing five songs that's too much right Don't Preach an hour and five minutes I've probably been an hour and five minutes don't pre that's too long brother or do we want to do a service for him oh brother I'll fellowship with you as long as you believe the message the way I believe it or do you want to do a service for him oh God thank you for where you've brought me from I'm so glad I'm not like that person over there or do you want to do a service for him do you want to take what where he's brought you and and this you want to take this box this box and break it and I don't care how young you are or how old you are this message applies that's the beautiful thing about the message it applies and and I could take this and say Lord have I broken my image to you today maybe I broke it yesterday maybe I broke it last week but have I taken who I am and said Lord I'm nothing I'm nothing this is bower heads the heavenly father Lord you you know father maybe that these are just broken words Lord are mixed up words Lord but I pray that they're from you Lord that Lord you would take something Lord from your word from your Bible Lord and you would reveal it to the heart this morning Lord of somebody somebody who wants to do a service for you Lord somebody to who maybe your feet has been a strange place but they want to get to know it again Lord Lord maybe your presence is something that they've enjoyed but really haven't entered into lately Lord that maybe they Lord me holding back forgiveness for somebody Lord I want to enter into your presence Lord I want to do a service for you Lord and Lord maybe that service for you Lord is for me to forgive that person Lord Lord maybe they've done me wrong absolutely wrong Lord but lord I can't do his service for you Lord as long as that's in the way Lord I don't know who this message was two or four Lord but I know it applies to me father Lord I've built up a an image Lord a beautiful statue a beautiful box container Lord that's just Lord it means nothing without you Lord it has no value in it Lord I want that full surrender that lies inside of that box Lord I don't want to serve you out of Duty Lord I don't want to serve you because the message says to Lord I want to serve you because I love you Lord enough I love you Lord just show me show me as you have today Lord what it is I need to do Lord neither do I want to do a service for you without it being your will Lord I don't want to do what I want to do father I want to do what you want me to do Lord You're so gracious to us Lord You're so words can't describe Lord that you would be so merciful as to Time After Time show us in the word Lord where we've gone wrong Lord and not only where we've gone wrong Lord but show us that you've made a way out of that wrong Lord now Lord maybe I've maybe I've not handled something right maybe I've not thought about a person a Believer a brother a sister just right but Lord you've made a way out of that you've made a way for me to go and make that right Lord if it's something if it's a personal weakness Lord that I'm holding on to or somebody in here Lord just can't overcome Lord You've Made A Way and Lord that way is to do a service for you well I know these are just these are just words Lord but your word is all-powerful your word Lord is the truth Lord if there's a heart Lord if there's a heart that's just tired Lord of maintaining a Christian image Lord and wants more of you Lord that wants to pour it all out today Lord Lord would you just [Music] would you just recognize that Heart Lord by maybe a hand that would go up Lord our eyes are closed our heads are bowed Lord with somebody father say Lord I am tired of maintaining this image as a Christian Lord I need more of you and Lord if we've held in our worship Lord if we've held in our forgiveness Lord if we've held in what you've done for us would you just help us to pour that all out Lord and Lord I Believe by Your Word Lord you promised to be there in that moment Lord you would say I'll make you new again I'll form you the way I want you to be this morning and fill us Lord Lord we're not trying to work up any emotion father but lord it's genuine confession Lord one to another of Lord I need to be closer to you Lord I've had you Lord but I want more of you Lord I pray you would just do something new for those this morning that are just humble Lord Lord that are coming to you maybe we didn't come this morning with that attitude but if now Lord if you would just break us down lord I pray you would come to that heart this morning Lord and begin to mend them maybe a healing that they've been desperately praying for Lord and believing in Lord that you would say here's your healing you've done a service for me if it's a closer walk with you Lord would you give that to him this morning if it's Deliverance Lord would you give that to them this morning or we love you and we thank you Lord for this word we thank you for this message Lord we thank you for this Bible Lord we thank you for these Believers Lord that despite the day and age Lord are here this morning Lord believing having faith father [Music] we appreciate all you do Lord we love you we thank you in Jesus name we pray Amen brother Dan God bless you are you willing to break that Alabaster Box that box of ourselves and how we we garnish it and we take care of it and we look at ourselves are you willing to break it and say lord it's nothing this box of this life this human being is nothing Lord take the inside of me and I pray that every box that's here today would be filled with that oil of the Holy Spirit take that box of me as our brother said will you press through the crowds to get to the son of God if you're willing to press through those crowds one way to press through the crowd is to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ to show everyone I am not too good for anyone Lord I want to be baptized and I want everyone here to see that I will give my heart to you and my life will change this box is broken if you have a desire to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ go back and see brother sister Elizabeth and brother Ed if you can meet the those that would like to be baptized brother Ed if you could bring them all the way up my brother and help me up there and if there would be more and if you have been baptized that box needs to be broken every day and you watch when you break that box you watch that oil come out because it's brother Dan it's not about us it is not about this guy right here it is about the Lord Jesus Christ and what can I do for him and the only way I can serve him is if I serve his people he's God he doesn't need me he's a sovereign God but but by the grace of God he can use us for his glory if you have a desire to be baptized go back to the back brother Jonathan if you could lead us and a few songs of worship let me read Romans chapter 6 it says this verse 1 brother Jeremy if you could put it up moving into the baptismal service it says what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that Grace May abound God forbid how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein know ye not that so many of us as we're baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even though even so we also should walk in the newness of life that's what baptism represents brothers and sisters that this sinful man this Alabaster Box is broken and the oil of the holy spirit is going to come out God bless you draw me [Music] near a blessed Lord to the cross with [Music] that draw me need a blessed Lord to thy precious bleeding Sun
