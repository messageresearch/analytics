so i appreciate that brother tony ramirez had had fallen down within the last month and he had struck his head and just seemed like it was still causing some issues so he went and had an mri done and the results came back there was no injury no damage done so praising the lord for that but the testimony that he shared with me was he's retired now he was a truck driver for a long time and he remembered one of his co-workers it was his birthing just decided to give him a call and say happy birthday to him and they got to talking a little bit and he told brother tony he said you know my wife was a christian and all and he says and i i i remember you and all and and you being a christian in everything in the years we worked together and he goes and i gave my heart to the lord you know so brother tony says you know i never really said anything to you about it he goes i never preached at you or anything and this was his the man's testimony back to brother tony he said no but you lived a life you lived a sermon you never had to say a word he said now i know that same god he said because you lived a life before me so sometimes we think it's in vain but hey be a christian out

playing these instruments makes me feel old it's good to be in the house of the lord and i appreciate the invitation from brother watkins and the hospitality of uh brother guerra and the saints here god bless each and every one of you we bring greetings from the saints up north in northern arizona and they all i'm sure would love to be down here a little more frequently this time of year as we're getting to the cold weather but we're happy to beat them all to be here with you this evening god bless you uh if you while i have you standing if you wouldn't mind turning in your bibles with me to the book of mark chapter 2. i appreciate everybody's efforts to come out on a wednesday night that means a lot i'm certainly grateful that it was not announced that i would be here perhaps there wouldn't be so many so we're thankful for whoever would come to the house of the lord this evening to hear the word of god mark chapter 2 i just want to read two verses verse 11 and 12 jesus speaking says i say unto thee arise and take up thy bed and go thy way into thine house and immediately he arose took up the bed and went forth before them all in so much that they were all amazed and glorified god saying we never saw it on this fashion and may god had his blessing to his word if you wouldn't mind bowing your heads for a word of prayer our precious and lovely heavenly father lord we find it an honor lord to have health and sound minds to come into this house of prayer lord to be gathered under the name of jesus christ where you said where two or three would gather in that name you would be in our midst lord we're counting on that we rely upon that this evening we ask heavenly father that you would make yourself present here lord that there would be no spirit no evil spirit welcome in this place that are welcome to be dismissed from this place that lord if there'd be any sick if there'd be any infirmities and anyone here lord jesus we ask that you would come and do the same things you did while you walked the shores of galilee lord casting out the devil and his the evil spirit's lord and and bringing healing to the bodies of those that were sick and afflicted lord we ask that you would have the preeminence in this service that god you would teach us lord that we could sit at your feet and learn of you and lord that we would just leave this place drawn closer to you and more in love than we've ever been with you and lord we ask all these favors and all these blessings in jesus christ's name amen amen thank you you can have your seats uh this morning this morning this evening excuse me uh i'd like to speak i had a for a title a normal service and that may sound like a strange title sermon title but my thoughts are are geared many times toward the young people because i have young people for children now and i certainly do not desire them to grow up in church just for the sake of a tradition but i would desire for them to know the same jesus christ that i met about 21 years ago not just to come to a building um so that they can take a nap or um pass time but that the lord something for them that they would recognize was beyond man beyond what a preacher could do beyond what any man or woman could do in their own ability but that only god could do and so many a time i think of the question if you asked a young person the question how was church usually out of courtesy a young person will tell you it was fine and then if you follow up the question with well what did he preach about then it starts to get a little vague and you know the uh the the answer where they no they won't get in trouble is to say about jesus or about the bible and they can't lose usually there but many times as you get older and those of that have been going to a church so-called church for many many years uh you have probably if you've been around um and depending on which i suppose church service you've been in they don't always go so wonderful and they're not always um what you expected and and so then if you were to be honest with the question how was church your answer might not come out it was wonderful or um oh i learned so much it may not be that and that's what we want we want to be honest before god so that when we ask how was church then we know exactly what the question is and and we want the answer to be appropriate and so then the question is well what does it mean to go to church or what should a normal church service look like and so i just want to spend a little bit of time and i'm going to be very mindful of my time it's wednesday night and i know for those of you that have to punch the clock early in the morning we don't want to hold you very long but the question is well what does it even mean church what does that even really mean what is church and the prophet of god tells us that before the children of israel were called out of egypt they were known as the children of god or the people of god but that after they were called out they were known as the church of god and the reason for that is because the word church means called out so then we say well what was it then before egypt what what what was church before they were down in egypt well if we go back to the beginning um where well i suppose if we went all the way back to the beginning of adam and eve and then them and their children um it would be a lip to ear account of parents and grandparents telling the children about the about about god and about who he is and about the things that he had done and the promises he had made from the beginning and then we get to the flood and the earth is destroyed by water and noah and those on the ark then go out and repopulate the earth again and we see as the babel the tower of babel was erect and then god saw that they were all of one mind and then he scattered their language and he confused them and then they went out and and and spread amongst the earth with multiple languages we see again the earth populating and we see ancestry worship pop up we see idolatry pop up and spread throughout the regions and we see abraham called out of babylon and god calling him out and saying abram separate yourself from your from your people and he called abraham to himself and then we realized that from abraham came isaac from isaac came jacob who later became israel and israel had children 12 sons and we see then the tribes of israel being set up but then they go down after joseph raises up and sits on the right hand of of pharaoh and pharaoh recognizing god in the life of joseph and preserving not only pharaoh's life but all of man's life that would come to egypt that had stored up the food during the famine pharaoh says joseph sit on my right hand your words as good as my word and pharaoh recognized uh joseph and we understand the type there of of of uh god and christ but then the bible says there raised up a pharaoh that knew not joseph or his god and and that then he put the children of israel into bondage and as the children came out of egypt this calling out once again they're now known as the church of god now i just want to turn over into some scriptures in deuteronomy and i want to read in deuteronomy chapter six um something that god had commanded for the children of israel what what they were to do with the word of god with the with all of the promises and all of the accounts of what god had done for the children of israel and his desire to call them out here's his instructions in deuteronomy chapter 6 and i want to just read verses 1 through 9 now these are the commandments the statutes and the judgments which the lord your god commanded to teach you that ye might do them in the land whither ye go to possess it that thou mightest fear the lord thy god to keep all his statutes and his commandments which i command thee thou and thy son and thy son son all the days of thy life and that thy days may be prolonged hear therefore o israel and observe to do it that it may be well with thee and that ye may increase mightily as the lord god of thy fathers hath promised thee in the land that floweth with milk and honey hear o israel the lord our god is one lord and thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thine heart and with all thy soul and with all thy might and these words which i command thee this day shall be in thine heart and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children and shall talk of them when thou sittest in thine house and when thou walkest by the way and when thou liest down and when thou risest up and thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes and thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house and on thy gates so that everything about you everywhere you go everything you say the word of the lord is with you it's in your mouth it's in your mind it's in your heart it's all it's your whole life and it should be your whole life and it should be your children's life and it should be everyone that comes into your gates need to know what you believe now we realize that then god tells moses to to create to make a a tabernacle according to the image that he showed him and he creates a building and this building was going to be a place that the priests the levites could come unto and that the word of god could be into that holiest of holies and that the shoot that the uh the omer of mana would be in there that the the the the tablets of of the law would be in there and that the rod of aaron would be in there and and and he wanted them to bring sacrifice unto this place and constantly there would be this place and this was a building then that they could come and they could gather but the priests could go into and the congregation could come into that sanctuary and bring their offerings and bring their their their tithes and and their sacrifices and then david desires to build god a house david himself has been blessed by god and he has a house and he says i'd like to build a house for god but god tells him david you can't but your son will then solomon's temple is built and we know the stories that how that even today over in jerusalem the jews are awaiting a time that that that that temple could be erected once again that they could restore the the temple worship in that place well it's not a strange thing because we read over here in deuteronomy chapter 16 and verse 6 it says but at the place which the lord thy god shall choose to place his name in there thou shalt sacrifice the passover and even at the going down of the sun at the season that thou camest forth out of egypt so now we see a place that god is saying in the place not just anywhere do you bring your sacrifice not just at any place but in the place in the gates where i place my name in that's where you shall do that now this scripture might really be familiar to us in this day having heard the message of this hour because this was the scripture used for a sermon called god's only provided place of worship and the significance that we recognize is that this is not a physical location that god was speaking about but this was a person and that person was jesus christ that's the place where god chose to put his name in and that name was the lord jesus christ and we recognize that and we see that that that in all of the types whether it be the passover lamb but everything that had to do with the passover and all of those ordinances that god had given the children of israel christ himself even speaking on the on the steps of solomon's temple said tear this place down and in three days i'll rise it raise it up again and they thought my that took the children of israel 40 years to build this temple and you're saying that you're going to rebuild it if we tore it down in three days and the scripture declares that even the disciples did not understand what he spoke about until the death burial and resurrection that he wasn't speaking of that physical temple but his body was he speaking about that within three days he would raise from the dead and we can look back now and say oh my of course we recognize that the types and the shadows of the old testament were all speaking of the person of jesus christ so again just to kind of bring us right back around the question was asked well what is church and what then is a church service and what is a normal service to look like well i thought of the services of jesus himself and the very scripture we read here in mark chapter 2. now jesus taught many a time on a boat down by the seashore open air up on the hillside it was an outdoor gathering of people interested in hearing the the word of god the the promises of god the promises that were left for the children of god that jesus began expounding on and teaching about these things shining more light on the word that had been given but in this instance in mark chapter 2 jesus comes into capernaum and he comes into a house and so this gathering takes place in a house and in history especially for you young people that is where church services if you want to call it that really began to take place was in the houses and i'm going to jump ahead a little bit here but if you find in the when you read your book of acts you'll find that peter when he had come to the gentiles which was in the house of cornelius that's exactly where it began was in a house a man named cornelius it was in his house that he had invited peter to and there was many gathered in that house and peter asks the question what is it that you would like why did you call me here and cornelius explains to peter an angel appeared unto me and told me to go and to get you and that you would instruct us and peter is amazed and he says now the law says for a jew to not gather under the house of a gentile but it just so happens that a few days ago when the angel came to cornelius i was shown a vision of a sheep being let down and there was all types of animals and you know the story rise kill and eat not so lord i've never peter don't call unclean what i have cleansed and he sees this a couple times and he says now i know that god is no respecter of persons but just as he's come to us the children of israel he's also making himself known even to those that would fear god and respect his word and the scripture says while he spake these words the holy ghost fell on them and they received the holy ghost just as they had in that upper room on the day of pentecost now jumping back jesus is in a house and he's preaching and there's so many gathered it says that they couldn't even come in the door it was so full in this house and so no doubt they were gathered on the outside of the house doing their best to hear the words of this young rabbi jesus of nazareth and as they're listening to jesus we would imagine it like a service a church service and he's a preacher the rabbi and he is preaching his sermon and they're listening to him and we don't have it doesn't expound on what words jesus was saying it doesn't tell us what his sermon was that day but what it does tell us is that while he was preaching four men got up on the roof and they had a friend of theirs that was had had a palsy he was sick of the palsy and he was on a cot and they had heard that where jesus was there was many mighty works done there was miracles that happened that somehow god was so with this man that miracles took place blinded eyes were opened dumb began to speak the death began to hear and devils were cast out of people that he that they knew had devils upon them they were perhaps in society thought of crazy or or homeless maybe or strange whatever it would be they were devils on them and when jesus would cast these devils out of these people they became whole and normal and were able to enter into society with their right minds and be a a contribution to all of society and a benefit and these friends thought if we could get our friend to this jesus i believe our friend could be made whole like those others and while jesus is preaching this service and you thought what a nice service we've come into the house everything seems to be normal and he's giving words and they're such lovely words we like that but suddenly there's a disruption and the roof begins caving down in and the top begins to get torn off and perhaps people thought in their mind this is not normal what is happening we came to hear the rabbi and now the roof is getting torn off where's the owner of the house i'd like to file a complaint could somebody please go outside and stop this from happening but jesus as that man gets lowered down in front of him he uh being god in flesh and having the spirit of god and the ability to discern spirits the scripture says he could he saw the faith of those four friends and he said because of their faith he turned and he looked at the man on the cot and he says thy sins be forgiven thee now it declares the scribes didn't like that that was that upset their sermon their church service just a little bit more because now jesus is saying something that they know themselves that god teaches that only god can forgive sins and jesus knowing because he can discern spirits knowing that looks at the scribes and says what is easier for a man to say thy sins be forgiven thee or take up thy bed and go thy way he says but for your sakes i say to this man take up thy bed and go thy way and immediately the man rose up off of the bed took up his bed and went his way and they all marveled and glorified god saying we've never seen something like this before so now you've got to ask yourself is that a normal service is that what church is supposed to be well like in the case of corn the house of cornelius when they expressed to peter what had happened in cornelius's life peter then began speaking to them about the lord jesus christ and who he was and while he spake these words the holy ghost fell on them and they were filled with the baptism of the holy ghost while he spake those words well then you've got to ask yourself is that a normal church service we find in the book of acts i believe it's chapter 14 paul is in a city called lystra lystra i'm not sure how to pronounce that lyconia and there's a man who's impotent in his feet and paul looking on the man perceiving that he had faith to be healed tells the man rise up and walk and the man immediately raises up who'd been impotent in his feet means he had no strength at all in his feet he could not walk immediately because of the faith that he had in his heart received those words and by faith reached out and claimed that that was of god and he rose up and received his healing is that a normal service these were the services that jesus had these were the services that the disciples had and if you go and you read uh your church age book and you go into that beginning where brother branham begins to speak about the messenger for each age and how that where the reason he could come up with those messengers for that age was he said i took paul as the pattern paul was that pattern and if those men's lives matched paul's lives that that's how he knew and and and that's how he could differentiate even between polycarp and irenaeus he thought i thought he said i thought it was that polycarp would have been the the messenger from the age but he said he leaned more towards organization and he said but all of these men when you go and you read in your church age book about those men brother branham gives just a short uh piece on how that in each one of these men's lives the the works and and the spirit of god moved in their ministry and this was what from from the beginning down to the end and and he even gives the the illustration of of john wesley and how that john wesley himself you know he rode i think it was a quarter of a million miles on horseback when he was doing all of his his missionary work and how that at one point even his horse fell and broke its leg and wesley got down and prayed for his horse and his horse was healed well is that a normal church service now in our modern day that when i say church i i want us to clarify that now when i say of a church service i'm speaking of the church in general in a modern day church service you wouldn't see much of that anymore you would see a lot of smoke a lot of a lot of uh loud music and and fancy light work but this seems to be something strange to the modern church but in our day god sent a prophet we have about 1200 sermons and those of you that that listen to those sermons you can just almost randomly grab one and put it in or i should say pull it up on your phone or however it is that you listen to him now but this is not uncommon the very things that you read in this bible that we just talked about is not uncommon for you to hear on those tapes you'll hear the prophet of god take a scripture perhaps a sermon title blind bartimaeus or testimony by the sea and you think okay i have an idea of what he's going to talk about and he'll take a text and he'll begin to talk and then he'll say now he might say something like this now if what i've told you is the truth let him come and and and testify or show that what i've said is the truth and then he'll ask now i believe that they passed out some prayer cards and he they would call the cards and make a line and the people would get in that line and he would begin talking and he'd say now you all know what i'm doing don't you i'm waiting for him i'm waiting for him now to come and then as soon as he says now he's here and then many times he'll he'll say something like now i take every spirit in this place under my control and then someone would come before him and and he would say how do you do and so on and so forth and and then the discernment would begin and it would be so remarkable for us to get to hear kind of like what we read but we get to hear it in our modern time and this would happen time after time after time thousands and maybe hundreds of thousands of times you can hear this and maybe when you hear that especially you young people you think yeah brother branham brother branham's tapes yeah but to the world that's not normal that's abnormal that's that's more than normal and really truly when you look at the world today even as believers when you see how that the world has left him on the outside how that the modern day church has put him on the outside he's he's knocking he's trying to get in but they've put him out and it's something that's so precious when you think about that man that was at that pool of bethesda and it just so happened that jesus came that way the father showed him to go that way and he asked the man what's the problem he says well the angel comes by and stirs the water and and before i can get into the water somebody beats me to it and he'd been he'd had an infirmity and brother branham said he wasn't dying of it he'd had it 38 years or something like that but can you imagine for all those years he was there at that pool waiting for his moment to get into there and he was just looking forward to that water stirring again and it just so happened jesus came by and maybe he didn't know who jesus was if he'd only known that the god of heaven that his very creator was standing right next to him and was caring for the infirmity that he had and he as he asked him what seems to be wrong and he says well somebody beats me into the pool and jesus let him know that he was the life-giver that he was the source of health and he healed that man it might seem like a normal church service when you go to church and you get to hear the preaching of the word and it might just be good you might think those are good words they're he he presented himself so well and he read the scriptures so nicely and everything he said was true that was good but it's different when jesus comes it's not just words anymore when the spirit of god begins to move throughout the building and when he comes to you and you recognize it and you by faith can reach out and take hold of a promise and say god that's for me it does something different than just a normal preacher giving out words up on a platform it's something more when jesus comes by it's not just another house meeting it might seem chaotic it might seem you might seem restless and it might the men's the preacher's words might fall flat you think he just doesn't say words right but it doesn't matter when jesus comes by he does something different for us and i want to close with this in 1957 on march 3rd brother branham is preaching some services i believe he's in phoenix arizona i could be mistaken he might be here in tucson i'm not positive i believe he's in phoenix and he preaches a message what think ye of christ it's in the evening and he begins with the scriptures and he goes through the bible and he says let's take some examples and he speaks of of pontius pilate and he speaks of judas and he speaks of the roman soldier that pierced his side and each one of them he's dramatizing and he and he asks them judas if we could go down to hell he says and we could pull up the spirit of judas and say judas what think ye of christ he said i can hear pieces of silver rolling and jude is saying i betrayed innocent blood that was the son of god and he said if we could ask that roman soldier that pierced his side that roman soldier would say truly that was the son of god he said if we could go to pontius pilate and he he gives a dramatization of pontius pilate and how that his wife even came to him and said have no part to do with this man he's a righteous man this jesus of nazareth i had i for all night i dreamed of him and have nothing to do with him and how that pilot tried washing his natural hands of jesus but he couldn't get him off his hands and he said if we could ask pontius pilate what would he what do ye think of christ what think ye of christ he too would testify truly that was the son of god he says and then we would ask his friends and and and he goes through the the hebrew children he asked daniel he asks ezekiel all of them what thinking of christ and they all have got the profession that he is a living one true living god who came to me who saved my life and at the end of his sermon i'm not sure how long it was maybe an hour an hour and a half then again he calls a prayer line and i wanted to play a part of this for you just a small portion of this prayer line and i just wanted you to just get a glimpse just a snapshot of this and i believe if our brothers have that they can play that [Music] babies in christ do you solemnly understand [Music] that the lord jesus you accepted a few minutes ago is right here now do you see what that was dealing with your heart it was christ here he is up here moving on a platform visible not in behind dark curtains or somewhere else right here before you people god doesn't go behind dark curtains to deal that's a perverted spirit and what is what is a perverted spirit one that should be righteous perverted to do wrong now the lady the lady she no i thought she was deaf but you can't speak english you've come to interpret for her right speak to her did i speak do you believe on the lord jesus christ do you believe me to be his prophet if god will tell me what you are here for will you receive it now you know that i don't know you i can't even speak your language but the god of heaven speaks all language you are here wanting me to pray for you for a growth if that is right raise up your hand that growth is on your left breath if that's right wave your hands and this is your husband and you want prayer for him because he's got a skin disease that is right then you want prayer for a son and the reason you want prayer for him is because he walks in his sleeve with his eyes open [Music] does thou believe on the son of god now surely that would settle mental telepathy for you now what a remarkable thing and that happened thousands and hundreds of thousands of time and you think oh how wonderful for that person how wonderful and yet i've heard thousands of those but that's a piece of a story and i'd like to give you the rest of the story that was a man and a woman a husband and wife that came up before brother branham and they both spoke spanish the wife only spoke spanish he didn't speak english at all and so the husband came to interpret for his wife the man's name was robert the wife's name was maria and she came up and his brother brandon begins to speak to her you through her husband the interpreter she had a growth on her breast and the skin disease that robert had was he would wear boots rubber boots a lot i think because of his work and because of the boots he had a reaction to those boots and it caused a skin condition that he would have on his legs and he would scratch his legs till they would bleed now their son's name was julio and julio walked in his sleep and his eyes would be open and he would go throughout the house and many a times he would hurt himself and so the parents were concerned for him and they desired that god would heal him of that sleeping walk sleep walking now brother branham's discerning all of this and he's asking her is that right about the growth on your breast she says that's right he says and your husband has a skin disease is that right that's right and your son walks in his sleep with his eyes open and as he says that the reason you hear her scream without delay before he finishes that statement is because she heard brother branham say those words in her own language she didn't need an interpreter for that god who speaks all languages was able to cause the voice of the prophet to be heard in spanish to that sister now they went home that night and they went to bed believing god for the very promise he gave through the mouthpiece of his prophet and as they were laying in bed that night in the middle of the night brother robert woke up for some strange reason and he looked down and julio slept at the foot of their bed and while he was looking down he saw julio sit up like he normally did before he went sleepwalking and when he sat up as if he was going to start sleepwalking again brother robert said in the name of jesus christ i command you lay back down and just as soon as julio sat up julio laid right back down went to sleep and never slept walked after that moment now it took robert brother robert believing that what god's prophet said was true even if it didn't come to pass at the moment he said it in that prayer line he knew that what he said was true and that it would come to pass if god promised it and that night that's why he could say in the name of jesus christ lay back down and it never happened again he had faith enough to take hold of that now you say how brother do you know the rest of that story because that was robert and maria figueroa and their grandson bobby figueroa is a good friend of mine who's right here in tucson arizona tonight and you can ask him about that testimony and i told him this evening i'll be testifying of your grandparents tonight and he said they'll be looking over the banisters of heaven listening to you this evening and he said hebrews 13 8 jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and brothers and sisters i'm closing by saying this that's a normal church service for when jesus comes by things are different they're no longer words only but they're promises from the throne of heaven to you personally and if your faith can take hold of the promises of god and say that's true i believe that for me you can have what you asked for and as i spoke this very thing on this last sunday and we were praying at the end of the service an older gentleman who had a back problem came to me after service and said while you were praying the lord jesus touched my back and healed me brothers and sisters that's got nothing to do with me that's got to do with you and our heavenly father our lord and savior jesus christ and i believe that for each and every one of his children not only here in tucson but wheresoever this promise is for you for your children and for them even as many as far off as the lord our god shall call those promises are for or for those who would believe and act upon it amen now may our services never ever be the same again i pray that every time we gather together in the name of jesus christ whether it's in this building in our houses on the job site in our cars riding together wherever that would be if jesus would come by things would change in our life may god grant it let's stand together and pray the musicians would come play something softly perhaps he is here hallelujah he is here amen i want to pray with you this evening and you pray in your own way our lovely lord jesus god to know that there are people who are sick to know that there are people [Music] god people that [Music] that i know personally lord that are dying tonight with cancer god i'm so thankful god that i heard a word in this hour that told us that you made a promise to your prophet that said if you could get the people to believe you nothing would stand before your prayer not even cancer [Music] god maybe it's not cancer maybe it's not even sickness in the body but lord we have we fight so many mind battles god we have so many problems in our homes and our jobs and just the struggles of life [Music] lord so many times we feel like the man at that pool of bethesda and we're just looking for relief we believe lord we believe in you but we know we need a touch from you god the doctors just they can't help what the problems that we have they just they don't have answers for some of these things and god if we could just recognize that the very life giver is right next to us lord even more so he's in us god you've given us so many promises and lord we play those tapes and we hear it over and over again and lord we're so our hearts swell with gladness to hear the deliverance for these people and god many times we cry out oh god let that be in my life oh god let it be so for brother so and so we're sister so and so for my family member oh god would you come and do the same thing and god you hear us you're so mindful you care so much for your children [Music] god you care for the tucson tabernacle god you care for these people they've got great needs and lord i'm asking that you would do something for them that god right now is each one is praying to you god in their own way they're crying out father hear my prayer lord send that angel of the lord right down my aisle hear my voice hear my heart god my faith might be weak but oh god search me and see that with every fiber that's within me i desire a touch from the lord jesus god i pray that you be merciful and god help us to have the kind of faith that our brother robert figaro had when lord that night his son rose up maybe his heart thought oh no not again but god by faith he spoke out believing the promise it said in the name of jesus christ in the name of jesus christ lord there's power in that name god every devil is going to bow to that knee to that name lord they're gonna tremble at that name and every man and every woman one day will bow to the name of jesus christ but god tonight we come in that name we ask lord jesus that whatever the needs would be on the hearts of your children in this place tonight i pray god you do something special in this little service that god this would become a normal service like you had like lord your disciples had that lord god we hear when we play those tapes that's a normal service and god that's what we desire not just in this building but god that the service that we would have to you every day every every time we gather together would be that kind of a service lord i pray that the very desires that are on their heart you you lord are the discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart lord you can read their hearts you can read their minds lord you know their very desires and god your word says ask abundantly that your joys may be full god whatever would be asked tonight according to your word and according to your perfect will i ask heavenly father that you would move upon these needs and these requests god look at the faith in their heart and act according to that faith [Music] i pray lord that as they would go home and as they would begin to think about these things as they would keep these these precepts of god and and and keep their minds on you and lord move according to the moving of the spirit of god that as they would keep these things before their as frontlets between their eyes and and as they sit down and as they rise up as they lay down lord they would think on these things they would talk about these things that god they would act upon these things the lord jesus you would make yourself known god if it wouldn't be tonight lord perhaps through this week i pray lord god the testimonies perhaps would come pouring in to brother watkins would come pouring in before this church that god came my way god heard my voice god came down into my home and into my neighborhood and answered my very prayer granted heavenly father i pray god that you just do something like that for your little bride because it's your desire to then we ask these things believing that we will receive them in the name of jesus christ amen amen let's sing it together and worship him he is amen he is here holy holy i will bless his name again oh he is here listen closely hear him calling out your name he is here you can't touch him you will never be the same just once more [Music] he is here holy holy i will bless his name [Music] him calling out your name [Music] to the johnson family to the roberts family brother julio attends our services here [Music] him and sister serbia sit right back about where sister pled sitting there in the family they're not here tonight brother julio's a living testimony of that and i'll say one may he hear him calling out your name brother robert figueroa junior's sister jessica was walking down the road when she heard her name being called and said jessica and she turned to look thinking it was the kid she was with that had called her and no when she stopped and turned a car came right through the intersection and crashed into the fence where she would have been walking across he's jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever he doesn't change he is here it depends on your attitude it depends on how you see it if that man at the pool would have said well who are you who are you to tell me this and that got up and walked off he would still been laying there by the pool but you've heard god's word tonight and if you could take a hold of it and apply it in your life watch it begin to happen watch god begin to do those things it's the faith remember that roman centurion a roman centurion one that you would say not even a christian he said wait a minute he recognized who god was and he said you say you have that authority you just speak and it shall be why did you take that at it to date about that situation in your life lord you speak and it shall be amen he's the same yesterday today and forever a normal service wow never thought about it that way where god is things are happening all the
