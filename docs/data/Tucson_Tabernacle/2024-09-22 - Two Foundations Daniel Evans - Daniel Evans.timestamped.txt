[0:00] I
[0:01] um I was talking with my uh my
[0:03] grandmother this morning God bless her
[0:06] she's she's streaming in and she uh
[0:09] she's just you heard the prayer request
[0:11] her nerves were were
[0:14] um just out of out of sorts and just
[0:18] struggling sometimes we get like that
[0:21] and what we don't understand is those
[0:24] things are normal it's it's normal for
[0:27] us to go through these the these fa
[0:30] phases of ups and these phases of downs
[0:33] and there is just something as sister
[0:35] Jessica is saying there is something
[0:38] that's within us that is just crying
[0:43] out to something over on the other
[0:46] side it's something that the Apostle
[0:50] Paul I believe it was he said it's
[0:53] something behind the veil it's something
[0:57] on the other side of the
[1:00] Veil and as when I was thinking about
[1:05] that scripture the other day I was I was
[1:07] thinking what is that really mean Beyond
[1:10] the Veil or on the other side of the
[1:12] veil and it's something that that we go
[1:14] back to the original Temple and there
[1:16] was the holy of holies that was that
[1:19] inner Sanctuary that that Mercy Seat
[1:22] where the Ark of the Covenant was you
[1:25] had the ark was a a wooden box and then
[1:27] on the top of the Ark was what's called
[1:29] called The Mercy Seat with with two
[1:31] cherubims on the top with their with
[1:33] their wings touching on either side and
[1:37] there in that once a year the presence
[1:42] of the Lord would come
[1:44] down and it would just be for that one
[1:46] high priest once a year that would be
[1:48] able to go into there and experience the
[1:51] presence of God and now the Apostle is
[1:56] telling us that he's saying
[1:58] that there is something Beyond the
[2:03] Veil and it's like if you're up against
[2:06] a a curtain or a wall and you put your
[2:10] ear up to it there's something there
[2:13] that's speaking to you and with with
[2:18] this gospel that that the song says come
[2:22] Jesus come there's something in us that
[2:24] just longs to to have that what's behind
[2:28] that Veil have that that voice that's
[2:30] speaking it Lord I want to know you
[2:32] better I need to understand you Lord I
[2:36] it's I'm going to die if I don't have
[2:38] you that longing that we have to that
[2:43] being that Spirit that's over that's
[2:46] over on the other side Psalm 42 says
[2:49] that it's a deep calling to the Deep
[2:55] it's something that that all read it
[2:58] psalm believe it's Psalm
[3:02] 42 Psalm 42:7 says Psalm 426 it says oh
[3:08] my God my soul is cast down Within Me
[3:11] therefore I will remember thee from the
[3:13] land of Jordan and the hermit from the
[3:16] hill of misar deep calleth unto the Deep
[3:21] at the noise of thy wat spouts it's
[3:25] waterfalls all thy waves and thy Billows
[3:28] are gone over me yet the Lord will
[3:30] command his loving kindness in the
[3:33] daytime and in the night his song shall
[3:36] be with me and my prayer unto the god of
[3:39] my
[3:41] life do we really know who that God of
[3:45] Our Lives
[3:47] is do we really we all come to church we
[3:49] all call ourselves Christians we all say
[3:51] we're Believers but do we really know
[3:56] that voice that's on the other side of
[3:58] the Veil
[4:00] do we really understand do we really
[4:02] have a
[4:03] relationship with that God that's
[4:06] speaking us to us from the other side
[4:09] brothers and sisters I I believe
[4:14] that he wants us to know
[4:18] him and just as sure as there is a voice
[4:22] over on the other side of the veil and
[4:24] the other side of another dimension
[4:26] calling out to us there is also another
[4:28] voice from Satan
[4:30] that hates us and we'll do anything in
[4:33] his power and he has great power to
[4:35] prevent us from going over there that
[4:39] he's doing everything that he can
[4:40] because he wants our
[4:43] souls and he'll do anything that he can
[4:46] and if he knows that he can't have our
[4:48] souls then he'll try to take our joy
[4:51] he'll try to take our happiness he'll
[4:53] try to ruin our lives just like sister
[4:55] mine was talking the prayer request
[4:57] about about your son and now he wants to
[5:00] do what's right and here comes
[5:04] Satan seeing that and if he can't have
[5:07] the soul he wants the
[5:10] joy he hates us and he's going to do
[5:13] everything that he can to keep us
[5:17] from that Joy of Jesus Christ that love
[5:21] of Jesus
[5:23] Christ in um Jesus's first public sermon
[5:29] the Sermon on the
[5:32] Mount Jesus says some things that really
[5:37] no one had ever heard very
[5:40] very deep
[5:43] teachings and let's turn to Matthew
[5:45] chapter
[5:46] 7 verse
[5:49] 21 and Jesus is still preaching he's
[5:52] he's gone through a a fairly lengthy
[5:56] sermon and now he says some things
[6:00] that are a bit
[6:01] frightening Matthew chapter 7 verse
[6:04] verse 21 it says
[6:07] this not
[6:10] everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord
[6:12] shall enter into the kingdom of heaven
[6:15] but he that doeth the will of My Father
[6:17] which is in heaven so not everyone that
[6:20] claims Jesus Christ not everyone that
[6:23] claims that they're a Son of God not
[6:24] everyone that claims those things is
[6:26] going to enter in to that place
[6:30] but only he that does the will of my
[6:32] father is what Jesus is saying many will
[6:35] say to me in that day Lord Lord have not
[6:37] we prophesied in that in thy name and in
[6:40] thy name have cast out devils and in thy
[6:43] name done many wonderful
[6:45] works then will I profess unto them I
[6:48] never knew
[6:50] you depart from me ye that work
[6:54] iniquity in my name Jesus is saying in
[6:59] the name of Jesus Christ they're saying
[7:01] these things and then he's going to say
[7:03] depart from me I never knew
[7:07] you therefore whosoever heareth these
[7:10] sayings of
[7:13] mine and does them I will liken him unto
[7:17] a wise man which built his house upon a
[7:21] rock and the rain descended and the
[7:24] floods came and the winds blew and beat
[7:26] upon the house and and it fell not and
[7:28] it was founded upon a rock and everyone
[7:32] that heareth these sayings of mine and
[7:34] doeth them
[7:35] not shall be likened unto the foolish
[7:38] man which built his house upon the sand
[7:41] and the rain descended and the floods
[7:43] came and the winds blew and beat upon
[7:45] the house and it fell and great was the
[7:48] fall of
[7:50] it and it came to pass when Jesus had
[7:53] ended these sayings that the people were
[7:55] astonished at his Doctrine for he taught
[7:58] them as one having
[8:00] Authority and not as the scribes so
[8:03] here's Jesus saying he say and this is
[8:06] his first public sermon and he makes a
[8:09] statement like if you don't
[8:12] do what I
[8:15] say then you're going to be lost and
[8:18] many will come in my name and say have
[8:21] we not cast out devils and done these
[8:22] Mighty works and I'm going to say I
[8:24] never knew you depart from
[8:27] me and then
[8:31] he tells it what he had preached earlier
[8:34] he tells about what things what he was
[8:38] commanding us to do and the people
[8:40] listening to him and they were things
[8:42] that seemed very simple but they were
[8:44] things that I see very very few people
[8:46] on this day
[8:48] doing James chapter 1 verse n verse 19
[8:53] now James was a follower of Jesus Christ
[8:59] he became the pastor of the church in
[9:01] Jerusalem after Christ had ascended
[9:04] James 1: 19 says this wherefor my
[9:07] beloved Brethren let every man be swift
[9:09] to hear slow to speak and slow to
[9:12] wrath for the wrath of man worketh not
[9:15] the righteousness of God wherefore lay
[9:18] apart all filthiness and superfluity of
[9:21] naughtiness that means overflowing
[9:24] wickedness and receive with meekness the
[9:26] engrafted word which is able to save
[9:29] your soul
[9:30] Souls be ye doers of the word and not
[9:33] hearers
[9:36] only for if
[9:45] any deceiving your own selves for if any
[9:47] be a hearer of the word and not a
[9:50] doer he is like unto a man beholding his
[9:53] natural face in the glass for behold he
[9:56] beholdeth himself and goeth his way and
[9:58] straightway forgiveth what manner of man
[10:00] he was but who so lookth into the
[10:02] perfect law of Liberty and continueth
[10:04] therein he being not a forgetful here
[10:07] but a doer of the work this man shall be
[10:10] blessed in his deed If any man among you
[10:13] seem to be religious and bridleth not
[10:15] his tongue but deceiveth his own heart
[10:17] this man's religion is vain pure
[10:20] religion and undefiled before God and
[10:23] the father is this to visit the
[10:24] fatherless the widows in their
[10:26] Affliction and to keep himself unspotted
[10:29] from the world so what James is saying
[10:31] he's saying that Jesus taught these
[10:33] things Jesus taught that we should
[10:36] prefer our brother and and and and a few
[10:39] of the things that I'll mention here in
[10:40] a moment and he's saying that don't just
[10:43] be hearers of the word don't just listen
[10:45] to it but you go and you do it and Jesus
[10:50] himself said if you're not going to do
[10:52] what I say you're going to be lost and
[10:54] I'm going to say depart from me you're
[10:55] the work of iniquity you're going to say
[10:58] come before the Lord you're going to say
[10:59] Lord have I not believed you have I not
[11:01] cast out devils in your name have I not
[11:03] done all these things and he's going to
[11:04] say no you didn't do what I told
[11:08] you and then what James is saying here
[11:11] when he says looks in front of a glass
[11:14] James is saying that you are looking in
[11:17] a
[11:20] mirror when you're in church
[11:23] probably and you're looking in this
[11:27] mirror and you're seeing
[11:30] yourself and you're saying Lord I need
[11:32] to
[11:33] improve what the brother was saying and
[11:35] and quoting the Lord Jesus and that I
[11:37] need to improve in my life and then you
[11:41] walk out of the church and as time
[11:44] starts to go by you forget what manner
[11:47] of person you were before and then you
[11:50] go right back into everyday
[11:53] life and the feeling that we might have
[11:55] in church that feeling of condemnation I
[11:57] need to do a better job
[11:59] it
[12:01] leaves and you forget what you looked
[12:06] like verse number
[12:14] 26 it says this I'm going to read the um
[12:19] I'm going to read The New International
[12:21] Version let's start with verse 26 with
[12:23] James 1 says
[12:25] this those who consider themselves
[12:28] religious
[12:29] and yet do not keep a tight rain on
[12:31] their tongues deceive themselves and
[12:34] their religion is worthless religion
[12:37] that God our Father accepts as pure and
[12:39] faultless as this to look after the
[12:41] orphans and the widows in their distress
[12:43] and to keep oneself from being polluted
[12:45] by the world it's pretty simple it's as
[12:48] I said we come to church we receive
[12:50] correction we see ourselves in the
[12:52] mirror that we need to do better we go
[12:54] right back to the life of criticism of
[12:56] everything outside of ourselves
[12:59] and
[13:00] then time goes by and all of a sudden
[13:04] you look at yourself and wow I'm the
[13:06] same person I was five years
[13:08] ago I'm the same person I was 10 years
[13:11] ago I'm the same person I was 20 years
[13:13] ago 30 years ago 40 years ago what in my
[13:16] life has changed why have I not turned a
[13:20] corner and it's because we become
[13:24] complacent in what we
[13:27] believe and we're ignoring ing many
[13:30] times we think that we're great we think
[13:33] that we have this great
[13:35] Revelation and we ignore what Jesus said
[13:37] he
[13:38] said Matthew 5 he said you have heard
[13:41] that it was said the people long ago you
[13:43] shall not
[13:44] murder and anyone who murders will be
[13:46] subject to judgment but I tell you that
[13:48] anyone who is angry with a brother or a
[13:50] sister will be subject to
[13:52] judgment do we believe
[13:55] that Matthew another one says this in
[13:57] Matthew there for if you are offering
[14:00] your gift at the altar and there
[14:01] remember that your brother or sister has
[14:03] something against
[14:05] you leave your gift there at the altar
[14:08] and first go and be reconciled to them
[14:09] and then come and receive your gift if
[14:12] someone has something against you you
[14:15] are to go to that person if if you've
[14:17] done no no
[14:20] wrong you have heard that it was said an
[14:22] eye for an eye and to for tooth but I
[14:23] tell you don't resist an evil person if
[14:26] anyone slaps you on the right
[14:28] cheek turn it other cheek Also if anyone
[14:31] wants to sue you and take your shirt
[14:34] give them your coat as well if anyone
[14:37] forces you to go one mile forces you to
[14:41] go to mile not you're walking and you're
[14:43] greed and you're enjoying it but if
[14:46] anyone forces
[14:48] you to go a mile with them go two miles
[14:52] with
[14:53] them give the one who asks you and don't
[14:56] turn away from the one who wants to
[14:58] borrow from from
[15:01] you you have heard that it was said love
[15:03] your neighbor and hate your enemy but I
[15:05] tell you to love your enemies and pray
[15:07] for those that persecute you this is
[15:10] Jesus Christ God made flesh
[15:13] speaking that you may be children of
[15:15] your father he causes his son to rise on
[15:17] the evil and the good and S Reigns on
[15:19] the just on the just and the unjust if
[15:21] you love those who love you what reward
[15:23] will you get are not even the publicans
[15:27] doing that if you greet only your own
[15:33] people what are you doing more than the
[15:36] others don't even the pagans do that
[15:40] some says publicans some translations
[15:42] say publicans some translations say say
[15:46] Gentiles some translations say pagans
[15:49] the one I just read it's
[15:51] Sinners don't the Sinners do that
[15:55] too be perfect therefore even as your
[15:59] Father in Heaven is
[16:02] perfect these are the commandments of
[16:04] Jesus and he says if you are not doing
[16:07] these
[16:09] things my
[16:12] Commandments then when you come before
[16:14] me I'm going to say Department from me
[16:15] you that work iniquity I never knew
[16:18] you these these things right here that
[16:21] well teaching teachings of Jesus and you
[16:23] say well I'm higher than that I
[16:25] understand more I I have we have a much
[16:28] deeper understanding now but we don't
[16:31] the fact is we
[16:33] don't if we're not doing these things
[16:37] that Jesus commanded and he has many
[16:39] other things then we are not being what
[16:43] Jesus commanded us to be and we run the
[16:47] risk of coming him to him in that day
[16:50] and saying Lord I believed your message
[16:52] with all my heart I came to church every
[16:53] Sunday I did this and this and this and
[16:57] he's going to say what
[16:59] you didn't do what I told you to do you
[17:02] had every opportunity to open this book
[17:05] and read the words and read and all the
[17:07] other
[17:08] words and you didn't do
[17:11] them how many of us have we driving on
[17:13] the
[17:14] highway merging in and here comes this
[17:19] guy behind us and he's trying to get us
[17:21] I do it every morning merging on the AA
[17:24] Road under the freeway and inevitably
[17:27] the guy behind me two lanes coming
[17:30] together to get on the highway the guy
[17:31] behind me tries to get in front of
[17:33] me fires me
[17:37] up but bro we can't we got to let them
[17:41] have it what is it going to cost me
[17:44] maybe maybe one second maybe two
[17:47] seconds we're Christians when in our
[17:49] we're in our cars
[17:51] too those things count I use that
[17:54] because it's an easy example for us all
[17:56] to think about it's not just a sister or
[17:59] a brother in
[18:01] church that you might have something
[18:03] against that you're not even going to go
[18:04] to heaven if you don't get it right
[18:06] first by the way that's a
[18:10] promise but it's not just that it's the
[18:13] people that we meet every
[18:15] day and if somebody does us
[18:18] wrong be a Christian about it we want
[18:23] the Deep things let me tell you the Deep
[18:24] things these are the Deep
[18:27] things these
[18:29] are the most important
[18:32] things we look at we look at the
[18:35] Lord there's three there's a beautiful
[18:38] set of three words in the Bible and I
[18:41] believe it's in first John's one of
[18:42] John's Epistles he says this he says God
[18:45] is
[18:47] love that love of God that's there how
[18:50] that it just overflows in all of us who
[18:53] have sinned against him and forsaken him
[18:55] and done all that we've had and that
[18:57] we've done in our lives and he just
[18:59] loves us more and loves us more and
[19:01] takes care of us because he knows that
[19:03] one day this is my child and he's going
[19:07] to
[19:09] repent and we need to have the same
[19:11] Spirit as
[19:14] him and we need to
[19:16] build this
[19:19] foundation on a solid rock and that rock
[19:23] is this word and the revelation of this
[19:26] word
[19:28] and that's where we need to build our
[19:30] house on of this life and if we build it
[19:33] on something else that house is going to
[19:35] fail as I read Lord Jesus saying let me
[19:37] tell you about we're going through the
[19:39] Book of Daniel and we we just finished
[19:41] up brother L is going to give us a
[19:43] summary on Wednesday but let me tell you
[19:45] a story in This Book of Daniel that
[19:47] shows a perfect example of a man who had
[19:50] a weak foundation and then God brought
[19:54] him around gave him some character and
[19:57] gave him a strong Foundation
[19:59] was one of the greatest testimonies in
[20:01] the Bible and it's not even one in the
[20:05] lineage of God's people it's a king and
[20:08] not just a king one of the evilest kings
[20:12] that we have ever seen one of the most
[20:14] ruthless kings that had one of the worst
[20:16] tempers one of the most
[20:18] um narcissistic kings that you'll ever
[20:21] read and that's this man
[20:24] Nebuchadnezzar what an awful person he
[20:27] was
[20:29] Nebuchadnezzar didn't have a foundation
[20:32] in his life but there was some good in
[20:34] the man and what he did is he has this
[20:38] bad
[20:39] dream he hears about this Prophet named
[20:42] Daniel Daniel comes and interprets this
[20:45] dream to
[20:48] Nebuchadnezzar and not only interprets
[20:50] the dream but tells him his dream so
[20:53] then Nebuchadnezzar sees that this man
[20:56] is something this man is great
[20:59] so what he does is in the very next
[21:03] chapter he builds this giant
[21:08] statue of gold and he tells the people
[21:12] to Fall Down and Worship this statue
[21:16] maybe like he was like he was
[21:19] doing because of where the it lays in
[21:22] the
[21:22] scripture and because of the things that
[21:26] Nebuchadnezzar said it's very obvious
[21:31] that this statue that was built up in
[21:33] the plane was a statue of the Prophet
[21:37] Daniel brother brandom said the same
[21:39] thing that it
[21:41] was so he builds this
[21:44] statue and he says now when you hear
[21:46] this sound you fall down and everybody
[21:49] here you fall down and you worship this
[21:53] statue like I am and he lifts this
[21:56] statue up to a Godlike thing because
[21:58] Nebuchadnezzar didn't have an
[22:00] understanding he didn't have that um
[22:03] that that strong Foundation of
[22:07] God so he builds this up he's happy
[22:11] everything's going good so there's these
[22:13] three young men Daniel wasn't forced to
[22:16] worship the statue because it was a
[22:17] statue of himself of course he wouldn't
[22:20] have to but there were three young men
[22:23] Shadrach Meshach and Abednego who had a
[22:26] strong Foundation
[22:28] so when they were forced to worship this
[22:32] statue they said I'm not go we are not
[22:35] going to do it we would rather die than
[22:38] to worship anything but our God they had
[22:40] a firm foundation so Nebuchadnezzar
[22:42] loses his temper gets all fired up we
[22:45] know the story fired up he fired up the
[22:47] the furnace seven times hotter and he
[22:49] takes Shadrach meach and abedo and he
[22:52] says now you all we're going to throw
[22:54] you in there if you won't recant if you
[22:56] won't worship the statue they say no
[22:59] God's able to deliver us but even if he
[23:01] doesn't Deliver us we're still going to
[23:02] worship God and if God changes your
[23:07] life even if times get
[23:10] hard you're gonna
[23:12] say even if my life is ruined I'm still
[23:15] going to worship God and that's that's
[23:18] the attitude that these young men had he
[23:20] gets them there they throw them in the
[23:26] furnace this big flame comes out of the
[23:28] furnace and it it kills the soldiers
[23:31] that are with them Shad um
[23:33] Nebuchadnezzar looks into this Burning
[23:36] fiery furnace that was used probably to
[23:37] melt metal and it was seven times hotter
[23:40] than normal and he sees four people
[23:42] walking in there and he says hey didn't
[23:43] you put
[23:45] three like yeah well there's a fourth
[23:48] one in there and then the Gentile says
[23:50] Ah he looks like the Son of
[23:52] God how he knew that I don't understand
[23:55] right but he had that Revelation there
[23:57] was something good about about that man
[23:59] so he goes and he pulls him out and he
[24:04] says this Daniel chapter
[24:08] 3 verse 27 and the princes and the
[24:12] governors and the captains and the Kings
[24:13] and the counselors began to gather
[24:15] together and they saw those men upon
[24:16] whose whose body fire had no power nor
[24:19] was a hair of their head singed neither
[24:21] was their coats changed nor the smell of
[24:23] fire had passed on them then
[24:25] Nebuchadnezzar spake and said blessed be
[24:26] the god of Shadrach Meshach and abedo
[24:29] blessed be the god of Shadrach Meshach
[24:33] and
[24:35] abedo who have sent his Angel and
[24:38] delivered his servants and trusted them
[24:40] and have changed the king's word and
[24:42] yielded their bodies that they might not
[24:44] serve nor worship any God except their
[24:46] own God therefore I make it agree that
[24:49] every people nation and language would
[24:51] speak anything against the Miss against
[24:55] the god of Shadrach mhach and abedo
[25:00] he still isn't there yet he still
[25:02] doesn't have that
[25:03] Foundation it's this other God it's this
[25:07] God of these great men that did great
[25:11] things the God of this Daniel and he was
[25:14] giving reverence to this God and not
[25:17] knowing that he had not accepted that
[25:19] God
[25:20] himself his foundation was
[25:24] weak that's why he's saying it's their
[25:27] God because he didn't know
[25:30] him and how many times do what us all of
[25:33] us we say oh it's the God of this great
[25:36] man or this man did these great things
[25:39] or our pastor does this or priest does
[25:41] this or whoever it is does this these
[25:43] great miraculous
[25:46] things he knew
[25:49] God but
[25:50] Nebuchadnezzar and US often we don't
[25:53] know the same God but instead we put it
[25:55] on someone else and truly do not know
[25:59] him we know he did great
[26:02] things we know he's powerful beyond
[26:05] measure but do we know him do we know
[26:09] that voice that's on the other side of
[26:11] that
[26:13] Veil therefore I make a decree that
[26:16] every people nation and language would
[26:17] speak anything aiss against the god of
[26:19] Shadrach mesach and abedo shall be cut
[26:21] into pieces and their houses shall be
[26:23] made a dungill because there is no other
[26:25] God that can deliver after this sword
[26:27] then the king promot did Shadrach
[26:29] Meshach and Abednego in the province of
[26:33] Babylon so he knew that there was
[26:35] something powerful and he
[26:38] believed he said a decree he was like
[26:40] this their God is
[26:42] true but he didn't know that God himself
[26:47] he did not understand that he his
[26:51] foundation needs to be built on that God
[26:54] and not just rely on the foundation of
[26:57] these other people
[26:59] so then he goes on in the next
[27:03] chapter and he has a
[27:06] dream and this dream is about very very
[27:10] it's it's a very hard
[27:13] dream same man Daniel comes and
[27:15] interprets the
[27:17] dream he tells him he says
[27:18] Nebuchadnezzar he says you're going to
[27:21] lose you're going to lose
[27:24] everything he says you're going to be
[27:25] like a beast in the field
[27:29] so then
[27:32] Nebuchadnezzar some time
[27:35] passed and then he's
[27:39] out and he's looking out across this
[27:43] great
[27:44] Babylon the king and he says look at
[27:50] this Babylon which I have
[27:53] built and his pride welled up in him and
[27:57] this then the prophecy that had come
[27:59] forth the interpretation of the Dream
[28:01] came forth and right at that moment
[28:04] because that Pride welled up in him
[28:06] because he didn't understand that he
[28:08] didn't have that Foundation that
[28:09] Shadrach Meshach and Abednego had that
[28:12] Daniel had because he didn't have that
[28:14] he fell and it was the grace of God that
[28:18] he
[28:19] fell he lost his
[28:22] mind went out into the field for seven
[28:26] years he was there his Nails grew out
[28:29] long crawled
[28:32] around like a cow slept in the field
[28:36] woke up in the morning and the Dew was
[28:37] on his back his hair got really long men
[28:42] crazy can you imagine what the people
[28:44] said can you imagine how embarrassing it
[28:46] was to
[28:47] him this was Nebuchadnezzar our great
[28:50] king and he's out there eating grass and
[28:53] and and out of his mind for seven years
[28:59] and
[29:00] then what was going on I believe is God
[29:03] was building that foundation not on
[29:07] Sand but God tore him down so that that
[29:11] Foundation could be
[29:13] rebuilt and built upon a
[29:16] rock Nebuchadnezzar then his mind was
[29:18] restored to
[29:20] him and then he had the honor of being
[29:23] the
[29:24] only Gentile King and and really
[29:29] probably the only Gentile that has his
[29:31] own chapter dedicated to him in the
[29:34] Bible and it's his
[29:36] testimony it's testimony of how I
[29:39] failed and how I how I pride welled up
[29:43] in
[29:44] me and yet God had mercy on
[29:49] me let's go
[29:54] to Daniel 4 we'll start with verse 29
[29:58] this is the king
[30:01] talking this is Nebuchadnezzar giving
[30:04] his whole his own testimony he speaks in
[30:07] third person because a lot of the Kings
[30:08] used to do that Daniel 4:29 says this at
[30:11] the end of 12 months he walked into the
[30:13] Palace of the kingdom of Babylon the
[30:15] king spake and said is not this great
[30:18] Babylon that I have built for my for the
[30:21] house of the Kingdom by the might and of
[30:24] my power and for the honor of my Majesty
[30:27] while the world was in the king while
[30:29] the word was in the king's mouth there
[30:31] fell a voice from Heaven saying oh
[30:32] Nebuchadnezzar to thee it is spoken the
[30:35] kingdom is departed from thee and they
[30:38] shall Drive thee from men and thy TW
[30:40] Dwelling Place will be the beasts of the
[30:42] field he's giving his
[30:44] testimony about this is what happened to
[30:48] me and they shall make thee to eat grass
[30:51] as oxen and seven times seven years
[30:53] shall pass over thee until thou know
[30:56] that the most high rule in the Kingdom
[30:58] of men and giveth to whom he whosoever
[31:01] he will the same hour was the thing
[31:03] fulfilled upon
[31:04] Nebuchadnezzar and he was driven from
[31:07] all men and did eat grass and his body
[31:09] was wet with the de of Heaven till his
[31:11] hairs were grown out like e eagle
[31:13] feathers and his nails were like Bird's
[31:15] Claws and at the end of the days I
[31:19] Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto
[31:23] heaven now brothers and sisters it's no
[31:25] longer the god of Shadrach mesach and
[31:28] abedo it's no longer the god of Daniel
[31:32] it's no longer the god of Paul it's no
[31:35] longer the God of this Prophet or that
[31:38] Prophet or the god of brother brandom or
[31:40] the god of anything it's no longer
[31:44] that I lifted up my eyes to heaven and
[31:49] my understanding returned unto me and I
[31:52] blessed the most high and I praised and
[31:54] honored him that liveth forever whose
[31:56] Dominion is an everlasting dominion and
[31:58] his kingdom is from generation to
[32:00] [Music]
[32:01] generation and all the inhabitants of
[32:03] the Earth are reputed as nothing and he
[32:06] doeth according to his will in the army
[32:08] of heaven and among the inhabitants of
[32:10] the earth and none can stay his hand or
[32:13] say to him what doest thou and at the
[32:15] same time my reason return to me and for
[32:18] the glory of my kingdom my honor and
[32:20] brightness return to me and my
[32:21] counselors and my lord lord sought unto
[32:25] me and I was established in my kingdom
[32:27] and an excellent Majesty was added to me
[32:30] now I
[32:31] Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and
[32:35] honor the king of Heaven no more another
[32:41] one no more there's many there's
[32:44] multiple of them now I honor the one
[32:48] true
[32:49] God because in those Hard Times those
[32:52] past seven years none of us have gone
[32:54] through something like that he learned
[32:57] who God was
[32:58] he learned to trust
[33:02] God and his ways and his judgments and
[33:04] to those that walk he said now I
[33:07] Nebuchadnezzar praised and extolled and
[33:09] honor the king of Heaven all whose works
[33:11] are truth and his ways judgment and
[33:13] those that walk in Pride he is able to
[33:18] abas he was Nebuchadnezzar now is
[33:22] testifying now I have this
[33:24] Foundation now I know that there's one
[33:26] this one true God and now I have a
[33:29] relationship with him and everything was
[33:32] restored to this man but he couldn't see
[33:35] it before he couldn't see he gave honor
[33:37] to this God because he had seen his
[33:40] miracles and he had seen his servants he
[33:42] gave honor to him but he didn't know him
[33:44] himself his foundation was sand and it
[33:47] fell the house got destroyed and out
[33:51] into the field he
[33:53] goes and then rebuilding this Foundation
[33:56] he comes back and now he there's only
[33:59] one God and I know him
[34:03] now my brother he said tell me we talk
[34:07] about the Lord and and there's
[34:11] Nebuchadnezzar couldn't
[34:13] see the importance of knowing this one
[34:15] God he didn't
[34:17] understand and my brother used to say
[34:20] like a blind
[34:21] man you can put up two
[34:24] fingers and say how many fingers am I
[34:26] holding up
[34:29] four
[34:30] no how many fingers am I holding up
[34:34] two
[34:36] no how many fingers am I holding up 14
[34:42] no he doesn't understand he can't see
[34:45] and no matter how mad you get at him no
[34:47] matter how upset you get the man can't
[34:49] see because he's
[34:51] blind those scales need to come off of
[34:54] our eyes and we have to admit like
[34:56] Nebuchadnezzar did humble ourselves Lord
[34:58] take this blindness away help me to
[35:00] serve you help me to
[35:03] understand Lord let me let me know you
[35:06] better like this man did like these men
[35:08] in the Bible these women in the Bible
[35:10] Lord let me know you better because I
[35:13] don't know you all I know is a church or
[35:14] all I know is a Creed or an
[35:16] idea I need to know you all of us
[35:20] everyone under this roof needs to have
[35:22] that attitude because we're not there we
[35:27] are not what we should be we should be
[35:30] better and then there's times that the
[35:33] Lord like this man Nebuchadnezzar
[35:35] there's times when the Lord will let us
[35:37] if we are his child he'll let us fall
[35:40] and let us come to complete
[35:43] ruin to show us that your foundation is
[35:46] wrong and then build it back
[35:49] up and I wondered I always wondered I've
[35:52] seen people fall into
[35:55] sin I always wondered why why do some
[35:58] humble themselves and come
[36:01] back and others just fly
[36:05] away there's two stories I'll tell there
[36:09] was a man that I
[36:12] knew that he's married and
[36:16] children and
[36:18] uh his
[36:22] nephew had a
[36:24] girlfriend and so he allowed this girl
[36:27] to come they allowed the girl to come
[36:28] stay in their
[36:30] house well he ends up having an affair
[36:32] with this young
[36:33] lady ruining his marriage ruining his
[36:39] life and he goes and he
[36:42] says instead of repenting to his wife
[36:46] instead of making it right this was his
[36:50] opportunity to leave and to live a life
[36:53] of
[36:54] sin so then now he's free
[36:58] so now he starts going to the bars
[37:01] starts drinking starts running around
[37:02] the guy's in his was in his
[37:05] mid-40s starts starts just doing
[37:08] terrible
[37:10] things ends up just being a a
[37:13] total
[37:14] nothing and loving
[37:17] sin and even and and then he became he
[37:21] turned
[37:22] against the faith that he was raised in
[37:28] he he didn't just turn
[37:30] against the message of brother Brandon
[37:34] he turned against it all he left the
[37:35] whole
[37:37] Faith to serve
[37:39] himself I look at that that man and I I
[37:42] I
[37:44] think
[37:46] why because that sin was in you you
[37:49] never had a foundation you grew up in
[37:52] all this but it was never built strong
[37:55] you
[37:55] sinned you made a mistake terrible
[37:59] mistake but you made a mistake now what
[38:01] are you going to do about it and that's
[38:02] so often with us we'll make a mistake
[38:05] we'll do something wrong and then what
[38:07] proves it doesn't prove that we're not a
[38:09] Christian what proves if we're a
[38:11] Christian or not is what we do about our
[38:14] mistakes is if we can get up and then we
[38:18] can serve God and say I failed I messed
[38:21] up I want to
[38:23] read a
[38:25] testimony of my grandpa PA's
[38:29] cousin and uh I think you'll enjoy it
[38:32] and let me this is another person that
[38:35] did the same thing that made the same
[38:37] mistake but he had a foundation in his
[38:40] life and he turned his life
[38:43] around he was allowed to
[38:47] sin if you could put up the the
[38:50] quote brother the bram's telling this
[38:53] story he says
[38:55] this brother Ram says I was sitting in a
[38:58] room and I had to hurry out there my
[38:59] wife said now get to this little girl
[39:02] this or this little woman she had two or
[39:04] three little children and I walked in
[39:06] where she was and the only thing I the
[39:08] only the only thing I'd seen her these
[39:11] couple times just know that she belonged
[39:14] to the Methodist Church Main Street
[39:15] Methodist Church in New Albany and she
[39:18] was sitting there holding her hands like
[39:19] this and she said and I said what's the
[39:22] matter sis brother brandom had prayed
[39:24] for her in a prayer line earlier um not
[39:27] that day but sometime
[39:29] earlier and it didn't work and she was
[39:34] terrible with her nerves she was she was
[39:37] losing her mind and she said oh I don't
[39:39] know brother brandom she said I guess
[39:40] I'm just
[39:41] crazy and I said I don't think so you
[39:45] don't talk like a crazy person to me so
[39:47] I had her to get up and and stretch
[39:49] different you see and till I could get
[39:51] her off of that thought I said let's
[39:53] take a little trip and let's go back
[39:55] before the world began let's watch the
[39:57] world come into existence before God had
[40:00] made his first star and so forth like
[40:02] that so he starts preaching Jesus he
[40:04] starts preaching God to her to calm her
[40:07] mind and to raise her faith in a few
[40:09] moments I felt the angel of the Lord
[40:11] pulling me into this Channel and when it
[40:13] did I seen a little black car running
[40:16] like that right across my room and said
[40:19] were you ever in an accident she said no
[40:23] sir see now on a platform I have prayed
[40:27] for her and let her go on see but I had
[40:30] I had her before me and I watched again
[40:32] just a minute the first thing you know
[40:35] here it come I seen a vision break then
[40:37] come right straight in it caught me no
[40:40] way of getting away from it then I said
[40:42] I see a little car you're sitting by a
[40:44] blond-headed man and there's an
[40:46] automobile coming you pass it and
[40:48] there's a big light it's a
[40:49] train and there went the vision she let
[40:53] out a scream and jumped out under the
[40:55] floor and fainted so the vision went on
[40:58] and here it was when she got married
[41:00] just before her husband went overseas
[41:03] just a few weeks she was a young
[41:05] woman he went to war and he went
[41:08] overseas her being a just girl she
[41:11] started running around being Lonesome
[41:13] and she started running around with
[41:15] another man and she went out in a little
[41:18] car with him one night and lived untrue
[41:21] to her marriage vows and on the road
[41:23] home was almost killed by a train told
[41:25] her all about that what she
[41:28] did and then when she raised her up in
[41:32] the floor she began screaming to the top
[41:34] of her voice wife came in there and said
[41:37] why what's the matter she said oh

[44:12] the office and she was wearing a pink
[44:14] dress and she was in a Green Chevrolet
[44:15] car no more than three days ago and he's
[44:18] guilty of the same thing she said no not
[44:19] my
[44:21] husband and I said well you all better
[44:24] get things right you better call them up
[44:26] so me got to talking to her and
[44:28] persuaded her to do it and she went and
[44:30] called her husband they got in the car
[44:32] and met on the
[44:34] road she got in his car and she said now
[44:37] I want to tell you and she confessed all
[44:39] to him and he was looking at her and
[44:41] said now didn't you want to go out with
[44:44] this woman at the office there two or
[44:47] three days before that and you were in a
[44:49] Green Chevrolet car and she was wearing
[44:51] p a
[44:52] pink he said how did you know that where
[44:55] have you been
[44:57] and so she told her so she told her so
[45:01] she told her where where it been he said
[45:04] honey that's the
[45:05] truth and I will admit it's the truth
[45:08] and if you'll forgive me I will forgive
[45:10] you and will raise our children and
[45:13] start a life right in a few minutes here
[45:15] they come back up the steps tears
[45:17] streaming down their
[45:19] cheeks aha Satan lost his hold then see
[45:24] now there's where it's at see now that
[45:26] settled but as long as that sin was
[45:29] under there no matter how loud you
[45:31] scream or how hard you stomp or how much
[45:33] oil you pour on or how loud you pray or
[45:35] how easy you pray or whatever you do the
[45:38] devil will stay right there because
[45:40] there he has a legal right as long as
[45:42] you have unconfessed sin that's right
[45:45] that was my
[45:46] grandfather's cousin who I used to talk
[45:50] to on the
[45:52] phone and he never wanted to talk about
[45:54] that he said no he he says I'll talk
[45:58] about my Ministry he said but I won't
[46:00] talk about that that's personal it's
[46:01] family
[46:02] Things Not only was he a deacon in the
[46:06] church but he also became
[46:08] pastor of the church and had a great
[46:11] ministry in the New Albany
[46:14] area he had when he was faced with sin
[46:19] and he had
[46:20] fallen he had that foundation and he
[46:22] made it right and the other one
[46:25] didn't two foundations one fell and one
[46:30] stood
[46:32] strong
[46:36] closing turn to 1 Corinthians chapter
[46:43] 3 remember Nebuchadnezzar looking at the
[46:45] other holy man looking at Daniel or
[46:48] Shadrach mhach and abedo and saying
[46:50] their
[46:51] God and I follow that their God but it
[46:54] needed to become Nebuchadnezzar's God
[46:58] 1 Corinthians chapter 3 says this and I
[47:00] Brethren could not speak unto you as
[47:02] unto spiritual but as unto carnal even
[47:06] as unto babes in Christ he says I fed
[47:08] you with milk and not with meat for
[47:10] hitherto you were not able to Bear it
[47:14] neither yet now are you these are the
[47:18] people that sat in the book in the
[47:20] church with their
[47:22] notebooks listening to the Apostle Paul
[47:25] the man with the greatest
[47:27] revelation of Jesus Christ on Earth at
[47:30] that time the man that pinned most of
[47:32] the New Testament the man that
[47:34] solidified the deity of Jesus Christ he
[47:37] was the greatest of them all and and
[47:39] here they were they were the ones
[47:40] listening to Paul and Paul says I fed
[47:42] you with milk because you couldn't stand
[47:46] meat he's telling
[47:49] them that you still aren't able to for
[47:53] you are yet carnal for whereas there is
[47:55] among you envying and striving and
[47:57] divisions are you not yet carnal and
[47:59] walk as men for while one says I am of
[48:02] Paul and another I am of
[48:07] apollis are you not carnal for saying
[48:12] that I follow this man I follow that man
[48:16] remember this is the greatest man
[48:19] besides Jesus in the New Testament in my
[48:22] opinion speaking and he's saying you're
[48:25] you're carnal because you're saying
[48:26] you're following
[48:27] me who then is Paul and who then is
[48:31] apoll but ministers by whom you have
[48:34] believed even as the lord gave to every
[48:38] man English Standard Version says what
[48:40] then is apollis and what is Paul
[48:42] servants through whom you believed as
[48:45] the Lord assigned to
[48:47] each the only thing we are is a vessel
[48:51] through which you
[48:53] believed the first church age messenger
[48:56] the messenger the Ephesian Agee the one
[48:58] who was present when the white horse
[49:00] rider started writing all of these deep
[49:02] things in Revelation he's saying that my
[49:04] only role is to be a servant through
[49:07] whom you have believed that doesn't
[49:09] lessen himself that lifts up
[49:14] Christ I have planted apollis watered
[49:18] but God gave the
[49:20] increase there should be no division
[49:23] never division between any church any
[49:25] so-called Christian church or any
[49:27] denomination or anyone who claims Jesus
[49:29] Christ and I'm not talking about local
[49:32] churches I'm talking about any church
[49:36] that calls themselves Christians there
[49:37] should be no no division
[49:41] because our job is only to introduce
[49:45] someone to Christ as Paul said listen
[49:47] I'm
[49:47] nothing my job is to introduce you to
[49:50] Christ and so's Apollos over
[49:53] here so then neither is he that planteth
[49:56] any anything neither is he that WTH but
[50:00] God gave the God but God that giveth the
[50:06] increase he's saying I'm nothing other
[50:09] people elevated him to a god I believe
[50:11] it was on Mars
[50:14] Hill like they like Daniel elevated neb
[50:18] or Nebuchadnezzar elevated Daniel to a
[50:22] god a God is
[50:24] infallible and that's what makes him a
[50:26] god
[50:29] now he that planteth and he that WTH are
[50:31] one and every man shall receive his own
[50:34] according to his own labor for we are
[50:36] laborers together with God ye are God's
[50:38] husbandry that's a
[50:41] field you are God's Building so you're
[50:44] God's field field and you are God's
[50:48] Building he's building this foundation
[50:49] in you according to the grace of God
[50:51] which is given unto me as a wise master
[50:54] builder I have laid the the foundation
[50:57] and another build it there on but let
[50:59] every man take heed how he builds there
[51:04] on so the Apostle Paul he's built the
[51:06] foundation just as a concrete mason will
[51:09] will pour the slab and you got to have
[51:11] your subgrade right you got to have all
[51:12] your compaction right you got have your
[51:13] Steel in your in your concrete and you
[51:16] build that and then the the framers come
[51:19] in and they build the house but imagine
[51:22] if they built the house and it didn't
[51:25] fit the slab
[51:27] imagine if you're putting the 2x4s over
[51:29] in the gravel beside the beside the
[51:32] concrete it won't
[51:34] work but you build upon that Foundation
[51:38] that was
[51:41] laid for other Foundation can no man lay
[51:45] than is laid which is Christ
[51:48] Jesus that is the
[51:50] foundation let's skip to verse 18 let no
[51:54] man deceive himself if any man among you
[51:56] seems be wise in this world let him
[51:58] become a fool that he may be
[52:01] wise how many
[52:03] arrogant and prideful people would say I
[52:06] know I'm
[52:07] right I know I'm right I know this is
[52:10] the truth and nobody can tell me any
[52:11] different that was Nebuchadnezzar the
[52:15] Gentile Paul's saying and it's probably
[52:18] offending n90 90% of the people he's
[52:21] writing to in that Corinthian Church
[52:24] he's saying don't deceive yourself you
[52:26] may think you got it but it's
[52:29] foolishness for the wisdom of this world
[52:31] is foolishness with God for it is
[52:33] written he taketh the wise in their own
[52:35] craftiness and again the Lord knoweth
[52:37] the thoughts of the wise that they are
[52:39] vain therefore let no man glory in men
[52:43] as Nebuchadnezzar did for all things are
[52:49] yours what matters is Christ and he's
[52:52] about to say what
[52:54] matters whether Paul Paul or Apollos or
[52:59] sephus really three of the greatest men
[53:01] in the whole new testament sephus is
[53:04] Peter whether Paul or Apollos of sephus
[53:07] or the world or life or death or things
[53:09] present or things to come all are yours
[53:13] if you have that
[53:15] foundation and you're Christ and Christ
[53:19] is
[53:21] God's I say it a
[53:24] lot musicians can come a close
[53:28] there is nothing that matters in life
[53:32] other than introducing someone to that
[53:35] Foundation Building that Foundation
[53:37] which is Christ really the greatest of
[53:40] them all the Apostle here he says I'm
[53:42] nothing but I'm just a tool in God's
[53:45] hand to introduce you to Jesus Christ we
[53:50] see the two
[53:52] men the one his name is Wilber Shane um
[53:56] which is is my U my grandpa's cousin uh
[53:59] cousin-in-law and then this other man
[54:03] and we see one took the
[54:07] opportunity to run away and that house
[54:10] failed the other one as humbled as he
[54:13] was and as low as he got he humbled
[54:16] himself and then God
[54:19] restored him not only to be a
[54:23] deacon but God restored him so much that
[54:25] he eventually became a minister and led
[54:29] a church for many years became a
[54:32] wonderful
[54:34] man and that's
[54:36] us we fail we mess up but let that be
[54:42] the foundation that we're
[54:46] building and that Foundation Let It Be
[54:49] Christ and not some other man not
[54:51] somebody else not a pastor as I said not
[54:54] you got to have your own you got to have
[54:56] your own relationship there
[55:00] amen and the good way to start that
[55:04] Foundation is to be baptized according
[55:06] to this Bible according to acts
[55:10] 238 according to the Book of
[55:12] Romans where we go into that
[55:17] water and we are making a public
[55:19] confession that now I accept this man
[55:24] Jesus Christ I want to take on his name
[55:26] name I want to be part of him I want to
[55:30] be one of these Christians that this
[55:32] Bible talks about I want to be one of
[55:34] those
[55:35] people I'm going to go into this water
[55:37] I'm going to be baptized I'm going to be
[55:40] put underwater I'm going to come back up
[55:42] and that represents a sinner that is me
[55:47] being washed
[55:49] clean by the death of Jesus
[55:54] Christ that's what baptism
[55:58] means that's why it says Washed by the
[56:01] Water of the word that's why it says
[56:03] that we were we were dead in the Book of
[56:06] Romans we were we were dead and we went
[56:08] into the grave and we came back up a new
[56:10] creature that's what baptism is we take
[56:14] on the name we baptize in the name of
[56:16] Jesus Christ because we want to be
[56:18] associated with him Christian you're not
[56:21] being baptized into a church you're
[56:24] being baptized into a body
[56:26] into a body of
[56:29] Christians so when you are
[56:32] baptized and there is someone else who
[56:35] believes in Jesus Christ there is
[56:36] someone else who has also taken on this
[56:39] name you are
[56:41] Brethren it makes you a brother it makes
[56:44] it makes you a Christ it doesn't make
[56:46] you a Christian it shows that you're a
[56:48] Christian when you're baptized and it
[56:51] shows that I believe in the blood of
[56:52] Jesus Christ that will wash away my sins
[56:56] and that Foundation gets
[57:00] built and
[57:02] nothing nothing will hinder that
[57:04] Foundation if it's strong and it's in
[57:06] Christ if it's built on the words of a
[57:08] man if it's built on if it's built on
[57:09] your mother if it's built on your father
[57:11] if it's built on your grandmother if
[57:13] it's built on anything else but Jesus
[57:16] Christ it'll
[57:17] fail but if it is built on him it'll
[57:20] always stand strong and let me tell you
[57:23] something you can live your life
[57:25] studying him and studying his word and
[57:28] you can't even scratch the surface of
[57:30] how great he is you can't even scratch
[57:32] the surface of the love that that man
[57:34] had and the love that he still has you
[57:37] can't and he is always willing to take
[57:41] you back brother Manny can 43 years
[57:46] man and he chose him at 50 years old to
[57:50] deliver deliver I remember I
[57:53] was reading my Bible one time I was
[57:56] really down it just made a big decision
[57:58] in my life and I opened up the Bible to
[58:01] the book of
[58:02] Acts I was
[58:04] repenting really
[58:08] down and I I looked and it said Saul
[58:13] Saul why persecute us without me it's
[58:15] hard for you to kick against the
[58:17] pricks I said Lord I just don't
[58:19] understand that what does it
[58:23] mean the Lord directed my my eyes
[58:27] over to the margin and it and explain
[58:30] what the Pricks was it was actually a a
[58:33] tool used to prod
[58:36] cattle and then the Lord showed me this
[58:39] is what I've always done to
[58:42] you I've always tried to get you to move
[58:45] in this
[58:47] direction but because of your head
[58:49] strongness you always kick back at
[58:53] me and it took just cleaning the Slate
[58:57] until he was finally able to deal with
[59:00] me and push me in the direction that he
[59:03] wanted me to go and that's the Apostle
[59:06] Paul here he had his
[59:08] religion he had his his rules he had his
[59:13] his Torah he had his understanding and
[59:16] it was not right and here he Paul is and
[59:19] he's kicking and kicking and kicking and
[59:21] persecuting and persecuting and persec
[59:23] finally the Lord put him on his back
[59:27] and
[59:28] says why do you persecute me and he
[59:31] didn't know he says I thought I was
[59:33] doing right but he wasn't doing right he
[59:36] was sinning and every time he would sin
[59:39] God had give him a
[59:40] poke and he
[59:43] says who are you Lord and he says I'm
[59:46] Jesus the one that you're
[59:49] persecuting and then Paul went and was
[59:53] baptized it's a good first step brother
[59:56] if you want to go if there's anybody
[59:58] else to be baptized just go back and and
[1:00:01] see the the brothers in the back the if
[1:00:04] there's a sister that you can see the
[1:00:05] sisters in the back and then we'll bring
[1:00:07] you up and and baptize you as I said
[1:00:11] it's a good time to build a
[1:00:14] foundation

[1:08:06] you
[1:08:13] more we're waiting for Brother
[1:08:16] Christian here he comes it's uh it's
[1:08:21] it's nice brother Jordan I'm getting
[1:08:23] feedback up here
[1:08:26] there we
[1:08:27] go it's nice that
[1:08:31] um I mentioned that scripture that I
[1:08:34] have planted apollis watered but God
[1:08:38] gave the
[1:08:40] increase so what happened was come on in
[1:08:42] you're Christian right here so what
[1:08:44] happened was our young brother here was
[1:08:46] you're at a youth camp am I
[1:08:48] right he's at a youth camp and you're
[1:08:50] driving
[1:08:51] home from uh from the camp from the
[1:08:54] church camp
[1:08:57] and the pastor was talking to him about
[1:09:01] being
[1:09:02] baptized and
[1:09:04] it Spurs something in his heart the
[1:09:08] Bible says that in Acts chapter 2 it
[1:09:12] said that Peter preached those words and
[1:09:14] they were cut in their hearts and then
[1:09:18] they asked they said what must we do to
[1:09:22] receive the Holy Spirit and Peter said
[1:09:24] repent every one of you and be baptized
[1:09:27] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:09:28] remission of your sins and you shall
[1:09:31] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:09:33] that's what happened to our brother here
[1:09:35] the the pastor was witnessing to
[1:09:37] him
[1:09:39] and it cut his
[1:09:43] heart and he felt that he wants to be
[1:09:46] baptized and take on this name of Jesus
