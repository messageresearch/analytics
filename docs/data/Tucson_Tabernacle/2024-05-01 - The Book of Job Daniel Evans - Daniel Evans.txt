over to brother Daniel this morning when I woke up I was reading in job this song just kind of came came to me and those of you remember brother green he would sing this a few times I know he sang it at Harmony once and I don't know if this was exactly his was it maybe his theme song CU when he came out to the pulpit he would a lot of times sing he is Lord or tell us give his testimony he'd close with on the wings of a snow white dove but he would sing this song maybe just as his own personal song and I just thought it would be good good fit for tonight it's called job's God is true though God slay me I think some of you Old-Timers will remember it if you know it we're going to put the words on the screen brother Jeremy and we can try singing this here let's try the course though though God

forth as go and I know that he's still [Music] living God bless you brothers and sisters it's good to see everyone out in the house of the Lord tonight let's let's bow our heads for prayer our heavenly father Lord just to think that the same God that we are praying to tonight is the same God that thousands of years ago that job prayed to and that spoke back to job I what have thought you are the almighty never changing ever loving long suffering god father we thank you the opportunity tonight to open up this book we pray father that you'd be with us tonight and Lord the revelations would come forward from this book that we could apply to our own lives and walk closer to you as job walked with you in Jesus name amen amen God bless you all you can take your seats I uh I was sorry hear about uh brother Penrod he um how many people knew brother herb yeah a lot of people longtime member of the Tucson Tabernacle him him and his family I know Stephanie and I when we were kids we used to run around with Nicole and Rebecca and and herb jior and the family so when these people when they leave it's it brings back memories I um I think it's This Book of Job is as we dig into it I think it it really fits perfectly I believe it's really the divine order of God that it's coming after Sunday service which was seeking first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and then all things that you need will be added to you I believe job personified that he the greatest thing in his life the most important thing was that that he would please God and that he would he would walk in the attributes and in the admonition of God and then before that then the week before last week I I spoke on the Prince of Persia and how a demon went to battle with these archangels G Gabriel and Michael and we can see he was delayed this this angel that was coming to Daniel was delayed 21 days because something was going on in a realm that that we just we don't understand and that we can't see and we see this same thing happen a similar Thing Happened Here In This Book of Job where Satan comes to God and does what he does accuses job and um this this book of job in studying this this week it's it's a bit of an an anomaly in the Bible it's it's Unique um it's just different it's different than all the other books I see that no it's mentioned in Ezekiel that Ezekiel puts job right up there with Daniel and with Noah so no this man job he really was this this story really did happen and then we even look in the in the New Testament in the Book of James that he says he says you've heard of the patience of Job so this this book is a very powerful and a very special book it's a story really of the carnal human being it's a story of of real life really that we can all relate to it's a book of questions between God and man between man and man and questions between even God and Satan and it's all of these questions they really add up to one question and that's why do bad things happen to good people we can see here that job was a very very good person the me the even the name job it means persecuted so job was he was a righteous man he was a perfect man and when the Bible says perfect it's not necessarily the same as we would think of perfection it's God looks at perfection in a different way that we look at Perfection we might see that someone has all many different problems and God might look down upon that per person and see that that person is really is perfect before him and then we might see someone as being perfect before God and then God might look down at that person in their deeds and see just filthy rags before him so God's ways as we know God's ways are not our ways his thoughts are not our thoughts he doesn't look the same as we look job was he was a rich man he had seven sons and three daughters he had lots of lots of assets and camels and sheep and donkeys and he really he had it all and he lost it all and it made me think how job was a rich man he knew how it was to be rich and then he found out how it was to be probably the poorest man on Earth Philippians 4 11 and 12 another man that was another great man in the Bible this man Paul he says this he says not that I speak in respect of want for I have learned that in whatsoever State I am therewith to be content I know how to both be abased and I know how to abound everywhere and in all things I instructed both to be full and to be hungry both to abound and to suffer need so we see that this I wonder if Paul maybe looked back on this book of Job and read it when he was when he was writing certain things that he wrote it was probably written job as we know is most likely the oldest book in the Bible so does that mean the oldest book of the Bible doesn't mean it goes back before Genesis and records that time it's actually probably the oldest book that was actually written down and we see that how do we know how old this book is well number one we see that job's wealth is measured in the number of animals he possessed rather than how much money he had or how much gold he had there's no reference in job to any other book of the Bible and there's no reference to any other prophet and neither is there reference to any of the Israelites unlike pretty much every other book in the Bible he doesn't reference the sons and the daughters of Abraham and another way the we know it's very old is right at the last of the chap Last of The Book of Job we see that job lived to be 140 years old that's old so what Pro when it was probably written as Abraham lived to be 175 years old so we can guess that job was the Book of Job was probably written right around the time of Abraham maybe a little bit before maybe a little bit after we know that it was written After the flood because Before the Flood they lived really old hundreds of years after the flood we see that their age starts dwindling down Abraham I think was 175 I think Isaac was like 180 and then Jacob I think was like 140 or 110 or 120 something like that and it just gets less and less before ultimately it comes to about 75 years old sometime after Moses so we can pretty much put this book of Job between the anti- deluvian destruction which is the flood and Moses because he doesn't quote anything else Moses wrote Genesis so Moses wrote from the beginning all the way down but job most likely lived well before Moses lived so job didn't have the bible to read the characters in the book of job are job and his wife plays a a brief part in there as I mentioned before Satan is there job's friends he has three of these friends bildad elifaz and zofar and then another young man comes in at the end named elu and then God himself speaks in this book so job lived it says in the land of us which is today Southern Jordan it's a desert desolate area today so let's dig into the book Let's Open up The Book of Job and turn to chapter 1 verse one there was a man in the land of us whose name was job and that man was perfect and upright and one that feared God and asted Evil that word ASU is Old English it's not used today it means that he turned away from evil or he shunned evil and that word perfect as I said before in other translations it it it means blameless or it means without reproach so as we read the book of job then you you'll see that he is in no way a perfect man by our definition of the word but our thinking as I said is far away from God's thinking so we might see some faults in job but when God looks down on them you'll see see that God saw a perfect man before him verse number two and there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters as I mentioned he has 10 children his substance also was 7,000 sheep and 3,000 camels and 500 Yol of oxen and 500 she asses and very great household so that this man was the greatest of all the men in the East and his sons went and feasted in their houses everyone his day and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them and it was so then when the days of their feasting were gone about that job sent and Sac Sanctified them and Rose up early in the morning and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all for job said it may be that my sons have sented and cursed God in their hearts thus did job continually I could easily spend the rest of the lesson just on that verse Not only was job concerned about his kids but he was willing to do something about it he probably saw weaknesses in his children and imagine how difficult just physically difficult it would be to offer burnt offerings not just one time for all of your children but he offered them individually for each child and not just once he did it continually this was a lot this was a great sacrifice that job made by making these burnt offering sacrifices now right at the beginning of the story here we're going to see that it goes into the spiritual realm and it goes up into heaven The Story Goes where God is it says this now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord and Satan came also among them so who is this Satan we we we think we know you know it's it's a devil but the word Satan it's a Hebrew word it means the accuser it means the adversary it's almost more proper to call him the Satan rather rather than just Satan because he is the accuser he is the one that is always against God's people and the Lord said unto Satan whence comest thou then Satan answered Ed the Lord and said from going to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down in it now notice here that Satan is not everywhere he's not what we would call omnipresent he moves around he moves here and there and his angels or his underlings they they go out and and they serve him and they do his bidding but this spirit this Satan is singular this is one being that is having this discussion here with God and the Lord said unto Satan hast thou considered my servant job that there is none like him in the earth a perfect and upright man one that fearth God and asth Evil then Satan answered the Lord and said does job fear God for not does job fear God for no reason has not Thou made a hedge around him and about his house and about all that he hath on every side thou Hast blessed the work of his hands and his substance is increased in the land but put forth thine hand now and touch all that he hath and he will curse thee to thy face now notice the nature of Satan again he's an accuser he's in the presence of God so he's not in hell you know we think of Satan being in hell with his Pitchfork and the Flames going everywhere and his demons going around that's not how it is Satan probably has it pretty good right now and he's got a job and his job is to accuse the Brethren before the Lord and the and the sister when I say Brethren I mean I mean the people and the Lord said unto Satan behold all that he hath is in thy power only upon himself put not forth thine hand so Satan went forth from the presence of God so again things aren't like we think they are in our minds notice how God knows what's going on and Satan knows what's going on in this situation so we have God and Satan have this discussion they know they know what's going to happen but poor job has no idea what's going on he's probably just having a cup of coffee with his wife going through his day maybe taking inventory of his sheep and and wondering how we should take care of uh the South pasture or whatever so right after this meeting in heaven when Satan leaves the presence of God then tragedy strikes and his livestock they're either stolen or fire actually comes down from heaven and kills them kills his servants with them and then Invaders come and then they kill they take a bunch of other livestock and they kill more of his servants and the worst thing of all past losing all of his wealth Jose um job's oldest son has all of his brothers and his sisters over to his house and a great wind comes it might be a tornado or some sort of powerful wind and it it breaks the house down the house collapses and kills all of his children so I don't know how things could be worse than that those of us that are parents imagine not one child one child is devastating but all of your children let's skip to verse 20 then job arose and rent his mantle he ripped his garment and he shaved his head and he fell down upon the ground and he worshiped now Jo job handles this situation really believe this man job seems like a Christian long before Jesus came yeah all the way back in our study on the Bible in Genesis we see that the holy spirit is manifesting itself in the first chapter of Genesis when the spirit of God moved across the face of the deep so we see the holy spirit all the way back in Genesis so now we see this Holy Spirit shining forth from a man thousands of years ago who had just lost everything and watch the character of this man job and that's what I will keep saying he he he shaved his head which was a sign of mourning and he fell down to the ground now this could all be expected most people would would do something like that mourning that their loved ones were gone and remember and I'll say this a few times tonight Jo did not have a Bible job didn't have a pastor that was teaching him the word of God job was missing this he couldn't read and and and get encouragement from a promise of God he didn't have it right he didn't have a promise of a comforter he didn't have a promise of a messiah the one thing that job had is the thing that so many of us desire brother and sisters I desire it more than anything the one thing that job had was a relationship with God and that brought him through as we see when we go through this book he fell on the ground he worshiped God he worshiped God he was mourning struggling his whole life had just been destroyed and what did does he do look at his character he falls down and he worships what a what a wonderful thing I mean how many of us would be doing that we'd be I'd be we may be a nervous wrecker or wanting to go to the hospital or whatever it is but job gets down on his knees falls down and just worships his Lord his character is almost without equal and you see how God calls him perfect he was perfect because even in the worst of times where the worst imaginable things happen the worse than any sinner on Earth at that time happened to that person yet at this time he worshiped God I mentioned the Apostle Paul before let me mention him again 2 Corinthians chapter 12 verse 7 he says this and lest I should be exalted above measures through the abundance of Revelation there was given to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of Satan to Buffet me lest I should be exalted above me this is very similar to what we're going to learn right now lest I be exalted above meas measure job was a good man and he was a humble man but he thought that he was always doing right for this thing I besought the Lord Thrice that it might depart from me and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ May rest upon me therefore I take my pleasure in infirmities in reproaches in necessities and persecution in distress for Christ's sake for when I am weak then I am strong as I said before I wonder if Paul maybe was reading the book of Job when he was struggling with that thorn in his flesh how how many people have have been comforted Through The Years with this book when they've had problems and I believe maybe that that Paul probably was comforted also so you see job and his character it rises to the top during the weakest moments of his life we've heard prophecy about a squeeze we've heard it talked about a lot about a squeeze maybe that's going to come on God's children and you think a you think about a squeeze and when you when you squeeze an orange orange juice comes out when you take a lemon and you squeeze a lemon then lemon juice comes out so when the squeeze is put on job watch what comes out of him it's nothing but the holy spirit that comes out on job and what about us when the trials get hard and the pressure comes down and and maybe there's there's arguing or or something between us when we're squeezed what comes out of us is it the Holy Spirit like it is with this man job job 1:20 it says this again and then job arose and rent his mantel and shaved his head and fell down upon the ground and he worshiped and said naked came I out of my mother's womb and naked shall I return tother the lord gave and the Lord hath taken away blessed be the name of the Lord wow in all this job s not nor charged God foolishly so then if we go to verse chapter 2 so what I'm going to do is we'll read chapter one which we just did we'll read chapter two and then we will go through the the book of jobs in a few different portions the first part of it is this going on with with Satan coming down and afflicting job and killing his family and killing his livestock and and doing what Satan does and then job you see his reaction and he worships the Lord and then after this then we will come to job has three friends that come visit him to comfort him and then that is most of the book there and we will go through that quickly and then the the story ends with a a bit of a Twist I think most of us know the end of the book but there's some things in there that you probably never notice that I like to point out when we get to the end so chapter 2 again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord and Satan came also among them to present himself before the Lord and the Lord said unto Satan from whence comest thou and Satan answered the Lord and said from going to and fro in the Earth from walking up and down in it again this spirit is saying I've been going around making my rounds looking at the people studying the people watching them maybe finding their weaknesses going back and forth he's an evil just a sneaky guy this Satan is and the Lord said unto Satan hast thou considered my servant job that there is none like him in the earth a perfect and upright man one that fearth God and a steth evil one that turns Away From Evil and still he holdeth F fast his integrity although thou movest me against him to destroy him without a cause he says okay Satan you just took everything from him and what did he do he fell down and worshiped me that's my boy I'm proud of him and Satan answered the Lord and said skin for skin yeah all that a man hath will he give for his life but put forth thine hand now and touch his bone and his flesh and he will curse thee to thy face look at Satan this evil spirit brothers and sisters people always think that you will act like they will act or that you will react like they will react you see the most paranoid people about other people talking about them are usually the biggest gossipers and the biggest accus accusers the ones who have the most are the most concerned with money are usually the ones who have the biggest financial problems at home wow the ones who are the ones who are most worried about someone taking something from them are the ones who are quick to take something from someone else the ones who are always worried about getting ripped off are usually the ones who are willing to rip someone off I'm I'm making General statements here I know and usually not always but usually the most trusting people are the ones that can be trusted the most and you see the character of Satan here and he cares this man Satan he cares about one person and that is himself and that is a characteristic of Satan he thinks about this guy and every decision he makes every every time he does anything it it is to promote himself or to further his cause we never see Satan paying compliments to someone else unless he's doing it to get what he wants and here he really thinks that job is gonna act like he would act if you take my health I'll curse you to your face if you take something from me if you make me miserable it's all about me so I'm going to fight you God I'm going to forsake this whole thing this Christianity how many times do I seen someone start to go to church give their life to the Lord and watch how hard it is on them they'll get in a car wreck or they'll they'll have financial problems or something big will happen and that is that testing time and here we see Satan he's like okay here's what I would do if this happened to me I'd be out let me do that to him and God says okay do it don't take his life and the Lord said to Satan behold he is in thine hand but save his life one thing here this happened twice now do you notice that Satan can only do his work by permission from God remember Jesus casted out the evil spirit from the insane man and they asked permission can we go into these these pigs and then Jesus said go and do it remember when the lying Spirit came before God to ask permission to go into ahab's prophets to deceive him so that he would go to battle and die in battle remember that they asked permission it is only by God's permission so when these bad things happen to us just remember God knows about it and God allowed it to happen this is exactly what happens to job so so went Satan forth from the presence of the Lord and smokee job with sore boils from The Souls sole of his foot unto his crown and he took him a a potur of to scrape himself with all and he sat down among the ashes now this potur is um it's a it's a piece of broken pottery with a sharp edge and I assume it was some sort of a treatment that he was doing for sick people he was scraping off probably the dying flesh later on in the book that we won't read it but job describes his sores as even having worms in them probably had maggots in there and later he describes pain in his bones so he was sick all the way to the Bone it wasn't just scraping boils this man job was deathly deathly ill and he was suffering he had lost his wealth he had lost his children and now he' lost his health thank goodness he had a loving wife at home to take care of him and then said his wife unto him Dost thou still retain thine in Integrity Curse God and die I guess not but he said unto her thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh what shall we receive good at the hand of God and shall we not receive evil and all of this did not job sin even with his lips what a profound statement that we are here on Earth to just receive what we're not here on Earth to just receive good and not the bad we always think God's always loving he's always taking care of us he's always given us all these good things and he has All Good Things Come From God but don't forget that God sends us the hard times too because it's good for us but look at this man's Integrity no matter what happened he glorified God now when job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him they came everyone from his own place elifaz the tanite and bildad the shuhite and zofar the nthite for they had made an appointment o together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him and when they lifted up their eyes AAR off and knew him not they lifted up their voices and wept and they rent everyone his mantle and sprinkled dust upon their head toward heaven and they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights and none spake a word unto him for they saw that his grief was very great now what they did here was very good very kind and it's probably comforting for job here are his friends and they're staying with him for a week and they're mourning his losses and if they didn't talk with him that probably meant that job didn't talk with them they were just there for him and brothers and sisters when we're comforting someone who is grieving either for a lost loved one or may maybe they're having a hard time in life most of the time the best comfort that you can give someone is to just listen just let them talk because sometimes you just got to get it off your chest and you just need somebody that loves you enough just to hear and not to start telling you stories about how they overcame this or or I know exactly how you feel and I've done this and and and I was in this situation then all of a sudden it becomes about the comforter which is what you're going to see here in the Book of Job and not about the person that actually needs Comfort it helps when someone just listens and I think that it was very nice when they were there at first and they were just listening seven days they stayed with him but one of the biggest lessons in the book is that these three guys they never really put themselves in job's shoes they they looked at the situation they looked at what has happened and they jumped to the conclusion that this job must have sinned and sinned and brought all of this upon himself and what they didn't know in all of their condemnation that they were actually the ones speaking on behalf of Satan himself because they were the ones accusing so there's that Spirit up with God again saying let me do this let me go down I'll take I'll take his family I'll take his health I'll take his wealth I'll take everything and now that condemning Spirit look at how it gets in these three friends so job's three three three friends now they begin this dialogue back and forth where they each accuse accuse job of sinning because all of these bad things that happened to him elifaz is the first one here he says this in chapter 4 and I'll read his accusation and they pretty much all say the same thing just in different ways and then job will defend himself and he defends himself many times in the same way so let's let's turn to chapter 4 verse one then elifaz the temanite answered and said if we assay to commune with thee wilt thou be grieved but who can withhold himself from speaking so he's warning job he's saying Hey listen you're not going to like what I'm about to say and he's saying that but I just can't hold back in speaking to you yeah because you're just such a sinner job you're doing so much wrong this it just Grieves me so much I can't hold back I got to tell you and it's because it's about this elaz and it's not about comforting job let's skip to verse seven remember I pray thee whoever perished being innocent whoever suffered for being innocent job you're suffering or where were the righteous cut off even as I have seen that they plow iniquity and sow Wicked wickedness and reap the same so those that spread W wickedness they reap the same wickedness look at what he's insinuating he's saying you've sinned job and that's why all this wickedness Came Upon you by the blast of God they perish and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed notice they're invoking God here this is a religious discussion The Roaring of The Lion and the voice of the fierce Lion and the teeth of the Young Lions are broken he's saying no matter how great you are job God's Gonna Cut You Down man God's Gonna rip you apart The Old Lion perished for the lack of prey and the Stout Lion's welps are scouted abroad now a thing was secretly brought to me and my ear received a little thereof in thoughts from the visions of the night when deep sleep falleth on men fear Came Upon me and trembling which made all my bones to shake he's saying job I had this experience with God and it was about you then a spirit passed before my face the hair of my flesh stood up it stood still but I could not discern the form thereof an image was before mine eyes there was silence and I heard a voice saying shall Mortal Mortal men be more just than God shall a man be more pure than his maker behold he put no trust in his servants and his angels he charged with with Folly how much less in them that dwell in the house houses of clay whose Foundation is in the dust which are crushed before the moth they are destroyed from the morning to the evening they perish forever without any regarding it doth not their Excellency which is in them go away they die even without wisdom so this man is say he's saying job God told me that you're a sinner I don't care how righteous you look on the outside and how much you've helped others you are a sinner because I had this experience I don't doubt that elifaz had an experience in the night and I don't doubt that he was sure that it was from God but my question is was his experience that seem so much like God was it from God or was it from the deceiver the accuser always all of us we have to be so careful we can have an experience this man had an experience but this was not from god so let's uh let's continue on let's skip to um let's skip to job let's skip to verse chapter six so job is he's being accused by these men and now job he wants to give he he starts to give his answer to all these accusations and look at how humble job is and look at look at how that he responds he says Job chapter 6:8 he says oh that I might have my request and that God would grant me the thing that I long for even that it would please God to destroy me that he would let loose his hand and cut me off so then later on this goes back and forth between these men and job and in chapter 14 job responds to Z zofar Jo zofar is saying the same thing he's accusing job of of sinning secretly now remember job doesn't have a bible to read job doesn't have stories that we know of that that God had done these Great and Mighty things like part in the Red Sea or or that doing the great things that he did with Abraham and and all of these things before but all he had this job he had dead children he had complete poverty he had a wife that hates him and his God had forsaken him and here's job this was a very very bad situation job is absolutely dying his friends are here and they're accusing him and job must have been thinking what did I do wrong what have I done I look at all these other people they're all they're all sinning and I'm just doing my best I was trying to make an offering for my children and then look what happened all 10 of them died and this had to come from God Fire doesn't come out from heaven and kill your livestock this had to come from God so here's job and he's contemplating these things and he doesn't have a Bible to he doesn't have the Book of Job to read and he looks out and he [Music] sees a stump of a tree that had been cut off a dead tree and he looks and he sees where the saw had cut it off and he sees this dead tree and he sees out of this tree is growing life shoots green is coming out of this tree and he looks at it and he sees God in all this and he he looks at himself and he says look at me I'm dying my children are dying and he says oh if that tree can live then can't a man live maybe my children could they live again let's turn to Chapter 14 verse one and as he looks out he says this man that is born of a woman is a few days and full of trouble he cometh forth like a flower and is cut down he fleeth also as a shadow and continueth not and doth thou open Thine Eyes Upon such a one and bringest me into judgment with thee who can bring a clean thing out of an uncan not one seeing his days are determined the number of his months are with thee thou Hast appointed his bonds that he cannot pass turn from him that he may rest till he shall accomplish as a hirling his day for there is a hope of a tree if it be cut down that it will Sprout again and that the tender Branch thereof will not cease it will continue to live though the root thereof waxes old in the earth and the stock thereof die in the ground yet through the scent of water it will bud and bring forth boughs like a plant but a man dies and he Wast away yeah a man give giveth up The Ghost and where is he as the waters fail from the sea and as the flood decayeth and dry up so man lith down and riseth not till the heavens be no more they shall not awake nor be raised out of their sleep he's like this tree was dead and now it's living He says oh that thou would hide me in the grave that thou wouldest keep me secret until thy wrath be passed that thou wouldest appoint me a set time and remember me there's job and he's reading this Bible in nature and he's seeing the resurrection of the plants and of the flowers and of this tree and he says if a man die shall he live again all the days of my appointed time will I wait till my change Come Thou shalt call and I will answer thee thou wil have a desire to the work of thy hands job saw the resurrection he didn't have a bible to read he didn't have a promise of a Rapture he didn't know what the Rapture was he probably never heard of a of a Rapture or or of a resurrection or any of this but job looked and he saw nature he said how beautiful maybe there's hope there that I will see my family again my children look at the Revelation in this man of God then in chapter 19 again they're attacking him and they're they're accusing him all this and job responds again and he says all my inward friends verse 19 chapter 19 verse 19 all my inward friends they me they detest me and they whom I love are turned against me my bone cleaveth to my skin and to My Flesh and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth have pity upon me and have pity upon me oh ye friends oh ye my friends for the hand of God ha touched me he's saying just have pity on me I'm struggling hand of God has touched me and been hard on me why do you persecute me as God are are and are not satisfied with my flesh are you not satisfied that I'm dying here why would you persecute me as God and are not satisfied with my flesh oh that my words were now written oh that they were printed in a book that's pretty cool that his words job said this before there was a Bible printed before there was a Torah before there was writings of Moses before there was anything he said oh that my words were printed in a book that they were Graven with an iron pin and a lead rock forever they're better than that job that would be long gone by now but we are reading your words tonight in the Tucson Tabernacle for I know that my redeemer Li liveth and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the Earth and though after my skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh I see I see God again nothing but Revelation here from job there was something in him that knew that there was a life beyond this life so then chapters 27 through 31 it's a monologue by job and he's talking about his past life experiences and his and his present situation where everything had just Fallen apart and then in chapters 32 through 37 are spoken of by this young man named elu this is different than the other three this young man elu was full of wisdom he rebukes first thing he says first thing he does is he rebukes these other three guys and then he speaks to job and he speaks in a different Spirit but it is correction we don't have time to read through it but he basically tells job he says trust God in these things then chapter 38 the Lord answered job out of a whirlwind now God is going to speak we've had all brother Jonathan we had all this back and forth we've had all this this fighting and job is just dying and he's he's trying to trying to just redeem something of his life and we see these three men and they're attacking him and now God steps on the scene then the Lord answered job out of the worldwind and said who is it that dark darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge G up now thy loins like a man for I will demand of thee and answer thou me he's said get up job you've suffered enough now stand up like a man and you are going to get an answer from the almighty God right now where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth declare if thou Hast understanding the Lord is saying right here this is me speaking who hath laid the measures thereof if thou knowest or who hath stretched the line upon it whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened or who laid the Cornerstone thereof when the morning Stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for Joy the Lord goes on to speak he's basically saying job I know you've defended yourself but you're not all that either yes you've made your defense but don't forget who I am with all the arguing and all the back and forth even the greatest of men are nothing when it comes to God he says where were you when I laid the foundations of the Earth let me hear your understand understanding of a job do you think it compares to mine so the Lord goes on and job humbly answers in chapter 40 verse three job says this then job answered the Lord and said behold I am vile what shall I answer Thee I will lay my hand upon my mouth once have I spoken but I will not answer yay twice but I will proceed no further then the Lord goes on speaking to job and telling him hey you don't know about any of this stuff I'm God I created all this and let me see if you can do anything that I've done job so he's in chapter 41 I like I like what he said this he talked he was telling job about this Le the Leviathan which is some sort of a sea creature some sort of enormous whale or a shark or some big giant thing in the sea and in verses 1-8 chapter 41 God says how about this Leviathan he says can you catch him with a hook job he says can you put a hook in his nose can you play with him like a bird can you fill his skin with harpoons or his head with fishing Spears he's like how how do you measure up to just this big fish job he says lay your hands on him one time and remember the battle and then he says and you won't ever forget it Lord continues on in the same passion just making sure job knows who he's talking to and job continues to Humble himself remember the siap phenician woman when she came to Jesus and Jesus said basically like I'm not called to you people and then he called her a dog and she said Lord even the dogs eat from the master's table you see the nature of Jesus here and God's doing the same thing right here to Job chapter 42:1 job humbles himself again and shows his character then job answered the Lord and said I know that thou cast do everything and that no thought can be withholden from thee who is he that hideth the counsel without knowledge therefore have I uttered that I understood not things too wonderful for me which I knew not he's job is saying Lord all of these things that you're saying they're too great for me to understand he said here I beseech thee and I will speak job speaking he said I will demand of thee and declare thou unto me that's 1600's English Modern English would say that job is saying here Lord and I will here Lord listen to me and I will speak I will question you and I will and you will make it known to me I have heard of thee by the hearing of the year but now mine eye seeth thee wherefore I have bore myself and repent in dust and Ashes and it was so that after the Lord had spoken these word unto job that the Lord said unto elifaz the Tonite remember his first buddy there the first one that spoke now the Lord sets his eyes on him and he said my wrath is kindled against thee and against your two friends for you have not spoken of me the thing that is right as my servant job hath remember the experience that he had at night and he had this passed by him and he had this great powerful thing and God's like that wasn't me he says this and it was so that after the Lord where where are we verse eight verse let me read verse seven and it was so that after the Lord had spoken these words unto job that the Lord said to elifaz the Tonite my wrath is kindled against thee and against thy two friends for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right as my servant job hath remember now elah who is not in this group therefore take unto you now seven Bullocks and seven Rams and go to my servant job the one that you've been persecuting the one that you've been calling a sinner the one that has lost everything now you go to him and offer up for yourselves burnt offering and my servant job shall pray for you for him will I accept lest I deal with you after your Folly in that ye have not spoken of me the thing which is right like my servant job I love that part all that job went through all their com condemnation God tells them to Humble themselves before job and have him pray for them there's another story in the Bible I just thought about it that uh Abraham and uh the king when Abraham lied about his wife being his sister and the King took Sarah to be his wife and all of a sudden all these bad things started to happen in his kingdom and God comes to this King and says you have another man's wife and the King's like wait a minute I didn't know he told me he was a sister and then God says well go and have him pray for you the one that lied Abraham because he was God's man so elifaz the Tonite and bildad the shuhite and zofar the nthite went and did according as the Lord commanded them the Lord also accepted job and the Lord turned the Captivity of job when he prayed for his friends also the lord gave job twice as much as he had before notice that job had something to do he had something to do in all this too he had repented he he he had humbled himself before the Lord but he had to pray for these guys that had been tormenting him look at the Spirit of Chris Christianity way back in job look at the nature of God he says now job now you pray for these ones that have been tormenting you wow and God wasn't going to bless job wasn't going to restore it until he did that Jesus said in Matthew 5:44 been going through The Sermon on the Mount this was Jesus was preaching this he said but I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you look at the spirit of God way back brother Aaron way back God's nature doesn't change so then God restored everything that was taken from job he receives twice of what he had before all this Calamity started except he received the same amount of children verse 11 Then There came unto him all his Brethren and all his sisters and all they that had been of his acquaintance before and did eat bread with him in his house and they bemoaned him and comforted him comforted him over all the evil that the Lord had brought upon him every man also gave him a piece of money and everyone an earring of gold and the Lord blessed the latter end of job more than his beginning for he had 14,000 sheep and 6,000 camels and a thousand Yol of oxen and a thousand she asses and he also had seven sons and three daughters and he called the name of the first jamaa in the name of the second Kizia and the third Karen hap and in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of job and their father father gave them inheritance among their Brethren after this lived job 140 years and saw his sons and his sons Sons even four generations so job died being old and full of days what a book what an amazing story this man job had he went through some many things that none of us will ever go through but it's it's a it's an account of someone that had been so destitute and had so many problems and God himself was the one that said go ahead and do it very odd it happened but then job stuck with it job saw the resurrection job saw salvation job saw all of these things without a Bible I love that he looked out and saw nature and saw that there was a God and then God spoke directly to him he got to hear his voice the musicians can come and we'll close what a great and powerful man this man job was I think my favorite part in there is when job at the very end he had to pray for those people that hated him so much he had to show the spirit of Christ in job he had to show this before God could return those those blessings to him and then we see the nature of Satan in there how Satan's always worried about his own skin we see that come forward and job did didn't bow to it did job have weaknesses yes did job make mistakes yes was job perfect yes he was God looked down upon this man and saw a perfect servant even with all of his problems let's all stand so glad I I'm Yours Lord so glad I'm yours so glad your mercy has followed me so glad you found me and set me free so glad I'm Yours
