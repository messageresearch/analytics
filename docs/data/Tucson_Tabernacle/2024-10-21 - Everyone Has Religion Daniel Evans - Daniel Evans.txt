thank you for all that have come out this morning we ask your blessings upon all of us that are here and upon those who couldn't come that are coming in via the technology we have through the internet father bless them also in Jesus name amen amen before you're seated let's turn to Romans the first chapter in the 20th [Music] verse the Apostle Paul the author of the book of Romans he says this for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and godhead so that they are without excuse because that when they knew God they glorified him not as God neither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations and then their foolish heart was darkened professing themselves to be wise they became fools and changed the glory of the uncorruptible god into an image made like corruptible man and birds and four-footed beasts and creeping things wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lust of their own heart to dishonor their own bodies between themselves who changed the truth of God into a lie and worshiped and served the creature more than the Creator who is blessed forever amen God bless you you can be seated first greetings to our visitors God bless you all Juan welcome it's your first time here God bless you my friends it's good to have you um I'd like to meet you after service so don't take off too fast um it's good it's good to have you it's good to have all the visors visitors I see uh maybe a few faces that aren't too familiar God bless you yeah who is this nephew Nathan and Stephanie I have a Nathan I have a wife named Stephanie too God bless you welcome it's good it's good to have you welcome to our visitors God bless you all we have a sister back there a soldier of of the Cross sister meline Gara lost her husband this past week God bless you sister meline thank you for coming it's good to have you been in this church for a long time um it's it's uh as I said it's good to have the have the visitors it's um we had uh I wanted to mention to the church uh with the help of Brother John sister an we uh set up a uh a monitor upstairs in the upper room and uh we set up some a sound system in that and we we watched we did a like a trial run a preliminary run in watching starting on the chosen series is everybody here here familiar with the chosen series if you are raise your hand you know what it is wow that is absolutely outstanding I I know that back way back in the 1950s when the um Ten Commandments came out and benur came out it really stirred up the the the um the country and and really got people thinking about the Lord and I think that this chosen series is doing the same thing and I'll tell you what we watched that first episode and it is great the the way that they put it together and and you you can't just the scriptures are very plain but there most things are not written in the scriptures and we but this show has the ability to really put you into that situation and relate with each character and it starts out with Mary Magdalene um and what she was going through we know from the scriptures that that Seven Devils were cast out of her and and that that she had all these problems and it it starts with her and wow what a incredible just show that really C you in there and and what I want to do is I want I want the youth to get together and I want to play the first one over again and I want to get together this weekend um and you tell Daniel my son if Friday or Saturday is better for you and if you can come Juan you got to come my son is the one playing base here the guy that needs a haircut that's that's my boy so so talk to my son D his name is Daniel um and and I want you you're welcome to come I want all of all the young people to come it it's really it's a blessing and I'm really excited about it and this is more of an Evangelistic show it really like I said it puts you into the Bible so with you kids invite your friends this is something and and I've seen testimonies all kinds of testimonies about this is something that people can give their heart to the Lord Jesus by just watching this show and brothers and sisters I don't care how you give your heart to the Lord Jesus I don't care if you come to this church I don't care if I baptize you up there I don't care if you find the the Lord in a Baptist Church or or in a any other church or if you find it watching a a show like the chosen as long as you give your heart to him that is the most important thing and I believe that this show is something that will be a blessing I I'm excited about it so let's um as I said talk to my son I'm going to pull on brother John sister an again to get you to go uh we had the nicest conversation afterwards too it just it brought a spirit that that encouraged us to talk about God and it was just as you can tell I I was blessed by being there and um I want other people to partake in that blessing and we got to figure out some way I don't want to just limit it to the kids because it is it's something that I think that all of us would would benefit from um we have I believe I wouldn't be a good pastor and especially a pastor if I didn't mention the upcoming election that we're having the national election it's um it's something that there's there's a lot at stake as as there is with every presidential election and the the the two sides seem to have diver more and more over the past couple decades to where you you almost can't they're completely completely separate even when they vote on something you have one party votes this way and the other party votes this way and they just hope that they have a couple defectors going back and forth It's not what this country was founded on it's not it's not it's it's not the best for the country but we do have um an election coming up and many people people most of the Believers actually I'd say most of the Believers that I know they say that that politics are all evil and and they don't vote and and I understand that and I've even heard people say that they don't vote because they don't want to be responsible for who is elected well I I I understand that also but I also want to point out that if you don't make a stand in your life whether it be voting as an American whether it be voting in this church whe what whatever it is if you don't make a stand then the stand that you are actually making is in support of whoever wins by simple math so if you don't vote then you're supporting whoever wins so I just want to point that out to the church I'm not telling you how to vote or or or or really how to who to support but it is important and it's going to affect all of us and whether and if it's going to affect me I want to have a say in it number one I want to have a say on my knees in prayer the bi the Bible teaches us that we should pray for our leaders and whether our leader is somebody that you can't stand their policies or someone that you like we are commanded to pray for for our leaders so we need to do that also that's the most important thing and then we need to V vote Voice our legal rights as as a people um and it's starting to really kind of heat up all of this rhetoric going around I um as uh many of you know I have an office on campus at the University of Arizona and I had to walk across campus the other day so I I go walking and uh it was just there was a funny feeling around it was a it's kind of a got a weird kind of weird vibe as I was walking around and and I started seeing a lot of t-shirts with writing on them political statements on both sides so I thought well this is this is kind of strange so keep walking and I get to uh this one a area and there is there are all these people all these students and they're just buzzing and there's Maga hats on and and there's uh keep your laws off my body t-shirts and there's all these different things and I'm I'm thinking this is weird what's what's going on so as I'm making my way and I have to get through here and it starts getting more and more crowded uh and as I'm going I there's this young man man he's standing on a bench and he's got the little uh the little green Gideon Bible and he's standing up and he's reading it out loud and I thought oh that's you know that's cool that's good and and then uh you know I kind of listen to what he was saying and then I see there's another kid um maybe a few feet from him and he's sitting down and he's reading and he's probably reading along with what the young man was saying when he was standing on the bench and then as I'm walking I get I get over here and I see all these real madeup like sorority and fraternity um students and they're man they're all they're all made up like they are and and um they got there this one girl had this gold Maga hat on with all these sink ones on it and stuff like that and and I'm looking and I'm thinking okay they they really are strong and they have their their petitions and and they're out there and they're they're they're saying their thing and and then as I'm walking and I see over here and I see these other ones and they have their keep your laws off of my body um t-shirts and uh and uh and and what was the other one that uh it said um reproductive Justice and uh social justice and there was there's all these different different people and everybody's voicing their their their their their concerns and as I get closer I see these big there's this there was this um these Shades and there's this big awning and there's this name on there and it says Charlie Kirk do you know you guys know does anybody know who that is yeah he's this young man that debates on college campuses so he was going to be there I thought I remember seeing him on YouTube but I didn't have time to stop I was I was busy um plus I didn't want to get in the middle of all this weirdness so I'm I'm I'm I'm going along and and as I'm looking at these people the thought came to my mind that this is their religion whatever they were they were voicing their concerns for one side the conservative side the Republican side the Democrat side whatever it was everybody had something to say everyone had passion and it was all they were wired in a way that that this is what they wanted to promote and I thought this is religion this is this has replaced salvation through Jesus Christ whether it be Republican or Democrat and now they're just trying to get their way and as I was going through I I came back and and just didn't like it and and and I'm coming back and I see the the um as I get to uh the area on U mall I see that they say um that the the abortion rights places were there and it said reproductive Freedom reproductive freedom is a fundamental right of all human beings and it's in the book of Genesis God commanded Adam and Eve multiply and replenish the Earth but what they have done is they have taken those words and they have changed them to mean the opposite of what they were and you can have an an oppressive regime like in China or whatever reproductive Freedom would mean that the government is preventing you from having children you're not allowed to have children but they turn it around and make it to where now reproductive freedom is the ability to destroy the children and the ability to not have a family that that's what the enemy does he takes the human the the English language or whatever language it is and he twists it to make it sound to make it provide his own his own um purposes and and then you see as as I was going I seeing the signs keep your laws off of my body that's really good for your um cause right there but what about when Co hit and they forced you if you're going to have a job you have to have a vaccine what happened to keep your laws off my body it's hypocrisy it's hypocrisy that people want to have their own ways and and all of this and both sides all of it it downplays the teaching of Christian values and it promotes different social issues and you know it's like these political rallies there's this all of this energy and all this was going on around and I thought why where is that energy for the Lord Jesus Christ really thank the Lord for the guy that was up there reading his his Gideon's Bible but I don't know how sincere he was I don't know if he was just trying to make a stand or if he was really concerned about all of those people because every one of those people thousands of them everyone had a soul and everyone was worthy of our time everyone was worthy of our prayers no matter if they they hate us no matter if you completely disagree with what they with what they think they're still worthy to reach out to them there's a scripture in Daniel that talks about the Prince of Persia and how that that Gabriel was commissioned he was sent out from God to come to Daniel and he tells Daniel when he gets there was some 21 days later he says Daniel he says as soon as you started praying and set your mind to have this understanding he said God sent me but I was hindered 21 days Days by this Prince of Persia and the angel and the Prince Michael had to he come and he came and helped me and if these things these spiritual battles were going on in the Book of Daniel then they are most certainly going on today and you you look at there's around the Throne of God I believe it's Revelation chapter early chapter five or somewhere around there it talks about a 100 million angels that surround the Throne of God and if there are all of those angels that that are are are surrounding singing praises to God those angels are influencing us also so if there's all of those angels then there must be millions of demons also and those those demons are also influencing people to get their own way right and we see this influence on both sides and what matters is the way that we make our decisions if we are going to serve God and truly seek God or ultimately it is Satan's way it is his desire it is his nature to serve himself are we going to serve ourselves or are we going to serve God and the way that we serve God is we deny ourselves and accept him so there is all of this conflict going on and and people really they they don't care about the truth what they care about is getting their way and and I'm going to talk a little bit more about politics you did you see the 60 Minutes Scandal that's going on right now where they interviewed kamla Harris the the next the the potential president pres that's running they interviewed her and they changed her answers they they they took a clip from later on in the program and they moved it forward to answer another question just to make her seem more co coherent and more able to be the president they didn't care if it was true they didn't they they didn't care if she's capable what they care about is getting their way it's a mess it's it's a terrible thing and this is our news media this is who is reporting out to us this is who is giving us news and blatantly right out there cutting and splicing to make a candidate seem more palatable for the people and what I want to tell the church is we always think that we're living in the end time and I believe we are but the King Solomon who's considered one of the wisest men that's ever lived he made this statement he said there's nothing new Under the Sun these things that are going on today have always gone on I've read the scripture a number of times saying that the things that you are suffering whether it be sickness whether it be oppression whatever it is you're not the only one that has ever suffered these things you're not the only one that has ever had marital problems you're not the only one that has ever had drug problems you're not the only one that has ever gotten sick this has happened all throughout history and it just repeats itself Matthew chapter 21 I want to read this I want to my my subject is going to be in the Book of Romans that everyone has religion but I want to show you the spirit behind much of these politics that we see today and really it's behind much of what is said in the church is it's behind what's said everywhere if you go to Matthew chap 21:23 this is the Lord Jesus and he's in the temple and these are probably the Sadducees that are talking with him and trying to catch him on certain problems or or certain things and trying to lessen his influence Matthew chapter 21:23 listen to this this is a by the way before we get there this is a very very important scripture this a very important story and it's a story that I believe we can not only relate to what we are seeing in our elections not only in what we see at work but we can bring it all the way down to our relationships with our own spouse with our own children with their own friends Matthew chapter 21:23 says this speaking of Jesus and when he was com into the temple the chief priests and the Elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching and said by what Authority doest thou these things and who gave thee this Authority so what they're saying is how are you casting out these Devils how are you healing these sick how are you doing all of this and Jesus answered and said unto them I also will ask you one thing which if you tell me I and likewise will tell you by what Authority I do these things so he's saying if you answer my question then I will answer your question the baptism of John speaking of John John the Baptist the baptism of John whence was it from heaven or from men so did this come from God or was this a carnal flawed thing and they reasoned with themselves saying if we shall shall say from Heaven he will say unto us why did ye not then believe him but if we shall say of Men We Fear the people for all whole John as a prophet so their religion was the sadducee religion and they they had it had never entered their mind to really seek God for the answers about this this Rabbi named Jes Jesus all they could think about was their agenda their philosophy their political views and their opinions that's all that they could think about right here and it didn't cross their mind Lord am I right to me the stories in the Bible especially this one should always be kept in the back of our minds when you take a position on anything whether it's religious position or a political position or a position on something in the church or something in your family you are taking this position are you taking this position because of your own opinion because of your own desires or are you taking this position because it's God's position so there these Pharisees and these Sadducees are coming to Jesus Jesus asks them a question says I'll answer you very important I will answer you if you will answer me the baptism of John of God or of men I just thought of this and I think I'm going to read two quotes really quick and I'm sorry brother Jeremy I didn't give you these quotes but uh I just when I was back there listen to this this is from time of decision a sermon called time of decision in the late 1950s you see God don't make all of our decisions and there's many times that God doesn't tell His prophets just what to do because they have to make the decision if there is no decision that we have to make just wait every move on God there is no over overcoming on our part and sometimes speaking of the prophets and sometimes they make the wrong decisions God's anointed prophets makes the wrong decisions and many times are deceived end quote from time of decision 1959 0611 next quote this is from 1955 June 7th a True Vine and a false Vine look at this Elijah sitting there and here come the shunamite woman women and fell down by him like that and said God's troubled her heart and kept it from me they don't know all things they just know what God will let them know they're not infallible people the Bible said Elijah was a man subject to like passions as we are his ups and downs and differences I just threw those in there as I was in the back and I was I I was I was going over my sermon and I was I was thinking on things these two quotes came to my mind and I looked them up and put them in my my notes because I wanted to ask the question to the people here and to the people that will listen to this and probably criticize how do you answer are they infallible or not if you go back and you say well if I answer that are fallible and they make mistakes then everything that I have taught and everything that I believe my whole life that I have to throw that out but if I answer that they are infallible then they'll ask them why is that not true I don't have an answer and then God then Jesus will say and neither will I answer you when you ask me things if you are not able to answer that if you are not able to set aside your differences then neither will I answer this verse number 27 and they answered Jesus and said we cannot tell and he said unto them neither tell I you by what Authority I do these things so that we so when we have that attitude towards the scriptures or anything else towards any subject then it's about our way and our way of thinking and our opinion then if we if we if if we try to answer according to our doctrines then and we can't answer then Jesus will say neither will I answer you when you pray to me it's written in the Bible this is Jesus Christ talking this is God in flesh and they asked him he asked them is John this Prophet is John's baptism from God or from men they said well if if we say it's from God then they know that we were against John and then if we say that it's from men then they believe God's a prophet oh we can't answer then Jesus says and neither will I answer you what a statement neither will I answer you imagine if we have that attitude and he won't answer us because of our opinions and our wanting to get our way you know the we look at the Old Testament and we think that the Old Testament is this harsh corrective thing that that is very unforgiving and legalistic in its Commandments and then we go to the New Testament and we see people like Paul and he says I'm free to do all things and so are you and we think that that maybe the rains loosened a little bit from God from when Jesus came from the Old Testament to when Jesus came and the answer is no what happened with the New Testament is we have less freedom than we did in the Old Testament because there are certain things in the Old Testament that that aren't taught about like social media like like many things but we are more bound Now by Christ by by the word than we were were in the Old Testament because the holy spirit is now answering every single question and directing Us in every single thing so now we are more responsible than we were in the Old Testament and God's Commandments are now infinitely more than they were in the Old Testament because he is constantly correcting us and constantly telling us and before they just had to look it up well Moses said here that you had to trim your beard this certain way Moses said over here that no you have to if you want a divorce you have to write her a letter and then and then get it notorized and then let her take it out and then then you can divorce but then when Jesus came he says no everything in your life I require a complete surrender and he said now you I have taken up this cross I have given my heart my life fully to God from the from from my whole life I have given my life fully to God now you you take up your cross and follow me you do as I did so this new testament there is far less freedom than the Old Testament Paul said I am a prisoner for Christ in all things I am a prisoner so brothers and sisters when we're making these decisions when we're thinking about things whether it be religious things on on how we believe and the doctrines that we have are you just trying to further your Doctrine like the guys in the booth at the University are you just trying to further that or do you really seek God lord what is right I would like to know am I going to take these quotes that the brother read am I going to be offended at them up to me I'm not telling you how to believe I'm not telling you to believe whether they're infall prophets are infallible or not infallible that's that's between you and God you're not going to hear me preach that kind of stuff I've heard both sides preach it and it's nonsense all it does is Just Cause division my point as a minister of the Gospel is to present it to you as Jesus did and said now what do you say let's go to Romans chapter one before I get too far I want to get to my subject here uh let's start with uh let's start with verse 15 keep this in mind mind these politics that are going on right now and and what I talked about about about the abortion issue and and about all the social justice and and all of these things keep those things in mind and as I was praying about this this is really a testimony a couple days ago I was like Lord I'd really like to tell that story and there's a poster that um I uh we'll show up here in a minute and I I really want to Minister on that but I can't find I don't know anywhere in the Bible that it says these that everyone has that everyone has religion and and we all are religious and really I believe the Lord directed me to Romans chapter 1 and you'll see how these questions are answered here let's start with verse 15 so as much this is the Apostle Paul speaking so as much much as in me I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are in Rome also thus we have the book of Romans so it's it's it's sent to the people in Rome for I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth to the Jew first and also to the Greek for therein is the righteousness of God revealed from Faith to Faith and it is written the just shall live by faith for the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness now that who hold the truth in unrighteousness that's difficult to understand in in the old language what that means is it doesn't mean that they're holding fast to the truth it means that they are um holding it back they're suppressing the truth remember the priests in the temple who wouldn't answer Jesus because John the Baptist didn't match their religion and remember 60 minutes because K Harris couldn't give a coherent answer they're holding back the truth because it doesn't match the way that they think it's everywhere it's it's believe me this is this is all over the place the spirit verse number 19 because that which may be known of God is manifested in them for God hath showed it unto them for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and godhead so that they are without EXC excuse so that's a very strange statement it says that the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen so how can you see something that's invisible the Apostle here is saying that he's saying that the the invisible God is clear for us all to see how as I was reading that I said how how can how can that be people and it doesn't matter if you're a Christian it doesn't matter if you're an atheist doesn't matter if you're agnostic Hindu or whatever you are it says here that God is plain to see for everyone and if you if you think about it look up at the stars you don't have to know your Bible to see that there is something greater than us that created that now you can be the scientist and say oh no it all came from from from uh this or that the big bangang Theory or whatever it is okay you can say that but you're still you are still responsible because God set that in order I was I was um yesterday I was raking my yard and I looked and there was this ant hill with those those big black ants and and I was like raking and I thought wow that's that's kind of cool and I see that this train of ants went way over to the side of my yard and there's these little ants and they're carrying flower petals and they're cruising along and I was like wow look at these guys and and like every 10th one they all had something and they're carrying them and they're going into the into the thing and and the they Dro their stuff off and they'd come out and and I'm I'm looking at this thinking well wow that's that's that's neat and so I rake a little bit on the antill and they freak out man they start going everywhere and out of this antill comes all of these other black ants and I was like whoa you know chill out guys and they come out and they are ready to do battle so you see that that these ants are carrying in the food and then when something shakes a little bit here comes all the soldiers and they draw their sword and it whether it's a horny toad or a lizard or whatever it is they're going to take him out so they're all working in Perfect Harmony these ants remember Job in the Bible he didn't have a bible to read there was no Bible in job's time Moses was way after him that wrote Genesis so here's job and he sees this tree and he says wow that tree was dead and now it's alive God what about me if I die can I live again job looked around and he saw the Great Jehovah God even without a Bible and this scripture is saying listen you are guilty because not only did I give you a Bible not only did I give you a minister not only did I give you a kid standing up on his bench reading the Bible out loud but I also gave you the stars and the moon and I gave you ants and I gave you trees I gave you all these things for my own Glory so that you will be you will not be Guiltless on that day you can see God Proverbs it says go to the ant consider the ant thou Slugger consider her ways and be wise which having no guide no overseer no ruler she provides food in the summer and gathers food her food in the Harvest there's no king ant I think there's a queen but I don't know if they exactly give orders they don't but but they all know their job and they're all doing their job so do they have little radios saying Josiah go get this and that and and no they just do it and you look at God's Ministry and he gave some Apostles and these Apostles aren't under any type of Direction they are under the direction of the Holy Spirit just like the ant is and they're going out and they are setting Church is in order and he gave some prophets that come and they they prophesy and they warn the people of impending judgment evangelists they get the people stirred up all working under the same Holy Spirit pastors they oversee the congregation they're always taking care of them and looking out for him and worried about him and then the teachers come in and they're expounding upon the word and talking about talking about here's what this scripture means here's what it means to day all working perfect let me tell you these ants they are led by the Holy Spirit to do what they're doing the one carrying the flow pedal he was under the anointing of the Holy Ghost the soldiers that came out when I R their home operating under the same holy spirit that I'm operating under the same holy spirit that you are operating under an ant in the ground and that's what this scripture is saying for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen you can look at an anill as Solomon said being understood by the things that are made these things that God created the heavens and the Earth even his eternal power and godhead so that they are without excuse because that when they knew God they glorified him not as God neither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened English Standard Version says for although they knew God they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him but they became feudal in their thinking and their foolish Hearts were darkened professing themselves to be wise they became fools what a statement professing them elves to be to be wise they saying that we are wise we are smart we are educated and they became fools as I was walking around there and I see all this weirdness going on on campus this is education this is what our children are being filled with is all of this nonsense I don't I'll just say it the most foolish people in this world are often the most educated why is that because they think they're better and they want to do dominate or denominate both the little guy we know better for you you little simple guy we know better so you just vote for us you just do what we say and then we'll take care of you and look who promotes the worship of animals and the environment and the all of the the the cre look who promotes that it's the most educated and change the glory verse number 23 I'll get to that one just a second it's a weird picture I'll get to it I'll explain what it is it's odd um and you talking about weird I mean these people they ignore God and they start worshiping they start worshiping the environment and and and worshiping the the cows and worshiping the the plants and worshiping the environment and and worshiping the the used to be the ozone layer and now it's global warming and all this I'm not saying it's wrong most of you know I've devoted my professional life to studying the environment so anyways verse number 23 and changed the glory of the uncorruptible god into an image made like to corruptible men so they changed this Jehovah Yahweh Elohim this great self-existing one they changed God into something that was corruptible into an image made like corruptible men and to birds and four-footed beasts and creeping things let me tell you we look back in the Old Testament and we see look at all this idolatry where did all this idolatry come from let me tell you there is more idolatry here in the United States than there is throughout the whole Bible it is everywhere and I'm going to show you where it is now you can put up the creepy picture so as I was coming back from my journey across campus this was was taped to my office wall veganism is a moral urgency as I said everyone has religion this is these people's religion you have a half calf and a half dog and they're saying don't eat these things I've eaten both of them by the way yesterday I had a tostada a shredded beef tostada from pho's Taco Shop it was great it was made from dead cow and when I was in Indonesia I ate a dead dog it wasn't so good it wasn't as good as the as the dead cow I'd recommend the cow over the dog but but they're saying here they're putting here and they're saying basically if you won't eat the dog why are you eating the cow and it says veganism is a moral urgency as I said it's a flyer outside my office okay you take down the creepy picture um so then what do I do I go to the website looks like it's sponsored by the University of Arizona there and it says this on the website it says there are three pillars in our movement this is the um Allied Scholars for animal protection we have three pillars Outreach which is this we ensure strong and conspicuous Outreach presence on campuses and continuously find and Inspire vegan students or to help students go vegan get active and pursue impactful careers one of their pillars the next one community and education and empowerment we build supportive Community for vegans and provide educational seminars and the third one is accessibility we support campaigns to transition dining Halls towards plant-based eating to make plant-based food more acceptable if you're a vegetarian I don't care I'm not saying that it's wrong to not eat meat what they're doing is do you see do you feel the religious undertones in this we are going to take these areas and we are going to separate them that you have a place to worship that you have a place you you have accessible we would say accessible to the word of God and they're saying accessible to plant-based food Outreach I mean we're all we're all about a Christian the whole thing one of the M foundations one of our pillars is to go out and preach the gospel tell everybody about Jesus Christ that that's their first one is Outreach we need to get our message out listen to these testimonies says this one of the testimonies on the website veganism finally allowed me to align my actions with my values and it's the best decision I've ever made in my life life my only regret not doing it sooner an un unexpected side effect of plant-based diet it's also protecting the environment and reduces human suffering things I've always cared about and that's the founder and CEO of this this movement another person says as a PhD ma as a PhD student in math at Harvard I was introduced to ASAP this is the acronym for this um this movement during Dr harini whose I just read Dr hen's Le lecture at Harvard in MIT ASAP has been a tremendous source of motivation for animal activisms in Boston including myself though they're organized and and effective animal advocacy which includes a range of Outreach and educational events I am thrilled to be part of creating a positive change at Harvard is this not religion these testimonies it's it's a perversion of the real thing how many people can say I'm so glad I started going to church because I gave my heart to the Lord and I got rid of the drugs and I got rid of the alcohol and they're saying I got rid of meat what a mess what an impersonation of Christianity there's for time's sake I won't go through these other ones let me read this this one another testimony meeting meeting for us during animal activism in New York City was a remarkable moment that changed the course of my life through through our connection fra recognized and appreciated my Outreach skills and he extended an opportunity for me to join the join the ministry no join the team at ASAP it fills my heart with joy to know that my position and abilities are valued and that I have the privilege of working alongside like-minded individuals who share deep commitments to animal Liberation what what about the liberation of a soul what about the liberation of a soul from the shackles of the devil that is what we should be looking at and not this nonsense but it's religion and every group like this guy here they all have their leader they all have the one that they look to it might be Oprah Winfrey it might be Donald Trump it might be Barack Obama Obama it might be Joseph Smith whoever it might be they've got their leaders I want to tell a a story really quick as um when I was in the ministry in Jeffersonville I got a call from an English an a man from England and he was a he was a reporter and he said you know they talk funny anyways so he says he said that I just want to know he says does your min teach that people should eat monkeys and I was like I don't understand the question and he says does your religion teach that people should eat monkeys and I was like I don't know I said and I told the story about Peter I went in this big long story about how Peter prayed and and and God said no you can eat anything and he said not anything unclean the guy could care less what I what what I was saying because that wasn't his point point he says specifically apes and I said man I'm sorry I just don't know what you're talking about and he says here's the deal he said you all your ministry is spreading like wildfire through the Congo through the pygmies and through the through the natives and through back in the jungles and he said what's happening is these people they had an animous religion where they worship the animals as their ancestors and he says when they accept your message and when they give their hearts they didn't say Jesus Christ but he says when they're baptized when they give and I say this when they give their hearts to Jesus Christ they stop fearing and worshiping the animals the monkeys and they start eating them and I was like well yeah they're not afraid of them anymore I said they have to follow the laws of the Bible very plainly teaches us to follow the laws and he says well then you need to tell them to stop so what this man is doing he did not like that the fact that they were these heathens were giving their hearts to Jesus Christ having an experience getting saved filled with the Holy Ghost he was like no no no go back because they're eating monkeys that was what was important to him was his religion which had nothing to do with God wherefore verse 24 wherefore God G also gave them up to uncleanness through the lust of their own Hearts to dishonor their own bodies between themselves look what this produces this worshiping of animals and and worshiping of liberal ideologies and and these and and worshiping of the environment Watch what it produces and then you will be able to see it plainly now wherever you go who changed the truth of God into a lie and worshiped and served the creature the creation more than the Creator notice it doesn't say rather than it just says more than more than the Creator who changed I'll read it again who changed the truth of God into a lie and worshiped and served the creation the creature more than the Creator who is blessed forever now watch what Paul says he says you're they serve the the creation more than the Creator and he says God is blessed forever and then he says amen it's the only time he says it in this he must have been getting going on writing this letter and he's like yeah Amen to that now watch what happens when they start going off into this idolatry and as I said brothers and sisters we are surrounded by idolatry we don't see it because they don't have a a little Idol sitting maybe on their desk or or in their car well they're everywhere but they're worshiping the creation more than the Creator for this cause watch what follows now for this Goda cause God gave them up into vile affections NIV says shameful lusts for this cause God gave them up into vile affections for even their women did change the natural use of that which is against nature and likewise also so these women did something perverted and likewise also the men leaving the natural use of the woman burned in their own lust one towards another and if you didn't understand that he makes it very plain here men with men working that which is unseemly and receiving in themselves that recompense of the error which was met so when you allow Satan in when you put God aside you can look at an antill you can look at a tree you can look at a mountain and you can see that there is a Jehovah God and if you choose not to see that watch what comes in I even saw I mean it's getting really bad I even saw a young man makeup the long eyelashes full dress brand new dress heels like a girl and a beard I saw it and it's been a couple of them it's getting really strange but if you throw out God you just open the door for any type of perversion to come in which is what we have done as a country and I cannot I can't believe that we are electing people that are for this type of Filth and we are responsible being filled with all unrighteousness and fornication and wickedness and Covetous and and maliciousness full of envy and murder and debate deceit malignity wh Whisperers backbiters haters of God despiteful proud boasters inventors of evil things disobedient to parents disobedient to parents he just mentions that in there he mention all of this perversion and then he says Disobedience to parents gender altering drugs without a parent's permission surgeries gender changing surgeries without parents permission abortions without parents permissions all of this this worship of the creation it brings in all of this nonsense and disobedient to Parents Without understanding Covenant Breakers without natural AFF affection implacable unmerciful in of NIV says they have no understanding no Fidelity no love and no mercy who knowing the Judgment of God that they which commit such things are worthy of death not only do the same but have pleasure in them that do them I assume that the apostle was referring back to the law of Moses and the punishment and he's saying that they know the consequences of doing these things but yet they do them anyways musicians can come my hour is up and uh that's a good place to stop brothers and sisters the reason that I am preaching this is I want you to understand what is surrounding you these things are not new they were here when Paul wrote The Book of Romans exactly the same people worshiping the creation rather than the Creator and then we goes on and on and on and here we are now with an election before us with one group that stands for the weirdness of the poster that I put up here and the the perversion that's in life it's here it's been here here and now it's here again and it's nothing new it was all the way back to the Garden of Eden when God told them not to sin God told them what not to do and then they did it anyways they did not have the respect for God's word then and do we have it now and I ask you brothers and sisters whether it be for something in church whether it be for your personal decisions that you make whatever it is are you taking those Pharisees Sadducees ways when they're trying to figure out is it if we answer this way then this will happen if I answer that way then that will happen or are you truly taking God and saying No this is what I believe the word of God teaches brother lonel that's the most important thing we can do is make a stand and not be a wishy-washy believer like these sades were when they said ah we can't answer then Jesus if we do the same then Jesus will give us the same answer that he gave the Sadducees neither will I answer you when you get on your knees and you need something neither will I answer you because you didn't put me first because you didn't you didn't surrender to me you wanted your way so here's your way it's yours now you live with it or you can repent say Lord I've been wrong in one thing brother the one one right one thing about Jesus is no matter how much you have done wrong no matter your all of your mistakes in the past if you truly come before him and you say Lord I'm sorry I want your will he will always take you back he will always say come unto me come unto me ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest but we have to be able to surrender ourselves to him unlike these Pharisees and unlike these educated elit not against education I have an education but the educated Elite who think that they are better think that they have a better understanding because of their moral superiority let me tell you moral superiority is Jesus Christ follow him and then your life is not your own as the book of Romans says I think it's Romans then you're not your own you give your life to the Lord Brother Josiah on Christ the solid rock I stand all other ground is sinking sand all other ground is sinking sand my hope is built on nothing less than Jesus blood and [Music] righteousness I dare not trust the sweetest frame but holy lean on Jesus name on Christ the solid rock I stand all other ground is sinking sand all other ground is sinking sand when darkness seems to hide his face I rest on his unchanging Grace in every high and stormy Gale my anchor holds within the veil on Christ the soul R in rock I stand all other ground is sinking sand all other ground is sinking sand his oath his Covenant his blood support me in the Welling flood when all around my soul gives way he then is All My Hope and stay on Christ the solid rock I stand all of the grounded sinking sand all other ground is sinking s let's all [Music] stand I couldn't finish but I do want to read a scripture as we close Colossians 3:1 says this if ye then be risen with Christ seek those things which are above where Christ sth on the right hand of God set your affections on things above and not things on the earth for you are dead and your life is hid with Christ Christ in God when Christ who is our life shall appear then shall ye also appear with him in glory that's a promise I'll read it again when Christ if you are dead and your life is hid with Christ and God when Christ who is our life shall appear then shall ye also appear with him in glory mortify Therefore your members which are upon which are upon Earth put to death is what that means put to death therefore that which is Earthly in [Music] you mortify Therefore your members which are upon the Earth fornication uncleanness inordinate affection evil conc concupisent concupisent is covetousness I'm sorry is evil desire and covetousness which is idolatry so he's saying that those things we say where is idolatry he's saying that these things are idolatry for which things say sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience in the which ye also walked sometime I say that's probably me and many of you yeah I have walked in ungodliness I have walked in sin and the Apostle here is saying many of you walked that way too when you lived in them but still we have a promise we have a [Music] promise that when Christ who is our life shall appear then shall you also appear with him in glory it's a good promise brother the Manny it's a good one so brothers and sisters when I believe it was the Apostle John he closed one of his Epistles and he said children keep yourselves from idols and I say the same thing in the name of Jesus Christ keep yourselves from these Idols of the world they will do nothing but cause sin in your lives you can look at a tree you can look at an antill you can look at what whatever you want whatever is in this world and you are responsible for knowing that there is a God you can also open this book and you can see that he's all over it brother Josiah for a long time I've traveled down a long Lonely Road my heart was so heavy in sin i s l then I
