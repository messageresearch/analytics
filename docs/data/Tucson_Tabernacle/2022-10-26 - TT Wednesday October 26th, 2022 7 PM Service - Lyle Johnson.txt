changing hands foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] we've got brother Jeremy could you come on up you got turned in a prayer request from Sister Rebecca Bustamante she said I'd like to put in a prayer request for Tina Miranda she was diagnosed with breast cancer and has gone through chemo treatments right now and is in a lot of pain we've got a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of that infirmity feels our pain he knows it but also our sisters Grace and Lily and Rachel are traveling this evening going to Youth Camp Back East so we want to pray not just for traveling mercies but that the Lord will meet them at this camp and bless them and just refill them with the Holy Ghost and every good thing amen let's stand together if you have a need on your heart here's a there's something of praise to raise our faith this uh brother Josiah McGrady the sister yarbrough's great-grandson there's a testimony that when he was in the womb they thought his brain had some serious complications and they were doctors were very concerned after a number of tests and they thought for the doctors thought for sure that his brain would be malformed and inadequate but he's been born there's been a lot of prayer and they've they've run another MRI now and they said his brain is normal praise the Lord amen that's a miracle in my book thankful for that and also there was a prayer request I saw for a brother a pastor back East whose son was in a motorcycle accident and you know that can be uh the end very easily but I saw an update that he was stable and and I believe the Lord moved on that scene as well so let's just approach the Lord and faith [Music] let's pray gracious Heavenly Father we just our children looking unto you because you're our high priest the Lord we encounter the joy that we can bring in requests [Music] and the things that are hidden in our hearts Lord those things you even see Lord if there's any need amongst this people in this house Lord it would be just to draw closer to you for if we have faith just to touch you all those needs would be supplied before Lord you sustain us with our necessity and Lord you even give us increase for you've made a stewards over little things so that we might decrease and share it with others and and love each other that's what you gave us our increases for and yet learn there's still Souls out there that need to be saved we just counting the honor to be engraved on your hands and Lord we we have these requests and I don't remember any of them but I'm glad they were spoken out for they were a request still and we know you undertake for every every Everything the rain falls and Lord we're all excited [Music] so water us tonight with your word water our spirits Lord let us go out of here and and be salty to the world that doesn't know you bless brother Lyle as he prepares us Peter and Martha at the piano Lord I'll come in together to just see a glimpse of you Lord Granite that's all I pray help us in every way and your precious name the Lord Jesus Christ amen and as our brother Lyle comes that sing Lord I believe and that's mean it oh Lord I believe that the Lord I believe that all things [Music] foreign [Music] is that your confession tonight I'm always between the keys between hello between the gaps so better that I don't try and sing but I just you know the last last week or so the last couple of weeks I've just been not exactly struggling but just not sure Lord what do you want said what what do you want me to to to say what do you want me to draw from your word for your people what do you have for us and I think oh it's this and I'd be working on that and and then I run into the wall well and then I feel like there's another kind of inspiration and I run into a different world and I was just kind of thrashing around a little bit Sunday night I thought Lord thank you I know where I'm going with this now thank you Lord Monday morning it was a different direction so I think probably you know it wasn't that long ago that that if brother Aaron didn't give me at least seven days notice I was just shaking trying to get ready and prepared but now God's grace I'm past that by his grace so I've got a lot less time to prepare but it maybe makes me more dependent on him and that's where we all need to be I think is with the mind of Christ and dependent on him so let's look to the Lord once more before we open his word and see what he has for us Lord Jesus we're here Lord not because we are anyone Lord we're nobody and you are not just somebody but you are everything Lord we pray that you would just help us to be yielded to you Lord that you'd help thee Lord this evening to just not be here Lord not not Lord to just get past Lyle Johnson's thoughts on Lyle Johnson's opinions Lord to just be you speaking to us speaking through US Lord anointing us Lord for your people for each one that's here Lord forgive us Lord of sin sin in my life Lord where I fall short so many times Lord but Lord just help us to draw together as a body of Christ to draw from you Lord because you have something for us and we want to receive it and we thank you in Jesus precious name amen last Sunday brother Aaron spoke on the reality of our being God's workmanship reopened with Ephesians 2 10. if you have a Scofield bible and you look in the notes at the beginning of it he'll he'll indicate something along the lines of Ephesians parallels Joshua brother Branham picked up on this and talked a lot about it in the adoption Series in 1960. just as Joshua describes the efforts of the people delivered from bondage to conquer Canaan and reap its benefits as the promised land Ephesians tells of our struggle to conquer our flesh and possess the promise of the holy spirit in our lives and we know it's by Grace not law yet we must strive we must work to bring it about in our lives tonight I'd like to take a brief look at some portions of the books of Ephesians so we'll open with Ephesians 1 and read just a little bit before we're seated Ephesians 1 1. Paul an apostle one who sent and is a representative of Jesus Christ by the will of God not by his own choice he's the messenger of the Gospel the good news to the Gentiles at the very beginning of the foundations of Christian faith to the Saints Sanctified ones those set aside by God which are at Ephesus hmm anybody here at Ephesus that not me I'm in Tucson and to the faithful in Christ Jesus is that you is that me yes so it's to us Paul's writing this to us God is sending us a text and it's only taken 1950 years for it to make its way through the web and get here Tucson Arizona Grace he says God's favor not earned unmerited a gift be to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ the kind of inner peace the shalom that only God can provide please be seated let me start by giving you a little context for Ephesians and and for Ephesus I apologize that this map was a little busy for those of you sitting in the back maybe you brought your opera glasses or your binoculars or I I don't know I think we're all sufficiently socially distancing that if anybody had Ebola nobody would catch it but there's a red arrow here big one that points to Ephesus which is right here this whole block here has all these names galatia cappadocious Alicia Asia Etc that's modern day Turkey to give you some context this black see if you go right up here that's Ukraine where there's a lot of bad things happening right now over here is Italy Rome Adriatic see if you go up just about here that's where Amos and Abigail Garcia were celebrating their anniversary just a little while ago to give you some context of where this is of course Israel is here and these all these colored lines are showing where Paul went but you can see that he went to Ephesus by the way the Isle of Patmos is not really visible here but it's right here just off the coast of Ephesus it's kind of the Ephesus is the next big town if you can swim far enough from Patmos so I don't know exactly how far it is 20 30 miles 40 maybe Paul visited Ephesus on his second and third missionary Journeys Acts 20 31 tells us that he was like the pastor or the bishop or whatever an Ephesus for about three years so these weren't quick in and out missionary Journeys Paul would go someplace and oftentimes he'd hang around iranius indicates third-hand knowledge that iranius heard that somebody heard that somebody told him that the Apostle John after his exiled Atmos was the bishop at Ephesus for the last several years of his life the book of Acts chapter 18 tells us that on his second missionary journey Paul start briefly in Ephesus on his way back to Antioch he brought Akila in Priscilla with them from from Greece there and left them in Ephesus as he went uh he went home Apollos then came had a powerful Ministry but he was lacking a little bit there in a girl and Priscilla just happened to be there and we're told that they expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly well Apollos departed in a little bit later Paul arrived on his third missionary journey Acts 19 tells us he was there for more than two years and as we just read he was or I cited the reference he was there for three he stayed on and sometime after that two years that are mentioned in Exodus 19 just that it was for a season there was a major problem that arose at Ephesus we read in Acts 19 23 at the same time there arose no small stir it was a major fear it was serious trouble about that way that is the way of the Lord that that Paul was preaching and sharing and testifying and being an apostle of for a certain man named Demetrius a silversmith which made silver shrines for Diana Diana is the Roman name for the Greek goddess Artemis which is variously the goddess of the hunt the goddess of of human childbirth and so forth made silver shrines for Diana and brought no small gain that is to say he brought a lot of business under the Craftsman of Ephesus so this guy apparently was a little bit of a of a leader he was very successful business person there so Demetrius called a meeting of the Craftsman together with the workmen of like occupation related trades and said he got this meeting and he said sirs you know that by this craft we have our wealth our prosperity it depends on it moreover you see and hear that not alone not only at Ephesus but almost throughout all Asia this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people saying that they be no Gods which are made with hands so that not only is this our craft and danger to be said it not but also that the Temple of the Great grottis Goddess Diana should be despised and her magnificence should be destroyed whom all Asia and the world worships this inset that I put in here this map is cut out from that previous one you can see Ephesus there so when they refer to Asia they're not talking about China and Japan and Singapore and all of that they're talking about Western turkey it's the the Roman province and when they those people that were gathered and listening to Demetrius heard these sayings they were full of Wrath anger rage and cried out saying great is Diana of the Ephesians Ephesus was also the seat of worship of the goddess Artemis two names for the same thing Jesus Yeshua two names same person so if we read a few verses more we'd see that there was a riot that ensued but a question may come to your mind are these assertions of Demetrius regard regarding Artemis are they just bombast is he just making a big deal out of nothing is this a tempest in a teapot or is this hyperbole is this exaggeration or were they largely factual have you ever heard of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World I'm not asking you to name them but the great pyramid at Giza Egypt is the only one that remains did you know that one of those seven wonders of the ancient world was the very Temple of Artemis in Ephesus that Demetrius was speaking of when he talks about the magnificence of Diana another Temple he is not exaggerating you can you can see that this this is a model of that Temple that that's in Istanbul Turkey the original one was built in the 6th Century BC it was twice the size of the Parthenon its final version that was constructed in the 4th Century BC was 450 feet long that's one and a half football fields 225 feet wide and 60 feet tall with more than 127 columns and it stood for several hundred years the inset this is all that remains of it today a single composite pillar of fragments of various columns that they found when they started digging Demetrius was right to be worried well there was a riot it was quelled and Paul then left from Macedonia well let's Jump Ahead chapter one of Ephesians let's jump up to verse 15. Paul's greeted people he's talked about some things that we'll get to in a moment and he says wherefore I also after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and love unto all the saints cease not to give thanks for you making mention of you in my prayers is that a little strange they're saying I can hear you you're saying wait a minute brother Lyle why does Paul say he's heard of their faith when he's the one that was involved in their conversion and led the work there for three years what what's going on good question glad you're paying attention some years after the events of Acts 18 and 19 as we know Paul was imprisoned he was sent to Rome it was while he was in Rome that he wrote this epistle this letter to the Ephesians so this was 7 to 15 years after the last time he had physically been there so what's going on here is that Paul's rejoicing that he is hurt they've kept the faith they've grown in Grace and they're known for their love will turn with me now to revelation chapter 2. there's a letter to the church at Ephesus was written another 30 years or so later we're very familiar with this under the angel of the Church of Ephesus right these things saith he that holdeth the Seven Stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks in other words Jesus I Know Thy works and thy labor and thy patience and now you can't bear them with your evil you've tried them that say they are Apostles that say that I sent them but they're not you found them to be liars and you've borne you've carried so much you've had patience and from my very name sake you've labored and you've not fainted they're doing the right things they're doing them in the name of Jesus Christ they're doing the right things nevertheless oops I have somewhat against thee because thou has left thy first love the very thing that Paul is commending their love is the one thing they will eventually leave other translations of this verse say you have lost the love you had at first or you don't love me or each other as you did at first or you have abandoned the love you had at first you deserted me your first love well if we read on in verse 5 of Revelation 2 Jesus goes on to call them to repentance to return to do the works and deeds that they used to do you see it's not just what we do it's why we do it that counts with god brother Branham talks about checking your motive and your objective what's in your heart as you go forth The church here is doing the right things they're doing it for his name's sake but they're no longer motivated by that love my prayer Lord help me to be motivated by love for Christ to do the things you want me to do not out of a sense of Duty but out of love and gratitude in response to your love that saved me and paid the awful price of redemption for me for each of us here tonight with this is a background and context let's go back to Ephesians 1 we'll pick up at verse 3. remember Paul is writing not just to the Ephesians but specifically and directly to us as being among the faithful and Christ Jesus in fact it may surprise you to know that some of the very earliest Greek manuscripts of Paul's letter completely leave out the mention of Ephesus in verse one and they read to the Saints which are the faithful in Christ Jesus as we are included in that number and I believe we are the called out set aside and faithful in Christ tonight I want us each to carefully and intentionally insert ourselves into these verses keep in mind the parallel between the promised land and the possession of the believer through the spirit Ephesians 1 3 Paul has just greeted them blessed praise Lord adoration be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ the Messiah who who God hath what blessed us blessed who who's the letter written to you to me personally individually put your name here as we read it together God has blessed me Lyle Johnson with a few some no with all spiritual blessings and Heavenly places in Christ in other words when I am joined in Christ with Christ all the blessings that exist in the Heavenly Realm am I do you really grasp that I'm not sure I do according as he He Who God hath randomly accepted kept score and noted who had the most Merit no he and his Sovereign will has chosen who us where in him when before the foundation of the world why that we should be what holy and not just holy which is already more than enough and more than we could ever expect but also entirely Without Blame for him in exasperation and resignation no before him in love do you see yourself here blessed be chosen holy Without Blame loved put yourself there this letter is to you having guessed that we might be worthy to by his foreknowledge he is predestinated us that means it's going to happen it's guaranteed he's already seen it he transcends time there's no question unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself full family member not not just a little kid but a mature adult having been proven trustworthy according to the good pleasure of his will remember it's all about him he includes us but it's not about us it's about him to the praise of the glory of his grace we praise him to measure it with the glory of the grace he's freely bestowed upon us wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved in whom the Beloved we have Redemption to be redeemed is to be fought back no longer held as collateral for a debt our sin put us in Satan's pawn shop Jesus Paid the price of Redemption on Calvary for each one of us through his blood and you even begin to imagine how awful that was I shudder at times when I think of it we not only have Redemption which would have been more than enough but he extended to us through that act of self-sacrifice the forgiveness sins sins plural not only our attitude and nature of unbelief of sin but the resulting actions according to the riches of his grace abundant riches matchless Grace wherein he hath abounded abundant there's a lot abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence the NIV translation renders this in him we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins in accordance with the riches of God's grace that he lavished on us with all wisdom and understanding he having made known unto us the mystery of his will he revealed this mystery to us according to his good pleasure his merciful intention which he hath purposed and himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times and Ivy says when the time is right the complete Jewish Bible says when the time is ripe the Amplified says for the maturity of the times and the climax of the ages he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on Earth even in him placing everything under the headship of Christ in whom that is in Christ also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated again this outcome is foreseen and assured according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will it's all about him Revelation we're told we're created for his pleasure not ours that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ the the complete Jewish Bible renders this so that we who earlier had put our hope in the Messiah would bring him praise to measurement with his glory how should our praise be in whom that is in Christ ye you to whom this letter is addressed also what trusted had faith when after that she heard what the word of Truth the Ephesians heard it first through Apollos and Priscilla and akula and Paul how did you hear it how did I hear it and what did we hear that word of Truth The Gospel what is the gospel the good news of your salvation what news could be better than that in whom also after that you believed you were what sealed marked by him that is by Christ with with what the Holy Spirit of Promise the infilling of the Holy Ghost which is the earnest the down payment the guarantee of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchased possession that means you and that means me we're not our home we have been purchased by Christ we are in fact his possession unto the praise of his glory did you get all that um let's review and summarize this list this is what we just read now I'm going to read down this list and I want you to say your own name I'm up here I want to hear you I want you to enter into this I want you to grasp these promises what Paul has written to us in these few verses of Ephesians they're ours we possess them in Christ I am blessed in Christ I am chosen in Christ I am Holy in Christ I am blameless don't get tired of saying your name this was written to you in Christ I am loved in Christ I am predestinated to adoption in Christ I am accepted in Christ I and redeemed in Christ I am forgiven in Christ I am a recipient of his grace in Christ I bring God pleasure in Christ I have an inheritance in Christ I am sealed and the Holy Spirit is given to me as the earnest the guarantee of fulfillment of all aspects of this set of Pro so now we can act any old way do whatever we please just cruise on through life no not exactly I want to encourage each of you carefully prayerfully thoughtfully read the book of Ephesians it's just a few pages in your Bible for now we'll just hit a few more highlights Paul goes on and the rest of that first chapter to emphasize the greatness of God and his gift of life to us and intention to put all things under Christ he starts the second chapter and you who me you each one of us hathy quickened what does that mean brought to life who were dead and trespasses and sins skipping down to verse four but God who is rich in judgment anger Wrath no rich abounding in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins we were his enemies rejecting him disobedient hath quickened us brought us to life together with Christ and Paul emphasizes by grace you're saved and it raised us up together not just together with one another which is wonderful but together in Christ and has made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus we're quickened we're brought to life raised up sitting in the heavenlies in and only in Christ and that through his grace alone that for a few moments no that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches extreme wealth of his what Grace in his kindness his kindness one of his attributes that work you possess and display this will all men know you're my disciples that you have loved one for another is what Jesus said his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus for by Good Works were created to do such but it is by grace are ye who me you each of us are saved through faith and that faith is not of yourselves it didn't come from you it was given to you it says it's a gift of God so the very faith that you have comes from God to accept the grace that he extends from God because we're not worthy of any of it but he gives us all of it it's not of works not what you did blessed in order to prevent that any man should boast and the verse that brother Aaron shared with us on Sundays he started for we are his God's workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto to do to perform good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them live a life full of good works motivated by love as we read in Revelation 2. again we see that our Salvation is all accomplished by him through his love and grace toward us now Paul goes on to describe the revealed Ministry mystery not Ministry sorry in Ephesians 3 Ephesians 3 3 we read how that by Revelation Paul is sharing this now by Revelation Christ is made known unto me Paul the mystery now watch what Paul says about this Revelation at verse 5 he says which in other Ages was not made known Unto the Sons of men it was hidden as it is now revealed unto His Holy Apostles and Prophets by the spirit so Paul was saying that he's a holy Apostle and that he's a prophet because he's talking about the Revelation and he just said this is the ones to whom God reveals such Paul's not being very shy here verse 6. that the Gentiles the non-jewish people should be fellow heirs Sharing The Inheritance with the descendants of Jacob and of the same body and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel the good news Paul's rejoicing in the Revelation that the grace and mercy of God is not limited to the descendants of Israel but it's available to all who will believe and accept it that's truly good news but it's not all sunshine and roses there's danger Ephesians 4. I therefore Paul the prisoner of the Lord beseech you beseech this is a plaintiff cry from the depths of his heart to us that you walk that you live a life worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called a behavior that is a credit to the summons to God's service with all lowliness lowliness of Mind humility and meekness unselfish gentleness mildness meekness is not weakness meekness comes from a position of strength with long suffering patience forbearing bearing with putting up with making allowances for one another and love endeavoring it's hard work we must make every effort striving earnestly with diligence to keep the unity Harmony and Oneness of the spirit in the bond ing ourselves together with peace Paul goes on there's one body not two not five not ten not ten million there's one body one spirit even as you are called in one hope of your calling one Lord one faith one baptism one God and Father of all who is above who was Sovereign Over All and and and and works through all and and pervading and living in you all Christ in you the Holy Spirit the father the the Oneness of God but unto every one of us each of us is given Grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ a different measure not indiscriminately but as each requires in proportion to the generosity of Christ's rich and Bounty is gift Paul goes on and explains and expands on this topic throughout chapter four and he concludes it with a very Stern warning Ephesians 4 30. he says and grieve not don't bring sorrow to the holy spirit of God whereby ye are sealed guaranteed that you will be saved on the day of redemption grief not how do we ensure this how do we ensure that we don't grieve the Holy Spirit well he gives us two short lists the first is a list of the don'ts but just like we heard uh brother Daniel talking about talents and and it's not what you don't do that's what you do do so we've got some don'ts and then we've got some dues so verse 31 he says let get rid of all bitterness Wrath anger clamor that's violent assertedness evil speaking let all this be put away from you along with all malice spitefulness so don't let these be in your life don't let these be in your church don't let these be in your family don't let this be amongst us and now comes an imperative a definite instruction of what to do a command if you will be ye kind one to another tenderhearted compassionate forgiving one another why even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you are we one body this is a general body there is a general Body of Christ comprised of all believers there's also a local body those that Worship in various assemblies including this one here Tucson Tabernacle let me tell you a story two stories the first concerns a man that I knew only by reputation most of you know that I'm a nerd everybody knows that no secret when I was a 13 year old kid I became a licensed to amateur radio operator the last full-time job I had was for a company in California designing and creating high performance equipment for amateur radio communications it's been a kind of a lifelong thing well we had a customer in England who wrote and supported some software that complemented our equipment his name was Julian Moss his amateur radio call sign with G4 ILO if any of you were amateurs in every word G4 I although that was Julian Moss I never met him I'm not even sure I ever corresponded with him well several years ago he started a Blog called one foot in the grave turns out he was diagnosed with an inoperable incurable brain tumor and he wrote in the blog what he experienced is various treatments were done as his body failed him the good days the bad days the regrets the final entry was made by his wife just after Julian passed away it was exactly eight years ago brother Jordan shared with us about the 23rd of October on Sunday well here this fellow passed away on the 24th of October today's the 26th it was eight years ago that this happened well sometimes when when I feel hurt rejection anger I think about that blog one foot in the grave not its contents but it's title one foot in the grave that brings me to my second story maybe it's a testimony maybe it's a confession that's personal many of you already know some of it or all of it but I'm going to share it with you many of you recall that early in November 2016. I left this assembly some of you weren't attending the Tabernacle back then it may be news you after service one Sunday morning I walked out right through that door there sister the one close to you Heather and I were sitting roughly where you're sitting I didn't storm out I wasn't loud but I was direct I didn't look to the right didn't look to the left head down directly to the parking lot to our car drove away Heather came with me not because she wanted to in such a way but she's my wife I was upset I was angry I was hurt and I was hurting please as I relate this do not feel any pangs of sympathy for me I deserve none and you'll see why for about three months we went to different churches I was convinced I was right I was convinced others had wronged me I felt rejected I was in pain and my attitude fed that pain I did not want to come back but sometime in February 2017 we quietly returned snuck in the back door and started attending service here again brother Aaron graciously allowed me to speak here again that was March 26 2017. it was the fifth time I had addressed the congregation five a number of Grace if the spirit of the Lord was so precious that Sunday evening as a song service ended and I came to this desk before I shared the message that was on my heart I apologized Church I did not attempt to justify myself for what I did I confessed I was wrong I realized that my actions my reactions had caused hurt and pain to the local Body of Christ I selfishly hurt each and every one of you and I was grieving the Holy Spirit you see we are a body and when I withdrew myself from this assembly I was taking away a part of God's spirit with me it may be I only contributed one molecule amongst a billion but even that is still injuring the body we're like this picture of a jigsaw puzzle with 30 000 pieces thirty thousand pieces as brother Daniel tells us every piece has to be present Victor is not complete Jesus said it's better to enter the kingdom without an eye or a hand or a foot than to not enter it but obviously it's even better to enter hole the real problem brother Lyle was dealing with was that he had one foot in the grave and thus I had one foot out the problem was not what was said or done by others it was my reactions that helped me realize that I was not dead to self through this experience God was being kind to me allowing me see myself letting me realize I was the problem my reaction is revealed my weaknesses and my failures all of which meant that this old man my sinful nature was still all too alive and well if you want to turn in your Bible to Luke 9. right after Peter had proclaimed him to be the Christ Jesus turned in he said to them all to his disciples Luke 9 23. if any If any man will come after me let him deny himself take up his cross daily and follow me I Must Die daily not by taking a pill lethal injection I must Crucify My Flesh not easy but if I'm dead that I have no feelings to be hurt no grievances to nurture no anger to feed each of us individually is to have the Life of Christ only when we are dead can he Quicken us to his life and he knew that we would constantly be warring with our own flesh so we said we must take up our cross daily not once but every day our old nature must submit to his it's a constant battle it will be until we're fully changed into his likeness brother Matt Watkins shared that with us just a few weeks ago here as he was being nailed to the cross Jesus cried out father forgive them they don't know what they're doing God answered that cry of Jesus I know because I was the one who crucified him and he's forgiven me and I've accepted that forgiveness brother bran we're talking about a pardon in the Civil War that the pardon's not departed unless you accept it Christ has forgiven us but we have to accept it and it's that not acceptance that causes the condemnation what did Stephen say when he was being cruelly slain we read Stephen had addressed this group they got so angry some of them did a Mike Tyson on him that says they gnashed on him with their teeth they bit him these people were upset they cast even out of the city and stoned him that's not tossing Pebbles and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet whose name was Saul and they stoned Stephen rocks big enough to break his bones to crush his skull Stone Stephen who was calling upon God and saying Lord Jesus receive my spirit and Stephen kneeled down I suspect probably he collapsed and cried with a loud voice they could all hear Lord lay not this sin to their charge and when he had said this he fell asleep he passed away he died Stephen forgave those who were not repentant not sorry and not asking to be forgiven those who were determined to deliberately snuff out his life in a brutal and barbaric way let's reread those closing verses of Ephesians 4. this time from the Amplified Bible Ephesians 4 30. do not grieve the holy spirit of God do not offend or Vex or sadden him by whom you were sealed marked branded as God's Own secured for the day of redemption of final Deliverance through Christ from Evil and the consequences of sin let all bitterness and indignation and Wrath passion rage bad temper and resentment anger animosity and quarreling brawling clamor contention and slander evil speaking abusive or Blasphemous language be banished from you with all malice spite ill will or baseness of any kind but don't be guilty of any of that instead become useful and helpful and kind to one another tenderhearted passionate understanding loving-hearted forgiving one another readily and freely as God in Christ forgave you is our example sister Martha if you'd return brother Peter if you'd prepare to come up I'd like to close the service tonight and turn the service over to brother Peter with a song that's derived from Ephesians chapter 1 18. and the King James it says the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that she may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints and the NIV it reads I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened in order that you may know the hope to which he has called you The Riches of his glorious inheritance in his holy people the song is titled Open the Eyes of My Heart and because I have such a hard time [Music] I turn you over to brother Peter Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord Open the Eyes of My Heart I want to see I want to see let's stand Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord Open the Eyes of My Heart I want to see I want

called Heal Me O Lord KIVI flat but he'll also Lord I can't be whole unless your hole You can't be holding us I'm gonna wear a body heal us so long whatever's gotten in the way I believe that's why
