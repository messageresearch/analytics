want to do that i want to do that for you speak lord and i'll be quick to answer you i'm happy to be here tonight and a bit nervous not nervous because of you but because we have a great responsibility together me to seek to be careful to say what the lord once said and you to hear in the spirit what he has for you to hear regardless of my flaws and mistakes paul tells us in ephesians 2 8 that faith is a gift and in romans 10 17 he tells us that it comes by hearing the word of god as the disciples implored jesus in luke 17 5 increase our faith so we desired that the lord would help us to speak and hear this evening in a way that would increase our faith brother matt watkins spoke here recently using is an example from brother branham contrasting the cockle bird that that that old nature of ours that prickly nature and the wheat germ the seed of god planted within us it's just an illustration of course but it helps us understand the ongoing conflict within our lives as we fight to conform to the spirit's desire while we're struggling with and in our flesh battling our own sinful nature striving to seek and do his will we can say like the man in mark 9 24 whose son was possessed of a demon who cried out with tears the bible tells us lord i believe help thou my unbelief i wonder if we could stand together before we read the word and approach the author lord jesus we're honored and humbled to be together with believers of light precious faith lord gathered here of our free will to honor you to worship you to praise you to hear from you to reach out to draw lord i pray that as you're here this evening lord that you'd meet the needs in each heart lord i i don't want to just stand up here and push play and say get me out of the way and speak but lord it's not pushing play it's the desire of my heart lord that i would be out of the way lord that you could speak to your people that are gathered here tonight lord because they're your people you purchase them at great cost lord jesus we thank you for your presence for your love your mercy and your grace and pray that you be with us now this evening as we commit the remainder of this service again into your hands in jesus name we ask amen the topic i have on my heart this evening is what we often call the great commission it's found in the gospels of matthew mark and luke and in the first part of acts also written by luke they're instructions that jesus gave after his resurrection and prior to his ascent i i want to read these together as as one account before we're seated in luke 24 and verse 46 we read and jesus said unto them who's them his disciples what's a disciple well we're going to talk about that this evening thus it is written and thus it behooved that means it was needful it was necessary for christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at jerusalem that that first part of verse 47 that's exactly what we read about in peter's famous sermon in acts 2. faithful jewish people from among all the nations were gathered in jerusalem and peter's very first message was one of repentance and remission of sins jesus goes on to say ye are witnesses of these things of christ's suffering and resurrection and he says and behold in other words listen closely now i who jesus i send the promise of my father upon you but tarry ye remain and wait in the city of jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high then get up and stop waiting this cherrying is not to be your permanent state it's not to be your goal in acts one starting at verse four and the resurrected jesus being assembled together with them the eleven disciples and others commanded the assembled group that they should not depart from jerusalem but wait for the promise of the father which saith you've heard of me of jesus for john truly baptized with water but ye who the disciples and others gathered with them you shall be baptized with completely immersed into the holy ghost not many days hence it's coming skipping down to verse 8 jesus continues but ye shall receive a comfortable living oh no peace and safety from rome no ye shall receive power after that the holy ghost has come upon you this is that power from on high with which you'll be endued the promise of the father sent by jesus and why for what purpose do they need that power from the holy spirit why is god going to all the trouble to play out this plan here's the reason ye shall be witnesses unto me about me of mine both in jerusalem and in all judea and in samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth everywhere and in mark 16 and matthew 28 putting those together and jesus said unto them go ye therefore into all the world preach the gospel to every creature and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost which we know that name is the lord jesus christ teaching them to observe all things how many things are they supposed to observe oh how many do we get to skip or gloss over or not like and not do none all things whatsoever i have commanded you anyone here have a list of all jesus commands recorded in the gospels apart from holding up your bible amy oh i don't either but i'm working on it and lo he says i'm with you always even to the end of the world amen that ends matthew's account mark goes on a bit further he says he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be condemned these signs shall follow them that believe my name shall they cast out devils speak with new tongues take up serpents if they drink any deadly thing it won't hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover please be seated ye are witnesses jesus said to his disciples but you also shall be by witnesses does that remind you little brother green acts 4 20 i cannot but speak those things which i've seen and heard when he came to our house the first time we used to have people guests right on our table cloth and he wrote large letters perry green acts 4 20. what does it mean to be a witness to give your testimony as in a court telling of your personal experience with christ how you got your fire lit we're told in revelation 12 11 that they the believers at the end time overcame him who satan how firstly by the blood of the lamb and secondly by the word of their testimony and thirdly their attitude was that they loved out their lives unto the death so certainly our testimony is very important it's a very powerful part of this great commission but what is that great commission really we recall brother branham relating an incident in the life of billy graham i'll just paraphrase it at a breakfast in louisville kentucky reverend graham lodged a complaint with the gathered ministers he said he'd go into a city and have tens of thousands of converts people who made decisions to follow christ he'd return months later and could hardly find any he noted that in paul's day the opposite happened reverend graham scolded what he called the lazy preachers with their feet on their desks for not going out and following up with the people brother branham commented that the real problem was in those meetings billy graham had not taken people beyond a decision raising their hand coming forward and so forth paul on the other hand had taken them all the way to being baptized and filled with the holy spirit but in fairness we hear the recordings of many of brother branham's meetings looking at the dates we realize that brother branham often did the very thing call people to raise their hands accept the lord as their personal savior and within a couple of days he was in another town reaching out and preaching again he didn't or at least rarely stayed with all of those who raised their hands and prayed and stayed with them until they received the full baptism of the holy spirit but that's how evangelistic campaigns were held in the late 40s through the 1960s i was in such evangelistic meetings including giant tet meetings as a child i remember going forward in a billy graham crusade at the cow palace in san francisco in the late spring of 1958. that incredibly cute little kid in the corner that's me at age eight right but oh billy graham that's him at age 39 okay but i went forward but not for the right reason i saw both of my big brothers go forward that evening my oldest brother paul at age 16 my brother noel at age 13 they were responding but i the eight-year-old baby of the family wanted to go with them to do what they did now we know that there is what we call the five-fold ministry really it's just a way of saying that there are many parts to ministry one part is evangelism what brother branham mostly did especially in the early years what billy graham always did introducing people to jesus christ preaching declaring there's also teaching which brother branham did more of in his later ministry especially at his home church going into depth at the evangelist plants the teacher waters paul goes into this in first corinthians the third chapters using himself and a man named apollos as examples first corinthians 3 6 we read paul says i have planted i was the evangelist i planted apollos watered he was a teacher but god gave the increase so then neither is he that planteth anything neither he that watereth it isn't about us but god that giveth the increase it's all about him now he that plants and he that waters are one every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labor for we are laborers he says together with god not just in but with well other parts of ministry include pastoring shepherding helping people deal with the problems of real life as they go through life being a counselor there are apostles what we call missionaries people who go someplace and stay long enough to do what brother branham was referring to in the incident i mentioned with billy graham the work of the apostle of course is different than the work of the evangelist there's the prophet not just the way that we look upon brother branham is bringing us revelation but like the ones you read about in acts like agabus prophesying to paul that if you keep going this way you go to jerusalem you're going to wind up in prison brother in much of his early ministry brother branham was doing the work of an evangelist similar to billy graham exposing people to the gospel encouraging them to turn to christ handing them off to others for instruction and growth paul on the other hand was often doing the work of an apostle a missionary staying with a community of believers for weeks months sometimes even years until they were filled with the holy spirit teaching them their scriptures getting them grounded understanding what it means to be a christian answering their questions helping them overcome their backgrounds usually pagan and filled with hedonistic practices after he left we see him maintaining contact with him as we read in his epistles either by writing or sending others or going back himself my parents-in-law heather's dad and mom ted and millie ware were missionaries not travelers that go someplace for a few days or weeks and come home and call themselves missionaries not part of or supported by any denomination not sent out with a guaranteed or even committed level of financial support from some large congregation just going out because that is what they believe the lord called them to do the wares went and stayed for years cuba spain even tucson when they went to cuba with their five small children they didn't even speak spanish they learned the language as they spread the gospel in a country where few spoke english yet out of the work of her dad and mom and others who worked with them there is today an independent cuban-based pentecostal church movement that i've been told is the largest independent christian movement in cuba today some 64 years after they were forced to leave in the midst of the revolution under fidel castro they had stayed and planted and cultivated and the seeds they planted continued to bear fruit two and three generations later you can read that story in the book i'm displaying on the screen or a website of the same name with the love.com it's free i'm not selling anything there's nothing for sale on the website there's no gimmicks just a solid testimony tonight i want to take a closer look at what we call the great commission we'll even delve into some translations other than the king james to help us understand what jesus was saying to his team before he ascended but let's start by asking a couple of questions are we to witness in order to win converts or are we to teach in order to make disciples or both are those two sides of the same coin two ways to say the same thing do we all have identical roles in this commission and what is a disciple anyway as we read in luke jesus told his followers to wait in jerusalem until they would be endued filled provided with power from on high now the verse just before the great commission in matthew's account i find to be striking jesus came and spoke unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth jesus said all power was given unto him then he told them to wait until he gave them a measure of that power which in one verse we read he called the promise of the father and in acts he described the purpose of that power that he was going to share with them the king james version but she shall there's no maybe here there's no perhaps it's unequivocal you shall receive power who's the source of that power we just read it to whom all power was given jesus you shall receive power after that the holy ghost has come upon you and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem and in all judea and samaria to the outermost part of the earth so we ask ourselves what did jesus mean to be a witness unto me that were to tell jesus about something to witness to jesus let's look at another translation this is from the complete jewish bible but you will again there's no doubt you will receive power when the ruach hakodesh that literally that's the hebrew it means the wind the exhalation the breath of the holy comes upon you you will be my witnesses both in yerushalayim jerusalem and in all yahudah judea and shamrone samaria indeed to the ends of the earth the new american standard bible reads you'll receive power ability efficiency might when the holy spirit has come upon you you shall be my witnesses both in jerusalem and in all judea samaria as far as the remotest part of the earth so we are to be empowered by jesus witnesses of jesus to other people well what is this empowered witness let's turn back to matthew's gospel 28 19 go ye therefore and teach all nations all nations this is for everyone all races all kindreds all tongues all people everywhere it's not a jewish thing restricted to the descendants of jacob and not just witnesses of jesus but we collectively remember we each have a unique role to fill in god's plan but together we are to teach those we contact teach them what the next first teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i have commanded you what i thought it was all about grace you mean we have to observe things there's actually things we have to do teach things be an example to others of these things teach if you go into a classroom a public school a university the place where you might be homeschooling what do you see a teacher professor instructor and one or more students the teacher's job is to provide knowledge in a way that the students can comprehend the student's job is to pay attention to study the material to drill on it practice on it and be tested on it now if you want to learn calculus or even if you don't want to learn calculus you need algebra then trigonometry once you sufficiently mastered algebra and trig and demonstrated that you've mastered them then and only then can you move on to calculus and then you realize that calculus isn't the end it's only the beginning of higher math there's an order to things as we discussed a few meetings ago the first step in becoming a christian experiencing the new birth is repentance not baptism not being a witness but repenting godly sorrow a sincere and heartfelt recognition of sin in one's life and a strong desire to change it's the same as a step one in the alcoholics anonymous 12-step program to recover from alcoholism one must first look in the mirror and see an alcoholic not excuses heather often tells of requesting prayer from brother red cyril for something she was struggling with early in our marriage we were in new zealand for the first time back in 1972. brother searle's response to her when she asked him for prayer was this i'll pray for you but there are four things you must agree to before i'll do that one recognize you have a problem realize it confess it two genuinely desire to be free from that problem no longer want it ask the lord to deliver you from it you have to pray fourth thank the lord for doing it he said if you'd agree to do this then he'd be willing to listen as you confess the problem and your desire to be rid of it and he'd pray with you as you pray for deliverance and he'd join you in thanking the lord for answering that prayer what was the result heather was completely delivered from that problem peter talks about the order of things as well he's just encouraged the believers in uh second in first peter chapter one to love one another he says with a pure heart fervently reminded them that as humans we have a brief sojourn on earth but that the word of the lord endures forever the same thing that isaiah wrote in chapter 40. and then in first peter chapter 2 he goes on he says wherefore therefore in light of the transitory nature of our human lives laying aside all malice desiring or wishing evil or harm or damage to another and all guile deception misrepresentation and hypocrisies play acting pretending and envies wanting what another has or wanting them to not have it and all evil speakings there's enough there for the rest of this evening peter's telling us what we must do after which he says as newborn babes recent converts to christ having done what he just said had to do then and only then are we ready to start growing into christ desire the sincere milk of the word the easily digested the soft lessons that you may grow thereby growth is a process it requires nutrients energy instruction time remember we're talking about the order of things and in the context of the great commission if so be have tasted that the lord is gracious he goes on to whom coming that is coming to the lord as unto a living stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of god and precious we read elsewhere christ is the chief cornerstone foundation the very beginning peter's reminding and exhorting here in ancient times buildings didn't have reinforced concrete slabs poured and then dimensional lumber framing dirt soil sand was removed down to the bedrock and then stones were shaped sometimes mortared into place and what's that bedrock that that foundation is built on jesus told peter upon this rock this bedrock the revelation of who i am i will build my church goes on he also is living stones or built up a spiritual house what's that a temple a habitation for god himself a building takes more than one stone each stone has to individually be shaped to fit properly to its neighboring stones if the structure is to have integrity to withstand the ravages of weather and time and remain try and count the bricks in the structure of this building where we're currently worshiping my friends we're in this together we can only function as a body a temple of the lord if we have unity not uniformity but unity a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual the sacrifice costs you something acceptable to god by jesus christ paul also refers to this really underscores that there's an order a progression to growth in the spiritual life of a christian as well as a goal he's scolding the congregation in this portion of his letter to the jewish christians in hebrews 5 verse 12. he says when for when for the time ye ought to be teachers by now paul says you've been instructed you've sat under careful ministry you've heard the word you've repented you've been baptized you've received the holy spirit but you're content to keep feasting rather than go out and work you should be out there bringing others in but instead ye have need that one teach you again paul says you've already been taught but you haven't put it into practice so your faith has grown weak instead of strong you haven't exercised that faith back to square one to being taught again and another place he describes those who are ever learning but never able to come to the knowledge of the truth we're not to sit and receive and then debate and argue and split we're to learn and apply and test and grow and become useful to god's kingdom he says that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of god it becomes such as have need of milk not strong meat everyone that uses that depends on that requires milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness as peter said he's a babe strong meat food nourishment this is king james it's not talking about animal protein belongs to them that are of full age mature grown up adults even those who by reason of use those that have put theory into practice the ones james calls doers of the word and not hearers only have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil paul calls rightly dividing correctly interpreting applying well we spent considerable time this evening laying a foundation for understanding the great commission you're probably thinking yeah brother lyle i i know this of course are trying to grow to become mature christians what's your point we so often hear that we're to be witnesses we spoke last time about being salty about our value and the kingdom of god being directly related to being salty or of being a shining light but we i so often think that what we're asked to do is tell our testimony of how we came to the lord that's it done but jesus didn't simply say go into all the world and tell people your testimony that's part of it he didn't say go into all the world and be evangelists but that's part of it so you ask well well what did he say he said after you have received power from on high go into all the world preach the gospel and teach teach all nations teach them to observe my commandments in other words disciples disciples let's define and understand this word we'll look at the greek for a moment after all how often do you use the term disciple apart from church or a religious context no no it's not part of our modern english usage so let's look at the word used in matthew 28 19 to go and teach the greek word is you don't need to remember that and intransitively in other words as the listener it means to become a pupil transitively that is the one that's speaking is to disciple to enroll as a scholar to instruct to teach well is this a new thing that jesus is telling us let's go back to israel in the wilderness in sinai deuteronomy chapter 5. moses called all israel and said unto them hear o israel listen up pay close attention to the statutes and judgments which i speak in your ears be hearers of the word which i speak in your ears this day that ye may learn them be students be disciples of the torah and keep and do them be doers of the word that you hear to learn the statutes and judgments the word become students disciples not just to pass an exam get a grade on a report card check a box on a list but immerse yourself in them thy word have i hid in my heart david wrote in the psalms that i might not sin against thee it's not some superficial thing later in deuteronomy moses tells people that you should speak of these things in the morning speak of them in the daytime speak of them in the evening teach your children it's an ongoing ongoing ongoing practice at the end of deuteronomy we read chapter 31 verse 9 moses wrote this law and delivered it unto the priests the sons of levi which bear the ark of the covenant of the lord and unto all the elders of israel and moses commanded them it's not optional saying at the end of every seven years and the solemnity of the year of release and the feast of tabernacles pick up your feast of tabernacles when all israel has come to appear before the lord thy god and the place which he shall choose tabernacles was one of the three times in the year that they were together thou shalt read and he's telling them you read this aloud most people were unable to read literacy was not common read aloud this law before all israel how do we know he's reading it aloud because they're to read it in their hearing so you have to speak loud enough for them to hear and they have to be quiet enough to listen and pay attention so there's again a call to listen carefully he says gather the people together men women children all the descendants of jacob regardless of age or gender and to thy stranger that is within thy gates it's not just for the chosen it's for your neighbors as well and here's why they need to listen and pay attention that they may hear and that they may learn and fear the lord your god and observe to do all the words of this law it's so important that we be doers and not just hearers including of the great commission our topic this evening he says and that their children which have not known anything may hear and learn to fear the lord your god as long as you live in the land whether you go over jordan to possess it now those of you that are taking notes if you want a special blessing when you go home read nehemiah chapter 8. it's only 18 verses long and we call these few verses here from deuteronomy and see if you don't get a blessing maybe we'll talk about that some future time well god doesn't change his requirements don't change he imparts faith as a gift and requires faith how does faith come by hearing paying attention to learning the word to hear someone has to speak to teach and teaching is part of what we call the great commission peter said repent and be baptized every one of you on the day of pentecost some fifteen hundred years after moses spoke these words but notice what the church then did they had fellowship with one another they shared they reinforced one another the original disciples of jesus spent their time in prayer and in the word which meant being ignorant fishermen and so forth they had to learn how to read their later ministry some of which is recorded in acts showed their increasing level of maturity paul is very clear in his letter to the jewish believers the epistle to the hebrews that they needed to become teachers not remain milk-dependent babies in his letters to timothy he encouraged timothy to study to show himself approved to be able to rightly divide to not get caught up in endless arguments about genealogies and philosophies he told titus to set up leaders in the communities on crete well let's look at the ones we call the 12 disciples we're talking about disciples right jesus walked talked lived ate with him for more than three years he was quite the teacher there must have been some difficult times for jesus as the teacher as well as for the disciples as students when he taught and they didn't understand what he was saying he pulled them aside and explained things to them he instructed them patiently repeating when they were ready he sent them out in pairs to preach the good news to heal and to deliver and not just the 12 there were at least 70 up to that point as well as we read in luke 10. he didn't carefully select and choose people who were politically and philosophically compatible we've talked in the past how we had among the 12 a roman collaborator matthew a despised corrupt minion of the occupying authority as one of his disciples and he had simon the zealot one whose background was to disrupt and destroy and even kill the hated roman occupiers part of the general group that led to the revolt some 30 years later in the destruction of the temple and 60 years after that the destruction of the land mass deportation of the jewish residents i wonder if when jesus was talking to the disciples at the end of his ministry and they were saying oh look at this great city in this temple and how wonderful it is and he said there won't be one stone left on another i wonder if he didn't look at simon the zealot when he said that knowing that it was the zealots that would provoke rome to bring about that destruction i doubt that simon the zealot and matthew would have been friends much less co-workers before jesus called them both i suspect whichever was first may have questioned jesus about the second now jesus you do know what kind of person he is right we don't know the political leanings of the other 10 or even of jesus himself but it's clear like in our country today people were deeply divided over their government its leaders its policies yet their disciples were able to walk together to talk together to learn together and change the world in a way they never could have imagined together in terms of backgrounds in addition to matthew the public and collaborator and simon the zealot four of them were commercial fishermen on the lake of galilee james john peter probably andrew the other six philip bartholomew thaddeus james son of alphaeus thomas judas iscariot we have no record or the order in which they joined his wandering band nor the other 70 who were also disciples and sent out to preach and teach and heal and deliver early in his public ministry nor when the various female disciples like mary magdalene salome joanna susanna joined them luke 8 and matthew 27 and other places in the gospels tell us there were many women that followed jesus from galilee and ministered to him we know peter was married we don't know about the other eleven what we do know is the all-called jesus master not like master slave boss business whatever but master is teacher rabbi an instructor one who is the master of what he taught remember when mary magdalene first saw the resurrected jesus she saw him and thought he was a gardener we read in john 2016 that when he identified himself to her by simply speaking her name mary what did we hear last sunday my sheep know my voice she immediately called him teacher master the source of knowledge to the student people were generally non-literate until very recent times literacy the ability to read and write was uncommon in the ancient world there were no public libraries the books as we know them didn't exist there were scrolls and codices a forerunner of a book these were extremely expensive the few libraries that did exist were renowned such as the one in alexandria in egypt when jesus reads from the isaiah scroll and the synagogue and nazareth are told that all eyes were on him is not this the carpenter's son they marveled at his teaching later in the temple we're told in john's gospel that the jews marveled saying how knoweth this man letters having never learned in other words reading was a specialized skill how where did he learn to read teaching was oral to go into the world and teach all nations making disciples means that we must grow to know the scriptures and be able to share teach them to others becoming the teachers and the listeners becoming disciples students and they are to eventually become teachers themselves as we read in the letter to the hebrews after all they're us right the greek commission as i mentioned already there's an order to things as in any life there's birth growth eventual maturity and part one of the great commission is to be a witness a preacher a declarer i often think of my friend brother mike yarborough in this context when he was an undergraduate student at rice university in houston texas he made acquaintance with another student named carl mount carl had recently become a christian he began to participate in a group called campus crusade for christ for those of you that are younger than me well that's most of you the term crusade was often used during the 1940s and 50s and 60s to mean a campaign to reach to conquer general eisenhower the supreme commander of allied forces in europe and world war ii called the allied campaign to defeat hitler's so-called fortress europe a crusade billy graham turned his evangelistic campaign's crusades to conquer the world for christ spreading the gospel message of salvation in 1951 bill and jonette bright founded campus crusade for christ it's now called crew on the campus of ucla los angeles campus crusade's mission was making disciples not just converts and that meant doing not just hearing one of the goals was to reach at least one person a week for christ carl mounts for such assignment was mike yarborough many of you have heard mike's testimony i won't try to give it here i suspect it's in the archives of the church mike spoke here a couple of sunday evenings in 2013 or 14 had carl mount here as well mike became an active witness for christ his entire life certainly over all the years when i was acquainted with him the great commission go ye therefore teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father the son and the holy ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i have commanded you and lo i'm with you always i'll work together with you in this even unto the end of the world jesus was clear through some of his commands to us love god love others he said on these two commands hung all the law and the prophets repent of our sins believe in him spread the good news god's salvation was never meant to be a secret when i was young the bible was generally accepted as being authoritative or at least not to be ignored or despised it wasn't unusual to be discussing some aspects of it and the playground of the public school that i attended as a kid we'd sometimes discuss our sunday school lessons with others and compare what their church taught not to challenge not to disagree but simply to share with each other these days a skeptical world rejects biblical authority demands supporting evidence and sadly many christians today approach the bible confrontationally insist that their interpretation of the bible is the only accurate one usually with no background other than what they heard some preacher claim it meant when we witness and share with others we need to be careful to get the foundation the fundamentals in place come up here thank you no one is saved because they believe brother branham was a prophet or that believing jesus is the son of god or that he died on the cross for our sins our salvation our eternal life hangs on the thread of each one recognizing his or her individual sin sincerely repenting accepting jesus christ as personal savior surrendering his or her life to him we must enter a relationship with him such that we not only claim to know him but his brother adam shared with us last sunday he knows us nothing else will do and the salvation of our neighbor may depend on our sharing these truths lord help us not to be guilty of that iniquity to know to do right and refrain from doing it and always to be sensitive to your spirit guiding us each step along our path of life as we close i'd like us to sing a song about spreading the good news there's a verse that comes to mind and it reads like the great commission but it was written by isaiah isaiah 52 7 how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings good news the gospel that publishes peace that brings good tidings of good that publishes salvation publish means to spread not to print that saith unto zion thy god reigneth the song i'd like us to sing it's actually taken from a christmas carol go tell it on the mountains i'm i'm using some verses that i heard george beverly shea used during the billy graham crusades in the 50s we'll start with the chorus as brother aaron comes to close the service if you know it sing if you don't know it sing anyway we'll start with the chorus we've got a couple of verses here go tell it on the mountains over the hills and everywhere go tell it on the mountains that jesus christ is lord when i was a learner i sought both night and day i asked the lord to aid me and he showed me the way the mountains over the hills
