verse one to verse [Music] 5 James chapter 2 verse one reads like this my brethren have not the Faith of Our Lord Jesus Christ the lord of Glory with respective persons for if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring and goodly apparel and there come in also a poor man in Vile reignment and you have respect to him that wearth the gay clothing and say unto him sit thou in a good place and say to the poor stand thou there or sit under my foot stool are you not then partial in your yourselves and are are become judges of evil thoughts hearken my beloved Brethren hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith and Heirs of the Kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him Heavenly Father we are grateful for your word Lord if I could just read one scripture and father I know that this Sunday morning would be a success because my words were fail but your words would never fail father we're grateful for your word from this man Apostle James Lord we pray that your blessings would be upon us today give me wisdom father I ask in Jesus name amen amen you can be seated thank you it's good to see everyone the house of the Lord I we were um got quite a few texts this morning he I'm not going to be there my family's going to be gone and and then the Lord Lord provided the Robson family to fill in all the gaps God bless you brother Joe I'll tell you what um I uh brother Joe and I we go way back um we used to play basketball together and and hang out before we were married and um he's uh he's somebody that I have a tremendous respect for for he's a man that has a calling in his life and he's he's a deacon and I've have seen that as we learned in the previous chapter and we will be talking about in this chapter of James that not only does the words come out of his mouth but he's got a life to back it up I appreciate brother Joel I appreciate the family sister Aon I saw that baby's been passed back and forth congratulations on the little the grandbaby there you you heard brother Dylan um sing and um welcome from is it North Carolina aren't you there you know you haven't been gone that long you're already talking like a North Carolina I noticed yeah yes but it's it's h it's good to have you my friend God bless you God God bless you all um appreciate uh any other visitors that we have I don't see anyone else that doesn't look really familiar um good to have you in the house of the Lord I'm uh I'm thankful this is this has been a week and I know I addressed it last week and I think that it would be remiss if as a pastor of the church that I didn't address the uh the articles that came out in the paper over this past week I mentioned them last week and I said quite a bit about it and um I would I'd like to again say something because I think I'd be failing if if I didn't say something I know that you all have said we don't care and and I do appreciate that it really made me feel good I told Brother Lyall that after service last Sunday I I said I said man brother L I said you know what made me feel so good about the congregation is that they really I could tell they really don't care these these things coming out and and it's like we're not we're not part of that and and we just stand with what we believe we we stand with Jesus Christ and him crucified and and we acknowledge that God has done a great work in this day and we just continue on we continue on with with uh serving the lord but I want to also reme have the congregation remember and the reason I am saying this as many of you have come from these churches that are mentioned in these articles and all of you can testify that these words that are written are written about from written about real people and it's easy for us to stereotype a group of people or a church but we have to remember that these are real Flesh and Blood people and they have feelings they have thoughts on things they have the many of them I'm sure are embarrassed about these articles and they may disagree with them but it's still it's an embarrass inter in thing when when you put people up on the on the front page of the paper and and then negative things are said about them whether those negative things are true or false it's still it it hurts and remember these people on both sides remember to pray for them and always reach out a right hand of Fellowship to them and and love them ultimately we have to realize that each one of these people they have a soul and God cares about that Soul that's what's important to him never stereotype people brothers and sisters and we're going to if we can get to our chapter in James today we're going to see that James strictly forbids that this stereotypical way of viewing but we look at ourselves and we look at that um all that has gone on in this past week and we know that there are scriptures like Romans 8 verse 28 that says that all these things they all work together for the good to those who love God and to those who are called according to his purpose so these things are good and they they are working out for the good and this situation should be a time of reflection that we look at at what's going on and and what's said and as Paul said he said let a man examine himself we should exam examine ourselves as should every everyone Lord are my beliefs are my doctrines are they right according to your word and I I got to tell you I I've been a bit disappointed with some of the responses that have come um on well actually I've been disappointed on both sides and I think both sides everything in these articles I think has been misrepresented it's been misrepresented from the certain people that I know of now the people I don't know of I can't speak for them exaggerating and being a a a victim when they're not a victim and then other thing other on the other side representing the the their beliefs these pastors and and spokesmen and basically trying to run towards the middle and say oh we just believe Jesus but brother you've been preaching something else for your whole life or you've been preaching something else from your church and what you're saying now is just a response to somebody calling you out to out from it I don't agree with that either I I don't people say that you know that they they say we don't excommunicate people you may call it by a different name just an exercise and semantics really but you do and they say that oh we're not a cult we're not a denomination we just point people to the Bible Well then why are we trying to reflect the reporter's questions things that you regularly preach from the pulpit and trying to just just go back to mainstream almost every comment I saw was trying to get oh we're just normal we we just we just preach Jesus Christ yeah but you don't you preach Jesus plus something else I mentioned last week that brother braham's name was once associated with great healing revivals and and ministers meetings where Baptists and methodists and Pentecostals and Catholics they would come together in unity and now it's associated with Scandal and cultish behavior is that brother brandom's fault or have those who have followed his teachings M misrepresented him through Doctrine derived from his sermons that have nothing that have done nothing but caused Division and sometimes worse it's behaviors like telling your congregation stay away from church stay home listen to the tapes rather than fellowshipping rather than bringing your gift into the church and contributing to the church just stay home just be quiet and just sit there and and hold up in your house and just listen to a tape show me where show me where in the word of God or where where William brandom ever taught anything like that it's nonsense or their be behaviors like shunning people taking them out from under the blood when they disobey the teachings of the local church as I said they may put some other label on it that's just semantics but you do preach those things and those things do go beyond what has been taught in this word and they're constantly preaching about dress codes and about trying to get everyone to look exactly alike and then when the reporter ass oh they just downplay it oh no no no we're just normal but you do preach those things that do go beyond modesty and they do go beyond Holiness even speaking a language that people that are Christians they can't even understand it I've been I've been to be when we came here Stephanie and I moved here tried to go to every message church and some others just like Lord where do you want us where do you want us to go where is the place that would that would that that we could help and that would would benefit us and our families and and I went to a church that listen I was born in brother Brown's message if you listen to tapes you know who my family is I went to a church I had no idea what they were talking about saying things that that they mentioned William they mentioned brother brandom's name and then saying saying all these things it's like it's like what are you I don't I don't understand I don't understand these these ways of speaking it doesn't make sense to me and we do the same thing brother we got the UN unadulterated word of God spoken by the seventh angel messenger turn the hearts of the fathers to the children hearts of children to the fathers and father and and call a bride out of the church to the third pole and return Ministry what what does this have to do with Jesus and you see so many people they just say brother I just want to give my heart to Christ I just want to change my way of living amen I I just want to I want to come I want I want to do like this Bible says I want to I want to have the same benefits that are promised in this Bible what are you talking about you need to ask yourself we need to ask ourself that when some of these things are brought up and I believe that these articles as I said I don't like them I think it's wrong all the way around but we have to ask ourselves Lord what about me what about the way I think and so many times you hear from the pulpit you got to just believe you got to just have faith you got to just just accept as a truth wait a minute It also says to work out your own salvation through fear and trembling you need to make sure that you are right we need to make sure we believe right there needs to be a self-reflection and if you claim to believe the prophet and you follow his teachings maybe you should look yourself in the in the mirror that I mentioned in James chapter 1 and see if you're actually following what he taught or has the ministry changed so drastically over the past 60 years that it's not even recognizable if he would return today would he even recognize what's being preached or would he even recognize what the what the people are propagating what the people look like he would he even do that you have to ask yourselves I'm not answering the question I'm saying that you have to ask that and it's always when when these type of things rise up and it's it's throughout history it's always Christ plus something it always seems to be that that the in the addition we believe in Jesus but there's something more let me tell you that man Jesus Christ the Bible said that he is the express image of God so you look at Jesus Christ you are seeing the one that created the heavens and the Earth you're seeing the Alpha and the Omega you are seeing that Elohim that self that all existing one you are seeing God in flesh and when you say just get them to Christ and then introduce them to something else what exactly are you going to introduce them that is better than Jesus you got to be careful there is nothing greater than Jesus Christ now I might want to introduce them to something that will get them to that man that's good I might want to introduce them to something that will help them get healed if they're sick that shows that Jesus Christ is alive today I will introduce them to something like that amen but the ultimate destination is to get them to Jesus Christ who is God God himself the prophets role you're saying well what about the prophets we should believe the prophets the prophet's role is to represent God to point the people is is to take a message that God gave them and the point the people back to God and since God was manifested in human flesh it is their role to point people to Christ there's a a Buddhist saying if someone is pointing at the Moon to show you the moon don't mistake the finger that is pointing at the moon for the moon and if I or anyone else is pointing you to this cross don't look at my finger look at what my finger is pointing at and it's this cross and it's it's the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ and I as I said I was disappointed very disappointed and and all the way around and it reminded me of the Mormons the Mormons over the past 15 years they've the church has tried to move towards mainstream saying that they're Christians you know it's easy to see that the Mormon religion teaches extra biblical things and they're qu quick to say that we believe God sent a prophet to straighten out the apostasy that happened after the original disciples and that they what they neglect to say is that their core Doctrine comes from The Book of Mormon and not the Bible but when they're called out they're quick to point back to Jesus no no no no we're Christians but you're Christ plus something El joah witness the same thing they're seeing they're quick to say that they are Christians and they believe Jesus to be the Messiah but they take their Watchtower Publications and their own interpretation over the original text of the Bible and when they're called out they're Qui say oh no no no no we're Christians to to witness about Christ but then but there's something more there is nothing more brothers and sisters we've got it backwards so never say oh we appreciate what the Tucson Tabernacle is doing what brother Daniel Evans is doing he's getting them to Christ and then introducing to the message no no no no Christ is the ultimate destination he is God he is everything and I can show you that he's alive I can show you not only with what he's doing today I can show you what with with what he did 50 60 years ago 70 years ago he is a mighty God and he changes not you say well oh well what about you as I said they it's it's quick when you get called out it's quick to try to go to the middle and it's quick no no no no we're we're not weird we're not different but you ask me it's like well is this exclusive you know or or is it just one one group of people that get to go to heaven yes Jesus said I am the way the truth and the life and no man can come to the father except by me does that cut out anyone that doesn't believe in Jesus Christ I don't know I'm not the judge but it looks like it does it's what Jesus said Jesus said you search the scriptures and for in them you think you have eternal life and these are they which testify of me but you're not willing to come to me that you may have life scripture you're not willing to come to me that you might have life you have to have Christ plus and the plus ends up being more important in Christ yeah I believe the gospel I believe eternal life is exclusive to Jesus Christ and his abl um blood atonement I believe that a woman should Adorn herself in modest apparel with shamefacedness and sobriety not with gold or pearls or costly I believe that you know why I believe it because it's in the Bible don't criticize me for that that's Paul it's right it's right here yes I believe in what Jesus said he said I will know my I will know my disciples for your love one one for another I believe what he said I believe Christians should be one he didn't separate he said there'd be one Shepherd and one fault and I believe that Christians should be one I believe that I believe and I I fall short as as everyone does but I also believe that Jesus said if you love me keep my commandments so we should be doing everything that we can to keep his Commandments not just what what Jesus said but I believe this Bible is all of his Commandments but instead you know to be a True Believer you got to have the Bible plus brothers and sisters let me tell you that's not what my Bible says it says don't add anything to it I'm taking anything away from it and that's not what brother random said either and the the Catholics they are the most bold with it because there's over a billion of them and they're quick to tell you they're so good they're quick to tell you I'm not Christian I'm Catholic but they'll still claim Christ they're just more advanced in their progression for them it's Christ plus Mary Christ plus Peter Christ plus the papal Authority plus the authority of the church over the word it's the same Spirit where they interpret the Bible to match their beliefs rather than changing their beliefs to match the Bible you can write that one down it's where they interpret the Bible to match their beliefs rather than changing their beliefs to match the Bible and the division doesn't come from Christ the division comes from additions to Christ many of the churches and the ones I mentioned in the new newspaper they claim to be these things but sometimes I believe that they're more Catholic than the pope is where you have to believe it this way and we have authority to add to it you don't have authority to add to it listen this I was uh saw this article I was telling uh Dylan yesterday that um just now that um his name his baby's name is Jubilee and and the pope he uh proclaimed a year a holy year or something like that so and I saw it on the headline so I I flipped down I didn't read the article I just wanted to go to the comments um which is often by the way my sermon last Sunday I started getting all these negative comments I just shut them down we we turn the comments off on YouTube for that one I I'll turn them back on but I mean what good does it do you know but but listen to some of these comments on Fox news for this um article on the pope proclaiming this it's a bit of a benign thing but it says this uh this is one this I'll go through a lot of the comments it says for there is one God and one mediator between God and Mankind the man Christ Jesus it's not the pope and then the ne the response I guess you don't pray to God on behalf of your family and loved on since you can't be a mediator it's sad so Jesus I'm not saying these aren't my words so Jesus was wrong and an error when he formed the Catholic Church your Jesus is weak mine and per mine is perfect next comment is you're absolutely correct amen hallelujah then the next one no one says it was the pope next comment Jesus said call no man father and then the next comment another worm trying to outsmart Jesus who bestowed upon Peter The Rock and the keys to the kingdom of heaven so tiresome and ancient reminds me of The Wretched scribes who rejected Jesus the Galilean because they ass assume he couldn't have been born in Bethlehem search the scriptures then the next one spot on and the next one read Matthew 16:18 heretic then the next one funny how any mention of religion or spirituality brings out vile haters like a starting Bell at a horse race next one Cults you mean then the then the next in next one it says it brings out rabid anti-catholic Protestants as much as liberals poor poor schismatics jump off the bus and how they hate and how and now hate those that stayed on it's like man anti-catholic Protestants and liberals man they compared me to a liberal Ridiculousness and this is religion of today and we see it right back down at home brothers and sisters our words should always be positive our words should always be pointing to Christ and if they don't there's something there's something wrong mahat MC Gandhi you all know who that is the skinny Hindu guy that um he uh you know he stood against he he he stood against um uh war and stuff he was a good man he did great things he stood against war and he stood against um of the cast system in India uh really he was he was and he did great things and and Gandhi when he was younger he started reading the gospels and he started looking into Christianity and he said this is really something and he must have seen where where where that that Jesus said if somebody smacks you on this on the side of the face turn the other cheek and and let him smack that side and if you call someone a fool you're in danger of going to hell and if you look at someone who is not your spouse in a lustful way with a desire for that person rather than your spouse then you are guilty of adultery in your heart if your right hand causes you to sin cut it off for it would be better to lose your hand in this life than to perish in h in H now gny must have loved the discipline of Jesus Christ as he studied these gospels he read things like the tradition tradition has said that you should love your neighbor neighbor and hate your enemy but I say unto you love your enemies and bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and since reigned on the just and the unjust G he must have looked at these words of of Jesus and must have said in his heart this is it this is what I've been looking for Christ teaches that everyone is equal in the size of God no matter the race or the cast or their appearance Christ wants all of them together in peace and in unity and quit pointing your finger at the other guy and he saw this Jesus Christ in the Bible and he was looking and reading about this and he saw that this is it this is something so he said I'm going to go to church one Sunday morning he visited a Christian Church in Kolkata walked in I got this this um story from um the uh the um Kansas City newspaper and you can always believe what the newspapers say I'm kidding on that one but um he came to this Sunday Sunday morning church and he walked in they looked at him they looked at him up and down and said uh no you're not part of us you're not dressed like us you don't look like us you don't talk like us you're not some from the same cast as us us you can go and beond your way it wouldn't allow him into the church because of that rejection muhamad Gandhi never he turned his back on Christianity and he never came back because of the way that that one Church in Kolkata treated him I read this quote with this act Gandhi rejected the Christian faith never began to consider the claims of Christ he was turned off by the sin of the of the segregation that was practiced by the church and it was due to this experience that Gandhi later declared I'd be a Christian if it were not for the Christians what a shame what a shame when it comes down to it when someone enters the church congregation or your fellowship or whatever it is the question is always asked in our mind do you look like me do you believe like me do you act like me and if not how can I make you more like me instead of how can you make how can I make you how can I make myself more like the one who died on the cross that's what should be thought but our minds and we all do it our minds are thinking how can I make you look more like me or act more like me as I said it's it's always Jesus plus and never and we can't we can't even imagine how great Jesus is we can't even imagine how the one who created the heavens and the Earth as I said the express image of God Jesus Christ himself he's even what God looks like so you want to introduce people to him and according to James you are not special he's special and we're special because we believe him in him and looking on the outside app parents is what we're going to get to in the first verses in James 2 you're looking at the outside appearance 1st Samuel 16:7 this is when Samuel the prophet was choosing the successor to King Saul and um Jesse had eight Sons brought the first one there he he thought that that was going to be the one and then Samuel disregards him goes through all of the top seven of eight and God God refused every one of them until he got to the last one David and it didn't make sense in Samuel's mind it didn't make sense in Jesse's mind it didn't make sense in anybody's mind why would you choose this one this is the best looking the be the most well spoken the the as a pastor would be the most um the most learned and educated 1st Samuel 16:7 says that man I'll read the whole thing but the Lord said unto Samuel look not on his countenance or on the height of his stature because I have refused him for for the Lord seeth not as man seeth for man lookth on the outward appearance but the Lord looks on the heart James chapter 2 there's two themes in this chapter there's one is don't show favoritism and the second one is to put faith in action I don't know if we'll get through the whole chapter but we'll go as time allows chapter 2 verse one my brethren have not the Faith of Our Lord Jesus Christ the lord of G Glory with respect of persons the Lord Of Glory we I don't even I can't even get past that first that first phrase the Lord Of Glory the Glorious the Glorious Lord this one that rules over all the glory this is have not the Faith of Our Lord Jesus Christ the lord of Glory he's saying how great this man Jesus Christ is with respect to persons he's saying how can you even have faith in Jesus Christ if you prefer one person over the other usually as pastor and you know my Ministry I try to bring some correction to our congregation but I want to brag on our congre congregation here I want to tell you that I believe that this congregation is very good and treating everyone equal if you see somebody come in that you don't know I love the way that everybody's willing to shake their hand ask them where they're from talk to them it doesn't matter how they look I was last night we had the kids in the upper room and there was somebody out in the front of the church and I you know I was like well I'm going to go kick him out like I always do I walked out there as this man sitting there that I didn't recognize and he's he's sitting there and I said hey man this is private property and he says uh hey Pastor and I was like hi he says I'm Carlos he said I go to the I go to the church he says I come in and I I sit in the back he says do you know Arie Peterson I said yeah something that all the homeless people say by the way he said that's a great compliment on my friend yeah he said' do you know Arie Peterson I said yeah he said he's a very kind man he says no I come in and I sit in the back and he says I want to tell you that every time I come in he said I feel the presence of the Lord and he says you all are so nice and he said he says I really feel that God is with you and he says I just I'm looking for him right now I don't I don't see him come on Carlos let me down man but he he said that God is in that place and made me think back to what I'm preaching on right now that God is not a respector of persons that man that was sitting on the porch there has a soul that's worth 10,000 worlds a soul that's worth greater than anything that could ever H anything that could ever come from a rich man or or or a government or anything like that that soul is worth everything and he loves this place turns out he isn't homeless at all turns out that he got in a fight with his girlfriend and she kicked him out and um he was doing what the world has for you which is which is uh just hard times and uh he's going to be able to get himself straight so I was able to give him a little bit to help him and we had pizza upstairs so I brought him down some pizza and and I may have just sealed my eternal salvation by helping that one man who I believe is a child of God I saw brother Joel there as I said I bought a lot of stock in you so don't let me down I was driving down the highway I don't know a year ago or so and uh I'm cruising along and I see brother Joe's vehicle out there I believe is his van he's got his kids in there and and there's brother Joe out there and he's helping somebody change a tire a lady so I I pull in behind him and and I offer my help and I asked brother Joe I said um I said so who is this I just saw her beside the road and I just stopped to help and she didn't know what she was doing she didn't know how to change attire but there's God sent his angel in the form of Joe Robson and his family and there they are just helping somebody later on we won't get to it probably today but but James says you show me faith without works he said I show you my faith by my works right there it doesn't it didn't matter who she was it didn't matter what church that she was part of if she was a Christian or she wasn't a Christian he was there to help verse number two for there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring in goodly apparel and there come in also a poor man in Vile reignment and you have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing and say unto him sit thou here in a good place and say to the poor stand thou there or sit under here under my foot stol are ye not then partial in yourselves and become judges of evil thoughts the Amplified version of that scripture says have you not discri rated among yourselves and become judges with wrong motives what is it's Prejudice is what it is and what is Prejudice pre-judging prejudging someone by what they look like prejudging someone from where they come from pre-judging someone and not doing what a Christian should do which is putting out the right hand of Fellowship to whoever hearken my beloved Brethren hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith and Hees of the Kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him and it's not that you've treated the rich too good it's not that you've treated the Believers too good but it's that you haven't treated the others good enough maybe because they weren't important enough as I said Samuel said for the Lord Lord seeth not as a man seeth the man look looks on the outward appearance but the Lord looks on the heart verse number six but you have despised the poor do not rich man impress you and draw you before the Judgment seats do they not blaspheme the worthy Name by which you are called if you fulfill the Royal law according to the scripture Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself you do well he says the Royal law now we got to remember from from last week remember who James is James is the pastor of the church at Jerusalem he's also Jesus's half brother probably the same mother definitely a different father and here he is and he was with Jesus growing up when they were kids James was there can you imagine how that was being a brother of Jesus my brothers were always doing stuff wrong at least I accused them of it can you imagine being a brother to Jesus and then who did this well we know it wasn't Jesus had to be one of the other brothers or sister but he knew and even being as close to Jesus as he was he recognized this man his brother as the Christ as God in flesh and he said this and and James says if you fulfill the Royal law according to the scripture Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself you do well what is this Royal law Jesus puts special emphasis on this commandment if you could put up Matthew chapter 2 2 2: 36 says this master which is speaking to Jesus speaking to Jesus Master which is the great commandment in the law Jesus said unto him Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind we know that one this is the first and great commandment and the second is like unto Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself on these two Commandments hang all the law and the prophets so here's the whole Bible which we learned from Brother Lyall the other night that the law is speaking of the word and he's saying all of it hangs on these two Commandments that you love the Lord thy God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all thy mind and the second Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself how important these two Commandments all of the message all of the Bible everything hangs on those two Commandments back to James 29 but if you have respect to persons you commit sin and are convinced of the law as transgress transgressors there are so many ways to sin it's not just stealing lying or murdering or sexual improprieties or drugs or any of that there are ways to sin that are not defined they're everywhere and if you show partiality to someone you are sinning and it can send you to hell as I said there's a lot of ways to sin that's one of them just showing partiality to someone I've told this story before I want to tell it again of um there's a sermon that brother bran preached it's called um Souls that are in prison now at the beginning of that sermon if you listen to the tape someone faints and brother brandom it's so sweet brother brandom um she faints and he stops the service they have prayer for then they bring the lady up and he says you know what he says take her and he he says sit her on the platform behind me and they they bring her up and he says wait a minute he says as she's going by let me just lay my hands on her this is all on the tape She lays her hands on her prays for her background on this story those was a lady lady named Shirley no and Shirley was the sister-in-law to a young man named Garnet Peak does that sound familiar brother Joe you know who that is it's a young man who got polio and he lived down near act in Kentucky which is a couple hours south of Jeffersonville and he um got polio and and it just it it really went wild through his body he ended up being in an iron lung and having having a lot of applications and he ended up dying uh from it later on dying later on and this Garnet Peak somehow he heard and he somehow he got a hold of brother brandom's tapes he would save up his child support money his dad wasn't present in his life but he had to send the money so he would save up his child support money buy these tapes and listen and he just he just loved brother Brandon brother brandham knew him and he'd get sick and start um having problems getting close to death brother brand would call they'd pray together and he'd get better and time went on well he got really really low and he um was so bad that uh Shirley who loved him everybody loved this young man and he had a great personality and really fun to be around um and he'd lay in the in the living room and he loved to just look out the window at the birds he couldn't couldn't move from his bed and he tells Shirley and her husband dorlan um would you go here would you make the trip up to Jeffersonville to hear this man and uh Shirley's like I'm not going up there there a bunch of judgmental people they are I'm I'm not going to go up there I don't I don't want any part of them and he said would you just please just go for me and come back and tell me how it was and she says all right and so her and her husband they drive up to Jeffersonville they get there to towards the late towards the beginning of service they all the all the seats were taken so she goes up and she's standing against the wall and she's looking out across the audience and she's saying in her mind look at all these judgmental people and there she is she said her clothes weren't appropriate I don't know what that means when she told me the story and she says you know I was covered in makeup and my my clothes and and she's like oh you know I was just there and and she's looking out about all of these people and she says look out at all of these judgmental people and She fainted and she said she said brother Daniel she says I've never fainted to that point in my life and I never fainted after that she said but there I was she said doc brother brandom's brother takes out his handkerchief wets it and and puts it on her face to to try to to try to get get her back and and and brother brandom says bring her up here and set her on the platform right here behind me he sets her right outside right in front of his personal door where it went into his office and if you're familiar with the brandom Tabernacle there's a door right there it is right on the pulpit right where you can see and they take her up there and he looks down at her and he says these words he says I want to pray for her and he says Lord he says Satan is trying to trying to cheat your daughter out of a blessing your daughter and here she was like Gandhi didn't look the part maybe wasn't acting the part but a child of God brother Bram takes her up sets her the way she looked right in front of the congregation and preach that sermon souls are in prison now she was there and she's sitting there and she's thinking about these things and and she takes Doc's handkerchief was wet she wipes her face and she opens it up and she sees all of this paint on her handkerchief and she's said from that moment I was condemned and she said from that moment I believed and she turned out to be I tell you what if I've ever seen a Holy Spirit-filled Lady it's that lady very very special maybe it's the name Shirley it's a special name God doesn't show favoritism this is contrary it's contrary to the very nature of God if we show favoritism then we are representing something other than God and it's sin as I said there's so many ways to sin it may not be something outwardly that every that the whole world defines as Sin but it could be a black Sin of favoritism back to James verse 10 for whosoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one point he is guilty of all NIV version says this but if you show favoritism you sin and are convicted by the law as law Breakers everybody is quick to point out the sins of someone else but they're quick to also ignore their own sins remember I said in in last week's sermon that Martin Luther said that this book of James is the EP Epistle of straw and he didn't even believe it should be in the cannon of the Bible James is saying right here the same thing that Paul is saying because um Martin Luther was saying that this it's this is all about works and not Grace but look at what he's saying right here whosoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one point he is guilty of all he's ignoring that Paul he's not putting together that Paul said that all sinned and come short of the glory of God that we are all sinners and there is the grace there for he that said do not commit adultery said also do not kill now if thou commit ad no adultery and if thou yet thou kill thou are become a transgressor of the law so speak ye and do as they that shall be judged by the law of Liberty so the law must be obeyed and the law is liberating it's not a a hammer down on you saying you can't do anything anything just believing the law it's liberating that you can serve Jesus Christ and you can change your from your sinful ways for he shall have judgment for he shall have judgment without Mercy that has showed no mercy and mercy rejoiceth against judgment new King James says for judgment is without Mercy to the one who has shown No Mercy Mercy triumphs over judgment so the mercy that we show to others will be extended to us at the day of judgment if you are judging other people on the basis of their weaknesses then you will be judged on the same basis if you're looking at other people and many of our weaknesses are right out there for everybody to see and if you are judging someone or if I am judging someone on the B basis of their weaknesses when I come before the Lord do you think that he doesn't see my weaknesses do you think he can't see them he can but if he made the promise judge not that you be not judged and if we can we can look past those weaknesses and look towards that Soul that's there then I can rest assured Lord I looked at the good Lord I tried to get them to you and he can come he will say come on in you're perfect before me the blood of Jesus Christ has washed away your sins but if we judge those we will also be judged and I'm about out of time the musicians can come and we'll finish we'll finish um James at another time brothers and sisters I believe that the Lord has ordained Us in his perfect time to go through this book while we've had these articles coming out this past week wow every single day front page brother Joe sent me a text this morning and said yay it's off the front page you know what I think it's good as I said I think all things work together for the good to them who love God and are called according to his purpose I believe it is it should be a time of reflection not just a time of reflection for for the the the ones that were involved in that maybe the ones that came out of that but for all of us reflect upon Lord am I ashamed of something that I believe and do I not want to tell somebody that part if not why why why could it be that you're wrong I tell you what I want to say everything that I believe if somebody calls me out and say say well are you are you saying as I said at the beginning are you saying that you can't go to heaven without Jesus Christ yes I am saying that sorry it's an exclusive gospel I am saying that absolutely are you saying that that um transgender and and all of these these different things that we see today are you saying that's wrong yes I am saying that it is a sin are you saying lying's wrong yeah if I neglect any of the law then you can be condemned by any sin as I said just showing favoritism James the pastor of the church said here just showing favoritism you will be guilty of sin and it's the truth but I thank the Lord as I said I do want to brag on on our church and I am thankful it's not something that we so much struggle with we struggle with other things but this James the first part of James chapter 2 I think we're excelling I want to continue that and um as I said brother Josiah as I said that as I said before if you have any questions it's my job ask and I'll be quick I'll be I'll I might not be quick to answer but I'll I'll answer the best that I know how and and I am I'm very disappointed I'm very disappointed on both sides it's like you're trying to hide the way you believe trying to hide that there is division you're trying to hide that because you believe this way that you're cutting out these people over here you're trying to hide the fact that that um you excommunicate people or you kick them out it's wrong there is a place for it but not just because you don't you don't believe the same the same way or or you don't you don't believe a certain thing is sin no there there's there's no reason for that so brothers and sisters I want to encourage encourage you stand strong with the book stand strong with the word of God because it won't forsake you it'll be there for you and don't judge according to James chapter 2 don't judge by appearance because it might be a muham m Gandhi that comes into your into your congregation or into your your circle of friends that may not look right that may not talk right that may not act right but make sure that you are acting right talking right and looking right brother Josiah the way he wants me to live I want to give till there's just no more to give I want to love love till there's just no more love for I could never never ever out love the Lord is that your prayer want to live the way he wants me to live I want to give until there's just no more to give I want to love love till there's just no more love I could never never out love the Lord I want to live the way he wants me to live I want to give until there's just no more to give I want to love love till there's just no more love for I could never never out love the Lord before we close I also want to point out the mistake that sister Shirley made and saying look at all these judgmental people like they were all looking at her and probably no one noticed her she was there and that was the wrong attitude to have so many of you brothers and sisters that come don't think because you look at a certain way that people are judging you don't you judge someone because you think someone is judging you judge not that you be not judged also counts for the one that's saying don't judge me you understand let's make it about Jesus you know brothers and sisters I just can't I can't get away of how great he is and how much wisdom he has to have this Hindu man mahat mandhi read these gospels and study on Christan Christianity and say wow this man was right this man he had the truth he had the way to live Jesus lived the life and he preached the gospel and he taught us how to live and he said if you love me keep my Commandments do these things that I teach you and then we'll see the benefits from it let's all stand Jesus at the center of it all Jesus at the center of it all from beginning to the end from beginning to the end it will always be it's always been you Jesus oh Jesus
