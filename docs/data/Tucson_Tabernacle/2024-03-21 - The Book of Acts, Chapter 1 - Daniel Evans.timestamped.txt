[34:26] first uh
[34:28] I want to make a couple announcements
[34:30] um I sent it out on the WhatsApp that
[34:34] um brother Lyle and sister Heather are
[34:37] shooting to for the target of having our
[34:40] next our first Sunday school class next
[34:44] Sunday now that's tentative and they're
[34:47] going to do their best and we have some
[34:49] cleaning that we have some to do
[34:50] upstairs to get rid of some of the
[34:53] furniture and getting stuff tidied up
[34:55] and ready
[34:58] April 2nd thank you brother while
[35:01] April 2nd will be um the Lord's willing
[35:04] will be our first
[35:05] Sunday school class on Sunday
[35:09] we have
[35:10] a brother that I just think the world of
[35:12] and we've had him speak here before his
[35:14] brother Eleazar Castillo from Jericho
[35:17] Tabernacle in Phoenix he's going to be
[35:19] preaching for us on Sunday morning
[35:22] I really think a lot of him he's got a
[35:26] really tremendous testimony I hope I can
[35:29] pull on him to give his testimony of his
[35:31] wife and and how that they went through
[35:34] some health problems and he moved from
[35:36] Silver City New Mexico to Phoenix
[35:40] um and he's just a young man he's just
[35:41] like 31 years old
[35:43] he's been through a lot and he's just
[35:46] got a wonderful gift in his life he's
[35:48] been a blessing to me his family's been
[35:50] a blessing to me and I know he's going
[35:52] to be a blessing to us again this Sunday
[35:55] um I haven't got enough nerve yet to
[35:59] take up an offering on Sunday morning
[36:01] but I know that we need to and I'm
[36:05] I'm just praying about when the right
[36:07] time to do that is we need to get new
[36:10] the new bags that we have to take up the
[36:12] offering in brother Branham said and I
[36:16] believe that giving is part of worship
[36:19] and it doesn't matter how much I mean
[36:22] you look at Jesus and and he looked at
[36:25] that little Widow
[36:26] and she she went in there and she she
[36:29] got
[36:31] I believe it was two mites to to give to
[36:34] the offering and Jesus said who has
[36:36] given more her or the rich man
[36:40] so we know that it's not how much
[36:45] but it's the generosity that we have
[36:47] with with what we've been given
[36:50] and I really do I think it's important
[36:52] that we make a way for
[36:54] the people to
[36:56] um to give
[36:57] and to take up that offering and
[36:59] something that's been around for a long
[37:01] time
[37:03] so
[37:04] I'll uh
[37:05] I'm trying to get up my nerve but it
[37:07] won't be it won't be this weekend
[37:10] um
[37:11] I want to talk about
[37:13] this book
[37:16] this letter
[37:18] this document called the book of Acts in
[37:21] the Bible
[37:22] it's um
[37:24] in my opinion in all of the Bible
[37:28] this book of Acts
[37:30] manifests Jesus Christ and his plan more
[37:35] than any other it really is it does seem
[37:38] to me to be a Capstone of
[37:42] um Jesus's Ministry
[37:45] it starts the book of Acts is a
[37:49] it starts at the beginning as we'll talk
[37:52] about today it it starts with the
[37:55] Believers being together in one mind and
[37:59] in one Accord and that that word one
[38:04] Accord with with one purpose
[38:06] they had one purpose in their lives and
[38:10] when we can get a group of people that
[38:12] are focused on one purpose then we can
[38:15] do great things
[38:16] but if we're all focused on on ourselves
[38:19] and our in our lives and our days that's
[38:22] that's when we won't accomplish much is
[38:25] when we're doing that
[38:26] so we see this book of Acts it starts in
[38:29] the city of Jerusalem
[38:31] starts with 120 people in the upper room
[38:34] and and then the first I think about 12
[38:37] chapters
[38:38] are Ministry mainly to the Jewish people
[38:43] and it's it's the ministry Peter is the
[38:47] main subject of the first part of the
[38:49] book of Acts and Peter preaches many
[38:51] different sermons in there which the
[38:53] Lord's will and will get to and it's
[38:56] mainly there are some like Cornelius and
[38:59] different ones there are some Gentiles
[39:00] mixed in there but it's mainly to the
[39:03] Jews
[39:04] there was he was building a group of
[39:07] people and and it was spreading
[39:10] thousands of people started coming
[39:12] turning from the old Jewish ways to
[39:15] following the doctrines and the the uh
[39:19] religion of this man Jesus
[39:22] and it goes on and then around
[39:25] I think it's around the 22nd chapter or
[39:29] so we see
[39:31] the the a change happen
[39:34] and this man Paul comes on the scene
[39:39] and then it goes from the Jews it starts
[39:43] spreading among all of the Gentiles and
[39:45] it starts spreading not just in Israel
[39:48] but it starts spreading all throughout
[39:51] that part of the world
[39:52] and then it goes on and it ends
[39:56] with Paul being tried
[40:00] before Caesar
[40:02] and
[40:04] if brother branham's message
[40:07] that we all hold so dear to our hearts
[40:10] if the ultimate goal of the message of
[40:14] Malachi 4 is to turn the heart of the
[40:18] children back to that of the Pentecostal
[40:21] fathers it is back to this book of Acts
[40:25] then I think that we should very well
[40:28] know what this book of Acts is about
[40:31] this this acts we quoted so much Acts
[40:34] chapter 2 where we see we see the the
[40:36] day of Pentecost there and we see
[40:38] baptism if our hearts are to be turned
[40:41] back to that it's very important
[40:44] to understand not just the highlights
[40:48] but I would like us to understand the
[40:50] entire book
[40:52] from the author who wrote it
[40:56] down to the sermons that were preached
[41:00] and all the way to even who was the
[41:04] recipient of the first book of Acts why
[41:08] was it even written
[41:10] let's turn to Acts
[41:13] chapter 1
[41:16] and you'll see a theme as we go through
[41:19] this entire the entire book of Acts that
[41:24] this is a continuation of Jesus's
[41:27] Ministry it is not the ministry so much
[41:31] of the disciples it is Jesus
[41:34] his ministry spread abroad
[41:39] starts like this
[41:41] the former treaties have I made o
[41:44] Theophilus of all that Jesus began both
[41:49] to do and teach
[41:52] now as I've said before don't just read
[41:55] over a scripture if you don't understand
[41:57] it
[41:58] when you come as you're reading as you
[42:01] come to a scripture you're not just
[42:03] doing it to memorize it doesn't do you
[42:04] any good if you just memorize it what
[42:07] does good is if you understand it
[42:10] so
[42:11] in another translation it says in this
[42:14] first book o Theophilus I have dealt
[42:17] with all that Jesus began to do and to
[42:21] teach so who is this man theopolis
[42:24] have you ever wondered
[42:26] who this guy was this book of Acts was
[42:29] written to him
[42:31] so is so who is he as I was searching
[42:35] who this man was I found that
[42:37] his name as far as I could find means
[42:41] god lover
[42:43] so this man seems to be a great man he
[42:45] loved God
[42:47] and since the book the book of Acts ends
[42:50] with Paul awaiting trial
[42:54] it's suggested
[42:57] that maybe this book of Acts
[43:01] was written as a testimony
[43:05] for Paul in his trial
[43:08] that is one thought behind this book of
[43:11] Acts I don't necessarily think that that
[43:13] was it
[43:14] and then another thought
[43:17] about this man theopolis is he paid this
[43:21] author
[43:23] to research
[43:25] all that was going on with with Peter
[43:28] and and Paul and all of this and he paid
[43:32] him and he this was the report that was
[43:34] brought back to this theopolis
[43:38] that one is a little bit more believable
[43:41] but then another school of thought which
[43:44] is I think probably what it is is this
[43:47] man theopolis was a very important
[43:50] person maybe a powerful person and
[43:53] whoever wrote This Book of Acts was
[43:56] reporting back to him all that he saw
[44:00] and all the research that he made
[44:03] now
[44:04] as we go on I think that you will see
[44:08] that that is probably what's going on
[44:13] in verse 1 it says former treaties
[44:16] now treaties this is Old English
[44:18] that means a book or an essay
[44:21] the former treaties have I made o
[44:23] theopolis of all that Jesus began to do
[44:28] and to teach so the author is saying to
[44:32] this man theopolis that the first book
[44:34] that he wrote to him
[44:38] that all that Jesus began to do and to
[44:42] teach that so there was another book
[44:45] that this author of the book of Acts had
[44:48] already written to this man theopolis
[44:51] so it looks like looks like there's two
[44:53] books here and this book of Acts is the
[44:55] second book
[44:58] verse number two until the day in which
[45:02] he was taken up after that
[45:05] he after that he through the Holy Ghost
[45:08] had given Commandments unto the apostles
[45:11] whom he had chosen
[45:13] so so the book that was written earlier
[45:17] ended at the day that Jesus went up
[45:21] after he had rose from the dead and he
[45:24] had given instructions to the disciples
[45:26] and then he went up so this author of
[45:29] this book is saying to this man
[45:31] theopolis he's saying that was the first
[45:34] book that I wrote you that was the first
[45:36] letter that I wrote you and this book of
[45:38] Acts is the second letter
[45:41] and notice here
[45:44] until the day in which he was taken up
[45:47] after that he through the Holy Ghost had
[45:50] given Commandments unto the apostles
[45:54] whom he had chosen
[45:56] who are those Apostles we all know who
[45:58] they are
[45:59] but why are they now called Apostles and
[46:02] not disciples
[46:04] they're very different words
[46:07] a disciple
[46:09] is someone who is learning and sitting
[46:12] under the ministry of someone else
[46:16] when I was going to school
[46:18] I was in college I was learning let's
[46:21] say the the hydrologic cycle how how you
[46:24] have you have the ocean out there and
[46:26] and you have water that evaporates and
[46:28] comes up out of the ocean and the wind
[46:31] blows it into land and and as it blows
[46:35] maybe the pressure decreases and and the
[46:38] the forces of physics draw these water
[46:42] droplets to each other and they come
[46:44] together and and as they're up there and
[46:47] the pressure changes they continue to to
[46:51] gather together and then once they
[46:53] gather together then forces of gravity
[46:55] are pulling them down then the the water
[46:57] comes down as rain it hits the ground
[47:00] and it and it gathers with other drops
[47:03] and it starts to form a river that flows
[47:06] Downstream and we have the laws of
[47:09] momentum and physics and it and as it
[47:11] goes down and it gets bigger it it
[47:13] creates energy and it's able to pick up
[47:15] the the sediment and I'm studying all
[47:17] this and I'm learning all this and
[47:18] school and I'm learning the physics and
[47:21] all the different things associated with
[47:22] all of this and the water flows down and
[47:25] then it carries all the sediment and
[47:27] goes into the ocean it it slows down and
[47:30] it drops its load and it forms sand and
[47:33] we form sandy beaches and all and all of
[47:35] that and all the physics and everything
[47:36] that I learned in college and then once
[47:40] I graduated then I went into
[47:43] the actual field of study
[47:46] and I took what I learned like sister
[47:50] Holly what you learned in nursing school
[47:52] you took what you learned and then you
[47:56] applied it
[47:57] so you became you went from being a
[48:00] disciple of your professor
[48:04] into being an apostle of the work
[48:09] so once I had learned how to do all of
[48:12] this then I took it and I began to apply
[48:15] it to to better
[48:18] the community are better the scientific
[48:21] community
[48:22] and and to make to to make roads down to
[48:26] do things
[48:27] and that's the same thing that these
[48:29] disciples did and you'll see now in the
[48:31] book of Acts are no longer called
[48:33] Disciples
[48:34] they're called apostles
[48:36] so something is changing right here
[48:40] in their new role
[48:43] so and the same goes when
[48:46] I became a minister of the Gospel all of
[48:50] these years since I was a baby
[48:53] of listening
[48:54] to the sermons
[48:56] of going to church of reading my Bible
[49:00] and studying and all that time that that
[49:04] I studied the word
[49:07] there became a Time
[49:09] that now I took what I had studied and
[49:14] then I began to apply it
[49:16] don't stay in the just studying role no
[49:22] one stayed there
[49:24] take what you have learned and then put
[49:27] it into action that is the apostolic
[49:31] Doctrine those Apostolic fathers that's
[49:34] the way that our hearts are to turn back
[49:36] to that back to working
[49:40] so who is the author
[49:44] of this second book we have a first book
[49:48] that he refers to he says the former
[49:49] treaties the former book that I wrote
[49:52] you
[49:53] and it does these things now here is the
[49:57] second book that I'm writing you and
[50:00] this second book is the book of Acts
[50:03] and as always we can find our answer in
[50:07] the word and it's a very very simple
[50:09] answer
[50:10] let's turn to Luke chapter one
[50:14] and we're going to find out who the
[50:15] author of This Book of Acts is
[50:20] verse 1.
[50:24] for as much
[50:26] as many have taken in hand to set forth
[50:29] an order of Declaration of these things
[50:31] those things which are most surely
[50:33] believed among us even as they delivered
[50:36] them unto us which from the beginning
[50:38] were eyewitnesses and Ministers of the
[50:42] word now now
[50:45] Luke here is saying hey I did research
[50:48] on this
[50:49] Luke wasn't there with Jesus but Luke
[50:53] undertook this great effort to interview
[50:57] and he's talking right here even as they
[51:01] delivered them to us as these people
[51:03] told us
[51:05] and I put this together in this book
[51:08] Not only was this book of Luke was it
[51:11] inspired but it is also the result of a
[51:15] lot of work and a lot of research by
[51:18] this man Luke who is also a doctor
[51:22] it's a masterpiece and it's not only
[51:24] inspiration
[51:25] it's a result of a whole lot of effort
[51:31] now we're going to answer
[51:35] who the author of This Book of Acts is
[51:38] it seemed good to me also
[51:41] having had a perfect understanding of
[51:43] all things from the very first to write
[51:45] unto thee in order most excellent
[51:48] Theophilus
[51:51] here is the first book of the author of
[51:55] the book of Acts it's called The Book of
[51:57] Luke
[51:59] so the author of the book of Acts is
[52:03] Luke
[52:07] and another thing with this theopolis
[52:10] this word most excellent theopolis
[52:14] back then it was reserved for someone of
[52:17] great stature or a very powerful man or
[52:21] someone that maybe was was a very rich
[52:25] person someone that had a lot of
[52:27] influence so we look whoever this
[52:30] theopolis is was a great man powerful
[52:34] man
[52:36] now let's go back to the book of Acts so
[52:39] now we know
[52:41] who is writing these things we know that
[52:44] the Book of Luke from the very
[52:46] introduction The Book of Luke is
[52:49] research and study and interviewing I
[52:53] bet she interviewed John and Matthew
[52:56] and I bet you he interviewed maybe Mary
[52:59] and and Joseph of Arimathea maybe he
[53:03] interviewed these people and he put
[53:04] together this masterpiece called The
[53:06] Book of Luke and he even said that I had
[53:08] an excellent understanding of these
[53:10] things
[53:12] back to the book of Acts
[53:17] verse 3.
[53:20] speaking of the Lord Jesus
[53:23] he said to whom also he showed himself
[53:25] alive after his passion I've heard of
[53:28] The Passion of Christ
[53:29] it's a crucifixion
[53:31] of the Lord Jesus
[53:34] by many infallible infallible proofs
[53:36] being seen of them 40 days and speaking
[53:39] of the things pertaining to the kingdom
[53:41] of God
[53:42] and being assembled together with them
[53:45] commanded them that they should not
[53:47] depart from Jerusalem but wait for the
[53:49] promise of the Father which saith thee
[53:52] you have heard of me
[53:54] for truly Baptist John Baptist for John
[53:57] truly baptized with water
[53:59] but ye shall be baptized with the Holy
[54:01] Ghost many days since
[54:03] and when they therefore will come
[54:05] together they asked of them saying Lord
[54:09] will thou at this time restore again
[54:11] the kingdom of Kingdom to Israel and he
[54:14] said unto them for it is not for you to
[54:18] know the times or the season which the
[54:20] father hath put in his own power but ye
[54:23] shall receive power after that the Holy
[54:25] Ghost has come upon you and ye shall be
[54:28] Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and
[54:31] in all Judea and in Samaria and unto the
[54:34] uttermost parts of the Earth
[54:37] so here we have Luke and he's he's he's
[54:40] quoting back
[54:42] to the to the original research that he
[54:44] had done
[54:46] through his book and in the Book of
[54:47] Matthew and I believe is the Book of
[54:49] John
[54:50] and this right here is the entire theme
[54:54] of the book of Acts which I'll read
[54:56] verse 8 again but ye shall receive power
[55:01] after that the Holy Ghost has come upon
[55:04] you and ye shall be Witnesses unto me
[55:07] both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and
[55:10] in Samaria and unto the uttermost parts
[55:14] of the Earth
[55:16] now this just happened a few weeks or
[55:19] not too long
[55:21] before this day of Pentecost that Jesus
[55:25] had told them go out into all the world
[55:27] preach the Gospel Matthew 28 he says
[55:32] baptizing them in the name of the father
[55:34] and of the son and of the Holy Ghost he
[55:36] says go and and lay your hands on the
[55:39] sick and they shall recover and he's he
[55:41] in The Book of Mark and he's telling
[55:43] them all all of these things
[55:45] and then this book of Acts is the
[55:48] Fulfillment of what Jesus had told them
[55:54] and I have
[55:56] yeah Luke Luke 24 46 I'll read it
[56:00] quickly and he said unto them this is
[56:01] Jesus talking and he said unto them thus
[56:04] it is written and thus it behooveth
[56:06] Christ to suffer and to rise from the
[56:08] dead the third day
[56:10] that repentance and remission of sins
[56:12] should be preached in his name among all
[56:16] nations beginning at Jerusalem
[56:21] this is how Jesus himself laid the
[56:23] foundation for the book of Acts
[56:25] in this which is when I say the book of
[56:29] Acts it's the acts of the Holy Spirit
[56:32] working through the disciples
[56:35] 24 48 says Luke 24 48 says and ye are
[56:39] witnesses of these things and behold I
[56:42] send the promise of my father upon you
[56:44] but Tara ye in the city of Jerusalem
[56:47] until ye be endued with power from on
[56:50] high
[56:52] Jesus himself
[56:54] instructed the disciples to do these
[56:57] things and now we see them
[57:01] together
[57:02] and here is Luke and he's recounting
[57:05] this
[57:06] and in verse 9 in Acts chapter 1 verse 9
[57:09] he says this
[57:11] and when he had spoken these things
[57:12] speaking of Jesus when he had spoken
[57:15] these things while they beheld he was
[57:17] taken up and a cloud received him out of
[57:20] their sight
[57:21] and while they look steadfastly towards
[57:23] heaven as he went up behold two men
[57:26] stood by them in white apparel
[57:28] which also said you mean of Galilee why
[57:31] stanji gazing up into heaven the same
[57:35] Jesus which is taken up from you into
[57:38] heaven shall
[57:40] so come in a like manner as you have
[57:43] seen him go into heaven
[57:47] and Jesus had instructed
[57:50] that they would go to Jerusalem
[57:54] and that they would tarry in this place
[57:59] and
[58:00] I can imagine
[58:03] the different
[58:04] emotions in the disciples at this time
[58:08] so they had just seen the man that they
[58:11] thought that was the Messiah
[58:13] they had just seen him be crucified
[58:18] and all was lost
[58:21] and they were scared to death and they
[58:24] they ran around like scared rabbits
[58:26] trying to get away and then
[58:29] three days later after Jesus had died he
[58:33] comes back to them
[58:35] shows him the hole in his side
[58:38] and
[58:39] tell and they see that whoa he is the
[58:42] messiah
[58:43] and then there was a brother and I know
[58:46] that he gets he gets criticized a lot
[58:48] but I'm gonna stick up for him on this
[58:51] this one his name was Thomas
[58:54] and Thomas I know he's no doubting
[58:56] Thomas and we we say all these things
[58:58] but Thomas
[58:59] came he he said I'm not going to believe
[59:01] that Jesus is even I'm not going to
[59:03] believe that he's come or anything it's
[59:04] just too much for me he says I won't
[59:06] believe it until I stick my hand in the
[59:08] hole of his side and put my finger in
[59:10] the holes in his hands
[59:12] so Jesus comes to him
[59:15] and imagine how Thomas felt
[59:18] oh
[59:21] can you imagine how happy he was
[59:23] didn't believe it just it couldn't
[59:26] accept it it was all wrong it was all
[59:28] lost and Jesus was just a prophet and
[59:31] and all of these things he wasn't the
[59:33] Messiah and how could I been so wrong
[59:34] and then to see the man
[59:36] walk up to him say Thomas come here
[59:40] he says put your hand right here
[59:42] he says put your hand
[59:44] in these holes put your finger in these
[59:46] holes in my hand
[59:48] Thomas
[59:50] probably looked at him like oh and he
[59:53] said one of the greatest things anyone
[59:57] has ever said in the Bible it was the
[1:00:01] greatest revelation of the godhead of
[1:00:05] anyone that has ever spoken a word there
[1:00:09] is this Thomas that doubted that did all
[1:00:11] these things he said this made it plain
[1:00:14] for us all to read he said my Lord and
[1:00:18] my God
[1:00:20] Jesus you are God Jesus didn't correct
[1:00:22] him
[1:00:23] you are God thank God for Thomas
[1:00:27] and thank God that that was recorded
[1:00:32] imagine the mixed emotions
[1:00:36] and
[1:00:39] Luke as he's recounting this
[1:00:42] and I know Luke said it he talked to
[1:00:45] them
[1:00:47] he witnessed these people in person
[1:00:50] you know I give testimonies of brother
[1:00:53] Branham I give testimonies that my dad
[1:00:56] has told me or my grandpa told me or my
[1:00:58] grandma or my mom told me and and they
[1:01:01] were with brother Branham and I give
[1:01:03] these I give these testimonies that's
[1:01:05] exactly what Luke did
[1:01:08] Luke went to these people that were his
[1:01:10] disciples
[1:01:12] and he talked with them and he wrote
[1:01:14] down what they said
[1:01:17] and Luke is a master writer you'll read
[1:01:23] through as we read through acts and
[1:01:25] we'll we'll get to these later on Luke
[1:01:28] gives you even gives you little hints
[1:01:31] of when he was actually there with Paul
[1:01:34] and when he wasn't
[1:01:37] it's the it's the coolest thing he'll
[1:01:40] he'll be talking he'll be saying and
[1:01:41] they went and and Paul went to Macedonia
[1:01:44] and they went here and they went here
[1:01:45] and then we went
[1:01:50] speaking in first person so it's like oh
[1:01:52] he was there he wasn't somebody wasn't
[1:01:56] telling him this he was actually there
[1:01:58] and he saw these things this wasn't a
[1:02:00] testimony it was all true obviously
[1:02:03] but I just like the way that that Luke
[1:02:06] writes and he just he throws it in there
[1:02:08] to just make it so much more real
[1:02:12] verse number 12.
[1:02:14] then return they unto Jerusalem from the
[1:02:17] mount called Olivet which is from
[1:02:20] Jerusalem a Sabbath Day's Journey
[1:02:22] and when they had come in they went up
[1:02:25] into an upper room where Abode both
[1:02:27] Peter and James and John and Andrew
[1:02:30] Philip Thomas Bartholomew and Matthew
[1:02:33] James the son of the son of alphaeus
[1:02:36] Simon zealotis and Judas the brother of
[1:02:39] James
[1:02:41] these all continued with one Accord in
[1:02:45] prayer and supplication
[1:02:47] with women
[1:02:49] and Mary the mother of Jesus and with
[1:02:52] his Brethren notice for some reason it's
[1:02:55] important to brother Luke that he says
[1:02:57] oh and by the way there were women there
[1:02:59] too
[1:03:00] they had a place in this work
[1:03:03] and Luke it was important to Luke and
[1:03:06] you even see it in his gospel
[1:03:08] in his first letter that Luke includes
[1:03:12] the sisters probably more than any of
[1:03:14] the other ones do
[1:03:16] and I just I like that that he says oh
[1:03:19] and with the women
[1:03:21] also they were there too
[1:03:23] and in those days Peter stood up in the
[1:03:26] midst of his disciples of the disciples
[1:03:28] and said the number of the names
[1:03:30] together were about 120.
[1:03:33] men and brethren
[1:03:35] this scripture must needs to have been
[1:03:38] fulfilled which the Holy Ghost by the
[1:03:40] mouth of David spake before concerning
[1:03:42] Judas which was the guide that took them
[1:03:46] to Jesus look at Peter he had studied
[1:03:50] the word
[1:03:52] he was no longer
[1:03:55] this student as I was talking about
[1:03:58] myself and studying physics and
[1:04:00] chemistry and all that now Peter instead
[1:04:03] of being the disciple instead of being
[1:04:06] the student Peter now was putting what
[1:04:09] he had learned into action and he was
[1:04:12] taking the psalm
[1:04:14] and he was applying it to this
[1:04:19] he knew the scriptures
[1:04:23] now Peter says this for he was numbered
[1:04:25] with us speaking of Judas and had
[1:04:27] obtained part of this ministry
[1:04:30] now when this man purchased a field with
[1:04:32] the reward of iniquity and falling
[1:04:35] headlong he burst asunder in the midst
[1:04:37] and all his bowels gushed out
[1:04:40] and that sounds gross I'm gonna
[1:04:43] talk a little bit about it here in a
[1:04:45] second and it was known unto all the
[1:04:47] Dwellers of Jerusalem in so much as that
[1:04:49] field is called in their proper tongue
[1:04:51] akeldama that is to say the field of
[1:04:55] blood
[1:04:56] now brother Lyle you probably know this
[1:04:59] a lot better and this may just be a
[1:05:00] legend
[1:05:01] but I was in Jerusalem I don't know
[1:05:04] um
[1:05:05] maybe four or five years ago
[1:05:07] and
[1:05:09] I was uh
[1:05:11] I went up to the top of the Mount of
[1:05:14] Olives
[1:05:15] and I looked
[1:05:17] out across the valley and there was a
[1:05:20] ridge that went out I don't know a few
[1:05:23] miles away and that was the city of
[1:05:25] Bethlehem
[1:05:27] and and as I'm looking out there this
[1:05:31] taxi driver who had befriended days
[1:05:33] earlier and our paths just kept Crossing
[1:05:37] he comes up and he says Daniel
[1:05:39] and I was like oh hey and I forgot his
[1:05:41] name but he uh he he walked up to me and
[1:05:45] he says he says oh you're looking and he
[1:05:47] says do you know what you're looking at
[1:05:49] and down across the valley there you
[1:05:52] know it's very populated there's there's
[1:05:54] all these buildings and and structures
[1:05:56] and homes and everything and and there's
[1:05:58] there's this big open Valley and then
[1:06:00] there's this field
[1:06:02] out there that's just barren
[1:06:05] it had nothing there was like a couple
[1:06:07] Trails through it and then the houses
[1:06:09] were up on the up on the hill
[1:06:12] and this Taxi Driver told me
[1:06:15] he says that place
[1:06:19] is where Judas was hung himself
[1:06:23] but I don't know if that's a fact
[1:06:25] I don't know if it's a rumor I don't
[1:06:27] know if if it is a um if it's a legend
[1:06:31] but even this man had respect to that
[1:06:35] and he said how he purchased this field
[1:06:38] and we know that story of about Judas
[1:06:41] and how he tried to give the money back
[1:06:43] and he couldn't give it back and somehow
[1:06:45] this field was purchased to bury people
[1:06:47] in
[1:06:48] and he ended up hanging himself
[1:06:52] and as I assume as his body decayed all
[1:06:55] of this stuff happened
[1:06:58] and then Peter goes on and he says for
[1:07:01] it is written in the Book of Psalms
[1:07:03] let his habitation be desolate
[1:07:05] and let no man dwell therein and let his
[1:07:08] Bishop let another man take
[1:07:11] wherefore of these men which have
[1:07:14] accompanied with us all the time that
[1:07:17] the Lord Jesus went in and out Among Us
[1:07:19] beginning from the baptism of John unto
[1:07:22] the same day that he was taken up from
[1:07:24] us
[1:07:26] must one be ordained to be a witness
[1:07:29] with us of this Resurrection now Peter
[1:07:32] here is talking about he says we are
[1:07:34] originally 12.
[1:07:37] Peter knew the significance of of 12 he
[1:07:40] knew that there were 12 tribes
[1:07:43] of Israel there were 12 sons of of
[1:07:46] Israel Jacob
[1:07:48] and Jesus had told had chosen 12 of
[1:07:53] these men
[1:07:54] and Peter
[1:07:57] by Revelation and by understanding of
[1:08:00] the scripture knew how important knew
[1:08:03] that 11 was incomplete
[1:08:07] so Peter knew
[1:08:09] that for these promises of the Lord to
[1:08:13] come to pass
[1:08:14] that they had to be 12.
[1:08:18] and
[1:08:20] we can pause for a minute
[1:08:23] and think about our lives
[1:08:26] and think about the plan that God has
[1:08:28] for all of our lives
[1:08:30] and to think that if there is something
[1:08:33] that we maybe have left undone
[1:08:37] something that that maybe that that is a
[1:08:41] sin that's in our lives or something
[1:08:42] that that we knew we should have done or
[1:08:45] that we know that we should do now and
[1:08:47] we leave it undone
[1:08:50] it's like 11 disciples and not 12.
[1:08:55] and how can God work
[1:08:59] how could his plan come to pass
[1:09:03] if we are not complete
[1:09:05] if we have not done all that we are
[1:09:09] required to do
[1:09:10] Peter understood that Peter had that
[1:09:14] Revelation there needs to be 12 of us
[1:09:19] so
[1:09:21] Peter preached this sermon that I was
[1:09:23] just reading
[1:09:26] and they took steps
[1:09:30] to make their group complete according
[1:09:35] to the scriptures
[1:09:36] now if you know brother Brown's message
[1:09:39] very well which I'm sure you all do
[1:09:41] you'll know that brother Branham talked
[1:09:44] about this man Matthias and he says well
[1:09:46] he never really amounted to anything
[1:09:49] but let me also read something brother
[1:09:51] Branham said
[1:09:53] I didn't give you the quote brother but
[1:09:55] this is from 620601 taking sides with
[1:09:58] Jesus
[1:09:59] now at the beginning the church was
[1:10:01] inaugurated at Pentecost and there the
[1:10:05] Holy Spirit fell upon them where Jesus
[1:10:07] had chosen twelve
[1:10:09] and one of them had fallen and they had
[1:10:12] chose Matthias to take his place and the
[1:10:16] Holy Spirit waited until all this was in
[1:10:19] order before it came
[1:10:22] they had to choose one to take the
[1:10:26] bishopric of Judas that fell by
[1:10:29] transgression to fulfill the scripture
[1:10:34] Paul wasn't on the scene at this time he
[1:10:37] was still probably in the synagogue
[1:10:39] studying to be in studying in the
[1:10:41] Sanhedrin Council maybe to be high
[1:10:43] priest one day
[1:10:44] Paul wasn't there
[1:10:46] but they had this very good man Matthias
[1:10:50] and they had this other man and I'll
[1:10:52] read the scripture here in a minute and
[1:10:54] Peter knowing that there was something
[1:10:56] incomplete
[1:10:58] there's something incomplete maybe in my
[1:11:02] life
[1:11:03] that I need to make right or to stop
[1:11:06] doing or to start doing
[1:11:08] and I look at myself so often
[1:11:11] many times that it's like Lord like I
[1:11:15] gave the testimony of of the man outside
[1:11:19] I believe his name is Alex the homeless
[1:11:21] man
[1:11:22] and
[1:11:24] and I was talking with him before
[1:11:25] service on Sunday night
[1:11:28] and he walked over here and and I went
[1:11:31] and I asked him if I could pray for him
[1:11:33] and I prayed for him and then I began to
[1:11:35] walk away
[1:11:37] and as I was walking away I had my back
[1:11:40] to him
[1:11:42] and as I was walking away
[1:11:44] he said
[1:11:46] will you pray that God forgives me of
[1:11:48] what I've done
[1:11:50] and it just broke my heart
[1:11:54] and I actually went back to him honey
[1:11:56] when I was telling you the testimony I
[1:11:57] forgot to tell you this part I actually
[1:11:59] went back to him and I said he has
[1:12:04] forgiven you
[1:12:06] that's the most that's that's why we're
[1:12:09] in church he has forgiven you but you
[1:12:12] have to accept that
[1:12:14] and I look and and now that as I'm
[1:12:17] reading these scriptures here in the
[1:12:19] congregation I'm reading what Peter this
[1:12:21] this understanding that Peter had that
[1:12:23] there were 11 and we needed 12 this man
[1:12:27] you need to accept the fact that you are
[1:12:31] forgiven
[1:12:33] or else it's incomplete
[1:12:35] and God can't do it
[1:12:39] until his perfect way is set forward
[1:12:44] which is repentance
[1:12:46] and then accepting this man Christ
[1:12:49] and that's why you see when we have
[1:12:51] baptisms that is what baptism symbolizes
[1:12:54] it symbolizes that I accept this man
[1:12:58] Jesus Christ
[1:13:00] just like uh it was Philip out with the
[1:13:03] eunuch and he was testifying and and the
[1:13:06] eunuch understood that Isaiah was
[1:13:09] speaking about Jesus and that Jesus had
[1:13:12] come and and this is the beginning of
[1:13:14] the book of Acts this isn't yet until
[1:13:16] when when the when it really started
[1:13:18] going to the Gentiles and Philip asked
[1:13:21] him
[1:13:22] Philip said do you confess that this man
[1:13:28] is Jesus Christ he is the son of God
[1:13:32] he required that confession before
[1:13:36] baptism
[1:13:38] and that is the request that is the
[1:13:39] confession that we have to have before
[1:13:42] baptism so when we have baptism that is
[1:13:45] that is accepting the Lord Jesus you go
[1:13:48] down into the grave like Jesus did you
[1:13:51] come back up with a renewed spirit with
[1:13:54] with an acceptance of the Lord and I
[1:13:57] think about that man and and I don't
[1:13:59] want to get emotional but it broke my
[1:14:02] heart because there was something inside
[1:14:05] of him
[1:14:06] and I did pray for him
[1:14:08] and one day I pray that he's in this
[1:14:11] congregation
[1:14:12] I mean the Lord's done a lot greater
[1:14:14] than that he can do that
[1:14:17] but there was something in that man that
[1:14:20] was left undone
[1:14:22] and so often in us this 11 May It Be is
[1:14:26] incomplete
[1:14:28] if he and when he told me
[1:14:31] I said how did you get like this
[1:14:33] he said well drugs
[1:14:36] like well duh that's what everybody is
[1:14:38] on and I appreciate his honesty
[1:14:41] and I said what do you plan on getting
[1:14:43] off of them and he said this he says
[1:14:45] well yeah eventually
[1:14:46] I could see he didn't want to stop
[1:14:50] that was something that that he liked
[1:14:52] that he required that he wanted was
[1:14:55] those drugs and maybe just maybe that
[1:14:58] would have been completed the process
[1:15:02] is if he would have had a desire to get
[1:15:04] off of the drugs
[1:15:06] and Peter here has this Revelation that
[1:15:09] there is something incomplete and if
[1:15:12] it's incomplete then this Holy Spirit
[1:15:14] cannot come
[1:15:16] that's why it's so important to us as a
[1:15:19] congregation
[1:15:20] we need to make sure everything is
[1:15:23] complete
[1:15:24] and one of us can hinder that one person
[1:15:28] here of The Twelve hindered it is
[1:15:30] missing
[1:15:32] verse number 23.
[1:15:37] and they appointed to
[1:15:39] Joseph called barsabbas who was surnamed
[1:15:41] Justice and Matthias
[1:15:43] and they prayed and said thou Lord which
[1:15:46] knowest the hearts of all men show
[1:15:50] whether of these two thou has chosen
[1:15:55] and he that he may take part of this
[1:15:58] ministry and apostleship
[1:16:01] from which Judas by transgression fell
[1:16:03] that he might go to his own place and
[1:16:07] they gave forth their lots and the lot
[1:16:09] fell upon Matthias and he was numbered
[1:16:12] with the 11 apostles
[1:16:16] now that word giving forth their Lots we
[1:16:19] see in other places it's casting lots
[1:16:21] but a while I've studied that backwards
[1:16:24] and forwards and up and down I still
[1:16:25] can't figure out what it is
[1:16:27] uh in some place it looks like they've
[1:16:30] voted and in this place right here it
[1:16:33] looks like maybe they they cast their
[1:16:35] ballot and they voted for Matthias but
[1:16:38] then in other places when I see cash
[1:16:40] Lots it definitely doesn't mean that
[1:16:43] it means like they were almost throwing
[1:16:45] dice
[1:16:47] so
[1:16:48] it's something that I don't understand
[1:16:51] but
[1:16:53] the Holy Spirit was in it and they chose
[1:16:56] this man Matthias now
[1:17:00] they had everything in place
[1:17:04] they had they had the 12 people
[1:17:08] they had their 12 now apostles
[1:17:13] they had grown up under the ministry
[1:17:17] of the Lord Jesus they had for three and
[1:17:20] a half years they had studied under the
[1:17:22] master I'm not going to get to chapter
[1:17:24] two so if the musicians would come and
[1:17:27] I'll I'll close
[1:17:29] but they had they had studied under the
[1:17:33] Lord Jesus
[1:17:35] they had learned all of this
[1:17:38] and now
[1:17:39] it was time to put it into action now
[1:17:43] they were it was time for them to take
[1:17:46] their place as apostles
[1:17:50] and
[1:17:53] they
[1:17:55] put it in order
[1:17:57] they did as Jesus said they went to this
[1:18:01] place in Jerusalem
[1:18:03] and Jesus said wait there
[1:18:06] don't go anywhere wait
[1:18:09] until you are endued with power from on
[1:18:12] high so they were sitting there and let
[1:18:15] me tell you let me ask you
[1:18:17] Bo Jonathan do you have they had no idea
[1:18:20] what endued with power from an on
[1:18:23] highment
[1:18:24] they couldn't have but Jesus never
[1:18:27] disappoints so they were together they
[1:18:30] had everything in place and like us we
[1:18:33] need to do everything that we can so we
[1:18:36] are not incomplete we need to do
[1:18:38] everything that we can so
[1:18:41] we have we have it all in order for our
[1:18:44] little part
[1:18:45] I'm one of the 12. you're one of the 12.
[1:18:49] but remember that if there's something
[1:18:52] missing in my life sister Shirley it's
[1:18:54] going to hurt you
[1:18:56] and there's if there's something missing
[1:18:57] in your life it's going to hurt me
[1:19:01] and God
[1:19:03] you'll see in this book of Acts as thing
[1:19:05] goes things go on
[1:19:07] that there was this beautiful Unity
[1:19:11] among the people
[1:19:13] and it says in Chapter 2 and we'll read
[1:19:15] it that they were in one Accord
[1:19:20] that they had one purpose and I read
[1:19:24] um that I sent out on the WhatsApp it
[1:19:27] says that they were of one heart and one
[1:19:29] soul
[1:19:30] how would God not bless that
[1:19:35] but this first book of Acts and laying
[1:19:39] the foundation for what's to come we can
[1:19:42] see really Beyond a doubt
[1:19:45] that the author
[1:19:47] is Luke
[1:19:49] and we can see that as he said this is
[1:19:51] my second letter that's first letter
[1:19:54] [Music]
[1:19:55] was his gospel
[1:19:57] that he had put together and it was just
[1:20:01] the Book of Luke is a masterpiece
[1:20:04] he records so many of The Parables Luke
[1:20:09] does and he he makes it just to work
[1:20:13] just to where you can just understand
[1:20:15] things
[1:20:16] I appreciate his efforts I appreciate
[1:20:18] all that he did
[1:20:21] for the Apostle Paul
[1:20:23] and all they did for all of the
[1:20:25] disciples and appreciated his hard work
[1:20:29] I am
[1:20:30] [Music]
[1:20:32] I want us to read
[1:20:34] this book of Acts study it
[1:20:37] because as I said this
[1:20:41] is the gospel
[1:20:44] on display
[1:20:46] this is everything that Jesus taught
[1:20:50] everything that Jesus if you notice it
[1:20:53] says begin to do
[1:20:57] in the Gospel of Luke just goes to the
[1:20:59] end of his life until he's he's he goes
[1:21:02] up to be with the father and it says
[1:21:04] just that he began to do
[1:21:06] he says that was my first letter
[1:21:09] but this second one
[1:21:12] is all that he is doing now with
[1:21:15] Theophilus
[1:21:17] this is the power
[1:21:20] now not in a single man flesh and blood
[1:21:26] named Jesus
[1:21:28] to where you had to be like that that
[1:21:30] little lady that had the bleeding issue
[1:21:33] you had to make your way through the
[1:21:35] crowd and you had to find him and then
[1:21:36] that's him over there and then if I
[1:21:38] could just touch His Garment
[1:21:40] I had to get to the man back then
[1:21:43] but then Jesus promises he says
[1:21:47] that greater things will you do
[1:21:51] than I have done here not the disciples
[1:21:53] could do anything greater but Jesus now
[1:21:56] was not limited to one man in flesh he
[1:22:00] became the spirit and then he went out
[1:22:03] in these apostles
[1:22:05] and it spread throughout the world he
[1:22:08] couldn't do it as one man but that was
[1:22:10] his plan
[1:22:12] was to lay the foundation to teach these
[1:22:16] 11
[1:22:17] disciples
[1:22:19] to to bring them up to teach them in the
[1:22:22] doctrine to show them how to do things
[1:22:23] and then they go out and they change the
[1:22:27] world
[1:22:28] with the same spirit that Jesus had
[1:22:33] so do we understand do we have a good
[1:22:35] foundation for the book of Acts I want
[1:22:38] to continue on I get so excited thinking
[1:22:41] about what's coming
[1:22:43] thinking about I mean this next chapter
[1:22:45] there's going to be like four thousand
[1:22:47] and five thousand all these people
[1:22:49] they're going to receive the Holy Spirit
[1:22:50] they're going to speak with tongues and
[1:22:52] it's going to be in bimba brother
[1:22:56] Jonathan
[1:22:58] it's gonna be in Spanish it's gonna be
[1:23:01] in in in Swahili or whatever it's gonna
[1:23:04] be whatever language they needed to
[1:23:06] speak
[1:23:07] Creole maybe it's gonna be whatever
[1:23:11] language they needed they're gonna speak
[1:23:13] it the power of God is going to be just
[1:23:17] manifested out throughout everyone and
[1:23:20] they're going to start witnessing to
[1:23:22] other people and it's going to start
[1:23:23] going to the Jews and and to the
[1:23:25] different ones and these these Jews are
[1:23:27] going to start spreading it and then
[1:23:29] it's going to hit this man named Paul
[1:23:30] and he's going to go out and he's going
[1:23:32] to bring you to the Gentiles and then
[1:23:34] it's going to just keep going and keep
[1:23:36] going and it never stopped
[1:23:40] that Apostolic day never ended
[1:23:43] it is here today and the same power of
[1:23:47] God that was there with them in this
[1:23:49] book of Acts and we're going to get into
[1:23:51] it and it is great Jesus went to the
[1:23:54] pool of Bethesda and and he healed that
[1:23:56] lame man Peter and John went to the gate
[1:23:59] called beautiful and they did the exact
[1:24:01] same thing because it's not Peter and
[1:24:04] John it's the spirit of Christ and then
[1:24:07] we saw it
[1:24:08] we didn't my parents saw it my
[1:24:12] grandparents thought they saw people
[1:24:15] come up before the platform
[1:24:19] just as ananias and Sapphire which we're
[1:24:21] gonna hear about them in the book of
[1:24:24] Acts where Peter showed the sign of the
[1:24:27] Messiah the sign of the Holy Spirit and
[1:24:29] Peter told them what they had done in
[1:24:30] secret
[1:24:32] we're going to see that in this book of
[1:24:34] Acts and we saw it brother Jonathan
[1:24:35] manifested
[1:24:37] manifested in a man
[1:24:39] showing that that Apostolic age isn't
[1:24:42] finished and now today as we learn in
[1:24:46] this book of Acts we I believe need to
[1:24:49] see it in our own lives all of these
[1:24:52] gifts that we're going to read about
[1:24:54] manifested in this book of Acts we are
[1:24:57] going to see them I believe it I want it
[1:25:00] I want to not not for the gifts but I
[1:25:03] want to see God glorified I want to see
[1:25:06] Jesus return
[1:25:07] and it all started right here
[1:25:10] from this man named Luke and him writing
[1:25:13] this stuff down so that we can read it
[1:25:15] today amen let's stand
[1:25:22] God bless you all
[1:25:24] as I said let's get into this as a
[1:25:27] church
[1:25:27] continue to read

[1:33:29] for the bride of Christ there
[1:33:33] what better way could he have spent his
[1:33:36] life
[1:33:37] than pointing people to the Lord Jesus
[1:33:41] and I know that I'm sure that these
[1:33:43] things are hard brother Jonathan
[1:33:45] mentioned brother Ron he's talking about
[1:33:47] brother Ronnie kapisha
[1:33:49] a wonderful man of God Pastor there in
[1:33:52] Zambia
[1:33:54] and all the family
[1:33:57] I
[1:33:59] I think about
[1:34:01] back to this book of Acts
[1:34:03] [Music]
[1:34:04] and we could accumulate all this wealth
[1:34:07] and we could we could do all
[1:34:09] everything that
[1:34:11] that we want to do in life
[1:34:13] but what good will it do
[1:34:15] at the end
[1:34:17] but this book of Acts here
[1:34:19] there were 12
[1:34:22] disciples
[1:34:24] and women
[1:34:26] as the Apostle Luke said that they
[1:34:29] dedicated their life
[1:34:31] to spreading the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:34:33] and they made a great difference and we
[1:34:35] are here today
[1:34:38] because of what they did
[1:34:40] God bless you all I pray that the Lord
[1:34:43] is with each of you this week
[1:34:45] read this book of Acts and maybe put
[1:34:48] yourself identify with one of these
[1:34:49] characters in here
[1:34:51] and put yourself in that book
[1:34:54] and
[1:34:57] let's be
[1:34:58] one mind one Accord I told you this
[1:35:02] morning that my brother Adam that was
[1:35:05] here and my father-in-law
[1:35:07] thing that they said more than once was
[1:35:11] there is such love in that church
[1:35:14] and wow I don't think that
[1:35:18] I don't think that they could ever pay
[1:35:20] us a better compliment
[1:35:22] than that
[1:35:23] we could have a million people we could
[1:35:25] have a thousand people in this church
[1:35:26] and have the best singers and everything
[1:35:28] else but without love it is all for not
[1:35:32] God bless you all you're dismissed in
[1:35:34] the name of the Lord Jesus think about
[1:35:36] these things think about the acts of the
[1:35:40] Holy Spirit operating in these these
[1:35:42] special people back then and
[1:35:45] it's the same holy spirit that can
[1:35:46] operate in us God bless you all
