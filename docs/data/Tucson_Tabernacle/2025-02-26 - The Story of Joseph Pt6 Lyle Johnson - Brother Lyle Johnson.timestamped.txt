[10:12] at work one of my co co-workers was
[10:15] complaining that she didn't have money
[10:16] to get back
[10:17] home and he
[10:20] said she only had enough for two
[10:23] days
[10:25] and he told her he said he said sister
[10:29] he said I know that God's able to
[10:32] provide and he said I believe that if we
[10:35] just have faith that God will give you
[10:38] what you
[10:39] need and she went to show him that she
[10:42] said look here's how much I have in my
[10:45] account and it was supposed to say zero
[10:47] and it had
[10:48] $30 and and she she said wow now I have
[10:52] enough to get home and I have enough for
[10:55] tonight when we ask God for something
[11:00] it may seem small
[11:03] $30 but you would think well why does
[11:05] she just win the lottery or do something
[11:07] like that God has his own way and he
[11:11] provides what we have need of not not
[11:14] our own desires but he provides what we
[11:17] have need of and he's perfect every

[30:48] pray now that you'd be that you'd
[30:50] continue to be present in this service
[30:52] this evening Lord May the words that are
[30:54] spoken be words that would help and
[30:56] strengthen and encourage us and draw us
[30:58] closer to you and to one another Lord to
[31:01] Bear to bear fruit Lord like that fig
[31:04] tree that the fellow in the orchard said
[31:06] give it give it one more year Lord we
[31:09] just want to bear fruit for you the
[31:10] fruit that you desire Lord we commit
[31:13] this service now and you Lord completely
[31:16] and wholeheartedly in Jesus precious
[31:19] name
[31:22] amen I I'd like to start by reading a
[31:25] short passage from a book to which I
[31:28] very rarely refer now we're in the
[31:31] middle of the story of Joseph a model of
[31:34] Christ in the first book of the Bible
[31:37] Genesis so let's turn to the middle of
[31:40] the last book The revelation of Jesus
[31:43] Christ chapter
[31:51] 12 and I heard a loud voice in heaven
[31:54] saying now is come salvation and
[31:57] strength and the kingdom of our God and
[31:59] the power of His Christ for the accuser
[32:02] of our Brethren is cast down which
[32:05] accused them before our God day and
[32:08] night and they overcame him by the blood
[32:11] of the lamb and by the word of their
[32:14] testimony and they love not their lives
[32:17] unto the
[32:18] death tonight we'll see a parallel and
[32:21] perfect though it may be the Christ type
[32:24] Joseph bringing his power to Bear to
[32:26] bring Salvation and
[32:28] Reconciliation brought about through the
[32:30] word of the testimony of one who
[32:33] overcame prepared to sacrifice his own
[32:35] life by that very
[32:38] testimony another verse from the New
[32:40] Testament comes to mind in a letter Paul
[32:42] wrote to the fledgling Church in galatia
[32:46] Galatians chapter 6 and verse 7 he says
[32:49] be not deceived God is Not mocked
[32:53] whatsoever a man Seth that shall he also
[32:57] reap
[32:58] please be
[33:00] seated thank
[33:02] you last
[33:04] time we saw the brothers leave heon go
[33:08] to Egypt to buy food because of the
[33:10] famine they had to see a Stern
[33:12] forbidding and powerful man named Zapf
[33:16] panea he was their brother Joseph but
[33:18] they didn't recognize him he sent them
[33:21] back to Canaan with grain their money
[33:25] and a warning that they would never see
[33:26] him again and th must never buy more
[33:29] food unless they brought their brother
[33:32] Benjamin he kept Simeon in prison as a
[33:35] hostage until they
[33:38] returned during this time Joseph
[33:40] overheard a conversation between Reuben
[33:42] and his brothers That Shook him to his
[33:45] very core when the brothers returned and
[33:48] reported to Jacob he refused to let
[33:51] Benjamin go to Egypt but they ran out of
[33:54] food the famine continued finally Judah
[33:57] persuaded his dad to send Benjamin and
[34:00] that Judah would take full
[34:03] responsibility for Benjamin's safe
[34:06] return we then explored the path that
[34:09] Judah took to confront his own failures
[34:12] as he became what he hated about his dad
[34:17] in a dramatic turn of events on on the
[34:19] brink of committing an horrific murder
[34:21] of his own daughter-in-law and unborn
[34:23] Sons Judah recognized what he had become
[34:28] he publicly confessed
[34:32] repented his Canaanite daughter-in-law
[34:34] Tamar thus became the matriarch of the
[34:38] royal line of
[34:39] Judah we entered with the brothers
[34:42] including Benjamin preparing to journey
[34:44] to Egypt face the Fearsome Zapf panea
[34:48] and seek to buy more grain from this
[34:51] strange
[34:53] Egyptian let's pick up our story as
[34:55] Jacob sends his sons to Egypt all
[34:58] substitute Joseph's Egyptian names afnaf
[35:00] Pano and Joseph is in that role or that
[35:03] perspective hopefully clarified some
[35:06] things a little
[35:07] bit Jacob is speaking to his sons as
[35:11] they prepare to depart from
[35:15] heon God Almighty give you Mercy before
[35:18] the man that that he may send away your
[35:21] other brother Simeon and
[35:24] Benjamin if I be bered of my children I
[35:28] am
[35:29] bereaved and the men took that present
[35:32] honey and nuts bomb spices myrr and they
[35:36] took double money in their hand and
[35:39] Benjamin and and Rose up and went down
[35:41] to Egypt a week or more traversing a hot
[35:45] unusually dry desert talking among
[35:48] themselves as they journeyed what will
[35:50] he say when we return the money how will
[35:54] we explain it how's Simeon doing is he
[35:57] okay is he he been abused starved
[36:00] beaten will the man believe this is our
[36:03] brother what will we do if he doesn't or
[36:06] says we stole the money what will happen
[36:10] if he refuses to release Simeon or
[36:13] detains
[36:14] Benjamin what is God doing to us and
[36:18] they stood before Joseph they were
[36:20] awaiting an audience with Zapf
[36:24] pan uh I recognize this map isn't great
[36:27] but it it shows the direct route from
[36:30] from Hebron where they live this will be
[36:33] the direct route down to arrival in the
[36:36] Goan area of Egypt and on down to where
[36:39] Joseph most likely is there's also a sea
[36:42] route this is the the route that they
[36:44] took him into slavery maybe they came
[36:46] down this way and over we don't really
[36:48] know they had to have water for the
[36:50] animals and it's been a time of famine
[36:52] there has to been a lot of rain the
[36:55] oases maybe not such good shape and
[36:58] carrying water is heavy and it reduces
[37:01] the amount of grain that you can carry
[37:03] back if you've got to carry water so we
[37:06] don't really know the exact route they
[37:09] took but it would probably take a
[37:10] minimum of 10 days or so to travel each
[37:13] way if if there's no delays and and you
[37:15] want the animals to stay
[37:17] healthy and and while we're looking at
[37:20] pictures have you ever wondered how long
[37:22] it was between the
[37:24] journeys how long did the grain last
[37:28] anybody think it lasted six
[37:30] months or or a
[37:33] year or
[37:35] more or or less I used to think well
[37:39] they probably made the trip once a year
[37:40] it's a second year of famine coming up
[37:42] so it's probably the second trip they've
[37:44] made and that all seems to make sense
[37:46] but then I
[37:47] thought or was it so let let's think
[37:51] this through for for just a moment
[37:57] a good siiz donkey weighs about 700 PBS
[38:01] now we have really huge donkeys these
[38:03] days but but a good siiz animals about
[38:05] 700 lb and a donkey can safely carry
[38:08] about a 20% of its weight 140 pounds or
[38:12] so of grain now we're told that we need
[38:16] about 1,800 calories a day a cup of
[38:18] grain is about 600 calories so three
[38:20] cups per day per person but let's assume
[38:23] that they're small people and they can
[38:25] supplement their uh their grain with
[38:27] other things so maybe they only need
[38:29] 1,200 calories a day from grain now a
[38:32] cup weighs about 5 ounces so each person
[38:35] needs about 10 ounces or 58 of a pound
[38:38] now we're later told that Jacob's Clan
[38:40] is approximately 70 people so you need
[38:44] 700 ounces a day or about 44 pounds so a
[38:48] donkey can carry enough food to feed
[38:51] every witer Hein for about three
[38:54] days now if the 10 so that's what one
[38:57] donkey can do if the 10 Brothers each
[39:00] had three donkeys they'd be able to feed
[39:02] the clan for about 90 days 12 weeks
[39:05] three months well they had other food
[39:07] sources sheep cattle crop yields were
[39:10] low but probably not zero on the other
[39:13] hand they had to feed the livestock so
[39:15] the bottom line is it's probably only
[39:17] been about three or four months since
[39:19] the first trip to Egypt when they're
[39:21] again on the
[39:25] road when Joseph saw Benjamin with them
[39:28] as they're arriving uh to see him he
[39:31] said to the ruler of his house bring
[39:33] these men home and slay an animal make
[39:35] ready prepare a suitable banquet for
[39:38] these men shall dine with me at
[39:41] noon the man did as Zapf pan bade and
[39:45] the man brought the man into zafaf Pan's
[39:47] house not just a typical Egyptian house
[39:50] a little mud brick uh Thing by the side
[39:53] of the Nile somewhere this is a mansion
[39:56] it's near the Palace of pharaoh and
[39:58] Joseph is not a a minor Royal
[40:00] functionary he's the vizer the second
[40:03] most powerful person and the mightiest
[40:06] nation of the era and
[40:10] area now this is an artist's uh
[40:13] conception of what a huge Palace might
[40:16] have looked like in Egypt about this
[40:18] time there's no remains of anything
[40:21] that's been dug up out of the desert to
[40:23] know for sure and it's doubtful that
[40:25] Joseph's house was quite this
[40:26] spectacular
[40:28] but Egyptians were Master stone masons
[40:31] and artists Joseph's house was
[40:34] impressive designed to inspire awe at
[40:37] the magnificence of Egypt and
[40:40] intimidation at the power of its
[40:45] occupant and the men were
[40:47] afraid because they were brought into
[40:50] Zapf Pan's palatial and intimidating
[40:53] house and they said among themselves
[40:57] why does he want to see us because of
[40:59] the money that was returned in our sacks
[41:02] at the first time we were brought in he
[41:04] may seek occasion against us and fall
[41:07] upon us take us for for Bond men and our
[41:11] asses it's clear these guys are afraid
[41:15] they're intimidated hearts are pounding
[41:17] in their chest breaths short brains
[41:22] foggy zafra pan would not need to seek
[41:25] occasion against them his Wills the law
[41:28] he can arbitrarily seize them make them
[41:30] slaves kill them
[41:33] whatever and in the midst of Their
[41:35] Fear I think Moses wrote a line that
[41:38] would have had his audience
[41:40] laughing or at least chuckling not at
[41:43] their plight which produced great
[41:46] anxiety and fear but showing their panic
[41:48] in a humorous way look at the last part
[41:50] of the
[41:52] verse he wants to steal our donkeys
[41:55] that's what he's after he's after our
[42:01] donkeys they came near to the steward of
[42:04] zaa Pena's house and and they spoke with
[42:07] him at the door of the house at the
[42:09] entrance to this Palace and they said oh
[42:12] sir we came indeed down at the first
[42:14] time to buy food and and it came to pass
[42:17] when we came to the end that that we
[42:18] opened our
[42:20] sacks they're very nervous in fact only
[42:22] one sack was opened at the end the the
[42:24] rest were opened in Canaan
[42:27] and behold Every Man's money was in the
[42:29] mouth of his sack or money in full
[42:32] weight full weight to understand these
[42:34] weren't coins you weighed silver and a
[42:38] weight of shekels like grams or ounces
[42:41] or something so it's measured by weight
[42:44] our money in full weight and we brought
[42:46] it again in our hand and the other money
[42:49] the other silver we brought down in our
[42:51] hands to buy food we don't know who put
[42:54] the money in our sacks but it wasn't
[42:59] us and and the steward said Peace be to
[43:03] you fear not relax calm down people you
[43:09] are God and the god of your father hath
[43:13] given you treasure in your
[43:15] sacks have you ever thought about that
[43:18] what was the
[43:20] treasure the grain or the
[43:23] silver it was both the grain
[43:27] representing salvation from
[43:29] starvation and the silver representing
[43:31] Christ who paid our debt of sin and here
[43:35] is Joseph paying the debt for their
[43:37] salvation making it a free gift wow I
[43:42] had your money and he brought Simeon out
[43:45] to
[43:46] them and the man brought the men into
[43:49] zafaf Pan's house and gave them water
[43:52] and they washed their feet and he gave
[43:54] their asses provender
[43:57] he didn't take our donkeys
[44:00] yet they must have had a lot of
[44:03] questions for Simeon trying to
[44:04] understand what's
[44:07] happening and they made ready the
[44:09] present provided by Jacob nuts and honey
[44:12] spices bomb and myrr against Joseph came
[44:16] that is before Zapf Pan's expected
[44:19] arrival at noon for they heard that they
[44:21] should eat bread
[44:24] there and when Zapf pan came came home
[44:28] they brought him the present which was
[44:29] in their hand into the house and he's
[44:32] probably thinking oh honey pistachios
[44:35] almond a reminder of the best of the
[44:37] land of Canaan that he'd enjoyed as a
[44:39] boy and a young man and uhoh spices bomb
[44:45] and
[44:46] myrr GH a reminder of his forced march
[44:49] to Egypt so many years ago these items
[44:52] were precisely the three items the
[44:54] ishmaelites were carrying a reminder of
[44:57] the past what his brothers who were now
[45:00] before him had done to him associated
[45:04] with that particular combination of
[45:06] odors and they bowed themselves to him
[45:10] to the
[45:11] Earth and he asked some of their welfare
[45:14] and said through an interpreter to them
[45:16] he still the strange Egyptian ZF MAF pan
[45:20] is your father well the old man of whom
[45:23] you spake is is he yet alive and they
[45:26] they raised their heads and answered thy
[45:28] servant our father is in good health he
[45:31] is yet alive and they bowed down their
[45:33] heads and made
[45:36] obes they they bowed low they prostrated
[45:39] themselves in homage the rabbis say this
[45:41] was an acknowledgment of his asking
[45:43] about their father so they're bowing on
[45:46] his behalf since Jacob is being called
[45:50] thy servant and since Jacob represents
[45:52] the family as a patriarch this
[45:54] represents the Sun and Moon of Joseph's
[45:57] second dream bowing to
[46:02] him and Joseph lifted up his eyes and
[46:06] saw his brother Benjamin his mother's
[46:08] son and said is this your younger
[46:11] brother of whom you spake unto me and he
[46:13] said God be gracious unto thee my
[46:17] son what the brothers think why did he
[46:21] say that to
[46:24] Benjamin and Joseph made haste for his
[46:27] bowels did yearn upon his brother and he
[46:29] sought where to weep and he entered into
[46:31] his chamber and wept there and the
[46:35] brothers are
[46:36] wondering why did he suddenly
[46:39] leave what's going
[46:42] on and what is this does this remind you
[46:47] of remember the last time Joseph was
[46:51] weeping by himself while his brothers
[46:53] were preparing to
[46:55] eat that time his chamber was the
[46:58] sistern and
[46:59] Doan so many reminders of his past
[47:03] mistreatment by his
[47:05] brothers and he washed his face and went
[47:08] out and refrained himself and as Zapf
[47:12] pan said set on
[47:14] bread and they set on for him by himself
[47:18] he's an important
[47:20] person and for them the 11 Hebrew Men by
[47:25] themselves and for the Egyptians which
[47:27] did eat with him by themselves because
[47:30] the Egyptians might not eat bread with
[47:33] at the same table as Hebrews for that is
[47:36] an Abomination unto the
[47:39] Egyptians Hebrews are not their favorite
[47:42] people and these Hebrews had just
[47:45] traveled for days through the desert
[47:47] were hairy and bearded and
[47:50] dirty Hebrew
[47:53] Hillbillies and and the 11 Brothers sat
[47:57] were given seats before him the the
[47:59] first born according to his Birthright
[48:01] and the youngest according to his Youth
[48:02] and and the men
[48:04] marveled one or another other
[48:06] translations make it clear that Joseph
[48:08] dictated the order of the seating you
[48:11] sit
[48:12] there you sit there you you're next you
[48:16] sit
[48:17] there anybody have an idea how many
[48:20] different ways 11 people can be
[48:23] arranged if 11 of you were here and to
[48:26] put them in a certain order how many
[48:28] combinations are there of 11
[48:34] people
[48:36] 39,9
[48:37] 2016,
[48:40] 800 now of course he knew Benjamin was
[48:43] the youngest so the other 10 leave only
[48:48] 3,628 1800 that's an easy problem to S
[48:52] and it's not like they were very
[48:53] different in age it's not like one of
[48:55] them looked like me and one of them
[48:57] looked like Josiah that that would make
[48:58] it easy no not including Benjamin they
[49:02] were all born within seven years of
[49:05] Jacob marrying Leia and Rachel and the
[49:07] four oldest were born before the next
[49:11] seven which means seven of them were
[49:13] born over a period of less than three
[49:15] and a half years to three different
[49:18] mothers and they're all in their early
[49:19] to mid
[49:20] 40s no wonder they marveled you couldn't
[49:23] just look at them and figure it out and
[49:25] this is part of the set up for the next
[49:28] chapter the concept that zafaf panea is
[49:32] capable of
[49:35] divining and zfn panea took and sent
[49:39] servings unto them from before him but
[49:42] Benjamin's portion was five times so
[49:44] much as any of theirs and they drank and
[49:47] were merry with him the Hebrew word
[49:51] Shahar translated as Mary means Tipsy
[49:55] drunk
[49:57] in other words they were all
[50:00] intoxicated they started at noon they
[50:03] had a long party it's a big party the
[50:08] Egyptians the proper people they won't
[50:11] eat with the Hebrews do you see a
[50:14] parallel here with the gospels what did
[50:16] the proper people say of Jesus the son
[50:19] of man came eating and drinking and they
[50:21] say Behold a man gluttonous a wine Biber
[50:24] a friend of publicans and sinners
[50:28] in chapter 47 not tonight we'll see
[50:31] Joseph is a seriously successful
[50:35] Publican stay
[50:37] tuned now chapter
[50:40] 44 and zaap AF pan commanded the steward
[50:43] of his house saying fill the men's sacks
[50:46] with food as much as they can carry more
[50:49] than they paid for and put every man's
[50:52] money in his sacks mouth and put my cup
[50:56] up the silver cup in the sax mouth of
[51:00] the youngest and his grain money and he
[51:03] did according to the word that zafaf pan
[51:05] had spoken the image here is of silver
[51:08] dishes in a cup from the reign of Amon
[51:10] haet 2 the Pharaoh at the time of
[51:12] Joseph's March into slavery and the
[51:14] father of
[51:17] senu and as soon as the morning was
[51:20] light the men were sent away they and
[51:22] their asses this was an all day and all
[51:26] night party it doesn't say they left and
[51:28] summoned him from the in it says they
[51:30] were sent
[51:31] away they came for lunch at Zapf panas
[51:34] and stayed the night oh they got to keep
[51:37] their
[51:38] donkeys and when they were gone out of
[51:40] the city and not yet far off zafaf pan
[51:45] said to his Steward up quickly follow
[51:49] after the men when thou dust overtake
[51:51] them say unto them wherefore have ye
[51:53] rewarded evil for good is not this it in
[51:58] which my Lord drinketh and whereby
[52:00] indeed he dineth ye have done evil in so
[52:06] doing and the steward overtook them and
[52:08] and spake unto them these same words and
[52:10] they said unto
[52:11] him wherefore saith my Lord these words
[52:15] God forbid that thy servant should do
[52:17] according to this thing behold the money
[52:20] which we found in our sack's mouths we
[52:22] brought again unto thee out of the land
[52:24] of
[52:24] Canaan how then should we steal out of
[52:27] thy Lord's House silver or
[52:29] gold notice they don't dispute that zap
[52:33] Naf P has amazing powers of
[52:35] divination they just saw him pull off a
[52:38] thing with a one in 40 million chance of
[52:42] success with whomsoever of thy servants
[52:45] should be found both let him die and we
[52:48] also will be my Lord's bondmen they know
[52:50] they're innocent they know they haven't
[52:52] taken this they know it
[52:57] and the steward said now also let it be
[53:01] according unto your words he with whom
[53:03] it is found shall be my servant we won't
[53:06] kill him and you shall be blameless not
[53:10] enslaved then they speedily took down
[53:13] every man his sack to the ground and
[53:14] opened every man his
[53:16] sack
[53:18] oops they're quick to prove their
[53:20] innocence they want to be on their way
[53:22] home to feed their families
[53:28] and the steward searched and began at
[53:30] the eldest and left at the youngest it
[53:33] doesn't mean that he did it in birth
[53:34] order but he knew who the oldest was and
[53:37] he knew who the youngest was and he left
[53:40] that youngest one Benjamin for last
[53:42] because he knew that's where the silver
[53:43] cup would be he put it
[53:45] there and the cup was found in
[53:49] Benjamin's sack nobody seems surprised
[53:52] that the money is in the
[53:53] sack but that cup that's a big
[53:57] deal then they the brothers all rent
[54:02] their clothes and laided reloaded the
[54:05] sacks of grain onto every man his ass
[54:07] and returned to the
[54:08] city and Judah notice not not Ruben or
[54:14] Benjamin but but Judah and his Brethren
[54:18] came to ZF Pano's house for he was yet
[54:21] there he's waiting for them and they
[54:24] fell before him on the
[54:28] ground and Zapf panus said unto them
[54:31] what deed is it that you have done
[54:34] didn't you know that such a man as I can
[54:36] certainly
[54:40] Divine speaking through an interpreter
[54:42] of course but look who the spokesman is
[54:44] for the group Judah still wearing his
[54:47] torn clothing
[54:49] said what shall we say unto my Lord what
[54:53] shall we speak how shall shall we clear
[54:57] ourselves God ha found out the iniquity
[55:00] of thy
[55:01] servants Judah is not referring to the
[55:04] iniquity of stealing the cup they didn't
[55:06] do it but past nicity regarding Joseph
[55:09] this whole strange set of circumstances
[55:11] going on he says that God is punishing
[55:14] them for their past sin for
[55:17] behold we are now become my Lord's
[55:20] servants we become your slaves both we
[55:23] and he also with whom the cup is found
[55:26] he he's not guilty of the iniquity that
[55:28] we're guilty of he wasn't part of the
[55:31] sin that God is punishing them for and
[55:34] zath panus said God forbid that I should
[55:38] do so but the man in whose hand the cup
[55:41] is found he shall be my slave as for you
[55:45] get you up in peace under your father I
[55:48] don't want to see you anymore get out of
[55:53] here then
[55:55] Judah
[55:57] remember he's the one whose idea was to
[56:00] sell Joseph to the Israelites in the
[56:02] first place Judah knows it Joseph knows
[56:06] it Judah the one who was transformed as
[56:10] we read last time in chapter 38 that
[56:14] Judah came near unto the man he knew is
[56:17] Zapf pan and said oh my Lord let thy
[56:22] servant I pray thee speak a word in my
[56:25] Lord's ear and let not thine anger burn
[56:29] against thy
[56:30] servant thine anger burn an interesting
[56:34] choice of words from Judah who in Anger
[56:37] was going to burn
[56:39] tomorrow for thou art even as
[56:42] Pharaoh my Lord asked his servants
[56:45] saying have you a father or a brother
[56:48] and we said unto my Lord we have a
[56:50] father an old man and a child of his old
[56:53] age a little one might be better
[56:57] thinking as a small one implying that
[57:00] Benjamin is the youngest of us he's not
[57:03] a kid he's 30 years
[57:05] old and his brother is dead Judah
[57:08] doesn't know if Joseph is dead or not
[57:10] only that he was sent into slavery 23
[57:13] years earlier but Judah is simply
[57:15] reminding zap pan of the contents of the
[57:17] general conversation from their first
[57:20] visit and he alone meaning Benjamin is
[57:23] left of his mother and his father loves
[57:28] him and thou s unto thy servants you
[57:32] said to us bring him down unto me that I
[57:34] may set mine eyes upon him and we said
[57:37] unto my Lord the lad cannot leave his
[57:40] father if he should leave his father his
[57:43] father would die and thou sayest unto
[57:46] thy servants except your youngest
[57:48] brother come down with you you shall see
[57:49] my face no
[57:51] more and it came to pass when we came up
[57:54] to thy servant my father we told him the
[57:58] words of my Lord and our father said go
[58:02] again and and buy us a little food and
[58:05] we said we cannot go down if our
[58:08] youngest brother be with us then will we
[58:10] go down for we may not see the man's
[58:13] face we may not buy Grain except our
[58:17] youngest brother be with
[58:19] us and thy servant my father said unto
[58:22] us you know that my wife bear me two
[58:25] sons
[58:27] one went out from me and I said surely
[58:29] he's torn in pieces and I saw him not
[58:32] since at this Joseph knows his surmise
[58:36] was correct Jacob thought Joseph had
[58:39] been killed just as Ruben said on their
[58:42] first visit if you take this meaning
[58:46] Benjamin also from me and Mischief
[58:49] befall him you shall bring down my gray
[58:52] hairs with sorrow to the
[58:54] grave now therefore when I come to thy
[58:57] servant my father and the lad be not
[59:00] with us seeing that his life is bound up
[59:02] in the lad's life it shall come to pass
[59:06] when he seeth the lad is not with us
[59:08] that that he will die and thy servant
[59:10] shall bring down the gray hairs of thy
[59:12] servant our father with sorrow to the
[59:16] Grave for thy servant I Judah became
[59:21] shity for the lad unto my father saying
[59:24] if I bring him not unto thee that and I
[59:26] shall bear the blame to my father
[59:29] forever now therefore I pray thee let
[59:32] thy servant let me abide instead of the
[59:35] lad AB bondman to my Lord and let the
[59:38] lad go up with his
[59:41] brethren for how shall I go up to my
[59:44] father and the lad be not with me lest
[59:48] per Adventure I see the evil that shall
[59:51] come on my
[59:53] father this is a very different
[59:56] Judah he's been transformed by the
[59:59] conclusion of judah's Supplication
[1:00:02] Joseph realizes several
[1:00:05] things first his father truly was led to
[1:00:09] believe Joseph was killed when he didn't
[1:00:11] return from Dothan with his
[1:00:13] brothers his conclusion based on Ruben's
[1:00:16] statement at the end of their first
[1:00:17] visit as we discussed last time was in
[1:00:20] fact
[1:00:21] correct thus Jacob not coming to rescue
[1:00:24] Joseph is not born BN of a lack of
[1:00:26] compassion or love but is instead the
[1:00:31] fruit of
[1:00:34] Deceit
[1:00:35] second that Judah the one who arranged
[1:00:38] his sail to the ishmaelite spice Traders
[1:00:41] had truly
[1:00:43] changed he who was willing to condemn
[1:00:46] Joseph to slaver in Egypt was now asking
[1:00:48] that he be made a slave in Egypt to
[1:00:51] spare Jacob further
[1:00:53] grief third the he Joseph cannot
[1:00:57] knowingly be the cause of further grief
[1:00:59] to his
[1:01:00] dad he cannot retain Benjamin and send
[1:01:04] the others back to
[1:01:07] Canaan all of which means he can no
[1:01:10] longer be Zapf Pena to his family he
[1:01:14] must once again be
[1:01:18] Joseph chapter 45 then Joseph could not
[1:01:22] refrain himself from before all them
[1:01:24] that stood by him and he cried in egyp
[1:01:25] Egyptian cause every man to go out from
[1:01:30] me there stood no man with him none as
[1:01:33] afnaf Pan's Egyptian staff guards
[1:01:36] interpreters while Joseph made himself
[1:01:39] known unto his
[1:01:42] brothers here we see one of the most
[1:01:44] often quoted parallels of the life of
[1:01:47] Joseph and the life of
[1:01:49] Jesus the first time the brothers were
[1:01:51] together with Joseph after the famine
[1:01:53] began Joseph saved him from starvation
[1:01:56] we spoke of this last time about Jesus
[1:01:59] being the bread of life and Joseph
[1:02:01] providing grain bread to sustain Jacob's
[1:02:04] family the fact that the money was put
[1:02:06] back in their sacks showing that his
[1:02:08] gift of life was without cost it was
[1:02:10] freely given that they could try to pay
[1:02:13] for it even be convinced that they had
[1:02:15] earned it but they couldn't they had to
[1:02:18] accept it as a free
[1:02:21] gift and this time which is often used
[1:02:24] to illustrate Jesus Second Coming his
[1:02:27] brothers the the Jewish Nation will
[1:02:29] recognize him paralleling teachings
[1:02:32] about the second coming of Christ were
[1:02:34] told that azath Joseph's Egyptian wife
[1:02:37] was in the palace and not present when
[1:02:40] his brothers recognize Joseph brother
[1:02:42] brandham mentions this many times in his
[1:02:44] various
[1:02:45] sermons we could end the story here end
[1:02:49] the series on Joseph but Moses
[1:02:53] didn't and neither will we
[1:02:58] and Joseph wept aloud and the Egyptians
[1:03:01] in the house of pharaoh heard Joseph was
[1:03:03] overcome with emotion and cried
[1:03:05] out and Joseph not zafaf pan through an
[1:03:10] interpreter Joseph said unto his
[1:03:13] brothers I am Joseph does my father yet
[1:03:18] live is it really true that Dad is alive
[1:03:21] you're not just making this up this is
[1:03:24] the first time that Joseph refers to
[1:03:26] Jacob as his
[1:03:28] father and his Brethren could not answer
[1:03:31] him they were troubled at his
[1:03:34] presence no surprise there Reuben would
[1:03:38] be the most shocked if this was true
[1:03:41] this Egyptian fellow had just told them
[1:03:44] that he could Divine how could zap Naf
[1:03:46] panea know the name of the brother who
[1:03:48] was not they haven't said the name
[1:03:52] Joseph and how can Joseph convince them
[1:03:55] that this isn't some witchcraft or
[1:03:57] divination or other means that it's not
[1:03:59] some sort of an
[1:04:01] act
[1:04:04] Joseph said unto his
[1:04:06] Brethren come near to me I pray
[1:04:09] you I pray you the the Hebrew word is n
[1:04:13] it often means please in the case of a
[1:04:17] command or an imperative it softens it
[1:04:20] so he's not commanding them come here or
[1:04:22] else but he is insisting
[1:04:26] and they came near they're still
[1:04:28] troubled at his presence and he Saidi am
[1:04:31] Joseph your brother whom you sold into
[1:04:35] Egypt at this Reuben must have looked at
[1:04:39] his
[1:04:40] brothers and seen their guilt-filled
[1:04:43] countenances filled with fear if this
[1:04:47] guy really is Joseph and has the power
[1:04:50] he clearly has this might not be good
[1:04:54] news Joseph goes goes on to reassure
[1:04:56] them of his good intentions toward them
[1:04:59] now therefore be not grieved nor angry
[1:05:03] with yourselves that you sold me hither
[1:05:06] for God did send me before you to
[1:05:11] preserve
[1:05:13] life Joseph has understood his
[1:05:17] role for these two years hath the famine
[1:05:21] been in the land and yet there are five
[1:05:24] years in which which there shall neither
[1:05:26] be earring nor Harvest and God sent me
[1:05:30] before you he repeats this do you get
[1:05:33] this guys he repeats it it's God's doing
[1:05:37] to preserve you a posterity in the earth
[1:05:40] and to save your lives by a great
[1:05:44] Deliverance they're still
[1:05:47] silent so now it was not you that sent
[1:05:50] me here but God this is the third time
[1:05:53] he's repeated this are you getting it
[1:05:58] guys and Heath made me a father to
[1:06:02] Pharaoh we talked about this in part
[1:06:04] four that senusret 2 who had the dreams
[1:06:07] died about the time the years of plenty
[1:06:09] ended and his son senusret three who had
[1:06:12] been tutored by Joseph for several years
[1:06:14] was now
[1:06:16] Pharaoh made me a father to pharaoh and
[1:06:18] Lord of all his house and and a ruler
[1:06:20] throughout all the land of
[1:06:23] Egypt Hast she hurry up go up to my
[1:06:27] father and say unto him thus saith thy
[1:06:31] son Joseph God hath made me Lord of all
[1:06:35] Egypt come down unto me T
[1:06:39] not and thou shalt dwell in the land of
[1:06:42] Goan Joseph has carefully inspected the
[1:06:46] entire land during his tenure he knows
[1:06:49] the best
[1:06:51] areas in chapter 47 we'll see how he
[1:06:54] knew the land land would be available
[1:06:56] for his extended family to
[1:06:59] settle and thou shalt be near unto me
[1:07:02] thou and thy children and thy children's
[1:07:05] children and thy flocks and thy herds
[1:07:07] and all that thou Hast and there will I
[1:07:12] nourish
[1:07:13] thee again a model of Christ come down
[1:07:18] from heaven can't be bought the bread
[1:07:20] from Heaven can't be bought but will be
[1:07:23] a gift for there are yet yet five years
[1:07:26] of famine to come he repeats this
[1:07:29] prediction to emphasize
[1:07:31] it lest thou and thy household and all
[1:07:34] that thou Hast come to
[1:07:37] Poverty yeah I'm your
[1:07:40] brother but in this land I'm also your
[1:07:43] lord and I will save you in spite of
[1:07:45] your rejection of me and what I suffered
[1:07:47] at your hands a perfect parallel to
[1:07:52] Jesus and behold your eyes see and the
[1:07:55] eyes of my brother Benjamin that it's my
[1:07:58] mouth that speaketh unto
[1:08:00] you and I can see in your eyes you're
[1:08:03] starting to believe me and now he
[1:08:06] becomes assertive and ye shall tell my
[1:08:09] father of all my glory the honor the
[1:08:12] fame the Splendor in Egypt and of all
[1:08:16] that ye have seen and ye shall haste and
[1:08:18] bring down my father hither he's very
[1:08:22] very old get him down here quickly
[1:08:27] and he fell upon his brother Benjamin's
[1:08:29] neck and wept and Benjamin wept on his
[1:08:34] neck moreover he kissed all his Brethren
[1:08:37] and wept upon them and after that his
[1:08:41] Brethren who had been dumb struck until
[1:08:43] now talked with
[1:08:45] him reminds me a little of Thomas after
[1:08:48] Jesus resurrection he needed serious
[1:08:50] convincing
[1:08:56] and the fame thereof not just Joseph is
[1:08:59] overcome and his weeping was heard in
[1:09:01] Pharaoh's
[1:09:03] house saying Joseph's Brethren are come
[1:09:07] and it pleased Pharaoh well and his
[1:09:11] servants and Pharaoh said unto Joseph
[1:09:14] after summoning him to the Palace say
[1:09:16] unto thy Brethren this do ye laid your
[1:09:21] beasts load your
[1:09:24] donkeys and go get you into the land of
[1:09:28] Canaan and take your father and your
[1:09:30] households from
[1:09:32] Canaan and come unto me and I will give
[1:09:35] you the good of the land of Egypt and
[1:09:37] you shall eat the fat of the land again
[1:09:40] parallels go ye into all the world
[1:09:42] preach the good
[1:09:43] news come unto me all ye that labor and
[1:09:46] heavy laid and I'll give you
[1:09:48] rest now Thou Art commanded this do ye
[1:09:52] take you King James says wagon a much
[1:09:56] better word is carts out of the land of
[1:09:58] Egypt for your little ones and for your
[1:10:01] wives not for your heavy stuff and bring
[1:10:04] your father and come and also regard not
[1:10:08] your stuff for the good of all the land
[1:10:11] of Egypt is
[1:10:12] yours Pharaoh seems awfully generous
[1:10:16] we'll get a strong hint about why at the
[1:10:18] end of chapter 47 not tonight and the
[1:10:22] children of Israel did so and Joseph
[1:10:26] gave them carts according to the
[1:10:27] Commandment of pharaoh and gave them
[1:10:30] provision for the
[1:10:32] way many use these verses and
[1:10:35] specifically the use of the word wagons
[1:10:37] to dispute the time of Joseph being
[1:10:40] during the 12th dynasty of the Middle
[1:10:42] Kingdom they point out that evidence of
[1:10:44] four-wheeled wagons didn't exist in
[1:10:46] Egypt until the late second intermediate
[1:10:48] period or early New Kingdom 1600s or
[1:10:50] 1500s BC two or 3 hundred years after
[1:10:54] the 12th Dynasty where we have placed
[1:10:57] Joseph this is the first record of Egypt
[1:10:59] having four- wheeled wagons in
[1:11:01] approximately the 1600s of BC during the
[1:11:04] 13th Dynasty more than 200 years after
[1:11:07] these carts are sent to Joseph's family
[1:11:09] in Hein the image is taken from a stone
[1:11:12] relief the wheels are tiny discs could
[1:11:16] even be small logs useless over rough
[1:11:19] desert
[1:11:21] Trails but as early as the fifth Dynasty
[1:11:24] around 400 years years prior to the
[1:11:26] setting of the story two wheeled scaling
[1:11:29] ladders were in use and a Siege Tower is
[1:11:32] Illustrated in a tomb of the 11th
[1:11:33] Dynasty about 150 years before the time
[1:11:37] of the 12th Dynasty both these images
[1:11:39] are from Stone reliefs noticed
[1:11:42] especially the fifth Dynasty scaling
[1:11:45] ladder has decent sides solid disc
[1:11:47] wheels and an
[1:11:49] axle the Hebrew word translated in the
[1:11:52] King James Bible as wagon and more
[1:11:54] accurately cared
[1:11:55] is agala in modern usage small hand
[1:11:59] trucks like one we might use to move an
[1:12:01] appliance are called aala agala is
[1:12:04] derive from a word that means revolving
[1:12:07] circular
[1:12:08] round the carts sent by phero and Joseph
[1:12:11] were most likely two wielded carts and
[1:12:14] were not for their goods but for their
[1:12:15] small children their wives for Jacob
[1:12:19] light loads hard to put on the back of a
[1:12:21] donkey and people incapable of walking
[1:12:24] the distances involved
[1:12:26] verse 17 showed us that heavy loads were
[1:12:28] carried directly by donkeys not loaded
[1:12:30] on carts or wagons we'll see the same in
[1:12:32] verse 23 now we have no illustrations
[1:12:35] carved in stone or examples from tombs
[1:12:37] of what such a cart might have been like
[1:12:40] remember nearly all the tombs of the
[1:12:42] Pharaohs and of the wealthy were robbed
[1:12:44] in
[1:12:45] Antiquity it's only in the later New
[1:12:47] Kingdom that there were extensive
[1:12:49] paintings inside tomb walls illustrating
[1:12:51] daily life the the wooden models I
[1:12:53] showed you pictures of
[1:12:55] uh last time surviving from Joseph times
[1:12:58] were Agriculture and food making and so
[1:13:02] it was so that the deceased could eat
[1:13:03] food in the afterlife they wouldn't
[1:13:06] starve and the models were apparently of
[1:13:08] little value to tomb
[1:13:10] Raiders finally remember that lack of
[1:13:14] direct evidence of the carts is not the
[1:13:16] same as evidence of a lack of
[1:13:20] carts moving
[1:13:22] on to all of them Joseph gave each man
[1:13:25] changes of
[1:13:27] rment why because they torn theirs when
[1:13:31] the cup was found in Benjamin's sack of
[1:13:34] grain but to Benjamin he gave 300 pieces
[1:13:37] of silver and five changes of
[1:13:40] rment and to his father he sent after
[1:13:42] this manner 10 asses Laden with the good
[1:13:45] things of Egypt and 10 she asses Laden
[1:13:48] with grain and bread and food for his
[1:13:50] father by the
[1:13:52] way again note the heavy those are born
[1:13:55] directly by the pack animals not loaded
[1:13:57] into carts or wagons further evidence
[1:14:00] that the wagons were two wheeled carts
[1:14:02] and not four or more wheeled Vehicles
[1:14:05] such carts could slowly Traverse unpaved
[1:14:07] paths in the Rocky desert Wilderness
[1:14:10] befitting events in Egyptian technology
[1:14:12] in the time of the 12th dynasty of the
[1:14:14] Middle
[1:14:16] Kingdom so Joseph sent his Brethren away
[1:14:20] and that he parted and he said unto them
[1:14:22] see that you fall not out by the way
[1:14:25] what does that mean don't fall off a
[1:14:27] cliff on a mountain trail don't stop at
[1:14:30] Disneyland of the sin go directly home
[1:14:33] don't
[1:14:34] dottle it's not what he's saying other
[1:14:37] translations read don't quarrel among
[1:14:39] yourselves while you're
[1:14:42] traveling the Hebrew word regaz
[1:14:44] translated Fallout means tremble Quake
[1:14:49] rage shake or quiver with violent
[1:14:51] emotion especially anger or fear today
[1:14:55] we might say road
[1:14:59] rage can you
[1:15:01] imagine Reuben's
[1:15:03] anger at having been told a lie all
[1:15:07] these years about Joseph's demise Reuben
[1:15:10] having unwittingly been pulled into the
[1:15:12] deception of Dipping Joseph's special
[1:15:15] coat in goat's blood to convince Jacob
[1:15:18] their father that Joseph had been
[1:15:20] killed what did Judah and the other
[1:15:22] brothers told Ruben when he came back
[1:15:24] and found the sister and empty and asked
[1:15:25] the child is not an eye whether shall I
[1:15:28] go I don't know bro hungry lion or a
[1:15:31] bear must have smelled him and heard him
[1:15:33] balling his eyes out and carried him off
[1:15:35] to devour that's why we're here
[1:15:37] protecting the flocks
[1:15:38] right but there's no blood in the
[1:15:41] sistern the animal didn't want to get
[1:15:43] trapped in there probably dragged him
[1:15:44] away to eat him in its den or feed its
[1:15:46] Cubs in one of the caves around here
[1:15:49] Joey might have found a way to try and
[1:15:50] climb out when he was taken who knows
[1:15:53] but he's obviously dead and good ridd
[1:15:57] right but now Ruben knows the truth
[1:16:01] straight from the mouth of
[1:16:03] Joseph
[1:16:06] oops or what about
[1:16:08] Benjamin all these years you've told me
[1:16:12] my brother Joseph was killed but you
[1:16:16] sold him into
[1:16:19] slavery what kind of brothers are
[1:16:22] you how could you do that that what kind
[1:16:26] of family is
[1:16:29] this and both Ruben and Benjamin first
[1:16:31] and last born accusing how could you do
[1:16:35] this to our
[1:16:37] father and all of them what are we going
[1:16:40] to
[1:16:42] do how are we going to tell
[1:16:46] Dad they know Joseph will tell Jacob all
[1:16:50] the details of his life since he left
[1:16:52] Hein for sheam those 23 years earlier
[1:16:55] the brothers have no choice but to
[1:16:58] finally tell Jacob the
[1:17:04] truth Judah so far at least is the only
[1:17:08] one we know that is
[1:17:10] demonstrated confession and
[1:17:13] repentance Simeon and Levi admitted
[1:17:16] killing the men of shakam but Justified
[1:17:18] their actions no sense of guilt or
[1:17:20] remorse or repentance and demonstrated
[1:17:23] want and cruelty hamst stringing the
[1:17:25] animals and Jacob's response to it how
[1:17:28] could you do this was you're putting us
[1:17:30] all in danger you're putting me in
[1:17:32] danger Jacob was a very self-focused
[1:17:35] individual and how will Jacob their dad
[1:17:39] react to having been deceived and not
[1:17:42] about a missing piece of pie or other
[1:17:44] triviality but about his favorite son
[1:17:47] and for 23
[1:17:49] years I'll repeat one of our opening
[1:17:52] verses be not deceived
[1:17:55] God is Not mocked whatsoever a man Seth
[1:17:59] that shall he also reap I wonder if Paul
[1:18:02] was thinking about job when he wrote
[1:18:05] that even as I have seen they that plow
[1:18:09] iniquity and so wickedness reap the
[1:18:13] same Jacob's whole life has been one of
[1:18:17] practicing
[1:18:19] deception his sons have been good
[1:18:21] students a wakeup call for Jacob is
[1:18:24] coming on the road from Egypt to heon in
[1:18:27] the form of 11 shocked
[1:18:32] brothers and as they went up out of
[1:18:34] Egypt and came into the land of Canaan
[1:18:37] unto Jacob their
[1:18:38] father I can imagine and it's just my
[1:18:42] imagination that Jacob saw them saw them
[1:18:46] arrive
[1:18:47] pale now shaking as they lock eyes and
[1:18:52] notice him looking their way and he
[1:18:55] happy that he plainly sees Simeon and
[1:18:58] Benjamin or part of the returning group
[1:18:59] could have said hey
[1:19:02] boys welcome
[1:19:05] home what happened down there in
[1:19:08] Egypt you all look like You' seen a
[1:19:12] ghost seriously now tell me all about
[1:19:16] it and they told him saying Joseph is
[1:19:20] yet alive and he is Governor over all
[1:19:22] the land of Egypt
[1:19:25] whatever the greetings this was the last
[1:19:28] thing Jacob would have ever expected
[1:19:30] them or anyone to
[1:19:33] say and Jacob's heart fainted for he
[1:19:36] believed them
[1:19:38] not of course he didn't how could he if
[1:19:41] Joseph were alive why hadn't he reached
[1:19:43] out to his family if he was as powerful
[1:19:45] as they asserted he could have easily
[1:19:47] done so why would he run away and hide
[1:19:50] for 13 years cut off all contact
[1:19:55] how had his special coat been left
[1:19:56] behind and covered in
[1:19:58] blood Jacob had mourned the loss of
[1:20:00] Joseph for
[1:20:02] years this can't be
[1:20:05] true but it
[1:20:07] was and they told him all the words of
[1:20:10] Joseph which he had said unto
[1:20:14] them in the course of these Revelations
[1:20:16] would have come the confession of the
[1:20:18] brothers selling
[1:20:19] Joseph and the cover
[1:20:22] up and when Jacob would have undoubtedly
[1:20:26] challenged them how could you do this
[1:20:29] they undoubtedly pointed out Jacob's
[1:20:31] duplicity all of his life Esau and the
[1:20:35] birthright deceiving Isaac for the
[1:20:37] blessing of the
[1:20:39] firstborn Rachel and Leia the spotted
[1:20:42] sheep at Uncle
[1:20:44] laan's dad your life has been one of
[1:20:48] continual
[1:20:49] deception and
[1:20:52] self-focus and you're upset with us for
[1:20:55] following your
[1:20:58] example you ignored us dad always put
[1:21:02] Joseph first we hated him and that hate
[1:21:05] came from your preferential treatment at
[1:21:08] our
[1:21:09] expense we just wanted some of that love
[1:21:12] and attention Dad we thought with Joseph
[1:21:16] out of the picture you'd finally see us
[1:21:19] but no you were more concerned about
[1:21:22] mourning what you'd lost than caring
[1:21:25] about what you still
[1:21:27] had maybe some of the air finally got
[1:21:30] cleared the brothers were reaping what
[1:21:33] they had
[1:21:34] sown and so was their dad
[1:21:38] Jacob and when Jacob saw the carts which
[1:21:42] Joseph had sent to carry him the spirit
[1:21:45] of Jacob their father revived he could
[1:21:48] see that the carts were Egyptian not
[1:21:50] Canaanite the people attending them were
[1:21:52] clearly Egyptian as well
[1:21:55] and Israel
[1:21:56] said it is enough Joseph my son is yet
[1:22:02] alive I'll go and see him before I
[1:22:07] die chapter
[1:22:09] 46 and Israel took his journey with all
[1:22:12] that he had and came to Beva and offered
[1:22:16] sacrifices unto the god of his father
[1:22:20] Isaac and God spake unto Israel in the
[1:22:22] visions of the night and said Jacob
[1:22:26] Jacob and he said here am
[1:22:31] I why
[1:22:33] biva why not Hein is it just because
[1:22:37] it's on the way if so why stop and offer
[1:22:40] sacrifices there let's unravel that
[1:22:44] mystery we're running out of time this
[1:22:46] evening why b sha it's next
[1:22:52] time and this part of the story of
[1:22:54] Joseph's life we find Joseph as a model
[1:22:57] of Christ revealing himself when he sees
[1:23:00] genuine repentance the musicians could
[1:23:03] kindly
[1:23:05] return and we see that those who were
[1:23:07] his enemies his brothers who hated him
[1:23:10] received Grace at his hand they didn't
[1:23:13] know who he was but he knew who they
[1:23:17] were and in this part I also see a life
[1:23:20] reflecting teachings that Jesus will
[1:23:22] speak some 2,000 years later
[1:23:25] he might have been thinking of the life
[1:23:27] of Joseph as he prepared to deliver his
[1:23:29] most notable
[1:23:31] sermon Matthew 5:44 I say unto you love
[1:23:35] your enemies bless them that curse you
[1:23:39] do good to them that hate you pray for
[1:23:43] them which despitefully use you and
[1:23:46] persecute you or Matthew 6 if ye forgive
[1:23:51] men their trespasses your heavenly
[1:23:53] father will also forgive you but if you
[1:23:56] forgive not men their
[1:23:58] trespasses neither will your father
[1:24:01] forgive your
[1:24:03] trespasses or in Matthew 7 therefore all
[1:24:08] things whatsoever you would that men
[1:24:10] should do to you do so even to
[1:24:14] them even if they're your enemy for this
[1:24:18] is the law and the prophets Joseph is
[1:24:23] not only showing grace and mercy but
[1:24:26] loving kindness to his
[1:24:30] brothers let's worship together and
[1:24:33] celebrate our Lord's loving kindness to
[1:24:35] us all there's a song that's based on
[1:24:39] Psalm
[1:24:40] 63 let's all sing it together and you
[1:24:44] can sing it in the correct key I'll be
[1:24:46] struggling to find it here
[1:24:48] somewhere th thy loving kindness

[1:27:48] name did you enjoy it as much as I did
[1:27:51] did you learn something
[1:27:57] I'm so
[1:27:58] [Music]
[1:28:00] blessed my brother Lyall is just a
[1:28:02] wonderful teacher and he's he's a
[1:28:05] wonderfully learned person someone that
[1:28:09] studies and takes these things in using
[1:28:12] the very native Lang or learning the
[1:28:14] very native language of Hebrew so that
[1:28:17] he can learn these things better and
[1:28:20] that he can present these things to us
[1:28:22] so that we might understand the word
[1:28:24] better one thing that I just have to
[1:28:28] share with the church and I don't want
[1:28:30] to try to add to
[1:28:31] brother Lyle's
[1:28:34] sermon and he said
[1:28:38] this believe he read this
[1:28:40] [Music]
[1:28:42] scripture Genesis
[1:28:44] 45:7 and God and this is Joseph speaking
[1:28:48] God sent me before you to preserve your
[1:28:51] posterity in the earth and to save your
[1:28:53] lives by a great Deliverance so now it
[1:28:56] was not you that sent me hither but God
[1:29:00] and he made me a father to pharaoh and
[1:29:03] Lord of all his house and a ruler
[1:29:06] throughout all the
[1:29:09] land and brother ly
[1:29:11] said he your exact words where let me
[1:29:14] read your exact
[1:29:19] words he said
[1:29:25] [Music]
[1:29:28] it took so many notes brother I'm
[1:29:31] sorry but the L's words were
[1:29:34] Joseph understood his
[1:29:39] role I've heard brother brandom
[1:29:41] say that if the bride could just realize
[1:29:45] who she
[1:29:47] is can you
[1:29:49] imagine if we really
[1:29:52] understood who our father is and if we
[1:29:56] really
[1:29:58] understood Jesus Christ and we really
[1:30:01] understood what a son or a daughter of
[1:30:04] God
[1:30:06] is can you
[1:30:08] imagine the different lives that we
[1:30:11] would live can you imagine the blessings
[1:30:13] that we don't have because we really
[1:30:15] don't truly understand who we
[1:30:18] are
[1:30:20] Joseph
[1:30:21] understood who he was
[1:30:24] and not only did he save all of Egypt
[1:30:28] but he also saved
[1:30:30] Israel the sons of
[1:30:33] Israel later
[1:30:36] on 400 and something years later 440
[1:30:39] years 430 years
[1:30:41] later a prophecy came
[1:30:44] forth about these same descendants of
[1:30:47] this same man Jacob and said oh Israel
[1:30:51] whatever blesses you will be blessed and
[1:30:54] whatever curses you will be cursed and
[1:30:57] we see that same today if we would just
[1:31:00] realize what God has promised us Jesus
[1:31:04] Christ himself said ask anything in my
[1:31:07] name and I will do it imagine if we
[1:31:10] really understood our role like this man
[1:31:13] Joseph understood his role well done
[1:31:16] brother L well done let's all
[1:31:19] stand and then we will
[1:31:22] sing there's coming a day when we
[1:31:24] realize when we do really realize who we
[1:31:28] are and for eternity we'll sing of the
[1:31:31] goodness of
[1:31:33] God there I'm going to do one song great
[1:31:37] all is
[1:31:42] well all is
[1:31:48] well we have heard the message the
[1:31:55] and all
[1:32:00] is there is a place of perfect rest
[1:32:08] behind the
[1:32:11] inner
[1:32:13] so rest little
[1:32:16] Bri rest for all is

[1:33:12] could we not saying all is well because
[1:33:16] all is well all is it may seem like
[1:33:19] things are hard it may seem seem like
[1:33:21] things are rough just like brother
[1:33:24] Daniel gave the testimony
[1:33:27] earlier that lady just needed a just a
[1:33:30] little bit and God provided and I really
[1:33:33] believe God provided for her because the
[1:33:36] true Son of God was praying for
