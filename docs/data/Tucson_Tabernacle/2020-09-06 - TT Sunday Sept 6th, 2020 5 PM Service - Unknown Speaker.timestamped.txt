[45:18] and then i'll have you be seated first
[45:19] corinthians 1 verse 21
[45:22] for after that in the wisdom of god
[45:24] notice this
[45:26] the world by wisdom knew not god
[45:29] read that again for after that in the
[45:32] wisdom
[45:33] of god the world by wisdom
[45:37] knew not god it pleased
[45:40] god by the foolishness of preaching
[45:44] to save them that believe
[45:47] heavenly father we thank you lord for
[45:49] this opportunity once again
[45:51] we have lord to be gathered here with
[45:53] believers of like precious faith
[45:55] lord with one common goal one common
[45:59] desire lord that we have
[46:00] lord and that's to learn how to be a
[46:02] better christian
[46:04] father how to live and serve you better
[46:07] lord is
[46:08] father uh a servant lord that's useful
[46:11] lord a a servant who's given lord been
[46:14] given
[46:15] so much as we have as your family lord
[46:17] but not just to take what you've given
[46:19] us lord and to bury it
[46:20] father but to use it lord as a tool for
[46:23] that's what you gave it to us for
[46:25] now lord i pray that you would come by
[46:27] your spirit once again lord as we seen
[46:29] you come this morning
[46:31] father you showed up as your prophet
[46:33] said you always come
[46:34] wherever you're invited lord so we raise
[46:37] our hands tonight and we say
[46:38] come holy spirit we invite you just now
[46:41] come and take your abode lord come and
[46:43] take these words
[46:45] lord that aren't the words of man father
[46:47] but it's words of eternal life and may
[46:49] you impart that
[46:51] to each and every single person tonight
[46:54] maybe a different measure lord maybe one
[46:56] would hear
[46:57] something that another would hear lord
[46:59] the same
[47:00] phrase but lord they would receive
[47:02] something totally different from it for
[47:04] that's just
[47:05] lord how you do things you're the great
[47:06] shepherd lord and no one leaves
[47:09] disappointed
[47:10] when they come with an expectation to
[47:11] see you now lord i pray that you would
[47:13] just take prayer minutes now we ask and
[47:15] in jesus christ's name
[47:17] amen you can be seated
[47:23] i'd like to just continue this uh
[47:26] rebuilding the tabernacle of david and
[47:29] again i'm not sure that we'll get
[47:31] to too much uh of the actual thought
[47:34] that we
[47:34] the the core of where we're wanting to
[47:36] go with this but we just want to cover
[47:38] just a portion of this
[47:40] we could speak about the tabernacle of
[47:43] david and the tabernacle of solomon
[47:45] and what we'd like to look at tonight
[47:47] just here for a few minutes
[47:49] is the tabernacle of solomon i believe
[47:53] that
[47:53] solomon represents something today
[47:57] uh modern day today speaking of our age
[48:01] we know that the ladies in church would
[48:03] be typified through many examples
[48:06] in the bible uh that the spirit that
[48:09] would come upon the age that you and i
[48:11] live in
[48:12] would be represented by a spirit that
[48:14] you find
[48:15] even all the way back in the old
[48:16] testament we know that the bible says in
[48:19] second chronicles and i'm going to list
[48:21] these scriptures if you can
[48:22] pull them up on the screen brother
[48:23] jeremy that'd be fine i wouldn't want
[48:25] you to try to turn to them
[48:27] turn to them in your seat um as i'd read
[48:29] it before you could get there but second
[48:31] chronicles chapter 1
[48:33] verse 1. the bible says and solomon
[48:36] the son of david was strengthened in his
[48:39] kingdom
[48:40] and the lord his god was with him and
[48:43] magnified him exceedingly
[48:46] so we know that the the bible is going
[48:48] to speak of jesus
[48:50] and it's going to call him the son of
[48:52] david this is
[48:53] said in many places matthew chapter one
[48:56] when he's going to list the genealogy of
[48:58] jesus
[48:59] is going to start with this genealogy
[49:01] and is going to list it
[49:03] as jesus the son of david and you could
[49:06] ask the question
[49:07] how was jesus the son of david well
[49:10] he was the son of david both spiritually
[49:14] and he was literally the son of david in
[49:16] fact most people believe that matthew
[49:19] lists joseph's line lineage and you'll
[49:22] find that he sums it up he doesn't list
[49:24] every descendant but he sums it up by
[49:27] saying starting with jacob then into
[49:29] joseph all the way through joseph you'd
[49:31] come all the way down
[49:33] to jesus and he would descend from the
[49:36] house of david
[49:37] and that was going to be important the
[49:39] bible speaks a lot about
[49:40] he was the root and he was the offspring
[49:44] of david and so we know that david david
[49:47] was going to hold a very crucial
[49:50] part in the scripture it was going to
[49:52] hold a very crucial part to the plan of
[49:54] redemption
[49:55] we know that it would be through david
[49:57] that he would have a son named solomon
[49:59] who
[50:00] the bible says that david desired to
[50:02] build a house for the lord
[50:04] but god says david you can't build my
[50:06] house you're a man of war
[50:07] uh you're a bloody man you you you it'll
[50:10] come not through you but it'll come
[50:12] through your loins it'll come through
[50:13] solomon
[50:14] but even solomon's temple though as
[50:16] grand and as grandious as it was
[50:19] and beautiful as it was solomon's was
[50:22] did everything bigger
[50:23] than david it was more gold it was
[50:27] more splendor there was more beauty
[50:29] outwardly speaking
[50:31] it was a much greater temple than any
[50:33] temple
[50:34] even today to re the reconstruction of
[50:37] solomon's temple
[50:38] and the the the if you see just images
[50:41] of solomon's temple
[50:42] and reconstruct it's just one of such
[50:46] glory one of such beauty
[50:49] and and solomon was uh everything that
[50:52] he built was
[50:53] bigger you could say it was better
[50:56] outwardly speaking but we know that
[50:59] ultimately
[51:00] the tabernacle of god wasn't going to
[51:02] rest in solomon's
[51:04] temple but jesus was going to come in
[51:08] the world
[51:08] and he was going to say behold a greater
[51:11] than solomon is here
[51:14] and he and he would point to the temple
[51:16] of solomon he would point to even
[51:18] herod's temple that they had rebuilt
[51:20] in the day that jesus in the days of
[51:22] herod and jesus was going to say behold
[51:24] a greater
[51:25] one greater than the temple is before
[51:27] you now
[51:28] what they didn't realize is that though
[51:30] they had worshiped god
[51:32] in temples made with hands all the way
[51:35] from moses
[51:36] when he made a tabernacle in the
[51:37] wilderness moses was trying to
[51:39] reconstruct
[51:40] an inspiration that god had given him
[51:43] and god said build it exactly as you see
[51:46] it but then god would move from that
[51:48] temple and he'd move into solomon's
[51:49] temple and
[51:50] he'd have he'd have the same colors and
[51:52] he'd have gold he'd lay it with purple
[51:54] and with scarlet and
[51:56] and he would he'd have some of the same
[51:58] articles of the tabernacle the menorah
[52:01] the table of showbread the altar of
[52:04] incense the laver
[52:05] all of those articles were in solomon's
[52:08] temple
[52:08] it was greater than moses desert
[52:11] tabernacle where it was just a tent
[52:13] made of linen now it was actually
[52:15] pillars made of
[52:16] stone and pillars made of lebanon trees
[52:19] from lebanon cedar trees
[52:21] and it was more beautiful it was
[52:23] grandeus it was great
[52:25] splendor and as you and as you can
[52:28] follow this you can see that
[52:30] it was god moving towards something he
[52:33] moved from the tent
[52:34] in the wilderness to something a little
[52:36] greater it was a little grander it was a
[52:39] little
[52:39] larger we noticed that temple was also
[52:43] rebuilt
[52:44] we're not preaching on this here today
[52:45] but just to cover it
[52:47] even through nehemiah they would come
[52:49] and rebuild that temple and stand in its
[52:51] glory
[52:52] we know what happens when nebuchadnezzar
[52:55] comes the babylonians come and
[52:57] they take uh the temple and they destroy
[53:00] it and they ransack it and they
[53:02] take all the menorah and the articles of
[53:04] the tabernacle and they
[53:06] completely defile it and destroy it
[53:09] in the days of herod it's rebuilt again
[53:12] and you can go and see a modern-day
[53:14] uh reconstruction of that temple even on
[53:17] a small scale
[53:19] representing solomon's temple but even
[53:21] greater it was
[53:22] larger it and and as it went as as time
[53:25] went on it went further and to greater
[53:28] and greater and greater and more
[53:29] splendor and more grandeur and more
[53:32] beauty and more
[53:33] ah and more outward glory
[53:36] as man always tends to look on the
[53:38] outward beauty
[53:41] until now that temple herod's temple
[53:44] is destroyed and now here stands a
[53:47] little
[53:47] humble brother branham says brother adam
[53:50] says frail
[53:51] little stoop shoulder man from galilee
[53:56] and he says behold i say to you one
[53:59] greater than the temple is before you
[54:01] now
[54:02] and what they didn't realize is that
[54:04] when they seen jesus
[54:06] they seen the temple
[54:09] yet the bible says there was no beauty
[54:11] that we should desire him
[54:14] he was lowly he was meek it wasn't going
[54:17] to be
[54:18] solomon's temple but this is the temple
[54:20] this
[54:21] is the rebuilt tabernacle of solomon
[54:25] of david it was going to be the rebuilt
[54:28] tabernacle
[54:29] he was the son of david now we know that
[54:32] the bible speaks of this and it ties
[54:33] them in with the lineage of david both
[54:35] literally
[54:36] and also spiritually even the spiritual
[54:39] uh seed
[54:40] the the spiritual church is the
[54:43] uh the uh the abraham's seed by faith
[54:46] not literally but by faith
[54:48] we know that brother branham speaks of
[54:49] this and and i want you just to
[54:51] show that if you could the pdf there and
[54:53] this is going to get a little teachy but
[54:55] we're using sunday night for this so
[54:57] don't fall asleep on me i got you some
[54:59] visuals here so you can actually follow
[55:01] along
[55:02] revelations 3 7-13 and to the angel of
[55:05] the church in philadelphia
[55:07] write these things saith he that is holy
[55:11] he that is true he that hath the key of
[55:14] david
[55:14] he that openeth and no man shutteth and
[55:17] sheddeth and no man openeth
[55:18] i know thy works behold i have set
[55:21] before thee
[55:22] an open door and no man can shut it
[55:26] for thou has a little strength and has
[55:27] kept my word and has not denied my name
[55:29] behold
[55:30] i will make them of the synagogue of
[55:32] satan which say they are
[55:34] jews and are not but do lie now let's
[55:36] move on
[55:37] past this if you can to the next
[55:39] paragraph
[55:40] brother branham says in the
[55:41] philadelphian church he says the reason
[55:43] i'm saying this
[55:44] this way so you can see what i mean by
[55:47] the lap over now we're not covering that
[55:49] lap over
[55:50] between the philadelphia and the ladies
[55:52] and age but just follow this closely
[55:54] here
[55:55] he says so you can see what i mean by
[55:56] the lap over see
[55:58] it's from the missionary age of the door
[56:02] but you see he had told them he had the
[56:05] key of david
[56:06] and so forth but here he said he had set
[56:09] before the church now
[56:11] after that age of missionary whitfield
[56:13] and all those
[56:14] others finney sankey moody owned down
[56:16] moody being one of the last
[56:18] come down to now he set
[56:21] an open door before the church
[56:24] here's where you have to watch now it's
[56:26] just in between the philadelphian and
[56:28] ladies and age
[56:30] lap over jesus is the door
[56:34] now if you'll turn with me to john 10 17
[56:37] let's back this up now be sure
[56:39] many of you would believe and then
[56:40] somebody would say well i never he just
[56:42] said that i like to just read it
[56:44] john the 10th chapter the 17th verse all
[56:47] right we have these
[56:48] we read these words he says john uh john
[56:51] 10 7 not 17 then said jesus unto them
[56:54] verily verily i say unto you
[56:56] i am the door of the sheepfold
[56:59] that's back into the blessings how do we
[57:01] get into christ
[57:02] what is he the sheepfold i often
[57:06] wondered about
[57:07] that could he be a door being a man
[57:10] now over in the eastern country there i
[57:13] found out
[57:14] one day when i notice that the shepherd
[57:17] at night time
[57:18] he takes all the sheep inside of the
[57:21] corral
[57:22] drives them through a door and then when
[57:24] he gets
[57:25] all of them in there he counts them all
[57:28] to see if they're
[57:29] everyone in then he lays
[57:32] down in the door himself
[57:36] glory to god nothing can come in to the
[57:40] sheep
[57:41] or any sheep can go out without crossing
[57:43] him so
[57:44] jesus is the door
[57:48] into the sheepfold you say what did it
[57:50] mean when jesus said i
[57:51] am the door what was he speaking of
[57:53] that's why he could say
[57:55] all that the father hath given me and he
[57:58] says will come unto me
[57:59] and i won't lose one of them brother
[58:02] madam said why
[58:03] because he's the pastor he's the pastor
[58:06] of the sheep
[58:07] and the pastor lays down he's the door
[58:10] that's why jesus could say no man can
[58:13] pluck him out of my hand
[58:15] you see it's not you watching over your
[58:17] children's life it's not your father
[58:19] your fathers and mothers love their
[58:21] children but you know who's watching
[58:22] over the seed of god down inside of them
[58:25] not your mistakes not how good you are
[58:27] not how how many times you read them the
[58:29] bible or tell them about jesus that's
[58:31] good
[58:31] but if they're a seed of god god
[58:34] protects his own seed
[58:36] and jesus said i won't lose one of them
[58:39] because i'm protecting their life
[58:42] oh you ought to rejoice in that tonight
[58:44] church
[58:46] he lays down in the door nothing can
[58:48] come into the sheep or any sheep go out
[58:50] without crossing him so
[58:51] jesus is the door oh my
[58:54] he says now it says in isaiah 22 22 and
[58:57] the key of the house of david will lay
[59:00] will i lay upon his shoulder so he shall
[59:03] open none shall shut
[59:05] he shall shut none shall open the spirit
[59:08] uses this old testament reference
[59:10] concerning the lord jesus christ and his
[59:11] ministry in the church
[59:13] what the key of david signified at that
[59:16] time
[59:16] is mere shadow which is now fulfilled in
[59:19] jesus standing in the midst
[59:21] of the lamp stands it has to do with our
[59:25] lord
[59:26] after his resurrection and not his
[59:29] earthly pilgrimage but what does the key
[59:32] signify the answer lies
[59:35] in the position of the key
[59:39] it is not in his hand it is not worn
[59:42] around his neck
[59:43] it's not placed in the hands of other
[59:46] men or the verse could not be
[59:48] saying that he alone has the use of that
[59:50] key
[59:51] for he alone opens and shuts and no man
[59:53] has the right but jesus himself isn't
[59:55] that right
[59:56] but where is the key it's on his
[59:59] shoulder i love how the prophet
[1:00:01] has a way listen to me my brother my
[1:00:03] sister you won't find this
[1:00:04] at dallas theological seminary
[1:00:07] you know where you're going to find this
[1:00:08] from a kentucky 7th grade education
[1:00:10] hillbilly
[1:00:13] who almighty god divinely tabernacled
[1:00:15] and
[1:00:16] spoke through this isn't the my this
[1:00:19] isn't the mind of william branham this
[1:00:20] is the mind of christ
[1:00:22] can you say amen he says it's on his
[1:00:25] shoulder
[1:00:26] but what he says he alone has use of
[1:00:28] that keeper he alone is open shuts the
[1:00:30] door
[1:00:31] but where is the key it's on his
[1:00:32] shoulder but what does the shoulder have
[1:00:34] to do with it
[1:00:36] read isaiah 9 6 and the government shall
[1:00:39] be upon
[1:00:39] his shoulder but what does this mean
[1:00:43] the answer is this the phrase government
[1:00:46] upon his shoulder
[1:00:47] comes from the wedding ceremony
[1:00:50] of the east now he's already pointed to
[1:00:52] the east why did jesus say he was the
[1:00:54] door
[1:00:55] because the over in the eastern culture
[1:00:57] the the the the shepherd
[1:01:00] of the sheep lays down gets all the
[1:01:02] sheep in and then he lays down so he
[1:01:04] becomes the door
[1:01:06] brother madam says now what is it about
[1:01:08] that key of david it's the position of
[1:01:11] the key
[1:01:11] it's not in his hand it's not laying in
[1:01:14] another man's hand
[1:01:15] it's not around his shoulder it's not
[1:01:16] around his neck but it's on his shoulder
[1:01:19] brother branham says it's the government
[1:01:21] it's isaiah 9 6 the government shall be
[1:01:23] upon his shoulder what does this mean
[1:01:25] the answer is this the phrase government
[1:01:27] on a shoulder comes from the wedding
[1:01:29] ceremony of the east when the bride has
[1:01:32] been committed to the groom
[1:01:34] she takes off her veil and place it as
[1:01:38] oh
[1:01:38] places it over the groom's shoulder
[1:01:43] signifying that not only is she
[1:01:46] under his dominion that she has
[1:01:49] transferred her rights to him
[1:01:54] that he is the head
[1:01:58] what do you do when you come to christ
[1:01:59] you lay down your rights
[1:02:02] you lay down your ideas you lay down
[1:02:04] your ambitions you surrender to the
[1:02:06] headship
[1:02:07] of the word and unless you're under the
[1:02:10] headship
[1:02:11] of this word you're not under the
[1:02:13] headship of the hour
[1:02:16] and further than that you're not under
[1:02:17] the protection of the word
[1:02:20] not the headship of a man
[1:02:24] hello not the headship of a bishop
[1:02:28] or an archbish archbishop we have a lot
[1:02:31] of denominational ideas that infiltrate
[1:02:33] the message
[1:02:34] let's let's go back to the word not the
[1:02:37] headship of a man not the headship of a
[1:02:39] of a of a
[1:02:41] of a of a of anybody the headship of
[1:02:44] the word that's your headship
[1:02:48] who's your spiritual husband it's not
[1:02:50] your pastor
[1:02:51] your spiritual husband is christ
[1:02:56] that's what brother branham taught now
[1:02:58] that's not what a lot of men have
[1:03:00] mixed up and confused a lot of people
[1:03:02] with but brother branham said who is
[1:03:04] that
[1:03:04] who is your spiritual husband christ
[1:03:07] no man can take that place you want not
[1:03:10] give any man that place
[1:03:12] man is just that he's fallible he's
[1:03:14] making mess up
[1:03:15] he can fall he can you can be greatly
[1:03:17] disappointed
[1:03:18] because man will fail you but jesus will
[1:03:20] never fail you
[1:03:22] he's the man who never fails he's always
[1:03:24] there he's always faithful
[1:03:27] he says she's transferred her rights to
[1:03:29] him
[1:03:30] he is the head but also that he
[1:03:33] i love this so much because you say
[1:03:36] brother matt what what go
[1:03:37] okay i'm gonna give up my rights when a
[1:03:40] woman
[1:03:40] takes a husband what is she doing she's
[1:03:43] giving up
[1:03:44] her independence and she's giving
[1:03:46] dependence over to a man now that's the
[1:03:49] bible teaching that's not what ladies
[1:03:51] teaches but that's what the word of god
[1:03:52] teaches
[1:03:53] but paul said wives obey your husband
[1:03:56] for its right in the lord even
[1:03:58] the husband is the head of the wife even
[1:04:01] as christ is the head of the church
[1:04:04] and all the men say amen
[1:04:08] but keep reading and he gave himself for
[1:04:12] her
[1:04:13] that's what paul said
[1:04:17] he said as even as christ is the head of
[1:04:19] the church
[1:04:20] and gave himself for the church
[1:04:24] a true man who's the head of his home
[1:04:27] has given himself to his family
[1:04:34] amen
[1:04:37] that's right brother matt preach it you
[1:04:40] say what is
[1:04:42] there you but but you see there's a
[1:04:43] there's there's a beauty
[1:04:46] when you come to christ and you come
[1:04:48] under his headship
[1:04:49] you get a you get something for that
[1:04:52] you're not just giving up the right
[1:04:54] brother brandon says when that woman
[1:04:56] takes the veil and she takes it off and
[1:04:58] she places it on the shoulder
[1:04:59] he says what's it doing it's signifying
[1:05:02] i'm under your head chip
[1:05:03] i'm under your authority i'm under
[1:05:06] you're a dominion
[1:05:07] you're i'm transferring all of my rights
[1:05:09] to you
[1:05:10] that he is the head but not only that
[1:05:12] also i'm glad there was an also
[1:05:15] that he bears the responsibility
[1:05:20] and the care that he and he alone no one
[1:05:23] else no other man
[1:05:24] no other power has any right and
[1:05:27] responsibility
[1:05:28] what do you do when you give yourself to
[1:05:30] jesus you are saying i'm coming under
[1:05:32] your headship
[1:05:33] and you are now responsible for me
[1:05:36] you're responsible for my family
[1:05:38] you're responsible for my care and
[1:05:40] that's why jesus says
[1:05:42] cast your cares upon me for i care for
[1:05:45] you
[1:05:49] and that i love this and that
[1:05:53] uh not sure where you're at there and
[1:05:55] that
[1:05:56] beloved is the key
[1:05:59] of david god
[1:06:03] being sovereign he foreknew by divine
[1:06:06] decree exactly
[1:06:08] who would be in his bride
[1:06:13] that's the key of david because it was
[1:06:15] about a lineage it was about a seed
[1:06:18] it was a seedline of christ and you were
[1:06:20] part of that seed
[1:06:21] that's why brother adam says when you
[1:06:23] heard this message you you left the
[1:06:24] other thing
[1:06:25] you recognized this as eagle food you
[1:06:28] heard from your
[1:06:30] theophany what was that theophany it was
[1:06:33] your representation
[1:06:35] in the word brother adam said it this
[1:06:37] way the word
[1:06:38] in you seen the word
[1:06:43] that'll make a baptist shout shouldn't
[1:06:45] only ought to make message believers
[1:06:47] shout
[1:06:48] the word in you brother madam says the
[1:06:51] word in you
[1:06:52] seen the word and he said there was a
[1:06:54] connection there was a magnetizing
[1:06:57] there was something that pulled you oh
[1:06:59] it wasn't you saying oh well
[1:07:00] you know i just got good enough and i
[1:07:03] guess i was intellectual enough
[1:07:05] come on somebody i guess i was
[1:07:07] intellectual enough to understand the
[1:07:08] message and that's why i see the message
[1:07:10] because i figured it all out for myself
[1:07:12] oh my goodness
[1:07:13] it had nothing to do with you it had
[1:07:15] nothing to do with me
[1:07:17] it was sovereign grace that god called
[1:07:19] me before the foundation of the world
[1:07:21] before i breathed my first breath he
[1:07:23] already ordained me to eternal life
[1:07:28] and when you heard the word you were
[1:07:30] magnetized to the word
[1:07:32] the word seen the word that's what
[1:07:34] brother madam says
[1:07:35] the word in you seen the word there was
[1:07:38] a connection
[1:07:40] beloved that is the key of david god
[1:07:43] being
[1:07:44] sovereign he foreknew by divine election
[1:07:48] by divine decree exactly who would be in
[1:07:51] his bride
[1:07:52] he chose her somebody say it with me
[1:07:56] he chose her
[1:08:00] she did not choose him he called her she
[1:08:03] did not come on her
[1:08:05] own he died for her he washed her in his
[1:08:08] own blood he paid the price for her she
[1:08:12] belongs to him
[1:08:13] and to him alone i say yes lord i belong
[1:08:16] to you
[1:08:17] and to you alone i didn't call me you
[1:08:20] called me
[1:08:20] i didn't save me you saved me i can't
[1:08:23] perfect me
[1:08:24] you've got to perfect me i can't get me
[1:08:26] out of here you got to get me out of
[1:08:28] here
[1:08:28] i can't change my body but the word that
[1:08:31] i believe is
[1:08:32] changing me day by day do you realize my
[1:08:35] friend when your body changed people say
[1:08:37] oh my goodness how
[1:08:39] how it's going to be a miracle
[1:08:40] absolutely it's going to be a miracle
[1:08:44] but let me tell you what you know how i
[1:08:47] know that my body's going to change
[1:08:48] because i'm changing now under the word
[1:08:50] of god
[1:08:53] i'm able to change now
[1:08:57] oh brother adam says he accepts i love
[1:08:59] that she is wholly committed to him
[1:09:02] and he accepts the obligation
[1:09:07] he is her head for christ
[1:09:11] is the head of his church as sarah
[1:09:14] called abraham
[1:09:16] lord even so the bride is happy
[1:09:19] that he is her lord amen
[1:09:23] he speaks and she obeys for that
[1:09:27] is her delight
[1:09:31] behold i stand at the door and knock if
[1:09:32] any man hear my voice
[1:09:34] and open the door i will come into him
[1:09:37] and will sup with him and he with me
[1:09:38] revelations 3
[1:09:39] 20 but let me say this our lord is not
[1:09:42] defeated
[1:09:43] men claim to open the door to god and
[1:09:45] shut that door but they are liars all
[1:09:48] that the father has given me that's what
[1:09:50] brother branham is saying he's saying
[1:09:51] these men
[1:09:52] who who try to take people out from my
[1:09:54] well you're only going to come if you
[1:09:56] come to this certain preacher
[1:09:57] you come to this certain church and
[1:09:58] you're you know men love to preach
[1:10:01] doctrines that that you can only get
[1:10:03] here
[1:10:05] they they love to to draw men unto
[1:10:07] themselves and build kingdoms
[1:10:10] brother and says but they're all liars
[1:10:12] he says they're all
[1:10:14] he says that people say men claim to
[1:10:16] open the door and shut that door
[1:10:18] but they're liars all that the father
[1:10:20] has given him will come to him
[1:10:22] and he that cometh to him in no wise
[1:10:25] will be cast out he will
[1:10:29] lose none amen
[1:10:33] he will lose
[1:10:36] none of them
[1:10:40] he will lose none of them
[1:10:45] you got to let that sink in
[1:10:48] he's not going to lose me he's not going
[1:10:51] to lose my children
[1:10:54] he's not going to lose my family because
[1:10:57] and you know what that does
[1:10:58] he accepts that obligation
[1:11:04] brother branham says and when the last
[1:11:07] elected
[1:11:07] member to the body of christ comes in
[1:11:11] then will our lord
[1:11:14] appear the key of david
[1:11:18] was not david the king of israel all
[1:11:20] israel and it's not
[1:11:21] jesus the son of david according to the
[1:11:23] fact that he will sit upon the throne of
[1:11:25] david
[1:11:26] in the millennium and reign and rule
[1:11:28] over his heritage
[1:11:29] surely so the key of david signifies
[1:11:32] that it is jesus who will bring in the
[1:11:35] millennium
[1:11:36] he who has the keys to death and hell
[1:11:40] will raise up his own that they may
[1:11:43] share in his reign of righteousness
[1:11:47] upon the earth glory to god
[1:11:50] what a difference when you look at this
[1:11:53] throne of david
[1:11:55] versus the throne of solomon you can
[1:11:56] take that down now
[1:11:58] i want to show you something here in the
[1:12:00] scripture and then we're just going to
[1:12:02] read just a few here and you could have
[1:12:03] them ready to display on the screen
[1:12:07] one of the most tragic stories you'll
[1:12:09] read about him we're going to get to it
[1:12:10] lord willing next sunday
[1:12:12] one of the most tragic men the life
[1:12:15] story
[1:12:16] of a man now you can read the life of
[1:12:18] david and there's
[1:12:19] sad parts to it but as many for as many
[1:12:23] low lights there's highlights and and
[1:12:26] i've got uh
[1:12:27] uh uh you can you can look at stories of
[1:12:29] jacob and you could see
[1:12:30] low lights but you could also see
[1:12:33] highlights sadly
[1:12:34] this man here is ends his life
[1:12:38] uh in a low light but i believe we can
[1:12:41] learn so much
[1:12:41] from him this man is not a judas
[1:12:45] that i'm about to read to you about he's
[1:12:47] not a judas who betrayed the lord
[1:12:50] and had such evil in his heart he sold
[1:12:52] the lord for money
[1:12:54] he's not a herod who was a murderer who
[1:12:56] tried to murder the seed of god
[1:12:58] he's not a hater at all he's not a he's
[1:13:01] not an evil contentful man this
[1:13:04] story that you read about but oh
[1:13:06] actually this man was the very
[1:13:08] son of david the king of jerusalem
[1:13:13] and he himself became a king he said
[1:13:15] brother matt who is that that's this man
[1:13:17] we read about
[1:13:18] solomon the bible says
[1:13:22] that years before bethlehem now you you
[1:13:25] can take this story and we're not going
[1:13:26] to be
[1:13:27] nearly have enough time to to
[1:13:30] uh to to to to to go through every
[1:13:33] aspect of his life i just want to
[1:13:34] capture this the portion
[1:13:36] here before we close you see because
[1:13:39] this man rejected the voice of god or i
[1:13:42] could even go further than that
[1:13:44] and i can say that this man failed to
[1:13:47] accept
[1:13:48] christ in his life you say brother matt
[1:13:51] solomon was an old testament believer so
[1:13:54] how could he fail to accept christ well
[1:13:56] brother branham said this
[1:13:57] brother branham says jesus christ is in
[1:14:00] every verse of the bible
[1:14:04] and he says and if you don't see jesus
[1:14:06] in every verse you need to go back and
[1:14:08] read it again
[1:14:10] hello so every type and everything
[1:14:14] you read about all of it was a
[1:14:15] foreshadowing now these men
[1:14:17] lived a parabolic life they had no idea
[1:14:21] that their life was literally living a
[1:14:24] parable
[1:14:25] they were that you take the life of
[1:14:27] joseph joseph had no
[1:14:29] idea that when he was being cast into
[1:14:32] prison
[1:14:32] when he was being sold by it to his bro
[1:14:35] by his brothers to raiders when he was
[1:14:37] down in a cave joseph had no idea
[1:14:40] that he was living a parable he was
[1:14:42] living a type
[1:14:44] of christ
[1:14:47] you can you can read about all of the
[1:14:49] whatever character you want to name
[1:14:51] jonah had no idea that when he died
[1:14:54] in the belly of a well when he's laying
[1:14:57] down there in the slobber and in the
[1:14:59] guts and the organs of a fish
[1:15:02] he had no idea that his life was a
[1:15:04] parable
[1:15:06] his life was a type he went and lived
[1:15:09] that life in the belly of a well so that
[1:15:12] jesus could stand stand centuries later
[1:15:14] and say that even as
[1:15:15] jonah was in the belly of the well for
[1:15:18] three days and three nights so the son
[1:15:19] of man
[1:15:20] shall go into the go into the bosom of
[1:15:23] the earth
[1:15:24] now he had no idea he had no idea his
[1:15:29] life that he was just
[1:15:30] living every day ordinary life
[1:15:33] he had no idea that his life was
[1:15:35] typified
[1:15:37] shadowing christ
[1:15:42] i thought that was wonderful
[1:15:45] he had no idea his life he was living
[1:15:47] very normal life now
[1:15:50] you you say what what is what is solomon
[1:15:53] here the bible says that jesus was
[1:15:55] revealed
[1:15:56] throughout the entire bible not just the
[1:15:58] new testament
[1:15:59] but even throughout the old testament it
[1:16:01] points us to one thing to christ
[1:16:03] it was on the road to emmaus that the
[1:16:06] bible says that christ jesus
[1:16:08] begins to reveal to cleopas and his
[1:16:10] disciples
[1:16:11] the bible says it this way and beginning
[1:16:14] at moses
[1:16:17] that's what the bible says and beginning
[1:16:19] at moses and all the prophets he
[1:16:21] expounded to them
[1:16:23] in all of the scriptures the things
[1:16:26] concerning
[1:16:27] himself i'd have loved to been there for
[1:16:30] that sermon
[1:16:33] you want to talk about a teacher of
[1:16:34] teachers being able to break down the
[1:16:36] word in every type and anti-type
[1:16:39] and the bible says this is how what did
[1:16:40] he do now jesus didn't even realize that
[1:16:43] jesus when jesus was a little baby boy
[1:16:45] two and three years old he had no idea
[1:16:47] who he was
[1:16:49] but there came some day when brother
[1:16:51] branham says when he began to read the
[1:16:53] scriptures and he began to read the
[1:16:54] scrolls
[1:16:55] he had to recognize himself
[1:16:59] in the word just as you have to
[1:17:01] recognize yourself
[1:17:05] at what age did jesus realize or
[1:17:08] recognize
[1:17:09] until one day he's at the temple and
[1:17:11] he's his mother loser says where were
[1:17:13] you
[1:17:13] and he says don't you know i should be
[1:17:15] about my father's business
[1:17:18] not speaking of joseph now he's speaking
[1:17:20] of his heavenly father
[1:17:22] even down to the point to where brother
[1:17:24] branham says when he realized
[1:17:26] what day did he realize that he was the
[1:17:30] sacrificial atoning lamb that would take
[1:17:32] away the sins of the world
[1:17:34] to the point to where he recognized his
[1:17:36] place in the word
[1:17:38] and said father if it be possible let
[1:17:40] this cup pass for me
[1:17:41] nevertheless not my will but thine be
[1:17:43] done
[1:17:45] he said brother matt that means he was a
[1:17:47] man aha
[1:17:50] he was in fact you say well he was only
[1:17:54] some man brother man said no he was 100
[1:17:57] man and he was 100 percent god
[1:18:02] he was the god man
[1:18:07] i love the prophet's english he was the
[1:18:09] god man
[1:18:11] he was 100 percent god he was 100
[1:18:14] percent man brother and i says don't you
[1:18:15] ever let anybody tell you he wasn't a
[1:18:18] man
[1:18:20] but don't you ever let anybody tell you
[1:18:22] that he was anything
[1:18:23] short of deity
[1:18:28] brother branham says he says what was he
[1:18:30] he was more than a man he says he was a
[1:18:31] man when he
[1:18:32] when he wept at the tomb of lazarus and
[1:18:35] he says but when he
[1:18:36] those little shoulders went back and he
[1:18:38] said lazarus come
[1:18:40] forth he said that was more than a man
[1:18:41] speaking
[1:18:43] amen but he began to expound to them
[1:18:47] all of the scriptures oh even
[1:18:50] even from from moses all the way to the
[1:18:53] prophets
[1:18:54] that's why the bible says i think it's
[1:18:55] in first corinthians he says
[1:18:57] paul says that they all did eat of that
[1:19:00] same
[1:19:00] manna remember that paul says they all
[1:19:03] did eat of that spiritual food
[1:19:04] they drank of that same spiritual rock
[1:19:07] for they
[1:19:08] drink of that spiritual rock and that
[1:19:10] rock was
[1:19:11] christ
[1:19:14] that rock that followed them in the
[1:19:16] wilderness was
[1:19:17] christ it's all
[1:19:21] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:19:24] and forever he was the rock in the
[1:19:28] wilderness he followed them they ate and
[1:19:29] drank the spiritual food jesus said i
[1:19:31] am that bread that came down from heaven
[1:19:35] so even solomon himself the bible says
[1:19:38] even for
[1:19:39] a while uh this this solomon here
[1:19:42] starts with a good desire a man who the
[1:19:45] bible says that he magnified the lord
[1:19:47] magnified before all the people he
[1:19:50] greatly
[1:19:51] increased this man solomon the bible
[1:19:54] says that solomon had
[1:19:56] prayed and asked the lord for wisdom god
[1:19:58] had granted him
[1:19:59] this prayer we know brother man preaches
[1:20:01] queen of sheba and he talks about the
[1:20:03] discernment
[1:20:04] gift that laden solomon that she would
[1:20:05] come all the way from the east
[1:20:07] east on this multi-night journey on
[1:20:10] camels throughout the
[1:20:11] through the desert and risk her life
[1:20:13] just to have a few minutes
[1:20:16] under the wisdom of this great man
[1:20:20] solomon but there came a time in
[1:20:24] solomon's life where
[1:20:25] something you even read about the song
[1:20:28] of solomon if you go back and you read
[1:20:29] and you study
[1:20:30] the song of solomon it's it's known in
[1:20:33] the jewish bible as the song of songs
[1:20:36] and it was it was it was oh you you read
[1:20:39] all the way from the first chapter all
[1:20:41] the way to the end you'll see a
[1:20:42] a dramatic story you know
[1:20:46] you'll hear solomon speaking about the
[1:20:49] banqueting table and
[1:20:50] and and he begins to speak about his
[1:20:53] beloved
[1:20:54] in the chambers and solomon uh begins to
[1:20:57] speak about the banner of love that was
[1:21:00] over him i'm not going to read some of
[1:21:01] these scriptures out of the song of
[1:21:02] solomon
[1:21:03] but the bible says that he speaks about
[1:21:05] the rose of sharon
[1:21:07] and and he sees the lily of the valley
[1:21:09] he sat under the wings of the almighty
[1:21:12] the god was no doubt and solomon had a
[1:21:15] relationship in some way
[1:21:17] a connection like david his father had a
[1:21:19] connection
[1:21:21] with the holy spirit his delight had
[1:21:24] been the voice of his beloved
[1:21:28] as solomon speaks about the voice of his
[1:21:31] beloved
[1:21:33] and solomon begins to speak about this
[1:21:37] banqueting table and he sat under the
[1:21:39] banner of love he
[1:21:40] had great wisdom and in his spirit
[1:21:43] he communed with the holy spirit and and
[1:21:46] and no doubt
[1:21:47] no doubt solomon for his in his in his
[1:21:50] younger years
[1:21:51] in the youth of his life lived with the
[1:21:53] fervency before
[1:21:55] god had a great desire to build the
[1:21:57] house of the lord
[1:21:59] but there came a time in this man's life
[1:22:01] song of solomon 2 10
[1:22:03] solomon notice what he says rise up my
[1:22:05] love my friend
[1:22:06] my fair one and come away
[1:22:10] solomon what was he what was he speaking
[1:22:13] of he was
[1:22:14] he was preaching about this relationship
[1:22:17] with christ
[1:22:18] this relationship with the holy spirit
[1:22:21] this
[1:22:21] satisfaction to his soul the spiritual
[1:22:24] drink
[1:22:25] the spiritual bread this
[1:22:28] atmosphere this enrapturing filling
[1:22:32] and solomon to begin to speak about this
[1:22:35] in in and
[1:22:36] to chapter 2 verse 17 he says turn my
[1:22:38] beloved so notice what it was
[1:22:40] it was a call it's all about solomon who
[1:22:43] begins to speak about the little foxes
[1:22:46] you remember that the little foxes that
[1:22:49] spoil
[1:22:50] the vine
[1:22:53] it was a call to get rid of the foxes
[1:22:56] that was spoiling his vine
[1:22:58] it was a call to reach out into the deep
[1:23:01] and the great
[1:23:02] spiritual pastures of revelation and
[1:23:05] behold the lord
[1:23:07] high and lifted up solomon was hearing
[1:23:11] from the voice of his beloved a call to
[1:23:14] satisfy delight thyself in the lord
[1:23:22] he says in solemn song of solomon 2 17
[1:23:26] turn my beloved and be thou like a row
[1:23:30] or a young deer upon the mountains come
[1:23:32] and pan
[1:23:33] after the beloved as the deer pants for
[1:23:36] the water
[1:23:37] on mount bathur so solomon hears
[1:23:41] this this man this calling of god it was
[1:23:44] a life that he
[1:23:45] he lived it was a reality that he had
[1:23:48] it was something that he even begins to
[1:23:51] speak about further in that same
[1:23:52] chapter and and says come away my love
[1:23:56] come away arise and come with me
[1:23:59] it was this solomon who sat at the queen
[1:24:02] of sheba sat at his feet as we said
[1:24:04] and began to hear of his spiritual
[1:24:06] wisdom
[1:24:09] oh but he was a man who was highly
[1:24:11] sought after brother branham says
[1:24:12] greatest man in the east
[1:24:14] even jesus would speak of him and say
[1:24:16] behold a greater than solomon is here
[1:24:20] but with all of that limelight all of
[1:24:23] that
[1:24:24] pomp all of that prestige
[1:24:27] there needs to be character
[1:24:31] so brother man i said power without
[1:24:32] character satanic put a man in a
[1:24:34] position without the character to handle
[1:24:36] that position
[1:24:37] and it becomes evil something that could
[1:24:40] be used for a good
[1:24:42] becomes used for a bad
[1:24:46] it's been ministry that's destroyed the
[1:24:48] lives of a lot of people ministry a good
[1:24:50] thing that should offer
[1:24:51] healing and hope and encouragement and
[1:24:53] restoration
[1:24:54] and salvation and deliverance but that
[1:24:57] same ministry
[1:24:58] can be used for destruction
[1:25:03] and and can tear lives down can tear
[1:25:05] people's confidence down
[1:25:08] it was all of this pomp and all of this
[1:25:11] center stage
[1:25:12] wealth he was wealthier than any man in
[1:25:14] the world
[1:25:15] had all the money you could ever want in
[1:25:18] life
[1:25:21] he had been lifted up and lifted up
[1:25:24] and as i said in the spotlight the
[1:25:27] sinner say
[1:25:27] the sinner stage but now
[1:25:31] the bible says that at the latter years
[1:25:33] of his life in the later years of
[1:25:35] solomon's life he begins to become
[1:25:38] a very callous man
[1:25:41] you read about it in ecclesiastes you
[1:25:43] can read about it and even in the
[1:25:44] proverbs some of the things solomon
[1:25:46] begins to get almost maniacal
[1:25:48] almost just in serious and the way he
[1:25:50] says certain things
[1:25:52] you know it's all vanity and and what
[1:25:54] good is life and
[1:25:55] you you you build up all of this wealth
[1:25:57] it's all vanity
[1:26:00] and it begins to become a very i have no
[1:26:03] other way to say it than this way
[1:26:04] a very lustful man
[1:26:09] very lustful man
[1:26:12] in his elder years in the twilight
[1:26:16] of his life
[1:26:19] it would be the little foxes
[1:26:22] that spoiled the vine the bible says he
[1:26:26] takes to himself the scripture says
[1:26:30] wives and we know we know the story
[1:26:32] without having to get too much into it
[1:26:34] here today but the bible says he had
[1:26:37] 700 wives 300
[1:26:41] concubines couldn't get enough
[1:26:44] it goes on further in first kings i'm
[1:26:46] going to have you read this first kings
[1:26:47] 11 verse 1.
[1:26:51] if you have your bible just use it there
[1:26:54] and if they have it on the screen for
[1:26:55] those who who don't that'd be just fine
[1:26:57] first kings 11.
[1:27:07] but king solomon loved many strange
[1:27:11] women together with the daughter of
[1:27:12] pharaoh you can move to verse
[1:27:14] 2. of the nation's nations concerning
[1:27:17] which the lord said unto the church of
[1:27:18] israel you shall not go into them
[1:27:20] neither shall they come in unto you for
[1:27:21] surely they will turn away your heart
[1:27:24] after their gods solomon
[1:27:27] clave that word clave is the same thing
[1:27:31] that paul says he says don't you know
[1:27:33] that
[1:27:34] he who takes in a harlot becomes one
[1:27:36] with the harlot
[1:27:38] he takes it into his bosom it becomes
[1:27:41] one flesh he
[1:27:42] clave unto it it's a knitting together
[1:27:46] and solomon becomes knitted together as
[1:27:49] only
[1:27:50] love emotional love has a way to knit
[1:27:53] you
[1:27:54] and you you cleave it's an addiction it
[1:27:56] becomes something that can't be
[1:27:58] easily broken
[1:28:02] it's a lust in his life to where it's
[1:28:04] more than just something he dabbles in
[1:28:06] or messes up
[1:28:07] but now he takes the bible says and he
[1:28:09] claim notice
[1:28:11] verse one again and and the the previous
[1:28:14] verse to that he took in many strange
[1:28:16] women
[1:28:17] of the nations what the lord said in the
[1:28:18] churches you shall not for they will
[1:28:20] turn away your heart
[1:28:21] after their gods this is exactly
[1:28:24] what happens
[1:28:28] imagine that
[1:28:33] now you said by the man who was this man
[1:28:35] this was one
[1:28:37] of the most gifted men
[1:28:40] on the planet hello somebody
[1:28:44] one of the most gifted men god
[1:28:48] gifted
[1:28:51] one of the most gifted it doesn't matter
[1:28:54] how great your
[1:28:55] gift how great your talent how great
[1:28:58] your ability
[1:29:00] unless you're under the subjection of
[1:29:03] the holy spirit
[1:29:05] brother adam says it power without
[1:29:07] character satan become satanic
[1:29:10] but power with character is fit to rule
[1:29:13] you see that in david versus solomon
[1:29:17] but the tabernacle of solomon was
[1:29:19] sensual
[1:29:21] as we see he loves many women and the
[1:29:24] bible says he was
[1:29:26] notice what it was one of the most
[1:29:28] gifted men on the earth
[1:29:29] but he was trying to get the best out of
[1:29:31] both worlds
[1:29:33] to have one foot in the world one foot
[1:29:35] in the church door one foot on the bar
[1:29:37] stool
[1:29:39] one foot with the church people one foot
[1:29:41] with the social people
[1:29:42] social of the world and
[1:29:45] and the bible says that he would he
[1:29:48] wanted the lord
[1:29:49] no doubt you can read that in the song
[1:29:51] of solomon he wanted his beloved
[1:29:53] but you know what he wanted to he wanted
[1:29:55] the little foxes too
[1:29:57] you can't have both can of both
[1:30:02] little foxes will spoil the vine every
[1:30:05] single time
[1:30:07] he wanted both and the bible says that
[1:30:12] that he takes takes this in it came to
[1:30:14] pass
[1:30:15] verse 4 brother jeremy and it came to
[1:30:18] pass when solomon was old
[1:30:20] that his wives turned away his heart
[1:30:22] after the other gods
[1:30:23] and his heart was not perfect with the
[1:30:26] lord
[1:30:26] his god and solomon verse 6 did evil
[1:30:32] in the sight of the lord and went
[1:30:35] not
[1:30:38] what a word and solomon did
[1:30:43] evil in the sight of the lord and went
[1:30:46] not
[1:30:48] fully in other words it wasn't that he
[1:30:51] didn't go after the lord it's that he
[1:30:53] didn't go
[1:30:54] fully fully comes from the word
[1:30:58] full i know that's deep
[1:31:04] he didn't go fully after the lord he
[1:31:07] wasn't
[1:31:08] fully committed he kept just a portion
[1:31:15] he didn't go fully after the lord as did
[1:31:19] david his father in other words what was
[1:31:21] the difference between solomon
[1:31:23] and david yes they had both had mistakes
[1:31:26] the difference was is david went fully
[1:31:28] after the lord
[1:31:30] david wasn't trying to live in sin and
[1:31:32] live in the church he wasn't trying to
[1:31:34] live for god for his beloved
[1:31:36] and have his foxes too david might have
[1:31:38] made mistakes
[1:31:39] i make make i make many mistakes you
[1:31:41] make many mistakes
[1:31:42] but i say lord my heart is fully after
[1:31:44] you i don't desire to do those things
[1:31:47] i don't have it in my heart i may mess
[1:31:49] up tomorrow morning but it's not in my
[1:31:52] heart oh god
[1:31:53] my heart is to serve you oh can you say
[1:31:55] amen tonight
[1:31:56] my heart is to love you lord my heart is
[1:31:58] to be a servant of the lord though i may
[1:32:00] might make many mistakes
[1:32:03] brother baron i make so many mistakes
[1:32:05] sister bruce said
[1:32:06] oh sister bruce sister bruce god doesn't
[1:32:09] look at your mistakes
[1:32:12] god looks at your heart
[1:32:15] i'm so thankful for that
[1:32:20] lord the bible says notice this
[1:32:24] and solomon and evil not went fully
[1:32:25] after the lord as david there
[1:32:27] as did david his father
[1:32:34] come away i thought about that i read
[1:32:37] that
[1:32:37] this morning solomon voice of my beloved
[1:32:41] come away my love my fair one come away
[1:32:45] but yet there was something holding
[1:32:46] solomon back how many times as the voice
[1:32:49] of the lord spoke to you and said come
[1:32:50] away
[1:32:52] come away fully come away commit fully
[1:32:55] jump all in
[1:32:56] get don't don't just come ankle deep
[1:32:58] don't just come knee deep don't just
[1:32:59] come
[1:33:00] out uh a neck deep get all the way into
[1:33:03] where you're floating in christ
[1:33:06] but something holds you back
[1:33:10] he went not fully after
[1:33:13] him first kings 11 verse 9 the lord was
[1:33:16] angry with solomon
[1:33:18] verse 9 brother jeremy first kings 11.
[1:33:22] and the lord was angry with solomon
[1:33:27] first kings 11 and the lord was angry
[1:33:30] with solomon
[1:33:31] because his heart was turned from the
[1:33:33] lord god of israel first kings 11
[1:33:35] 9 that's second kings first kings 11
[1:33:38] and the lord was angry with solomon
[1:33:40] because
[1:33:42] his heart was turned from the lord god
[1:33:46] of israel which had appeared unto
[1:33:50] him more than once
[1:33:54] that's all you've got to read more than
[1:33:56] once brother madam says how many times
[1:33:58] is god obligated to come knocking on
[1:34:00] your heart's door
[1:34:01] once and if he ever knocks again it was
[1:34:04] grace
[1:34:04] and i'm here to say i am the product of
[1:34:07] not one knock
[1:34:08] but two and three and four and five and
[1:34:10] six and seven i'm a product of grace
[1:34:13] that he kept knocking on my heart's door
[1:34:18] the bible says he came knocking
[1:34:21] he he appeared unto him twice the lord
[1:34:23] god was angry
[1:34:25] with solomon because his heart was
[1:34:27] turned from the lord god which had
[1:34:28] appeared unto him twice he had
[1:34:30] jeopardized
[1:34:31] everything that he had he was going to
[1:34:32] give it all up
[1:34:35] with everything in his life now that
[1:34:37] kingdom that god had established through
[1:34:40] solomon
[1:34:40] was going to be ripped from solomon and
[1:34:43] given unto another man
[1:34:45] i would start another vicious cycle i'm
[1:34:47] going to preach about that lord willing
[1:34:48] next sunday
[1:34:49] it would start a pattern and a cycle
[1:34:51] from this one man
[1:34:52] would spin off just worse and worse and
[1:34:55] worse a spiraling effect
[1:34:59] all because the little foxes that
[1:35:02] spoiled
[1:35:03] his vine and that kingdom would be
[1:35:05] ripped
[1:35:06] from solomon god says i'm going to take
[1:35:09] it away
[1:35:10] every single bit of it away because why
[1:35:12] you've went after strange gods
[1:35:14] you've lost your anointing because of
[1:35:16] sin because sin always destroys the
[1:35:19] anointing of god out of your life
[1:35:20] sin always takes the anointing of god
[1:35:24] out of your life always
[1:35:29] you say i don't feel close to the lord i
[1:35:30] i just feel so
[1:35:32] distant how do you think you feel why do
[1:35:34] you think you feel that way
[1:35:35] jesus god says your sins have have
[1:35:38] separated you between you and your god
[1:35:41] that he will not hear
[1:35:44] god had lifted his hand
[1:35:48] from solomon and from that day when god
[1:35:51] lifted his hand the hedge that he puts
[1:35:54] around his
[1:35:55] children was was removed
[1:35:58] the bible says and the lord stirred up
[1:36:01] an adversary
[1:36:02] verse 14. notice this and the lord
[1:36:06] stirred up an adversary unto solomon
[1:36:08] haddad the edomite
[1:36:11] verse 23 the bible says and god stirred
[1:36:14] up another adversary
[1:36:16] raison the son of eleadah notice what
[1:36:19] was god going to do he was going to
[1:36:21] stir up an adversary
[1:36:27] to try to get his attention
[1:36:30] imagine that god is going to raise
[1:36:33] enemies
[1:36:34] to get his son's attention
[1:36:38] the bible says ch all chastisement
[1:36:41] judgment
[1:36:41] god judges sin and jesus says in
[1:36:45] revelations 3 as many as
[1:36:47] i love i rebuke
[1:36:50] and chastise be zealous therefore
[1:36:55] that's the admonishment be zealous
[1:36:57] therefore and repent
[1:37:00] but chastisement comes from the lord
[1:37:02] many times we blame it on the devil
[1:37:04] and it's actually our heavenly father
[1:37:06] who knows what's best
[1:37:08] many times some of the chastisement god
[1:37:10] sends people in our life to chastise us
[1:37:14] i know that hurts but it's the word
[1:37:19] many times god sends it and we blame it
[1:37:22] we blame it on satan we blame it on the
[1:37:23] devil we blame it on demon spirits
[1:37:26] and no doubt many times it is but god
[1:37:29] raises up an
[1:37:30] adversary to get solomon's to get
[1:37:32] solomon's attention you imagine if you
[1:37:34] were that king
[1:37:35] and suddenly one day you woke up and you
[1:37:38] just were irritated
[1:37:39] at solomon didn't know why but something
[1:37:43] in you said i want to attack that guy
[1:37:46] i had no idea but god was inspiring that
[1:37:48] man to do that
[1:37:51] the bible says it this way to harass him
[1:37:56] to harass him and even though the worst
[1:38:00] of that even out of his own household
[1:38:02] when jeroboam the bible says the servant
[1:38:05] of the son of a servant
[1:38:07] lifted up his hand against first kings
[1:38:09] 11
[1:38:10] verse 26. notice this was an associate
[1:38:13] of solomon someone he had trusted put in
[1:38:16] charge of his house
[1:38:19] but this man stabs him in the back
[1:38:23] he stat he he he he he
[1:38:26] murders assassinates his character
[1:38:29] rebels against him
[1:38:31] and now solomon doesn't just have
[1:38:32] enemies on the outside now he has
[1:38:34] enemies on the inside you say why
[1:38:36] how did this happen because the hedge of
[1:38:38] god the hedge of protection was removed
[1:38:40] from his life
[1:38:41] because the anointing was out of his
[1:38:42] life because he didn't go
[1:38:44] fully after the lord
[1:38:49] there was something in his heart a place
[1:38:52] in his heart
[1:38:53] that he held a as we spoke this morning
[1:38:57] about ananias and sapphira just to hold
[1:38:59] just
[1:38:59] a little bit back
[1:39:03] yet the lord christ here the holy spirit
[1:39:06] had
[1:39:07] appeared to him twice anointed him
[1:39:10] gifted him gave him a mighty gift a
[1:39:13] mighty
[1:39:14] desire a mighty gift of wisdom
[1:39:19] and now because of sin the bible says
[1:39:22] that solomon goes in the latter part of
[1:39:24] his life
[1:39:25] the twilight of his life and he builds
[1:39:27] the high places of shemath
[1:39:29] and of bell of of of
[1:39:32] strange gods this was
[1:39:36] david's son
[1:39:40] but how very different he was
[1:39:43] how very different he ran his church how
[1:39:45] very different he conducted himself
[1:39:48] how very different he looked in the
[1:39:50] mirror and viewed himself than how david
[1:39:52] when he looked in the mirror and viewed
[1:39:53] himself
[1:39:55] his perception was different his
[1:39:57] attitude was different
[1:39:59] solomon almost in every way
[1:40:02] was so different than his father
[1:40:06] the bible says it that way that he
[1:40:07] didn't go fully after the lord
[1:40:09] as did david his father
[1:40:14] and now he says in in ver in chapter
[1:40:16] five song of solomon
[1:40:18] chapter five brother jeremy verse six if
[1:40:21] you want to put that
[1:40:21] up on the screen i opened
[1:40:25] now this is solomon speaking here i
[1:40:27] opened to my beloved
[1:40:30] but my beloved had withdrawn himself
[1:40:34] and was gone i
[1:40:38] opened to my beloved but now solomon's
[1:40:41] gonna start to tell you about his life
[1:40:43] i opened but my beloved had withdrawn
[1:40:46] himself
[1:40:48] and was gone my soul felled
[1:40:52] when he spoke i sought him but i could
[1:40:55] not find him
[1:40:56] i called him but he gave me
[1:40:59] no answer do you know that what happens
[1:41:03] to solomon
[1:41:04] is exactly what david feared what
[1:41:06] happened to himself
[1:41:08] after the sin with bathsheba
[1:41:11] and that's why david prays in psalms 51
[1:41:13] and says
[1:41:14] cast me not away from thy presence oh
[1:41:16] god
[1:41:17] don't take your holy spirit from me
[1:41:22] david wasn't saying that casually he was
[1:41:24] a man
[1:41:25] stricken with fear to say that
[1:41:28] one of the one of one of the most
[1:41:30] fearful things that could ever happen to
[1:41:32] me
[1:41:33] is for the lord to withdraw himself from
[1:41:35] my life
[1:41:38] oh i believe that to every believer here
[1:41:40] tonight
[1:41:41] we should say cast me not away from that
[1:41:43] presence o lord
[1:41:45] it should be one of the most fearful
[1:41:47] things
[1:41:48] for the holy spirit to withdraw
[1:41:52] from your life
[1:41:56] i could lose a lot but don't let me lose
[1:41:58] his presence
[1:42:02] he says i called to him but he gave me
[1:42:06] no answer
[1:42:09] you say oh that's wha what a what a
[1:42:12] what a tragedy but but don't forget
[1:42:15] friends this was
[1:42:16] this was solomon's choice
[1:42:19] this wasn't this wasn't an unfortunate
[1:42:21] event that happened to him
[1:42:23] it was his decision
[1:42:26] to take upon wives of strange gods
[1:42:28] concubines and take on more and more and
[1:42:30] more
[1:42:31] it's a pitiful man it's a pitiful state
[1:42:35] to be in as i
[1:42:36] as i preach this to you here tonight
[1:42:38] what a pitiful man
[1:42:41] who out of one side of his mouth wants
[1:42:43] the lord
[1:42:44] wants communion wants god but he wants
[1:42:47] his foxes too
[1:42:50] he wants to live for the lord oh i want
[1:42:51] that so much for my life oh i desire it
[1:42:53] so much but deep down inside he still
[1:42:55] wants to cling to his idols
[1:42:58] what a condition to be in
[1:43:03] on one side he's over here this was
[1:43:06] lusting
[1:43:07] on the other side he still wants to have
[1:43:08] the presence of
[1:43:10] his beloved but you can't have both
[1:43:14] you can't serve god and mammon you can't
[1:43:16] be with one foot in the world and one
[1:43:18] foot in church
[1:43:20] you can't sit on the fence you can't be
[1:43:23] jesus said i would rather you be
[1:43:24] hot or cold but because you're lukewarm
[1:43:27] i'll spew you out of my mouth
[1:43:34] he goes further than that solomon
[1:43:38] says here and i want you to as i turn a
[1:43:40] corner here to stay
[1:43:41] with me here this is going to be just a
[1:43:42] few more minutes
[1:43:44] notice solomon he he begins to lose
[1:43:48] the vision you notice this later in his
[1:43:51] life he loses his vision of his beloved
[1:43:54] the lord hadn't answered when he called
[1:43:56] because his sin had
[1:43:57] separated him between him and his god he
[1:44:00] had lost his love
[1:44:02] for the lord and he had gained lust
[1:44:05] for the world he
[1:44:08] the bible says begins to beget he was
[1:44:11] he was drunk literally drunk
[1:44:14] on the wine of lust
[1:44:19] whether has he gone if you find my
[1:44:20] beloved tell him i am heartsick for him
[1:44:23] he says
[1:44:24] but the substance is not there it is now
[1:44:26] a shadow a memory
[1:44:28] on the other side of the window beyond
[1:44:30] the lattice i
[1:44:31] see him notice what solomon is
[1:44:33] describing i see him through the lattice
[1:44:35] i catch his picture
[1:44:36] on the other side of the window i see
[1:44:38] him but he's distant from me
[1:44:42] it wasn't because the lord wanted to be
[1:44:44] distant it wasn't because the lord
[1:44:46] wanted to be ten miles away it's because
[1:44:47] your sin
[1:44:48] separated you between you and your god
[1:44:52] and you say brother matt how what would
[1:44:54] it have taken for solomon to get back to
[1:44:56] restored fellowship
[1:44:58] repentance it would have been that fast
[1:45:03] it would have been that quick you heard
[1:45:04] brother branham in the prayer line with
[1:45:05] that sister
[1:45:06] and and he comes up and the sisters
[1:45:08] comes up and just crying nervous brother
[1:45:09] man and says oh you're so worried sister
[1:45:11] he says you've fallen away from grace he
[1:45:12] says you've fallen away you've backslid
[1:45:14] he says now you now now who knows what
[1:45:16] this sister had done
[1:45:17] but he says you're away from the lord
[1:45:19] you're distant from the lord and you can
[1:45:21] hear yes sir brother and that's right
[1:45:22] yes sir brother
[1:45:23] you're distant from the lord right now
[1:45:24] he says now sister he says now
[1:45:26] you want to you want to come back she
[1:45:28] says yes he says you're back
[1:45:31] you're back just like that no get down
[1:45:34] on your knees and cry
[1:45:35] he says you want to be you're distant
[1:45:36] from the lord you're away from the lord
[1:45:38] you want to be back this is how quick
[1:45:39] you're going to be back
[1:45:40] you're back just like that brother
[1:45:44] branham says that rock that followed
[1:45:45] them in the wilderness he says though
[1:45:47] they went sinning though they turn and
[1:45:48] heart in their hearts
[1:45:49] he says yet that rock followed them all
[1:45:52] the way through the wilderness
[1:45:53] it was never going to leave them it was
[1:45:55] always there all the time
[1:45:56] and brother branham says where is
[1:45:58] restored fellowship it's right around
[1:46:00] the corner all you've got to do is
[1:46:01] repent
[1:46:03] and it doesn't take days it doesn't take
[1:46:05] months it doesn't take years
[1:46:07] it can happen in an instant out of
[1:46:10] fellowship with god but now with the
[1:46:12] desire
[1:46:12] to be back in fellowship with god you're
[1:46:14] back
[1:46:17] i say hallelujah that's my god
[1:46:21] that's the god that i serve he doesn't
[1:46:23] make me do penance and hail mary's and
[1:46:26] and and do all kinds of things to be
[1:46:28] restored and if you want to be restored
[1:46:30] tonight and you feel distant and far
[1:46:32] away from god
[1:46:32] he's right here right now ready to
[1:46:35] restore you
[1:46:38] all you got to say is lord i want to
[1:46:39] come home i want to come back
[1:46:42] and with the true repentant heart god
[1:46:44] says you're back
[1:46:46] just like that you're back
[1:46:51] but he says i see i seen
[1:46:54] through the lattice oh what a
[1:46:57] description
[1:47:01] i seen through the window
[1:47:06] the same man who in first kings chapter
[1:47:10] 8
[1:47:11] says the lord god of israel there's no
[1:47:13] god like thee
[1:47:15] this is solomon who keepest
[1:47:18] covenants covenant and mercy with thy
[1:47:20] servants that walk before
[1:47:22] thee with all their hearts who shut the
[1:47:24] heavens when thy people sin against thee
[1:47:27] and when a man shall know the plague of
[1:47:28] his own heart
[1:47:29] and shall call on the lord he will
[1:47:31] forgive if a man sins and god is angry
[1:47:34] if he return with all his heart and soul
[1:47:36] god will
[1:47:38] hear and forgive
[1:47:41] this is solomon then the lord will never
[1:47:44] forsake or
[1:47:45] leave him but will maintain the calls
[1:47:50] of his servant
[1:47:56] ecclesiastes 12 1 solomon
[1:48:01] says remember the lord
[1:48:04] while you are young for the day will
[1:48:07] come when you will find
[1:48:08] no more pleasure in anything
[1:48:13] remember now thy creator in the days of
[1:48:15] the youth while the evil days come not
[1:48:17] nor the years draw nigh when thou shalt
[1:48:19] say i have no
[1:48:20] pleasure in them emptiness
[1:48:24] vanity brokenness that's how this man
[1:48:28] i i'm sorry i wish i could
[1:48:32] i wish i had a good highlight to give
[1:48:33] you
[1:48:35] i wish his life didn't end that way but
[1:48:37] this is what the bible says
[1:48:41] he turns away from his beloved
[1:48:46] solomon becomes a builder he spends time
[1:48:50] you notice
[1:48:51] his life is spent with uh you know
[1:48:53] planning and building
[1:48:54] and planning and grandeur and splendor
[1:48:57] and he's contracting all of this work

[1:49:02] he's going to build a great big grand he
[1:49:04] has this great
[1:49:05] vision this great man of great vision
[1:49:08] and inspiration
[1:49:10] and and is going to build this great
[1:49:12] house of the lord
[1:49:14] you notice all of the solomon's kingdom
[1:49:17] even today it's spoken of by
[1:49:19] by secular historians would say that
[1:49:23] that solomon had the most grandeus
[1:49:25] glorious kingdom
[1:49:28] it was grand just it was glorious
[1:49:31] it was it was a he was a man of great
[1:49:34] projects

[1:49:40] to come away my love my fair one come
[1:49:43] away
[1:49:45] no time to come to the lord and spend
[1:49:48] just a moment
[1:49:49] with his beloved he wanted to build this
[1:49:52] magnificent
[1:49:53] pools and vineyards and gardens and
[1:49:56] orchards

[1:50:00] years building a magnificent
[1:50:03] glorious palace

[1:50:18] and fortresses and
[1:50:19] stone cities and and great watchtowers

[1:50:57] and 12
[1:50:58] 000 horsemen josephus
[1:51:02] historian jewish historians said his
[1:51:04] chariot drivers had long
[1:51:06] flowing hair powdered with gold dust and
[1:51:09] wore
[1:51:09] tunics of purple
[1:51:13] except for the matt while the
[1:51:14] description because i'm trying to get
[1:51:15] you to understand
[1:51:16] this was a man who had all of his
[1:51:18] priorities in the wrong place
[1:51:21] you can build such a beautiful wonderful
[1:51:24] outward christian image
[1:51:28] but be so dead on the inside
[1:51:32] you can build such a wonderful beautiful
[1:51:35] perfect refined message lifestyle
[1:51:40] and have all of your teas crossed and
[1:51:43] all of your
[1:51:44] eyes dotted but miss the most
[1:51:48] important thing it wasn't the glory
[1:51:52] of the gold that made your temple great
[1:51:55] solomon
[1:51:56] it wasn't the splendor of your purple it
[1:51:59] wasn't the scarlet
[1:52:00] that made that gave the glory to the
[1:52:02] temple what gave the glory to your
[1:52:04] temple solomon
[1:52:06] was the holy spirit that would come and
[1:52:08] dwell in that inner tabernacle that's
[1:52:10] what brought glory
[1:52:14] and let me say this to you my brother my
[1:52:16] sister it is
[1:52:17] your hair's hair style your long hair
[1:52:19] your long dresses your
[1:52:21] your your lifestyle and whatever however
[1:52:23] you want to describe your descriptors
[1:52:25] if that's not your glory it speaks of a
[1:52:28] greater glory that's within
[1:52:29] it is the life behind the name that
[1:52:32] makes the demons tremble
[1:52:35] and i say god give us good a good clean
[1:52:38] holy
[1:52:39] ghost life but make sure lord let us
[1:52:42] make sure that our people are not just
[1:52:44] stan images on the outside but let us
[1:52:47] have a reality of christ on the inside
[1:52:49] of our hearts
[1:52:50] can you say a man tonight is that how
[1:52:53] you feel tonight
[1:52:54] to say lord give me more than an image i
[1:52:57] want more than an
[1:52:58] image i want more than a story i want
[1:52:59] the literal life
[1:53:02] of the holy spirit i want the outside to
[1:53:06] be a reflective
[1:53:07] reflector of a god who's on the inside
[1:53:13] can you say a man
[1:53:17] such glory such splendor
[1:53:21] but oh he comes to the end even even the
[1:53:23] queen of sheba
[1:53:24] the bible says she was left breathless
[1:53:29] when she beheld solomon's magnificent
[1:53:32] splendor
[1:53:33] the way his men conducted himself the
[1:53:35] way they went up his cupbearers
[1:53:37] those who set the table sorry queen if
[1:53:39] she was just
[1:53:40] gasped she she's left without anything
[1:53:43] to say love breathless the bible says
[1:53:48] but what she doesn't know is that she
[1:53:50] leaves
[1:53:51] and solomon descends and devolves
[1:53:54] into one of the most loneliest
[1:53:57] coldest calloused
[1:54:02] men that you read about in the bible
[1:54:08] all of all of his projects
[1:54:11] all of his glory are you still here am i
[1:54:13] okay
[1:54:14] going a little bit longer i hope that's
[1:54:15] okay here tonight for sunday night
[1:54:19] all of his projects all of all of
[1:54:22] everything that he had built
[1:54:24] all everything that he had yet he ends
[1:54:27] his life
[1:54:29] just disillusioned disillusioned with
[1:54:32] life
[1:54:34] some of the things he begins to say
[1:54:36] about life they're almost
[1:54:39] suicidal go read it in ecclesiastes
[1:54:43] just dark and as he he
[1:54:46] comes to the very end of his of his life
[1:54:49] and his heart grows cold
[1:54:54] he begins he becomes so backslidden
[1:54:58] all he could he could say in all of his
[1:55:00] projects all of his labor
[1:55:02] he says in ecclesiastes 2 10 my heart
[1:55:04] rejoiced in all my labor
[1:55:06] labor but but then you find him in
[1:55:09] ecclesiastes 2 verse 11
[1:55:11] he says then i looked on all the work
[1:55:13] that my hands had wrought
[1:55:15] and all that i had accomplished and
[1:55:16] behold all was
[1:55:18] vanity and vexation of spirit and there
[1:55:21] was no prophet under the sun therefore i
[1:55:23] hated
[1:55:24] life the work that i did became a grief
[1:55:29] to me he says in verse 20 i was left
[1:55:32] in despair what a what a what a life
[1:55:36] how sad a man with vision a man with
[1:55:39] drive a man with a dream a man with a
[1:55:42] man with a plan
[1:55:43] a man with great inspiration
[1:55:47] but a man with great pomp and great
[1:55:49] glory and great limelight
[1:55:53] and at the end of it all solomon says
[1:55:56] it was all a it waste
[1:56:00] all a waste you know but there was such
[1:56:03] a difference
[1:56:04] in that attitude and the attitude of the
[1:56:07] apostle paul
[1:56:08] when apostle paul says all of the
[1:56:10] education learned under gamalia
[1:56:12] learned in the greatest schools but i
[1:56:14] counted it all as dung
[1:56:16] that i may know him paul said it was all
[1:56:20] wasted it was all wasted only what's
[1:56:22] done for christ matters
[1:56:27] how very different how very sad this man
[1:56:30] was in his life how very
[1:56:34] different this solomon tabernacle
[1:56:37] represents the spirit of the age we live
[1:56:40] in the bible says that america
[1:56:43] the spirit of the american age the
[1:56:45] american church
[1:56:46] brother branham said it was a lukewarm
[1:56:48] cold formal
[1:56:49] powerless church that named religion
[1:56:52] that had all the religious acts and all
[1:56:55] of the religious code had all
[1:56:57] said all the right things but was cold
[1:57:00] formal
[1:57:01] and powerless a church of america like
[1:57:04] very much like
[1:57:05] solomon a sensual
[1:57:08] a sensual church solomon the son of
[1:57:12] david we read at the beginning ii
[1:57:14] chronicles 1 1
[1:57:15] was strengthened in his kingdom the lord
[1:57:16] as god was with him and he magnified him
[1:57:18] greatly very much like the prosperous
[1:57:21] church today
[1:57:23] who has all of the greatest temples and
[1:57:25] greatest churches and greatest
[1:57:27] choirs and oh they don't call them
[1:57:28] choirs now they call them bands worship
[1:57:29] bands
[1:57:31] all the greatest worship bands and all
[1:57:33] the cool preachers and all of the
[1:57:34] their cool genes that are faded and has
[1:57:37] holes in them would you like if i preach
[1:57:38] like that to you
[1:57:41] came in here holy blue jeans literally
[1:57:44] holy
[1:57:47] they have the greatest coolest
[1:57:48] hairstyles and coolest
[1:57:50] you know bands and and greatest you know
[1:57:52] in the greatest
[1:57:53] um uh pyrotechnics and
[1:57:56] and and smoke generators and blue lights
[1:57:59] and red lights and
[1:58:00] and every kind of light color you could
[1:58:02] think of
[1:58:03] to get the people going to hype them up
[1:58:05] to get them going
[1:58:08] prosperous yet they take those churches
[1:58:11] and they fill up
[1:58:12] with thousands and thousands and
[1:58:15] thousands of people
[1:58:17] and so much they have a eight o'clock
[1:58:18] service and 9 o'clock service at 10
[1:58:20] o'clock service 11 o'clock service
[1:58:23] just to fit everybody into here now let
[1:58:26] me ask you something what do you think
[1:58:27] they're preaching
[1:58:31] it's amazing because they say they're
[1:58:34] preaching
[1:58:34] the gospel of jesus christ well when
[1:58:37] jesus preached his gospel
[1:58:39] it got him crucified when paul preached
[1:58:43] that gospel
[1:58:43] it got his head cut off when peter
[1:58:46] preached that gospel got him hung upside
[1:58:48] down on a cross yet somehow when they
[1:58:49] preach that gospel
[1:58:51] it fills up the church with thousands
[1:58:52] and thousands and thousands of people
[1:58:56] ought to tell you what they're preaching
[1:58:58] that's why paul would say
[1:59:00] i am not ashamed of the gospel of jesus
[1:59:03] christ
[1:59:05] and he would only make that statement
[1:59:08] if there was something that the world
[1:59:10] looked as shameful
[1:59:12] are you here that was free it wasn't on
[1:59:15] my notes so
[1:59:16] you don't owe me nothing for it
[1:59:20] but it's a modern type of today it's
[1:59:23] the ladies in church great greater and
[1:59:26] knowledge the bible says ever learning
[1:59:29] but never able to come to the knowledge
[1:59:31] of the truth more information
[1:59:32] greater eloquence greater teaching
[1:59:36] greater uh articulate speakers
[1:59:40] with great rivers of wealth of
[1:59:42] information
[1:59:45] with great wealth of information from
[1:59:48] theology schools
[1:59:49] they can speak just to get a doctorate i
[1:59:51] think
[1:59:52] our master in theology i forget to think
[1:59:54] you got to speak five
[1:59:56] four languages whatever it is
[1:59:59] and and they they come with the grant of
[2:00:00] the greatest education out of the
[2:00:02] greatest cemeteries i mean seminaries as
[2:00:05] brother branham would say
[2:00:07] with some of the greatest teaching and
[2:00:09] and some of them i respect no i'm not
[2:00:12] to to to be careful here for a minute
[2:00:14] i'm not disparaging those people
[2:00:16] i'm disparaging that system because
[2:00:19] there's good
[2:00:20] people there's people going to heaven in
[2:00:23] that
[2:00:24] church oh yeah
[2:00:28] brother adam says i'm not against the
[2:00:30] people it's the spirit i'm crying out
[2:00:32] again
[2:00:36] but you notice here even the wisdom
[2:00:39] of solomon's gospel it was so different
[2:00:42] this is this is
[2:00:43] so so different than the way god looks
[2:00:46] at wisdom
[2:00:47] the bible says first corinthians 1 verse
[2:00:50] 21 for after that the scripture we read
[2:00:53] for after that in the wisdom of god the
[2:00:55] world by wisdom knew not god
[2:00:58] it pleased god by the foolishness of
[2:01:00] preaching
[2:01:01] to save them that believe
[2:01:05] in whom colossians 2 3 in whom are hid
[2:01:08] all the treasures of wisdom and
[2:01:10] knowledge
[2:01:12] yet when you look at solomon the bible
[2:01:14] says and he spoke
[2:01:16] 3 000 notice this first kings 4 verse 32
[2:01:20] and he spoke thousand proverbs his songs
[2:01:23] were a
[2:01:24] thousand and five and he spoke of trees
[2:01:27] from the cedar tree if you could first
[2:01:29] kings chapter four
[2:01:30] verse 32 and he spoke of three thousand
[2:01:33] proverbs the songs this is solomon here
[2:01:36] i still got you for maybe 10 more
[2:01:37] minutes is that okay
[2:01:39] and he says he spoke of 3 000 proverbs
[2:01:42] his psalms were a thousand and
[2:01:44] five verse 33 and he spoke of trees
[2:01:48] from the cedar tree that is in lebanon
[2:01:50] even unto the hyssop that springeth out
[2:01:52] of the wall
[2:01:53] he spoke also a beast and a fowl and of
[2:01:56] creeping things
[2:01:58] and of fishes this was solomon's gospel
[2:02:01] three thousand we could call
[2:02:04] sermonettes
[2:02:08] spoke of trees and cedar trees of
[2:02:10] lebanon and hyssop and
[2:02:11] springeth out of the wall he spoke of
[2:02:13] beast and a fowl
[2:02:14] and of creepy things proverbs good
[2:02:16] proverbs very good
[2:02:17] very good love love going through the
[2:02:19] book of proverbs read some of the most
[2:02:21] greatest insights on life out of
[2:02:23] proverbs some that i'm sure you've not
[2:02:25] even read before
[2:02:27] but yet all of this notice this what
[2:02:30] this was
[2:02:31] great applications of truth you can read
[2:02:33] many through the book of proverbs get
[2:02:34] good marital advice
[2:02:36] get good child rearing advice
[2:02:38] destruction our instructions on
[2:02:40] how to cope and how to behave how to be
[2:02:42] blessed
[2:02:44] solomon was a great preacher great
[2:02:47] gifted
[2:02:49] gifted preacher very articulate
[2:02:52] but he lacked one thing an anointing
[2:02:58] and brother when you lack the anointing
[2:03:00] of the holy ghost you could have all the
[2:03:01] greatest phrases all of the greatest
[2:03:03] uh instructions on wisdom you could have
[2:03:05] some of the most articulate things
[2:03:07] but if it lacks the unction of the power
[2:03:10] of the holy ghost
[2:03:11] paul said when i came to you i came not
[2:03:13] in the
[2:03:14] excellency of man's speech but i came in
[2:03:17] power and demonstration
[2:03:19] of the holy spirit we don't need more
[2:03:22] sermonettes with greater theology
[2:03:24] we need the power of the holy ghost i
[2:03:27] say lord
[2:03:28] don't just give us great fancy sermons
[2:03:30] and beautiful
[2:03:31] stories that make people cry give us the
[2:03:34] power of the holy ghost
[2:03:36] and don't just give me an emotion where
[2:03:37] i just speak in tongues that's good
[2:03:39] but let that power be able to have the
[2:03:42] power to break the grip of the enemy
[2:03:44] off people's lives let that power of the
[2:03:47] holy ghost be
[2:03:48] powerful enough to save the unbeliever
[2:03:51] oh can you say a man tonight let our
[2:03:53] preaching
[2:03:54] save and convict the sinner let it fill
[2:03:57] him with the baptism of the holy ghost
[2:04:00] i say god give me a gospel that can
[2:04:02] cause me to live above sin
[2:04:04] give me a salvation that gives me a
[2:04:07] nature that's not my own nature but a
[2:04:09] nature that lives like
[2:04:11] jesus lived
[2:04:15] you believe that what a difference
[2:04:19] this was what a difference
[2:04:23] oh my i can just become so joyful
[2:04:26] thinking about this
[2:04:27] when i think of the difference between
[2:04:29] solomon's sermons
[2:04:31] and david's sermons the bible says david
[2:04:35] the driving what was the driving force
[2:04:37] behind
[2:04:38] david's ministry david's the driving
[2:04:41] force
[2:04:42] the core the center was one thing total
[2:04:45] and complete dependence on the holy
[2:04:50] ghost
[2:04:52] total and complete dependence
[2:04:55] on the unction first samuel chapter 16
[2:04:58] verse 13 first samuel 16 13.
[2:05:02] then samuel took the horn of oil
[2:05:06] and anointed him in the midst notice
[2:05:09] it doesn't say that he took david and
[2:05:11] sat him in a school
[2:05:12] before theologians and scribes and
[2:05:15] educated david
[2:05:16] and made sure he could rehearse and
[2:05:18] recite the hebrew language no
[2:05:20] the bible says he anointed him with an
[2:05:22] anointing oil
[2:05:23] what was the power and might of david it
[2:05:26] wasn't his intellect
[2:05:28] it was his god who he served it was the
[2:05:31] mighty god
[2:05:32] who stood behind a little man named
[2:05:34] david
[2:05:36] it was an anointing upon his life
[2:05:39] you believe the word saying man to the
[2:05:41] word
[2:05:43] when david was on his deathbed he comes
[2:05:44] to solomon and he says in second samuel
[2:05:47] chapter 23 verse 2
[2:05:50] he comes to last words he's going to
[2:05:52] speak to his son
[2:05:54] he's going to say this is this is this
[2:05:57] is what gave me
[2:05:59] my success solomon
[2:06:03] i want to tell you why god has blessed
[2:06:05] me
[2:06:07] are you hearing me tonight david says i
[2:06:10] want to tell you
[2:06:11] why my kingdom has been established why
[2:06:13] god could save david
[2:06:15] for for your kingdom will be established
[2:06:17] your throne
[2:06:18] will be established forever
[2:06:23] your throne oh david will be established
[2:06:26] forever
[2:06:28] why was my throne established forever
[2:06:30] what was the key to my success
[2:06:32] second samuel 23 verse 2. i want to tell
[2:06:35] you solomon
[2:06:37] i want you to know the secret of my life
[2:06:40] what unlocked
[2:06:41] the key what unlocked the door my
[2:06:44] kingdom is at peace
[2:06:46] solomon why god has blessed me
[2:06:48] everywhere i've went
[2:06:49] everywhere i've gone this is my last
[2:06:51] words to you solomon
[2:06:53] i'm gonna give you the secret the spirit
[2:06:55] of the lord
[2:06:56] spoke by me notice what god says it
[2:07:00] wasn't the wisdom of man
[2:07:02] it wasn't your intellect it wasn't your
[2:07:03] great stories of trees and hyssop of
[2:07:06] lebanon and beast of the field and fouls
[2:07:08] it was the spirit of the lord spoke by
[2:07:10] me
[2:07:12] and his word his word
[2:07:15] his word was in my tongue
[2:07:20] oh that ought to make you shout tonight
[2:07:23] i said his spirit was upon me solomon
[2:07:26] this was the key to
[2:07:28] my success
[2:07:32] the spirit of the lord spoke by me and
[2:07:35] his word was in my tongue
[2:07:38] i wonder if you could say tonight lord i
[2:07:41] don't need education i don't need great
[2:07:44] uh
[2:07:44] great pomp and great limelight and great
[2:07:46] glory and great
[2:07:47] outside grandeur i need the spirit of
[2:07:49] the lord
[2:07:50] to speak by me and i need your word to
[2:07:53] be on my tongue
[2:07:54] i need your thoughts to be my thoughts i
[2:07:56] need your actions
[2:07:58] oh can you raise a hand and say lord i
[2:08:00] need that tonight god
[2:08:01] i need this word i need this message
[2:08:03] spoken by
[2:08:04] a prophet i need that word to come live
[2:08:07] through me o god
[2:08:11] the spirit of the lord spoke by me what
[2:08:13] was david saying david said i didn't
[2:08:15] trust in my own ability
[2:08:16] i didn't trust in my own knowledge i
[2:08:18] didn't trust in my own gift
[2:08:19] i didn't trust in any part of my flesh
[2:08:21] because when i did
[2:08:22] my flesh messed up my flesh disappointed
[2:08:25] me
[2:08:25] i found myself empty and broken nothing
[2:08:28] but a failure
[2:08:29] oh i was a weak man solomon i wasn't a
[2:08:32] strong man on the outward since i was a
[2:08:34] weak man
[2:08:35] full of faults full of failures but i
[2:08:37] depended on the holy ghost
[2:08:39] and every word when i spoke was the word
[2:08:42] of the lord his words
[2:08:46] filled my mouth my speech
[2:08:51] oh musicians could you return first
[2:08:53] corinthians chapter 2
[2:08:55] verse 4 paul says in my speech
[2:08:58] and my preaching was not with enticing
[2:09:01] words of man's wisdom stand to your feet
[2:09:03] if you could
[2:09:04] paul says in first corinthians 2 verse 4
[2:09:07] he says in my
[2:09:08] speech and my preaching was not with
[2:09:12] enticing words of man's
[2:09:14] wisdom i love this
[2:09:17] but in demonstration of the spirit
[2:09:21] and of power let me read that again to
[2:09:24] you
[2:09:26] my speech this is paul and my preaching
[2:09:30] was not with enticing words
[2:09:33] of man's wisdom
[2:09:37] let me tell you something
[2:09:42] brother branham's speech was not
[2:09:44] enticing words of man's wisdom
[2:09:49] wasn't how well he spoke how articulate
[2:09:51] he was
[2:09:53] paul says but in demonstration
[2:09:58] of the spirit and of power
[2:10:02] and i say god make me a believer
[2:10:08] that that has the demonstration and the
[2:10:11] power of the holy spirit
[2:10:13] [Music]
[2:10:15] let my life be more than just outside
[2:10:18] action outside of words
[2:10:21] just just saying the right things the
[2:10:23] right phrases memorizing
[2:10:25] oh that's good that's good to memorize
[2:10:26] good to good to know the word very good
[2:10:29] but lord let that be come off of ink on
[2:10:32] paper
[2:10:32] let it become a life that's lived out
[2:10:34] can you want do you want that
[2:10:36] say lord let it become beyond a tape
[2:10:38] that i hear it goes into my
[2:10:40] ear and then i goes into my mind then i
[2:10:42] reason it then i think about it
[2:10:43] let it drop further than my mind let it
[2:10:45] drop into my heart oh god
[2:10:48] may that word become anointed fresh
[2:10:53] bow your heads with me if you could
[2:10:54] every have doubt ever i closed
[2:10:58] i want to build the rebuild
[2:11:02] i want to be a tabernacle of david how
[2:11:06] many could say that by an uplifted hand
[2:11:08] not of solomon oh i could i could
[2:11:10] reflect
[2:11:11] tonight oh as all of you can we can
[2:11:14] reflect on how
[2:11:16] our life may be in certain ways you
[2:11:18] could identify and say i've been right
[2:11:20] where he was
[2:11:23] that my life has been reflective more of
[2:11:25] solomon
[2:11:26] maybe distant sometimes from the lord
[2:11:30] from the holy spirit maybe
[2:11:31] felt like i was just sinning through the
[2:11:33] lattice seeing him out the window
[2:11:36] but oh god that's not what's in my heart
[2:11:39] my heart's to be in that
[2:11:40] secret inner chamber and fellowship with
[2:11:43] you
[2:11:44] one on one and that holiest of holies
[2:11:47] where that word becomes real
[2:11:50] where that word becomes more than a
[2:11:52] cliche
[2:11:54] where it becomes more than a lifestyle
[2:11:56] more than a dress code
[2:11:58] more than just a law more than a book of
[2:12:00] laws if i do and i don't and i do and i
[2:12:03] don't
[2:12:03] i want to i want to go and let that veil
[2:12:05] drop behind me i want to go to that
[2:12:07] inner chamber
[2:12:08] i want it to be an automatic life by the
[2:12:11] holy spirit
[2:12:12] directing me calling me controlling me
[2:12:15] anointing me choosing uh choosing where
[2:12:18] i go where i don't go what i say what i
[2:12:20] don't say
[2:12:22] oh i see hands lifted up all over the
[2:12:24] building god you see all those hands
[2:12:26] identified
[2:12:27] you see the desire of their heart lord
[2:12:29] is the desire of mine
[2:12:30] as i raise my hands up with every single
[2:12:32] one of them how i can identify many
[2:12:35] times lord

[2:13:01] thing when i
[2:13:02] could have said the right thing how many
[2:13:05] times lord i've
[2:13:06] i've failed you lord over and over and
