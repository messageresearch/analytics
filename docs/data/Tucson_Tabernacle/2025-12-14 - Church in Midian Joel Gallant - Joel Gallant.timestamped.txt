[17:48] something like that. Pray for sister
[17:50] Margaret. Um, brother Glenn Tamlinson,
[17:53] Sister Martha's dad. Um, I didn't uh I
[17:59] think it's he was taken to the hospital
[18:00] this morning for high blood pressure,
[18:02] right? Pray for brother Glenn. Brother
[18:04] Glenn's a dear friend to all of us.
[18:08] Brother Heath Rickard called me this
[18:09] morning. My friend, he is having back
[18:12] problems. He won't he said he won't be
[18:14] in service this morning, but he asked
[18:16] that we would pray for his back. He'll
[18:18] be he said he'll be streaming in. And
[18:21] then my aunt Jacqueline Wheeler, she um
[18:25] was taken to the hospital yesterday with
[18:28] um some uh complications. Didn't know
[18:30] exactly what was wrong, but by the grace
[18:33] of God, the tests that she had last
[18:35] night came back. everything was good.
[18:38] So, she's um she's doing a lot better
[18:40] this morning. She's still in the
[18:41] hospital. Looking forward to her coming
[18:43] home. Brother Joe Miller writes uh from
[18:47] his wife, Sister Elizabeth, that she's
[18:49] going to the eye doctor
[18:52] um and with a plan on having surgery
[18:57] and uh she said that the medicine that
[19:00] she's taking is still causing her pain.
[19:03] And brother Joe also writes,
[19:06] "I talked to my uncle Stephen yesterday.
[19:10] He's 70 years old. He lost an apartment,
[19:14] everything, and even the cat, even his
[19:17] cats.
[19:19] He sleeps in a church in California, in
[19:22] Susanville, California. and uh he asked
[19:26] that we would pray that the Lord would
[19:28] provide for him for at least a hotel to
[19:32] stay in. And then sister Millia,
[19:37] she writes that uh she has a praise and
[19:40] it says this. She says, "Last week my
[19:42] car broke down at Fries and God sent me
[19:45] an angel to re to my rescue once again.
[19:48] He drove my car to the repair shop and
[19:51] left it in there and he got it fixed.
[19:55] um and uh took me took me back and the
[19:58] mechanic went and got me and brought me
[20:00] back within all within five hours and
[20:03] she had her car back and running. She
[20:04] said, "Thank you so much."
[20:08] [applause]
[20:12] You know, Sister Melia
[20:16] is a widow and she relies a lot
[20:21] on the Lord. probably as much or more
[20:24] than anyone else in this building.
[20:27] And it's sister Millia, it's a good
[20:29] place to be that you have to put so much
[20:32] trust in God.
[20:34] And he always provides, doesn't he?
[20:36] Amen. He does.
[20:39] Brothers and sisters, if you have a
[20:41] request on your heart, I I'd also like
[20:44] to um mention brother Steven Young, the
[20:47] uh the church that we are helping that
[20:50] our church is helping in South Africa.
[20:52] He [music] is having a tent revival this
[20:55] next week and he asked for our prayers.
[20:58] It's going to be two or three days that
[21:00] they're going to be ministering and
[21:01] trying to call sinners in Durban, South
[21:03] Africa. So if we could remember him and
[21:05] and friends,
[21:07] it's not just something that we do.
[21:11] If you have a request on your heart,
[21:15] you have something that you need from
[21:16] the Lord,
[21:18] make it known to him right now with an
[21:21] uplifted hand and say, "Lord, I need
[21:23] something. I could really use some
[21:26] help." He sees [music] those hands.
[21:29] Our father,
[21:32] you are wonderful, Lord. We thank you
[21:34] for your goodness and mercies to us.
[21:37] Lord, we thank you for Sister Amelia and
[21:40] how Father, you have always met her
[21:42] every need just like you have all of us.
[21:44] And we never want to neglect to say
[21:46] thank you.
[21:48] Thank you for what you did for her. And
[21:50] and Lord, we bring these requests before
[21:53] you, some very serious requests that you
[21:56] would make a way, Father, that they
[21:58] would just be placed at [music] your
[22:00] feet.
[22:02] Lord, that your healing hand or your
[22:04] miracle working hand would be upon each
[22:07] request. And Lord, that you would have
[22:09] your way and your will would be done.
[22:11] And with each uplifted hand, Lord, we
[22:13] place it into your into your hands that
[22:15] that it's it's much better if it's in
[22:18] your hands, Lord, and it's out of our
[22:20] hands. So, we give it to you, Father,
[22:23] and ask, Lord, that your will would be
[22:25] done in your time and in your way. And
[22:29] Lord, let us just be obedient servants,
[22:31] but we do trust in you, oh God, because
[22:34] you always come through. And Lord, bless
[22:36] the offering we pray. May it Lord be
[22:40] used in wise and productive ways to
[22:43] further your kingdom in Jesus name.
[22:46] Amen. Amen. God bless you. You can be
[22:49] seated.
[22:51] I'll just uh I'll make a couple
[22:52] announcements. Um first, we have um
[22:58] I mentioned brother Steven Young and the
[23:00] work that he's doing in South Africa. He
[23:03] is going to be having a tent meeting and
[23:05] I I assume it's a result of our offering
[23:07] that we gave last month. So keep brother
[23:10] Steven in prayer and uh we will be as
[23:14] long as the Lord leads this way. We will
[23:16] be taking an offering once a month to be
[23:18] sent to Durban, South Africa for that
[23:20] ministry there. That will be next week
[23:23] that we'll take up that offering. So,
[23:25] next Sunday morning, the offering will
[23:28] go to the work that Brother Steven is
[23:30] doing there. And um just uh while I'm up
[23:36] here, usually it's one of the trustees
[23:38] or one of the deacons that that prays
[23:40] over the offering. The offerings that we
[23:43] have that that we take, these go to um
[23:49] they go to a number of things. They go
[23:51] to pay our visiting ministers. When we
[23:53] have um when we have somebody like
[23:56] brother Joel come in and bringing him
[23:58] here and paying for the expenses there.
[24:00] They go towards any special events that
[24:02] we might have. If we buy the the meat
[24:05] for a potluck or anything like that
[24:08] comes from our offerings. The tithing is
[24:10] different. The tithing will be used for
[24:15] the big expenses, the renovations for
[24:18] the church where um where the the bigger
[24:20] money has to go. That's where that's
[24:22] where the tithing that we take. And then
[24:24] an offering is something that you give
[24:27] out of your generosity above you above
[24:29] and beyond your tithing and that goes to
[24:32] these special projects and um even for
[24:35] things for the kids and that type of
[24:37] thing. So, the difference right there
[24:38] between the tithing and the offering.
[24:42] Um, next Sunday, I'm really excited.
[24:45] Next Sunday evening, I want to see I
[24:48] want to see you here, young lady. We're
[24:50] going to do what we're calling
[24:51] children's church. The kids right now,
[24:54] they're up in Sunday school. But, um,
[24:56] this is going to be dedicated to our
[25:00] young people. We're going to We need
[25:02] song specials. Brother Jordan is going
[25:04] to be leading in the worship. We uh I'm
[25:08] even trying to I'd like to get one of
[25:10] our young men boys to even maybe give us
[25:14] a little testimony or even preach a
[25:18] little five or 10 minute sermon. How
[25:19] fun, how nice would that be? Um so
[25:22] that's going to be next Sunday evening.
[25:24] It'd be a good one to invite your
[25:27] friends to any any young people that
[25:29] that you think would uh would enjoy it.
[25:31] And then next Sunday morning, we'll have
[25:33] our Christmas service. And then the
[25:35] following um Wednesday we'll have
[25:38] service because I believe that's
[25:39] Christmas.
[25:41] Um again looking forward to next Sunday
[25:44] evening on children's church and I'll
[25:47] teach a short lesson also on um over
[25:51] there and everybody come and enjoy. It's
[25:54] not just for the kids. We'll maybe have
[25:56] the kids sit in the front but
[25:59] they are so cute whatever they do. So,
[26:02] let's make sure that we we support him.

[26:43] a blessing to us. Um this morning we're
[26:47] going to sing a few more songs of
[26:48] worship before brother Joel takes the
[26:51] pulpit. But I just want to give my love
[26:55] and my appreciation to this young
[26:58] brother that's going to be ministering
[26:59] for us this morning. French his native
[27:02] language. He's from Quebec. And uh he
[27:05] and I met in I believe it was in we've
[27:09] probably met before, but uh the most
[27:12] striking time that that I remember him
[27:15] is in 2017. We had an outreach meeting
[27:18] in a small town called Cornwall.
[27:21] Um French
[27:23] speak uh it's just over the border,
[27:25] right? It's English. Yeah, it's
[27:27] bilingual there. And uh it was just a it
[27:31] was um outreach. There was this a
[27:35] brother had it on his heart to do a uh
[27:39] have a meeting in this little town and
[27:42] we went there and it was it was really
[27:45] it was a tremendous success and I was
[27:48] one of the speakers and afterwards
[27:53] brother Joel approached me and we had a
[27:57] short conversation.
[27:59] Sometimes
[28:01] the uh the multitude of words isn't
[28:03] necessarily the importance of a
[28:05] conversation. It's the quality of the
[28:07] words. And our conversation was so
[28:12] striking to me that I've never
[28:14] forgotten.
[28:15] He expressed his appreciation for
[28:20] lifting up our Lord and Savior Jesus
[28:22] Christ. And that was the start of a
[28:25] friendship that we've had until this
[28:27] time. I've spoken to his church. He's
[28:29] going to give a small report from his
[28:31] church if the Lord's willing when he
[28:33] speaks. But I just want to I just want
[28:36] to say that I have a lot of respect, a
[28:39] lot of admiration
[28:41] for brother Joel and a lot of
[28:44] confidence. So I hope that you have very
[28:47] very high expectations this morning
[28:49] because I do. Daniel.
[28:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let us stand this morning. We're
[28:56] going to Great is our God.
[29:01] &gt;&gt; The splend. [singing]

[29:18] [music] Let all the earth rej.
[29:24] He wraps himself
[29:27] in light.
[29:31] The darkness [singing]
[29:33] tries to hide.

[29:42] his voice.
[29:45] And how [music] great [singing]

[33:44] You are great Lord. Amen.
[33:48] Hallelujah. Good morning.
[33:51] &gt;&gt; May God bless you richly this morning.
[33:55] Amen.
[33:57] I think you may be seated for a minute.
[34:00] It's a
[34:03] a great honor for me to stand here and
[34:06] to be with you this morning as I hope
[34:08] you can cope with my friend English this
[34:11] morning. Um, yeah, you can see the
[34:14] accent here, but uh I pray God anoint I
[34:18] pray God will anoint the words coming
[34:20] out of my mouth into your heart this
[34:22] morning.
[34:23] &gt;&gt; Wherever you're at, whatever the
[34:25] condition you came to church this
[34:27] morning that something may be spoken
[34:30] that speaks directly to your heart and
[34:32] your condition. It's my prayer. And um
[34:36] as brother Dan mentioned, we've been
[34:38] friends
[34:39] uh for quite a few years now. and um
[34:44] and I truly admire his work and I I'm so
[34:47] honored to be here this morning and and
[34:50] have really a burn on my heart and and I
[34:54] hope that by the time of the the end of
[34:57] the service this morning, you will your
[34:59] heart will be stewed to a point where
[35:02] you will be
[35:04] interested in coming back tonight for
[35:07] part two.
[35:08] &gt;&gt; Tonight will be the clincher really. And
[35:10] uh it's uh with what we could call a
[35:13] miniseries. Uh it's two sermons that
[35:16] that goes together. So I hope we'll be
[35:19] together again tonight.
[35:21] And just a quick word about our church
[35:24] because um truly it's a miracle if I'm
[35:27] standing here with you this morning
[35:29] because this wasn't in my
[35:33] life goals or my dreams or my career
[35:36] plan to be a minister or a pastor as a
[35:40] matter of fact.
[35:42] Um, but you know when God hits you, it's
[35:46] like my life was going this way. So I
[35:48] I'm a businessman and and and my goal in
[35:51] life was to own a hundred businesses.
[35:54] That was my personal carrier plan. But I
[35:58] was, you know, going this way and then
[36:01] one day God hit me and changed the whole
[36:04] course of my life. I used to go this way
[36:07] and now I'm going this way. And it's
[36:10] like business uh and all these things
[36:12] they fade for me day by day and and the
[36:16] the desire to preach the gospel and to
[36:19] help God's people and to be a tool and
[36:22] help in the kingdom is growing day by
[36:25] day and u nobody would have thought this
[36:29] young boy would become a minister or
[36:32] pastor. It's truly the grace of God that
[36:35] I have found favor in the eyes of some
[36:38] people to trust me as their pastor
[36:40] really. And uh it's a true miracle. But
[36:44] uh we've planted a church
[36:47] um two years ago. It'll be two years
[36:50] December 31st actually. And um when we
[36:53] started there was 19 of us. So very
[36:57] small church plant. And God has blessed
[37:00] us um tremendously with uh now we have,
[37:04] you know, a storefront. We're out of the
[37:06] community hall. We we renovated a
[37:09] storefront. And when we signed the
[37:11] lease, it was a leap of faith. There was
[37:12] 35 of us and we signed a lease for a
[37:15] storefront that sits 100 people. And I
[37:18] told the brothers, we need to walk by
[37:20] faith. Oftentimes, we are the ones
[37:22] limiting God. Um, and so how can you
[37:26] send a 100 people if our church only
[37:28] sits 40? You know, and um, and so when I
[37:31] see empty seats in a church, I see a
[37:34] blessing in the making.
[37:36] &gt;&gt; There's there's a name on each and every
[37:38] one of these seats. God wants to send
[37:41] people to this church. And so we've
[37:43] rented a a church front, um, a
[37:47] storefront, a church building that sits
[37:49] a hundred. And it's been a year almost
[37:52] dayto day that we're in there. And uh we
[37:55] went from 35 to 65. 65. Praise God.
[37:59] &gt;&gt; God is sending new people, you know, by
[38:01] the day. And uh he's doing a great and
[38:05] mighty work. And um Amen. We should
[38:10] praise him for it. And I know there's a
[38:12] lot of new people in this church, too.
[38:14] Uh God is sending people. And uh you
[38:18] know the Bible says Jesus said his
[38:21] disciples, I will build my church. And
[38:25] so we have to get out of our heads that
[38:27] we we're building anything. We're merely
[38:30] tools. He said, I will build my church.
[38:33] And so when I see a church where no
[38:36] newcomers come, really what I see is a
[38:38] hospital with maybe no doctors or not
[38:41] ready to take sick patient. uh because
[38:44] God wants to send people but he will not
[38:46] send them somewhere where they cannot
[38:48] get helped and fed the gospel you know
[38:51] and so when you see people they start
[38:53] coming it's a miracle but God is the one
[38:56] sending these people and it shows your
[38:58] church is in the right atmosphere and
[39:01] condition to receive them and it's truly
[39:03] a blessing
[39:05] &gt;&gt; amen
[39:07] let's stand up and
[39:10] and turn to our Bibles
[39:12] in Exodus Chapter 3
[39:15] and we'll start from verse one
[39:23] 1-6
[39:34] and I'm not a long-winded preacher. So
[39:38] don't worry.
[39:40] You know, sometimes you have a visiting
[39:41] minister and you don't know when you'll
[39:43] be out for lunch, but not today.
[39:52] Now, Moses was sending the flock of
[39:55] Jethro, his father-in-law, the priest of
[39:58] Midian. And he led the flock to the back
[40:01] of the desert and came to Horeb, the
[40:04] mountain of God. And the angel of the
[40:07] Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire
[40:09] in the midst of a bush. So he looked,
[40:12] and behold, the bush was burning with
[40:14] fire, but the bush was not consumed.
[40:18] Then Moses said, "I will now turn aside
[40:21] and see this great sight, why the bush
[40:23] does not burn." So when the Lord saw
[40:26] that, he turned aside to look, God
[40:29] called him from the midst of the bush
[40:31] and said, "Moses, Moses." And he said,
[40:34] "Here am I." Then he said, "Do not draw
[40:38] near this place. Take your sandals off
[40:41] your feet. For the place where you stand
[40:44] is holy ground." Moreover, he said, "I
[40:47] am the God of your father, the God of
[40:50] Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God
[40:52] of Jacob." And Moses hid his face, for
[40:55] he was afraid to look upon God. Let's
[41:00] pray.
[41:03] Father God, thank you for this
[41:06] opportunity you give us this morning to
[41:08] gather together in your presence and in
[41:11] your name. And I pray you be with us
[41:15] this morning and you would uh anoint the
[41:18] ears of our understanding
[41:21] so the words that will be spoken may
[41:24] have an effect and take root in our
[41:27] hearts so they could bear fruit. Lord,
[41:31] meet each one where they are this
[41:33] morning. I pray [snorts] meet them in
[41:36] their seat, in their condition, Lord,
[41:38] and and make a change in our lives this
[41:41] morning that we might go out of here
[41:43] seeing our hearts burned within us as we
[41:46] heard the word preached. It's my prayer.
[41:50] Take this meeting under your control. I
[41:53] pray in Jesus name. Amen. You may be
[41:57] seated.
[42:01] And so
[42:03] lately, God has started really revealing
[42:06] to me that, and it really blesses me,
[42:08] that the types of the Bible,
[42:12] they apply across the board.
[42:15] You see, we know everything in the Bible
[42:18] speaks of Christ.
[42:20] Amen.
[42:21] &gt;&gt; Everything in the Bible speaks of
[42:23] Christ.
[42:24] &gt;&gt; Um, of Christ and his bride. Actually,
[42:27] it's a love story. It's a love book.
[42:29] It's a love letter. Uh but but the the
[42:32] types apply from top to bottom to from
[42:35] Christ to our personal lives. Yes, God
[42:39] has a great purpose for Christ and his
[42:41] bride. But there is the local church.
[42:43] There is the family. There is the
[42:45] individual.
[42:47] Every type in the Bible triggers down
[42:49] and applies to every level of our lives.
[42:52] Christ, bride, church, family,
[42:54] individual. And and you cannot read the
[42:57] Bible only at 20,000 feet. It will do
[43:01] you no good,
[43:03] &gt;&gt; right? It could be it could be about
[43:05] Christ and but but what about you?
[43:09] &gt;&gt; You need to see yourself in these Bible
[43:11] stories.
[43:12] &gt;&gt; You need to they're not just stories.
[43:16] They are living today.
[43:18] &gt;&gt; They're worth something today in our
[43:20] lives.
[43:21] And so uh today my title would be the
[43:25] church of Midian.
[43:28] The church of Midian. Now we uh we all
[43:32] know that Moses is a type of Christ. But
[43:35] as the types must also apply to the
[43:37] church, the family and and the
[43:39] individual.
[43:41] This morning we will type and tonight as
[43:44] well we will type the stories of of the
[43:49] children of Israel as they are in Egypt
[43:52] and getting out of Egypt to our personal
[43:54] lives.
[43:55] &gt;&gt; Our personal lives very um intimately.
[44:00] And the word of God is an infinite
[44:01] source of wisdom and and counsel and and
[44:04] light. And it discerns the thoughts and
[44:07] intents of the heart. And this is what
[44:10] the word will do for us this morning. So
[44:13] I hope everybody brought a mirror with
[44:15] with him or her. Um because the easiest
[44:19] thing to do, you know, in a sermon is to
[44:23] say amen for brother so and so.
[44:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's easy. But to amen the word
[44:29] for yourself is different.
[44:30] &gt;&gt; It takes humility.
[44:33] And uh yes, and this morning I want to
[44:36] speak of an Exodus because we believe
[44:38] there are three exodus. And u the first
[44:41] Exodus is Moses bringing the people out
[44:44] of Egypt.
[44:46] And the second exodus is Christ taking
[44:49] the people out of the law and into
[44:52] grace. Out of Judaism into a new
[44:55] covenant of grace,
[44:57] &gt;&gt; out of the slavery of Judaism into
[45:00] liberty in Christ.
[45:03] &gt;&gt; And I'm afraid this second exodus is one
[45:07] many Christians have not walked.
[45:10] Many Christians have walked out of the
[45:12] things of the world, out of the first
[45:15] Egypt,
[45:16] but they have walked right off the right
[45:19] out of the world into law.
[45:23] And they're stuck there. They're stuck
[45:25] in the law. And Paul was one of them.
[45:29] You know what Paul would be?
[45:33] A true Christian is what we would call
[45:35] him today in most churches. A true
[45:38] Christian. very legalistic,
[45:41] very zealous in Judaism in law. But you
[45:45] know what? Paul had to leave the law to
[45:49] serve Christ.
[45:54] &gt;&gt; I didn't hear many. Amen.
[45:57] [snorts]
[45:58] &gt;&gt; He had to leave the law to serve Christ.
[46:02] &gt;&gt; How did Paul get out of Judaism?
[46:05] Is it fighting with Peter in a
[46:07] theological debate? Is it fighting with
[46:11] quotes? What did he do to get out of the
[46:14] law?
[46:16] He met God face to face.
[46:19] &gt;&gt; This is what happened to him. When he
[46:21] met God face to face, he walked that
[46:25] exodus
[46:26] &gt;&gt; out of the law and into grace.
[46:31] &gt;&gt; And and God is the same today,
[46:33] yesterday, and forever. And the Bible
[46:35] says with God there is no variation of
[46:37] shadow of turning.
[46:40] Uh so indeed the way it happened the
[46:42] first time is the way it will happen
[46:44] every time.
[46:46] You want to get out of the line in in
[46:48] grace you need to meet God face to face.
[46:55] So the first and second exodus really
[46:57] are are someone you know the children of
[47:01] God meeting God face to face. Moses
[47:05] met the pillar of fire that told him, "I
[47:08] am God." And it changed him. And Paul
[47:12] met the pillar of fire that said, "I am
[47:14] Jesus." And that changed him.
[47:18] &gt;&gt; And after Moses met with God, he could
[47:22] go back and take his people out of
[47:24] slavery, out of Egypt,
[47:27] God did it. He said, "I remembered my
[47:29] people." But he did it using someone who
[47:32] had met him face to face.
[47:34] &gt;&gt; And after Paul had met God face to face,
[47:37] he could go out go out there and take
[47:39] the people of God out of the slavery of
[47:42] the law and into grace. Now Christ did
[47:45] it. He died on the cross, but he had to
[47:48] use someone who met him face to face to
[47:51] take the people out of there. You with
[47:53] me? Moses, former Egyptian, Paul
[47:57] formerly in Judaism.
[47:59] But uh there is a third Exodus.
[48:04] And uh I want to speak a little bit
[48:05] about the Exodus this morning because I
[48:08] think we live in the days this Exodus is
[48:11] passed due for us. And and I'm afraid
[48:14] many of us haven't walked this Exodus
[48:16] yet. And this Exodus, we can read in our
[48:20] Bibles in Revelations chapter 18. I
[48:22] heard another voice from heaven saying,
[48:24] "Come out of her, my people, lest you
[48:26] share in her sin and you received her
[48:29] plagues." This is one last exodus. And
[48:32] and if God is the same, we can study the
[48:35] past exodus to understand where we stand
[48:38] right now. And if we live in the days of
[48:42] an Exodus, we need to know what our
[48:45] Egypt is. And we need to know what our
[48:48] desert is. And we need to know what our
[48:50] promised land is. We need to know
[48:54] and and you know Abraham and I want to
[48:58] just speak one minute on Abraham because
[49:00] of tonight. You need to remember that
[49:02] Abraham is at the genesis of the first
[49:05] Exodus. He really is. Abraham didn't
[49:09] walk the Exodus but he is at the
[49:11] Genesis.
[49:13] But um he's the one who God made the
[49:16] promise to your people shall soldier in
[49:19] a strange land for 400 years. But I will
[49:22] bring them out. I will deliver them and
[49:25] bring them to my promised land. So
[49:28] Abraham is at is at the genesis of this
[49:30] Exodus because he's the one who received
[49:33] it and he's the one who got out of
[49:36] Babylon.
[49:38] God told him, "Go out of this city to a
[49:41] land I will show you." And in the second
[49:44] exodus, it's exactly the same thing
[49:45] because Malachi came about 400 year
[49:48] before the Christ and carried the
[49:50] promises and prophecies of the Messiah
[49:53] while the people were sinking or falling
[49:56] into Roman and Jewish slavery.
[49:59] And then they were without a prophet for
[50:01] 400 years, captives of Judaism and of
[50:05] the Roman Empire.
[50:07] I want you to to remember here this is a
[50:11] twin captivity.
[50:13] This is very important
[50:16] because because in the days of the
[50:18] second exodus you couldn't walk out of
[50:21] only one Egypt. You had to walk both
[50:24] exodus.
[50:26] &gt;&gt; There were two slaveries now. The
[50:29] slavery of the world, the Roman slavery
[50:32] and the slavery of the law.
[50:36] This is very important. And now I want
[50:39] you to realize that the reason they
[50:42] missed the Messiah
[50:44] is is not because they were not waiting
[50:47] for a Messiah, but it's because they
[50:51] wanted out on the Romans and not out on
[50:55] the law.
[50:58] what they were looking for.
[51:00] They were looking for a Messiah to take
[51:02] them out of the first slavery, the
[51:06] slavery of the world or the first Egypt.
[51:10] But what Christ was coming for was to
[51:12] take them out of the second slavery, the
[51:16] slavery of law. But they were fine with
[51:20] the law. They love their laws in
[51:22] Judaism. What they hated was the Roman
[51:26] captivity.
[51:28] You with me?
[51:31] &gt;&gt; And they missed the Messiah because they
[51:34] were fine with what God was trying to
[51:37] deliver them from. And we have to make
[51:41] sure we are not fine with what God wants
[51:44] us to walk out of or we will miss Christ
[51:49] again.
[51:52] Now
[51:54] I believe the turdic soda started when
[51:57] Luther slammed his thesis on the doors
[52:00] of Vatican.
[52:03] That's what I believe. I believe get out
[52:05] of her my people started in 1520 when
[52:09] Luther slammed his thesis on the doors
[52:12] of Vatican.
[52:14] But here's what I want us to realize
[52:16] this morning. There was a people that
[52:20] was the seed of Abraham that sojurned in
[52:22] Egypt for 400 years before their exodus
[52:26] and promised land. Now this is the first
[52:28] Exodus. The second is the same with
[52:31] Malachi. We've talked about it. And in
[52:33] the third exodus, I believe it's the
[52:35] same.
[52:37] As Luther is walking out of Babylon,
[52:41] the people stay in denominational
[52:44] slavery for 400 years.
[52:47] average. They stay in a church system
[52:51] and in denominations
[52:54] for 400 years.
[52:57] Even though there is an Abraham, there
[53:00] is someone who is at the genesis of this
[53:04] third
[53:06] Exodus, the people are still slave to
[53:09] the church system and organized religion
[53:12] because they love it.
[53:18] And this brings us to a big question
[53:20] this morning. What is our Egypt?
[53:28] What are we called out of?
[53:33] We are called out of three things.
[53:37] Not one, three. We are called out of the
[53:41] slavery of the things of the world.
[53:44] Yes, we know
[53:47] &gt;&gt; who's been walking that exodus. I have.
[53:51] &gt;&gt; I walked out of the slavery of the
[53:54] things of the world.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; But we are also called out of the
[53:58] slavery of the law.
[54:02] I won't ask
[54:05] I won't ask you to raise your hand, but
[54:07] I ask the question, have you walked out
[54:12] of the slavery of the law into grace?
[54:19] And the and the third Egypt,
[54:22] the one that pertains to our generation
[54:24] is we are called out of the slavery of
[54:27] the religious system.
[54:31] and and I think it just goes hand in
[54:35] hand with justification, sanctification,
[54:37] baptism of the Holy Ghost. This is this
[54:39] is so beautiful. Let me just stop here.
[54:42] Justification is the first exodus. It's
[54:45] when you it's when you are chosen,
[54:48] redeemed, taken out of the pit.
[54:52] It's when God said, "I remembered my
[54:54] people."
[54:56] And there is that one day when when you
[54:58] feel like God remembered you. He's he's
[55:01] chosen you. He's taken you out of the
[55:03] pit. He's justified you. He's freed you.
[55:06] He's redeemed you. [snorts]
[55:09] And he's taken you out of the things of
[55:11] the world.
[55:12] When we're justified, we receive a
[55:14] cleanup.
[55:16] We do.
[55:18] We receive a cleanup. Some pe someone
[55:20] would get baptized. A brother told me,
[55:22] "When I got baptized, the desire to
[55:25] drink alcohol left me right away. This
[55:29] is a miracle of justification,
[55:31] the cleanup.
[55:33] Your Egyptian slave master had to let
[55:36] you go when God redeemed you."
[55:42] &gt;&gt; But sanctification is the second exodus.
[55:45] And uh let me ask this
[55:50] this morning.
[55:52] Did the people or the children of Israel
[55:56] become sanctified when they left Egypt?
[56:04] Come on, let me ask you. Did the law
[56:07] sanctify the people of Israel?
[56:11] &gt;&gt; Did it?
[56:14] &gt;&gt; Did the law make them holy?
[56:19] If it didn't then, why would it now?
[56:24] &gt;&gt; Why do so many Christians think
[56:26] sanctification equals following the
[56:28] rules?
[56:31] &gt;&gt; It didn't work then. This Bible is proof
[56:35] about this thick in the Bible tells you
[56:38] you cannot follow the rules.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; You can't. It doesn't work. It doesn't
[56:45] work to the extent that God had to send
[56:47] his son to free us from the law, nailing
[56:51] it to a cross and and have us walk out
[56:54] of law into grace and new covenant.
[57:01] If we are the bride,
[57:03] we are called to walk out of the law and
[57:06] into grace. Sanctification is not a work
[57:10] of the law. It's a work of grace.
[57:15] The law is just a teacher.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; That's what it is. That's what the Bible
[57:22] tells me. Law is a teacher. It brought
[57:26] me to the realization that I couldn't
[57:28] make it and I needed Christ.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause and cheering]
[57:38] Now
[57:40] if we are the church of Christ, we are
[57:45] also called out of church system and
[57:48] denominations.
[57:50] And and we need to know and understand
[57:53] clearly what our Egypt is.
[57:56] You see our Egypt
[57:58] is is Pentecostalism or
[58:01] denominationalism.
[58:03] We need to get out of religion.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; When I tell people I'm a Christian, they
[58:10] say, "Oh, what religion?" I tell them,
[58:12] "I hate religion."
[58:15] They're all puzzled. How can you be a
[58:18] Christian and hate religion? I do.
[58:22] What kind of Christian are you? I'm a
[58:23] Christian. Christian.
[58:28] By the way, we we label Christians not
[58:31] only with names of denominations, but
[58:33] with adjectives like a good Christian
[58:35] and a bad Christian. There's no such a
[58:38] thing as a good Christian.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; Christian means follower of Christ.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; You either follow him or you don't.
[58:51] [applause and cheering]
[58:55] Amen. As long as you live under the law,
[58:59] you cannot be sanctified.
[59:05] I don't know if someone got it. As long
[59:08] as you live under the law, you cannot be
[59:12] sanctified
[59:14] &gt;&gt; because sanctification is not a work of
[59:16] the law. It's a work of grace. Amen.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; And you have to meet God face to face
[59:21] and walk out of the law into grace
[59:24] &gt;&gt; into a personal relationship with
[59:26] Christ.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; It's a work of the Holy Ghost in you
[59:31] sanctification.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm getting away from my message.
[59:36] I I need to go back to
[59:40] [applause]
[59:47] I have a $100,000 or a million dollar
[59:49] question this morning.
[59:52] Where are you at personally?
[59:55] Are you in the promised land?
[59:57] Are you in Egypt?
[1:00:00] Are you in the desert? Where are you?
[1:00:03] Now, I have a serious reason to ask the
[1:00:05] question.
[1:00:08] Because how can you know you know what
[1:00:11] you're supposed to do next if you don't
[1:00:12] even know where you stand?
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah, we can have buzzwords and say,
[1:00:18] "Oh, Exodus and different things, but
[1:00:21] where are you at?
[1:00:23] You're in Egypt. You're in the desert.
[1:00:25] Where are you?" See, since couple years,
[1:00:29] I see I notice a trend. It's like people
[1:00:34] are are looking for sensor
[1:00:36] sensationalism.
[1:00:38] It's it's like people are getting hyped
[1:00:40] about Pentecostals behaviors.
[1:00:44] I see some kind of movement or return
[1:00:46] back to Pentecostalism.
[1:00:48] I talked with many pastors and mainly
[1:00:51] across you know Canada and in Americas
[1:00:53] but and and there is a real movement of
[1:00:56] return towards you gifts miracles
[1:00:59] shouting speaking tongue and prophesying
[1:01:01] and casting out demons and people want
[1:01:04] sensationalism
[1:01:05] people want strong emotions they want
[1:01:07] trill they want excitement they want the
[1:01:10] message of divine healing and and I'm
[1:01:14] not saying these things are bad but a
[1:01:16] little over two years ago
[1:01:18] I myself left a very formal church to
[1:01:21] plant a church in a new area and uh but
[1:01:25] I found myself in a position or a state
[1:01:29] where I was searching for miracles.
[1:01:33] I wanted to see the spiritual gifts and
[1:01:35] miracles. I wanted to see the miracles
[1:01:38] of the days of William Brham for myself.
[1:01:43] Do you know where I found them?
[1:01:47] in the Pentecostal church.
[1:01:50] This is where I found them. Now, please
[1:01:53] remain seated and calm for just a few
[1:01:55] minutes.
[1:01:59] Give me at least 10 minutes before you
[1:02:01] drop the hammer. Uh, as I was on this
[1:02:05] quest
[1:02:07] for sensations and someone sent me a
[1:02:10] testimony from brother TL Osborne. You
[1:02:13] know him? He was an oldtime shouting
[1:02:16] Pentecostal and he was in brother
[1:02:18] Brandham's meeting and and and he tells
[1:02:21] that testimony where brother Brandham
[1:02:23] casted a spirit out of a person in
[1:02:26] simple words like Satan leave her alone
[1:02:28] in Jesus name.
[1:02:31] And then brother Brham said it's over
[1:02:33] she's free and Osborne said wait a
[1:02:36] minute we haven't even start to shout
[1:02:39] yet. Yeah, we haven't even worked been
[1:02:42] worked up yet. We How can the the demon
[1:02:46] be leaving already? We haven't started
[1:02:50] our, you know, our comedy yet.
[1:02:56] And that night, I realized listening to
[1:02:58] that testimony that God has had so much
[1:03:02] more in store for me than shouting and s
[1:03:07] sensationalism. and and and God had much
[1:03:10] more in store for me than the message of
[1:03:12] divine healing.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; And so I went to study the word because
[1:03:17] I wanted to understand why that desire
[1:03:21] was all of a sudden raising inside of
[1:03:23] me. You know, after so many years
[1:03:26] without that desire, why was that desire
[1:03:29] springing up inside of me?
[1:03:31] Would you like to know why?
[1:03:38] because I had just met God face to face.
[1:03:47] Amen.
[1:03:49] Because I had just met God face to face
[1:03:53] and it woke me up in my sleep and it put
[1:03:57] me into action. That's what draw me to
[1:04:01] to want to get in the action.
[1:04:06] And so let me ask you this question.
[1:04:09] Where did Moses meet God face to face?
[1:04:15] Where did he
[1:04:18] Where did Moses meet God face to face?
[1:04:26] I don't think it's working. Okay.
[1:04:30] In the church of Midian.
[1:04:33] That's where he did.
[1:04:38] Remember this morning we have to see
[1:04:40] ourselves as individual
[1:04:43] in in the types of the Bible.
[1:04:46] You see Moses just like me and I assume
[1:04:50] like most of us
[1:04:53] was raised by a Christian mother,
[1:04:56] a godly mother. and she taught him about
[1:04:59] the promises of God and she told him who
[1:05:03] he was and that God had a plan for his
[1:05:05] life and that God was real. But he also
[1:05:09] received an indication in Egypt.
[1:05:13] And Moses like us, he had a call upon
[1:05:17] his life.
[1:05:19] He had a part to play in God's economy,
[1:05:23] but he also had a hurtly calling.
[1:05:26] The world wanted wanted to make him a
[1:05:29] king. Egypt offered him pleasures and
[1:05:33] wealth and so forth. And Moses was
[1:05:36] living a double life.
[1:05:39] He was a double agent.
[1:05:42] Yeah. When he was with the Egyptians, he
[1:05:45] was a future king, but when he was with
[1:05:46] his people and his mom, he was a
[1:05:48] Christian.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; And he relied on the promises and and
[1:05:52] the stories of the Bible and so forth.
[1:05:54] and and he was living this double life
[1:05:57] until he was caught and confronted with
[1:06:00] his life.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; And that day, the day one of his
[1:06:04] brothers told him, "Will you kill us
[1:06:06] like you killed that Egyptian?" That day
[1:06:08] he ran from Egypt.
[1:06:11] We could almost say that it is the first
[1:06:14] Exodus.
[1:06:16] Moses leaving Egypt for the first time.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; So Moses leaves Egypt. He runs from
[1:06:24] Egypt. Do you know where he's going?
[1:06:28] He runs from this worldly life. He runs
[1:06:31] from the people wanting to make him a
[1:06:33] king and hovering pleasure and wealth
[1:06:35] and stuff. Do you know where he runs? He
[1:06:39] runs to church.
[1:06:41] Moses let go of his double life. He
[1:06:45] takes charge of his life and he finds a
[1:06:48] local church in Midian.
[1:06:51] He even married the pastor's daughter.
[1:06:56] Moses starts a family in Midian. He gets
[1:07:00] a stable job in the family business. He
[1:07:03] goes to church every Sunday. He doesn't
[1:07:06] live a double life or a worldly life in
[1:07:08] the palaces of Egypt no more. No. Moses
[1:07:11] is now a good Christian.
[1:07:14] He's a good man. He's a good husband and
[1:07:17] he's a good father. and he goes to
[1:07:20] church every Sunday. Praise God.
[1:07:25] He's even the son-in-law, the pastor of
[1:07:26] the church of median.
[1:07:29] There's only one problem.
[1:07:32] Moses ran away from his calling into a
[1:07:36] religion.
[1:07:39] There's just one problem. Moses is the
[1:07:43] only one of his people who lives the
[1:07:45] good life. Everybody is left behind
[1:07:48] suffering.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; While he's living the good life in the
[1:07:53] church of Midian, his people are still
[1:07:55] slave in Egypt.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; Now Moses is not living in Exodus.
[1:08:02] Moses is in exile.
[1:08:06] Now I'm not the one saying it. He is. He
[1:08:09] named his son Gersam,
[1:08:12] which means in exile in a strange land.
[1:08:16] He named his own son after his
[1:08:19] condition.
[1:08:21] 40 years
[1:08:24] in the church of Midian,
[1:08:26] living the Christian life
[1:08:29] away from God's calling upon his life.
[1:08:33] Every single one of his family members
[1:08:36] and people is backslid and slave in
[1:08:38] Egypt. But that doesn't bother him. He
[1:08:41] lives his little Christian life.
[1:08:44] I don't speak about Moses now.
[1:08:48] I speak about the modern Christian
[1:08:51] running from Egypt in the church of
[1:08:53] Median.
[1:08:59] Not living the double life anymore. Not
[1:09:01] living in worldly sin anymore,
[1:09:05] but running from his calling and
[1:09:07] settling in a little church, thinking
[1:09:10] living the good life is good enough.
[1:09:15] I'm afraid most believers built a life
[1:09:21] in a little church in Midian,
[1:09:25] living a quiet and religious life far
[1:09:29] from the plan God has for their life.
[1:09:33] Yet they left the life of sin in Egypt,
[1:09:37] but they left behind their family, their
[1:09:41] belongings, and every privilege that
[1:09:43] belonged to them. 40 years.
[1:09:47] 40 years Moses spent in the church of
[1:09:50] many doing, sleep, work, repeat,
[1:09:55] taking care of his wife and taking care
[1:09:58] of the sheep of his father. He was even
[1:10:00] co-pastor. He helped with the sheep.
[1:10:04] 40 years running from his calling,
[1:10:07] running to a church in Midian while
[1:10:09] everybody is suffering back in Egypt.
[1:10:13] You know why? Moses had never met God
[1:10:17] face to face yet.
[1:10:20] Now, mentally,
[1:10:22] intellectually,
[1:10:24] he knew who he was.
[1:10:27] Mama had done tell him. Mama had done a
[1:10:30] good job. He knew who he was, but he had
[1:10:33] never met God face to face. Oh, but when
[1:10:37] he met God, God gave life to his
[1:10:40] commission. God gave him courage. God
[1:10:44] gave him power to get the job done.
[1:10:47] Miracles, sensationalism, supernatural.
[1:10:52] Now, he had a thirst for miracle
[1:10:56] because he met God face to face. And
[1:11:00] there he goes back to Egypt to take
[1:11:02] over.
[1:11:04] Before the Exodus,
[1:11:08] there has to be an invasion.
[1:11:13] Come on, church. Before the Exodus,
[1:11:17] there has to be an invasion.
[1:11:21] And once someone's met God face to face,
[1:11:24] it can be a one-man invasion. It doesn't
[1:11:27] care. Contrary
[1:11:32] to all common sense or logic, it doesn't
[1:11:35] care.
[1:11:37] Why?
[1:11:41] Because he wasn't called to exile, but
[1:11:44] he was called to an exodus. And exodus
[1:11:48] means we leave nobody behind. We bring
[1:11:52] everybody with us. Exodus means we leave
[1:11:55] nothing behind. We bring all that
[1:11:58] belongs to us and everything belonging
[1:12:01] to Egypt as well. [applause]
[1:12:09] But oh, how many Christians have adopted
[1:12:12] the exile mentality
[1:12:15] running from the world into a local
[1:12:18] church in Median. They become Christians
[1:12:21] and they cut themselves from everybody.
[1:12:24] They close themselves from the outside
[1:12:25] world and become self-centered living a
[1:12:28] life without privileges. A miserable
[1:12:31] Christian life waiting for heaven. How
[1:12:34] many times you meet Christians? You say,
[1:12:36] "How are you, brother?" By the grace of
[1:12:38] God,
[1:12:40] I'm good. Yes,
[1:12:44] I met Christians that long for death to
[1:12:47] go to heaven.
[1:12:51] Come on. The kingdom of God is now.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; There was a brother once I went to
[1:13:02] coffee with him at Tim Hortons. You guys
[1:13:04] don't have Tim Hortons. You don't know
[1:13:05] what you're missing. It's my second
[1:13:08] office.
[1:13:09] It's amazing. You need to try it
[1:13:11] sometimes. I go to Tim Hortons with him.
[1:13:15] I get there maybe five minutes after
[1:13:17] him. He's sitting at a table with his
[1:13:19] coffee. So I I I go to him and I say,
[1:13:21] "How are you, brother?" He says, "Oh,
[1:13:24] [sighs]
[1:13:24] it's by the grace of God that there's
[1:13:26] still a breath in and these lungs."
[1:13:30] And I'm like, "Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[1:13:33] You see that girl, the casher at Tim
[1:13:36] Hortons?
[1:13:38] It's also by the grace of God if she has
[1:13:42] a breath in her lung, but she doesn't
[1:13:45] even know it and she's happier than you.
[1:13:49] She's smiling.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; If you fit
[1:13:59] the description this morning of the
[1:14:02] helpless Christian waiting to die to go
[1:14:04] to heaven and finally be happy.
[1:14:08] Let me tell you this
[1:14:10] with love.
[1:14:12] You haven't met God face to face yet.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; It'll change everything when you do.
[1:14:18] Amen.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; Because when you meet God, you receive
[1:14:24] power and you receive your commission.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; And it's it's no more about seeing
[1:14:30] someone with great gifts of miracle.
[1:14:34] It's about you yourself walking in the
[1:14:38] path that God has for you and redeeming
[1:14:40] your own people.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; It's not about the show and
[1:14:44] sensationalism anymore. It's about
[1:14:47] invasion and possession.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, we all know this, but I hope
[1:14:54] it makes more sense today.
[1:14:56] He said to them, "Go into all the world
[1:14:59] and preach the gospel to every creature.
[1:15:02] He who believes and is baptized will be
[1:15:05] saved, but he who does not believe will
[1:15:07] be condemned, and these signs shall
[1:15:09] follow those who believe."
[1:15:13] Now this verse tells us how we know if
[1:15:17] we believed because it uses the word
[1:15:22] follow
[1:15:24] and that indicates that if you believe
[1:15:27] you will start walking
[1:15:30] because if I want to follow you you have
[1:15:32] to be going somewhere.
[1:15:35] If you sit in your rocking chair and
[1:15:39] wait for a rapture,
[1:15:42] you do not believe.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; And no wonder no signs are following you
[1:15:49] because you are not going anywhere.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; These signs will follow those who
[1:15:57] believe in my name. They will cast out
[1:15:59] demons. They will speak with new thongs.
[1:16:01] They will take up serpents. And if they
[1:16:03] drink anything deadly, it will by no
[1:16:06] means hurt them. They will lay hands on
[1:16:08] the sick and they will recover. This is
[1:16:10] not for somebody else. This is for the
[1:16:14] believer who met God.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; This is his possession, his work tool
[1:16:21] for invasion to make sure nobody stays
[1:16:24] behind.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; But that's not what modern Christian
[1:16:30] want.
[1:16:32] They don't want the power for
[1:16:35] themselves. What they want, they want
[1:16:38] the pastor to invite someone with a
[1:16:40] great gift or someone who can put on a
[1:16:44] show in the church, miracles and and
[1:16:46] power and evangelism and and they want
[1:16:51] church, what they call it. They want
[1:16:53] church.
[1:16:55] Christians today,
[1:16:58] they want to see the miracles of
[1:17:01] Jonathan Jumbris.
[1:17:05] Now, get me right. I'm not saying that
[1:17:08] if someone performs a miracle or casts a
[1:17:10] demon, he is Janice or Jeus. I could
[1:17:14] have said they want to see the miracles
[1:17:16] of Moses.
[1:17:19] The idea here is that people want the
[1:17:23] trill. They want to see a gift in
[1:17:25] action.
[1:17:28] And the fact they want to see a gift in
[1:17:31] action, it proves they don't possess the
[1:17:34] power themselves.
[1:17:40] Now, I want to make a strong statement
[1:17:42] this morning,
[1:17:45] if any.
[1:17:48] In Egypt,
[1:17:50] the people were intrigued and amazed at
[1:17:53] the miracles performed by Moses, right?
[1:17:57] And they all died in the wilderness.
[1:18:01] And Moses died, too, by the way.
[1:18:05] I hope that sinks in right now.
[1:18:09] And this brings us to our climax for for
[1:18:13] this morning's service.
[1:18:17] The miracles and signs
[1:18:22] are for Egypt.
[1:18:26] They still have a role to play because
[1:18:29] these types are now spiritual.
[1:18:34] And and and we need to invade Egypt
[1:18:38] to take our loved ones out of there.
[1:18:42] And and when we do, when we start
[1:18:45] walking by faith, a one-man invasion,
[1:18:49] these signs will follow. They will they
[1:18:54] are for Egypt.
[1:18:57] But once out of Egypt,
[1:19:00] we are called to something quite
[1:19:02] different. We are called to a promised
[1:19:04] land. And you know what our promised
[1:19:06] land is?
[1:19:08] Christ.
[1:19:10] Christ is my promised land.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; And once I'm pregnantated with the word
[1:19:18] and once I I am truly married to Christ,
[1:19:24] then I have this promise.
[1:19:27] Speak the word and I'll bring it to
[1:19:30] pass.
[1:19:33] And when we are focused and amazed by
[1:19:35] the signs and wonders, and when we are
[1:19:38] looking for them, it proves we are in
[1:19:40] Egypt still. But we are called to an
[1:19:43] exodus towards a promised land out of
[1:19:46] Pentecostalism and sensationalism and
[1:19:49] and into the kingdom. God promised us
[1:19:54] into Christ himself
[1:19:57] with the power ourselves not for the
[1:20:00] show but for the work of the kingdom.
[1:20:05] Not for the show. Not for the great
[1:20:07] ministry. Not not to travel on a private
[1:20:10] jet and and own a mansion, but for the
[1:20:13] work of the kingdom
[1:20:15] such as I have I give to you.
[1:20:20] Stand up and walk.
[1:20:22] Not for the show, for the work of the
[1:20:25] kingdom. Church,
[1:20:30] every one of us this morning
[1:20:33] has a calling on his life.
[1:20:36] We have a part to play in God's great
[1:20:39] economy.
[1:20:40] And that part is not to sit on a pew.
[1:20:44] God has something he wants you to do.
[1:20:47] There are works that he prepares
[1:20:49] beforehand so that ye will walk in them.
[1:20:57] Every pray, every place that the soul of
[1:21:02] your foot
[1:21:05] will tread upon, I have given you. You
[1:21:09] possess it.
[1:21:11] Walk by faith and possess the land.
[1:21:15] That's what God told to Moses.
[1:21:19] Moses received that promise,
[1:21:22] but he couldn't fulfill it.
[1:21:25] There was no need for healing in the
[1:21:29] promised land. There was not even a
[1:21:32] hospital or a nurse because nobody was
[1:21:35] getting sick or hurt even in battle.
[1:21:40] Nothing could harm them. And when you
[1:21:43] are in Christ, nothing can harm you.
[1:21:47] And we are called to cross over Jordan
[1:21:51] into the promised land. We are called,
[1:21:53] church,
[1:21:55] whatever you are doing, stop right now
[1:21:58] and get into Christ if you haven't. He
[1:22:02] is our promised land. Not get into
[1:22:04] church.
[1:22:06] Not not get into church. No. Get out of
[1:22:10] organized religion. Yes. Find a church.
[1:22:15] Find a church that does not summit to
[1:22:18] any church system and fellowship there.
[1:22:22] And I believe you have found one. By the
[1:22:24] way, this is why I'm honored to be here.
[1:22:28] I believe you have found a church that
[1:22:31] does not submit to a church system.
[1:22:35] Go to that church and fellowship there,
[1:22:37] but make sure you get into Christ. E is
[1:22:41] the promised land. [applause]
[1:22:52] Let's go back to that little church in
[1:22:54] Midian.
[1:22:59] What about it? you know, this little
[1:23:02] church and his people,
[1:23:05] this formal church where
[1:23:07] you could have your religion quietly.
[1:23:10] This is what it was. You run there to
[1:23:14] median
[1:23:16] and uh it's in the back side of the
[1:23:18] desert. It's not the promised land. It's
[1:23:20] the desert. It's a church in the desert.
[1:23:24] and you can live a quiet religious
[1:23:26] Christianish
[1:23:28] life and raise a family, you know, and
[1:23:30] and run your business. And but what
[1:23:34] happened to this church?
[1:23:37] Because we see this church later on
[1:23:40] in the actual Exodus.
[1:23:44] God speaks to Moses in Numbers 31 and
[1:23:46] says,
[1:23:50] "Take vengeance
[1:23:53] on the Medidianites
[1:23:55] for the children of Israel.
[1:23:58] Afterward, you shall be gathered to your
[1:24:01] people." So Moses spoke to the people,
[1:24:03] saying, "Arm some of yourselves for war,
[1:24:06] and let them go against the Medidianite
[1:24:09] to take vengeance for the Lord on
[1:24:11] Medidian."
[1:24:13] Now this little median church was still
[1:24:15] causing problems.
[1:24:17] Even though Moses was out of it and even
[1:24:21] though he had invade Egypt and he had
[1:24:24] started the Exodus, this church was
[1:24:27] still trying to entice the children of
[1:24:30] Israel.
[1:24:34] And and for that reason, God told Moses,
[1:24:39] arm your people and go there and kill
[1:24:44] it.
[1:24:47] Don't tolerate it.
[1:24:50] Don't say, "Oh, it's fine. We love them.
[1:24:54] Kill it. It goes after the children of
[1:24:58] God." And so the people went
[1:25:03] to do the job,
[1:25:06] but didn't kill everybody.
[1:25:11] Didn't obey. Didn't kill everybody. And
[1:25:14] Moses
[1:25:17] said to them,
[1:25:19] "Have you kept all the woman alive?"
[1:25:27] Now in the Bible, the woman
[1:25:29] typifies a church.
[1:25:32] We know that. Have you kept all the
[1:25:35] woman alive? Look, this woman caused the
[1:25:39] children of Israel through the council
[1:25:41] of Bethlehem
[1:25:44] to trespass against the Lord in the
[1:25:47] incident of Peor. And there was a plague
[1:25:49] amongst the congregation
[1:25:52] of the Lord.
[1:25:54] A woman is a church and the church of
[1:25:57] Midian under a false influence seduced
[1:26:01] the children of God and caused them to
[1:26:03] trespass against the Lord. Even after
[1:26:06] they really got out of Egypt in exod in
[1:26:09] an exodus,
[1:26:11] Moses wasn't done yet dealing with the
[1:26:14] church in Midian.
[1:26:18] She was still the church. She was still
[1:26:21] opposing God's work and causing trouble
[1:26:25] as she was a tool in Satan's hand to
[1:26:28] hinder the children of God from getting
[1:26:30] to the promised land.
[1:26:33] Now, I want you to to understand that
[1:26:35] this is very important.
[1:26:39] God's purpose for your life is to reach
[1:26:42] your promised land, marry with him, and
[1:26:46] get into him.
[1:26:48] But that formal church or that church
[1:26:51] systems goal, it's a tool. It offers you
[1:26:55] substitution.
[1:26:57] Religion for relation.
[1:27:00] Religion for relationship. And it's
[1:27:03] trying to mess with the children of God
[1:27:06] and have stop before the promised land
[1:27:09] telling them, "You've made it. Welcome
[1:27:12] to church.
[1:27:14] Here's an image of Christ we've painted
[1:27:17] for you. worship that image, you'll be
[1:27:19] fine.
[1:27:22] God doesn't want you to worship an
[1:27:23] image. He wants a relationship with you.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; He wants you to worship his person.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; She was still causing trouble and
[1:27:34] opposing God's work. But still, God told
[1:27:39] the people, "Kill it." But the people
[1:27:42] spared her one more time. Oh, we cannot
[1:27:45] say anything against it. We have to
[1:27:47] respect the church. Be careful what you
[1:27:51] say, brother, when you speak against it.
[1:27:53] She caused the children of God to be
[1:27:56] infidel.
[1:28:02] Are there sons and daughters of God in
[1:28:04] the church of Midian?
[1:28:06] Yes.
[1:28:08] Moses was there for 40 years.
[1:28:11] But everybody that sits in the church of
[1:28:14] Midian this morning needs to meet God
[1:28:17] face to face.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; Are there sons and daughters of God in
[1:28:22] Egypt?
[1:28:23] Yes.
[1:28:26] They need an Exodus.
[1:28:28] They need you to invade Egypt
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; and go pick them up and get it get them
[1:28:35] out of there.
[1:28:38] And I want to ask you again personally
[1:28:42] as we close this morning to you to you
[1:28:45] personally
[1:28:47] where are you?
[1:28:50] Are you in an exodus or are you in
[1:28:53] exile?
[1:28:57] Are you in median this morning
[1:29:01] playing church?
[1:29:05] Are you in Egypt?
[1:29:07] Are you in the desert?
[1:29:09] Are you in the promised land?
[1:29:13] Are you with the ones on the side of the
[1:29:15] Jordan and the ones in favor of a return
[1:29:19] in Egypt?
[1:29:22] Do you miss the miracles of Egypt?
[1:29:27] Sensationalism and the big gifts. Do you
[1:29:29] miss it?
[1:29:31] Isn't the word enough?
[1:29:36] Isn't Christ enough?
[1:29:42] You have
[1:29:45] to take account of where you are this
[1:29:48] morning and what needs to be done to
[1:29:51] bring you to the promised land if you're
[1:29:53] not.
[1:29:55] Now, let me summarize.
[1:29:59] Not what should be, but what most likely
[1:30:01] is our Christian walk because we're
[1:30:04] human human beings. It should be Egypt,
[1:30:08] Exodus, promised land. But here's how it
[1:30:12] looks. It looks more like this. Egypt,
[1:30:16] exile,
[1:30:19] invasion,
[1:30:20] Exodus,
[1:30:22] desert,
[1:30:24] promised land.
[1:30:27] I believe this is truer to our actual
[1:30:29] walk.
[1:30:31] This is what Moses did despised
[1:30:36] despite being raised by a Christian
[1:30:39] mother who told him everything he needed
[1:30:41] to know.
[1:30:43] This is still what Moses did. And this
[1:30:46] is what most Christian do.
[1:30:49] Brother, if you're in exile this
[1:30:50] morning, I don't condemn you. Moses was
[1:30:52] there for 40 years. And and and God
[1:30:56] didn't despise him for that. God didn't
[1:30:58] rebuke him for that. But God came and
[1:31:01] met him face to face
[1:31:03] and gave him his commission,
[1:31:06] purpose, and power and courage to go
[1:31:10] and fulfill what he was on earth for.
[1:31:14] And so I could say this, why are you on
[1:31:18] earth for
[1:31:22] why is it?
[1:31:25] If you don't know,
[1:31:28] maybe you haven't met God face to face
[1:31:29] yet.
[1:31:34] Lord willing, tonight we will speak more
[1:31:36] about the children of Israel and relate
[1:31:38] to their journey in our lives. This
[1:31:40] morning was about Moses. Tonight will be
[1:31:42] about the people and I hope you be there
[1:31:46] brothers and sisters.
[1:31:48] The musicians could come. It will be
[1:31:50] challenging tonight but it will be a
[1:31:52] blessing. You know we need Christians we
[1:31:56] need to challenge the status quo.
[1:32:01] There's nothing as a status quo for a
[1:32:03] Christian.
[1:32:05] We either move forward or we start
[1:32:09] backsliding. It's either or.
[1:32:15] A true Christian wants to know the plan
[1:32:18] of God for his life.
[1:32:21] There is a huge difference, brothers and
[1:32:23] sisters, between a Christian and a
[1:32:26] religious person.
[1:32:28] It's night and day. It's so different. A
[1:32:33] religious person is happy with the
[1:32:35] current state of his life and finds
[1:32:37] comfort in his doctrine and in his
[1:32:40] legalistic life. But a Christian finds
[1:32:44] comfort in Christ and wants to grow and
[1:32:47] know God's plan for his life and know
[1:32:50] how he can impact the kingdom.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; You are called to service church
[1:32:59] to play a part in God's economy.
[1:33:03] God needs you.
[1:33:06] This church needs you.
[1:33:10] Not sitting on the pews, but putting the
[1:33:13] shoulder to the wheel.
[1:33:17] A Christian finds comfort in Christ,
[1:33:23] not in rules, not in law,
[1:33:27] not in dogmas, not in creeds, but in
[1:33:29] Christ. and wants to grow and know God's
[1:33:32] plan for his life and how he can impact
[1:33:35] the kingdom. It's time to leave our
[1:33:38] little church in Midian and go back to
[1:33:42] Egypt and take over and take what
[1:33:45] belongs to us and bring our loved ones
[1:33:48] with us and our belongings and bring
[1:33:50] what's what belongs to Egypt as well.
[1:33:52] You know when when the children of
[1:33:54] Israel left Egypt,
[1:33:57] the Egyptians were so done with them
[1:33:59] that they were giving them riches.
[1:34:01] Take everything but just leave.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; But I don't see that today.
[1:34:11] It's quite the opposite. We tend to
[1:34:14] leave everything in Egypt
[1:34:18] and run away,
[1:34:20] escape by ourselves.
[1:34:22] and think we are Christian because we
[1:34:24] settled in a little church in the
[1:34:27] backside of the desert.
[1:34:32] It's time
[1:34:35] to meet God face to face
[1:34:39] and to receive power and a commission
[1:34:41] [music] and a purpose and to realize the
[1:34:44] kingdom of God
[1:34:47] is now.
[1:34:50] [snorts] You know when Jesus
[1:34:55] was baptized, he instantly started to
[1:34:58] preach and to say the kingdom of God is
[1:35:02] near or is at hand.
[1:35:05] And when we hear that, we think it's
[1:35:07] because it's soon. There's something
[1:35:10] inside of us that hears the kingdom of
[1:35:13] God is near and we think, "Oh, the
[1:35:15] rapture is soon."
[1:35:18] But guess what?
[1:35:20] When he sent his disciples two by two,
[1:35:24] he told them, "When you get to a city,
[1:35:29] tell them the kingdom of God has come
[1:35:33] near."
[1:35:36] What he was saying was, "When I came
[1:35:39] close to you, the kingdom of God came
[1:35:43] near.
[1:35:45] I am the kingdom of God. This what Jesus
[1:35:49] was saying. But then when he
[1:35:51] commissioned his disciples,
[1:35:54] he told his disciples, when you go to a
[1:35:56] city, tell them as we have come in this
[1:36:01] city,
[1:36:03] the kingdom of God has drawn near to
[1:36:05] this city.
[1:36:10] And he who rejects you rejects me.
[1:36:15] He said,
[1:36:17] "The kingdom of God is here and now
[1:36:22] it's time to stop waiting and stop
[1:36:27] acting upon it."
[1:36:29] Let's pray.
[1:36:35] God,
[1:36:38] Father, we bow before you this morning.
[1:36:46] as your word was preached and
[1:36:50] discern our hearts intents and thoughts.
[1:36:59] Lord, each one of us
[1:37:02] is in a different state
[1:37:05] and in a different place this morning
[1:37:10] because it is a spiritual condition we
[1:37:12] are talking about.
[1:37:15] But God,
[1:37:18] you are merciful God and you love us and
[1:37:23] you are ready to meet us where we are.
[1:37:27] Even if we run away in the backside of
[1:37:30] the desert,
[1:37:31] you're still faithful to come and meet
[1:37:33] us where we are to give us commission
[1:37:37] and purpose and power.
[1:37:41] And I pray you do it this morning for
[1:37:43] someone, someone who is humble enough to
[1:37:46] look at himself in the mirror and say,
[1:37:49] "Oh, I'm not where I should be. I've
[1:37:53] settled in a little church, but I am not
[1:37:57] walking
[1:37:59] in any works you have prepared for me,
[1:38:01] Lord. I'm just waiting,
[1:38:04] but I want to be done waiting. I want to
[1:38:06] meet you face to face,
[1:38:10] and I want to be a tool for this
[1:38:11] kingdom.
[1:38:13] Lord, this morning I realize my people
[1:38:16] is suffering and I'm on the only one
[1:38:19] sitting in church and feeling blessed
[1:38:22] and
[1:38:24] but everybody else is a slave in Egypt.
[1:38:31] [snorts] Give me power. [music]
[1:38:33] Give me courage.
[1:38:35] come and meet me this morning where I am
[1:38:38] so I can go out of this building and
[1:38:44] start a one-man invasion, a onewoman
[1:38:46] invasion
[1:38:49] and go after my loved ones and go after
[1:38:53] what is mine and
[1:38:55] work for the kingdom.
[1:38:59] Lord grant it.
[1:39:06] Grant someone this morning
[1:39:14] with your presence,
[1:39:18] touchable, physical. Your presence face
[1:39:21] to face.
[1:39:25] Something that will change
[1:39:27] a life
[1:39:29] now and forever. [music]
[1:39:36] Jesus, make a way.
[1:39:41] I pray,
[1:39:44] have your way. I pray
[1:39:48] in Jesus name.
[1:39:52] Amen.
[1:39:54] Let's sing. We're maker.

[1:43:44] And you are way maker, miracle
[1:43:47] [music and singing] worker, promise

[1:43:54] My God, that is true.
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; You know, he made a way for the children
[1:44:01] of Israel and he wants to make a way in
[1:44:04] your situation this morning. No matter
[1:44:07] where you find yourself, in the desert,
[1:44:10] in Egypt, in Median, come to him. Come
[1:44:13] to him and ask him for a facetoface
[1:44:18] meeting this morning. And he will he
[1:44:21] will touch your heart and he [music]
[1:44:23] will make a way for you because he is a
[1:44:29] way maker and he is working even when we
[1:44:34] don't see it. And then sing that. Even
[1:44:37] when I don't see it, you're working.
[1:44:41] Even when I don't feel it, you're
[1:44:43] [music] working. You never stop. You
[1:44:46] never stop working. You never stop. You
[1:44:50] [music and singing] never stop.
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, even even when I don't see it,
[1:44:55] you're working.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, [singing] even when I don't feel
[1:44:59] [music] it, you're working. You never
[1:45:02] stop. You never stop working. You never
[1:45:06] stop. You never stop working. [music]
[1:45:09] Even when I don't see it, you're
[1:45:12] working. Even when I don't feel it,
[1:45:15] [singing] you're working. You never
[1:45:18] stop. You never [music] stop working.

[1:45:35] You never stop [singing]
[1:45:36] working. You never stop. You never
[1:45:39] [music] stop working. Way maker, miracle
[1:45:44] worker, promise keeper, light in the
[1:45:48] darkness.
[1:45:50] My [music] God, that is who you are you
[1:45:54] are.
[1:45:56] You are [music]
[1:45:58] way maker, miracle worker, promise
[1:46:02] [music] keeper, light in the darkness.
[1:46:06] My God, that is who you are.
[1:46:13] And I met Brother Joel
[1:46:18] in that town.
[1:46:21] And after I spoke,
[1:46:25] Brother Joel came to me
[1:46:28] and he said, "I saw what you were trying
[1:46:31] to do."
[1:46:34] And I had just got done preaching about
[1:46:37] miracles and great things that had
[1:46:39] happened. And I said, "But God is a God
[1:46:43] of today.
[1:46:45] He's not a God of 50, 60, 100, 2,000
[1:46:49] years ago. He's a God of today."
[1:46:53] And I say the same that he said to me
[1:46:57] back in 2017. I say the same to him. I
[1:47:01] saw what you were trying to do.
[1:47:06] We came out of Egypt as Moses did
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; and he went to the priest of Midian,
[1:47:13] married his daughter Zapora,
[1:47:16] went to church there, but he met God
[1:47:20] there.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; And what did he do? He didn't stay out
[1:47:24] of Egypt. HE WENT BACK TO EGYPT and
[1:47:28] said, "Now, I'm going to get my loved
[1:47:30] ones. I'm going to get my friends. I'm
[1:47:31] going to get my family. AND I'M GOING TO
[1:47:33] BRING HIM OUT WITH A MIGHTY HAND.
[1:47:38] That's what Moses did. I saw what you
[1:47:40] were trying to do, my friend.
[1:47:43] Brothers and sisters, we have come out.
[1:47:47] We're not sinners this morning.
[1:47:50] We're not We're not people
[1:47:55] that are struggling so much with sin in
[1:47:57] our lives. We come out of that.
[1:48:01] But let's not stay in Midian. Let's not
[1:48:04] stay in that church.
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; We have friends. We have loved ones. If
[1:48:09] we truly believe that this is the end of
[1:48:11] days, if we truly believe that this is
[1:48:13] the end times, LET'S GO GET THEM.
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; Let's go right back and let's get them
[1:48:18] and bring them out.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; Do you see what our brother was trying
[1:48:22] to say?
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; Beautiful.
[1:48:27] And God is a way maker.
[1:48:30] I love it when he said and I saw the
[1:48:32] eyebrows raised when he started talking
[1:48:34] about miracles and this
[1:48:37] and everybody thought, "What is he
[1:48:38] trying to say? We're not supposed to
[1:48:39] have miracles." What did they think when
[1:48:42] Jesus said, "A wicked and adultery
[1:48:44] adulterous generation seeks after a
[1:48:46] sign."
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; And yet here is the sign giver. Here is
[1:48:50] the great physician that is standing
[1:48:53] there healing all their diseases. And he
[1:48:55] said, "Now you're seeking after a sign."
[1:48:58] What they should have been doing is
[1:49:00] seeking for divine healing. But don't
[1:49:02] forget the divine part.
[1:49:05] Seek after God
[1:49:07] and then he provides. Are you with me,
[1:49:10] friends? Take this service this morning.
[1:49:14] [music] Take it to heart. Think about
[1:49:16] what our friend said. I know what he was
[1:49:18] trying to say.
[1:49:21] He was trying to say, "You've come out
[1:49:22] of that.
[1:49:25] Now meet God and go right back into it.
[1:49:30] Let's all stand. What did Jude say? I
[1:49:33] believe it was Jude.
[1:49:35] He said, "You have got to put your hand
[1:49:38] into the fire
[1:49:40] to yank them out, our loved ones. We've
[1:49:44] come out of Egypt, friends. We've come
[1:49:47] out of it. We've changed our lives.
[1:49:49] We're no longer sinners. Now, let's meet
[1:49:52] God and let's go right back and let's
[1:49:54] pull everyone out. Amen. And follow the
[1:49:58] way maker. Let's continue on with a
[1:50:00] song.
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; You are way maker, miracle worker,
[1:50:07] promise keep
[1:50:09] in the darkness.
[1:50:11] My God, that is [singing] who you are.
[1:50:16] And you are.
[1:50:18] You are way maker, [music and singing]
[1:50:21] miracle worker, promise keeper, light in
[1:50:26] the darkness. My God, that is who you
[1:50:32] are.
[1:50:34] And that [singing] is who you are.
[1:50:38] And that is who you are.
[1:50:42] And that is who you are.
[1:50:46] Oh, that is who you are.
[1:50:50] That is who you are.
[1:50:54] That [singing and music] is who you are.
[1:50:58] That is who you are.
[1:51:02] Oh, that [singing and music] is who you
[1:51:04] are. And you are.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; Yes. And you are way [music and singing]
[1:51:09] maker, miracle worker, promiseke keeper,
[1:51:14] light in the darkness.
[1:51:17] [singing and music] My God, that is who
[1:51:20] you are.
[1:51:22] [music]
[1:51:23] And you are [singing]
[1:51:25] way maker, miracle worker, promise
[1:51:29] keeper, light in the darkness.
[1:51:32] [singing and music]
[1:51:33] My God, that is who you are.
[1:51:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Friends, please take this morning,
[1:51:44] take what our brother said and just
[1:51:47] digest it and think about it. Come back
[1:51:50] tonight and let's hear the second part
[1:51:52] of this. We're so few this morning. I I
[1:51:56] wish we're missing so many people. I
[1:51:58] wish that we had everyone here to hear
[1:52:00] this.
[1:52:02] It inspired me so much that I wish I had
[1:52:04] an hour to preach about it. Just
[1:52:07] tremendous. We came out of brother John.
[1:52:10] We came out of sin and we came out of
[1:52:12] Egypt.
[1:52:14] We went in
[1:52:17] to this to this place and it's been good
[1:52:19] and and and we haven't sinned there. But
[1:52:21] God wants to send us back.
[1:52:25] He wants us to meet God. He wants to
[1:52:27] fill us with his Holy Spirit. Then he
[1:52:30] wants to send us back to get our loved
[1:52:32] ones. Moses's family was still there.
[1:52:36] You know, his sister was there. His
[1:52:38] brother was there. All of his friends
[1:52:40] were there.
[1:52:42] God sent him back and pulled him out
[1:52:46] and used him in a mighty way. And all of
[1:52:49] us, every one of us, brother Paul, every
[1:52:52] one of us, we have that same commission.
[1:52:55] Jesus himself said it. He goes, he says,
[1:52:58] "Go into all the world and preach the
[1:52:59] gospel." He said, "Heal the sick, cast
[1:53:02] out devils, do these mighty things,
[1:53:06] bring them out, make disciples of all
[1:53:08] nations." Amen. Let's bow our heads.
[1:53:13] Lord God,
[1:53:16] Lord, I I'm challenged. I'm convicted
[1:53:20] this morning.
[1:53:23] And Father, I'm grateful. Thank you for
[1:53:25] sending your servant, Brother Joel, to
[1:53:27] us this morning.
[1:53:30] Father, it spoke to my heart,
[1:53:34] Lord. I I've come out
[1:53:37] of these sins, and Lord, let me not be
[1:53:40] comfortable now in this church of
[1:53:41] Midian,
[1:53:44] but Father, let me see you face to face
[1:53:49] as the word teaches us.
[1:53:52] And Lord, may your spirit then guide us
[1:53:54] back to call these out that need to be
[1:53:57] called out. Father, use us. Lord, each
[1:54:00] person in this building. Lord, Moses was
[1:54:04] 80 years old
[1:54:07] when you called him and you brought him
[1:54:09] out of Midian and brought him back to
[1:54:11] Egypt. So, Father, none of us are too
[1:54:14] old. None of us are too young. But Lord,
[1:54:19] let us report for duty as Isaiah said,
[1:54:23] "Lord, send me." I pray that all of us,
[1:54:27] Father, would be ready. And
[1:54:30] Abel, and Lord, show yourself to us. And
[1:54:34] Father, let us invade the enemy's land.
[1:54:37] Let us go and let us take down Egypt,
[1:54:40] Father. And we'll do it, Lord, not by
[1:54:42] our own might, but by a mighty God
[1:54:45] that's with us. A miracle working God, a
[1:54:49] healing God, a God that can part the Red
[1:54:52] Sea.
[1:54:55] Lord, go before us. We pray.
[1:54:58] And Father, commission us that we might
[1:55:01] go back and pull our loved ones out as
[1:55:04] Moses did. In Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[1:55:10] Amen. Friends, take it seriously. He's
[1:55:14] commissioned each one of us.
[1:55:16] You say, "Well, I'm too old." Well,
[1:55:17] Moses could have said he was too old. He
[1:55:19] was 80.
[1:55:21] No, we're not too old. Let's go. Let's
[1:55:24] do it. Let's get to work. There's
[1:55:27] There's work to be done. You with me?
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:33] [applause]
[1:55:37] Give myself away.
[1:55:46] I give myself [singing] away
[1:55:50] so you
[1:55:52] can use me. I give myself away.
[1:56:00] Oh,
[1:56:03] I give myself [singing]
[1:56:05] away
[1:56:07] so [music] you
[1:56:09] can use me. And here [music] I am.
[1:56:16] And here I stand.
[1:56:20] Lord, my [singing] life
[1:56:24] is in your hands.
[1:56:28] And Lord, I long
[1:56:33] to see
[1:56:36] your [music and singing]
[1:56:38] desires
[1:56:40] revealed in me.
[1:56:44] And [music] I give [singing] myself
[1:56:46] away.

[1:57:15] can use me. Take [music and singing] my
[1:57:19] heart.

[1:57:29] sacriice
[1:57:33] in all [singing] my dreams
[1:57:37] in [music] all my plans.

[1:57:45] them in your [music] hands and I give

[1:57:54] Oh, [music]

[1:58:01] so you
[1:58:03] can use me. I give myself
[1:58:06] [music and singing]
[1:58:07] away.
[1:58:13] I give [music and singing] myself away.
[1:58:23] Amen. Amen.
[1:58:26] You're commissioned now. Every person in
[1:58:30] this building,
[1:58:32] you're commissioned to go. First, you
[1:58:34] got to meet God
[1:58:36] and then go and go in the power and
[1:58:40] demonstration of the Holy Spirit. You
[1:58:43] can guarantee that God will be with you,
[1:58:46] but you got to go. Moses had to g up his
[1:58:51] loins and and [music] start heading to
[1:58:55] Egypt. Picked up his stick and he went.
[1:59:00] So, let's go, friends. Amen. Brother
