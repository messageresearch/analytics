[1:02:27] about
[1:02:29] about late 2021
[1:02:32] I I got sick
[1:02:36] um it was like a normal didn't feel good
[1:02:39] type sick
[1:02:40] and it just wore off for a few days but
[1:02:44] ever since that ever since I um after I
[1:02:47] recovered ever since I noticed that
[1:02:49] there was just a few things that were
[1:02:51] just
[1:02:52] not normal it was a bit off
[1:02:55] um some symptoms that were going on
[1:02:58] um you know I wasn't able to to eat a
[1:03:01] lot when I'm that type of guy that would
[1:03:03] get three plates at a buffet
[1:03:05] you know and you know and then dessert
[1:03:08] afterwards right but and I just couldn't
[1:03:11] eat that much anymore and I was losing a
[1:03:14] lot of weight drastically
[1:03:16] um
[1:03:17] my excuse was that oh my stomach shrunk
[1:03:20] when I got sick I wasn't eating well so
[1:03:22] it's because of that you know no big
[1:03:24] deal
[1:03:25] after another thing that is that I had a
[1:03:28] cough it just wouldn't go away and the
[1:03:31] only way to go to make it go away was to
[1:03:34] um
[1:03:35] and forgive me for saying this cough out
[1:03:37] the phlegm throw it all up and I'll be
[1:03:39] fine and you know it was the cold time I
[1:03:42] thought it was normal you know it's no
[1:03:44] big deal it's just the cough you know
[1:03:46] everyone has flame during the winter
[1:03:48] time and then the last thing that I
[1:03:50] remember was um
[1:03:52] that was that was very itchy especially
[1:03:55] my legs and just my arms my my chest it
[1:03:59] it wouldn't be
[1:04:00] all the time every day but it would just
[1:04:02] come randomly but it is frequent and
[1:04:05] that wasn't normal but I I pushed it off
[1:04:07] you know maybe maybe I forgot to put
[1:04:10] lotion so I just you know pushed it off
[1:04:12] and it's everything is fine and that was
[1:04:14] my that was my um
[1:04:17] that's how it was up until February of
[1:04:21] 2022
[1:04:24] um one night for
[1:04:26] some reason I decided to
[1:04:29] um
[1:04:30] take a shower at midnight
[1:04:33] um and usually I'm I don't I don't know
[1:04:36] why but I decided to go take a shower
[1:04:38] and
[1:04:40] put the water all the way hot and I was
[1:04:44] there for a while I don't take long
[1:04:45] showers but first it was just I was
[1:04:47] there for a while
[1:04:49] there for a while and um
[1:04:51] while I was the water was pouring down
[1:04:53] my head I remember getting really
[1:04:55] getting really drowsy and then before I
[1:04:58] knew it I I fell and hit my head in the
[1:05:00] tub
[1:05:01] um I blacked out and I Heard a Voice far
[1:05:04] away and it kept getting closer and
[1:05:07] closer and it was like Isaac Isaac Isaac
[1:05:09] and I woke up laying in the tub and
[1:05:12] there was my mom knocking on the door I
[1:05:14] said open up the door and there I opened
[1:05:16] up the um
[1:05:18] I opened up the door to
[1:05:21] to let my mom in I put on a towel and
[1:05:24] she asked if I fainted I said I think so
[1:05:26] I just woke up in the bit the tub and
[1:05:30] then she saw me and she she said that I
[1:05:31] looked very pale
[1:05:33] because I lost a lot of weight you know
[1:05:35] she
[1:05:36] she was very worried for me
[1:05:38] so then she said oh let's go to the
[1:05:40] hospital and you know and you know moms
[1:05:42] are right so
[1:05:44] but thank God for her so then she took
[1:05:47] me to the emergencies and when they gave
[1:05:49] me a checkup they were asking questions
[1:05:51] what happened you know answering what
[1:05:54] was wrong
[1:05:55] I fainted in the shower and they asked
[1:05:57] if the water was hot and I said yeah and
[1:05:59] they said oh if you were in the if
[1:06:01] you're there for too long then your
[1:06:03] blood pressure will drop and you it
[1:06:05] happens that people will faint all right
[1:06:08] I didn't know that but okay but you know
[1:06:10] they told me that everything looks fine
[1:06:11] except for my heart
[1:06:13] that
[1:06:15] um the my heart was beating a little too
[1:06:17] fast and a little faster than normal
[1:06:20] and it looked like I was anemic they
[1:06:23] said and
[1:06:25] so while we were there my mom was
[1:06:26] explaining like you know the cough that
[1:06:28] I had for a while and you know that it
[1:06:31] won't go away so they scheduled me for
[1:06:33] an MRI just to just to check if
[1:06:35] everything was was okay
[1:06:37] and you know we got to the hospital at
[1:06:39] one in the morning and we were you know
[1:06:42] they didn't put me in the MRI until four
[1:06:44] in the morning so we were there for a
[1:06:46] while and
[1:06:47] while we were in the room
[1:06:49] um
[1:06:50] to give us the results I was thinking
[1:06:52] you know it's probably an infection the
[1:06:55] the lungs you know they'll just give me
[1:06:57] some medicine and go home you know I'll
[1:06:59] call off work since it's too late you
[1:07:01] know I'll I'll skip work that was my
[1:07:03] mentality
[1:07:05] comes the doctor in the room and about
[1:07:08] 10 other nurses surrounding me in my bed
[1:07:10] and they gave giving us the news that
[1:07:14] there was a large mass between my heart
[1:07:17] and lung
[1:07:18] little bits of masses around my chest
[1:07:21] and there was some liquid under my heart
[1:07:25] and the words then the words of the
[1:07:28] doctor
[1:07:29] is the most unforgettable Unforgettable
[1:07:31] words that
[1:07:33] it will still stick to me to this day
[1:07:35] and then the doctor said it might be
[1:07:38] cancerous
[1:07:40] in a human reaction right I my heart
[1:07:42] dropped I I it was the last thing I
[1:07:46] wanted to hear when I didn't even want
[1:07:48] to go to the hospital and that's what
[1:07:49] that's the news that they gave me
[1:07:51] and the net and
[1:07:54] I was just but in my heart dropped I as
[1:07:57] a human reaction right but in the next
[1:08:00] moment I came to my senses and I thought
[1:08:04] no
[1:08:06] no
[1:08:08] I don't have it I don't accept it I knew
[1:08:11] it was the devil was there
[1:08:13] making me try to sign that box of snakes
[1:08:16] brother Brown says that if you sign that
[1:08:18] box of snakes you accepted your sickness
[1:08:21] but even but the deal was telling me
[1:08:23] that my name was on that box
[1:08:26] but I I did not sign it I don't it could
[1:08:29] go right back to hell where it came from
[1:08:33] it ain't mine even though my it's your
[1:08:35] name's on there it ain't mine
[1:08:38] by his stripes I am healed
[1:08:43] Glory your brother bam says if you
[1:08:46] confess your healing
[1:08:48] that makes your body be healed
[1:08:51] if that's what he says for I rather
[1:08:53] listen to what the what the word says
[1:08:56] than what my symptoms says
[1:08:58] Jonah says symptoms are just vanity
[1:09:01] [Applause]
[1:09:03] so it doesn't matter I did I didn't I I
[1:09:07] blocked out the doctor I I couldn't
[1:09:08] believe it no I didn't want to believe
[1:09:10] it it was just the LIE of the devil I
[1:09:12] felt fine
[1:09:14] so I don't know what she was talking
[1:09:16] about
[1:09:17] I never claimed to have it I always said
[1:09:20] the doctor diagnosed me with this but I
[1:09:23] never said I had it I feel like that's
[1:09:26] accepting defeat of what my Jesus did on
[1:09:29] Calvary that that day
[1:09:31] [Music]
[1:09:33] so right over for the doctors it was
[1:09:36] really
[1:09:37] it really is a very risky you know
[1:09:40] situation for my life
[1:09:42] and
[1:09:44] they put me in the ICU right away you
[1:09:46] know they wanted to treat me right away
[1:09:48] it was very it was it was very riskful
[1:09:51] it was too close to my heart
[1:09:54] um and they couldn't take it out because
[1:09:55] it was right there next to my heart
[1:09:58] um so they put me in the ICU so they can
[1:10:01] test me to to see
[1:10:04] um
[1:10:05] well
[1:10:07] the what cancer I had that they claimed
[1:10:09] that I had I um
[1:10:12] and
[1:10:13] I was in the hospital for three weeks
[1:10:16] and in those three weeks
[1:10:19] many many brothers around around the
[1:10:22] world really around the world just
[1:10:25] um sending me messages and and their
[1:10:28] prayers and words of comfort and it was
[1:10:31] and I'll be honest it was overwhelming
[1:10:34] for me to see so much love
[1:10:37] and all I did was cry all I did was cry
[1:10:40] in the hospital is sleep and cry that's
[1:10:42] all I did
[1:10:44] but you know being in that situation
[1:10:47] that's where I kind of examined myself
[1:10:50] examined my life why was this happening
[1:10:54] to me
[1:10:55] you know was it a mistake that I
[1:10:57] committed
[1:10:58] was it a sin I made was it a uh just a
[1:11:02] trial was it um to see what I would do
[1:11:07] was it a trial for my family to see what
[1:11:10] they would do
[1:11:11] so see maybe something that they have
[1:11:13] done it was just many thoughts coming to
[1:11:15] me was it for my church because what
[1:11:18] happened to me really
[1:11:20] um it hit hard for my church only to
[1:11:23] realize you know later that it was a
[1:11:25] multi-purpose that's how God works amen
[1:11:30] they later finally diagnosed me
[1:11:34] with um
[1:11:37] Hodgkin's lymphoma that was the name
[1:11:40] and they told me that I was going to do
[1:11:43] five rounds of chemotherapy
[1:11:46] and
[1:11:47] um
[1:11:49] it was rough it was it was a rough
[1:11:52] um time to go through
[1:11:54] I was just at home just feeling bad
[1:11:57] something new to my body it's a poison
[1:12:01] to kill all the bad but it also kills
[1:12:03] all the good
[1:12:04] but I still was going through it you
[1:12:07] know I pushed through you know my
[1:12:10] my hair fell out you know I had no
[1:12:13] eyebrows I couldn't grow facial hair I
[1:12:16] you know after and after just a while of
[1:12:19] being at home I finally
[1:12:22] went back to church again little by
[1:12:24] little and they would start you know put
[1:12:27] me to play an instrument little by
[1:12:29] little taking it easy they finally put
[1:12:31] me in a song Lead little by little and
[1:12:33] even to interpret a minister at my
[1:12:36] church's
[1:12:37] bilingual so we do English and Spanish
[1:12:39] and
[1:12:41] I would still do chemotherapy
[1:12:44] but I will still go to church and it
[1:12:47] didn't matter how I felt because I
[1:12:49] needed to go to church amen
[1:12:52] and
[1:12:53] it didn't matter how I felt I still went
[1:12:54] in church because if that's the case
[1:12:56] since when did we go off by feelings
[1:12:59] since when did we go off by feelings no
[1:13:02] no you know that no no I was giving my
[1:13:05] sacrifice of praise to God
[1:13:07] and and I claim my victory I claim my
[1:13:10] victory while I was going to church I
[1:13:12] was letting the devil know which side I
[1:13:13] was on
[1:13:15] Brothers If You're Going Through Hell at
[1:13:17] this moment and you're here you're
[1:13:19] letting the devil whose side you're on
[1:13:22] you got to let the devil know who signed
[1:13:24] you're on Amen
[1:13:26] it doesn't matter what you're going
[1:13:27] through Brothers
[1:13:29] you're here and that's what matters and
[1:13:31] I believe God has something for you this
[1:13:33] evening
[1:13:35] there was times where I would do
[1:13:37] chemotherapy that Wednesday morning and
[1:13:40] I will still go to church that Wednesday
[1:13:42] night even to put me the song lead to do
[1:13:46] something
[1:13:47] and I will still do it even after doing
[1:13:49] chemotherapy
[1:13:51] I wasn't forced to do it no one forced
[1:13:53] me to do it I wanted to do it on my own
[1:13:56] because I knew that was my sacrifice of
[1:13:58] praise
[1:13:58] [Music]
[1:14:00] one time brother Daniel came to minister
[1:14:02] at Wednesday Wednesday evening and they
[1:14:07] they it was my turn to interpret the
[1:14:08] minister so I did chemotherapy that
[1:14:11] Wednesday but the Lord was with me and
[1:14:13] after I left the clinic I was I was
[1:14:16] feeling like a million bucks and I went
[1:14:19] and interpreted brother Daniel and it it
[1:14:22] once you see it you won't know that I I
[1:14:25] did chemotherapy that day
[1:14:27] the Lord Will Smith me
[1:14:29] bro brother Daniel said it was just two
[1:14:31] two bald Brothers up there
[1:14:37] and well
[1:14:41] and well I did chemotherapy for for
[1:14:44] three months
[1:14:45] and um and I still give thanks God for
[1:14:48] that
[1:14:49] because there was kids in that clinic
[1:14:51] that have been doing chemotherapy for
[1:14:53] for three years
[1:14:55] and it was still going and doing it so I
[1:14:57] had no right to complain
[1:14:59] I had no right
[1:15:01] to even be offended to what God put me
[1:15:05] through
[1:15:06] it I believe that it's a purpose that
[1:15:08] God put me through it amen I still gave
[1:15:11] him my praise brothers and sisters
[1:15:15] I did it for three months and
[1:15:19] I know that I had no right to complain
[1:15:22] to God
[1:15:25] you best believe I gave my praise to God
[1:15:28] I gave him praise that no matter what
[1:15:32] and you might say brother well that's
[1:15:34] well that's just weird that's just weird
[1:15:36] why would you give praise to God while
[1:15:37] you're going through that
[1:15:40] that's a little crazy in it
[1:15:43] but Brothers I I I'm considered what the
[1:15:45] prophet calls an oddball brothers and
[1:15:47] sisters even though I'm not feeling that
[1:15:49] Brothers I'm still gonna praise him no
[1:15:51] matter what brother and sister
[1:15:54] brother but that that's just that's just
[1:15:56] crazy that's just weird no one you know
[1:15:58] but we're supposed to be oddballs amen
[1:16:01] that's what really Brown said that
[1:16:03] sometimes we're we're supposed to be
[1:16:05] oddballs to the world
[1:16:07] but many times we're oddballs to the the
[1:16:09] same people we sit in church with
[1:16:10] brothers and sisters oh like you know
[1:16:13] what why why why why why why is he
[1:16:15] jumping why is he shouting why is he so
[1:16:17] happy
[1:16:18] why is he so happy because I got
[1:16:20] something to be happy about brothers and
[1:16:21] sisters
[1:16:22] really
[1:16:25] Brothers I got something to be happy
[1:16:27] about brother and sisters and if you
[1:16:29] want to be happy brothers and sisters
[1:16:31] just think about what you've gone
[1:16:33] through where you were and think about
[1:16:35] where you are now
[1:16:36] first if you think about where you are
[1:16:38] now they'll give you some Praise In Your
[1:16:40] Heart brothers and sisters
[1:16:42] and have no right to complain to the
[1:16:44] Lord Jesus
[1:16:46] oh Brothers we're all about through the
[1:16:48] world brother sisters we have no and you
[1:16:51] might say that this is crazy why do you
[1:16:53] have to act like that way you know you
[1:16:55] can't act like that way in Church
[1:16:56] Brothers read Acts chapter two brothers
[1:16:59] and sisters and that settles it that
[1:17:02] settles it brothers and sisters
[1:17:05] my my I love the Lord all my heart do
[1:17:07] you
[1:17:09] amen
[1:17:11] I just
[1:17:13] oh man
[1:17:14] there was I just I was in a
[1:17:16] you know my Jesus had to roll up his
[1:17:19] sleeves
[1:17:20] to get me out of the muck that I was in
[1:17:24] and if he could save me billion sisters
[1:17:27] I believe that he can save each and
[1:17:28] every one of you here I don't know
[1:17:30] what's your situation this evening Lord
[1:17:32] this this evening brothers and sisters
[1:17:34] but I believe the Lord is here amen I
[1:17:37] believe with this atmosphere we welcome
[1:17:39] the Lord Jesus this morning this evening

[1:17:45] and by the grace of God
[1:17:47] I am here I'm I should be dead brother
[1:17:50] and sisters but I am here Brothers
[1:17:54] there was we finally
[1:17:56] [Applause]
[1:17:58] they finally checked me again
[1:18:02] um after three months that's scheduled
[1:18:05] and they saw that my mass has shrunk
[1:18:08] there was no active cells there was
[1:18:11] nothing
[1:18:13] and that I was declared cancer free
[1:18:16] [Applause]
[1:18:22] Ze amen
[1:18:24] amen I'm mine
[1:18:25] that alone brothers and sisters I don't
[1:18:28] deserve it I don't deserve it brothers
[1:18:30] and sisters but despite the grace of God
[1:18:32] I am here I don't know what's the
[1:18:34] purpose that I'm here but I believe
[1:18:37] he has me here just to give my testimony
[1:18:39] to you all
[1:18:41] how many know that he's the same
[1:18:43] yesterday and today
[1:18:45] well just like that the devil is also
[1:18:48] the same from yesterday and today
[1:18:51] they they
[1:18:53] appointed me
[1:18:54] as a recommendation to take radiation
[1:18:58] is just in case they you know it comes
[1:19:02] back just in case it's still there
[1:19:08] so you know I already claimed my victory
[1:19:11] before the doctors told me I was cancer
[1:19:12] free I didn't even accept the brothers
[1:19:14] and sisters but they appointed to me
[1:19:17] just to check out the clinic I am all
[1:19:19] right I'll go to the clinic
[1:19:23] and going there there's this you know
[1:19:25] the doctor was you know just you know
[1:19:28] very he was like a Salesman trying to
[1:19:32] you know get me to sign my name to get
[1:19:34] some radiation
[1:19:37] and that's that's basically it brother
[1:19:38] then it that's how it was analysis and
[1:19:41] then he and then worst of all he said oh
[1:19:43] just you know we want to
[1:19:46] um kill the cancer right and then I was
[1:19:48] like cancer they said I was cancer free
[1:19:49] no no it's still there
[1:19:51] it's still there we just want to you
[1:19:54] know make sure to kill it you know oh
[1:19:56] well that's not what my doctor said they
[1:19:57] said that it's cancer free I'm cancer
[1:19:59] free no no no I don't know what you know
[1:20:01] what she's talking about but you still
[1:20:03] have it so you need radiation
[1:20:07] and that's thinking devil
[1:20:10] that stinking devil
[1:20:14] and I and I just I just I I I can smell
[1:20:17] that like nah you know what no I don't
[1:20:20] let me think about it I said but I
[1:20:22] walked out uh just convinced that you
[1:20:25] know what no I don't need it all right
[1:20:27] that's that's claiming defeat that's
[1:20:30] claiming defeat and I said you know what
[1:20:33] thank you Lord for for healing me and
[1:20:35] that that
[1:20:36] that settles it amen
[1:20:39] I was I and I I felt relieved I felt you
[1:20:42] know
[1:20:43] and and like ever before I gave praise
[1:20:46] to the Lord that he deserves like never
[1:20:47] before and
[1:20:49] and that's you know many times that's
[1:20:52] where I end off my the testimony that I
[1:20:54] would you know give to amongst other
[1:20:56] churches but but late but throughout the
[1:20:59] year this all happened last year and
[1:21:01] throughout the year the Lord has been
[1:21:04] um working in me and and I found you
[1:21:08] know I found out why I had to go through
[1:21:09] all this
[1:21:11] I knew that I wasn't
[1:21:13] um
[1:21:14] and I knew that I I had to be in in
[1:21:17] somewhere else I knew I wasn't
[1:21:20] um
[1:21:21] spiritually right if I can say it that
[1:21:24] way and he was just working up to me
[1:21:26] giving he the Lord put conviction in my
[1:21:29] heart to right my wrongs to finally stop
[1:21:33] to you know I believe that what
[1:21:37] I went through as a wake-up call to say
[1:21:39] stop playing Church
[1:21:41] and that's what we got to do brother we
[1:21:43] got to stop playing Church
[1:21:46] and
[1:21:49] um just you know just
[1:21:51] conviction after conviction
[1:21:53] and there and while going through that
[1:21:57] that's where the devil took advantage
[1:21:59] and you know putting all the guilt that
[1:22:01] I've done in my past and laid out on me
[1:22:04] and say see you're not worth it
[1:22:07] you're not worthy
[1:22:09] you know I was raised in a in a message
[1:22:11] Pew to say I was born and raised in the
[1:22:14] message but that you know
[1:22:17] so I knew what was the truth
[1:22:19] and from then on I knew that you know
[1:22:23] I knew what was right and what was wrong
[1:22:25] and growing up you know that you know I
[1:22:27] did some
[1:22:28] you know might not be big deal things
[1:22:31] but you know according to the Bible is
[1:22:32] still wrong to do and I believe we all
[1:22:35] go gone through that through those those
[1:22:36] stages I don't know what you youth are
[1:22:38] going through right now
[1:22:39] bios no coincidence that you're here and
[1:22:42] that's where the devil took advantage
[1:22:43] and said you know you know you're you're
[1:22:45] worthless no you do you know you you're
[1:22:48] you did all this and and
[1:22:51] look at you now
[1:22:52] and I said man I don't deserve anything
[1:22:55] I didn't deserve the healing I don't
[1:22:58] deserve anything from God and and and it
[1:23:01] would really bring me down
[1:23:03] but there was moments where I would you
[1:23:05] know
[1:23:06] even you mean open up the table app just
[1:23:10] the quotes there it was speaking to me
[1:23:12] in the situation I was going through
[1:23:13] even going to to YouTube to random
[1:23:16] preachings I was just pressing a random
[1:23:18] preaching years ago and it felt like it
[1:23:20] was speaking to me and I feel like God
[1:23:23] had a multi-purpose for me and because
[1:23:25] of what I go through and what I went
[1:23:27] through it it led me to to the beginning
[1:23:30] of this year I was just so
[1:23:34] I I knew I knew were the stage that I
[1:23:37] was at and I knew that
[1:23:40] I didn't deserve anything I knew I knew
[1:23:42] I was I was I just don't deserve
[1:23:45] anything and there was a there was just
[1:23:48] a a moment in time where I I
[1:23:50] I just
[1:23:52] um
[1:23:52] I got sick and tired of being sick and
[1:23:55] tired
[1:23:56] so one Sunday morning I went to the
[1:23:59] altar just you know before service start
[1:24:02] and I just laid it all to God and I feel
[1:24:05] like I confessed everything that I'd
[1:24:07] done because some you know sometimes you
[1:24:10] know your parents know what your child
[1:24:11] has done but you don't really confront
[1:24:13] them into and you want them to confront
[1:24:15] you about it I feel like God knew what I
[1:24:17] was doing knew what I had done but he
[1:24:19] wanted me to confront him about it and
[1:24:22] from there on it was just it was just
[1:24:24] peace it was just
[1:24:26] and that's where it led me to and I knew
[1:24:29] I knew there were some stages left in my
[1:24:31] life that I had to complete
[1:24:34] and then one one Sunday morning
[1:24:37] I heard of a Brother's testimony that
[1:24:40] said
[1:24:41] you know about receiving the Holy Ghost
[1:24:43] and that was those the stage that you
[1:24:45] know I was at I needed to I knew I
[1:24:47] needed to receive the Holy Ghost and
[1:24:49] this brother said that
[1:24:51] you don't ask God for the Holy Ghost
[1:24:53] and I was like what and he said just
[1:24:56] thank them for the Holy Ghost
[1:24:59] because it's a promise he promised it to
[1:25:02] you brilliant sisters
[1:25:03] and I just and I knew that that it was
[1:25:06] speaking to me because how his testimony
[1:25:09] his life of receiving the Holy Ghost I
[1:25:11] was going through that so I just I just
[1:25:14] knew and even the devil tried to put
[1:25:16] doubt but I said no you know what that
[1:25:18] that's you God and thank you for that
[1:25:20] and that Sunday morning
[1:25:22] I just started thanking him
[1:25:24] thanking God for the Holy Ghost
[1:25:27] and just thanking him and thanking him
[1:25:30] and then it was earlier this year
[1:25:32] brother and sisters that I've received
[1:25:34] my baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:25:42] and brothers if he did it to me he can
[1:25:45] do it to you tonight
[1:25:47] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:25:49] forever the same God that poured out the
[1:25:51] holy ghost in the day of Pentecost can
[1:25:54] do it tonight brothers and sisters I
[1:25:56] believe that we're expecting tonight and
[1:25:58] I believe that that's that trial that
[1:26:00] God put me through of getting of you
[1:26:03] know saying that they got cancer and
[1:26:05] going through all those stages I believe
[1:26:06] it all led to the to the beginning of
[1:26:09] the year
[1:26:12] and I just just give thanks to God for
[1:26:15] that
[1:26:16] and that's that's my testimony right
[1:26:18] there that's where it ends and I'm
[1:26:20] praising God no matter what I'm still
[1:26:22] you know just because you got the Holy
[1:26:25] Ghost doesn't mean it's all victories
[1:26:26] and flowers and roses brothers and
[1:26:28] sisters brothers it's been the most
[1:26:31] and just to put it in words the most
[1:26:33] miserable but yet the most Victorious
[1:26:37] and it doesn't matter I can't I can't go
[1:26:39] back brothers and sisters I can't go
[1:26:41] back I just gotta keep going forward

[1:27:06] you all youth I don't know what you're
[1:27:08] going through I don't know if you have a
[1:27:09] sickness but I believe but as a witness

[1:33:36] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:33:39] hey man what a wonderful atmosphere it
[1:33:42] is
[1:33:43] I tell I was telling the brother back
[1:33:45] there I was like you know if I had a
[1:33:47] nickname people would call me teary-eyed
[1:33:49] because I I just you know when I feel
[1:33:51] the presence of the Lord I just became
[1:33:53] teary-eyed you know
[1:33:55] but
[1:33:57] I just want to greet you in the name of
[1:33:58] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:34:00] I come from Glendale my pastor's name is
[1:34:03] brother Daniel fraho
[1:34:04] he greets everybody here in the name of
[1:34:06] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:34:08] I'd like to start with the scripture
[1:34:11] we could all stand up for this and if
[1:34:13] you turn me to John 10 10
[1:34:16] if I could uh just put a
[1:34:19] a headline to my testimony it would be
[1:34:22] called Mercy said no
[1:34:28] John chapter 10 and verse 10
[1:34:34] it says the thief cometh not but for it
[1:34:38] to still and to kill and to destroy
[1:34:42] and I come that they may have life and
[1:34:46] that it may have it more abundantly
[1:34:49] amen
[1:34:50] now Luke and verse in chapter 1 verse 78
[1:34:54] and 79
[1:34:55] it says
[1:34:57] Through The Tender Mercies of God
[1:34:59] whereby the day Springs from the high
[1:35:01] has visited us
[1:35:03] to give us to give light to them that
[1:35:06] sit in darkness
[1:35:08] and in the shadow of death to guide our
[1:35:11] feet in the way of peace
[1:35:14] and uh Genesis chapter 1 and verse 2 and
[1:35:18] 4 it says the Earth was without form and
[1:35:21] void and darkness was upon the face of
[1:35:23] the deep and the spirit of God moved
[1:35:26] upon the face of the waters and God said
[1:35:28] let there be light and there was light
[1:35:31] and God saw that the light that it was
[1:35:33] good and God divided the light from the
[1:35:35] darkness
[1:35:36] you see we know that where when there is
[1:35:39] Darkness amen but when light comes that
[1:35:42] Darkness needs to go away
[1:35:44] you know the devil you may have your
[1:35:46] seats
[1:35:48] amen the devil what he wants to do is to
[1:35:51] stop our growth
[1:35:53] he doesn't want us growing in our faith
[1:35:56] especially when you're you're young
[1:35:58] especially when you're just starting to
[1:36:01] know who you are amen because I believe
[1:36:03] it's important to know who we are as
[1:36:05] Christians
[1:36:06] and uh you know it's like in the CH when
[1:36:09] the children of Israel when Pharaoh
[1:36:11] there's a new Pharaoh that came to the
[1:36:13] land he's seen a great Army
[1:36:16] he see a people that were very Mighty
[1:36:18] but he got his guys and he said let us
[1:36:20] deal more wisely with them
[1:36:22] amen and what he did he said he said
[1:36:25] task Masters over them to afflict them
[1:36:27] with burdens
[1:36:28] amen he gave a Commandment that they
[1:36:31] killed all the firstborn men child
[1:36:33] we see the devil is like a type of that
[1:36:36] pharaoh he sees and he knows when you're
[1:36:38] growing
[1:36:40] amen that Pharaoh saw when when Israel
[1:36:42] started to grow amen
[1:36:45] and he got scared because he saw
[1:36:47] potential of a great Army
[1:36:50] amen
[1:36:51] but let me tell you the Bible says but
[1:36:54] the more that they were Afflicted the
[1:36:56] more that they grew
[1:36:58] amen and the more that we are afflicted
[1:37:00] the more that we grow
[1:37:02] amen
[1:37:04] so when I was a little child
[1:37:07] I was raised in church
[1:37:09] and uh when the church just like many of
[1:37:13] you do you know every Sunday Wednesdays
[1:37:15] Thursdays meetings and stuff like that
[1:37:19] but you know going to school and you get
[1:37:22] a wrong wrong crowd
[1:37:25] and so I I was drifting away drifting
[1:37:29] away drifting away
[1:37:31] and then one day
[1:37:32] I started uh going through a bunch of
[1:37:35] panic attacks and depression
[1:37:37] it's about 14 15 years old
[1:37:40] and uh I remember after I was going
[1:37:43] through those panic attacks in the
[1:37:44] depression
[1:37:46] I just couldn't do it no more my mom
[1:37:48] would take me to the hospital no one
[1:37:50] could tell me what was happening with me
[1:37:52] and uh the doctor said I was normal
[1:37:55] I just couldn't do it no more so I try
[1:37:58] ending my life
[1:38:00] it didn't work
[1:38:02] not tried again and it didn't work
[1:38:05] I finally got fed up with the and I
[1:38:07] remember just going in a room I found my
[1:38:09] knees on the floor
[1:38:10] and I just started crying to the Lord
[1:38:13] mind you I was a kid that wanted to play
[1:38:15] at church when service was going on and
[1:38:17] the Deacon said get back in church
[1:38:20] but you know um
[1:38:22] when I cried to the Lord
[1:38:25] I said I can't do this no more take my
[1:38:28] life
[1:38:29] let me just wake up and not be here
[1:38:31] anymore
[1:38:32] but let me tell you brother I say this
[1:38:34] because
[1:38:36] God allowed me to go through this help
[1:38:39] me to always remember him throughout my
[1:38:41] whole entire life
[1:38:43] and when I said I couldn't do no more
[1:38:45] I'm not kidding you brother when I say
[1:38:47] this I felt something coming to the room
[1:38:49] and just put his arms around around me
[1:38:52] and he says I love you
[1:38:55] he says you're not alone
[1:38:57] I'm here for you
[1:38:58] he said go to church
[1:39:01] amen
[1:39:03] he says go to any church go to church
[1:39:05] and I'll be with you
[1:39:07] I was a little boy amen and I did I went
[1:39:10] to church I put my dad's suit that
[1:39:12] didn't fit me it was like this
[1:39:14] I got my mom's Bible I just walked to
[1:39:17] the first church on around the corner
[1:39:20] and uh someone had asked me really where
[1:39:22] are you going
[1:39:23] and I'm going to church
[1:39:26] and but when I was going to church that
[1:39:28] whole time I felt God that he was right
[1:39:30] next to me walking with me
[1:39:32] but as a teenager I gone bully when I
[1:39:35] was in the church I got bullied you know
[1:39:37] well
[1:39:39] let me just say that things had happened
[1:39:41] and you know I have friends and some
[1:39:44] family that were bullying me about
[1:39:45] little things and I let stuff get to me
[1:39:48] so um
[1:39:50] if you don't mind I'm gonna share my
[1:39:51] testimony how it is amen
[1:39:54] and so uh
[1:39:56] 18 years old comes
[1:39:58] and I I just uh I just started smoking
[1:40:02] started smoking marijuana
[1:40:04] then uh 21 years old comes I started uh
[1:40:08] doing heroin
[1:40:10] for about three months
[1:40:13] and uh
[1:40:14] after that you know I I I just felt
[1:40:18] really low in my life
[1:40:20] but I'd always remember when God came
[1:40:22] into that room
[1:40:24] and uh for the longest time I was
[1:40:27] struggling like that
[1:40:28] I was in a five-year relationship and I
[1:40:31] ended up moving to Utah
[1:40:33] I'm telling you Brothers it got to a
[1:40:35] point when I was in a car and if I had
[1:40:37] been going to some party or something
[1:40:39] like that and switching the radio
[1:40:41] station out here a worship song Come On
[1:40:43] and I'll just started weeping
[1:40:45] crying crying
[1:40:48] you know then turn the channel because I
[1:40:51] need to get into another Spirit that's
[1:40:53] how I was
[1:40:55] I didn't want to get soft that's how the
[1:40:57] devil had me
[1:40:58] just being real with you amen
[1:41:01] and so when I was in Utah
[1:41:04] I remember uh I had not went to church
[1:41:06] in a very long time
[1:41:08] and I remember uh the girls with at the
[1:41:11] time her parents or her mom their
[1:41:15] Apostolic
[1:41:16] and so one day they invited us to go to
[1:41:19] church
[1:41:20] and so I went to a service with them as
[1:41:22] soon as they started singing I just
[1:41:24] started weeping
[1:41:26] crying always just something inside me
[1:41:28] and we know you know God's put a seed in
[1:41:30] there before the foundation of the world
[1:41:33] God knows amen
[1:41:35] and I would just cry and cry and I
[1:41:37] remember I grabbed the the microphone in
[1:41:39] that church and I was like ah you know I
[1:41:41] don't know why I'm crying but I'm just I
[1:41:43] said the God is touching my heart
[1:41:46] and it started there but after that I
[1:41:48] ended up doing the same old thing
[1:41:51] where God slow in that town so I had to
[1:41:53] move
[1:41:54] and I was working in Utah it was St
[1:41:57] George Utah
[1:41:58] and when I was down there
[1:42:00] um I ended up getting let go from the
[1:42:03] job that I was supposed to have
[1:42:05] and eventually I was going to be
[1:42:07] homeless
[1:42:08] I had my car my dad he uh wanted me to
[1:42:12] come back but I knew they went to church
[1:42:14] and I didn't know if I wanted to be
[1:42:16] around that you know
[1:42:18] and so uh
[1:42:19] struggling I remember
[1:42:22] I was proud I was very proud
[1:42:25] and I was like you know I'm gonna make
[1:42:26] it on my own I'm gonna do this because
[1:42:28] you know that's just how I was
[1:42:30] and I remember I had not prayed in a
[1:42:33] very long time
[1:42:34] and this night I'd asked I'd asked God I
[1:42:36] was on Craigslist looking for I could
[1:42:38] run out of room to stay or something
[1:42:41] and uh I didn't get responses I only had
[1:42:44] like forty dollars in my name
[1:42:46] and I remember
[1:42:47] that night though I remember asking the
[1:42:49] Lord I said you know what
[1:42:51] I don't want to be homeless
[1:42:53] I was like give me a place to stay
[1:42:56] I mean no I can't say it was a deep
[1:42:58] prayer but I remember just asking him
[1:42:59] like if I was just asking someone like
[1:43:02] one of my brothers here for something
[1:43:04] just just talking to him like he was
[1:43:05] just a friend
[1:43:07] and I had and I went to work and when I
[1:43:09] got off I was going to eat a hot meal
[1:43:12] because I didn't want to be starving and
[1:43:14] homeless all this going on the same
[1:43:15] night
[1:43:16] and I remember when I got to my car by
[1:43:19] the time I touched my car I get a phone
[1:43:20] call
[1:43:21] and someone calls me and says
[1:43:24] I seen your uh message
[1:43:26] and uh I have an apartment over here you
[1:43:29] don't need money right now
[1:43:31] you can come over here I'll give you the
[1:43:32] keys
[1:43:35] and God got my attention right there
[1:43:38] as a sinner I started I was drinking I
[1:43:40] was doing all this well while that
[1:43:42] happened to me
[1:43:44] amen
[1:43:46] well that happened to me and I and I
[1:43:48] thought about that I was like look at
[1:43:50] the way my life is yeah why did you do
[1:43:53] that for me
[1:43:54] why
[1:43:56] amen
[1:43:57] and so uh
[1:43:59] why I had this apartment now I was
[1:44:01] struggling because I was drinking I was
[1:44:03] I was uh having to wash clothes at the
[1:44:06] laundromat and that was ten dollars
[1:44:08] every time so I mean my money was just I
[1:44:11] would ask my dad for some money
[1:44:13] but um this time I didn't really have
[1:44:15] money I was eating ramen noodles for
[1:44:17] like two weeks Hot Pockets coca-colas
[1:44:21] I'm being serious in one night I don't
[1:44:24] have a bed I'm laying on the ground no
[1:44:26] bed just a blanket a pillow no bed
[1:44:30] and I remember looking around this
[1:44:32] apartment I'm like you know what
[1:44:35] again I talked with the Lord I said you
[1:44:37] gave me this apartment
[1:44:39] because I'm hungry give me some food
[1:44:40] [Music]
[1:44:42] you gave me this apartment give me some
[1:44:44] food
[1:44:45] it was like the next day
[1:44:47] I went to uh to work and after I worked
[1:44:51] that day they asked me to help the other
[1:44:52] guy at the furniture side of the
[1:44:54] business we went and after that job we
[1:44:57] uh dropped off the furniture
[1:44:59] then the the guy tips the other guy 10
[1:45:02] bucks
[1:45:03] but the kid right when before we left he
[1:45:05] turns to me he goes you can have this
[1:45:07] ten dollars
[1:45:10] and so I was proud I didn't want to cry
[1:45:12] just then
[1:45:14] and I went to my job I clocked out
[1:45:17] or I was in my car I was crying
[1:45:20] I started weeping and I was like you
[1:45:22] know what Lord I was like I know that
[1:45:25] this is just ten dollars but you made me
[1:45:26] feel like a millionaire
[1:45:30] amen
[1:45:33] and uh
[1:45:36] times even after that like twice I would
[1:45:38] go to restaurants and they'd just give
[1:45:40] me free food
[1:45:42] the Lord providing for me like that
[1:45:45] so then I ended up going on YouTube and
[1:45:47] it's still on there I can share it with
[1:45:49] you all if you'd like but I went on
[1:45:51] YouTube I had piercings in my ear I mean

[1:46:02] here and just testified and yet you know
[1:46:04] in that condition
[1:46:05] but I made a decision to go back to
[1:46:07] Arizona
[1:46:09] to go to go to church but I ended up
[1:46:12] going to church and I was going to a
[1:46:13] denomination
[1:46:14] and uh it didn't last because you know
[1:46:17] the enemy he brought he brought

[1:46:31] knew what he what he can get me with
[1:46:34] and uh he brought a girl around and I
[1:46:37] ended up

[1:46:45] selling drugs just being real with you
[1:46:48] all
[1:46:49] selling drugs I ended up drinking I
[1:46:51] ended up doing all that stuff
[1:46:53] going from store to store doing bad
[1:46:56] things and uh

[1:48:02] but I know that I knew he had a plan
[1:48:04] though I was like I know you had to have
[1:48:05] something about this

[1:48:11] kind of just out of it and when his
[1:48:13] funeral came Brothers came Brothers
[1:48:15] preached and everything but I didn't
[1:48:17] that didn't turn my life to the Lord

[1:48:22] and my brother my other brother it did
[1:48:25] you know but what happened it was like
[1:48:28] the enemy just knew how to uh
[1:48:31] what to bring around me and I had a

[1:48:38] you we'll go here we can drink here you
[1:48:40] don't need money I got you
[1:48:42] and that's what the enemy tries to do he
[1:48:44] wants to offer you everything in this
[1:48:46] world
[1:48:48] he wants to offer you the money and if
[1:48:50] you're watching things that you're not
[1:48:52] supposed to be watching he wants you to
[1:48:54] he wants you to see how other people
[1:48:56] live look how much money they had look
[1:48:58] how much cars they have
[1:49:00] you know look at all the things they
[1:49:01] have don't you want that
[1:49:05] but two months two months after my
[1:49:07] brother had a
[1:49:09] passed away
[1:49:11] I try to calm down my life from my mom
[1:49:13] and my family
[1:49:16] and uh what happened was is one night I
[1:49:19] got invited to to drink and I went over
[1:49:22] there
[1:49:23] and uh the guy his uh the mother of his
[1:49:27] child was out in a place at another
[1:49:30] party and we went over there
[1:49:31] and the guys pulled out guns
[1:49:34] and so I thought they were gonna get
[1:49:36] shot and see this is the thing I didn't
[1:49:38] want to be known to run on my friends
[1:49:40] and I could have ran trust me
[1:49:42] but I stood my grounds like I'm not
[1:49:44] gonna run even though they ran
[1:49:48] they ended up running
[1:49:51] and when they came close to me they said
[1:49:54] you guys ain't never coming back over
[1:49:56] here
[1:49:57] and as soon as the car started all three
[1:49:59] of those guys started shooting
[1:50:01] and I got shot four times
[1:50:04] twice in my leg once in my abdomen once
[1:50:06] in my shoulder
[1:50:07] and I was bleeding out
[1:50:09] in that moment when I was shot I thought
[1:50:11] about one thing and it's how I didn't
[1:50:13] serve God
[1:50:16] how I didn't how I didn't live the way I
[1:50:19] was supposed to live
[1:50:21] amen what I could have done better
[1:50:24] I cried to the Lord I said give me
[1:50:26] another chance Lord help me Lord I don't
[1:50:29] want to die like this
[1:50:31] I can't go my my brother just just died
[1:50:33] I can't die
[1:50:35] give me another chance give me a
[1:50:37] different testimony
[1:50:40] I went to that hospital
[1:50:42] and four hours later I left with no
[1:50:44] surgeries
[1:50:47] they ended up the blood just ended up
[1:50:48] stopping it wasn't pouring out like it
[1:50:50] was no more
[1:50:52] they didn't have to give me no blood
[1:50:53] transfusions
[1:50:55] amen but even then I didn't quite learn
[1:50:59] too well
[1:51:00] let me tell you one night when I was
[1:51:03] drinking and all that stuff I remember
[1:51:05] my dad it was like a Sunday Sunday my
[1:51:08] dad knocked on my door
[1:51:10] he said it's time for church
[1:51:13] and I woke up and I was like oh I don't
[1:51:15] really want to go but I remember it's
[1:51:17] like the largest do you remember what
[1:51:19] you told me
[1:51:23] look at your dad he just lost his son
[1:51:25] and uh I went I was like okay I'm gonna
[1:51:28] go
[1:51:29] so I went
[1:51:30] you know in the beginning
[1:51:32] I went and you know the Bible says
[1:51:36] that in Luke 15 1 it says
[1:51:39] then he drew near unto them the
[1:51:42] publicans the Sinners to hear him in the
[1:51:43] Pharisees and the scribes murder saying
[1:51:45] this man receive his Sinners and eateth
[1:51:47] with them and he spanked a parable into
[1:51:49] him saying well man of you having a
[1:51:51] hundred sheep if he loses one of them
[1:51:54] does he not leave the 99 in the
[1:51:56] wilderness and go after that which is
[1:51:59] lost until he find it
[1:52:02] amen
[1:52:04] and my dad
[1:52:07] he invited me to church and I went it
[1:52:09] was a good service
[1:52:11] amen I went home and I fell asleep and
[1:52:14] there they left to go to the service
[1:52:16] that night
[1:52:17] and what happened was my mom and her
[1:52:19] heart said he should have been here he
[1:52:22] should have been with us but around that
[1:52:24] time that she was feeling that way I had
[1:52:26] a dream and a dream and a voice told me
[1:52:28] get up and go back to church
[1:52:31] and I woke up and I'm thinking it's just
[1:52:33] a dream but I hear it again get up and
[1:52:35] go back to church
[1:52:37] so I go back to church
[1:52:39] let me tell you a good shepherd when he
[1:52:41] when he sees his sheep that's just right
[1:52:43] there wandering around he calls his
[1:52:45] sheep but his sheep know his voice
[1:52:48] amen and knows his voice
[1:52:50] and in that service they're preaching I
[1:52:52] started hearing a call
[1:52:54] man I started hearing the shout amen and
[1:52:58] let me tell you that shout was different
[1:52:59] than any denomination she could ever
[1:53:01] preach
[1:53:02] amen because when I went in the
[1:53:05] nomination nothing stuck to me that's
[1:53:06] why I kept leaving
[1:53:08] but let me tell you when I heard that
[1:53:10] scream
[1:53:11] something happened with inside of me
[1:53:14] amen
[1:53:16] and I remember after the preaching
[1:53:19] it was like how that young man how he
[1:53:21] had a two sons
[1:53:23] and he gave he gave the one son his
[1:53:25] portion went and spent it on riotous
[1:53:27] living
[1:53:28] and then he started to be in want
[1:53:31] amen he came back
[1:53:33] it didn't matter if he was just a
[1:53:34] servant in his father's house

[1:53:50] amen
[1:53:52] when his father seen him he had
[1:53:54] compassion on him
[1:53:56] and I remember when they were preaching

[1:54:00] preaching the song leader was singing I
[1:54:02] raised up my hands

[1:54:11] but let me tell you how that father had
[1:54:13] compassion on his son I turned and
[1:54:15] looked at my dad and he was crying and
[1:54:18] he had compassion on me
[1:54:22] they didn't do an altar call
[1:54:24] but I went right up to that altar saying
[1:54:27] Lord help me help me Lord
[1:54:29] I need you and I can't do this without
[1:54:31] you
[1:54:33] I need you to help me
[1:54:36] I can't do it amen
[1:54:39] so when that's when that sheet was lost
[1:54:41] and the Good Shepherd when he was
[1:54:43] screaming out and he finally found it
[1:54:46] he found he laid it on his shoulders and
[1:54:48] he started rejoicing
[1:54:51] amen
[1:54:53] brother says did you ever notice Jesus
[1:54:55] when he cast out the devil he'd done it
[1:54:57] with his finger Jesus said if if I cast
[1:55:01] out the devil the Finger of God with the
[1:55:04] Finger of God see what the devil is to
[1:55:06] him for healing is just a little thing
[1:55:09] but watch when the Sheep is lost what
[1:55:12] did he do he went and he got his sheep
[1:55:14] and put it on his shoulders
[1:55:18] amen
[1:55:22] Robert Brown says what's the strongest
[1:55:25] part of a man it's his back and it's his
[1:55:27] legs see the devil is nothing to him but
[1:55:30] the Sheep he puts it across his
[1:55:32] shoulders holds his feet he packs it
[1:55:35] with the strongest of his body and he
[1:55:37] gets it back to the fold see God loves
[1:55:40] his children

[1:57:31] and I took off on him
[1:57:33] he followed me in his car but when we
[1:57:35] got there the deacons of the church

[1:57:52] I know it's special if he did it then he
[1:57:56] could do it now
[1:57:58] he's still doing it
[1:58:01] I walked inside that church
[1:58:03] and while me and my brother because he
[1:58:05] made it the same time
[1:58:07] well me and my brother we ran through
[1:58:09] the door saying hallelujah glory to God
[1:58:11] hallelujah
[1:58:13] and we get back there we had to sit in
[1:58:15] the very back
[1:58:16] and I always I liked sitting in the
[1:58:18] front so
[1:58:20] and they it was like on the back like
[1:58:22] say like where the door is at over there
[1:58:24] and um I was like Lord I wanted to be in
[1:58:27] the front
[1:58:29] I was like I wanted to be in the front
[1:58:31] right when I was going to sit down in my
[1:58:33] chair my blood comes from me and he goes
[1:58:35] hey there's two seats for you and your
[1:58:37] brother right in the front
[1:58:39] the whole church was packed but those
[1:58:40] two seats and that brother that was
[1:58:43] preaching he preached about your your
[1:58:44] mind and suicide
[1:58:48] and man God reached out and gave me some
[1:58:50] strength
[1:58:51] but let me tell you I had panic attacks
[1:58:53] for like almost a year
[1:58:55] I had infected ingrown toenail like
[1:58:58] three times after one just went away
[1:58:59] another one appeared another one
[1:59:01] appeared after I was good from that I
[1:59:03] mean right after each other I I was
[1:59:06] playing volleyball I sprained my ankle
[1:59:08] right after my ankle was healed and I
[1:59:11] claimed I'm like yeah my ankle's good I
[1:59:13] was at work in uh in a wood chipper
[1:59:15] machine fell on my foot
[1:59:18] yeah and I went through four surgeries
[1:59:20] and I remember before the day I was
[1:59:22] gonna have the surgery I asked God to
[1:59:24] heal him I said if you don't I'll love
[1:59:25] you
[1:59:26] but I remember when it did fall in my
[1:59:28] foot I was crying and there's men
[1:59:29] watching me but this time I wasn't proud
[1:59:31] no more
[1:59:33] hey man I started crying and I said look
[1:59:35] I'm not crying because this hurts I'm
[1:59:37] crying because God already knows what
[1:59:39] I'm going through and it's and I'm
[1:59:40] already going through Allah it hurts I'm
[1:59:43] going through a lot
[1:59:44] but let me tell you
[1:59:46] I was going through a lot
[1:59:48] and uh when I went to that hospital
[1:59:51] and I was going to have the operation
[1:59:53] sister called me
[1:59:55] and she said it's these times we praise
[1:59:57] God in the good times and we praise God
[1:59:58] in the bad times
[2:00:00] and I said you're right and I was like
[2:00:02] Lord if you heal my foot in Jesus name
[2:00:04] but if you don't I will raise my hands
[2:00:05] to you and say I love you Lord
[2:00:07] I woke up and my my toe was gone
[2:00:11] but in my heart I wanted I wanted
[2:00:13] someone to come to my room with a guitar
[2:00:16] and people to sing
[2:00:18] it was like either that same day or the
[2:00:20] following day
[2:00:22] a pastor from a church came to my door
[2:00:24] was sung with a guitar
[2:00:26] and people to sing
[2:00:28] and one of the first songs they sang was
[2:00:30] you are worthy of it all
[2:00:32] [Applause]
[2:00:33] I felt the presence of God come inside
[2:00:36] this room
[2:00:37] son I am worthy of it all
[2:00:39] you're not alone amen
[2:00:43] the Bible says that Jesus says come to
[2:00:45] me all those that are heavy laden and I
[2:00:47] will give you rest
[2:00:49] amen
[2:00:52] amen take my yoke upon you and learn of
[2:00:54] me
[2:00:57] for my yoke is easy my burden is light
[2:01:01] see a yoke goes over two animals when
[2:01:03] they go plowing
[2:01:04] to pull a load
[2:01:06] but sometimes you know they they match a
[2:01:08] big one with the little one
[2:01:11] amen
[2:01:12] the reason why they do that because
[2:01:13] they're trying to train the little one
[2:01:16] but see not only does a big one carry
[2:01:18] the load he carries a little one too
[2:01:21] and I tell you what there's one carrying
[2:01:22] the load right now his name is Jesus
[2:01:24] Christ
[2:01:25] amen he's carrying the load off of you
[2:01:28] amen no matter what you've been through
[2:01:31] God will carry that load
[2:01:32] [Applause]
[2:01:34] his burden is lights
[2:01:36] he'll take not only the load off of you
[2:01:39] he carries you also
[2:01:41] but the enemy is going to make you just
[2:01:43] think negative
[2:01:45] look what you did look what you did look
[2:01:46] what you did
[2:01:47] he tries to keep you in that Realm
[2:01:50] but let me tell you
[2:01:52] I read one time of the footprints of the
[2:01:55] sand
[2:01:56] and that touched my heart
[2:01:58] that man that dreamed a dream or he had
[2:02:00] a vision I forgot but
[2:02:03] but he looked back in that the most
[2:02:04] horriblest time of his life
[2:02:07] before him and the Lord were walking
[2:02:09] together he saw two Footprints but he
[2:02:11] said that at the most horrible time of
[2:02:13] his life he said he only saw one set of
[2:02:15] footprints
[2:02:17] amen and he told the Lord he said you'd
[2:02:20] be with me
[2:02:22] where were you
[2:02:24] and he said that's right you did see one
[2:02:26] set of footprints but it was in that
[2:02:28] time I was carrying you
[2:02:32] and God wants to carry you this night
[2:02:35] he's ready to carry you amen
[2:02:38] he's ready to do something for you
[2:02:41] we got to get desperate
[2:02:43] it's not too late
[2:02:45] it's not too late
[2:02:47] amen
[2:02:49] devil could have told Samson it was too
[2:02:51] late for him
[2:02:53] since went into that prison blind with
[2:02:55] and his hair cut off
[2:02:57] but remember while he was in prison the
[2:02:59] Bible said he started to pray
[2:03:01] he started to have a prayer meeting and
[2:03:04] realized everything that he was doing
[2:03:05] was wrong
[2:03:07] but let me tell you but when he got into
[2:03:08] on his knees because there's power in
[2:03:11] prayer that hair that was on Samson
[2:03:14] started to grow back amen
[2:03:18] and God and when when they're going to
[2:03:19] make a show out of Samson he came out
[2:03:22] and he said to this lad permit that I
[2:03:24] touched this
[2:03:25] and he said Lord just once more
[2:03:28] use me just once more and it wasn't too
[2:03:31] late for Samson
[2:03:33] amen I'm closing with this
[2:03:36] brother Daniel Curry
[2:03:38] amen
[2:03:39] he was an evangelist
[2:03:42] amen he was caught up in a Transit I
[2:03:44] believe brother Brandon said
[2:03:46] and what happened he went over there to
[2:03:48] heaven
[2:03:49] and he said I'm Daniel Curry the
[2:03:51] Evangelist my life Journey has ended and
[2:03:54] I come in here
[2:03:55] but they said we don't have your name
[2:03:56] right here
[2:03:58] he said you can appeal your case to the
[2:04:00] white Throne judgment
[2:04:01] he said what more could I do than to
[2:04:03] appeal my case
[2:04:05] and he went into the white Throne
[2:04:07] judgment but he was right there he said
[2:04:09] things were getting brighter things were
[2:04:10] getting brighter amen
[2:04:13] but he asked him we the Lord asked him
[2:04:16] did you live perfect
[2:04:18] nope
[2:04:20] were you honest nope
[2:04:23] and everything that he was saying he was
[2:04:25] guilty
[2:04:26] amen
[2:04:27] but there was someone that stood in his
[2:04:29] place
[2:04:31] and he turned he said I heard the
[2:04:33] sweetest voice he ever seen
[2:04:34] [Applause]
[2:04:36] amen thou sweeter than any mother's
[2:04:38] voice
[2:04:39] and he's seen the sweetest face that he
[2:04:41] ever saw
[2:04:42] amen
[2:04:45] but Jesus came and he said father
[2:04:48] you're right
[2:04:50] Daniel Curtin man made those things but
[2:04:53] while he was on Earth he stood for me
[2:04:56] amen so he says I'll stand for him
[2:05:00] amen
[2:05:02] I'll tell you if you're struggling with
[2:05:04] something amen where there's depression
[2:05:07] whether it's panic attacks whether it's
[2:05:09] the devil just beating you on your
[2:05:11] mistakes amen
