commit myself ask that you take me out of the way anoint me Lord Jesus anoint the hearers and I pray a blessing over this service in Jesus name amen you can all have your seats for a few minutes I'm going to tell a little story that my dad sometimes tells at the beginning I just felt like I should tell it there was a man who went to church one time and he walked in and sat at the very back and the pastor noticed him as he was preaching he had never seen his face before and he noticed he had one of these a notebook and he was writing notes and so the pastor thought oh maybe I'll I'll introduce myself to that man after and so he he got done preaching and then went outside after and never found the man and then next Sunday the man snuck into church again in the back and did the same thing he left before the pastor got a chance to go meet him and he did that a few weeks in a row and finally the pastor thought you know when I call the musicians up I'm going to have somebody sing and I'm going to run outside and catch him before he leaves and so uh the pastor did that he preached his service and the man wrote his notes and he ran outside and caught him in the parking lot and he said hey I notice you've been coming to church for about a month and I haven't got to meet you I'm the pastor blah blah blah and he introduced himself he said uh have you enjoyed the the church he said oh yeah yeah it's been nice it's been good he said well you know I've noticed you've wrote some notes so uh hopefully those are good and he said yeah Pastor you know I just I I make a little chart and I write uh spits and I write seeds and if you say something I like I put it in the seed category and I take it home and I and I you know that's a seed planted at me and if it's something I don't like I write that in the spits and I just I don't worry about it and the the Pastor said well you know that's a pretty good way to handle it could I ask that you add another line and he took the paper from him and he wrote another line and Drew another category and wrote sits he said so whenever you want to write something in the Spitz category just put it in the sits category and just think about it and don't spit it out right away so the man came back to church did his thing and he said okay pastor I'll do that and you know that man after sitting on those things he was spitting out began to dwell on them and realize there was some truth there so maybe I'll say something tonight that doesn't sound quite right I hope you'll understand in my spirit I want to say the right thing but if it sounds like a spit I bet that wasn't my intention and I just wasn't clear enough so pray that the Lord will help me to speak clearly tonight that I can deliver what's on my heart something very dear to me I'm going to read a quote that I came across a few years ago um before I do uh how many people have been going to Tucson Tabernacle for at least five years raise your hands okay keep your hands up how about 10 years or more 20 years anybody 20 years or more been coming here yeah well praise God well it's good to see you I got to meet brother Perry green one time Harmony in the desert when I came where I met the Robson family and my future wife and uh he I told him I'd listen to his testimony and he said young man every word of it was true and I believe it with all my heart and so I have this quote I feel it very special it's from what house will you build me paragraph 22. see this young couple a talented young man I ain't saying that because he's sitting here and this young lady with her babies with his family to raise and he's quit his job and everything to move here and I realized that years ago I was called in the ministry I've never made a successful Pastor because I got a roaming rambling spirit I can't be satisfied anywhere just wherever the spirit moves I've got to move with it because I have a message Jesus said I must I must preach this in this other Town also but there are those who are Shepherds that watch the flock I'm so grateful brother Perry followed the leading of the Holy Spirit and today we have a tabernacle it's a small one that's just good enough to start with to see what the Holy Spirit and then he stops not knowing let's just move step by step now I believe if God has spoke to brother and sister green to come up here and has opened up a place where our children instead of on Sunday morning riding their bicycles and on the streets running around brother Bobby would you stand up we had lunch with brother Bobby today he said this was him riding his bicycle on the street with Brother Joseph and he said instead of on the streets thank you brother Bobby instead of on their streets uh riding the bicycles and running around they have a place to worship they have a place to worship and instead of sitting around and listening to something that we've heard on the radio which is all right but we as this group group of people he continues on we have a message for this day amen amen we we believe that God has given us a message and brother green is I don't want to call him my associate because we are well it is my associate we are together in this message brother green preaches the same thing and the message I believe in he has left his home left his people left his church he was I believe the district superintendent or something of some organizations and gave the whole thing up when he heard this he left everything that was dear to him also to come to the desert just to support what God is giving to us now and now I'm going to read the next paragraph and for those of you who attend here in Tucson Tabernacle I want you to think about brother Daniel Evans and how he's left his home his job to move here to the desert he felt led as he was telling me he felt the leading of the Holy Spirit to move out here and it's so wonderful to see what the Lord is doing so I just want you to think about your pastor as we read this next line I know he's talking about brother Perry green but just think about brother Daniel Evans if this is your pastor and this is your home Church I say I believe it should not only be in our hearts it should be in our duty to back him up everything that we can to attend the services to come here to worship and to make this a place where God can reveal to us the things that he has for us to reveal and his word said the message doesn't come to me through the giving of inspiration but it does to maybe some of us but he said I am here to back up what God has given and he says what a statement and I believe if we all cooperate together we put our hearts to it praise God bless you brother Daniel we're very grateful for you I've had the the honor to get to know brother Daniel just for like a year now he took me and a couple Brothers hiking and uh it was a blessing and I got to see the kind of character that I believe I'm going to see on the other side I I don't see Daniel Evans but I see Jesus Christ and I don't just say that because he's sitting here I say that because it's the truth when I see Daniel Evans I see Jesus Christ and that's that's what we all should want we should want when people see us they don't see Josiah Ajo or Daniel Evans or Joe Robson or Kathy but they see Jesus Christ amen well let's turn to the Bible I've got one scripture I want to read you can all stand up in Romans 11. foreign Romans 11 verse 29. this is a scripture I'm sure you've heard I know you've heard it and I've always heard it misquoted but we're not going to misquote it we're going to read what it says Romans 11 29. for the gifts and the calling of God or without repentance let's read it together for the gifts and the calling of God are without repentance God bless you can have your seats pray for me that I keep my head straight tonight and I say all that I'm supposed to say and that I leave out the things that I'm not supposed to say so it says for the gifts and the calling of God are without repentance and so we think of someone who's gifted to sing and before they repent they have that gift someone who's A Gifted speaker they have that gift before they repent if they never repent in their in their life they have that gift that's how we often use this scripture and uh the Lord has been using me in a way that I I didn't let him do for many years for uh a huge portion of my life I sang for the wrong reasons and I didn't sing to glorify God I didn't sing songs about God and I was in a musical that my father-in-law and mother-in-law and my wife were at and I remember being I was one I was in I was a character in this musical and I was singing songs in the musical and I remember being backstage and changing my costumes and looking down at the floor and saying Lord this isn't how I'm supposed to use my gift and when brother Daniel asked me to speak I thought the first thing I thought I was walking into a store and I was looking down at the ground and the first thing I thought was I'm So Unworthy and that's the truth I'm probably the most unworthy person here it's only by his amazing grace that any of us are saved but the scripture says the gifts and the calling of God are without the without repentance now I don't have the same gift as brother Daniel he doesn't have the same gift as me but it says the gifts plural and the calling so I guess my title would be we are all called no matter what your gift is how many times do you think we focus too much on the gift and less about the call because we're called to follow the lord Jesus and to follow the truth of the word for today but how often do we do we focus on the gifts you know I like the way my pastor preaches and I don't like the way that one preaches and I do we do things this way and we do things that because you're focusing on the gift and not the call we need to focus on the call we're all called to follow the lord Jesus and I've got a couple scriptures on that and I was just thinking as brother Daniel asked me you know would you like to speak Sunday night the 29th January 29th and I S I looked down at the ground and I thought I'm So Unworthy I'm So Unworthy I've done so much wrong I lived so wrong and as he preached this morning in Luke 11 it goes right along with my testimony as from a young age I wanted to do right I wanted to live right I wanted to live for God and you know I clean I tried to clean out all those things but I didn't replace it with something and then the Lord was able or the devil sorry was able to come in that weakness and find that and I'd always fall always fall trying to do good and fall trying to get better and fall always happened it always has happened and uh I'll get into some of the specifics about what it was that made me continue to fall that I I wouldn't I wouldn't give up um but I just want to say that none of us deserve the blood of Christ and that's what the Lord started to say to me as I was sitting I was sitting there thinking I'm So Unworthy and he began to speak and say but if any of us think that we are worthy we've missed it and if we start to think which I have and I repent and say Lord forgive me start to think you know I'm doing pretty good that thing I used to struggle with I haven't done it in so long that thing I used to do you know you're counting the days off you know I've been going strong for so long and if you get that way you'll fall ask me how I know so that's what Romans 11 that is the context of that scripture Paul is saying Christ did not come because the Jews and the world deserved him and he said they rejected him and because they rejected him you were grafted in they weren't ready for it he didn't say now they're doing everything perfectly they're living according to my word and so now I can come that's not what happened they weren't ready and it proves they weren't ready but Christ came because the gifts and the calling of God are without repentance so continue on so let's turn to Amos 8. we're going to talk about a few of the things that we as the Church of Jesus Christ are called to do that sounded pretty Mormon when I said that because they call themselves The Church of Jesus Christ we as as you know the people who follow Christ do you follow Christ this is what we're called to do so Amos 8 Amos 8 11. Daniel Hosea Joel Amos Obadiah Jonah I can name him Amos chapter 8 verse 11. behold don't you love it when a prophet speaks and we have our categories in the Old Testament of Major Prophets and Minor Prophets but they're all the prophets of God the only reason they're called a minor Prophet is because their book is shorter they're still just as gifted as the other ones so I don't know why I said that Amos 8 11. behold the days come saith the Lord God that I will send a famine in the land not a famine of bread nor a thirst for water but of hearing the words of the Lord there is word of the Lord right the word of the Lord isn't gone but there's going to be a famine for hearing it there's going to come a time when people aren't hearing it there's people who have it and there's people who aren't hearing it there's a famine for hearing the word of the Lord the gifts and the calling we are all called let's go to mark 16. pray that pray that this this is clear and understood when when the Lord began to deal with me I was like man this is so good this is so inspiring to my heart then I thought about how I was going to say it I'm like nobody's gonna understand it the whole thing's going to fall flat but that wasn't the Lord telling me that so we're doing our best mark 16. chapter 16 verse 15 and he said unto them Jesus's last words before leaving go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature so there's a command from God to preach the gospel to every creature and there's a prophecy from a prophet that says there's going to be a time when people stop hearing the word of the Lord he didn't say preachers go into all the world and preach the gospel he didn't say only the brothers and now you're thinking well there's you're getting into some dicey ground but you know what let me just tell you a story we were in Flagstaff with Grandma Kate and Katie and we walked into Starbucks and I walked behind them and we walked in and there was a guy over here on a computer and he saw them in their skirts with their long hair and he went like this that might be the only sermon he ever hears is the testimony of Grandma and Katie he saw he saw two pure lives and that's how he reacted that might have been when he rejected the gospel I'm not saying it is but when you go out and live your life you're preaching the gospel and if you're not living a good life you're preaching something that's not the gospel and if it's not the gospel it's of the devil that's just the truth if it's not serving God it's serving the devil and if your life is demonstrating something that they don't see Jesus Christ which I'm guilty they're seeing the devil and that's why Jesus said in Revelation just be hot or cold because if you're lukewarm and someone out there sees you and you do it in the name of Christianity and they see someone lukewarm and they say that person's professing to be a Christian and they see something that's lukewarm they'll think that that's all there is to Christianity come on now go into all the world and preach the gospel you know I was thinking the Lord spoke to me I said how am I how am I going to preach and the Lord said why are you thinking of preaching as Something In a Pulpit and I want to ask you a question and I want you to think about it when was the last time you told someone about Jesus when was the last time you were talking to someone and you said you know what the most important thing in my life because he's the most important thing in our lives right if he's the most important thing in our lives shouldn't people hear about him a little more think in your heart when was the last time you said listen sir listen ma'am I used to be this way I used to do I was unhappy I was depressed I was a sinner but then I met the master when was the last time you did that because I got really convicted because I thought about all the people I had talked to and about how I'd talk to none of them about Jesus and there I was fulfilling that prop that prophecy in Amos that there would be a famine for hearing the word of the Lord because I hold the word of the Lord in my heart and I refuse to speak my my ye are the light of the world Matthew 5 14. hope you don't mind I'm going to read a lot of scriptures tonight that's what I rely on Matthew 5 14. ye are the light of the world a city that is set on a hill cannot be hid if you're really a city set on a hill which is the metaphor he's using you won't be hit even if you want to be if you're really a city set on a hill but I worry that we get lazy sometimes I'm going to read a quote right out of that same what house will you build me the very next paragraph I just stopped and let that sit for a while what house will you build me paragraph 27 I know that each one of you if you feel like I do I am so hungry to see the spirit of God moving I can just hardly stand it is that in your heart is that in your heart to see the spirit of God moving now we talk about that amongst Believers I go up to brother Daniel oh brother Daniel I'm so hungry to see the spirit of God moving Amen brother you know that's what we want but what if I went to a total stranger not a Christian and said you know what I'm really just hunger hung I have a hunger in my heart to see the spirit of God moving how do you think they'd react what do you think that would do to a person do you think they they would ever hear that again maybe they would that's going to make it that's going to make an impression on somebody and continuing in this quote some experiences he said uh uh I'm so hungry to see the spirit of God moving I can just hardly stand it Amen brother some experience I've had up in the mountain just to feel that once again that something that when I was first Saved was So Glorious to my heart and we can come into a place and we can sit and we can see it among us that we are drying as we sit here in the desert I get among my brethren they talk with me and I talk with them always in a little way of watching feeling out there with the spirit as it was to see just the condition of that brother to see what's wrong I begin to feel us all reclining oh getting away from the spirit it's become too natural a thing to us help us Lord Jesus may this gospel may this truth never become something that's just natural to us something that's just so common so happy we're Believers and we just live nice little lives and we go to church let's not do that let's pray if you don't have that hunger in your heart the Lord will give it to you because I didn't have it and I got to a place in my life where I said Lord I want that hunger let's pray that the Lord will give us that hunger to see an outpouring of the spirit of God do you want that that was what the prophet said here I begin to feel us all reclining getting away from the spirit it's become too natural a thing to us we must Worship in the spirit where the spirit of God not only our message should be the flame of the hour it should be the flame of our hearts praise God praise God the gifts and the calling of God are without repentance and if we think that we deserve this we've missed it famine for hearing the word of the Lord a people with the word of the Lord and people not hearing it the gifts of God in people's lives to spread the gospel and people not hearing it the calling of God for those who haven't repented and a famine for hearing what they're even called to think about that think about that these people out here they have gifts in their lives and they they're not hearing about what what is this gift I have this gift and they're using it for something else because maybe they haven't heard I'm so I'm so guilty of this myself I felt on my heart to share it just seeing brother branham's heart seeing brother Perry's heart for this church to see the gospel go out and he says I begin to feel us all reclining getting away from the spirit help us Lord Jesus not to recline not to get away from the spirit but to Worship in spirit and in truth and not just to have it as the message in the word of the hour and the flame of the hour but to have the flame in our hearts Amen to have the flame in our hearts Shine the Light of the World Jesus says at the end of of every gospel they all record it in their own way you are the light of the world he says no man would take a light and put it under a bushel but on a candlestick to light the whole world so just to move to a different part I'm going to tell you a little bit about my personal testimony and I told you how I wanted I had a desire I tried to get right and uh you know I I decided I I would stop talking a certain way stop using words I shouldn't use stop talking about things that I shouldn't talk about stop looking at things that I shouldn't look at and those are all good things all things that hindered me and I prayed Lord what must I do and he said one thing to me amongst others but the one thing I didn't obey and this is my personal testimony he told me to disconnect myself from the things that are taking my attention and he brought some things to my mind Instagram Snapchat YouTube you know what those things are in your life and there was certain music he brought to my attention and I I said Lord I give all my my heart to you but I think I can still have Instagram you know what happened social media and things that I thought were so innocent progressed the devil came back seven times stronger as Luke 11 says he came back seven times stronger before I knew it I was in high school I was with the wrong people I was vaping I don't know if you know what that is I was I was smoking pot I was drinking what started with I can keep my Instagram account and follow the leading of the the Holy Spirit and so then I stopped you know I said I need to I need to get my life under control so I stopped I stopped smoking I stopped drinking I stopped doing all those things I stopped saying bad things I stopped watching Bad Things and again I prayed Lord I've cleaned my life out now what must I do how can you use me he said you know you still haven't deleted Instagram and I disobeyed again and I didn't delete it and I said you know what I'll just not be on it but I'll keep the account and if I want to communicate with friends that I have on social media I can just hop on you know talk to them and then I can hop back off and I'll be okay everything will be fine we'll be good and maybe maybe I would be fine but that's not the point the Lord said get rid of your Instagram account and I didn't and so I fell back in again what I was I said I'll never go back I'll never do those things again and before I knew it I was smoking pot again I was drinking I was doing all those things I said I would never do again and then you know I cleaned my life up again and finally I was sitting and uh in the driveway and Katie had gone inside and I was praying about something very personal and the Lord kind of I won't say he he snapped at me but he was firm with me he said I've told you you need to rid yourself of the things that are taking your attention off of this and right there in the car I just thought Lord how could I be so foolish I tell you what when we do something just as simple as obeying just one little thing the Lord would move on your heart to do when we just do that one thing it's proving to him that we trust him because I stood in church and said I Trust You Lord I love you Lord but this one simple thing he asked me to do and I didn't do it and when I finally did that I began to see the Lord moving in my life in a way I had never seen before and using me and I began to realize you know it's a whole lot easier to go out and tell someone about Jesus because there was no longer that spot in the house as we heard this morning that the devil could come into because I had closed it up I had obeyed the Lord and I said Lord Jesus forgive me I give it to you and I just want to say I will never be afraid to speak against social media it is of the two of you think that I'm going to convince you that it's of the devil I have never once gone on Instagram and not seen an inappropriately dressed man or woman not once parents listen because I I just I'm a kid I'm a kid I saw those things and to other young people you you're not going to go on there and see things that are pointing you towards this and with all that's within my heart I speak out against social media because I've seen it ruin lives and if it wasn't for the grace of God I'd be out somewhere tonight with the wrong people doing the wrong things that I talked about I'm never afraid to speak against those things I believe it's it's anti-word you know brother Branham said we've got the television right in our homes what do you think he'd say about smartphones today he'd say you've got it right in your pocket and so many young people are susceptible to this let's go to let's go to Romans 1. I didn't give the brothers this scripture again if you hear something that you think is a spit just just sit on it it's my testimony What the Lord Has Done For Me just sit on it think about if you if you have social media if you spend time on social media and your social media account is dedicated to spreading the gospel God bless you I'm not called to do that if you are God bless you if it's not think about the time that it's taking away from the Lord you know usually you hear this from someone who's advanced in years who says you young kids you know spending too much time on your phone but I'm in this generation okay I'm only 20. and I absolutely hate social media I've seen what it's done to my friends I've seen what it's done to to people I grew up with so Romans 1 2 and 3. Paul begins to talk about things and I believe it's Romans 1 let's start at verse 25. Romans 1 25. he's talking about all the the wickedness a lot of which we see today they changed the truth of God into a lie verse 25 and worshiped and served the creature more than the Creator who is blessed forever and ever amen for this cause God gave them up to vile affections for even their women did did change the natural use into that which is against nature and likewise also the men leaving the natural use of the woman burned in their lust one toward another men with men working that which is unseemly and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was meat and even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge God gave them over to a reprobate mind and if you read the whole chapter I think this is like the third or fourth time God gives them up to something okay you want to obey me I'll give you up to this and then they continued okay and I'll give you up to this and they kept going further and further and further let's keep reading God gives them up to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient being filled with all unrighteousness fornication wickedness covetousness malniciousness full of Envy murder debate deceit malignantly whisper Whisperers backbiters haters of God despiteful proud boasters inventors of evil things inventors of evil things how do you know it's the smartphone well let's just read the next verse inventors of evil things I lost my place haters of God disappearing unmerciful uh where were we verse 30 backbiters haters of God despiteful proud boasters inventors of evil evil things disobedient to Parents Without understanding Covenant Breakers without natural affection I'm going to say something have you ever heard a better description of pornography than this without natural affection implacable unmerciful who and this was me knowing the Judgment of God that they which commit such things are worthy of death not only do the same but have pleasure in them that do them but then he talks to those of us who aren't in this same road continue in verse in chapter two therefore thou are inexcusable o man whosoever thou art that judges don't judge those who are lost we were all lost I was lost without the grace of God we would all be lost and like I said if we think we deserve it we've missed it therefore thou are inexcusable o man whosoever thou art that judges for wherein thou judgest another thou condemn us thyself wow look at the way they're living sure glad I'm not like that and you're condemning yourself for thou that judges do us the same things but we are sure that the Judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things it's the Judgment of God not our judgment and thinketh thou this o man that judges them with which do such things and do us the same that thou shalt escape the Judgment of God or despise us thou The Riches of his goodness and forbearance and long-suffering not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance isn't that beautiful he just he lists some of the in our minds some of what we think of as the worst sins it's all sin to God but we think of those things wow murderers backbiters haters of God not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance isn't that beautiful isn't that beautiful this is a perfect description of a wretch I was a wretch not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth souls to repentance that's so wonderful God is good so now ing that we shouldn't be judgmental that we are the light of the world that there's a famine for hearing the word of the Lord and we have the word of the Lord let's think about those who do have the word of the Lord I'm going to read another scripture you're probably like man when is this guy going to quit with these scriptures in Galatians 1. we'll praise God Galatians 6 actually you read this at the dinner table the other night and I thought I gotta go write that down you condemn yourself if you judge As Romans said but we have a great responsibility we're not to judge but we are to help one another to love one another to pray for one another to lift one another up that is the truth and so Galatians 6 Brethren this is chapter one Galatians chapter 6 verse 1. brethren if a man be overtaken in Fault ye which are spiritual restore such and one in the spirit of meekness considering thyself lest thou also be tempted so we are called to follow Jesus we have the truth there's a famine for hearing we're the light of the world don't judge but we still have to do something so we got to be careful in what we're doing we don't want the world to feel judged by us we want them to feel loved by us that this is not this is not a Salvation of a gospel of backbiters haters of God lovers of pleasure but let's deal in meekness considering thyself lest thou also be tempted so if you if you're going to help someone doing something wrong how embarrassing would it be if you pulled them out of that ditch not being meek cutting them down telling them how horrible they were and then you fell in the same ditch guilty as charged in meekness you are the light of the world and meekness you're called the gifts and the calling we were all called before we repented I hope this is coming clear I'm doing my best um I have some more things I want to share with you this is uh from the fundamental Foundation 1955. paragraph 23. ye are the light of the world a city that is set on a hill cannot be hid and we tonight don't get mad at me this isn't me talking and we tonight ought to be ashamed of ourselves and honestly and humbly confess our unbelief before God and ask him to forgive us of how we represent him in this life he's depending on us oh he's depending on us backbiters haters of God who were called out out from the world who are guilty of so many things not knowing the goodness of God he's depending on us he redeemed us and then said now go be the light of the world now go preach the gospel to every creature wow every one of you nobody's exempt from this nobody's excused nobody can say Lord I read that scripture and I just felt it wasn't for me I wasn't supposed to share the gospel no excuse this is for every one of us and honestly and humbly confess our unbelief before God and ask him to forgive us how we represent him in this lifetime he is depending on us and I pray that we would be not ashamed as the song we heard not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ I regret to say there's been times I've been ashamed where the Lord's told me to speak he's told me I felt moved on my heart to say something or to share something and I haven't and he says and we tonight ought to be ashamed of ourselves and humbly confess our unbelief before God and ask him to forgive us of how we represent him in this lifetime he's depending on us so just as I wrap this up this patched up spiderweb of a sermon we are all called we're all called to share the light of the world as Matthew 5 14 says you're the light of the world don't hide it under a Bushnell Shine the Light has Mark 16 15 says go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature and as Galatians 1 says be meek in doing it if you see someone in Fault a brother in the church or someone out in the world be meek be humble know that we were there at one point too we were lost many gifts One Call for the gifts and the calling that's how it's misquoted I don't know if I explained how that scripture is misquoted most people say the gifts and the callings are without repentance the gifts plural and the callings plural but it actually says the gifts and the calling and I saw that and I thought why does it say that and it's weird because I actually thought that the way I read it was better because I had always heard it read the gifts and the callings you know the gifts and the different callings but that isn't what it says and I believe there's a reason for that and I hope that this burden that the Lord laid on my heart can become real to you that you realize we're all called we're all called to spread this gospel and so is anyone worthy though no none of us are worthy that's what makes it so wonderful that he redeemed us and without repentance he called us thank God and and we read tonight in Amos 8 11 that there'd be a famine for hearing the words of the Lord which is a very scary thing to think that the word of the Lord is here and there's going to be a famine for people hearing it let that not be this church yeah amen let that not be this church and I'd say that to any church I go to let that not be this church not the building but the body of Believers the body of the followers of Jesus Christ One Church one Shepherd One Church as brother Daniel said let us not let the Lord down as the prophet was so burdened he said let us humbly confess our unbelief and ask for forgiveness of how we represent him in this life let us not be what causes this famine we have the food let's share it for people imagine if there was no natural food in the world and we had food now if you're a good person you wouldn't hog it all to yourself right if nobody had food and you had food you wouldn't just hold it all in you'd say how can we help you know not every we can't feed everybody but how can we how can we get it to somebody how can we share it with somebody if you had a a bunch of food and there were people starving if you're a good person you would feed them I say that you have spiritual food and there's people starving and there's a famine for hearing it because there's a famine of people talking about it there's a famine for people sharing the food let's read one last scripture that I don't know why this was on my heart but it's part of the call that we're all called just before we close Matthew 6 14. we read in Matthew 5 14 now Matthew 6 14. I've got lots of 14s and lots of 11s in my notes Amos 811 Romans 11 something 11 Matthew 6 14. interesting Matthew 6. 14. the Lord teaches how to pray Our Father who art in heaven I'm sure everyone has it memorized maybe you have it hanging up in your kitchen and then he says after this manner pray ye but in verse 14 he says if ye forgive men their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you but if ye forgive not men their trespasses neither will your father forgive your trespasses I don't know why the Lord dropped this on my heart but it's part of the call there's nobody that's exempt from that scripture many gifts One Call we're all called to forgive and if we don't forgive we will not be forgiven think of how scary that is now you might say I forgive you and then go and say you know how nasty that guy is out there he did all this stuff that's not forgiveness that's not forgiveness that's not that's not the light we're supposed to be shining can you imagine if there was someone dying wondering if there's truth out there hungering and then they came to a church that had the light of the world the the beauty the Gospel of Jesus Christ had the truth of the word and then they saw a bunch of people that couldn't forgive one another I wouldn't want to go to church there if I was lost and I said you know the gospel is true let's go find a church and I found a bunch of people who were just always holding grudges and always doing things we're not called to do that we're called to forgive especially if you want to be forgiven forgive and you shall be forgiven so I hope this was okay tonight I hope you I hope you understood it I I felt very nervous coming out here but I felt that these things were heavy on my heart and I hope you know this did something for you if you want to read some scriptures read in Romans 11 about how Paul is talking about how you know the fall of the Jews is how we got in so how about when they come back how much more Glory I I don't I'm butchering that but how much greater will it be the redeeming of the Jews is what he says read about that read about how you know think about how we didn't deserve this think about how how much of a wonderful God we serve and think about those who don't have him think of it as you have food and others don't really think about it that way that people are starving people are starving there's a famine and we gotta we gotta share we gotta give food let's all stand Katie would you come to the piano please I want to sing I want to live the way he wants me to live I want to give till there's no more to give let's bow our heads Katie if you'd start playing that let's try the key of D let's all bow our heads you know in your heart the things the Lord is dealing with you I don't know things maybe you have failed to forgive someone I've done that I've failed to forgive people who who are actually wrong people who actually did wrong things but you know it's not about justifying yourself it's about forgiving even if they were wrong to you we need to forgive maybe you spend too much time on social media I just want to tell you it's not good for your walk with the Lord if you're spending more time on social media than you are in his word maybe you had a real experience with the Lord you've been filled with the Holy Ghost maybe it's as simple as telling someone telling someone how wonderful our God is [Music] and telling him how how Paul said the goodness of God leadeth souls to repentance that no matter what state they're in the Lord Jesus can save them isn't that wonderful let's all pray don't rely on me to pray you know what it is in your life you know what it is in your heart let's all pray together Our Father who art in heaven Hallowed be thy name Lord we're praying for your kingdom to come in this church for your will to be done in this church on Earth as it is in heaven Lord Jesus you fed us not Josiah Ajo not Daniel Evans but you fed us from your word Lord Jesus I pray that you would help us to be a light that we would share this gospel with others Lord that we would preach a sermon with our lives that some would see a group of young people who's not their face stuck in a phone some so much and maybe he's got their face stuck in a Bible maybe he's got not music that isn't glorifying God in their ears but maybe they've got what house will you build Me Maybe they've got a sermon of our Prophet maybe they've got maybe they've got something holy that they're listening to that someone would see that that would be a light to someone Lord if we fail to forgive would you forgive us so that we could be forgiven as the Lord's Prayer says forgive us of our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us and Lord lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom and the power Lord Jesus you are all powerful you lead souls to repentance we're so thankful for you Lord Jesus for the work you finished on Calvary we love you Lord Jesus and we ask that you lead this little congregation lead brother Daniel Evans in the months to come Lord Jesus I just feel on my heart it's such a wonderful thing that this church has a pastor has a place to gather Lord would you use this church to shine a light in the community of Tucson may people see Tucson Tabernacle and may they see Jesus Christ that is my prayer Lord Jesus in Jesus name amen [Music] oh I want to live the way he wants me to live I want to give I want to give until there's just no more to give I want to love to love love love tell

if a young man like our brother says these things that were said tonight amen [Applause] and I know I appreciate it I believe brother Josiah didn't have any spits it was all seats to me and it just blessed me and and Friends remember what our brother has said remember that we can waste our time and we can as we're wasting our time we're wasting our lives away and when we come before the throne when it's our time to leave this world where we look back and say boy did I waste a lot of time on social media did I waste a lot of time surfing the internet or can we look back on our lives and say I did something I overcame it I witnessed I told this world about Jesus Christ think about it there's a time that's coming every one of us when we cross over friends I want to be able to look back and say I didn't waste my time I talked about this book and I talked about the one that inspired this book amen my brother thank you I think it's exactly what we didn't needed to hear tonight let's bow our heads Lord Jesus once again we pray and we thank you thank you for your word Lord I loved all of those scriptures I love those quotes and I loved the words spoken by our brother felt good Lord it felt good to have a little correction and I know that as I go forward I'm going to think on these words that our brother said Lord we thank you and we pray that every person that's been here tonight as they leave and as they go through the weak Lord May these words that our brother said ring in their ears and Lord help us to make a difference in this world in Jesus name amen one more time
