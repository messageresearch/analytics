[0:02] God bless you brothers and sisters.
[0:04] Let's pray.
[0:06] Our heavenly father,
[0:09] Lord, thank you that we can come
[0:11] together and sing songs of worship
[0:15] and now open your holy Bible, Father.
[0:19] And I pray that you would be here with
[0:21] us tonight as you were with the apostles
[0:24] when they wrote these words that I'll be
[0:27] reading tonight.
[0:29] Father, I pray that the wisdom, the Holy
[0:34] Spirit would be with us in Jesus name.
[0:38] Amen. Amen. God bless you. You can be
[0:40] seated.
[0:47] Brother Joseph, Sister Carrie, God bless
[0:49] you. Welcome. I feel like, Brother
[0:51] Joseph, I feel like I know you. And uh
[0:54] have we met before? Okay. Good. Good. I
[0:58] was like, "Boy, I just feel like I know
[1:00] him really well." Excellent. Pray. Good.
[1:03] I'm uh glad that I'm still keeping my
[1:05] mind. Um so what we do on Wednesday
[1:08] night, we have more informal, especially
[1:12] when I'm teaching, we are uh we do our
[1:15] do a Bible study and uh we've been been
[1:18] doing we've been going through with
[1:20] brother Lyall, brother Josiah. We've
[1:22] been going through praise and worship
[1:24] through the Bible. and tonight and I've
[1:27] been answering some questions that we've
[1:29] received from the congregation over the
[1:31] past uh couple months or so. I've gone
[1:34] through a number of these questions and
[1:36] tonight um what I would like to do is I
[1:39] would like to answer two of these
[1:40] questions and then like we did last time
[1:42] I thought it was really nice when we
[1:44] opened up the forum to anyone else that
[1:47] wanted to ask any questions or maybe
[1:49] something I said that was unclear and uh
[1:51] or would like a little bit further
[1:53] explanation. So, we'll do that. I'll try
[1:55] to get through in a reasonable amount of
[1:57] time and then uh hopefully we'll be able
[2:00] to answer um we'll be able to contribute
[2:03] from the from the audience. U the first
[2:06] there are two questions tonight. Uh the
[2:08] first one is why do I use different
[2:12] translations of the Bible other than the
[2:14] King James version? I actually have not
[2:16] received that question from the
[2:18] audience, but I just felt like I felt
[2:21] like maybe there was a question in the
[2:23] audience and maybe people didn't want to
[2:25] ask, but I want to answer that one. That
[2:27] one came from me. It didn't come from
[2:29] anyone, but I thought that it would be
[2:31] good if I address that. And then the
[2:33] second one is I have received this from
[2:37] a couple different sources
[2:39] is how should the gifts be operating in
[2:41] the church or what kind of gifts should
[2:43] we have in the church or do we have the
[2:45] gifts operating in our church? So that's
[2:48] the second one. The second one I could
[2:49] take a series of sermons on. I'll try to
[2:52] go fairly quickly on both of them. The
[2:55] first one, why do I use other
[2:57] translations other than the King James
[2:59] Bible? It's a good it's a good question
[3:02] and as I said no one asked me but I
[3:05] thought that is probably on the minds of
[3:08] many folks. The u we use in this church
[3:12] we use the King James Bible the old King
[3:14] James and uh the old King James the
[3:18] first publication of it was in6004
[3:23] and um if you read a6004 King James
[3:27] Bible you would not be able to read it.
[3:29] It doesn't make sense. It's literally a
[3:33] different language. It was a English
[3:35] translation and it was a very good
[3:37] English translation, but it's a
[3:40] different language than we speak in our
[3:42] modern English today. The King James
[3:45] Bible was written not by King James.
[3:50] There was a number uh I think around
[3:52] 4950 somewhere around that of scholars
[3:56] that were brought together in England
[3:58] and the king was having political
[4:00] problems in his country. King James was
[4:05] and there was a lot of fighting and most
[4:08] of the fighting back then as when
[4:09] throughout history was religious
[4:12] fighting
[4:14] and there was the church of England and
[4:18] the King James King James wanted to
[4:22] bring his kingdom together
[4:25] and the best way to do that was
[4:28] obviously to get them on the same page
[4:30] religiously.
[4:31] So he got these scholars together and
[4:34] they were the best of the best
[4:37] and they translated the King James
[4:40] Bible. They used a lot of uh William
[4:42] Tinddale's work previous to them and
[4:45] other Bibles as a as a manuscript and
[4:48] they came up with this really
[4:50] masterpiece
[4:52] of the King James translation. It was
[4:55] the first
[4:58] uh publication
[5:00] ever printed on movable type which was
[5:05] the Gutenberg press. So we we take it
[5:08] for granted now. We get magazines and we
[5:10] have our Bibles here and whatever it
[5:12] might be. But before there was no
[5:14] movable type. There was no way to
[5:15] mass-produce printing. There were
[5:17] scribes and there were other ways of
[5:19] doing it. But the Gutenberg press made
[5:22] it to where they could print a lot of a
[5:25] lot of the same copies and it actually
[5:27] moved into newspapers and that type of
[5:29] thing. But the first thing was the Bible
[5:33] was the English Bible that was printed
[5:35] on this Gutenberg press.
[5:37] Um then
[5:40] a few hundred years passed,
[5:43] language changed quite a bit and then in
[5:46] 1769
[5:48] another King James Bible was printed and
[5:53] translated. So our King James Bible is
[5:56] not actually the original King James.
[5:58] Just so you know that it this ours is
[6:02] another iteration of the King James and
[6:04] this one was more understandable more it
[6:08] was it it came up to the modern language
[6:12] of that day in the mid700s.
[6:16] Now you've heard people maybe say well I
[6:20] like I just want to use the King James.
[6:23] I I I don't want anything else. Brother
[6:24] Brandham use the King James. That's not
[6:26] true. Brother Brandham used whatever he
[6:29] had at his at his disposal. He used
[6:33] what's called the um the Young's
[6:35] translation, which was not a very good
[6:36] Bible at all was was one one scholar
[6:40] translated um this Bible, but brother
[6:44] Brandham referred to that. And then
[6:46] another one was the Revised
[6:49] Bible. He referred to that one also. In
[6:52] fact, he would often go to those Bibles
[6:55] and say, "Now, the King James isn't
[6:56] correct here." and he would go to those.
[6:58] You just have to listen to the tapes and
[7:00] that's there. So when people say that
[7:02] they I use the King James be because
[7:04] brother Brandham used the King James
[7:06] that's that's mistaken.
[7:08] That may be your reason but that's not
[7:10] what he did. He used whatever resources
[7:13] he had and the reality was back when he
[7:17] was here there were not very good
[7:19] translations of the Bible. King James
[7:21] was excellent and it was the very best
[7:25] that he had at the time and he used as I
[7:28] said he used many different
[7:29] translations. He well he didn't use many
[7:33] of them because but he used everything
[7:34] that was available and also he didn't
[7:37] have the luxury of the internet of or of
[7:39] a phone. Books were expensive back then.
[7:42] We don't understand that today. A Bible
[7:45] was a very expensive thing, especially
[7:48] in the 17 1800s. They um many times the
[7:53] Catholic Church or the Anglican church
[7:55] or whatever it was, they would have a
[7:57] Bible that people could read, but they
[7:59] chained it to the pulpit. So, you could
[8:02] go up and read it, but they were so
[8:05] valuable that and and so rare that they
[8:08] kept it they kept it chained to the
[8:10] pulpit in the church. So then time
[8:15] passed
[8:16] and really the King James was it's still
[8:22] outstanding.
[8:23] Then came the New International Version
[8:26] in 1978.
[8:28] This was the first legitimate good
[8:31] translation now since the King James in
[8:34] my opinion. Now when you when you
[8:36] translate something many of you speak
[8:39] Spanish
[8:40] you don't want to um well
[8:44] we need to be careful about in our
[8:47] absolutism with English all right King
[8:50] James is English okay in Spanish what is
[8:53] it brother in the rain of valera I
[8:56] believe there's a rea 1909 then there's
[8:58] another rea
[9:00] uh 1960
[9:03] I believe and updated ated version. So
[9:06] when you hear King James, it's English.
[9:09] And I've heard people saying, "Well, we
[9:11] want a King James Bible in in Chinese."
[9:14] That doesn't make sense. King James is
[9:16] English. The original Bible was written
[9:22] either in Hebrew in the Old Testament.
[9:24] There's a little bit in Aramaic, which
[9:26] is a form of Hebrew in the Old
[9:28] Testament, and then the New Testament
[9:30] was written in Greek. It was the common
[9:33] language of that time. So when you say
[9:36] that you go back to the original Greek,
[9:38] we're generally talking about the New
[9:40] Testament. It was written in Greek. And
[9:43] this is one of the most wonderful
[9:44] things.
[9:46] The Hebrews, the Jews are the ones that
[9:49] wrote the Bible.
[9:51] Why didn't they write it in Hebrew?
[9:54] If they would have written it in Hebrew,
[9:56] then the Romans wouldn't have been able
[9:57] to read it because they didn't speak
[9:59] Hebrew. They spoke Greek. So they wrote
[10:02] the original Bible as a an evangelistic
[10:07] tool. They wanted everyone to have it.
[10:10] So they wrote their their letters and
[10:12] they wrote their their gospels in Greek
[10:15] so that others could read those. So
[10:18] that's when you say go back to the
[10:19] original Greek. It is the original
[10:21] Greek. But the L speaks Hebrew. He's
[10:23] been studying Hebrew. He It's beautiful
[10:25] that the Hebrew language is the same as
[10:27] it was thousands of years ago. and he
[10:31] can go back and he can look at actually
[10:32] look at the original manuscripts right
[10:34] brother Lyall and you can actually read
[10:35] them and with Greek they can go back a
[10:40] Greek scholar can go back to the
[10:42] original Greek and translate it all
[10:44] right but the King James is an English
[10:48] translation and when you translate
[10:50] something you always want to go back to
[10:53] the original because if you go from and
[10:56] I've done this um obviously I don't
[10:59] speak any other languages But I I've
[11:00] worked with translations. You don't want
[11:02] to go from English to French to say
[11:05] Lingala in Congo or let's say uh you
[11:10] don't want to go from English to Swahili
[11:13] to uh what whatever the local dialect is
[11:16] in Kenya. All right? You don't want to
[11:18] you don't want to do that. You want to
[11:20] go straight from English to the language
[11:22] because if you put another language in
[11:24] there, you're going to introduce error.
[11:27] So the the King James Bible, you don't
[11:30] want to translate something from the
[11:32] King James. You want to translate from
[11:33] the original Greek. You need someone
[11:35] that is fluent in Greek and whatever
[11:38] language it's going into to translate
[11:40] that. All right, are we together? So
[11:43] then in 1978,
[11:45] the New International Version came out.
[11:49] Excellent translation.
[11:52] It is about like the King James as far
[11:55] as the accuracy. maybe a little bit more
[11:57] paraphrased than the King James is. Then
[12:01] in 1979, right after the New
[12:04] International Version came out, came the
[12:05] New King James. The New King James took
[12:09] the Old King James
[12:12] and as a manuscript and it tried to
[12:15] tried to keep the same flow as the old
[12:19] King James. That's why most of the time
[12:22] when I read another translation now it's
[12:24] the New King James because I know you're
[12:26] looking up here or you're looking in
[12:28] your Bible and I want it to flow the
[12:30] same way as the old King James does.
[12:33] Right? We're together. Then after that
[12:35] in 2001 and there's there's lots of
[12:38] other translations in here but these are
[12:40] the translations that I use. After that
[12:43] in 2001 came the English Standard
[12:45] Version. English Standard Version is
[12:48] pretty
[12:50] it's pretty on the mark, but it doesn't
[12:54] have that flow that the NIV has or that
[12:58] the King James has. It seems to me, and
[13:01] this is just my opinion, the New King
[13:03] James and the NIV, they really flow
[13:06] nice. But the English Standard Version
[13:09] very I think I believe it's very
[13:11] accurate and very to the point, but it's
[13:14] a little uh a little bit harder maybe to
[13:17] read. And then another translation that
[13:21] I use is the New Living Translation that
[13:24] came out in uh 1996 and uh I think and
[13:30] it's an very paraphrased version, very
[13:35] easy to read. If you're listening to
[13:38] your Bible, the New Living Translation
[13:41] is a joy to listen to and you get the
[13:45] meaning behind the scriptures. But what
[13:48] the authors did is they took the the
[13:51] original Greek or Hebrew or whatever the
[13:53] source language was and they made it
[13:55] readable into into a more understandable
[14:00] Bible. Many of you have asked me, many
[14:03] of the new, maybe no one in here, but
[14:06] many of the new members we have in the
[14:08] church have asked me, "What Bible should
[14:10] I get?" And and to me, when you start
[14:13] New Living Translation's wonderful,
[14:16] it'll give you an understanding of what
[14:18] you're reading.
[14:19] Let me give you an example. And I want
[14:22] to read this. This is when we get into
[14:23] gifts. I want to read this scripture.
[14:25] Let's turn to if you could give me uh
[14:28] sister Rachel if you could give me
[14:30] Romans 12
[14:32] 12:8.
[14:35] And this is talking about the gifts in
[14:37] church. And this is what we're going to
[14:38] go to. If you could put the King James
[14:40] version of Romans 128 up there. And it
[14:44] says this. Or he that exhortth on
[14:46] exhortation. We we understand that's
[14:49] actually this pretty much the same in
[14:50] all the translations. Or he that
[14:52] exhortth on exhortation. Now listen to
[14:55] this. He that giveth,
[14:58] let him do it with simplicity.
[15:00] He that ruleth with diligence, and he
[15:02] that showeth mercy with ch cheerfulness.
[15:05] Let me go back to that. He that giveth,
[15:07] he that gives,
[15:09] let him do it with simplicity. What does
[15:12] that mean?
[15:14] Now this is 400y old English. What does
[15:18] it mean? He that gives, let him give
[15:20] with simplicity. All right. Now think
[15:23] about it. Now, have it in your mind what
[15:25] it is. The original Greek,
[15:29] it's this word. It's a noun. Simplicity.
[15:33] Please, uh, if you could keep it up
[15:35] there. There we go. Um, the original
[15:38] Greek is a noun. And I'm not even going
[15:40] to try to pronounce it. I don't speak
[15:42] Greek. H A P L O T.
[15:47] That is simplicity. All right. That is
[15:50] that is what the English word
[15:53] translated into simplicity in6004.
[15:57] It means generosity
[16:02] completely.
[16:04] English has changed the meaning of that
[16:08] word. So it doesn't mean what the
[16:10] original means. It literally means
[16:13] generosity.
[16:14] And the best word for generosity in6004
[16:17] and in 1769 was simplicity.
[16:21] English Standard Version says this verse
[16:23] 8 keeps the King James up there. The one
[16:25] who exhorts in his exhortation. The one
[16:28] who contributes in generosity.
[16:33] The one who leads with zeal. The one who
[16:36] does acts of mercy with cheerfulness.
[16:39] All right. Now we're going to now let's
[16:40] go to the New King James in verse eight.
[16:42] It says, "He who exhorts in exhortation,
[16:45] he who gives with liberality,
[16:50] gives liberally, gives generously,
[16:53] trying to trying to follow the same flow
[16:55] as the King James. He who leads with
[16:57] diligence, he who leads with diligence,
[17:00] he who shows mercy with cheerfulness."
[17:03] Let's go to the next verse. Verse number
[17:05] nine. Now, this is these this is the
[17:07] scripture that I was just going to read
[17:08] today. I was like, you know what? It
[17:10] would be good to go through the
[17:11] different translations.
[17:13] Verse number nine, let love be without
[17:15] dissimulation. Who knows what that
[17:18] means?
[17:21] No hands.
[17:23] Let love be without dissimulation.
[17:26] Abore that which is evil. I think we all
[17:28] know what that means, right? Abore is an
[17:31] older word, but means hate. Cleave to
[17:34] that which is good. Dissimulation.
[17:38] Let love be without dissimilation.
[17:41] The original Greek word is a n y p o k k
[17:45] r i t os
[17:48] and it means unfeigned or genuine or
[17:52] sincere.
[17:55] English standard version says let love
[17:57] be genuine. Very to the point English
[18:00] Standard Version is let love be genuine.
[18:03] Abore what is evil. Hold fast to what is
[18:06] good. New King James says this, "Let
[18:09] love be without hypocrisy.
[18:15] Abore that which is evil and cling to
[18:16] that which is good."
[18:19] NIV.
[18:21] All right. NIV is, as I said, it's a
[18:24] real nice readable text. Love must be
[18:28] sincere.
[18:30] Hate what is evil. Cling to what is
[18:33] good.
[18:35] New Living Translation. This is the more
[18:37] paraphrased version. It says, "Don't
[18:39] just pretend to love others. Really love
[18:42] them. Hate what is wrong and hold
[18:45] tightly to what is good." Very
[18:48] understandable,
[18:50] but not a direct translation.
[18:53] All right? But understandable, you get
[18:56] the meaning. It's paraphrase. Now, there
[18:58] is another Bible that I've actually seen
[19:00] some of the people in this church carry.
[19:03] It's called the Message Bible. Just
[19:05] because it says message on it doesn't
[19:06] mean that it's right. The Message Bible.
[19:10] I do not have a good opinion of that
[19:12] one. Here's what the Message Bible says.
[19:14] It's a very very paraphrase version.
[19:17] Sorry, Sister Rachel. Can you put the
[19:18] Thank you. It's a very, very paraphrased
[19:20] version. The me the Message Bible says
[19:23] this. Love from the center of who you
[19:25] are. Don't fake it. Run for dear life
[19:28] from evil. Hold on for dear life to
[19:32] good.
[19:33] All right. So, it's Yeah, I get it, but
[19:37] it's a little over the top. And just
[19:39] these are my opinions.
[19:41] I mean, it's it's understandable, but I
[19:44] would recommend another um translation
[19:47] other than that one. So, it's in Common
[19:50] English, the Message Bible. It gets it
[19:51] gets the point across, but I that's not
[19:54] one that I would quote. All right.
[19:57] So that's why and I wanted to stay short
[20:01] on the Bible translations. That's why
[20:05] that I reference different translations
[20:09] because I want us to understand
[20:13] the the King James Bible. I think is
[20:15] beautiful. And I like using the King
[20:17] James Bible because it's what we
[20:18] memorize. All of us grew up reading it.
[20:22] And I like I want to I like staying with
[20:24] it. If the church wanted to move to
[20:26] another Bible, I'd probably encourage
[20:29] the New King James. But I think that the
[20:32] the old King James is good because it's
[20:34] just what we know. And I can continue to
[20:37] go on and continue to read other
[20:39] translations of that. Um, but uh so
[20:44] that's that's why it's an answer to the
[20:46] question that wasn't asked, but that you
[20:48] all thought.
[20:50] That's that's why I use different
[20:52] translations. And I I believe that using
[20:55] these other translations, I have an app
[20:58] that I use that has five different
[21:00] translations in line. And that's how I
[21:02] read my Bible. I just scroll through
[21:04] this app and I have all of my
[21:06] translations there. And I I um it's
[21:08] funny because my eyes usually go between
[21:13] two translations on my app. I have the
[21:15] King James, the New King James, um the
[21:19] uh New Living Translation,
[21:22] the NIV,
[21:24] and the ESV. And my eyes go to the New
[21:27] King James and the u the New Living
[21:30] Translation. I don't know why, but those
[21:33] are the ones that I usually go to when I
[21:34] when I'm reading. They seem to be the
[21:35] most understandable for me. The New King
[21:37] James because it's what I'm used to and
[21:40] and it brings back my memories of the
[21:41] scripture. and then the New Living
[21:43] Translation because it it is easy to
[21:45] understand. So that's
[21:48] why and now I want to move on to the
[21:52] next subject and I'll I'll try to do
[21:54] this in about 15 or 20 minutes and then
[21:56] we can open up to questions about the
[21:57] Bible translations or about the gifts in
[22:00] the church.
[22:04] The gifts friends are
[22:07] I believe it's part of God. God is a God
[22:10] that gives gifts as the Bible said to
[22:12] men. I was Stephanie and I were visiting
[22:16] somebody in the hospital the other day
[22:19] and uh it's a young man that has um
[22:25] cancer and is very late stages in cancer
[22:28] and he's in a tough spot
[22:31] and
[22:33] I um
[22:35] we prayed for him and and I've prayed
[22:38] for people and I've seen them be healed.
[22:41] I've prayed for One of the most
[22:43] outstanding ones is I prayed for a man
[22:46] who had um hepatitis
[22:48] and he came in
[22:51] with his before
[22:53] um hepatitis test that showed that he
[22:56] had hepatitis and then after we prayed
[22:59] he came back and with his negative test
[23:02] completely healed. So, I've seen people
[23:05] healed at at my prayer. And many of you,
[23:08] I'm sure, have been have been healed
[23:10] when uh when when we've come up for
[23:12] prayer or whatever it might be.
[23:15] But I genuinely pray
[23:19] that the Lord would send the gift of
[23:22] healing into our church into a brother
[23:25] or a sister or many brothers or many
[23:27] sisters. I don't believe it's
[23:28] necessarily my calling. I believe all of
[23:31] us are called to pray for the sick. But
[23:33] then there is a special gift that some
[23:36] people have that God anointed them with
[23:40] to be a blessing to the people to be a
[23:43] blessing to the church. I wish that we
[23:47] had that and I I believe that we do have
[23:49] that in our church and I would like to
[23:51] see it manifested. I would like to see
[23:53] it um more in action. And it, as I said,
[23:59] I pray I've prayed for people as I'm
[24:02] sure you have and they've been healed,
[24:05] but that's not my gift. I believe it's
[24:09] others. And I would love to see this
[24:12] young man healed. I would love to see
[24:15] this gift in operation, not for our
[24:17] church. And that's one of the things I'm
[24:20] going to talk about in the gifts. The
[24:22] gift is not to glorify the person
[24:26] praying or to glorify the church that
[24:29] this person comes from. The gift is to
[24:32] glorify God.
[24:35] That is the main thing. But I think so
[24:37] often we lose focus.
[24:40] And we want to see gift gifts mainly a
[24:45] most of the time and search yourselves.
[24:48] We want to see gifts maybe to vindicate
[24:50] how we believe,
[24:53] maybe to make us feel better when we go
[24:55] to bed at night. I'm right.
[24:59] But what should really be focusing on is
[25:02] the whole reason that God gives the
[25:04] gifts.
[25:07] To me, there are two reasons that God
[25:10] sends gifts into the church. And I'm
[25:12] talking about tongues. I'm talking about
[25:14] prophecy. I'm talking about healing. I'm
[25:16] talking about miracles. I'm talking
[25:17] about all the gifts that God places into
[25:19] the church. I really believe that we can
[25:22] put these two reasons for God to give
[25:26] gifts into the church. And remember, I
[25:28] keep telling the congregation over the
[25:30] past couple weeks, don't be afraid to
[25:32] ask why.
[25:35] If you hear something from the pulpit,
[25:37] if there's a doctrine that that you
[25:39] you've listened to your whole life,
[25:41] don't be afraid to ask why do I believe
[25:44] this? And there needs to be an answer.
[25:48] And the answer is not just well just
[25:51] just believe it and and then the Lord
[25:53] will reveal it to you. No, you have to
[25:55] find it in the word here. And really I
[25:59] believe that the two reasons that God
[26:01] sends gift in into the church is number
[26:04] one to introduce God. And that is to
[26:08] point people today point people to
[26:10] Jesus. When Jesus came on the scene
[26:13] 2,000 years ago, the first things that
[26:16] he started doing was started doing
[26:17] miracles,
[26:19] healing, turning the water into wine,
[26:22] doing these these things that no one
[26:23] could do. And what it did is it got the
[26:25] people's attention to focus on Jesus.
[26:29] And then after Jesus, then the disciples
[26:33] started doing miracles. Why? For the
[26:35] same reason.
[26:37] To point people to Jesus Christ. to
[26:40] point people to Christianity.
[26:42] Number one reason
[26:45] is to point people to God, to have them
[26:48] give their lives to God, to introduce
[26:52] them to God, to show them God is here.
[26:55] God is real. And that's what I mean all
[26:58] through from Jesus's whole ministry, the
[27:00] miracles, miracles, miracles. It was
[27:02] because God and Jesus was getting their
[27:05] attention saying that this gospel is the
[27:08] truth. Not pointing them to a church,
[27:11] not pointing them to a man other than
[27:14] Christ. Then the disciples came and they
[27:17] did the same thing. And they were doing
[27:20] they were establishing Jesus's ministry
[27:23] with miracles to show that that the
[27:27] Christ that they were preaching was
[27:29] real. I challenge you in the book of
[27:32] Acts, go there. There are miracles all
[27:35] the time and it is always pointing
[27:38] people to Christ.
[27:41] That is the main reason. Get them
[27:44] excited. Show them God's real and then
[27:47] the miracle happens and it brings them
[27:49] to God. To God. Number one. And then
[27:52] number two,
[27:55] God is kind.
[27:57] God's loving. He doesn't want us to
[27:59] suffer. He wants to heal us. He wants us
[28:03] He wants to deliver us from evil.
[28:06] He wants to save us. He wants to save
[28:09] our children, our grandchildren.
[28:11] He loves us. He's kind. Just like, boy,
[28:14] going to the hospital, me and Stephanie.
[28:17] You know, I would have done anything to
[28:20] see this boy healed.
[28:23] I believe God wants him healed.
[28:26] Everything's for a purpose.
[28:29] The most important thing is to get them
[28:32] to God. That's the most important
[28:34] because if if they get healed today,
[28:37] they're going to get sick again.
[28:40] If they come off the deathbed, they're
[28:43] going to eventually die.
[28:46] But the purpose, the main purpose is to
[28:49] get them to Christ. But it's also to
[28:52] prevent the suffering that goes on and
[28:54] to help us. I'm not just talking about
[28:57] healing. I'm talking about prophecy. I'm
[29:00] talking about tongues. I'm talking about
[29:01] all the gifts in the church. They are to
[29:03] help the congregation. They are not to
[29:06] edify, not to lift up a single person.
[29:10] You might say, "Oh, brother Daniel has a
[29:12] gift of tongues." And then then it
[29:15] becomes about brother Daniel. No, it
[29:18] should always be about God. And when I'm
[29:20] get to these scriptures, you're going to
[29:22] see very plainly, it is not about the
[29:26] person that has the gift. There is a
[29:29] very specific purpose
[29:32] in a gift
[29:34] and it is not to lift up the church or
[29:38] lift up the individual.
[29:41] So really I believe that these gifts are
[29:47] sent for the good
[29:50] of the people. Get them to salvation and
[29:53] get them healed. And many times
[29:57] gifts are confused with emotion.
[30:03] You can say that the church has the has
[30:05] gifts because people are speaking in
[30:07] tongues or because people are running
[30:09] around the the the congregation or
[30:11] they're dancing in the spirit and all
[30:13] that. Those are not gifts.
[30:16] Do not get those mixed up with gifts.
[30:19] Those are blessings. But that is not a
[30:22] gifted church. A gifted church has real
[30:27] gifts that operate for other people. If
[30:30] someone is is up here, say me, say I'm
[30:34] up here preaching and I speak in tongues
[30:37] without an interpretation. It's not a
[30:39] gift to you. It's just I just said
[30:40] something strange.
[30:43] That would be a that would be me
[30:44] worshiping. Or you have people and say
[30:47] the whole church starts speaking in
[30:49] tongues. That's not a gift because it's
[30:52] for the individual. It's not for someone
[30:53] else. A gift is always for someone else.
[30:56] And as I said that a church that has a
[30:58] lot of emotion, that's good. I'm not
[31:00] against that at all. I love it. I have
[31:03] myself. I've spoken in tongues, but it
[31:06] was for me. It wasn't a gift operating.
[31:10] It was praise.
[31:12] I have shouted in the spirit, but it's
[31:14] not a gift.
[31:16] A gift is, and they're very plainly
[31:20] defined, as I'm going to read, they are
[31:23] for the edification of the church. They
[31:26] are for other people. Are you with me? I
[31:28] know it may sound strange, but as I
[31:30] said, a church that speaks in tongues, a
[31:33] church that runs around, that dances in
[31:35] the spirit, is not a gifted church. It's
[31:38] an emotional church, which is good. I'm
[31:40] good. I'd rather have it that way than a
[31:42] dead church,
[31:44] but that is not a gift. We're together.
[31:48] Everybody's like, "Whoa,
[31:51] I'm going to read the Bible."
[31:54] 1 Corinthians chapter 12.
[31:57] When those those things happen, friends,
[32:01] ask yourself this. Is it introducing
[32:03] somebody to Christ? This speaking in
[32:06] tongues or or dancing in the spirit or
[32:08] whatever it might be. Is it introducing
[32:10] someone to Christ or is it healing
[32:13] someone else or providing for someone
[32:15] else? If it is not, then it's not a
[32:16] gift. 1 Corinthians chapter 12 verse
[32:20] one. Now, concerning spiritual gifts,
[32:22] brethren, I would not have you ignorant.
[32:26] You know that you were Gentiles carried
[32:28] away under these dumb idols, even as you
[32:30] were led. Wherefore I give you to
[32:33] understand that no man speaking by the
[32:35] spirit of God callth Jesus a cursed, and
[32:37] no man can say that Jesus is Lord, but
[32:40] by the Holy Ghost. Why is he saying that
[32:42] in introducing the gifts? He's saying
[32:45] the focus is on one thing.
[32:49] focuses on Christ. Now there are
[32:52] diversities
[32:53] of gifts but the same spirit.
[32:57] New Living Translation says there are
[33:00] diversity. There are different kinds of
[33:02] spiritual gifts but the same spirit is
[33:05] the source of them all.
[33:08] That is the Holy Spirit. It's the source
[33:11] of all of the gifts.
[33:14] And there are differences of
[33:15] administrations,
[33:17] but the same Lord. And there are
[33:19] diversities of operations,
[33:23] but it is the same God, which worth
[33:24] workketh all in all. But the
[33:27] manifestation of the spirit is given to
[33:29] every man to profit with all. Let me
[33:32] read the New Living Translation of that.
[33:34] Verse number seven, verse number seven
[33:35] says this. A spiritual gift is given to
[33:38] each of us so we can help each other.
[33:43] So here we see the spiritual we see the
[33:45] purpose of these spiritual gifts.
[33:48] They're not to glorify self. They're not
[33:50] to glorify a church. They are to help
[33:53] each other. As I said, but the
[33:56] manifestation of the spirit is given to
[33:59] every man to profit with all. Old King
[34:02] James. As I said, it's hard to
[34:03] understand. And the the prop the modern
[34:07] word is to each of us so we can help
[34:10] each other.
[34:13] So I can pray for the sick
[34:16] as you can pray for the sick. We can
[34:20] give a prophecy maybe in tongues and
[34:23] it's meant to help. One thing that I did
[34:25] and I talked about this a little bit on
[34:27] on Sunday is the anointing of oil.
[34:31] And I appreciate anointing with oil
[34:35] because in the book of James it says
[34:38] that if you do this then the prayer of
[34:41] faith shall save the sick. So I look and
[34:44] it's like Lord maybe I don't have the
[34:46] faith as a pastor. Maybe I don't have
[34:49] the faith to pray for somebody as they
[34:51] come up. But if I anoint them with this
[34:52] oil Lord I don't it doesn't it's not
[34:55] built on my faith. I have enough faith
[34:59] to put my finger in this oil and anoint
[35:02] that person. That's all the faith I
[35:03] need. And all the faith that the that
[35:05] the person that needs healing that all
[35:08] the faith that they need is to come up
[35:10] and say, "I want to be anointed." And
[35:11] then boom, we have it now. It's a
[35:13] promise of God.
[35:15] And that's why anointing with oil is
[35:19] it's not always. Sometimes we just lay
[35:21] hands on the stick. Sometimes we just
[35:23] speak the word. But when you anoint with
[35:26] oil, you have that promise there.
[35:29] And it doesn't have to have maybe a gift
[35:31] of healing. You just do it. As a
[35:34] Christian, as a believer, you just do
[35:36] it. And you can count on it happening.
[35:39] Verse number eight, for to one is given
[35:42] by the spirit the by the spirit the word
[35:45] of wisdom. We have another gift
[35:47] operating. To another the word of
[35:49] knowledge by the same spirit. to another
[35:53] faith by the same spirit. To another,
[35:56] gifts of healing by the same spirit. Do
[35:58] you see these different gifts that God
[36:00] places in the church? And we need all of
[36:02] them. We really do. To another working
[36:05] of miracles, and to another prophecy, to
[36:08] another discerning of spirits, to
[36:09] another diverse kinds of tongues, to
[36:11] another interpretation of tongues.
[36:15] But all these work workketh that one and
[36:18] self-same spirit dividing to every man
[36:22] severally as he will. New living
[36:24] translation says it is the one and only
[36:27] spirit who distributes all these gifts.
[36:30] He alone decides which gift each person
[36:33] should have. English standard version
[36:35] says all these are empowered by one and
[36:38] the same spirit who aortions to each one
[36:41] individually as he wills. It's God that
[36:43] gives those gifts. And you cannot make
[36:47] yourself something you are not. I would
[36:50] give anything if I could lay my hands on
[36:54] that young man and he would get up in
[36:57] the power of the Holy Ghost. I wish I
[37:00] could
[37:02] and maybe he will from me anointing with
[37:05] oil. But do you see how much of a gift
[37:09] that gift of healing would be in our
[37:10] church?
[37:12] It would be beautiful and it would be
[37:15] needed by us.
[37:18] He's given us gifts, but I we need to
[37:20] continue to pray that Lord, what is my
[37:23] gift? What do you want me?
[37:25] For as the body is one and hath many
[37:28] members, and all the members of that one
[37:30] body being one are are one body, so also
[37:33] is Christ. For by one spirit are we all
[37:36] baptized into one body, whether we be
[37:38] Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or
[37:41] free, and have been all made to drink
[37:44] into one spirit.
[37:47] This was a bit of a profound statement
[37:49] back then.
[37:52] Remember, most Christians at this time
[37:54] were Jews,
[37:56] and the Jews thought they were better
[37:58] than the Gentiles. Why wouldn't they
[38:00] think that? The Bible was all about
[38:03] them.
[38:04] The whole the whole Bible was pretty
[38:06] much about this lineage of the Jewish
[38:09] people. And when they were back then
[38:11] back then they thought the Gentiles were
[38:13] dirty. But Paul is breaking tradition by
[38:16] saying now everyone is equal. Your
[38:18] heritage does not matter. You may have
[38:21] come from the lineage of Levi or Judah
[38:23] or Abraham or a prophet but now Christ
[38:27] has come and poured out his spirit upon
[38:30] all flesh.
[38:32] And now it matters if you are in Christ.
[38:39] That is what it is.
[38:42] So he's saying I don't care if you're
[38:44] following John the Baptist or Moses or
[38:46] if you were a complete heathen. If you
[38:48] have accepted Christ as your savior,
[38:51] then you are we are all equal in this.
[38:55] And then God can pour out his gifts upon
[38:58] the people. For the body is not one
[39:00] member but many.
[39:03] And really more important
[39:07] than the individual gift
[39:10] is the collective gift
[39:13] of the whole body of Christ. Paul goes
[39:16] on to say that you can't have a foot
[39:19] without a hand or you can't have an eye
[39:21] without a nose. You have to have this
[39:24] whole body together
[39:27] to be complete. Let's skip to verse 28
[39:31] for time's sake. And God hath set some
[39:34] in the church. Now he's going to tell us
[39:35] more gifts.
[39:37] Some in the church first apostles,
[39:39] secondary prophets, thirdly teachers,
[39:42] after that miracles and gifts of
[39:43] healing, helps, governments, diversity
[39:46] of tongues. Are all apostles?
[39:50] Are all prophets?
[39:52] Are all teachers? Are all workers of
[39:54] miracles? Have all the gifts of healing?
[39:57] Do all speak with tongues? Do all
[39:58] interpret? But covet earnestly the best
[40:01] gifts? And yet I show unto you a more
[40:03] excellent way. That's the end of verse
[40:06] or chapter 12 of Corinthians. We know
[40:08] what chapter 13 is. What is that more
[40:10] excellent way?
[40:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:14] Because that is what operates these
[40:16] gifts. When you do it in love, you do it
[40:19] in love for the Lord and you do it in
[40:20] love for each other.
[40:24] Let's go to let's talk about briefly.
[40:28] Let's talk about tongues
[40:30] and uh 1 Corinthians 4 uh 14. 1
[40:34] Corinthians 14. And friends, when I'm
[40:36] talking I'm talking about tongues here,
[40:38] but this is really all of the gifts
[40:41] there, they all operate like like Paul
[40:43] is saying here on in tongues. The main
[40:46] thing
[40:48] with what I'm trying to get across
[40:50] tonight is it's not about the person
[40:53] that has the gift
[40:55] and it is not about the pride that we
[40:58] have in our church or anything like
[41:00] that. It is about number one is it it
[41:03] it's about pleasing God and getting
[41:05] people to come to the Lord and number
[41:08] two it is about the compassion that we
[41:10] have for each other and the love we have
[41:12] for each other. Please remember in all
[41:15] things, please remember those two
[41:16] things. That's how gifts operate. That's
[41:19] that's that's everything. Follow after
[41:22] charity. It starts right there. Charity,
[41:24] King James, is love in today's words.
[41:28] Follow after charity and desire
[41:30] spiritual gifts, but rather that you may
[41:34] prophesy. For he that speaketh in an
[41:36] unknown tongue speaketh unto men, but un
[41:38] but unto God, for speaketh not unto men,
[41:41] but unto God. For no man understandeth
[41:43] him, how be it in the spirit he speaketh
[41:46] mysteries, but he that prophesieth
[41:48] speaketh unto men to edification and
[41:51] exhortation and comfort. He that
[41:54] speaketh in an unknown tongue edifith
[41:56] himself. Remember what I was saying
[41:58] about the church
[42:00] that speaks in tongues, that shouts,
[42:02] that praises. As I said, it's good. I'd
[42:05] rather have that than than being too
[42:07] quiet.
[42:09] But they edi it's edifying the the
[42:12] worshipper. I was we were at a youth
[42:15] meeting
[42:17] and I was um I was one of the like the
[42:21] ministers there. I wasn't ministering
[42:23] but I was one of the ministers there
[42:24] that would pray with the kids. And I
[42:26] hope you may you may have been been
[42:28] there in Jeffersonville. I was standing
[42:30] in the back. It was a torrential
[42:33] rainstorm
[42:34] that was going on and the the tent was
[42:36] there. We were inside a tent, big giant
[42:39] tent about the size of half the size of
[42:41] this room, and a couple hundred kids
[42:45] there, and something told me, I was
[42:49] standing with a number of the other ones
[42:51] there, the ushers, and something told me
[42:55] to go stand by myself.
[42:59] And I thought, well, maybe one of the
[43:02] young people needs me or something. So I
[43:04] walked over to I was in the in the back
[43:06] and everybody was there and the pulpit
[43:08] was up there. I walked around to the
[43:10] side where the rain was coming down
[43:14] and
[43:15] the
[43:17] worship leader was singing beautiful
[43:19] just nice really really nice pouring
[43:22] down rain and it just it just felt good
[43:25] and I had my hands up. I didn't feel any
[43:27] type of uh emotion. I was just happy and
[43:31] I was just singing. And I heard
[43:34] the strangest sound, this rattling like
[43:38] d and I was like, "What is that?" I was
[43:42] looking around. I looked behind me
[43:45] and as I said, I didn't feel emotion.
[43:49] And I put my hand to my mouth and it was
[43:51] me
[43:52] that was speaking in tongues.
[43:56] But it was to myself
[43:59] and it was just worship is what it was.
[44:01] It was neat. It was an awesome
[44:02] experience. I think that maybe the Lord
[44:04] gave me gave me this experience so I
[44:06] could help others. It's not my gift. And
[44:08] I see many people praying in tonesues
[44:11] and that is wonderful.
[44:13] Praying in tonesues is worship and it's
[44:16] beautiful. But when you have a
[44:19] microphone,
[44:21] there better be an interpreter.
[44:25] But when you're praying in tongues,
[44:26] that's wonderful. As I said, I've done
[44:29] it and it's a blessing. But it was for
[44:32] me. But when I am up here speaking and
[44:35] if I speak in tongues and don't have an
[44:38] interpreter, it is against the word.
[44:41] I'll show you why.
[44:44] Let me uh let me read uh the New Living
[44:46] Translation of uh and I will go five
[44:48] more minutes and then we'll um we'll
[44:50] move on to the next portion. Let love be
[44:53] your highest goal. But you should also
[44:56] desire the special abilities the spirit
[44:58] gives, especially the ability to
[45:01] prophesy. For if you have the ability to
[45:03] speak in tongues, you will be talking
[45:06] only to God since people won't be able
[45:08] to understand you.
[45:10] It's for you. All right? You will be
[45:13] speaking by the power of the spirit, but
[45:16] it will all be mysterious.
[45:19] But one who prophesies strengthens
[45:22] others, encourages them, and comforts
[45:26] them. A person who speaks in tongues is
[45:30] strengthened personally, but one who
[45:32] speaks a word of prophecy strengthens
[45:35] the entire church.
[45:39] Verse verse number five, back to the
[45:41] King James. I would that you all spoke
[45:43] with tongues. speak with spake with
[45:45] tongues, but rather I would I would that
[45:48] ye all spake with tongues, but rather
[45:50] that ye prophesied. For greater is he
[45:52] that prophesieth than he that speaketh
[45:54] with tongues, except he interpret that
[45:56] the church may receive edifying. So a
[45:58] message given by tongues and interpreted
[46:01] is a prophecy.
[46:04] And remember, it's for the church. It
[46:08] may be, brother John, I may if if the
[46:10] spirit of the Lord comes down and I give
[46:13] a prophecy maybe specifically for you.
[46:17] It's for you and it's to help you. It's
[46:20] not to help the person giving it. And
[46:24] when we make it about this person,
[46:26] that's why many that's why we don't see
[46:28] the gifts that we should.
[46:32] And Paul continues on
[46:36] and he says, 'But brethren, if I came to
[46:38] you speaking in tongues, what shall I
[46:39] profit you except I shall speak to you
[46:43] either by revelation or by knowledge or
[46:44] by pro prophesying or by doctrine.
[46:47] Basically, the tongues must have meaning
[46:49] behind them or they don't do any good.
[46:52] That's the difference between
[46:54] worshiping in tongues like I have done
[46:57] and the gift of tongues which is for
[47:01] other people. All right, we together
[47:06] let's let's uh for time sake let's go
[47:08] down to verse 13. Wherefore let him that
[47:11] speak in an unknown tongues pray that he
[47:13] may interpret.
[47:15] For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my
[47:17] spirit prayeth, but my understanding is
[47:20] unfruitful.
[47:22] I identify with that so much.
[47:26] When I pray in the with the spirit,
[47:31] it's I'm I'm I'm praying my my spirit is
[47:35] praying to God
[47:37] when you are really
[47:41] when you're really coming out in
[47:43] tongues. And it's just it's something
[47:45] very special. But
[47:48] it's for me
[47:52] and I and when I will pray with the
[47:54] spirit and I will pray with the
[47:56] understanding also. I will sing in the
[47:58] spirit and I will sing with the
[48:00] understanding also. And as I said the
[48:02] difference here is that you can you can
[48:05] pray in tonesues and that's fine to pray
[48:07] in tonesues in the church but when the
[48:09] guy that has the microphone does it it's
[48:11] different. There was
[48:14] I I'll finish with this. There's a
[48:17] a sister that comes to church here and
[48:19] she was telling me, young sister, and
[48:21] she was telling me that the church that
[48:22] she was going to before, she said she
[48:25] came in and the worship team would be
[48:28] singing and then break out into tongues
[48:33] and then they would go back to singing
[48:35] and then back into tongues. And she told
[48:36] me, she said, she said, "Pastor," she
[48:38] said, "It just confused me. like I I
[48:42] don't understand why are they doing that
[48:45] and it's according to 1 Corinthians 14
[48:48] it's off the word them doing that they
[48:51] shouldn't do it because it doesn't mean
[48:54] anything to the audience and what it is
[48:55] is it's lifting us up and saying oh I'm
[48:57] more spiritual because we're speaking in
[48:59] tongues but really the answer is the
[49:01] opposite is you're less spiritual
[49:02] because you you're not following the
[49:04] word
[49:08] verse number 23
[49:10] If therefore, and this is along with
[49:13] what the sister told me, if therefore
[49:16] the whole church come together into one
[49:18] place and speak with tongues, and there
[49:20] come in those that are unlearned or
[49:22] unbelievers, will they not say that you
[49:24] are mad?
[49:27] What? This is weird.
[49:30] I don't understand any of this.
[49:33] Paul's addressing it right here.
[49:37] So, we will I got I got a lot more.
[49:39] Maybe we'll we'll just continue this on
[49:41] um another time. But the
[49:46] the the gifts,
[49:49] friends, it's either to introduce
[49:52] someone to the Lord or it is out of
[49:55] compassion.
[49:57] And usually it's both. Almost always. I
[50:00] would say it's probably always both.
[50:03] But when it becomes about the person
[50:07] that has the gift and these gifts, you
[50:09] can have a gift
[50:11] and not use it for the Lord. And guess
[50:14] what? God doesn't take that gift away.
[50:18] You still have it. You can have a
[50:21] complete and utter false prophet with
[50:24] the gift of prophecy.
[50:27] But because he makes it about himself or
[50:29] herself
[50:32] and then they they then it becomes when
[50:35] it comes them they get they get outside
[50:37] of the Holy Spirit and they continue to
[50:39] prophecy. They might be right over here
[50:41] but wrong over here. And then that
[50:43] person becomes a false prophet with the
[50:45] gift of prophecy.
[50:47] And you say, "Well, why doesn't God just
[50:48] take it away from them?" Because the
[50:50] Bible says, and I won't get there, but
[50:52] it's in my scriptures, that the gifts
[50:55] and calling of God are without
[50:59] repentance. Brother Josiah always
[51:01] corrects me. I always say callings. And
[51:03] he says, "No, brother Daniel, it's
[51:04] calling.
[51:06] The gifts and calling of God are without
[51:09] repentance." King James,
[51:11] the gifts and callings of God, calling
[51:14] of God, sorry,
[51:16] he doesn't take away.
[51:19] He gives it to you. And no matter, you
[51:22] can be the vilest sinner,
[51:24] but you can still have that gift.
[51:28] We um Stephanie got on me today. I was
[51:31] talking about famous people and she told
[51:34] me, "You can't talk about somebody
[51:35] that's still alive."
[51:38] Elvis Presley
[51:40] had a wonderful gift of music. I mean,
[51:45] have you ever heard him sing Only
[51:47] Believe?
[51:49] beautiful gift.
[51:52] God gave him that gift. But you notice
[51:54] to the day he died, God never took it
[51:56] away. Even as vile as he taught young
[52:00] people to be, God never took that gift
[52:03] away from him.
[52:05] That gift that he had was not pulled
[52:08] away even though God gave it. And the
[52:11] same with the gifts in the church.
[52:14] You may have a gift. You can use it for
[52:16] yourself or you can use it for God.
[52:19] It depends on depends on you.
[52:23] We'll continue this. I got about halfway
[52:25] through. So now, what questions do you
[52:27] have for our discussion?
[52:30] I know I'm not going to continue on. We
[52:32] have to have the questions.
[52:34] Brother Jordan.
[52:41] It's
[52:55] &gt;&gt; a very
[53:03] &gt;&gt; I skipped that part in 1 Corinthians 14.
[53:06] That was in the same chapter. But so,
[53:08] brother Jordan asks at the end of uh the
[53:11] book of Revelation, it says that the
[53:14] curses will be upon someone who either
[53:17] adds to this book or takes from this
[53:20] book. Now, let me preface that with
[53:23] there are two schools of thought right
[53:24] there. If you ask the Mormon people,
[53:26] they will say that you're they're just
[53:28] talking about the book of Revelation.
[53:30] Now, if you talk to most Christian
[53:32] people, they were saying, "No, that
[53:34] covers the whole Bible. So let's just
[53:37] stand that we are not to add to or take
[53:40] away anything from the Bible. Now how
[53:44] does the different how do the different
[53:47] translations line up with that? Now I
[53:50] assume you're talking about maybe the
[53:52] paraphrased versions.
[53:54] If you read the Greek and translate it
[54:00] directly, which is what I was looking
[54:01] for when I was re researching this, it
[54:04] doesn't make sense.
[54:06] You cannot take the original language
[54:09] and translate it directly because it's
[54:12] not readable. They're two different
[54:14] languages.
[54:16] You have to be able to
[54:19] translate or interpret what they were
[54:22] saying at the beginning. So, but what
[54:25] you have to be careful with. So, let me
[54:29] address that. So, so my answer is these
[54:32] translations they have done their best
[54:35] to say exactly what the original context
[54:38] is not adding or not subtracting what
[54:42] the purpose what the meaning behind the
[54:45] scripture is. You can translate and many
[54:47] of you speak Spanish or or Swahili or
[54:50] French or whatever it might be. You know
[54:52] that you can translate something from
[54:54] Swahili to English many different ways
[54:56] and it could be perfectly accurate. Am I
[54:58] right, brother David?
[55:00] There's different ways to translate and
[55:02] get the exact same meaning, but there
[55:06] are many translations that I have seen
[55:11] that have a purpose
[55:14] in their translation which you mentioned
[55:18] um 1 Corinthians chapter 14 and the
[55:21] women preaching in the church. There are
[55:24] translations that twist that because
[55:28] that is their agenda and that is their
[55:31] purpose. If I I could have done some
[55:33] research and found found one. But when
[55:37] you do that, I believe, brother Jordan,
[55:39] you are guilty. You are guilty of
[55:42] placing your own agenda into the word
[55:46] and removing or adding to the context.
[55:50] But I believe that the translations that
[55:53] we use,
[55:56] they were done very very well. And I
[55:59] don't believe that the King James is a
[56:02] standard anymore
[56:04] because language has changed. It's not
[56:07] the King James. It was beautiful, but
[56:09] our language has changed. I just I read
[56:12] examples of it.
[56:14] But I do like the King James and I I
[56:18] want to continue using that. Did that
[56:20] answer the question?
[56:23] So the answer is you can translate
[56:28] perfectly right
[56:30] the original text in different ways and
[56:34] still have the exact correct
[56:36] translation.
[56:39] Another question,
[56:41] Sister Sharon. Yes.
[56:55] So, Sister Sharon says that John 3:17
[57:00] says that Jesus did not come to condemn
[57:03] the world, but to save the world.
[57:06] So, who are we to put down someone else?
[57:09] I don't think you can and still believe
[57:11] the Bible.
[57:13] So, if you really believe the word, then
[57:16] no, you can't put someone else down. I
[57:19] believe it's uh it's coming up in the uh
[57:22] in the um sermon on the mount. Jesus
[57:25] said to call no man raqa, which I
[57:28] believe means worthless
[57:31] or say thou fool.
[57:34] He commanded don't do it or you will be
[57:36] guilty of hell.
[57:39] So, we can't we can provide correction
[57:43] and we shouldn't be sissies in the pull
[57:46] pit
[57:47] and allow things that the Bible is is
[57:52] strictly against. But that is just
[57:54] providing correction. That is preaching
[57:56] the word. But putting someone down,
[57:57] Sister Sharon, I agree with you. You
[57:59] can't.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; He did. Bible says that
[58:07] &gt;&gt; he did. Christ died for all is what
[58:10] sister Sharon said. However, not all
[58:12] accept him.
[58:15] There's two things that have to happen.
[58:16] He died for our sins, but we have to
[58:19] accept him. A pardon, beautiful. Brother
[58:23] Brandham said, "A pardon," and he was
[58:26] referring to a court case that I
[58:27] actually found.
[58:29] A pardon is not a pardon
[58:32] unless it is received as a pardon. and
[58:35] he was referring to uh something that
[58:37] happened, I believe, I can't remember
[58:40] exactly what it was, but it was Abraham
[58:42] Lincoln that wrote a handwritten pardon
[58:44] to a deserter who said that he never he
[58:48] he he was a coward and he he deserted
[58:52] his his post, which was punishable by
[58:55] death.
[58:57] Somebody got to Abraham Lincoln, I think
[58:58] it was a family member, and said, "Hey,
[59:00] this is this is my son and he's a good
[59:02] boy and he made a mistake." Abraham
[59:04] Lincoln said, "Okay." He takes a piece
[59:05] of paper, writes, "Pardon this young
[59:08] man, Abraham Lincoln, gives it to him,
[59:10] and the boy did not believe that Abraham
[59:14] Lincoln actually signed a pardon for
[59:15] him." And they put him to death
[59:20] because he did not accept that pardon.
[59:22] And it went to the went to court and the
[59:25] court found no, they were justified in
[59:28] killing him because he did not accept
[59:30] the pardon. There's two things that have
[59:32] to happen. Jesus died for our sins, but
[59:34] we have to accept that part. Another
[59:37] question,
[59:39] brother Josiah,
[59:40] &gt;&gt; about the Bible.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; The Amplified Bible is in my research is
[59:47] more so I read the Amplified Bible
[59:50] sometimes. Now, we don't put it up on
[59:52] the screen because we keep the King
[59:53] James up there. But in the Amplified
[59:55] Bible, there are brackets.
[59:57] And those brackets are added amplified.
[1:00:01] They are not the word of God. They're
[1:00:04] what the authors of the Amplified Bible
[1:00:06] put in there to help us understand the
[1:00:09] context. Okay? But the Amplified Bible
[1:00:12] itself is actually more in my
[1:00:16] understanding is more literal than the
[1:00:18] New King James, Old King James or
[1:00:20] English Standard Version. It is probably
[1:00:22] the most the most widely distributed of
[1:00:25] the most widely distributed Bibles. It's
[1:00:27] probably the most literal the Amplified
[1:00:30] Bible is, but again in the brackets it's
[1:00:33] added.
[1:00:36] Someone else, Sister Sarah
[1:00:54] I don't know. I uh I mean I have my
[1:00:58] ideas. It's something that I would have
[1:01:00] to really study on. Wisdom I think is
[1:01:03] play.
[1:01:05] The gift of wisdom
[1:01:08] is is that someone who is wise in their
[1:01:12] understanding, wise in their
[1:01:14] understanding of the word and and is
[1:01:16] able to take that wisdom that God has
[1:01:19] given that person and then bring it to
[1:01:23] help someone else if they're going to
[1:01:25] make a decision or whatever whatever it
[1:01:27] might be. Now, discernment of the spirit
[1:01:30] and knowledge are very similar
[1:01:34] and it depends on who you're talking to.
[1:01:37] They may say the gift of knowledge and
[1:01:39] we think that that's discernment. That
[1:01:41] would be somebody coming through the
[1:01:42] prayer line like brother Brandham did
[1:01:44] and I would say your name is Joseph and
[1:01:46] and you're from here and and you used to
[1:01:48] live here. A lot of modern uh
[1:01:52] charismatic churches call that the the
[1:01:54] gift of knowledge. We call it
[1:01:56] discernment. So I would have to really
[1:01:58] dig into it to answer that. Maybe maybe
[1:02:00] that's on the next one.
[1:02:09] I think that that that that's that would
[1:02:12] be more in preaching and more in laying
[1:02:16] out the scriptures.
[1:02:18] Yeah, good questions. And it's all right
[1:02:21] there in that first Corinth. Yeah, one
[1:02:24] more question
[1:02:25] before the team comes. Brother David
[1:02:42] people
[1:02:56] don't know how
[1:03:02] Uh
[1:03:03] wow. Um
[1:03:06] that's uh it's not on the gift subject,
[1:03:10] but um when we can the worship team can
[1:03:12] come and I'll close with this one. Um so
[1:03:15] brother David for for those that are
[1:03:17] streaming in. Brother David was asking,
[1:03:19] he said that the book of Revelation, I
[1:03:22] believe, oh no, is it um I think Jesus
[1:03:24] said that all men when when Christ
[1:03:28] returns that everyone will behold him.
[1:03:30] Say it again. You said it perfect. You
[1:03:32] quoted it. Say it
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; in like manner will come down. Yeah.
[1:03:45] this this Jesus that that went up in
[1:03:47] like manner will come down. It was the
[1:03:48] angels that said it in like manner will
[1:03:50] come down and all eyes will see him and
[1:03:53] then
[1:03:55] he's saying that brother Brandham said
[1:03:56] that there'll be a secret sudden secret
[1:03:58] catching away which is in the scripture
[1:04:00] too that he will come like a thief in
[1:04:02] the night and and that straight is the
[1:04:06] gate narrow is the way and few there
[1:04:08] will be that find him. And we have
[1:04:10] scriptures like that that that will be
[1:04:12] and he says he says that it'll be in an
[1:04:15] hour and a time that you think not
[1:04:18] I don't know
[1:04:21] I I don't know the answer to that and
[1:04:24] it's something that I have thought about
[1:04:26] many many times
[1:04:28] how can that script how can these
[1:04:31] scriptures line up perfect and the only
[1:04:33] thing that I can say
[1:04:37] And
[1:04:39] I think I told the story about the young
[1:04:43] Jewish rabbi in training named Mayor
[1:04:47] when I was there looking at the the
[1:04:50] walls of Jerusalem and how how the the
[1:04:52] rubble was down at the bottom and we
[1:04:55] were talking about the Messiah and the
[1:04:57] young man
[1:04:59] and uh he was talking he was talking
[1:05:01] about the prophecies and he he said that
[1:05:03] there's different interpretations of the
[1:05:05] prophecies of the Messiah.
[1:05:08] And I told him
[1:05:10] that the true interpretation of prophecy
[1:05:15] is the fulfillment of that prophecy.
[1:05:19] So those are prophecies that are to come
[1:05:20] to pass.
[1:05:23] And when they are fulfilled, they will
[1:05:25] be perfect according to both sides. But
[1:05:28] I don't think that we know that answer.
[1:05:30] And I don't believe that anyone knows
[1:05:33] that answer until we actually see it.
[1:05:36] So, I'm sorry, brother David. I can't
[1:05:38] give any you an answer, but I do believe
[1:05:41] that when that prophecy is fulfilled,
[1:05:44] everything will line up just perfect.
[1:05:47] Amen. Brother Josiah,
[1:05:50] anybody else that had had one that was
[1:05:53] just burning on them?
[1:05:57] Okay, thank you.
[1:06:03] Get the words up to give us clean hands.
[1:06:06] Key of F.
[1:06:14] You appreciate our pastors.
[1:06:32] Jordan,
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; I could turn on I could uh I can preach
[1:06:39] and I can and I believe that I believe
[1:06:42] that I'm I'm saying what's right or I
[1:06:44] wouldn't say it, but oh man, when you
[1:06:49] just sit down
[1:06:51] and you just
[1:06:53] open your New Living Translation or your
[1:06:57] your your your King James Bible and you
[1:07:00] just open it up and you just start
[1:07:03] reading and it's like, "Oh God, how
[1:07:06] wonderful your word is, how deep your
[1:07:11] word is, how precious these things are."
[1:07:15] And then as I said last Sunday,
[1:07:18] when you read it and it may be it may be
[1:07:23] in the law,
[1:07:25] maybe in Deuteronomy, maybe maybe in
[1:07:27] Leviticus,
[1:07:28] but when you really you read it and you
[1:07:32] see that that this offering took this
[1:07:36] goat
[1:07:38] and send him out in the wilderness to be
[1:07:41] killed by the wild animals. and you look
[1:07:44] and you say, "Lord,
[1:07:47] what does that have to do with me?" And
[1:07:50] then you can feel the spirit just come
[1:07:53] in and say, "That was my son, Jesus
[1:07:55] Christ.
[1:07:57] That was the offering
[1:07:59] that was made, the scapegoat that took
[1:08:01] the sins
[1:08:04] of the people and carried them away
[1:08:07] never to return."
[1:08:10] And when you read the Bible, it's just
[1:08:12] so friends, it is so beautiful, so deep
[1:08:18] by the word of his power. When he had by
[1:08:21] himself purged our sins, sat down on the
[1:08:24] right hand of the majesty on high. Yeah,
[1:08:28] that is good. Praise God. God bless you,
[1:08:31] brothers and sisters. You're dismissed.
[1:08:38] Great is thy faithfulness,
[1:08:44] oh God, my father.
[1:08:49] There is no shadow
[1:08:53] of turning
[1:08:56] with thee.
[1:08:59] Thou changest
[1:09:02] not thy compassions.
[1:09:07] They fail not.
[1:09:10] As thou hast been, thou forever
[1:09:17] will be.
[1:09:20] Great is thy faithfulness.
