coming through okay god bless you amen if you have your Bible let's turn to Jeremiah chapter 17 first we'll go there and then we're gonna go to Psalms chapter 107 amen Jeremiah chapter 17 god bless you we greet you this morning and I want to say a resurrection that this is amen this morning amen and we know what the true meaning of Easter is and it's not just a religious holiday as people make it but it means so much more to the believer amen and and it's sad that we're having to meet here on Easter like this you know not together and you were split up at her homes at different locations and different places amen but you know stir to the Christian because the Sun the S Owen is risen in our hearts and the difference in our life he's the one who changed us amen it makes us what we are today put a hunger and a thirst for His Word amen and so I trust that you have that hunger and that thirst for his word today I trust that you have an expectation in your heart that the Lord is gonna meet your need amen I believe that he is the great Shepherd of the sheep as we spoke about yesterday the Lord is our Shepherd amen I'm certainly grateful for that today amen Psalms chapter 107 and also Jeremiah 17 we want to read I'm just gonna read a few scriptures from Jeremiah chapter 17 first and then we'll turn over to Psalms chapter 107 amen let me just pull that up on on my screen here to make sure that we have it and then by the Jordan if you could just give me a text just let me know that everything looks and sounds good and we're good to go amen Psalms chapter 107 if you hold that place but Jeremiah chapter 17 let's just begin reading here amen at verse 5 it says here thus saith the Lord cursed be the man that trusteth and man and maketh flesh his arm and whose heart departeth from the Lord for he shall be like the heath in the desert and shall not see one good cometh but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness in a salt land and not inhabited blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord and whose hope the Lord is for he shall be like a tree planted by the waters and that spreadeth out her roots by the river and shall not see when he Cometh but her leave shall be green and shall not be careful in the year of drought neither shall cease from yielding fruit amen what a wonderful scripture what a contrast amen turn to psalms chapter 107 for our context here today we're going to this read one scripture here psalms chapter 107 amen psalms chapter 107 let me just find my place here make sure I'm in the right spot I want to begin reading here at verse 23 and we're just going to read something here from the psalmist from David we're gonna read from verse 23 through verse 27 I'm speaking to you today and what the Lord has put upon my heart and it's probably not your typical Easter message what you would call a typical traditional Easter message but as we said we know what we know what as a true believer we know what Easter means amen and the only reason we could even preach today and have any revelation from the word or have a desire in her heart is because of Easter because he's risen he's not in the tomb he's alive forevermore he's the same yesterday today and forever amen but I want to speak to you today on a thought that I've titled reaching wit's end reaching wit sin or a place called wit sin let's look here at verse 23 they that go down to the sea and ships that do business and great waters these see the works of the Lord and His wonders in the deep for he commandeth and raiseth the stormy wind which lifted up the waves thereof they mount up to the heaven they go down again to the depths their soul is melted because of trouble they reel to and fro and stagger like a drunken man and are at their wit's end then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble and he bringeth them out of their distress he maketh the storm a calm so that the waves thereof are still then are they glad because they be quiet so he bringeth them unto their desired Haven amen let's just bow our heads together and just ask the Lord to bless this service today Lord Jesus father were gathered Lord in various places today families Lord no doubt under the sound of my voice streaming in and watching Lord all in different locations lord I just ask first Oh Lord Jesus we believe that when we're praying father were doing more than just uttering words Lord are expressing thoughts Lord but prayer is a weapon father whereby we enter another dimension Lord and so we're using what you've given us today Lord or pray in God and we're surrendering we're asking you Lord to come and speak what you've placed upon my heart I pray God that you'd make it real Lord to every individual Lord bless those that are gathering tetherin in the home Lord may be in the vehicle may be wherever they're at in remote locations we pray God that you would just come and may your presence around us Lord God we ask may you saturate father every room every house Lord as we look to you Lord as we look to your word we're thankful father that today we could say here on Easter Sunday that you are risen from the dead you are resurrected Lord father and we believe that you're moving today in your bride we believe that you desire to move upon our hearts now God may you just move upon us Lord each and every single one in Jesus Christ name Amen amen amen I just want to continue here and I wanted this pick this straight up we're going to just go and until we find a place to stop but David here is speaking of this man and he says they that go down I want you to Stu look here again in your Bibles he says they that go down to the sea and ships that do business in great waters so we know David very clearly here is speaking of sailors speaking of men who do business this is something that they know very well and he says they these see the works of the Lord and His wonders in the deep for he commandeth and raiseth the stormy wind which lifts a fell lifteth up the waves thereof David begins to describe this spot where the Sailor gets to to where he's he he's rowing and he's going to and fro and David said he's like on a ship and many times this is how we feel about life life is like being out in the open waters the expanse of all of our existence and sometimes we seem to float a that life see and and the waters can become calm and and we're just selling and cruising and then suddenly there comes a change and the atmosphere has changed and the weather has changed and the feeling is different than maybe what it was before and now the sailors David begins to describe them and say that they lose all control they lose control of their life they lose control of their boat they lose control of their direction and circumstances has raised up around them to where they can't control the boat they can't control the direction David says that they begin to reel and they begin to go to and fro and he says they stagger like a drunk man what a place that David begins to describe here and he says they literally reach what they call their wit's end and a wit Cyn is a place to where a person comes to to where they they've they've lost all control they've they've exhausted any possibility or perceiving that they could think that there would ever be a way out in short David is describing the place that we can get to to where it's the end of all human ability it's the end of all human resources it's the end of all human intervention and there's no escape there's no help there's no deliverance other than God coming on the scene himself Oh David begins to describe this and he says that this is a place that we get to to where our soul melts he says it's like a place called wit's end and these giant waves carry the ship up and down to the heavens and then drop it below and the Whitecaps are there and you can't see - over the next wave the ship cells are tattered and torn and they're ripped by powerful waves that are crashing to the deck the sailors just struggle just to hold on it looks like it's gonna be all over for them it looks like everything they're in or despair they're completely helpless they're vulnerable to the power of the elements of the sea unable to stop the waves unable to stop the torment unable to save themselves they're powerless to make a difference they've come to a place called wit's in and maybe you're in that spot today maybe somewhere it's your life this is what the Lord put upon my heart to preach to you tear today how you feel during this entire crisis that we feel helpless and and all believers let me just say this all Christians can get to this place no matter how strong spiritually you are no matter how long you've served the Lord you can get to a place to where you feel like you have no resources you can make no difference you've lost or exhausted any possibility of making a difference and just like the sailors aboard that ship you simply it is this you're just living life normally you're you're caring about life you're moving on with your walk with the Lord living day to day and then one day out of nowhere here comes a storm upon your life and waves of trouble begins to strike you and waves of of problems begin to come to you and you're attacked from all sides and life's troubles seldom come at one time usually they're like waves and a storm they come more intense and more intense and more intense and then you begin to feel as that sailor did your soul melts because of the trouble the Hebrew word for melting means to faint with fear means to become overcome with fear but let me give you some very something very important to understand about Psalms chapter 107 this wasn't a storm or waves that Satan had sent but the Bible says he maketh the stormy waves to come he maketh the ripples in the water he causeth the wind to come and to rock the boat this is a God initiated trial this the Bible says in verse 25 he commandeth and raiseth the stormy wind he's the one who brought the sailors to this place he's the one raising the wind he's the one stirring the waves he's the one tossing the ship all of this is his doing and my brother my sister sometimes God sends a trial in our life and we can't make any sense of why it came we can't make any sense of the trouble that surrounding us are surrounding us but this should be an encouragement to your faith today too that David said you can get to a place of wits in and God is the one who brought you to that spot to where the only thing you can do as a believer is lift up your eyes and look up and say Lord as David said I'll look up to the hills where does my help come from my help cometh from the Lord oh we have all the knowledge that all the troubles in life can bring are the storms and life can bring but sometimes we must understand that life's troubles can be initiated or ordained by God they're not always caused by the devil and I'll always come by calls by some tormentor or maybe some sin in our life but sometimes God raises the storm and raises the wind in our life to get us to the place that we call whit sin what a place and trials can come sometimes more steady sometimes our trials can become maybe maybe a crisis comes and and comes to our life or maybe it's just constant daily battles or constant daily maybe you've been in a trial to where you feel like you can't remember where it all started but it's just daily you're struggling and daily it's like a relentless pressure or a relentless pursuit that just begins to where you're resistance down my brother my sister we've all got them don't think for a minute that you're unique in that don't think for a moment or let the devil tell you that you're the only one who feels that constant pressure all of the believers are filling that mounting spiritual pressure in the a day and age that you and I live in today and all of us you know the simple answer here's what's simple to our minds you say brother Matt what do we do when we find ourself in this place all of us know that we've got to trust in God more all of us know that more than ever before we should be on our knees crying out to God in prayer and in supplication to the Lord all of us know that the answer is more prayer and more seeking of God and more seek in his face but my question here today that I'm asking myself is why we I find myself in the deepest darkest places of wits in why do I find that in those places in my life I seek the Lord less down on my knees why is the struggle why the struggle today is why do we struggle with seeking God in times where it becomes it seems so plain that that's what we have to do in this time of calamity you know what it is we believe too much in ourself we trust as day as Jeremiah spoke of and said the man who trusteth in man he's like a he that a wither in the dried Durrett desert and in the drought you know what it is it's pride and coming calamity my friends it's pride it's very simply pride whether we realized that or not calamity and you don't find yourself on your knees with your family most it's sad but most of the time a believer never finds themself on the family altar at the time of greatest crisis we find ourselves mumbling complaining looking for answers grumbling questioning and anxiety and in depression this is exactly where the sailors got to they had no answer for the storm they had no answer for the problems in their life oh well I want you to turn in and in the video may get laggy here but the audio should come through but we chose to do it this way by the Jordan if you could just place that first slide up here here's the simple answer that we all must realize Jesus says I am the vine you are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit and here's the simple key for with out me you can do nothing for without me a simple truth an old truth that a long long time truth that's been true forever since he said it and I've got it in bold there because it needs to be stamped into our hearts without me you can do nothing without me you may toil you may beg you may plead but jesus said abide in me says unless you abide in me you can do nothing o my brother it was this nothingness that the entire world began when the Bible says the earth was covered without form without void there was just a nothingness a darkness but then there came a voice the creators voice begin to speak into that void and into that darkness and said let there be light and there was light you need to go to God and say God speak to my deep dark nothingness speak to my void of calamity and say let there be light Lord notice what brother Branham says here he says Satan this isn't the message I know Satan could not take them he could not drown Noah in the flood until the purpose of God had been finished he could not burn up the Hebrew children until the purpose of God had been finished he could not kill Jobe with boils and troubles until the purpose of God had been finished this is the next slide here brother Jordan if you don't have it up neither could the lions eat Daniel until the purpose hat until God's purpose had been finished neither could death an old age take Abraham until the purpose of God had been finished and listen to this and neither can it take you or can it take me until the purpose of God for our life until the purpose or listen to this and neither can it take you or and or can it take me until the purpose of God of our life is finished my brother my sister put your faith in that quote this morning until God is finished no matter what comes your way until God has finished with you until he has finished and accomplished his eternal purpose in your life your troubles listen God is the one who sends that storm God is the one who sent that wave and let me say it to you like the Lord gave it to me until God has finished and accomplished the purpose of that storm that storm will continue to rage because that storm has a purpose until God is finished with the storm or the wave of that that God sent into your life until God's purpose of the flood is finished the waters will still but remember that got a purpose glory to God oh listen to what Branham says about trouble here in the next slides he's the slide he says and why does God let troubles come God harnesses trouble puts bits in its mouth you want to know what this coronavirus God says this is what God was with trouble God puts bits in its mouth he harnesses the power of trouble and makes it obey Him and those troubles us into closer fellowship with God those troubles you see what troubles those troubles God sent to your life intentionally with the purpose why did the Bible say think it not strange when fiery trials are to try you don't think it's strange when you have fiery trials notice this story here with David I want you to look here in 1st Samuel chapter chapter 30 verse 6 I want you to this to note we want to just turn a corner here turn to 1st Samuel chapter 30 there in your homes and I'll give you just a moment just to come to that place notice this here first samuel chapter 30 verse 6 we know this story very well but I want you to stew I want to come and pick up just a part for this just here for a moment notice notice what what first samuel chapter 30 verse 6 it says and david was greatly distressed for the people spoke of stoning him because the soul of the people was grieved every man for his sons and for his daughters but David encouraged himself in the Lord his God we know this story very well where David goes to Ziklag and we've preached on this before we're not preaching on that here today but David comes back and he's there in Ziklag and he comes back from war and all the men with him coming to expect a a normal scene gonna crest the hill and there's going to be his wife and there's going to be the children of all the soldiers and the families and they're gonna greet them all but very differently David comes and crests that final Hill and over the hill their smoke and ashes and ruin David couldn't understand this the men couldn't understand this they immediately perplexity and distress their their hearts are troubled you could imagine the distress that comes over David's life as he's expecting to see his family and now they crest that hill and there's : and there's ruin and there's ashes and there's chaos and the Bible says the men as they all hit the ground and they begin to weep and they begin to cry and they begin to cry out and they begin to to get to that place of whit's in the Bible says David hears the whispers of those men as they the Bible says David was greatly distressed for the people spoke of stoning him my brother my sister this wasn't just an assault on David you've got to realize that the battle that you're in is not a battle of flesh and blood it's a spiritual battle it's a spiritual warfare and this wasn't just an attack against David or David's wife or David's men this was an attack against the purpose the eternal purpose of God it was an all-out assault because Satan knew the seed or the purpose of God would come through David this was an all-out assault against the purposes of God in David's life once again the devil was after God's seed because it was through that seed line we know that prophesied that the Messiah would come through David and through David's descendants and now Satan and taken away every woman and every child through whom that seed might come you see what the devil was trying to do his purpose is in your life are much greater than you they're much larger than you he's trying to prevent you from coming to your position as a son or daughter of God because he knows when the bride recognizes who she is and what she stands for that she'll do the greater works that she recognizes she's an invincible army and brother branham says and she then Satan will be as defeated in her life as he was when Satan was in the wilderness and Jesus withstood as every effort the purposes of Satan are much larger the attacks Satan has in your life you've got to look bigger than the picture of your own trouble it's much bigger than you it's much bigger than me once again Satan was after brother branham said he followed that seed line you remember when brother vitamin in the entombment begins to dramatize and he sand Jesus is at the door and he says I thought I had you when I killed a boy I thought I had you when I killed Seth I thought I had you when I killed David thought I had you when I killed Moses ball but I've got you now brother Brennan said he was always after that seed line and so he was a soul team David but ultimately he was after the purposes of God that would be fulfilled through David's life I hope that's clear I believe that it is Oh his life David comes to a place and David's and and then the scripture goes on and the men begin to cry and the bigoted men men begin to cry out and and the Bible says that David encourages himself he couldn't find encouragement from anybody else because there's an atmosphere of weeping there's an atmosphere of distress and calamity but the Bible says David looked within himself and God said David I want you to not look to all those things around your strength to find your joy but I've put something inside of you David I want you to look at you I want you to look deep down into your soul and the scripture says David in the midst of all that calamity and the midst of all that atmosphere of fear and anxiety and worry David encouraged himself in the Lord and the Bible says that David says grab me an ephod he takes a bath are the priests and he says ask should we pursue after this troop who's David didn't even know at this point if his wife was still alive he didn't know at this point if the children are still alive didn't know if his daughters were still alive didn't know if the men's wives and families are still alive but David encouraged himself within the within his own self II just encouraged himself within in the Lord and the Bible says that David says grab an ephod and ask shall we pursue shall we pursue after them and the scripture says that the ephod comes back and and he says thou shalt pursue for thou shalt notice what the scripture says for thou shalt recover all a ll in other words everything you lost in this attack everything that you lost everything that Satan took away from you 100% of it David you're gonna get back everything that you lost I want you to notice this here I'll pick it up here in first third is of Samuel chapter 30 and I'm just going to turn to it here my Bible just to make sure that we have it I wanted this pick up this place here notice what happens what happens here in 1st Samuel chapter 30 notice this here First Samuel chapter 30 and let's read from verse 7 just a ludus after the verse we just now read and it says in David said to ABBA though the priests of limit like song I pray thee bring me and Eve taught in the abbath are brought forth the ephod to david and he says in David inquired of the Lord saying she'll appreciate for this troop chela overtake them when he answered him pursue for thou shalt surely overtake them and without fail thou shalt recover all do you understand what's happening here God is saying David everything you've lost you're gonna get back a hundred percent of everything the Bible says in verse 9 so he went he and 600 men that were with him and came to the brook basore where those that were that were left behind Stephen David pursued he and 400 men verse 10 for 200 abode behind which were so faint they could not go over the brook Mysore I want you to pick this up all the way down follow it all the way down to verse 17 and David smote them from the Twilight even unto the evening of the next day and there escaped not a man safe 400 young men which wrote upon the camels and fled the Bible says in verse 19 and there was nothing lacking to them notice there was nothing lacking to them and he puts emphasis neither small nor great nothing there was nothing lacking my brother my sister when God restores what the devil has taken from you from the assault and the attack on your life when God restores it to you he doesn't leave anything out not just people not just things not just items but God puts everything back in order that became out of order in the storm glory he says he says in verse 19 there was nothing lacking neither small nor great and neither sons nor daughters notice neither spoil nor anything that they had taken to film David recovered all now follow this further and David took all the flocks and herds which they drove before those other cattle and said this is David's spoil David came to the two hundred men which were so faint that they could not follow David notice what he says here that he did the Bible says in verse 23 and let me let me find it here in verse and verse 25 he says and it was so from that day forward that he made it a staff Israel unto this day and when David came to sick like he sent unto out of the snow dismiss he sent of the spoil unto the elders of Judah even to his friends saying behold a present for you out of the spoil of the enemies of the Lord to them which were at Bethel to them which were at south ramoth to them which were to tear and to them which were an heir notice what he's doing the Bible says that David sins ought is it god says David you notice David didn't just recover his wife David didn't just recover everything that he lost but God says further than what you lost David you're gonna take from the enemy what the enemy's possessions were you're gonna take all of his gold all of a silver all of us these are what's going to be called spoils of battle you know what spoils our spoils is increased spoils is plunder you follow what I'm saying here we did this to Iraq when we destroyed Iraq we didn't just go over there and destroy Iraq but we took their oil we took their gold we do this this has been throughout history any time we conquer a nation we don't just get victory we don't just overcome them but we become more than an overcomer when we DIF when when's David goes to take back his wife and his children God says David I'm not just going to restore your wife I'm not just going to restore your children I'm not just gonna give you everything that you lost but I'm going to give you what you lost and on top of that I'm gonna use this trial against the devil and I'm going to increase you so that when you come out of this trial you're gonna be greater than when you win in it you're gonna be richer than when you win in it my brother my sister the purpose of the trial is not to make you angry it's not to make you bitter God doesn't send you through a storm so that you come out with depression so that you come up with an anxiety if that's the but that's what you got out of it you failed the test but God says when you out of this storm David you're not just going to recover all I'm gonna give you more abundantly than you could think ask or hope or ever even imagined God says Satan intended this trial for harm but I'm gonna turn it around on the devil and make it for your good I'm not just gonna give you your children back I'm not just gonna give you your wife back I'm gonna make you stronger than before you lost I hope that comes through really clear into your minds God says I'm gonna use it and I'm gonna call it spoils of war I'm gonna use it to mock the devil because the very thing that he intended to destroy you I'm gonna use it to increase you I'm gonna make you stronger you understand the prayer do you now understand the reason for your battle that you're in right now the struggle that's in your life the storm that's in your life the the storm has a purpose the trial has a purpose the Bible says that those who put their trust in the Lord were promised victory over the power of the enemy and God says I want you to know you're gonna come through that trial victorious but I'm not just gonna make you an overcomer I'm gonna make you more than an overcomer I'm working out an even greater purpose in you for my kingdom you're gonna come out of that battle with more spoils than you can the Bible says it this way I'm gonna open the windows of heaven and pour a blessing upon you more than you can even contain you're not just going to be an overcomer of this age you're going to be more than an overcomer glory to God God says I'm gonna take you I'm gonna put you we've all prayed we've noticed notice to say let me let me just before I get to get ahead of myself notice what first turn to first Quranic Liz chapter 26 I think I have this on the slide but the door to the next slide should be this scripture here notice what it says in first chronicles chapter 26 this is a beautiful principle here in verse first chronicles chapter 26 verse 27 notice what it says here it says out of the Spoils won in battles did they dedicate to maintain the house of the Lord read it again out of the Spoils won in battles did they dedicate to maintain the house of the Lord as we just spoke spoils our plunder loot their goods taken in battle by the victors the Bible first mentioned this spoils in Genesis chapter 14 you might you may know the story very well let me just rehearse it to you today it's the Battle of the kings of Sodom and the scripture says that all the kings of Sodom attack Abraham the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah in Genesis chapter 14 they attack Abraham and these invaders come in and the Bible says that they capture the inhabitants and they plundered all of their possessions it's in Genesis chapter 14 verse 11 and it says they took all the good I'm in Gomorrah but when they attack Sodom and Gomorrah these invaders attack Sodom and Gomorrah the Bible says that they take lot Abraham's brother captive so so these in Ventus army comes to attack sodom and gomorrah and it did destroys it it doesn't just eight takes its loot it takes it spoil and the Bible says they took and they took lot Abraham's brother's son that's in Genesis chapter 14 so here's what happened Abraham learns of this he finds out the nephew his nephew lot has been taken prisoner and the Bible says he gathers an army of 318 men of servants and they pursue after these kings notice this and the scripture says in verse 15 that they overtook these invaders and they smote them notice here's a here's a 318 man army now this is an Abraham doesn't have soldiers he does I have trained warriors it doesn't have tanks it doesn't have guns these are farmers but the Bible says that Abraham says I'm gonna go and I'm gonna take back what the devil has taken from me he took a lot and I'm gonna go capture him back why because I'm a seat of I'm a seed of God in them and the and Jehovah said my seed shall possess the gates of his enemy after trial and the Bible says that Abraham goes and takes back lot his brother's son and he get gathers this third and 18min arm and they pursued him and the Bible says that they overtook them and the descriptor says it this way he smote them and he brought back all the goods and also brought again his brother lot and his and the women also and the people notice what Abraham brings back Abraham comes back not just with lot but he takes spoils when in battle he takes spoils from the invaders he takes their gold he takes their silver he takes their wagons he takes their perfumes he takes their furniture Abraham doesn't just get lot Abraham gets back all of the possessions of those that captured lot notice here comes victorious Abraham my brother my sister notice what the Bible says here remember what the scripture says the Bible says the Bible says out of the Spoils when in battle did they use to dedicate to maintain the house of the Lord what is it it's supply through battle this is me here's Abraham leading this long procession of joyful people and here he's coming back with and with lot with all of his Goods with everything that he lost but on top of that Abraham has wagons full loaded down with silver loaded down with gold loaded down with goods of all kinds and the scripture says where did Abraham get that he got that from the spoils won in battle notice what God is saying God is saying your trials don't come to you just so you can survive them but your God is saying I'm wanting to send those trials not so that you can survive them but so that I can increase you through them you say I'm under pressure I'm in this trial there's so much calamity in my life how many of us have prayed to be more like God I raise your hand how many of for how many of you have prayed and said lord give me increased my patience Lord increase my love I want to be more like Jesus I want to die more out to myself how many have prayed and said God give me more character increased my prayer life increase my joy increase my sincerity and treats my consecration God says okay you've asked for those things now here's how I'm gonna give it to you I'm gonna supply that need through battle because you're gonna go through a trial you're going to go through a test and when you come out on the other side I'm going to grant your request because brother branham said character is not a gift character is a victory and the only way you get a victory it's through a battle and through a struggle I want more godliness God says I'm gonna supply that godliness through battle give me more zeal give me more courage give me more faith God says okay I'm gonna supply your request your request through battle through spoils because I want you to be not just an overcomer but more than an overcomer notice what happens with Abraham guess what happens Abraham the Bible says along the way Abraham meets Melchizedek who was the king of Salem Jerusalem he was the King of peace and the scripture sells us that Abraham tithes pays ties to this king where do you think he pays that ties Hebrews chapter 7 verse 4 consider how great this man was unto whom even the even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth owl's notice this God's chosen chooses Abraham who just need to read and now he's going to give a portion of that victory of those spoils to the king to who the king of Salem to the to the to the Lord Abraham's going to pay tithe notice what God says here he's gonna take what the devil intended for harm and Abraham's gonna not just receive lot back but he's gonna receive plunder and he's gonna pay God play he's gonna play God ties through the increase of what God gave him what is he doing brother Matt you said brother Matt what's he doing he's turning the tables around on Satan and he always does that and you're in my life what an amazing principle God gives us God says I'm interested much more than making you a victor and making you an overcomer I want to give you spoils and Goods I want to give you spiritual riches and spiritual character from your warfare you're going to emerge from your trial with loads of wisdom loads of character loads of love loads of joy loads of spiritual resources Romans 8 chapters of Romans chapter 8 verse 37 Paul says we are more than conquerors through him that loved us that loves us God says I want you to emerge out of that trial not bitter not upset not struggling but I want you to emerge out of that deep dark storm with wagonloads of patience of love of zeal of joy this is how God says I'm going David set up this principle notice this the Bible says these the principle was theirs that David said what we need to maintain the temple of the Lord we need we need weight and it's gonna need new shingles you build anything you notice you build any house you you you you you you you might manicure your yard you might plant it you might plant flowers and different things but you know what happens if you don't maintenance that the weeds will over grow the house will become dilapidated the shingles will fall off the the the paint will begin to chip why because deterioration and decay but david says for the temple of the Lord we're gonna go to battle in order to maintain the temple of the Lord I hope you catch the principle here in order to maintain the temple of the Lord don't you know that you're the temple of the holy spirit in order to maintain it I'm gonna send you through trials I'm gonna send you through battles David says we're gonna go to battle we're gonna go to war and out of the spoils won and war we're gonna maintain the temple of the Lord the house of the Lord will be maintained the supply for needs will be met out of battle so he appoints David appoints Solomon he had just appointed Solomon his son to follow him onto the throne of Israel and now he gathers the nation's leaders together and he sets up a divine order for sustaining God's house what resources are they gonna use to keep the paint to keep the shingles to keep the temple maintained what resources the Bible says out of the spoils won in battle did they dedicate to maintain the house of the Lord oh my brother my sister I hope you're catching the spiritual principle here today David is going to set up a Treasury a special account to maintain the temple of the Lord didn't think about this it's just imagine this here for a moment after every single military campaign after every military battle David takes back spoils and he and any stockpiles those spoils from the enemy these are spoils these are golden and and and and these are these are treasures that he stockpiles from the enemy from battle gold silver brass money to up Dinny any and any and he makes a he stopped Powell's all of these Goods and he had one purpose in mind one purpose one reason to use those spoils as resources for building you of the Holy Spirit why did the Bible say think it not strange when fiery trials are to come because your trial is much more precious than that of gold it maintains your spiritual well-being David appoints temple offices to priests he appoints porters he points musicians he imports stonemasons craft the craftsmen skilled builders skilled workers for everything needed to him sets up a special Treasury exclusively for the temples maintenance and once it was established notice what the Bible says here he directs his captain's to bring forth all of the spoils of war to supply the Treasury when when the Bible speaks of maintaining the temple that that original hebrew word means to repair the house to strengthen and to consolidate that which was built notice that you say brother mat what does that mean it means those resources that david gathered were meant to maintain the original splendor of the temple so that it didn't lose its splendor so that it did it lose its glory they were designated for the repair of any decay of any rot to keep God's house in pristine condition what was God going to use to maintain the temple gold from the enemy that's why you're in Satan's eating my brother my sister I hope it don't on you here today that's why you're in Satan's even this isn't God's Eden this is the height and the Panda the maturity this isn't the kingdom of God that's what Jesus said if this were my kingdom my soldiers would fight for me he says but this is not my world that the Prince of the power of the air controls this Eden this isn't my home I'm just passing through but this is why you're put in Satan's Eden this is you don't have home-field advantage here you're on the enemy's territory you're on the enemy's turf he controls everything around it this is why you're in Satan's eat'em you're not in the kingdom of God not only that you're in a temple this body that you're in is not saved the body's not redeemed this body falls apart this body can get sick this body subject to decay this body this temple is subject to rot it's subject to decay let me go further it's subject to mistakes it's subject to failures it's subject to faults it's subject to doubt it's subject to fear and all of these things the devil did the devil knows that he can use these temple he can use this Eden he can use all of these things to harm you to destroy the seat of God in your life but God says I'm gonna know that I know that there in Satan's Eden I'm gonna put my purpose notice the seed of God I want you to catch this here today because it's so important this inside the seed of God is the purpose of God he puts all of his plan all of his purpose all of his all of his inspiration and he bottles it all up in the seed and he says all the seed has that all the potential and God says I'm gonna put you are the seed of God do you realize the entire plan and program of God rests upon the bride of Jesus Christ the scripture says it this way that they without us Hebrews 11 all those Hebrews all those heroes of the faith the Bible says they died never receiving that Kingdom they salt looking for it but they never reached it God having left something better for us that they without us cannot receive their perfection it is the perfection of the bride that calls the Dead Saints from the ground do you know that God has banked everything he's put all of his purpose in the seed of God you say oh boy I can't believe God would do that I can't believe God would put all of his purpose and he'd bottle it all up in the seed of God and then God says that I'm gonna place that seed in a fallen world I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna is how much I this is how much this is this is what God says here I'm gonna take that seat and I'm gonna place it in a fallen world in a fallen atmosphere where all the demons ten thousands times thousands of demons have been loosed into the world I'm gonna put Satan as the Prince of the power of the air I'm gonna put all my purpose in EVE ii Eve I'm gonna put all of my I'm gonna put everything all my purpose all my plan all my inspiration I'm gonna place in the wickedest age Marcus Paige I'm gonna leave it up to that seed coming to its potential and I'm gonna Bank everything that it'll come to perfection and be an overcomer in fact I'm gonna hold the dead Saints graves based upon the perfection they without us cannot be made perfect you say brother Mack God had a lot of confidence in me God must have had to have a lot of confidence my brother you got it all wrong God God didn't do that because he had confidence in you God doesn't do that because he has confidence in me he hasn't put us here in Satan's eat him because he has confidence in you he has confidence that what he placed inside of you is more than an overcomer is more than a conquerer all the confidence is placed in the seed of God that he placed inside of you hallelujah and God says I'm gonna I'm gonna put so much confidence in that seed I'm gonna put them in the most wicked age I'm gonna put them in the most wicked time in the most wicked hour and further I'm gonna further than that and Satan says really that's what you're gonna do god that's exactly what is well you you you're confident in that God says I'm even more than confident than that not all I'm gonna am I going to place that seat in Satan Xena I'm going to place that seat in a people who has a temple whose subject to decay subject to fear subject to rot subject to worry subject to doubt subject to calamity subject to mistakes God placed all of the potential inside of you inside of me because he has confidence in that seed God says I'll put the very seed of Christ in a fallen temple and I'll use and you say brother Matt how is he gonna bring that fallen temple to destruction - two - I'm sorry how's it gonna bring that for that fallen temple - two to maturity - overcoming to victory God says here's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna use the very attack and schemes of Satan to come against that bride to perfect her I'm gonna use what the devil intended to destroy her and it would be the very thing that perfects her I'm going to use the very things that Satan meant to destroy this temple and I'm gonna use it to maintain the temple of the seed of God this is how we overcome right in the midst of Satan's Eden let me tell you my brother my sister this Eden is against you the world is a is against you the atmosphere is against us you know it's like I hate to use a carnal example but it's like a ball team that that you they play at home and they have home-field advantage man when they have home-field advantage they are the arena's full with people who are wearing wearing their t-shirts they're wearing their colors the band is there playing for them that the fans are there to cheer and to raise the volume and and the atmosphere they walk out on that stage to play that opposing team and men they have everybody behind them they have they have they have every they have they have all the music's behind them all the atmospheres behind them all the fans are behind them the stage is set they have home-field advantage but it's very different when that team leaves home-field advantage and they become the visitor and they travel to another city and in that arena it's not their colors it's not their flag it's not their music it's not their band it's not their team it's not their fans it's not their colors the music's not for them the atmospheres for them everybody's yelling against them everyone's hoping they're gonna fail the entire atmosphere is charged against them hoping trying to get them to fail their entire intention of that entire arena is for them to be losers but to let me tell you something my brother and my sister and this entire world's against you Satan's enemies are against you all the world's against you the music is against you the armies are again the fans are against you the atmospheres against you everything is against you but let me tell you something that's exactly how God set it up God did it intentionally this way he intentionally put this bride in the darker stage in the darkest hour and the darkest time in the most cold and indifferent age where spiritual death was all in the land you know why because when that visiting team gets the victory when they don't have home court advantage let me tell you something my brother my sister there is no victory a sweeter as when that team who is the visitor when everything is against them yet they leave champions yet they leave victors yet they leave over comers yet they leave victorious and they live as well they leave as winners o my brother my sister and you may not have this world may be against you and the music may be against you and the atmosphere may be against you all but if you could tune in to another dimension their saints that have already went on before us there's angels and jet they could run your race oh the Bible says there's a cloud of many witnesses hallelujah and they're encouraging you in a spiritual dimension saying don't give up don't stop don't lay down don't don't slow down now is the time to press for our Redemption draweth nigh closer than it's ever been before there's another dimension cheering for you there's another dimension pulling for you there's another your tune it's the music of onward Christian soldiers marching unto war oh let me ask you today where is God's temple today it's made up of people it's made up of you and be parkour ting de Paul our bodies are the Temple of the Holy Ghost and like Israel our Lord maintains this temple their spoils gained in battle that's why our trials are meant more than just for our survival through every battle that you go through little large every single one of them are for riches are for resources wealth he's stockpiling a treasury of goods from our warfare and those spoils are dedicated to building and maintaining his body the church Jesus think about this just for a minute here years after Solomon a year years after Solomon builds the temple years after he's gone it was maintained Solomon builds that template in its original glory it's an original pristine condition and you know what it was maintaining good order by the spoils taken not in Solomon's war but in David's war think about this my brother my sister Solomon is may able to maintain the temple by going into the Treasury of spoils that his father won years before I hope you catch it God's house stays vibrant God's house stage stays beautiful stays colorful because his people had emerged from every conflict not victorious but with riches rich in resources and and and solomon uses the battles won from his father oh my brother my sister do we realize that we're standing the only reason we can have this gospel and we could have this message is because others have given their life others have lived their life others have striven for in their life were maintained because of past victory it's not just it's not just uh you know a new generation it's an old generation a new generation a cloud of many witnesses that's why God sends trials to your life and makes you an overcomer your testimony is not for you you may think that testimony of how you came out of that trial was for you it wasn't for you is for the whole body it was for you and the rest of the body of Jesus Christ so that they could reap the benefits of your success and your victory and the spoils of war I want you to turn to a story here in second chronicles as we close second chronicles chapter 24 the Jordan just send me a text let me know how long I've been I've been going here I think I think I know by just looking here almost almost an hour now maybe close to an hour let me just give me just a few more minutes here second chronicles chapter 20 and I want you just to read here this is a time where Jehoshaphat comes to such a place of wit sin and the Bible says here in verse 1 it says it came to this as second chronicles chapter 20 it came to pass also it came to pass after that the children of Moab and the children of a man with them other besides the ammonites came against Jehoshaphat to battle then there came some of them that told Jehoshaphat saying there come with a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea and on the side of Syria and behold they be in haze on Tamar which is in Getti Jehoshaphat feared notice it's not short of fear here's this great army that comes against Jehoshaphat and the Bible says in Jehoshaphat feared and set himself to seek the Lord and proclaim to fast throughout all Judah and Judah gathered themselves together to ask help of the Lord even out of all the cities of Judah they came to came to seek the Lord and Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem in the house of the Lord before the new court notice what it says here Jehoshaphat noticed now I want you to catch this Jehoshaphat was a godly king it was a godly man he feared the Lord but he had made a big mistake by it by making an alliance with a hab in the chapter before this and and now and he takes his own son and he gives us to marry the daughter of ADA a a band Jezebel and now because of that do mundo Jehoshaphat becomes shaken when his his his intelligence officer comes to Hillman and he comes running in and says there's an army gathered against us and and there's Kings that have made an alliance against us a a great multitude coming from beyond the sea and out of amram and and and then behold there it had there there and there in tomorrow which is right on your border so notice this just 15 miles away south of Jerusalem on the western shore of the Dead Sea and now Jehoshaphat realized the enemies right at the gate and his entire kingdom his entire life we're on the brink of being wiped out this King would have surely destroyed them completely complete extinction my brother my sister if there was ever a reason to panic Jehoshaphat had an excuse to panic it says he feared and he set himself to seek the Lord and proclaim to fast throughout all Judah what should we do in the time of crisis we should do exactly what Jehoshaphat did our need I don't care how you say brother matter I've got a great need then it should drive you to great prayer I've got a great calamity that it should drive you to great sincerity that's what it should do to us my brother my sister and the Bible says that that the Jehoshaphat begins to set himself it would have been very human to panic let me tell you what it would have been very human for Jehoshaphat to do it was not very human to call a fast it was not very human to start to pray to the Lord when he heard the news of the army within his borders I could have understand if he would have said call all my top generals get the mug get the army get it ready get it ready for war get it we don't have any time to waste we've got it we've got to act quick we've got to react to this and as soon as the troop as soon as the troops are ready you know if there was ever a time he could have stopped and listened to me my brother and my sister he could have panicked in that moment he could have panicked in that spot I tell you what was unnatural for him to do was to not panic and to set himself to seek in the Lord oh my brother and my sister he starts to seek and pray that's not automatic it should be but it's not Jehoshaphat could have not only reacted in panic he could have also got upset noticed this now now notice notice what happens here the Bible says that that that all of this all of his natural reaction his natural reaction would have been for Jehoshaphat just to trust in his army chapter if you read chapter 17 it tells of how great at the might of his forces he was equipped and ready for battle it had been easy for Jehoshaphat to say you know this is the moment we've been waiting for we're prepared for this call the army let's go get them but Jehoshaphat rather than trust in his army rather than trust in his resources he's going to publicly admit his lack of strength notice what he says here notice this I want you to follow along here he says here in verse 5 and Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem in the house of the Lord before the new Google Court and said O Lord God of our fathers are not thou God in heaven and rule us not thou over all the kingdoms of the heathen and in thy hand is there not power and might so that none is able to withstand thee art thou not our God who did drive out the inhabitants move down to verse verse 10 and now behold the children of a man mo of amounts a year whom that would as not let his or invade when they came out of Egypt verse 11 behold I say how they reward us verse 12 o our God will thou not judge them for we have no might notice he's going to admit this publicly for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us neither know we what to do but our eyes are upon thee what a picture this great King displays here Jehoshaphat is going to public admit his lack of strength that wasn't normal for Kings to do a king was royalty they were always to have a dignity but but it was it showed such character in Jehoshaphat that in the time of need he begins to cry out for God in the time of crisis he was the king of Judah you know Kings were proud that's what they were they were proud men and and that came with the office of a king they had an image to maintain leaders let me just say this just here for a moment leaders to be time confidence they've got to inspire leadership and the people who are following them but what you know what what kind of leader gets up and admits and says I'm helpless you know I don't have any strength against this army that's not good politics for a president to do or a king to do but Jehoshaphat admits his fear he calls a national prayer meeting and then he prays in front of everyone and says Lord in front of the entire congregation I man I am too weak for this army private him better for him politically to go and have a little private prayer meeting oh but he knew he was in deep trouble and so he openly admits the weakness and he calls upon the Lord verse 3 the Bible says Jehoshaphat turns his attention that means to set his face it literally means he determines to seek the Lord they not only they did they not only sought help from the Lord they sought the lord himself this was this was this was this was nothing new furred for King Jehoshaphat the Bible says in in in that same books second chronicles it says he sought the God of his father this Hebrew word seek it literally means to to beat a path to God because you frequent that way often oh I hope you catch that the Bible says Jehoshaphat puts his face he seeks the Lord that means that the Hebrew words seek it literally means to trample underfoot it's saying that he in his life he had beat a path to God because he frequented that way so often Jehoshaphat knew because so often in his life he see he sought God my brother my sister it ought not to be that we only seek God at times of calamity we should be seeking God every day of our life so that when calamity comes we have a trampled path a beaten path a way of which we've walked many times before and we hit our knees and say God just like I called before and times past I'm calling and seeking you again Lord oh the Bible says that is prayer notice notice here he says he says he says here let's let's pick it up here let me find my place again in second chronicles chapter 20 he says in all judah stood before the Lord verse 13 with their little ones their wives and their children he brings all of the family together what do we pray in the time of crisis what is our prayer look like Oh God deliver me oh I need you you're never as a president help time of trouble Oh curse the enemy oh oh but my brother my sister do we realize we miss something so crucial it's it's it's in a crisis we're not supposed to we're not supposed to in a crisis go and run and suddenly go to God and like you know like like a genie sometimes that's how people treat God suddenly calamity comes and crisis comes in Oh oh no oh no where's God where's God where's God and they decidedly they they're praying were they they should have been praying before Oh trial should cause us to seek God himself because he's exactly what we need and let me see let me say this to you my brother and my sister if you've got Jesus you can go through anything in your life if you've got the Lord on your side it doesn't matter how deep and dark your trial is you can go through anything and come out unharmed notice what he says here notice let me just pick it up just a little bit further notice that notice here's what he says here he says in verse 14 then upon jahaziel the son of Zechariah sorry I was trying to find my place here he says then upon jzl the son of Zechariah the son of Ben and I the son of GL he says here it came the Spirit of the Lord in the midst of the congregation notice what he says and he said in verse 15 hearken you all Judah you inhabitants of Jerusalem and thou King Jehoshaphat thus saith the Lord unto you be not afraid here's the command be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude for the battle is not yours what an important prince for the battle is not yours but gods the battle is not yours it's God's notice what he commands them for tomorrow go ye down against them behold they come up by a Clift of ziz and you shall find them at the end of the brook before the will witness of Jil you shall not need to fight in this battle set yourselves stand you still and see the Sun whew Oh Judah Oh Jerusalem fear not nor be dismayed he repeats it for tomorrow go out against them for the Lord will be with you and Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground and all Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the Lord worshiping the Lord the Levites the children of Acathla fights in the chiller of the core rites stood up to praise the Lord God of Israel with a loud voice on high bursts Worthen to the winners of Toccoa notice what it says here I want you to notice what Joseph at says before they go to battle it says and as they went forth Jehoshaphat stood and said hear me all Judah and you inhabitants of Jerusalem but notice the order here believe in the Lord your God so shall you be established believe in his prophets believe his prophets so shall you prosper it wasn't enough just to believe in the Lord they believed in the Lord but now a prophet had came and given on a message and he says in order for us to be victorious we've got to not just believe in the Lord we've got to believe in his prophet so shall you prosper and when he had heard this notice verse 21 when he had consulted with the people he appointed singers unto the Lord that they should praise them in the beauty of holiness he says that they should praise the beauty of holiness as they went out before the army and to say praise the Lord for His mercy endureth forever and then when they began to sing in the praise the Lord sent an ambush against the children of Ammon Moab and Mount Seir which were come against Judah and they were smitten notice the obedience here they had a promise that was given through a prophet it was one thing believed in an apple it was one thing to believe it it was another thing to act on the words these singers were worse taken their very lives on the truthfulness of a vindicated prophet they were staking their lives oh that word from the Lord oh that they notice what they say sir they were marching unarmed they had no armor they had no arms they had no weapons they had no fight they were simply singing praises to God against him a powerful enemy that could have destroyed them oh the Bible says and they went out see the Bible says they went out here notice this army that's coming together to fight them but as they go out Jehoshaphat encourages them and he says put your trust in the Lord your God and you'll be established put your trust in this prophets and you will succeed my brother how you gonna have confidence in the midst of calamity put your trust in the one the Lord your God and put your trust in his prophets and so shall you prosper you had to trust in the word of the Prophet and the added precedent trust and the word of the Lord came through the mouth of that prophet oh my brother pull up the slide brother Jordan let me give you what the prophet of God said let me let it be your trust and your appetite today the next slide this is from brother Branham he says in the word will defeat the devil anywhere anytime under any circumstance oh the prophet of God says give me a church so full of the Holy Ghost God will do in one year what all theologies failed to do in the two last two thousand years old brother Branham says if you can just get started God would do the rest he said brother Matt what are you repeating I'm repeating the words of the Prophet believe in the Lord your God and believe his prophets so shall you prosper brother Branham says it's always in the weakest moments when it looks like the true message is about defeated that's when God steps in hallelujah look at the next slide Devils tremble when the weakest Saints go to their knees brother Branham says have faith in God regardless of fillings or anything else it's God's Word you take a hold of it and hold on to it oh my brother my sister say amen to the Word of God they're in the church say amen to the word of god at home you got a battle in your life you got to struggle in your life believe he in the word of the Lord given through a vindicated prophet so shall you prosper I say a man to the Word of God listen what brother Branham says in the next slide in the last days the true bride church will come to the headstone she will be the super church a super race as she nears him they in the bride will be so much like him that they even be in image this is an order to be United to him they will be one they will be the very manifestation of the Living Word of God I say to you today put your trust in the Lord your God in the middle of your wit's end put your trust in the Lord your God and you'll be established and put your trust in its prophets and you shall prosper glory to God ephesians 3:20 unto him that is able ii above all that we ask or think put your trust in the lord for the battle is not yours the battle is the Lord's hallelujah musicians could you return could we stand to our feet together here today as we just bow our heads here all head bowed over the building eyes closed musicians just play something softly the song leader could come up and just be ready their brother Peter noticed this here he says put your trust in the Lord this is what Jehoshaphat was was encouraging them that it have any weapons they were too weak to fight notice the setting he says they they had no weapons they were too weak to fight the enemy but Jehoshaphat says believe the word they were going on the word of a prophet believe in the Lord your God and you shall be established put your trust in his prophets and you shall succeed o my brother and my sister tragically many have quit the battle tragically through storms and through trials many get end up through those trials bitter they end up hardened they end up anger they end up their faith it's just a shipwreck why because you haven't realized you haven't taken the resources the spoils that God was trying to give you through that battle you throw your treasure away when you walk away from your trial let me say that again you are throwing your treasure away when you check out the trial God has put in your life he didn't sin that trial just to make you an overcomer he gave you that trial to make you more than a conqueror Lord Jesus we thank you for your word today we thank you Lord that we have a sure word of prophecy we thank your Lord that today we realize the battle is not ours the battle is the Lord's Oh Lord Jesus as we read from the very beginning in Jeremiah Lord let us not be that cursing man Lord your word says cursed be the man who puts his trust in the arm of flesh Oh whose heart depart it from the Lord for he shall be like a Heath in the desert and shall not see when good cometh but shall inhabit that parched places of the earth Oh Lord but you said blessed is the man let me be that man Lord let me be that man let us be that one who puts their trust in the Lord oh you said whose hope is in the Lord for he shall be as a tree planted by the waters that spreadeth outer roots by the river and shall not see when the heat cometh but her leaf shall be green and shall not be careful in the year of drought neither shall cease from the yielding fruit oh my brother my sister this person that Jeremiah is referring to this person that Jeremiah talks about here they don't wait for God to move that they they they believe in God listen my brother my sister that person that curse in person that he's talking about uh they make their own plans they turn to their own ways they take their own shortcuts they're always scheming planning manipulating their philosophy they live by is it's not what you know that counts it's it's who you know that person's for ever looking for that special person to solve all their problems spiritual the Bible says that there's a spiritual dryness that sets in to that person's life he'd still be like a heath like a shrub in the desert he looks barely alive with no fruit no wellspring of life he's always on the brink of dying he never partakes of the joy of being delivered by God's hand and everything he looks at he turns into everything he he looks at everything that looks good it turns into misery for him he's existing he's living in parched places he keeps withering away but notice what Jeremiah you who trust in the Lord the Bible says this man is planted he has roots he has stability he has a reservoir of living water he's always spreading out fruitful and green with fresh life older you want to be that kind of Christian the Bible says he will not be careful that means fearful in the time or the year or the season of drought when things get hot and bothered some when hey when things get when things get so out of control Ord I trust that the Word of God has spoken to your heart and you could say Lord in the midst of my wit's end let me cry out to the Lord and Lord may I come out of this trial not just an overcomer but let me come out of this situation more than an overcomer let me come out of this calamity that is shaking the entire world Lord let me come out of this more victorious than before I went into this problem we ask it Lord bless every life bless every person god we pray Lord as we just worship you here for a moment god
