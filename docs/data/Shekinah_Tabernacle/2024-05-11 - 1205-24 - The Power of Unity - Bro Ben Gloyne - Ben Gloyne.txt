========================================

[Music] praise the Lord hello welcome to church this morning how are you good praise the Lord we're going to have a good time in the Lord this morning I can feel already feel a great atmosphere here an atmosphere of expectation an atmosphere that we're going to receive what we expect this morning so um praise the lord it's good to be alive you happy to be alive who's happy to be alive who's happy to be alive come on man we got hope we can praise the lord we got breath we can worship God this morning that's such a wonderful ful thing to be alive to have opportunity to serve God and to to live I'm so grateful for life and for the you know all the things that we have we even in this modern society we have so many things that make our life easier when was the last time you washed clothes over like a we used to have an old kind of washboard when I was a young fell we were I'm not old we were just very poor and we had an agitat washing machine and we used to have to the this machine just went and wash the clothes barely wash them and then there was like a roller there's two wheels and you had to put the washing through there to dry it out before you hung it yeah and it would mangle your fingers cuz you you put your fingers so your fingers would get caught in the wheels who had one of those yeah man and it would go but when the machine washing machine broke which was half of the time we live way out in the country then it was like a washboard mom would have a washboard and she' be like scrubbing these clothes on a washboard but we don't have that issue anymore and sometimes we don't appreciate you know I wonder often wonder you know when we complain a bit in this Society the Lord God sees all the Earth and he can compare one with the other and he sees us oh God I'm going through such a hardship my washing machine broke you know for real and there's someone in another part of the of the world that maybe they're they're they they can't even find a morsel of food to keep their body alive or they're in some War torn country mangled somewhere and and and our biggest trial you know is our washing machine broke and we maybe don't have enough money to get a new [Music] one

amen so let's go to Psalms 133 this morning and um trust everyone's happy well at home and rejoicing amen the tomb is still empty today hallelujah amen praise God Amen so we're going to uh read here Psalms 133 and and we're just going to read the whole Psalm heads three verses then we're going to go to Galatians 69 and 10 again so Psalms 133 and one a song of degrees of David now that word degrees means it's a song of elevation or Ascension so so I pray we we live this song our life lives it behold how great and how Pleasant it is for Brethren to dwell together in unity it is like the precious ointment upon the head that ran down upon the bed even Aaron's bed that went down to the skirts of his garments as the Jew of Heron and as the Jew that descended upon the mountains of Zion for there the Lord commanded the blessing even life forever more hallelujah amen and we're just going to read uh two scriptures here from Galatians chapter 6 uh: 9 and 10 but as as you're um yeah we're just going to read this I know I mentioned this on Wednesday we're just going to kind of Take A Part Two uh of Wednesday if that's okay for you with everyone amen amen amen uh so Paul is admonishing the Galatians the Lord is speaking to us he says let us not be weary and well-doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not as we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men especially unto them who are of the household of faith amen we have an opportunity today we have an opportunity in our lives Amen to do good to all men especially into the household of faith amen let's just approach our lord Jesus in a word of prayer amen this morning if you have a need just want to slip your hand up to the Lord say Lord remember me Hallelujah gracious father we want to thank you so much as we bow our heads one more time in your presence we thank you that truly Lord you are the almighty God the creator of heavens and earth you are the God of all power the God of all Grace the God of all love we thank you as we have read your word this morning we know that any mortal that can read can read your word but Lord what we're depending upon is you the great author to come step out of History step on the scene once again and anoint your word Lord Jesus may it live in our hearts may you come and touch Our Lives May as we approach your throne of grace oh God may your great Mercy come and overshadow us change us make us new Lord grant it we love you we thank you for this opportunity to be in your presence together as a redeem people washed in your blood we want to ask as always be at those who couldn't make it today be their portion thank you Lord in Jesus Christ's name we commit the service down to your hands we surrender it Lord into your hands For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen God bless you you may have your seats uh this morning amen so I want to continue about this thought here you know because we got to look at the the magnitude of unity the magnitude of unity I want to talk about this this morning because as as David would say here and this is one of his there was many songs of degrees or songs of Ascension that David would write and there was a tradition that they would they would um sing these Psalms as they would Ascend up into Jerusalem and we are as a people we are ascending amen we're not descending we're not plateauing but we're going higher with the Lord we're going higher every day God is taking us higher into the reality of his word into to his presence and so David would say this is how good and pleasant is for for Brethren to dwell together in unity it is like the precious ointment upon the head that ran down upon the bed Even's Aaron's bed that went down to the skirts of the garden now you were to think about the significance of this where Aaron was the ordained man the only one that could could could could could shed uh uh sprinkle the blood of the atonement on The Mercy Seat for the people no one else could decide well today I'm going to go off the Blood On The Mercy Seat it was Aaron's position he was ordained to that position without him doing it none of the sins of the people were forg were forgiven so he had to be anointed to do this job he had to be dressed right you know there was quite a process and a you know a way of getting a a preparations made for him to fulfill his office and David is identifying Unity as just as important as the anointing that was upon Aaron because Aaron had to be anointed to be the high priest and I believe that the Bride of Jesus Christ must have Unity I mean in order to for us to fully manifest the office God has ordained us to be in amen you got to think you've been placed in a high and holy calling amen we are the Bride of Jesus Christ and and and and this position has great significance you going to think of like Esther The Queen Esther you know morai knew there was a need the Jews knew there was a need hmon had had had had it written into law that all the Jews are going to be killed on the 13th day of the 12th month it was it it was written in law but only one person could go in and intercede for her people only one person could go in and undo what hmon had done and this was this wasn't Mori you know sure Mori said to Esther if you do not go in God will bring Salvation another way but but perhaps you've come into the kingdom for a Time such as this amen so she was ordained to go before the king to get Mercy for her people amen so this is it was her job she was placed in that position she wasn't looking for it I doubt I doubt very much as a young girl she said one day I'm going to be queen of this Empire this wasn't her ambition but God moved her into this position am mean that God's mercy could be extended that the that the threatenings and the death threat under her you know that her people were living under would be reversed amen that the devil schemes would come back upon his head and it would become a victory Hallelujah and that's the same thing with you and I friends we must have Unity among us we must have just more just ahead knowledge I believe the message there must be such a Oneness between us am me of the baptism of the Holy Ghost living through everyone amen that we are literally one body amen not just because we come to this church forget about that stuff not we have a Unity of spirit amen a Unity of heart a Unity of purpose amen you say well we've got to iron out all the doctrine now we'll all disagree on something absolutely if we really split hairs enough we will F oh he doesn't believe it this way a he doesn't believe it that way no no it's got to be Unity of spirit it's got to be the Holy Ghost having preeminence in every life I mean because brother Braham sees about it he speaks about it in Christ the mystery God revealed and I don't know if I can scroll enough to find it but he says he says you know you know the the new birth is a revelation of Jesus Christ to you that's a true Born Again experience where God reveals you who Jesus Christ is more than a prophet more than a man but the God man God himself manifested in flesh and Hallelujah that is the New Birth when you re when God reveals you who he really is hallelujah then what happens he puts his Spirit within you will you cry Abba Father you know who your father is you know who your parent is you know who your mother is cuz he's both father and mother of us right amen so so that changes who you are it changes how you operate and brother B says if we could only get maybe let's just find that shall we last slide oh man I tell you what praise the Lord for the there we go see the new birth is Christ is a revelation God has revealed to you this great mystery and that's a new birth then what are we going to do when you get all that group together where the Revelation is perfect in Harmony in God expressing it through his word by the same actions the same things he did making the word manifest so some people take that and say well we're going to get all the doctrine perfectly right and then now now the Revelation is perfect now God can move no the prophet speaking about those who are truly born again they've truly met the Lord I mean you get that body together something's going to move amen there's Harmony the devil can't move in there's no unbelief to to rule anywhere skepticism gone cynicism is gone unbelief is gone there's a perfect Unity among the people what could happen amen when there's a people that are one with our Lord Jesus Christ amen each and individually they've met the Lord they know who he is they've come to exalt his name praise His name worship Him above everything what could happen in a people like that I mean what could happen in a group like that where Faith as brother and says I see it all milky of the people real all Faith Bank over the people amen and people accept the Promises by faith and God does the miraculous what could happen in a group like that friends and I don't believe we're looking in the future for that to happen I believe it's here in our midst amen I mean wherever there's a true of Jesus Christ there's that Unity amen but we must strive for that Unity because we must realize what it can do am mean where God could create his because remember the same holy ghost in him Was the Same Spirit that created the world Amen the same one the very same one that said let there be sun moon and stars as he was condescending down through the Old Testament through the prophets he finally the fullness that godhe bodily became Jesus Christ right amen so the same one that said let there be sun moon and stars was now own flesh and he'd say to the scribes and Pharisees you know Abraham Rejoice to see my day and i''d say you're not even yet 50 years old what are you talking about Abraham he was he was ages ago he said before Abraham was I am he identified this is who I am amen so that same one changed his form amen went back as a pillar of fire again we know his physical body is there at the Majesty on high interceding for us hallelujah I'm glad we have a high priest on you am mean not just a natural human but a God man interceding for you and I amen we're going to meet him one day in the a that's what Believers believe but his spirit that was within him amen came down on the day of Pentecost and dwelt in the church now he wasn't any lesser God because he's in a church now amen he wasn't any lesser ower and ability and might and strength and grace and mercy he didn't diminish nothing when he went into the 120 and he hasn't demission he hasn't diminished nothing amen coming and dwelling in you and I am mean he's equal in power remember he's the God of all power he's a God of all might he's a God of all Grace amen he can do the miraculous I'm convinced God can do anything that's me I'm convinced he can do anything now I'm concerned Lord I want to see you do it amen I want to see you take your word take a sinner of someone who's just even a good moral person transform their life amen dwell in them like never Hallelujah that's what I want to see hallelujah amen but you see now he's looking for a bride body Amen to manifest himself through which I believe I'm looking at this morning morning am mean so so as I'm I'm just repeating this because I want to emphasize it it's so vital we have Unity you want to see us really manifest our position as the bride of Christ let Unity come Among Us let all the funny feelings and the funny thoughts and the funny thing just just kick them out throw them in the trash throw them in the I don't care box it doesn't matter box just just get rid of those things they don't they won't help you nothing has a funny feeling about someone that's proven to be wrong has it helped that person that thought it maybe for years I thought you about this well you were wrong for years let's get rid of that stuff amen I just I just admonish you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ get rid of those things think best of everyone amen amen think best of everyone right I'm not saying go around with blinkers but think best of everyone pray for those PE if you're really concerned pray because we are ascending amen so we need you a a greater Unity among one another Amen brother an said that that that we should be sad when we walk out of these doors or we're not together it should we should feel like man we miss each other amen that's how we should feel man I want to see my brother I want to see my sister I miss them I wonder how they're doing today you know it should be such a love absolutely of that guy especially brother so and so man I'm glad no one has that last name but you know especially that one especially that sister there should be such a love man I miss those people and there special to me Lord I'm so thankful that that that that I can walk this walk with you with them at the same time hallelujah amen so there's such a there's such a power and unity so we must we have this opportunity we have this opportunity to be a body of Believers that are truly one with the Lord and one with each other we have such a powerful opportunity this where where where what what God turn in his mind of a church operating in harmony I mean pastors Deon trustees musicians song leaders Sunday school teachers everyone mothers children everyone oldest to the youngest Elders whatever you know everyone is in perfect Unity hallelujah amen this is what God's looking for and I believe that and the message is here to produce it amen God's word is here to produce it amen so we have this great opportunity now we must never ever let anything get between us amen amen well I disagree on something listen I as I said Wednesday I'm not really a fan of savory food don't cut me out of your circle okay some people don't like pumpkin I still love the guy anyway not that I'm a big fan of pkin but you know you know what I mean but you know there's always be something that we'll disagree on that's okay praise the Lord that's fine we can we can we can look can you look over those things you say that's a ridiculous example well in the sight of God our little things that we just keep and know and you know they're they're just as ridiculous because he's looking at this when he spoke to when he spoke to David and David Pinn the song down I believe he was looking at you and I yeah there's going to be people who are going to embody this they're going to have such a Unity among them that God can do whatever he wants in their midst whatever he wants however he wants there's such a Unity I mean where the we we where the spirit of God is so welcome yo the devil loves division the spirit of God brings Unity amen I mean what did he do Jesus came what did he do he began to call his disciples I'm going to unify with my attributes he called Peter James and John they're all attributes of God they're in flesh the woman at the well the woman with the blood or all different kind of ones they're all gathered amen and then he came down in the upper room what and then now now the Holy Ghost goes out to gather more of God's attributes to himself this is what this is what I mean by God loves loves Unity hallelujah amen so let us not be weary and while doing now Paul would describe and I was looking at this last night where he says the works of the flesh but then there's the fruits of the spirit he doesn't say the works of the spirit and the works of the flesh he says the works of the Flesh and the fruit of the spirit so now he lists all these we'll just read it but if you are LED of the spirit you're no longer under the law Pard me now the works of the flesh are manifest which are these adultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousness idolatry witchcraft hatred variance emulations Wrath Strife seditions heresies envyings murders drunkenness um riving Rings however you say it and such like of which I tell you before as I have also told you in the past that they which do these things shall not inherit the kingdom of God am mean so this works it means from the Thea Bible dictionary I like this where it says it says a business and employment or that which anyone is occupied I trust that none of us are occupied by these this list yeah this is not on our CV it's not on our to-do list it's not on our calendar reminders none of these things are near are near what we do we're not employed by those things it's that which one undertakes to do an Enterprise or an undertaking I trust that none of the works of the flesh are in our Enterprise or in our undertaking it's it's nothing that we undertake to do are you following me I I trust you and say amen I mean this is obvious but I'm sure you know because the works now so so it's an employment now we were all employed by the devil Once Upon a Time our first birth made us his slave now a slave is still employed the conditions are terrible but you still you still have a boss and they tell you what to do and you have to do what they say and slave gets beaten or whatever they you know if they don't listen so we were all employed to do the works of the flesh Once Upon a Time amen but but we had more than a boss but our our father came our our great king said no no you're not ordained to fulfill this list though you may have been employed by your first birth you're employed by this you're employed to do this as a slave but then now I'm come to break I've come to break this power am mean that the works of the Flesh of these things will not be manifested in your body no more amen that this will not be your works but you will enter into rest now we know the true rest in the Bible is the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's the true rest of God it's not keeping a day it's not Sabbath or anything that which was just a shadow of people truly entering into rest and so now there remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God for he that entereth into his rest he also hath ceased from his own Works amen so he ceased from his own employment you know his own undertaking his own Enterprise so it's no longer him trying to live the word it's no longer him trying to be the Christian no no no you cease from your own ability and you let God's ability come in you let his Spirit come in there's no are you living and you trying to live the message no he lives it in you he lives it through you amen as the greatest joy that I've ever seen in my life is to see God come and take his own word am mean and say quit you you you quit trying let me do it I'm the professional I know what I'm doing I've been doing this for thousands of years living in my people and manifesting my word so come and let me do it amen so now when we truly enter into that rest amen we cease from our own Works amen but then Paul would continue down in Galatians 5 but the fruit of the spirit so it's not the works of the spirit the fruit of the spirit now this is important because I'm just I'm I am continue with my thought just just hold on to your seat or whatever now but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness Faith meekness Temperance against such there is no law for they that are christs have crucified the flesh with the affections and the lusts if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit let let us not be Dev uh desirous of vain Glory provoking one another but uh or envying one another now this word fruit we know it's like fruit from a tree but it's from which originates or comes from something it's an effect or a result so fruit comes from something like you take an apple tree the reason there's apples on that tree is there's the life of the apple tree is expressed in the fruit right even if you do grafting and things well you can still get the fruit that's been grafted on right so so it originates from something now so now you've got to look into yourself and say what does my life originate from does it originate just from my upbringing you know my parents were strict and they taught me a good moral way of being and this is how I am or you know I've been raised in the message so you know my conduct and all those things is based on my upbringing that way or is it because there's something within you that is far greater than an upbringing amen cuz remember we don't just grow into this thing no we meet him we meet the Lord and transforms our life amen it's good to be a good moral person that's fine but it ain't going to get you to heaven no it's the blood of Jesus Christ that will get you to heaven amen so now if we could look at what we have within us and where this fruit comes from to me it's very marvelous now in the Old Testament there was the ark of the Ark of the Covenant now we know that in this Ark there was there was certain things within this Ark this Ark represents the human soul right because because because the pattern that Moses saw that he built represents the human body we're not going to go into those things but I just want to Major on this here so now this Ark was was was overlaid and inside and out with gold deity so this wood it was covered in it was covered in Gold amen so so when we really meet the lord it's no longer our wood or our Humanity living no we''re been overlaid with deity amen with beaten gold and there's a mercy seat upon the top amen and then and then under that Mercy Seat there was there was three items within the ark there was there was the two tablets of stone of the law now everyone's got that within them but if you got to have blood on The Mercy Seat that makes the difference amen but the word as as because people who do things of the law even though they don't know the law they're still under that law that's why everyone has a conscience right but God would God would take his word and by his holy ghost write that law in your heart he would rearrange your operation system give you a new software upgrade amen that that that that how you live is based on the word not in here but in here amen that that the word in here controls your conscience controls your desires controls all that you are amen now and and and then also in there is a pot of Mana that first fell amen and this Mana never gets old amen sure it was the same Mana that fell on the outside you know around where the Israelites picked it up but that Mana got old that Mana rotted that Mana got stinky and all those things because it was kept out there but that same man was brought put in a golden vessel and put within the Ark of the Covenant and that and that manner never goes old amen so that word that's hidden in the heart of a Believer amen with truly knows the Lord that word never gets old it never gets moldy never gets stagnant never gets common amen but every mouthful is Rich am me every mouthful is as satisfying as the first one every mouthful amen it doesn't make you sick it doesn't make you you know oh I don't you I can't stand that food anymore no it's just wonderful am mean why cuz it's Mana that never gets old Hallelujah but also within there is Aaron's Rod now Aaron's Rod was just a star um y your your your an Armond tree just a but but it was fashion by man into a into a staff I don't know how big the original limb was that he had but you know he would have shaped it would have sanded it maybe put some binding around it to hold it a bit grip and different things but it was a man-shaped rod a man fashioned rod God but then when it came and it was dead it was dried up it was just a dead stick and that's that's what we were amen before we come into the holy of holies we're a dead stick shaped by this world shaped by our culture shaped by our upbringing we're all fashioned by these things and but but there was a life within us and it may look humanly possible this stick is dead but when it come to the presence of God I mean overnight it Blossom forth armonds again amen the potential that was within it by the Holy Ghost it came forth amen it's the same thing with you and I friends we were once shaped by the world and all these things but when we came into the presence of God that life that was buried within us that even people thought it wasn't there it came out hallelujah hallelujah amen like the woman at the well amen you look at her life she was a dead stick amen shaped by pain and hurt and regret and finding love in all the wrong places amen but when she went into the holy of holies and said we know where Messiah cometh he'll tell us these things amen what she buted to life Hallelujah she ran into the city said come see a man that told me all things over it is this not the very Messiah what happened she had been in the presence of the shakina glory amen and her life had been transformed hallelujah amen so you see now there's these three three very vital things within every Arc of testimony now we know that this actually represents you and I so I trust that there is within you the word that never gets old amen that God has written the word on the tables of your heart amen that when you go to transgress that law the Holy Ghost says I don't want you to do that because when the Holy Ghost will come he'll convict you of sin he will tell you when you're stepping wrong amen you got to surrender to him and let him lead you but he'll tell you hey no no this is a danger zone I I I don't want to do this thing amen so there's that there's a word that never gets old and there's life like Aaron's Rod there was life amen so I trust now this is what you're walking around with now you got to think about it how powerful it is to access what's within this and of course on every believer the The Mercy Seat is sprinkled with the blood of Jesus Christ am mean so it's no longer a judgment seat cuz when there was no blood there was judgment but when the blood was there was a seat of Mercy amen so now Mercy has been given so Mercy can be extended amen if you know what it's like to be forgiven you can forgive if you know what it's like to receive the mercy of God you didn't deserve it you didn't earn it but he gave it to you freely then you can give Mercy to others no matter what they've done to you you can extend Mercy well how do you extend that Mercy you can lift them before God and prayer you can you can be you can sure you can have a lot of pain and hurt from what they've done to you but you can have a genuine concern for their soul you can feel sorry for them you can actually you want to see them on the other side amen glory Lord amen we can live in such a way that pain actually just turns into prayer amen that pain and hurt doesn't turn into doesn't build bitterness but no it just it it causes us to intercede amen so these things are all within the believer now if you look look at Hezekiah I was thinking about Hezekiah and and maybe I should have just preached on him for a bit but you know you look at Hezekiah there he was in Jerusalem this Ark was in the temple but they needed to be unified in order to access God's power because the Assyrians had gathered around they had they had swallowed up pretty much the whole country and they had they had men that had now their army had besed Jerusalem and they begin to speak to to Israel in their own language they they begin to use the terminology of a Believer against the Believers they begin to use the quotes misinterpret it they use the scripture misinterpret it to try and pull down the confidence that that the people had in their God and in their King right but then they begin to unify that God was still a deliverer Unity came in because you would think you have you have heard the enemy has swallowed up everything else so what they've said is true look at all the places we've been their gods didn't help them your God is the same as theirs you know Hezekiah is leading you wrong and you're going to be destroyed and when we take the city we're going to butcher you all all these things that would have caused a lot of different thoughts going on yeah what's going to happen to my family what's going to happen to my children what's going to happen to my daughters what's going to happen to me all those thoughts and maybe thoughts of maybe we could escape this way and you know but but they they because their King was a Godly King and he and he gathered the people say look our God is a deliverer he delivered in the days of Moses he delivered Goliath into into David's hands he delivered many enemies look at look at we have testimony amen of his power of Deliverance and he can do the same thing today and he went and so what they do they unified on that one attribute of God that he's a deliverer Hallelujah they unified on that one one attribute of God as a people they said basically Lord help us we're in big trouble we can't fight we can't win this battle look what they've done and God says no no no I've heard I've heard their accusations they're actually talking against me now I'm because because Hezekiah stood for God God stood for Hezekiah am mean because Hezekiah believed God's promises then God became concerned about Hezekiah and the people of Israel because Hezekiah and the people had respect unto God praise the Lord so this Ark that was there they accessed God dwelling between the cherubims and God anointed one of their prophets or their priests and he said tomorrow they're all going to be dead if I've got the story right and what that night the angel Lord came out just slew all the Assyrians amen God fought for them because they unified on one promise friends we got many promises to unify on Amen we got many promises to unify on and the way to unify on it is to have a full confidence God can do it God can do it how's he going to do it I don't know but God can do it I mean maybe they thought when they came before the temple there and begin to pray how's how's God ever going to deliver us he said and and and maybe they said well maybe they had lots of ideas well maybe the Egyptians will come up or maybe this one will come up or maybe this will happen but then they no doubt they would have come to the conclusion he's a deliverer let him do the delivering let however he wants to do it he's going to do it but let's unify together let's have a Unity among the people that God can come down and bring a mighty Deliverance prise the Lord hallelujah and we know the rest of the story it's exactly what happened the angel Lord came down killed killed the enemies they had a mighty Victory why because they unified around around one promise Amen to let us and you think about that's just Israel under the blood of bulls and goats now amen it's not a people who had join ear with Christ join ears with God under the blood of Jesus Christ amen so now how much more people that are under under the blood of Jesus Christ they're not under the blood of bulls and goats they're not under the law anymore but they've been lifted Above the Law they've been lifted above am mean their own humanity and all those things and tradition but we've been restored back to the true word of God that we truly have received the atonement yeah now I was listening to someone the other day and they was speaking about that word atonement now that word atonement was actually uh invented by William Tindale William Tindale gave us so so he was really the first one well others did at the Bible but but but really he was the first one to to to to to fully translate it but then also distribute it because he is a contemporary of Martin Luther said the printing press and all these things and so he translated the Bible and he and and there was a lot of things that he did not have an English word for one was the atonement so he actually made that word up to try and represent what the Hebrew and the Greek and the Latin meant there and that and that word atonement is actually we know it's like three words at onement so so he's so he's actually God inspired him to say this is what the this is what the blood does it makes you one with God that's what if you have received the atonement you are at one with God how powerful is that you think about a man who is standing there in a day where the Catholic church was basically Supreme and that church was preaching you got to come through the church to meet God and yet you've still got to go to pergatory you got to do Penance you got to do all these things to try and please God but then God inspired a man am mean to say no this is what the blood does it makes you at one with God that you have received the atonement am mean that you're no longer a second class citizen no longer begging your way into heaven but the Lord Jesus himself by his blood has made you at one with him that once you're dead and trespass and sins but if you received the atonement friends am mean You' elevated above those things now you're alive in Christ and you're one with God hallelujah what an incredible thing to actually God Inspire someone to invent a word that is immensely powerful word amen where you look at where the you know where where where he would speak about the atonement a lot of course in the Old Testament of the high priest going in before you know taking the blood and into the mercy seat and spr you know sprinkling it and so on and that was the day of atonement so even yeah God was trying to get the people to see listen this blood makes you one with me how powerful is that you know but and and you think about it if you really recognize that it would change you it would change your thinking about God it would change your you're thinking about yourself would change you're thinking about your past it would change everything because you realize he's a holy God he's high and lofty in the heavens amen even angels look dirty in his sight but yet he's provided a way that I can become one with him yet he has made a way that though I may be in this body I may be all this kind of thing but God by his blood amen would would lift me up I mean that I'm more than a sinner amen but I've been redeemed I become one with him by his atonement amen the power of His atonement now under the blood of bulls and goats people who realize they're at one with God did Mighty things I mean when David saw Goliath he says who is this uncircumcised Philistine that defies the armies of the Living God basically he's saying look we are circumcised Hebrews we have been God has made an atonement for us that we're at one with him amen but this man who's boasting and look so big and so fearsome has has no Covenant with god he has no atonement amen he is God has done nothing for this guy I mean but he's done everything for us so therefore he could stand there and say no I'm going to take his head off I mean because I have a covenant with God I mean so so David's thinking was totally different to the rest of Israel CU he realized the power of that atonement hallelujah hallelujah amen now friends I trust it's the same thing with you and I this morning amen we realize the power of the atonement amen we're not just church join us amen putting our name on a book just trying to have some kind of religion no God has elevated us to be joiners with him amen that his atonement has covered us over drawn us back into his presence made us sinless in his sight amen that we are the children of God Amen do you realize these things I trust I I trust it means a lot to you I have received the atonement Hallelujah I'm on my way to heaven shouting Victory Amen in spite of all the trouble heartache sorrow pain whatever more no I have receive the atonement amen so therefore I have confidence with God I can walk before him I can lay myti at his feet and he hears my prayers he's concerned about my welfare he's worried about what I'm going through and he is interested in my situation he's not unmindful because you got think about now an at onement means Two Become One like a true marriage is a you'd say an atonement two become one right so now in Israel Israel was always second class citizen to God they always because the blood of bulls and goats though they had an atonement it wasn't an atonement in reality because it could not never elev at the people to be joint ears with God right and this was shown in the Old Testament where where where where the the you know the women there in in Israel were second class citizens to the men they could not come in like because there was different you know how there was different places people could have um come to that that was the closest they could approach the holy of holies first it was the court of the Gentiles we could come but we couldn't come as close as the Hebrew woman then there was the court of the woman a bit closer than the Gentiles but but not as close as the men and then after that was the priests and then the high priest go to the holy of hly so so the woman could not come as close as the men right but then now Peter is is is writing to the New Testament Church saying that husband and wife are join ears together so now coming under the blood of Jesus Christ we're all the same in Christ there's no second class citizens in the kingdom and there's not a Ministry than the people or anything like that or men and women no we're all on the same level amen and if you're a man and if you're still under the law your wife is a second class citizen spiritually to you that's how you treat her but if you're under grace you want to lift her up to be joiners with you that's that's that's your whole desire would be that your family your wife would become joiners with you you're not they're not down there and they don't know nothing they don't know God no they're spiritual they know the Lord we're in this together we're on equal footing amen uh well some people are not convinced about that well get into Christ then you'll be convinced amen so now we have this atonement which was just it was an it was so it was an at onean as I said so now by the blood of Jesus Christ We Are One amen glory we are we have been atoned am mean God has atoned us he's brought us back together amen and I love it because if you look at the you know even even this word atonement was you know it it has a meaning of of um you know when when um it's the same kind of word that that is described when Moses speaks about when Noah builds the ark it says and he pitched the ark within and without with um you know with pitch right and that word is actually means atonement so it's actually a covering and what did it do it covered the whole Ark that atonement so when you looked at the ark I don't know what um basically you just see one whole thing you don't see separated boards anymore though they're nailed together and fixed in place you don't see separated individual pieces of wood put together you see one whole thing cuz it's been atoned for there's a Oneness in the ark you following me there's no gaps and holes and plugs where your water can come through no no it's all atoned for amen and and and and that's what exactly what the Lord has done for you and I amen that that Ark was atoned for amen that the atonement stood between the ark and the Judgment cuz the go for word it was made out of was was porous it would just it's like a sponge you don't build boats out of that kind of wood unless it's been atoned for you see and it's the same thing with our Humanity we are like a sponge we'll absorb any Spirit we'll absorb anything but if there's the atonement here amen that thing can trouble you in your mind can try and come into your spirit but there's an atonement I mean it may it may buffer against you but it can't it can't rule you it can't take you over you can you can push back against that thing amen why cuz you've been Aon you've been pitched within and without amen by the blood of Jesus Christ amen so so what you've been atoned for that you can stand the Judgment than Glory Hallelujah so as this world is falling apart we ain't falling apart no we're standing on the solid rock of Revelation hallelujah thank you Lord praise the Lord amen and you know what's beautiful is that when the Lord gives you the Holy Ghost it's a confirmation that confirms the atonement to you amen so it's no longer a hope is or I believe it in faith no that Faith becomes reality why because you're pitched within and without you've been atoned for the Holy Ghost when the Lord returns back in that form in you it's a confirmation you have the atonement so what have we got to worry about what have we got to fear nothing at all n there is nothing there is nothing that we need to worry about doesn't matter what enemy comes against us we have the atonement HJ Hallelujah and we've got to realize friends that there are no weak Parts with God I'm talking about the body of Christ now there's no stronger parts and weaker Parts no every part because remember the the same Holy Ghost comes and dwells in everyone the same quality maybe like brotherr would say you know the fullness of God here bodily dwelt in our lord Jesus says it's like you know you take the Pacific Ocean that's the fullness of God here bodily and maybe the Lord you know it's like but us he puts it in by measure right so it's like you take a teaspoon of that water and that's the measure the ocean without measure but the same chemicals the same quality of water is the same in the spoon as it is in the ocean and you think about God God is all powerful Almighty he said let there be sun moon and stars and there are amen nothing can stop him nothing can stop not even unbelief will stop him he'll move right on with his program amen he is Unstoppable he's unmovable amen he's all powerful Hallelujah he is all he is the almighty God so now he is in you what can God do in you see see God wants to take a people and he wants to take the same one that the devil used as a slave and show the power of the blood to show the power of redemption in those people with that mouth once spoke unbelief and Malice and strife and hatred it now speaks the word it speaks peace and love and joy and amen the anointing amen where once it tore people down then it builds people up once it invited Devils Now cast Devils amen that's what God wants to use us for amen you see so God don't have no little weak parts so you can say let the weak say I am strong if you say I'm not even much of a Christian but you're a Christian what's the devil trying to do push you down a hole somewhere saying you not going to amount to nothing no but you got giant killing faith I mean you got overcoming power in your life doesn't matter how you feel about yourself when God looks at you he says I see strength I see virtue I see love I see peace I see over coming power I see my word in flesh amen so don't say you're weak just say no I'm strong in the Lord yes I may have a lot of things about myself but no he is strong and he's the Overcomer and he's Within Me am mean God don't have no little weak parts and strong Parts he's alog together God and if you had enough God in youtil he is barely a shadow that's enough power to make a new Earth amen I don't believe he's talking things up that's true that's right yes so I'm not feeling much in faith today if you got a shadow of Faith boom that's enough power to make a new moon a new system it's God and it's strong and right now every believer in here has has life eternal which is God's spirit in you enough power that will raise up the dead it will heal the sick it will set the orbits and conditions amen we have power so he's not just to me he's not just talking about orbits and conditions of the solar system no you got power within you to bring Harmony to your home amen if you let God do it amen you can bring restitution restoration healing amen salvation where someone's gone way out of orbit amen they can come back into their orbit with god with the word amen but it's you it's controlled by a law that Spirit that's in you the Lord so that's a law so it's why it's whatever the Lord leads you to believe for that's yours not what just humanly you think for what he leads you to believe for and that's why it's so important God you can do anything I'm not going to put a limitation on you I'm not going to hind you in any way I believe you can do it Hallelujah I believe he can do it amen so so therefore now if you believe that way God is going to come on your scene I believe and do what you think is impossible like brother Bram would you know quote the scripture Mark 11 I think 24:23 if you say to this mountain be th removed and you know you know believe it'll happen and God told him about that scripture and God challenged him to believe it God and you know he's hunting squirrels he's looking at trees there's no squirrels there even the trees he's looking at squirrels don't naturally go on those trees they avoid them and God asked them what are you looking for well I'm here hunting squirrels how many do you want he's thinking am I what's going on here well you say you want how many do you want and he said I know five whatever it was and you know one just appeared he shot it and then he said well and then he goes to pick it up and that was nice and but God said I thought you wanted five or three whatever it was you've only got one or two he says well let the scroll go here here up on this Branch I'll shoot it here and the scroll just like that what did God do he interpreted that verse to the prophet amen God interpreted it by bringing it to pass so God wanted to prove the scripture in his life now we are not looking for squirrels hey if God led me to do that you know that's neat but but to me I've got more concerns than hunting squirrels right now amen we have sickness we're protocols we got troubles we got people who need to know the Lord there's a greater bride's Revival to experience amen more people to come in if we remain humble remember he'll bring people in they'll find rest the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen so there's many things amen that that that I have greater need of than than a squirrel but I believe God can give us the same faith I mean because it's governed by a law but I but I believe the same faith that was in the prophet is is within you and I because remember the purpose of the message was not brother brandham the purpose of the message is a bride one with the Lord Jesus Christ manifesting his word to the earth that is the purpose of the message it's not just to talk about what happened in the prophet's life all that was done that you would know and see the power of the blood in a redeemed son of man Son of God rather you know amen one of us Redeemed by the blood amen so now that's why we should say Lord you can do anything I'm not here to hinder you Lord I'm not going to put you in a box but Lord May the law of the spirit control me to speak whatever you want done amen amen see that same spirit that you've got in you will raise yourself up at the last day of the Resurrection the baptism of the Holy Ghost now I need to come back to something here because it's amazing where it speaks here about do not do if we just going back up here Galatians says let us not be desirous of vain Glory provoking one provoking one another envying one another and that word provoking means to irritate it's vain glory to irritate a Believer it is vain glory to try and be some kind of superior thing above someone else it's vain glory to you know there's a lot of attempted murder in a church brother Braham says murdering someone is not just shooting them it's killing their influence and there's a lot of attempted murderers that come in among believers they try and kill other people's influence is it it's vain Glory they do it to try and make themselves look better than someone else they irritate by their actions by their deeds by their words why because they want to be appear to be better than someone else we're not called for this stuff Our Lives should not irritate one another we may cause misunderstandings we're human we understand those things but we shouldn't purposely irritate one another amen we should live above these things we're not living in a playground where I'm the king of the castle you're the dir rasal kind of game or let's play run away from that guy we used to play that at primary school we were kids we needed a good box line to come on a wake up and hey he's a he's a person too he's in the school too just like you that's wrong don't treat him that way I think I've grown up past that hopefully you know but that kind of thing is to Pro to provoke or to irritate we should not irritate one another by our actions we our action should bring Harmony should bring peace you want to think about how do I treat other people well I'm annoyed at something well don't don't bring that annoyance among other people I had a bad Drive well I didn't but the argument sake people get road rage then they spend the rest of the day pouring that road road rage out on other people was I driving there was I in front of you was I on the road at the same time why are you treating me like that person you know and really we should be big enough to say well if you're stuck in traffic God wants you stuck in traffic praise God lord I can talk to you a bit longer in the car we can have a conversation in the car longer I can be on the phone you know there's a reason why you're stuck in traffic don't be caught up in you it's like people get this thing in their mind if they've got to deal with the IID or deal with you know something that's oh it's going to be tense it's going to be stressful it's not always going to be that way why why come with that preconceived emotion oh well there's nothing to fight against therefore you know I've got to C some IR here we're going to have some trial in no we don't have to have a trial turn your gun against the devil and blast his head off for once he's a big enough Target just just turn your prayers well how do I do that love the Brethren be good to one another amen pray for one another that's how you blow the devil's head off right instead of irritating causing irritation no let's just let's just move on you know I think I think we should have you know church or or when we get together should almost there shouldn't be any drama there should be a drama-free group it shouldn't be well last week Sono did this and this and this and this and this and this no that's irritations but we should live beyond those things what are we what are we striving to achieve we're striving to achieve that God would come and live in us as a people amen that the power of the spoken word can be fully manifested that whatever God wants to do he can do it am amen amen amen amen so let's get rid of let's get rid of irritations but you see the thing is now this is uh somewhere in Southland anyway that road has two ditches on one ditch on either side right now the way of Holiness is a highway it's oneway Street we're called to walk up the middle of it we're not called to go near one side or the other because one ditch is legalistic one ditch is liberal both are ditches we're not called to walk in the gutter uh we're called to walk down the middle amen amen but what keeps you in the what what what puts you in a ditch is a lack of genuine love for God you know and and how do you know you love God you love the Brethren if you have a genuine love it'll keep you in the middle it's not being a bit more legal keeps you in the middle no it'll put you in a ditch there's two ditches no if you genuinely love the Lord he will keep you in the middle of the road amen because both legalism and liberalism are a perversion of a genuine walk with God and I don't believe I'm looking at a perversion this morning okay so don't live a perverted Christian life being legal or liberal you'll end up in a ditch and that ditch will become a trench that trench will become a bunker and you'll stay there keep walking up the highway would you if you're driving in this scener do you really want to sit in this ditch I'd rather man we're going up to those mountains we're going on an adventure what's around the corner I don't know but it's neat isn't it the same way with God I'm just going to sit here this is all like no well 10 years ago this happened but I'm still here no keep walking this person said this and I'm still living under it no I'm living under the atonement I'm living under the power of the blood I'm walking up the highway things will try and push you I guess we've all experienced it you're driving along and a big crosswind comes along do you go I'm in the ditch no you keep you you you you let the car correct right you you subconscious correct the car to stay on the lane yeah I hope you do anyway otherwise let's go have some driving lessons but you know but it should be the same spiritually a crosswind will come the devil tries to push you into a ditch this person said this and you don't need to do this and that person's enforcing this and this it's a crosswind comes along your way no say Lord correct me that I'm in the middle well how do you know that you're in the middle well I'll tell you if you're in a ditch or if you're going down into one of those ditches you despise the other side if you're legal you despise the liberal and if you're liberal you detest the legal if you love you're calling from both sides come let's go up the mountain amen let's go on a road trip this is awesome don't sit here amen so let's keep walking let's not let's not despise anyone you say they've been in a ditch a long time we've got big cranes we can move some Earth can can't we can't we dig out you see someone stuck who's ever you know seen someone crash in the you you see a you see car in a ditch the first thing you do I trust is slow down see if anyone's there if you see police tape whatever you keep driving right but but you're concerned man someone's in the ditch here this is bad and if someone was you'd stop You' call one1 you'd see how they are you do all those things right what about spiritually is it spiritually you just kind of go B CL and keep driving oh you deserve to be in there you should have been paying attention no you pull over hey brother how you doing sister how doing you know the Lord's awesome let's Happ you out here don't you love the Lord isn't he so good what do you do you pour in oil and wine into their wounds like the great Samaritan I mean you know you know the Good Samaritan brother BR tells that I mean the Lord Jesus sorry tells that Parable and brother BR interprets it saying that that man was going from Jerusalem down to Jericho he was backsliding and and during his backsliding amen the devil's got a hold of him and beat him up and robbed him for everything he had now he's laying there wounded what is he basic he's in the ditch and people come along who should have helped him but they didn't help him and the guy who shouldn't have helped him because of the segregation Samaritan and Jew helped him but the reason he helped him is because he had the oil and the wine and the bandages to bind him up and he had the donkey to carry him to the Inn do we really have what we say we have or do we keep walking like the Pharisee who had none of those things oh but I'm a Believer do you have oil and the wine what is that that's the oil is the anointing and the wine is the stimulation of Revelation amen and mean you start pouring that into someone isn't the Lord good Hallelujah I I saw this quote the other I read this scripture I heard this song Come and joy and what are you doing you're actually pouring those things into their wounds amen you know someone's maybe been wounded by disappointment or someone's someone's misuse and whatever more you can pour in the oil and the wine of how God good is how faithful he is how he's he's not going to leave us in this condition he's come to heal us God Is A Healer God cares what are you doing you're pouring oil and wine into their wounds CU you think naturally who pours oil and wine into wounds Jesus is speaking about spiritual wounds you see and the Samaritan had the donkey to put the wounded man on to carry him to the end brother says it's the church right do we have the oil and the wine and the donkey and the bandages if you have the Holy Ghost you you're you're carrying that medical first aid kit amen hallelujah so don't just walk on and say well that's them no we should have a concern stop say hey you okay how we doing the Lord's good praise the Lord oh they're so negative we'll become positive and they'll become positive say Lord whatever's on me will just go on them amen the joy of the Lord will yeah it's infectious praise the Lord amen hallelujah I see I've run out of time but you see now when the Holy Ghost comes into us he's got to grow right and we'll and and and I'll show you the scripture here see it says not self-will when God comes into the man into the heart which is the spirit then the spirit makes the soul and then the soul dwells in the body now when a man is converted say just um say just that little white button starts in his heart now that part is God and God when he's born again with the spirit of God God God's spirit dwells in him now as he can let that Spirit grow you got to let him grow let him take over your life amen that's why sanctification is an on going process I trust the things you used to do a year ago you don't do no more right and you can look back a year before that you're even more closer to God more Sanctified your thinking is more pure more right what's God sanctifying you he what's that God's spirit is taking over more of your life amen now as he can let that Spirit grow and take out all the roots of buness and press God's way through him again so there's all these things will come up come out of our life maybe our past or whatever more God's holy spirit's here to to take over those things but if we let the Lord deal with them amen how many men basically 100% of them won't go to the doctor if they're not feeling well like seriously yep we can't be that way spiritually that's right cuz physically people say oh no it's a pain it's fine she'll be right Nick minute stage four cancer why didn't they go I'm not I'm not saying that about anyone but it's just an example why didn't they go to the doctor when they first had that thing and they had the concern about it it's like spiritually something bit something in your spirit you go to the doctor the Lord Jesus the spirit in you the Holy Spirit takes over those things takes it all out of your life he can become back in the same condition that he was when he was in the Garden of Eden Jesus said in mark 11:24 very very I say unto you if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe that you uh what you have said will come to pass you can have what you've said that puts him right back Supreme again puts him right back in the condition right he say well do I need to examine my life and see what's wrong no just love the Lord and keep walking with him right and anything comes up you say Lord I give it to you that's right and keep walking and you allow God then to bring healing and overcoming power into your life amen because it says in 2 Peter 3:18 but grow in grace and the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ to him be glory both now and forever amen grow in Grace let God take over your life more and more yeah amen I'm just looking for a place see see we're slowing down I'm just looking for a place to pull over okay now let's just let's just finish with these two I tell the truth in Christ I lie not there is no man that can take the doctrine that I preach and just prove it there's no one can do it I have never seen anyone can do it it's the gospel truth the discernment of the spirit is perfect no man can ever say that's never been perfect and
