[45:25] systematic Oh bless you just you feel at
[45:27] home see if this thing works are we
[45:32] ready to go here we go I'm trying
[45:36] something different
[45:38] let's go to Colossians 1:15 I have the
[45:43] Spanish too
[45:45] Colossians 1:15
[45:59] and then we're going to go to the Book
[46:02] of Isaiah it's just right here
[46:08] try Stephens had a a good week and
[46:14] Colossians 1 and 15 C so as the image of
[46:19] the invisible God the speaking of Jesus
[46:21] the firstborn of every creature
[46:22] for by him all things created that are
[46:26] in heaven and that are on earth visible
[46:28] and invisible whether they be Thrones or
[46:31] dominions or principalities or powers
[46:33] all things were created by him and for
[46:36] him and he is before all things and by
[46:38] him all things consist and he is the
[46:41] head of the body the church who is the
[46:42] beginning the firstborn from the dead
[46:44] that in all things he might have
[46:46] preeminence for a place the father that
[46:49] in him should all fullness dwell and
[46:51] having made peace through the blood of
[46:53] his cross by him to reconcile all things
[46:56] unto himself and to himself I say
[47:04] whether they be things in heaven I mean
[47:06] things and earth or things in heaven and
[47:08] you who are sometimes alienated and
[47:10] enemies in your mind by wicked works yet
[47:12] now hath he reconciled and thus and the
[47:16] body of his flesh through death to
[47:17] present you holy and unblameable and
[47:20] Unruh provable in a sight if you
[47:22] continue in the faith grounded and
[47:24] sealed and be not moved away from the
[47:26] hope of the gospel which ye have heard
[47:28] and which was preached to every creature
[47:31] which is under heaven there of where of
[47:34] I Paul am made a minister amen and let's
[47:38] just go to Isaiah Isaiah 43 and 21 this
[47:46] is a bit of a bit of a context for teeth
[47:51] Isaiah 43 and 21
[48:01] that says this people have our form for
[48:06] myself they shall show forth my praise I
[48:11] mean I trust you can say that's me that
[48:13] describes me I mean god bless you
[48:15] friends you may have your seats this
[48:16] morning so I want to talk about this
[48:20] morning I want to talk about the
[48:22] anointing and what it should produce
[48:25] because when a Spirit comes into a
[48:28] person a certain life as is manifested
[48:32] now it sees here in 1st John 2 it says
[48:36] my little children these things write I
[48:39] unto you that ye sin not and if any man
[48:41] sin wait oh I'll leave that there sorry
[48:44] I'm just this is there's a bit of an
[48:46] experiment this morning if you don't
[48:48] mind because I won't even want to
[48:52] understand
[48:53] hallelujah so I think it's worth it so
[48:55] it's just let's just fear with me you
[48:57] may learn some Spanish amen and then I
[49:00] think we're all go away but in Richland
[49:01] but let's go to first John and 2 and 1
[49:04] it says it says here hallelujah God God
[49:11] made us a certain way he formed us yeah
[49:16] he's even a bit too warm yeah so I lit
[49:19] up for the slice he getting cooked that
[49:22] one my gosh I mean I mean my goose to be
[49:24] cooked too early
[49:26] God has made us for a purpose
[49:29] he's here in 1st John 2 and 1 my little
[49:32] children these things write I unto you
[49:35] that you may send not and if any man sin
[49:38] we have an advocate with the father
[49:40] Jesus Christ the righteous and he is a
[49:42] propitiation for our sins and not our
[49:45] sins only but also for the sins of the
[49:47] whole world and hereby we do know that
[49:50] we know him if we keep his Commandments
[49:52] and he that saith I know him and keepeth
[49:55] not his Commandments as a lie and the
[49:58] truth is not in him but whoso keepeth
[50:00] his word in him verily as the love of
[50:03] God perfected we're here by know we know
[50:07] we that we are in him and he that saith
[50:10] he abideth in him ought himself also so
[50:14] to walk even
[50:15] he even as he walked this verse seven so
[50:21] I don't have it there so we should walk
[50:25] now a safe way so if we say we are in
[50:27] Christ where are new creatures in Christ
[50:29] then we should walk as he walks so we
[50:32] should live as he lived now we
[50:34] understand that doesn't mean moving to
[50:36] Israel and and and living in Galilee and
[50:38] you know you know putting on robes and
[50:41] and and and hang out with some fishermen
[50:43] and calling him their disciples and
[50:45] you're doing the things he naturally did
[50:46] but the life that was in him now then
[50:49] just stay in Jesus Christ but it went
[50:50] into his church because we know that our
[50:53] Lord Jesus as the head of the body that
[50:55] we read so we are we are the body he's
[50:58] the head and we are the rest of the body
[51:00] and through the body things are done
[51:02] that's like the brain it says they'll go
[51:07] reach over and and and pick up your
[51:09] phone now the brain can't do it it's got
[51:11] to send a signal to the hand and then
[51:13] the hand picks up the phone and then so
[51:16] everything from the brain goes into the
[51:18] body and then the body does what the
[51:19] brain wants it to do it's the same thing
[51:22] that you're the Bible says we have the
[51:24] mind of Christ
[51:25] so the same mind that was in him should
[51:26] be in us so they're mirror therefore we
[51:29] should live we should walk as he walked
[51:32] so the same life that was in him should
[51:35] be in us and so the same characteristics
[51:38] of nature he had we should have I mean I
[51:41] believe the bride the same character in
[51:43] nature he had is and is in the church is
[51:47] in the Bride of Christ in this last day
[51:48] because remember if we are if we are
[51:51] Christians today it's no longer I that
[51:54] lives it's not that's not you living
[51:56] anymore
[51:56] I pray you died one day you died to your
[51:59] old self you gave your heart completely
[52:01] to Jesus Christ you fully surrendered
[52:03] yourself and it's no longer you living
[52:05] it's him living in you I mean because to
[52:08] be to be a Christian is to be
[52:11] christ-like and the only way you can do
[52:13] that is not by trying to mimic him but
[52:16] it's his life coming into you and he is
[52:19] the Christian in you that's how we can
[52:21] that is how we can be a believer today
[52:23] as
[52:24] if he comes unto you and lives his life
[52:25] out of you and I'm so glad by the death
[52:28] of us cross he can and he does
[52:31] hallelujah and he continues to do so now
[52:35] Jesus went when he was here on earth he
[52:38] commanded his disciples to take this
[52:41] word unto Jerusalem and Samaria you're
[52:43] even to the uttermost parts of the earth
[52:45] the gospel had to be preached to every
[52:47] creature and so now he left a work for
[52:51] his disciples to do right so the book of
[52:54] X now the book of X we call up the Acts
[52:56] of the Apostles but it's actually the X
[52:59] of the Holy Spirit which is Jesus in the
[53:02] Apostles and they took that same gospel
[53:04] and then they begin to preach it
[53:06] wherever they were sent by the Spirit of
[53:07] God so God uses his body to finish his
[53:11] work upon the earth I mean God has no
[53:13] hands but your hands God has no feet on
[53:16] the earth but your feet
[53:18] God has no mouth on the earth but your
[53:20] mouth amen God has to use a body to
[53:23] finish his work hallelujah and the only
[53:26] way the only way his work can be
[53:28] finished as when God comes and dwells in
[53:30] a person and uses that person to finish
[53:33] his work because otherwise it's just
[53:35] man's idea it's just man's religion
[53:38] because it's it's it's men man is the
[53:42] boss of us now I think this is how it
[53:44] should be done the set should be done
[53:45] but if it's if it's God God leading the
[53:49] people then it's not it's not man's work
[53:51] it's God's work hallelujah so now the
[53:55] anointing the anointing will produce a
[54:00] life if we're Christians we are
[54:03] producing a life it's more than nice
[54:05] singing it's more than quoting scripture
[54:08] or quoting a prophet of God it is a life
[54:10] that is to be produced and that's what
[54:13] God is looking for he's looking for a
[54:14] people upon the earth that are just like
[54:16] him hallelujah it's just like in like in
[54:19] Leviticus I don't have it on the on the
[54:22] on the PowerPoint but they would cut
[54:24] down so so when when the when the grain
[54:27] or the week was was ripening was growing
[54:29] you know if you look at a wheat field it
[54:32] does not grow at the same rate there's
[54:34] some that's they're ready to be happy
[54:37] harvested there's some that still green
[54:39] but the events that they all come to the
[54:42] same maturity but the first part of the
[54:44] harvest - to come to maturity that would
[54:47] cut it down and that and the priest
[54:50] would waver before the God before God
[54:52] thanking God that the rest of the field
[54:54] will come to the same life the same
[54:57] maturity as the one being waived and
[54:59] it's the same thing with us now so on
[55:02] the day of Pentecost a wave sheaf was
[55:04] cut down Christ was cut down as waved
[55:06] and that life was waved over the people
[55:09] because God was giving thanks there's
[55:11] more in the field that a Kanak gonna
[55:14] come forth like him gonna come forth
[55:17] like me I'm going to produce a people
[55:19] that are exactly like this life that was
[55:21] waved over the people Alleluia amen and
[55:26] there and there was there was the woman
[55:27] at the well was in the upper room there
[55:29] was Peter James and John in the upper
[55:31] room there was Matthew the tax collector
[55:32] all different kinds of people you know
[55:35] the doubt announced the publicans and
[55:36] sinners there in the upper room and God
[55:38] waived a life over there hallelujah
[55:41] saying saying the life has been waived
[55:43] of you is going to be produced in you
[55:45] I'm in the same nature the same
[55:47] character everything he is we become by
[55:51] His grace hallelujah and it's the same
[55:54] thing this message is not a bunch of
[55:56] sermons this message is not a bunch of
[55:58] doctrines this message is a life being
[56:00] ways it's the original life being way
[56:03] and God took a redeemed son so a man
[56:06] that was born and said shake their
[56:08] iniquity come to the world speaking lies
[56:09] just like you and I and he fully
[56:11] surrendered his life to Jesus Christ and
[56:13] he was filled with the Holy Spirit and
[56:15] God manifested through that man I pray
[56:18] God make us like this not not just a
[56:21] carbon copy like we will become a little
[56:23] brother branham but the nature of the
[56:25] life that was in him which was Christ
[56:27] would be lived out
[56:28] I mean Sagarika redeemed son and he
[56:31] waved it over the people over the earth
[56:33] saying this is what I produce this is
[56:35] what Calvary produces this is what my
[56:38] blood makes hallelujah and he's showing
[56:41] us these things because he wants you to
[56:43] see oh God you'll make me like that yes
[56:46] Holloway and not the same discernment
[56:48] and the same gift here were not all
[56:50] prophets but that same life that same
[56:52] character God is looking for character
[56:55] and a people and as anointing will do it
[56:58] yes hallelujah amen so that's why when
[57:02] you when you when you when you hear the
[57:03] tapes you read the message it's a life
[57:05] just like this this is a record of a
[57:08] life from Genesis to Revelation it's a
[57:12] record of a life and it's a love letter
[57:14] to you and it's a love letter because
[57:16] the reason it's a love letter is because
[57:18] you fall in love with him and then he
[57:20] begins to show his life in this word
[57:22] hallelujah begins to show this is me
[57:25] here this is what I did here this is
[57:27] what I did with my people here this is
[57:29] what I did here this what I'll do for
[57:30] you
[57:31] hallelujah but it's because but you got
[57:33] to into and trail of relationship with
[57:36] Jesus Christ first and then it becomes
[57:38] alive otherwise it's just learning
[57:42] that's why we have it can be a very to
[57:45] injured sword we have we your the
[57:48] ministry is mature in this age and we
[57:51] have very great teaching but the problem
[57:53] is so don't get me wrong teaching makes
[57:56] it very simple but then you can just
[57:59] learn it and say well I understand it
[58:01] without the life you understand what I'm
[58:03] saying but it's so beautiful that
[58:05] teaching is so you know the right things
[58:08] you can just make I'm here like yellow
[58:09] brother Lonnie you hear him teach and
[58:11] you think why don't I never see that
[58:12] before
[58:13] it's so obvious because there's that
[58:15] teaching gift they're taking the word
[58:17] and making it plain and so anyone can
[58:20] actually actually they can understand
[58:23] what he's teaching that doesn't mean
[58:25] they have the new birth because it
[58:27] where's the life because looking for
[58:29] life no not an understanding
[58:31] yeah we don't gone to the rapture
[58:33] because we because we write a test cuz
[58:35] we write an exam that's not how it works
[58:37] but when the Spirit of Truth has come
[58:39] here lead you and guide you into all
[58:40] truth I mean he will lead you and guide
[58:43] you into all truth not just partial
[58:45] truth not just a little but the whole
[58:47] thing all truth on you glad were being
[58:50] led and guided I mean he's taking his
[58:52] word personally to you opening it up
[58:55] amen make your plane
[58:58] Laurey so he will produce a life and he
[59:01] will produce a life not you he will do
[59:04] the life he's Pete he's the life giver a
[59:08] mentor best people I've fought for
[59:09] myself I shall show forth my praise I
[59:13] mean they shall show forth my praise
[59:15] this is you this is you he has formed
[59:19] you for himself he hasn't formed you for
[59:22] anything else doesn't matter where you
[59:24] came from in this life you were formed
[59:27] your fashion you are moulded hallelujah
[59:31] you are made for him that you bring
[59:33] forth that you would show forth us
[59:35] praise hallelujah that's why it's so
[59:38] glorious
[59:39] you know whenever things get hard
[59:41] whenever things look like they're going
[59:43] sideways
[59:44] and the enemy comes in and
[59:45] misunderstandings whatever more I just
[59:47] say god you're so wonderful I just focus
[59:49] on home and how good is that's what we
[59:51] should do we should just praise Him I'm
[59:54] gonna I'm just gonna preach for a little
[59:55] bit we just give him thanks isn't he all
[59:57] together lovely isn't he all together
[59:59] wonderful I mean what he's done for you
[1:00:01] what he's done for me holy just just
[1:00:04] just to open our eyes I made a note just
[1:00:07] to look upon you know not just to maybe
[1:00:10] you're like when Jesus was here the
[1:00:12] first time many people thought he was a
[1:00:14] prophet so it's not just to look upon
[1:00:16] you so I think he's a prophet but God
[1:00:18] opens your eyes he's the Messiah
[1:00:21] hallelujah aren't you glad I mean then
[1:00:23] you see a ministry come in the end time
[1:00:25] people say oh he was a prophet he was
[1:00:27] anointed to be a prophet but then we we
[1:00:29] can see beyond the veil of the man who
[1:00:32] say there's Messiah speaking the Son of
[1:00:34] Man was in that man revealing himself
[1:00:36] and that same son of man is here Jesus
[1:00:39] Christ hallelujah I'm glad well I'm so
[1:00:43] glad we're living in this day anyway
[1:00:48] telling the people up in Papua New
[1:00:50] Guinea seven billion people on the earth
[1:00:52] and God found you here you know they
[1:00:57] they call that country the land that
[1:00:59] time forgot because a large part of the
[1:01:02] country only had first contact with the
[1:01:03] outside world in the thirties you know
[1:01:06] up in the highlands a big plateau it's
[1:01:07] like springtime where the beautiful
[1:01:09] climate and some Australians
[1:01:12] they floorplate up over there flying
[1:01:15] over these mountains they look at these
[1:01:16] all these villages most the populations
[1:01:18] up there contact first contact was in
[1:01:21] the 30s God didn't forget that place
[1:01:25] hallelujah and it's like us here we just
[1:01:28] walk we just walking around in life and
[1:01:30] doing what we think we should do and
[1:01:32] think God comes and our lives are never
[1:01:36] the same a man and why does he do that
[1:01:39] that we can show forth as praise thank
[1:01:41] you thank you Lord for saving me a trust
[1:01:44] that means something to you thank you
[1:01:46] for dying across from me Lord hallelujah
[1:01:49] now let's go to let's go to Hebrews 11
[1:01:53] and we're going to speak about Moses I'm
[1:02:03] so glad I'm so glad to be a believer it
[1:02:06] doesn't matter how bad things look
[1:02:07] doesn't matter how hard life appears to
[1:02:09] be glory a man before the first bomb
[1:02:13] drops the Prophet says we're out of here
[1:02:15] hallelujah so kim-jong whatever his name
[1:02:18] you like your bombs Trump you do it
[1:02:20] Putin you just get it ready before the
[1:02:24] first bomb drops we're gone a meaning
[1:02:27] God look won't lose one of his Alleluia
[1:02:30] so he speed six hours on the road on the
[1:02:35] road to Emmaus with two of us disciples
[1:02:38] I love Luke 24 brother BAM says modern
[1:02:42] events and made clear by prophecy he
[1:02:43] goes to Luke 24 so she's what you see
[1:02:46] among you what you see these modern RVs
[1:02:48] 2017 are made clear by the prophecy and
[1:02:51] he's telling us you're in the
[1:02:52] resurrection Jesus is here you may not
[1:02:55] fully comprehend it's him but he walks
[1:02:57] with you see this is the main event I
[1:03:00] thought about you know it's not about
[1:03:01] you know here it and and what the Romans
[1:03:04] are doing and what the Greeks are doing
[1:03:05] and you know what the other world powers
[1:03:07] think they're doing in the and and the
[1:03:09] Jews wanting to start a revolt and you
[1:03:12] know it's not about all those things
[1:03:14] that were going on the main event is
[1:03:16] Jesus walking with his children and he
[1:03:19] was and he spent six hours walking with
[1:03:21] them because he wanted them to know
[1:03:22] beyond a shadow of a doubt the
[1:03:24] as me I'm fulfilling my word and you're
[1:03:27] part of my fulfillment you're part of
[1:03:29] the prophecy being fulfilled
[1:03:30] hallelujah because they member they had
[1:03:33] to go to the upper room hello sorry he
[1:03:36] wasn't just giving them information that
[1:03:38] they'd say oh that's nice no he walked
[1:03:41] with them to tell them you're part of
[1:03:43] this fulfillment you're part of the
[1:03:44] prophecy being fulfilled and that's the
[1:03:46] most glorious thing Jesus is walking
[1:03:48] with us does he walk with you he walks
[1:03:52] with you and he opens his word to you
[1:03:54] doesn't matter how you feel they would
[1:03:56] they were sad they weren't rejoicing
[1:03:58] skipping on the way to Emmaus I'm so
[1:04:01] glad to be a believer today oh yeah the
[1:04:04] Messiah was dead you know the church
[1:04:06] accountant we didn't hang himself the
[1:04:08] ministry was locked away someplace their
[1:04:11] world fell apart and here he comes he
[1:04:15] opens his word he said life isn't all
[1:04:19] that peachy but urine because you're
[1:04:21] fulfilling that glory amen amen
[1:04:27] so let's go to Hebrews 11 23 it's by
[1:04:32] faith Moses when he was born he was hid
[1:04:37] three months of his parents because they
[1:04:39] saw he was a proper child and they were
[1:04:42] not afraid of the Kings commandment and
[1:04:44] by faith Moses when he was come to years
[1:04:48] refused to be called the son of
[1:04:50] Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to
[1:04:52] suffer affliction with the people of God
[1:04:55] than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a
[1:04:58] season amen choosing rather to suffer
[1:05:02] affliction with the people of God I'm
[1:05:04] just going to read this again then to
[1:05:07] enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season
[1:05:08] esteeming the reproach of Christ greater
[1:05:11] riches than the treasures in Egypt for
[1:05:14] he had respect unto the recompense of
[1:05:16] the reward by faith he forsook Egypt not
[1:05:20] fearing the wrath of the king for he
[1:05:23] endured as seeing him who is invisible
[1:05:31] so now here here's a man here's a man
[1:05:35] Moses you know who knows the story
[1:05:37] the story of Moses he has raised by
[1:05:40] Pharaoh's daughter he was he was his he
[1:05:43] was the next in line he could have been
[1:05:45] fairer if he wanted to be and that was a
[1:05:48] superpower of the age but he preferred
[1:05:54] he thought the reproach of Christ was
[1:05:57] greater riches than being absolute a god
[1:06:03] over a nation because the Pharaoh was
[1:06:07] God in that day he wasn't just a king he
[1:06:09] was a god what he said went absolute
[1:06:12] absolute control he could speak a word
[1:06:15] and and people would be wiped out he
[1:06:18] esteemed Moses now esteemed a shepherd
[1:06:21] stick two million people whatever a
[1:06:24] million people he took in the wilderness
[1:06:26] all the hardship all of the strife and
[1:06:29] the things that happened there in the
[1:06:32] wilderness he esteem that greater riches
[1:06:36] he would rather follow God then be be a
[1:06:42] God of a of a country now he followed
[1:06:47] Christ sees we just read that he
[1:06:49] followed Christ and now this this did
[1:06:53] something to him a life was manifested a
[1:06:56] life was manifested now I said that he
[1:07:01] was he could have been the next Pharaoh
[1:07:05] now if you have a so if a man embodies
[1:07:10] of God upon the earth what is he not
[1:07:14] yo what does he normally like he's not
[1:07:16] like a meek little lonely guy he's not a
[1:07:19] little humble person ever a real persona
[1:07:21] about him I'm invincible I can do what I
[1:07:24] want you know he'd have that kind of
[1:07:26] persona and he would have been raised
[1:07:28] that way because the royalty or not see
[1:07:31] this probably a few times before but the
[1:07:33] royalty and that day were the leaders of
[1:07:35] the army they were the gods of war now
[1:07:39] that's what Egypt produced in him but
[1:07:43] then he went forty years on the backside
[1:07:44] that it is it but that wasn't it it was
[1:07:48] God speaking out of a burning bush
[1:07:50] the anointing came his way God Himself
[1:07:53] came his way and he began to speak out
[1:07:55] of a burning bush and it changed his
[1:07:57] nature and then he went to Mount Sinai
[1:08:00] and God came down on the mountain and
[1:08:02] God began to reveal his word to his
[1:08:04] prophet and it produced a character in
[1:08:08] him so he went from being he a prince of
[1:08:14] Egypt to the most meekest man in all
[1:08:18] view now this this is what was produced
[1:08:25] by him being the Prince of the burning
[1:08:26] bush this is the character of Christ
[1:08:29] being made in a person under the blood
[1:08:32] of bulls and goats as well not even
[1:08:34] under the blood of Jesus Christ but he
[1:08:36] but because he walked with God he was
[1:08:38] made the meekest man in all the earth
[1:08:40] it produced a character in him the
[1:08:43] scribes and Pharisees read the same
[1:08:45] words they read the words Moses wrote
[1:08:47] down they were proud arrogant people
[1:08:50] what so what does that mean they they
[1:08:53] they received it in here and they wanted
[1:08:56] to be the big shots and they wanted to
[1:08:57] be the up and ups they wanted to be the
[1:09:00] big names among the congregation why is
[1:09:04] that because they learnt the message
[1:09:05] they were message believers the message
[1:09:07] of Moses we have Moses as their prophet
[1:09:09] we got his tapes we've got his books I
[1:09:12] do you what's it making what's it making
[1:09:16] in you because because the the prophet
[1:09:19] that the message came to on that day
[1:09:20] this is the character that was made
[1:09:23] that's the character that was made now
[1:09:26] this is an attribute of Christ's
[1:09:27] character being made flesh in a person
[1:09:30] by the anointing now how about you let's
[1:09:38] go to let's go to Matthew 1
[1:09:47] girls looking for a life Matthew 1 & 18
[1:10:01] down to verse 25 that says now the booth
[1:10:09] of Jesus Christ was on this wise
[1:10:12] weenus his mother Mary was espoused to
[1:10:14] Joseph before they came together she was
[1:10:17] found with child of the Holy Ghost
[1:10:19] when Joseph her husband being a just man
[1:10:21] and not willing to make a public make
[1:10:24] her a public example was minded to put
[1:10:26] her away properly but while he thought
[1:10:29] on these things behold the angel of the
[1:10:32] Lord appeared unto Him in a dream saying
[1:10:34] Joseph thou son of David fear not to
[1:10:37] take unto thee Mary thy wife for that
[1:10:39] which is conceived of her is the Holy
[1:10:41] Ghost and she shall bring forth a son
[1:10:44] and thou shalt call his name Jesus for
[1:10:45] he shall save his people from their sins
[1:10:47] now all of us was done that it might be
[1:10:50] fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord
[1:10:53] by the Prophet saying behold a virgin
[1:10:56] shall be with child and shall bring for
[1:10:58] the son and they shall call his name
[1:11:00] Emmanuel which being interpreted is God
[1:11:03] with us then Joseph being raised from
[1:11:05] sleep that as the angel of the Lord had
[1:11:07] bettered him and took unto him his wife
[1:11:09] and you heard not till she had brought
[1:11:11] forth her firstborn son and he called
[1:11:13] his name Jesus now this is all done it
[1:11:20] says in verse 22 now all this was done
[1:11:25] that it might be fulfilled with just
[1:11:26] spoken of the Lord by the Prophet so
[1:11:29] jesus becoming flesh God becoming flesh
[1:11:33] in a man I mean yo as a man was a
[1:11:36] fulfillment of a prophets word so a
[1:11:39] prophet prophesied and then it produced
[1:11:42] to life amen are you following me
[1:11:45] so there was a fulfillment of a prophets
[1:11:48] word and it produced a life now here we
[1:11:51] are now don't think I'm jumping way off
[1:11:54] and to suddenly feel someplace in there
[1:11:56] sports crowd but here we are now a
[1:12:00] prophet Isaiah prophesied many
[1:12:02] prophesied of Jesus coming and it
[1:12:05] produced a life as our Messiah
[1:12:08] now we've had a prophet stand and he
[1:12:10] said there's been brides Brides churches
[1:12:12] churches but there's got to come one and
[1:12:14] he speaks about she'll be she is him
[1:12:17] they you know they become one flesh
[1:12:20] Christ and his bride become one flesh
[1:12:22] that he says she is him that doesn't
[1:12:25] mean we become Jesus but it's because
[1:12:27] everything here is we become and I mean
[1:12:30] that our identity we are not I am NOT
[1:12:32] mr. Benjamin John glory
[1:12:35] that's not me real you know the world
[1:12:37] knows me is that but in reality my real
[1:12:39] identification as I'm mrs. Jesus Christ
[1:12:42] a man by his death burial resurrection I
[1:12:44] am mrs. Jesus Christ and that's what we
[1:12:47] are by one spirit we're baptized into
[1:12:49] one body Alleluia and he says that the
[1:12:53] two will become one speaking of husband
[1:12:55] and wife and this is the mystery of
[1:12:56] Christ and His Church hallelujah so so
[1:12:59] he begins to speak about the invisible
[1:13:01] Union and the choosing of a bride and
[1:13:03] different and different sermons and it's
[1:13:05] not to make us laugh or angry mad or sad
[1:13:07] but he's actually declaring something
[1:13:09] this is what the bride will be like this
[1:13:11] is the one he's choosing this is the one
[1:13:15] he's choosing and you happen just to
[1:13:17] find yourself to fit the criteria not by
[1:13:22] anything you've done you know yeah
[1:13:26] do you know what I mean that's like
[1:13:28] you're just walking along yes I David it
[1:13:31] hits Goliath
[1:13:32] bring me a man to fight the battle and
[1:13:35] God up in heaven I don't know how it
[1:13:37] each looking down said I will I'll bring
[1:13:40] you a man that fits the criteria of the
[1:13:42] person you're looking for Goliath and he
[1:13:44] brings a little shepherd boy bring me a
[1:13:46] man and he took God God says in Isaiah
[1:13:50] heaviness
[1:13:51] you know heaven is my throne the earth
[1:13:54] is my footstool what where is the place
[1:13:55] of my rest so he's saying basically
[1:13:58] bring me a place of my rest and here you
[1:14:01] are and God forms you a certain way I'm
[1:14:05] old you because he put up a seed in you
[1:14:08] before the foundation of the world
[1:14:10] and you find yourself hearing his word
[1:14:12] and something then you just says I fit
[1:14:14] that criteria by its grace I fit that
[1:14:17] criteria I'm the one you're looking for
[1:14:20] hallelujah you following me
[1:14:24] I read the Solomon bride books and at
[1:14:28] the end of reading those books I just
[1:14:29] think god I'm your shunammite hallelujah
[1:14:32] I'm the one you're looking for yeah
[1:14:35] that's what I got out of those books
[1:14:37] I'm your shunammite Holly I'm your bride
[1:14:40] you're looking for and in Solomon
[1:14:42] couldn't find it in the different ones
[1:14:44] but he found it in a half Gentile glory
[1:14:46] hallelujah you know you know and and one
[1:14:50] that the Israel wouldn't think would fit
[1:14:52] the criteria and here she is a man have
[1:14:56] you read those books you know what I
[1:14:58] mean glory I love it don't you
[1:15:02] you find yourself reading the word now
[1:15:04] maybe this is justice not just me and
[1:15:06] you read about all the precious promises
[1:15:08] and what he's done and you know the
[1:15:09] nature the other divine nature and all
[1:15:11] these things and you just begin to say
[1:15:13] Lord you're making me this Lord you're
[1:15:15] doing this working me you're molding
[1:15:17] mean I'm not a vessel of this sort this
[1:15:19] honor I'm a vessel of Honor amen and you
[1:15:22] found you found out of the muck and mire
[1:15:24] and you picked it up and you've washed
[1:15:25] it and slide it up you put it on your
[1:15:27] table hallelujah and then everything he
[1:15:30] poured into Christ he pours into me
[1:15:31] he pours into us church now let me I
[1:15:35] just find myself I find myself in that
[1:15:37] number and predestinated to meet the
[1:15:40] Lord I just find myself here you ask oh
[1:15:42] how did this work out well it's because
[1:15:44] he was guiding us and directing us and
[1:15:46] leading us and then you begun to realize
[1:15:48] this is why I went through these things
[1:15:50] that's why I hid this word this is why
[1:15:53] maybe Arthur scarves in the churches I
[1:15:54] was in and I wanted more is a deep
[1:15:57] calling to the deep yes hallelujah
[1:16:00] so the words of the Prophet produced God
[1:16:04] inspired them to prophesy to us God
[1:16:06] speaking saying this is what's going to
[1:16:08] be producer God fulfilled the word of
[1:16:10] the Prophet to produce Jesus Christ and
[1:16:13] God will fulfill the words of Malachi 4
[1:16:16] to produce a bride and you've got
[1:16:18] actually comes the realization we are we
[1:16:20] have been made in as image we are one of
[1:16:23] them
[1:16:23] don't put it off way off in the future
[1:16:26] don't put it way off in the future you
[1:16:30] say well I have my battles of my
[1:16:31] struggles but are you growing in him
[1:16:33] hey going in grace is their life that's
[1:16:36] like you know when you have little
[1:16:38] children and they in them they want to
[1:16:41] walk and them they want to speak and
[1:16:42] them they want to do things that adults
[1:16:44] do but they may be too young they get
[1:16:48] frustrated yeah how our youngest she
[1:16:52] used to get so fishy she wanted to speak
[1:16:54] and she gets her angry because he had
[1:16:56] words and it was in here but she
[1:16:58] couldn't get it out but then who was I
[1:17:00] want to speak I want to walk I want to
[1:17:01] play I want to you know so if it because
[1:17:04] there's the life in there she'll she
[1:17:07] will become an adult we can't stop her
[1:17:10] becoming an adult keep feeding her and
[1:17:13] she just keeps living and eventually if
[1:17:15] the little terror she'll be yay big plus
[1:17:18] or minus summit somewhere in here but
[1:17:21] she'll be a fully formed mature adult
[1:17:23] because she's feeding she's drinking and
[1:17:27] she's feeding it's the same thing with
[1:17:29] you and I we may be just a newborn baby
[1:17:31] babe in Christ but there's a desire I
[1:17:34] want to walk with you Lord I want to
[1:17:36] speak of you I wanna you know I wanna I
[1:17:39] want to run I don't just wanna I don't
[1:17:41] just want to crawl I want to run it was
[1:17:46] still good and so as long as that life
[1:17:49] is in there it'll grow just feed it on
[1:17:52] the right things
[1:17:53] how's your diet you got to feed on
[1:17:56] spiritual things
[1:17:57] I mean feed on the word and it produces
[1:18:01] the Holy Spirit takes that wind it
[1:18:03] produces a life just drink and push out
[1:18:08] like a plant they drink the water they
[1:18:10] push out a limb and then fruit comes out
[1:18:12] hallelujah now where we go now this is
[1:18:20] the whys mean the whys means sort of
[1:18:24] star on the east they traveled west and
[1:18:29] they followed the star to find where
[1:18:32] Christ was in their day now I only put
[1:18:36] the scripture in here but you can read
[1:18:37] the whole
[1:18:37] chapter they go to Jerusalem Jerusalem
[1:18:40] has no idea what's going on the church
[1:18:41] world has no idea what's going on but
[1:18:44] they had seen the star
[1:18:45] you're the star that rose was actually a
[1:18:48] prophecy one of Balaam prophecies in the
[1:18:50] Book of Numbers a star would rise out of
[1:18:52] Jacob and brother Bram says that these
[1:18:55] wise men in the east they were trained
[1:18:56] by Daniel yeah they're there for peace
[1:18:59] were trained by Daniel because he taught
[1:19:01] them all the wisdom that the they had so
[1:19:03] that's why the wise men when they saw
[1:19:05] the star rise they looked in the
[1:19:07] scripture and they read Balaam's
[1:19:10] prophecy star would rise out of Jacob
[1:19:12] you read numbers 20 to 25 it's when one
[1:19:14] of his prophecies and they read that and
[1:19:17] they realized the king of the Jews is
[1:19:19] being born this is a fulfillment of that
[1:19:21] prophecy so they begin to follow the
[1:19:23] star and it says when they go to gone to
[1:19:27] Jerusalem they have no idea what's going
[1:19:28] on
[1:19:28] what do you mean the words fulfilled
[1:19:30] today what do you mean this and thus
[1:19:31] America foreign relations even an

[1:19:49] inheritance glory to God and what is the
[1:19:51] fullness of our inheritance is the
[1:19:52] adoption to wit the change of the body
[1:19:54] and we are on our way oh yeah and
[1:19:58] nothing just keep walking with him just

[1:20:26] a great seat just yes enjoy isn't he
[1:20:28] lovely isn't he wonderful
[1:20:30] so now but they had a revelation when
[1:20:35] they found him and when they had heard
[1:20:38] so they went back so they came out of
[1:20:42] Jerusalem they follow the star family
[1:20:45] the young child was now that a
[1:20:47] revelation they they brought him gifts
[1:20:50] so it says and when they
[1:20:51] coming to the house they saw the young
[1:20:53] child with Mary his mother and fell down
[1:20:55] and worshiped him and when they had
[1:20:57] opened their treasures they presented
[1:20:58] unto Him gifts gold frankincense and
[1:21:01] myrrh so they had a revelation now this
[1:21:04] is what the anointing when the anointing
[1:21:06] becomes flesh this is what it will
[1:21:07] produce and this is what these gifts a
[1:21:10] signifier gold gold frankincense and
[1:21:14] myrrh now this is from God's gifts
[1:21:17] always find me a place in 63 jehovah he
[1:21:20] is deity and he became a child he became
[1:21:23] in the form of sin that he might redeem
[1:21:25] the sinner so that's me and you Claire
[1:21:28] yeah I put I always put myself in these
[1:21:31] quotes I got redeemed you read between
[1:21:35] the lines I've been redeemed
[1:21:37] hallelujah that he might redeem the
[1:21:39] sinner well he has Here I am I've been
[1:21:41] redeemed
[1:21:42] Allu you see there's the whole thing now
[1:21:45] look how beautiful those gifts foot into
[1:21:46] Jesus Christ see gold speaks of his
[1:21:48] deity
[1:21:50] now they wasn't he the heathens they're
[1:21:52] inspired by God there wasn't imagining
[1:21:55] something that proves right there even
[1:21:57] the Magi that they did see the
[1:21:59] supernatural because their own gift what
[1:22:02] they offered identified and spoke well
[1:22:04] of their testimony
[1:22:05] that they did see the supernatural
[1:22:07] lights because why it speaks perfectly
[1:22:09] they brought gold deity they brought
[1:22:12] frankincense which is service and they
[1:22:14] brought murder for his death when he was
[1:22:17] a baby see even as a baby that a
[1:22:18] revelation this is the reason he's come
[1:22:20] amen that he would be showing that deity
[1:22:23] would be put to death in the flesh that
[1:22:25] he might redeem fallen man Ilia so gulf
[1:22:29] deity so God put into service to die for
[1:22:34] you and I they had a revelation friends
[1:22:37] they saw a stock coming out something
[1:22:39] inspired them what are we going to take
[1:22:40] to this King gold frankincense and myrrh
[1:22:42] I mean let's go they they had more clue
[1:22:46] of what's going on then the church world
[1:22:48] did hallelujah I tell you what
[1:22:52] the star in every age will lead you to
[1:22:55] where Christ is the star and every age
[1:22:57] will lead you and that's why we've seen
[1:22:59] a messenger come which is the start of
[1:23:01] the age and if you follow that star
[1:23:03] he'll point you to where Christ
[1:23:05] in his wood in this hour hallelujah and
[1:23:07] you will have a revelation this is what
[1:23:09] the anointing is to do in this hour a
[1:23:11] man it should make you into his image
[1:23:13] wholly to take you in a rapture
[1:23:15] hallelujah
[1:23:16] isn't it glorious I mean this is this is
[1:23:19] what the star will do so don't get about
[1:23:22] then you go on YouTube see but what if
[1:23:25] you go back into Jerusalem the church
[1:23:26] world that's all confusion what do you
[1:23:29] mean a star where's it mean to be born
[1:23:30] what's going on what are these people
[1:23:32] doing coming from afar with these gifts
[1:23:34] and saying where is he born King of the
[1:23:36] Jews
[1:23:36] they should have had a sign I'm not
[1:23:39] saying this is a joke but they should
[1:23:41] have had a sign on me on the gate of
[1:23:43] Jerusalem if you're looking for the King
[1:23:45] of the Jews go this way to Bethlehem
[1:23:46] you'll find him in a manger because
[1:23:48] that's where the Scripture city would be
[1:23:49] born but they had no idea to keep
[1:23:53] following the star children I trust you
[1:23:57] heaven you found him born hallelujah but
[1:24:00] it because it's not a baby in a manger
[1:24:01] now he's the resurrected Jesus Christ
[1:24:03] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:24:05] yeah now let's go to it so this is this
[1:24:10] is Paul speaking maybe I'll put this in
[1:24:12] the wrong place but he says I'm
[1:24:13] crucified with Christ nevertheless I
[1:24:15] live not yet i but Christ liveth in me
[1:24:19] and the life which I now live in the
[1:24:22] flesh I live by the faith of the Son of
[1:24:24] God who loved me and gave himself for me
[1:24:27] so now because we River
[1:24:29] Christ the fullness of the Godhead
[1:24:30] bodily was in Jesus Christ the Bible
[1:24:32] tells us but it doesn't just end up
[1:24:34] there then he emptied himself into his
[1:24:36] church amen he said in the last days
[1:24:38] I'll pour my spirit out upon all flesh
[1:24:41] hallelujah and that and we fit in that
[1:24:44] category
[1:24:45] amen yeah you know you're the prophecy
[1:24:47] of Joel doesn't matter about all the
[1:24:49] false souls out there is genuine dollars
[1:24:51] there's genuine believers and it'll
[1:24:54] produce a genuine life and so he's
[1:24:57] saying now I don't live pull saying I
[1:24:59] don't live anymore Christ lives in me
[1:25:01] amen so that and the life I now live I
[1:25:04] live by the faith of the Son of God so
[1:25:07] it's not his own faith anymore it's
[1:25:08] God's faith God's own faith in Him
[1:25:11] hallelujah now this is part of the this
[1:25:15] is what the
[1:25:17] and nothing should produce in us brother
[1:25:20] Bram never did away with this after the
[1:25:23] Lord said it's actually recognizing the
[1:25:24] wood for your own he never did away with
[1:25:26] this this is still part of the evidence
[1:25:28] of the Holy Ghost it's still part of it
[1:25:31] you can't take away from the work so
[1:25:34] this is what they this is what the
[1:25:35] anointing will produce in a life when
[1:25:38] God is in a person you will have love
[1:25:41] don't you love them as an amazing isn't
[1:25:43] it isn't it great that the principal one
[1:25:45] he puts first as love I mean because if
[1:25:48] you have love you will have joy as any
[1:25:51] wonderful doesn t make you happy when
[1:25:53] you think about them this is not just
[1:25:55] some mental gymnastics you think yes
[1:25:57] like you think about your spouse and how
[1:25:59] wonderful they are how much they mean to
[1:26:01] you doesn't that give you joy hallelujah
[1:26:04] and now doesn't that give you peace
[1:26:07] because you're thinking about your
[1:26:09] relationship doesn't he want yo you just
[1:26:12] think about the Lord don't you love him
[1:26:14] doesn't he make you happy I mean living
[1:26:18] he loved me dying he saved me buried he
[1:26:20] carried my sins far away rising
[1:26:21] justified freely forever one day is
[1:26:24] coming oh glorious day or half of the
[1:26:25] song goes you know doesn't that give you
[1:26:28] joy hallelujah one day that didn't
[1:26:31] Christ arise and it's done and I'm off
[1:26:34] Allu you are you afraid I'm not afraid
[1:26:37] why not because I love them and it's not
[1:26:43] a human love is a divine love it should
[1:26:46] be God the love of God in your heart
[1:26:48] I trust you love them and it gives you
[1:26:52] joy now that also gives you peace
[1:26:54] because if he took care of your son did
[1:26:57] Annie Annie made Calvary more than a
[1:27:00] story but a reality to you that's why
[1:27:02] people get so burdened with their sins
[1:27:04] and they want to you know because God is
[1:27:06] actually telling them I died for you
[1:27:07] I poured my life out upon the earth to
[1:27:10] redeem you hallelujah now if you have
[1:27:14] that now does that not give you long
[1:27:16] suffering for others I'm just breaking
[1:27:19] this down but doesn't it give you long
[1:27:21] suffering for others because if he loved
[1:27:23] you when you did not deserve it
[1:27:24] none of us deserved it and that gives
[1:27:27] you joy and you know he's in control of
[1:27:29] everything
[1:27:31] doesn't that give us long-suffering if
[1:27:32] people do all kinds of crazy stuff and
[1:27:34] you wonder where they go you can bear
[1:27:36] with them and lift them up in prayer and
[1:27:38] just continue with them but then also
[1:27:41] doesn't that give you gentleness amen
[1:27:44] Moses was the meekest man in all the
[1:27:46] world doesn't it make you gentle because
[1:27:49] we know that this is all his doing and
[1:27:53] he sovereignly chose you 7 billion
[1:27:56] people in the world yet he chose you
[1:27:58] what about the other 6 point whatever
[1:28:00] billion people that were upon the earth
[1:28:03] any but that day he found you amen
[1:28:08] doesn't that make it and goodness and
[1:28:10] faith doesn't doesn't this just this
[1:28:13] just love love and faith actually I like
[1:28:17] husband and wife because love actually
[1:28:20] produces faith in him amen and faith in
[1:28:23] him produces love Alleluia that's chosen
[1:28:28] as the that's why so isn't he wonderful
[1:28:29] I'm not just trying to make you think of
[1:28:31] some emotion but is he really wonderful
[1:28:33] to you doesn't he glorious I mean
[1:28:35] meekness temperance against such there
[1:28:37] is no law hallelujah I'm so glad and and
[1:28:42] the beautiful thing about these is we
[1:28:43] don't have a five-point plan now I've
[1:28:46] got a 12-week I'm in training for 12
[1:28:48] weeks so I need to produce some more
[1:28:50] gentleness we don't have that a sheep
[1:28:53] biers wool sheep life is like an apple
[1:28:57] tree it grows apples or an orange tree
[1:29:01] grows oranges that olive tree grows
[1:29:03] olives it doesn't have a meeting okay
[1:29:05] it's springtime now let's have a meeting
[1:29:07] in the orchard now we need to up up our
[1:29:10] quota of olives
[1:29:11] we're a 10 behind come on boys we can do
[1:29:14] it yeah this year and this is what we're
[1:29:15] gonna do know it just lives and absorbs
[1:29:18] the sunlight through its leaves drinks
[1:29:20] and new trees in the water through its
[1:29:22] roots hallelujah yes praise to God and
[1:29:25] it produces olives okay hello olive
[1:29:30] trees I know that's not you just gotta
[1:29:32] just relax
[1:29:33] it doesn't mean you just don't care
[1:29:36] about God and wanting to serve it you
[1:29:37] know just just just go loose but you
[1:29:40] just yield and let him live
[1:29:43] yield and let him love amen now let's go
[1:29:49] to Exodus 30 I heard a brother preach on
[1:29:51] a bit of this and it blessed me so
[1:29:53] there's got Exodus 30 in 22 they're
[1:29:56] speaking me of the anointing oil how we
[1:30:03] done we're gonna write extra 30 in 20 -
[1:30:08] oh wait there we go
[1:30:16] XS 13 22 I'm gonna read down to 31
[1:30:25] okay so moreover now there's a reason
[1:30:30] you know in the Old Testament they
[1:30:31] didn't just it's not a haphazard thing
[1:30:33] why certain things will mix with certain
[1:30:35] things and things were made a certain
[1:30:36] way God's showing something to you God's
[1:30:39] showing something so moreover the Lord
[1:30:42] spake unto Moses saying take thou also
[1:30:46] under the principal spices of pure myrrh
[1:30:50] 500 shekels and of sweet cinnamon half
[1:30:53] so much even two hundred and fifty
[1:30:55] shekels and of sweet calamus two hundred
[1:31:00] and fifty shekels and cassia five
[1:31:02] hundred shekels
[1:31:03] after the shekel of the sanctuary
[1:31:06] firming and four end of oil olive and
[1:31:10] him and thou shalt make it in an oil of
[1:31:15] holy ointment and ointments compound
[1:31:18] after the art of the apothecary it shall
[1:31:21] be a holy anointing oil and thou shalt
[1:31:24] anoint the tabernacle of the
[1:31:25] congregation where with and the Ark of
[1:31:28] the testimony and the table and all his
[1:31:30] vessels and the candlestick and as
[1:31:32] vessels and the altar of incense and the
[1:31:35] altar of burnt offerings and all his
[1:31:37] vessels and the lover and his foot and
[1:31:39] thou shalt sanctify that that they be
[1:31:43] most holy whatever touches them shall be
[1:31:46] holy and thou shalt anoint Aaron and his
[1:31:48] sons and consecrate them that they made
[1:31:51] minister unto me the priests office and
[1:31:54] thou shalt speak
[1:31:56] the children of Israel saying this shall
[1:31:58] be a holy anointing oil unto me
[1:32:00] throughout your generations so now
[1:32:04] notice everything got anointed by this
[1:32:07] anointing oil so everything had to be
[1:32:10] anointed not just the not just the
[1:32:12] priesthood but every every implement
[1:32:15] used in the worship now there's a reason
[1:32:20] why I don't have this on here but
[1:32:23] there's a reason why the mixture of the
[1:32:27] anointing oil in the beginning has has
[1:32:31] this mixture of different spices now
[1:32:36] this is showing this is what happens
[1:32:38] when you get anointed something happens
[1:32:40] to you that produces something me but we
[1:32:41] are kings and priests to God right so we
[1:32:44] are royal priesthood a holy generation
[1:32:47] amen so this is this is what we are so
[1:32:49] now it says so thou shalt make under the
[1:32:52] principles so we're back to back to
[1:32:53] verse 23 again take now also under the
[1:32:57] principle spices pure myrrh 500 shekels
[1:33:00] now mirror we understand speaks of
[1:33:04] bitterness there's a bitterness in the
[1:33:07] Christian walk whether we like not there
[1:33:10] is a bitterness a mint associated with
[1:33:14] it but it's not all bitter and this
[1:33:18] actually doesn't mean to me this does
[1:33:19] not mean it's better to keep his word
[1:33:21] because those that love him it's a joy I
[1:33:23] mean to walk with him according to his
[1:33:25] word but it's how the believer can get
[1:33:28] treated and be despised actually looked
[1:33:31] down upon thought less of I mean because
[1:33:35] yes like Jesus he died with a broken
[1:33:37] heart on Calvary where the blood and the
[1:33:39] water separated when they when the
[1:33:41] soldier pierced him in the side with the
[1:33:42] spear as his blood and water came out of
[1:33:45] his side and that speaks of a broken
[1:33:47] heart so it wasn't you know it was the
[1:33:49] scourging and the beating and the
[1:33:50] whippings and everything else the crowd
[1:33:52] thorns but when he died he had a broken
[1:33:54] heart what this and there's bitterness
[1:33:56] is sadness associated because he came to
[1:33:58] his own and his own received him not
[1:34:00] Here I am I'm your Messiah I can make
[1:34:04] everything fine this is a greater than
[1:34:06] Solomon is here and they had a they had
[1:34:09] like an immature million
[1:34:10] and the first part of Solomon's rule
[1:34:12] peace was in the nation all the
[1:34:15] neighbors around them fear them fit yoyo
[1:34:18] feared feared God everything they had
[1:34:20] peace he sees a greater than Solomon is
[1:34:22] here
[1:34:22] it's imagine if you know we know they
[1:34:25] had to reject him that we would come in
[1:34:26] but imagine if they actually rallied
[1:34:27] around this is the Messiah and the high
[1:34:30] priest takes up as vestments and puts it
[1:34:31] on puts it on our Lord Jesus says you
[1:34:34] you're a high priest you're our King
[1:34:36] you're our Messiah they really around
[1:34:37] the gift imagine what would have
[1:34:38] happened ou would have been a glorious
[1:34:41] time but they had to reject him that we
[1:34:44] could come him I'm so thankful Lord
[1:34:46] because we were not even part of the
[1:34:49] economy of God we weren't even in his
[1:34:51] agreement amen no so it's five hundred
[1:34:58] shekels of that and of sweet cinnamon
[1:35:01] half as much that's two hundred fifty
[1:35:03] shekels now cinnamon so it means to
[1:35:09] erect so people begin to stand up and
[1:35:13] then calamus if you're still there two
[1:35:18] hundred and fifty shekels as well now
[1:35:22] that so that so that actually means a
[1:35:25] reed as erect or to a resemblance a rod
[1:35:28] especially for measuring so now this is
[1:35:32] this is what God is going to make an
[1:35:33] appeal there's going to be bitterness
[1:35:35] but they're going to be standing up I
[1:35:38] mean they're gonna be they're gonna be
[1:35:40] this way and then now we have cinnamon
[1:35:46] now I'm gonna make sure I got this right
[1:35:47] here oh and also calamus sorry the the
[1:35:52] meaning of the root word it means to
[1:35:55] create so it means to erect that is
[1:35:58] create by extension to procure
[1:36:01] especially by purchase so God's actually
[1:36:04] sag now I purchased these ones these
[1:36:06] ones who have been anointed with my
[1:36:08] anointing oil they're standing up on
[1:36:10] their feet they're not beaten down by
[1:36:11] the enemy and I've purchased them Jesus
[1:36:14] purchased us on Calvary's tree I mean he
[1:36:16] paid the ransom hallelujah he paid a
[1:36:19] debt we could not pay I mean we couldn't
[1:36:23] couldn't pay it at all he came I'm gonna
[1:36:26] rent some these ones I'm gonna make no
[1:36:27] royal priesthood Dean offer praises and
[1:36:30] worship to me hallelujah amen so now we
[1:36:33] have we have been purchased and then now
[1:36:38] cassia 500 shekels
[1:36:40] since the twice as much as the twice as
[1:36:42] much as the myrrh I mean no the same
[1:36:45] amount so as the moon that's it so now
[1:36:47] the the meaning of this it means so the
[1:36:52] root of us means to to contract or bend
[1:36:55] the body or neck in indifference so to
[1:36:59] show yielding when you bend the neck
[1:37:01] when you bow to someone you're actually
[1:37:03] giving them honor so here's the people
[1:37:05] now who have been now this is what it
[1:37:08] will produce in your life right you will
[1:37:11] you will be standing up we're not a
[1:37:12] downtrodden people
[1:37:13] we're victorious are we not we have the
[1:37:16] victory through Christ Jesus our Lord
[1:37:18] we're more than conquerors what is what
[1:37:21] is a more than a conqueror it means it's
[1:37:22] just a complete absolute victory it
[1:37:25] wasn't a close-run thing we just wiped
[1:37:27] them out hallelujah
[1:37:28] because we're more than conquerors
[1:37:30] through him it's not you and your what
[1:37:33] do you think you can do
[1:37:33] Oh Lord you're the captain of the host
[1:37:36] you're in charge of this battle you
[1:37:38] fight you help me Lord fight my battle
[1:37:40] for me I mean it's the ghost of the king
[1:37:42] she's in the middle of a battle her life
[1:37:45] and her life her people are in jeopardy
[1:37:46] she doesn't say cuz I think she could
[1:37:49] have she could have said to the maybe
[1:37:51] the palace guards get your swords go to
[1:37:53] havens house we're gonna deal with this
[1:37:54] she may have could have done it I don't
[1:37:56] know but she went to the one who would
[1:37:58] fight the battle for her o my king my
[1:38:00] husband my lord amen
[1:38:03] you know the rest of the story don't you
[1:38:04] and then his wrath is turned against
[1:38:06] Haman and there's a victory a me because
[1:38:10] he fought the battle for her Alleluia
[1:38:13] aren't you glad now so it means what and
[1:38:17] then also olive oil is - it's a and
[1:38:22] after a shekel of the century and an
[1:38:24] olive oil and an him so olive oil it
[1:38:29] means so as yielding illuminating oil so
[1:38:35] it gives light
[1:38:36] hallelujah so now now Paul he took a
[1:38:40] scripture that was attributed to Jesus
[1:38:42] they see is that weird be a light to the
[1:38:43] Gentiles and Jesus was the lights of the
[1:38:46] Gentiles and Paul was as well because
[1:38:48] the same life and Jesus came in - Paul
[1:38:50] have you were in the book of X pulse it
[1:38:52] would be a light to the Gentiles because
[1:38:53] he was anointed with this anointing oil
[1:38:55] to give light amen hey following me this
[1:39:00] is so this is what the anointing oil
[1:39:02] should produce in your life when it
[1:39:04] doesn't just come into your spirit realm
[1:39:06] but goes into your soul it would be now
[1:39:09] you're standing up on your feet and
[1:39:11] faith doesn't matter what wind blows
[1:39:13] tossed to and fro
[1:39:14] we're not tossed to and fro by every
[1:39:16] wind of doctrine anymore doesn't matter
[1:39:18] what people say all this and this and
[1:39:20] this will hold on what about this it's
[1:39:22] also written I mean and they should be a
[1:39:24] witness more than a just a human thing
[1:39:27] but there should be a witness in your
[1:39:29] soul that's God or it should be that's
[1:39:32] not God and it should be well and and if
[1:39:35] there's a question mark you should
[1:39:37] actually say well Lord you're not an
[1:39:38] author of confusion my sheep hear my
[1:39:41] voice it's not they might hear my voice
[1:39:44] they hear my voice and a stranger they
[1:39:48] will not follow Amen so that means we
[1:39:52] his sheep know his voice do you know his
[1:39:54] voice when his voice speaks Steve do you
[1:39:56] recognize God that's you speaking better
[1:40:00] than a stranger there should be
[1:40:02] something in you a flashing red light
[1:40:04] should be warning danger something's not
[1:40:06] right here
[1:40:07] you should have that in you I pray you
[1:40:10] do amen so it's a people now that we're
[1:40:15] we're not tossed to and fro I trust
[1:40:18] you're not you're standing on the Rock
[1:40:20] of Ages
[1:40:20] I meant but yet you're yielded to him
[1:40:24] see Moses was the meekest man in all the
[1:40:26] world you see mature wheat bounce to the
[1:40:29] Sun a bounce of the Sun and it doesn't
[1:40:33] stand like this wheat that's standing
[1:40:35] away this is not fully mature not fully
[1:40:37] ripened I mean but mature one bells they
[1:40:41] see brother Burnham he exalted Jesus
[1:40:43] Christ more than any man I know
[1:40:45] lelou you ain't man so now this is
[1:40:50] what should be produced if the anointing
[1:40:53] oils there hallelujah we have some
[1:40:56] musicians to count on you glad it's his
[1:40:59] life it's his doing this is the Lord's
