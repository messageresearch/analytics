Happy New Year my bro God bless you amen praise the Lord let's um let's go to the scripture amen I see we got new toys so brother Isaac's testing them out praise the Lord amen let's go to Ephesians 3 and um yeah God bless you all we're going to go with um Ephesians 3 and we're going to read from uh verses 8 down to 21 and then we're going to go to the Book of John so Ephesians 3 from verse 8 unto me who am less than least of All Saints is this Grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles The unsearchable Riches of Christ and to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hidden God who have created All Things by Jesus Christ to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers and Heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God according to the Eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our lord in whom we have bold and access with confidence by the faith of him wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you which is your glory for this cause I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in Heaven and Earth is named that he would Grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the dep uh breadth and the length and the depth and height and to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge that ye may might be filled with all fullness of God now unto him that is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we we ask or think according to the power that worketh in US unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages World Without End amen amen amen and then we're going to um go to uh well actually we're going to go to 1 Corinthians 2 and we'll just read this here then we'll then just ask a word of prayer so 1 Corinthians chapter 2 and 9 9-14 and um me go there so who's 1 Corinthians 2 and9 says but as is it but as it is written I hath Not Seen Nor Ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him but God hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searches all things yay the Deep things of God yes sir for what man knoweth the things of uh for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god God that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God which things also we speak not in The Words which man's Wisdom teacheth but which the Holy Ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for they are foolish unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned amen let's bow heads in a word of prayer tonight Lord Jesus how thankful we are Lord Lord that it's by your spirit you reveal to us Lord the things that are in store for us Lord just through the veil Lord up in up in glory and I just want to pray dear God as we look into your word tonight Lord as you're the great author of the book we need you to come and interpret it Lord Make It live in our hearts make it live in our lives I I ask Lord that this would not be a theory lesson Lord may it not be just some abstract idea but Lord may your word come down to where we are Lord may it be so real lord Jesus may it have an effect in our lives oh God may may you increase our faith Lord Jesus and Lord I just want to ask your blessings upon the reading of your word this night Lord we want to pray you touch each sick one Among Us Lord Jesus those who are Lord we heard about brother Matt who's at home unwell Lord I pray that he would become well Lord because by your stripes we know he was healed Lord and that doesn't just go for him only but but all those who are sick Lord we thank you by your stripes we have been made well so dear God I pray you touch each life we thank you for this opportunity to be in your presence once again we do not take it for granted Lord so may you just have your way Among Us For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen God bless you friends you may have your seats uh tonight now this may seem a bit of an odd uh title if I can call it a title uh from what we've just read but I just want if you don't get anything out of the service but this one fact the devil has got nothing to do with you right he tries to claim you your body your spirit your soul but he's got no claim he's got no right right and you've got nothing to do with him either that's right so there's actually a demarcation between the believer and the devil the devil wants us to make think there's actually no separation between us and you I mean us and him but in reality there's a gulf aiming by the blood of Jesus Christ now we read here in Ephesians that you know there would come a time where this mystery of the you know the principalities and powers and Heavenly places might be made known by uh by the church the manifold uh wisdom of God so there's a time where these things had to become known of our position in Christ the power the and the authority that the believer has and the Apostle Paul would would unfold this to us and um you know I'm so thankful that there you know this is not just a uh you know the gospel or knowing the Lord is not just a you know a just a there's no depth to it or there's no reality to it it's not just a casual relationship but it gets deeper it gets richer it gets greater you know as as he walks with you and I and and he reveals himself with in the scripture you know we begin to you know we get to see his character more we begin to love him more we see who we are in him more and you know that you Paul was Paul was you know his his his purpose and really God's purpose was that Christ would dwell in our hearts by faith that You' be rooted and grounded in love and you may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the breadth and the length and the depth and the height and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge that you might be filled with all the fullness of God so so Paul is saying this is not a onedimensional 1D kind of relationship you know God is not just one facet there's many facets to God and and and he was he was praying that we would we would comprehend everything that God is you know cuz people make an excuse well God is so great and he transcends time and how can he you how can man ever being a finite being know an infinite god well God can reveal himself to you amen right he can come down and show who he is to you and who you are in him am mean now this this word comprehend in the English it just means to mentally grasp something to understand something so you can be sitting in class and I you know sat maybe in class for 2 many years I've been to University for far too long but I had to grasp a lot of things I had to comprehend far too much but you know that's just a mental uh comprehension but the Greek word for this here to comprehend is actually deeper than just a to to grasp something mentally or to understand but it means to eagerly seize to possess the literally or figuratively to apprehend to attain to come upon to comprehend to find to obtain or to perceive so when the Apostle Paul is saying that we would that we would comprehend with All Saints what is the breadth the length and the depth and the height he's saying that we would cease upon it we would obtain it amen we would we would actually you know eagerly possess it amen hallelujah that we would we would uh we would obtain we'd perceive it we would apprehend it so we'd actually understand it so it goes beyond a you know when you apprehend something it's not just in your mind like if I got a hold of this I've apprehended my phone Hallelujah I I possess my phone now maybe before where's it gone you know you know too often I've lost my phone why do they make it black you know why I make a highlight of pink it'll stand out anywhere you you know but sometimes it's like where's it gone I know mentally it's mine but where is it but then I apprehend it oh hallelujah it's the same thing when it comes to the revelation of God and God wants to apprehend us he wants to seize our lives he wants us to really for us to recog you belong to me I bought you with a price which is the my own blood that I shed upon the Earth Hallelujah and he wants us to realize the devil has no relationship with us apart from he's our enemy but you know you know nothing he can do is for our good you know he you know it's kind of like a uh abusive relationship man and man and the devil you know the Devil comes along and tries to be all nice and loving but then he beats and gets angry and abuses and you know destroys and then comes the next day and tries to be nice again and Patch it up it's just a cycle of abuse but then the Lord comes in and he breaks that cycle Hallelujah and he begins to show no you were never meant to be in a relationship with the devil but you meant to be in Union with me Hallelujah and when you realize that you're in Union with Christ and the devil's been kicked out and the devil tries to come back and you say hold on devil you have no place huj I have no relationship I have no dealings with you I don't belong to you you're no part of me and that's how we should be Hallelujah so I'm glad that there is there is come a time and now is that we would comprehend the depth of God hallelujah now when we read there in Corinthians and I will get to my thought I just want to lay this background because you know the reality of being free in the lord it's such a it's such an easy phrase to say I'm free I'm free indeed but the magnitude of that the reality of the freedom we have is an incredible thing and to me when when the Apostle Paul Paul is is is speaking of the depths you know you know the Deep things of God the spirit searches out all things yeah the Deep things of God now I'm in First Corinthians 9 and 10 here you know he's not to me he's not talking about abstract ideas he's not talking about you know just just Concepts he's talking about reality he's talking about something you know the Deep things you know when we when we think about the and this is not just one of them but but you know a deep this word deep things in the Greek it means a of I've never heard of this word before but profundity which is the quality or the state of being profound that's what it means it's something that's profound it's it's got a quality to it it's not just a empty phrase you know there's a depth to it there's a meaning there's a profoundness to it Hallelujah and by implication the extent of it so when he talks about this the spirit would search out all the you know the Deep things of God it would search out the extent of God the depths of him you know the richness of his character the richness of his being the richness of his word hallelujah that's right am amen so there's a spirit within the believer that they want more of God Amen they've had it all but they want more Hallelujah you know we're not satisfied with just living off memories of what he did in the past we want more Hallelujah we've seen him do incredible things but we want to see more see him do more incredible things he's opened his word to us so much we want more you know Jesus said when the spirit of Truth shall come he will lead us and guide us into all truth he'll Lead You Lead you and guide you into all truth well people say well this is the complete revelation of Jesus Christ and it is but is it is it revealed to you see it was revealed to Paul but it had to be revealed to the Saints so the spirit of Truth had to come and actually make this live and a reality to the Saints the same thing with you and I you know you first get saved you first meet the Lord there's a lot of things that haven't become reality to you and you may have read it many times but when it strikes home Hallelujah then what what's that the spirit of Truth is leading and guiding you showing you your position in Christ so maybe you know you first meet the Lord but there's still a lot of uh bad habits in your life you know the devil's lust the devil's perversion hatred malice Strife those are things the devil tries to keep in our lives for him to make us think we have a part in him or he has a part in us but then the Lord as as we walk with him he casts those things out he sanctifies us us takes those things from us and but but how does he do it he gives us Revelation in the scripture you don't have to have those things you don't have to keep with that lust or that problem that hatred that unforgiveness that buness whatever it may be you don't have to live with that you say well my father was like this my grandfather my great great great great grandfather but no there but there comes a time when your eyes come open when you realize this is not my portion amen this shouldn't belong to me it never was meant to belong to me so you kick it out Hallelujah and that's what that's what the spirit of Truth does he leads you and guides you into all truth that you would recognize that you're a Son of God more than just a mental idea yes I'm a son or a daughter of God but the Lord shows you actually you are joint air with Christ hallah you are a son or a daughter of God therefore you have certain rights over the devil and those rights are for him to be under your feet Hallelujah and remember if the devil's not under your feet he's out of his position but this is the season where everyone comes to their position Hallelujah yeah the devil thinks he's going to be the head but he's actually the tail Hallelujah he thinks he's in charge but no no no he's under the feet of the body of Christ and I can't remember who said it but I like the saying you know you may be the skin on the bottom of the little toe of the body you're still on top of the head of the devil amen hallelujah you may be the most bottom point of the body it doesn't matter the devil's still under you Hallelujah so we need to recognize that he has no part in us we have no part in him Hallelujah because that's what the blood does the blood cleanses Us in such a way that there's actually the devil can have no claims on the bride of Christ anymore the believer the devil cannot accuse them anymore cu the blood covers them sure we you know we have memories of things we did in this body and things that we well and truly regret but in God's books are you know as I've said there's a blank page Hallelujah I'm glad there's a blank page now Jesus would would would um would tell his disciples as he's sitting there in the Last Supper they're about to go to the Garden of Gethsemane and um you know he's speaking to them and he says in John 14 and and and verse 30 Hereafter I'll not talk much with you for the prince of this world cometh and hath nothing in me but that the world may know that I love the father and and as the father gave me commandment even so do I do arise let us go hence now when when Jesus says that the so the prin this world we know is the devil right it's not pilate it wasn't the high priest it was the Devil Himself but Jesus is saying that he has nothing in me he has no part in me now other translations would say he has nothing over me he has no power over me he has no claim on me this is what Jesus is saying about the Devil he's got no claim over me he's got nothing over me he's got no power over me remember Jesus recognized who he was Hallelujah and he wants us to recognize Who We Are amen that we have been raised up in this generation to conquer the devil amen we have the overcoming power in us already our faith gives us a victory how do you say well I'm weak in faith that faith is enough to conquer every devil am mean that that faith is enough to cast him out of your life Hallelujah so Jesus saying this this guy has nothing over me he's got no leverage against me he's got no power over me and he has no claim on me and this is the same this is what the Lord wants us to realize that the devil has no nothing over me he has no power over me he has no claim on me Hallelujah Church says I trust you say Amen the devil has no claim over me he has no power over me he has nothing over me why because the blood of Jesus Christ has cleansed me from all sin Hallelujah he has taken my past away I mean he has broken that First Union and now I'm being united with another amen which is Christ himself so because of the blood ofes Jesus Christ now the devil has nothing over me he has no claim on me but the devil would like me to think that he does I mean but he doesn't amen hallelujah and so we need to recognize that we're free the remember we want to we want to recognize the depth of this Freedom now the depth of this freedom is not a part-time Freedom it's not when you're just feeling good kind of Freedom it's not just kind of I'm at camping everything's wonderful kind of Freedom this is fre day Freedom Jesus would say whom the son has set free is free indeed and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free amen so there's a force in the truth that will make a person free hallelujah amen amen so there's now there's a force that is driving the believer to be free it makes us free so the truth itself because many you know many times you think how can I get out of this well you shall know the truth and we know the truth of the scripture and that truth will make us free there's a force in it to actually cast The Devil out of our Lives there's a force in it to take sickness out of our Lives there's a force in it to take bad habits out of our Lives unforgiveness resentment whatever Spirit may be upon us that's trying to afflict us there's a force in the truth that will make us free of it Lord hallelujah remember because we you know man was never built to be a slave to the devil man was never made to serve the devil man was made to have dominion upon the Earth that's what man was built for that was his original purpose was to God told Adam Adam and Eve subdue you know have dominion yes we're in Genesis now so that was the original plan for man was to have dominion but then the devil came in dethrown man off being you know being being in charge of this world and from that time on man has been a slave where where Jesus would well yeah Jesus would say in Ephesians chapter 2 where we once walked according to the spirit of the world the prince of the power of the air we once did so man was actually born walking according to the prince of the power of the air but there comes a time where that devil gets dethroned hallelujah amen but down through the Old Testament even though the blood of bulls and goats would cover the sins of the people it could never change the nature of the people even Moses with an incredible Ministry that he had he still had that Fallen nature and we can go all the way through but now one man had to come to undo what the devil did in the beginning we know that was God became flesh Hallelujah God became a man to reconcile the world to himself and so now when Jesus came he knew who he was he knew that he was the second Adam he knew the devil had no claim on him he knew he had authority over the devil I mean when he was asleep tied after a very very busy meeting in the back of a boat and they're sailing across the other side and all the Devils got into the wind and to the waves and you know cuz we know the devil causes storms and now B basically it becomes a battle who really is the master of the wind and and and and the disciples were panicking they wake up Jesus yo don't you care master we're going to perish and the Creator himself stood up because the devil S I have Master over this nature I have Master over the elements but the one who made them stood up and said peace be still and the world had to obey amen the voice of the Creator and that proved that Jesus has the power to control any situation Hallelujah doesn't matter if it's Lazarus and the grave it's a storm whatever it may be amen he has power amen over every situation in life yes sir that's right hallelujah amen so there he was now he knew he had power over the devil he defeated he defeated Satan in the wilderness by just quoting the scripture and he knew that he did not have to serve the devil the devil tried to make him serve him well how did that work well if you be the Son of God turn these stones into bread you you need bread so the devil was trying to lead the Son of God but then Jesus said get behind me Satan man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God and then he tried to get him to jump off the temple and fall down worship receive all the kingdoms of the world so the anointing that was upon the Lord with stod and he said no I'm not going to obey you devil yeah now it should be the same thing with you and I if we have the Holy Ghost In Our Lives it gives a power in our lives to withstand the devil trying to lead usall Hallelujah it gives us a power now you say well I fall many times there's blood hallelujah amen we you remember because we are growing into maturity Jesus knew who he was but when we're born into this world we have no idea who we are we think we're from this country with this nationality these kind of family traits but then the Lord comes because we are Sons and Daughters of God and the spirit of God comes upon us and we realize who our real father is and then we begin to grow in Grace and mature Hallelujah so at the start of our Christian walk or even even today you know we can trip and you know the devil can get us by some slight of hand but there'll come a time where those things no longer bother us I mean some things maybe you you it's like a little kid learning to walk he can put your foot out and over he goes but there comes a time where he'll sight step that trip Hallelujah and then you got to get more inventive maybe you know to try and trip him up but then eventually he'll outsmart you H are the devil he oh I've got to really work how to trip these people up but eventually Hallelujah because we don't want to walk you know obstructed we don't want to walk with God and you know trip up by the devil so we want to keep walking So eventually doesn't matter what the trial will be remember there's victory in it there'll be victory over that thing amen hallelujah amen Lord amen that's right it's not him that falls him that gets back up Lord try me one more time Hallelujah now in the in the message of the future home brother Brown speaking of when Jesus was back baptized by by by John the Baptist he says here Jesus speaking to John suff uh suffer it to be so for thus it is becoming to us we know the message to fulfill all righteousness I am the sacrifice that must be washed he suffered him when he went up out of the water he said I saw Heavens open pardon me the prophet saw it he saw the heavens open and here come to sending out of Heaven a form of a dove and a voice saying this is this is my part of the earth that I have redeemed and from this part of the earth I will redeem the rest of it for he is my word made manifest in the whole world I spoke it into existence by my word Hebrews 11 and Satan has held it all this time but I've come to redeem it so much of it has has made his body and I'm coming to dwell in it because remember Jesus was was part of the earth his body was part of the earth the things he ate was from the earth so so God is saying I'm going to use this part of the earth to redeem the rest of the earth Hallelujah so what is he declaring I've redeemed this part I'm going to use it to redeem you and I because remember eventually you look at the Earth itself eventually the devil won't be here he's going to be burned up he's going to be gone he's got an expiry date and he's already gone off we know that but you know there's going to be a time when he's going to be thrown in the dumpster and it's going to be an incinerator and he's going to be chucked in there Hallelujah so this Earth is not going to have the devil on it Hallelujah so so we know the Earth is redeemed in the same stages that we're redeemed Justified sanctified baptism of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah so now just as just as the whole earth will be redeemed and then the glory of the Lord will you know fill the place and we will dwell upon it in new heavens and a new Earth so we are redeemed in the same process but just as the Earth comes to a state where there's no devil there we are in that same state but we have to get to that state before the Earth does and we're in that state before we get a new body cuz remember it doesn't matter how many mind battles comeing the number of Mind battles does not reflect on your salvation or your Victory right because remember this is no man's land and the devil has a right to fire thoughts and cause trouble but it doesn't reflect on your soul because of your soul is sealed in by the Holy Ghost the devil may get into your mind or he may get into your body and make you sick but he can't touch your soulen huah and that's the main thing you can be you you can be a nervous wreck you can be sick as a dog but if you're sealed into the kingdom all well Hallelujah yes sir now I love it in Revelations 12 it says there was war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found anymore in heaven so there came a point where you know the devil was doing this thing in heaven and you know Gathering all the other angels and you know making a coup and trying to take over but there came a time where he was cast out and there's no place for him anymore so there's a vacancy in heaven where he used to occupy he fell from it and their place wasn't found anymore now we know that that battle fell upon human beings Hallelujah but then there came a time where he wasn't found there was no place for him anymore in me Hallelujah cuz once he led me once he was my king by default but then another king came along the Lord Jesus Christ and kicked him out Hallelujah so he has no place in me anymore but I've got to realize okay so if I'm God's why should I allow the devil to come in and try and take over why should I listen to his thoughts why should I obey him think about it he has no place in me I have no place in him there's a demarcation line that's right Hallelujah so so if that's the case now why should I listen to him the blood has CLE yeah we're not our own we're bought with a price which is the precious blood of Jesus Christ so we are actually a purchased possession Hallelujah so we are if we are Gods then we're not the devils and remember we we we were never actually meant to be the devils in the beginning we never actually belonged to him right we always were Gods he just came to find and seek and save those which were lost in order for something to be lost it had to be found but then it had to be in possession but then lost and then found again just like my phone as I said it's mine but then I lose it so I seek it and say this is mine Hallelujah Glory I'm glad the Lord found me you know shamgar there's only one one scripture written about Shamar brother B says but that's all that matters you know I don't know how many Harvest Seasons the Philistines were part of his life every every harvest season maybe just cut down all the wheat and the barley and whatever you know picked all of his fruit whatever more and he put it into the storehouse and things and then maybe he thinking maybe maybe this season they won't come again but then he hears the stomp stomp stomp of the Philistine soldiers coming up and they're saying oh Shamar what he got for us this year and you know you had a real good crop last year I hope you've been working hard and you know and and the Philistines were part of his life but he had to realize they weren't meant to be part of his life am they were actually not their their place wasn't actually on his ground that wasn't their right there the same thing with the devil devil he can be a part of our life but you got to recognize he was never meant to be part of my life it was meant to be me and God alone remember our our relationship with the Lord is not us the devil and God it's us and God the you the devil just tries to cut in but you going to say no devil I'm sorry I'm married Hallelujah and I'm not flirting with you hallelujah amen then then the Devil comes along you say you you just call your husband on the scene and he's going to kick him out Hallelujah so Shema had to come to the realization this has to come to an end these people aren't meant to be here and and when I talk about Philistines I'm talk about demon Spirits you know they can be gone and come and go just like these philes but he had to realize they weren't meant to be part of his life remember they were the ones that invaded on his land he didn't invite them to come and live where he was or come and invite and take his crop they just turned up it's like the devil he turns up to steal kill and destroy but you got to realize actually they're not meant to be part of this scene they're not they're not meant to be part of my life so he realized remember it wasn't he didn't suddenly become an overcoming son of Abraham when he picked up the ox goat and went after them he already was but he had to realize who he was he had to realize that this was actually his position and Hallelujah and he came to a realization this don't have to end up the same way I can put an end to this right now by Who I Am Not Who I'll become who I am right now and the scripture says today we're the Sons and Daughters of God not we will be one day we are right now Hallelujah and he took us o go 600 blows to the Head later you know the end of the story Hallelujah shot was on they died amen so we can live with things and we can actually realize we can actually fail to realize it's the devil troubling us now brother brah talks quite a lot about nervous conditions whoever you just search nervous condition through the message it's prevalent and it's still prevalent today but many times we don't understand well people no doubt didn't understand what was causing the nervous condition they maybe thought well they just just going through a stressful time of life maybe the kids are a certain age there's pressure at the job there's pressure at home pressure in church lot of trouble things going on and it made them that way but we know a nervous condition is not actually just a natural thing that's a demon power yeah brother would say this now something happened in the audience now just keep believing there was a woman that was praying it's a much older woman than this and she appeared here before me praying someone's praying for a trouble in here that's the that's touch the high priest let us talk again I can only go as the spirit leads me oh you're not here for yourself you're here for someone else see see brother seeing a vision now that's a man it's your husband and he suffering with you call it a demon depression it's a nervous condition that's broke his nerves down so it is actually a demon depression but people would call it just a nervous condition so it's actually the devil trying to break someone down it's a demon power coming against them but if but if we don't realize that it's that we'll just well I'm just a bit nervous cuz I got this trouble in my life but it's actually the devil trying to destroy someone thank you Lord It's a nervous condition that broke his nerves down that's thus sayith the lord it's true isn't it if it is wave your hands do you believe me to be his Prophet take that handkerchief that you wiped your tears with and lay it on him and he will be made well thus sayith the Lord if thou can us believe have faith in God don't doubt now have faith in God be real reverent be real reverent now so you know we have to realize when you know we know we all have different Natures right some are very flagma some are very dogmatic or you know whatever the different labels are for all those things but you know there comes a time where you know our nerves can get real on edge but it's not a natural reason it's actually a devil trying to get us or you know maybe just real you know short fuses and high temper and trouble you know what what it's the devil trying to get us but we need to realize that it's the devil trying to get us we need to realize that it's not a natural well I just don't have much sleep or something like that no it's not that but it's the devil trying to afflict us but you know we have to realize you know when you know the devil tries to hand us a lot of things brother Ram says it's like you know he gives us a box of rattlesnakes and he can even say you know your name's on it but we have the power Just say if I'm the I'm the here there's a box R next see K andu this is for you now yeah good man but you see no no it's really for you you have to take it look sign for it see someone spent it's very heavy someone spent a lot of money see he has the power to receive it or to reject it and the more we entertain a spirit it's actually us receiving it now now that doesn't mean you go on denial about symptoms if you got cancer you got cancer sure but you know you actually have to realize this is never meant to be part of me or this unforgiveness this bitterness this nervous condition whatever may be going on this is never actually meant to be mine remember we meant the Christians are meant to be happy hallah meant to have joy unspeakable full of Glory irrespective of can you know what's going on in life you know we're not meant to be all sad and down and super serious and you know can't laugh and stuff we're not meant to be that way we're meant to be happy we have eternal life that should make us real happy right on our way to heaven shouting we're not going to see the Great Tribulation Isn't that cool that's real cool Hallelujah hey the world's falling apart well that's all right I've Got My Ticket out of here hallelujah when's he turning up well maybe tomorrow maybe right now that's fine Hallelujah do you have to get to a euphoric State no no no no I just believe the word hallelujah remember it's not a state of euphoria that we'll be in to get us out of here no it's a revelation of the word that will get us out of here hallelujah amen Hal Hallelujah so we have a right we can either sign for it or we can be a believer like brother ker and turn it down hallelujah it's up to us now we don't order these things sometimes they just turn up sometimes there's a real battle on you know God God heals in different ways does he not he's not not a cookie cutter like you take the life of David he killed he used a sling to Kill The Lion and the Bear in Goliath but he never uses a sling again sometimes God tells him go into battle other times he says wait till you hear the you know the rushing of the Wind Through the mury Trees the sound of it going then rise up and he own kill so so God is not a cookie cutter so sometimes he'll just heal supernaturally instantly sometimes it'll be a you know it'll take time sometimes he uses medicine sometimes you got to carry it to death amen sometimes it's that way but you know so God God does different things sometimes it can just be a simple change of diet or are you getting enough sleep I'm just so worn down all the time I'm like this well have you had a have you had a break amen how's your diet going what are you feeding on sometimes you used get prayed for and it's just gone instantly other times lay hands on the sick and they shall recover right other times you know we'll carry it to the Grave it's actually our ticket out of here now that that one's not really the rejoicing one but you know but God is not a cookie cutter sometimes he uses medicine sometimes he doesn't use medicine we're going to be open for all opportunities I mean all all all avenues but we got to realize that just because we get sick or just because we have trouble in our mind it doesn't mean we're not Believers because the Devil comes along as soon as they're trouble remember I think it was brother Ryan hay said when he when he when he gave the testimony of that song that sister Jenny s you know he says we should um um he said rather we should many times we are defined by by our trials and by our circumstances but those things shouldn't Define us what should Define us is our identity in the Lord Jesus Christ that should be what really defines us sure we'll have trials we'll have struggles we'll have circumstances we'll have battles but those things should never Define us who we are in the Lord should be our defining Mark hallelujah amen now we have Colossians uh 3 and and one if ye then be risen with Christ seek those things which are above where Christ sth on the right hand of God set your affection on things above not on things of the Earth for ye are dead and your life is head with Christ and God so so as as Jesus says that the devil has no claim on me he has no pardon me you know he has no uh um power over me if our lives if we are dead and our lives are hidden God I mean hidden Christ with God then we can say the same thing I remember we're God's children am we're not the devil's children we don't belong to him we never did hallelujah amen so when Christ who is our life shall appear then shall ye also appear with him in glory mortify Therefore your members which are upon the Earth of fornication uncleanness inordinate affection evil concent and covetousness which is idolatry for which thing sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of Disobedience and which you also W walked sometime when you lived in them but now ye also put off all these anger wrath malice blasphemy filthy communication out of your mouth lie not one to another seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds I put him off took off the old man do not resuscitate amen got he died that guy so so so if that life is dead he's been drowned he's gone why why would I want to live in that way I'm walking in of life amen I mean remember it was never it was never our uh God never intended us to live a fallen way in terms of being full of anger wrath blasphemy malice filthy communication over our mouth lying you know all those things that wasn't meant to be our portion we're meant to be Overcomers when he thought of us he saw us as an overcomer Hallelujah before the foundation of the world you know many times it's name occupation date of birth whatever you know name balore and occupation Overcomer Hallelujah date of birth well before the foundation of the world Amen you know Glory what's your address Hallelujah Highway amen hallelujah amen so and have put on the new man see we need to realize sure we're in this flesh this guy there's going to be a body change and maybe the older we get the more we're going to rejoice in that not necessarily because we age but because we realize this guy gets us into a lot of trouble but we need to realize actually I'm not meant to be following this guy I'm going to drag this guy to Heaven he doesn't want to go he wants to be lazy he doesn't want to come to church he doesn't want to pray he wasn't to read the Bible but I'm going to make him do it he didn't want to get baptized he got baptized H he didn't want to come to the altar he came to the altar he didn't want to receive the Holy Ghost he got the Holy Ghost Hallelujah and he'll take a Rapture too one day your body will thank you for it amen and have put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him where there is neither Greek nor Jew circumcision nor uncircumcision Barbarian cynthian Bond or free but Christ is all and in all put on therefore is the elect of God holy and beloved bowels of mercies kindness humbleness of Mind meekness longsuffering forbearing one another and forgiving one another If any man have a quarrel against any even so Christ forgave you so also do ye amen and above all these things put on charity which is the bond of perfectness and let the peace of God rule in your hearts to which also ye are called in one body and be ye thankful let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with Grace in your hearts to the Lord and whatsoever you do in word or deed do all in the name of Jesus Christ giving thanks to God and the father by him prise the Lord hallelujah so this is what we should do because you know if you think about it to to be holy well that's an attribute of God remember the devil wants his attributes to be displayed in our lives he wants unbelief malice Strife hatred variance bitterness whatever it may be gossip all those things he wants those things to be manifested and he and and he tries to allow them you know he tries to put them in US and then he says well you have pardoned me because I can see myself in you you know you look at your kids and you can see there like a stamp amen so the devil tries to make his character expressed in us and he's trying to say actually there's a we got a connection going on but then really you got to realize no no no no that connection got severed the blood of Jesus Christ broke that broke that connection so now we're connected with another which is Christ himself so you look at all these attributes that I just read out or or way your character that I just read out this is all the that's all God's character to be holy bows of mercies God is rich in Mercy kindness humbleness of Mind meekness longsuffering bear forbearing one another and forgiving one another all those things are are the character of Christ being being being displayed Hallelujah so so whenever God sees his word manifested so you you you see that manifested you know you in our lives God looks down and says I see myself in that person Hallelujah you know he says we we got we got something going on Hallelujah there's a Divine connection amen hallelujah amen so I I trust in these little chopped up words we're got to realize we have no part with the devil we have no agreement we have no working relationship we know you know we have no whatever you want to Define it in any other way we don't have no part with him there's nothing that we have to do with the devil only to cast him out kick him out wherever you find him that's the only dealing we have with him so we need to realize when he when when he comes along and he tries to say no no no there's a part of me still in you you have to tell him devil the baptism of the Holy Ghost has burned you out of my life brother and says there was a snake either in our Spirit of our soul he use it two different ways but the Holy Ghost comes in and burns out that snake nature destroys that snake nature then the nature of the dove comes in and Christ lives himself out of the believer Hallelujah so you say well I'm just and I'll say it this way if that snake nature hasn't been burnt out you get it burnt out the Holy Ghost will burn him out our God is a consuming fire Hallelujah and and he'll burn it out of your life if you give it over to him but if you justify yourself just like the man who had the nervous condition there you know what if he just said no no I've just got a nervous condition see see look that you know his his wife or whoever that woman was in that quote no doubt she was praying for him because she didn't understand what was going on and the Lord revealed to her through the prophet actually it's a demon it's demon depression is causing that nervous condition but if he just took own of that and said you I mean I mean ownership of that said well my father was nervous and my mother was nervous and you know there's a family trade in that he would have kept it just because our parent you know we can see a family trait you know that's been passed down we don't have to live with that no that's not our inheritance our inheritance is the C nature of Christ in us hallelujah amen where we bear the image of the Heavenly not just the Earthly amen but the thing is if we just say well I was born this way I'll die this way this is just how I'm going to be well that's the devil saying we got something going on and we should keep this going cuz it work out real well for who for him not for you but if God comes in and takes rid of that you know gets rid of that thing because you want it gone and then the devil tries to come back and say no no hold on hold on devil we have we have no Fellowship you're following me I'm just maybe repeating myself but we need to realize actually the Fallen nature of man is not my portion it's not my portion it's not my family's portion it's not our portion is you know as a Christian it's not our portion they backbite they lie they cheat they steal they you know to every man for himself every dog you know dog eat dog kind of what can I get out of people use and abuse all those things that's the Fallen nature of man manipulate you know you know lies and slander and political Maneuvers to try and you know get one up over people that's Fallen man that's not the nature of Christ the nature of Christ is not what I can get but what can I give how can I empower someone else how can I edify the body how can I lift someone up how can I speak the truth in love how can I you know because God gives he pours himself out for others he poured himself out for me he poured himself out for you and I so it's not what I can get what can I give to others you're following me you know Lord there's no lies in him there's no malice in him there's no backstabbing in him there's no political agenda try and twist in you know character assassination or gossip that's not God that's the devil I mean there's no lies there's no slander there's no hatred There's No Malice there's no Strife there's just peace and joy and love and acceptance and forgiveness that's what's in God amen amen so shouldn't that be in us well if that stake nature is still wriggling around in your life it will be the negative side but if that's burnt out by the Holy Ghost you'll just see the Lord living Hallelujah so we have no part in the the devil you could have summ that up in that words well maybe I could have just said that for 45 minutes but we have no part in the devil you got to realize the devil tries to say why don't you come back to me we're had such good times why don't you come back let's live it all through again you say no no no no no done phito when I died I died to get rid of you and I don't want you back but I love you no the devil don't love us he just wants to use and abuse us and and you know he'll try and get us to think well such wonderful times and you know if we if our identity is in our past then our past will drag us back into it but if our identity is in the word and the Lord Jesus Christ we can't go back to our past amen because my past doesn't Define me all is I thank you Lord I'm not that guy Hallelujah I'm walking in newness of life and that's how we should be we should be defined by who we are and the Lord Jesus and what he's done for us that should be our identity our culture our nature our everything should be in him amen let's have the musicians please amen hallelujah I'm glad I don't have a relationship with the devil we can just walk with the Lord you say well the devil's on my back just love the Lord just love the Lord walk with him amen just just go on loving the Lord and the Lord will take care of it all amen sometimes we get so caught up in different things just just walk with the Lord and love him amen he's the one who takes you amen let's stand shall we tonight amen um I want to sing uh In Christ Alone My Hope Is found ien list thing are you glad your hope is
