[33:12] god bless you so nice to have you here
[33:15] amen amen praise the lord
[33:18] if you had your bibles handy we'll just
[33:20] go to uh first john
[33:23] i just want to read the first
[33:24] i guess we could just read the whole
[33:26] chapter there's no harm there's only 10
[33:27] verses
[33:30] and uh amen praise the lord
[33:35] amen let's just read this here
[33:39] that which was from the beginning
[33:41] which we have heard
[33:43] which we have seen with our eyes which
[33:45] we have looked upon and our hands have
[33:47] handled of the word of life for the life
[33:49] was manifested and we have seen it and
[33:51] be a witness and show unto you that
[33:53] eternal life which was with the father
[33:56] and was manifested unto us and we don't
[33:58] put that in just john that's our
[33:59] testimony
[34:01] that which we have seen and decl heard
[34:04] declare we unto you
[34:06] that that ye also may have fellowship
[34:08] with us and truly our fellowship is with
[34:11] the father and with the son jesus christ
[34:14] and these things right we unto you that
[34:16] your joy may be full amen this then is
[34:19] the message which we have heard of him
[34:20] and declare unto you that god is light
[34:23] and in him is no darkness at all
[34:25] if we say we have fellowship with him
[34:27] and walk in darkness we lie and do not
[34:30] the truth but if we walk in the light as
[34:32] he is in the light we have fellowship
[34:34] one with another and the blood of jesus
[34:36] christ his son cleanses us from all sin
[34:39] if we say we have no sin we deceive
[34:41] ourselves and the truth is not in us if
[34:44] we confess our sins he is faithful and
[34:47] just to forgive us our sins and to
[34:49] cleanse us from all unrighteousness if
[34:52] we say then we have not sinned we make
[34:54] him a liar and his word is not in us
[34:57] amen lord bless his word you may be
[34:59] seated tonight
[35:01] i'd like to uh i'd like to if i could
[35:04] take a bit of a subject i want to talk
[35:06] about god as light
[35:08] and in him there's no darkness at all
[35:10] we have a incredible
[35:13] day that we're alive and you know it's
[35:14] incredible that we would be at the end
[35:15] of all things and and being here you
[35:18] know many people would love to go back
[35:20] to jesus day and you know and it would
[35:22] be wonderful to be alive then it would
[35:24] have been wonderful to see him break the
[35:25] bread and multiply the fish and you know
[35:27] being in the boat with the disciples and
[35:29] see him hang on calvary and see him go
[35:31] to the tomb and you know all these it
[35:33] would have been incredible to be there
[35:34] but today is actually a greater day than
[35:36] that because because light you know the
[35:39] word was manifested in that day and we
[35:41] understand that whenever the word is
[35:43] made manifest it is light
[35:45] and and so you know the word was
[35:48] manifested in that day and and and that
[35:50] was all done that he would purchase our
[35:52] salvation on calvary but
[35:54] in order to redeem something you must
[35:56] first pay for it then you must claim it
[35:58] you know because what's good of of
[36:00] paying for something if you don't
[36:01] actually take it into your position that
[36:03] it belongs to you and so we are in that
[36:06] second part of his great plan where he
[36:07] is now laying claim of everything that
[36:10] belongs to him and so we are in the
[36:12] claiming time where he actually puts a
[36:14] hand upon you and i and he says this one
[36:17] belongs to me satan they don't belong to
[36:19] you they never have belonged to you they
[36:21] belong to me
[36:22] and it takes the light of god's word to
[36:24] come across your path for you to realize
[36:27] you're not this is not your home
[36:29] this is your your parents you know your
[36:31] earthly parents yo you knew you came out
[36:33] of them but they're not your real parent
[36:35] god just allowed them to birth you into
[36:36] this earth that one day he would come
[36:38] across your path
[36:40] and so the word has already been sent
[36:42] always been sent upon the earth to
[36:44] gather a people you know you see there
[36:46] when moses moses met god is a pillar of
[36:49] fires in the burning bush there was a
[36:51] light that shone and he saw that light
[36:53] and he said i have heard the cries of my
[36:55] people and i have come down to deliver
[36:57] them so there's a purpose was i'm going
[36:59] to gather them to myself and so that's
[37:02] always the purpose where god sends his
[37:04] word is to gather his elected ones and
[37:06] it's always the purpose is not only to
[37:08] gather them but it's to remove all the
[37:11] works of satan from all of them it's to
[37:13] remove their first nature amen this this
[37:16] this nature this sin nature we were born
[37:18] with you know that's why you must be
[37:20] born again it's not because you know we
[37:23] don't need salvation because we just did
[37:24] bad things it's because we're all born
[37:26] with a sin nature and that nature has to
[37:29] die
[37:29] and that and the power that was released
[37:32] to kill that nature was released on
[37:34] calvary amen to that nature of unbelief
[37:36] that would be led by the world in all
[37:38] its darkness amen light shone that that
[37:40] nature would be killed hallelujah and we
[37:43] have the power you know we're not
[37:45] looking we're looking for the change in
[37:47] the body you know brother brown said
[37:48] he's not looking for a great revival
[37:50] he's looking for the coming of the lord
[37:52] this is the end of his ministry he said
[37:54] that the son you know the seven thunders
[37:56] are what needed to awaken the bride and
[37:58] he says they've already come
[38:00] amen so we are not looking you say i
[38:02] need more of god i need more of god all
[38:04] you need is present amen the word that
[38:07] he has released everything we need is in
[38:09] that message amen we're not looking for
[38:12] god to open his word more sure you know
[38:14] there's things
[38:16] he reveals the word to us but in the
[38:18] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[38:20] when he shall begin to sound all the
[38:22] mysteries of god should be finished and
[38:24] that seventh angel was brother branham's
[38:26] ministry
[38:28] amen so there's no eighth angel there's
[38:29] no ninth angel or some committee of
[38:31] ministers anywhere but all the mysteries
[38:33] are being finished jesus christ has
[38:35] revealed himself in his fullness
[38:38] amen so everything we have need of is
[38:40] available
[38:41] i mean everything we have need of we
[38:43] don't we're not waiting for some great
[38:44] big thing to come all we're looking for
[38:47] is a change in the bodies
[38:48] and what we need to change the bodies
[38:51] god has revealed amen god has released
[38:53] it to us that we can take a body change
[38:56] hallelujah so light you know you see
[38:59] let's go to genesis chapter one
[39:02] amen
[39:05] i just want to read a couple of verses
[39:07] from genesis chapter one
[39:09] let's read down to
[39:11] verse three
[39:12] in the beginning god created the heavens
[39:14] and the earth period
[39:16] and the earth was without form and void
[39:18] and darkness was upon the face of the
[39:20] deep
[39:21] and the spirit of god moved upon the
[39:23] face of the waters and god said
[39:25] let there be light and there was light
[39:28] amen so the first time it's recorded
[39:31] that god speaks he says let there be
[39:33] light
[39:34] and
[39:35] we understand brother brown tells us if
[39:37] he you know you know if he said let
[39:38] there be light and a fog or something
[39:40] came
[39:41] then it wasn't god speaking when god
[39:43] speaks it happens
[39:45] it doesn't you know it may linger for a
[39:47] season but whenever the season he speaks
[39:49] his word and then when he knows when
[39:51] it's going to be manifest it's it's
[39:53] manifested and so brother brown he takes
[39:55] this if you take genesis chapter one
[39:58] when when god says let there be light
[40:00] that actually means let the light appear
[40:02] so what happens now is in genesis 1 it's
[40:04] actually taken from the view of standing
[40:06] upon the earth
[40:07] and then there's the so there's already
[40:09] light but darkness covers the earth and
[40:11] waters cover the whole thing so so the
[40:14] earth is in darkness
[40:15] and and and the water covers it
[40:18] but in in the earth is seed
[40:21] and there is seed that must come forth
[40:24] amen but there's darkness there's you
[40:26] know that you know there's water
[40:27] covering the life
[40:29] and so god speaks and it begins to be a
[40:31] separation of light from darkness then
[40:33] the land comes forth and then those
[40:35] seeds come forth
[40:37] amen
[40:39] so there has to be a removing of
[40:41] darkness in order for the life to come
[40:43] amen there has to be a removing of
[40:44] remember in him there's no darkness at
[40:46] all but when when you were born you're
[40:49] in darkness
[40:50] doesn't matter if you're raised it
[40:52] doesn't matter if you can trace your
[40:53] lineage back to the upper room wherever
[40:55] it was you're born in darkness but in
[40:57] him there is no darkness so there comes
[40:59] a time where light comes your way
[41:01] hallelujah and he begins to separate
[41:04] amen light from darkness because he sees
[41:07] he sees something in you that even you
[41:09] didn't know you possessed
[41:11] you didn't know what was in you i mean
[41:13] that one day one day the light of the
[41:15] word came over your path and maybe you'd
[41:17] been in all kinds of other churches or
[41:19] other religions but one day this word
[41:21] came your way and then you begin to
[41:23] realize this fits me just right and it
[41:26] was what i was looking for even though i
[41:28] maybe didn't know what i was looking for
[41:30] but something resonated in me
[41:32] yes yes lord hallelujah and then a new
[41:35] life begin to come forth but there's a
[41:37] separation of light from darkness
[41:39] remember in him is no darkness at all
[41:42] and we understand whenever there's light
[41:44] shadows darkness has to flee
[41:47] i mean you can't have light and darkness
[41:49] in the same place
[41:50] hallelujah and it's the light that
[41:52] pushes the darkness it's not the other
[41:54] way around
[41:55] i mean because there's power and light
[41:58] i mean there's pat there's no power and
[41:59] darkness it's a void
[42:01] a mess is the dark you know you know
[42:03] there's no in it your light has energy
[42:06] but darkness has no energy
[42:08] amen so there came a time where god
[42:11] spoke
[42:12] he said let there be and he is actually
[42:14] calling you forth amen he was calling
[42:17] but there was all this darkness that had
[42:19] to be separated
[42:21] amen remember it's god that does the
[42:23] separating
[42:24] amen remember if there's a life in here
[42:27] if there's a life in here it'll come
[42:29] forth in the right atmosphere
[42:31] amen under the right conditions every
[42:32] plan will grow
[42:34] amen
[42:36] and i'm persuaded friends we're not
[42:38] tears
[42:39] we're wheat
[42:40] amen i'm persuaded i'm looking at a
[42:42] bunch of wheat i'm not looking at tears
[42:46] amen
[42:47] so there's light light is to bring forth
[42:50] what it's meant to bring forth
[42:52] and so god now he begins the process and
[42:55] we're not going to read the whole
[42:56] chapter i was going to read those
[42:57] scriptures there but
[42:59] it was to bring forth he says
[43:01] you know he says that they you know it
[43:04] separates everything and then the light
[43:05] finally shines upon the soil and then
[43:08] the life comes forth
[43:10] hallelujah
[43:12] so the light
[43:13] is to do that
[43:15] and the light that those seeds needed
[43:17] was there they didn't need another one
[43:19] they needed that light
[43:21] and then brother brown he oh he speaks
[43:23] the sermon it is the rising of the sun
[43:25] who's heard it is the rising of the sun
[43:27] you know he preaches many easter i think
[43:29] about seven odd easter messages maybe
[43:31] more
[43:32] but
[43:33] when a prophet takes actually a sermon
[43:35] title it's not really i'm just gonna you
[43:38] know he doesn't just scramble something
[43:39] together and think now what can i preach
[43:42] he's declaring something
[43:44] i mean he's declaring a specific thing
[43:46] is happening because remember the word
[43:48] of the lord always comes to the prophet
[43:50] so in god's great timing amen if god is
[43:53] going to declare something he'll tell
[43:54] the prophet and the prophet tells the
[43:56] people amen and then he says now it is
[43:58] the rising of the s o win
[44:01] the sun
[44:03] and he says he says at easter time it
[44:05] was not just one sun rising it was a
[44:07] dual sun rising i mean to the natural
[44:10] sun arose and then god's sun arose the
[44:13] eternal real sunlight arose i mean and
[44:16] it was a it was a dual sun rising so now
[44:19] what was happening now is the as the sun
[44:22] that was rose brought forth the botany
[44:25] life upon the earth but then our
[44:27] supernatural sun was rising i mean to
[44:30] bring forth a supernatural life i mean
[44:32] to shine a shine upon a supernatural
[44:34] people amen that you know many of them
[44:37] you know you know they struggled and
[44:38] they had all different kinds of things
[44:39] like you're like peter he had his
[44:41] struggles but in him was a seed and that
[44:44] seed must come forth
[44:46] god says let every seed bring forth
[44:48] after its kind amen and it's a law that
[44:51] god has placed it must bring forth
[44:54] hallelujah so they were they were there
[44:56] you know and they had sure they had a
[44:58] lot of darkness over them but they
[44:59] didn't change the seed amen that was in
[45:02] them
[45:04] yeah yeah you're following me it's
[45:05] irrelevant what mukpal we came out of
[45:08] it's irrelevant what what pit we're
[45:10] hewed out of that has nothing to do with
[45:12] what is what is in you i mean that is
[45:14] nothing to do it doesn't even come into
[45:16] god's equation amen if he sees a son or
[45:19] daughter of god it doesn't matter what
[45:21] he has to bring them out of he's going
[45:22] to bring them out and it doesn't wear
[45:24] him it doesn't you know it doesn't
[45:26] burden them amen to lift us up where we
[45:28] need to be it doesn't you
[45:31] when god saves someone his power is
[45:33] unlimited
[45:34] and it doesn't you know it doesn't
[45:36] diminish his power one bit i mean to
[45:39] deliver us from whatever we need
[45:40] deliverance from or even to keep us in
[45:42] this world
[45:43] remember we're kept by the power of the
[45:45] holy ghost
[45:46] amen his keeping power keeps us every
[45:48] day
[45:49] if we if we had to keep ourselves
[45:51] friends we'd be lost his loss could be i
[45:54] mean it's his it's his holy ghost in you
[45:57] driving you navigating your life every
[45:59] day amen he's our guide
[46:02] hallelujah but it doesn't it doesn't
[46:03] burden him to guide his children it
[46:06] doesn't weary him to to guide you to
[46:09] where you need to be
[46:11] you take the woman at the well you are
[46:12] sinking you think of the great
[46:15] you know all the people that that man
[46:17] thinks god should have called god
[46:18] bypassed every one of them
[46:20] amen he didn't even he didn't even bring
[46:22] the high priest into account he didn't
[46:24] even bring the priesthood into account
[46:25] he bypassed them all and found a bunch
[46:28] of illiterate fishermen
[46:29] and then he found he found a woman that
[46:31] was you know you know and you know an
[46:33] outcast in her village the woman at the
[46:35] well
[46:36] and she had a revelation that the rest
[46:38] didn't have
[46:39] and people would look at her and say
[46:40] there's no way she's going to be a
[46:42] believer remember jesus when he was
[46:44] calling his disciples he was finding a
[46:46] place that he was going to dwell in
[46:48] he was looking for the place of his rest
[46:51] amen because god doesn't build in a
[46:53] temple made with hands but he dwells in
[46:55] the human heart
[46:56] so he was actually finding
[46:58] the tabernacle that god you know you
[47:00] know that he was going to dwell in and
[47:02] no doubt when they first built that
[47:04] first tabernacle moses you know and the
[47:06] people were inspired to build the
[47:07] tabernacle a certain way they would have
[47:09] done it very reverently
[47:11] and they've done it very respectfully
[47:12] and they would have prayed probably
[47:14] quite a bit before they begin to build
[47:15] it and everything
[47:16] and so man would have thought surely uh
[47:19] uh prepared people
[47:20] the scribes and pharisees that are holy
[47:22] the now
[47:23] amen surely they would be the ones that
[47:25] god would dwell in
[47:27] but god doesn't look at what we think
[47:29] amen he takes the outcasts of life
[47:32] he takes the people that you know people
[47:35] that people think there's no way they're
[47:36] going to be them amen and god says
[47:38] they're the apple of my eye i'm going to
[47:40] make them in my image they'll be like me
[47:43] that's the ones that god always picks i
[47:45] mean all the way down through history
[47:47] it's been those ones
[47:49] hallelujah
[47:51] because man doesn't man looks at the
[47:53] darkness but god just sees what's in us
[47:55] i mean god just looks at the light
[47:58] hallelujah
[48:00] now this word if you're still in first
[48:02] john
[48:04] let's go back to it
[48:07] this word walk
[48:10] in verse
[48:15] if we say we have fellowship with him no
[48:17] but if we walk in the light as he is in
[48:19] the light
[48:20] this word in the greek it means to tread
[48:22] around walk at large
[48:24] especially as proof of ability
[48:27] to live
[48:28] to follow to be occupied with to walk
[48:32] it means so it's talking more than just
[48:35] a
[48:36] casual stroll
[48:37] it means to be occupied with
[48:39] and also as a proof of ability remember
[48:42] it's not your ability
[48:44] yeah it's not look at me i know the
[48:45] message look how much of a christian i
[48:47] am if you're victorious it's his victory
[48:50] you are his victory you must remember
[48:52] that if you're if you yeah it doesn't
[48:54] matter if you've had a terrible year or
[48:56] a wonderful year if you've got faith
[48:59] amen if you can stand and say it doesn't
[49:01] matter what happens in life i'm going to
[49:03] walk with you lord that's victory
[49:05] amen that is absolute victory
[49:08] you see you know you read the faith
[49:10] chapter and we think the great heroes of
[49:12] faith and they were destitute they lived
[49:14] in caves wrapped in sheep skins
[49:16] afflicted tormented
[49:18] that is a that is
[49:20] paul was saying these are the heroes of
[49:21] faith
[49:22] amen and we think being a christian's on
[49:24] the housetop all the time and
[49:26] everything's lovely and everything's
[49:27] well no it's when everything when the
[49:30] chips are down
[49:31] that's when god is proving what's in you
[49:34] amen if you can keep the course
[49:36] i mean not in your own sink but say lord
[49:38] just take me through this day how are
[49:40] you doing i'm just getting through
[49:41] another day
[49:43] halloween everything maybe see him
[49:44] against you but you say i'm gonna walk
[49:46] with you
[49:47] i mean i've been occupied
[49:49] hallelujah i'm occupied with walking
[49:51] with god
[49:53] hallelujah so it's a proof of ability
[49:55] not when things are good but when things
[49:56] are bad
[49:57] you take elite athletes or whoever it is
[50:00] you know it's it's when the chips at
[50:02] where when everything's either
[50:04] success or disaster and it falls just
[50:06] onto a knife edge that's really proves
[50:09] if if they really have what they need
[50:11] you take military you take ethic
[50:14] you know athletic people academic people
[50:16] it's when the chips are down
[50:18] that's really proofs can they can they
[50:20] hold on can they do what they've been
[50:22] called to do
[50:23] i'll tell you what friends the bride of
[50:25] jesus christ
[50:27] has what she needs
[50:28] i mean you have what you need you got to
[50:31] understand you have what you need aiming
[50:33] to get through every situation
[50:35] every trial
[50:36] every unbelief i mean every question
[50:39] i mean anything that tries to bombard
[50:41] you you have what you need i mean just
[50:43] to plow through the thing
[50:45] hallelujah it says count it all joy
[50:48] amen when you're tried and you have
[50:50] tribulation all these different things
[50:52] you say well i don't think i don't think
[50:54] christianity is that way says in the
[50:56] scripture that a man's days are few and
[50:58] full of trouble
[50:59] amen
[51:01] he says count it all joy when these
[51:02] things happen
[51:04] because to walk in light you can't let a
[51:06] shadow come across remember light
[51:09] shows you where you're going
[51:11] you know it's just like
[51:13] yeah i was thinking about this if you
[51:15] get up in the middle of the night and
[51:16] all the lights are off
[51:18] and you think now i've got to go and get
[51:19] a drink of water in the kitchen
[51:21] you can kind of remember where you're
[51:23] going
[51:24] but you're not too sure you gotta you
[51:26] gotta rely on your memory to say it's
[51:28] just so many steps here and this is
[51:30] where the cups are but if you forget
[51:31] there's a bunch of toys in the way you
[51:33] know you're gonna trip and fall on all
[51:34] these things you know so you think it's
[51:37] there but you're not sure but when the
[51:38] light's on then you can see clearly this
[51:40] is my path
[51:42] and and you know the obstacles you need
[51:44] to avoid
[51:45] amen but then when if a shadow comes or
[51:48] the bulbs all blow then you're not too
[51:50] sure again
[51:51] now
[51:53] when the devil brings a question
[51:55] that's a shadow
[51:57] coming across your path
[51:59] because if you look when when the
[52:01] serpent came to eve he said ye has god
[52:04] said
[52:05] they were given some light to walk in
[52:08] don't partake of this fruit that was the
[52:10] light they had to walk in
[52:12] and then satan came along and the
[52:14] serpent and he just tries to put a
[52:15] shadow over that light
[52:17] yay has god said he put a question there
[52:20] and then she began to wrestle with that
[52:21] question
[52:22] and then you know the end of the story
[52:24] they fell
[52:25] amen so don't let don't let the devil
[52:27] come with a question
[52:30] amen because be careful
[52:32] it's darkness coming he's trying to put
[52:34] a shadow over your walk
[52:37] amen and you only stumble in shadows
[52:40] no one stumbles hey if you've got your
[52:42] eyes you can see
[52:43] it's
[52:44] you never stumble in this place walking
[52:46] around but if you turn the lights off
[52:48] when it's dark and you try and you'll
[52:50] probably kick a chair or do you know
[52:52] because why because there's shadow
[52:54] amen are you following me
[52:56] amen don't let him put a question
[52:58] because he always come and he'll put a
[53:00] question is this really the truth do you
[53:02] really think what you have you know do
[53:04] you really think you're a christian do
[53:05] you really think god loves you
[53:07] amen what's that a shadow coming
[53:10] in
[53:11] in god is no darkness at all he's not
[53:14] the author of confusion the scripture
[53:15] tells us but he's the author of peace
[53:18] amen so you've got to think about now
[53:21] well where is this coming from remember
[53:23] waste think something enters into here
[53:25] you're going to think where did that
[53:26] come from did it come from god or is it
[53:29] from satan that's right that's it you
[53:31] got to think about it why am i getting
[53:32] all stirred up and all this
[53:34] you got to think you know where did this
[53:36] come from
[53:39] in him is no darkness at all
[53:42] so as i was saying before there was a
[53:43] dual sun rising
[53:45] there on the day
[53:47] you know when you know when jesus arose
[53:50] but then we must understand we must not
[53:51] put these things just back in history
[53:54] because brother abraham says there's
[53:56] been a resurrection in this day
[53:58] he says what a resurrection that was
[54:01] that day when he came out of the tomb he
[54:03] says what a resurrection this is
[54:06] amen where a people came out of death
[54:08] and unbelief and darkness
[54:10] hallelujah hey we were in tombs i mean
[54:12] you were born in a tomb whether you're
[54:14] like or not you're born in a tomb and
[54:16] you're raised in a tumor but but then
[54:19] god rolled the stone away
[54:20] harlow you're going to recognize god
[54:22] rolled the stone away and you came forth
[54:24] and you recognized i wasn't meant to be
[54:26] in that place
[54:27] amen that that wasn't that wasn't the
[54:30] place i was meant to be
[54:32] hallelujah and he says what a
[54:33] resurrection this is he says what's that
[54:35] resurrection of people they may have
[54:37] been resurrected from death unto life
[54:39] hallelujah you've already been
[54:40] resurrected
[54:42] amen you've got to be spiritually
[54:44] resurrected before this body has changed
[54:47] oh look many of us are looking for the
[54:49] change in the body i say you have to be
[54:51] spiritually resurrected first and if you
[54:54] are spiritually resurrected this body is
[54:56] going to be changed
[54:57] amen
[54:58] it's all part of the same process
[55:01] you must you must be born again i mean
[55:03] you must be resurrected from death to
[55:05] life where it's not your prayer story or
[55:07] the preacher's story of brother braham's
[55:09] story but that same god comes and lives

[1:04:13] that is manifested here that i'm waving
[1:04:15] you saw it you saw it there in jesus
[1:04:17] life he was cut down the first one was
[1:04:20] cut down and waved before god
[1:04:22] amen as a memorial and then that same
[1:04:24] life went into the 120 in the upper room
[1:04:27] and they did the same things
[1:04:29] you know you're this peter and was it
[1:04:31] peter and john whoever it was going by
[1:04:32] the gate beautiful there
[1:04:35] and he's and he's asking for arms he
[1:04:37] asked for money they say silver and gold
[1:04:39] have i known but such as i give unto
[1:04:41] thee in the name of jesus christ rise up
[1:04:43] and walk that same life that was in him
[1:04:45] was in them
[1:04:46] hallelujah amen and when the squeeze
[1:04:49] came against them
[1:04:50] amen they came together and prayed and
[1:04:53] god god crushed down to those powers
[1:04:55] because remember they were beaten
[1:04:57] they were dragged before the sanhedrin
[1:04:59] and they are beaten they said you must
[1:05:01] not preach in his name anymore as a
[1:05:03] pressure
[1:05:04] amen and that pressure was trying to
[1:05:07] come upon them that they would that they
[1:05:08] would stop them preaching in the name of
[1:05:10] jesus christ
[1:05:11] and then so they were beaten they
[1:05:12] rejoiced they came together and prayed
[1:05:15] and god came down and shook the place
[1:05:17] and they were given boldness they went
[1:05:19] out and preached
[1:05:20] amen so god came down because remember
[1:05:23] the enemy was trying to them up
[1:05:25] that that that
[1:05:27] you know that they'd be intimidated
[1:05:29] amen you're following me
[1:05:31] they'd be intimidated so so next time i
[1:05:33] think well we better not we will not
[1:05:35] stand on the street corner or stay in
[1:05:36] the temple let's just have bible studies
[1:05:38] at home or let's just do it quietly that
[1:05:41] wasn't god's program at the time
[1:05:43] amen they came together and prayed and
[1:05:45] god broke that
[1:05:47] pressure that that that they were trying
[1:05:49] to put on them
[1:05:50] amen amen and here we are
[1:05:53] hallelujah we should be bold
[1:05:56] we should be rugged
[1:05:57] and if this world is trying to
[1:05:59] your walk
[1:06:01] amen right if they prayed and god broke
[1:06:04] complexes out of them that the world was
[1:06:06] trying to put on them
[1:06:08] the same thing happens now
[1:06:10] amen when god comes down and you know
[1:06:13] you feel sometimes your fingers get a
[1:06:15] little bit burnt
[1:06:17] amen because people make fun of your
[1:06:19] your family or whatever they do
[1:06:22] don't let your fingers stay burned
[1:06:25] amen
[1:06:26] say
[1:06:27] you gotta say lord
[1:06:29] take this out of me
[1:06:31] amen amen it doesn't mean you go stand
[1:06:34] up and shake everyone and you know use
[1:06:36] no but you know what i mean
[1:06:38] because sometimes you know we're not
[1:06:39] here to compromise with the world
[1:06:41] amen they didn't compromise
[1:06:44] they just walked with god
[1:06:46] amen and whenever the enemy came yo came
[1:06:49] in front of their way they dealt with
[1:06:50] that enemy amen hallelujah
[1:06:54] and that same one lives on us
[1:06:57] amen
[1:06:58] there's a maturing going on friends amen
[1:07:01] amen that same life now i'm gonna you
[1:07:03] know i'm not gonna be too much longer
[1:07:05] but that same life that was in the
[1:07:07] prophet is in you
[1:07:09] amen
[1:07:10] and many times we forget
[1:07:13] we forget
[1:07:15] what god is doing to us individually
[1:07:18] and sometimes we think well yeah the
[1:07:20] devil comes along he puts a shadow over
[1:07:23] it
[1:07:24] if thou be the bride of christ
[1:07:26] how can you say you're the bride of
[1:07:27] christ
[1:07:28] remember
[1:07:29] the bride in this last days
[1:07:31] is the apex of god's new creation
[1:07:35] amen
[1:07:36] because down through the old testament
[1:07:38] remember there was there was a man and a
[1:07:39] woman in the garden
[1:07:41] perfect man perfect woman they fell
[1:07:44] then in the old testament god was
[1:07:45] rebuilding the man
[1:07:47] and that man that he rebuilt that
[1:07:48] masterpiece man was jesus christ amen
[1:07:51] but then that was only the male part of
[1:07:53] the masterpiece brother brown speaks
[1:07:55] about the woman
[1:07:56] as well
[1:07:58] and down through the new testament era
[1:07:59] the woman's being built
[1:08:01] and now here she is
[1:08:03] in her fullness
[1:08:05] but then but then the devil comes along
[1:08:06] says well if you're really that
[1:08:09] how could you really be that look at you
[1:08:11] but we forget god and simplicity
[1:08:14] amen
[1:08:15] you know here comes you know the
[1:08:17] scripture says when the first forerunner
[1:08:19] of jesus comes that the mountains will
[1:08:21] click yo yo yo dance like rams and
[1:08:24] leaves will clap their hands and all the
[1:08:25] high places made low low places made
[1:08:27] high
[1:08:28] and what was the fulfillment brother
[1:08:30] says here's a fuzzy face
[1:08:32] man coming out of the wilderness
[1:08:34] wrapped up in camels camel skin eating
[1:08:37] wild honey and locust
[1:08:40] a man standing knee deep in
[1:08:42] mud in the jordan preaching repentance
[1:08:44] the kingdom of god is at hand and here's
[1:08:46] the fulfillment of that scripture
[1:08:48] because people have in their mind what
[1:08:49] an incredible thing is going to happen
[1:08:50] all the
[1:08:51] land's gonna move all these incredible
[1:08:53] things
[1:08:54] fuzzy face man
[1:08:56] i mean stomps out of the wilderness he
[1:08:58] was the fulfillment that was god in
[1:09:00] simplicity
[1:09:02] amen you got brother bram son has a
[1:09:04] dream of brother brown at the end of his
[1:09:05] ministry
[1:09:06] and
[1:09:07] and brother brahms in in indian
[1:09:09] chieftain garb he's got a big indian
[1:09:11] headdress on he's on this big military
[1:09:13] white horse
[1:09:15] amen
[1:09:16] and that was signifying now i remember
[1:09:18] the chief
[1:09:19] supreme authority
[1:09:21] amen he was the head of the writers
[1:09:24] you're following me so here was he was
[1:09:27] he was now the one who had the
[1:09:30] gospel
[1:09:31] for the age
[1:09:32] a dispensation gospels were given to me
[1:09:34] that's what paul said
[1:09:36] and brother had the same thing amen so
[1:09:38] here was the chief authority on the word
[1:09:41] that god plate remember there's a
[1:09:42] prophet office there
[1:09:43] amen
[1:09:44] and so you think of that dream you think
[1:09:46] what an incredible you know you know
[1:09:49] what incredible ministry this must be
[1:09:50] you know one incredible man and you see
[1:09:52] branham tabernacle
[1:09:54] this little building
[1:09:56] people say it's gonna be turned into a
[1:09:57] garage few bricks put together i mean
[1:10:00] they had to drain a pond and build it
[1:10:01] and all these different things
[1:10:04] amen
[1:10:05] and god had god had things preached
[1:10:07] there
[1:10:09] he says i'm going to tell you what was
[1:10:10] in the back part of god's mind
[1:10:12] hallelujah you don't hear anyone else
[1:10:14] say those things amen but if you look at
[1:10:16] it from the outside you call this a
[1:10:18] church it's just got a flat roof it's
[1:10:20] brick there's nothing special but god
[1:10:22] hadn't built that place there
[1:10:24] i mean god had things recorded there
[1:10:26] that that theologians were giving their
[1:10:28] life to try and find out and they
[1:10:30] couldn't put the pieces together
[1:10:32] and then you know apparently when he
[1:10:34] preached christ is a mystery god
[1:10:35] revealed he had his bible in his
[1:10:36] concordance and that's what he used to
[1:10:38] study for that sermon
[1:10:40] amen and he stands there says now i'm
[1:10:41] going to tell you what's in the back
[1:10:42] parts of god's mind
[1:10:44] hallelujah and what happens now light's

[1:12:01] now as the sun was sent across the earth
[1:12:03] not to bring rocks which was do it also
[1:12:06] to life it was not to bring all dirt to
[1:12:08] life but it was to bring the part of the

[1:12:43] the dirt because the sun was sent not to
[1:12:46] quicken the rock not to quicken the dirt
[1:12:48] but to quicken the life of the seed amen

[1:12:53] it wasn't sent why won't it why why
[1:12:56] won't all people receive it it wasn't
[1:12:58] sent to them

[1:13:01] others he said the seed said that's what
[1:13:03] i'm looking for
[1:13:05] hallelujah so it may not quicken your
[1:13:06] neighbor but it's quickened you

[1:13:39] but he feels the effects of the sun when
[1:13:41] he goes out under the sun
[1:13:43] it takes someone who actually can see
[1:13:45] because the blind man can say what am i
[1:13:47] feeling
[1:13:48] and the guy who can see said it's a it's
[1:13:50] the sun in the sky
[1:13:51] and then the person that feels the

[1:14:30] make peace with it amen make peace with
[1:14:32] god

[1:14:40] so if you have that seed in you
[1:14:43] amen here's the tree says it's going to

[1:15:04] just say lord take it from me in him
[1:15:06] there's no darkness at all
[1:15:09] amen because some people the devil says
[1:15:11] one day you'll be delivered
[1:15:13] one day you'll get rid of that thing
[1:15:16] the devil
[1:15:18] he
[1:15:19] he he puts what he thinks is he he gets
[1:15:21] you to believe as a carrot
[1:15:23] it's it's just over there
[1:15:26] that's what he tries to do he dangles it
[1:15:28] in front of you
[1:15:29] but then you forget what you have
[1:15:31] what you need you already have it
[1:15:34] remember faith
[1:15:35] let's go to romans chapter 10 and i'll
[1:15:37] just close with this scripture
[1:15:52] let's go to verse six
[1:15:54] as i said before
[1:15:56] speak
[1:15:57] don't speak negative things
[1:16:00] amen
[1:16:01] don't speak what you see
[1:16:04] because because if you go in the world
[1:16:05] hey it's all negative
[1:16:07] amen don't speak what you see speak what
[1:16:10] he said
[1:16:11] amen confess what he said
[1:16:14] amen even if it's abraham confess we're
[1:16:16] having a child we're having a son sarah
[1:16:18] we're having a son
[1:16:19] and they got the you know they got the
[1:16:21] nursery ready they had everything there
[1:16:24] 25 years
[1:16:26] but every day he said
[1:16:27] yeah you're every month sarah how you
[1:16:29] feeling
[1:16:30] i'm feeling older
[1:16:32] amen praise god it's going to happen
[1:16:36] hallelujah it's going to happen
[1:16:38] and many people would say you're nuts
[1:16:40] you're getting older you're past the
[1:16:42] time of life
[1:16:43] amen you can't it's impossible for you
[1:16:46] to do it
[1:16:47] and they would say absolutely it's
[1:16:48] impossible for me to do it i'm not
[1:16:50] relying on me he said it it's his
[1:16:52] problem he'll take care of it amen amen
[1:16:57] but the righteousness which is of faith
[1:16:59] speakers on this wise say not thy heart
[1:17:03] who shall ascend into heaven that is to
[1:17:05] bring christ down from above or who
[1:17:08] shall descend into the deep that is to
[1:17:10] bring up christ again from the dead but
[1:17:13] what saith if this is faith speaking the
[1:17:16] word is naive even in thy mouth and in
[1:17:18] thy heart that is the word of faith
[1:17:21] which we preach
[1:17:22] amen
[1:17:24] so faith is saying it's not who's going
[1:17:26] to go up and get it or who's going to
[1:17:27] call them down it says it's actually
[1:17:29] neither even in thy mouth
[1:17:31] amen the what you need to confess
[1:17:34] remember he's the high priest of our
[1:17:36] profession
[1:17:37] he can't move on our behalf
[1:17:40] if we don't confess
[1:17:41] if we don't speak to him to do it amen
[1:17:45] there are many sick people when the
[1:17:48] woman no
[1:17:49] you know the sarah phoenician woman
[1:17:51] she had a woman that was a
[1:17:53] child that was afflicted with the devil
[1:17:55] there would have been other mothers that
[1:17:57] had devil afflicted children in jesus
[1:17:59] day
[1:18:00] amen but she went to him thou son of
[1:18:03] david have mercy on me
[1:18:05] and then because she wasn't a jew she
[1:18:07] said lord have mercy on have mercy on me
[1:18:11] if she didn't speak that he never would
[1:18:14] have delivered her
[1:18:16] amen you think about it
[1:18:18] he would have just continued walking on
[1:18:20] and she would have been oh my child my
[1:18:22] child what shall i do
[1:18:24] amen she had to speak to him
[1:18:28] amen for her to get healed yes sir the
[1:18:31] centurion had to go
[1:18:33] to jesus my servant's sick
[1:18:36] he says he says you're not even
[1:18:39] i'm not even worthy that you should come
[1:18:40] into my house just say the word and
[1:18:42] he'll be made well that's gentile faith
[1:18:45] say the word lord
[1:18:47] amen and and all shall be well
[1:18:49] if he never
[1:18:51] if he never would have went there his
[1:18:53] servant would have still been sick
[1:18:55] i know oh well that's obvious yeah you
[1:18:58] got to bring it into today
[1:19:00] if you don't if you don't confess his
[1:19:02] word back to him
[1:19:03] amen if you don't speak his word he
[1:19:05] can't act on your behalf i mean so what
[1:19:09] we must never do is just wallow and all
[1:19:10] this is going bad and this is going bad
[1:19:12] sure it may all be going bad that
[1:19:14] confess is worth it lord you're in
[1:19:16] control you're my healer you're my
[1:19:18] delivery you're my provider you're my
[1:19:20] head amen you're my protection yes sir
[1:19:23] hallelujah it doesn't matter if you feel
[1:19:25] nothing confess it anyway yes sir amen
[1:19:28] amen because god's looking for faith and
[1:19:29] you don't feel faith
[1:19:31] hallelujah
[1:19:33] that's what we must do and then he can
[1:19:36] act upon your behalf amen
[1:19:38] amen
[1:19:40] and faith says it's the word is not even
[1:19:43] in thy mouth
[1:19:44] what does it say
[1:19:45] in other words i don't need to get it i
[1:19:47] have it
[1:19:49] amen
[1:19:50] and it doesn't matter what condition you
[1:19:52] think you're in that's irrelevant
[1:19:54] amen

[1:20:07] know the guy on a pilgrimage thinking
[1:20:08] you have to go
[1:20:09] seven steps and then maybe you may be
[1:20:11] worthy to get it no
[1:20:14] you're not even in the equation
[1:20:16] faith in you is in the equation and he's
[1:20:18] given you that faith amen amen so just
[1:20:21] speak the word in faith confess the word
[1:20:24] yes sir i mean never speak negative
[1:20:26] things
