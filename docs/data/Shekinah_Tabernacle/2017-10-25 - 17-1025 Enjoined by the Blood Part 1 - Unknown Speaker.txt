god bless you thank you musicians I mean God bless you all it's good to have everyone here tonight good to have Susanna here god bless you just feel at home but they have brother Chris off the boat too god bless you I mean I I know you part of the furniture but it's always good to see you so you know amen let's go to first John chapter 1 I want to read from here so first John chapter 1 verse 1 that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life for the life was manifested and we have seen it and be a witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us that which we have seen and we have heard declare we unto you that ye also may have fellowship with us and truly our Fellowship is with the father and with the son Jesus Christ and these things right we unto you that your joy might be full and let's go to the book of Hebrews chapter 9 but notice just as you're turning there the only way that you can that John could be a witness of eternal life as any more than just seen it but he received it but we've seen eternal life manifested in this hour let's go to Hebrews 9 and we're in verse 16 and this may be two different very piece of Scripture but hopefully I pray the Lord will tight together he seasoned in Hebrews 9 and in verse 16 it says for where a testament is there must also have necessity be the death of the testator for a testament is of force after men are dead otherwise it is of no strength after all while the testator liveth whereupon neither the first Testament was dedicated without blood when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law he took the blood of calves and of goats air with water and scarlet wool wool and hyssop and sprinkled both the book and all the people to notice what the blood was sprinkled on the book and the people saying this is the blood of the Testament which God hath a joined and joined unto you moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry and almost all things are by the law purged with blood without shedding of blood there is no remission I mean may the Lord bless his word you may have your seats tonight in the presence of God now the Bible we know the message in the Bible it's more than stories it's more than doctrine but it's a manifestation of a life it's a manifestation of eternal life you know this message brother Brahim says you you know if you listen to Christ as a mystery of God revealed he speaks about how God was unfolding himself all the way down through the lives of believers from from Genesis down into got into this hour and he was revealing his coming and it was expressed in every every type of the Bible the coming of the Lord so it was a life that was manifested you know I was listening to to Christ the mystery of God revealed last weekend in it but this week and I realized Christianity is a life I know as maybe may sound a little bit simple but Christianity is a life manifested that is eternal life that is manifested you know and it's more than just learning a Creed or a Dogma or doctrine but it's a manifestation of a life now the Bible says in Romans chapter 10 it says faith cometh by hearing and hearing of the Word of God now but faith I mean but hearing is not faith but faith cometh by hearing the word so you can audibly hear the word but that won't give you faith it's got to go beyond just hear some decibels ringing some-some air waves moving into your ears but those words have got to enter into your heart and that gives you faith so faith is not hearing but hearing faith cometh by hearing of the word of God okay so it takes more but then when you receive that faith what should it produce it should produce a life and it must produce a life that's all God is interested it is not interested in what we think we know it's him inside of us manifesting himself and brother Pam he speaks in the crisis of mystery Labor's quite a lot upon upon revelation and how divine revelation has been given and it sovereignly given by God to a people I mean just for you to recognize your lost and undone you need salvation that's a revelation I mean that becomes known to you because more than a story that becomes a living reality and you feel a burden of your sin and you are gonna and yes they are going to do something about this and you and the reason that burden comes on is because God has already paid the price he already shed his blood and you've just got to give it to him God you died for me Lord I receive your salvation I mean but it's faith that cometh by hearing and you've got to believe you're a sinner I meant and then you going to believe he can save you and before there is a sinner there was a savior hallelujah so before you a lost there's one that have found you I mean there's one that could find you hallelujah he speaks very quite a lot about how the the church is built upon the rock of Revelation and he would go to Matthew chapter 16 you know the scripture very well where Jesus asked the disciples who do men say that I am and they say some you say your Jeremias or a Liars or what are the prophets but he asked the question who do you say I am and it's the same question I'm I've seen this before but I'm going to say it again it's the same question that's laid before you know who do you say this is I mean who do you say this is that gave the message brother BAM said I wanted to be a trapper I know this is not pure he said he said I don't I didn't want to do this I just wanted to be a trapper but he became a prisoner to the word he does not mean it speaks he sinks it is God that speaks these things but you've got to have that anchor in your soul it's not a man from Kentucky that that learned your divisor a new way of life buts God declaring himself and you've got it really because Christ is the same in every generation but you've got to see him in your generation right so the church is built upon the revelation of who Jesus Christ is I mean so if you know who he is you're built upon the rock hallelujah I trust I'm I'm talking to some people who are not built up on sand of man's ideas that are not connected together like brother Isaac bored out so well I'm having upon the rock one piece hallelujah because of its a rock you know if he is a revelation to you every doctrine is actually one it's not it's not different connecting you know different ideas floating around in a pile but it's one rock and it's a person I mean which is Jesus Christ now but it's very important because you got to understand now what should revelation produce brother Brahim scenes in Christ and mystery God revealed he says it's a personal individual affair with the person that Christ is revealed to them and if you say he's been revealed to me and then the life that Christ produced here in the Bible that same life is in him does not produce itself in you then the wrong revelation Amen if you put a life of a pumpkin into the life of a pear tree it would be a pumpkins by their fruits you shall know them exactly right and if the first you put out you put out of a tree a grapevine it would put out a bunch of grapes the first shooter puts out brought forth grapes the next one brought out lemons leaks on board out peers the next one brought out apples there's some kind of a graph to the fear in there that's bearing its own life every denomination will be a life of itself but if that original vine ever puts forth another shoot it will be a grapes just like the first time so I says now if the river if you say well I've got a revelation what life is producing because it's more than just quoting quotes and quoting scripture and dressing right and acting you're trying to act just right but what life is subconsciously living out amen because the fittest effort is the if you have the revelation of who Jesus Christ is it will produce the life that's in the Bible but if you do not have that revelation you have a man my made idea it will not produce the life of the Bible and you have the wrong revelation amen and that is exactly you got to take your life back what is it what is my life presently producing right what is it producing what character what nature do you have we have to have there is one Lord one faith one baptism and we've been restored to that faith hallelujah now I've just got this written in the Bible but brother Bram in the church age book this is not I just wrote this in here cuz I make notes he sees this well I write things down he says this this isn't page 328 of the church age book he says now so wait before I read this Malachi forced me to turn our hearts back to the original faith the anointing that was in the Prophet is to turn us back to the original faith because it's the anointing as the Ministry of Elijah turns the people from one thing to another when Elijah came the first time and it was on Mount Carmel that says he rebuilt the altar of the Lord because that remember an altar in the Bible is an approach to God if you make the right kind of altar the right kind of sacrifice you can approach God the right way in the Old Testament and it says I'm outcome well he rebuilt the older so it was there but it wasn't neglected and it fell down you know and to enter a period he put the sacrifice on and the water and everything that he did he says Lord let them know that thou art God and I've done this according to your word and now has turned their hearts back again it says he prays those exact words and you read him first kings thou turn their heart back again then the fire fell holy and then they saw her really was God amen and it's the same thing that's the same thing happened in this day I mean the the right approach to God was rebuilt the altar was rebuilt I mean stone upon stone of Revelation then you've got to lay yourself upon that and you've got to die and the fires gonna come down and consume you that's what it has to happen you can't just lay there on the altar it's no longer I that liveth but Christ liveth in me it must be that way and John the Baptist he turned the hearts of thee of the father's to the children there's a turning going on now what caused the turning there was the word that was preached caused attorney well you know John the Baptist he preached he said the ax is laid to the root of the tree he didn't say just have you ever seen a big big tree trunk is one actually in taro a massive tree trunk and a little trees growing out of the tree trunk I don't know what wrote it so it's a massive tree trying this little thing Greg that's been cut off with his little than growing up what's happened the roots the X wasn't late to the roof it was just late to the truck see he was saying you say you had a grub out you got to get rid of the whole thing yeah heck out the whole thing every tree that doesn't bring forth fruits can be cast into the fire and those words was just as good today as they were back then but he began to preach the coming of the laws at hand was and then what happened hearts were being turned by the anointing that traveled on the word that he released now he says in the church age book now this messenger of Malachi 4 and revelations 10 7 is going to do two things number one according to Malachi 4 he'll turn the hearts of the children to the father's and He will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelations 10 which are the revelations contained in the seven seals it will be these two finally revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children through the Pentecostal fathers here's exactly so now that doesn't mean you've got to you know understand what doctrine is but there's a there's an anointing in the word right there's an anointing that that's released in the end time that's why it's more than understanding you know it's like even the Apostles they heard the preaching of John the Baptist and their and their heart was turned their heart was turned because they left what they did and they started following John and then John pointed out the Lamb of God they started following him and then after John was in prison his head was cut off they said shouldn't Elias must first come and he and Jesus says he's come already you didn't even know who it was it says then they knew it was John the Baptist they didn't even understand now oh this is John this was the forerunner but their life came under an influence and their heart was turned they lived out the fulfillment of John's ministry hallelujah and they didn't even know hallelujah that's how important it is Spirit of God begins to move and people that before you even if we consciously realize I'm being turned I'm walking a different Road God's got ahold of me hallelujah isn't that amazing if they didn't even fully he got read it in the Bible they actually asked Jesus isn't Elijah mean to first come and they have actually the very purpose of his ministry therefore filth because they're following the Messiah what happened because his anointing released in his preaching and turn their hearts now and this is the same with the with the word that's come open now there's an anointing in that word and it literally will turn our hearts back to the faith of the fathers exactly so and I'll declare it tonight if you haven't realized you know if you've really come under the influence of the Holy Spirit and your life has been changed not even you're doing it's his doing it's your tense desire not even your desire and your life is changing and look back and say I was going this way then my life turned sideways and walking this way and following the pillar of fire into a rapture you got to realize your hearts been turned I mean that your heart has been turned the original faith hallelujah how that's happening - we haven't been we're not in the we're not in the process of the turning the bride's heart has been turned hallelujah it's like brother Barry comes down to the end of his ministry he's talking about you know anyone can lay a wall you're a brick you're a brick like and Larry wall takes a Master Mason to turn the corner and then he comes to the end near the universe mercy says now we're turning the corner and at the end like in leadership he says now we've turned the corner and with hearing heaven on the face how Louie's try to tell you this is where you are your roadmap I mean you can see because this is why the Prophet came oh I love it so much this is a road map it's a love letter and a road map where we're led by divine love there's a road map but if you don't know where you are on a map how can you find out we have to get to it's like if you gave me a map of Wellington I didn't really know Wellington all that well and say you just got to travel there just say you got to get Tootsie Pop or someplace this is your destination but then you got to say but where am I cutting from because otherwise you'll be wandering around trying to find a landmark some way to see where you are that's why God send a messenger in this day this is where you are on the roadmap this is your destination I mean we've turned a corner we're steering heaven on the face just keep walking children and you'll be there hallelujah sour hearts have been turned amen now and it's produced this word is producing a character and a people never belittle what God has done for you and what he is doing Alleluia now whenever people come under an influence of of of the anointing and the age it is to fulfill something now we read we read how Moses Paul is speaking about Moses he he sprinkles the book he sprinkles the people with the blood and saying this is the new this is the covenant which God has enjoined to you so there was a word now this law this law remember there was actually I know it's I know we view the law as a negative thing in surely and it's just a policeman that just puts us in jail but there's power in that law under the blood of bulls and goats they had power Moses Moses overthrew a through a kingdom under the blood of bulls and goats Caleb took his mountain under the blood of bulls and goats joshua said sun and sun and moon stand still under the blood of bulls and goats I mean Gideon's three hundred you know had a mighty victory under the blood of bulls and goats Elisha you know totally destroyed the prophets of bail under the blood of bulls and goats hello Lou you can just keep going down through the Old Testament that's under the blood of bulls and goats under the blood of bulls and goats here Zak I was under the blood of bulls and goats hallelujah they were just this is a shadow so there was power in that words yes param that word and God was and joining by a sacrifice he was he was connecting the people with that law saying you cannot be separated anymore the blood has joined you in the book together hallelujah member the part of the book he really wore them to be is you'll dwell in your land you'll be my people at all be your God that was whole purpose of the law I'm going to place you in your inheritance I'm going to walk among you hallelujah I'm going to cover your sin by the blood of bulls and goats I mean why don't chase a thousand to chase ten thousand hallelujah that was the purpose of the law hallelujah under the blood of bulls and goats say Amen David took the whole land under the blood of bulls you guys I know the blood of bulls ago Solomon built the temple and they at peace hallelujah so he connected it and then the sort of people that really receives like Caleb and Joshua I mean out of their generation something happened to them we are more than able that's God but once they saw the obstacles they saw the Giants they saw the walled cities I mean they saw the same things that the other spy saw but the other spy said we cannot take it and they said God has given it to us let's go up at once under the blood of bulls and goats I mean because that law Amy wasn't joined to them by the blood I mean that they would fulfill what that law did the purpose of the law was they would be in their land and be living with God even though God was separated from him you know he couldn't come into the into them like us there was a separation but God wanted his people he wanted to be among his people hey follow me that was the purpose of the law hallelujah that's what God came you okay came to Moses and they gave the law and it'll yo because God wanted to walk walk among them hallelujah so it was those Caleb and you can't just you know I want this mountain I don't know inspiration struck and when he saw the promise I want that promise I want that mountain there's a resurrection mountain maybe there was nicer places in the promised land but he wanted that place hallelujah does the same thing with you and I you know there's easier maybe I don't know what but there's something in us assist I don't care what this world says I don't care what anyone else is I want to go on a rapture I want to be buried in Christ hallelujah just like yo Joseph and them yo Joseph said when you leave this place and you will take my bones don't leave me in Egypt bury me in the promised land here's a property of spiritual he knew the erection was going to happen there he knew the Messiah was going to come for hallelujah and there Matthew 27 when Christ arose and many of the Saints arose Joseph arose hallelujah amen cuz he is he is living under that same inspiration I mean why did the law why did they take them into the Promised Land there's a resurrection in that place under the blood of bulls and goats holily that's happening for someone to come and clear the deed amen that's where the lamb set forth hallelujah he paid the price and full he wiped off all the debt he said come children you've been waiting a mouth I was thinking today about medgen imagine being there your paradise and then I mean John comes out John comes through the door who are you young I mean who's the skies yes I'm John the Baptist what did you do I was the voice of one crying in the wilderness oh really to prepare the way of the Lord yes and I pointed a live out I saw the dog descend upon him he looked like any other normal man Russell the doctor said to put him like God said and he came and got baptized when the dog came down and I said he must increase I must decrease hallelujah do you think there'll be some excitement going on you think that'd be all boys hallelujah Adam Young was it uh Abel had been there the longest hallelujah but he died under the blood of bulls and goats he died under the lamb that he offered well Alou yeah Enoch was there they're all there and finally and then and then soso no doubt have been excited what did he do what he looked like when he say hallelujah glorious time and then the thief on the cross double are you a saint your son Greg King no well who are you as a thief eyes on a cross who's hanging next you a hard Mammootty is condemned by so more than a man next to me I said Lord Supreme One remember me when you come into your kingdom hallelujah God he would have been happy they would have been even more happy what do you mean was he diagnosed here yes he was dying Oh boys hallelujah brother sisters he's shedding his life upon the earth he's going to clear the deed in David which words will be sitting there left the up ye gates and be lifted up to the King of glory will come in we're going to fulfill that soon hallelujah that someone else comes in the door he's got keys on the side hallelujah says come children you'll be waiting long enough let's go up hallelujah and there seem that I'm high Amen then David save me I was inspired to write this fellow's mood and here's the gates that I saw and and I'm the voice of saying lefty up ye gates and be lifted up and here's the King of glory I'm living out this hallelujah you know how we get so excited God comes down you might read the scripture about the rapture or whatever promise God just comes down in it that allows you to you know he was saying brother Branham was saying I come in what's him and I was listening to he says like a blind man who's never seen the Sun he doesn't know what the Sun of these never been in that realm of vision you're seeing he's never seen anything he walks outside and he feels something on on the skin he said what is this what is this warmth what is this feeling I don't know I can't see I can't put my I can't put a water because I've never seen it before then someone comes out who can see I'll tell you what you're feeling you're feeling the Rays of the Sun what's the Sun it gives life hallelujah it's rays give life it gives warmth hallelujah that's what you're feeling and then here we are we feel God come down not just in here wherever you are

you are and you can't maybe not but you can feel the race of the SOA Palelei yeah that's why we're to profit in the stay can you see him over there person over this person is here with us down hallelujah and that to me that's like seeing plastic curtain at time because he said where I am there you'll be with me let's read that let's go to John 14 hallelujah we've seen with many eternal life has been manifested that life was in the bosom of the Father has been manifested and it's more than just two thousand years ago or in 1948 to 1965 and recorded you know in the Ministry of the Prophet that same life is here that same God is here I mean that same God as as with you hallelujah that same angel of God the angel of the Covenant aiming to bring you into your inheritance hallelujah is with you amen I happen to believe that with all my soul amen if we were you know if we were there in Israel you know following the pillar of fire it say I felt that presence before and it's not distance from me made me I'm so glad I look back in that favorite that same angel that same God that lead them amen is leading us individually hallelujah he says in John 14 and one do you know who's leading you all Jesus is leading me yeah he's a Living Word he's the Alpha and the Omega before Abraham was he says I am saying to describe the phrase the same God yep now we can just go down to verse 4 but that's good he says let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me and my father's house are many mansions now we know a house and the King James's is a kingdom so my father's Kingdom are many mansions F or not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there you may be also and whether I go no and the way you know so now he says where I am NOT where you are not in this in this realm but where he is and brother Graham says heaven is just like up here it's not that far away remember he's on his bed saying Oh God oh yeah yeah he says he's getting old boy you better start if you want to do same for God now you'd better hurry up here's a voice you want to see past the curtain of time he says just helped me so well and before he knew it he was there and he was you know he saw he said his old carcass he used the word old carcass was lying on the bed and he was back here as young again he said oh it's just up here by the doorpost howl ooh you just going faster than this dimension us now amen sit so that's where it now Jesus was a little higher than that member he said I want to see Jesus he's just a little bit higher oh man this is where I am there you'll be also I'll come again to receive you unto myself hallelujah and that's why it's so glorious this message is the receiving it's not doctrine it's Christ receiving it a bride I many seem to work to make it with that spot or wrinkle I mean to manifest the victory of Calvary and we see that victory in our lives I trust you do we can you can look in the mirror and say I'm without spot and without wrinkle I've been washed in the blood of the Lamb not just a part of me all of me all of me is being dipped in the fountain of of Emanuel's blood hallelujah has it happened to you happened to me one day I'm still in that fountain I don't want to get out glory to God sit down so he so he did that now because remember we're washed by the water of the work that's not that's not man's word that's God's word when God speaks through a ministry through his Bible through the messages God speaking the voice of many waters it says and that voice is the voice of the ministry crying out hello Lee crying out against wrong shot in the real way showing the way the truth and the life hallelujah and then that's why we come and we can even just yo you come to church you've had a week and you're kind of walking spiritually a bit like this and then the devil gets cast off and you have a glorious time hallelujah you get washed boy to God let me not to be in church all the time not he washes you he's not gonna leave you half unwashed you follow me you have confidence in who you you know who's leading you see says I'll come again to receive you unto myself that where I am know what you are where he is hallelujah Amen so this message is Jesus Christ it's not doctrine it's not a prophets idea it's Jesus Christ declaring himself it's the son of man revealing himself and the day when you see sodom and gomorrah on the streets in the days of lot you know in the days of Noah so shall be when the Son of Man is revealed and we live in that day amen where we're living in the root of time of the revealing of the son of man and it was revealed it was revealed that a prophets ministry let's go to Jude errata me I think 29 this is one of my favorite favorite scriptures I think I'll say that every time but hey I like it all oh dear that's where I get a bit undone oh yes it is do you draw two not one so remember G Dharana me is Moses giving like his last sermon to the people and he's about to go up the mountain and die so this is they've had 40 years they've walked with God 40 years they're at a 40 year journey from Egypt to this point the people have and it says these are the words of the Covenant which the LORD commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab beside the Covenant which he made with them in Horeb and Moses called unto all Israel and said unto them ye have seen all that the Lord did before your eyes and land of Egypt under Pharaoh and unto all the servants and to and unto all his land the great temptations which thine eyes have seen the signs and those great miracles yet God has not given you a heart to perceive and eyes to see and ears to hear and to this day and I have led you 40 years in the wilderness your clothes are not waxen old upon you thy shoe is not waxing old upon thy foot you have not eaten bread neither have you drink wine or strong drink that you might know that I am the Lord your God so they had been walking forty years and you were to think before this moment they would have thought I understand it we've been 40 years in this message we've been racing this message our grandchildren maybe maybe that I don't yeah maybe they had grandchildren as well well even just children Wisco children the children say I've been racing this message I've been racing this wilderness I don't know what Egypt is I was born outside of Egypt and they would think I've heard it all I understand it all but most say no God hasn't given you a heart to have to perceive is to hear eyes to see until this day because as we walk with God he opens his word to us he opens his word for every stage of the journey and as we walk with him he reveals himself amen that's why it's more alive today than it was you know when it was even first preached many people you look waiting food for the discernment and the miracles and all these things and he God was revealing himself through his word sir a prophet he was declaring things and many people didn't catch it then why because it had to be a time where God where the people walked with God themselves where the Prophet was taken out of the way that the people could walk with God themselves hallelujah so that's why now the wood becomes more love and I pray it does to you this message is so much more alive to me then now than it was ten years ago Amen that means more to me hallelujah just gotta dig it and have a face I mean why just take a little bit of a roast wouldn't get the whole leg hallelujah watching amen have the whole buffet I'll just take a nurse is the shift take the whole thing what's wrong with my cooking what's what a chef would say try it oh yeah I want you in heaven oh and God wants you to get into it to enjoy it's for you I meant this word this is God's covenant being declared hallelujah Amen so it gives them overcoming power the word gave Caleb and Joshua it was enjoined to them by faith by the blood of the bulls and goats and they became one with the promise and they manifested their promise amen that was under the blood of bulls and goats now here we are here we are in the cellar it's a wonderful day because we live in a time where if we go to revelations chapter 10 there has to come a time where we become one with the promise we don't just look upon it we don't just say well brother Branham says and talk about his testimonies to pass on else's testimonies but that same life that was in him which was in Jesus Christ manifests into you and then it's no longer someone else's story it becomes your story there's no longer someone else's testimony it becomes your testimony so it doesn't become someone else's promise or someone else's covenant with God it becomes your promise in covenant with God I mean because remember it was every it was even in the Old Testament yes there's half the tribe of manasseh and some other tribes they settled on the east of Jordan some of them did who knows the Bible some of them did but then when they went to take the land those ones that are read sealed in their position went forth before everyone armed so they went forth to help their brethren take their inheritance amen and that is now the burden of those who know him because life has to go forth I mean last time life just can't be contained you see in life you see when spring comes you know the Sun comes a little bit closer to our side of the earth and you know the soil temperature gets a bit warmer and the days get longer and life comes for you can't stop it coming forth it must come forth it's the same thing with eternal life it must go forth I mean you can't bottle up brother Brown said it's like it's like a house on fire in a windy day I mean you can't put it out you might just spread it I mean spread the fire that's just like the believer that's why the 120 in the Upper Room when God came into them eternal life doesn't the bosom of the father and it was manifested to them they didn't just say well praise God hallelujah licious they should stay here another day now they ran out of that place they said this is that spoken by the Prophet Joel probably in the last week forth and he's the same today as he was big you can't you can't help it there's something in you saying people have got to receive this you say well I don't know how to put the words to it just tell them how your candle got lit tell them what became real to you because when you test the five things have become real to you it becomes even more lives Amen there's power and testimony yes revelations 10 and we'll read from verse well we won't read the whole thing because I think time is escaping us but you read the whole thing many people like to just talk about revelations 10 1 1 to 7 where the covenant angel comes down with the open book you know it says but the days of the voice of the seventh angel verse 7 with all the mysteries when he should begin to sound the mysteries of God should be finished as he has to clear those servants the prophets but that's not the whole chapter they start the whole chapter that's been fulfilled that same angel that came down that's the Holy Ghost coming there's all symbolic it's not it's not something else then because the same Holy Ghost that came on the day of Pentecost was the same Holy Ghost that led Moses and the Israelites from Egypt to the promised land you read in Hebrews 11 that Moses forsook Egypt to follow Christ that's the same God that's the same God Malachi 3:1 says I'll save my mission before my face and he'll prepare the way before me and the Angel of the Covenant whom you delight and shall suddenly come to his temple whose angel the Covenant the same one that led them from Egypt to the promised land which is Christ which Moses followed and that same God was in the fullness of his manifestation in Jesus Christ and went into 120 the upper room and went forth same God not a different one I'm it's like this mighty angel the same angel the Covenant comes down upon the earth hallelujah because he wants to know the promise the promise of a restoration amen of Adam and Eve on the earth again Adams been the second Adam was manifested as Jesus Christ but there's got to be a second Eve both of em talks about the bride as the second part of the masterpiece hallelujah so she's got to be upon the earth member to life if you've got the wrong revelation you won't produce the right life but if you have the right revelation you'll produce a life of Christ amen it's got to be the same life and the husband as in the wife hallelujah so now that's what it must be oh my okay so now this angel comes down with his open book but then in Revelations 10 8 it says in the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again now remember John I'll just read it again he says go take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the scene upon the earth and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book me but this is this this angel is Christ himself right the the one that stands upon the sea and the earth this is the Covenant angel there's all symbolic remember we're not literally eating bits of Indian paper with ink on them right it's all symbolic okay and I went to the angel and sehun to me give me the little book and he said unto me take it eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter and it shall be in thy mouth sweetest honey and I took the little book out of the Angels hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I'd eaten it my belly was bitter why cuz purging out of your life and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings now John himself after he wrote the book of Revelation after the book of Revelation came to him he what history says he was released from Patmos he went back to Ephesus and he pastored the church until he died he didn't he didn't fulfill the scripture John and the book of Revelation is a symbol himself and John is a symbol of you John is a symbol of you that's why that's why I chapter one it shows where you are because it's John and he hears a voice behind him he turns he sees seven golden candlesticks and the Son of man walking between the seven churches so it's after the seventh at the end of the seventh church age he's gone past there and he turns back and God biggest revealed to him this is where you've been then after the latest in church age he hears a voice in heaven saying come up hither I'll show you things that must come to pass and he and it's a rapture of the church revelations four and one right and so he's raptured up after the end of the seventh age hello this is where you are on the map right this is where you are on the map and so now John is a symbol in the book and so John is told take this take this book be a tit become one with it and in prophesy and speak its contents amen speak its contents speak speak what it is what is it now at Liberty a do believe message I mean a jubilee trumpet I mean there's not just people coming from a natural slavery to back to their inheritance but the whole earth is groaning and waiting for the manifestation of the sons of sons and daughters of God because when we come to out because a manifestation is revealing right so when we are fully revealed what's in us I mean then when we come to our place then nature can come back to its place I mean because the king and queen are restored upon the earth and their nature can come back to its place hallelujah that's why we are told you must become one with him that's what the symbol means right the symbol means you got to become one with him I mean in their and their book is your inheritance right just like Moses and the yeah with the blood of bulls and goats he he sprinkled the book and the people with the sacrifice with the blood to join them together I mean him by the blood of Jesus Christ he takes out he returns right and he joins us together with that inheritance and those who are really joined with it live it out they manifest what's in the book I mean so healings in the book I mean pieces in the book I mean piece of puzzle understanding is in the book joy unspeakable full of glories in the book I mean speaking in tongues is in the book prophecies in the book and mean wisdoms in the book the servants in the book hallelujah all the gifts are in the book I mean our position and crisis in the book hallelujah everything that the promises in the Bible are in this book hallelujah and then you've began to find yourself manifesting those promises Amen where C is Satan will be under your feet it's in the book hallelujah that we'd be in we'll be in heavenly places in Christ Jesus that believers volition it's in the book and you were going to find yourself living a different kind of life hallelujah because you're manifesting the promises in the book and you can't help it because it's in you Helen you can't help it because it just because the manifest hallelujah because it's all in the book I'm in the raptures in the book I'm in applying the truck and it's in the book I mean bringing you that that's watts and the shadows with Rahab and different once hallelujah because it's the promises in the book but as that was a shadow of this gonna become a reality hallelujah just like David coming David became king they possess the fullness of the promised land I mean so when Jesus Christ becomes king payment in your life you possess all the promises because it's in the book I mean everything Adam losses being restored it's in the to the infants in the book and the blood is join you to the book you've got to manifest what's in the book I'm repeating those words a lot because I want you to really I wanted to sink in Helle all the promises are in there I'm in a first Munir in his life it must manifest itself hallelujah isn't that right amen yeah we're not walking in darkness he said to be an eagle anointing in the sage amen we know from Genesis 2 we know from eternity to eternity holy we're not stumbling in darkness because it's in the book it's in the promise hallelujah we're not wandering around I mean we know who we are do you know who you are him have you been lifted up that's why we can look beyond just the carnal flesh of each other I mean that's why we can see each other in Christ I mean because you can look beyond the flesh and personality and what people do I mean you can look beyond misunderstanding put us in the book hallelujah amen win hut stumbling around a darkness reigns it's all in the book you say well you're saying a lot of strange things you just become one with him and it becomes plague holy be got to recognize his life remember as I've set a place hit it many times but if I lift you an inheritance I was Bill Gates and I could leave you everything and I could actually give it to you in my lifetime I'd make sure you get it because it's because this is my heart being put on paper I want to give you place your name here my entire fortune all of my assets all of my possessions all of my company all of my income everything I have I give it to you now you would want to make sure that person receives it because you've given them everything everything that you have labored - together you want to give it to them hallelujah and now here's our Lord Jesus Christ before the foundation world he thought of you I'm in the lamb was flammable the foundation of the world and many saw you perfect maintenance image hallelujah washed in the blood of the Lamb treading on the devil treading on the devil hallelujah being victorious overcoming him with the by the blood labor would are your testimony this is his inheritance to you now do you think he's just gonna you know like send a little imagine sending that by snail mail just to just to say Isaac Lee New Zealand I won't put a stamp on it it doesn't matter you know I may just sending it haphazardly that's crazy that's not what how God does he Mack he comes personally he doesn't just send it through the mail he comes personally to you here's your inheritance receive your inheritance hallelujah that's why he's here this way that's why he's here in the form of his word color everything is is prison heavens not just in heaven heavens on earth I mean and the believer hallelujah that's why he's here because he so wants you to know this is your promise this is yeah just like Joshua and Moses they place this is this is Israel's position this is my wife's position this is Edom babe they said this is their boundaries this is this is where there this is where Egypt does all these things and then he comes a profit on this day he says look as I was with Moses I shall be with thee so he had to Joshua Commission and as a third Exodus he had of Moses he had a Moses Commission as well call the people out we're in an exodus second part of his ministry was a Joshua Commission the word places the people in the land hallelujah so now if that's the case you know sorry that's why when he's preaching he says this is what the wise virgin gets this is what the fullest version give me this is what the church gets is what the beast gets is what the nomination he's laying he's placing everything this is what the devil is I mean this is what this is what everyone everyone gets a portion hallelujah and you just happen to find yourself in the best portion I mean cuz this is what the wise were wise virgin get you get to rapture I mean she gets a bridegroom I mention gets a husband she gets the king of kings and Lord of lords she becomes married to him I'm in the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife has made herself really and you happen to find yourself living that scripture out I trust you recognized a what'd he say well had had on I'm living it up because I've indicated prophet stood upon the earth and he preached the word and eleazar call he says this message a man will introduce the bridegroom he says the bridegroom call this is was the bridegroom call will come right through this and I say amen amen and then you hear that word and something moves in your heart you begin to be turned amen and then and then how you speak and how you dress and what you say in your life and your nature and the things you love and that all changes what's happening because you've come under a promise I mean you're being dressed hallelujah I'm not just telling you

II it's more than just a interpretation it's an anointing big relief amen he stood there and he preached that and he speaks about those that hear it on tape he knew it go around the world but had to go around the world he knew that you would he knew you'd hear it I believe because because the I got it he says there are those that hear it in the jungles he spoke about people in Africa walking with little tubes and there is listening to it I don't even think they had even near the technology in those days amen I mean for in Vanuatu there's a brother when I first went up up there one of the northern islands very remote place they virtually have nothing and they store like they have cyclones go through they still breed fruit keep it dry that when a hurricane comes through whatever destroys everything they have got food but we gave him both Adrienne gave an mp3 player he put some tubes in his ears he say I'm gonna go to our other other garden to get you some watermelon what did
