[37:46] okay let me over vet you okay anyway so
[37:52] C is here from sin Corinthians for 16 to
[37:55] 18 for which cause we faint not but
[37:58] though our outward man perish yet the
[38:01] inward man is renewed day by day for our
[38:04] light affliction which is but for a
[38:06] moment worketh for us not against us for
[38:10] us a far more exceeding and eternal
[38:14] weight of glory while we look not at the
[38:17] things which are seen but at the things
[38:19] which are not seen for the things which
[38:22] are seen are temporal but the things
[38:24] which are not seen are eternal amen
[38:28] let's just bow our heads in a word of
[38:29] Prayer gracious Lord Jesus how thankful

[38:34] together as a people Lord and we can
[38:37] sing songs of Zion Lord to give you
[38:40] praise and honor and glory Lord with
[38:42] such Thanksgiving in our hearts that
[38:44] you've made a way for us Lord that you
[38:47] Lord that Satan had us bound but you set
[38:49] us free our own way and we're on our way
[38:52] to heaven shouting victory Lord it's we

[38:56] reality Lord we are living out that song
[38:58] and we thank you Father that and we just
[39:00] ask as we have opened the pages of your
[39:03] word and we've read some scripture lord
[39:04] I just pray you would come and anoint
[39:06] your word one more time father an
[39:08] anoints pker in here Oh Lord anoint your
[39:10] word to our souls father Lord that it
[39:13] would change our lives Lord that we
[39:15] become more like you may you grab that
[39:17] father may you meet every need that's
[39:19] here and Lord also be with those who are
[39:22] away father may you watch over them keep
[39:24] them safe Lord bring them safely back
[39:26] home father we just want to commit them
[39:28] into your hands Lord and if there's any
[39:30] sick among us Lord may you touch them
[39:32] father and heal them look because we
[39:34] know by your stripes we were healed it's
[39:36] a finished work and we thank you for
[39:38] that father in Jesus Christ's name ayyy
[39:40] just come and take the service under
[39:42] your divine control we ask in Jesus
[39:44] Christ's name we pray amen
[39:46] I mean God bless you all you may you may
[39:48] have your seats this morning amen I want
[39:55] to I trust everyone had a blessed camp I
[39:57] mean it was a tremendous time I'm there
[40:00] thankfull what the Lord did for us
[40:01] they're bringing us all together healing
[40:03] wounds
[40:04] you know our God always goes well beyond
[40:08] our expectation amen and just to you
[40:11] know see the Lord come down and do
[40:13] everything he did was tremendous
[40:15] I mean some very thankful for that but
[40:17] uh but now we know we're in another week
[40:20] I mean we've got another battle to face
[40:22] you know we've had a time of refreshing
[40:24] and the wonderful thing is we don't just
[40:26] look through the rearview mirror and say
[40:27] well he did wonderful things back then
[40:29] he's still the same today he's still the
[40:31] present God today you know he's not a
[40:32] god of history Amen but he's the I am so
[40:35] we're thankful that we are not just
[40:37] looking in the rearview mirror because
[40:39] as we read there and Zephaniah sees the
[40:42] Lord that is in the midst of thee is
[40:43] mighty Amen and that is that makes the
[40:46] difference worth with people as of God
[40:48] as in them it's that changes everything
[40:50] he's the important one we've come to see
[40:52] today he's the important one that we
[40:54] worship we don't worship one another and
[40:56] then we don't we're not interested in
[40:58] anything like that we're we're here to
[41:00] worship God and it's just like Israel
[41:03] when they when they journeyed from from
[41:05] Egypt unto thee into the promised land
[41:08] and Moab you know Israel was journeying
[41:11] through the land of Moab and Moab was
[41:13] you know they were even though they were
[41:15] related to Israel because Moab came out
[41:18] of lots daughters you know but they they
[41:21] were jealous of Israel they didn't like
[41:22] them they treated them as an enemy and
[41:24] they knew they could not fight them with
[41:26] a natural army because other armies had
[41:27] been defeated so they went and got the
[41:30] the Prophet Balaam to try and curse
[41:32] curse Israel but we know that he could
[41:35] not curse them but you know as as as the
[41:37] attempts three attempts were made for
[41:39] for Balaam to to try and curse Israel
[41:44] you know the king of Moab you know took
[41:46] took Balaam around so it says the hind
[41:49] of parts of Israel you know to the not
[41:51] so good-looking parts of the
[41:52] congregation that because he thought
[41:55] surely that because a prophet your God
[41:57] anoints a prophet and God speaks through
[41:59] that prophet that surely if if their
[42:01] prophets or the bad parts of the
[42:02] congregation then that would justify the
[42:05] Prophet cursing Israel but then when
[42:07] when God anoints that prophet he says I
[42:10] see no iniquity and Jacob Amen
[42:13] they were offering burnt sacrifices for
[42:15] their sentence you know they they they
[42:18] were you know they had sin in the camp
[42:20] they'd all different kinds of things
[42:21] going on because they had to sacrifice
[42:23] all the time to cover up their you know
[42:25] yo that blood to cover up their
[42:28] sins but when God looked down at us at
[42:30] your ad as people as says I see no
[42:32] iniquity in them and this is the God
[42:33] that sees all things I mean in the
[42:36] difference was because the shot of the
[42:37] king was in the camp that that was the
[42:40] important thing you know Moab you know
[42:42] Balaam sacrificed the same way Moses did
[42:45] they had the same ol ters they had the
[42:47] same sacrifices they had the same
[42:49] approach to God but the difference is
[42:51] that God was in the midst of Israel amen
[42:54] and that's why that's why we should be
[42:57] so thankful I mean that God you know God
[43:01] walks among us not just a one time event
[43:05] every day every service God comes down
[43:09] God speaks to us God draws us higher God
[43:13] refreshes us God casts out the enemy God
[43:16] breaks complexes God brings healing
[43:19] Goblin's restoration I mean we should be
[43:21] thanked appreciate him thank you Lord
[43:24] use don't come one time and then we're
[43:25] looking in the rearview mirror a member
[43:28] you but you're present among us all the
[43:29] time Amen so now I want to speak a bit
[43:34] about you know when God comes to people
[43:37] someone else could be right next to them
[43:40] but the person that God comes through
[43:42] the hole their whole world changes and
[43:44] the eternal comes down into this realm
[43:48] and and gets ahold of someone you know
[43:51] when heaven opens there's the reason no
[43:54] it's one or maybe go a little bit you
[43:56] know we know that in Eden heaven was
[43:59] upon the earth there was no gulf between
[44:01] Adam and Eve and God everything was
[44:04] perfect there was no separation there
[44:06] was no distance there was no sin but
[44:08] then when sin came into the when yo when
[44:10] sin came into the earth amen creation
[44:14] fell and then they came a gulf between
[44:16] God and man and so now heaven was now a
[44:21] distance from man right and then it's
[44:24] season you know it's season
[44:28] Genesis chapter 5 that the line that
[44:31] came from Adam and Eve it said then man
[44:33] began to call upon the name of the Lord
[44:35] because they were looking they were
[44:37] calling upon him God when are you going
[44:39] to restore the fellowship
[44:41] I mean eat and when are you going to
[44:42] restore it when are you going to bridge
[44:44] this chasm that what Adam and Eve told
[44:47] yo will tell us the testimony when you'd
[44:49] come down in the cool of the evening and
[44:51] you'd have fellowship with them and
[44:53] there was no there's no heartache there
[44:55] was no sin there's no remorse there's no
[44:57] regret there was no anything bad and it
[45:00] was just perfect it was just perfect
[45:01] union between between you and your
[45:04] children and they called upon God
[45:06] because they're saying God when are you
[45:08] going to restore this when are you going
[45:10] to bridge this chasm when is Heaven
[45:13] going to come down again when is heaven
[45:15] going to open up amen and give an answer
[45:18] to since since problem and we know
[45:21] ultimately Amen that that that that
[45:24] Amazing Grace was manifested in Jesus
[45:26] Christ hallelujah where where the answer
[45:29] to sin was shown and the man Jesus
[45:30] Christ and the and the chasm was golfed
[45:33] hallelujah the bridge was Christ amen
[45:37] where heaven opened amen enter people
[45:40] who once separated from God became
[45:42] reconciled and we can see this also in
[45:45] the in the time of Moses where where
[45:48] Israel was down in Egypt and they were
[45:50] slaves for about 400 years and they but
[45:53] they had a promise god gave their
[45:55] therefore bear abraham a promise that
[45:57] they would sojourn in a strange land for
[45:59] hundred years but but i would bring them
[46:02] out with a mighty hand and bring them
[46:04] back into this land and so they came a
[46:06] time where there was 400 years had had
[46:08] had we you know was coming to a time and
[46:11] they begin to call upon God those those
[46:14] ones who were really had a burden they
[46:17] they received they received I don't know
[46:20] if the you know we know Moses wrote the
[46:24] Bible but we don't know if it was
[46:26] actually written down before then so
[46:27] they maybe just received an oral
[46:29] tradition and maybe they were there in
[46:31] their slave Hut's and they begin to
[46:33] speak about the promise that God gave
[46:35] Abraham and something anchored into some
[46:37] of them amen this promise is true
[46:40] it's more than just a nice story but
[46:42] it's going to happen and we know Moses's
[46:45] parents by faith they had they had Moses
[46:48] sing he was a proper child something
[46:50] happened when he was born they knew he
[46:52] was the deliverer I mean they saw they
[46:55] received a direct answer Amen from the
[46:58] prophesy that this baby that they just
[47:00] you know we're holding this was the one
[47:02] that God was going to use to deliver
[47:04] Israel amen out of Egypt and take them
[47:07] into the Promised Land
[47:08] now when many baby boys were born before
[47:10] that time but this was different
[47:14] it's a heaven open an answer came from
[47:17] heaven this is the fulfillment of
[47:19] prophecy and Dara would have been a lot
[47:22] of deliveries you know our babies as I
[47:24] just said and everyone would have been
[47:25] special but this was different
[47:28] he was prophecy now became flesh are you
[47:32] following me
[47:32] amen and then you can come and then you
[47:35] go all the way down through even when
[47:37] Moses is there and God comes down on
[47:40] Mount Sinai and God's dealing with the
[47:42] people and they saw mighty signs and
[47:45] wonders his Joshua standing there
[47:47] Korah Dathan are standing there
[47:49] different ones are standing there and
[47:51] for one something happened to him and
[47:54] caleb was standing there and and when
[47:57] they received when Moses was standing
[47:59] there preaching the preaching the law
[48:01] that he received on the mountain and
[48:02] telling the people that God has
[48:04] delivered you out of the out of the
[48:06] slave masters hand because you're going
[48:08] into a promised land a meant for a
[48:10] couple a quickened to the assaults and
[48:13] they became alive saying this is my
[48:16] promise I mean I'm going to inherit this
[48:18] promise because God has given me this
[48:20] promise I mean they said let's go
[48:22] possess a land at once but others heard
[48:25] the same words and they said well we're
[48:26] not able to take the land Amen because
[48:29] their confidence was in their own self
[48:31] we are grasshoppers in their sight
[48:34] that's that was their testimonies we are
[48:37] grasshoppers on the side of the people
[48:39] that live in the land we cannot do it it
[48:42] wasn't their job to do
[48:43] I mean God said I give you the land you
[48:45] just go fight for it you say well what
[48:48] does that mean they have to do it no God
[48:50] will fight the battle you just got to go
[48:52] and step to the battle for
[48:54] you follow me it's not a contradiction
[48:57] they had to go fight the battle but who
[48:59] was ultimately fighting the battle for
[49:01] them I mean you're gonna put your you
[49:03] know you're gonna pick up your sword
[49:05] I mean you'd pick up your sword you're
[49:07] gonna pick up your shield of faith put
[49:09] on the whole armor of God you can't
[49:11] leave it in the cupboard someplace you
[49:13] know I read a saying one place never
[49:15] trust a knight in shining armor because
[49:18] he's never used it
[49:20] never trust a knight in shining armor
[49:22] he's never he'd never been in battle I
[49:24] mean where's the where's the marks on a
[49:26] shield where he's right yo you know
[49:28] defeated some blows yo or maybe on this
[49:30] helmet or a breastplate if it's perfect
[49:33] it's never been used and well how can
[49:36] you trust someone who's never been in
[49:37] battle Alleluia that's why when we when
[49:41] we when we go to heaven friends I trust
[49:44] we're gonna have some battered shields
[49:46] some battered helmets hallelujah a sword
[49:50] maybe with a few you know knocks in it
[49:52] where it's been pairing some your blows
[49:54] from the enemy you know we're gonna have
[49:56] some rugged equipment but it's seen us
[49:59] through hallelujah amen
[50:02] so now a tankard into Caleb and Joshua
[50:05] is hot and they could see now they could
[50:09] see the lamb belongs to them now you say
[50:12] well this is just a this is just a heads
[50:16] up quite a thing no it's not a haphazard
[50:18] kind of thing because we read in we read
[50:20] in seeking Corinthians that can we can
[50:26] we go back to that maybe could I do it
[50:32] now I can't do it down okay I'll just
[50:36] leave this look now eternal things while
[50:40] we look not at the things which you seen
[50:43] but the things which are not seen for
[50:45] the things that are seen a temporal but
[50:48] the things which are not seen are
[50:49] eternal now this world I'm just going to
[50:53] God's Word is eternal God's Word is
[50:56] eternal everything else will change so
[51:00] we have to change how we look at things
[51:02] that only the eternal things are real
[51:05] this this world is
[51:08] pass away amen even if even if you could
[51:12] say just say this is actually not true
[51:14] it is true well so I sort of put this
[51:18] out to you even if this is not true and
[51:20] there's not a rapture and there's not a
[51:22] Great Tribulation in the Bible sense
[51:24] there is a world war three coming you
[51:26] you just look at the natural way of
[51:28] things are it's going to be a nuclear
[51:29] war one superpower is going to go down
[51:32] and another superpower is going to rise
[51:34] the world order is going to change and
[51:36] it is changing so this world is changing
[51:40] right whether we like it or not it is
[51:42] changing because it's just a temporal
[51:44] thing this world is changing but God's
[51:47] Word is eternal so now we have to look
[51:50] at what does god what does god's would
[51:53] be cleared because that is the only real
[51:56] thing actually you say well but I'm in
[51:58] this body I see you I hear your voice
[52:01] you know I know the seat oh man I'm very
[52:04] conscious of where I am but all those
[52:06] things will change all those things will
[52:08] change they are not real because
[52:11] there'll come a time where this is no
[52:12] more this building won't be here this
[52:16] pulpit won't be here we won't be here in
[52:18] this form because it's changed it's gone
[52:22] and and and if time would continue to go
[52:25] on we wouldn't even be a footnote in
[52:27] history because the world has changed
[52:30] but God's Word is eternal and it's only
[52:34] the eternal that matters and Caleb and
[52:37] Joshua when they were standing there
[52:38] hearing God's eternal word came out of
[52:40] their prophet they read they they I
[52:43] believe received a revelation that is
[52:45] true that is real this world is passing
[52:49] there once slaves but they weren't in
[52:51] that condition anymore the world changed
[52:54] that was temporal their slavery was
[52:56] temporal their slavery is temporal amen
[52:59] but the promise of God to them was
[53:01] eternal amen
[53:03] so now we should look at the things that
[53:05] are not seen we live a very supernatural
[53:08] life the Bride of Christ I'm talking
[53:12] about you that believer lives a
[53:14] supernatural life
[53:15] we don't live a natural life amen we
[53:18] live in a supernatural world even the
[53:20] unbeliever
[53:21] they live in a supernatural world but
[53:23] they're just not conscious of it
[53:25] amen that that the unseen is affecting
[53:28] the seen I mean behind everything people
[53:32] do there's a spirit that's motivating
[53:34] them it's not their own idea yes I'll do
[53:36] this and older the snow and influence
[53:38] comes and you got to really think when
[53:40] you look at something and you say I
[53:42] really like that that can be a harmless
[53:44] thing just like there's and you know and
[53:47] you just take something like you know
[53:49] how like interior yo you know de chord
[53:52] changes now and you say I like that now
[53:56] I'm just using a harmless example that's
[53:57] what do you think about it and then you
[53:59] think well where did the inspiration
[54:00] come that that affected that person that
[54:04] now they like this and now I like it and
[54:06] there's nothing wrong with it you know
[54:07] trends change right but there's an
[54:10] influence that came from somewhere that
[54:12] affected somebody and now that influence
[54:14] is being transferred to me right and
[54:17] it's the same thing with with the things
[54:19] of the Lord there's an influence that
[54:20] came from somewhere that influenced
[54:22] somebody and now the influence is being
[54:24] channeled through that person to me and
[54:27] you look at now and then you gotta trace
[54:29] back the steps now where did this
[54:31] influence come from right you got to
[54:34] look at where it came from because if it
[54:36] came from heaven and will produce
[54:37] heavens results which is the Word of God
[54:39] amen but if it came from the pit if it
[54:42] came from man's ideas amen all the all
[54:45] denomination is in the Bible you take it
[54:47] back it's the Tower of Babylon it's
[54:49] confusion well these people say this and
[54:52] these people say this and these people
[54:53] think this and these people back up
[54:55] their idea with hundreds of years of
[54:57] tradition and and and scholarship and
[54:59] and these people well not so much but
[55:02] they have a more broader overview well
[55:04] which one is correct which one is the
[55:07] right one you won't find it there
[55:11] because it's man's ideas and man's
[55:13] thinking and it's now well this is how
[55:16] it should be no but you got to trace it
[55:18] back now where did that cover its just
[55:20] confusion but when God comes and he
[55:22] declares his word he strip wretch it
[55:24] comes behind it to say this is me
[55:26] speaking this is me doing this this is
[55:28] not this man doing this or these people
[55:30] this is me the the God that's in the
[55:34] midst of thee is
[55:34] my tea Ella lujah he's my tea so you got
[55:38] to look at now where's this influence
[55:40] coming from where's the semblance coming
[55:42] from and it's not taking you to a
[55:44] tradition it's not taking you just to a
[55:46] nice Church culture it's taking you to
[55:49] Almighty God they meant the eternal is
[55:53] affecting this this natural world
[55:57] hallelujah
[55:58] God is here I just maybe say well you've
[56:02] heard this all before we we have to
[56:04] recognize now time is running out an
[56:07] eternity and time of blending together
[56:10] we've come a time when time is running
[56:12] out and the kernel is blending with this
[56:15] world a mint why do you think now this
[56:19] is all over the world you look at
[56:21] churches fifty years ago 40 years ago
[56:24] fighting hard god still moved a little
[56:27] bit but then now we're in a different
[56:29] season there's a refreshing being poured
[56:32] out this is this is not just these four
[56:35] walls this is all over the world
[56:36] God is the season is changing the season
[56:40] is changing where now God is moving in a
[56:44] far greater way than he did in the past
[56:45] you know the same God that we hear on
[56:48] tape is the same God that's here I mean
[56:50] they're very same God that same Lord
[56:53] Jesus Christ that anointed the prophet
[56:55] of God is anointed as people today I
[56:57] meant that the son of man was revealed
[57:00] in one man but now he's revealed in a
[57:03] multi-member body I mean that same God
[57:06] that a nod to the Prophet he said I'd
[57:08] love to go back to those days I'd rather
[57:10] be now I mean because there's a people
[57:13] that have come together and they've
[57:14] taken their position in the body of
[57:16] Christ that now God can manifest through
[57:18] a people and their because that's what
[57:20] God wants to show that he can take
[57:23] people with their own will this is God's
[57:25] victory I want you think about it God Oh
[57:27] God
[57:28] God takes people with their own will and
[57:30] their own ambitions and their thoughts
[57:31] and their plans and and they God moves
[57:34] upon their hearts and they give their
[57:35] will over to him and then God takes that
[57:39] person that surrendered their will they
[57:41] become a love president of Jesus Christ
[57:43] and God places him in a body and then he
[57:46] brings you know you know one part of the
[57:48] body
[57:48] of Christ then he takes another person
[57:50] the same thing happens to there may be
[57:52] different testimony but the end result
[57:54] is the same
[57:55] and God places them here and God takes
[57:57] another person and he places them here
[58:00] like one's a deacon maybe one's a song
[58:01] leader ones you know you know ones in
[58:04] the sunday-school
[58:04] once you see creating an atmosphere in
[58:06] the pew and a prayer warrior I mean once
[58:10] helping with the children once playing a
[58:11] insert ones maybe saying god bless you
[58:14] were so happy to see you I mean we are
[58:16] and it's all different gifts everyone is
[58:18] gifted everyone has a gift everyone has
[58:21] a part to play you all have a part to
[58:24] play in the body and then God takes you
[58:26] a place you in the body and then God now
[58:28] is now manifesting himself not just
[58:30] through one but through many and they
[58:32] all walked work together as one amen
[58:36] that's a miracle
[58:37] we everyone has their own ambition their
[58:39] own personality their own what they
[58:41] think and they just give it over and God
[58:44] play see of uncomplimentary and it's
[58:45] like we're a bunch of ants or bees just
[58:47] just working as one one mind one heart
[58:51] one accord hallelujah that's a glorious
[58:55] thing and God is showing see Satan this
[58:57] is what my victory produces I don't have
[59:00] to trick them into anything
[59:02] I don't deceive them into serving me I
[59:04] mean but they willingly give give
[59:06] themselves over and they love me
[59:08] [Music]
[59:09] Alleluia amen the eternal things are
[59:13] real we can go to we can go to people
[59:16] like Isaiah which is Isaiah chapter six
[59:20] he says when the in the year that King
[59:21] Uzziah died I saw the Lord High and
[59:23] lifted up in the temple maybe we could
[59:25] have been standing there in the temple
[59:26] with Isaiah but something was going on
[59:28] with Isaiah I mean he had the visitation
[59:31] he saw the Lord High and lifted up that
[59:32] changed his life I mean when the eternal
[59:35] when heaven opened spoke to a man and he
[59:38] was so gripped by what he saw is a voice
[59:41] saying who go for us he says here I am
[59:43] Lord send me his whole life was changed
[59:45] amen he came down to a point at the end
[59:49] of his life that he was putting a log
[59:50] and soreness under all because of that
[59:53] visitation it so gripped them because
[59:56] the eternal he realized only the eternal
[59:59] things are real yeah brother Bram went
[1:00:01] past the curtain of time
[1:00:02] he saw the redeemed ones and he said I
[1:00:05] could never be the same person after
[1:00:06] that visitation and I happen to believe
[1:00:08] he went there amen
[1:00:10] if he could stand there and tell people
[1:00:12] what's wrong with them and their address
[1:00:14] you know God would show him different
[1:00:15] things and it never failed once and I
[1:00:17] happen to believe you we'd be on the
[1:00:19] curtain of time and he wanted us to know
[1:00:21] that there's a land beyond the river
[1:00:23] that it's more real than this world I
[1:00:26] mean because this life is but a vapor
[1:00:28] but that is eternal I mean we just in a
[1:00:31] little space of time time is just such a
[1:00:34] actually a short thing not just talking
[1:00:36] about our 70 years were allotted and
[1:00:39] maybe more maybe less you know but you
[1:00:41] just take time the seven thousand years
[1:00:43] and whatever times been going on for
[1:00:45] creation you know from Genesis and
[1:00:47] whatever more you know it doesn't matter
[1:00:50] it could have been billions of years but
[1:00:51] it's still short compared to eternity
[1:00:54] it's just a little space of time and God
[1:00:58] allowed Center coming that creation
[1:01:00] would drop at a time and then now here
[1:01:02] we are in the space of time and God is
[1:01:04] molding us I'm thankful you know I was
[1:01:07] thinking about I was I was in part or
[1:01:10] mall and I was thinking what if everyone
[1:01:12] was a believer and on one hand you think
[1:01:16] this would be glorious but I sing on the
[1:01:18] other hand we wouldn't have any
[1:01:19] character we wouldn't be molded into his
[1:01:23] image amen there'd be no sickness
[1:01:26] hardship sorrow pain you you know you
[1:01:31] know you and have days where you wonder
[1:01:32] where am I going what's going on in this
[1:01:35] situation you wouldn't have any of those
[1:01:37] days you say well I would like to not
[1:01:39] have any of those days but in those
[1:01:41] times God is molding and he's shaping
[1:01:43] you and your characters being being
[1:01:46] developed and you're becoming more like
[1:01:48] him amen because he wants to reveal
[1:01:51] himself this this and the message which
[1:01:54] are one to me it's an expression of one
[1:01:55] person Jesus Christ I mean this is this
[1:01:58] is see this Bible man tries to read it
[1:02:01] like a textbook but it's no it's a
[1:02:03] person being revealed it's it's Jesus
[1:02:05] Christ Almighty God making himself known
[1:02:07] and so now if he's got a part of himself
[1:02:11] and he wants to you know he wants us to
[1:02:13] know that he is he is our guide
[1:02:16] he is our comforter he is our victory
[1:02:19] well how is he our victory because he
[1:02:22] won the victory for us he's our healer
[1:02:25] he's our Redeemer he's the lover of our
[1:02:27] souls he's our husband I mean he
[1:02:30] understands our burdens that's why he
[1:02:31] became a man amen he was tempted in all
[1:02:34] points like like we attend to but yet
[1:02:37] without sin
[1:02:38] so anything that man may be tempted with
[1:02:40] by the world he was tempted in the same
[1:02:42] way amen he understands what you go
[1:02:45] through you know next year I'm well
[1:02:48] actually this year I always get it mixed
[1:02:50] up there I'm gonna be 33 Jesus was my
[1:02:53] age I've been thinking about recently he
[1:02:55] was my age he was the Messiah he was my
[1:02:58] age upon the earth and you know he
[1:03:02] understands what it's like to be my age
[1:03:05] anyway I'm glad he understands us don't
[1:03:07] you
[1:03:09] now the eternal things are real now can
[1:03:12] we go back sorry can we just go to the
[1:03:13] next now this is right after what we
[1:03:18] just read eternal things we look to the
[1:03:21] unseen we should be looking to the
[1:03:23] unseen for we see that if our earthly
[1:03:27] House of this Tabernacle were dissolved
[1:03:29] we have a building of God a house not
[1:03:31] made with hands eternal in the heavens
[1:03:34] for in this we groan earnestly desiring
[1:03:38] to be clothed upon with our house which
[1:03:41] is from heaven if so be that being
[1:03:44] clothed we shall not be found naked now
[1:03:46] we'll go the next one soon now when he
[1:03:48] talks about a house sorry can you go
[1:03:49] back our brother Armand he talks about a
[1:03:51] house he's not talking about four walls
[1:03:53] and three bedrooms and a kitchen and
[1:03:54] dining room whatever he's talking about
[1:03:56] a body the house he's talking about as a
[1:03:59] body amen
[1:04:01] he's saying we have though this one be
[1:04:03] dissolved I have one in the heavens
[1:04:06] already so he's just been talking about
[1:04:08] that the eternal things we look to the
[1:04:11] unseen we look to the eternal realm and
[1:04:14] because the things that have seen a
[1:04:15] temporal so he's going from this now
[1:04:17] he's saying now but though this temporal
[1:04:20] body be I'm just living a bit though
[1:04:23] this be dissolved we have one eternal in
[1:04:26] the heavens
[1:04:27] amen waiting already
[1:04:30] that's why we should look to the unseen
[1:04:31] we should be now in a way you think we
[1:04:34] should be bulletproof what do you think
[1:04:38] the Apostle Paul he could say I've been
[1:04:40] shipwrecked I've been beaten I've been
[1:04:43] robbed I've been score you know I've
[1:04:46] been put in prison all these things but
[1:04:48] then here after this big list he sees
[1:04:50] but none of these things move me none of
[1:04:52] these things move me and the reason he
[1:04:55] said no those things move him is because
[1:04:57] he knew he had a body in heaven amen
[1:04:59] that it wasn't maybe on its way it was
[1:05:01] already there and though this would stop
[1:05:04] beating and he was in in life would
[1:05:05] leave this he had a place to go to
[1:05:08] hallelujah and so his whole life now was
[1:05:11] changed that when he had the experience
[1:05:14] on the road to Damascus heaven opened
[1:05:16] heaven opened to him hallelujah
[1:05:19] where once he just learned about God and
[1:05:21] he was a great scholar and a learn the
[1:05:23] scripture but then heaven opened and the
[1:05:25] author of the one that you you're the
[1:05:28] author of the word that he thought he
[1:05:29] knew became real to him and then so he
[1:05:32] so fixed his course I'm glad I'm glad he
[1:05:36] didn't have a flowery beard of ease I
[1:05:38] mean that he could live a life where God
[1:05:40] would say I'm going to take a redeemed
[1:05:42] son and I'm going to show you amen
[1:05:46] what happened what happens when someone
[1:05:47] becomes a love prisoner he he speaks
[1:05:50] many times Paul a prisoner of Jesus
[1:05:52] Christ and he wasn't talking about just
[1:05:54] being in a dungeon he says I become a
[1:05:56] prisoner I've surrendered my will and
[1:05:59] I've been taken captive
[1:06:01] hallelujah amen aren't you glad amen
[1:06:05] he became a love prisoner so wherever
[1:06:07] God would lead him he says I'll follow
[1:06:09] and none of these none of these temporal
[1:06:13] things a beating is temporal oh just
[1:06:16] this just dwell on this one for a little
[1:06:18] bit we know bad things happened to us
[1:06:20] and maybe just say heat yo he was beaten
[1:06:24] or whatever maybe maybe there are no
[1:06:26] scars after that but then and espírita
[1:06:30] could still go back to that time right
[1:06:33] so the so the natural wounding can be
[1:06:37] gone but then it be a spiritual wounding
[1:06:40] but you've got to look at those things
[1:06:42] and saying that's temporal
[1:06:43] that's a temporal thing it's not an
[1:06:46] eternal thing are you following me
[1:06:49] I meant we can have bad experiences and
[1:06:52] they can sit with us for years and
[1:06:53] decades but you've got to take that
[1:06:55] thing and say that's temporal don't let
[1:06:58] it move you as he told Timothy a man he
[1:07:02] said stir up the gift that's within thee
[1:07:04] stir up that gift of faith
[1:07:07] Amen I hope we're not falling asleep
[1:07:11] amen you know stir up that gift of faith
[1:07:13] don't look at the natural don't look at
[1:07:15] the temporal things don't look at what's
[1:07:18] going on stir up that gift of faith
[1:07:20] because the same God that called Paul
[1:07:22] called Timothy hallelujah and so Timothy
[1:07:25] knew the same God pulled it and we can
[1:07:28] come down to our age and God raised up
[1:07:30] another love prisoner he showed in a
[1:07:33] prophets life this is what Calvary does
[1:07:36] I mean this is a real-life prisoner and
[1:07:40] then and then many things affected him
[1:07:42] but none of them moved him Alleluia and
[1:07:46] God was showing in that life this is how
[1:07:48] we should be none of these things
[1:07:50] friends we have a we have a our
[1:07:53] footsteps have been ordered from from
[1:07:56] now till the body change they have been
[1:08:00] ordered God knows your next step you may
[1:08:03] not know where you're going to go you
[1:08:05] may be have a lot of questions but he
[1:08:06] knows your next year
[1:08:08] he knows where you're going to go he
[1:08:10] knows the situation that you're gonna
[1:08:11] you know face he knows the battle you
[1:08:13] may be entering into even now he knows
[1:08:16] it and you've got to keep this
[1:08:18] confidence this is temporal this is
[1:08:21] passing away amen the eternal things are
[1:08:24] real amen eternal things are real this
[1:08:28] is not real this is not really reality
[1:08:31] you say well that's a big thing to say
[1:08:33] no this will pass away now we know
[1:08:41] people the reason the Apostle Paul said
[1:08:44] oh wait let's go I will read that soon
[1:08:51] when when God came down in Moses and
[1:08:55] spoke to the children of Israel and
[1:08:58] Caleb and Joshua said let's go take the
[1:09:00] land they the reason God came down there
[1:09:04] was to show them their place in the
[1:09:06] scripture their place in the scripture
[1:09:09] was they're going to possess the
[1:09:10] promised land that was their promise God
[1:09:12] came and showed them their position in
[1:09:14] the scripture right and you can take the
[1:09:17] same thing with the Apostle Paul he said
[1:09:19] that I'm a light to the Gentiles
[1:09:21] he knew has preserved he knew what he
[1:09:23] was job to do he said a dispensation of
[1:09:26] the gospel has been committed to me he
[1:09:28] knew who he was in the scripture Jesus
[1:09:30] that knew who he was in the scripture
[1:09:32] right and so now God has to come to us
[1:09:36] because before God comes to you and
[1:09:38] shows you who you are and here you can
[1:09:42] maybe guess at it you can maybe think
[1:09:44] this belongs to me but then when he
[1:09:46] comes and makes it real to you a lot of
[1:09:50] a lot of people heard Isaiah's prophecy
[1:09:52] a virgin shall conceive and a lot of
[1:09:55] fathers maybe said that's going to be my
[1:09:57] my young you know you know my girl is
[1:10:00] going to be that one
[1:10:01] but then for 800 years about that
[1:10:04] promise was sitting there and then the
[1:10:07] angel Gabriel came to Mary heaven opened
[1:10:10] if I heaven open God yo you know a
[1:10:14] messenger was sent for the principle
[1:10:16] mighty God I've come to tell you Mary
[1:10:18] you're going to have the promised son
[1:10:20] amen you are the vision that shall
[1:10:22] conceive and she said well how's this
[1:10:25] going to be the Holy Ghost will
[1:10:26] overshadow you
[1:10:27] and make this prophecy become a reality
[1:10:30] and she just says let it be unto me
[1:10:32] according to thy word and so she began
[1:10:34] to find out this is your position in the
[1:10:36] scripture amen
[1:10:38] this is your position in the scripture
[1:10:40] and so weak God comes down when God
[1:10:44] comes down to you didn't brother Brennan
[1:10:47] he's worrying about his life he's
[1:10:49] running way he's a certain way and then
[1:10:52] an angel comes to the presence of
[1:10:54] Almighty God he says I've come to from
[1:10:56] the principle my regard to tell you
[1:10:58] about your peculiar birth and to expand
[1:11:01] clarity this is why you're this way do
[1:11:03] you think do you think he ever thought
[1:11:05] when he was there you know living living
[1:11:07] in America do you think Eve imagine I'm
[1:11:09] gonna go pray for Kings I'm gonna you
[1:11:13] know he's already pastoring the
[1:11:14] tabernacle before he was called to the
[1:11:17] international realm do you think even
[1:11:19] mentioned I'm going to God is going to
[1:11:21] take take me and it's going to be a
[1:11:23] healing revival going to sweep the world
[1:11:25] and this message is going to introduce
[1:11:27] Jesus Christ do you think you would I
[1:11:29] don't know but possibly not because it's
[1:11:31] far greater you know God has a lot
[1:11:34] greater things when you look at when
[1:11:36] when God looks at you and he says you're
[1:11:40] my bride you're virtuous sinless never
[1:11:45] do it when I thought of you never did it
[1:11:47] in that first place amen I made you in
[1:11:50] my image amen when there's a people that
[1:11:53] are on streets of gold and it's and it
[1:11:56] says about in Revelations 19 the
[1:11:58] marriage of the lamb has come and his
[1:11:59] wife has made herself ready amen that's
[1:12:02] gone from a prophecy that's now a
[1:12:04] reality amen and God has to end but then
[1:12:08] you'd imagine you know I don't know well
[1:12:11] I wasn't a Christian really I never
[1:12:13] thought about spiritual things before
[1:12:15] God got ahold of me but you know I don't
[1:12:17] know about you being raised in church
[1:12:18] would you ever think I'm going to be
[1:12:20] fully in his image I'm going to conquer
[1:12:22] say yo Jesus is hit his death on Calvary
[1:12:26] will cause me to conquer Satan amen
[1:12:30] because Satan was defeated that day
[1:12:32] he'll be defeated in my life because he
[1:12:34] worries done and I'm going to take a
[1:12:36] rapture I don't know if you thought
[1:12:39] about it but then God comes down to you
[1:12:41] in this hour through this message and
[1:12:44] he's telling you now Amen I'm come to
[1:12:49] give you clarity about your
[1:12:50] misunderstood life that you would
[1:12:53] understand truly what you mean to be
[1:12:57] amen this is what this message is called
[1:12:59] to do not only did God come to the
[1:13:01] Prophet and tell him this is this is the
[1:13:03] reason you're this way amen but then he
[1:13:06] also through this message tells you hey
[1:13:08] what has everyone following me what I'm
[1:13:10] saying I'm getting some looks like where
[1:13:12] are you going with this
[1:13:14] you know before God became real to me I
[1:13:19] all my thinking was in temporal things
[1:13:21] I'm from this country this is my natural
[1:13:25] family this is the career I want to do
[1:13:28] this is maybe where I want to live this
[1:13:31] is what I'd like to go do in life
[1:13:34] that's all temporal things isn't it I
[1:13:36] think God cut and then that's kind of
[1:13:38] man's thinking this is what this knows
[1:13:40] about this much but then there's his
[1:13:42] whole eternal realm and then God comes
[1:13:44] down to he came to me and he began to
[1:13:48] tell me no that's just temporal this is
[1:13:52] not your in destination amen your
[1:13:55] eternal right your eternal so now now he
[1:13:59] opens he opens your eyes of
[1:14:01] understanding that you begin to think
[1:14:03] I'm not just not just natural things but
[1:14:06] they even come to realize now now you
[1:14:09] come to realize I'm going to hear them
[1:14:11] there's a rapture for me he's going to
[1:14:14] make me he's going to make me in as
[1:14:15] image I have an eternal body waiting for
[1:14:19] me though this earthly won't be
[1:14:20] dissolved is one waiting for me already
[1:14:22] hallelujah amen and then you're so so
[1:14:26] your whole your whole life changes
[1:14:28] because you look at the worlds very
[1:14:29] differently
[1:14:31] Alleluia now let's go to sorry can we
[1:14:39] put that back up for we know that if our
[1:14:45] earthly House of this Tabernacle were
[1:14:47] dissolved we have a building of God a
[1:14:48] house not made with hands eternal in the
[1:14:51] heavens for in this week groan earnestly
[1:14:54] desiring to be clothed upon with our
[1:14:56] house which is from heaven if so be that
[1:14:59] being clothed we shall not be found
[1:15:00] naked now for the next one for we that
[1:15:03] are in this tabernacle do groan being
[1:15:05] burdened not that we would be unclothed
[1:15:08] but clothed upon so this is why we're
[1:15:12] burdened because they want to go see him
[1:15:13] right we want to go see him but clothed
[1:15:17] upon that mortality might be swallowed
[1:15:19] up of life now he that hath wrought us
[1:15:23] for the self same thing as God who also
[1:15:26] hath given unto us the earnest of the
[1:15:29] Spirit
[1:15:29] wherefore we are always confident
[1:15:32] knowing that whilst we are at home in
[1:15:35] the body we are absent from the Lord for
[1:15:38] we walk by faith and not by sight we
[1:15:43] have a body the reason the reason this
[1:15:45] now this message was to call you that
[1:15:48] your life would be aligned up with that
[1:15:50] body the reason that God has called you
[1:15:53] you say well why am i Christian well I
[1:15:55] went to this meeting or I heard this
[1:15:57] tape or this person witness to me and
[1:15:59] then I in a chain of events comes along
[1:16:01] and then you find yourself maybe getting
[1:16:03] baptized and your life has changed and
[1:16:05] you know and then if we just look at it
[1:16:07] naturally you say well it's just an
[1:16:09] order of events
[1:16:09] I say it's beyond that as God is calling
[1:16:13] there's a body there for you and the
[1:16:16] reason that there is a deep there's a
[1:16:17] call I mean there's a response is a
[1:16:20] giving of your life over it's because
[1:16:22] there's a body in heaven Alleluia
[1:16:25] that now you have to align with that
[1:16:26] body amen and then many times brother
[1:16:29] brown speaks about it he says he says
[1:16:32] that God you have a you have a something
[1:16:34] that you need in your spiritual diet I
[1:16:36] mean that that you would become
[1:16:38] spiritually growing amen and then he'll
[1:16:41] put something on the ministers you know
[1:16:43] hardened mind to preach because you
[1:16:45] needed it just like this you know just
[1:16:48] like when we eat natural food we need a
[1:16:50] balanced diet
[1:16:50] we can't just live on McDonald's Amen
[1:16:54] some people who you know I heard of
[1:16:56] people at university where they just
[1:16:57] bought potatoes and rice because it's
[1:16:59] cheap and they got scurvy you know
[1:17:02] that's not a balanced diet but their
[1:17:05] bodies would be calling for other things
[1:17:07] just like we know you know you know when
[1:17:09] a mother's pregnant and she goes has all
[1:17:12] these different cravings it's not
[1:17:13] because she's calling for it but because
[1:17:15] there's a life that's calling for that
[1:17:17] for maybe a vitamin or a mineral that's
[1:17:19] in that food Alleluia and it's the same
[1:17:22] thing with us we may have something we
[1:17:24] ever have a burden or a need or
[1:17:26] something and God will anoint the most
[1:17:27] of the preacher certain thing that's
[1:17:29] because there's a as part of your diet
[1:17:31] he says you need to eat this I mean I
[1:17:34] was thinking after Kemp where can we go
[1:17:36] from here I say just feed your
[1:17:38] experience listen to this message I mean
[1:17:41] listen to the word
[1:17:43] absorbent absorbent read it listen to it
[1:17:47] don't put it on the shelf
[1:17:49] God is not rapturing a bunch of messes
[1:17:51] books and Bibles they will stay here
[1:17:53] they will stay here he's not rapturing
[1:17:56] then he's rapturing those that that word
[1:17:58] becomes manifested in that's the only
[1:18:01] people he's looking for as where this
[1:18:03] word comes out of here and is manifested
[1:18:06] in here
[1:18:07] that's the ones he's rapturing and so so
[1:18:10] if I was you I'd say Lord I want to know
[1:18:12] what you've said and I want to see it
[1:18:14] loose right amen it's not just in here
[1:18:19] man hide the word in my heart Lord thank
[1:18:22] you by your Holy Ghost and anchored in
[1:18:24] my soul hallelujah that's what God is
[1:18:27] looking for so feed your experience
[1:18:30] listen till you say well I may not
[1:18:32] understand a whole bunch do you
[1:18:34] understand how your body absorbs natural
[1:18:36] food do you know how your intestine
[1:18:39] works
[1:18:40] do you really know how your pank you
[1:18:42] know how had the blood pick you know how
[1:18:44] your body really works very few wood the
[1:18:49] whole the whole body in detail but you
[1:18:53] still eat you don't get caught up and
[1:18:55] well well I need this and then this will
[1:18:57] make this and then there's a citric acid
[1:19:00] cycle where where the body breaks down
[1:19:03] carbohydrates everything's makes amino
[1:19:05] acids makes fence make sugars but you
[1:19:07] know we don't know all about that I'm
[1:19:12] not going to ever give you a science
[1:19:13] lesson feel like I remember half of it
[1:19:15] oh yeah HS studying thing I used to know
[1:19:21] how cystic vibrant fibrosis on a
[1:19:23] chemical level worked I can't remember
[1:19:26] it anymore but we're talking about food
[1:19:28] anyway
[1:19:29] you know you don't know how it all works
[1:19:30] but yet you eat it well yet that steak
[1:19:33] or you eat something you said all this
[1:19:34] is so wonderful
[1:19:35] you don't get caught up and how it works
[1:19:37] in the body you're just enjoying the
[1:19:39] food and it's the same thing with the
[1:19:41] word of God just eat the word eat that
[1:19:44] word I meant listen to it read it amen
[1:19:46] edible begin to change you you see John
[1:19:49] John in the book of Revelation he goes
[1:19:51] from one moment he's weeping before the
[1:19:53] throne because there's no man found
[1:19:55] worthy to take the book
[1:19:57] and then an Elvis is weep not because
[1:19:59] the line of the tribe of Judah has
[1:20:00] prevailed then our Lord Jesus steps out
[1:20:02] takes that book loses the seals amen and
[1:20:06] then the scene changes and then their
[1:20:08] mighty angel Christ Himself comes down
[1:20:10] onto the earth with that open book and
[1:20:12] one time he was weeping but then this
[1:20:14] next time he says you have to eat this
[1:20:16] book you have to become one with this
[1:20:18] word and now after he eats the book he's
[1:20:21] commanded thou must prophesy again for
[1:20:24] every nation kindred tongue and people
[1:20:25] and we know that that John in the book
[1:20:29] of Revelation represents a whole body of
[1:20:30] people right a whole body of people so
[1:20:34] once they Jesus weeping then he just
[1:20:36] eats it and then he and then he's given
[1:20:39] a new commission because of what he has
[1:20:41] absorbed right and it's the same thing
[1:20:44] with you and I just take the word feed
[1:20:47] your experience because there has to be
[1:20:49] every generation has a living witness
[1:20:52] every generation I mean we're not
[1:20:54] commanded I just put it this way the
[1:20:58] life that's in this word has to be in
[1:21:01] you and so this Bible because manifested
[1:21:04] in you and you become a living witness
[1:21:06] and it's the same thing with this
[1:21:09] message because this is the message in
[1:21:11] the Bible to me are the same thing right
[1:21:13] yes it has to be lived right we are the
[1:21:17] final voice to the final age you
[1:21:20] understand it has to be a living thing
[1:21:21] not just put on shelves and push play
[1:21:24] once in a while which we should do but
[1:21:26] it has to live amen and if you listen to
[1:21:31] it then you'll begin to understand your
[1:21:33] position in the scripture why do you
[1:21:36] think brother bran would make statements
[1:21:37] like if the bride of the church or if
[1:21:41] the bride only knew what she is she will
[1:21:44] one day
[1:21:45] then the rapture will go when she knows
[1:21:48] that she is the Word made flesh amen you
[1:21:52] know I'm just going to talk to you a
[1:21:54] little bit this says in Hebrews that the
[1:21:59] works of God will finish from the
[1:22:00] foundation of the world season Hebrews
[1:22:03] three and four the works were finished
[1:22:04] and so the Bible and everything is done
[1:22:10] and the people so when God gives a
[1:22:12] prophecy so it was the prophecy as I
[1:22:14] said about my you know given to Abraham
[1:22:17] your seed will sojourn in a strange land
[1:22:19] for hundred years then I'll bring them
[1:22:21] out with the mighty hand within that
[1:22:22] prophecy was Moses within that prophecy
[1:22:25] was Caleb and Joshua within that
[1:22:28] prophecy was the generation that rose up
[1:22:30] that wing with Caleb and Joshua into the
[1:22:32] Promised Land within that prophecy was
[1:22:35] Aaron amen
[1:22:37] within that prophecy was was was Phineas
[1:22:40] and and all the different ones they were
[1:22:42] in that prophecy but they but their
[1:22:45] names all of them weren't weren't told
[1:22:48] to Moe seeing God's might when he told
[1:22:50] that to Moses all of them were contained
[1:22:52] in that word right and then when they
[1:22:55] begin to see their part in the scripture
[1:22:57] that gave them confidence they knew who
[1:23:00] they were right because they were part
[1:23:03] of the prophecy many times you know we
[1:23:06] can easily say well this world as the
[1:23:09] Word of God made manifest because he
[1:23:11] created everything by his spoken word
[1:23:13] and we say Amen but then now here we are
[1:23:17] and we got to understand we - the
[1:23:22] manifestation of his word right because
[1:23:26] of God said I'm going to have a bride
[1:23:28] without spot or wrinkle when he declared
[1:23:30] that in his mind you were in that
[1:23:32] prophecy when I said about revelations
[1:23:35] 19 the marriage of the lamb has come and
[1:23:37] his wife has made herself ready well in
[1:23:39] that prophecy you were in their prophecy
[1:23:42] I trust you can see yourself when God
[1:23:44] when God showed that to John he was
[1:23:46] showing you - John I meant just like
[1:23:50] when a virgin shall conceive God you
[1:23:52] Mary was the virgin the voice of one
[1:23:54] crying in the wilderness God knew there
[1:23:55] was John John the Baptist
[1:23:57] amen you know just like a light to the
[1:24:00] Gentiles God knew that was Paul and so
[1:24:04] now we have to see ourselves so they
[1:24:06] were part of that they weren't they
[1:24:08] weren't just someone that was tacked
[1:24:09] into the prophecy to make it work
[1:24:11] they were the manifestation of that
[1:24:13] prophecy you understand me and so the
[1:24:16] same thing with the Bride of Christ on
[1:24:18] this day there you've got to be able to
[1:24:20] see yourself you are the manifestation
[1:24:22] of the prophecy
[1:24:23] this hour amen we are the we are the
[1:24:29] Bible the prophecy in the Bible become
[1:24:32] flesh right this is who we are and now
[1:24:39] the reason the reason that God does this
[1:24:43] is because he wants to know you he wants
[1:24:45] you to know your place in the scripture
[1:24:46] that is not you going well up one day
[1:24:49] down one day good bad just temporal
[1:24:52] things affecting you but you gripped by
[1:24:54] eternal things or rather eternal things
[1:24:57] have gripped you I mean that you can
[1:24:59] walk you walk with confidence just like
[1:25:02] Paul did just like the believers all
[1:25:04] down that they had confidence we know
[1:25:06] who we are and it doesn't make you
[1:25:08] arrogant if you really knew you know if
[1:25:13] God really reveals you what he's done
[1:25:15] it doesn't make you an arrogant person
[1:25:16] odd to think he would go to Calvary for
[1:25:19] me amen you just think about that he
[1:25:22] purchased my Redemption you know who
[1:25:24] caused the wounds who caused the wounds
[1:25:27] well you'd say well it was the Romans
[1:25:28] they scourged him no he didn't they
[1:25:30] didn't cause I was pilot or it was you
[1:25:33] know it was the scribes and Pharisees
[1:25:35] they caused the wounding no they didn't
[1:25:36] cause the wounding let's go to Isaiah 53
[1:25:39] I just want you to been thinking about
[1:25:41] this maybe I this should have been um
[1:25:45] this just let's just think about this
[1:25:48] I've been pondering this this week a
[1:25:51] little bit now felt about this big and
[1:25:58] then I'm going to close with this this
[1:26:03] is why I say if this becomes real you
[1:26:05] say if this becomes real to you you
[1:26:09] won't be proud if a revelation of the
[1:26:13] Bible does not make a person proud a
[1:26:16] revelation makes someone meek humble and
[1:26:18] yielded and like Jesus Christ a
[1:26:21] revelation produces the character of
[1:26:23] Christ and you Moses Moses went from
[1:26:26] being on the being raised in Pharaoh's
[1:26:28] Pharaoh's house could have been the next
[1:26:31] Pharaoh and they they viewed the
[1:26:34] Pharaohs in Egypt were gods he went
[1:26:37] from that he went to the burning bush he
[1:26:39] went to Mount Sinai he became the
[1:26:40] meekest man in all the earth because
[1:26:43] because of those experiences that
[1:26:45] produced that character of Christ in him
[1:26:48] the scribes and Pharisees learnt the
[1:26:50] same word they become proud arrogant
[1:26:52] people
[1:26:53] so revelation will produce the character
[1:26:56] of Christ in you I mean that's why
[1:26:58] people say Oh hallelujah I've received
[1:27:00] the message well would you see the
[1:27:02] character of Christ in you because
[1:27:04] that's what it will produce now you say
[1:27:06] well who I don't have this on the
[1:27:10] PowerPoint let's go to verse 5 I say who
[1:27:16] caused the wounds but he was wounded
[1:27:20] this is I know everyone knows the
[1:27:21] scripture but he was wounded for our
[1:27:24] transgressions he was bruised for our
[1:27:27] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[1:27:30] was upon him and with His stripes we are
[1:27:33] healed
[1:27:33] so who caused the wounding I caused the
[1:27:38] wounding he was bruised for he was
[1:27:41] wounded for my transgressions so my
[1:27:44] transgressions caused him to be wounded
[1:27:47] amen he was bruised for my iniquities
[1:27:51] caused him to be bruised right I caused
[1:27:56] it I caused the woods it wasn't it
[1:28:00] wasn't the Romans or the Jewish people
[1:28:03] with their religion that rejected their
[1:28:04] Messiah it was my work it was my
[1:28:07] iniquity it was my transgressions of
[1:28:10] course says wounding now if you just
[1:28:13] think about that for a little bit it
[1:28:15] wouldn't make you a proud person
[1:28:17] wouldn't make you an arrogant all I'm a
[1:28:19] believer I'm the bride earlier it
[1:28:21] doesn't make you and you just think we
[1:28:23] we were heard the Bible says we were
[1:28:25] God's enemies we were his enemies and
[1:28:28] yet he died for his enemies amen
[1:28:33] and people can do things against us you
[1:28:36] know think about this people can come
[1:28:38] against us and do different things but
[1:28:40] we were his enemy we cost his wounding
[1:28:43] and how did he respond to the wounding I
[1:28:44] mean how did he respond to to what was
[1:28:47] going on he said I'll take it for you
[1:28:51] amen are you thinking about that we have
[1:28:56] some musicians I don't want to yeah but
[1:28:58] why wouldn't you think about it I caused
[1:29:01] the wounding when he was on why was he
[1:29:04] put now to a cross because of me
[1:29:09] helllooo you aren't you glad that we
[1:29:12] were his enemy but he came and died for
[1:29:14] his enemy that's amazing love amen but
[1:29:22] only eternal things are real we're gonna
[1:29:25] see ourselves through what does God we
[1:29:29] we are the bright around the world as a
[1:29:32] prophecy made benefits they mean and now
[1:29:36] you've got to go say you gotta say I am
[1:29:38] the prophecy of the Bible made manifest
[1:29:41] amen this is this is what I am because
[1:29:45] of His grace when he saw a bride without
[1:29:47] spot or wrinkle he saw me
[1:29:50] isn't that incredible I mean when he is
[1:29:54] on the cross I was on his mind a
[1:29:56] malicious stand this morning
