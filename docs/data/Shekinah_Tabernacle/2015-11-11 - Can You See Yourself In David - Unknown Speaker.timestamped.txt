[34:53] out tonight um we'll just
[34:56] uh turn to the scripture if uh if you
[34:58] don't mind we've got a
[35:00] first samuel chapter three and uh just a
[35:03] reminder that um
[35:04] we're gonna uh so brother thaddeus
[35:06] burgess will be here this weekend
[35:07] we're gonna have a couple of services at
[35:09] 10 and at six
[35:10] uh so you're welcome to come it's good
[35:13] to have everyone
[35:14] up you know it's just one i was so
[35:16] blessed to hear he's doing better
[35:18] you know i mean we've been praying i
[35:21] know you've been praying it's good to
[35:22] see family rally around
[35:23] and not look at what they see but look
[35:25] at the promise
[35:26] they means just encouragement to us so
[35:28] god bless you um
[35:31] let's just read i'd like to read a
[35:32] couple of scriptures just from first
[35:34] samuel chapter three just gonna read the
[35:36] first two scriptures here
[35:39] i'm just gonna i'm gonna read this here
[35:41] it says
[35:42] and this child samuel ministered unto
[35:44] the lord before eli
[35:46] and the word of the lord was precious in
[35:48] those days there was no open vision
[35:50] and it came to pass at that time when
[35:53] eli
[35:54] was laid down in his place his eyes
[35:56] began to wax dim that he could not see
[35:59] and here the lamp of god went out of the
[36:01] temple of the lord
[36:02] where the ark of god was and samuel was
[36:05] laid down to sleep that the lord called
[36:08] samuel and he answered here
[36:10] am i may the lord bless his word you may
[36:14] you may have your seats
[36:17] so i want to i want to uh maybe start a
[36:20] subject and just see how the lord opens
[36:22] it up but
[36:23] i want to just go into first samuel here
[36:25] because
[36:27] we we understand that samuel you know
[36:30] the prophet samuel coming upon the scene
[36:32] there in
[36:32] uh you know in israel's history was a
[36:35] great
[36:36] junction there in the in the history of
[36:38] israel and
[36:40] we can see if you know from from samuel
[36:43] coming
[36:43] and then david then solomon then the
[36:45] temple being set
[36:47] you know that that junction there in
[36:50] israel's history is being lived out
[36:52] today
[36:53] because we see eli was the end of the
[36:55] priesthood
[36:56] you know and then and then samuel the
[36:58] prophet came upon the scene he anointed
[37:00] david to become
[37:01] king and then david's son samuel
[37:04] built the temple and then brother brahm
[37:06] said that israel
[37:08] had like a bit of a millennium there
[37:10] when when samuel built the temple so
[37:12] you know we are living in a time where
[37:14] the church ages have come to an
[37:16] end god has sent a prophet he's anointed
[37:18] an age and we're looking for a rapture
[37:20] and then uh you know the great yeah the
[37:23] your wedding supper of the lamb and then
[37:24] the millennium's going to set him
[37:26] so this these you know this story in
[37:28] here is being lived out again
[37:31] amen and so i just want to just begin to
[37:35] to look at these things because you know
[37:37] these things are not just
[37:39] a nice idea and how neat it is but we
[37:41] see
[37:42] in the story we're in the story we're in
[37:44] these great big this junction that
[37:46] israel goes through we're in the story
[37:48] and we can see how believers conducted
[37:51] themselves here we see how david was
[37:53] during this great transition time israel
[37:56] had never had a king before
[37:59] you know it said that the you know the
[38:00] you know the word of the lord was
[38:02] precious in those days there's no open
[38:03] vision they just had a priesthood going
[38:05] on
[38:06] so now you know things were going to
[38:07] change in israel's history
[38:09] very dramatically and very quickly and
[38:12] so
[38:13] if we can see ourselves because brother
[38:15] brahm says if you can see how the type
[38:17] lived and how they overcame
[38:20] we can see ourselves overcoming as well
[38:23] because we are
[38:24] we are being you know david is not just
[38:27] christ the rejected king
[38:28] but he's also us as well we're a type of
[38:30] david you know the scripture has
[38:32] compound meaning
[38:33] so if you see how you know the believers
[38:35] conducted themselves and how they
[38:37] overcame
[38:38] then we can look into that and draw
[38:40] strength from it and we can overcome the
[38:42] same way
[38:43] because i'm sure you can agree david was
[38:46] in a lot of tight spots
[38:47] yeah he didn't have it he didn't have it
[38:50] all easy he didn't have it just a
[38:52] you know like a red carpet rolled out
[38:54] here's the throne and everything went
[38:55] swimmingly
[38:56] he he went through a lot of tight spots
[38:59] and many people in those same conditions
[39:01] would have burst and failed under
[39:03] pressure
[39:03] but god did not allow david remember it
[39:06] was david's as god's promise to david
[39:08] it wasn't david's ambition that got him
[39:10] on the throne it wasn't david's planning
[39:12] that god and there god placed him there
[39:14] and david had confidence you know if
[39:16] this is all you get out of it tonight
[39:18] that's all perfectly well
[39:19] david had confidence that samuel
[39:22] a vindicated proven prophet of god
[39:24] anointed him
[39:25] and he anointed him to become king and
[39:28] therefore if he was going to be anointed
[39:30] king he was going to become king
[39:31] and he had confidence that god's
[39:34] anointing was going to see him through
[39:35] until he's sitting upon the throne he
[39:37] didn't have confidence in himself he
[39:39] didn't have confidence that maybe
[39:41] even the mighty warriors that rallied to
[39:43] him he had confidence that god had
[39:45] called him to become
[39:46] king and that saw him through great
[39:48] trials that saw him
[39:50] through the hard times and the desperate
[39:51] hours when he was running
[39:53] that saw him through amen and so i trust
[39:56] you can begin to see yourself in the
[39:58] picture now
[39:59] now we can see here this with
[40:02] with eli that you know we've had seven
[40:05] church ages and
[40:06] and it's came to a it's came to a
[40:08] junction in time where
[40:10] you know we read here in in verse 3 that
[40:12] the lamp of god went out in the temple
[40:15] and my chain reference tells me
[40:19] that this lamp is the menorah and the
[40:23] you know you know in the in the
[40:24] tabernacle you know you have the article
[40:26] in the inner court and in the inner
[40:28] court is the menorah that's got the
[40:29] seven
[40:30] candlesticks i know you're familiar with
[40:32] it and it draws oil from one
[40:34] one basin and so this this is a course
[40:38] this shows the seven church ages and
[40:40] it's showing now
[40:41] that the light of the church goes out
[40:44] and then as soon as the light goes out
[40:45] god begins to speak to samuel
[40:48] because the light of the church has gone
[40:49] out now remember we have to walk in the
[40:51] lightest hairs and the light
[40:53] so now god was actually symbolizing here
[40:56] church ways of doing things
[40:57] has come to an end i'm gonna by my word
[41:00] place the people how they should be
[41:03] because we see eli you know he was too
[41:06] um he was too soft on his sons i put it
[41:10] that way to correct them
[41:11] they were living in sin they were
[41:13] polluting the priesthood and all these
[41:14] things
[41:15] and so the church order had become
[41:17] polluted
[41:18] and so god was you know you can read
[41:21] earlier
[41:21] you know god sends a prophet to eli
[41:24] saying
[41:25] your sons are not going to take your
[41:26] place it's going to be done away with
[41:28] i'm going to raise up someone else
[41:30] and that one he was raising up was
[41:31] ministering for him in the temple
[41:33] already
[41:34] and so now eli you know so that was
[41:37] showing now that
[41:38] church ways of doing things were coming
[41:39] to an end and
[41:41] you know israel had had the priesthood
[41:44] for hundreds of years probably
[41:46] you know you know by this time they knew
[41:48] what the levite priesthood was
[41:50] they knew what the high priest was but
[41:51] now a king was going to come
[41:54] and now they had another prophet in the
[41:55] land
[41:58] because there was a scripture that had
[42:00] to be fulfilled in genesis 49 and verse
[42:03] 10 it says this
[42:04] so shall not depart from judah until
[42:06] shiloh come
[42:07] so there is a promise now that the
[42:09] scepter means the kingship
[42:11] the kingship's going to come into judah
[42:13] but when
[42:14] when the patriarch was blessing his sons
[42:16] and giving this blessing there was no
[42:17] king
[42:19] and that prophecy lingered and laid
[42:21] there in the scrolls for hundreds of
[42:23] years
[42:24] until finally it came the season where
[42:26] god says i'm going to make this become
[42:27] flesh is going to become a reality
[42:30] and we see here that
[42:34] god god was going to place a king over
[42:37] his people
[42:40] and there came a point where man
[42:43] wanted a king because they saw the
[42:45] failure because this is what happens if
[42:46] man
[42:47] sees the failure of something they're
[42:49] looking for another man to make it all
[42:51] better
[42:51] because they said to samuel your sons
[42:54] aren't doing the right thing
[42:55] give us a king like the other nations
[42:58] instead of depending upon the lord
[43:00] they were depending upon another man
[43:01] they wanted another man they could put
[43:03] their confidence in
[43:04] they wanted to follow another man
[43:06] instead of following god himself
[43:08] and so saul saul was not the tribe of
[43:12] judah
[43:13] we understand that he is from the tribe
[43:15] of benjamin but
[43:16] saul was the king that man wanted
[43:20] so he was he was the idea that israel
[43:23] had of a king in their mind
[43:25] he was he was that idea in a man
[43:28] you could say he was the revelation of
[43:30] what they thought a king should be
[43:31] head and shoulders above the rest big
[43:33] strong man to lead them into battle
[43:35] but that was not god's choosing god's
[43:38] idea of a king was
[43:40] a little shepherd boy totally different
[43:43] totally different ideas and so
[43:46] and we can see this in the scripture you
[43:48] even go into the days of jesus
[43:52] you know the scribes and pharisees
[43:53] brother baron speaks about it quite
[43:55] often
[43:55] the pharisees say the messiah is going
[43:57] to come out of our group and
[43:58] and the scribes think he'll come out of
[44:00] our group and he'll you know he'll
[44:02] come down and be brothers so and so be
[44:04] his forerunner because he's a great
[44:05] intellectual man and the messiah will
[44:07] come down a stairway out of heaven check
[44:09] the hands of the high priest here i am
[44:10] and
[44:11] you know but when the fulfillment came
[44:13] it was a man who was
[44:15] in the desert from a very young age
[44:17] eight years old whatever it was
[44:19] trained by a guy on the back side of the
[44:21] desert here he came he was the
[44:22] forerunner
[44:24] standing there knee deep in the jordan
[44:26] and mud crying
[44:27] behold the kingdom of god is at hand and
[44:30] then here comes jesus the messiah god
[44:32] and flesh comes
[44:34] he didn't come out of any organization
[44:36] that was god's choosing
[44:38] it wasn't man's choosing man would never
[44:40] have picked those two
[44:42] amen god chose very different people
[44:46] and so it's the same thing
[44:50] the same thing as today david would
[44:53] never have been anyone's choice to be
[44:55] king here's a boy
[44:56] he's looking after his daddy's sheep i
[44:58] know you know the story very well but
[45:00] just let it sink in a little bit
[45:01] here's a boy who's looking after his
[45:04] daddy's sheep
[45:04] sure he's from a great family there you
[45:07] know from bethlehem
[45:08] and you know boaz and ruth and you know
[45:10] all these ones down a great family of
[45:12] royalty he was from
[45:14] but he was the youngest son he didn't
[45:17] look like a king
[45:19] but yet he was god said i have a king in
[45:21] jesse's house
[45:24] and david didn't know this is what he is
[45:25] meant to be and he's looking after his
[45:27] daddy's sheep
[45:28] and god gave him a heart that he's a man
[45:31] after my own heart
[45:33] and god made him this way and then here
[45:35] you are
[45:38] people think the bride of christ they'll
[45:39] never pick us
[45:42] your mother just come to terms they
[45:44] would never man man if they looked they
[45:46] would think of some big super church
[45:48] some big super organization thing that's
[45:50] covered the earth and all these things
[45:52] it has covered the earth but not in the
[45:54] way they think it should cover the earth
[45:57] i mean it's people people that man would
[45:59] never pick
[46:00] god says this is this is my wife this is
[46:03] the one i've been waiting to be come
[46:05] upon the earth he's been waiting for you
[46:07] and here you are adam and eve you know
[46:10] he waited for them to be expressed and
[46:12] he could have fellowship with them
[46:14] and you know and here you are and then
[46:17] so
[46:17] god chooses a very different kind of
[46:19] people than what man chooses
[46:22] and so samuel now samuel
[46:25] began great changes in israel
[46:28] because he would begin to
[46:33] you know he was rejected we understand
[46:35] saul came into power
[46:38] but saul failed when the challenge came
[46:42] because if we go to let's just read a
[46:44] little bit let's go to first samuel
[46:46] chapter 17.
[46:49] i just want to read a few things
[46:54] now the great challenge came and you can
[46:57] see saul
[46:58] you know even before this you know he
[47:02] he he cut an oxen into pieces he sent it
[47:04] throughout israel
[47:05] see this is man this is how man applies
[47:07] leadership
[47:08] man applies leadership by pressure and
[47:11] he cuts up an auction
[47:13] and he sends it to the full corner of
[47:14] the of israel and says if you
[47:16] do not come and fight you'll become like
[47:18] this he put fear upon the people
[47:21] trying to put some physical pressure
[47:24] david didn't lead this way amen
[47:28] david didn't lead that way saul led that
[47:30] way because it was man's choosing
[47:32] this is how man's kind of leadership
[47:34] operated in those days
[47:37] by exerting a kind of pressure upon the
[47:39] people to conform to a certain idea
[47:42] god doesn't operate that way friends
[47:44] he's a gentleman
[47:46] he says here here it is and you can
[47:48] choose it or reject it
[47:50] and it gives you what you need in order
[47:51] to do it before he imposes anything upon
[47:53] you
[47:55] hallelujah so we see here in general uh
[47:59] sorry in first samuel chapter 17 we have
[48:02] you know david and goliath i know you're
[48:03] very familiar with the story but here we
[48:06] have if we read we'll just read verses
[48:10] verse from from verse four and then went
[48:13] out a champion out of the camp of the
[48:15] philistines now here comes the great
[48:16] challenge
[48:18] named goliath of gath whose height was
[48:20] six cubits and a span
[48:22] and he had a helmet of brass upon his
[48:24] head and he was armed with a coat of
[48:26] mail
[48:26] and the weight of the coat was five
[48:28] thousand shekels of brass and his griefs
[48:30] uh any i don't think he said he said
[48:32] graves griezmann brass upon his legs and
[48:34] a target of brass
[48:35] between his shoulders and the staff of
[48:37] his spare was like a weaver's beam
[48:40] and his spare head weighed 600 shekels
[48:42] of iron
[48:43] and one bearing a shield went before him
[48:47] now man
[48:51] when men look at me when men looked at
[48:53] goliath they saw a size
[48:56] now this is probably very elementary but
[48:57] i hope it helps
[48:59] they saw a size intimidated by its size
[49:03] but they weren't looking see we can
[49:05] either look at things through our
[49:07] natural eye or we can look at
[49:08] things through the eyes of the word and
[49:11] it depends if you want to succeed look
[49:13] at it through the eyes of the word if
[49:15] you want to fail look at use these two
[49:16] things
[49:17] use these five senses you're sure to
[49:19] fail and so they were intimidated by
[49:21] this big giant man
[49:23] but they forgot that they are a covenant
[49:26] people serving the living god
[49:27] and they forgot he was covered in
[49:29] judgment because his whole arm was made
[49:31] out of brass
[49:32] and that's god's divine judgment this
[49:34] man was a walking
[49:36] defeated thing because he's already gone
[49:38] re-judge him saying
[49:40] my judgment's passed and he's been found
[49:42] wanting and here he was making his boast
[49:46] amen here he was making his boast and
[49:48] saul and the people of israel there were
[49:50] looking at his size
[49:52] and they weren't looking at the promise
[49:53] of god where one will chase a thousand
[49:55] two
[49:55] chased ten thousand and they were now
[49:58] stuck for 40 days
[50:00] in this battle array and we know you
[50:03] know
[50:03] 40 years as a generation so i just
[50:06] wonder if i may say they were stuck
[50:07] there for like a generation
[50:09] and they couldn't they couldn't have
[50:11] advantage the philistines
[50:13] the devil just wants to hold you there
[50:16] he just wanted to hold them out in the
[50:17] field and try and wear them down a
[50:19] little bit
[50:20] it's the same thing with with the devil
[50:22] today friends he just wants to hold you
[50:23] there in a challenge
[50:25] and try and wear you down amen
[50:28] and if you look at the size of the
[50:30] challenge you'll fail but if you look at
[50:32] the promise of god
[50:33] amen if you start to testify quote the
[50:36] word you'll cut
[50:37] philistines plum to the walls just takes
[50:39] one person to take god in his word and
[50:41] everyone else will rally around it
[50:43] hallelujah so now here we have so
[50:47] they're stuck in this way
[50:49] and but they forget that there's one in
[50:51] the land
[50:53] has been anointed by the prophet when
[50:55] when saul was anointed
[50:57] saul said uh samuel told him you'll
[50:59] become like a new man
[51:00] after you prophesy with these other ones
[51:02] he became like a new man
[51:04] but never said and the spirit of god was
[51:06] with him from that day on but then when
[51:08] david he's a little boy
[51:10] god says this man is this boy is my king
[51:12] in him is to be a king
[51:14] and when samuel pointed the horn of oil
[51:17] poured it over his head and said
[51:18] and the spirit of god was with him from
[51:21] that day on
[51:22] so what he needed to be king was with
[51:24] him i'd say it was in him
[51:26] the qualities of of a king was in him
[51:30] as the same thing with us the qualities
[51:32] of the bride of jesus christ is in you
[51:35] amen what you have need of is in you
[51:38] hallelujah
[51:39] if god has become a living reality where
[51:41] it's not a story book but it becomes it
[51:43] comes a personal love letter
[51:45] and god is not a god of history saul had
[51:48] had a reputation he had built look we
[51:50] won this battle we won this battle and
[51:53] he could point back to
[51:54] some legacy that he had but he didn't
[51:57] have the present i am god
[51:59] and then david said i killed the bear i
[52:01] killed the lion god gave me them this
[52:03] philistine will be exactly like them
[52:05] he brought the god of history was the
[52:07] god of the present for him
[52:09] he wasn't he wasn't just leaning back on
[52:11] well god did these things for me
[52:13] way back when but david set god's
[52:16] present
[52:17] he didn't just talk about it he proved
[52:19] it because he knew it wasn't his ability
[52:21] that was going to kill that
[52:22] giant he knew it was the god in him that
[52:24] was going to kill the giant
[52:26] hallelujah it's the same thing with us
[52:28] the very god of david is present
[52:30] amen and we don't need to lean on the
[52:32] arm of flesh lean on the arms of god
[52:35] hallelujah then we can doubt down any
[52:37] giant amen that comes across
[52:39] our path but we see that saul even
[52:42] himself if we go to
[52:44] if we go further down the chapter two to
[52:47] verses 34 to 38 we see that saul is
[52:50] trying to arm
[52:51] david according to the weapons that he
[52:53] had
[52:54] but unfortunately that david saul's
[52:57] method was as judged as goliath method
[52:59] because we see
[53:01] here if we just read it a little bit
[53:04] we'll go from verse 34 i believe i have
[53:07] and david said unto saul
[53:09] as he begins to testify it's good to
[53:11] testify
[53:12] amen even it's just a little thing
[53:14] testify about it
[53:16] in god's economy nothing's big nothing's
[53:18] great it's all great
[53:20] amen he saved me that's great amen my
[53:24] my kid was a little bit sick we prayed
[53:25] he got healed that's great
[53:27] oh it doesn't matter how small we think
[53:29] it is to god it's all important and
[53:30] great so just begin to testify
[53:32] as david said unto saul thy servant kept
[53:35] his father's sheep
[53:37] and there came a lion and a bear and
[53:38] took a lamb out of the flock
[53:43] and i went out after him
[53:46] now sorry just before we go has anyone
[53:48] seen you go on to youtube
[53:50] there's there's this footage of hunters
[53:52] trying to kill lions
[53:53] there's like four or five of them got
[53:55] these great big cannon kind of rifles
[53:57] and and they're hunting these lines and
[54:00] then quite a few of them
[54:01] the line actually nearly literally grabs
[54:03] one of them and they shoot it like point
[54:05] blank
[54:06] and they've got they've got bushman
[54:07] trackers they've got all these things
[54:10] and some of them nearly get killed
[54:12] here's a little boy
[54:14] he's got a sling and a stone he doesn't
[54:17] have a big cannon thing
[54:18] he doesn't have some bushman tracker
[54:20] with him and all these he doesn't have
[54:22] his buddies all his goddess he's on the
[54:24] back side of the
[54:25] farm somewhere with a sling amen
[54:28] right wasn't it wasn't some line that
[54:30] was just asleep someplace
[54:33] they meant this you know this line and
[54:36] bear they just grabbed an animal
[54:38] you know they were running on adrenaline
[54:39] they were fully awake blood was probably
[54:41] in their mouths
[54:44] amen and here he was i just killed this
[54:47] i killed this one he'll be the same as
[54:48] that one and david said unto saul thy
[54:51] servant has kept his father's sheep
[54:53] and there came a lion and a bear and
[54:54] took a lamb out of the flock and i went
[54:56] after him and smote him and delivered it
[54:58] out of his mouth
[55:00] and when he arose against me i caught
[55:02] him by his bed and smote him and slew
[55:04] him
[55:06] thy servant slew both the lion and the
[55:08] bear this uncircumcised philistine shall
[55:10] be as one of them
[55:12] saying he has to find the armies of the
[55:15] living god
[55:16] see david put all in the same category
[55:20] just put the devil in the same category
[55:22] doesn't matter if it's a great big
[55:24] crisis or a little thing
[55:26] if god delivered you out of one thing
[55:27] he'll deliver you again and if he
[55:29] delivered you another thing he'll
[55:30] deliver you again
[55:31] and you'll and he'll anoint you to
[55:32] overcome something else amen
[55:34] amen he doesn't he doesn't do something
[55:37] for you then leave you the next day
[55:40] you can see david stepped out in faith
[55:43] amen he believed
[55:44] yeah brother brown many times he says no
[55:45] i don't know he'll come waiting for the
[55:47] angel lord to come i don't know if he'll
[55:48] come
[55:49] and he's just there and waiting but he's
[55:51] there in faith
[55:52] he had to believe he would come see same
[55:55] thing with us
[55:57] just step out in faith if it's according
[55:58] to the word step out in faith
[56:02] and watch god come upon the scene
[56:05] david said moreover verse 37 i'm sorry
[56:08] my voice
[56:09] david said moreover the lord hath
[56:11] delivered me out of the poor of the lion
[56:13] and now the poor of the bear he will
[56:15] deliver me out of the hand of this
[56:16] philistine
[56:17] and saul said unto david go and the lord
[56:20] be with you
[56:21] now notice and saul armed david with his
[56:23] armor and put
[56:24] a helmet of brass upon his head also he
[56:27] armed them with a coat of mail
[56:28] and david girded his sword upon his
[56:30] armor and he has said to go
[56:32] for he had not proved it and david said
[56:34] unto saul i cannot go with these
[56:36] for i have not proved them and david put
[56:39] them off him see
[56:41] helmet of brass saul's way of thinking
[56:43] was already judged by
[56:44] because he already said saul's not my
[56:46] king anymore david's my king
[56:49] so his very method of doing things has
[56:52] already been judged
[56:53] and failed amen
[56:56] and they would just and him and him and
[56:58] goliath were both judged
[57:01] whether he liked it or not and so that's
[57:04] why david
[57:05] david was a spiritual man he could see
[57:07] this way
[57:09] doesn't work i'm going to try my way
[57:11] because it's worked before
[57:13] so it's going to work again and so he
[57:16] took his staff in his hand
[57:18] and he chose him five smooth stones out
[57:20] of the brook
[57:21] and put them in a shepherd's bag which
[57:23] he had even in a script
[57:25] and his sling was in his hand and he
[57:27] drew near to the philistine
[57:29] he took five stones because he knew
[57:31] goliath had brothers
[57:33] he didn't take five because he was
[57:34] scared he was gonna miss
[57:37] amen he knew if he had to kill all of
[57:39] his brothers him and his brothers in the
[57:41] same day god would allow him to kill
[57:42] them all
[57:44] amen don't be afraid see he was looking
[57:47] through the eyes of the word he's a
[57:49] covenant he's a circumcised believer
[57:51] standing in the promised land this devil
[57:53] had to die
[57:56] and that's all he looked at amen
[57:59] and then let's just go down you know
[58:01] david was fearless
[58:03] because he knew that god would deliver
[58:04] him he was fearless because he knew god
[58:06] would deliver him
[58:09] now let's go down to verse 48 and it
[58:12] came to pass when the philistine arose
[58:14] and came and drew now to meet david
[58:16] that david hastened and he ran towards
[58:18] the army
[58:19] to meet the philistine and david put his
[58:22] hand his bag and took
[58:23] fences stone and slang it and smoked the
[58:25] philistine in the forehead
[58:27] that the stones sunk into his forehead
[58:29] and he fell
[58:30] upon his face to the earth so david
[58:32] prevailed over the philistine with a
[58:34] slinger with a stone and smoked the
[58:35] philistine and slew him
[58:37] but there was no sword in the hand of
[58:39] david therefore david ran
[58:41] took a stood upon the philistine drew
[58:43] out his sword and
[58:44] took his sword and drew it out to the of
[58:46] the sheath thereof and slew him
[58:48] cut off his head there with and when the
[58:50] philistines saw their champion was dead
[58:52] they fled
[58:54] see david ran into the battle you see in
[58:57] the when you see the cartoons he's just
[58:58] standing there
[58:59] the bible doesn't say he stood there he
[59:00] ran to meet him
[59:02] he ran to meet the challenge he wasn't
[59:04] afraid
[59:05] he knew that this this giant was as good
[59:07] as dead he just wanted to see it lived
[59:09] out
[59:10] oh look he just want to see the devil he
[59:12] already got the revelation
[59:13] this one's going to be like the bear in
[59:14] the line amen so he ran towards his
[59:17] enemy
[59:18] friends we're not called to shrink back
[59:21] the devil may look big but the bigger he
[59:23] is the easier he is to hit
[59:26] amen that's why david this man's a giant
[59:28] he's huge i can't miss him
[59:31] he had i can't miss it and not only that
[59:33] god guided the stone to the killing
[59:35] place
[59:36] amen we have you know what we have is an
[59:38] incredible weapon
[59:40] amen that you know saul said to david
[59:43] you're a youth this man's been trained
[59:44] as a warrior from his youth
[59:47] so here was the goliath was you could
[59:49] say the apex of the philistine military
[59:51] machine in that day
[59:53] he was the elite soldier he was their
[59:55] champion he was the best the devil could
[59:57] put forward
[59:59] and here comes a little boy this is the
[1:00:01] best that god could put forward
[1:00:03] amen hallelujah hey man it's not how big
[1:00:07] it's the size of the fight in the dog
[1:00:09] not the size of the dog in the fight
[1:00:12] amen god so we have this confidence
[1:00:15] so i trust you can see yourself in there
[1:00:18] but because he was anointed to become
[1:00:20] king
[1:00:21] he knew whatever came his way god would
[1:00:24] cause him to overcome it
[1:00:26] amen now
[1:00:31] david we see after this things begin to
[1:00:35] change
[1:00:36] and the reason begin to change is
[1:00:37] because the kingship was coming
[1:00:40] was coming into israel and a corner was
[1:00:42] being turned you could say in their
[1:00:44] journey
[1:00:46] and we see that every you know every so
[1:00:48] often the church itself turns a corner
[1:00:52] and god we understand the book of
[1:00:53] revelation that he has four different
[1:00:55] anointings that come out in a certain
[1:00:57] time to combat the enemy we see in the
[1:00:59] you know in the first church age there
[1:01:01] we had a white horse rider the devil
[1:01:03] riding fourth and deception
[1:01:05] and a lion anointing went forth to
[1:01:07] combat that deception
[1:01:08] and then when the enemy uh became
[1:01:11] crowned and a man
[1:01:13] and then he took up a sword and began to
[1:01:15] kill the believers then the people were
[1:01:17] anointed with an
[1:01:18] ox sacrificial anointing to combat what
[1:01:21] the devil was doing
[1:01:22] and that's why when you read things like
[1:01:24] the fox's book of matters
[1:01:25] when the people saw their steak they saw
[1:01:28] where they are going to be killed they
[1:01:29] begin to rejoice
[1:01:30] and they and some of them said you don't
[1:01:32] need to bind me to the stake i'll just
[1:01:33] stand here willingly
[1:01:35] why is that because they are anointed to
[1:01:37] give their lives in such a way
[1:01:39] they are anointed to overcome the
[1:01:41] pressure
[1:01:42] of the age they were living in and then
[1:01:45] finally we come down to this age where
[1:01:47] where the church world was like it was
[1:01:50] there was saul
[1:01:52] and his army and goliath and the
[1:01:53] philistines everything was in a
[1:01:55] stalemate
[1:01:56] and the way souls were doing things that
[1:01:59] you know the church were doing things
[1:02:00] had come to its end
[1:02:02] and it couldn't overcome the enemy to to
[1:02:06] to drive out the enemy and then so god
[1:02:08] raised up
[1:02:09] god raised up brother brown he sent
[1:02:11] elijah upon the earth
[1:02:13] who came a different way to a church
[1:02:16] education way of doing things
[1:02:19] and he came in such a way now
[1:02:22] that a change was happening because
[1:02:25] remember we used to have bible schools
[1:02:26] for many years we had seminaries
[1:02:28] and god allowed those things god allowed
[1:02:32] how the lutherans were and how the
[1:02:34] methodists were and
[1:02:35] the pentecostals god allowed that system
[1:02:37] of
[1:02:38] but then they came to a point that god
[1:02:40] had in his word that those things were
[1:02:42] going to be done away with
[1:02:43] and i was going to restore a true
[1:02:44] relationship with between me and my
[1:02:47] people
[1:02:48] and so god god turned a corner where
[1:02:52] where under luther it was the
[1:02:53] intelligence of a man
[1:02:55] you know they had the printing press
[1:02:56] that many of them you take like
[1:02:59] like erasmus that that took the a greek
[1:03:02] text and put it together and
[1:03:04] william tyndale took that text and you
[1:03:06] know turned into the english these
[1:03:07] people knew many languages are smart
[1:03:09] people
[1:03:10] very educated people god used that
[1:03:12] because they had a man's intelligence
[1:03:14] but that came through into the
[1:03:16] pentecostal age
[1:03:17] but then it came to a point where god
[1:03:19] said it's going to be different now
[1:03:22] everyone's going to turn a corner and
[1:03:23] instead of a man's intelligence there's
[1:03:25] going to be an eagle anointing coming to
[1:03:26] the church
[1:03:27] amen that will combat what the enemy is
[1:03:30] doing today
[1:03:32] just like david came upon the scene he
[1:03:34] didn't he wasn't dressed how
[1:03:36] saul was dressed in battle he came a
[1:03:38] different way
[1:03:40] and so we have now
[1:03:43] what we're anointed with here at your
[1:03:46] own eagle anointing
[1:03:47] is that is said to combat the pressure
[1:03:50] that we live under every day
[1:03:52] amen because we don't live hey we have
[1:03:54] freedom of religion
[1:03:56] we have a nice country to live in but
[1:03:58] there's a pressure
[1:04:00] and there's there's an unseen force that
[1:04:02] is trying to rob you of your victory in
[1:04:04] christ
[1:04:05] there's a force trying to rob you of
[1:04:06] your joy and your love for the lord
[1:04:09] amen busyness of life brother and says
[1:04:11] it's a pressure that's in this age
[1:04:14] and if we're not careful we will look
[1:04:16] through the eyes of flesh
[1:04:18] and those things will begin to block us
[1:04:20] down
[1:04:21] but god is not will not wanting us to be
[1:04:23] bogged down with the things of life
[1:04:25] hey sure we've got to have families we
[1:04:27] have jobs we've got to do all the
[1:04:28] natural things plant potatoes do
[1:04:30] whatever you got to do
[1:04:31] but at the end of the day we should look
[1:04:33] through the eyes of the word
[1:04:35] amen everything in life we should look
[1:04:38] through the eyes of the word and say
[1:04:39] well lord is this
[1:04:40] is this pleasing to you not it's not a
[1:04:43] bunch of rules it's never been a bunch
[1:04:45] of rules to me it's lord does this
[1:04:47] please you
[1:04:48] if you're in a relationship with someone
[1:04:50] you do things to try and please them
[1:04:52] you don't always get it right but you
[1:04:54] try your best
[1:04:55] amen but it's because you're in a
[1:04:58] relationship
[1:05:00] and god you know god has entered into a
[1:05:03] relationship with his bride with you and
[1:05:05] me
[1:05:06] when he became real to me it's because
[1:05:07] he wanted to enter into a relationship
[1:05:09] with me
[1:05:10] and then i just gave myself and
[1:05:12] responded to that call
[1:05:14] and the ever since lord does this please
[1:05:16] you
[1:05:17] yes okay well no it doesn't okay that's
[1:05:19] fine yes and no
[1:05:20] equally good and then so where
[1:05:23] the church has been there's been a
[1:05:25] change he said when the fourth seal
[1:05:27] opened the eagle began to fly
[1:05:28] brother bam tells us these things so he
[1:05:30] says that the church now is anointed in
[1:05:32] a different way to it was in the past
[1:05:34] and that's why when you can go down the
[1:05:37] street
[1:05:38] and you look at things in this world you
[1:05:40] can actually see it for what it is
[1:05:43] you can actually go into the mall or
[1:05:45] whatever it is and
[1:05:46] you can see things and you can actually
[1:05:49] say
[1:05:50] that is not pleasing to my lord
[1:05:53] remember it said it become so close that
[1:05:55] even
[1:05:56] you know deceive the elect if it was po
[1:05:58] if it was possible is not possible
[1:06:00] because god has equipped us to look at
[1:06:03] this world
[1:06:05] you don't have to consciously do it
[1:06:06] there's something in you that says
[1:06:08] that it's either alarm bell saying no or
[1:06:10] there's a piece that just says yes do it
[1:06:13] amen you don't have to work it out and
[1:06:16] get all worried about it just walk with
[1:06:17] god
[1:06:18] it's a relationship honey is this fine
[1:06:20] no it's not fun okay we'll do something
[1:06:22] else
[1:06:23] is it fine a cat will just get you just
[1:06:25] relax and enjoy him walk with him
[1:06:27] amen and then and then you can see
[1:06:29] things because an eagle
[1:06:30] can see it's the only one of those four
[1:06:32] creatures that can actually get off the
[1:06:34] ground
[1:06:35] amen it can it can see above and look
[1:06:38] down
[1:06:39] and not only just look down it can look
[1:06:41] from eternity to eternity
[1:06:44] amen that's why the gospel of john is so
[1:06:46] important for our age in which we're
[1:06:47] alive and
[1:06:48] because he because he's under that same
[1:06:49] anointing to go from in the beginning
[1:06:51] was the word
[1:06:52] and the word was with god he goes from
[1:06:54] there and then the word became flesh
[1:06:56] none of the other gospels are written
[1:06:58] that way and it pertains to our day it's
[1:07:00] very important how it's written
[1:07:02] you see because it's written under that
[1:07:04] legal anointing
[1:07:06] and then so we are
[1:07:11] we are under that same anointing amen
[1:07:14] he said well you know that's the only
[1:07:18] way we can overcome in this age is
[1:07:19] because the anointing of god
[1:07:22] amen brother i'm said in perfect faith
[1:07:24] he said you
[1:07:25] jesus had faith in what he was and who
[1:07:28] he was
[1:07:28] he had faith in who he was you go listen
[1:07:31] to it and that gave him perfect faith
[1:07:33] i'm not saying it verbatim just go
[1:07:35] listen to the message he had faith
[1:07:37] in what he was and he says in order for
[1:07:40] us that perfect faith
[1:07:42] we have to have faith in what god has
[1:07:45] made us
[1:07:47] david had faith in what god had made him
[1:07:51] amen
[1:07:54] there's one bit first samuel 18.
[1:07:58] we'll just read this here and we'll go
[1:08:01] down to verse 14.
[1:08:03] remember david knew
[1:08:07] david knew he was going to become king
[1:08:12] and we could all say well of course he
[1:08:13] knew that you know he became you know we
[1:08:15] read it it's all in the past it's all
[1:08:16] happened
[1:08:17] but there are many times in his life
[1:08:19] where he's in great jeopardy
[1:08:21] and it was a hair's breath from being
[1:08:22] all over
[1:08:25] but you see david because he had
[1:08:27] confidence what god had made him he
[1:08:29] could behave himself in such a way
[1:08:31] and it says here in first samuel 18 14
[1:08:34] and 15
[1:08:35] and david behaved himself wisely in all
[1:08:38] his ways
[1:08:38] and the lord was with him wherefore when
[1:08:41] saul
[1:08:42] saw that he be but he behaved himself
[1:08:44] very wisely
[1:08:46] he was afraid of him so he was saul
[1:08:50] saul knew that the spirit of god had
[1:08:52] departed from him and he knew that the
[1:08:54] lord was with david
[1:08:55] but how david conducted himself it made
[1:08:59] because saul was his enemy we understand
[1:09:00] that
[1:09:01] so how david conducted himself made his
[1:09:04] enemy fear him
[1:09:06] now the devil comes across your path
[1:09:09] amen and god allows it to happen
[1:09:12] and it's done because god wants to prove
[1:09:15] the power of his salvation
[1:09:18] amen that's why job you know god said to
[1:09:21] you know he had fellowship with the
[1:09:23] devil one day have you considered my
[1:09:24] servant job he's perfect he's a perfect
[1:09:26] man
[1:09:28] and job gave the lamb sacrifice
[1:09:31] and brother tells us that god job had
[1:09:33] confidence in the lamb
[1:09:35] that's why he could stand the test the
[1:09:37] way he did because he had confidence in
[1:09:39] the lamb
[1:09:40] amen so what what was happening
[1:09:42] throughout that whole trial is that god
[1:09:44] was proving the power of his provided
[1:09:46] sacrifice
[1:09:48] in job's life yeah you're following me
[1:09:51] so far
[1:09:52] so god allows the devil to come across
[1:09:54] your path because god is wanting to
[1:09:57] prove the power of the cross in your
[1:09:58] life
[1:10:00] amen because many other people have the
[1:10:02] trials you have
[1:10:03] and they fall apart and sometimes we do
[1:10:07] fall apart but there's something in it
[1:10:08] says lord pick me up and try me one more
[1:10:10] time
[1:10:11] and he says i've been waiting for you to
[1:10:13] ask me that
[1:10:14] amen that's why he's our high priest
[1:10:16] that's why he's our intermediary that's
[1:10:17] why he's our high priest our lamb
[1:10:19] he still is our lamb it's not the man
[1:10:22] that falls it's him that gets back up
[1:10:24] that's what god counts as great
[1:10:26] when a man is willing to say lord i
[1:10:28] failed try me one more time
[1:10:31] amen so david he he acted himself in
[1:10:33] such a way in the presence of his
[1:10:35] enemies
[1:10:36] that his enemies begin to fear him
[1:10:39] the devil fed jesus jesus did not
[1:10:43] bend to the devil's temptation in the
[1:10:46] wilderness
[1:10:47] he was afraid of him that's why he spent
[1:10:49] all of his energy trying to destroy him
[1:10:51] that's why he anointed the scribes and
[1:10:53] pharisees he turned the whole place
[1:10:54] against him
[1:10:55] because he fed this man never a man had
[1:10:58] spake like this man the devil knew it
[1:11:00] and jesus behaved himself in such a way
[1:11:03] because he knew for this cause i've come
[1:11:04] into the world
[1:11:05] he he believed in what god had made him
[1:11:08] and he believed in one scripture that
[1:11:11] he'd come out of the grave
[1:11:12] remember jesus sure he was the word made
[1:11:14] flesh but he's also a man
[1:11:16] and he had to believe the word like we
[1:11:18] have to believe the word
[1:11:20] because he was the perfect example of a
[1:11:22] christian amen he became like us that we
[1:11:25] could become like
[1:11:26] him so he he he endured trials he had
[1:11:29] temptations
[1:11:30] he was tempted on all points but yet
[1:11:33] without sin he didn't fall for the
[1:11:34] temptation
[1:11:35] because he had to go through that to
[1:11:37] understand what we have to go through
[1:11:40] amen he was exactly like us he had the
[1:11:43] same brother
[1:11:44] said he was tempted by a woman he's
[1:11:45] tempted by all kinds of things
[1:11:47] but yet he did not give himself to the
[1:11:49] temptation
[1:11:51] amen because he was god but he's also a
[1:11:53] man
[1:11:54] and so he he behaved himself in such a
[1:11:56] way imagine there he's in
[1:11:58] he's in pilate's judgment hall the
[1:12:00] devil's hovering around watching the
[1:12:02] proceedings
[1:12:04] why doesn't he why doesn't he answer
[1:12:06] them back
[1:12:07] why doesn't he call for ten thousand
[1:12:09] legion you know how many legions of
[1:12:11] angels why doesn't he respond
[1:12:13] he was behaving himself wisely because
[1:12:16] he knew this was the purpose this was
[1:12:18] this is what he had to fulfill at that
[1:12:19] point of his journey
[1:12:21] and the devil fed this man and then
[1:12:24] finally when he was on the cross and he
[1:12:26] and he anchored the stinger of death
[1:12:27] into him pulled it out i said no he
[1:12:29] didn't pull it i was stuck and he said
[1:12:30] no i've got him he's dead
[1:12:32] it's finally all over but then it wasn't
[1:12:35] too long
[1:12:36] the devil goes down to hell puts his
[1:12:37] feet up in his lazy boy
[1:12:39] here's a knock on the door he says
[1:12:41] finally i've got you you're here
[1:12:43] no it was the other way around and jesus
[1:12:46] took the keys of hell death and the
[1:12:47] grave off him
[1:12:48] ascended on highly captivity captive and
[1:12:50] all these things greatest week in
[1:12:52] history is going on
[1:12:53] amen death burial resurrection of jesus
[1:12:55] christ amen
[1:12:56] and so he fed he he fed him
[1:13:00] and then that same life that he fed went
[1:13:02] into the apostles
[1:13:03] and then the devil fed the apostles
[1:13:06] that's why before the book of acts
[1:13:08] you know you see one place they want to
[1:13:11] stone jesus one place they want to throw
[1:13:12] him down a cliff and all these things
[1:13:14] and and he just walks around them where
[1:13:16] were the disciples when they were
[1:13:18] wanting to kill jesus
[1:13:19] they were with him why didn't those
[1:13:22] people try and kill the disciples then
[1:13:24] because that life that eternal life
[1:13:26] wasn't in them
[1:13:28] so he was they were not a threat to the
[1:13:29] devil they were people believing on him
[1:13:32] but they weren't yet as jesus said to
[1:13:34] peter when you're converted strengthen
[1:13:36] your brethren
[1:13:37] but then when that same life went into
[1:13:39] them in the day of pentecost
[1:13:41] then they would drag before the
[1:13:42] sanhedrin then they were you know don't
[1:13:44] preach in his name anymore though beaten
[1:13:46] they just rejoiced
[1:13:48] the devil got scared of them too because
[1:13:50] they behaved themselves wisely
[1:13:52] because they believed in what god had
[1:13:54] made them
[1:13:56] amen we have to believe have confidence
[1:14:00] in what god has made us amen
[1:14:03] you know brother brahms says that the
[1:14:04] devil can't take our lives until god
[1:14:06] our purpose is done upon this earth it
[1:14:09] doesn't matter
[1:14:10] what we go through how many hospital
[1:14:12] beds we end up in or how much sickness
[1:14:14] or
[1:14:14] being destitute on the street or
[1:14:16] whatever hardship if our purpose is not
[1:14:18] is not done upon this earth
[1:14:20] the devil cannot take our lives
[1:14:24] amen david knew
[1:14:27] sure you read the psalms he cries out
[1:14:29] like you know there was great times of
[1:14:31] distress
[1:14:32] sure there was and god was using those
[1:14:34] great times to mold him into the king he
[1:14:36] was meant to be
[1:14:38] amen that's why you see david
[1:14:41] when he finally stepped on the throne he
[1:14:43] had the character sure he fell in a
[1:14:44] couple of places but he had the
[1:14:45] character
[1:14:46] to be a godly king you see after solomon
[1:14:49] there one's down
[1:14:51] they did not have the character to sit
[1:14:53] on that throne
[1:14:54] because they weren't taken through that
[1:14:56] great desert of experience
[1:15:00] amen count it all joy
[1:15:05] when the fiery trials try you try your
[1:15:07] faith it's the trying of your faith
[1:15:10] count it all joy why is that because
[1:15:12] you're being molded
[1:15:13] and you're being shaped because there's
[1:15:15] a there's a character god
[1:15:17] god is going to have a bride with
[1:15:19] perfect character
[1:15:21] he's determined to have you in such a
[1:15:23] way he was determined to have david in
[1:15:25] such a way
[1:15:27] amen but david knew
[1:15:30] he knew he had to sit upon that throne
[1:15:33] amen i trust it's become a revelation to
[1:15:36] you
[1:15:38] there's a place at the wedding supper
[1:15:39] table with your name on
[1:15:42] amen he says you'll sit in my throne as
[1:15:45] i sit in my father's throne i trust is
[1:15:47] anchored in your soul
[1:15:48] there's a place that i'm gonna sit one
[1:15:50] day
[1:15:51] and it's not under some footstool some
[1:15:53] places could be on the highest throne
[1:15:54] there is
[1:15:56] amen with your lord so god allows these
[1:15:59] things i'm going through the ringer
[1:16:01] say hallelujah everything's turns upside
[1:16:04] down it's going to be all well
[1:16:06] this is what this bible tells me
[1:16:09] david didn't matter where he was that's
[1:16:11] amazing
[1:16:12] he didn't he he could have killed saul
[1:16:14] it would have been all over
[1:16:16] he was the one trying to take his life
[1:16:18] and he let him go
[1:16:20] because he could see beyond see it's
[1:16:23] interesting
[1:16:24] saul was of a former age still a
[1:16:27] believer
[1:16:28] samuel said today you'll be with me you
[1:16:30] know he's going to die
[1:16:31] he was a believer but but under a formal
[1:16:34] light
[1:16:34] and he was david now alexander an eagle
[1:16:37] anointing
[1:16:38] he didn't try and kill saul saul tried
[1:16:41] to kill him
[1:16:42] saul tried to you'd say you bring him to
[1:16:44] today's language
[1:16:45] saul character assassinated david
[1:16:49] he had him on the run he was trying to
[1:16:52] drag him down and do all kinds of things
[1:16:53] with him
[1:16:55] david had opportunities and it would
[1:16:58] have stuck too
[1:17:00] but he knew this was once the lord's
[1:17:04] anointed
[1:17:05] amen he had respect for saul even though
[1:17:08] saul was trying to kill him
[1:17:11] and he didn't he wasn't he could have
[1:17:13] killed him
[1:17:15] you'll know the story very well but
[1:17:16] you've got to put yourself in the story
[1:17:18] you've got to put yourself there when a
[1:17:20] brother or a sister comes against you
[1:17:24] amen do you go on facebook or get on the
[1:17:27] phone and kill them
[1:17:29] or he just you know their lord they're
[1:17:32] the lords anointed
[1:17:34] amen see
[1:17:37] he had such confidence that god had
[1:17:39] anointed him to become
[1:17:41] king that didn't matter what came his
[1:17:44] way
[1:17:45] even he could have just think of it
[1:17:46] here's the he'd have a coup
[1:17:48] just wipe them all off you know take out
[1:17:51] his royal garden all these things and
[1:17:53] just go onto the throne
[1:17:54] but he waited because he knew that god
[1:17:57] in his timing
[1:17:59] would orchestrate in such a way that now
[1:18:02] saul and jonathan died
[1:18:04] and now he was going to come upon the
[1:18:06] throne eventually
[1:18:07] amen and even
[1:18:10] even after that when there was war in
[1:18:12] israel civil war going on
[1:18:15] he knew he was going to be king over the
[1:18:16] entire place
[1:18:18] amen so how do we conduct ourselves
[1:18:22] when when it's not well they said
[1:18:25] military terms it's like blue on blue
[1:18:27] when your own team is trying to kill you
[1:18:29] instead of the enemy it's someone within
[1:18:31] trying to kill you
[1:18:32] how do you conduct yourself amen
[1:18:37] you know when he was rejected king
[1:18:40] that crippled guy was spitting at him
[1:18:42] and throwing rocks and cursing him and
[1:18:43] all these things when he's fleeing the
[1:18:44] city
[1:18:45] his guard was going to pull his sword
[1:18:46] it's easy to tell the story
[1:18:49] but david said no maybe the lord told
[1:18:50] him to do that
[1:18:53] as this was an israelite brother he was
[1:18:55] maybe crippled up in his doctrine or his
[1:18:57] walk with the lord
[1:18:59] but david said no just just leave him
[1:19:01] alone
[1:19:02] because he knew he would come back into
[1:19:04] power david did
[1:19:06] you see now how do we
[1:19:09] you say well that that's such a simple
[1:19:11] scene here's a man
[1:19:13] trying to throw stones at a runaway king
[1:19:15] but david was spiritual you can see mate
[1:19:17] there's more to what more to this than
[1:19:18] meets the eye
[1:19:20] it's more than just what i see he says
[1:19:22] maybe the lord's told them to do that
[1:19:25] amen now how about you
[1:19:30] someone comes against you or something
[1:19:32] comes against you
[1:19:34] do you rise up and say get a body gun
[1:19:37] say
[1:19:37] blow that guy's head off what do you say
[1:19:40] maybe the lord's allowed him to do this
[1:19:42] maybe the lord told him to do this amen
[1:19:46] david conducted himself sure he failed
[1:19:48] we all failed
[1:19:51] he failed more than soul failed did you
[1:19:53] read what he did read what sold it
[1:19:55] he did far more worse of things than
[1:19:56] what sold it
[1:19:58] but yet he is a man after god's own
[1:20:00] heart
[1:20:02] when things are exposed i think it was
[1:20:04] at the convention i'm not sure who said
[1:20:06] it
[1:20:06] they said when nathan came to samuel
[1:20:08] after david took bathsheba
[1:20:10] it was two years after the after the
[1:20:12] fact
[1:20:14] when he went in and gave the parable of
[1:20:15] the man with all the sheep and the man
[1:20:17] with the one cheek
[1:20:18] that was two years after david had uriah
[1:20:21] died normally you know murder and all
[1:20:23] these things
[1:20:24] two years after the fact but david had a
[1:20:27] heart that
[1:20:27] when something when the lord put a
[1:20:29] finger on something
[1:20:31] he said i'm the man i'm guilty
[1:20:34] amen that is a that is the character of
[1:20:38] christ being displayed
[1:20:40] amen remember we are david scripture's
[1:20:43] got compound meaning
[1:20:45] but you see if you can see how david and
[1:20:47] i encourage you go
[1:20:48] go and read david's life sure he did
[1:20:51] some things wrong
[1:20:53] but when the challenges came and he
[1:20:55] conducted himself in such a way
[1:20:57] you see david sure he wasn't such a good
[1:21:00] dad that's why epsilon raised up
[1:21:02] and maybe he saw that from his own
[1:21:04] father here comes samuel to
[1:21:06] to have a feast with him and worship at
[1:21:07] all these things dave is not even called
[1:21:11] he's just out doing his chores here
[1:21:13] comes you know it's like imagine brother
[1:21:15] brown comes into town and you're not
[1:21:16] invited he's coming to your house having
[1:21:18] a meal
[1:21:18] and you're out doing what you're what
[1:21:20] your dad tells you to do
[1:21:23] not even considered to be important
[1:21:26] and to me that's possibly why because
[1:21:28] david saw that example
[1:21:31] that's why epsilon wasn't dealt with
[1:21:33] there wasn't the communication between
[1:21:35] dad and son
[1:21:36] as it should have been but because david
[1:21:40] david possessed his office as king in
[1:21:42] such a way
[1:21:44] that even when absalom rose up and david
[1:21:47] didn't deal with it properly
[1:21:48] because he was god's king and he was
[1:21:50] being you know he's fully possessing it
[1:21:53] wasn't like ahab
[1:21:54] ahab was king but he wasn't king he
[1:21:56] wasn't possessing the officer's king
[1:21:58] properly
[1:21:58] so jezebel could run the place you see
[1:22:01] big big difference so even when epsilon
[1:22:04] rose up
[1:22:05] god respected david's office and he took
[1:22:08] care of epsilon
[1:22:10] but david should have dealt with it
[1:22:12] properly you see
[1:22:16] and so i trust i hope there's a blessing
[1:22:18] but
[1:22:20] you should look into his life because
[1:22:22] your life he's the shadow of you
[1:22:25] remember you should see jesus christ in
[1:22:27] every scripture we see jesus christ and
[1:22:28] david
[1:22:29] but because we're in christ you should
[1:22:31] see yourself in the same word
[1:22:34] amen hallelujah
[1:22:38] i mean so look into these things friends
[1:22:42] that same god remember the spirit of god
[1:22:44] was with david from that they are
[1:22:46] but because the blood of jesus christ
[1:22:48] was not shared it was just a blood of
[1:22:50] bulls and goats
[1:22:50] the spirit of god wasn't in him like he
[1:22:53] is you and i
[1:22:55] amen and the same god that he
[1:22:59] he believed in what god made him we have
[1:23:01] to believe what god has made us that's
[1:23:03] not being proud
[1:23:04] the more you recognize what god has done
[1:23:06] for you i trust the more humble it makes
[1:23:08] you
[1:23:09] the more yielded say lord you're so
[1:23:11] merciful and gracious to me
[1:23:13] amen it doesn't it doesn't lift you up
[1:23:14] he's trying to lift you up
[1:23:16] god doesn't want us as some downtrodden
[1:23:19] woman
[1:23:20] no no real husband that loves his wife
[1:23:23] treads her down
[1:23:24] that's right he wants to lift her up and
[1:23:27] love her and make her
[1:23:28] co-equal with him in everything that's
[1:23:31] right that's what the lord wants to do
[1:23:32] with us
[1:23:34] amen you say well that's making too much
[1:23:37] of me
[1:23:38] david david didn't make himself king
[1:23:41] he wasn't trying to be king he wasn't
[1:23:42] playing royal court out with the sheep
[1:23:45] he was just being a shepherd boy but god
[1:23:47] had already made him king
[1:23:48] he's like jeremiah before you were in
[1:23:50] your mother's womb i'd
[1:23:52] ordained you to be a prophet to the
[1:23:53] nations he couldn't help being king he
[1:23:55] was ordained to be king
[1:23:56] you can't help being the bride of jesus
[1:23:58] christ you're ordained to become it
[1:24:02] amen you had to be it's in you to be it
[1:24:05] you say i have my humanity just die
[1:24:07] daily don't don't look at this thing
[1:24:10] the greatest remember brother brown said
[1:24:12] the greatest enemy i have is
[1:24:14] william branham because the devil's
[1:24:16] defeated he's been defeated for two
[1:24:18] thousand years from calvary he was
[1:24:20] defeated at calvary
[1:24:21] he's a defeated being now you just gotta
[1:24:24] defeat yourself
[1:24:25] how do you defeat yourself just yield
[1:24:28] yourself to the lord
[1:24:29] not my will but thy will be done
[1:24:33] amen can we honey can you come play the
[1:24:36] piano
[1:24:39] amen that's all we have to do
[1:24:45] look through the eyes of the word
[1:24:46] friends god's promise
[1:24:48] if he said something just lay hold of it
[1:24:52] don't be afraid to say what if it the
[1:24:53] devil says what if it doesn't work
[1:24:55] what if it doesn't work brother and says
[1:24:58] why should i worry
[1:24:59] worry has no virtue i'll believe because
[1:25:02] faith might deliver me
[1:25:04] that's what he says just believe it oh
[1:25:06] it's never been done for just believe it
[1:25:09] amen take god at his word david talk
[1:25:12] about his word
[1:25:13] i'm a circumcised believer and i'm
[1:25:15] standing in my inheritance
[1:25:16] this devil must die amen we can do the
[1:25:19] same thing
[1:25:21] hallelujah amen brother andy my voice is
[1:25:24] terrible so i'm going to call you up
[1:25:27] amen let's just stand shall we let's
