[38:10] we're going to go to Luke 13 again
[38:14] there's a slideshow wait I need to
[38:18] maybe I should just do it old school and
[38:20] just get some batteries
[38:27] so Luke 13 we're going to continue well
[38:29] I'm going to use the same scripture as
[38:31] last Sunday we're going to go in a
[38:33] totally different direction
[38:35] um
[38:43] all right
[38:45] can we drive oh I can drive cool praise
[38:48] the Lord Luke 13 and 10.
[38:50] and we're going to read from Mark
[38:52] um as well so Luke 13 and 10 we're going
[38:55] to read down to um verse 13 again and he
[38:58] was teaching in one of the synagogues on
[39:00] the Sabbath and behold there was a woman
[39:02] which had a spirit of infirmity 18 years
[39:04] and was bowed together and could have no
[39:07] wise lift up herself
[39:09] and when Jesus saw her he's he called
[39:11] her to him and said unto her Woman Thou
[39:14] Art loose from mine infirmity and he
[39:16] laid his hands on her and immediately
[39:17] she was made straight and glorified God
[39:21] praise the Lord so she was loosed amen
[39:23] and then if we go back to Mark 11 and
[39:27] we're going to read I have it on this
[39:29] I'm here Mark 11 and 22.
[39:32] um we're just familiar piece of
[39:33] scripture for for us all I'm sure but
[39:36] Mark 11 and 22 says and Jesus answering
[39:39] saith unto them have faith in God
[39:42] for Billy I say unto you that whosoever
[39:44] shall sand to this mountain be thou
[39:45] removed and
[39:47] um and beta removed and bid our cast
[39:50] into the sea and shall not doubt in his
[39:52] heart but Shall Believe those that those
[39:54] things which he says shall come to pass
[39:56] he shall have whatsoever he saith
[39:58] therefore I say unto you what's the
[40:01] thing what things however ye desire When
[40:03] you pray believe that you receive them
[40:04] and you shall have them and when you

[40:09] ought against any that um that your
[40:12] father also which is in heaven May

[40:19] is in heaven forgive your trespasses

[41:50] amen amen God bless you friends you may
[41:52] have your seats this morning I want to
[41:54] um
[41:55] I want to go into so these actually it's
[41:57] kind of well not random but interesting
[42:00] that these last scriptures we read as
[42:02] the last two services that I've taken
[42:03] but I want to go into uh how uh I want
[42:08] to go into the third pool this is going
[42:09] to be a bit of a teaching but you know
[42:11] just sit and if you get a bit tired
[42:12] stand up and yeah we'll have a praise
[42:14] break maybe but you know
[42:15] um but it's very important because
[42:17] because things can uh misunderstandings
[42:20] can can can put us into a prison now
[42:22] brother Branham has this dream and I
[42:24] just want to go through this we're going
[42:25] to break it down but this is a works as
[42:28] Faith Express in one of his last sermons
[42:29] he preaches now I had a dream the other
[42:31] morning I don't dream very often I'm not
[42:33] a dreamer but I dream that I've seen a
[42:35] man a young fellow in shackles he was
[42:36] trying to get out and I said somebody
[42:38] told me those are horrible people have
[42:40] nothing to do with them I've seen this
[42:42] young fellow getting out of his shackle
[42:44] so I just let him alone I thought well
[42:46] I'll just see what he does and so when
[42:48] he got out he was a nice fellow and I
[42:50] seen others trying to get out now this
[42:51] is only a dream and I walked over this
[42:53] way I've seen a brother Roy borders a
[42:55] very good friend of mine lives in
[42:56] California looked like there was
[42:58] something wrong his eyes were half
[43:00] closed and great big maybe cancer or
[43:02] something over his eyes and someone was
[43:04] trying to pull me away from my screen
[43:06] brother borders and the name of the Lord
[43:07] Jesus snap out of that now this is all
[43:09] symbolic right but this applies to a lot
[43:11] of situations in life in our walk with
[43:13] God and he could just barely speak to us
[43:16] and brother Brown it'll have to take
[43:17] something more than this I just can't
[43:19] grasp it brother Baron I just can't
[43:21] grasp but I said oh brother borders I
[43:23] love him and someone pulled me away and
[43:25] I looked and there was a lady standing
[43:27] over here
[43:28] um that I when I was a little boy I used
[43:30] to haul groceries from the grocery store
[43:32] to the people and her name was Mrs
[43:34] Fenton she lives in Jefferson
[43:36] Jeffersonville yet a personal friend to
[43:38] the wife and I and she said brother Bram
[43:40] Deliver Us from us I said this is a
[43:43] house of hell now notice this he said
[43:45] you've been misunderstood and these and
[43:48] you misunderstand these people too these
[43:50] are fine people but I looked over there
[43:52] at a great big seller or big walls down
[43:54] beneath a great big cave and some great
[43:56] big iron bars eight or nine inches thick
[43:59] and people out of their mind twisting
[44:00] arms and legs beating their heads like
[44:02] this and she was crying saying deliver
[44:04] the people brother Brown and said help
[44:06] us we're in trouble she herself I know
[44:08] her she belongs to I believe the Church
[44:10] of Christ or the Christian church called
[44:12] The Church of the Brethren now I'm just
[44:14] going to stop it just well let's just
[44:15] read through them we're going to break
[44:16] this down I looked around and said I
[44:18] wish I could and going on looking around
[44:20] and little and my little bitty body and
[44:23] them great big iron bars and those poor
[44:25] people in there and you couldn't get to
[44:26] them them iron bars were sitting close
[44:29] together and I looked and they were
[44:30] beating their head out like they're
[44:32] going out of their mind and I've seen
[44:34] some lights flickering around in there I
[44:36] looked up and there stood the Lord Jesus
[44:38] with the lights of a rainbow around him
[44:40] he was looking right straight to me said
[44:42] deliver those people he went away I
[44:44] thought well how could I deliver them I
[44:46] haven't got strength enough in my arms
[44:48] to break those bars so I said House of
[44:50] Hell give way to the name of Jesus
[44:52] Christ and all the creaking and popping
[44:54] and rocks rolling and bars falling and
[44:56] the people running and screaming
[44:57] delivered and screaming at the top of
[44:59] their voice and all was delivered amen
[45:03] now that may seem like just a dream but
[45:05] it's amazing how how people can
[45:08] misunderstand and it can cause them to
[45:10] inter actually enter a prison now notice
[45:11] as I've highlighted a few these these
[45:13] these things here so so these people are
[45:15] Christian people in this dream they're
[45:16] not unbelievers they're not even some
[45:19] other religion they are they're
[45:20] Christian people they're good people but
[45:22] you see people can people can see see
[45:24] this Roy Boris was actually a close
[45:26] friend of brother Branham but you see so
[45:28] so this is all a symbolic dream we
[45:30] understand he wasn't literally having
[45:31] cancer over his eyes they weren't
[45:33] literally in a prison all twisted up and
[45:34] mangled but it was it was relating to a
[45:36] spiritual condition of a people that
[45:38] misunderstood and you see he says I just
[45:40] can't grasp it brother bear I just can't
[45:42] grasp it he couldn't grasp what God was
[45:44] doing in his day and I think the reason
[45:46] is he was mentally trying to understand
[45:47] what was going on and when you try and
[45:49] mentally put the word together you'll
[45:51] never be able to grasp it you know you
[45:53] know the Bible is not a textbook that we
[45:55] learned or the spoken word is not a
[45:56] textbook that we learn it's actually God
[45:58] revealing himself but we have to
[46:00] prayerfully say Lord reveal yourself to
[46:02] me it's actually a relationship Lord I
[46:04] want to know you more basically he was
[46:05] trying to grasp it in his mind and he
[46:07] couldn't do it but you see so
[46:09] spiritually now he is in this prison
[46:11] because he didn't understand what was
[46:12] going on but the cancer over his eyes he
[46:15] could barely see why because that was
[46:16] his spiritual condition and so we don't
[46:19] want to ever end up in a way that we
[46:21] don't you know we just can't see
[46:23] spiritually you know you know how we're
[46:25] doing spiritually you know this morning
[46:26] if this was a natural doctors would take
[46:29] you know heart pressure and pulse and
[46:31] all you know take different um you know
[46:33] Bloods and odds and whatever more but
[46:34] how about spiritually today how are we
[46:36] doing how are you feeling you've just
[46:38] come into a doctor's office I didn't
[46:40] think you'd really think about that when
[46:41] you came here but here we are in a
[46:42] doctor's office and the great Physicians
[46:44] here aiming to take care of us you see
[46:46] but notice this now brother see see the
[46:49] reason they are in this house of hell is
[46:51] because he uh this woman saying this Mrs
[46:54] Fina is saying you have been
[46:55] misunderstood so a misunderstanding
[46:58] caused these people to end up in the
[46:59] spiritually Twisted condition and they
[47:02] and they because they didn't misunderst
[47:04] you know they misunderstood him now how
[47:06] easy is it from a misunderstanding to
[47:07] put us into a prison you know where we
[47:10] can misunderstand one another and we can
[47:12] become spiritually twisted up because of
[47:15] misunderstandings between one another
[47:17] you know at prison people act
[47:19] differently in a prison they do when
[47:22] they're walking free you know when
[47:24] you're in prison you gotta You Gotta
[47:25] Wear prison clothes you eat prison food
[47:27] you do prison things right you don't
[47:30] walk free don't just decide I'm gonna go
[47:31] drive and see this person go to the shop
[47:33] no no you're stuck in a prison and this
[47:35] is what a misunderstanding or a complex
[47:37] can can can do to someone is is it
[47:41] actually puts them into a prison
[47:42] mentality now when they're around
[47:44] everyone else they can be themselves
[47:46] when they come to the presence of the
[47:47] person with the misunderstanding they go
[47:49] into a prison mentality they begin to
[47:51] act different their character changes
[47:53] their nature changes when they're around
[47:54] that person and it's not because of the
[47:56] person it's a misunderstanding to that
[47:58] person we must be very careful we can
[48:00] discern the body of the Lord look Beyond
[48:02] carnality look Beyond this human flesh
[48:04] and actually discern actually we're all
[48:06] the body of Christ amen so we don't let
[48:09] misunderstandings put us into put us
[48:11] into a prison see these people all these
[48:14] people all twisted up because they
[48:16] misunderstood brother Brandon you can
[48:18] say they misunderstood the word now it's
[48:20] very unfortunately this this can happen
[48:23] in the same way with us is that is that
[48:26] people can be Believers can be twisted
[48:28] up uh now now I went from just talking
[48:31] about just misunderstandings between one
[48:33] another so you're going to think about
[48:34] it how do you act around everyone should
[48:36] be the same Jesus was Jesus around
[48:38] everyone he was Jesus to the Pharisees
[48:41] he was Jesus to the blind man he was
[48:42] Jesus to Legion he was Jesus to his
[48:45] disciples he was the same person we
[48:47] should be the same to everyone Jesus
[48:48] didn't have complexes he could have got
[48:50] a lot of them but he didn't have any
[48:51] right because he stayed surrendered to
[48:53] to the father in him right so I suppose
[48:56] the same thing with us we should be the
[48:58] same to everyone
[48:59] we should be I should be bent to you I
[49:01] should be Bend to the person on the
[49:02] street been to whoever I should be the
[49:04] same person I shouldn't be different
[49:05] because I come into the prince of
[49:07] someone else right because if I do then
[49:09] then I'm in a prison because of a
[49:11] misunderstanding or a complex I've got
[49:13] to be loose from that amen but I'm so
[49:15] glad we could say House of Hell give way
[49:17] to the name of Jesus Christ amen we're
[49:19] not we're not we're not called to be
[49:20] bound we're actually called to be loose
[49:22] to walk free with our lord Jesus so you
[49:24] see now these people were in a prison
[49:26] because of misunderstanding now
[49:28] unfortunately the enemy Believers become
[49:32] um misunderstand the prophet and the
[49:36] word of God by preachers that twist the
[49:38] scripture in quotes and then spiritually
[49:40] people get all up trapped in a prison
[49:42] again amen but they get trapped by
[49:44] misunderstandings and I'm at the very
[49:46] least or false doctrines at the worst
[49:48] and actually Believers like these ones
[49:50] get caught up spiritually in a house of
[49:52] hell now I wasn't expecting a bunch of
[49:55] hallelujahs right now but you know I
[49:56] just want to take this through because
[49:57] you know God is here to loose us like we
[50:00] read there about the woman in the
[50:01] synagogue there that that the Lord
[50:03] called her to himself to loose her and I
[50:06] believe this is the hour where the Bride
[50:08] of Jesus Christ has been loosed to
[50:10] fulfill her role in the end time amen
[50:13] that we're not here to be bound down and
[50:15] troubled and and in a prison of House of
[50:17] hell because we misunderstand or you
[50:20] know a false Doctrine has got us bound
[50:21] but we're here to be loosed Amen to walk
[50:24] with God as he wants us to walk is
[50:26] everyone following me this morning amen
[50:28] because God wants us to walk with him
[50:29] right that's that's the very reason he
[50:31] revealed himself to you is that you'd
[50:33] walk with him amen praise God so you
[50:35] know he says you have been misunderstood
[50:37] and you misunderstand these people so
[50:42] actually God went after him when he got
[50:45] corrected him when he was saying there's
[50:46] all these bunch of rookies and rakitas
[50:48] in these denominations he said God said
[50:50] don't call them that because they are my
[50:53] children they just have to come out and
[50:55] walk with me so we should you never have
[50:57] a bad attitude someone can actually be
[50:59] you know you're you're your attitude
[51:01] towards someone
[51:02] can actually dictate to them
[51:04] their Eternal destination that's why we
[51:07] should always be loving and caring
[51:09] doesn't matter who it is we should be
[51:10] the same to everyone which never ever
[51:12] put someone in a box and say that's them
[51:14] that's their lot who says are you God
[51:16] I'm not I'm Not Jesus right I'm not God
[51:18] he knows the end from the beginning he
[51:20] knows where they're going to end up so
[51:21] let that to God right if we can just get
[51:24] someone just one step closer to God
[51:26] praise God I think that's well worth it
[51:28] right I ain't meant to encourage someone
[51:30] just to keep walking in whatever light
[51:31] they have praise the Lord I think that's
[51:33] well worth it so you know we must never
[51:35] write people off because remember God
[51:36] has different you know there's the bride
[51:38] there's the church there's all different
[51:39] kind of people in heaven it's not just
[51:41] the bride and God and that's it right so
[51:43] we never want to just write people off
[51:45] we always want to have a real love and a
[51:47] real
[51:47] faith for them amen that God can do a
[51:51] greater work in their lives that's how
[51:53] we want to be so we don't ever want
[51:54] people to be stuck in a house of hell
[51:56] because of our misunderstandings of them
[52:00] amen
[52:02] Hallelujah so
[52:05] misunderstandings now
[52:08] there's a lot of things that people will
[52:10] misunderstand and have misunderstood in
[52:12] this message that have actually bound
[52:13] them down
[52:14] and and if you've been in this in these
[52:17] boats we're here to just say you can
[52:19] walk free
[52:20] because it's such a it's such a trap I
[52:23] don't know
[52:25] I need like three different devices just
[52:27] actually
[52:28] oh boy
[52:29] okay because I got my notes I got my
[52:31] slides on here what's next I got my
[52:33] notes what I'm going to say about those
[52:34] slides here I've got this to drive that
[52:35] so man this is way too technical
[52:39] but I wanted to put everything up on the
[52:41] PowerPoint so you could um follow along
[52:43] and I knew where I was going to
[52:46] so we don't want to we don't ever want
[52:48] to be caught now now a big thing
[52:51] all right network error okay we'll just
[52:53] forget about that okay we're just going
[52:54] to run with this okay so but you see now
[52:56] you see so
[52:59] did I do that
[53:02] I shouldn't even be allowed this but you
[53:04] see now so so they were stuck in this
[53:06] place but then some lights begin to
[53:08] flicker in around there so God began to
[53:10] come upon the scene because God doesn't
[53:12] want us Bound in any way he wants us
[53:14] free amen but you see now God uses his
[53:17] body to free his people that's why the
[53:19] Lord told Brother Baron and the dream
[53:21] you loose them because God works through
[53:23] the body right sister brother Bram and
[53:26] his physical in his physical ability of
[53:29] course could not and we in our physical
[53:30] ability cannot free anyone but you've
[53:32] got to speak the word in faith and then
[53:34] God can act on the word you say Amen so
[53:37] it's so important that we say the right
[53:39] thing
[53:40] praise a lot so so House of how good
[53:43] waste of them are Jesus Christ and all
[53:44] was delivered now a classic example of
[53:48] this I'm just going to break down a few
[53:50] of these is that people you know so we
[53:53] all know the story brother but I'm told
[53:55] of when he was translated beyond the
[53:57] curtain of time right it was more than a
[53:59] dream more than a vision but it was
[54:01] literally there he saw all the redeemed
[54:03] and he was in that perfect place and you
[54:05] know he was told you must have perfect
[54:06] love to get there right without there
[54:09] without perfect love you cannot get to
[54:10] that great Eternal land so what happens
[54:12] is people get twisted in their mind okay
[54:14] so I've got to receive the Holy Ghost
[54:16] and then I've got to get perfect love
[54:18] and then and then now I need and then
[54:21] now there's also the third pull that's
[54:23] going to be manifested so I've got to
[54:24] get all these three things and then and
[54:26] then and then finally I'm ready right
[54:29] but you see now if you're chasing
[54:31] something that you already have you'll
[54:33] you'll be chasing nothing
[54:35] right but if you realize what you have
[54:37] you can use it right so so this actually
[54:40] becomes a prison where people get in
[54:42] their mind okay I may have the Holy
[54:43] Ghost but now I need perfect love
[54:44] because I want to go to heaven because I
[54:46] love the Lord Jesus but so they're
[54:48] chasing something they already have
[54:49] right so I want to lose this this
[54:52] morning I'm going to realize what's in
[54:54] your hand like Moses asked what's in his
[54:55] hand he says it's just a Shepherd stick
[54:57] and God wanted to tell no you've got
[54:58] more than a Shepherd stick you have
[55:00] what's you already have in your hand
[55:02] what is needed to deliver your people
[55:04] it's the same thing if you have the
[55:05] baptism of the Holy Ghost I'll just say
[55:07] the conclusion right now so you know
[55:09] where I'm going if you have the baptism
[55:10] true baptism Holy Ghost you have perfect
[55:12] love
[55:13] that means you're on your way to heaven
[55:15] right and then if you have perfect love
[55:17] you have the baptism the Holy Ghost you
[55:18] have the character of Christ at the
[55:20] third book of manifest in your life and
[55:21] you have the third pull amen so so
[55:24] that's my sermon let's go home praise
[55:26] God
[55:26] all right but I just wanted to but but
[55:28] this can bind people down
[55:31] because I think well and then even even
[55:32] with adoption the adoption robe is the
[55:35] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[55:36] so people think well well I've got the
[55:38] Holy Ghost now I need to get adopted no
[55:39] you're already adopted
[55:42] I won't go into that just now but but
[55:44] see see people start chasing things they
[55:47] already have and then I think well I
[55:49] have no ability to call upon God and God
[55:51] can't work in my life because I need
[55:52] those things but you already have it
[55:54] it's just terminology like your
[55:56] terminology can trap us in our mind but
[55:58] we're free people right now amen so this
[56:00] is just from this he says this is what
[56:02] you preach so so he's beyond the curtain
[56:04] of time he heard a voice there saying
[56:06] now uh then I Heard a Voice in that
[56:08] spoke to me in that room said this is
[56:10] what you preach was the Holy Ghost this
[56:12] is perfect love and nothing can enter
[56:14] here without it and I'm more determined
[56:16] than ever in my life that it takes
[56:17] perfect love to enter there there is no
[56:20] jealousy there's no tiredness there's no
[56:21] death sickness could never uh could
[56:24] never in their mortality you just could
[56:27] never uh could never make you old that
[56:29] uh they could not cry there was just one
[56:31] Joy so people you know preach you've got
[56:34] to have perfect love you've got to get
[56:35] perfect love to get into heaven and but
[56:38] people have perfect love
[56:39] but you see it can become a house of
[56:41] hell because of a misunderstanding you
[56:43] see so so I'm here to unravel some
[56:45] misunderstandings you may never have
[56:46] these but in case you come across it
[56:48] you'll know actually I've already I'm
[56:50] I'm fully equipped and ready
[56:53] amen so we can't ever think that it
[56:55] takes nothing you know um uh we need to
[56:57] get the Holy Ghost then perfect love no
[56:58] if you have the Holy Ghost you have
[57:01] perfect love because remember God is
[57:03] love right it's not just a feeling that
[57:05] you have that you love everyone it's
[57:06] more than that it's a person God is love
[57:10] amen
[57:13] it says and grieve not the holy spirit
[57:15] of God we're by your seal to the day of
[57:16] your Redemption so if you have the Holy
[57:18] Ghost you seal to the day of your
[57:19] Redemption it's actually as if you're
[57:20] already there because you've got what
[57:21] you need to go there
[57:23] praise the Lord amen that should make us
[57:25] feel real happy right now oh but I've
[57:27] got all these trials in trouble it's
[57:28] fine I've got what I need to get there I
[57:31] mean when trouble is no more I'm gonna
[57:32] be there amen so we can we can rest in
[57:35] that praise the Lord now
[57:38] Hallelujah is Yvonne with me I just want
[57:40] to we're just gonna walk along okay
[57:42] we're going to have a nice just a stroll
[57:44] this morning I just I don't want any
[57:46] misunderstandings I'm here to get rid of
[57:49] misunderstandings
[57:50] amen now
[57:52] we talk a lot we know we have a lot of
[57:54] jargon and one of that is is speaking
[57:55] about the first second and third pull
[57:58] now which which is faces of brother
[58:00] Baron's Ministry now he says here he
[58:03] says now notice of um uh the very day
[58:05] when this measure when he starts on but
[58:07] when he begins to declare his message
[58:08] see the first pull was healing the
[58:10] second Paul was prophesying the third
[58:12] pull is the opening of the word the the
[58:14] Mysteries revealed no more there no more
[58:16] higher order to reveal the word than
[58:18] prophets but the only way the prophet
[58:20] can be Vindicated is by the word
[58:21] remember the third pull was opening of
[58:23] them Seven Seals to reveal the hidden
[58:25] truth that's been sealed in the word now
[58:27] some people just say well praise God the
[58:29] third pull is just the opening of the
[58:31] word and I know the doctrines so
[58:32] therefore I've got the third pull but
[58:34] remember God's Doctrine comes with power
[58:36] when the word comes open there's a Power
[58:39] released Amen to manifest what has been
[58:42] revealed right so when Martin Luther
[58:44] when it was revealed to the just shall
[58:45] live by faith there was a power of that
[58:47] word that was in the Bible already was
[58:49] released to the people that they could
[58:50] walk live justified by faith they didn't
[58:53] need to say all these novenia prayers
[58:55] and pay for their sins and do these
[58:57] pilgrimages and by these these relics
[58:59] all that nonsense no their faith
[59:01] Justified them so it gave them an
[59:03] overcoming power right because when the
[59:05] word comes open it releases a power just
[59:07] like when the law I could say there was
[59:09] power in the law to give them the
[59:11] promised land one will chase a thousand
[59:13] until Chase ten thousand right because
[59:15] when the word came open on Mount Sinai
[59:18] gave them power to actually dwell in
[59:19] their land and cast out the enemy right
[59:21] so and there's the same thing with
[59:22] sanctification when when where when the
[59:25] second work of Grace was revealed to the
[59:27] church it gave the people power to live
[59:28] a holy life well because when it was
[59:30] already in the scripture when the word
[59:32] came open it releases a power rights is
[59:35] the same thing with the third pull it's
[59:36] more than just see the third pull is not
[59:38] just mentally understanding Doctrine but
[59:41] there's a power in that doctrine that is
[59:43] released to the church that gives them
[59:45] overcoming power in the age they live
[59:47] amen see so it's more than just an
[59:49] understanding there's actually a see all
[59:52] Revelation has a supernatural element
[59:54] right and that Supernatural element must
[59:56] be manifested in our lives see it see
[59:59] sure when the Holy Ghost comes he'll
[1:00:01] give you an understanding right because
[1:00:02] you're leading guide you into all truth
[1:00:04] but it's more than just that a
[1:00:06] revelation has an outworking
[1:00:09] right it has an outworking like Peter we
[1:00:11] no doubt the Christ
[1:00:13] there's a revelation but it had an
[1:00:14] outworking
[1:00:15] what did he say when the 17 all them
[1:00:18] left he said to whom shall I go you you
[1:00:20] alone have the words of eternal life so
[1:00:22] that Revelation and outworking saying
[1:00:24] this man is more than a Prophet this is
[1:00:26] Messiah and and even with Peter's
[1:00:29] failings and all kinds of things he
[1:00:30] stayed with the Lord why because that
[1:00:33] Revelation had an outworking sure he had
[1:00:34] to go to Pentecost he had to really meet
[1:00:36] that same Lord Jesus had to dwell on him
[1:00:38] but you see all the Revelation has now
[1:00:40] working so it's more than just it's more
[1:00:42] than just a teaching even though these
[1:00:45] things should be taught right but
[1:00:47] there's a power in it as if I I just
[1:00:49] want to labor this because our God is
[1:00:51] more Supernatural I think we even are
[1:00:52] aware of and where he is the
[1:00:55] Supernatural is happening and we want
[1:00:57] him to be we want to be where he is
[1:00:58] right so so
[1:01:01] the third poll is more than just the uh
[1:01:03] just an understanding of the doctrine
[1:01:04] see when the word opens that's Christ
[1:01:06] revealing himself
[1:01:08] amen so again opening the word there
[1:01:10] could just be some jug and what is it
[1:01:11] when Jesus reveals himself it's already
[1:01:14] here but it has to become revealed
[1:01:17] amen that's why we don't have a second
[1:01:18] Bible this is the Bible we have this is
[1:01:20] our absolute praise the Lord
[1:01:23] amen so now he begins to speak about the
[1:01:26] the the manifestations of this third
[1:01:28] Paul he says now remember it'll never be
[1:01:31] there'll never be an impersonation of
[1:01:34] that because it can't be now I'm going
[1:01:36] to explain this I want to read it then
[1:01:37] we're going to break this down see it
[1:01:38] cannot be now it's in existence so so
[1:01:40] it's here now this power of the spoken
[1:01:41] word and I have I am warned of this that
[1:01:44] soon right at this time now it's just
[1:01:46] happening so it could identify its
[1:01:47] presence among you see it's not uh it
[1:01:51] will not be used in a great way until
[1:01:53] this Council begins to tighten up and
[1:01:54] then when it does when that the
[1:01:56] Pentecostal so forth can almost
[1:01:58] impersonate anything can be done but
[1:02:00] when that time comes when the squeeze
[1:02:02] comes down then you'll see what you've
[1:02:04] seen temporarily be manifested in the
[1:02:06] fullness of its power so he was speaking
[1:02:09] of when he was saying about this it's an
[1:02:11] existence it's been identified among us
[1:02:13] he was speaking about the five times
[1:02:15] that it was manifested twice twice was
[1:02:18] the creation of Life which was the which
[1:02:20] was the speaking the squirrels into
[1:02:21] existence and brother Bram shot those
[1:02:24] squirrels ate those squirrels and you
[1:02:25] know got fit on those screws they
[1:02:27] weren't a vision he actually literally
[1:02:28] ate them amen it was the resurrection of
[1:02:31] Life the fish coming back to life it was
[1:02:33] the control of nature the storm speak
[1:02:35] being being spoken out of existence in
[1:02:37] Colorado amen it was that tumor the size
[1:02:40] of a grapefruit in the side of his wife
[1:02:42] being spoken out of existence when he
[1:02:44] was on the other side of the country and
[1:02:46] it was the salvation of how he writes
[1:02:48] two boys
[1:02:49] amen that's the manifestations of the
[1:02:51] third pull now I don't need a storm to
[1:02:54] be spoken out of existence I don't need
[1:02:56] squirrels to be created right remember
[1:02:59] all these things that wasn't brother
[1:03:00] Bram saying I want this right now it was
[1:03:03] God moving on him and making it happen
[1:03:05] and when Hetty writes two boys were were
[1:03:08] saved that was her faith that triggered
[1:03:10] it it wasn't the prophet that that
[1:03:12] caused see he's brother Bobby said this
[1:03:14] wasn't me that did it it's just him that
[1:03:15] did it through him right but you see now
[1:03:17] this power is actually in us right now
[1:03:20] it's in existence it's here right now
[1:03:21] see
[1:03:23] people seem to think well the squeeze
[1:03:26] hasn't come on so it's not going to be
[1:03:27] here no but it is here there is a
[1:03:29] squeeze right now
[1:03:30] we're squeezed out
[1:03:32] we're not accepted
[1:03:36] you know we're called a cult that's not
[1:03:39] a shock to anyone here you know but but
[1:03:41] like Peter's uh Paul said in the way
[1:03:43] that's called heresy and in a different
[1:03:44] translation in the way that's called The
[1:03:46] Cult I worship the god of my father is
[1:03:48] believing all the prophets
[1:03:50] so so he he was called The Cult because
[1:03:53] he believed all the word
[1:03:54] it's the same thing with us we're called
[1:03:56] The Cult why because we believe the
[1:03:57] whole Bible
[1:03:58] all right and so now but you see it's
[1:04:01] identified among us there but you see
[1:04:04] some people think well brother Brown's
[1:04:07] got to come back to the power of the
[1:04:08] spoken word will happen no the same holy
[1:04:10] ghost that was in him is in the bride so
[1:04:12] the voice of God brother Ram says is in
[1:04:15] the bride right so that power is in you
[1:04:17] and I if you have the Holy Ghost it's in
[1:04:20] you it's not coming it's already here
[1:04:22] well we need a squeeze how much squeeze
[1:04:24] do we need
[1:04:25] you know it's like the it's like the
[1:04:28] Jews they didn't they didn't go to sleep
[1:04:30] one night and they had total Liberty in
[1:04:32] Europe no trouble and then the next
[1:04:34] morning they woke up in Auschwitz The
[1:04:35] Squeeze was a slow progression on their
[1:04:37] lives political Maneuvers and and
[1:04:39] persecution oppression and they found
[1:04:42] themselves in Auschwitz and it's the
[1:04:44] same thing with us how much squeeze do
[1:04:46] we need when people always looking off
[1:04:48] way off in the future for this to happen
[1:04:49] but I believe it's now
[1:04:51] it's right here that power is here Among
[1:04:54] Us it's been identified in this place
[1:04:57] amen and and
[1:04:59] um yep you know so so it's here
[1:05:03] but you say well how do I get this third
[1:05:05] pool power well it's very simple if you
[1:05:08] have perfect love if you have the Holy
[1:05:09] Ghost I'm just going to repeat this if
[1:05:11] you have the Holy Ghost you have perfect
[1:05:13] love and if you have the Holy Ghost you
[1:05:15] have the character of Christ and if you
[1:05:16] have the character Christ you've got the
[1:05:17] third pull
[1:05:19] ey all right amen so now this power the
[1:05:23] spoken word this is what we read in Mark
[1:05:25] if ye say to this mountain right so so
[1:05:28] this very power is in the people but
[1:05:30] it's very interesting here it says now
[1:05:32] it says this will not be impersonated
[1:05:36] see because it takes the character of
[1:05:38] Christ to have to have the power of the
[1:05:42] spoken word remember this power is the
[1:05:44] power of creation it's the one thing the
[1:05:46] devil cannot do he cannot correct he
[1:05:49] perverts he can only pervert what God
[1:05:51] has done what is sin righteousness
[1:05:53] perverted what is adultery the right act
[1:05:55] perverted right so sin is righteousness
[1:05:58] perverted he can't create anything he
[1:06:00] only can pervert so but and and what he
[1:06:04] wants more than anything is the power of
[1:06:06] creation but he cannot get it but God in
[1:06:09] his great Mercy to to show the devil the
[1:06:11] power of his salvation takes a fallen
[1:06:14] people redeems him by the blood fills
[1:06:17] them with his own spirit and that power
[1:06:19] of Creation The Devil cannot have he
[1:06:20] places in your hands in your mouth
[1:06:24] amen
[1:06:25] now another thing that people wonder
[1:06:27] about now I feel like I'm going through
[1:06:29] this rather quickly but hey if we do
[1:06:30] that's fine you know people wonder about
[1:06:33] now how on Earth do other Christians and
[1:06:36] even non-christians and even witches
[1:06:37] have the supernatural this can be a
[1:06:39] prison
[1:06:40] because people think well if they get
[1:06:42] the Supernatural and we want the
[1:06:44] supernatural why do we have to live this
[1:06:45] kind of life if they get it just living
[1:06:46] any kind of life
[1:06:48] and so this can be this can be a real
[1:06:51] um a real prison because people do not
[1:06:53] understand that that that it's more than
[1:06:56] just
[1:06:57] uh wait well I gotta find no okay it
[1:07:02] takes a character for the power of the
[1:07:03] spoken word anything without character
[1:07:06] is satanic right so it's very important
[1:07:08] CC people can be even witches have
[1:07:10] Supernatural but they don't have the
[1:07:12] character of God
[1:07:13] right so what is it Satanic sure wrong
[1:07:15] anointing but even people can have the
[1:07:17] Holy Ghost anointing but if they don't
[1:07:19] really know him they're just anointed
[1:07:21] what it's actually satanic character
[1:07:24] right so it's not the character of God
[1:07:25] using it because the power of the spoken
[1:07:27] word won't be given to anyone that
[1:07:29] doesn't have the character of Christ
[1:07:31] because a fallen man ever had that power
[1:07:34] what kind of chaos would happen
[1:07:35] right of you know if Elijah you know or
[1:07:38] no I just won't go yeah but you see you
[1:07:41] see it's got to be more than just see it
[1:07:43] takes the character of Christ now
[1:07:46] I wish my phone was working I've I've
[1:07:47] made my notes all different this this
[1:07:49] day so it's all kind of
[1:07:51] we're going to come back to that now it
[1:07:53] says in Romans 11 and 29 for the gifts
[1:07:56] and calling of God are without
[1:07:57] repentance
[1:07:59] in other words the gifts and calling a
[1:08:02] God uh in a person without them even
[1:08:05] repenting first
[1:08:07] repentance has got nothing to do with
[1:08:08] gifts see someone can be their most
[1:08:11] incredibly gifted singer in all the
[1:08:13] world but if they haven't repented that
[1:08:14] gift will still be in them that's why a
[1:08:16] lot of people like Elvis Presley for
[1:08:18] example his his daughter just passed
[1:08:20] away the other day but Elvis Presley he
[1:08:22] learned his dance moves in the
[1:08:23] Pentecostal church and the Heart of the
[1:08:25] Pentecostal Revival he was actually a
[1:08:27] Pentecostal but he sold his gift to the
[1:08:30] devil but when when when he did that God
[1:08:33] didn't take that gift out of his life
[1:08:35] because it was part of him right so so
[1:08:37] the gifts and calling of God are without
[1:08:40] repentance see God will call you without
[1:08:41] you repenting first he calls you and
[1:08:43] then you repent right you see so so it's
[1:08:46] very fun to meet you've got to
[1:08:47] understand these very gifted people in
[1:08:49] the world
[1:08:50] right but but just because but their
[1:08:52] repentance or no um you know just
[1:08:54] because they haven't repented does not
[1:08:56] mean they're not gifted you're born with
[1:08:58] the gifts that are within you amen if
[1:09:00] you actually if you're actually gifted
[1:09:02] to preach you'll always have that gift
[1:09:05] but then but then instead of a Preacher
[1:09:07] they'll be a motivational speaker
[1:09:09] right but that because they give very
[1:09:11] very charismatic boss or leader
[1:09:13] politician
[1:09:15] gifted to speak but it's not repented
[1:09:18] right that gift has been placed in God's
[1:09:21] hands someone who who's incredibly
[1:09:23] gifted at music I use Elvis Presley for
[1:09:25] an example you know that gift is there
[1:09:27] that's why people can write incredible
[1:09:29] songs and make millions and millions of
[1:09:31] dollars billions of dollars why because
[1:09:33] of a gift
[1:09:34] right people that produce music all
[1:09:37] different kinds of gifts there what but
[1:09:38] that they are born
[1:09:40] with that
[1:09:42] but it's the gifts and calling of God
[1:09:44] are without repentance
[1:09:47] Yvonne following me right so people can
[1:09:49] be gifted they can have gifts of healing
[1:09:51] they can sing they can do all kinds of
[1:09:53] things but if there's no real repentance
[1:09:55] there the gift will still be there
[1:09:57] because the gift and calling a god are
[1:09:59] before
[1:10:01] repentance got nothing to do with
[1:10:02] repentance that's why there's great
[1:10:04] artists different gifts God places in
[1:10:06] the in the world
[1:10:09] he says and if it be done now listening
[1:10:11] accepting God's provided away see uh if
[1:10:13] it would be done out there they'd say
[1:10:15] the same thing they did when he
[1:10:16] performed it he's Beelzebub a fortune
[1:10:18] teller and anybody knows about a fortune
[1:10:20] teller knows that it's a crazy thing
[1:10:22] even to say they don't even know the
[1:10:24] first principle of telepathy or fortune
[1:10:26] telling that's a work of the devil
[1:10:27] trying to copy the work of God God chose
[1:10:29] a prophet the devil has a medium
[1:10:32] so even mediums that are getting contact
[1:10:34] with with with Spirits if that gift was
[1:10:37] surrendered to God God could speak
[1:10:39] through that gift but because it's not
[1:10:41] it's not given to God the devil speaks
[1:10:43] through that gift
[1:10:45] see why because it's a copy a medium is
[1:10:47] the devil's copy of a prophet
[1:10:50] right hey sure there's a lot of bogus
[1:10:52] mediums that just a cheap trick and just
[1:10:54] about there's genuine ones there's
[1:10:56] genuine ones
[1:10:57] right the two are pretty close together
[1:10:59] GC it'll be almost fully elected if
[1:11:01] possible is true we we got lots of
[1:11:04] impersonation he said as Janice and
[1:11:05] generous withstood Moses so will these
[1:11:07] men of cropped Minds reprobate
[1:11:09] concerning the faith so their Folly will
[1:11:10] be found out amen so you see people can
[1:11:13] see see the gift it depends whose hand
[1:11:16] the gift is in if the gift is
[1:11:18] surrendered completely to God if that
[1:11:20] person is surrendered completely God God
[1:11:22] can use it right but then but then at
[1:11:24] the same time a gift can actually
[1:11:26] contact God but that person is not
[1:11:28] repented
[1:11:29] they are true like Balaam the Holy Ghost
[1:11:31] fell upon him and he prophesied but he
[1:11:33] was a but but his his motive was money
[1:11:36] his motive wasn't serving God
[1:11:38] right so and and then and then we'll go
[1:11:40] into it even you know Judas Iscariot had
[1:11:42] a Supernatural Ministry and and he he
[1:11:45] lived in such a way that when Jesus was
[1:11:47] sitting around the last supper table and
[1:11:49] said one of you is going to betray me
[1:11:51] they didn't all say ah it's Judas
[1:11:52] they actually didn't know who it was
[1:11:55] so so he wasn't he didn't look like a
[1:11:57] scoundrel he looked like one of the he
[1:11:59] looked like a sincere believer but he
[1:12:01] did not and and and and he had a
[1:12:03] Supernatural Ministry he cast out Devils
[1:12:06] right healed the sick did all those
[1:12:07] things but yet
[1:12:09] that gift wasn't actually given to God
[1:12:11] because he didn't go to Pentecost
[1:12:14] see there's a whole big there's a whole
[1:12:17] big difference between a gift just being
[1:12:19] anointed and that person actually God
[1:12:21] dwelling in them and using it
[1:12:24] all right so now
[1:12:28] because of if someone is is completely
[1:12:31] threw into the Lord then it's the
[1:12:33] character of God comes out and and we'll
[1:12:35] come into that so you can be Sanctified
[1:12:36] without being justified and you can be
[1:12:38] justified without being Sanctified you
[1:12:41] can be Sanctified without receiving the
[1:12:42] Holy Ghost that's exactly the disciples
[1:12:44] in John 17 17 were Sanctified and given
[1:12:47] power to cast out Devils but still
[1:12:49] didn't have the Holy Ghost he sure had
[1:12:51] to go up to Pentecost and wait till the
[1:12:53] Holy Ghost come that's where Judah
[1:12:55] showed his colors see see how that
[1:12:57] Spirit worked its way through
[1:12:59] justification sanctification but when it
[1:13:01] come to the end he showed his colors see
[1:13:03] that's right so you see Judah see so
[1:13:06] John 17 17 is Jesus praying
[1:13:09] um Saint Lord sanctify them by Thy Word
[1:13:12] so they were Sanctified by the word they
[1:13:14] were justified by Believing on the Lord
[1:13:16] Jesus this was Judas so justified by
[1:13:18] faith Sanctified but yet they didn't go
[1:13:21] to Pentecost and yet the Holy Ghost was
[1:13:23] working in their lives
[1:13:25] amen you see see this is this is such a
[1:13:29] thing that can put Believers in a prison
[1:13:30] because they can say well these people
[1:13:32] out there have Supernatural and they do
[1:13:33] well we're not the only group in the
[1:13:35] world that has a supernatural this
[1:13:37] Pentecostal churches there's even
[1:13:39] Hinduism there's all kinds of different
[1:13:40] religions that have Supernatural things
[1:13:42] right but but now what really brings it
[1:13:45] down to the genuine or the not see
[1:13:47] because you can be anointed but not
[1:13:50] sealed in
[1:13:51] amen see and this is and and and and so
[1:13:55] so we can't just go by the supernatural
[1:13:57] of God we have to go by the word of God
[1:14:00] the character of God I'll go on to that
[1:14:01] soon see so there's a big difference now
[1:14:04] between someone who's just anointed and
[1:14:06] some who's actually been to Pentecost
[1:14:07] and anointed
[1:14:09] amen now
[1:14:12] see
[1:14:15] now Jesus is very interesting when he
[1:14:17] sees here now beware of false prophets
[1:14:19] which come to you in sheep's clothing
[1:14:21] but inwardly they are reveling
[1:14:22] reverending wolves who shall uh know
[1:14:25] them by ye shall know them by their
[1:14:27] fruits do men gather Grapes of thorns or
[1:14:29] figs or of thistles even so every good
[1:14:32] tree bringeth forth good fruit but a
[1:14:34] Crabtree Burger forth evil fruit a good
[1:14:36] tree cannot bring forth uh forth evil
[1:14:39] fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring
[1:14:40] forth good fruit every tree that
[1:14:42] bringeth not forth good fruit is shown
[1:14:45] down and cast Into the Fire wherefore by
[1:14:47] their fruits you shall know them so what
[1:14:50] is the fruit it's the life it's the
[1:14:52] character that's the fruit that we're
[1:14:54] looking for right God is looking for the
[1:14:56] fruit of the spirit of joy and love and
[1:14:59] peace long-suffering gentleness kindness
[1:15:01] all those things right but then so he
[1:15:03] goes from that now and he continues he
[1:15:05] says but not everyone that said that I
[1:15:07] mean Lord Lord shall enter into the
[1:15:08] kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the
[1:15:10] will of My Father which isn't which
[1:15:12] isn't heaven what's the will of the
[1:15:13] Father the word of God is the will of
[1:15:15] God men any will say to me in that day
[1:15:17] Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy
[1:15:18] name and thy name have cast out devils
[1:15:21] in thy name done many wonderful works
[1:15:23] and when and then will I Professor them
[1:15:25] I never knew you'd depart from me ye
[1:15:27] that work iniquity so he doesn't say no
[1:15:29] you never did these things
[1:15:31] he acknowledges actually you do these
[1:15:34] things you did these things in my name
[1:15:36] you cast out Devils you prophesied you
[1:15:37] did many wonderful Works many amazing
[1:15:40] testimonies your broadcaster was
[1:15:42] actually my spirit in your life that did
[1:15:44] it but they didn't know him
[1:15:46] so that was just anointed but they
[1:15:49] didn't actually have a true Pentecost
[1:15:50] where God came and dwelt and they missed
[1:15:52] the deception of this end time it's just
[1:15:54] people being anointed without being
[1:15:56] sealed into the Kingdom right but the
[1:15:58] reason Jesus says this there after
[1:16:01] because he's saying buy their fruits you
[1:16:03] shall know them he's saying now it's
[1:16:05] more than just Miracles that are the
[1:16:06] fruit the fruit is the character of
[1:16:09] Jesus Christ of the word amen so so this
[1:16:12] can be a prison because people can be so
[1:16:14] much so misunderstand the word saying
[1:16:16] well these people out here they dress
[1:16:17] any way they live any way they do
[1:16:19] anything they want but yet they have
[1:16:20] Miracles why do we have to be like this
[1:16:22] if they get what we want
[1:16:24] see because it's more than just
[1:16:26] Supernatural
[1:16:27] right it's actually the life of God on
[1:16:30] the inside now
[1:16:32] amen CeCe it's the see the difference
[1:16:35] between those see now now the big wait
[1:16:38] have I got a next one here
[1:16:41] now you see
[1:16:42] justification served its times that was
[1:16:44] the time of Luther remember God was
[1:16:46] restoring through the reformation and
[1:16:48] the restoration right so justification
[1:16:50] serves its time
[1:16:51] then and justification was under Luther
[1:16:53] then it had to become sanctification
[1:16:55] through Wesley and sanctification served
[1:16:57] its time till it become the baptism of
[1:16:59] the Holy Ghost and the baptism of the
[1:17:01] Holy Ghost served its time till the
[1:17:02] until the Holy Spirit which there is
[1:17:05] only one God Blends into the church and
[1:17:07] the church into Christ and it makes
[1:17:08] Jesus Christ reflected on the earth what
[1:17:11] he promised here in the Bible might not
[1:17:12] believe it I can't make you do that I'm
[1:17:14] only responsible for the word see that's
[1:17:16] right so I went from a time under Luther
[1:17:18] of justification we all know this right
[1:17:20] amen just shall live by faith but he
[1:17:22] brought a lot of Catholicism with him
[1:17:24] because God was restoring it wasn't a
[1:17:26] full restoration and then God moved on
[1:17:28] to sanctification they believed in
[1:17:30] justification but then they believed in
[1:17:32] living a holy life God Sanctified amen
[1:17:34] but then they brought a lot of
[1:17:36] Catholicism with them too because God
[1:17:38] but God was restoring more then there
[1:17:40] was a time of restoration of the gifts
[1:17:42] amen and people thought this is it we've
[1:17:44] finally arrived but that was just a
[1:17:46] restoration of the gifts there had to
[1:17:48] become a time when God was just more
[1:17:50] than anoint people but were coming and
[1:17:52] dwell in them because what happened
[1:17:53] under Pentecost a lot of carnal
[1:17:54] impersonations there was division there
[1:17:56] was fighting there was carnality all
[1:17:58] these things why because it was gorgeous
[1:18:00] anointing and I hate to say it was the
[1:18:02] same thing among our ranks as people
[1:18:04] just get anointed and what happens
[1:18:06] fussing fighting carnality Kingdom
[1:18:08] Building Division I'm the biggest
[1:18:10] preacher and this one's nothing and
[1:18:11] won't have nothing to do with this
[1:18:13] person all this stuff what's that the
[1:18:15] same is under Pentecost in terms of
[1:18:17] Azusa Street Pentecost but when but but
[1:18:20] that that served its time now God wants
[1:18:22] to dwell in his people amen where it's
[1:18:25] more than just anointing but God comes
[1:18:27] and dwells in US
[1:18:29] Hallelujah so now what is the difference
[1:18:31] now between just a anointing and God
[1:18:35] dwelling well first is that you the
[1:18:38] person that has a spirit of God and then
[1:18:40] we'll be able to receive the whole word
[1:18:41] of God
[1:18:43] right so you can look at someone who's
[1:18:45] having Miracles and you say we've got to
[1:18:47] be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:18:48] if they truly have the spirit of God
[1:18:50] they'll go amen
[1:18:51] and they'll receive that if they don't
[1:18:52] they'll throw it out right and then you
[1:18:55] know you've got to dress in a Holiness
[1:18:56] way if they've got the spirit of God
[1:18:58] they'll surrender to say amen and
[1:18:59] they'll they'll just walk right into it
[1:19:01] you know all the all the different parts
[1:19:02] of the scripture they'll be able to
[1:19:04] receive why because the spirit of God
[1:19:06] that wrote the Bible is in the in the
[1:19:08] believer
[1:19:09] and it identifies the person in the
[1:19:12] scripture
[1:19:13] with the scripture it's not just trying
[1:19:15] to agree with it see someone who's just
[1:19:16] anointed we'll try and agree with the
[1:19:18] word and I'll try and say yes I think
[1:19:20] that's mean I want to be that but if
[1:19:21] someone who really has the Holy Ghost
[1:19:22] something in them says that's me
[1:19:24] amen that something in them says I you
[1:19:27] know the scripture I can identify with
[1:19:30] that something in them says amen and
[1:19:32] then also you'll see the fruit of the
[1:19:34] spirit above all things right you'll see
[1:19:36] love and joy and peace patience
[1:19:39] long-suffering let's just wait I'll just
[1:19:41] read it because I'm just quoting it off
[1:19:42] the top of my head let's go to Galatians
[1:19:43] 5 and 22. see many people just say well
[1:19:46] it's receiving the word as a sign of the
[1:19:48] Holy Ghost but if you really receive the
[1:19:50] word there'll be an outworking right
[1:19:52] because a lot of people have received
[1:19:54] the word but the life has not been
[1:19:55] changed it's just an argument of fussing
[1:19:58] fighting and just that's it and that
[1:20:00] you're bullying from pulpits different
[1:20:01] things that's not receiving the word see
[1:20:04] if you really receive the word there's
[1:20:05] always an outworking of that
[1:20:08] amen so he says here and and Galatians 5
[1:20:11] and 22 but the fruit of the spirit
[1:20:12] Remember by their fruits you shall know
[1:20:14] them is love
[1:20:16] joy peace long-suffering gentleness
[1:20:20] goodness Faith meekness Temperance
[1:20:23] against such there is no law
[1:20:26] amen so you see now but you see these
[1:20:29] things in in in any life it just grows
[1:20:33] a sheep Bear's wool it doesn't have to
[1:20:35] force itself it doesn't put pressure on
[1:20:37] itself it just eats and grows wool an
[1:20:40] apple tree it just happens to grow
[1:20:41] apples it doesn't try and say okay you
[1:20:44] know they don't have a stand-up meeting
[1:20:45] every morning The Orchards okay boy
[1:20:47] we've got to grow some Bray Burns we're
[1:20:49] going to have some Braeburn apples no at
[1:20:51] the life of the Brae Boone apples in the
[1:20:52] tree it'll produce it it can't help it
[1:20:54] just like any Citrus it will produce if
[1:20:56] it's orange tree it'll produce oranges
[1:20:58] amen it will produce the life that's in
[1:21:01] the original part of the tree in the
[1:21:03] tree itself it's the same thing with you
[1:21:05] and I it's not us trying to be
[1:21:08] can we
[1:21:10] what happened you know you're not trying
[1:21:13] to have love you have love you're not
[1:21:15] trying to have joy you have joy you're
[1:21:17] not trying to have a piece of pasta all
[1:21:19] understanding you have it you're not
[1:21:20] trying to be long-suffering well I've
[1:21:22] got to be because the Bible says no you
[1:21:23] just are you're not trying to be gentle
[1:21:25] you just are
[1:21:27] I I mean not trying to have goodness or
[1:21:29] faith you know Temperance meekness it
[1:21:31] just lives out of you you can't help it
[1:21:33] why because the one that wrote this is
[1:21:35] in you manifesting it amen see that's a
[1:21:38] big difference between just being
[1:21:39] anointed if you've got a temper that
[1:21:40] that you can fight a bus or you've got
[1:21:42] to meet God there's something in you
[1:21:44] that's not right
[1:21:45] amen that you always fly off the handle
[1:21:47] you can't put up with any any kind of
[1:21:49] opposition trouble you just flare up no
[1:21:51] we should be making gentle quiet because
[1:21:54] God you say well I wasn't born that way
[1:21:55] none of us were born this way
[1:21:57] right some people might have a character
[1:22:00] that's close but they won't have the
[1:22:01] full thing because it needs a new birth
[1:22:03] to Manifest this I mean no one is born
[1:22:06] with this whole character it takes the
[1:22:08] Holy Ghost to give us a new birth Amen
[1:22:11] to give us a nature change which is the
[1:22:13] nature of God
[1:22:15] amen you'll find yourself automatically
[1:22:17] living out the word if you have him
[1:22:20] dwelling in you amen because it says in
[1:22:22] Ezekiel 36 and 27 I'll put my spirit
[1:22:25] within you and cause you to walk in my
[1:22:27] judgments and you shall keep my statutes
[1:22:29] and do them amen so it's actually his
[1:22:32] Spirit within us will cause us to walk
[1:22:34] in his word it's not us trying to do it
[1:22:36] remember Christianity is not you and I
[1:22:38] trying to be the Christian it's him in
[1:22:39] us being the Christian amen that's how
[1:22:42] we are real Christians when he is on the
[1:22:43] inside of us amen does everyone everyone
[1:22:45] with me so far amen it's so vitally
[1:22:48] important that we that we look into
[1:22:50] these things and we remember it's
[1:22:51] actually God it takes to have the
[1:22:54] character of God we must have his holy
[1:22:56] ghost
[1:22:57] amen
[1:22:59] so it's more than just being anointed
[1:23:01] but it's God dwelling in you by the true
[1:23:02] baptism of the Holy Ghost that gives you
[1:23:05] the character of God that is what you
[1:23:06] must have
[1:23:08] now where are we
[1:23:10] amen
[1:23:13] now but the thing is if you take out any
[1:23:15] part of this restoration
[1:23:17] it becomes satanic
[1:23:19] because the devil can jump in in that
[1:23:22] point
[1:23:23] and that's what's happened
[1:23:24] among our ranks
[1:23:26] is that people they they'll say
[1:23:28] absolutely we believe in justification
[1:23:30] never did it in the first place erupts
[1:23:32] praise God and in the mind of God
[1:23:34] inevited in the first place he saw your
[1:23:36] redeem shouting and we'll say amen and
[1:23:39] then we believe in sanctification to the
[1:23:41] nth degree remember sanctification is
[1:23:43] not you this is not a Methodist
[1:23:45] sanctification where it's a myth a human
[1:23:47] method to living a holy life no the
[1:23:49] blood of Jesus Christ sanctifies us
[1:23:51] right by one offering we are Sanctified
[1:23:54] perfected forever he's perfected forever
[1:23:56] them that are Sanctified right so he
[1:23:58] sanctifies our life you see something in
[1:24:00] your life that's that's not of God and
[1:24:03] it troubles you say Lord cleanse me of
[1:24:04] it because remember sanctification is
[1:24:06] not a one and done it's a constant
[1:24:08] sanctification of God taking things out
[1:24:10] of our life hallelujah amen so but
[1:24:13] you're gonna let him sanctify you and he
[1:24:16] does
[1:24:17] praise God but then uh so so people will
[1:24:20] cabbage down on those ideas and I say
[1:24:21] but the third pull is just the opening
[1:24:23] of the word in other words we just need
[1:24:25] to have the perfect understanding then
[1:24:27] that's all we need
[1:24:28] and what do they do they leave off the
[1:24:30] manifestation of the Holy Ghost
[1:24:33] remember you leave off any of this is
[1:24:34] when the devil can jump in and it
[1:24:36] becomes a satanic thing so so churches
[1:24:40] will stop the moving of the Holy Ghost
[1:24:42] they say it's too Pentecostal but if God
[1:24:45] restores he never takes away that which
[1:24:47] he has restored right we still believe
[1:24:49] in justification we don't throw it away
[1:24:51] because we've moved on justification
[1:24:53] comes with us we believe in
[1:24:54] sanctification right we don't throw it
[1:24:56] away just because we know we say we're
[1:24:58] up in the bright age we're the full
[1:24:59] restoration of the word is no all of
[1:25:01] that is part of you and I why because
[1:25:03] God is restoring he's taking us back to
[1:25:06] the original the original faith of the
[1:25:09] fathers you see so now now people in the
[1:25:11] message they may love justification
[1:25:13] sanctification but they'll throw away
[1:25:15] the gifts of the Spirit they'll and the
[1:25:17] anointing they'll say it's just two
[1:25:19] Pentecostal we don't need that I say we
[1:25:21] need it it's all part of him I want all
[1:25:23] of him
[1:25:24] amen so you know and the gifts are
[1:25:27] actually in the body to keep the body
[1:25:28] clean to keep sin out
[1:25:31] praise the Lord and people throw the
[1:25:32] anointing away saying we don't need
[1:25:34] moves of the Holy Ghost in our church we
[1:25:36] don't need cries of joy and crying and
[1:25:38] shouting and all that stuff we don't
[1:25:39] need that kind of because we've matured
[1:25:41] now I find it very interesting David was
[1:25:43] King he was adopted he was in his
[1:25:46] position of the king and he danced
[1:25:47] before the ark so here was an adopted
[1:25:49] son of God dancing
[1:25:51] he wasn't you know immature little
[1:25:53] Shepherd boy dancing around a tree no he
[1:25:56] was the king of Israel and and he was
[1:25:58] dancing before God but people say we
[1:26:00] don't need that kind of carry on here
[1:26:01] but yeah and then what happens is they
[1:26:04] throw away the moving of the Holy Ghost
[1:26:05] where God cannot move in a church and
[1:26:08] and and that means the atmosphere is not
[1:26:10] right to cause Eagles to hatch to be
[1:26:12] born Eamon because remember atmosphere
[1:26:14] is everything we must have the right
[1:26:16] kind of atmosphere that's why we must be
[1:26:18] very careful we don't we don't push the
[1:26:20] atmosphere away because remember our God
[1:26:22] is like a dove he don't put up with
[1:26:24] nothing
[1:26:25] you know if something offends him he
[1:26:27] flies away
[1:26:28] he doesn't clown he doesn't just you
[1:26:30] know so we're going to be very careful
[1:26:31] when we worship and praise God we don't
[1:26:33] knock the anointing out of this place
[1:26:34] but remember if you're fully surrendered
[1:26:36] to God you won't knock the anointing out
[1:26:38] so you know if you're fully surrendered
[1:26:40] to God and God dwells in you and he
[1:26:41] leads you to dance he's not going to be
[1:26:42] offended he's going to join you in the
[1:26:45] dance you begin to cry he's going to cry
[1:26:46] with you amen if you want to shout he's
[1:26:49] going to shout with you right because
[1:26:50] it's him doing it if it's him doing it
[1:26:52] it's never out of church order but you
[1:26:54] see we must never ever get to a point
[1:26:56] where we say we don't need those things
[1:26:57] well that was years ago when the church
[1:26:59] was young now the church is still young
[1:27:01] we're always going to be young
[1:27:03] right well it's going to be green and
[1:27:05] flexible Right Moving in the Wind of the
[1:27:07] Holy Ghost because remember The Greener
[1:27:08] of plant is the more light it can absorb
[1:27:10] and the more it can grow amen I don't
[1:27:13] believe I'm looking at a bunch of dead
[1:27:14] wood Hallelujah but we're green trees
[1:27:17] hallelujah amen we don't ever want to
[1:27:19] get too stayed in our ways that God
[1:27:21] can't move our hearts and touch Our
[1:27:22] Lives
[1:27:23] amen but you see people will throw away
[1:27:26] the moving of the Holy Ghost oh we don't
[1:27:28] need tongues that's just Pentecostal no
[1:27:30] it's part of the truth why throw away
[1:27:33] part of the truth like Luther Luther you
[1:27:35] know smoked a pipe drank beer believed
[1:27:38] in the Trinity didn't even baptize even
[1:27:40] nearly right hated the Jews does that
[1:27:42] mean we throw away justification no it's
[1:27:45] part of the truth so we take that
[1:27:46] remember truth was being restored
[1:27:47] there's a lot of humanity there that had
[1:27:49] to go away but the life was growing
[1:27:51] Weasley you know this you're this
[1:27:53] legalistic you know
[1:27:55] man-made method of of sanctification but
[1:27:58] sanctification is part of the word do we
[1:28:00] throw away everything that that was the
[1:28:02] humanity part of that move no we keep
[1:28:04] the truth that grows through the
[1:28:06] restoration of the gifts you know do we
[1:28:08] throw that away because of of what
[1:28:09] Pentecost does and did
[1:28:12] no it's part of the word it's a
[1:28:14] restaurant there's a lot of humanity
[1:28:15] there but now brother Ryan says now
[1:28:17] we've come to the end now where the
[1:28:18] where the seed has come back again the
[1:28:20] grain is here again right now now some
[1:28:23] people will say and this is another cage
[1:28:25] well it's just the grain there's not a
[1:28:27] big movement you know there's not a lot
[1:28:29] of movement now because now we're just
[1:28:30] laying in the presence of the sun like
[1:28:32] we're a bunch of you know just a bunch
[1:28:34] of seeds that just lay there on a table
[1:28:35] like this we're going to go back to the
[1:28:38] first green what did he do what did the
[1:28:41] first what did the original grain do it
[1:28:43] casts out Devils he praised he shouted
[1:28:45] amen he healed the sick he raised the
[1:28:47] dead he was led by Vision led by the
[1:28:50] Holy Ghost manifesting the word of God
[1:28:52] for his life that was the original and
[1:28:54] if that was the original then the end
[1:28:55] which is the same grain again will do
[1:28:57] the same Works amen the same life will
[1:29:00] be manifested it won't be a different
[1:29:01] one it won't just be some people trying
[1:29:03] to absorb teaching like this is some
[1:29:05] learning lecture hall God forbid it ever
[1:29:07] come just to that remember teaching can
[1:29:08] be anointed too every gift guide anoints
[1:29:11] it doesn't matter exactly how
[1:29:13] you know a preacher maybe I remember
[1:29:16] brother Johnny demoff in our first Camp
[1:29:17] he just stood there and taught man every
[1:29:20] word was like boom and I just wanted to
[1:29:22] scream and shout everything he said it
[1:29:24] was so powerful but yet it didn't look
[1:29:25] so Dynamic but it was the Holy Ghost
[1:29:27] working see so you can never judge the
[1:29:31] the effect of the meeting by how
[1:29:32] exuberant it is it's what is the word
[1:29:35] doing what is God doing to the heart
[1:29:37] right because sometimes you know surgery
[1:29:40] can be pretty look pretty rough
[1:29:41] sometimes it's a little Keyhole thing a
[1:29:44] little cut little hair you know it can
[1:29:45] be seen so well that wasn't such a big
[1:29:47] deal but actually it was a big deal
[1:29:49] right so we can't ever judge the
[1:29:51] powerfulness if that's a word of the
[1:29:54] meeting by how exuberant everything is
[1:29:56] that's when God comes and anoints the
[1:29:58] gifts see and anoints us and changes our
[1:30:01] hearts but you see if the original grain
[1:30:02] did those kind of things I'm expecting
[1:30:04] you and I to do those same kind of
[1:30:06] things that's what he did and we want to
[1:30:08] be like Jesus
[1:30:09] right we're not a bunch of theologians
[1:30:11] sitting around just discussing quotes
[1:30:12] and just arguing in different things and
[1:30:14] sword fighting no no no God wants to
[1:30:16] come and live in our lives
[1:30:18] Hallelujah but we never want to throw
[1:30:20] any of the word away otherwise what the
[1:30:22] character of God cannot live in US
[1:30:24] I mean we want to see Eagles hatch now
[1:30:26] we want to we need to go back here
[1:30:30] because I had this all different kind of
[1:30:32] ways now
[1:30:33] now why does he stand by he's talking
[1:30:35] about suffering the reason is in Romans
[1:30:37] 8 17 and 18. and if children then ears
[1:30:40] ears of God join ears with Christ if so
[1:30:43] be that we suffer with them that we may
[1:30:45] be also glorified together for I reckon
[1:30:47] that the sufferings of this present time
[1:30:49] are not worthy to be compared with the
[1:30:50] glory that shall be revealed in US
[1:30:52] unless we suffer with them we cannot
[1:30:54] reign with them you must suffer to Reign
[1:30:57] the reason of this is that character
[1:30:59] simply is never made without suffering
[1:31:01] character is a victory and not a gift a
[1:31:05] man without character can't Reign
[1:31:06] because power apart from character is
[1:31:08] satanic but Power with character is fit
[1:31:11] to rule so someone who does not have the
[1:31:13] character of Christ what is that that's
[1:31:15] power without character remember people
[1:31:18] can have a real good character that's
[1:31:19] very close to the character of God that
[1:31:22] can be me they can be gentle they can be
[1:31:23] loving long-suffering patient all those
[1:31:25] things but without the new birth it's
[1:31:27] just human ability
[1:31:29] they can just have that kind of
[1:31:31] temperance right but you see it takes a
[1:31:33] new birth to give us this kind of
[1:31:35] character we see so power without
[1:31:36] character is satanic why because the
[1:31:39] devil can get in there and work and
[1:31:41] that's why we need the character of
[1:31:42] Christ
[1:31:43] for the third pull to operate but if you
[1:31:46] have the Holy Ghost you have the
[1:31:48] character of Christ
[1:31:50] don't put it off in the future somewhere
[1:31:52] if you truly have the Holy Ghost you
[1:31:54] have the character of Christ
[1:31:56] amen hallelujah well then well then why
[1:31:59] do we go through why is it why is it you
[1:32:01] know you know we get character through
[1:32:03] suffering it's because
[1:32:05] in times of trial the real you comes out
[1:32:09] it's not in the good times it's in the
[1:32:11] hard times that's when pressure comes on
[1:32:14] like if you get a lemon you squeeze the
[1:32:17] lemon what's in the lemon comes out
[1:32:18] lemon juice the life and the lemon comes
[1:32:21] out anything you know it's like um but
[1:32:24] but the life's got to be in there to get
[1:32:25] it just like you know there's a saying
[1:32:27] you can't get blood from a tournament
[1:32:28] because there's no blood there you can
[1:32:29] squeeze a turnip all you want no blood's
[1:32:31] coming out
[1:32:32] right so the same thing with you and I
[1:32:34] pressure comes on to reveal what's
[1:32:36] within us
[1:32:37] amen so really if you really want to see
[1:32:40] what you're really made of be a bit
[1:32:42] sleep deprived have a little pressure
[1:32:45] and what's really within you will come
[1:32:47] out now
[1:32:49] praise God
[1:32:51] Hallelujah now the thing is
[1:32:54] if your Humanity comes out
[1:32:57] you've got to surrender that to God
[1:33:00] right because remember brother Brahm
[1:33:01] says when the Holy Ghost comes and it's
[1:33:03] like the size of a button
[1:33:04] and then it pushes out because why you
[1:33:07] begin to grow mature there's a character
[1:33:09] of Christ but it's got to grow
[1:33:10] right that's why you know the Apostle
[1:33:13] Paul would say in um Ephesians 4 we've
[1:33:15] got to grow into the fullness of the
[1:33:16] Statue of Christ where it talks about
[1:33:18] the um
[1:33:20] talks about the Perfection of the Saints
[1:33:22] it's not saying about a sinless
[1:33:23] Perfection because the blood makes us
[1:33:25] sinlessly perfect right but that
[1:33:27] Perfection means a maturity a completion
[1:33:29] we're going to grow we start as newborn
[1:33:32] babes Desiring the milk of the word then
[1:33:34] we're going to meet what because we grow
[1:33:36] it's like every every adult eats well
[1:33:39] probably not anymore actually but it
[1:33:40] used to be eat solid food right there
[1:33:43] goes a time when they go from milk they
[1:33:45] begin to eat solid food
[1:33:47] because they grow right there's a time
[1:33:49] when you have little babies I remember
[1:33:51] Lilia did this especially we're eating
[1:33:52] next to each other how how many months
[1:33:54] old and she looked at us like can I have
[1:33:55] some of that you know she had this look
[1:33:58] in her eyes what was happening she was
[1:33:59] growing to a stage where where the
[1:34:01] bottle wasn't satisfying her enough
[1:34:02] anymore she needed some solid food why
[1:34:04] because life was there amen it's the
[1:34:07] same thing with us as we begin to mature
[1:34:09] we want we go from the milk of the word
[1:34:11] to the meat why because we're growing
[1:34:12] but the thing is now as the Holy Ghost
[1:34:15] comes in like the size of button pushes
[1:34:16] out you've got to be willing when
[1:34:18] trouble comes in to surrender any right
[1:34:20] to be bitter
[1:34:22] to surrender the right to hold a
[1:34:24] misunderstanding because it's got to
[1:34:25] push out it's got to push those things
[1:34:27] you can't have both in you at the same
[1:34:28] time well you're going to be willing for
[1:34:30] it to take over the complexes in your
[1:34:32] life right we can never justify anything
[1:34:34] that keeps us in a prison why do you
[1:34:37] just why do you act that way around that
[1:34:39] person well a million years ago they did
[1:34:41] this to me they didn't shake my hand
[1:34:43] therefore I'm not talking to them oh I'm
[1:34:45] just not part of this group no that's a
[1:34:46] complex
[1:34:47] right that's a prison but God wants to
[1:34:50] lose us from those kind of Prisons amen
[1:34:52] that we can walk with him and be real
[1:34:54] Believers amen so now we're going to let
[1:34:57] him take those things out of our life so
[1:34:59] suffering happens because what's on the
[1:35:01] inside of us comes out
[1:35:03] so if the Holy Ghost is in you it will
[1:35:06] cause you to go to the Lord in prayer
[1:35:08] and will cause you to surrender more to
[1:35:10] him and be more sincere and be more
[1:35:12] yielded
[1:35:13] right so the more sincere and yielded
[1:35:15] you come to the more of him and less of
[1:35:16] you will come out who wants more of him
[1:35:18] to come out amen when you squeeze me
[1:35:20] just you know or squeeze us it's just
[1:35:22] the Holy Ghost comes out it's his
[1:35:24] character his nature how he would
[1:35:25] respond comes out that's the most
[1:35:27] important thing
[1:35:29] amen so so this is how we must be that's
[1:35:31] why Trouble Comes and suffering comes
[1:35:33] remember it's through Great Tribulation
[1:35:35] we enter into the kingdom of God
[1:35:37] this is not a Sunday school picnic this
[1:35:39] is a battlefield right you've signed up
[1:35:41] for a war I don't realize you've
[1:35:42] enlisted but you've enlisted right
[1:35:44] trouble really strikes when you start
[1:35:46] walking with God right because why
[1:35:48] because you must you must suffer Terrain
[1:35:53] there's a measure of suffering left for
[1:35:55] you and I it's through Great Tribulation
[1:35:57] right God is all-powerful but he allows
[1:35:59] us to go through things why that his
[1:36:01] character will come to the Forefront not
[1:36:03] our character but his character will
[1:36:04] come out Amen to the Holy Ghost will
[1:36:07] take over our lives more and more that's
[1:36:09] why when a trial comes to you say well
[1:36:11] that brother or sister did something to
[1:36:13] me it's not actually about that it's
[1:36:14] what's in you and your response right
[1:36:16] that's the thing that God wants to deal
[1:36:18] with I mean that's why Jesus would say
[1:36:20] you know when you go and try and take
[1:36:22] the moat out of your brothers I actually
[1:36:23] take the beam out of your own eye first
[1:36:25] because a complex or a prison will make
[1:36:27] you look a certain way at things I'm not
[1:36:29] looking anyone particular but you look
[1:36:31] through tinted glasses you're only about
[1:36:32] see-through bars only only some of the
[1:36:35] way you know but you see now that's why
[1:36:36] God allows things to happen it's like
[1:36:38] Lord examine my life take those things
[1:36:41] out of me Lord that's not my Humanity or
[1:36:43] not my complex or not my culture or
[1:36:46] whatever that's responding it's actually
[1:36:47] you responding out of me
[1:36:49] praise God and you're glad that we're
[1:36:51] his workmanship Hallelujah why because
[1:36:54] he wants us a character is a victory not
[1:36:57] a gift that means there's got to be a
[1:36:58] battle to get it right a victory is not
[1:37:01] given to you on a civil Planet saying
[1:37:02] here it is no there's a fight and what
[1:37:04] is that fight to deny yourself take up
[1:37:07] your cross and follow him resting
[1:37:09] because Christianity is a walk of
[1:37:10] self-denial right it's a walk of
[1:37:13] actually forfeiting all your rights to
[1:37:14] hold anything against anyone it's a
[1:37:16] victory because your flesh our flesh
[1:37:18] doesn't want to our flesh is used to
[1:37:20] holding grudges it's been the human
[1:37:22] spirit is very good at holding grudges
[1:37:25] it's been doing it since Adam
[1:37:27] right and it's been passed all the way
[1:37:28] down but there has to be a time when
[1:37:30] that cycle is broken right and this is
[1:37:33] because this is a season of restoration
[1:37:34] this is the hour where that cycle you
[1:37:37] may have family traits
[1:37:38] you know I know I know in English you
[1:37:40] know people's last names used to be
[1:37:42] their um occupation like Baker and Smith
[1:37:45] and whatever more you know but really if
[1:37:48] you know if our last names were honest
[1:37:50] it would be like anger or malice or
[1:37:52] stubbornness or Strife or argumentative
[1:37:54] or you know lust or drunkenness or
[1:37:58] revelry or whatever that would be a lot
[1:37:59] of our last names of our family line
[1:38:02] but there has to come a time when that
[1:38:03] name has changed right that that we're
[1:38:06] no longer living our last name out if
[1:38:08] it's those kind of things right now I'm
[1:38:10] not saying you're gonna go change your
[1:38:11] last name whatever your last name is
[1:38:12] praise God you know hallelujah it's
[1:38:15] interesting to know where you came from
[1:38:16] naturally but I'd rather know where I'm
[1:38:18] from spiritually right but you know but
[1:38:19] but what I'm saying is our natural
[1:38:21] lineage should not dictate to us how we
[1:38:24] treat one another how we walk in this
[1:38:26] world it may have been our forebeest
[1:38:28] problem but now there comes a time when
[1:38:30] it's done right and God wants to break
[1:38:32] all those things out of our life why
[1:38:33] that his character can come forth and
[1:38:36] that's why he allows suffering to come
[1:38:37] into our lives because he wants to put a
[1:38:39] finger on something and say hold on I
[1:38:41] want to get that out of you but the only
[1:38:43] way I can get it out of you is if you
[1:38:44] give it to me remember he's not a bully
[1:38:47] he doesn't mug us mug us of our
[1:38:49] bitterness and strife and unforgiveness
[1:38:51] and whatever he doesn't just beat us
[1:38:52] down and pull it out of us now he's a
[1:38:54] gentleman we have to say Lord get this
[1:38:56] out of my life he said was I've been
[1:38:58] praying about this for a long time he
[1:39:00] he'll take it from you
[1:39:02] Hallelujah don't just give up right keep
[1:39:04] pressing and say Lord make me more like
[1:39:06] thee
[1:39:07] Hallelujah
[1:39:09] praise the Lord amen sit down it's a
[1:39:12] character is a victory it's not a gift
[1:39:16] amen but Power
[1:39:18] with characters fit to rule
[1:39:21] and since he wants us to share even his
[1:39:23] throne on the same basis as that he
[1:39:25] overcame and sat down in his father's
[1:39:27] Throne so we have to overcome and sit
[1:39:29] with him and the little temporary
[1:39:31] sufferings we go through now is not
[1:39:33] worthy to be compared to the tremendous
[1:39:35] Glory that will be revealed in us when
[1:39:37] he comes oh what Treasures are laid up
[1:39:40] for those who are willing
[1:39:42] to enter into his kingdom through much
[1:39:45] tribulation see are you willing He's
[1:39:48] Able are you willing Hallelujah I'm
[1:39:51] willing Lord take me through whatever
[1:39:52] you need whatever you need to do oh I'm
[1:39:56] willing because you have my best
[1:39:58] interest in mind
[1:39:59] Hallelujah
[1:40:01] praise the Lord
[1:40:03] amen right we've got a
[1:40:08] Hallelujah
[1:40:11] amen that's what I put this up because I
[1:40:13] know people will watch us and say but
[1:40:14] it's receiving the word as the evidence
[1:40:16] of the Holy Ghost yeah but then look if
[1:40:18] people got the word then the works would
[1:40:19] follow that's the Bible I'm just reading
[1:40:22] the last phrase there but you see
[1:40:24] because it's more than just a mental
[1:40:25] receiver it's actually it's when the
[1:40:27] word is received the Holy Ghost comes in
[1:40:28] and then begins to live out
[1:40:31] praise the Lord
[1:40:32] amen but are you willing to
[1:40:36] we'll leave that for another day amen
[1:40:38] but I'm saying we'll go back to that
[1:40:40] sorry there's a bit of a segue but are
[1:40:42] you willing to let him
[1:40:44] take you through much tribulation I'm
[1:40:46] just going to leave it there I think
[1:40:47] it's a good place to stop but now now
[1:40:49] class
[1:40:50] remember
[1:40:52] if you have the Holy Ghost
[1:40:54] you have perfect love
[1:40:56] right if you have the Holy Ghost you
[1:40:59] have the character of Christ
[1:41:00] right if you have the Holy Ghost then
[1:41:03] you have the third pull in you right it
[1:41:05] won't be impersonated because it's more
[1:41:08] than just a gift it's got himself
[1:41:09] stepping and speaking the word of
[1:41:11] creation it's more than just a gift
[1:41:13] right and we need the character because
[1:41:16] if we don't have the character then we
[1:41:18] won't have that living in us right
[1:41:20] you're gonna have the character and the
[1:41:22] gifts together
[1:41:23] amen otherwise it's satanic because the
[1:41:25] devil can get in there and use an
[1:41:27] unrepentant gift for his own purposes
[1:41:31] all right so that's my conclusion but I
[1:41:34] trust I don't know if anyone's been
[1:41:36] going through this battle of well I need
[1:41:37] to get these things and you know but no
[1:41:39] if you truly have the Holy Ghost if his
[1:41:41] character is in you you can receive the
[1:41:43] whole word the spirit on you Bears
[1:41:46] witness with his that you're a Son of
[1:41:47] God you you cannot it identifies you in
[1:41:49] the scripture something in you says Amen
[1:41:51] to every word you see the fruit of the
[1:41:53] spirit I mean your Nature's being
[1:41:55] changed that the word lives
[1:41:56] automatically out of your life what's
[1:41:57] happened you've really met him
[1:41:59] more than just an anointing at a camp
[1:42:01] sometime which is praise the lord we
[1:42:03] love that we need it we need God to move
[1:42:05] and and and have an atmosphere every
[1:42:07] service Where Eagles can be born right
[1:42:10] Hearts can be mended we need that
[1:42:12] but it's more than just being anointed
[1:42:14] but God comes and dwells in you if you
[1:42:16] have that you're ready for the third
[1:42:18] poll
[1:42:19] right and it's here right it's been
[1:42:20] identified Among Us it's here right now
[1:42:23] don't put it off in the future that's
[1:42:25] here right now I don't need a storm
[1:42:26] spoken out of existence I don't need
[1:42:28] squirrels to be created I don't need
[1:42:30] those things but I need my family in
[1:42:33] I need it that Lord you can bypass this
[1:42:35] and speak to someone's life that they
[1:42:37] can actually meet him
[1:42:39] right Hallelujah amen so let's just have
[1:42:42] the musicians this morning we're just

[1:59:35] their hearts oh God lord it takes you to
[1:59:37] Open Eyes of understanding Lord if Lord
[1:59:40] of just a realization that I I'm not
