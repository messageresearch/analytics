[Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] worship oh let's just put our hands together for the lord hallelujah amen good morning friends amen i'm i pray that you're happy to be in his presence this morning amen there's no other place better than the presence of the almighty amen any in your workplace in school when you're out there things will come your way amen will feel sad we'll feel lonely you'll feel certain negative feelings amen but once we're in the presence of god amen the prophet said the devil is here as well amen but god is also here but we're not here to worship satan we're here to worship god and once we begin to worship him once you begin to raise your hands and you say father take over you'll find everything nothing will stop your blessing this morning amen the weather is not too good out there amen we know how that can affect us but let's just put that aside our troubles our sorrows our trials whatever it is our jobs our work whatever it is shove it to the side say not today not this morning let's listen to our holy hands and say thank you jesus thank you father for that victory amen join me to psalms 146. amen i love the psalms i mean just quickly there is none like you amen psalms 146 [Music] it says praise ye the lord praise the lord all my soul while i live will i praise the lord i will sing praises unto my god while i have any being and it says put not your trust in princes not in the son of man in whom there is no help because his breath goeth forth and he returned it to his earth and that very day his thoughts perish so our thoughts are not our own we can't even put our trust in ourselves or any other man and then verse 4 verse 5 says happy is he that had the god of jacob for his help amen i'm sure we all have a testimony this morning of when god supernaturally helped us in our own way that's what we're here to worship happy is he that had the god of jacob for his help whose hope is in the lord his god which made heaven and the earth the sea and all therein is which keepeth truth forever which executed judgment for the oppressed which gave it food to the hungry which the lord lucifered the prisoners verse 8 says the lord opened the eyes of the blind he raises them that are bowed down the lord loveth the righteous the lord preserveth the strangers he relieveth the fatherless the widow but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down and this last verse says the lord shall reign forever even thy god o zion o shekinah tabernacle unto all generations not just for ourselves our children our children's children amen praise ye the lord amen i believe that's what we should be doing this morning amen because he's great he's everlasting there is none like him when we need help he's the only one that we can turn to amen the help might not come today it may not come tomorrow but that promise is yours amen so with that mindset let's just release everything and enter into his presence and worship him with all our beings hallelujah let's buy his in the word of prayer [Music] dear lord and heavenly father we grant this a privilege to be in your presence this morning father there is none like you lord there is no other god no

what we are because we are reflecting the light of the sun you know and we are like the moon it shines seven times brighter than the sun that's his promise of who we are his bride and this song came to me a few years ago it was actually brother weber was one of the older brothers that had ministered a message and i just looked at the scriptures and things and that's how the song came about um but

people in all the world all the time amen oh good here we are yes we're going old school praise the lord for old school hey if you know something works it works amen amen i mean i've been pondering on one word for a good part of the week and that's reality i want to talk about reality today ii corinthians 4 and 15. can you turn me down please uh uh brothers thank you for all things uh for your sakes that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many rebound to the glory of god for which cause we faint not but though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day hallelujah for our light affliction is but for a moment take the worst thing you're going through right now class of this light affliction this is what the apostle paul tells us and it is but for a moment it's temporal it worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory while we look not at the things which are seen but are the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal hallelujah and we're going to read one more scripture i just sorry i'm never really good with slideshows because i jump around too much but it says in second corinthians 5 and 7 after the apostle paul has told us that we have a eternal body in the heavens waiting for us already he says for we walk by faith and not by sight i say the eternal things are real what you see with these five senses is not actually reality amen anyway let's bow our heads in a word of prayer this morning lord jesus lord truly we can sing from the depths of our heart worthy is the lamb hallelujah lord you do reign victorious lord jesus lord we want you to reign victorious over our over our lives lord that you'd have preeminence lord jesus lord that your word would have first place in our lives oh god and lord your word would be the principle theme of our walking our talking our actions lord everything we do lord may just be your word made flesh and dear god we thank you we can come on these four walls and worship and praise you o god and father we just want to invite you into the service lord i'm just asking may you touch every life dear god i pray you just remove every hindering spirit in the name of jesus christ father may you break every fetter of the enemy satan you're a defeated being and we've come to remind you once again you're still defeated as you were defeated that down calvary you're still defeated today and you will be defeated tomorrow and the next day and the next day but lord jesus we want to thank you lord you're still victorious lord you'll be victorious today you'll be victorious tomorrow lord as eternity rolls on your victory will still be resounding lord and father we want to lift you up and give you glory thank you for purchasing our salvation thank you for washing all our sins away thank you lord for making us new creatures and you oh god thank you for casting the devil out of our lives lord we're so thankful we can stand on his feet o god this morning i pray you bless the word inspire it lord i pray to hearts dear god not your speaker but hearer also lord may you grant it father in jesus christ's name amen amen amen god bless you friends you may have your seats this morning so i want to speak about reality and as i've said that reality is not what you see this is temporal what you feel is temporal what you imagine is temporal it's all going to pass away one day so we want to look at reality now the definition of of reality sorry ignore that we're going this way reality this is i think it's from the cambridge dictionary i just asked mr google this is what he told me the state of things as they are rather than as they are imagined to be now to the christian reality should be the word of god not what you see with your five senses right that is really reality and this is just an example he escaped from reality by going to the cinemas every afternoon i think that's getting a bit outdated some people will say what's a cinema you know i say he went on netflix every afternoon to escape reality or he went on his phone whatever you know but we shouldn't try and escape reality because our reality is good hallelujah we're going to heaven that's reality amen the devil's going to burn that's reality hallelujah so you know the things the state of things is as they are rather than as they imagined are imagined to be now you may say what i'm going through is very seems very very real it's temporal it'll pass it'll change there'll be another season there'll be another spring there'll be another good time harley just because you're in a bad time doesn't mean you'll stay in a bad time i mean we have to walk according to our reality which is the prophecy of the word for us and the scripture right what the message is prophesied the bride would be that's our reality hallelujah you know brother branham would would go into a hospital and he would pray for a a boy who was on the brink of death see it depends what you're looking to which will define your reality he said so so brother i'm said he raised up then the old father looked across at the mother and said oh mother isn't it wonderful it's done done you know as far as he was concerned he said oh i'm so happy said brother brown praise the lord i'm so glad that you prayed the prayer of faith my boy is healed now the little nurse had looked at him real funny and he said praise the lord and tears just rolled down his cheeks and the old mother they got each other in their arms began to hug each other and said oh lord we thank you for healing our boy this was their reality hallelujah remember they're boys on death's door so five senses are declaring one thing but their reality is declaring another thing hallelujah uh and just barely his heart was moving and so the little nurse said sir how can you act like that and your child dying why he said ma'am he's not dying he's living and he said why he said why lady said oh my i i don't understand she said well look sir she said this cardiogram whatever it what uh what uh ever what it i don't know but said when that drops all the way down it's never been known a medical history for the heart to ever come back again said the boy is dying a few more hours and he'll be dead said he's just practically he's unconscious now since yesterday how can you act and be rejoicing look like you wouldn't wouldn't take it so lightly why do you why do we act and rejoice why why are we so happy because we're looking at something very different than what the world looks at so what the five senses declare we're looking at faith we look at revelation of the word hallelujah amen oh my hallelujah see look much you see he said look my child the old man put his arm around that little uh other little nurse he said you're looking at that piece of machinery see because that's all you know to look to but i'm looking to a divine promise that's right the boys married now got a baby so that just shows depends on what you are looking at so you see you must look at god's promises no matter what takes place look at god's promise not how you feel but what god said that's the faith of abraham that's abraham's faith and we are the children of abraham i mean so we do not look at what we see what we feel what we hear we don't look at those things we are looking at a divine promise of god and i believe the holy spirit's here to train us and to teach us look at my word keep looking at me look what i said about you every situation don't care about politics the world economics forget it i mean that word we have a sure word of prophecy we're going in a rapture look to that look to every divine promise of god this is my reality how's your reality going because there is actually only one reality you know in psychology there's things called um alternative realities right but there's only one real reality which one are you living in it depends what you focus upon he says herein faith without works is dead lucky here friends let me give this illustration i might have done it before but what color is that shirt it's white anyone that's got sight knows that shirt's white you have five senses uh of the body see taste feel smell and hear now none of those senses will declare god that's quite a statement isn't it yeah i was thinking about that last night that's quite a statement we can see we can hear feel touch smell but none of those senses declare god but yet those five senses will run our life our emotions will run our life our imagination will run our life how we feel run our life i'm feeling up today hallelujah i'm feeling down oh my help me lord jesus but that doesn't change our salvation why do we you know we our reality should be the revelation of the word to us amen but none of those senses will declare god when god made man he made him in his image the spirit man and he put him in five senses to contact his earthly home not to contact god with those senses don't declare god they declare the earthly home where the man had to contact his earthly home he had to see taste feel smell and hear but faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen you do not see it taste it feel it smell it or hear it but you believe it we take judas garrett he saw a lot of miracles he saw the devil cast out he saw bread and fish multiplied he saw the storm be made he was in that storm and it became calm he saw a lot of things he heard a lot of preaching so he heard the word he saw the word he experienced the word but there was no revelation in his heart but the other disciples hallelujah they heard the word they saw the word but there was faith in them that declared it wasn't their five senses that declared who god was to them hallelujah it was their faith hallelujah glory i'm not going to slow i'm just going to keep bouncing i'm you know you know the best way to wake people up brother kaidre said i'm about to close everyone says hallelujah now they find suddenly awake it's faith that really declares who he is and we know faith is a revelation hallelujah our emotions see too many people rely on their five senses to get a sense of reality they'll take what they see what they hear what they feel what they taste and they come to a conclusion this is what's really going on and those things can appear very real i'm not discounting you know i'm not i'm not discounting any kind of situation but we will look at our five senses and we will come to a conclusion this is really what's going on he said oh i feel this way so it must be so i heard this thing and it must be so it must be really a reality and we know the devil takes 99 truth puts one percent error in and it becomes a lie you know so people hear a lot of things like theo and they say oh this is how it must be so but those things are just shifting sands how i feel today will come we'll go i feel good today tomorrow don't feel good i'm happy today i feel unhappy tomorrow i feel up today down tomorrow those things just keep shifting is it just me who's like that where's your angel wings put them down for a second children amen we're not we're not robots right we've hallelujah one day we feel rapture ready where's that devil i'm gonna chop his head off you know the next minute oh lord jesus help me how am i ever gonna get through another day but you get through another day hallelujah those things are shifting sands your imagination will change your reasoning all those things will change right but a wise man the foolish man builds his house upon the sand foolish people build their house upon their emotions what they imagine what they see what they reason that's foolishness because it will change but the wise man builds his house he digs through that sand through the feeling through what they imagine and they get down to the rock christ jesus the word and then they continue to spread out the foundation and they build their lives upon the revelation of the word hallelujah i want to be a wise man i don't want to be a foolish man i want to be a wise man hallelujah irrespective of how i feel what's going on forget it the word says it i believe it let's walk in it hallelujah glory amen amen you can have optical illusions and things that looks like it is when it's nazi but when the picture it could be psychology you say you see that there and you just keep saying yes i believe it and believe it so much till you actually think you see it but you don't see it that's right that's psychology but you if you just get so mentally pressed towards it until you just imagine it so imagine it till it so much till it becomes a reality see the devil will try and look make you look at a certain thing until becomes real to you you just imagine somebody hates you once and they don't hate you but you imagine they do and you just keep thinking they don't like me and the first thing you'll be shunning that person when they don't have done nothing wrong to you and after a while it becomes so a reality to you to actually believe that that person doesn't like you and you'll might ball them out or say something to you or say something to you for instance your wife or your husband or some neighbor or something like that when that person is absolutely innocent of any ill thing it's because you just imagine it so till it becomes a reality to you now do you see what i mean hallelujah we've all been there you can actually believe something to it so that really hap that's how they really feel and really if you ask them that no i don't feel that way at all shifting sands shifting sands keep digging dig through the shifting sands hallelujah amen we say i'm just following my heart the heart is deceitful above all all things desperately wicked who could know it i'm just following the world is following its heart where's that going i just need to follow my heart you know a foolish yeah i don't have it in here but you know the uh it says in proverbs just off the top of my head it says someone who you know a foolish person who doesn't like understanding says my heart will discover itself hallelujah my i just got to find out who i really am i've been there done that rejoicing in it hallelujah oh my heart's just got it you know no no forget that what's leading your heart what's leading your spirit that's a good question amen if it's the word of god you'll love god you'll love the brethren amen hallelujah you'll become more like him hallelujah before we walk by faith and not by sight now our side is very deceitful now brother caleb can you put that video up for me you gotta actually go out of my slideshow so oh wait i can do this wait can i do this let's see if i can do this oh yeah here we go okay now watch it now pause it pause real quick pause real quick now this man looks like he's gigantic right this is what my eyes are telling me this man looks way shorter than this man this is what my eyes are telling me who's seen this kind of thing before press play press play they're in the same room they just change position look and now how did they do that okay you can pause that let's just say it right there i actually go back to my slideshow because i've got pictures of it so my my scientist told me wait we're just gonna go i've got a few pictures of it i've got everyone's attention i'm very happy about that so my so that video told me this guy was gigantic there's a different one and he's tiny but if this was a video he would become the gigantic and this guy would become the tiny you can't you can't trust by what you can't trust by what these five senses declare here's another picture here's a fully grown man and these are children this is probably the biggest whatever eight-year-old in existence according to what i see but in reality he is taller than men you know they have things today called deep fakes who's heard of deep fakes they have videos where they take people's faces put it on other people's bodies actually change what they say to sound like that real person and say this is real oh but it's on youtube it must be real but you can't trust nothing you can't trust nothing you can't trust what you see you can't even trust what you hear hallelujah faith is the only thing we can revelation in the word is the only thing you can trust but that looks so real that looked real the guy's walking it's called a ames room emma's room it's not actually built square but your eyes tell you it's all plumb and square i'm not trusting what i see no more that's right hallelujah but you see the problem is if you focus on the wrong thing you'll believe the wrong thing brother brown would tell us of this this this young lady she's a young lady last night in an interview she said but she said a minister's daughter had some kind of a little love affair and she got and she had lost her mind about it she had gone a breakdown a very beautiful young woman about 23 years old and when she was a little girl of about 12 she was in chicago and sitting in the meeting or elgin it was and sitting in the meeting the holy spirit went out through the audience and called her who she was and said you've got a murmuring heart the doctor says you can't live to 15 years old but thus saith the lord you're healed and she never felt a heart trouble since and last night she had a different type of a heart trouble it was a spiritual heart trouble her lover had run off and married some other woman and yet she was still in love and this boy telling that he was in love yet with her and his father had caused it i said oh nonsense he didn't have to marry the other girl he did it because he failed to have the right kind of love for you that's exactly but see being all wound up into that the girl just sit there in such a stoop and like she said oh i know johnny loves me i know see that's all she could see she lived in that little world by herself she had formed herself in there so she had made her own reality the reality of actually the situation was this boy johnny didn't love her married another woman right but she had formed this reality because of pain and hurt oh i know he loves me and she had formed herself in this little tiny world and this was her reality but it wasn't reality are you following me we can form ourselves in our own little world let's not form ourselves our own little world let's be what the word says we should be by his spirit we will be that way hallelujah and i took hold of her hand i said listen to me and the lord showed me a vision you see that she knowed i know nothing about that something had taken place some transaction between them and when that was said then that snapped her right quick so she was stuck in this little world and the lord revealed something that snapped her out of it sometimes we need a shock holy spirit needs to give us a shot to get us out of our pity party feeling sorry for ourselves whatever it is i'll never overcome i'll never be a believer get a shock out of that holy we're more than able the holy ghost has made us more than able amen now now while you're out of there look to calvary there you're looking out here and you started trying to drink and a minister's daughter a pentecostal minister's daughter and doing the things that you're doing trying to drown that sorrow that man and that somebody that don't care the snap of their finger for you i said look to calvary girl that's the only way back that's reality look that's the only way back from wherever we have may have formed ourselves unto the only way back is to look to calvary hallelujah now hebrews 11 would tell us by faith abraham when he was called to go into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went by faith he so joined in the land of promise as an estranged country dwelling in tabernacles with isaac and jacob the ears with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which had foundations whose builder and maker is god now if we could go and just see abraham imagine if we could transport ourselves back into into abraham we could go back over many thousand years and we could go to where he was and we could see you know we could interview him abraham looked like any other man sure he was a wealthy man but he had the same kind of tent as everyone else he had the same kind of cattle the same kind of robes on same kind of bed maybe you know ate the same kind of food and we would maybe ask him you know we would we would maybe go talk to him and you know no doubt he would begin to tell us you know his life story and he's a man who's actually living by in a reality this man has reality because he met god hallelujah and you know no doubt you know he would he would begin to tell us about you know where he lives where he's from and then his story would go a little bit deeper and he'd say you know once upon a time we lived in the uh land of er you know my dad was you know an idol worshiper came out of babylon you know all those things tara babble and you know but one day a voice spoke to me i thought this is where i was from i thought this was where i was going to die this is where my children maybe if we'd ever have them would be and you know but but but a voice spoke to me a presence came around me hallelujah and it said leave this place i'll give you another land and then i begin to walk and and as i walk the same god will come and speak to me hallelujah my five senses declared a lot of things it declared my body was dead sarah's body couldn't have the child that was impossible were well past age but a faith came into my heart hallelujah faith came into my heart and declared to me you're going to have isaac oh you're going to have the promised son and you know there came a day where where that same one came to me and said your name is no longer abraham but it's called abraham you know if we could go back there imagine the first day abraham's just had the meeting with with god and said your name is now meaning the father of nations and then abraham goes down to the supermarket and his neighbors begin to greet him hey doing abram and he'd say he'd say no no my name is not abram anymore my name is abraham abraham what does that mean father of nations and they would begin to think in their mind he has lost his mind he's well past having children it's impossible hallelujah are you following me and he's telling us no i am the father of nations now the five senses would declare this man has lost his mind but he had not lost his mind he was living in reality because he was now walking according to the promise of the word for him hallelujah amen we would think oh boy he needs to get a grip with his reality and he had yeah that's right god had spoken to him he had followed that voice now the voice said your name is no longer abraham oh hallelujah aren't we the same kind of way god called us god spoke to us i'm going to take you to a new land holy i'm going to take you to a new place you know we're not going to be called church or denomination you're going to be called bride hallelujah you're gonna bring forth a promise son amen so god told him that he was having isaac he actually was now walking in reality right yes and he would begin to tell you now no no imagine this here he is before isaac came we had this interview this is what he just told us and then he would say you know all this land is actually mine but i'm just a pilgrim and a stranger what do you mean you have this land no no i'm just passing through why are you traveling to another where are you going abraham i'm going to a city what are you going to go to you know you're going to go down to i don't know name some big city in that day you're going to go to damascus you're going to go here no no no i'm going to a different kind of city who's the king of the city the king of glory is the king of this city hallelujah who made the city god the builder maker of the city is god and i'm walking to this city now you'd really think he's lost his mind he did but he found the mind of christ hallelujah amen so now his reality was based upon the revelation of the word to him you're following me oh boy we are the children of abraham by faith hallelujah so we should live and walk exactly the same way remember his five senses he felt old right he felt old if he ever had a mirror he'd see he's old he'd see sarah she looks old right hallelujah his five seasons declared to him he was old but he didn't walk according to those five senses that was not his reality but he really did feel old he really did see sarah was old and real you know you know what i mean she was actually old he was actually old but that was not what he walked according to and we are the children of abraham by faith okay can we can we can i drive hallelujah abraham was just an ordinary man maybe i'll just read the quotes instead of now abraham we find out oh here we are no this way now abraham we find out that didn't appear to be find them here about the 12th chapter the 11th chapter of genesis we find out his father came from babylon and abraham was just an ordinary man just as you know just as your eye or anyone else he was getting rather what we would think aged man he was 75 years old he had married his half-sister her name was sarah and his name then of course wasn't abraham was abram and hers was sarai and we find out that she was 10 years younger than he that made her 65 and he's 75 years old they probably he was a farmer lived in the valley of china there lived an ordinary life he probably went out in the daytime got his meat from the bush picked berries lived that sort of life just an ordinary man there was nothing special about him but one day god called him that's what made the difference when god made the call that's that's the way it is to any life it takes god it isn't what you do it's what god does see you say i sought god i sought god you're mistaken no man seeks god god seeks men hallelujah see it's not you seeking god it's god seeking you hardly it's when god makes the call it makes you makes a difference because he wants to take you out of these five senses amen and make you walk by faith alone hallelujah what was what was brother brown's theme song only believe all things are possible to only believe means you only take faith into consideration you don't bring faith in how you feel that's not only belief or faith in what you heard about someone that's not only belief hallelujah only believers only believe aliyah only take god at his word bring nothing into consideration but what he has said hallelujah that's all we need to do for the promise that he should be the heir of the world was not to abraham or to his seed through the law but through the righteousness of faith for if they which are of the law be heirs faith is made void and the promise made of none effect because the law worketh wrath for where no law is there is no transgression therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end of the promise might be sure to all the seed not to only which is of the law but to that also which is of the faith of abraham who is the father of us all as it is written i have made thee a father of many nations before he whom he believed even god who quickeneth the dead and calleth those things which are not as though they were oh i don't see it on its way it's on its way i don't see the promise coming it's coming oh it's on its way hallelujah hey the prodigal son the father of the prodigal son here david revelation my son's coming home do you see him coming have you heard from him no but he's coming how do you know rapture's coming it's coming it's been revealed hallelujah hallelujah amen who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be so he believed he against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken he just took what god said he's like this is very elementary no no he just took what god said yes hallelujah he didn't take his reasoning he didn't take anything else he said god told me that's it hallelujah and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead which was when about a hundred years old neither yet the deadness of sarah's womb he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to god now i just want to point out one thing if you read the biography of of of abraham's life there would appear to be a lot of staggering he would backslide and go into egypt he would backslide and go on to korea right and his children did the isaac did the same thing backslidden went out the land brother brown would say that that affected lot so much that that's why a lot ended up in sodom amen right and you know he would he would he would actually god would come down and tell him you're going to be the father of nations you're going to have the promised son and he would roll in the dust and at the feet of god and laugh at god remember it wasn't just sarah that laughed abraham laughed too no but but then you take those mistakes but the thing is because he believed the promise those things weren't attributed to him because the promise was revealed to him his faith overrode his his staggering and also because he was under the blood of bulls and goats now hallelujah was just covered sin but then when the blood of jesus christ came and now the same god that inspired moses to write the commentary of abraham's life was the same god that inspired paul to write this about about abraham but now you say well shouldn't they be saying the same thing no because paul was inspired he was looking through the blood because that blood was attributed to abraham hallelujah so now when god was looking at abraham now all of his staggering was actually taken out of the way and his faith came to the forefront and god could actually write about him he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief yes sir here we are we have our staggering sometimes we think house is ever going to come to pass does that just mean how's this ever gonna you know but god's determined he will get us into a condition to believe sarah had to get into a condition that she would believe the promise judge and faithful who had promised hallelujah amen abraham's reality was not based on his five senses but they were based on what god told him and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was also able to perform and therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness now it was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed to him but but for us also to whom it shall be imputed if we believe on him who that raised up jesus our lord from the dead who was delivered for our offenses and was raised again for our justification i just want to hammer this reality he said why is he going into other things you can take this through the whole scripture then what about us moses had to walk in reality his reality wasn't pharaoh's palace by faith moses when he had come of years refused to be called the son of pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of god than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season esteeming the reproach of christ greater riches than the treasures in egypt for he had respect and to recompense of the reward by faith he forsook egypt not fearing the wrath of the king for he endured as seeing him who was invisible how did he endure he was looking to the unseen right he was looking to an eternal god that gave the promise hallelujah and we must be the same kind of people amen because he was pointing to you and i hallelujah now in the exodus not everyone saw him who was invisible there's a lot of people who know what let's just go here first moses before god called him he would try and deliver the people and he killed one egyptian that was the success of his meeting and he ran in terror that was the success of his own human ability trying to fulfill the word of god in his own life and he and he fled to the land of midian and it says here in in verse 21 and moses was content to dwell with the man and he gave moses zipporah his daughter so here moses was he was ordained to be a deliverer he was ordained to take a people out of egypt but because of his own human failure he fled and he was content to dwell as a shepherd i think brother freddie brought this up at camp you know he was content to dwell as a shepherd in a strange land then actually fulfill what god had him to fulfill now this word content it's from you know so from the hebrew dictionary it's it means through the idea of mental weakness properly to yield that is to to to take upon to be content but through the idea of a mental weakness he was willing to live as a shepherd admitting that was not meant to be his reality his reality was to take the people out of egypt and put them in the promised land that was his ordained position in the scripture remember just because he went and made this little world to himself on the backside of the desert amen doesn't mean god would change his mind about moses hallelujah but because of situations and pressure he ran right and he was content that's right through basically because of a mental weakness to yield to just live on the back side of the desert how many times do i need to say i'm about to close how many times do we live a substandard christian walk because of our own disappointments if we're living below our privilege that's not our reality but we can adopt it's amazing how adaptable humans are we can people can live in any kind of condition you go to the eskimos up the far north go to the tropics you go the far south you know wherever people can adapt to all different kinds of siberia you know whoever's seen them you know they had to put fires under the engines of their trucks to actually thaw them out to turn them on when it gets real cold they adapt why would you live there while they adapted to live there we can adapt to live very below our privilege but why should we adapt to that that's not our god-given reality our god-given reality is to be an overcomer in this age and now we know many times we're going to be willing to overcome this guy it's this guy this actually gets in our way this guy trips us up we give the devil too much credit are you gonna be willing to actually whip this guy oh it's going beyond my comfort zone you've got to go beyond your comfort zone i feel uncomfortable in this situation sometimes you just got to press through to grow you've got to go beyond your comfort zone i don't feel like doing it well you're going to l is it oh that's shifting sands moses had to go out of his comfort zone god called him that's right hallelujah abide in your calling now as i was saying before we went that way not everyone that came out of uh egypt was looking to the unseen for some when they had heard did provoke howbeit not all that came out of egypt by moses but with whom was he grieved 40 years was it not with them that had sinned now we know sin is unbelief whose carcasses fell in the wilderness and to whom swear he that they should not enter into his rest but to them that believe not so we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief you know god actually did not or did not want them to die in the wilderness right it was actually their choice to die in the wilderness amen you know god gives us a choice god gives us a choice he's a gentleman what choice you gonna take brother brown made a choice to take the heart away the narrow way he says that was your choosing he had to make a choice what about you and i hebrews 4 and 1. let us therefore so i'm just continuing on from the what you know what we just read let us therefore fear least a promise being left of us to entering into his rest any of you should come seem to come short of it for unto us was for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them but the word priest should not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it now the rest we know is the holy ghost that's the rest where to enter in who's entered into rest hallelujah right so but but these ones that came out with with moses were walking by their five senses they weren't walking by revelation now we know there's the caleb and joshua outfit and i found that quote and i like it so i'm going to put it up hallelujah maybe brother that's why i'll talk about the caleb and joshua outfit and so so these ones were rejoicing when god opened the red sea and did lots of things but then when hardship came they were actually now because remember the word that called them out was the word that tried them right the same thing that called them out was actually to try them to see if their faith was genuine the scripture says in a different translation is that the genuineness of our faith would be tried and the same message that called us out is actually trying us as we walk with god to prove actually is your faith genuine is it a revelation that god has called you or is it now you're just in this thing because while everyone else is doing it and the people are nice and the food is good and you know all those kind of things that's not genuine faith genuine faith is when faith is tried it comes forth god is manifested when the trial happens come forth as gold right come forth as deity not not as this way and the whole congregation of the children of israel murmured against moses and aaron in the wilderness and the children of israel said unto them would to god we had died by the hand of the lord in the land of egypt now let's just think about this they were slaves their sons were taken from them and thrown into the nile they cried out for deliverance we've all read this in the scripture right this is where they came from they were beaten by task masters they were just used that they weren't even counted as people pharaoh would have esteemed his horses greater than the children of israel right they were nothing to him they were used and abused and killed and whatever more didn't matter what him to them pharaoh didn't care and now they have god has seen a prophet down when they could not deliver themselves god delivered them when we could not deliver ourselves god delivered us they called upon the lord the lord would say to moses in exodus 3 i've heard the cries of my people so i have come down to deliver them hallelujah said god delivered them with a mighty hand took them through a red sea did incredible things that had never been done since the war began but then they came to a place where they actually were hungering that they actually desired i wish i was still a slave in egypt that's insanity they were living in a wrong kind of reality when we sat by the flesh pots and when we did eat bread to the full they were being led by their bellies and they were not satisfied with what do you know how incredible it would be i was thinking about this last night you were you're in the caleb and joshua outfit you've been eating manna for 40 years you're about to go into the land which is incredible in itself but you're about to go into a land where people will never taste manna like you did you know except for the high priest once a year in the holy of holies right but you know you'd have a testimony i lived on angel's food because don't we wonder i wonder what it tastes like you know i wonder what how heavy it was and you know how it died you know we wonder those things don't we and they would have a testimony we lived on angel's food god fed us god looked after us you know that'd be incredible thing but these people were getting they just sick of it they're just being unhappy about it and when we did eat bread to the fall for ye have brought us into forth into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger now that's what they had in their mind they had got it twisted in their mind actually we're just on a death march they're on a life march they're on a master promised land they're on to a march to a land where a resurrection was going to take place that was where they are marching to that's why joseph said when when you are god will take you out when you do take my bones don't bury me in egypt oh sure there were great tombs in egypt there were great pyramids that could have been built and put as put as you know a lot of things about egypt that yo joseph in those things but joseph knew there was no resurrection in egypt even goshen was an incredible place well-watered you know place and everything there was no resurrection there he said take my bones bury me in the promised land because he knew a resurrection was coming out of that place hallelujah they were marching to a place of resurrection but yet they said no we're on to death much they're on a match to life hallelujah where are we going we're marching to zion beautiful beautiful zion we're marching to zion the beautiful city of god hallelujah but caleb and joshua they were actually walking in reality at work he said we're more than able to take the land let's go get it right now right now hallelujah not tomorrow let's go now hallelujah we're more than able god's given us the land they weren't murmuring they were excited why because they are not walking by their five senses or what they imagined or how they felt or anything they were walking by faith hallelujah they actually had the real reality hallelujah why because it was revealed to them aren't you glad when god reveals his word becomes a living reality every promise becomes alive hallelujah amen israel had not yet received the promise but they were on their journey and without raising please do not please do understand that's where you are the nazarenes in the pilgrim holiness and so forth fell because israel when they came to the spot of kadesh barnea when the spies went over and said the land is great but some of them came back and said we can't take it i say they were standing in one of those rooms because their perception was we can't take it these ones are giants we're grasshoppers in their sight and i doubt very much they went to them with a questionnaire said can you answer these questions you want to take a survey are we what are we in your site a giants b average size or grasshoppers they didn't ask them that but that was their perception because they were going by their five senses and not by faith but when caleb and joshua went in the land they said i want this i want this this mountain i want that hallelujah they put their order in i want this place hallelujah why because they are walking by faith hallelujah amen so you know we don't want to we want to walk by the eyes of the word glory when the spies went over and said the land is great but some of them came back and said we can't take it because the cities are walled up and they were and so forth but caleb and joshua stood out and said we are more than able to take it because of their hallelujah caleb sorry i can't quite it's getting a bit small amen more because of the already signed up document statements they believed in two works of grace justification sanctification and could not move any farther and listen that whole generation perished in the wilderness but two that went over into the promised land and brought back the evidence that it was a goodly land and we were more than able to take it because it was god's promise our walk in reality now just say this he's talking about the nazarene pilgrim holiness they just came up to the second two works of grace and stopped a lot of message people can do the same thing they can come up to a place and they can intellectually say yes the words open all these things but when brother bram he would speak of quickening power so much more after the book came open than before he said there's no quickening power has been released upon the church hallelujah but then people actually sit back and say no no that's not for me hey listen i don't care what pentecostalism has done to the gifts i don't care i don't care what the bogus has done i'm just looking at the genuine i don't care what they've done that's irrelevant to me i'm not walking based on what others have done or have not done i'm walking according to this word who cares one of the you know one of my favorite scriptures in the bible says if we compare ourselves among ourselves we're unwise so we are foolish if we compare ourselves with ourselves the apostle paul said it so we become foolish if we compare ourselves if you compare yourself with another brother or sister you're foolish if you compare this church with another church you're foolish why where to compare ourselves with this word that's the only thing we're to compare ourselves with jesus christ the word that's all that matters they can do what they do right i'm not here to compare hallelujah i'm not interested in comparing with other people we're to compare ourselves with this word this is our measuring stick amen so let's walk according to this word amen hallelujah amen so let's not stop you say well the pentecostals went off on the gifts who cares they're still in the word dancing in the spirits in the word brother brown criticized it until he saw it happen he started doing it too he got under the anointing why do we sit back why don't we just let god be god hallelujah if you're there just crying quietly that's fine if you want to shout shout out be you in the scripture be you and the lord amen we're more than able to take it because it was god's promise they had reality then instead of people going on receiving the holy ghost speaking with things receiving the power of god the baptism of the holy ghost signs wonders miracles they felt that it would break down their tradition of doctrine and what happened to it perished in the land that's right we don't want to perish we're not stopping we're not stopping okay sure jordan was maybe a nice place to stop but i'm not stopping sure jericho looked quite nice but i'm not stopping i mean surely the garland heights is nice i'm not stopping jerusalem i'm not stopping i'm getting the whole thing every part of the scripture's mind that every promise that pertains to the bride you know what we need to do we need to take our marriage certificate and look at everything that's allotted to us instead of looking at everything else we should look at this what does it promise me joy peace to be long suffering gentleness meekness faith love divine love charity brotherly love overcoming power so this is my this is actually my identity this is who i am this is who we should be hallelujah gifts of the spirit manifesting god living in his church oh god make us a powerhouse this is what our this is what our pressure be god i want to be a bubbling stream i want you to bubble out of me and bubble out of me and bubble i mean just come and live whatever you want to do lord manifest your word and my life hallelujah that's how we should be lord live why that you'll get any credit i don't want no credit it's god you know what a testimony is you are testifying of what god did not what you did that's a real testimony hallelujah hallelujah now amen but the believers the caleb and joshua outfit i thought that'd be a cool church name we'll just leave that there where do you fellowship the caleb with joshua outfit well we'll definitely get a good a good a good website name because no one else we called it the charities you know commission we can register that no no anyway that was going on to the promise they moved on over into the land and took the land and settled down in the land as a possession and we must never stop at justification and uh sanctification let's go to the baptism of the holy spirit let's not stop at believing on the lord jesus being baptized let's not stop because he cleaned us up from a life of sin but now pressed on into a position to a promise of the baptism of the holy ghost for peter said on day of pentecost for the promises unto you and to your children to them that's far off even as many as the lord our god shall call this is an adoption by the way we should keep pressing till the body's changed how do i know i've arrived when this thing changes so until then let's press the battle amen let's take every promise let's defeat every devil that comes our way i mean let's put him under our feet let's recognize who we are i mean let's take this word and chop through every dart unbelief all formal spirits pity party whatever it may be pride let's chop through it and take every promise of god we're ordained to do the job hallelujah hallelujah you know jesus spent three and a half years trying to get his disciples into reality you're not fisherman you're not a tax collector you're not the woman at the well you're not mary magdalene who had seven devils this is not your reality your reality is that you will be the people that i'm gonna pour myself into and manifest my glory you're part of a multi-member body he spent a lot of time getting these people into this reality hallelujah and their eyes come open and they saw this is the reality we're to live by hallelujah we're going to do where are we here we are now but we who believe the word now better know and it's his living presence for us on this day we've separated from dead works and the holy ghost comes in to confirm the word and make it so hebrews 38 proves that to us proves that god has raised him up for us according to his promised word thousands of years have passed 2000 years almost has passed but what is it the token still holds that's the holy ghost by the way that god raised him up on the third day if you've just got the word that's all you got but when the token is applied then christ is reality to you just like he was to abraham just like he was to moses just like he was to joshua to caleb just like he was to the believers all the way down he's a reality hallelujah and he does today like he did then and so it throws it right back into their lap again they can't get around it god promised it and here it is but the token has got to be applied he says you take the token and you accept his sacrifice blood then he gives us life the life of the token it's a promised seal ephesians 4 30. grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby you're sealed into the day of your redemption then being baptized into him first corinthians 12 we become part of his body and in him as the fullness in him is all the sufficient the sufficiency that we have need of everything i have need of is in him everything everything everything not him in a little bit of something else everything he is my sufficiency he is my pleasure he is my life he is my joy amen i don't have to puff on a cigarette to get some kind of relief i don't have to go on youtube to get some kind of relief i can take the lily of the valley he is the opium here's the thing that makes me walk in the clouds he is my all-sufficient he's all my hopes he's my rest he's my god he's my savior he's my healer he has all that i need of because i die we we die and be baptized in him and he is all sufficiency when you when you get to that spot in your walk when you get to that spot that your sufficiency doesn't depend on immortal it depends on him hallelujah amen isn't it wonderful when he becomes your everything you can just walk with him and doesn't matter what goes on in life hallelujah because he becomes your reality hallelujah oh hallelujah church now the living god here and on tape so he's talking to us do you know where you stand are you aware of this do you know that you were called of god has god called you supernaturally called you maybe if you're a preacher maybe he's through a tape may just be an audible voice but he called you to the word he didn't call you to a church he called you to the word hallelujah and every the holy ghost reigns in your heart hallelujah and every word of god is real to you that's your reality hallelujah congregation says amen oh brother how is satan going to stand against that how is he going to stand together the people that have reality not an alternative reality not trying to escape reality they're walking in reality hallelujah how's it going to stop that from growing how's he going to stop it amen hello how is he going to stop you from growing how is he going to keep them signs from following why you can throw them in jail they if you could i don't care what you do they they done tried it go through church history they tried everything they invented all kind of contraptions all kind of ways all kind of psychology it didn't stop the seed of god manifesting for their age hallelujah that's right amen they rotted in jails they were fed to lions they were sword asunder thou jerk to pieces you can't kill it right a church has predestinated those he foreknew like he did jesus what stopped him nothing nothing stopped him religion didn't stop him culture didn't stop him unbelief didn't stop him devils didn't stop him hell didn't stop him death and couldn't stop him roman soldiers couldn't stop him the seal of the high priest couldn't stop him the tomb couldn't stop him nothing could stop him because he was predestinated able to manifest the victory to take our sins away nothing could stop him he was called those he called he is justified those he has justified he has already glorified pre-destinated hallelujah well what's your reality you know our reality is actually based on the atmosphere we live in brother brown would be hunting one day and he would come until there's a bit of a storm there's a blow down and he looked and this eagle came out and was kind of flexing its wings and at the same time a little chipmunk came out and started barking at him and brother brown realized he's not barking at him he's barking at that eagle and now that eagle looked at him and brother had his gun that eagle wasn't afraid he knew what he had he knew what he was hallelujah and that eagle looked at that chipmunk and just got sick of the chatter chatter chatter chatter because remember the eagle isn't ordained to live on the ground he's ordained to live in the heavenlies that's his reality is up in the heavenlies others he just got sick of all the chatter chatter you know we get sick of stuff eh sick of what the devil does sick of his nonsense you know forget the chatter chatter chatter of the doubt and all that's really happening and no no no who cares about all that stuff spread your wings to the winds of faith soar up into your god-given reality hallelujah hallelujah hey we are built an eagle is built to fly a chipmunk is built to bark i'm an eagle what are you built to be now brother brown tells a story uh i don't have it up there we can you know anyway brother man tells a story of a of an orphan girl and i'm just going to close on this because some people will say well the conditions they live in actually are greater than their joy in the lord by their actions they may not say it with their mouth but by their actions this is what they do and so brother brown would tell a story of an orphan girl who went to go live on a ranch that was owned by the amna company hallelujah and she lived with i think her uncle and her and her cousins three three girls and she was actually there not to live like her cousins did but as a basically a slave and she would have to do the dishes she'd have to clean up she would have to you know do the washing do all kinds of stuff and her cousins didn't treat her nice her uncle didn't treat her nice she was destitute and stuck on this ranch and maybe this is what you thought this is my lot in life i'm just going to live here i'm going to die here this is it but then there was a man who came to the ranch and he was looking for a wife hallelujah you'll know where i'm going just enjoy it amen he was looking for her he was looking for a wife and and and and her cousins thought we're gonna one of us is gonna marry this this man because he's he's the son of the company owner he's very rich and so they would dress up they would tart themselves up and have big parties and stuff and try and grab him and you know all that kind of stuff but he wasn't looking for just what the five senses declared he was looking for character he was looking for the other part of himself and he got sick of their shin good yo yo shindigs and carry on and he went out one night and she was there tipping out the bath water or whatever it was and now he came into her presence and she got scared and he began to say to her you know i've come out looking for a wife and i've been noticing you our lord the eye of our lord is upon us hallelujah and and and he said i've been looking i'm looking for character i'm not interested in all this carry on i'm looking for something real hallelujah and he promised her i he said i believe you meet the qualifications will you marry me maybe got down on the knee and did all you know and and he said in a year's time i'm going to come back and get you i'm going to go prepare a house in chicago wherever it is i'm going to get our house ready it's going to take me a year but in a year's time i'm going to come get you hallelujah and then he kissed her on the cheek whatever more gave the promise now you imagine being that girl your reality is i have to live here i'm basically a slave to my cousins they treat me bad i eat bad food i have not no nice nice clothes i don't get paid much this i'm just stuck in this but then this man comes to you who everyone's trying to get and he gets you and he promises you in a year i'm coming back imagine the next morning the dishes weren't so hard same dishes same dishes the dishes weren't so hard the washing same washing the washing wasn't so hot she had a spring in her step he's coming back for me he's coming back for me hallelujah the cousins weren't changed they treated her exactly the same way but it didn't it seemed like water off a duck's back because her reality was changed because she was being taken from this place she was going to another land going to another country hallelujah i mean so so everything they said to her didn't seem to affect her so much she had a spring in her step hallelujah the same she was living in the same place living doing the same chores living with the same people but she had a victory because she's leaving hallelujah same hardships but now there was a spring in her step because he was coming back for her and then they came the last day there's always the last time for everything there's the last time there's a last time hallelujah but she was living in reality she did the dishes last time she scrubbed the floor last time she heard them chatter chatter chatter last time she put on the wedding dress hallelujah because it was her reality he's coming back he's coming back to take me away oh and she would stand on the porch last time and she would hear their criticism last time did it take her joy did it take her peace did it no it didn't because her reality was he's promised he's coming back to get me he's going to get me hello and in a year's time when she's standing there you know this word fits us just right we have the wedding government on hallelujah there's something when you came well it's just me some this message tore strips off my back but it fit me just right it just seemed to something just seemed to echo in my soul this is what i've been looking for this is the god that i don't know i was looking for but but he found me and she put on the dress and it just fitted just right hollywood put on the word it just fit us just right hallelujah and then she steps to that porch for the last time and then then she hears the turning of the wheels of the stage carriage that comes down and he opens the door and says honey i said i was coming back here i am let's get out of this place hallelujah and she left for the last time hallelujah living in the same house doing the same chores the same opposition the same problems maybe she she you know hurt herself but it was different this time because he she's living in a different reality hallelujah how about you and i friends what reality are you living in are you living by what your five senses declare are you walking are you living by revelation of the word what revelation what you know what what reality are you in i want to ask that that's what i just want to ask you but what i'm going through is so real it's temporal it's temporal it'll pass the troubles i have in my home they'll pass these things at my job it'll all pass but what are you walking by we are the children of abraham amen hallelujah and if abraham walked that way we can walk that way too he was he was following a voice and that voice brought him to a place until it changed his body hallelujah hallelujah what's this going to do to us it's going to change our bodies the reality is this is the reality you know people say you've got to face the reality of the situation well the reality of the situation is there's going to be a people and there is now on the earth that are going to be changed there are people that are going to walk with god and be not because god takes them that's the reality of the situation it's not what's going on it'll help
