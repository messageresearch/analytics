[Music] amen good morning everyone how's everyone today happy anniversary praise the lord hallelujah [Applause] amen amen well it's it's great to have each and every one of you here it's like to say thank you so much for coming and and bringing a lick of fire to celebrate with us um i just want to read a scripture we're going to read psalms 100 you can keep your seats if you wish he says make a joyful noise unto the lord all ye lands serve the lord with gladness come before his presence with singing know ye that the lord he is god it is he that hath made us and not we ourselves we are his people and the sheep of his pasture i trust that will be that's that's the theme of our fellowship here it's not man's doing or human ability it's god it's been the lord the whole time enter into his gates with thanksgiving and into his courts with praise be thankful unto him and bless his name for the lord is good his mercy is everlasting and his truth endureth to all generations amen praise the lord i pray that you know brother brown would make some comments i used to think that a juniper tree was a bad thing to be under it's actually a very good thing to be under and uh he would speak here this and what heroes are elijah says elijah rubbing his eyes raising up a little frail shaking hands took a hold of the bread and eat it and then the great angelic choir came out formed a little panoramic around him like that and began to sing the songs like no mother could coo her baby to sleep let him sleep again then father turned around said you know i love him so much the journey's great he has had a lot to go through with yet i'm not through with him i must feed him again so he called the angels and dumped in another big bundle of vitamins and cooked up another corn cake and sent him a cruise of water and stroked his brow and fed him again he says i'm so glad that there's a juniper tree when we all get war and tore up we can go under that juniper tree and find spiritual vitamins to travel any kind of a trip we've been through a journey all of us this last 10 years has been a phenomenal time but i pray that whatever you know we may feel wore out stress troubled whatever it is but i pray that this would be a juniper tree time where we leave this with strength for the to continue on in the journey that the lord will send his greatest angels rub your brow you know refresh you serve you the best angelic food of god's word and he says this here that um this is another uh what here if they are elijah again he says and he was wore out his nerves were all on edge and just like the people today we needed juniper tree i preached to tired people nervous people pray for nervous people and it's a nervous neurotic upset world right now that we're living in if he said that in 1959 how much more in 2022 uh everybody's just on the edge so as to say or to speak it's like it's like just any little thing so upsets them god's people is that way so he's not just speaking of the world he speaks god's people's that way too it doesn't mean we don't have the victory doesn't mean we don't have eternal life but we know we're built to the same material that the world is as well i mean the world is that way we all need a juniper tree a place to rest he says i trust that this convention will be a juniper tree and i pray that this time here will be a juniper tree for all of us we'll walk out of this place refresh renew reinvigorated in the holy ghost amen and you know what i what i appreciate sure you know the so so the brothers who are ministering got brother ferdi this morning we have brother taswell tonight and brother freddie this sunday morning then brother alpha sunday afternoon and you know some people think well it's like a political thing two churches basically together but it's not that way i trust we've gone beyond carnal ideas of man but the reason i ask them to preach is because they've been very important and key parts of our growth as a church and so i felt that was very important but what i love about ministers is they don't know what you're going through but god knows all about you and you know brother abraham said in christ is mystery god revealed he says he said the pregnant person with the seed of god the word and they're manifesting itself so surrendered to the will of god that the word and the word alone manifests itself in that person the prisoner to an individual and he says that he says a person could be so yielded to god that god the word has prominence in that man and the and then there's the discerning of the thoughts and tense of the hearts manifest through that person so god can speak to our address today he can come right down your life maybe go past through the past 10 years of your life and speak to every situation god can do that and i and i pray we're under expectation i want to i want to touch from god i i have a need i i want more of him and this is why i've come to these meetings that the lord would speak to my life and touch me amen you know what i love about this weekend it seems to be uh it's nice how god does things you know this weekend is 50 days after easter so it's pentecost it just happened that god arranged it this day i believe so we celebrate easter but it's that quickening power that came on the day of pentecost the abstract title deed came down struck off all of the claims the devil had on the people and this message takes us back to a true not a denominational but a true pentecost so i pray this will be a pentecost weekend we're going to refill us with a fire of the holy ghost the word will put on flesh like never before this message will live in a people that's what i'm looking for so i'm believing that's going to happen to us amen so god bless you we love you thank you so much brother malcolm so good to have you and sister theresa here i mean thank you so much for coming down appreciate you and then god bless you amen where's where's our brother moses where's brother moses there he's god bless you sister league god bless you great to have you too amen but let's um let's stand shall we let's put our heads in a word of prayer i'm yeah love you all

brother ed are the deacons we'll be at the back please come and see us and we'll assist you the toilets are to my left straight down the hall this venue is set up a little bit different in the changing times it's um the toilets are a shared facility so men and female use it it's all individuals but please respect the next person that's going to go in behind you the ladies might have take a little longer to to get themselves ready before they come back so many if you're in that in that area where the the ladies are please give them some respect give them some space so many of you all get in there in and out as quick as possible so ladies are comfortable um yeah it's unfortunate that this venue is set up differently but our other venues on the other side they do have separate uh toilet facilities for the male and female so it's only when we are here at the church church hall it's it's different the outside foyer area it's a bit loud when we're outside so please be aware there's people praying inside there's people fellowshipping inside that if we are congregating in the foyer area to keep it down or to take it away from the doors so it'll be comfortable for everyone that's inside here mothers and babies there's a mother's room at the back as you come through the main door straight through and there's a live stream set up there for you guys so you won't be missing out anything lunch this afternoon is at 1 15 quarter past 1 at the dining hall that's a cross but by the time we finish off here we'll be leaving here about 2 30 lunch will be cold so we won't go there we'll just stay for three o'clock service because we came expecting all right uh yeah so at 1 15 we will we will usher you through to the dining hall um you can fellowship around the place afterwards uh just bear in mind the children that are here it is a open parking space outside so the kids please try not to run behind the cars or in the parking areas stay close to where we can see you and if there's any assistance that the children need please feel free to come call us and we'll help you out if there's anything that needs to be done while we're here please point it out to us we cannot see everything so if there's something that's uncomfortable there's something that's not right if the toilet paper is short in the toilet let me know i will sort it out that's what we are here for so i would like to thank all of you once again for turning up this morning and making this special occasion even more special with all of you here so welcome feel free and god bless you all amen [Applause] praise the lord it's wonderful to see all of you this morning and we are going to be in for a fantastic time of fellowship in christ for this weekend this is going to be the best weekend you've ever had in your life that's what it's going to be and the lord is going to pour out his spirit upon us in a powerful way the ministry is going to be anointed as it's going to be speaking as if it was the oracles of god speaking to us we didn't come here just to not get something we came here to receive from christ and if we're under expectation then we will receive the lord's got so much for us yes he has so much that he wants to give us he wants to give it to us more than what we want to receive it that's that's that's not just saying that for a line to say here that's actually the way that it is he's so desperate to pour out his spirit upon us and to fellowship with us if he went through all the effort all the effort that he made to to reveal who he was and to come and die on the cross and all that he he didn't do that just so that at the end it could be a just average he did that so that he could fellowship back with us and he did that so we could be here and meet him the whole plan of salvation is for this moment right here this is it so we are going to have such a good time in the lord and and i we really do sincerely appreciate everyone here that's that's um you're all fellow laborers in the gospel you know from different fellowships we all we all labor in our different areas and serve the lord in our different ways in different places so there are local people here which this is our like our uh our um vineyard area that we're looking after and you're you've all got your different areas but we're all fellow laborers in the gospel and you support us we support you and on this occasion you are coming here and supporting us and and what we are doing and showing your appreciation for us and we're so grateful for that and the song service for this weekend is going to be a little bit different because what we are going to do is um as a as a church band different ones we've actually written quite a few songs over the years that shekinah has [Music] written you know different folk would get inspired to write this song and that one and they they have come out over the years and they've been a little um markers on our journey that maybe in this time the church was going through this and then this song came out then that's next time this song came out here and there so we thought it would be just because this is like our anniversary we're like you know what let's just do our songs is that all right some of them you will know and some of them you won't but i think you'll be blessed and i before we do each one i don't want to talk between each song but i just want to say a bit about each um you know if we're going to do a segment of songs i just want to explain a bit about what what these songs were who wrote them and what they mean to us um because i think when you know the story to it it just gives it a bit more impact um so the way we're only going to do four per service because we've got some fantastic specials throughout in the service too just letting you know we've got the doves medley first then we've got the eagles then we have got sister amy and sister kim after that so those are the three specials this morning um but the the two praise songs that we've got the first song we're going to do is a song called lead me to the rock who wants to be led to the rock amen and this song was actually written by brother andy stand up brother andy [Music] [Applause] we were actually at the notes for christmas i think and brother andy went up and through the bush area that brother matu has there that he you've got to be careful when you walk up there because he he he walks his dogs out there every morning and they kind of do what they do every morning so you go there to have some quiet time when you're kind of [Music] stepping in places you regret but um andy brother andy went up there and he said the lord just gave him these words and it was lead me to the rock that is higher than i lead me to the lord most high and he he pinned out basically the whole song up in the bush here and he had it he had a bit of a tune roughly so so he came into the lounge here and he said oh isaac i've got this all these words and i've got this little tune maybe it goes like this and so we sat down there on the couch and and within about maybe 45 minutes i suppose the song was in existence lead me to the rock it all just kind of came together so that was the first one and then the next one we're going to do after that is a song called go tell john and this is a song um you know when when john was in prison he got a bit despondent he said uh he said go he says his disciples go on ask jesus is it you or should we look for another maybe it was under his juniper tree you know is it you do look for another and jesus just said go tell john that the lame walk the blind sea the death here the those that are in prison are free he said the interpretation is it's happening it's it's see the interpretation of the word of god is that it comes to pass so it's like you don't have to worry anymore john it's actually the evidence is that it's happening that's how you know it's true because it's unfolding of itself you don't need to worry about it and and the song is based around that one that was one of my ones um so let's um stand this morning and we're gonna sing sing a few songs amen side with the chorus two three four lead me to the rock that is [Music] lead me to the rock that is [Music] that is [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] when i'm walking with my god there is no problem here no darkness in life no pain or despair nothing holds me back he is more than alive to me so lead me to the lord most [Applause] [Music] [Applause] lead me to the rock that is [Music] his invitation to come and walk with jesus every time in every nation nothing holds me back he's revealed himself to me so lead me to the lord [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] lead me to the rock that [Music] is glory be to jesus we can come a little higher we rise above the mind of man and the devil views a liar growing every day to our father we can say lead me to the lord lord [Music] [Applause] lead hallelujah to the rock that is [Music] lead me to the rock that is [Music] [Applause] that is [Music] lead me to the rock that is [Music] lead me to the lord lead me amen oh go tell john that the lane they walk go tell john that the blind [Music] the captives they have all been granted liberty go tell john when my prophet speaks believe it receive it in your heart you don't have to understand it it stands all alone and i'll interpret it by bringing it we'll go [Music] [Music] that the dead are raised the captives they have all been granted liberty tell tell john when my prophets speak believe it receive it in your heart you don't have to understand it it stands all alone and i'll interpret it by bringing it to pass is it you it you or do we look for another i can hear john say his eagle eyes are getting clouded over

have all been granted liberty go tell john when my practice speaks believe it receive it in your heart you don't have to understand it it stands all alone and i'll interpret it by bringing it apart is

gathered here together i don't know about you but it really does feel like a big family reunion [Applause] and um also i don't know about you but it feels like the past couple of months we've just gone through so much and it's just like life just throws everything at you but you know what in the middle of everything going on there is jesus and i'm so grateful for that that he is the unchanging never-ending unfailing god that we serve and uh um i better stop talking um i trust you'll be blessed by this song amen it had been three days his parents couldn't find him but the scribes and the pharisees they were all gathered around him as a boy in the temple speaking with such wisdom they were all amazed at what he said and in the middle of it there was jesus the one crying in the wilderness joined the baptizer he spoke of one who was to come baptizing with fire when john baptized him the heavens were opened and caught descended like a duck [Music] there was jesus [Music] [Music] to bring life to his daughter he spoke with authority straight from the father no one could explain away his powers and in the middle of it all there was jesus and on a hill just outside of town a man hung there bleeding dying for the souls of men to captives bring freedom but three days later his tomb was empty he conquered death and the grave and in the middle of it all there was jesus so no matter what you're facing no matter where you've been in hot times or in good times keep your eyes on him and in the heat of the battle all the present mountain streams he'll be right there in the middle that's where he's always been so be strong and take courage cause when you think you're gonna fall cause right there [Music] jesus there's jesus there is jesus [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] praise god for a friend like jesus he's the best friend you'll ever have oh thank you he said he'll never leave you nor forsake you and he keeps his promises it doesn't matter what you're going through he's always there the shepherd is always there sometimes you can't see it but he's always there and he loves you and he cares for you with all of his heart there is no intention inside of him that wants your destruction whatsoever all he desires is your good that's all he wants for mankind if we just receive it he's got so much to pour out upon us amen let's just um we'll stand this morning the um we'll just sing a few worship songs um so the two that we're going to sing this morning the first one the first song is a song called you chose me and um this one i got the verse for the song a few years back and it was one of those ones that were just sitting in the back of my mind and then one time i was sitting in the my office and i just started playing the song and then it came to the pre-chorus but and i i remember being in there tears streaming down my face when i i was just singing the words and you bore my sin on your shoulders when you could have had it all you chose me to be the one that you would die for the one that you would save it was a i enjoyed the writing experience of this one because it meant something to me you know when you think about what the lord did for me and the other one we're going to do after this is a song called not today and this song it was a unique song um it's the only time i think that it's happened like this but um it was a church service and we had a normal service and brother ben was ministering i shouldn't say normal services or powerful service actually a very powerful service and um throughout the service the song was just coming in the back of my mind as the service was progressing i felt bad because i'd have to i'd be writing down things during the service but um i wouldn't usually do this but i just felt like you know i'm going to go out there and say let's just sing the song that i've just had coming during the service i didn't even know how the chords went or anything i was just assuming it would be like maybe c then f then d thinking in my mind but we we got up and we did it after the service and it was a very powerful time um maybe went off half an hour or 45 minutes i've just um so so this was one of those different ones the verses i wrote later but the chorus just came like this you know and then by the end of the service we're singing it so um yeah we hope i trust these to be a blessing to you we'll just sing these two and then have brother ben up amen uh [Music] nails got hands and thorny bands were in not for your love for me unfailing love that shows calvary [Music] then such condemned desires [Music] [Music] it took my place he took my place [Music] [Music] you chose me to be the one that you would die for the one that you would save the one that you would carry [Music] the one that you would care for the one that you would raise the one that you [Music] oh you chose [Music] your body [Music] my [Music] then such [Applause] [Music] and [Music] it's [Applause] [Music] [Music] when you could have had [Music] you chose me to be the one that you would die for the one that you would save the one that you would carry from the cradle to the grave the one that you would care for the one that you would raise the one that you would see through every storm in every way you chose me [Music] you chose you chose me oh yeah you chose me you chose me he chose me he chose me he chose me you chose me you chose me [Music] [Music] he came to us jesus [Music] son of god redeeming love you paid the price my sacrifice your condition and you gave me life so i say fear you tried

over our soul years at a man blessed be the lord who has not given shakkai in a tabernacle as a prey to their teeth tabernacle is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers listen the snare is

devil i want to hopefully i'm online am i being live streamed but good i want to rebuke that devil that says you from africa so you got emotion out that's a devil from hell because if that is true then only africans are in revelation 5. [Music] [Applause] then john is from africa [Applause] then the rest of you are in trouble [Applause] for what i know my brother brandon said john is a type of the bride and there's a quote where brother branham said if john in preview of the book being opened if john in preview shouted the way he shouted he says what's gonna happen if it opens in reality form and i say this morning the book is open the book is open the book is open and i want to tell you this morning i saw my name [Applause] so forgive me if i misbehave forgive me if i carry on in a manner that's not pleasing to your

you i don't know where i'm going hey man just call me let's go revelation 5. because i feel i hate that devil that devil that says the minute you open your mouth to worship that devil says you pentecostal devil called me to revelation 5 i'm just following the lord amen amen but i also want to say we're not pentecost that gets emotional the word the word brings the worship the word oh my god

and unto the lamb forever and ever and ever and ever and ever [Applause] [Music] [Applause] there's just something about my worship because i'm john so i'm talking about me myself and i hey man and you know when god changed me hey man it's telling that someone was saying the other day hey man i i i was born an introvert i was born shy i know you're shocked until i met god and i tell you people

such a look [Music] [Applause] now bishop brother martin now i know it's hard to trust south africans because we don't have a good reputation i know it's hard i know it's not easy to trust when people come into your country and it looks like they're trying to take over we just want a better life that's why we're here we just want a better life that's all we just tried to get away from the violence in south africa and so we came to new zealand and we met a bunch of awesome people [Applause] i remember we came to new zealand in 2000 do you know who welcomed us brother stu's father that's why brother stewart and i we maybe we don't talk as much as we should but he's got a special place in my heart who did i just say that brother stewart take care of the tape take out of the tape man you know why because his dad welcomed jenny and us me and the girls he didn't ask any questions who are you where do you come from south africa no no no no no he just looked at us liked what he saw must have been my smile i think i'd hear my head back then i was 20 years younger i looked okay but i still was 20 years younger he looked okay life has been rough on us now but his dad just said welcome family and it was over didn't look at us suspiciously didn't question us didn't challenge us no just accept it and so we're here and all we're saying is we just want to serve the lord i i we don't we don't have a hidden agenda we're not trying to take over south new zealand and become prime minister of your country we're not doing that and neither are we funny and strange and this is just who we are we just want to be believers we just want to fellowship and it's so nice for you to be for us to be together obviously through the years then i met brother malcolm and i met everybody and we've

to do it's all i want to do my brother i just want to make a rapture i just want to help you i just want to oh my time is so far spent with our time oh my i just want to help the young people because i know what it's like to serve the lord as a young person and struggle i know what it's like to be a 12 year old get baptized and you struggle i know what it's like as a parent to have an attitude i know better i know best and i sit in church with the attitude i know i know and you can see the attitudes around new zealand but what happened when god changed me and that's what i want to introduce you to if you meet jesus [Music] [Applause] you look at the nationalities of the people right you look at you look at when they do the hakka brother malcolm you look at the hakka right you look at amen when they sing the south african national anthem oh my and they sing the king god of nations and you know that and you see the emotion and you see the enthusiasm and you see the joy and you and you see when uh i can't even think of any rugby players when they score a try and oh my when they when they the thing with the bat and the ball the cricket you see the crowd's enthusiasm and then the
