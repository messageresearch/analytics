[39:22] amen we believe for it
[39:25] hallelujah
[39:27] i may not have the story exactly right
[39:28] but there was a soviet spy or kgb agent
[39:32] and he defected in the cold war he
[39:34] jumped off a fishing boat far away from
[39:36] the coast of america and he somehow made
[39:38] it and they when he got ashore he got
[39:40] captured they didn't believe his story
[39:42] they put it in but then he said but god
[39:44] help me get here and they put that into
[39:46] their equations i said no it's possible
[39:48] so without god it was impossible to make
[39:49] the swim but with god it was possible so
[39:51] i'm so glad we could just inject god
[39:53] into our situation and everything
[39:54] becomes possible

[44:42] for your glory in jesus christ's name we
[44:44] ask amen
[44:46] amen god bless your friends you may uh
[44:48] have your seats this morning i'd like to
[44:50] take a subject and it probably i don't
[44:52] know if i'll stay on the subject but
[44:53] we'll just see how it goes but i want to
[44:55] talk about having faith in the
[44:56] scriptures that pertain to you i mean
[44:59] we're here to fulfill scripture we're
[45:00] not here just to occupy time we're not
[45:02] here just to go through a religious
[45:04] motion but we're here to fulfill
[45:06] scripture now what we just read there in
[45:08] psalm 16 we read uh just just the last
[45:11] portion of that uh uh and particularly
[45:14] he says that you know he says my heart
[45:17] is glad my glory rejoices my flesh also
[45:19] rest in hope for thou will not leave my
[45:22] soul in hell neither shall thou suffer
[45:23] the holy one to see corruption now when
[45:26] jesus you know to me the greatest
[45:28] miracle our lord ever did was not
[45:30] raising lazarus which was amazing or or
[45:33] calming the storm or feeding the
[45:35] thousands or casting out the devil
[45:36] delivering legion those things are
[45:38] incredible miracles but to me the
[45:40] greatest miracle he ever did was to
[45:42] subject his own flesh to the will of god
[45:45] where he could take these these these
[45:47] elements because you think about our
[45:48] lord he had the same conscious same
[45:51] affection same reasoning memory same
[45:53] same spirit realm same you know five
[45:56] senses of the physical realm he had all
[45:58] those same things
[46:00] as we do amen but but you know he was
[46:03] able
[46:04] by by by a full surrender to subject his
[46:07] own body
[46:09] to the word that he was sent to fulfill
[46:12] now you think about the word he has seen
[46:13] to fulfill he was he was the lamb of god
[46:16] he had to give his life as a willing
[46:17] sacrifice he had to bear the sins of the
[46:20] world upon his shoulder and you know he
[46:22] you know he wasn't what we would call
[46:24] the things he had to fulfill wasn't the
[46:26] glamorous things there was no glamour
[46:28] you know when we saw him the bible said
[46:30] there'd be no beauty of him that we
[46:31] desire him so you know there's no
[46:33] glamour you could say really with his
[46:35] great death burial but his resurrection
[46:37] was glorious amen but you know but he
[46:39] knew what he had to fulfill and he went
[46:42] to and so remember he he learned
[46:44] obedience by the things he suffered you
[46:46] know he you know god actually you know
[46:48] if i can put it this way he received
[46:50] revelation he knew who he was right he
[46:53] wasn't born in sin so so he you know he
[46:56] didn't he wasn't born with what we call
[46:58] spiritual amnesia he knew who he was as
[47:00] he would be a 12 year old boy sitting
[47:02] there talking with the scribes and
[47:04] pharisees in the temple and you know
[47:06] mary and joseph had have left them in
[47:08] jerusalem left them in jerusalem came
[47:10] running back and you know they're all
[47:12] upset and you know mary mary actually
[47:14] spoke against their own testimony saying
[47:16] your father i've sought thee with tears
[47:18] but jesus said don't you know i must be
[47:20] about my father's business what was he
[47:22] doing sitting in the temple discussing
[47:23] the word he is about his father's
[47:25] business his father's business wasn't
[47:27] carpentry his father's business was amen
[47:29] his true father amen god himself so
[47:33] you'd say he he he received revelation
[47:35] he had to it was revealed to him what he
[47:37] had to do as he as he would say in john
[47:40] 5 he'd say verily verily i say unto you
[47:42] the son can do nothing of himself but he
[47:45] saith the father do and these also do it
[47:47] the son likewise so he was led by vision
[47:51] right he was led by vision just like the
[47:53] prophet was led by a vision so so so he
[47:55] saw the vision and then he went and
[47:57] fulfilled the vision that's why he could
[47:59] go through the pool of bethesda bypass
[48:01] all those other sick people maybe they
[48:02] had more needs than the man that he
[48:04] actually healed but he was led by a
[48:06] vision to that one man
[48:08] right so so he was led by vision so when
[48:10] he was going to go up calvary he saw it
[48:12] before it happened
[48:14] so it wasn't just a scripture there and
[48:16] then he's got to work out how the
[48:17] details he saw the details he saw the he
[48:20] saw the scourging he saw the rejection
[48:22] he saw the pain he saw the agony he saw
[48:25] everything he had to endure
[48:27] in vision form and then he found himself
[48:30] stepping into that vision
[48:32] now none of us in our humanity would
[48:34] sign up for that no one likes pain
[48:36] no one likes rejection no one likes
[48:38] dying of a broken heart no one would
[48:39] sign up for that but he saw it and then
[48:42] he stepped into it
[48:43] and that's why he had the great agony in
[48:46] gethsemane where where it was like drops
[48:48] of blood the bubbles was dropping from
[48:50] his face he was under great agony
[48:51] because i think brother brown said it
[48:54] there was
[48:55] he was the one who was going to fulfill
[48:57] the job and only he could fulfill the
[48:59] job there was no second lamb he was it
[49:02] it was him and him alone but then heaven
[49:04] was waiting for an answer will he do it
[49:07] will he do it
[49:08] the angels were there
[49:10] yeah heaven was waiting because he was
[49:12] the lamb of god take away the sin of the
[49:13] world
[49:14] but then finally the answer came back
[49:17] not my will
[49:18] he says lord if you're willing take this
[49:20] cup from me
[49:21] but nevertheless not my will but thy
[49:24] will be done
[49:25] so because no one likes to die
[49:28] no one likes to feel pain and he knew
[49:30] what he had to fulfill when moses and
[49:32] elijah were with him on mount
[49:33] transfiguration it said in one account
[49:35] that they told him what he had to
[49:36] accomplish at jerusalem so they would
[49:38] have taken the scripture and they would
[49:40] begin to quote isaiah to him you'll be
[49:42] wounded for our transgressions the
[49:44] chastiser of our peace will be upon you
[49:45] and by your stripes we'll be healed i
[49:47] mean the iniquity of us all be poured
[49:49] out upon you i mean you are the lamb of
[49:51] god and no doubt they would say you know
[49:53] you're going to be you know they're
[49:54] going to pierce your hands and your feet
[49:56] you're going to be rejected you're going
[49:57] to be mocked you're going to you're
[49:58] going to take this into the world you
[50:00] know you're going to be our sin offering
[50:02] you're going to be our our our scapegoat
[50:05] you know and so they would have poured
[50:06] that they just had a few moments to just
[50:08] pour into him we're waiting on you to
[50:10] take your place we're waiting on we need
[50:12] you you think of moses the mightiest
[50:14] prophet
[50:15] of the old testament era
[50:17] never was a man like him when god spoke
[50:20] to him lip to wear incredible ministry
[50:22] incredible powers of deliverance but he
[50:25] did not have within himself the power to
[50:27] subject his whole self
[50:29] to the word of god his temple was still
[50:32] in him he couldn't he couldn't be free
[50:33] of it no matter how much god moved how
[50:36] much he was in the presence of god there
[50:37] wasn't a blood there that could change
[50:39] his sin nature i mean elijah was the
[50:42] same way where he called fire down on
[50:44] those two two bands of fifty that wasn't
[50:46] god that was him using a gift the wrong
[50:49] way
[50:49] that was his humanity working
[50:52] and so even these mighty men they needed
[50:54] someone to come
[50:55] to redeem them to actually change their
[50:57] nature
[50:58] amen yeah well well they had already
[51:00] gone but you know they were under the
[51:01] blood of bulls and goats they needed
[51:03] someone not just they needed blood to
[51:05] come not just to cover their sin like
[51:07] the blood and bulls and ghosts did but
[51:08] to take their sin away
[51:10] that's why they're waiting in paradise
[51:11] waiting for that true blood to come to
[51:14] clear their debt it had been covered by
[51:15] the blood of bulls and goats but they
[51:17] needed one to take it all away
[51:19] so now here was the lord jesus and to me
[51:21] this is the greatest miracle we're a man
[51:23] you think about this a man
[51:25] could subject his whole life be a true
[51:27] prisoner
[51:28] to the word of god to the will of god
[51:30] for his life amen and not just not just
[51:33] um you know not just a promise
[51:37] but the promise of a resurrection no one
[51:39] else had come out of the grave on their
[51:40] own accord before but he went to calvary
[51:43] with psalm 16
[51:45] as a revelation in his heart and that's
[51:48] why he could say no man takes my life
[51:50] from me i lay it down and i'll raise it
[51:52] back up again i mean because he knew
[51:55] that though he was going to die for the
[51:56] sins of the world he knew he wasn't
[51:58] going to stay in the grave because it
[52:00] had been quickened to him
[52:02] that this was a this is what was going
[52:03] to happen
[52:05] hallelujah
[52:06] so to me that's the greatest miracle
[52:09] where he could fulfill surrender himself
[52:12] to the word that pertained to him
[52:15] samson was an incredible man
[52:17] he would kill a thousand philistines
[52:19] with a jawbone
[52:20] of an ass he'll carry the gates of gaza
[52:22] i think it's actually about 20 miles how
[52:24] far he carried those gates
[52:26] uphill
[52:27] he did incredible things
[52:29] but yet he could not overcome to
[52:32] actually give his whole life to god
[52:34] that that remember he gave his strength
[52:36] to god but his heart to delilah
[52:38] so he could not subject his own passions
[52:41] to the word of god
[52:43] he could not do it
[52:45] none of the prophets could do it we know
[52:46] every man has to fail there's only one
[52:48] man that cannot fail and has not failed
[52:50] that is jesus christ himself every man
[52:52] woman and child has to fail
[52:54] but our god cannot fail
[52:57] now we know that you know
[53:00] our lord jesus though he was he was you
[53:02] know he was born by the virgin birth
[53:05] which bypassed thee but you know bypass
[53:08] the original sin he was still flesh and
[53:09] blood like you and i
[53:11] where the apostle paul would say in
[53:12] hebrews 2 verse 14 for as much soon as
[53:15] the children are partakers of flesh and
[53:17] blood he also he also himself likewise
[53:21] took part of the same that through death
[53:23] he might destroy him that had the power
[53:25] of death that is the devil and deliver
[53:27] them who affair of death were all this
[53:30] lifetime
[53:31] subject to bondage so he'd deliver us
[53:33] from the fear of death
[53:35] we don't need to fear death no more
[53:37] amen for verily he took not on him the
[53:39] nature of angels but he took on him the
[53:41] seed of abraham wherefore in all things
[53:44] that behooved him to be made like unto
[53:45] his brethren he's talking about you in
[53:47] that verse where his brethren that he
[53:49] might be a merciful and faithful high
[53:51] priest in the things pertaining to god
[53:53] to make reconciliation for the sins of
[53:55] the world and that he himself has
[53:57] suffered being tempted he is able to
[54:00] secure them that are tempted so he was
[54:03] tempted on all points yet without sin
[54:06] so every temptation that is actually we
[54:08] have we we we are tempted with he felt
[54:11] that temptation he wasn't immune from
[54:13] those things he didn't live in a bubble
[54:15] right so there was sexual temptation
[54:17] there was all kinds of temptations that
[54:18] actually came against him
[54:20] but though he was tempted amen he knows
[54:24] what it's like to be tempted but he
[54:25] didn't give in to the temptation because
[54:27] there's a big difference to being
[54:28] tempted
[54:29] feeling tempted and then giving into the
[54:31] temptation right but he's saying this
[54:33] here the impossible saying that because
[54:35] he was all he also has suffered being
[54:37] tempted he's able to secure them that
[54:40] are tempted now that words secure there
[54:42] it means to help it means to bring aid
[54:45] amen so if you're being tempted you have
[54:47] a high priest this morning that can
[54:49] bring you aid to give you strength to
[54:51] actually help you to bypass the
[54:52] temptation to overcome that temptation
[54:55] he is not indifferent or
[54:57] he understands exactly what it's like to
[54:59] be tempted right many see the devil
[55:02] tries to twist it in our mind god don't
[55:03] understand what we're going through he
[55:05] knows very well what we go through i
[55:07] mean because he's experienced it he's
[55:08] felt it himself amen so he can he can
[55:11] relate to you and i
[55:13] hallelujah i'm glad we serve a god this
[55:15] morning that can relate to us amen that
[55:17] say lord you know how i feel you've been
[55:19] through this you've walked in these
[55:20] steps before i mean but he can bring aid
[55:23] but we need to we need to call upon him
[55:26] say lord i am going through this
[55:27] temptation i'm going through this this
[55:29] is hard this is drawing me my flesh is
[55:31] being pulled one part of me says no but
[55:33] the other part says yes lord take away
[55:35] the yes part that i can you know help me
[55:37] in this and then he'll bring you in
[55:40] hallelujah
[55:41] amen but we know that our lord jesus i
[55:43] said he had the five same senses as our
[55:45] same and that's to the spirit all those
[55:47] things but yet the only difference is he
[55:49] is virgin born which bypass the original
[55:52] sin so he did not have sin nature within
[55:54] him
[55:55] right see
[55:56] brother brown makes it very clear
[55:58] throughout his ministry he says we are
[55:59] not saved by the blood of a jew
[56:02] jesus was not a jew
[56:04] jesus was not a gentile it was the blood
[56:06] of almighty god it was god made flesh
[56:09] hallelujah that's who he was amen he
[56:11] wasn't he wasn't a jew he wasn't a
[56:14] gentile he was god amen as as he said
[56:17] the breach between the seven church ages
[56:19] the seven seals he says notice this now
[56:21] he must be kinsmen he must be one of us
[56:24] hallelujah i'm glad he's not a different
[56:26] specie
[56:27] amen he's one of us
[56:29] amen see an angel couldn't do it a man
[56:31] couldn't do it it must be a man but it
[56:33] can't be born of a woman a sex sex so
[56:36] the virgin birth the holy spirit
[56:37] overshadowed mary therefore jesus was
[56:39] not a jew jesus was not a gentile jesus
[56:42] was god that's exactly his blood didn't
[56:44] come from any sex act he was the holy
[56:46] created blood of god and we're not saved
[56:48] by jewish blood neither we saved by
[56:50] gentile blood we're saved by the blood
[56:52] of god i mean that's according to the
[56:55] bible it says so now you think about
[56:57] this where the blood of god is the most
[56:59] valuable life upon the earth the most
[57:01] valuable blood you know the royal
[57:03] families they try and protect their
[57:04] bloodlines and all your all different
[57:06] cultures have it because they want to
[57:08] keep their their family pure and high
[57:10] status whatever more and they put great
[57:12] value on those things but the greatest
[57:14] value now that's just carnal humanity
[57:16] trying to be greater than one another
[57:17] right but now if god became a man that
[57:20] blood is the most valuable person upon
[57:22] the earth but you got to think about it
[57:24] whenever you buy something
[57:26] you put the value of what you want to
[57:28] buy at greater value than your money if
[57:30] you valid your money greater than what
[57:32] you're going to buy you won't buy it
[57:33] right because i'd rather save this money
[57:35] because you know just say you got 100
[57:37] bucks and you want to buy something
[57:39] that's worth 100 bucks but if you think
[57:40] that thing is not worth the 100 you
[57:41] won't buy it but if you think it's worth
[57:43] 100 bucks you'll buy it right because
[57:45] you put greater value on what you're
[57:47] buying than what you possess so god
[57:49] himself with the blood of almighty god
[57:51] put greater value on you than his own
[57:53] life right he valued you above himself
[57:56] that's why he purchased you if he
[57:58] thought you weren't as valid or less
[57:59] valuable than himself he would never
[58:01] have done it right but because he put
[58:03] you at greater value maybe that's why
[58:05] the devil he wants to try and stomp us
[58:07] down saying we're not yo there's nothing
[58:08] to us we're not important you know he
[58:10] tries to make us hate ourselves and
[58:12] think we're not worth and we're full of
[58:13] defects and stuff forget that
[58:16] god said your greater value than me
[58:18] that's what he's declared that's why he
[58:20] died on calvary because you are greater
[58:22] value than himself and he didn't
[58:24] actually in his humanity sure he said
[58:26] not my will but thy will be done but
[58:27] then there's a joy set before him he was
[58:30] excited to make the purchase i mean he's
[58:32] excited too to make the payment to
[58:34] redeem you back to himself
[58:36] hallelujah
[58:38] amen
[58:39] praise god you're i'm so glad that that
[58:41] god has laws
[58:43] the law of redemption is a great law
[58:46] amen because the law of redemption
[58:48] declares that if anything can be
[58:49] redeemed it should be redeemed amen and
[58:52] now i love it our brother braham he you
[58:53] know takes the story of a you know
[58:55] because in the in the old testament law
[58:57] there are certain animals you know the
[58:59] firstborn had to be redeemed
[59:01] had to be redeemed by the blood of the
[59:02] lamb now it didn't matter what condition
[59:04] that animal was in brother brown would
[59:06] say like a baby of a donkey that you
[59:08] know that that that donkey could have
[59:11] cross eyes hanging down ears which
[59:13] apparently means it's no good knobbly
[59:15] knees a funny back and it may be walking
[59:17] like this and can't even look straight
[59:19] and it can be the most miserable looking
[59:21] donkey that there is in existence
[59:23] and maybe that baby maybe look in the
[59:25] mirror and say i'm done for master's
[59:26] going to kill me i'm worth nothing but
[59:28] if mama knew about the laws of
[59:30] redemption she could say no no son or
[59:32] daughter the first born one don't worry
[59:34] there's a lamb that has to be provided
[59:36] for you because god has a law which says
[59:39] you must be redeemed amen so it doesn't
[59:42] matter how nobly your knees are how
[59:43] crippled you are up in sin i mean how
[59:46] troubled you may be in your spirit
[59:47] complexes to here to africa it doesn't
[59:49] matter amen there's still a blood
[59:51] there's still a redemption amen that god
[59:54] paid amen that doesn't matter because
[59:56] we're going to stop looking at you and i
[59:58] we're going to stop looking at ourselves
[1:00:00] god don't look at you he looks at the
[1:00:02] lamb i mean god don't examine you he
[1:00:04] examines the lamb
[1:00:05] even if we fall and failed you know
[1:00:08] god knew we'd fall and fail
[1:00:10] god knew that we had miserably failed he
[1:00:13] knew it he's not surprising oh why did
[1:00:15] they go do that no he knew but yet when
[1:00:17] he died on calvary he saw your entire
[1:00:20] life
[1:00:21] and he shed his blood for your entire
[1:00:23] life not just parts that are doing well
[1:00:25] but the whole thing i mean he purchased
[1:00:28] your whole life not just part of it your
[1:00:30] whole life so the good and the bad the
[1:00:33] successful you think and the miserable
[1:00:35] failures all of those things he says
[1:00:37] i've got blood for that i've got a
[1:00:39] covering i've got a redemption
[1:00:41] hallelujah so we can rejoice amen the
[1:00:43] mother donkey could say don't worry son
[1:00:45] amen no the master must provide a lamb
[1:00:48] because it's in the word i mean so
[1:00:49] you're not going to be examined by the
[1:00:51] master he's not going to come into this
[1:00:52] barn and say now look at you
[1:00:55] and how many hands tally i don't know if
[1:00:56] they do that for donkeys for horses you
[1:00:58] know how look at how look at your teeth
[1:01:00] how well you know how strong whatever no
[1:01:02] he doesn't look at your performance son
[1:01:04] he's not looking what you think you are
[1:01:06] no
[1:01:07] if he there's a perfect lamb that's what
[1:01:10] he's gonna look at and there's a perfect
[1:01:12] lamb hallelujah that will take your
[1:01:14] place do you know what that cross-eyed
[1:01:16] knock i'd need not whatever donkey could
[1:01:18] do he could just rejoice he could let
[1:01:20] off the pressure saying hallelujah
[1:01:22] there's a blood i've been redeemed amen
[1:01:24] my life is not being taken because god
[1:01:26] is taking care of it
[1:01:28] hallelujah
[1:01:30] amen that's the same thing with you and
[1:01:32] i
[1:01:33] amen he says it's not what i am who i am
[1:01:37] it's the perfection of jesus christ and
[1:01:39] god that died in my place to make me
[1:01:41] what i am
[1:01:42] isn't it it isn't whether i can stand i
[1:01:45] can't it's whether he stood in my place
[1:01:48] hallelujah and he stood in your place
[1:01:50] amen he did not he stood on your place
[1:01:53] he's our representative you know
[1:01:56] there's there's a lot of great legal
[1:01:57] cases that go on in the world and the
[1:01:59] more money people have the better legal
[1:02:01] teams they get
[1:02:02] because they don't just want to get some
[1:02:03] fresh person out of universe that knows
[1:02:05] nothing about the law they want to pay
[1:02:07] and they're willing to pay the best
[1:02:09] because the stakes are so high
[1:02:11] now you think about the real court of
[1:02:13] law god's court
[1:02:15] that's the highest stakes because god's
[1:02:17] children are in jeopardy i mean because
[1:02:19] the devil the accuser comes along and he
[1:02:21] tries to bring his evidence
[1:02:23] and say great great great lawyer of the
[1:02:25] uh yo oh oh judge he wouldn't say you're
[1:02:28] on it because i don't think you'd give
[1:02:29] that respect to god it'd say
[1:02:31] on the 13th of whenever 2000 this is
[1:02:34] what happened and we have video evidence
[1:02:35] and he'd do all those things because the
[1:02:37] stakes are high because god no god
[1:02:40] cannot lose a part of himself
[1:02:42] and the devil's determined i'm going to
[1:02:43] get one
[1:02:44] because if if the devil can get one he's
[1:02:47] won but he can't get one because god
[1:02:49] says all the father has given me will
[1:02:51] come to me and all that come through
[1:02:53] i'll know why is cast out nothing can
[1:02:55] pluck them out of my hands but the devil
[1:02:57] tries as hard as he can to pluck us out
[1:02:59] of god's hands but he can't do it
[1:03:02] he may try real good but he can't do it
[1:03:04] i mean so in god's great court the devil
[1:03:06] comes along because the stakes are so
[1:03:08] high now you think about it
[1:03:10] god could get a great lawyer
[1:03:12] but he decided no no this is a god size
[1:03:15] job i'm not going to put it into the
[1:03:17] hands of a man
[1:03:18] a mortal man that's been born and sinned
[1:03:20] and shaped indicated come to all
[1:03:21] speaking lives to be to be the defendant
[1:03:24] oh i mean no not the defendant to be the
[1:03:26] attorney to to be our defense no no he
[1:03:28] said this is a this is a god size job
[1:03:30] that means that's why our judge became
[1:03:32] our attorney
[1:03:34] hallelujah and if our judge became our
[1:03:35] attorney case dismissed
[1:03:37] hallelujah
[1:03:39] amen
[1:03:40] so what are you got to worry about
[1:03:43] amen well the devil's on my case that's
[1:03:45] good you know why that's good because
[1:03:46] you've got something that he wants that
[1:03:48] you're not willing to give him
[1:03:51] amen that's your life
[1:03:53] sound bombarded that's fine
[1:03:55] they're coming into the bombardment just
[1:03:57] keep walking on with the lord
[1:03:59] amen the devil's a liar anyway
[1:04:02] amen we have a perfect lamb
[1:04:04] this lamb has stood through the test of
[1:04:06] time
[1:04:07] amen
[1:04:09] hallelujah
[1:04:10] now
[1:04:11] just as that donkey had a birthright
[1:04:15] that they
[1:04:16] are to be redeemed now a birthright
[1:04:18] means it's a right that you're given by
[1:04:19] your birth
[1:04:20] right so you don't earn it
[1:04:22] you don't you don't acquire it by
[1:04:24] something you do just because you're
[1:04:26] born
[1:04:27] you receive that right that's a
[1:04:28] birthright right so that donkey baby had
[1:04:31] a birthright that that had to be
[1:04:32] redeemed
[1:04:34] and it wasn't conditional based on their
[1:04:35] appearance how strong whatever pedigree
[1:04:37] blah blah none of that it was because of
[1:04:39] their birth now i'm laboring this
[1:04:40] because i just want you to realize that
[1:04:42] a birthright is as an incredible power
[1:04:45] if you realize it's your right by birth
[1:04:48] so every human on the planet has a
[1:04:50] birthright to be redeemed
[1:04:53] by their natural birth
[1:04:55] they have a right to be redeemed
[1:04:57] not by not by their age their their
[1:05:00] intelligence their parents that there's
[1:05:02] no condition the only condition is
[1:05:04] they're born
[1:05:06] who's been born
[1:05:07] who's i'm glad some of you were actually
[1:05:09] birthed by your mother and here you are
[1:05:10] i don't know how you got here we need a
[1:05:12] testimony service to because that would
[1:05:13] be quite a story but you know we've all
[1:05:15] been born right so we all have a right
[1:05:17] to be redeemed
[1:05:19] hallelujah and before we ever realize we
[1:05:21] have that right our lord jesus already
[1:05:23] provided a way already paid the price
[1:05:25] for our redemption
[1:05:27] hallelujah so therefore we can go to god
[1:05:29] say god that's my right you've already
[1:05:31] purchased my salvation lord i want to
[1:05:33] give myself to you amen
[1:05:35] irrespective of how crippled up we are
[1:05:38] in sin spiritually whatever it is how we
[1:05:40] think about ourselves how much we hate
[1:05:42] ourselves whatever more we have a right
[1:05:44] to that perfect lamb who stands in our
[1:05:47] place
[1:05:48] amen
[1:05:50] hallelujah i'm so glad that's the case
[1:05:52] now
[1:05:53] now
[1:05:55] as i said the the greatest miracle to me
[1:05:57] is that that look our lord jesus
[1:05:59] subjected himself
[1:06:02] to the will of god concerning him
[1:06:04] to be a prisoner
[1:06:07] i pray that when brother brown preaches
[1:06:09] the sermon like a prisoner of jesus
[1:06:10] christ it's not a cliche
[1:06:12] it's not just a oh you know
[1:06:14] how he says god is looking for prisoners
[1:06:16] it shouldn't be a cliche among us
[1:06:18] actually something that we aspire to
[1:06:21] say lord make me a prisoner i want to be
[1:06:24] a full prisoner i don't want to be a
[1:06:25] part-time home detention kind of
[1:06:27] prisoner
[1:06:29] i want to be a full prisoner
[1:06:30] 24 7. i'm in chains of love
[1:06:34] amen to your word to you
[1:06:36] now jesus
[1:06:38] uh you know you know there came a spot
[1:06:39] where we're his disciples because they
[1:06:41] saw the lord in prayer and they said to
[1:06:44] him teach us how to pray because they
[1:06:46] saw he had great so much power with god
[1:06:50] that had never been seen in the earth
[1:06:53] and so so they were longing say lord
[1:06:55] teach us to pray how do you how do you
[1:06:57] commune
[1:06:58] with your father in heaven
[1:07:00] and
[1:07:02] he would say in this in matthew 6 i'm
[1:07:04] just i'm just kind of coming into uh
[1:07:07] the midst of it here in verse 8 be
[1:07:09] be not ye therefore like unto them for
[1:07:11] your father knows the things you have
[1:07:13] need of before you ask them
[1:07:15] hallelujah well why does he want you to
[1:07:17] ask them because he's the high priest of
[1:07:18] our profession so he he needs you to
[1:07:21] move your lips and express it to him
[1:07:23] though he knows what's going on he knows
[1:07:25] full well he probably knows details more
[1:07:27] than you know i i can guarantee that
[1:07:29] because he knows everything
[1:07:30] right but you see he needs you to
[1:07:32] express it to him
[1:07:34] hallelujah even if you can't exactly put
[1:07:36] it in words it's your heart's cry
[1:07:39] that that that that he hears so he says
[1:07:43] after this manner therefore pray ye
[1:07:45] our father which art in heaven hallowed
[1:07:47] be thy name so may the name be glorified
[1:07:50] lift it up
[1:07:51] thy kingdom come this is the first thing
[1:07:53] after you give praise to lord the first
[1:07:55] thing is thy kingdom come thy will be
[1:07:58] done in earth as it is in heaven now
[1:08:00] heaven is run by the word
[1:08:02] right heaven heaven is is is run by the
[1:08:05] word and it's governed by divine love
[1:08:08] right it's a kingdom of divine love
[1:08:10] now so our lord jesus teaching us to
[1:08:12] pray may that
[1:08:14] headship and rulership of divine love
[1:08:17] the word may come down
[1:08:20] may that will be done on earth as it is
[1:08:22] in heaven now when he says in earth to
[1:08:25] me he's not just speaking of of just the
[1:08:27] world cosmos he's talking about our
[1:08:29] earth
[1:08:31] because god is individual right sure we
[1:08:33] pray for nations and things going on but
[1:08:35] but it's our he's interested in you he
[1:08:38] wants your attention he wants your love
[1:08:40] he wants to walk and express himself and
[1:08:41] reveal himself in everyday life to you
[1:08:44] build a relationship with you so saying
[1:08:46] thy will
[1:08:48] they will be done in earth as it is in
[1:08:50] heaven so the same will is being done in
[1:08:53] heaven the this is saying that may that
[1:08:55] same will be expressed in me
[1:08:59] and this is the first thing that this is
[1:09:01] the order i know this may be very
[1:09:03] elementary but you know the thing is
[1:09:05] there's so many voices in this day
[1:09:07] there's so many wills being expressed we
[1:09:09] know ultimately it's only two god and
[1:09:11] satan right but but there's so many
[1:09:13] wills being expressed and desires and
[1:09:16] things and and ambitions and plans and
[1:09:18] things being projected through all kinds
[1:09:20] of media whatever more but god god wants
[1:09:23] us to do his will
[1:09:25] and so i think it's so important in this
[1:09:28] day
[1:09:29] that thy will be done on earth as it is
[1:09:31] in heaven he did not say that my will be
[1:09:34] done
[1:09:35] as an uh you know as a human and i was
[1:09:38] thinking you know how many times do we
[1:09:40] go to the lord in prayer with our mind
[1:09:43] made up already
[1:09:45] oh we're seeking god's will but really
[1:09:47] in your heart you've already got how
[1:09:48] it's going to happen and why and you
[1:09:50] know you present your case and this is
[1:09:51] how it should be because we're
[1:09:53] emotionally invested into something or
[1:09:55] you know yeah but how many times do we
[1:09:57] go with our mind made up now i'm i'm
[1:10:00] specifically really talking about things
[1:10:02] that you know there's there's some
[1:10:03] things we know what the father's will is
[1:10:06] salvation of our family we don't need to
[1:10:07] pray lord you will be saved because he
[1:10:09] said there's not willing that any should
[1:10:10] perish right it's very you know or you
[1:10:13] know there's there's sickness or the
[1:10:15] devil's on someone's troubling someone
[1:10:17] in their mind or those kind of things
[1:10:18] you know we know what the will of god is
[1:10:20] for those things that the devil will be
[1:10:21] cast out i mean that that that healing
[1:10:24] would come deliverance would come we
[1:10:26] know that that is god's will
[1:10:28] right but when it comes to some other
[1:10:29] things
[1:10:31] sometimes we have our mind made up
[1:10:32] already i'm just gonna
[1:10:34] you know who's
[1:10:36] you know that feeling hey
[1:10:38] let's be real honest
[1:10:40] you know when you've got your mind made
[1:10:41] up and you want things you know
[1:10:43] and then
[1:10:45] and then and then and then here's
[1:10:46] another like another thing yeah yeah i
[1:10:48] thought of last night so i don't have
[1:10:50] any specific examples whenever mine made
[1:10:52] up oh like you know you want to go on a
[1:10:53] holiday somewhere
[1:10:55] of course you want to go on holiday
[1:10:56] somewhere but is it the lord's will to
[1:10:58] go
[1:10:59] or have you got your mind made up
[1:11:00] already
[1:11:02] now and then what about if you're asking
[1:11:04] for something in prayer but you know you
[1:11:07] could have it anyway
[1:11:09] so naturally you could get it so you
[1:11:12] know actually yep you could do that so
[1:11:14] for example if you had the money to you
[1:11:16] know buy buy a car or do something
[1:11:19] you know and you're praying lord shall i
[1:11:20] buy the car but you know in your heart
[1:11:22] you can go do it anyway
[1:11:24] do you already pray just with your mind
[1:11:26] made up because you can physically do it
[1:11:28] or do you ask him if it's his will
[1:11:31] see we've got to go
[1:11:33] and i'm very much talking to myself
[1:11:36] we need to pray in such a way that we
[1:11:37] become neutral and then we ask our
[1:11:39] petition
[1:11:40] because it's not because we want his
[1:11:42] will be done we don't want our will
[1:11:44] wrapped in some religious jargon
[1:11:47] and we and we and we present it as his
[1:11:50] will
[1:11:51] we need it to be our will
[1:11:54] or do we pray or approach our lord that
[1:11:57] we're willing to surrender our own will
[1:11:59] that his will is done in our lives
[1:12:02] do we love him enough
[1:12:04] that we want his will to be done more
[1:12:06] than to see our own done
[1:12:08] do we love him enough
[1:12:12] now see us here
[1:12:14] in
[1:12:15] galatians 5 and 6.
[1:12:17] he says for in jesus christ neither
[1:12:19] circumcision availeth anything nor
[1:12:21] uncircumcision but faith which worketh
[1:12:24] by love now that word availeth it means
[1:12:27] to have power or force or be strong see
[1:12:29] saying that there's no strength or power
[1:12:31] in circumcision or uncircumcision in
[1:12:34] in jesus christ those things have no
[1:12:36] power it's got no force behind it but
[1:12:39] faith worketh by love so there's
[1:12:41] actually the power or what avails is
[1:12:44] faith that's working by love so
[1:12:46] something that worketh it means to be
[1:12:48] active it means to be efficient so so so
[1:12:50] faith is active by love
[1:12:53] right that's when that's when faith
[1:12:55] really takes a hold is when it works by
[1:12:57] love
[1:12:58] amen not by anything else this is how
[1:13:01] faith is efficient right because he's
[1:13:03] talking to the galatians they were
[1:13:04] trying to bring the old testament back
[1:13:06] in and you know laws and legalism and
[1:13:07] different things but the apostle paul
[1:13:09] just just and just in one verse says
[1:13:12] what you're doing is not going to avail
[1:13:13] anything you need to realize this faith
[1:13:16] worketh by love that's the only way that
[1:13:18] you can have power that's the only way
[1:13:19] there can be a force in your life is if
[1:13:21] your faith is working by love
[1:13:24] amen so that's why i asked the question
[1:13:26] do you love him enough
[1:13:28] that you'd be willing to see his own
[1:13:30] will done more than your own
[1:13:33] now brother braham says isn't god who's
[1:13:35] rich in mercy and and christine shared
[1:13:37] this quote with me the other week i
[1:13:39] thought such a powerful thing he says a
[1:13:41] man said to me the other day this is
[1:13:43] speaking to brother brown i think you're
[1:13:44] just a fine man mr branham but i believe
[1:13:47] you're sincerely wrong you're out of the
[1:13:49] will do you know you'll be condemned at
[1:13:51] the end and i said look i want to tell
[1:13:53] you something i'm going to say that you
[1:13:56] that you would be right just to say for
[1:13:58] argument's sake
[1:13:59] if i'm wrong which i don't believe i am
[1:14:01] but if i was wrong and i knowed right
[1:14:04] now that i was going to live to be a
[1:14:05] hundred years old and he was going to
[1:14:06] condemn me at the end of the road and
[1:14:08] tell me you don't deserve to come into
[1:14:10] my heaven william brown get out into
[1:14:12] outer darkness you know what i would
[1:14:14] serve him every day of my life until i
[1:14:17] went anyhow for i have received so much
[1:14:20] of his unmerited blessings
[1:14:22] he's more than life to me he's
[1:14:24] everything that i am hallelujah he says
[1:14:27] all that i am all i could have ever
[1:14:29] hoped to be i have derived from his
[1:14:32] grace and mercy i was wretched miserable
[1:14:35] poor and blind but by his grace he has
[1:14:37] healed me i am strong and healthy by the
[1:14:39] grace of god i have good eyesight i can
[1:14:42] eat drink have whatever i have need of
[1:14:44] he never promised to supply my wants but
[1:14:46] my needs and if i am cast away at that
[1:14:49] day and know that i cannot see where i
[1:14:52] would be i mean i mean um i cannot see
[1:14:54] where i'd be but if i knew i was wrong
[1:14:58] now listen to this and god chose me to
[1:15:00] be wrong i would want to stay wrong and
[1:15:03] because that and because that i want to
[1:15:06] do his will
[1:15:07] i love him till i want his will to be
[1:15:11] done
[1:15:12] now that's a big statement but i hope
[1:15:13] you get it in the way of the spirit that
[1:15:15] i set it in i see i want to do his will
[1:15:20] can we come to that place
[1:15:22] that that that that if we knew at the
[1:15:24] end of our road
[1:15:26] we would we would be cast away
[1:15:29] would you still serve him would you
[1:15:31] still love him because you've received
[1:15:33] so much of you know so much received of
[1:15:35] his unmerited blessings into your life
[1:15:37] you know i had an experience this is
[1:15:39] when i was a real real early christian
[1:15:41] and and um you know the devil came to me
[1:15:45] um after i was uh messaging back into
[1:15:47] and from with my sister about some
[1:15:48] things and and she said she was helped
[1:15:49] by it and answered her questions
[1:15:50] whatever more but then but then the
[1:15:52] devil came to me and he twisted the
[1:15:54] scripture about if you sin willfully
[1:15:55] there's no there's no blood for you i'm
[1:15:57] just there's not verbatim but you know
[1:15:59] the scripture says that if there's if
[1:16:00] you sin willfully you know you know
[1:16:02] there's basically no more blood for you
[1:16:04] and he twisted it in my in my head that
[1:16:06] it's like a child where you tell them
[1:16:09] not to do something and they do it
[1:16:10] anyway then they're wrong they say
[1:16:11] that's the same thing with that so your
[1:16:13] bible says do a certain thing you don't
[1:16:15] do it then there's no more blood for you
[1:16:16] and you're lost
[1:16:17] and and my heart sunk like a lead
[1:16:20] balloon
[1:16:21] and i just read the supernatural series
[1:16:23] where brother graham's telling billy
[1:16:24] paul um you know i think they were out
[1:16:26] washing the car and you know billy paul
[1:16:28] was smoking and doing those things and
[1:16:30] you know you know the sun's shining on
[1:16:31] them and he says to billy paul you know
[1:16:33] put your hands out like this and then
[1:16:34] and then behind them was because of the
[1:16:36] shadow there's a there's a t junction
[1:16:38] and he says billy paul you're in the
[1:16:40] middle you're at the intersection you're
[1:16:41] going to make up your mind are you going
[1:16:42] to go with god or you're going to go
[1:16:44] with the world you can't do both
[1:16:46] and um and and and i said to the lord
[1:16:48] lord
[1:16:50] i burned every bridge i might just put a
[1:16:52] hand down
[1:16:53] i have nowhere to go
[1:16:55] into the world
[1:16:56] i can't go back there there's nothing
[1:16:58] back for me there you know i'm i'm just
[1:17:01] gonna keep walking with you and
[1:17:02] and i said to him i said lord
[1:17:04] even if i am lost at least i get a
[1:17:06] opportunity at the end of all things to
[1:17:08] stand before you and say to you face to
[1:17:10] face i love you then you can cast me to
[1:17:12] hell if you want
[1:17:13] you know but
[1:17:14] are we willing
[1:17:16] are we willing to
[1:17:18] want his will
[1:17:20] just like the prophet said if he knew
[1:17:22] that god chose him to be wrong
[1:17:25] that he would stay wrong because he just
[1:17:28] loves that he wants his will done
[1:17:33] he says
[1:17:35] i want to do his will
[1:17:37] i ask him for something sometime he
[1:17:39] shakes his head no i just rejoice so
[1:17:42] much as if he said yes because we always
[1:17:46] ought to ask thy will be done his nose
[1:17:49] if it's his will that's just it's a
[1:17:51] whole lot better than his yeses if it's
[1:17:53] his will to do it then that's when you
[1:17:56] really love him
[1:17:59] amen
[1:18:01] see that's when you really love him when
[1:18:03] he says no you rejoice in the no
[1:18:05] if it's his will if he says yes you
[1:18:07] rejoice in the yes
[1:18:08] you just you just want to see his will
[1:18:10] done
[1:18:12] amen he says that's when you really love
[1:18:14] him
[1:18:15] he says i get to talking about him i
[1:18:17] just can't stop oh he's so real so real
[1:18:19] to me friends he's all that i am all i
[1:18:21] ever could be all i expect to be
[1:18:23] is grounded in christ jesus the word
[1:18:27] amen so so
[1:18:29] do we love him enough
[1:18:31] see jesus was a prisoner to the word
[1:18:33] and he's our example we want to be like
[1:18:35] jesus
[1:18:36] but but are we do we love god enough
[1:18:38] that our own ambitions are put to one
[1:18:40] side do we love god enough that our own
[1:18:43] plans can be put to one side do we love
[1:18:45] him enough
[1:18:47] that if he says no though we know we
[1:18:49] could get it if we wanted
[1:18:51] we could get what we asked for and but
[1:18:52] he says no do we love him enough to
[1:18:54] actually accept the no
[1:18:55] that we just want his will to be done
[1:18:58] do we love him enough that if we do get
[1:19:00] cast away at the end we would serve him
[1:19:02] anyway because we've received so many
[1:19:04] blessings on this side
[1:19:06] hallelujah we received so many blessings
[1:19:08] god poured himself in time after time
[1:19:10] amen saved us amen redeemed us healed us
[1:19:13] when we're sick guide us when we are
[1:19:15] lost we're troubled in mind he brought
[1:19:17] peace amen we're unstable he brought
[1:19:19] stability amen he's done so much to us
[1:19:22] hallelujah poured himself out time and
[1:19:24] time again
[1:19:26] amen so many unmerited blessings he has
[1:19:29] given us
[1:19:30] hallelujah
[1:19:32] amen the apostle paul would say that he
[1:19:34] is a prisoner of jesus christ
[1:19:37] to me that's an incredibly powerful
[1:19:39] statement
[1:19:40] when you look at the apostle paul's life
[1:19:43] it wasn't a life of flowery beard of
[1:19:45] ease
[1:19:46] he didn't just climb up some ivory tower
[1:19:48] and write some letters to the churches
[1:19:49] because he was because he felt like it
[1:19:52] he had a very hard rugged christian life
[1:19:54] i mean it wasn't a life of ease he was
[1:19:56] shipwrecked and beaten and had to run
[1:19:59] he'd have a meeting in one city people
[1:20:00] would raise up against him he'd run to
[1:20:02] the next city start having a revival
[1:20:04] those same people would chase into the
[1:20:05] next city start causing trouble and you
[1:20:07] know he'd be in prison he'd be
[1:20:09] beaten he'd be all kinds of things
[1:20:11] against him trouble within without
[1:20:13] within the church without the church all
[1:20:15] kinds of things you know he'd be chained
[1:20:17] to a roman guard but yet but yet he
[1:20:19] didn't let that dead man hinder him i
[1:20:21] mean for god to to pour in most of the
[1:20:23] new testament into his life
[1:20:24] amen even the apostle paul you think
[1:20:27] about him he had such a burden to get
[1:20:28] the word out
[1:20:30] he had such a burden that that this
[1:20:31] grace that had come to the gentiles it
[1:20:34] must be declared to the gentiles he was
[1:20:36] like a burning torch like a dry house on
[1:20:38] a windy day that's burning up he just
[1:20:40] couldn't help it and so no doubt no
[1:20:42] wonder in his humanity he'd say if
[1:20:44] wherever an open door is he'd want to go
[1:20:47] but yet he was such a prisoner to his
[1:20:49] own you know he was such a prisoner to
[1:20:52] god
[1:20:53] that when the lord when the spirit
[1:20:54] forbid him to do his own will he
[1:20:56] surrendered to it
[1:20:58] to me that's an incredible thing
[1:21:00] when because it was his will where's the
[1:21:02] open door let's go here you know because
[1:21:04] the spirit forbid him to go preach in
[1:21:06] asia it wasn't time yet
[1:21:07] he could have gone he had the
[1:21:09] opportunity but yet and then
[1:21:12] carnally you'd think but the churches
[1:21:14] could be found at eternal life's going
[1:21:15] to come to people the devil is going to
[1:21:16] be cast out but it wasn't the lord's
[1:21:19] timing to do it and because he was such
[1:21:21] a prisoner in the hands of god he'd say
[1:21:24] lord if you don't want me to go i'm not
[1:21:25] going
[1:21:27] amen
[1:21:28] to me that's an incredible thing
[1:21:31] can we can we be the same kind of people
[1:21:33] i believe i'm looking at the same
[1:21:34] material as the apostle paul right here
[1:21:36] the bride of christ right i believe i'm
[1:21:38] looking at the same peoples this is not
[1:21:40] unobtainable but are we prisoner enough
[1:21:43] do we love the lord enough
[1:21:46] amen
[1:21:48] he says oh god this is from um paul the
[1:21:50] prisoners in 1963 oh god make us
[1:21:53] prisoners like that from our own selfish
[1:21:56] ambition and from our own judgments and
[1:21:59] our better way of thinking to a prisoner
[1:22:01] of jesus christ i think it's a great
[1:22:03] statement i am a prisoner to jesus
[1:22:05] christ and remember he's the word seed
[1:22:07] no matter what anyone else thinks it's
[1:22:09] the word if you're a prisoner to the
[1:22:11] word no denomination can sway you from
[1:22:13] it it's the word you're a prisoner to it
[1:22:15] that's all you must act the way it acts
[1:22:19] amen now i he could not go to certain
[1:22:21] places that he wanted see the spirit
[1:22:24] verbatim you remember many times paul
[1:22:26] was trying to get to some place thinking
[1:22:28] there there is where i have a great
[1:22:30] meeting but the spirit would forbid him
[1:22:32] now
[1:22:33] does that clearly state and prove that
[1:22:35] paul was a prisoner a prisoner to jesus
[1:22:37] christ harnessed to his word by the
[1:22:39] spirit he says oh i like that he was
[1:22:42] bound he was bound by a chain and by
[1:22:44] fetters of love to do the will of god
[1:22:46] and that only he was a prisoner he was
[1:22:48] in fetters of love he was in a yoke with
[1:22:50] christ
[1:22:52] he could yoke up with nothing else he
[1:22:54] was yoked with him and where the law and
[1:22:57] where the lead went that's where he'd go
[1:22:59] regardless of how green the pastor was
[1:23:01] here on this side or on that side he had
[1:23:04] to go the way the leader and the yoke
[1:23:06] went oh tonight if we branham tabernacle
[1:23:09] could only become prisoners
[1:23:11] i could say osha kind of tabernacle this
[1:23:13] morning remember he's preaching this in
[1:23:15] 1963 they've had over decades of of
[1:23:18] supernatural god moving the son of man
[1:23:20] being revealed by the stage the seals
[1:23:22] are open and now he's saying if we could
[1:23:25] only come to this
[1:23:27] if we could only become prisoners
[1:23:29] to our own selfish being to our own
[1:23:32] ambition that we can completely
[1:23:33] surrender ourselves and be yoked to him
[1:23:36] no matter what the rest of the world
[1:23:38] thinks what the rest of the world does
[1:23:39] we're yoked with fetters of love we're
[1:23:41] prisoners my feet are so yoked with
[1:23:44] christ i won't dance my eyes are so
[1:23:47] yoked to christ till when i see these
[1:23:49] mons striptease on the street i turn my
[1:23:51] head my heart is so yoked and loved to
[1:23:53] him till i can't have love for this
[1:23:55] world anymore my will is so yoked to him
[1:23:58] till i don't even know what my ambitions
[1:24:01] are just wherever you lead
[1:24:03] i'll follow lord i'll be a prisoner see
[1:24:08] amen can we come to that place
[1:24:10] can we be full prisoners
[1:24:13] to our lord jesus christ because we love
[1:24:15] him so not because it's a duty or
[1:24:17] something is expected of us but because
[1:24:19] we love him remember faith worketh by
[1:24:21] love love is the force behind faith they
[1:24:24] they they bind hand in hand amen if you
[1:24:27] don't have divine love faith can't work
[1:24:29] right but we want faith to have her free
[1:24:31] course to take over right we want to be
[1:24:33] governed by
[1:24:34] perfect faith
[1:24:36] amen not by a carnal faith or a human
[1:24:38] faith but perfect faith living in our
[1:24:39] lives
[1:24:40] amen where god can sow just come pour
[1:24:43] himself in that it's now his character
[1:24:46] being formed in us like never before
[1:24:50] amen because remember he's looking for
[1:24:51] his character he's looking for his own
[1:24:53] nature and a people
[1:24:54] now i'm saying all this because we've
[1:24:56] got a perfect lamb right so i'm not
[1:24:58] saying because many times thinking well
[1:25:00] how can this happen no it takes a full
[1:25:01] surrender and a consecration
[1:25:04] a dying daily
[1:25:07] amen he says in doors of the door so
[1:25:09] this has gone a bit heavy but here we
[1:25:11] are he says now
[1:25:13] jesus when he was on earth he knew that
[1:25:15] the scripture pertained to him when he
[1:25:16] said you destroyed this body i raised up
[1:25:18] in three days the prophet had already
[1:25:20] said i'll i will not suffer my holy one
[1:25:22] to see corruption neither will i leave
[1:25:24] his soul in hell he knew that scripture
[1:25:26] pertained to him for he was the messiah
[1:25:28] and he knew it he his unfailing faith
[1:25:30] put him in position to know that he was
[1:25:33] the perfect born son of god
[1:25:36] if your faith will put you in position
[1:25:38] to know that every divine promise of
[1:25:40] god's bible is for you
[1:25:42] just as sure as that pertained to him
[1:25:44] every promise pertains to you
[1:25:47] that's what our faith does it's not
[1:25:49] maybe you'll get it no no your faith
[1:25:51] puts you in that position that every
[1:25:52] divine promise is yours right now
[1:25:54] hallelujah that's what god so your
[1:25:56] healing the salvation your freedom from
[1:25:59] sin and from selfishness and from your
[1:26:01] indifference and your little turtle
[1:26:03] shell that you pull yourself up into you
[1:26:05] know when i read that i just put it crab
[1:26:07] shell because i'm born in july you know
[1:26:09] and unfortunately that thing still is
[1:26:11] around from time to time but i've got to
[1:26:12] die out to it and get out of the shell
[1:26:14] again
[1:26:16] that's true
[1:26:17] yes help me lord so you know
[1:26:20] god wants to come in and be lord and
[1:26:23] ruler and to set you free from these
[1:26:24] things but you won't do it it's to
[1:26:26] fulfill the scriptures that they'd be
[1:26:28] lukewarm and they are now notice this is
[1:26:30] not personally to anyone just as the
[1:26:32] holy spirit will point it to you so it's
[1:26:35] not just it's to you
[1:26:37] amen
[1:26:38] but notice now it's just the word the
[1:26:40] people today they don't want to open
[1:26:41] their hearts to those things they don't
[1:26:43] want to believe it or they try to apply
[1:26:45] it somewhere else or to somebody else
[1:26:47] knowing uh knowing not that it's for you
[1:26:49] you say well wait a minute brother
[1:26:50] abraham i spoke in tongues 10 years ago
[1:26:53] that's very fine but what is christ to
[1:26:55] you today
[1:26:57] see it's great that you have experiences
[1:26:59] years ago but what about who is he to
[1:27:00] you today
[1:27:02] amen are you seeing his marvelous powers
[1:27:05] does he still bring the same thrill
[1:27:08] does something go through you when you
[1:27:11] see his mighty hand begin to move and
[1:27:12] sinners be converted does it bring you
[1:27:15] to all night prayer does it bring you to
[1:27:16] fasting does it send you to the altar
[1:27:18] quickly to work with someone to instruct
[1:27:20] them how to come through to the holy
[1:27:22] spirit does it warm your heart to go
[1:27:25] into the neighborhood and seek out the
[1:27:26] lost do you speak to the milkman to the
[1:27:29] media man to the man on the street those
[1:27:31] things that they
[1:27:32] go
[1:27:33] that they're going to accompany that
[1:27:34] experience that you received long ago
[1:27:36] something's happened and he says this
[1:27:38] you pushed him out the door but god
[1:27:40] wants your heart
[1:27:42] so have we come to a place where he
[1:27:45] still thrills us
[1:27:46] he still means more than life to us amen
[1:27:49] when we see his hand come upon someone
[1:27:51] and save them it just it just makes our
[1:27:53] world makes our weak amen that's the
[1:27:56] thing we want to see us we want but but
[1:27:58] what what motivates that love motivates
[1:28:00] that
[1:28:01] amen because we know that we've
[1:28:02] experienced the love of god and his love
[1:28:04] came upon us so we want to see the love
[1:28:07] of god expressed to someone else
[1:28:09] hallelujah so
[1:28:12] amen i trust that we can we can look
[1:28:14] into look into our own lives and say
[1:28:16] lord
[1:28:17] i'm a prisoner to you
[1:28:20] amen i am your prisoner
[1:28:22] that is not my will but thy will be done
[1:28:26] hallelujah
[1:28:28] now
[1:28:29] i'm sorry this is kind of i feel like
[1:28:31] we're having better scrambled eggs this
[1:28:33] morning
[1:28:34] but
[1:28:36] it's
[1:28:37] if we can lay aside our own ambitions
[1:28:40] and keep them aside like the impossible
[1:28:41] said i die daily so it's whatever we
[1:28:44] want we put it there and say god what do
[1:28:46] you want
[1:28:47] what do you want in my life today
[1:28:49] remember he only wants good
[1:28:51] he wants the best for us
[1:28:53] right he's not here to remember he's not
[1:28:55] an angry father that's looking for when
[1:28:58] we trip up to to to deal with us
[1:29:01] he's not that kind of a god he's a god
[1:29:03] that if we fall he wants it all he wants
[1:29:04] to do you know how you have kids and
[1:29:05] they fall over to hurt themselves all
[1:29:06] you want to do is pick them and check
[1:29:08] them over see how they are and if they
[1:29:10] need a plaster they get a plaster or
[1:29:11] they need a cold cold uh cold pack they
[1:29:14] get a call back you put them on the
[1:29:15] couch you make sure they're okay who i
[1:29:17] trust you're that kind of parents
[1:29:19] you know but you want to make sure
[1:29:20] they're fine you know you just say
[1:29:22] you'll walk it off you'll be all right
[1:29:24] but your first
[1:29:25] your first concern
[1:29:28] your first concern is are they okay
[1:29:31] and that's god to us
[1:29:34] we fall in sin something happens we fail
[1:29:36] our whatever he he wants a jig are you
[1:29:38] okay
[1:29:39] i want to pick you up i want to guide
[1:29:41] you so you can bypass this again that
[1:29:43] you don't walk back into the same thing
[1:29:44] but you keep going that's that's how he
[1:29:46] wants but you know do we love him enough
[1:29:48] to let him do it
[1:29:51] he's not an angry god he's not an angry
[1:29:52] father he's a loving father
[1:29:54] a man he's a loving god that just wants
[1:29:56] the best for us
[1:29:58] amen
[1:29:59] now i'm gonna well i'm gonna read this
[1:30:02] and then and then we're gonna probably
[1:30:04] wrap up but you know brother harold
[1:30:06] hildebrand made a statement and and um
[1:30:08] he said that you your
[1:30:10] your your life the life you live is your
[1:30:13] revelation
[1:30:15] so what your revelation is
[1:30:17] is manifested in your life
[1:30:19] so
[1:30:20] if you know the lord loves you it will
[1:30:22] be manifested in your life
[1:30:24] if you think he doesn't love you if you
[1:30:26] if you
[1:30:27] then you always be afraid of him
[1:30:29] but if you're like jesus manifested as
[1:30:31] revelation he knew he was the son of god
[1:30:33] he knew was he to take away the sins of
[1:30:35] the world he knew that though he would
[1:30:36] have to go in the grave he'd come out
[1:30:38] again
[1:30:39] right his life manifested that
[1:30:40] revelation now we're here i've probably
[1:30:42] come a very long way around to this
[1:30:44] point but we are here to fulfill
[1:30:46] scripture right we're here to fulfill a
[1:30:48] rapture we're here to fulfill that
[1:30:51] everything god is you'll pour into us
[1:30:53] that when he looks down at you and i
[1:30:54] he'll see his own character and a people
[1:30:57] we're here to fulfill that scripture but
[1:30:59] i i pray it's been revealed to you
[1:31:02] that that's what you're here for
[1:31:04] amen it's not maybe i'll get it no no
[1:31:06] you're here to fulfill that you know i
[1:31:08] remember the first um the first uh uh
[1:31:11] convention i ever went to was up in
[1:31:12] auckland and and brian got baptized
[1:31:14] there i think it's the first time every
[1:31:15] bit brother had it there and you know
[1:31:17] 2009 and brother harold was there and he
[1:31:20] preached a sermon and one of his opening
[1:31:22] scriptures was you know that that from
[1:31:24] from ephesians 1 and 5 having
[1:31:26] predestinated unto us the adoption of
[1:31:28] children by jesus christ to himself
[1:31:31] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:31:33] will so when he read that it just
[1:31:35] anchored in my heart that i've been
[1:31:37] predestinated
[1:31:39] unto the adoption we know that adoption
[1:31:41] is the placing of children by jesus
[1:31:43] christ to himself according to the good
[1:31:45] pleasure of his will so my destiny has
[1:31:47] been predetermined i'm going to come
[1:31:49] into my position in christ right that
[1:31:51] that was that was what was revealed to
[1:31:53] me and it doesn't matter what comes
[1:31:56] that's going to happen so the devil may
[1:31:58] fight there's my own self i've got to
[1:32:00] die yo this thing sort of stayed dead my
[1:32:02] own humanity remember our biggest enemy
[1:32:04] is ourselves right so all that may raise
[1:32:06] up but but god says this is where you
[1:32:08] ultimately end up
[1:32:10] hallelujah
[1:32:12] so it blessed me to realize that my
[1:32:14] destiny is predetermined that i will
[1:32:17] that because of his good pleasure
[1:32:20] i will come to my position
[1:32:22] in the body and the final part of that
[1:32:24] adoption is the change of our body
[1:32:27] because it says in romans 8 and 23 not
[1:32:29] only they but ourselves also which have
[1:32:32] the first fruits of the spirit even we
[1:32:34] ourselves grown within ourselves waiting
[1:32:36] for the adoption to wit the
[1:32:39] the redemption of our body
[1:32:41] so the whole the final process of
[1:32:43] adoption is the body change
[1:32:46] amen so now if that's been revealed
[1:32:49] that's where i'm going to end up
[1:32:51] hallelujah so
[1:32:52] now i'm just talking to myself i pray my
[1:32:54] life manifest that revelation
[1:32:58] right
[1:32:59] hallelujah so now when i say about a
[1:33:01] prisoner because remember he is he is
[1:33:04] he is um
[1:33:07] he's looking for prisoners today
[1:33:10] and he's already made us that we can be
[1:33:12] prisoners to him
[1:33:14] right so i pray that our it's actually
[1:33:16] revealed to us we are his prisoner
[1:33:18] irrespective of where you feel you are
[1:33:19] in your christian walk and how much you
[1:33:20] see your humanity no if it's revealed to
[1:33:23] you i'm a prisoner of jesus christ then
[1:33:24] the life within you will begin to
[1:33:26] manifest that revelation will begin to
[1:33:28] live out
[1:33:29] that is not my will but his will be done
[1:33:32] hallelujah
[1:33:34] and it says in ephesians one and six and
[1:33:36] and and i will finish with this to the
[1:33:38] praise of his glory of his grace when he
[1:33:40] has made us accepted in the beloved
[1:33:42] amen so how does he make us accept it by
[1:33:45] providing a perfect lamb
[1:33:47] amen and that's where i got into the
[1:33:49] story of the of the donkey being
[1:33:50] redeemed
[1:33:51] he's made us accepted in the beloved
[1:33:54] he's given and he's done that by
[1:33:56] providing a perfect lamb
[1:33:58] so remember look at your lamb
[1:34:01] and what he has done for you
[1:34:03] and then i pray when you see that
[1:34:05] remember god doesn't look at you he's
[1:34:06] looking at the lamb
[1:34:08] so you can have all kinds of troubles
[1:34:10] all kind of things going on but god is
[1:34:11] looking to the lamb and because he is
[1:34:13] accepted we are accepted
[1:34:16] amen so now we can go to and say lord
[1:34:19] i want to be your prisoner
[1:34:21] i want to be a prisoner like jesus my
[1:34:24] the lover of my soul my messiah my king
[1:34:26] as he as he subjected his own flesh to
[1:34:29] the will of
[1:34:30] god concerning his life he could subject
[1:34:33] these five senses
[1:34:34] and his spirit remember he could subject
[1:34:36] that to the will of god the word of god
[1:34:38] lord i want to be like that
[1:34:40] because i love you i just want to see
[1:34:42] your will done
[1:34:43] whatever that will is you can cast me
[1:34:45] aside i want to serve you because you've
[1:34:47] done so much for me i just want to if
[1:34:50] i'm wrong and you want me wrong i want
[1:34:52] to stay wrong because i want your will
[1:34:53] to be done that's what the prophet said
[1:34:55] amen so
[1:34:57] god's looking for prisoners in 2022.
[1:35:00] to his word
[1:35:02] by the bonds of love
[1:35:04] and faith worketh by love
[1:35:06] so if that love ever
[1:35:08] if you ever feel that love
[1:35:11] leak out of your heart
[1:35:12] say lord pour your love back into me
[1:35:15] may i serve thee because i love thee not
[1:35:17] because it's expected of me not because
[1:35:19] of some duty but because i love you
[1:35:21] and then if your faith is working by
[1:35:23] love
[1:35:24] you just see it explode and take off
[1:35:27] amen our love of god how rich and pure
[1:35:29] how measureless and strong
[1:35:31] amen let's have the musicians this
[1:35:32] morning
[1:35:34] hallelujah let's be prisoners friends
[1:35:36] maybe i'm just preaching to myself this
[1:35:38] morning i don't know
[1:35:39] but i want to be more surrendered
[1:35:42] there's more of him to have
[1:35:43] there's lots of chambers in our hearts
[1:35:45] let's just open them all
[1:35:46] whatever he wants down in our lives lord
