[30:48] amen but you know what
[30:52] we didn't let the devil win we are here
[30:56] amen let's turn our Bibles to numbers 21
[30:58] 5 we're going to go to verse 5.
[31:02] and uh
[31:04] we're gonna just start there tonight so
[31:06] we just jump straight into the word I
[31:08] pray our pastor would feel better and
[31:10] his wife I hear he was really sick and I
[31:12] know there's a lot of them that was sick
[31:13] brother Ben we're praying for you we
[31:16] hope you you get really better really
[31:18] soon it's not nice having a tummy bug
[31:20] all of us if you had one it's just not
[31:23] nice that's not nice so we just pray
[31:26] that the Lord will just um intercede
[31:28] there for them and just heal them and
[31:29] give them bring them back for Sunday so
[31:31] we can have a full house again amen but
[31:34] you see it's with two or more gathered
[31:35] so even if we were just two tonight he's
[31:37] there and sister Rachel we had a
[31:40] discussion she said oh we we're not a
[31:42] lot of people tonight we can just start
[31:44] the service next door I said amen
[31:46] because we are two or more so we are in
[31:48] the right place so um let us get into
[31:50] the work day and we start there with
[31:52] with verse number five now my total uh
[31:56] my title for tonight is the Inside Man
[32:01] Grace versus Sin so just think about
[32:03] that it's the Insight man Grace versus
[32:07] Sin there is always that battle unbelief
[32:10] and Grace so let us just jump into the
[32:12] scripture there
[32:13] it says there in verse 5 and the people
[32:16] spake against God and against Moses
[32:20] wherefore have you brought us here to
[32:22] Egypt to die in the wilderness
[32:25] for there is no breed neither is there
[32:27] any water and our soul loveth for this
[32:29] the light breed and the Lord sent fiery
[32:32] serpents among the people and they bit
[32:34] the people and the people I mean much in
[32:37] people in Israel died
[32:40] therefore the people came to Moses and
[32:42] said we have sinned for we have spoken
[32:45] against the Lord and against thee pray
[32:47] unto the Lord that he will take away the
[32:49] serpents from us and Moses prayed for
[32:51] the people
[32:54] and the Lord said unto Moses make thee a
[32:57] fiery Serpent and set it upon a pole and
[33:00] it shall come to pass that if every one
[33:02] that is bitten will look upon this or
[33:04] look upon it shall live and Moses made
[33:08] the serpent of brass which is Judgment
[33:09] it's been brought serpent has been
[33:11] judged and put it up on a pole and it
[33:14] came to pass that the serpent that had
[33:16] bitten many when he beheld if a serpent
[33:20] that had bitten any man we need beheld
[33:22] the serpent of brass he lived amen may
[33:27] the Lord add his Blessing to the word
[33:28] you can have your seats
[33:31] amen
[33:33] so I always start with this um
[33:37] how can you say I always start with this
[33:39] um
[33:39] very controversial thing is like
[33:41] something's happened and the people
[33:43] always realize Something's Happened we
[33:45] need to move back to God and you know so
[33:48] so we as humans just in our own life we
[33:51] we kind of start enjoying life too much
[33:54] you know and and we kind of start
[33:55] enjoying the world too much and we enjoy
[33:57] everything too much and when it starts
[33:59] getting a little bit hard then all of a
[34:01] sudden our Attitude Change
[34:04] and and isn't it strange that when we on
[34:06] the mountain and we're having a real
[34:07] good awesome time that we kind of forget
[34:10] about God because we don't we don't need
[34:12] him you know as a lady of sea and curse
[34:14] you know we in the age of Lady of SIA
[34:15] and the lady of SIA don't need God at
[34:17] all but see there's a time where where
[34:19] when you make a mistake and you really
[34:22] know that you're in a bad place you
[34:23] you're in a place where you're not good
[34:25] with God and you're doing things that
[34:26] God that's not pleasing to God
[34:29] that now is starting to talk to you and
[34:32] he start speaking to the Inside Man the
[34:34] inside voice
[34:36] am I too loud should I turn myself down
[34:38] you're good okay sorry because we're
[34:41] doing everything tonight so
[34:43] um what we do is now now God comes and
[34:46] he starts pulling on your heart and he
[34:48] starts putting his finger on sin
[34:51] sin is unbelief so what happened here in
[34:54] numbers is
[34:56] the Israelites they murmured against God
[34:58] and and they were not very happy and
[35:01] they kicked against the prophet of God
[35:03] and God punished them
[35:05] he sent fiery serpents amen we read the
[35:08] same Bible God seen the serpents but as
[35:11] God sends the serpents he knows that
[35:13] there will be a man that once Israel
[35:16] remembered that they were wrong with God
[35:19] and they repented because the attitude
[35:21] was the attitude of repentance that God
[35:24] will already make a way for them back to
[35:27] walk with him and it happened time and
[35:28] again with Israel it happens time and
[35:30] again with us and the whole point of
[35:32] tonight's service is it will happen with
[35:35] you but it is the attitude of the
[35:37] believer that will bring the promise of
[35:39] God to pass
[35:42] faith is important but faith is not all
[35:46] that you need it's very hard to say is
[35:49] but Faith's not all you need because
[35:50] some people will go through trials
[35:53] regardless and it's not because they
[35:56] don't have a big Measure of Faith or a
[35:57] little Measure of Faith that you're
[35:59] going for trials God is working your
[36:01] life I don't want to get ahead of myself
[36:02] so now in numbers the enemies coming
[36:06] into the camp of Israel but God now
[36:08] raises the standard
[36:10] because Sinners came in the camp
[36:11] unbelief they didn't believe while they
[36:14] were in that they did they didn't
[36:15] believe they were in the right place
[36:16] they didn't believe the coming of the
[36:17] Lord they didn't believe the promised
[36:19] land they didn't believe he was the
[36:20] prophet they started murmuring against
[36:22] the situation
[36:26] the biggest sin is is unbelief
[36:30] the attributes of sin which we spoke on
[36:32] we on Sunday about attributes of Sinners
[36:35] because you don't believe you do things
[36:37] that's not pleasing to God but the
[36:40] unbelief in your heart is the thing we
[36:42] want to address
[36:43] because that is what's going to get you
[36:45] to to overcome that trial that's going
[36:47] to push you sometimes you feel when
[36:49] you're walking it feels you can't go
[36:51] further in your walk with god it feels
[36:53] like you got to a stalemate you got
[36:55] somewhere where you're like God just
[36:57] show me more of you I need more of you I
[37:00] don't understand this this is not this
[37:02] is not something I can understand I'm
[37:03] God I've got to a stalemate I've been
[37:05] running around he has been sin in this
[37:07] world and even in this church in amongst
[37:10] I believe is sin unbelief
[37:12] and you don't know how you're going to
[37:14] get past it
[37:16] but see that's not where we stop because
[37:19] God's already made the power of the
[37:21] blood speaks volumes speaks Freedom
[37:23] speaks for every one of us but the thing
[37:24] is you have to apply it
[37:26] so it's good that Jesus Christ died on
[37:28] the cross it's good that all these
[37:30] things happen we just celebrated Easter
[37:32] but when you get to a point where God is
[37:34] busy dealing with the Inside Man and
[37:37] you've hit that wall
[37:38] and call it unbelief call it the attack
[37:40] of the enemy call it the Giant in front
[37:42] of you the David the whatever call it
[37:44] that but you've hit that what now
[37:48] because sometimes in your trial it might
[37:50] not be nice at all it might be very
[37:53] uncomfortable
[37:56] but God has made a way I want to stretch
[37:59] it as much as I can even if you don't
[38:02] believe at all
[38:04] if you're a ranked sinner if you are a
[38:08] harlot if you are a a man running around
[38:11] with other women a woman running around
[38:13] with other men even if you did
[38:15] everything wrong possibly you can God
[38:18] will still make a way to get back to him
[38:20] if you can take it
[38:23] it's up to the believer he ain't going
[38:25] to do everything for us but he's made a
[38:27] way so when Israel was already crying
[38:30] there was no atonement made for their
[38:33] sin for that day for their unbelief so
[38:35] he said to Moses raise up that broad
[38:37] serpent put it in front of them and if
[38:39] they look upon Him type of Christ
[38:42] when they look upon Him their sins shall
[38:44] be forgiven
[38:45] they will be healed so sin and healing
[38:48] goes together unbelief and healing as
[38:51] hard as it is it's in the scriptures
[38:53] it's there
[38:54] so God makes the atonement for them
[38:57] Grace takes over
[38:58] I left my phone there at the back and
[39:00] you bring my phone to the front if it's
[39:03] possible because my quotes is on there
[39:05] I was there all over the show to me
[39:09] thank you
[39:12] amen thank you
[39:16] brother Brandon picks this up yeah and
[39:18] he speaks about it
[39:21] and God's provided way buddy in in the
[39:24] the Inside Man actually
[39:26] he picks this up and it's a very
[39:28] important part and this is where it
[39:29] actually really happened he says Wendy
[39:32] was travel God has always been the god
[39:35] that made the need for the hour that
[39:38] meet these people and you know that and
[39:41] God promised that he will supply their
[39:43] needs now when they had yet they were
[39:47] did it wrong and they had sinned and
[39:49] done these things wrong yet when they
[39:51] need of healing God made the atonement
[39:54] of healing when there was no atonement
[39:57] yet
[39:58] so God raised that up so if we look at
[40:01] the typing there's not just one type if
[40:03] we go back in the Book of Genesis and we
[40:05] see in the in the um Adam and Eve
[40:08] sinning
[40:09] so they sin they they deserve to die
[40:12] because God said the moment you eat of
[40:14] that tree you will die you will die
[40:17] but see now they've done it they've been
[40:19] caught in the act both of them were
[40:21] guilty they had to die but yet God rich
[40:24] in Mercy with his grace provided a
[40:27] sacrifice and it was the blood of the
[40:29] Lamb that he sacrificed for them and
[40:32] then he wrapped them with
[40:33] the skins of the Lambs because the Fig
[40:36] Leaf religion wasn't going to work the
[40:38] leaves wasn't going to cover them Cain
[40:40] tried to offer all kinds of leaves and
[40:42] flowers and all those things and God
[40:44] rejected that because God's way was the
[40:47] blood there was only the one way
[40:49] so God already showed them the Garden of
[40:52] Eden that blood of the Lamb had to be
[40:53] for that sacrifice then he came with the
[40:55] Israelites and he raised up the brown
[40:57] serpent to say Jesus Christ is going to
[40:59] die on the cross for you if you look
[41:00] upon him and you believe you shall be
[41:02] saved you and your house
[41:04] amen but now see God needs to deal with
[41:08] us a little bit more personal because
[41:11] it's good to find it in the scriptures
[41:12] but what is God doing with you so so I
[41:14] want to bring it a bit to this artist
[41:16] let's go talk to Dr God because when
[41:19] you're sick
[41:20] and you feeling that there's something
[41:22] wrong and your your nose is blocked or
[41:25] your throat the sore and or you you have
[41:28] a tummy bug or all those things then you
[41:30] don't really know what's wrong with you
[41:31] but you know the symptoms
[41:33] is you are sick
[41:35] but sometimes we sit in this church and
[41:38] the symptoms is we are sick
[41:40] and we need healing but see if you don't
[41:42] go to God if you don't go to the doctor
[41:44] he will have to start to talk to you and
[41:48] he is speaking to you tonight to all of
[41:50] us and he's trying to tell you that
[41:52] sometimes you get to a place in your
[41:53] life where you just feel you're going
[41:55] through the motions
[41:56] and everything's just blase and
[41:58] everything's just the same and in other
[42:00] words they service another brother man
[42:03] preaching and then a brother ate
[42:04] preaching and the cycle continues and it
[42:06] feels like you just keep cycling and
[42:08] you're not receiving anything but you've
[42:10] come to a stalemate
[42:12] because God's trying to deal with you
[42:15] but see you're so busy you need to start
[42:17] talking to God because if we go now and
[42:20] and please follow me we're going to go
[42:22] there to um
[42:24] to speak to Dr God and there was this
[42:26] this woman
[42:28] at the well let's go there John 4.
[42:33] I want to show you the type where God
[42:35] starts speaking to his children
[42:37] you know because I believe the woman at
[42:40] the well
[42:42] she was looking at brother Brandon said
[42:44] as well he says she was looking for love
[42:45] in all the wrong places
[42:47] but there was something in there that
[42:49] was looking for true love
[42:52] there was one that was looking for real
[42:54] healing not just in the body but in the
[42:57] spirit
[42:58] one that was in such a state that she
[43:00] didn't know where to go
[43:01] but you know what Jesus went her way
[43:04] she didn't go to Jesus Jesus said I need
[43:07] to go by the way of Samaria he stated to
[43:10] his disciples because he knew there was
[43:12] a child that was sitting in a service
[43:14] that needed some healing where other
[43:17] things became more important and they
[43:19] realized there's something wrong here
[43:23] my channel is blocked between God and me
[43:25] I don't feel the presence of God I don't
[43:28] see him moving on myths I haven't seen a
[43:30] healing in ages is there even miracles
[43:35] come on
[43:37] don't it's I didn't this I didn't want
[43:39] to preach this it was prepared last
[43:41] night when brother being said to pray
[43:43] this is not what I wanted to preach I
[43:44] wanted wisdom versus Faith this just
[43:46] came and it all came together there is a
[43:48] reason God is speaking to us tonight
[43:50] there's a reason for it and the fact
[43:52] that that it had to happen this way you
[43:55] should see the supernatural hand of God
[43:57] wake up don't miss it
[44:00] God doesn't waste one word out of a
[44:03] mouth of one of his servants that is
[44:05] just saying hey hear some mail there is
[44:09] no I I have no bad feelings about
[44:10] anybody here I don't even know what
[44:13] anybody goes through but there is a
[44:15] burden that's telling me that somebody
[44:16] is sinning in a stalemate
[44:18] with choices to make and they they are
[44:21] in such a place that they actually
[44:22] cannot walk further with God and God's
[44:24] telling you that there was a woman at
[44:26] the well that was worse off than you
[44:30] worse off
[44:32] and you know what I went their way
[44:35] I spoke to her
[44:37] amen so we go there and we're going
[44:39] women at the well um John 14.
[44:44] and we start there at
[44:47] verse number 10. so of course he is now
[44:50] starting to speak to her and is is
[44:52] contacting a spirit because what Jesus
[44:55] does is because he's a real good doctor
[44:56] he starts talking to us
[44:58] we sit in the service and he goes
[45:01] this one is for you
[45:03] you know and you're like ah in the
[45:05] thirds a bit it's a bit close you know
[45:07] AR monk you've got unconfession
[45:10] it is it is blocking that next step
[45:12] between me and you and the preachers
[45:14] preaching it and he says about the devil
[45:17] that has entitlement to have that punch
[45:18] and you're listening to all of this and
[45:21] he's busy trying to tell you Armand I'm
[45:23] dealing with you
[45:24] are you paying attention
[45:26] and what he does with this woman at the
[45:28] well is he starts just talking to her
[45:30] like you would speak to me in you but
[45:33] the inside of that lady knew there was
[45:36] more
[45:36] so she first started with a bit of
[45:38] reasoning she started with a bit of
[45:40] gospel you know you know we again we'll
[45:44] go through it and she sees here and he
[45:46] come up to a Woman verse 7 do a summary
[45:48] and he says Jesus said unto give me a
[45:50] water to drink
[45:51] for disciples were gone away in the city
[45:54] um to buy some meat thus says the women
[45:57] of Samaria unto him how is it thou that
[46:00] being a Jew
[46:02] um asked a drink of me
[46:04] which is a woman of Samaria for the Jews
[46:07] have no dealings with the Samaritans so
[46:09] she's now starting to say hey what's
[46:11] going on here we shouldn't even be
[46:12] talking
[46:13] but see Jesus knows that is one of his
[46:16] seed
[46:17] so he goes on because he's now
[46:19] contacting her and Jesus understood to
[46:21] her if thou knowest the gift of God and
[46:25] who is that save to thee give me a drink
[46:28] of water thou would have asked of him
[46:30] and he would give the Living Water now
[46:34] he's starting to give her a little bit
[46:35] of a parable
[46:37] see this there's more behind what I'm
[46:38] telling you now so now he's starting to
[46:40] talk not just here on the surface he's
[46:43] going a little bit deeper
[46:45] and then she says the woman sayeth unto
[46:46] me sir there was nothing to draw with
[46:49] and the world is deep and will the winds
[46:51] has thou this living water
[46:53] art thou greater than our father Jacob
[46:56] see now she goes to the scripture man
[46:57] have you set in a service and the
[46:59] preacher is preaching to you and then
[47:01] you start Bible punching you in your
[47:03] head oh yeah but if he sees that then I
[47:05] can say this and you're trying to reason
[47:07] yourself out of what is God's trying to
[47:08] do don't do that just eat it do just
[47:10] take it because when you when you take
[47:13] it you can absorb it it goes It goes
[47:15] deeper than just the mind
[47:17] take the word of God let it soak in
[47:19] think about it speak to him don't just
[47:22] reject it because you think oh it's not
[47:24] for me don't even do that that's the
[47:26] wrong thing to do because if we start
[47:28] doing that we start reasoning God hasn't
[47:30] even gotten to your level yet he hasn't
[47:32] even got into your head yet he hasn't
[47:34] even had a conversation with you yet
[47:35] because the moment let's say David comes
[47:38] and speak to you and he grabs the sand
[47:40] and says Hey brother man how are you
[47:41] doing and go there you go you're doing
[47:42] David good how was your day no it was
[47:43] all right yeah and I walk away
[47:46] no matter what he says after that it
[47:49] doesn't matter I lost interest
[47:51] but see if you just stay in there and
[47:53] you just keep pulling and say okay Lord
[47:54] what am I missing what am I missing you
[47:56] know the pastor's speaking about
[47:57] something maybe a worldliness maybe
[47:59] whatever I'm talking about he's actually
[48:01] speaking to me then start drawing start
[48:04] drawing it out of him let him give you
[48:06] that answer because he wants to don't
[48:08] reject it and this woman is now starting
[48:10] to talk back to him and say oh you know
[48:12] the the the the scripture sees this and
[48:14] thou are great that this well is Jacob's
[48:16] Well and
[48:17] um but Jesus stops right there and the
[48:20] children and all his cattle and Jesus
[48:22] answered to her and says whosoever drink
[48:24] of the water shall thirst again but
[48:26] whosoever drink of the water that I
[48:28] shall give shall never thirst but the
[48:30] water that I shall give them in in him a
[48:33] well of water springing unto everlasting
[48:36] life
[48:37] okay so now I just need to stable my
[48:39] notes because I'll really lived a little
[48:41] bit so it's the same as when now he's
[48:43] asking he's asking for um
[48:48] revealing to you what is sin so he's
[48:51] actually talking to her and oh we need
[48:53] to go to verse 15. so let's read on he
[48:55] says and the woman sayeth unto him sir
[48:57] give me this water that I thirst not
[48:59] neither come he that to draw
[49:02] so and then of course Jesus now sees
[49:05] there's a little bit more to it so he's
[49:07] going to now just pierce the soul and he
[49:09] says go call your husband
[49:11] he said go call your husband
[49:13] and all of a sudden it becomes real
[49:17] so the ritual ruler had the same
[49:19] argument he came to Jesus Lord what do I
[49:22] do to get eternal life I've kept all the
[49:24] Commandments he goes yeah okay sell your
[49:26] stuff and just follow me wasn't a hard
[49:28] thing to do like if you really think
[49:30] about it he knows what is in here
[49:34] so oh you know I say okay you know on
[49:37] the Wednesday night service all I want
[49:38] you to do is just put this down for a
[49:40] while
[49:41] read a bit more your Bible spend more
[49:43] time with me you know when I when I'm in
[49:45] the world and and I start dealing with
[49:48] people in the world which we do because
[49:49] that's what we do we we are the light of
[49:52] this world we are the one that has to
[49:53] deal with it
[49:55] Heinz would know there's a lot of sick
[49:57] out there her brothers if you think
[49:59] about it a lot of hurt but it affects
[50:02] you but if you concentrate on only that
[50:05] it will affect you and it will show up
[50:08] in your life and you will get complexes
[50:09] and you'll get hurt and you'll get
[50:11] pulled left and right on all over the
[50:12] show but if you keep your eyes on Jesus
[50:14] and keep on listening to him let him
[50:17] talk behind the lines to you let him
[50:19] Minister unto you
[50:21] you know I'm sitting here and oh it's
[50:22] just boring and it's all it's fine but
[50:24] let him talk to you just eat a bit of
[50:27] food you had the whole week you can
[50:29] spend time wherever you want to just
[50:31] choose to spend it here you're really
[50:33] wondering because at least yeah you can
[50:35] get some Mana you can get some real food
[50:37] and and they can be a scripture that
[50:39] you've always been struggling with and
[50:41] bumping your head and bumping in and why
[50:43] am I not yielding why do I not feel
[50:45] saved and when do I get the Holy Ghost
[50:47] and all these difficult questions can be
[50:49] answered right here
[50:52] amen so the woman of the of the well sin
[50:55] is now coming to the surface because now
[50:58] what happened is he now contacted the
[51:00] the Inner Man the the real her inside
[51:04] and he says to her because he's the the
[51:06] surner of the thoughts and the teeth of
[51:08] the heart and he says to her in your
[51:10] heart I know you're looking for love
[51:12] but I just want to quickly call you out
[51:13] where are you looking for love
[51:16] so go call your husband
[51:19] where are you spending your time
[51:22] what are you looking for out there
[51:25] what are you going to get in the world
[51:27] just another husband how many do you
[51:29] have I've got five
[51:32] yeah you've got five
[51:33] you got YouTube you got Twitter you can
[51:36] man I'm gonna always preach against
[51:37] these things because I hate it I think
[51:38] it's from the devil you got YouTube you
[51:40] got Twitter you got Snapchat you've got
[51:43] all the other things out there I don't
[51:45] even know what is there and all it is it
[51:48] is husbands that you're with because you
[51:49] don't know where you're looking for your
[51:50] love
[51:52] and children guess what I only preach to
[51:54] you I preach to your parents as well and
[51:56] I preach to myself as well because we
[51:58] find ourselves going after every other
[52:00] husband to get a feeling inside our
[52:02] heart that we felt good about something
[52:04] that day
[52:05] so it's addictive so I get in there and
[52:08] I start Twitter and YouTube and all of a
[52:10] sudden YouTube short short shorts long
[52:12] long extra long very long massively long
[52:15] and then after a while two and a half
[52:16] hours on shorts that wasn't short
[52:20] but I've been with someone else
[52:22] come on I've been with someone else
[52:26] but see Jesus comes your way and he says
[52:28] but I can give you more than that
[52:29] because when you look at these things
[52:31] they feed something there's a white dog
[52:33] and a black dog they feed it whether you
[52:36] know it or not this lady was looking for
[52:38] real love and she had five husbands and
[52:40] Jesus called her out on it and then she
[52:43] went you know what this is the heart of
[52:45] a believer
[52:46] lord it's true I've got five husbands
[52:49] I'm not in the right place
[52:52] and he guessed oh I love that
[52:54] he says okay let's go on man I love it
[52:58] this I just get
[53:02] she says I perceive that you are a
[53:04] prophet
[53:06] because when Messiah comes he will do
[53:08] these things and he says to her yeah in
[53:10] verse 27 he says and upon this came his
[53:13] disciples and and now listen to this
[53:16] woman he says but the hour come he talks
[53:18] to her he says I am the Messiah but here
[53:19] this is what she does now she goes into
[53:21] action Grace actually comes right in
[53:24] right here and he says to her and upon
[53:27] this came his disciples in Marvel that
[53:29] he talked to this woman
[53:31] yet no man said anything you know or or
[53:34] or
[53:35] um why talk yourself to them and the
[53:37] woman left her water pot so she jumps
[53:39] into action
[53:40] and she went away into the city say of
[53:42] hey there's a man come and see a man
[53:44] which told me all the things that I ever
[53:46] done isn't this the Christ
[53:48] because she knew he was addressing
[53:51] something that was really wrong in here
[53:54] and she says you know what I'll leave
[53:55] this all down this is Messiah there's
[53:57] something else going on there and she
[53:58] goes in the city and she starts
[53:59] dystifying now I want you to tell this
[54:01] is such a type of our church if you
[54:03] really think about it
[54:04] this is such a type of our church
[54:08] okay and I'm not saying with the Harlot
[54:10] follow me
[54:11] she's now standing for a nation she's
[54:16] standing for a town she's standing for
[54:18] Samaria because now she goes into that
[54:20] town and she goes preach the gospel
[54:23] because she actually says to them or not
[54:25] preach the gospel she's a testimony
[54:26] remember share your candle girl she goes
[54:29] and she says come see a man there's a
[54:31] man that just told me everything I've
[54:33] done I couldn't hide it from him
[54:35] and I'm free now
[54:37] it's done because he spoke to me I heard
[54:40] his voice it was the voice behind the
[54:41] voice and then these men come out and
[54:44] they come and sit there by Jesus and
[54:46] they start listening to him and if you
[54:48] go down it says in verse 39 and many of
[54:50] the Samaritans of that City believe for
[54:53] him and um
[54:55] for the saying of the woman which
[54:57] testified
[54:59] he told me all the things I ever did so
[55:01] when the Samaritans will come down unto
[55:04] him they besought him
[55:06] um that he would tarry with him now they
[55:09] came because they saw something else
[55:10] happen in this lady's life remember she
[55:12] was a harlot so you just five seconds
[55:14] ago in the service that everything wrong
[55:16] now God comes and ministers to you and
[55:19] he says I can change it for you my child
[55:20] and you accept it because you're humble
[55:22] you can face it don't hold unconfessed
[55:25] sin the devil holds that ticket in his
[55:28] hand till the day of your judgment if
[55:30] there is any sin between you and God get
[55:31] rid of it it is it is it is absolutely
[55:35] of the devil if you have anything that
[55:37] you think if I would tell someone about
[55:39] it
[55:40] it will break my relationship rather
[55:42] break the relationship with them then
[55:44] break your relationship with God
[55:46] because the devil has this card and he
[55:49] is entitled to play it at the day of
[55:51] judgment because if you haven't placed
[55:53] it under the blood it's not under the
[55:55] blood and you cannot place it under the
[55:58] blood until you bring it to the surface
[56:01] and it surfaces up and God can deal with
[56:03] it and then he can apply the blood
[56:05] because then he can make a way through
[56:06] you but if you hold it he cannot make a
[56:09] way
[56:10] he cannot
[56:12] so if you hold unconfaced sin the devil
[56:15] has the card in his hand
[56:17] and trust me the hardest thing for you
[56:19] to do is to confess it
[56:22] and to say I'm sorry
[56:24] but guess what after that you're free
[56:27] because now God can take the atonement
[56:30] that he did on the cross the blood of
[56:32] Jesus Christ can come and cleans that
[56:34] and it's radon red it's scarlet and
[56:36] blood mixed and it's all white and God
[56:38] looks upon the sinner now and he sees a
[56:40] saint
[56:41] because God has made the atonement God
[56:44] has made the way back we make it too
[56:46] hard because we get in the way
[56:49] but it's done
[56:50] it is actually done
[56:53] so now this lady she she she's there at
[56:56] the Samaritans and yes Shekinah and I'm
[56:58] going to call it Shekinah because I just
[56:59] feel late to do it and many whom believe
[57:02] because of
[57:04] um of his own words so to believe the
[57:06] word of Jesus
[57:08] and said unto the woman now we believe
[57:11] not because of thy saying for we have
[57:13] heard him ourselves
[57:15] and know that this is indeed the Christ
[57:18] the savior of the world so it went from
[57:20] the woman's testimony
[57:23] to hearing himself what brought you to
[57:26] church
[57:29] someone's testimony what brought me into
[57:31] Shekinah Brother Andy and sister Bronwyn
[57:33] wentystifying
[57:35] brother being testifying you know all
[57:38] the Believers come up I remember that we
[57:40] had a we had a jubilee Steed season
[57:42] sister Shannon was so beautiful just
[57:44] when we were just a little couple of
[57:45] people not saying we're not having it
[57:46] again but I want you to Street something
[57:48] we came to church
[57:50] and we were like 15 20 people okay Max
[57:55] Max like now just a little bit and the
[57:59] sister will raise up and sell glory to
[58:01] God this happened today I just want to
[58:03] share it and sister Vanessa will stand
[58:04] up and say I was walking past the bus
[58:06] stop and the lady stopped me and I
[58:07] started talking to her about God and I
[58:09] just felt the presence of God and she
[58:11] just left that up and I gave her a book
[58:12] and praise the Lord there's something
[58:14] happening and they just kept duck and
[58:16] things were so personal so nice because
[58:17] they see their testimony but then we
[58:20] come and sit here because we see God
[58:22] living in time
[58:24] in time
[58:25] he's now the now God he's not the
[58:27] tomorrow God or yes it's the now God
[58:30] and then he's put him in time and we say
[58:32] hey and someone will raise him and say
[58:33] hey my son was sick but he's now healed
[58:36] and brother Bean comes and stands up and
[58:37] say oh and the Lisa's tongue was tired
[58:39] and the doctor was going to cut and all
[58:40] of a sudden a trip it went up and the
[58:42] blood was out and it was fixed and
[58:43] praise God because we didn't want it to
[58:45] go through it and and it builds faith
[58:48] but now we're not hearing being speaking
[58:51] we're hearing God speaking because he's
[58:54] busy telling us children there is a
[58:56] better way you don't get distracted
[58:58] about all these things there's more
[59:00] happening in this place here and now
[59:02] then whatever happened out there because
[59:05] it has to be shall showed to us here
[59:07] first before it happens there
[59:11] amen I went so way off my notes today
[59:13] but amen praise the Lord I get so so
[59:17] happy about the Lord eh okay let's go
[59:20] Divine influence and the reflection of
[59:22] divine influence the Divine so Grace
[59:25] brother Ben always says it's the the
[59:28] influence upon the heart and the
[59:29] reflection in the Life there must be a
[59:32] reflection so you cannot be saved by
[59:35] your works
[59:36] impossible
[59:38] okay you can't be saved by your works if
[59:40] you do that why did Jesus die for us on
[59:42] the cross done so number one you cannot
[59:45] get yourself out of any situation no
[59:48] matter how easy it seems no matter how
[59:50] hard it seems it takes the master to
[59:53] come and take you out there so her sense
[59:55] was revealed to her
[59:57] and she brought the rest of the sitting
[59:58] into the kingdom because now remember
[1:00:00] what happened after that Philip went
[1:00:04] back there to go and preach
[1:00:05] so they heard Jesus now Jesus nowhere in
[1:00:08] the scriptures says he did miracles in
[1:00:10] Samaria
[1:00:11] he did no Miracles there
[1:00:13] didn't say it in the scriptures Philip
[1:00:16] went back and Jesus preached to them and
[1:00:18] the lady started the testimony service
[1:00:20] Jesus preached to them and he walked to
[1:00:22] a left he left them his word
[1:00:26] and now Philip goes back and Philip goes
[1:00:29] preach because the atonement has now
[1:00:31] been made the Holy Ghost Jesus died on
[1:00:33] the cross the atonement has now been
[1:00:35] made now Philip goes back to the same
[1:00:37] city and now he preaches Christ
[1:00:40] and the whole city repents and comes to
[1:00:42] God and signs and miracles and
[1:00:44] everything happens but see it couldn't
[1:00:46] happen when Jesus was there even if God
[1:00:48] himself was there he said this is not
[1:00:50] the time so you might think that this is
[1:00:52] not the time but I'm telling you there
[1:00:54] is a preaching coming and some seeds
[1:00:56] coming and signs and miracles will
[1:00:58] follow them and you will be birthed into
[1:01:00] the kingdom of God because if God has
[1:01:03] started the work he will finish the work
[1:01:05] amen
[1:01:09] near Liam Stein
[1:01:12] amen
[1:01:14] sorry I get so excited I lost all my
[1:01:16] notes there
[1:01:18] okay now we're going to preach so
[1:01:23] it's any sin to be for God
[1:01:27] so what is it about
[1:01:29] what does God love so much about you in
[1:01:32] this building tonight
[1:01:35] please tell me anybody has it what does
[1:01:37] God love about you he's the lover of
[1:01:40] your
[1:01:41] because it belongs to
[1:01:45] so you have a soul you have an inside
[1:01:47] man
[1:01:49] but what you feed on it it it there's a
[1:01:53] body so so Body Spirit Soul okay
[1:01:56] Soul birthed into the kingdom filled
[1:01:59] with the Holy Ghost you're done okay you
[1:02:01] are sealed away into the kingdom unless
[1:02:03] you grieve the Holy Ghost but see there
[1:02:05] is still a battle between the spirit
[1:02:07] and the body
[1:02:09] so that's Spirit you ain't want to go
[1:02:12] out you without a fight because that one
[1:02:13] was born in sin
[1:02:15] and God deals with a spirit man
[1:02:18] because the spirit if you feel depressed
[1:02:20] what's making you feel depressed
[1:02:24] not your soul
[1:02:26] you can be a saved and as happy as a
[1:02:28] daffodil
[1:02:30] but if your spirit
[1:02:32] is hurt and bruised it comes out onto
[1:02:36] your body and it actually affects your
[1:02:38] body
[1:02:40] conscience reasoning
[1:02:42] okay so just think about it it actually
[1:02:45] your soul needs some healing too
[1:02:48] and our heal Spirit sorry your spirit
[1:02:51] needs healing too because you could be
[1:02:54] hurt on your spirit really badly and you
[1:02:58] could put a wall right up on that hurt
[1:02:59] and anybody that ever comes close and
[1:03:01] Brother Andy priest that subconscious
[1:03:02] series uh if I don't know if ever you
[1:03:05] watched it your brain is so fast that
[1:03:07] before you even can think about it your
[1:03:10] body will react to that hurt
[1:03:12] so an example is this this is a hot oven
[1:03:15] okay very hot plate I touch it
[1:03:19] it burns my hand
[1:03:21] okay so I pull it away burn my hand real
[1:03:24] bad through the greens Burns four five
[1:03:26] six seven degrees doesn't matter 150
[1:03:28] degrees burns doesn't matter but you
[1:03:30] really burned yourself
[1:03:31] the next time you come to that plate and
[1:03:33] your hand goes close to that and you
[1:03:35] feel the heat before you feel the plate
[1:03:37] what does your body do hey that thing's
[1:03:39] hot
[1:03:40] your brain didn't do that
[1:03:43] the the spirit God heard this the the
[1:03:45] body is now reacting to a pastor it's
[1:03:48] the same as when you say something bad
[1:03:49] or when people talk bad about each other
[1:03:51] gossip those demons that's in the church
[1:03:53] every church has them you know because
[1:03:55] they come to share for you a nice story
[1:03:57] but actually all they want to do is
[1:03:58] Gossip
[1:04:03] because that's all they want to do is
[1:04:05] they gossip
[1:04:06] okay it's an evil spirit
[1:04:08] it's bad it doesn't belong in the house
[1:04:10] of God
[1:04:11] Envy doesn't belong here guess what
[1:04:14] nothing that you have belongs to you
[1:04:16] anyways you come with nothing you leave
[1:04:18] with nothing so there's no point looking
[1:04:20] at your neighbor's fancy car because
[1:04:22] guess what he doesn't own it either
[1:04:25] laughs
[1:04:27] serious oh you know brother Cuban he
[1:04:30] always has the nicest suits and thighs
[1:04:31] yeah it's fine when he has a body to
[1:04:32] change will he be in that suit and I
[1:04:34] he'll wear the same white robe as me
[1:04:36] but though if he looks here and he comes
[1:04:39] in he looks the flashes in it and I
[1:04:41] respect him for it and I say Lord thank
[1:04:44] you for sending a man like that see
[1:04:45] because look I look at the blessing
[1:04:48] I don't look at the man because if you
[1:04:51] look at the man you'll always be
[1:04:52] disappointed but when you look inside of
[1:04:55] the man and you see the inside man now
[1:04:57] you're looking like God's looking at us
[1:04:58] now here and we go to second Samuel 12.
[1:05:02] we're not going to go we're just going
[1:05:03] to paraphrase because I don't want to
[1:05:04] take too long David
[1:05:07] kills Uriah who knows the story
[1:05:11] he has a passion he has a he has a
[1:05:14] little bit of a a David moment okay man
[1:05:17] of God anointed king
[1:05:20] now do you believe God could have given
[1:05:22] him Bathsheba
[1:05:25] if it wasn't God's will which it was and
[1:05:28] I'll tell you now why because Solomon
[1:05:30] was going to come through that lineage
[1:05:32] Solomon was came from Bathsheba and
[1:05:35] Solomon had to go build the temple so
[1:05:36] God already had a plan how it's going to
[1:05:38] pan out but then David jumped the gun
[1:05:43] because he looked at her and he desired
[1:05:46] her and he gave into his Passions
[1:05:50] and he was completely wrong and out of
[1:05:53] the will of God though it wasn't God's
[1:05:55] permissive will it wasn't in God's
[1:05:57] perfect will because know that same
[1:05:59] David and abhishai was walking and going
[1:06:02] to kill Saul correct and they get Saul
[1:06:05] in the cave and ambushar gets him and
[1:06:07] Saul's sleeping and he's like sleeping
[1:06:09] out like a rock like gone
[1:06:13] I'm going to spear this through him and
[1:06:16] I'll bury him in the ground that's how
[1:06:18] all I'm going to spear him I'll finish
[1:06:20] it now
[1:06:21] and and David sees to advertise his do
[1:06:25] you not touch God's anointed one do you
[1:06:27] not think that God can raise him up and
[1:06:29] bring can take him off the scene he
[1:06:31] brings Kings and takes Kings away leave
[1:06:33] God's anointed so he knew that God could
[1:06:36] do it he knew that God can send
[1:06:39] Bathsheba if he wanted it for him if it
[1:06:41] was his heart's desire he had 500 wives
[1:06:43] why does he want another one but he's he
[1:06:46] gave into a moment of weakness and he
[1:06:48] sinned because of unbelief because if he
[1:06:52] really believed what he just said to
[1:06:53] Abisha he could have just said God can
[1:06:55] give me Bathsheba
[1:06:57] because I like her and I want her
[1:06:59] and if it was all in God's will God
[1:07:01] would have led Uriah go to battle and
[1:07:02] Uriah would have died and everything
[1:07:04] would have been on God's time not
[1:07:06] David's time so see David got out of the
[1:07:09] will of God but God already made a way
[1:07:11] back so he sends a prophet to him
[1:07:14] who remembers of the children what was
[1:07:17] the prophet's name
[1:07:20] that's it so Nathan goes and he
[1:07:24] says King David
[1:07:26] oh great King live forever
[1:07:28] says God sent me I need to talk to you
[1:07:30] no I'm just paraphrasing because I want
[1:07:32] the kids to not fall asleep and get
[1:07:34] distracted
[1:07:35] pay attention because this will happen
[1:07:37] and I mean in a nice way
[1:07:39] God sends a brother to your door
[1:07:43] who can I use to go brother Jimmy how's
[1:07:46] it going
[1:07:47] God sent me
[1:07:50] there's something on my heart I want to
[1:07:52] tell you
[1:07:53] I've got a parable for you
[1:07:56] now
[1:07:57] I want you to realize that God sometimes
[1:08:00] speak in Parables to all of us here in
[1:08:02] church the preaching will go and the
[1:08:04] preaching will go but in between those
[1:08:06] lines God's starting to pluck those hot
[1:08:09] strings
[1:08:10] because Jesus spoke in Parables and the
[1:08:13] reason he spoke in Parables because The
[1:08:15] Parables was for the elected
[1:08:18] The Parables wasn't for the Pharisees
[1:08:20] and The Saturdays though they perceived
[1:08:22] God spoke about them
[1:08:24] they weren't very sure if it was them or
[1:08:26] not and they got really angry and they
[1:08:27] want to kill him but only the elected
[1:08:30] knew oh God saying something yeah I need
[1:08:32] to I need to pay attention now so God's
[1:08:35] not always going to tell you exactly
[1:08:36] what your sin is to the point you need
[1:08:39] to do a bit of homework you need to do a
[1:08:41] bit of dialect with God you need to talk
[1:08:44] back to the master and say hey I'm
[1:08:45] actually in this state
[1:08:47] it's not a one-way conversation or else
[1:08:49] we would all be robots and sitting in
[1:08:51] this church just like this and will come
[1:08:53] and God will download some info and
[1:08:55] we'll go praise God and he will move out
[1:08:57] and will overcome because it's easy it's
[1:08:59] not easy
[1:09:01] but see what we do is when we feed the
[1:09:03] black dog the black dog wins
[1:09:06] because if you put and I'm going to go
[1:09:08] back to David now but if you keep
[1:09:10] putting filth in they cannot be clean
[1:09:12] water come out it's impossible
[1:09:15] impossible
[1:09:19] again
[1:09:20] I would say this world has so much filth
[1:09:23] in it we are
[1:09:25] over our head in it
[1:09:27] so how much not more to tighten the belt
[1:09:30] right now
[1:09:31] tighten them up real quick
[1:09:34] because God has made a way tonight God
[1:09:36] has made a way tonight
[1:09:38] he's already made on Calvary but he's
[1:09:40] coming again and he's saying listen we
[1:09:42] can get rid of this sin
[1:09:45] anything that is blocking your walk with
[1:09:48] me hindering your healing hindering
[1:09:51] everything that is between me and you we
[1:09:53] can get rid of it right now we just need
[1:09:55] to change the atmosphere a bit we just
[1:09:58] need to have a little bit of a
[1:09:59] discussion of course Nathan is now
[1:10:01] talking to David and he says to David
[1:10:04] there was a man that had a lot of sheep
[1:10:07] and he had a guy come in to come and
[1:10:09] visit him
[1:10:10] and then he took his neighbor sheet but
[1:10:12] this sheep was a special sheep
[1:10:14] he loved the Sheep he cared for the
[1:10:17] Sheep he fed the Sheep off the table he
[1:10:19] did everything for the ship it was his
[1:10:21] own sheep
[1:10:23] he loved it so much and he grabbed that
[1:10:25] sheep and he killed it and he gave it to
[1:10:27] the family to this man visiting him and
[1:10:29] gave it gets angry
[1:10:31] and David now speaks judgment
[1:10:35] he says that man should be killed
[1:10:38] amen
[1:10:40] but see God
[1:10:42] knows how to speak with David
[1:10:45] and I'm gonna go here
[1:10:47] and God speaks judgment
[1:10:49] oh David speaks judgment
[1:10:52] and brother Brandon picks it up here and
[1:10:53] he says that old prophet
[1:10:56] them eyes narrowed down say David surely
[1:11:00] you shall not die
[1:11:03] because he knew
[1:11:05] why God sent him
[1:11:06] and he says watch Grace go to work right
[1:11:09] here quick
[1:11:11] and the spirit struck that prophet in
[1:11:13] David's life Grace surely you will not
[1:11:16] die but by the sword you will live in
[1:11:18] your house
[1:11:20] um and by but the sword will not leave
[1:11:23] your house till you thoroughly perched
[1:11:25] your heart
[1:11:27] for you are a rich man
[1:11:30] oh it was different then wasn't it
[1:11:32] what saved David
[1:11:34] when his own judgment said he will die
[1:11:38] he'll pay the uttermost price
[1:11:41] but the prophet said surely Grace you
[1:11:44] will not die he will not die David Grace
[1:11:47] to save you it is Grace to David it
[1:11:49] saved him oh my
[1:11:52] so sometimes we quick off the handle and
[1:11:54] if you live by the sword you die by the
[1:11:56] sword
[1:11:57] but God sends people in time to say hold
[1:12:00] on
[1:12:01] I've got a better way
[1:12:03] I got a much better way
[1:12:06] but see what happens now and I'll tell
[1:12:08] you what what is the end of it and what
[1:12:10] happens now is David repents
[1:12:13] because he realizes he's done something
[1:12:15] wrong and he's got such a heart for God
[1:12:17] that he said you know what Lord
[1:12:20] I've done it wrong try me one more time
[1:12:23] but see God still says your son's gonna
[1:12:26] die
[1:12:29] it's hard
[1:12:30] but you still reap what you sow
[1:12:33] so God gives Grace but God then turns a
[1:12:36] blind eye to sin
[1:12:39] so when God is addressing sin and he's
[1:12:41] talking to you and he's saying hey can
[1:12:43] we get everything between me and you
[1:12:45] cleared so I can actually come and dwell
[1:12:47] within you because God will not dwell in
[1:12:49] a vessel that is filthy
[1:12:52] God will not come to a person that
[1:12:54] doesn't receive or can repent that's
[1:12:56] hard and callous and just kicks him away
[1:12:58] every time he says come it's time come
[1:13:00] he'll only call that many times
[1:13:03] you'll only call that many times before
[1:13:06] you overstep Grace
[1:13:08] now I'm not trying to make it an emotion
[1:13:10] I'm really honest God said to me the one
[1:13:13] day you shall go and do this now and I'm
[1:13:15] not going to say what the story was we
[1:13:17] all know a bit of the testimony
[1:13:19] and I firmly believe in my whole heart
[1:13:21] if I didn't do that I would have ripped
[1:13:24] consequences to what I was sowing
[1:13:27] but praise the Lord when he talked to me
[1:13:29] I said you know what Lord I'll just go
[1:13:31] and do it anyways but I hope you've got
[1:13:33] this one because if it goes wrong
[1:13:37] it's over for me
[1:13:38] no I don't want to kill myself it's over
[1:13:40] for me
[1:13:41] there's so many consequences but see
[1:13:44] rather face those consequences than have
[1:13:46] something between you and God
[1:13:50] don't disappoint God start with him no
[1:13:53] matter what you need to strike off the
[1:13:55] The Ballad or or whatever is is so
[1:13:58] easily the sins that easily beset us
[1:14:00] that that encourages unbelief that that
[1:14:03] just grabs your time away from God
[1:14:05] instead of having that just clear it off
[1:14:08] let God Strike It Off
[1:14:10] just open the channels just say be a for
[1:14:13] real Christian and say you know what I
[1:14:15] am wrong
[1:14:17] I am spending too much time on this I am
[1:14:20] doing this wrong knowingly Doing It
[1:14:22] Wrong David knew what he was doing
[1:14:25] he knew 100 what he was doing but see
[1:14:27] now he repents
[1:14:29] and God says okay you're still going to
[1:14:31] reap what you sowed you're still going
[1:14:33] to get the sword won't leave your house
[1:14:34] your son will die and after his son died
[1:14:37] the Bible said he worshiped God
[1:14:40] because he knew that God was still good
[1:14:42] to him then God restores him back in the
[1:14:44] Kingdom later on after menier trials but
[1:14:47] see now Solomon was different
[1:14:49] Solomon when God told him don't walk
[1:14:52] after the gods of your your wives
[1:14:55] Solomon didn't repent
[1:14:57] and he says because I will take your
[1:14:59] house out of your hand and I will give
[1:15:01] it to you a lesser one
[1:15:04] but Solomon didn't repent Solomon didn't
[1:15:06] have a soft art he says but I won't do
[1:15:09] it to you Solomon I will do it to your
[1:15:11] son because I reverence my servant David
[1:15:16] because David's goodness and his heart
[1:15:19] and the and the connection between him
[1:15:21] and God were so soft and he was so
[1:15:23] pliable that even when he sinned God
[1:15:25] made a way for him he took that way
[1:15:26] straight away he didn't think twice
[1:15:29] but Solomon was lifted up in Pride and
[1:15:32] he had all the wisdom and he was having
[1:15:34] a massive body
[1:15:35] and God said you know what because I
[1:15:38] love David I will not take it out of
[1:15:40] your hands but your son is going to pay
[1:15:42] that price
[1:15:44] so sometimes you sin as a parent
[1:15:47] and you do something wrong and it goes
[1:15:49] to your children because that's how sin
[1:15:51] goes through the lineage because brother
[1:15:53] Branham City at the beginning that sin
[1:15:55] will visit you in you'll learn his foot
[1:15:57] the third to the fourth generation
[1:15:59] and sometimes you are the third or
[1:16:02] fourth generation and your battle has
[1:16:04] been hard and you don't understand why
[1:16:06] all these things happen you don't even
[1:16:08] know what your dad or your mom did back
[1:16:09] then but go talk to God because the
[1:16:12] blood is stronger than any demon Force
[1:16:17] though there is consequences in your
[1:16:19] reaping you don't understand why it's
[1:16:21] going so bad with you or why your
[1:16:22] situations should die and you never have
[1:16:24] money or you can't get over this or
[1:16:26] you're still struggling with the lust
[1:16:27] spirit and all those type of things that
[1:16:29] sin that comes from your family down
[1:16:32] but the blood of Jesus Christ can cut
[1:16:35] right through it because the atonement
[1:16:37] has been made a way back to God has been
[1:16:40] made you just need to accept it but if
[1:16:43] you can humble yourself and go before
[1:16:45] God God is rich in Mercy and he will
[1:16:48] forgive you your sins and he will strike
[1:16:50] it off and you can walk with God and
[1:16:52] then you'll start seeing like Samaria
[1:16:54] Miracles happening in your midst when
[1:16:56] the preaching happens now you start
[1:16:59] seeing a whole town a whole city come
[1:17:01] together and wonders and miracles and
[1:17:04] signs and all these things Wonder and
[1:17:05] prophetic visions and and all these
[1:17:08] things starts being restored because the
[1:17:10] whole church is now in unison with God
[1:17:12] Walking with God
[1:17:14] same playing field nothing Aiken sent
[1:17:18] once
[1:17:19] hit it once and it crippled men and it
[1:17:22] killed me and they had to destroy to
[1:17:24] move on S as you know and this is the
[1:17:27] thing I don't like about the nominations
[1:17:29] from today they make God a they
[1:17:32] make him a granddad
[1:17:34] you can do what you want God just says
[1:17:36] it's over and it's over it doesn't work
[1:17:38] like that
[1:17:39] the Bible says you reap what you sow
[1:17:42] in the Old Testament and in the New
[1:17:44] Testament
[1:17:45] so if you're doing something wrong if
[1:17:47] God is telling you to do something wrong
[1:17:49] all right and you willingly do it the
[1:17:51] other way because of Pride or your way
[1:17:54] of thinking about it why don't you stop
[1:17:56] it right there and say okay Lord I don't
[1:17:58] understand
[1:17:59] just show me
[1:18:01] I promise you the Living God that I know
[1:18:04] and serve and you know and serve will
[1:18:07] show you
[1:18:09] and then you apply the blood because now
[1:18:11] you actually can apply the blood because
[1:18:14] now you're on speaking terms with God
[1:18:16] and now you can overcome and it is easy
[1:18:18] to put the phone down and it is easy to
[1:18:21] take your word and when you're sitting
[1:18:22] for five minutes to start reading and
[1:18:24] it's easy to go you know what Brother
[1:18:26] David so sorry I offended you the other
[1:18:28] day I didn't mean to hey and he goes
[1:18:30] yeah I can't even remember what you did
[1:18:32] that's all right praise you because my
[1:18:34] heart is now humble there's no guile in
[1:18:36] me anymore because everything is cleared
[1:18:39] off the blood has struck it off
[1:18:41] nobody can take that out of the blood
[1:18:43] and they shouldn't
[1:18:45] because that will be attributed to them
[1:18:47] so tonight I don't want to end on that
[1:18:49] bombshell but I really wanted to say
[1:18:51] that God has made a way and the whole
[1:18:55] point of Easter is he made The Way Way
[1:18:58] Back 2023 years ago the way is made but
[1:19:02] the battle today is can we get humble
[1:19:04] enough to realize when God is tucking on
[1:19:07] our hearts to say make it right and can
[1:19:09] we get on our knees and can we strike it
[1:19:11] off between us and him so that he can
[1:19:13] apply the blood do not whatever you do
[1:19:16] hold on to sin
[1:19:19] don't do it it's the biggest mistake you
[1:19:21] can make clean that off
[1:19:23] no matter how much you hurt that person
[1:19:25] you don't don't go and say it like
[1:19:28] but go in humbleness pray before you go
[1:19:30] to that person if you've done something
[1:19:32] wrong towards them or even towards
[1:19:34] yourself remember we're our biggest
[1:19:35] enemy go before God and strike that off
[1:19:40] orowski SWAT day of judgment Satan comes
[1:19:44] running and goes oh oh I got another
[1:19:46] remember this you didn't repent of this
[1:19:47] I still have this oh and there's another
[1:19:49] one for you and another one because
[1:19:51] that's all he wants to do he hates the
[1:19:52] Sons and Daughters of God he wants to
[1:19:55] have that card to use against you that's
[1:19:58] his job
[1:19:59] but all you have to do is say Lord
[1:20:02] I've done it forgive me and he goes boom
[1:20:04] gone
[1:20:05] now he comes the end he stands in front
[1:20:07] of the Throne of God and goes oh dear
[1:20:09] brother Isaac sorry bro I've got nothing
[1:20:12] for you
[1:20:14] he's washed clean
[1:20:17] and Isaac goes yeah put it under the
[1:20:19] blood it's done
[1:20:22] amen
[1:20:23] and that's my service for tonight I
[1:20:25] didn't have a long windy one I thought
[1:20:27] this is um just how I how the Lord LED
[1:20:31] um
[1:20:31] I maybe want to just tell you a little
[1:20:33] bit of that I said once
[1:20:35] and my wife asked these words after I
[1:20:37] broke her heart she says why are you so
[1:20:39] happy I said cause it's gone
[1:20:43] it's gone
[1:20:45] and that's when I started seeing God
[1:20:47] deal with me in my life first person
[1:20:51] and not third person
[1:20:53] because now there was nothing between my
[1:20:55] Lord and my savior and sister Shannon
[1:20:56] you love that song Let There be nothing
[1:20:58] between your lord
[1:21:00] and your savior amen amen may the Lord

[1:21:06] word of prayer I don't I don't feel like
[1:21:08] we have to have a big repent of service
[1:21:10] and everybody kneel you in front but I
[1:21:12] do want us to stand up and I do want you
[1:21:14] to disclose your eyes and if there is
[1:21:16] something

[1:21:35] Supply my every need or maybe I think
[1:21:38] that you're not days of Miracles are
[1:21:40] over or there's something blocking
[1:21:43] your presence from me
[1:21:47] that that that lovely moment that that

[1:22:24] my wrongdoing right in my life Lord
[1:22:27] and I feel so helpless and I can't
[1:22:28] change it Lord because I don't know how
