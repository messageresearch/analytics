you this amen amen thank you m j well it's a Wednesday and you are more than Victorious you're Overcomer God bless you let's open our Bibles in the book of um Genesis chapter 19 verse 17 oh by the way it's very nice to have you back brother Ben and also Naomi than thank you for coming God bless you let's read the word says and it came to pass when they had brought them forth abroad that he said Escape for thy life look not behind thee neither stay thou in all the plain escape to the mountain lest thou be consumed and verse 22 um says has the scape th for I cannot do anything till thou become come th let's let's just pray again almighty God I have read your word Lord but I ask you for your help to be able to speak Lord to your people in Jesus Christ's name I ask this amen you may have your seats amen early this week I heard the seron the God of this evil age and I was supposed to preach like three or four weeks ago but I swap with her man and then I went to a funeral and but I'm here and I thought it was quite amazing that all the same they been preach from this Pulpit they have been like in the same line and I was like brother Arman Please Don't Preach about that and then Isaac he was quite close and I was like but tonight the night so we have a picture here of Sodom and lot escaping for his life big was the destruction of Sodom because the people that Liv there they was they were evil the Lord said that they were evil and the Bible says then the Lord Reign upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimson and fire from the Lord out of heaven and he overthrew those cities and all the plain and all the inhabitants of the cities and that which grew upon the grounds but his wife looked back from behind him and she become became a pillar of salt so one of the thoughts for tonight is escape for your life and don't look back amen this world can offer you hips of stuff but now that you are sitting here you shouldn't look back lord we are called to to escape from this evil age don't be like Lord's wife the brother brandham said I'm not too sure if was brother Bram but anyways she looked back she remember how good was living in the city she had all the um hairstyle products she could have go to trim her he or whatever she looked back cuz she was about to lost everything she probably was just a thought that she had but she looked back and she she was not alive to to tell anyone else about that and in the Book of Luke uh we have the scripture this is likewise this is Jesus Christ talking likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drunk they bought they sto they planted they build it but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rain fire and brimstone from heaven and Destroy them all even th shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed we have that we know that in Sodom they were building they were living their lives they didn't even consider what was going to happen they didn't know they were just too busy doing their own things but Sly it was one thing that the city got destroyed and only one family survived we find another example in the Bible is Noah but as the day of Noah where so shall also the coming of the son of man be for as in the day that they were before the flood they were eating and drinking marrying and giving in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark and knew that until the flood came and took them all all away so shall also the coming of the son of man be again was the same situation there were living their lives they didn't even consider God the only family that was um that was able to be rescued was Noah's family the whole world back then got destroyed they were too busy they were too busy eating they were too busy drinking getting married which is not bad James getting married it's not bad getting married but they the Bible here saying that they were too busy in their social activities they didn't consider God they didn't want to listen book of Hebrews says by faith Noah being warn of God of things had not seen as yet mve with fear prepare an ark to be saving of his house by the which he condemned the world and became ear of righteousness which is by Faith No Faith condemned the world same as your faith will condemn this world but in order to knowah to be safe he had to build an ark have you ever seen pictures of the Ark have you seen how big was that Ark that was Faith expressed was not just like you I believe that Jesus is true I'm going to stay home tonight because I don't really want to go to church he should for like a 100 years or so he build that Ark he trusted Jesus um the Lord's word he build the ark because that's how faith is expressed you you do works we are not saved by works but when you have faith you do the works amen amen so so s and Gomorrah and the old world had something in common unbelief they didn't believe the word of God they didn't want to believe the word of God they were too busy they were just too busy and this is what happened in this time this world has rejected the word of God there's unbelief everywhere they have crucified the world they have crucified Jesus Christ once again when they reject the word they can have big churches but Jesus is not there because they have reject the word second Peter um chapter 3 says knowing the fear that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own L and saying where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all thing continue as they were from the beginning of the creation for this they willingly are ignor an of that by the way of God the heaven were of all and the Earth standing out of the water and in the water whereby the world that then was being overflowed with water perished but the Heaven and the Earth which are now by the same word are kept in STO receive unto fire against the day day of judgment and predition of ungodly men people don't believe that those cities in that world the old pre flood world existed they can't comprehend they can't believe the word of God we will see that they are called this um um what's this word well I'm going to read this one anyways but that the stage of the world unbelief everywhere we have woman preaches how to enter in God's presence preached by some Apostle wearing pants makeup whatever they can't eat the whole book but it's not their fault they they are not chosen they can't really see it we'll see here soon says 2 Corinthians chapter 4 says in whom the God of this world Satan hath blinded their mind of them which believe not L the light of the Glorious gospel El of Christ who is the image of God she will shine unto them she will shine unto them they have being blinded how blessed how blessed you than let's have this mega churches Mega Lots Mega musicians everything's big and shiny and man wow imagine playing in the band eh they have the buildings they have the instruments they have everything they don't have God they don't have Jesus they rejected him they don't want him they say that the gospel is to all woman with long hair to all they don't even look pretty what a bunch of flies but that's a stage of the world I think there let's read Romans 1 says professing themselves to be wise they become fools and change the glory of the uncorruptible god into an image made like the corruptible man and to birds and for footed beast and cripping things wherefore God also gave them up to the uncleanness through the last of their own Hearts to the their own bodies between themselves who change the truth of God into a lie and worship and serve the creature more than the Creator who is blessed forever amen for this cause God gave them un to vile affections for even the woman did change the natural use of the which is against nature and likewise also the men living the natural use of the woman burn in their lust one towards another men with men working that which is is unly and receiving in themselves that recompense themselves that recompense of their era which was meat and even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge God gave them over to a reprobate mind to do things which are not convenient they didn't want God in their lives so God give them a reproved mind so now as they do evil things they feel that they're doing the right thing we have parades we have people that they're so proud nothing I don't have anything against people that they have they make their own decisions I used to have friends that they were gays or whatever when I was back in the world but I couldn't be friends with them anymore cuz I stand for Jesus they're are nice people but they don't believe the same thing as you brother Bram also speaks that this world this evil age it's so proud of the technology back um the sermon the God of this evil age was preaching in 1965 so they were preparing all the rockets and stuff to go to the moon now we are preparing Rockets to go to Mars but brother Bram said I don't want to go to the Moon I just want to pass it so fast that I'm not going to even see it I want to go to heaven amen but this world is so proud of technology and what the man can do and they feel and they think that they don't need God they have hospitals that they can heal people they have computers that they can do so much stuff even your little smartphone it's man it's just amazing how they were able to fit a computer that was the size of this building in your pocket that's technology and human are so proud of it and they don't need God they have cities that you can see them from space they shine they're so bright man you can have more it is more lights welcome we have we can offer you wherever you like M but not Jesus we can offer you we can entertain you we can give you emotion you can we can have offer you movies we can offer you games we can offer you music anything you want but Jesus is not there Ephesians 5 says let no man deceive you with vain words for because of these things come as the wrath of God upon the children of this disobedience be not ye therefore partakers with them for ye were sometime Darkness but now are ye light in the Lord walk as children of light for the fruit of the spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and Truth proving there is acceptable unto the Lord one day we walked in darkness but the light of Jesus and the light of his word just changed our life and clean us from all our sins Amen Let just walk as childrens of Life Light amen the denomination in the world that wait waiting for that man a second Joseph A man that can just fix the economy a man that can fix everything a big politic man they want to fix the world my brother and my sister this world can't be fixed it's going against scripture think that this world is going to get better it just has to be worse it will be just like in the day days of lot and no this world is going to get destroyed no matter what as a bride of Jesus Christ we can pray for the people we have a no one wants people getting banned that's an awful thought as Christian I don't want to see anyone getting burn there's some people that going to get bur anyways at this world they think that they are like in this stage full of lights but actually they're in darkness that's how the Lord sees them Revelation 3 says because thou sayest I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and know that now Thou Are W riched and miserable and poor and blind and naked this world think that they have everything what you need you can get the faster of the fastest car next year there's another one you're never going to cut up this world just go too fast but the real condition of this world is what Jesus is Richard miserable poor blind naked and they're so proud of that they can't believe the word of God not like you but Hallelujah it shall come to pass that the evening time it shall be light hallelujah amen and the title of this serment is Overcomers of this evil age this world that is full of Darkness man there's light for you there's light for you person that is sitting here there's light for you my brother and Paul light for everyone that's here that we don't have to walk in darkness we can just walk in the light of God Amen and this Overcomer group this select squat this Delta Force people the Bride of Jesus Christ amen can stand in this world because we have the blood of Jesus Christ and we accept him amen Revelation 12 says and they overcame him the Devil by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they love know their lives un the death the Bride of Jesus Christ this wonderful people that's here tonight we are been judged in this life so we don't have to get judged in the next one so our lives and if we accept Jesus in our life he are working in our lives he are getting rid of stuff if you have to let something go let that thing go that's stopping you to grab in the Lord Don't Look Back amen CU this world is going to get destroyed amen a big difference between the of Jesus Christ and the rest of the churches is that we accept Jesus the Jesus that was hung upon a cross and this Jesus the word the world they love Jesus this man that came down from heaven and died for their sins but they can't accept this they can't they were not called to accept this but you you and me Hallelujah glory to God you were called to accept the word of of of God Amen Romans 8 says for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear that word was prophesied here not long ago but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry ABA father the spirit itself bear witness with our spirit that we are children of God I was listening um seon from um a pastor from Venezuela I had this um verse I was driving the van I just start to cry my own um how you cool my own Revival in the van that was me in in Jesus because the spirit of God that is in you talk to your spirit and reveal to you that you are children of God and doesn't matter how the day goes doesn't matter what are you going to do doesn't matter what can happen to you during the day you are a children of God amen amen amen and if children then his his of God and join his with Christ and it so be that we suffer with him and that we may also glorify together for I reckon that the suffering of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in US amen just waiting for that day my brother for the inest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God there's a big expectation for you and me and as this well they have reject Jesus Psalms 118 says the stone which the builders refused it become the head and stone of the corner this mad people of the old days all the rabis and people that study the Bible they just refus him was just way too simple this man who's this man he's not a king he can do all the Miracles yeah but he doesn't want to belong to uh to our fellowship he doesn't want to belong to our church so I'm not but we have accepted him Hebrews 12 also said looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endure the cross despising the shame and it said down at the right hand of the Throne of God hallelujah the author and finisher of our faith the Bride of Jesus Christ we're going to have to be tested like no one else because the thing that this Rapture the Raptor of the church hasn't happened well it did happen more than once actually but not in these days but we're going to be tested like gold and you know how the gold was Ted with fire prove you're going to have to prove that you're a bride you're going to have to prove that you can stand in this world and shine hallelujah amen there a beautiful testimony from a all this daughter of Lilia she went to be my daughter and she is the only one in her school that wor cured man in this day in that school there one children of God that just saw to all of them how the things are supposed to be but do you think that the devil is happy with that do you think that the devil is happy with you of course not cuz you are shining and just keep shining amen but the the whole thought of this sermon of this little words that I can share to you is Jesus Christ knocking at the door Revelation 3 says behold I stand at the door and knock in If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and I will sub with him and he with me Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost cannot live in you if you don't accept him you have to open the door you have to let him just search in your life and start to get rid of everything what he doesn't want you to have there a painting the light of the world by this English painter William Holman hunt there's a beautiful story in this painting and it's like this man he painted Jesus cried knocking on the door and someone asked him oh you forgot the door handle and he said no because the door of the human heart only can be opened from the inside side yeah that's why Jesus he just knocked he doesn't want he doesn't pull the door yeah he's knocking and if you want to open the door to him man that's going to be the Glorious Day in your life to receive the Holy Ghost and this is a little bit of my testimony you have to get to one point in your life that you don't want to live your life anymore that was for me how how I think I I received it anyways I was like Lord I'm 23 years old I'm a drug addict I drink pretty much the whole day I swear I messed it up but Lord if you give me one chance to start over again I just want to start all over again and in that moment when you don't want to leave and when you are fully empty cuz man when you're in the world you think you're the coolest of the coolest me and David we we see so many people in Wellington man wearing all these funny clothes and I'm like man this guy he just got up today and he said I'm going to wear the finest of the finest of my wardrobe and oh boy full of Pride yeah they look awesome this world think that they're awesome but I didn't want to live like that anymore and in that moment when you fully can just accept that you are no one Jesus Christ can live in your life and I can't say that I'm proud because I didn't do that the Lord he just shut every window and every door I didn't have any anywhere to to run that was it that was me I just I tried to kill myself but the Lord Jesus Christ he says no so a young person there's a way to be overcome in this evil age by yourself no way with the blood of Jesus Christ 100% And from Jesus Christ who is a faithful witness and for the and the first begotten of the de and the prince of the Kings who are the rest of the Kings I'm looking at them all the Earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood and had made us King and priest unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen one day we're going to get to heaven and it's not going to be because anything that we have done it's just going to be because of him just because he died on the cross for you and me and you have shed his blood Hallelujah this is the message the Rapture says we can't we can forgive but not forget I could forgive you but I always remember you done these evil things then you are not just forgiven but in the sight of God the bride is Justified she never done it in the first place amen standing there married to the virtu Son of God never sined in the first place why she was for ordained she was dropped into this and now when she he the truth and come forth the blood cleanse her and she stands there Pi see she not sin on her there's no sin in you because you have received the blood of Jesus Christ in your life Hallelujah let's just have the musicians but let's just think about this have you received Jesus Christ in your heart have you opened the door yeah I remember when I used to my mom used to invite me to go to church there were some times that I felt this thing inside of me but I didn't want to open the door and as a true children of God you can feel this thing that start burning inside of you that you man this is the moment but sometimes we just don't want to open the door tonight we're going to have a prayer meeting and if you haven't opened the door to Jesus let's just open the door today tonight let just let him live in your life cuz you're not never you're never going to repent of that I remember to my life it got to that end and I thought this is just a dead end but I give my life to Jesus and I got married this beautiful lady here and I got my two kids and out of that did end the world that want me to die because he just produced life that's Jesus let's just play um be his name let's just stand and play that
