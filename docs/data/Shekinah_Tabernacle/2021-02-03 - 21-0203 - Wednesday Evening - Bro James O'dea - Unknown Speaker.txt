keep singing for him right hallelujah amen so before we have a special i think we have to sing one more song just because everybody looks like they really want to sing tonight can we sing it's bubbly please the reason for it is it is bubbling amen i had one of the hardest trials i ever thought mentally you know those mental battles that the laws fight and then once you tell satan where he belongs and you get the victory you can't help but bubbling the law just helps you to overcome so let's please do bubbling if you don't mind please amen oh it's bubbling it's bubbling it's bubbling in my soulless singing and laughing since jesus made me own some folks don't understand it how can i keep it quiet [Music] jesus made me all some folks don't understand it how can i keep it quiet it's

worthy is the lamb amen let us all just stand up maybe we want to change the order can we sing i pledge allegiance to the land i have heard of christians long ago they were born before [Music] if they would renounce the name of christ and one by one and they chose to die but the sun i can know [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] now the years have [Music] has come to counter to retake this world and embrace let us give our life to the one who died who gave [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] i [Music] is [Music] who [Music] [Music] to the lamb of god it's to the lamb of god [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] just softly i pledge allegiance to [Music] i will [Music] is hello thank you jesus hallelujah you know we're coming into a time when you're going to have to pledge allegiance to something and i really think brother roman for leading the songs and when i see seeing that he was going to sing that song i thought praise the lord i hope he calls me up on that song praise the lord if you could just put out my slideshow please and if you want to turn you can turn to mark but it's up on the slideshow as well so we're going mark 13 verse 9. cool but take heed to yourselves for they shall deliver you up to councils and in the synagogues you shall be beaten and you shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake for a testimony against them and the gospel must first be published among all nations but when they shall lead you and deliver you up take no thought beforehand what you shall speak neither do you premeditate but whatsoever shall be given shall be given you in that hour that speak ye for it is not ye that speak but the holy ghost and i've just got another scripture here that i want to take and you can read that one if you want or it's luke 2 1. and it came to pass on those days that they went out a decree from caesar augustus that all the world should be taxed and all went to be taxed everyone into his own city so let's just pray and just commit this time to the lord heavenly father lord i just see this time we're coming into lord is such a such a real time lord just a pressureful time lord a worrying time lord jesus ever not for knowing you but father i just pray lord that your holy spirit lord will just move among us tonight lord oh lord just take my lips lord for they just shake together lord and don't know what to say father but our lord let your spirit speak lord as we've just read lord it's not we that speak with the holy spirit father and lord we just pray that you'd rightly divide the word for us tonight lord and just speak unto us lord and to our need father lord we just pray you bless this reading of your word in jesus name amen you may take your seats so the thought i had was a cold-pressed bride an extra virgin cold press borrowed and you know it to get this bride to perfection is going to take a pressure and we've been through the fires there's been all sorts of trials that people have come up through 2 000 years but it's got to take a squeeze to bring out the pure oil just like the goldsmiths they used to beat the gold you know because they wanted to get pure gold and it was just by beating it just pressure just time and just getting out all the imperfections and it's we've just got to get to the point where we just get out all those imperfections and if you think about a squeeze if you take a piece of fruit you say you take a lime now if you went to the supermarket and bought a lime and it had no juice in it you got home and you opened it up and there was no juice and it was dry you're like well that's a it's a dud lime i don't want that lime but you want a nice juicy one because all the goodness all the flavour and all everything that you want out of that limes in the juice so then you begin to squeeze that lime and all that juice comes out and you squeeze and you know it's interesting that the the less oil that's left to be squeezed out the more pressure has to be applied to get out that last drop and all the life's on the juice and what's left is just the flesh of the lemon and god's got to get the pure oil out of us amen who wants that who wants to see the pure oil come out in your life i mean it's going to take a squeeze in revelation 21 verse 9 it says and there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues and talked with me saying come hither i will show thee the bride the lamb's wife you know the prophet identified himself with that scripture and he carried me away in the spirit into a great and high mountain and showed me that great city the holy jerusalem descending out of heaven from god having the glory of god and her light was like unto a stone most precious even like a jasper stone clear as crystal you know it takes pressure to create a precious gem amen and when i read this and i read the other stones i like to just just look a little deeper into what's behind it because each gemstones are made out of different elements that are squeezed together so like a diamond is formed when carbon atoms come together and then under extreme pressure they're squeezed together that diamond then becomes the hardest substance on earth so i wondered about this jasper stone and jasper's formed from volcanic ash something that's already been through the fire and then that combines with silica sand and through pressure it turns into a jasper stone and god likened her radiance as to a stone most precious like a jasper stone there's something interesting about this i found somebody i don't know who the quote was from but it was on one of those webstone sites each jasper stone possesses a unique pattern or colour scheme making it one of the most unique gemstones i thought that was rather interesting because god has a unique bride you know with a unique character and brother ben was talking about it with the girls going down south you're unique and that's what god's creating and it's coming from pressure because each trial that you go through is different and though we're going to be one bride we're still going to be unique in heaven you know daniel will have a testimony of being in the lion's den and noah will be able to tell you about the heaviest rain you've ever seen elijah would be able to tell you about getting chased by jezebel but you know what maybe one day moses will come up to you and say what's your testimony because you'll have a testimony and and brother impose trials might not be the same as brother ben's trials and then his character is a bit different both godly pure oil but everyone has a different manifestation to manifest amen so there's got to come a squeeze on this world and it's got to come on the bride to bring out a pure oil that extra virgin oil amen it's got to be cold pressed we've been done with the fire now it's now it's a real this is going to be a different kind of trial has anybody felt like the squeeze is starting to like i know this squeeze has been here but that it's starting to tighten up as brother branham said it will start to tighten that when it starts to tighten up you know i was thinking about this and i was thinking what about in lockdown did you have any rights you had some rights but a lot of your rights were taken away we couldn't just say all right they say we can't gather but we're going to have church anyway we couldn't do that we would have been locked up it's only going to get tighter and tighter from here so in that scripture we took luke 2 and verse 1 it says it come to pass in those days that they went out a decree from caesar augustus that all the world should be taxed and all went to be taxed everyone into his own city so i was looking at this and i had to i've got it there i had to look up what it meant that word tax because it wasn't what i thought i thought that meant that everyone had to go into their own country and pay some money but it's not what the scripture was saying it said everybody had to go back into their homeland and a record was taken israel was numbered and they wanted to know who was from where and who was from where and under this covet it's now causing men from all over the world to return to their homelands just like in the scripture you know we've had many flus over the year we've had swine flu bird flu has been man flus but none of these flus have caused such a pressure to come on the world amen none of them have taken away our rights and freedoms but this is what the squeeze is to do to bring a pressure upon all men and you know they've got if people don't they can't receive the same medical care they can't receive the same financial care if they're not in their own home country so there's reasons why people are going back to their home countries spiritual things that are in the bible shadows have to be made manifest now things that we see like patterns repeat in the bible at the coming the first coming of christ gabriel was sent before to declare to a virgin to mary that she would bring forth a christ trial and gave gabriel's message to mary tonight a virgin bride because she's got to bring forth a christ child in this age in 61 mary's belief we are looking for a heavenly visitor in this day it's a promise of god put on your deep spiritual thinking quick church and remember we are looking for a visitor and there's many claiming it but the only way that we will know this heavenly visitor because he'll be a record of the word and she knew that the angel was from god when she seen his action looked at him and must have been an angel he said i am gabriel standing at the right hand of god now when god gets ready to do something he sends a messenger always always has always will gabriel announce the first coming of christ gabriel will announce the second coming of christ that's right something major is fixing to happen and we noticed this angel when he said hail mary and told her what was going to take place she didn't doubt him because she knew no he was perfectly scriptural and that it was supposed to be that way so that message has come forth through the message of a prophet again to a virgin bride to a second mary that's that would be you if i could take a bit of liberty i would say a extra virgin a cold press extra virgin church amen because of christ you have you're going to have to manifest again a christ child the same i just started seeing a pattern here the same way that this happened two thousand years ago that's the way it's going to happen again because jesus wants to prove again he wants to prove to the world that christ lives in the bride amen it has to prove he lives that's what i want to see you know i want to come to church when we have those meetings when we see all the gifts happening or we see prophecy happening where we see people where i want to see someone come up here that's sick with a tumour and that term is prayed for and that thing falls off and hits the ground rolls out and rolls out the door because that's the kind of power that's coming into the church it's happened before and it's going to come again so with covert we've been called back to our homeland and herod which is satan and herod he knew that christ was in the land because there had been a star that identified christ's coming amen i asked myself why did that picture of brother branham with the halo above his head have to hang in washington this is a testimony before the powers and rulers of this earth yes that christ is coming amen amen when herod was on the wall path he wants to kill that christ child before it can manifest the power of god so now the bride coming under this pressure coming back to her homeland at this time and now herod puts out a decree to kill all the young children because he's got to kill that christ child he does not want that christ child to manifest power upon the earth and we know that the birth is always a vulnerable time right whenever something's about to give birth it's a very vulnerable time especially you see in africa or something like that when a buffalo or whatever animal it is is giving birth and the lions will hang around that one if they can it's an easy it's an easy meal it's easy to take the young and it's the same way spiritually a baby can't defend itself and that's why the pentecostal church can come so close to the real thing but she's still a baby she's a hundred year old baby but she never grew up she had something genuine you know when she started off she had something genuine but she just never grew up and anybody today without a seventh angel's message is gonna be devoured because it just debate that roman dragon wants to kill any of god's seed while it's a baby before it can mature because once it matures it can defend itself right i want to follow some of this through revelation 12 and 1 and there appeared a great wonder in heaven a woman clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of twelve stars and she being with child cried travailing in birth and pain to be delivered and there appeared another wonder in heaven and behold a great redragon having seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns upon his head and his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven and to cast him to the earth and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered for to devour her child as soon as it was born so here's now a pattern of satan after the first christ and we can see how he's going to come after the second one being birthed in a bride but god's given us an open book right he's given us an open book prophecy to warn us and to show us where we're at and what's going to happen around us so in matthew 2 13 and when they were departed behold an angel of the lord appeareth unto joseph in a dream saying arise and take the young child and his mother and flee into egypt and be thou there until i bring me word for herod will seek the young child to destroy him so let the squeeze come it's not going to change the fact that god looks after his own right god will move you when you need to be moved if god can move two million people in the desert then he can move you he can warn you he can pick a church up and move it to nelson i don't think he'll do that but if he can lead two million people through the desert to find water in a barren desert maybe only two k's away and find water then he can lead us i mean how many times have maybe this is just my testimony but how many times i'll be driving and then someone will slow me down and i can't get past them and you're held up we had it in one when we were down and traveling from queenstown to wanaka and we were in a rush when we were delayed leaving home we're probably i don't know sitting in the car waiting but then when we're going up that crown range and we're just one corner off the next corner and i see a truck come down the road on the wrong side of the road um two wheels smoke coming off and just go straight across the corner we would have driven around and off the hill you know what if we had it been 20 seconds in front you know we might have collided and god knows how to place you to look after his own amen we're very precious to him amen verse 16 then herod when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men was exceeding wrath and sent forth and slow all the children that were in bethlehem and all the coasts thereof from two years old and under according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men then was fulfilled that which was spoken by jeremiah the prophet saying i read this i just felt the lord say go read that in jeremiah there's something there for you and so i read it in jeremiah and i'm going to carry on right from there reading that in jeremiah thus saith the lord lord a voice was heard in remark lamentation and bitter weeping rachel weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children because they were not but see the the dragon now the devil coming down in this age and robbing our children your children while they get babes and the lord because they don't know how to defend themselves yet and he's out as a roaring lion seeking her to devour and here in the scripture and rachel it says rachel now rachel's a type of the gentile bride she was the fair one that jacob loved and she represented the gentile weeping through children and you can't comfort a mother that's lost a child i'm not a mother i can't understand but i can very much understand what it would be like to feel that you've lost a child so the only way you're going to get comfort is to take that back from the enemy right this is where the lord seeker readers in jeremiah so he carries on in 16 thus saith the lord refrain thy voice from weeping and then eyes from tears for thy work shall be rewarded saith the lord and they shall come again from the land of the enemy and there is hope and known in saith the lord that all thy children shall come again to their own border so i missed that part often when we read it in in the new testament but i believe that's true you know because if you've instilled something in your child they know about california going down they know about these things they know about the catholic church coming up they know all these things though they suppress it but as this pressure comes on and we start losing liberties and all these things come on there's probably going to be a time those kids are going to go you know what i've actually heard this before i've actually seen this in prophecy before and it's going to start getting real serious so i've been watching this and for now for now i'm just going to say what i'm going to say about it and i'm going to keep watching it but it's interesting that we've come into a global pandemic a great pressure this is a time when leaders either going to fall arise and we've just seen the last trump leavers office and now america has some bad karma or camilla and now we have a catholic president and a protestant vice president that just happens to be a woman and this is where it starts getting interesting one of their main political agendas and main political pushes to get into government has been on abortion because it's all about the child and so what they want to do is they want to overturn old amendments that were made that allowed each state to make their own rule on abortion and override the main the main role but what they're doing is overturning that and saying no now that amendment's gone and they want to make abortion available to anyone at any time and are free of charge so now they can abort it eight months nine months well i don't think they're past it but that's been there one of their main drives in their political move to get into office so it's it's a spiritual and natural going hand in hand all the time the devil does not want this child to come forth in revelation 13 1 it said and i stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up out of the sea having seven heads and ten horns and upon his ten horns ten crowns and upon his head's the name of blasphemy and i saw one of its heads as it were wounded to death and his deadly wound was healed and all the world wandered after the beast and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the book of life of the land slain from the foundation of the world if any man have an ear let him hear and from verse 11 and behold another beast coming up out of the earth and he had two horns like a lamb and spake as a dragon and exercises all the power of the first beast before him and causeth the earth and them that dwell therein to worship the first beast whose deadly wound was healed and deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast saying to them that dwell on the earth that they should make an image to the beast which had the wound by a sword and did live and he had power to give life unto the image of a beast that the image of the beast should both speak and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed so now here in political power in america we've got one rising up out of the ocean and one coming up off the earth and power this is why i'm saying this is very interesting now to watch this space because i'm starting to see this in scripture very clearly so in the church age book brother branham says the beast that was wounded unto death but lived again as imperial pagan rome that fell to the onslaught of the barbarians and thereby lost her temporal power but she regained it in baffle roam do you see it the nation that ruled by crushing all which became the strongest empire ever known was finally wounded to death her power was gone physically as to control armies etc but under constantine she came back to life for papal rome has infiltrated the whole world and her power is absolute she uses kings and merchants and her deadly religious and financial strength she is governing as the goddess of this present age she is also the dragon that stood waiting to devour the man-child hero tried to kill the lord jesus and failed later jesus was crucified by roman soldiers but is now caught up to the throne now along with what i have just said recall the vision of daniel the last part of the image the last world power was in the feet that was iron and clay see the iron is the roman empire but now it is no longer solid iron clay is mixed in it yet it is there running world affairs in both democratic nations and despotic ones the roamer's church is in every nation it is mixed up in it all let me give you a little something on the iron and clay remember when khrushchev beat his shoe on the desk at the u.n well there were five eastern nations and there were five western khrushchev spoke for the east and the president eisenhower for the west and russia crucifies clay eisenhower means iron the two main leaders of the world the two big toes of the feet of iron and clay were side by side we are in the end of it all in verse 4 it asks who was able to make war with the beast now there are pres at present some great names in the world there are some mighty nations but right now rome is calling the tune the pope is in the driver's seat and his power is going to increase no one can war against him so now we have that we have our president biden hand in hand with the catholic church and we've got the vice president there who's a protestant and we're going to somehow expect these to a protestant right but like usually that's not a working relationship but these two are now controlling the powers of america very very interesting but we don't need a fear because watch what happens next and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face word as the sun and his feet pillars of fires and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea i thought i'd illustrate this keep your attention and he put his left hand upon left foot upon the earth so now we've got a messenger that's come with an open book and he's come to say look this is you're exposed we're going to expose you to your lord that's right and then then we go down to verse 8 we know well and the voice which i heard from heaven spake unto me again and said go take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and the earth and i went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and i took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as i had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings you know who's had that feeling of butterflies in your stomach before a real genuine feeling of butterflies in your stomach you know i bet it felt like that so wonderful to hear the revelation oh man so good but then now you're going to go take it we're going to bring you before rulers and kings and oh that feeling you know it's it's you know we have no need to fear because we have the holy spirit but if i was honest if i didn't have the holy spirit i would be very scared because it's a very real time it's a very real pressure that's coming this is the bride stand she has thus saith the lord not to worship the image of the beast amen this book is in our hands and spiritually speaking that beast is underneath our feet his time to exercise control over god's elect is fast running out but remember there's always twins if the devil's manifesting then so is christ going to manifest as soon as he steps it up and not try the bride will step it up and not try amen so now this dragon's manifesting itself where is its attention going to turn because remember it was after the first christ child at the birth so now as this is all coming up to a hit this dragon again is going to turn to the birthplace of the second coming of christ right which is in the bride that's why the pressure is going to come on the bride the squeeze and it's happening now you know we can put this off but it's happening now because there's groups in other parts of the world that are not being allowed to gather they've been they've been brought that right now they've been brought before magistrates and rulers and and kings and been judged for what they believed just as this world council of churches is gathering together and you know these people that are gathering together they think they're doing it for the good they don't realize that they're doing it for the best so it's not it's not the people we have to remember that it's always a balance so if we go to the image in daniel 3 verse 2 it says then nebuchadnezzar the king sent together together the princes the governors the captains the judges the treasurers the councillors the sheriffs and all the rulers of the provinces to come to the dedication of the image which nebuchadnezzar the king had set up this is what i believe is happening this has all been set up nebuchadnezzar is gathering all the people gathering all the people to set up a council then the princes the governors the captains the judge the treasurers the councillors the sheriffs and all the rulers of the provinces were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that nebuchadnezzar the king had set up and they stood before the image that nebuchadnezzar had set up then a herald angel then then a herald cried aloud to you it has commanded o people nations and languages that at what time you hear the sound of the cornet the flute the heart the sack but the poultry the dick climber and all kinds of music you fall down and worship the in the golden image that nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up and who so falleth not down in worship the same hour shall be cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace wherefore at that time certain chaldeans came near and accused the jews and there are certain jews whom thou has set over the affairs of the province of babylon sadrak meshach and abednego these men o king have not regarded thee nor serve thy gods nor worship the golden image which thou has set up then nebuchadnezzar and his rage and fury commanded to bring shadrach meshach and abednego and they brought these men before the king just remember in context to our scripture and the gospel must first be published among all nations and you have this book you have the revelation of jesus christ but when they shall lead you and deliver you up take no thought beforehand what you shall speak neither do you pre-meditate for whatsoever shall be given to you in that hour speak ye for it is not ye that speak but the holy ghost amen like i said don't put this off this is current affairs this is the news amen this is this is the news i enjoy you know amen i've just been watching that squeeze you know it's not like it's been a new thing the squeeze has been here for a while but it's got to begin to tighten i mean and just to get the closer we're getting to the end right the more pressure's coming on to get out that last little bit of oil nebuchadnezzar's spike and sit under them is it true sad rack mesh and a bendigo do you not serve my gods nor worship the golden image which i have set up now if you be ready at what time you hear the sound of the cornet float heart and sack but sultry and dark climber and all kinds of music you fall down and worship the image which i have made well but if you worship not you shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a bernie fiery furnace and who is that god that shall deliver you out of my hands see this slippery devil trying to get them to doubt amen jehovah i hope i don't have to say this too many times shadrach meshach and abednego answered and said to the king o nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to answer thee in this matter in other words we have no need to answer you they don't have to go away and seek counsel and they have to go away and ask the pastor you know the answer was we will not worship your image amen amen if it be so our god whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace and he will deliver us out of thy hand o king but if not be it known unto thee o king that we will not serve thy gods nor worship the golden image which thou has set up amen that's why i like brother man saying that so i pledge allegiance to the land because you're going to have to pledge allegiance to something soon and you're going to have to either pledge it for spiritual things and suffer pressure or pleasure for heavenly things just don't pledge it for the wrong things everyone today is searching for the mark of the beast and you know i've heard it said recently by within message ranks don't take the coronavirus vaccine it's the mark of the beast and you know that's nonsense but the mark of the beast is to worship the image of his beast that's to come under their denominational systems and come under this council that's the mark of the beast if you're wondering what it is don't go there we're separate amen amen we've had an angel messenger that's come and crushed that image told us to stay away from it and you know the bride's going to have to watch he doesn't come under the influence of this land that speaks like a dragon because remember that lamb looked like a lamb brother branham said it spake like a lamb in the beginning because it was a religion but then later on it spake like a dragon so you know it's easy for us to follow the trends of pentecost and you know singing songs i'm not saying against it but we can easily follow that image right because in the end that's going to go one way and we're going to go this way but you know i believe we have a song they can't even sing because we have something to manifest that they don't amen that's why i love brother isaac songs you know because it's manifesting my revelation and they might not go and i don't even know what you're on about we have something to manifest saying there's at some point where prophet's gonna say come out and be separate yeah i mean it's a dinner thieves and foul things amen look away to jesus so now i'm going to say something to you now that i haven't said all along and that is the thing that we have looked for for so long for at least many years four or five years maybe longer the third poll has now been vindicated and i'm sure you all know what it is now remember there will never be an impersonation of that because it cannot be see it cannot be now it is in existence and i have and and warned of this that soon right at this time now it's just happened he's been revealing thoughts and things so it could identify its presence among you see but it will not be used in a great way until this council begins to tighten up and when it does when that does the pentecostals and so forth can almost impersonate anything can be done but when that time comes when the squeeze comes down then you'll see what you've seen temporarily be manifest in the fullness of its power see pure oil extra virgin bride displaying christ proving that he lives again on the earth amen amen when they come and want to try and shut us down we'll have to be in such a condition that we can speak what we have need of amen amen i believe that we're going to be able to do that and they will want to shut us down it's not it's not like it's something that we just say and it's like yeah we say that but it's not no it will happen lockdown was just a warning you know when we had lockdown we were blessed enough to have the internet and we could zoom and have meetings what about when the time comes they shut us down because what we have that's truth they call heresy you know well we can't meet online we're gonna have to be in a condition where we can walk amen i believe it i am absolutely sold out absolutely soul help amen now i must continue in evangelism just as i was commissioned first i must contin i must continue on therefore you've had the word and you know what to look for how to stand i must continue on an evangelism and friends of mine keep still and just keep moving on for the hour is approaching swiftly see that when something is going to be done now you might see some little odd things happen for me nothing sinful i don't mean that i mean something odd to the regular trend because where i reach to now in the ministry i'm dropping back here watching that spot and waiting for the time to use it but it's going to be used now the prophet was basically saying that this is going to happen in a great way but we just have to wait until that time comes and that will be manifested majorly and he's saying i'm dropping back because he had to drop back just like john the baptist had to drop back because he came to introduce christ so now it's time for christ to step forward which is you amen to introduce christ to this world jesus brother branham said jesus didn't finish his earthly everything in his earthly journey and but what he didn't finish he's now going to finish through you through his bride and everyone knows that for as certain as the first was identified so has the second being identified and you'll think real closely you who are spiritual as the bible said here is to him that has wisdom the third is properly identified see we know it is so the third paul was here it is so sacred that i mustn't say much about it as he told me in the beginning said this say nothing over it you remember that years ago it speaks for itself but if you've tried to explain to others and i made that a mistake this will be the thing that to my opinion he does say this i don't say the lord tells me this but this will be the thing that will start rapturing faith for the going away see i must lay quiet for just a little while now remember and who was listening to this tape you might see such a change in my ministry right away dropping back not going up dropping back we're right at that age now and it can't be go any further we just have to wait a minute until this happens over here to catch up then the time comes but it's thoroughly identified so saying just and for this manifestation to come we just have to wait for this what we've been looking at to catch up there is coming a time upon in this nation to where this nation is going to exercise all the power that the beast had before it which was pagan rome when it become papal rome see that this nation will do that revelation 13 plainly explains it the lamb come up out of the earth the other beasts come up out of the water thickness and multitudes of people this lamb come up where there were no people the lamb represents a religion the lamb of god and remember it spoke like a land it was a lamb and then after a while it received power and spoke like a dragon and exercised all the dragon power the dragon had before him and the dragon is rome always so don't you see roman denomination a mark protestant denomination an image unto the beast making a power that will force all protestants like a union you'll have to be into this council of churches or you won't be able to have fellowship and getting through what i want to read in these quotes well it's practically that way now you can't go to a church and preach unless you have a fellowship card or some identification and now on persons like ourselves we're going to be cut out of that altogether that's exactly because they won't be able to do it it's tightening and then when that time comes when the press comes to a place where you're pressed out then watch what i'm fixing to tell you in a few minutes watch the third pull then see and it will absolutely be absolutely to the total loss but it will be for the bride and the church now we are closer than it seems i don't know when but it's real real close i may be building a platform for somebody else to step on i might be taken away before that time i don't know and that time maybe this coming week that the holy spirit will come and bring christ jesus and he may come the next week he may come here tonight i don't know when he will come he doesn't tell us that but i do believe that we're so close that i would never die with old age yet at 54 years old i'll never die with old age until he is here just like how brother ben was saying um on sunday about israel becoming a nation and it would come up and brother brennan is now tying it in as well it's like an extra vindication on it until he's come and believe that and i want to say this i've never said it before but according to scripture according to what he said 30 years ago 33 years ago on the river down there in 1933 rather what he said everything has happened just exactly i may not do it but this message will introduce jesus christ to the world amen for as john the baptist was sent before on the first coming so was this message sent message to forerun the second coming amen and john said behold the lamb of god that takes away the sin of the world see so it is paralleled in every way i know it will the message will go on amen so now you have to become the message to the world you become christ to the world so why are you struggling so why use why are you in trials because you have to become pure oil you have to become christ you know why does each day seem just a little bit harder than the day before you know why does each trial seem worse than the last one maybe you don't feel like that but i know i feel like there you go well again another trial you know why me but until we come to that maturity that we can manifest the same things that christ did you can say well i don't go through any trials it's like well you're probably just about to go into one it's almost like saying hey can i have a triumph unless you can show me that you're doing exactly the same things as christ did right now okay now you're pretty some pretty good oil there you know olivani amen so christ is developing character and so is the world you know they're developing their character they're starting to manifest what's their portion sonic go back now into matthew 21 18 now in the morning as he returned into the city he hungered and when he saw a fig tree in the way he came to it and found nothing there on but leaves only you know i was just studying this before service tonight well today and the fig tree we know the figures fig trees israel the trees and man anyway but this tree you come to had no fruit and that's like the church that had no fruit and come to this tree this victory no fruit and he said unto it let no fruit grow on the henceforth forever and presently the fig tree withered away and when the disciples saw it they marveled saying how soon is the fig tree withered away jesus answered and said unto them verily i say unto you if you have faith and doubt not ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree but also ye shall say unto this mountain be removed and be cast into the sea and it shall be done so now jesus is putting it on you because part of that third poll was to preach to the souls that are in prison now as it comes up to a time there's no fruit left for a short space of time i don't know the details we don't i don't really have details but there's a space of time where we have to preach to the total lost because the image has been made up to the beast people are starting to worship the image and there's no return for them and that's part of the third pull and then also we're going to speak say to this mountain be thou removed and it will be removed amen so could you say to yourself um could you just speak to that mountain and it moves or is there some more maturing to be done you know i've been honest because i could i say to myself you know if i've got a trial my car's broke it's not going anymore i need a brand new car just appear boom done and i could say i have the faith for that because it's a seed that's already in here right i have the faith for it but it's going to come up to an actual maturity where i couldn't speak that and it will happen but brother branham says you know there's a law that's stopping it because if you have that power now without character you know i'll just create the south island like just up the road and i'll just go live up there you know like we have to have the character to be able to use that amen pressure is what's going to create it and you know the pressure is coming on the earth as well because it's about to give birth to a new one and scientists call it global warming and i kind of thought it was was quite funny people were arguing saying well it's not global warming because it rains more and there's more storms but that's what global warming does because as the sun backs upon the earth the earth heats up and then the moisture goes up and then it forms into clouds and then there's more moisture in the air and it's all going to fall back down and it's just this revolving cycle that's speeding up and getting faster and i thought you know the bride's going through global warming you know the sun's starting to bake the bride and the bride's heating up and the prayers are going up and creating rain and the revelations coming down and speeding up and speeding up you know the whole earth the heavenly powers the satanic powers everything's manifesting and everything's getting ready for this age we love them amen so i want to see these things happen before my eyes you know i want to see these things happen in church like i said where we see these supernatural holy ghost-filled meetings just let the trials come you know it's so easy to get so down on a trial and just you know oh this sucks because it does but we just have to use that and so lord develop my character and you know it's probably going to take some sacrifice on our part as well because sometimes when you're going through a trial you know why you're going through the trial yeah i'm going through the trial because i'm not dedicating enough of my time or whatever your trial is and if you just carry on going you don't develop the character that god is trying to develop and you go from that trial into the next trial and henceforth the saying goes you're either coming out of a trial or going into a trial or in a trial like you know so we should learn from our trials just say lord i just want to be honest and lay before you and lord what what do you want to do just come and work with me lord i don't want to go around the block amen and then after a while all these trials of life are going to seem quite small amen the faith that started as just a little mustard seed will grow into a big mighty tree amen amen so if you're going through some hard times don't get too down you know just remember god's stirring the nest because he's gotta you're either gonna get ready to get out of the nest and fly or get pushed out you have to learn to fly hey amen i'm just going to bring it to a close i've seen what i need to say i don't speak long sermons i just straight to the point overwhelm you you can go and look at it later or ask me questions so as the musicians come i just want to read the scripture again but take heed to yourselves for they shall deliver you up to councils and the sin and in the synagogues you shall be beaten and you shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sakes but this is the important part for a testimony against them because you are a testimony and you have to manifest christ on earth and he was rejected in his first coming and he'll be rejected in the second coming and when they reject you they reject christ amen maybe we could sing that song the battle is the lord's uh d are the battleless the lords it should be in there [Music] let's stand [Music] there is a sauce
