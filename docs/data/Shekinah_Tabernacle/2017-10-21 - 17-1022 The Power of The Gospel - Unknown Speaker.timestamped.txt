[0:00] [Music]
[0:46] this morning we're gonna have to sing
[0:50] and talk really loud to compete for um
[0:55] sound waves we did um propose to the
[1:02] landlord about putting a wall all the
[1:03] way through there okay
[1:05] do a thing me ever don't know how far
[1:08] along that's gotten anyway I like
[1:11] children I like I actually enjoy
[1:13] children laughing in and jumping around
[1:18] like we know when you've got a family if
[1:22] you've got children have you noticed
[1:24] when all your family go away and maybe
[1:26] you're just at home by yourself you know
[1:28] and you get home you walk in the door
[1:30] and us eerily quiet you kind of enjoy it
[1:33] for about half an hour and then you're
[1:34] kind of like no this is kind of weird
[1:35] it's all just quiet and not like we
[1:40] don't like quietness but you can go out
[1:42] somewhere and get that but I don't know
[1:45] you get used to just life and laughter
[1:46] and and hey with children and family
[1:50] there's a lot of Meece and a lot of
[1:54] disruption but it isn't an enjoyable
[1:57] thing proverb says we're no oxen are the
[2:00] crib is clean but much increase comes by
[2:03] the strength of the Ox
[2:04] so children are the same you know if you
[2:07] you get a lot of rewards but it's a lot
[2:09] of work in effort than the mean time and
[2:11] a lot of miss you know your cribs not
[2:13] clean you're you're you're doing things
[2:15] but if you don't if you don't have a
[2:18] mess you can't really have progress if
[2:19] you don't have them it's like that in
[2:21] anything you know if you just sit back
[2:23] and do nothing then there's no messes no
[2:24] nothing there's no drama there's nothing
[2:25] but when you go out and try and do
[2:27] something that's win everything that's
[2:29] when the good comes that's when the bad
[2:30] comes but we happy that in the Lord we
[2:34] were always successful in all that we do
[2:36] whether we naturally succeed or fail it
[2:38] doesn't matter the Lord's always got if
[2:40] we one of hers he's got a plan in it and
[2:41] and everything is always for our good
[2:43] and for our being
[2:44] but so we can trust in the Lord with
[2:46] that Anna let's let's stand this morning
[2:51] and we'll sing um are you looking for
[2:54] the fullness of the blessing of the Lord
[2:55] in your heart and life today I really

[19:47] Amy and praise little what a great song
[19:49] you can take your seats
[19:50] this morning that song was written by a
[20:00] man called Charles Tim Lee no Charleston
[20:04] Lee he was he was actually born around
[20:07] the same era time as the other men that
[20:10] wrote the other song this man was an
[20:13] african-american that wrote that song
[20:14] and his mother was free but his father
[20:19] was a slave and then his mother died
[20:22] when he was quite young so his mother's
[20:24] auntie took him in otherwise he would I
[20:27] guess because his father was a slave it
[20:29] wouldn't quite work out for him to live
[20:34] with his father I guess so yeah and a
[20:37] lot of the things he learned he was
[20:39] self-taught like in his music and
[20:41] everything because I guess you know I'm
[20:42] really to teach him so he taught himself
[20:43] music and all that and he actually
[20:45] became he went into the ministry he
[20:50] ended up having a church a massive
[20:51] Church actually about 10,000 people
[20:54] this man had yeah and he would often
[20:55] bring his songs and throughout the
[20:59] services you know as a service would
[21:01] come he would bring out a new song he
[21:03] wrote quite a few maybe not as many as
[21:04] the other guy the other guy was up in
[21:06] the thousands his name was in the
[21:08] hundreds hundreds of songs that he wrote
[21:10] amazing people in very great songs and
[21:16] the other song which he wrote is the one
[21:19] that we've been people have been what's
[21:21] happening about this week that Shannon's
[21:23] something at the pre-meeting what she's
[21:26] gonna do again today and it's called um
[21:28] nothing between my soul and the Savior
[21:30] she's looking at me all funny can you
[21:32] put that up David so this was another
[21:35] one of the songs that the same man wrote
[21:37] that wrote leave at the nothing between
[21:39] my soul and my Savior nought of this
[21:41] world's delusive dream I ever announced
[21:43] all sinful pleasure Jesus as wine
[21:45] there's nothing between and in the
[21:47] chorus there's nothing between my soul
[21:49] and the Savior so that his blessed face
[21:50] may be seen nothing preventing the least
[21:53] of his favor keep the way clear leave
[21:54] nothing between there's a few other
[21:56] verses we can do
[21:57] but such a great such great verses and
[22:00] such great ways that the Lord works you
[22:03] know he was a man that maybe could have
[22:05] been better and all these different
[22:06] things in his life and yet he when we
[22:09] serve the Lord it overrides our
[22:10] circumstances and we can live a
[22:13] victorious life regardless there's no
[22:15] complaints there's no excuses
[22:17] we can live a victorious life and look
[22:19] at the things he's the life that this
[22:20] man lived in out of hard circumstances
[22:24] and what should have made him better but
[22:26] had made him better so well um we can
[22:44] always think that but I want you to come

[43:02] the Lord blesses word you may have your

[43:06] about the power the power of the gospel
[43:09] this gospel has power it's not words
[43:12] it's not just a change in mind there's a
[43:14] power in the word amen a program says
[43:17] this in 1961 he says I'm expecting that
[43:21] the Holy Ghost to come down and see it
[43:22] an order a church that will go to meet
[43:24] him will with the power and the
[43:26] resurrection of Christ I'm expecting me
[43:29] and I believe it God promised it that'll
[43:32] that there'd be a church there without
[43:34] spot or wrinkle on it I'm expecting it
[43:37] because God said sure let's be expecting
[43:40] this be on let's be under expectation oh
[43:42] I expect the church to be on fire the
[43:45] glory of the Lord falling everywhere and
[43:47] centers around the altar people getting
[43:49] saved and filled with the Holy Ghost and
[43:51] just the great thing my anticipations
[43:53] and expect a expectations is built way
[43:56] up high
[43:57] hallelujah now how much more I mean when
[44:01] he had the expectation but how much more
[44:03] now in 2017 rule furnace brittle felt
[44:07] God is pouring out of his holy spirit
[44:09] upon all flesh amen he is gathering his
[44:12] children and there are people around the
[44:14] world that are getting in or any filled
[44:17] with the power of God amen to meet him
[44:20] hallelujah and I trust even when you
[44:22] read that you say that happens to be me
[44:24] I trust when you realize oh hey he's
[44:27] talking about me and 1961 I wasn't even
[44:30] born maybe then but he's talking about
[44:32] me hallelujah but the main thing is is
[44:34] because I'm expecting it because God's
[44:36] it was so I mean and that's exactly what
[44:39] the Bible promises would be here and we
[44:42] happen to be living it out by His grace
[44:44] so this gospel has power now this is 1st
[44:48] Thessalonians 3 maybe if you want to
[44:51] turn or you can read that's fine
[44:52] here remembering without ceasing your
[44:56] works of faith I'm just gonna read it
[44:57] from here so this is this is the this is
[45:01] the Apostle Paul and he says in 1st
[45:05] Thessalonians 1 and 3 it says
[45:08] remembering without ceasing your work of
[45:10] faith and labor of love and patience of
[45:13] Hope in our Lord Jesus Christ in the
[45:15] sight of God and our Father knowing
[45:18] brethren beloved your election of God
[45:20] for our gospel for our gospel came not
[45:30] unto you in word only but also in power
[45:32] and in the Holy Ghost and in much
[45:35] assurance as you know what manner of men
[45:38] we were among you for your sake then we
[45:41] can read 5 verse 6 as well and you
[45:43] became followers of us and of the Lord
[45:45] having received the word in much
[45:47] affliction with joy of the Holy Ghost
[45:50] see saying it doesn't just come with
[45:52] words doesn't come with just
[45:55] intellectual understanding doesn't just
[45:57] come with things being put together very
[45:59] nicely but it comes with power Amen and
[46:03] and the Holy Ghost and the Apostle Paul
[46:05] knew what it was like to put words
[46:07] together very well he knew how to make a
[46:10] very eloquent speech before he met the
[46:12] Lord he was raised under Gamaliel he was
[46:14] a very smart man but that was all burnt
[46:17] out upon the road to Damascus I mean so
[46:19] he knew he says to the Corinthians I
[46:21] came with you not an enticing words of
[46:23] man's wisdom I remember with meekness
[46:24] and trembling and in the power of God
[46:27] hallelujah the here was a man who knew
[46:29] what he was talking about amen that it
[46:31] came with power
[46:32] Allu you and we have been restored the
[46:35] same gospel he preached is alive and
[46:37] well today I'm in the same words this is
[46:39] more than just words this should be a
[46:41] reality to us I mean when we see that
[46:43] the word came to the yoke this this
[46:46] gospel then just come to us in word only
[46:47] he didn't just learn this gospel but
[46:50] there's a power behind it
[46:51] I mean God came and backed up his word
[46:53] and with much assurance Oh blessed
[46:56] assurance Jesus is mine I mean because
[46:58] remember this is not a bunch of
[47:00] doctrines this is a person the word is a
[47:03] person a man doesn't mean
[47:05] to be a love relationship between you
[47:07] and God that's not learning different
[47:08] doctrine unless unless unless he's a
[47:10] person and in if you know the person all
[47:13] the duction will come into place I mean
[47:16] would have thought about learning
[47:17] doctrine I know this unless unless
[47:18] unless do you know him because if you
[47:21] don't know that he won't be there but if
[47:23] you know him you'll be there
[47:24] I mean she must know him this is why it
[47:27] comes with power I mean because when the
[47:30] Lord says I have formed this people for
[47:33] myself this is what God is declaring
[47:37] this people I trust you could say I'm
[47:40] one of them
[47:41] I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them
[47:43] amen i form him for myself so amen and
[47:47] they shall show forth my praise that's
[47:49] why we get so happy when we think about
[47:51] Redemption nothing between my soul and
[47:54] my Savior I'm in this power and the
[47:56] blood there's power in the blood of lamb
[47:58] blessed assurance Jesus is mine don't
[48:01] doesn't just throw your soul when you
[48:02] sing those words I mean because way you
[48:05] shall show forth is praise Amen there's
[48:08] the people built upon your upon the
[48:10] earth that willingly out of a willing
[48:12] heart say I'll serve you Lord I'll
[48:14] praise you God
[48:15] I'll stir into my will to your will they
[48:18] may not become a love prisoner to Jesus
[48:20] Christ I trust you can say that's me I
[48:23] mean cuz God is looking for prisoners
[48:26] and only prisoners will be there
[48:28] amen I want to be a prisoner now this
[48:32] word formed in the English it says
[48:36] through the squeezing into to mold into
[48:40] a form especially a Potter so there's a
[48:42] forming there's a molding that must take
[48:44] place I mean there's going to be you're
[48:46] going to feel that unseen hands of
[48:48] Jehovah take your clay put it on his
[48:51] wheel feel the water a man banzi molds
[48:54] you and shakes you takes the stones and
[48:56] all the things he doesn't want because
[48:58] he wants you to be a perfect vessel then
[49:00] when you get put into the fire you don't
[49:02] blow up I mean because you're gonna be
[49:05] four I remember yeah I classes school
[49:07] since you've got to build it just right
[49:08] otherwise when it goes into the kiln it
[49:10] blows up we don't want to blow up when
[49:12] we go into the kiln because you got to
[49:14] Gombe bread with Holy Ghost and fire
[49:16] I mean you've got to gone to the kill
[49:17] you can't just be a wet piece of off
[49:19] clay on the Shelf you have gone to the
[49:22] farmers present I mean and then you can
[49:24] be used for a service I mean so we don't
[49:27] want to blow up I may take everything
[49:30] out of Hilo that needs to be taken he
[49:32] knows what he's doing so it's got to be
[49:33] a forming going on that's why he called
[49:36] you that's why you know that's why he
[49:39] gets ahold of your life yeah that's why
[49:41] it's you know being a real Christian
[49:43] it's not just accepting something means
[49:46] to lean just walking on it's got to be a
[49:48] death yeah brother Graham preaches on
[49:49] the baptism the Holy Ghost it's been
[49:51] specially their entire service saying
[49:53] you're gonna die and rot and be born
[49:55] again have you listened to their service
[49:57] he's like the whole thing just ladies
[49:58] you're gonna die the seats gonna die
[50:00] you're gonna literally die and the
[50:02] outsides gonna write the she can come
[50:04] forth I mean that's what is the
[50:06] wrestling you got to wrestle with God
[50:08] you can't just say some Creed you know
[50:11] you gotta know now we're gonna go into
[50:17] the forming I know this may be familiar
[50:19] to a lot of you but first John five and
[50:22] six is this here let's just see if you
[50:30] don't mind a bit of Bible reading first
[50:32] John five and six
[50:33] this is he that came by water and blood
[50:36] even Jesus Christ not by water only but
[50:40] by water and blood and it is the spirit
[50:42] that beareth witness because the Spirit
[50:44] is truth and there are three that bear
[50:46] record in heaven the father the word in
[50:50] the holy ghost these three are one and
[50:52] there are three that bear witness in
[50:54] earth the spirit and the water and the
[50:57] blood and these three agree in one no
[51:01] these three are one
[51:03] God is not three persons in a committee
[51:06] three three persons one and purpose
[51:08] whatever they try and fandangled
[51:10] terminate you know your terminology it's
[51:12] one God you believe in one God you do
[51:14] well the devil also believes in trembles
[51:16] she even do well just to believe this
[51:18] one many people do not do well because
[51:20] they believe in three but they are one
[51:23] but in the water the spirit and the
[51:25] water and the blood of theirs the
[51:27] witness on earth these three green
[51:29] this is the three just like a natural
[51:32] baby there's three stages to a birth
[51:34] there's the water breaks in there's
[51:36] blood and then the child the life comes
[51:38] with a child and they cry out their
[51:39] spirit and this constitutes a real new
[51:43] birth that's got its own these three
[51:47] agree in one now this is the molding
[51:49] process you say well how long does it
[51:52] take to go from a sinner to be filled
[51:54] how how quickly do you really want to
[51:56] die it's the goodness of God that
[51:58] leadeth to repentance and because people
[52:01] can be justified by faith and not
[52:03] sanctified and people can be sanctified
[52:05] and not justified but you must be
[52:07] justified sanctified and filled with the
[52:09] Holy Ghost and that's the whole new
[52:11] verse for some people they're sanctified
[52:13] they say well I've never done anything
[52:14] wrong in my life you know I've never
[52:16] done what because they've been cleansed
[52:17] but they've never really recognized they
[52:19] need salvation
[52:20] they've never cried out God I'm lost
[52:23] let's truly some people love it some
[52:25] people just being justified but they're
[52:27] still living an ungodly life they need
[52:29] to be cleansed and set apart for service
[52:30] in filth
[52:32] amen where where are you today because
[52:36] we're all on the subway now notice now
[52:40] this is from future home and notice how
[52:43] God makes plain to us his plan of
[52:45] redemption oh this just through my soul
[52:47] one assert how he makes plain to us here
[52:50] how his plan of redemption now compare
[52:52] what we see with her own eyes what God
[52:54] has done to redeem his world he's done
[52:56] the same to her Dimas people for the
[52:58] unchangeable God changes not in any of
[53:00] his plans or anything such a glorious
[53:02] thing how he leads us to himself who's
[53:05] been led to him amen
[53:08] to a tab in it to be a to a tabernacle
[53:10] in us by three stages of grace just like
[53:13] he led the world in three stages to come
[53:16] to the world as God will come to the
[53:18] world after it's gone through three
[53:20] different stages of purification
[53:21] that's exactly he comes to us through
[53:24] three stages of grace and remember the
[53:27] definition of grace in the New Testament
[53:28] as a divine influence upon the heart and
[53:31] the reflection in the life that's what
[53:33] the word in the Greek means doesn't mean
[53:35] God just just just winks at your Center
[53:37] whatever that's a divine influence upon
[53:39] the heart and it's
[53:40] reflection in the life that's so if
[53:42] someone says I've received the grace of
[53:44] God and will be reflected in the alarm I
[53:46] mean they will be thankful they'll be so
[53:48] glad God you changed my heart you turn
[53:50] me I mean that I can walk with you and
[53:53] it'll be reflected in how they live and
[53:55] how they treat each other and how they
[53:56] treat God that's how you know Grace's
[53:58] come upon you
[53:59] I trust Grace's come upon you if not you
[54:03] just thank God Here I am Here I am mould
[54:07] me and changed me we can't just say
[54:09] Austin you know by grace are you saved
[54:10] yeah God got ahold of you it says grace
[54:13] is as goodness it leads you to
[54:14] repentance and you recognize your lost
[54:16] and undone you call out to him that's
[54:18] God leading and then and then he leads
[54:21] you through a real death amen the akan
[54:23] 4th and Eunice of life amen now in
[54:28] secondly comes this right may have
[54:32] jumped around he says now this secretly
[54:33] comes sanctification which sits out in
[54:36] the mind in order for holiness to think
[54:39] right take away signification as a
[54:41] compound Greek word which means cleanse
[54:43] and set aside for service there next
[54:45] comes the baptism and fire of the holy
[54:47] and Holy Ghost that God might dwell in
[54:50] us and the fire and all cleanses our
[54:52] hearts from sin and puts the Holy Ghost
[54:54] inside then we bring forth the same life
[54:56] that this did because that's enough by
[55:00] your fruits you shall know them it's
[55:02] more than just saying nice things and
[55:04] maybe dressing right amen but a real
[55:06] sanctification remember people people
[55:08] think that you know a real
[55:10] sanctification is not exactly your your
[55:13] ability or you doing it God has to
[55:17] change your heart member we were just
[55:19] like the earth you know Adam and Eve
[55:21] were kicked off the throne Satan took
[55:24] over but then God said I'm going to
[55:27] redeem it I'm going to restore it back
[55:28] and so now the finality of that is God's
[55:32] throne sits upon the earth there's no
[55:34] Devils anywhere there be near be burnt
[55:36] up but his throne sets up upon the earth
[55:39] that's the same thing with you and I
[55:40] when we are born there's the enemy on
[55:43] the throne of our heart and enemies here
[55:45] there's got to be a revolution I mean
[55:48] this coming it's going to be a coup
[55:51] I mean it's got to be a reinstatement of
[55:53] a real king tells me to be there in the
[55:55] first place I mean so that's why it all
[55:58] stems down to who was on the seat of
[56:00] your heart because the scribes and
[56:02] Pharisees they were religious they did
[56:04] all the right kinds of things they
[56:05] quoted the right scripture they are very
[56:07] fundamental but when the very King came
[56:10] to the earth God became flesh he came
[56:12] there King what did they say they didn't
[56:15] say oh host add it to the highest we've
[56:17] been waiting for you to come we knew
[56:19] you'd come this is how you had come
[56:20] glory to God no they said will not have
[56:23] this man rule over us they had another
[56:26] King and in their religion they kept
[56:30] that king but they're ones like the
[56:32] woman at the well I'm gonna bring forth
[56:38] my praise and here she is sleeping
[56:40] around in her darkness then comes the
[56:42] king she says we know where Messiah
[56:44] cometh he'll do these things earlier
[56:46] there was a there's a coup there's a
[56:48] revolution I meant she didn't have that
[56:50] woman problem anymore cuz a new king
[56:53] came on the throne I'm enjoy as a flag
[56:56] flying high from the castle of my heart
[56:57] because the king is in residence here
[56:59] she is not joy kids what the enemy does
[57:05] against you enjoy what other people do
[57:08] joy worries three much tribulation enter
[57:11] into the kingdom of God through hardship
[57:14] and trial I want to be able to stand
[57:16] next to the Apostle Paul I want to say I
[57:18] made my stand in my age what about he
[57:21] made us stand he said he fought with the
[57:22] beasts of Ephesus he was shipwrecked he
[57:24] was beaten here's Rob he was driven out
[57:26] of cities I would have bail the status
[57:29] so I made my stand in my age what about
[57:31] you he had hardship he's here but yet
[57:33] none of these things move me there's a
[57:36] lot of things trying to move him he says
[57:38] I'm gonna stand on this rock and then I
[57:40] know the rock bass you nod off it's
[57:42] Christ hallelujah how about you but
[57:46] depends who's on the throne don't get
[57:49] you know sometimes we do get a bit of
[57:50] shell-shocked but there's a bomb in
[57:52] Gilead I'm in favor of observed lying
[57:56] vanities forsake their own mercies
[57:58] that's what it says in the Book of Jonah
[58:00] anything that happens to you there's not
[58:02] eternal as a line
[58:03] vanity I mean why do we care about how
[58:06] well yo how other people treat us what
[58:08] they say what the will says that is
[58:10] lying vanity because one day I won't
[58:12] even be a memory to just kick it to one
[58:17] side kick it to touch just forget about
[58:19] it
[58:20] because if you observe those things what
[58:22] does it mean to observe you study it I'm
[58:26] observing my hankerchief look his
[58:29] eternal life but I'm observing this this
[58:32] is really a lying vanity doesn't matter
[58:34] that may have tried to kill me multiple
[58:36] times they tried to smother me in my
[58:38] sleep but it's still a lying vanity
[58:41] compared to this and if you observe
[58:44] lying vanities you're forsaking your own
[58:46] mercy I don't want to forsake my own
[58:48] mercy it's my mercy I want it if it's
[58:51] for me I want to have about you I mean
[58:55] it will bring forth the same life that
[58:58] listed a man there is when when God
[59:02] comes and dwells like if I moved into
[59:04] your house and what we mean to be
[59:06] prisoners to him so just say I'm movin
[59:09] to your house you say do what you want
[59:11] in this house
[59:11] eventually you'll see there's a chair
[59:13] moved and maybe a wall will be painted
[59:16] and I'll rearrange things because you
[59:18] say have control and I've moved in
[59:19] you'll know someone's in the house
[59:21] I mean maybe there you know the law and
[59:23] stuff may be changed outside people will
[59:25] drive past what's happened to that place
[59:27] lady they don't like that kind of thing
[59:29] why is it different let's say well
[59:30] because someone else is in this house
[59:32] and it's the same thing with you and God
[59:34] moves into your house I mean he
[59:36] rearranges what he wants to rearrange
[59:37] and people will know people will know
[59:40] yes I was working when I was it unique
[59:43] was that you need far too long but when
[59:45] I was there I was working in a kitchen
[59:46] part-time I meet the Lord in this time
[59:49] in Christine and I get married she works
[59:51] in this kitchen when we first moved to
[59:53] Christchurch for a couple of weeks I
[59:54] don't tell they so the look gets a hold
[59:57] of me I don't tell the shifts and stuff
[59:58] with her there they're still working me
[1:00:00] when Kristi's here for a couple of weeks
[1:00:01] and they say to her we were so happy
[1:00:04] when being meters God Hey because before
[1:00:06] handy is empty alone and upset they saw
[1:00:09] a change I don't have to say no I'm a
[1:00:11] Christian they saw it as a Christian
[1:00:13] shouldn't that be how does that should
[1:00:16] be how does a man what happened to you
[1:00:20] I'll tell you what happy way hallelujah
[1:00:23] Jesus alive notice the natural birth
[1:00:28] when a woman gives birth to a baby the
[1:00:30] natural life types of spiritual life
[1:00:31] when a woman gives birth to a baby the
[1:00:33] natural the first thing happens braking
[1:00:35] of water then blood then the then the
[1:00:37] spirit the life grabs a little fellow
[1:00:39] spank him with away he goes screaming
[1:00:41] water blood spirit and when a baby is
[1:00:44] born to the kingdom of God he comes the
[1:00:45] same way water blood and spirit I mean
[1:00:49] brother Brahim says I think it's it's
[1:00:50] one of the last services he's he
[1:00:52] preaches at SRI port I think it's the
[1:00:55] invisible Union he says people don't
[1:00:57] want crying acts 2:38 youngins around
[1:01:00] miserable creatures the church thinks
[1:01:03] she is Brett but he says that's the only
[1:01:05] kind the word can bring forth and then
[1:01:08] if it brought it forth on the day of
[1:01:09] Pentecost
[1:01:10] it will bring forth when people are
[1:01:12] really burst into the kingdom I mean
[1:01:14] they'll be acts 2:38 Amen screaming
[1:01:17] speaking tongues crying shouting babies
[1:01:19] hallelujah because that's the one that
[1:01:21] the word brings forth
[1:01:23] amen I don't care what Pentecost is made
[1:01:26] of those things they're still a genuine
[1:01:28] I was talking to God last night I see
[1:01:30] God that the skies are full of the
[1:01:32] genuine indi the skies on us full one we
[1:01:38] want some substitute of some conformity
[1:01:41] to a good behavior or some saying the
[1:01:43] right thing you can take that I don't
[1:01:45] want that why can't we have the junior
[1:01:48] he says the Pentecostal skies are full
[1:01:50] of the genuine and Pentecost is an
[1:01:53] experience it's a real experience we
[1:01:55] must have that experience
[1:01:57] and I believe this cuz it happened to me
[1:02:00] now notice sanctification oh I see it's
[1:02:04] the second stage of it cleanses the mind
[1:02:06] six the heart the mind the heart and
[1:02:08] order of holiness so a man can repent of
[1:02:11] sins and still thinking of maybe he's an
[1:02:13] immoral man every immoral looking woman
[1:02:15] he finds he's still there
[1:02:17] maybe he's a drunkard every time he
[1:02:19] smells a drink it's still there see but
[1:02:21] when he gets sanctified that cleanses
[1:02:23] that desire out of him see it takes the
[1:02:26] want of it away he can still be tempted
[1:02:28] but it takes the want of it away still
[1:02:31] he's not right yet amen
[1:02:34] you must be justified you must be
[1:02:36] sanctified but you're not there you're
[1:02:39] on your way you're on your way then he
[1:02:42] is baptized with the Holy Ghost and fire
[1:02:44] cleanse burn out cleaned up and then put
[1:02:47] in the service of God sanctification
[1:02:49] only sets him aside for service just
[1:02:52] like when the what your the parable of
[1:02:54] the wise and foolish virgin they were
[1:02:56] sanctified all ten of them were
[1:02:58] sanctified that come up to
[1:03:00] sanctification they were clean living
[1:03:02] according to the word this is a message
[1:03:05] realms by the way they were living
[1:03:07] according to the word but only half them
[1:03:09] had the Holy Ghost
[1:03:11] only half them were not just set aside
[1:03:14] for service they were in service because
[1:03:16] the God himself the oil represents the
[1:03:18] Holy Ghost himself I mean so because
[1:03:21] it's so it's not it's good to be
[1:03:23] cleansed and he does the cleansing but
[1:03:25] you've got to say God take the desire
[1:03:26] out of my life and stay there till he
[1:03:28] changes you amen of course you're gonna
[1:03:31] be tempted but when he takes the desire
[1:03:33] as I've said I could live in a brewery
[1:03:35] but I'd be sober every day of my life
[1:03:37] not a single drop of that beer would be
[1:03:39] drunk and it was a part time I used to
[1:03:41] brew the stuff but he took the desire
[1:03:44] out of me I'm not afraid of alcohol I'm
[1:03:47] not afraid of I'm not afraid of
[1:03:49] Hollywood I'm not afraid of
[1:03:50] rock-and-roll music I'm not afraid of
[1:03:52] movies or whatever because of desire
[1:03:55] where's the gone I don't know
[1:03:56] not gonna find it that was buried
[1:03:59] someplace I don't care I don't even
[1:04:01] worry where the grave is it's gone
[1:04:03] that's all that I'm worried about where
[1:04:06] did it go I don't know end of story
[1:04:07] let's move on all I know is gone hey man
[1:04:12] so now but that's why now we must go
[1:04:15] from just being sanctified to God comes
[1:04:18] and dwells on us because when God comes
[1:04:20] and dwells on us he gives us a life of
[1:04:22] power overcoming power amen are more
[1:04:26] than just more than just taking the
[1:04:28] desire out but you see you we have to go
[1:04:31] back to the pattern look at the book of
[1:04:33] Acts everything that came against them
[1:04:36] God raised the standard and they
[1:04:38] overcame does that right you know the
[1:04:41] enemy said don't preach in his name
[1:04:42] anymore they beat them they were
[1:04:44] rejoicing earlier than they had a prayer
[1:04:47] meeting and God came down and took all
[1:04:49] the complex and that pressure out of
[1:04:50] their lives and they went forth with
[1:04:52] boldness to combat what the enemy was
[1:04:54] doing and that's the same thing we
[1:04:56] really need to do amen is actually when
[1:04:58] the enemy tries to give a complex
[1:05:00] against you don't just try and
[1:05:02] compartmentalize it and put a tag on it
[1:05:04] but have a prayer meeting until God
[1:05:06] comes down because that same God that
[1:05:08] was there is still here and then had
[1:05:10] come down and break the complex I mean
[1:05:12] that's the only way can be overcome
[1:05:14] otherwise you're carrying around
[1:05:16] something you know me to carry I'm not
[1:05:19] meant to carry some kind of burden like
[1:05:21] that why do I want to carry the devil's
[1:05:24] mail he can have his own couriers I'm
[1:05:26] like I'm not working for me I mean I got
[1:05:30] fired now I quit
[1:05:31] Kahlua and I didn't care about
[1:05:33] redundancy by the way amen now taking
[1:05:38] Peter three and four
[1:05:46] they see is here this so brother BAM
[1:05:50] takes listen a bit more with the when
[1:05:52] he's preaching about future home he's
[1:05:57] saying well let's go from verse three no
[1:06:00] I must first that there shall come in
[1:06:02] the last days scoffers walking in their
[1:06:04] own lusts and saying where is the
[1:06:06] promise of his coming for since the
[1:06:08] father's fell asleep all things continue
[1:06:09] as they were from the beginning of the
[1:06:12] creation people still say that today
[1:06:14] where is the promise of us coming and we
[1:06:19] could be gone tomorrow all right now
[1:06:20] I'll take us out off the world Jesus for
[1:06:25] this there willingly are ignorant of
[1:06:26] that by the Word of God the heavens were
[1:06:29] of old and the earth standing out of the
[1:06:31] water in the water whereby the world
[1:06:33] that then was being overflowed with
[1:06:35] water perished amen let's just keep
[1:06:42] reading but the heavens the heavens and
[1:06:44] the earth which are now by the same word
[1:06:46] are kept in store reserved unto fire
[1:06:48] against the day of judgment and the
[1:06:51] perdition of ungodly men but beloved be
[1:06:54] not ignorant of this one thing that one
[1:06:55] day is with the Lord as a thousand years
[1:06:57] and a thousand years is one day the Lord
[1:07:00] is not slack concerning his promise as
[1:07:02] some men count slackness our God is not
[1:07:04] slack in this thing our God is busy I've
[1:07:07] got is very busy all around the world he
[1:07:09] is working he is finding his children he
[1:07:12] is four million to bring for this praise
[1:07:13] God is busy in the same time I mean cuz
[1:07:17] he he said I'll do a quick short work
[1:07:18] upon the earth and we happen to be
[1:07:20] living in that Kwik shop work fine
[1:07:22] I mean God is moving in a powerful way
[1:07:24] all around the world hello yeah like I
[1:07:27] heard testimony from I think brother
[1:07:30] Bram I don't know how many people he
[1:07:31] raised in this ministry I think maybe
[1:07:32] five or six or may be wrong
[1:07:34] and then there's believers I think it
[1:07:36] was in Ghana they had a convention and I
[1:07:38] said how many of you have been raised
[1:07:39] from the dead in this country forty-one
[1:07:41] people stood up well it bonafide raised
[1:07:45] from the dead so I was in one man now
[1:07:49] the same spirits everywhere doing the
[1:07:51] same thing and doing greater because
[1:07:53] it's in a multi mean but bodies it is
[1:07:55] one
[1:07:55] just like Jesus he didn't you know just
[1:07:58] in one man they went to 120 the same
[1:08:00] life the same way of spread around
[1:08:02] hallelujah and it did more more one
[1:08:04] started in the body of the Southwest but
[1:08:05] it's more when he caught diffused out
[1:08:07] and she just being in one ministry I
[1:08:12] mean so now I'm glad he's alive aren't
[1:08:16] you
[1:08:17] we're by the world now so so the world
[1:08:21] so as just as it's three stages to our
[1:08:24] birth we were appeared to be baptized
[1:08:26] name the Lord Jesus Christ remission of
[1:08:28] sin that was like in the days of Noah
[1:08:30] the world was baptized but sin came
[1:08:32] through over the ark right to the world
[1:08:35] so I was all washed off but sin still
[1:08:37] came through and people can repent Umi
[1:08:39] baptize and be justified but there's
[1:08:40] still a sin nature in them and then now
[1:08:43] when Jesus died upon the earth his blood
[1:08:46] sanctified us and sanctified the earth
[1:08:48] laying claim upon us he says by the
[1:08:51] which will we are sanctified through the
[1:08:53] offering of the body of Jesus Christ
[1:08:54] once for all and every priest stands
[1:08:57] daily ministering and offering
[1:08:58] oftentimes the same sacrifices which can
[1:09:01] never take away sins Amen it's only by
[1:09:05] his blood son can be taken away I mean
[1:09:08] but this man after he had offered one
[1:09:10] sacrifice for sins forever
[1:09:12] sat down on the right hand of God so we
[1:09:15] are sanctified by his sacrifice his
[1:09:17] blood sanctifies us hallelujah and
[1:09:20] winning in where he poured his blood out
[1:09:22] upon me oh it was laying claim to it
[1:09:24] this belongs to me and everyone that
[1:09:27] will come out of the earth they belong
[1:09:29] to me hallelujah so here's laying claim
[1:09:31] because you member this thing is part of
[1:09:33] the earth this was once this was once
[1:09:35] soil or plants or animals this thing is
[1:09:37] part of the earth so when his blood fell
[1:09:39] upon the earth he is like claim to you
[1:09:41] how many said there is a people that
[1:09:43] will come forth maybe two thousand years
[1:09:45] later he knew when I was going to be
[1:09:47] they belong to me Satan take your hands
[1:09:50] o from henceforth expecting till his
[1:09:53] enemies be made his footstool for by one
[1:09:55] offering he has perfected forever them
[1:09:57] that are sanctified Alleluia hello
[1:10:00] sanctified ones the word Saint means
[1:10:02] sanctified one I mean but then of course
[1:10:06] when he gave us life there's still sin
[1:10:09] here but then of course there'll be the
[1:10:11] new heavens and new earth and all the
[1:10:13] devils and everything will be burned off
[1:10:15] this place will be vaporized I mean all
[1:10:17] the Devils so everything in this realm
[1:10:19] and the unseen is going to be burnt off
[1:10:21] and a new heavens and new earth it's
[1:10:23] gonna be set upon I mean it's not so
[1:10:26] that new that the word new heavens
[1:10:27] doesn't mean it's going to be a brand
[1:10:29] new one it's actually the same one being
[1:10:32] renovated but says it shall pass away
[1:10:34] maybe we haven't even got to that year
[1:10:35] let's read verse 10 in second Peter 3
[1:10:37] but the day the Lord shall come as a
[1:10:39] thief in the night and which the heavens
[1:10:42] shall pass away with a great noise and
[1:10:43] the elements shall melt with fervent
[1:10:45] heat the earth also and the works that
[1:10:48] are therein shall be burned up seeing
[1:10:51] then that all these things shall be
[1:10:53] dissolved what manner of persons ought
[1:10:55] ye to be an all holy conversation and
[1:10:58] godliness looking for and hasting unto
[1:11:01] the coming of the day of of God wherein
[1:11:03] the heavens shall be on fire shall be
[1:11:06] dissolved and the elements shall melt
[1:11:07] with fervent heat nevertheless we
[1:11:10] according to us promise look for new
[1:11:12] heavens and new earth
[1:11:13] we're in dwelleth righteousness
[1:11:16] hallelujah so cease winner shall pass
[1:11:18] away that word is actually the same word
[1:11:20] where Jesus tells - you know when
[1:11:22] Lazarus is raised from the dead he says
[1:11:24] lucemon let him go that word loose is
[1:11:26] the same word as passway changing I mean
[1:11:29] take off his grave clothes the man is
[1:11:31] still the same only so but take out the
[1:11:32] outside and it's same with the earth the
[1:11:34] earth will still be here but this stuff
[1:11:36] and although this is going to become
[1:11:38] vapor it's gonna be this place is going
[1:11:41] to be burnt up and I say glory to God
[1:11:44] could it happen now I want to be taken
[1:11:46] away amen I want to walk on streets of
[1:11:49] gold don't you don't you want to see
[1:11:52] that permit City and we'll live in that
[1:11:55] place and time is no more an eternity
[1:11:57] Rosana hallelujah we'd have no sickness
[1:12:00] or pain or sorry or bad so bad day you
[1:12:03] can't wake up on the wrong side of the
[1:12:05] bed I don't think we sleep but you can't
[1:12:07] wake up on the wrong side those only the
[1:12:09] good side of the beam that sides done
[1:12:11] away with don't you want that don't you
[1:12:14] want to go to heaven
[1:12:16] amen so now what's the same with us he
[1:12:20] does the same thing now and from Jesus
[1:12:24] Christ I just like this and from Jesus
[1:12:26] Christ who is the faithful witness the
[1:12:28] first forgotten of the Dead and the
[1:12:29] Prince of the kings of the earth and to
[1:12:31] him that loved us and washed us from our
[1:12:34] sins in his own blood and if made us
[1:12:36] kings and priests unto God and his
[1:12:38] father to him be glory and Dominion for
[1:12:40] ever and ever amen amen so he is look he
[1:12:44] loved us under him that loved us and
[1:12:46] washed us I mean from our sins in his
[1:12:49] own blood
[1:12:50] Bholu yes weird a dirty government we
[1:12:52] were a dirty government and then he
[1:12:54] washed us hallelujah and there's no
[1:12:56] stain there's no residue
[1:12:58] hallelujah because of yo your brother
[1:13:01] BAM talks about the blood being like a
[1:13:02] bucket of bleach and you drop an ink
[1:13:04] you're a drop of ink into that bucket he
[1:13:07] says it breaks down and I don't know how
[1:13:09] worked for he says he sees the ink
[1:13:10] becomes bleach Peleliu you can't find it
[1:13:13] anymore it's the same thing when sinners
[1:13:15] truly confessed into the blood of Jesus
[1:13:18] Christ amen you can't find it why would
[1:13:21] you want to dig it up glad you got our
[1:13:22] memories or such a we waste many times
[1:13:25] we think about the wrong thing we think
[1:13:27] about the bad side I mean you think
[1:13:29] about the good side the devil says
[1:13:31] remember when you did listen you thought
[1:13:32] this and you did this and you did this
[1:13:33] and did this you should just go back to
[1:13:35] the hold on
[1:13:36] that's not the whole story as brother
[1:13:38] Quadra preached here last year to be
[1:13:40] continues turn the page there we'll turn
[1:13:42] the page oh look I confessed it and it
[1:13:45] was made right and it's gone we've been
[1:13:49] washed I mean because God lays claim and
[1:13:52] what he lays claim doing they're coming
[1:13:56] in with these no more disputes nothing
[1:13:59] can stop him claiming his own oh wait we
[1:14:01] had it there I mean see what then what
[1:14:06] manner of persons ought way to be an all
[1:14:07] holy conversation and godliness
[1:14:09] now to me one you can take this as as
[1:14:12] living in fear or you can take it as joy
[1:14:15] and speak more full of glory because God
[1:14:18] is not slack concerning his promise
[1:14:19] I mean God has not slack it's going to
[1:14:22] happen hallelujah so if you think about
[1:14:24] it then this is all going to pass wear
[1:14:26] and burn up
[1:14:28] because remember faith brings the
[1:14:29] promise it takes it from far away and
[1:14:31] faith brings have promised you where you
[1:14:32] are now
[1:14:33] I mean faith speaks on this way the word
[1:14:37] is nigh thee even in thy mouth in thy
[1:14:38] heart that's why it says in Romans so
[1:14:40] the faith faith brings our promise close
[1:14:42] so now when we read this kind of promise
[1:14:44] that the world's going to be burnt up
[1:14:46] new heavens and new earth things are
[1:14:47] going to pass away
[1:14:48] you know I say Lord I want nothing
[1:14:52] between my soul and my Savior I would
[1:14:55] have more belong to you can I belong to
[1:14:57] you more Lord only totally hundred
[1:14:59] million for senior but if you had to
[1:15:01] proceed hallelujah because he's doing
[1:15:03] this because he's going to burn it off
[1:15:06] because we're gonna live here amen
[1:15:10] nevertheless amen we've already read
[1:15:12] this so he says now and it's like now
[1:15:16] when the Holy Ghost and fire comes you
[1:15:18] say well how can that be
[1:15:20] when you receive the Holy Ghost now
[1:15:23] brother Brown talks about there's a is
[1:15:26] the Battle of Armageddon which is a
[1:15:27] nuclear war yeah right dinner is the
[1:15:29] millennium then there's the new heavens
[1:15:32] and new earth and yeah I mean then
[1:15:33] there's where this happens right so now
[1:15:36] it's like us now when the Holy Ghost
[1:15:39] comes into us amen the enemy is pushed
[1:15:43] away that it's like a millennium where
[1:15:45] the enemy is bound he should be banned
[1:15:47] from your life of God as unusually sure
[1:15:50] he wars against you but there should be
[1:15:51] an overcoming power and then there
[1:15:53] should be a power on you but this body
[1:15:55] hasn't changed this body has to change
[1:15:57] Rice's like the earth has to change but
[1:16:00] it's after the Millennium with is the
[1:16:01] burning of everything it's not a nuclear
[1:16:04] war does anybody understand what I'm
[1:16:06] saying I mean they should be when the
[1:16:08] Holy Ghost comes into us we have power
[1:16:11] to overcome amen we have power to
[1:16:14] overcome we are not blind we're not
[1:16:15] ignorant of the devil's devices I'm in
[1:16:18] but there comes a genuine power in you
[1:16:20] and I wear whatever he comes against us
[1:16:22] worth we shall overcome
[1:16:24] amen it says it says in Psalms 91 we
[1:16:28] will trample on the dragon and upon the
[1:16:31] young lion early we will trample upon
[1:16:33] the head of the enemy it says that
[1:16:37] yeah now let's go to Ezekiel 36 a little
[1:16:41] bit I trust this is straightforward you
[1:16:48] need power if you don't you know if
[1:16:51] there's a constant war you need power
[1:16:56] it's not meant to be a stalemate
[1:16:59] shouldn't be a stalemate should be a
[1:17:01] victory after victory I mean we're not
[1:17:05] here just a just to fight trench warfare
[1:17:08] build up our build up our defenses and
[1:17:11] build our bunkers and dig them deeper
[1:17:13] and go underground and build concrete
[1:17:15] and try we'll just outlast this we're
[1:17:17] just going to out survive this campaign
[1:17:18] now we're not meeting to sit there and a
[1:17:20] siege mentality I mean but you know
[1:17:23] we're cool to do like a blitzkrieg let's
[1:17:25] take the enemy's ground I mean doesn't
[1:17:27] matter what it is sometimes you're the
[1:17:29] biggest enemy you have and you've got to
[1:17:31] die but but don't just sit there and say
[1:17:33] well this is how does this has been this
[1:17:35] way for years this traversing this
[1:17:36] becomes a time where things come to an
[1:17:39] end and you're gonna be willing to say
[1:17:42] well Lord I don't want to continue this
[1:17:44] way why should we live below our
[1:17:47] privilege why should we let the devil's
[1:17:50] lying vanities dictate to us how we live
[1:17:52] in how we treat others why should we
[1:17:54] that's living below your privilege why
[1:17:57] would you be if you are if you're a
[1:17:59] prince in the palace why would you say
[1:18:00] no I think I'm gonna live in a cowboy
[1:18:02] box on the street because that's what
[1:18:04] people actually deciding and and their
[1:18:06] Christian walk by living under privilege
[1:18:08] I say now I don't want that I'll take
[1:18:10] this I'll pull me this is horrible
[1:18:12] I've been helping this for years and
[1:18:14] they and they worship their own
[1:18:15] situation instead of worshipping the God
[1:18:18] that can deliver them from you
[1:18:21] for I will take you we're in Ezekiel 36
[1:18:24] for I'll take you from among the heathen
[1:18:27] now I trust you can say he's talking
[1:18:29] about me because when I read this I'm
[1:18:32] not I'm not saying that as a joke you
[1:18:34] should be able to see yourself a little
[1:18:35] scripture this is personal for I'll take
[1:18:38] you from among the heathen and get you
[1:18:40] out of all countries and bring you into
[1:18:42] your own land bring you to your own
[1:18:44] inheritance
[1:18:44] I have men bring you to your own land
[1:18:46] and we've been brought then I'll
[1:18:49] sprinkle clean water upon you he'll wash
[1:18:51] you and you shall be clean from all your
[1:18:54] filthiness and from all your idols will
[1:18:56] I cleanse you has he has he preached out
[1:18:59] the temple taking all the idols out of
[1:19:01] the temple out of here as it cleanses
[1:19:03] them as you cured it down i trusting
[1:19:05] hairs because if there's an idol you
[1:19:07] know no idol can be a little thing just
[1:19:08] sit there yeah get rid of the thing you
[1:19:13] know it was like I think I may be wrong
[1:19:15] but what are the South American Empire
[1:19:16] of the Incas or the S nothing as the
[1:19:18] Incas big massive temple complex they go
[1:19:21] up and these just this little wooden
[1:19:22] statue of a God in this big temple and
[1:19:27] they worship somehow this sometimes it's
[1:19:30] like us with this little bitterness this
[1:19:32] little resentment against someone and
[1:19:34] that thing is just like basically in
[1:19:36] front of you all the time and you're
[1:19:37] walking around and and you see everyone
[1:19:40] through this little Idol yeah may not
[1:19:42] even be there for it can be such a small
[1:19:44] thing and because you know people pack
[1:19:48] their idols with them oh this man did
[1:19:50] this to me and he carries around
[1:20:03] and you don't know what they did to me
[1:20:04] here's Jesus on the cross Father forgive
[1:20:07] them they don't know what they do and
[1:20:10] they had meetings and they strategized
[1:20:12] it and they planned it and then Judas
[1:20:14] gave him the ability and they said now
[1:20:16] that you now let's execute our plan and
[1:20:19] they could have they could have they
[1:20:24] could have said when he's on the cross
[1:20:25] they could have said well done boys that
[1:20:27] worked and he's there saying forgive
[1:20:30] them they don't know what they know now
[1:20:32] humanly you say they planned this they
[1:20:34] knew what they were doing but they
[1:20:36] didn't know people come against you
[1:20:38] believers unbelievers make believers
[1:20:40] what it doesn't matter who they are
[1:20:42] don't categorize people who cares what
[1:20:45] are you gonna do with it Oh give me more
[1:20:48] bitterness No take this cup what way we
[1:20:51] don't have to drink oh you know just
[1:20:52] just let this root of Brutus you know
[1:20:54] you're a garden you know you're a guy -
[1:20:56] no she's in Song of Solomon coming to
[1:20:58] your garden we're a garden know some
[1:21:02] people you know you look at their
[1:21:04] gardens and there's beautiful fruits and
[1:21:06] veggies at all yeah well what an amazing
[1:21:08] garden and then and then and then
[1:21:11] there's other ones where it's just I
[1:21:12] don't know what tree makes goodness
[1:21:14] pistol goodness same ground what a way
[1:21:20] you don't want to eat this I hear we're
[1:21:22] gonna harvest it's gonna be great
[1:21:24] that's gonna be better but it's my
[1:21:27] garden this is me well why would you why
[1:21:30] would you let it grow where's the joy
[1:21:33] the Lord God
[1:21:35] where is the peace that passes all
[1:21:37] understanding because it's just like
[1:21:39] because many times we leave Jesus
[1:21:41] somewhere we're walking on our journey
[1:21:44] and we leave them somewhere and then you
[1:21:46] say well what's happened to me where's
[1:21:48] my first love gone
[1:21:50] where's my joy gone where where's the
[1:21:52] place where you don't care about here
[1:21:54] and all you care about is him you know
[1:21:56] that place your kiss who cares about
[1:21:57] what other people do and saying Lord all
[1:22:00] I care about is you and then you got to
[1:22:03] go back and find him because where you
[1:22:04] left him that's where you find them and
[1:22:06] many times people will come along and
[1:22:08] they'll do things against you it makes
[1:22:10] you drop them and you keep walking but
[1:22:12] now you're holding this bitterness in
[1:22:13] front of you for I will cleanse you this
[1:22:23] is the Lord's doing you've just got to
[1:22:25] be willing to stay on his wheel stay
[1:22:28] still until he changes you and you had
[1:22:31] also will I give you in a new spirit
[1:22:33] while I put within you and I'll take
[1:22:35] away the holy the stony heart out of
[1:22:38] your flesh now some people they're so
[1:22:39] hard no I won't change I know you know
[1:22:41] they've got a heart of stone why get rid
[1:22:45] of it you're gonna be willing member God
[1:22:47] doesn't force anything against your own
[1:22:49] world he you have to say yes Lord
[1:22:52] if you don't say yes Lord you'll stay as
[1:22:54] you are because he's a gentleman and
[1:22:58] maybe you know at no days thinking in
[1:23:00] his mind I have the bomb I can so I can
[1:23:03] do a perfect I can fix you perfectly
[1:23:05] just let me know Lord and it's normally
[1:23:10] pride or a fence and people will hold
[1:23:15] back I said lord I think it was our they
[1:23:18] are quote I think it's Keith green well
[1:23:21] he said I want a heart with skin that's
[1:23:25] like baby skin
[1:23:25] I want a soft heart I don't want a heart
[1:23:28] and heart I thought Lord I agree I want
[1:23:32] a baby skin I want to have a soft heart
[1:23:34] because I may have a soft heart he can
[1:23:36] change your mold you and change your
[1:23:38] affections and mold you know he can
[1:23:40] govern you and work with you but notice
[1:23:44] so he says I'll do this
[1:23:46] but me people stop there with a new
[1:23:48] spirit a new heart
[1:23:50] girls done a great work he has and I'll
[1:23:54] put my spirit within you that is where
[1:23:56] where we must be then I'll put my spirit
[1:24:00] within you to cause you to walk in my
[1:24:02] statutes and you shall keep my judgments
[1:24:04] and do them why does some people try to
[1:24:07] keep the wood and there are nobility but
[1:24:09] the real believer God puts his spirit in
[1:24:11] them there's a power and maybe when the
[1:24:14] Holy Ghost comes into a people is a
[1:24:15] power to keep us wordless statutes and
[1:24:18] walk in them and do them hallelujah and
[1:24:20] that's what we must have is that it's
[1:24:22] not you being the Christian God becomes
[1:24:24] a Christian in you it's no longer I that
[1:24:26] liveth but Christ liveth in me
[1:24:28] Rickon yourself dead or alive in Christ
[1:24:30] that's what you've got to do and if you
[1:24:33] are dead and alive in Christ then his
[1:24:35] word he will live out of you if it's if
[1:24:38] it's prophecy or healing or miracles or
[1:24:40] whatever it may be a character of nature
[1:24:42] will be will be manifested hallelujah
[1:24:45] see I'm so glad at some doing it and ye
[1:24:49] shall dwell in the land that I gave to
[1:24:51] your father's this is our land our
[1:24:53] inheritance in Christ well they're just
[1:24:55] words on a in a book and you shall be my
[1:24:58] people and I will be your God who wants
[1:25:01] that that's what I want to be I want to
[1:25:04] be his people and I want him to be my
[1:25:07] god this gives you power you see the
[1:25:11] believers all the way from Genesis to
[1:25:13] Revelation they overcame him they
[1:25:15] overcame the enemy whatever the enemy
[1:25:17] did against them they didn't let it
[1:25:19] overcome them I mean they had overcoming
[1:25:22] to him that overcometh will I grant and
[1:25:25] then in this age we know all the
[1:25:26] promises all the curses from every age
[1:25:28] you know snowballs to this age we says
[1:25:30] to him that overcometh in this age well
[1:25:33] I grant to sit in my throne as I sat
[1:25:35] down with my father in his throne so sit
[1:25:37] down you'll sit down with me and my
[1:25:39] Dominion hallelujah
[1:25:41] and thus now I say don't just look to
[1:25:43] the Millenium for that Dominion there's
[1:25:45] a Dominion today amen let's go to
[1:25:47] revelations chapter 12
[1:25:49] it's just let's just read a bit there is
[1:25:55] power wonder-working power in the blood
[1:25:57] of the Lamb
[1:25:58] there is absolute power amen there's
[1:26:02] nothing the blood of Jesus Christ is
[1:26:04] never insufficient it can't there's
[1:26:07] never a circumstance that could not fix
[1:26:09] Amen he says it remember there was war
[1:26:14] let's just read revelations 12 and 12
[1:26:17] and 7 and there was war in heaven
[1:26:20] Michael and his angels fought against
[1:26:21] the Dragon and the dragon fought and his
[1:26:24] angels and prevailed not neither was
[1:26:26] their place found any more in heaven and
[1:26:28] the Great Dragon was cast out that old
[1:26:31] serpent called the devil and Satan which
[1:26:32] deceiveth the whole world he was cast
[1:26:34] out into the earth and his angels were
[1:26:37] cast out with him so there was a war in
[1:26:39] heaven jesus said I saw the devil fall
[1:26:41] like him like lightning from heaven so
[1:26:44] there was war in heaven and the devil
[1:26:46] was cast out now that war has come upon
[1:26:48] the earth right and then I heard a loud
[1:26:51] voice saying in heaven now is come
[1:26:52] salvation and strength and the power of
[1:26:54] our God I mean that's how the Kingdom of
[1:26:56] our God the power of us Christ for the
[1:26:59] accuser of our brethren is cast down
[1:27:00] which accused them before our God day
[1:27:02] and night now now the battles come now
[1:27:05] he lost in heaven now the battles down
[1:27:08] here we're going to see how's it going
[1:27:09] to pan out for you Satan and they
[1:27:11] overcame him by the blood of the Lamb
[1:27:13] and by the word of their testimony and
[1:27:16] they loved not their lives unto the
[1:27:18] death therefore rejoice are ye heavens
[1:27:21] and ye that dwell on them work to the
[1:27:22] inhabitants of the earth and to the sea
[1:27:24] for the devil has come down unto you
[1:27:26] having great wrath because he knoweth
[1:27:28] that he hath but a short time so the
[1:27:30] same life that was in heaven cast out
[1:27:33] the devil and then and then now the
[1:27:35] devil's cast out and God chases them
[1:27:37] down to the earth I mean it comes and
[1:27:39] dwells and his people and they fight the
[1:27:41] battle again and the Devils catch it
[1:27:43] again and because the same God that cast
[1:27:45] them out up here it's causing him out
[1:27:47] down here hallelujah
[1:27:50] that the enemy has no dominion of the
[1:27:51] people of God that's the same God the
[1:27:54] devil would know what I say I've seen
[1:27:55] this one before how the look I've seen
[1:27:57] this one before I can't escape this one
[1:28:00] hallelujah is now rockin flee hallelujah
[1:28:04] the same God let's what it does and so
[1:28:06] you say well how's that so well the
[1:28:08] devil was cast out of your life I mean
[1:28:11] once you're a slave you're no longer a
[1:28:13] slave I mean once you were dictated to
[1:28:16] by what he told you to do but now he's
[1:28:18] under your feet who you are crushed
[1:28:20] that's your case I mention the devil was
[1:28:22] cast out there when he gets cast out
[1:28:24] here amen and now there's are people
[1:28:26] that have been formed
[1:28:28] amen to bring forth his praise
[1:28:30] hallelujah amen and here we are I trust
[1:28:37] I trust you say well as that power that
[1:28:41] is absolute power that's absolute power
[1:28:48] friends there's power in this word
[1:28:50] don't let anyone try and tell you
[1:28:52] otherwise don't let anyone tell you the
[1:28:54] day of miracles has passed there's more
[1:28:56] miracles today than they were when ever
[1:28:58] amen there is not the same God he is the
[1:29:02] same yesterday today and forever amen
[1:29:05] and only the devil try and tell you
[1:29:07] otherwise I mean what he said well used
[1:29:10] to 20 30 years ago you still used to do
[1:29:12] great things
[1:29:13] what about today I mean what about today
[1:29:15] because they see it's like with David
[1:29:17] you know hey he killed the lion he
[1:29:20] killed the bear it killed Goliath and
[1:29:22] then he came to a CERN and he took the
[1:29:24] whole kingdom the same God that was with
[1:29:27] him back there was with him at the end I
[1:29:29] mean he didn't use a sling all the way
[1:29:31] three just use this twice or three times
[1:29:34] rather but then after that he used to
[1:29:35] saw I mean God God was equipping him to
[1:29:38] tell him I'm not a cookie cat I'm gonna
[1:29:39] lead you through every battle I'll lead
[1:29:42] you through every trial because we have
[1:29:44] to unfortunately we will be tried by
[1:29:46] every spirit in the world every spirit
[1:29:49] we'll try you either if it's pride
[1:29:51] mining woman popularity you know
[1:29:54] whatever it is religious spirits I'm in
[1:29:57] lust spurts whatever it is it will come
[1:29:59] and try you it will come and attack you
[1:30:02] I mean but God has his salvation will
[1:30:05] never come up insufficient funds I mean
[1:30:08] but you will be tried bitterness
[1:30:10] hardship disagreements whatever it may
[1:30:13] be it will come and try you amen but do
[1:30:16] you have I trust you have the
[1:30:18] wherewithal
[1:30:18] I have what I need to overcome every
[1:30:21] trial I am every Valley every Hill every
[1:30:23] whatever it is I can overcome it because
[1:30:26] I can do all things through Christ Jesus
[1:30:29] which strengthens me how we're gonna get
[1:30:32] through this one well how'd you get
[1:30:33] through the last one when he lead me
[1:30:35] through well he'll leave me turned out
[1:30:36] how am I gonna get through that's what
[1:30:37] all this was a closed great let's just
[1:30:39] keep walking
[1:30:40] just keep walking doesn't matter
[1:30:42] remember it's you and him as it you know
[1:30:46] it's not you him and the guy attacking
[1:30:48] you are you him in the sister attacking
[1:30:51] you are you him in the disagreement with
[1:30:53] someone else that's not you walking
[1:30:55] together I didn't sign up in the Lord
[1:30:57] because it's an unconditional covenant
[1:30:59] when he came to me and said take my yoke
[1:31:02] upon me I've been upon you I'm in and
[1:31:05] I'll give you a rest
[1:31:06] it wasn't take my yoke upon you and then
[1:31:10] sort it out with all these other people
[1:31:12] that will come along and will attack you
[1:31:14] and come against you no it's just me and
[1:31:17] him
[1:31:17] there's nothing between my soul and my
[1:31:19] Savior the devil will try and put
[1:31:21] something between you and home amen
[1:31:24] put bitterness or hardship or
[1:31:26] unforgiveness whatever will be he'll try
[1:31:29] and reach something in there because if
[1:31:31] the devil can keep you from the life
[1:31:33] maybe there's one baptism but many
[1:31:35] fillings I just won sealing but many
[1:31:38] fillings and you see you see in the book
[1:31:40] of Acts he came down God came down the
[1:31:42] day of Pentecost but there many times
[1:31:44] that says they are filled with the Holy
[1:31:45] Ghost again hallelujah God drove out all
[1:31:49] the works the enemy out of their lives
[1:31:51] Gouri you say well that was back then
[1:31:54] he's the same God today we should expect
[1:31:57] the same things
[1:31:58] I mean if we've been restored to the
[1:32:00] original faith and that's how the
[1:32:01] original faith produced then oh god we
[1:32:03] thank you here it is amen
[1:32:07] but if the devil can keep you from that
[1:32:09] life and take you down some side road
[1:32:12] you just you're all you're doing it was
[1:32:14] observing lying benefits your faith your
[1:32:17] forsaking your own mercy I want to walk
[1:32:23] with him
[1:32:23] not worried about anyone else who's your
[1:32:26] god is it your memory of something that
[1:32:29] happened to you years ago
[1:32:30] because sometimes people walk and it's a
[1:32:34] memory they're haunted by a memory and
[1:32:37] how someone treated them and what
[1:32:39] someone said and they're walking
[1:32:41] according to that maybe they're young
[1:32:43] maybe they're old you know goddess God
[1:32:49] can forgive he can forget he said well
[1:32:54] why can't we forget you ever go and
[1:32:55] bring healing to that place I mean he
[1:32:58] can bring healing to that place where
[1:33:00] you're not a captive to a memory or a
[1:33:02] situation but when you come to them and
[1:33:06] you be healed of Versalles because the
[1:33:09] problem is sometimes we form our dented
[1:33:11] ease around bad things happen to us and
[1:33:14] we've become whatever anonymous you know
[1:33:18] misunderstanding Church split anonymous
[1:33:20] whatever it is you know better nurse
[1:33:22] anonymous and we should form a form a
[1:33:24] support group with our own selves leave
[1:33:29] the group just leave the group if you
[1:33:34] want to walk there but there's a gospel
[1:33:36] of power the gospel came to you in power
[1:33:38] so if it came to empower you receive
[1:33:41] that power I mean you should be walking
[1:33:43] in the power of the Holy Ghost and that
[1:33:46] power is given to you you say well you
[1:33:48] know the powers given to you you can
[1:33:50] overcome look at Peter persecution comes
[1:33:54] in when he's there and he's and he's
[1:33:56] there outside jesus' trial he buckles
[1:33:58] under the questioning of three people
[1:33:59] and he swears and does all these kind of
[1:34:02] things pressure comes on and he runs and
[1:34:04] before that it's his old
[1:34:05] with you Lord all have the sword oh yeah
[1:34:07] I'll be the defender of the face that he
[1:34:09] cuts the man's ear off and all these
[1:34:10] things but then when when the question
[1:34:12] are you uh are you one of them are your
[1:34:14] disciple do you believe do you believe
[1:34:16] this one oh no I don't I don't know I
[1:34:19] don't know anything about him
[1:34:20] pressure came on and then because he
[1:34:23] didn't have overcoming power he never
[1:34:26] ever going about anything God comes down
[1:34:28] the upper room fills him up and then
[1:34:31] he's brought before the Sanhedrin before
[1:34:33] that I was just a couple of woman and a
[1:34:34] man outside the Sanhedrin questioning
[1:34:36] him now isn't from the same court that
[1:34:38] condemned Jesus he says who should we
[1:34:40] obey God or man and they beat them and
[1:34:44] they sitting them out and they're
[1:34:45] rejoicing now counted worthy to be
[1:34:47] beaten for the name of the Lord
[1:34:48] hallelujah cause he an overcoming power
[1:34:52] the disciples head over koper and he's
[1:34:54] the same yesterday today and forever to
[1:34:58] come Lord I need some overcoming power
[1:35:02] there's a balm in Gilead friends there's
[1:35:05] a Jesus Christ here he's a God of power
[1:35:11] I wanna sing that song be nothing
[1:35:15] between my soul and my Savior
[1:35:19] if he doesn't mean everything to you
[1:35:21] right now you say Lord take out whatever
[1:35:24] that is between cuz at the end of the
[1:35:28] day who cares what other people do don't
[1:35:31] worry about them
[1:35:32] he should be everything to you he should
[1:35:35] be your first love well we're not cool
