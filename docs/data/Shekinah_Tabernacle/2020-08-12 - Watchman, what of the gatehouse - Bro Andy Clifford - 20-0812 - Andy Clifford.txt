man out of the way get old man and humanistic thoughts or anything lord just take it all out lord lord let us have some church tonight father may we have a good time lord in your presence hallelujah lord i pray you take control of every spirit in the place lord tonight that father lord you would just minister lord verbatim father to us lord father we wouldn't have any law mechanics lord that would get in the way but lord let them be subject to the dynamic of the holy ghost tonight lord and i just asked lord father if there's anything lord that would hinder the service tonight lord i pray father that you would forgive us lord for lord jesus we are wrapped in flesh that causes us troubles on all fronts lord but we have a god full of blood which is rich in mercy and tonight lord i just want to claim that mercy over us tonight lord and over those that would be listening in father lord let mercy abound for we know that your mercies are new every morning lord and we know that we have a clean slate to work with lord and father we have a perfect bill of fellowship father tonight lord we can just walk with god like enoch lord we can walk in the forest without king like brother branham lord we can just have fellowship tonight lord and i just invite you lord jesus just come on the scene lord have your way lord i pray that you would express the burden of your heart tonight lord that what you once said what what you want to be expressed tonight would just that would be it lord and no more or less lord father we just yield to you have your way lord unblock every channel and every life in this place and who would hear that lord all that has been anointed and inspired and and purposed will be realized in the flesh lord for father tonight lord we call on the name of jesus christ and i pray lord that you would just call lord your bride to attention and that father will lord that there would be lord a soul limb lord jesus voice father that would speak tonight lord lord jesus that would exhort and that would build hallelujah lord the things of eternity and it would break the things of man and the things of babylon for father we're here lord jesus father to lord be lord just completely lord built by the king of kings lord jesus and to be father lord subject to your great love and lord your great divine purpose help us lord to minister a word and season tonight lord according to your divine dictates of the holy spirit and love and lord let there just be lord jesus light shine upon every situation that you want to deal with tonight and whatever you want to do lord this is your service lord we're all here to hear from you lord we're not here to hear from man we're not here to hear some intellectual speech lord we're not here lord jesus to be seen the lord jesus we're just here lord as people lord in a place gathering to meet with the king to have fellowship with you and i pray lord that you would just minister now have your way lord more god i commit the service into your hands lord in jesus christ's name amen hallelujah oh my i trust that's your prayer tonight take me into the holy of holies amen you know there's one of the thank you musicians one of the man i could have that piano playing right through amen just oh i just love it amen hallelujah maybe we should break tradition sometime and just have some music playing you know the minstrel going why i've been tempted before you know there's just such a nice thing about music and just when the anointing's on that playing and it's just it's just a powerful thing that the lord has placed and given us amen no wonder elisha his mood changed amen and he was able to now come into communion with the lord and and see the deliverance of that child amen because a minstrel was playing hallelujah amen hallelujah so i trust that your prayer tonight you know that you know we would enter in to the holy of holies and i pray that let's just change the dynamics slightly and that the holy of holies and you would be restored built functioning full and working with the presence of god inside amen there's no point in having a temple without the presence of god inside amen and when all things are built right and everything's all in order the lord will come that's what he's waiting for and all and the only way to get there is to humble yourself yield and let him minister let him deal let him do it amen amen i won't keep you standing hallelujah this evening i just want to i'm just very grateful for this opportunity once again and you know the lord is just gracious hallelujah and i just want to acknowledge brother ben for the opportunity and just want to thank the lord for you know he's just such a good god amen hallelujah hallelujah so i just want to turn in your bibles now to isaiah chapter 62. amen we're going to read from verses 1 to 10. hallelujah and tonight we want to speak on a subject a title amen it was very hard to title but for want of a title watchman what of the gatehouse watchman what of the gatehouse hallelujah may the watchman of the age which is the holy ghost be the watchman in your gatehouse amen hallelujah that's my prayer and may tonight if he isn't he will be by the end of tonight your opportunity is tonight not tomorrow it's now because he's the i am he's not the i will be so you can have the i am right now and then it's forever yours he's forever yours amen so let's read for zion's sake will i not hold my peace and for jerusalem's sake i will not rest until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth and the gentiles shall see thy righteousness and all the kings thy glory and thou shalt be called by a new name which the mouth of the lord shall name thou shalt also i like that the mouth of the lord shall name bride hello bride the mouth of the lord has named you hallelujah remember this we speak of natural jerusalem but there's a spiritual jerusalem and you are that spiritual jerusalem you are the that you are zion amen so the spiritual jerusalem is in you and we're going to toggle between the natural and the spiritual jerusalem for the evening and we're going to also just to give you a context i'm not going to go too long on this but the the the temple began in the time of the apostles and and then it it went through an at seven church ages and it'll be restored again same as when solomon built the temple it was glorious and then it went and fell and they went through a dark age and then it came back as a restoration okay so that's kind of around the thought just so that we get some context as we read thou shalt also be a crown of glory oh sorry let me go from verse two again and the gentiles shall see thy righteousness and all kings thy glory and thou shalt be called by a new name which the mouth of the lord shall name thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the lord with the royal diadem in the hand of thy god thou shalt no more be termed forsaken thou neither shall thy land any more be termed desolate praise the lord hallelujah that's a powerful thing you know you own it it's yours that's yours amen you're fighting a real enemy that will tell you the opposite but the bible says you will not be desolate the bible says you will not be forsaken the bible says you will not be alone amen hallelujah but thou shalt be called hepsivah and thy land beulah for the lord delights anew and thy land shall be married oh my hallelujah hello bride you sing uh me and christ have been may 1 hello we're here this is the season we're in amen but you'll fight for it you'll fight for your identity but he's fought for it and he won it amen so it's really what you're perceiving right now you know it's the battle is in your perception what you're seeing now you have to believe but really he's won the battle it's finished now he's given it to you now take it but for as a young man marrieth a virgin so shall thy sons marry thee and as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride so shall thy god rejoice over thee i have set watchmen upon thy walls o jerusalem which shall never hold their peace day nor night thank the lord hallelujah thank god for the fivefold ministry thank god for a prophet of the age amen thank god for true dads and true mums thank god for the holy ghost that runs the whole show thank god hallelujah i have set watchman he says upon thy walls now o jerusalem which shall never hold their peace day all night hallelujah ye that make mention of the lord keep not silence and give him no rest till he establish till he make jerusalem a praise in the earth oh my let the jerusalem inside you be a praise in your body a praise in your earth because you're made of earth you're made of clay amen hallelujah the lord has sworn by his right hand and by the arm of his strength surely i will no more give thy corn to be meat for thine enemies and the sons of the stranger shall not drink thy wine for the which thou has labored but they that have gathered it shall eat it and praise the lord and they that have brought it together shall drink it in the courts of my holiness go through go through the gates amen this is that's key there's a key thought in there go through go through the gates amen the gates are important in the walls you don't want to just have walls without gates now and you don't want gates without gatekeepers or watchmen there needs to be it needs to be it's a system in your life to be restored and established back how it should be amen go through go through the gates prepare ye the way of the people cast up cast up the highway gather out the stones and lift up a standard for the people may the lord bless the reading of his word you may be seated in psalm 127 verse 1. that says here a song of decrees for solomon i like that it's for solomon the son of david amen because we're in a season now where the son of david's about to come amen and i believe that you know there's a lap over period and so we're in a lap over period as the millennium is being ushered in it's not just going to go boom here we are but there's a there's an ushering in there's a transition there's a change over except the lord build the house they labor in vain that build it except the lord keep the city the watchman waketh but in vain hey you can have watchmen you can be discerning you can have all the doctrine correct you can have all the cod right but if the law's not in your city there's vain absolute vanity amen we're just going to toggle around a little bit the walls the city you know you know some and you know we're all in different places we're all in different seasons some of us knew and just going through our initial stages some of us have you know have gone through some heavy trials some of us have had bad watchmen in our towers and have allowed the wrong things into our city and it's broken down our city broken down the temple the holy ghost has gone away and the walls have come down some of us are at the end of that and are coming out of that and they're being restored or in restoration but rest assured that all the elect seed will come to full restoration and tonight i want to talk about that restoration i want to talk about how your walls can be perfectly functional amen and you know this is a battle that we face the greatest battle ever fought is in the mind amen and so if the greatest battle ever fought is in the mind how does the thoughts get to the mind how does those fiery darts get into the mind is through the gates and how do they get through the gates by the watchmen if there's a watchman and if there is even walls in your life because remember sometimes the walls get broken down maybe depending on what season you're in but let me share with you that you can have your walls rebuilt amen you can have your walls built up to the way they should function perfectly amen so that you are equipped with watchmen in your towers to watch what comes in watch what goes out amen amen you see the gateman the gatehouse also you know there's different gates in the city and there's a dung gate and that dunga you need to operate that dungate and kick out the junk out of your house so that you can have god coming into your house so that you can have a whole ghost meeting in your house hallelujah amen because you ain't going to have no holy ghost knitting in your house if you've got junk in your house so you need to operate that dungeon gate tonight amen operate that dung gate in your house and kick out babylon kick out the golden wedges kick out the devil hallelujah sorry i wasn't even meaning to go down that road right now but it just happened all of a sudden it just blasted out oh my hallelujah you know me and myself i say you know what we're going to be real gentle tonight and we're just going to be exhausting but sometimes things just come out it's not me amen hallelujah oh my praise the lord you know amen glory to his name hey that might not be for all of us but for some of us and it's what you don't your pitchfork there tonight hallelujah i remember you know i had one of the most greatest times of my christianity was down at brother greg's and we were listening to brother aaron mcgeary preach oh my goodness those meetings you know they were real teaching but they were very poignant pointed holy fire teachings oh my he preached on the token and he really hammered at the leven in the home and you know what i did because i want god in my house i got all the living out of my house man we had a bonfire we burnt stuff we threw stuff we broke stuff kick stuff amen the dung gate got to working amen the watchman and the dunga said now it's time to leave clean it out amen you might be holding on to that thing you might be holding on to that pair of pants you might be holding on to that blush maker you may be holding on to those shots amen that's just there a little wedge of babylon under your tent amen to stop the revival happening in your home amen it might seem listen it might be folded away haven't been touched for years but it's there and god says that it's there we don't want that oh yeah amen who wants to be an invincible army you are an invincible army amen you are that hallelujah but maybe there's just a little wedge there that needs to be unwedged and needs to be kicked out hallelujah thank god we're not in an eye for an eye too for a tooth age imagine if we were in that age there'd be some there'll be some dead people dead people because there wasn't the grace now let's not make grace a disgrace let's make it let's let's really love the lord do it because you love him hallelujah there's nothing greater than his presence take me into the holy of holies amen hallelujah you know if you read the chronicles of israel you know many times the temple got desecrated but then when they cleaned it out when they when they allowed the stuff to go and there was a good king that came on the throne the lord came and he started pushing out the enemies and he started you know the angel of the lord came back who loves the angel of the lord who wants the angel of the lord to fight for them hallelujah oh i know the angel of the lord fights for us still today i've seen him in battle hallelujah oh my he's he's still a mighty host and he still slays mighty hosts hallelujah you just got to give him something to work with amen hallelujah isaiah 21 11 and 12 it says here the burden of duma he calleth me out of sierra watchmen what of the night watchmen what of the night the watchman said morning cometh glory and also the night if you will inquire inquire ye return come watchman what of the night hallelujah i'd love that you know there's a powerful thing there because it's like isaiah 60 it says arrive and shine your light as huh so hello to you good morning shalom light has come there is a morning breaking but out there it's darkness watchmen what are the night watchmen what of the gatehouse how's your gay house how's your wolves are they intact where are your walls at consider thy ways so where are your walls what are your gates doing what are you allowing in what's going in and out of your mind right now what do you allow into your home for the cool spiritual that's all fallen it's all subject to the fall your soul is the only thing that's not and it's saved and redeemed but your flesh and your spirit the gates see touch smell feel taste in here and conscience and affections reasons imaginations and memories those are some gates that you've got right now what are you how are your walls let's just have some questions how are your walls how are they functioning is the system been restored yet or is tonight your night for restoration it's tonight your night you know the enemy says like sam bell can these stones live they were all lang ruined and covered in moss they didn't look very good but they were living stones predestined to be part of your wall so that you can have a gatehouse so that you can have a watchman and every gate to control what goes in and control what goes out by the holy ghost who is in gatehouse making the decisions because it should be lord because we've had a watchman over the age he's come to restore what a real watchman should do what the holy ghost would say yes to and say no to who's in your gatehouse hallelujah i'm questioning myself here you know because we all my goodness we're in a fight hallelujah have i done something okay it's working is it not going on live okay amen well i haven't done this before but i probably have actually i think i've done this in vietnam they're holding the mic thing you know i praise god amen we'll let subconscious do this you know me ma'am i get i i crush things you know when i'm singing you know i just hold so tight and i was like just so intense you could get all those right you know you're recording and i look at my knuckles and they're white so let's hope that that doesn't happen oh my let's relax you know the lord really was speaking to me if i just relax then he'll fellowship if i get too intense then you know it's like you know the holy ghost is get dove man we just got to relax let him have his way hallelujah so just ask that question what is what's happening with your city walls and what's happening with your gatehouse you know you know i'm not pointing fingers at anybody or any situation you know this is these are just questions we need to ask ourselves because you see when we ask these questions and no matter how deeply it gets into your home or into your bedroom or into your living room or into your entry depending where you've bought into in your own home that's it's there is reparation there is restoration there is a power in here that can create a world that can spit stars oh man do you realize it let's just realize that by now think about that right now we serve god star breathing god if he can breathe a star seven set clean of them and know all of them by name how much more can he oh my how much more can he restore your laws tonight can he revive your walls can he revive your gates so that you know your battle becomes a little bit easier you don't get bombarded down it might i'm not saying your battle is going to stop amen but you know sometimes we've got so much stuff going on and we've learned that we're just bombarded down and you're crushed under but you don't have to be crushed under hallelujah but you've got to operate the dung gate hey man there's all those gates only that was the only one that really stood out to me was the dung gate there's a lot of them in there but the dungate i just thought i like this we're going to hit that it was just inspired to me that dumb gate needs to get some traffic hallelujah it needs to be it needs to be a lot of outgoing you know hello because the only thing we take with us is our character you know we've got to empty out hallelujah there's a song that says oh my loving lord you get to a place where you're just like lord i don't want to be burdened down over encumbered there's a nice word over-encumbered by by burdens and things and all this stuff that's that's empty out empty out tonight if there's something on your mind as we've been speaking that is that that you know i should just let that go just let it go just let it go tonight let it go because remember you don't need to hold on to all those things amen hallelujah brother branham and the world is falling apart it says this wake up pentecostal people shake your coctions realize the hour that you're living in this is a serious hour your people your so your people the way that you let your people do and act and things and used to be he was ashamed oh it was a disgrace for the christian to go to a movie they shouldn't do that at all the devil put one over you and he stuck a television right in your house and brought the movie to you all kinds of corruption all kinds of corruption everything else and you permit it you know this is this is where the gatehouse this is the gatehouse now we permit it what are we opening up to our family what are we opening up to ourself take you've got to take ref inventory about what are we doing but what is the consequences of it is it worth it is it worth allowing the assyrians into your walled city that's been controlled with the right gates now when i'm not talking about walling yourself and saying us for no more that's not the walls i'm talking about these are living walls made of living stones amen they have discernment that can kick out by anointing they can eradicate you know those kins like hezekiah and and josiah and acer and jehoshaphat and you know that they kick things out cleans the cities they put all down the altars hallelujah they were those people was in a city that was called under a divine message you are a people in a city that's called under a divine message hallelujah they both more of an excuse than us you got no excuse on day when he starts to judge into your life and what's going on in the ton of grace and power that you can have to for deliverance for cleanse for parenting for keeping your house pure the anointing the power of god in your family altar that will convert your children earlier they didn't have that they didn't have the glory of god like we do to to assist to come underneath to push and to deliver and to heal and to declare he said if you love me you'll keep my commandments and i will manifest myself to you that is the king of kings the lord of lords the jesus christ to manifest himself to us that is to openly reveal himself to declare himself to make himself known in our life to us for us to help us they didn't have that and they went through all sorts of different treacherous times and for many years i thought how they just had joshua they just had moses they just had all this and look where they are i never realized that that's the condition that we can get ourselves into too that tortures can get into we're in a time where the devil is using everything to infiltrate and he doesn't just infiltrate and then destroy straight away he has sleeper cells they come in and they wait for years then all of a sudden when the teenagers start to erupt then he opens up those things that we're letting when they were seven or eight stuff like that i'm telling you he's not stupid but he is stupid because he fight god anyone that fights god is very stupid but he's still you know you can't outsmart him oh so let's you know what serves not a faith is sin really and so you see now our gatehouse needs to be operated by faith our gatehouse really needs to be his faith not our faith his faith and his discernment in his decision and if we are a prisoner of jesus christ we will let him decide everything that comes in and everything that goes out that's very simple but yet you know there's always a fight there's a war there's a battle and it's raging and there's people and there's human this and that and politics and whatnot but still at the end of the day what right is right and what's wrong with amen what is babylon as babylon and what is heaven is him and i believe i'm speaking to a heavenly people that are part of a heavenly culture they have a heavenly economy you are not subject to the monetary system you're not subject to be a save to satan's system you are abraham's royal seed you don't have to be under those things but you can be provided for all you need to do is put them first operate that dumb gate get rid of those things out of your life amen tonight and let your walls be rebuilt hallelujah the moment you may have things in your home there may be things on your phone there may be things in your ipad or on your computer that are not meant to be there you can be delivered those things right here you can be freed completely before they're even deleted that's just the outwards thing that's what's going on in the heart and so tonight maybe there's something in your life that needs to be absolved by the power of god that needs to be healed that needs to be delivered that needs to be restored tonight right here before you even do the action of removing things out of your home from the tent you can be healed your walls can be built the watchman can be restored and you can be functioning in perfect love with god in the temple so that your life is not in vain because when god is in the temple your life is vain completely vain everything you do is vanity everything you think becomes vanity because it's not you need this mind of christ and the only way to have the mind of christ is to have him in your temple if you want him in the temple let him rebuild it let him build those walls again it starts with the temple it starts with the time of ezra it's that's that time there after they had had a glorious temple and when you first got saved it was glorious but you see every believer has to go through seven church ages every believer has to go through a death barrel and resurrection in their life every believer has to have a time of hardship hallelujah but there is restoration there is a time where he wants to show himself as the king restorer of your life amen but you must let him ezra he approached the king he had vision and tonight i want to declare that is a vision when you realize my walls need building my temple needs cleaning up it's been broken down i've gone through a dark age i've had a time where i've walked away from god even though i might as holy as holy could be on the outside and on the inside all my psalms are sailing ravaging wolves going on and something that cannot be dealt with without the power of god hallelujah there's a time of restoration there's a time hallelujah that he can come in and build you back up but you need to let him you need to be like ezra come before the king with a vision oh king let me oh rebuild the temple and you see god put it into rice's heart amen and he ignition forth and eat it amen go get your eat tonight go get your eater tonight from the kin he is waiting for you to ask he is waiting for you to say jesus give me my ear tonight i want my temple rebuilt i want it to be back the way it was amen back the way you sleep hallelujah so that you know this is the process this is the process it has to be built back up by the power of god but has you have to have you eat it you have to have the king has to authorize it because the enemies will stop you so don't try and do it in your own strength don't try and turn over a new leaf turning over a new leaf no no it just does work you can't turn over a new leaf the is raging he's got everything out now everything he's flat all the stops because he knows the time is ending you can't turn over a new leaf never could anyway maybe people got more successful in the old days but not now it's far too far too clean hallelujah you need to need it you need a word from the king hey man he will give you a security detail hey man he will escort you back to where it needs to be rebuilt amen he will take you into the holy of holies amen even though the holy of holies in your life might be a bit desolate he will take you there he will take you there and he will help you rebuild it he will gather all of the fightful ministry and the people together and the sisters and brothers to pray all those things will happen when you open to allow him to do it amen this is a powerful thing you know me i can't give it justice but i just like the lord but amen hallelujah once the temple has been built this is just kind of overviewing it you know oh my what does that say oh 8 30. sweet i've got half an hour you know once the temp have been built you know now the lord can come and start doing things again in your life but still there's no walls to come you see ezra had the edit from the king the the you know the letter from the king to build the temple but then another burden another vision has to come you know the walls need to be built because the greatest battle ever fought says i'm in and out in and out that place is getting ravaged by the enemies there's no defense so the walls need to be built too we'll get there a watson needs to be under the same vision as the nation's leadership they should discern the incoming travelers through their national faith and its standards don't let them down every decision you make assess it am i deciding this because it hurts am i deciding this because of a complex and i want to get back at something i do i we never do this that's why i'm going to do this that's the door hey man how are we all we can put your hand up and say i've done that before oh my you know you get it at a time where your mind you say the wrong thing and that can cause trouble but we should discern and our gates should be allowing things in based on the national faith you know what our national faith is who knows what our national faith is well our nation ain't no new zealand our nation ain't south africa our nation ain't it's the land of a heavenly cloud hallelujah that's our land and our judge came down and he judged you mercy he judge you righteous so that you can come be a part of that and he opened the seals and revealed himself that is the culture that has been revealed to you and it came with power it came with anointing so that you can attain it you don't have to try and earn it you don't pick yourself up with push-ups pull-ups and squats amen spiritual ones we won't do physical hey man you don't earn it he gives it he said just let me operate on you let me be the one that builds your walls let me build your family back up let me do it have your tower back it's going to be a big change in your life but change into family but there's an anointing and a power to restore when you honor his word when you honor him there is more power in him than the devil and when you let the devil in you're using the devil's power to to operate why would you want to let the devil operate in your life why would you want to utilize the devil to keep your family together you know why why would we want to do that compromise it might be sweet for a season but the fruit is death and separation who wants to be separated separation is death let's not have separation but let's tap into the vine let's tap into the glory of god let's tap into what is really true hallelujah to let those gates be operated by users he wants to operate them again before he operates them he wants to rebuild them again depending where we are hallelujah you know we're kind of we're preaching everyone in different places but we're gonna something's gonna be for you and for me wherever you're at you know let's be honest with ourselves we're gonna be honest with god you know we don't want to shield the enemy this is the you know i was talking to pakistan and you know that we're in a season now where the last little things are getting dealt with because he's got to have a son of david come he's got to have a millennium and he's so he's dealing with the last little tributaries in your land all the maybe the major ones are gone all the big enemies that try to kill your rage wars against you they're all gone but there's those little ones that pretend to be your friend and they operate inside you and you can live those if you want to but let me declare to you tonight the season is over for living with tributaries there is a grace in this place to deal with those little ones and they may be embarrassing but you can they can be dealt with tonight this is the season to deal with them amen this is the season those embarrassing little things that you'll live with and you know that are holding back the son of david hey man we had a good time on that night it was really powerful that thought now when you know the season you're in when you know the prophetic season that we're standing you can tow the line you can tell the line and say deal we are in a season where you're going to be out even the ones that like the libyan knights that made an assad made a covenant and they lied even those once again amen you read in the book of kings and saddles and all of them there was many that became tributaries and they pay the taxes they slaves for israel they turned because they were scared and there's enemies scared in your life they're scared that's why they're not fighting you because they know there's a strong man in the house they know that the captain's in the ship but they're there and they're just friendly everyone again they give you a little bit of a tingle give you a little bit of a you know now when they do that strike man some you know we we all know okay those things start to come up and it's like this tiny little thing and it's like a little tributary all of a sudden becomes a big thing because the lord's dealing with it and this is the season that those things shall be delivered because those are the things that's holding back the last little things remember subconscious series and the prophet he said that it's in that realm that those little things is what really holds back the full power of glory to be expressed in your life huh that's brother-in-pose saying huh i think i've caught that off you brother i like that oh man you know you catch things off people that you like and you start to do things that they do because you like them it must be a human nature you know i like that amen hallelujah a watchman needs to be under the same vision as the nation's leadership discern and shine light on the common issues a city faces when a watchmen don't do a proper job social security is compromised spyware and malware threats enemies reconnaissance installed in your land do you know what reconnaissance means that's when the enemy army comes in and they covert they don't show themselves and they might pose as civilians that they're in there and they're watching when you let the wrong things on and they cause a lot of trouble those are the real nasty ones you know they're like the sas they don't send the imagery of those missions they send the sas and they send the delta force they send the marines and all of those top watch soldiers they send those ones for reckon right into the enemy's camp amen in this case right into the for the to the lord's camp and you if you if your gate man is not right or is blind or has been impaired by some set conscience or something in your life that you've allowed in you know spirits you know sin is deceitful and it starts to cloud your judgment and it starts to make you make decisions that are not right and you don't even realize it and then your subconscious starts to do things and operate and you don't even know your diet just happens and you go oh and it burned your heart and you think man why did i do that it just happened before you even know because the gates have allowed the wrong things in or the dungate hasn't got the wrong things out because remember there's an out there's restoration and we are in that time of restoration but you see this whole purpose is consider your gates consider your walls now i'm not saying that you're all of us and all of that but i'm this is a consideration service this is a service where we can consider what are my gates doing are there any gates i mean you know a city built without walls is like you know a broken spirit right and it all ties back to your human spirit it all ties back to how you have relationships how you interact what how things affect you and then you got to go why why are things affect him like this why am i like this and then you allow gold you say here i am lord open he's a great physician he's a great physician if you just hop on operating table you know and let him operate it's so simple and you know sometimes these things we we we we we clam up and you know sometimes we think ah and you know when that when the anointing's there when the angel like peter in the prison the angels are sweating you know the devil's on the other side reasoning just dreaming it's all just a dream hey do you remember the story he thought it was a dream there's reasoning just a dream go sit back down wake up don't but you know if peter didn't obey the angel the chains wouldn't have fallen off right said when he the angel and to me that's like a service where the lord moving and he's down on your alley he's coming down into your room down into your living room and he's coming down into your conversations down into your sinking down into your troubles the angel of the lord and he comes and he smite you on the side says get up rise up peter rise up rise up and as he rose the chains fell off you see so it's time for you to rise up out of it when the angel of the lord comes and smites you on the side rise up out of your chains you see peter was the head of the church right it even happened to him that's not when none of us are exempt and we will all go through troubles and we will all have troubles and we will all fail but it's he that gets back up and there is an angel of the lord that has come down in this end time he's come to smite you on the side amen he's come to smite on the side so that you can rise up out of your chains amen those chains fell off but that wasn't the end of it after the chains fall off you gotta start walking you gotta walk at lunch you know when you're a future to me man we're kind of constantly a future from the devil's kingdom we're just out of his prison and he's trying to chase you down he's trying to keep you back and put you back in jail but you've got an angel the angel of the lord encampeth about those that fear him they say you've got an angel tonight you can rise up right now and you can let the chains fall off so that you can walk out of that prison and when you walk out the reasoning of the dream will stop and you'll realize i'm free and then you can walk for 50 yards of elbow room oh my god that's 50 yards no devil let us cram you down you can walk and be free amen walk it large walk at lunch amen you know what that means you're free from the prison you're free from the government hallelujah amen not this government but the earthly government amen but when you get free from the early government you come into the heavenly government amen hallelujah okay man infected and disease threats this is now the these are just results of uh you could say a dysfunctional watchman or a city without walls a broken spirit so infected diseases and threats now it's physically sicknesses and plagues spiritual and physical so there's you know these things come in but if you discern what's coming in based on your domain because you have domains right children have their domain themselves and they're a brother or a sister a son and a daughter and they're in school or whatever they are their influence you have a domain and over yourself you have a domain amen now you can discern what comes in children at school you can discern am i going to allow that thought that that person tom come in or am i gonna say no the bible says this about me i'm daughter of god i'm a son of god i don't have to do those things i'm not gonna have those things come into my gates i don't want my temple broken down i want to be able to worship god i want a certain church now here's this one i've got something for you children you listen very carefully real carefully right now who is there any children here that really want to have an awesome time in church is there anyone right this is a secret here that you can have don't let all those other things into your life get it all out if there's anything in your life just just go lord i don't want all those things i don't want to have the attitude i don't want any of that because you see your parents who sees their parent having a glorious time huh who sees their parents having a good time and you think what how do they have such a good time what are they what are they doing what what someone's just yelling at them at the front they're having a glorious time and the children are looking going how does this work how does it work well just try it just try it get your gates operating say lord of my gates so that i can have a good time in service i want to be in such a place that word you know we're preach it's glorious i don't have to sit and enjoy and think about everything else but and actually you shouldn't even be thinking about church you should be thinking about god amen amen church is glorious if your gate's functioning good amen and we'll be walking with the lord and having a good time but then you you let the gate down and something wrong comes in and then all of a sudden church becomes a bit hard for a while you wonder what's going on well there's something in there that's when the dung gate has to operate that's when something has to get out of your house out of your life off your phone out of your tv oh there's probably no such thing anymore but out of your screen amen something's got to go so i can have a glorious time so i can walk with god amen help me lord amen so you know the more of the more you allow god to purge you purify you the more impressionable you come the more the word affects you the more just the thought when it's preached you just feel love in your heart you think my i want to be like this i want to have this all the time and you can but it's a fight because you see where like we just absorb things and sometimes you go and you let the wrong thing in and then all of a sudden your impression ability becomes hard and you know and it's like the ground becomes hard and then you sit and you're enduring and what you don't understand something or what maybe but then all of a sudden the lord comes he says i'm here to deliver you i'm here to heal that you know the bible says break up the fallow ground break it up break up the dirt the soil you know literally all oxygenate get some air in there amen so the seeds when the lord reigns down in the service the seeds just quicken up you know david says thy word have i hid in my heart that i might not sin against you the prophet takes that further and says you know david could only do that that's all he could do there was no quickening power to quicken the word that he hid in his heart but now and tonight break up the fallow ground because there's a quicken power to quicken the seed in your life to bring it to life this is what i'm talking about amen hallelujah watchmen what are the night the night is out here the night is in this flesh there's a soul inside you good morning good morning soul you're in glory you're in a glorious place but this flesh is nighttime what of the night what's happening in the night time of the life what's happening in this realm are you allowing things to come and try and get into your jerusalem try and get your temple all beaten down trying to get it desecrated want some babylonian idol erected in your temple no but did it happen to israel it did now i don't believe the devil can come into a step heart amen he can't get in there but he can certainly cause destruction and trouble right around huh the prophet said even a holy ghost for person can have mental illness man that's pretty extreme can have a trouble in there for it's so bad they get broken down by a mental breakdown mostly emotional connections and all that stuff can happen but god rich and mercy just like that gone just let him build jerusalem let him build it up amen that's what he wants to do he wants to come down into your heart and he wants to rearrange some things he says i want to turn that desolate place into an eden again i will turn it into a beautiful garden again i want the river flowing again amen that eaten the river flowed from paradise to one of the garden you need the river amen he the believer for me the out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water you need the river hey man he creates that dead condition so that rivers can flow from you the holy ghost can flow from you to water your garden to put an influence over your flesh over your spirit to make you happy subdued you know when jesus comes to the real earth in the millennium he's down and there's there's an idiot condition again what's the devil doing what can he do he's bound what is he bound by circumstance what's the circumstance jesus and the bride manifest ethernet condition rivers flowing oh my oh my earth what can the devil do so if you are having a need in your life and the river's flowing what can the devil do that's when you become an invincible army discerning the antichrist spirit what is it the gates have got functional gatekeepers functional watchmen not blinded by some sad conscience remember your conscience is sad and i know oh i know and when you see your conscience it's not easily brought back it takes years and something and it actually doesn't have to because the same divine healing that heals your body it can be a miracle or it can be over time but it will be healed because it would above all things that you prosper and be in health that body is subject to the fall your spirit is also subject to the fall and so if you've said your conscience or your broken memories or whatever it may be the same divine healer by your his stripes my conscience was healed so the same faith that you have for divine healing of your body you can have divine healing for your spirit honestly you can have it you know we think i've got to go through countling and you there's nothing wrong with counseling i need to go through all of this stuff i need no there's divine healing you can be healed and then adjust your habits because there's one thing you can get here or something and i've been healed in my conscience i've been healed and i've gone back and done the same things and gone back in the same round i think it's harder because you sear it you share your conscience who knows what i'm talking about you know it becomes easier to do wrong and i'm talking about just little things and sometimes those things can lead into worse things and you can find a person a son of god a daughter of god in a bad place and that's and but i'm talking to those people you can come back there and maybe it's in your dark age maybe you've gone through it may and now it's time you know there's been a reformation but now you've got to come out of affirmation it's time for you to come out of revelation it's time for you to come out of sanctification now don't lose it keep it it's time for you to just get beyond the supernatural of the gifts and come into full communion with god come into the fullness of god hallelujah all of those things need to happen in your life right you're going through him hey man let me just read something and then we'll close brother branham says the watchman was what what he was the duties of the watchmen in the old testament what was duties of the watchmen in the old testament the watchman was the man that went up to a tower in the city on the city way high he was higher than all the footmen because it was his position now in order for his men for this man to get up there he must have a good clear understanding and he must have good eyes he must be alert he must know the stars am i this is deep and you can you can read this it's in watchmen mode of the night study the sermon just actually read it enjoy it afterward to speak to you through it that's powerful he says here clear understanding and he must have good eyes they must be alert and he and must know the stars and many qualifications had to be before he could be a correct watchman and remember the lord trained he traineth my ends to war i asked his brother ben preached on sunday if you ask for wisdom you'll get wisdom god will get to you abundantly so you don't have to say i don't know how you know don't be like that the lord will provide everything you need he's given you a message to make end time conditions and as the devil gets all of his unholy intelligence all on here to try and get you down there is a greater intelligence there is a message that's gone forth to to give you to meet those conditions so you can believe that and brother branham says i'm afraid today that we've put some watchmen in there that couldn't sepha oh couldn't see all this disaster that's a coming to warn the people then unqualified a watchman would soon have a city destroyed because the entire city depend on the watchman god's watchman the watchman is a prime place to attack and or corrupt at all means possible you think about it at all means possible the devil do everything to corrupt your watchmen in your life so that he can get to your city so that he can bring it down so that he can give the devil leverage that's what he wants he wants the devil to have leverage in your life leave her at your job leave it in your finances and and when you break off from the word of god and what's been revealed under the opening of the word and the and and things that's been prescribed when you veer out of it by your reasoning and searing your conscience then trouble comes then that watchman allows things in but be careful be careful because the devil's trying to attack that because he knows that when that gets attacked it can cause trouble in life but a watchman which colludes with the enemy a watchman that has become worldly and spiritually numb a watchman that is detached from the importance of his post brother bran says this i'm just going to read for the rest the what the morning cometh and the night also now we're in the dark time the loud descent church age man lukewarm not able to stand the things of god they pull themselves off separating like it was in the days of noah but the morning star shines right off them i like that the morning star has come as a morning as a daytime as a good morning shalom to the bride but yet there's darkness everywhere and it's a time of darkness but the star shines on all the power of god the holy spirit he says jesus said the works that i do shall you do also greater than this shall you do because i go to my father he promised the power he said a little while and the world won't see me no more it'll be dark but you shall see me arise and shine for i'll be with you even in you to the end of the world then god's light will be reflected in his church and more powerful than ever before the coming of the lord jesus watchmen what of the night and ask you what's happening in the night what's happening in the night of your mouth can you see the sun shining can you see that the son of man ministry has come to raise you up to quicken the seed in your life to give you overcoming power to reveal a heavenly culture to take you out to say come away with me my bride come out of laodicea let ladders here come out of you there is a grace in this room to take you out of it and it out of you all you need to do is let him tonight just let him don't wait till the end don't wait to the end of the service just break tradition and let them out of now huh i'm really stolen on that thing brother wait don't wait sorry wait on the lord don't wait till the end of the service to get your blessing have it now get free now you know you can become a christian one second you can be delivered in one second it's the heart god is looking at the heart he's looking at the heart tonight tonight you can be free amen watchmen one of the night what of the gatehouse what of your gatehouse what your city what of your temple what of your home can these stones live can there be a wall rebuilt in your life with functioning traffic in and out hallelujah a wolf is connected to jacob's ladder a wall that's connected to the glory of god that has been opened in the end time there's a fountain opened in the house of david tonight for you to access and let that power keep your family let that power keep your job let that power help your finances let that power help you and all the natural things so that you can sit in church and worship according to the dictates of your heavenly culture not your earthly culture not some idea that you think you are in the flesh no align yourself let the let god align you with your true eternal image which is in heaven was rejoiced before the world began you shouted you know that you shouted and you'll shout again you say you might as well start shouting now just get an alignment just shout who cares what people think hey man that's good that's actually good i like it not no don't put on you've got to get impressionable and maybe you're not impressionable enough but there's some things that need to disappear there's some things that need to go there's some baits that need to open tonight then build your walls tonight let them fill your temple where are you at oh my goodness where are you at think about it consider your ways tonight he that has no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down and without walls each individual has a watchman who decides all inward and outward traffic but many of our people all the lying ways some don't even have the watchmen temples are running dry the vision perished out waiting waiting for the season to change temple's lights burning dumb we watch really well for our natural man we try and pamper to that what's going to please my flesh what's going to be easy let's make the easy life let's make it easy for the flesh huh i mean you know we're all on that boat we don't want to make it hard and we shouldn't just try and make it harder no monk amen and some greek monastery on bill right we always want to have things easy but let's not cater to it oh man let's not make decisions that are based on our comfort let's be neutral be neutral tonight i encourage you right now right when the lord's here be neutral because tonight can be a cataclysmic change for you for one little amalekite or one little hittite that may be blocking something out of your life but maybe you're perfect maybe you've got it all sorted out now and you'll finish the battle and you're right at the end and you're speaking worlds into existence and you're going to live on it you go live on it on monday then you come back to church on wednesday are you there yet oh my no we can't talk anything tonight amen let's just own the word own the grace of god that is here to change oh my hallelujah amen you know i just want to read a couple of things that we're going to close it says here you know it's time for a restoration and rebuilding of watchmen and the spiritual infrastructure that supports the important placement of the watchmen in our lives the process happens as i discussed you go you know you have a temple that's beautiful you have a relationship that's beautiful and you come to the lord and you're in your first love and everything's pretty everything's glorious the grass is greener everything smells nice and the sky is blue and then trials come and then all the temptations come and then you find yourself in places that you never thought you even had in your life anymore but they started coming out but there is a time of restoration amen there is a time now and we're in that season we have to come to that place and the lord is bringing us right up into it so that we can walk in the fullness of it he says here you know this is in nehemiah 2 verse 1. he says now remember this when i read this you will realize that a hazardous you know there's a queen by his eye it's very powerful he says here and it came to pass in the nissan in the twentieth year of dirk sees the king that that wine was before him and i took up the lion and gave it unto the king now i had not been before ty said in his presence wherefore the king said unto me why is thy countenance sad seeing thou art not sick this is nothing else but sorrow of heart huh have you been in that condition have you been like hannah down at the temple huh you want you want something real in your life you want life to come for sick of just warming up you're sick of dealing with the same things over and over maybe there's that one little malachite that one little thing that just needs to be delivered tonight you can have our experience tonight you can have your healing it can happen right here and we're going to pray we're going to pray together after this and what you need you're going to get it believe it you shall be healed by his stripe i shall be healed maybe there's something in your spirit that is broken and your city is without walls tonight you're going to leave the service with wolves you're going to let the service of function gates let me speak it into you that is what faith is faith is the word is neither even my mouth you shall be healed your spirit shall be completely built up again because he promised that you would have a new spirit he promised that you would be healed he promised that he would push out all those things in your life that's hindering your relationships you know relationships aren't real good you know you spend a bit more long time with somebody and then you know those traits start to come out and those things start to ick they shouldn't be there they're not going to be there in heaven and you're going to get delivered from them you're going to get healed from those things those things must come out they're not of a heavenly culture they're not from your heavenly identity they're from your family they're from your natural family their dysfunctions that have been passed down generations there are habits that have been shown to you and your subconscious and you've just reenacted them and they've just been happening and i'm preaching to myself here tonight but tonight we're going to pray tonight we're going to be free tonight we're going to exodus those things amen who's with me who wants the exodus of those little things that has annoyed you amen one should chase a thousand two ten thousand three a hundred thousand how much more all of these people we pray together we're going to pray together and we're going to pray amen lord our heart if there's something that you know in your life that the lord got his finger on that the lord is dealing with and you're failing at it over and over but you can live with it but you don't want to live with it because you know it's just unbelief you know it's just a little wedge that's getting between you and the lord and i've got them we all got them tonight the devil doesn't like this but tonight they can leave tonight you're going to get healed tonight you can claim it the lord says i would about all things that you prospered in health by his stripes i am and was healed it's finished he did not take the stripes bane he didn't take them vain they had a purpose and that purpose will be realized in your life tonight you will be healed tonight if you believe now you can't believe because this is a season you know there's reasoning but remember peter got up remember peter shocked those teens tonight gonna get up and you're gonna shake those chains because the angel of the lord has encamped about those defeat him who fears the lord hallelujah so there's something tonight that you can have that you could claim because it's the season for you to have it it's the season hallelujah because we're having we're going into a rapture soon amen and you're not taking those things there's a gospel there's an atonement that has been made for you to be free it's been made for you to be free tonight you shall be free tonight you shall be free tonight you are going to have divine healing happen in your spirit or in your body whatever you need but i encourage you the body you know it's all right these elements almonds they'll come and they'll go but your spirit is causing you more trouble than more bodily ailments way more trouble those are those the weaknesses those are the brokenness that is causing the enemy to be able to get into your land dampen down the fire of your temple oh my i'm gonna go right to the end now and read the final things now just to set the scene remember nehemiah had a vision and he he had to he was sorrowful that he approached the king and tonight you're like nehemiah and you are approaching the king because you have brought the king wine you have you have made in the whole a cold drink amen from the will of bethlehem hallelujah amen who's been freed who's been set free amen who was like rahab once upon a time and all your life crumbled away because of the voice of bloody angel because of the message of the hour that set you free so then what happened after she got set free there was bethlehem they founded bethlehem so you are part of that place and you can by default by predestination by eternal inheritance you can give him a drink tonight that's you are the cupbearer of the king you are the one that can bring him a drink amen so before the king like nehemiah you can say lord it's time for my walls to be built it's time hallelujah for for the right functions of my spirit again i don't want to be lit up and down and in and out tossed on fro by all these emotions anymore i want to have a balanced bloodstream i want my body to have balanced feelings i'm sick of being tossed up and out in and out but i just need something to stable hey man who wants to be completely stable with the stabilizers on the ship the wheel and the wheel keeping you in the middle of the road keeping you walking steady with the jesus in the ship oh my you know when you get to that place is perfect oh days are over let's not try the mystic but you become spiritual and i mean really spiritual not i'm spiritual brother but real you've got prophecy coming out of your life you live a life of inspiration amen so you allow the water to drink to bethlehem out of your life to give us a good cold drink amen hallelujah now that house that house has been rebuilt remember this was a glorious house at the time of solomon wasn't it was a glorious house it was so wonderful that when they built that house then it was all done there was people crying because they were pining over him glorious it was and how it was quite plain and they had nostalgic moments and they said that we hear half of the people crying and all the young ones rejoicing hallelujah and i believe i'm speaking to spiritual loved ones tonight that are going to rejoice by faith because that is the temple that the king will come to himself the king came in his flesh amen to the second temple the restored temple that temple had to go through seven church ages that temple had to go through a time of failure just like you have to go to a time of failure but you don't have to stay in failure tonight you can be restored and the restoration of your life is far more glorious than the one it was in the beginning oh my i'm feeling so overcome hallelujah god said i'm not fussed how pretty it looks i'll bless you anyway he says listen haggai two verse two speak now to the riverball this is at the time when they were building and he needed encouragement because they were down they were dismayed it was too hard and maybe you feel like it's too hard maybe you just get i'll just live with this but no not tonight not tonight you're not going to live on it you may be tired now and i'll keep you alone let's just let's just go five more minutes not denied toe the line tonight over the line tonight you're living by his face then who's living by his faith yeah okay the glory of the latter house seeds the glory of the former when you first got saved that you were on cloud9 oh my glorious times and then you've gone through a few things you've had a new battles if you're scared and a few problems and failed literally many times and now it's time for the restoration of your life it's time for the temple and it might not look pretty good it might not be as good looking god doesn't care he's not caring about the prettiness the makeup of caring about it the great cold and the great things he's not worried about that what he's worried about the temple is really fun a temple that's ready for god to come on flesh to come on the earth remember we're right before the millennium the governor of judah and to joshua son of joseph the high priest and to the residue of the people saying who was left among you that saw this house in her first glory and how do you see it now is that that singing in comparison of it as nothing you know sometimes you feel like you're just nothing and really you think that and maybe you think of all those glorious things or whatever it may be like uh you know you you it becomes like almost like a a delusive memory of what it was and all those things and how it was but actually even though you've gone through it all what you're going into is far far more glorious far far more gross than you could ever imagine eyes not seen nor is there heard nor is it entered the heart of man the thing which god has prepared for them that love him and the glory of this restored temple of your life the jerusalem of your life the temple that you are in jerusalem is more humble you see that first temple now i'm not putting down anything this is just in this type you can't stretch it out but in this type you have this glorious temple that looks so great and it was but the corporal being of the lord did not come to that temple and then here right at the end right it was rebuilt and it was good it wasn't as good it didn't look as it wasn't as rich it was humble on the outside who came to it let's read it he says he says is it not in your eyes and comparison of it is nothing hair guy two verse nine the glory of this letter house shall be greater than of the former saith the lord of hosts and in this place i will give peace to the lord hosts amen you may have failed real bad even you know stacked up a bad reputation people you know you might you never you may have done those things you may have gotten all mixed up with the wrong things but there is a way back you're the season of now i'll restore your conscience again i will be your fullness of joy again i will be your keeper again i will come into your gay houses again i'll rebuild your house again take it on it this is the lord for you it's for you take it and own it and let rebuild receive your edict from the king receive your letter behold i will send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me and the lord whom you seek shall suddenly come to his temple even the messenger of the covenant whom you delight in behold he shall come saf the lord of hosts but who may abide the day of his coming and who shall stand when he appears for he is like a refiners fire and a full soap and tonight i believe that we're experiencing that and he shall sit as a refiner and a purifier of silver and he shall purify the sons of levi and purge them as gold and silver that they may offer unto the lord an offering in righteousness jesus comes to his temple let's stand amen jesus comes to his temple he finally comes to that temple that humble temple the temple that's been restored and it might not have looked like it was but he came to it and what happened when he came to it he's got a people begin to worship but people begin to say hosanna in the highest hosanna to the king of kings hosanna to the son of david who said it to him that comes in the name of the lord and came into the temple and what did he do i could follow he came he popped no the money changing tables and he rearranged and he said my house should be a house of prayer and tonight we're going to make his house a house of prayer tonight you are going to make his temple that's been restored and a house of prayer tonight who's with me amen amen hallelujah let's pray to the lord and i want you to pray with all your heart there's something in your life you'll let lord deal with it now because he shall suddenly come to stem lord jesus father we just humbly come before you lord and just ask lord that you would come with a mighty
