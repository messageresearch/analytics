and as you prepare our speaker's heart now may come lord as a vessel as that little microphone all that little speaker law that switches on and anything that comes all through there it's you all the

bless you saints welcome to the house of the lord amen we're all the house of the lord so we've all taken our places everyone in the comfy seats and very comfortable seats some more than the ones that has a church but see what happens now is we have taken our place the angels has taken their place god has taken his place and what can happen in this atmosphere it says with two or more gathered in his name there he is in our midst so he's here and and i know it's on zoom land and i know it's on the internet but you know what the anointing and the presence of god will be with you in your house i pray so as we enter into the word tonight if you pull and you go and try to get your blessing you will receive what you put in because the the rule is how the lord works it is you reap what you sow you absolutely reap what you sow you reap good you rebelled but you will reap what you sow so if you do make a mistake and some things happen you reap what you sow so tonight if you sow god's gonna give you some seeds tonight you can receive it and if it receives it will bring forth life so i encourage you don't don't just get distracted don't worry about a tv screen try to look past the tv screen and what can happen tonight amen it's um the first time i do this so uh it's a bit nervous because i can't really see all of you you're so small but praise the lord you are there so god bless you saints let's enter in tonight so let's all stand up and we and we start entering into the the word of the lord so i want to open just a word of prayer brother ed thank you so much we we're having church here at the milam's and i would say god bless brother ed and and brother matt for all the effort they do for us in the background we don't see it but it is a means i wish i could take my phone and go on to zoom and and point it that direction this house is just cables from corner to corner and screens and mics and i've never seen a setup like this in my life and they all do that to further the kingdom of god so it's not to find any fame not to find any favor with man they do it because they want us to receive god in our time there is not much time left so now more than ever let us pray in amen amen let's just open up in a word of prayer lord jesus we come tonight but lord we are everywhere but we came to one place lord and we come in one accord lord and we want you to just take this evening lord and minister to us and give us strength lord and help us to see things like you want us to see it father that your will be done in our lives and not our own will lord we ask that you would just lead us lord and guide us tonight you see many a people on this earth are sick many people are falling away lord many are tribulations lord rumors of war earthquakes and diverse places lord many things are going on and it's easy to look everywhere but lord let us look into your word let us tonight look into your word and draw strength and lord get encouragement and stay focused lord for lord what you want for us in our lives i pray that you would just take this time as brother ed preached lord and and with his song service he said something that touched my heart may i be that microphone may you be the voice father and may the people receive your voice may the hearer be so anointed tonight that they would read between the lions lord of what is being said that they'll go that little bit deeper lord and search for that nuggets of gold lord that they can take and lord that they can just go and meditate upon your word day and night and draw strength from it lord because your word is an unfailing word you are unfailing god and i pray tonight as we open your word lord would you open this word to us in the name of our lord jesus christ we pray amen amen so tonight we're gonna we're gonna talk about the subject read between the lines if brother matt could maybe put up that slideshow for me so um going to go to the book of genesis so if you'll turn to the book of genesis and we go to genesis 2 verse 15 amen so the whole thought that i got and i don't know how the lord's gonna bring it together usually just does it so i pray that you would just follow me and if i do lose you around the corner somewhere maybe just raise your hand and say hallelujah anyways because god will just open up to you what i what my heart wants to say and what god has just inspired me to talk about so we go to the scene of the garden of eden and we're going to read this god now already in genesis 1 he has he has spoken the word the spoken word has gone out so so god has said let there be light and and the word was spoken so genesis 2 is the manifestation of the spoken word that's actually where everything is being formed where god is actually creating man which is creating the plants he's creating the earth he's taking it out from the earth and here in verse 15 after he's done all that and said and and the lord looked and the lord god took the man and he put him into the garden of eden so after he created everything to dress it and to keep it how many of us has been put into the gospel to dress it and to keep it amen and the lord commanded the man saying of every tree of the god and thou mayest eat freely eat but of the tree of knowledge of good and evil thou shall not eat of it for in the day that thou they that eat us thereof thou shall surely die and the lord god said it is not good for a man that he should be alone i will make him a help meet for him and out of the ground the lord god formed every beast of the field and every fowl of the air and brought them unto adam to see what he would call them and whatsoever adam called the living creature that was the name thereof amen may the lord bless the reading of his word may he now come and just take over you all can have your seats amen god bless you saints so the reason why i said can you read between the lines there's three questions that that was in my heart that i as a christian wanted to answer i said lord just help me here first of all how do i read my bible how do i read my bible what is my motive for taking my word and reading it how do i read it do i just read it as it's a task or a job or do i read it because there's a connection and i want to find out more so the first question i heard is how do i actually read my bible the second one is how do i listen to this message of the hour what is my motive behind listening to this message why am i actually taking the time to to press play and to listen to what a prophet of god would say in this age why you know because what is what is happening that i would be attentive to listen to what the prophet brother branham wanted to tell us and in the third one is how is my relationship with god because all three of these things tie in very very closely because if i have a relationship with my god and i don't want to get to any further than now but i just say if i have a true relationship with god i want to know more about him i want to know what his will for my life is i want to see it in his word i want to see it in my life i want to express it through my life so what i need to do is is i want to have a relationship with our lord jesus christ yes amen not with rules not with anything else doctrines and those things so so we look at this i don't know i'm going to stand still here but i'll try my best they kind of pinned me in so i can only move to here and here so that's all right i'll give it a go so so when i look at verse 17 there was law there was a commandment that came from god god said but of the tree of knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat so yes god is a loving god god is a caring god god formed man god wanted to express himself but what he did is he gave a message and this message says don't do it now how do i accept that message this is where a christian comes to how do i accept that and how do i use that in my life so let's go further amen if we go to the next slide there so there's three things that happens in in a believer's life and and uh we've got wisdom that's the knowledge of good and evil and how to conduct yourself that's some people are more wise than other you know you you you you would say like i will get there now but i'm not going to explain it but wisdom is what i want to touch on today knowledge of good and evil revelation that's the experience that goes beyond knowledge that's something that knowledge no matter how much knowledge tells you about that once you've experienced it you know it it's done yes okay i'll use the exam example okay if we look at the manifestation of the spoken word okay oh sorry that's my wrong note so three ways here of dealing with this there was two trees in the garden of eden the tree of life and the tree of knowledge of good and evil two trees these two forces upon this earth god satan one is ruling the earth and one is ruling everything else so there's always two forces two choices yes no okay two places you can stand you can stand right in the middle but it's still yes and no at the end of the day you have to pick yes there must be a pick you cannot stay in the middle you cannot stay between two opinions because you'll be swayed the whole time so you'll never ever get somewhere in your life because you keep being swayed we cannot do that we have to stay either yes or no black or white there is no other way about it there is no gray with god there is no gray with god amen and and revelation is what i said you about revelation is experience so experiences if when you tell your baby please don't go or your child we can use that please don't touch that hot plate that is still just a commandment that still just in their head thou shall not touch the hot plate but they have no idea why they shouldn't touch it even if you tell them it will burn your fingers they have not ever experienced burning their fingers they have no idea what you're talking about but now one day they venture to the to the stove or the or the oven or wherever and i pray it never happens to any of our children and he goes and he touches that plate and instantly instantly he gets revelation instantly you know because the word was there the warning was there but he has never experienced the consequence so the law was there yes no law policeman yes god i'd keep your commandments all those things but it was the moment you cross that line or the moment something happens in your life in your and the presence of god comes down we don't have to just take it into the naked of you had experience yes and and nobody can reason you out of that experience you know that you know no matter how much wisdom they have no matter how much revelation they think they have if you've experienced it you've experienced it that's it yes it's settled yes and then predestination is the other one i want to touch at the end we what does god say about me because even with the world of wisdom and the whole world of revelation behind you and all the experiences upon this earth and in your word and everything if god didn't predestinate you to be a believer i'm telling you now you will not be a believer [Music] harsh words have mercy but what happened in cain and what happened with cain and abel it is what it is god gave them a choice god still poured his heart out towards cain he says just do as your brother so he was still helping he was still caring and still showing love still showing mercy but he knew he knew that cain could not make that choice that's predestination it's hard but it is god and god is sovereign and we should learn and know they will not learn but we should know that when god said it's white and god said it's black that is thus say of the lord he will not change his mind he knows the beginning of the end and as far as we get with the program the further we can get with god so i'm so way off the notes but i'm just letting you know once you realize that god knows what to do you can yield yourself and you can start asking for the will of the father because the father knows the true will of the believer because he's put it in you amen amen so if we go to the next slide so now we get three types of believers we've got the unbeliever the make-believer and the real believer and they all sit in church amen brother branham said it says every church service there is a make-believer unbeliever and real believer now i don't want to touch upon them but i want to say this a unbeliever can have the worlds of wisdom an unbeliever can have revelation he can but he can get to a point where he just says i don't take more of it so he can have experience with god god could have walked in his life but when it came to some little thing that he just doesn't agree with he just said i can't believe that and he walks away so he can have revelation but he doesn't have all that god give him and he can be predestinated to be an unbeliever and if so with the make-believer and so is the real believer a make-believer can have wisdom a make-believer can have revelation and a make-believe is predestinated to be a make-believer but which one are you because it's when the word comes your way and a challenge is put forth that's when god is displaying who you are because remember it's not you god put you here for him he made man in the garden of eden to fellowship with him he did not make man just because he wanted to make man he wanted to be worshipped he wanted to express himself towards um towards people that would love him back that will have a relationship with him i hope you follow me so what i'm asking is is when you look at predestination god already know what you're going to choose it's if you can can fight that big battle of what is the choice and say lord help me to make the right choice help me to to stand for the right thing and if revelation comes or anything comes your way and it's a bit hard that you can actually deal with it amen and the only way you can do it is you approach back to god so i'm just saying an unbeliever make believer in a real believer all of them have a form of this they have wisdom revelation and predestination it is it is a big thing to preach but it is the truth so if we go there to the next slide we're talking about wisdom first and wisdom basically what it sees here in the brown so i go into the strong's concordance and it gives me this little little um cut out and it says wisdom could be an administration with wisdom could be a shrewdness wisdom could be a prudence like in a religious affairs and wisdom could be ethical and religious so wisdom can can be something like the pharisees you know they were wise men as well and they knew the bible and they read it and they understood a lot of it and they had so many prophecies that was prophesied to them and when it came to fulfillment of it they all missed it but they knew their bibles they were scholars they studied and studied and they knew everywhere where to find it but the word was still just in their head it was only a mental thing it was a reasoning thing and you can read someone if god is just a mental understanding somebody can reason you away from god that's why you need experience with god that's why you need to push further with god you cannot just keep it in your top four inches because remember the greatest battle ever thought is here so if god is only here satan will fight you there and he will beat you because the thing is it hasn't sunk into here yes and once it's in your heart and it's anchored in your heart who you are and who you believe then your fight comes in from here because it says when the enemy comes in like a flood now see enemy comes in like a flood god will raise that standard god will come in he'll raise the standard because this is where we fight but i'm not talking about that either so now we look here at the next slide brother ed we look at wisdom so wisdom here is the knowledge of good and evil in my and remember this is not this is me so so i haven't gone to deep doctrines to go and pull this out this is brother armand just having fellowship with the lord and he shows me this so forgive me if i'm not 100 in line but the lord will will show you exactly where i am i do believe it amen and and you just you just try to follow so now we go here to kings and we all know that king solomon he was taking the throne after david and he knew it was a great kingdom that he was going to run so what he did is he prayed and he said lord i need wisdom to do this job i need wisdom to run a country like this i need wisdom to be able to run a country as you want me to run country so i cannot do it in my own ability i need you to help me and he prayed about it and god listened to him and it says here in verse 29 in 1 kings 4 it says and god gave solomon wisdom and understanding exceedingly much so he didn't just give him a little bit he gave him exceedingly much because if you ask you will receive and what you reap you will sow and god knows your heart and he knows the desire of yaht and he knew that solomon didn't just want to be a wisecrack but he wanted to be a minister he wanted to be in such a way that he could bring a millennium upon the earth he really wanted to reign for god's glory wisdom and god gave him wisdom it says and the largeness of heart so he actually gave him wisdom and he gave him a heart that he would be ruling not just with a rod of iron but had compassion and and when that whim two women came before him with the babies he could see and the wisdom was so great that he knew which one to to say give me the baby we cut it in half he knew who would be the mother so he had a heart he wasn't just called and said just cut the baby let's forget the matter he knew the real mother would do it so he had real wisdom he says and even as the sand that is on the seashore and solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country and all the wisdom of egypt so he was wiser than all of them yes all of them and this is proving that wisdom is a gift and gifts and callings is without repentance so even if you know the lord or not there's plenty of wise people out there this world is full of them and they all can point you in 150 million directions but none of them are pointing you back to god because it's still just man's wisdom and not god doing the work and this is where the key lies is what is god doing so if we look at solomon's life solomon lived really good and he reigned really good and it was a mighty kingdom and he was prosperous and he would do sacrifices that he did was like man animals they said they lost the count of the animals that they were sacrificing that's how how much it was prospering in his country with the wisdom he had but then one day one day he started just walking a little bit after something that he shouldn't be walking and all the wisdom that he had he put aside to start going after the gods of the the concubines and the women that he was wives that he was having because remember wisdom is still just not wisdom we need the life of christ we don't need cleverness we need god and i'm gonna hammer this tonight because you cannot reason god do into your heart you cannot reason him into your heart because devil will take your reasoning turn it and just get you away from god because it's still just a mental thing it is not an experience amen so remember wisdom is a gift we go to the next one brother ed he says so now we go back you to adam because i love the story of adam and eve i read it and there's much in it and we can spend so much time here but i just want to highlight something so wisdom is after he now said don't take from the tree of of the knowledge the tree of knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for on that day they shall surely die okay so this was said to adam and adam was a wise man because he told eve because eve wasn't here yet eve wasn't taken out of man because if you go here to verse 19 he says and out of the ground the lord formed every beast of the field but just before it says and the lord god said it is not good for man that he should be alone so eve wasn't here yet god just said that to adam and adam when he met eve and and she was created out of him he said to her hey god said we shall not do it so that was for me not firsthand that was from god to adam and adam i hope you follow this get your spiritual caps on from god to adam and adam to his wife so from god to brother branham brother branham to his bride same instruction so what god said to the prophet the prophet opened up and said to the bride hey this is what god wants this is god's heart this is the warnings this is the victories this is the promises this is the overcoming power that's released to you this is the holy ghost this is where god is in your time so god speaking through adam saying to adam hey i don't want you to do this and adam relating to his wife is exactly what we're doing now amen but and now one thing that i want to see is if we go to the next slide because adam was a wise man he had wisdom he said and adam said after eve was created he said this is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman because he come out of man therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh wisdom he knew that she came out of him so he knew she was a part of him he was wise he knew it amen i think i just got a tag on my um hey says and they were both naked and the man and his wife were not ashamed so look at the state year of of adam and eve state right now in the garden of eden so he knows right from wrong already because god gave him a warning he took that warning and he gave it to eve and he said please we should not eat from the myths three of us in the midst of the garden the tree of knowledge okay and they both were naked and they didn't know about it so also just wisdom now just a little bit of a uh i shall not do it so it's like me telling my boys don't hit the ball towards the window it's the same thing they know they shouldn't do it but they kind of don't know really what is going to be the big consequences god gives them the consequences for that day you shall die they've never seen death they've never seen death so how do they know how it is for something to die they don't know this word all they know is life amen so we go to the next life brother end he says and now we go to revelations of genesis 3 and this is where the fall came in so after god warned them their fellowship with god they walk in the garden of eden and just having a wonderful time with god knowing that all the fruit of the tree they can eat they can do anything they want to except this one thing or two things okay don't eat from the fruit that's in the middle of the garden he says and here comes that that devil a that liar that even if he he talks the truth he's still a liar he says and he speaks to eve now because he's trying to reason now i want to to just get a thought across you know that eve i won't say or maybe not say but i want to say it i'm going to say it eve was not part of the original creation god took her out of man because there had to come a place where the fall could take place because what god makes is perfect so it's the only way satan could get in and the plan of redemption could have kept off is through eve because she wasn't part of the original creation god has said it's finished he put man in the garden everything was done he rested on the seventh day and then after that he made eve because he had a purpose a predestinated purpose to do that so if you want to go back in the book of genesis and go read that again prophet speaks about it serpent seed go back and read it again it is important stuff because they always fight the book of genesis because that's where sin started that's where the devil has started it's exposing the devil and all his works where he started and they fight the book of revelation because that's where the devil is going to end up and if they if you don't believe in god here at the beginning and you don't believe in god at the end how can you believe everything in between and that's why that books get so attacked that wasn't in the notes so for god does know of that in that day they eat thereof now see wisdom knowledge gets reasoned away he says then your eyes shall be open and ye shall be as gods knowing good from evil now i want you to see that because eve had a desire in it there was something already in her to want that little bit of more that little bit more to have that extra knowledge you know that knowledge above that the other one she had something in and i'll come to it now that there was she was had a desire to have a little bit more not just to stay in line not just to listen to the word but i just wanted that little bit more that little bit more reasoning that little bit more wisdom because i know things i want to know things i want to know good from evil i want to experience it so maybe a sincere heart but look at this now and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that was pleasant unto the eyes and the tree to be desired to make one wise so she wanted to be clever she she wanted to know all the mysteries of god now if we look at a believer that's an honest that's a good question i want to know all the mysteries of god but but to know the mysteries and having the mysteries revealed is two different things yes amen because god wants to reveal his word to you he doesn't want you to figure it out don't worry about figuring out i'm the lord thy god that heals all thy diseases i am the lord that god that lead you through egypt i'm the lord that god that took you through the river i'm the lord thy god that will give you the promised land i am the lord doing the work don't you try to work rest relax read your bible enter in ask god don't try to figure it out because you'll make yourself tired and the devil is the best reasoner in all of the world and he will reason you tell you reason you right out of you can't reach you of your salvation because predestination said whose you are but he'll give you a very big headache okay so let's not climb on that boat let's not climb on that thing let's start with the word and we stay with god because it's a relationship with our god amen and then she took off that fruit thereof and then she did eat and she also gave to her husband with her and he did eat well now if we go to the next slide now revelation kicks in because now it was still just a mental thing that god said it was still just the instruction nothing no rubber has hit the road yet nothing has really came concrete in eve's life to know that this is maybe a really bad idea because they've not experienced death they've not experienced sin they were blameless spotless before god so they have no idea what was waiting for them to go beyond the word of god from out from the protection of the word of god which was vindicated in the day by god saying don't do that and then somebody reasoned them out of it he says and if we look at the definition of revelation i'll just read the last bit it's or it's a disclosure of truth instruction concerning things before unknown use of events by which things or states or persons you throw withdraw from view are made visible to all manifestation appearance so basically if you look at revelation the book of hebrews hebrews okay faith is revelation okay faith is something where god says the foundations of the world are formed that by faith you believe it i receive it that's just something that just triggers revelation to start completely none of my notes faith is what activates god to reveal you things because if you don't believe you cannot see it becomes with being a believer a believer of the gospel so revelation if we go to the next slide revelation is the experience that goes beyond knowledge so you can reason as much as you like satan you can reason as much as you like friend that says my son wasn't healed you can reason as much as i like that you still have cancer after you prayed for it you can reason as much as you like that there is no god you can reason as much as you like that this world will be okay you can reason that but there's some things in our life which god reveals to you and you have experience so when i prayed for liam and my wife we prayed for liam and he had that very bad wealth and stuff on his body and and he went to doctors and doctors couldn't help him and brother ben was talking about an elise that went to the doctor and the tongue tied got cut that was correct hey before they even cut her tongue it started bleeding and it and it and it just separated that's right brother ben amen and you preached upon that and we took brother ben at his word and we went back to our house because before that all we did was reasoning and all we did was taking pictures and stating the obvious but we never gave god the glory and we came back to the house and said on the confession that brother ben made that you can heal and our faith that we believe we're going to pray now for for liam and it will be done praise the lord and it was done and he got healed and no doctor touched him so who did that that was the event that no matter how many people try to reason for me out of it i was there it happened but what about all the prayer lines that the believers were standing in with brother branham praying and time and again is telling each one of them in the congregation what's wrong with them and they're not sitting in the message today they had a revelation they believed they received their healing and what then so yes had revelation had a experience but what then amen so now if we go to the next slide brother ed thank you when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and was pleasant to the eyes and the tree to desire to make one wise she took there off and she did eat and also gave to her husband with her and he did eat now watch verse 7 and the eyes of them both were opened and they knew not they thought not they guessed not what happened now they knew that they were naked they knew it and they saw fig leaves together and made themselves a prince but before that they didn't know they were naked but now revelation struck and now when they started seeing what was revealed them being naked automatically the words went back to what god said don't eat of this tree of the the fruit of knowledge in the garden and now they know that the next thing to follow is death because that's what god said that's what god said amen so they had the experience so if we go to the next slide brother ed he says and now we are here at the judgment and god comes down and he calls adam and he says adam adam we are thou because he wants to fellowship with him but he knows something went on because the devil can't pull anything over god and he gets there and the whole court case is up now and the serpent is standing there and and strange i want to maybe tell it to the kids if all your children are listening the serpent wasn't already lying on his belly he was the most subtle beast of the field he was a beast not a serpent so like the bible shows him as a little snake in a tree is a lie and it wasn't an apple just letting you know so the bible paints a preacher these children bibles paint a picture which is false he wasn't a snake was why would the almighty god come into the garden of eden and then tell a snake to go back on his belly when he's already been on his belly yes you know come on man seriously it's things like this that makes people confused and they throw them off because at the young age we're not teaching the right things and then what happens is they miss it they miss it he was a beast of the field the most subtle beast of the field and that's the only way he could get to eve because he wasn't a cow okay he was a beast of the field he was like an ape man looking man where's the missing link today have they found him they had how many thousands of years looking for this dude and he's still missing with all the technology because it's on his belly they're just not looking in the right places he says and i will put in verse 15 with with revelation 3 he says and i will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed i'm not going to go there very tempting i'm not going to go there but i'll just see she didn't have seed women don't have seed read your bible between his seed and between her seed and it shall bruise thy head and thou shall bruise her heel unto the woman he said i will greatly multiply thy sorrow in thy conception so the cry must fit the punishment there we go think about it we're talking here about apples the crime must fit the punishment here's the almighty righteous god walking into the garden of eden and he's busy having a court case and he gives her a a penalty of eating an apple that she'll get birth pains that we miss something here why didn't it give her indigestion you know or stomach trouble or something like that why was the punishment due to conception have you thought about it in sorrow thou shalt bring forth what children because he just spoke about seed and before there adam and eve didn't even know they were naked read our bibles it's not confusing it is so clear and i desire listen to this and thy desire shall be to their husband and he shall roll a rule over thee because he warned her before and she didn't listen and now god says listen he will and it's not the ruling if sisters if you please understand me to say thus saith armand you'll do everything i do it's not that way it's not that way it's it's a godly way it's meaning that we we talk to each other you're my help mate that's why god made the woman is to be adam's help mate okay to help him through his life to to make sure that whatever he achieves he feels love and he and he has someone that he can he can work with and like my wife she's my memory stick you know she's my memory bank she's my financial advisor my pa she's my mom she's my wife she's a lot of things to me you know and and now she's been stricken with this devil trying to attack her and give her this this virus and for a couple of weeks i have to say i miss her those sister priscillas looked after us so well i miss her because she's my wife she's my help mate and now she's down and and i just want to spend time with her but i miss her because who's helping me you know so i'm not pushing her down i'm lifting her up you know that's why we're here we're not here to push our woman down you know but we get the final say because we are god in our house so if the warning comes through the husband and he gives it to the wife she gives it to the children and all is in place and we all grow to get it towards god me and my wife closer together but if god is the middle pen we will get there okay so it's not a woman are wrong and you shouldn't do this and that just see it as god is saying it read between the lines he's just saying eve because you've done this your desire shall be to your husband and he will rule over you okay that's all he said let me say he'll beat you down you see he'll rule over you and then we drop down to verse 20 he says and adam called his wife eve because she was mother of all living wow the previous chapter she she was not even knowing she was naked and all of a sudden through all this event and through the major court case adam got revelation and said cause you are now mother of all living now not later now because she had seed within her already amen let's go to the next slide but that was also not quite in my notes but praise the lord is going good um whoo it's nice or not in here man i'm so far off my notes it's um ridiculous but you know what i'm gonna leave my notes okay so this is where i was with this i hope i've got it right because i don't want to say something before the time i kind of have a bit of a i kind of said i should finish here but let's read the slide amen the knowledge of good and evil so we know that wisdom is the knowledge of good and evil okay it helps you in your battles it gives you strength one might be wiser than me you know i know i always think brother isaac is much wiser than me you know because he always tells me what the english words means and you know he's always there for me he looks out for me so when he preaches he preaches to everyone and he gives a word like resolve and he turns at me and says just for you i'll give you the definition and i love it because he's a wise man and i and i have a deep respect for him and god uses his gift but it's still just a gift you know but if i look at isaac and i look at the life elites and i look at how he loves god and how he serves god and how god is taking him on a journey that's different that's that's brother that's brother god working there not brother isaac that's god working through his life he's a sold out man of christ so yes he is wise and he brings things to my level which is fantastic because 12 year olds don't understand the word resolve okay i don't and he doesn't want to miss anyone so he made her isaac before the foundation of the world and he put him in this church site so they can go behind the pulpit and say hey in case you missed that because you can't speak english brother isaac is going to show you my heart and that's what resolve means read between the lines he never said i was dumb he never said i'm not good enough he never said you will never get there he just said hey by the way god wants you to know what it actually means read between the lines if a pastor is preaching at you and you feel his preaching hellfire and brimstone read between the lines between the lines of the word don't just take something as what it said take it into your heart and say god reveal to me what that man is saying to me even if he's correcting me help me to understand what he's trying to tell me what are you trying to tell me read between the lines amen okay brother let's go to that next one now we go to pre-destination and i'm and i'm about to close but luckily because we on zoom we don't need to go home so i can just preach all night hey so if you fall asleep just take your camera off and i can't see okay amen i see sister case cameras off matt's all no you're still awake so just just entering man we we we're christians man this is the most exciting time it's ever been on the face of the earth you know that that brother ferdi said he says the saints is going to ask you how did you overcome i never thought about it that way but i thought wow that is a big statement but if you really look where we at man it is a miracle and only god's grace that we can overcome amen yes okay so predestination now i'm just gonna go to that the the bottom definition there it says a predetermined decided beforehand hello decided beforehand foundations of the earth back part like brother ferdi said back part of god's mind you were created then already you were in existence then already he already saw you in the seventh church age he saw you in the bride age he saw you in the rapture he saw you in glory he already foresaw it all it's just can you believe it it's all it's all can you believe it completely and it says there in the new testament so i went into the new testament and um when it goes on it says of god discerning from eternity to for ordain a point beforehand okay so we go to the next one that's a little bit small i hope it comes out nice if you can't read it i'll do my best english to read it on all my things still because this is beautiful this is ephesians 1 3 to 5 and then we drop down to verse 11 blessed be the godfather of our lord jesus christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according as ye have chosen us he have chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having having predestinated us to the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself so before jesus christ even went to the cross the lamb was slain before the foundations of the world he already knew he was going to die for have you ever thought about it we preach it we say the joy that was set before him is you but it was because he already knew who he's going to die for when he was walking up on the cross and his back was all bleeding and there was blood everywhere and he fell off the weakness because he was losing so much blood and he fell and then simon picked up his cross he knew it was for simon but he didn't know just for simon he knew it was for everyone with simon as well he saw me there he saw you there that's a true fact because before the foundation of the world it was done he knew he was going to do it it wasn't a hope so and maybe for hanging the cross god have mercy on him he knew it was for us he knew we were sitting tonight that's predestination he knows who believes he knows who don't believe he knows who would throw his word away he knows who would praise and worship him he knows who would love him who knows who would hate him that's god he's sovereign but it is if we can heal ourself to accept what he wants for you that's where it's at yield healed i'll get to it he says in whom we off also ordain an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the council of his own will so basically if we go to the next slide read between the lines read between the lines so brother brandon put this quote up and i love it i read it and this is where the sermon came from he says who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or feminine or nakedness or peril or sword or world war iii or or not having food on your table or not having money in your bank account or what would separate you from god loving you tell me what would separate you from his love for us as it is written for thy sake we are all killed we are killed all the day long and we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us so predestination isn't not just a set of rules that god set out and say you know what you are predestinated so you'll make it and abc and you know when you do programming on a computer you've got zeros and ones and zeros and ones and zeros and once and these are months and he's pre-destinated he's not he loved us he loved us and when he placed us on this earth he knew where we would be and he knew that that purpose for our life is there for a reason and because he loved us he placed us at a time where he could trust us with this word he placed us at a time where he could put confidence in us like he did with job you know this is not just new testament if you look back at job's life satan came before god and said yeah you've got to hedge over him and you protect him that's the way he loves you he's the richest man in the in the in the world basically he's got prosperity he's got sons and daughters and so many cattle he can't basically cow them account them but if you take them all away he'll curse you to your face so that's all testament that's not that definition that said just new testament this is not a new thing this has come from the old testament already this comes from the first book in the bible job the oldest book i know of where god knew that job will not turn no matter what satan threw at him he says that's a righteous man and he loves me and he will stay in his way maybe he didn't say he loves me but i know he loved him because when everything happens now look at job's life here comes the first messenger in job's life and he stands by by job and he says we were out in the field and the cattle were eating and all that stuff and there there i can't remember who attacked us and i think it was the ooh who was it um it was the sirians or something like that attacked the men killed them all stole the cattle and took them away and i lived and here i am and then the next messenger runs to him and he goes oh we were in the field and and the fire of god ran down and all the the the harvest is burned up and everything is destroyed i'm the only one to live here i am and here comes the third one he says and your children was in the oldest house and they were all having fellowship and having nice food and they came in and killed them all and i survived and here i am and you see everything happened around job and in a very instant in his life everything failed everything went wrong he never reasoned it he didn't get angry with god he turned around and he put it except cloth and ashes are very many and he went down and he says god giveth and god taketh away blessed be the name of the lord because he knew that there was a purpose that was happening he couldn't see it and no fear was one of the things that triggered it he knew there was a purpose so yes he might not have the revelation right there but he knew he was a believer he knew was predestinated not to talk against god because he loved god and he did everything that god commanded him and he knew he had no sin in his life so he knew when he was standing there he was a righteous man before god no matter what happened to him no matter what his friends came to tell him he knew where he was standing it wasn't pleasant if you read the book of job it was a horrible experience and i i i never wish it upon anyone but he knew where he was standing he knew he was a believer because he was predestinated to go through that trial and if we go to the next one it's and now oh no sorry verse 38 if we can go back and he says for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ our lord and if you remember this kid nothing can separate you from the love of god and predestination is the love of god for you don't worry about anybody else that's not your job god is sovereign he's in control you are predestinated to have heard this message you are predestinated to be walking upon this earth now you not matter what goes on around you there is a purpose why you are here and god is doing it because he loves you as hard as it might be he loves you because he's got something more for you in your life don't miss it do not miss it whatever you do now brother branham says you know i'll admit that the people's people study too much they try to go too far ahead they try to think too hard and sometimes have mental breakdowns and things on the account of studying about the lord he wasn't talking maths here well you can have a mental breakdown trying to understand mass i know you know maths is terrible i mean it's a wonderful thing if you know the rules and the laws and all the places but it's when to apply them with that's the trick theory mate yeah so if you missed that q when they was giving the lesson you're not going to get it okay go stand in the back of the line again he says but because they're trying to understand god so much they think the more they know the greater their relationship with god is the more they know the more they know about god that's a lie i'm not saying don't read your bible you'll see now in a minute but it's the knowledge it's the it's the chasing of knowing and trying to figuring it out that's when you cannot get closer to god because it's still you doing the work and not the father in heaven which is doing the work through you don't miss that don't try to chase after god in some mental capability seek him in your life seek him in his word he says the only thing you have to do is to fall in love with him just fall in love with him and just go on right on loving him amen it is not trying to push him into something or to make yourself something you're not just go ahead and let god use you the way he wants to use you amen just yield yourself commit yourself and walk on happy singing rejoicing that's the way not studying that's the way a relationship with god he says when i'm out in the missions my wife writes me a letter and i love her and she loves me and she says dear bill tonight i said i'll put the children to bed and i've worked today and i see what she's writing but see i so love her that i can read between the lines because i can read between the lines that's the way how it is with god oh no sorry i know what she's talking about she don't have to tell me i know because i can read between the lines that's the way it is with god we are not trying to study for some news newspaper standpoint or some theological standpoint oh i got that word i praise the lord but fall in love with him get down and really get him in your heart and love god the love of god is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost then go reading your bible love him then read your bible you will see it will come right out between the lines amen because you love him it doesn't matter what he says in the bible you know sweet in your mouth put her in your belly however the word comes we take it lord you know however it comes across what i need to fix what i need to change it's all right lord i understand i love you i will do it because now it's a relationship and not just a doctrine or instruction like in the garden of eden but you can read between the lines and see the heart of god in your life jesus thanked the father because he hid it from those things of the eyes of the wise and prudent now no one else could read your wife's letters like that because i love her that way see and that is the way she writes to me that's the way god writes to you it's between the lines you read it amen and with that let us close tonight in a word of prayer and uh if if this world has gotten a little bit fuzzy you know and you're trying to work yourself up into some religious place or some place where you feel worthy to to serve the lord forget about those things because you're now miserable forget about those things why don't you just go back and fall in love with jesus christ why don't you just start there you know i would never in my life have seen myself on a wednesday night standing in some house at a at a pulpit which was makeshift with a microphone and some people on zoom and sharing the word of god why do i do that why not me because i love him don't lose your love for god because if you love god and correction comes you can take it if you love god and is asking you something that you should surrender you can do it if you love god and is asking you to love him more he'll give you the love to love him more he can do it but just love god so let's go one step back and let's start loving god again amen so let us all just pray together tonight and then i'll hand over the service to brother ben again oh brother um ed again our gracious heavenly father we love you lord and lord all these words might be mixed up lord and it doesn't really make sense sometimes lord and in my head maybe a lot of things make sense and then lord it's not me saying anything tonight it's you lord and when i got this thought i know lord you were trying to tell us one thing just relax there's so many things going on these wisdoms and revelations and predestination and all these terms that gets thrown around so loosely sometimes lord and and and all these doctrines that comes out and all these commandments and everything that we hear even on the tapes father and sometimes it strikes our heart and lord because we don't understand it lord we ask that you will just help us lord because if we love you we would ask you why if we love you lord we will go back into our word and go search the truth and just go keep on reading and say lord show us between those lines lord and if we got to a place where actually we're not in our word lord and we're not walking with you and we're not as in love with you as we was when we started lord i said you would forgive us father lord and like the heart of david you said man he was a man of after your own heart because lord he was quick to repent and he knew lord when you spoke to him that he would change his ways even he was so completely wrong lord and the prophet told him he was wrong he knew lord that if he would come before you might reap what he sowed but he knew lord that you would forgive him because he knew that he loved you lord and no matter what happened after that his love for you was sacred lord and it was something that was dear to him lord and yes it happened and and a lot of things happened in his life because of of that lord but i know that you still loved him father and he never never turned back on you and said why or why not lord instead he just kept fighting for you lord and keep standing for you regardless of all the things because he knew that there was a purpose father as we go tonight and we do we go in the rest of this week lord we ask that you will increase our love for you lord that when we open our word it's not a chore lord we open our word we can go and lord what do you want from me today lord if we put on a message it's not a bunch of rules or dogmas or creeds or some man that's got a mission lord but that we will read that voice behind the voice lord when we read our bible it wouldn't just be death and hell and broom and fire and brimstone falling and judgment and law and all those things but we'll see love unconditional love we'll see the plan of redemption we'll see a healer we'll see the mighty conquerors stepping forth claiming us back lord when we were once lost lord and and struck him down in sin lord taking us out of that mighty reclaim the god that came and and called us lord because you were calling for us we never chose you lord you chose us but we say thank you that you did and lord no matter how many others my fault lord i'm predestinated to believe i am for ordained to be a believer and to be sold out lord and to be standing here and just saying lord how good you are to me even if all fails even if everything goes wrong even if it's just so bad lord and we don't understand why that we can still stand as job and say lord god you are almighty you are sovereign lord and you know what before even time i was shouting with the sons of god lord and rejoicing when the lamb took the throne lord jesus may i remember that day when i was there lord because i believe just as in the book of revelation lord when there was silence in heaven we were there lord when you went to the cross we were there when miracles happened and you were walking here we were there lord we were all part of it we just maybe have a bit of amnesia lord but we were there because we are believers lord the only reason you make us see now is because you love us and lord i rebuke the enemy lord i rebuke him in the name of jesus christ and i say satan get back in your position under our feet lord you've wrapped up that plan of redemption you've taken back the book that adam lost lord that that chair of them stayed just they guarded it with that sword lord you took it back you opened it up and you gave it back to man and lord it was preached and the mysteries of gods is all wrapped up now lord lord and now we stand here as redeemed sons and daughters of god and we receive our judgment now and we take it lord and we take our correction and we stand for it lord because we know we cannot be judged because you said would the saints not judge the earth lord so as we do there let us just be reminded again who we are and why we hear lord and why all these things are happening around us let us not look into anything else but your word father and ask that you'll just help us to reveal reveal more of you to us every day lord this lord of sickness you see brother john lord that brother he believes father he is a believer lord and he even prays for a cat lord jesus and he even goes against that spirit of cancer lord that demon lord that just so so rampantly rage this world lord where there is no answer to and he he believes lord he believes that you can heal and lord i pray on that confession lord and lord on that faith lord that you would just work on that behalf of that young man lord and lord i pray that his words will not fall to the ground lord lord that his faith will just increase and lord no matter what happens it's your will but may he still be a believer lord and and and and whatever happens if the cat lives or dies he believes it will live i believe too lord but that he will see the purpose of god and law not what the devil is trying to show him that is this the god you serve same as what he did with brother branham when he went to him and said he took your wife he took your child is this the god you surf after everything you do lord what a prophet lord what a man that can stand before you and say yes lord i was about to agree with the devil but then i said blessed be the name of the lord god giveth and god taketh away lord and that is the one thing that we have as we have you so lord may you come out of this word may you come alive for each one of us give us strength lord lord no sickness can touch us anymore lord people got covert they're getting healed people got sick you are healed the lord lord but that is not where we should be focusing right now we should be thinking of the end time and how this book is closing and what we are for the people around us the mercy seat of god upon this earth is a light that is a candle that is lit and put on a heal lord is for a city may our candles shine for you i pray lord jesus in the wonderful name of our lord jesus christ amen amen saints god bless you we're going to ask brother ed to come and lead us in some songs
