everything but yeah i will start a normal time that quarter past ten will start the play then then we'll just have have that then we just have the preaching everything after that so yeah I mean let's just go to jus Tirana me will just read from chapter 16 will read from verse 1 and it says this it says observe the month of of a burb which is April and keep the Passover unto the Lord thy God from the month of ever the LORD thy God brought the forth out of Egypt by night thou shall therefore sacrifice to pass over unto the lord thy god of the flock and the hood and the place which the lord shall choose to place his name there that's very important to us thou shalt not eat no unleavened bread with it seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread there in even the bread of affliction for the hour cometh forth out of the land of Egypt and hast that thou mayst remember the day when now come as fourth of the land Egypt all the days of their life and there shall be no living bread seen with thee and although Co seven days neither shall there be anything of the flesh which are sacrificed sacrificed the first day at even remain all night until the morning thou may us not sacrifice the Passover within any of thy gates which the LORD thy God giveth thee but at the place which the LORD thy God shall choose to place his name in there shall they'll sacrifice the Passover even at the going down of the Sun at the season that thou cometh forth out of Egypt and thou shalt roast and eat in the place which a lot of thy God shall choose and thou shalt turn in the morning and go into their tents six days shalt thou eat unleavened bread and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly for the Lord thy God thou shalt do no work there and I mean let's just pray together get Lord Jesus father we want to worship you and obey Lord not out of not out of rules but out of love father what you've done for us Lord with Lord we know that Lord we could live a million lifetimes and we could live every one for you but it would never repay the love debt we owe to you or God for what you've done for us and butter because when we could not go to where you were lured you came down to us O Lord you reach down your hand to us father and I'm so thankful you came that day to me Lord and father we just pray as we look into your word now father may you just come Lord you're the author of your work and father were so thankful that this what we just read it was written many thousands of years ago but it's still alive and fresh today as his first Moses pinned it down and father i pray you just come and speak out Lord speak out of your word to us I pray speak every heart O God and father may you just cause us to have a closer walk with thee O Lord and father we love you we thank you it can be gathered here in the middle of the week and father I just pray the busyness of maybe what we have to do tomorrow would just be laid aside Lord and we just sit here Lord and we just Lord we just rejoice and let off the pressure in your presence oh god please may you grant it father may you receive all the glory and honor and praise Lord because you deserve it all Lord and we love you and thank you in Jesus Christ's name Amen I mean you may you may be seated now I'd like to speak tonight I thought you know so so Melanie your your question is not forgotten we will get there don't worry it's not forgotten but I felt from last just from a week ago I felt to speak upon this and we have a very interesting piece of scripture here because God is declaring in a place where he puts his name that is that is God's chosen place of worship and we so we want to worship God where he has chosen us to worship because if we worship Him where is not chosen us to worship it's in vain and so it's a very critical thing even though the book of Deuteronomy who was written thousands of years ago we know this is the old testament some would say it's just history but everything God has written to us is for a purpose and he is giving instruction here that we would understand that there's a place that is provided by God and there's a provided place of worship that we must go and worship God in and I'm sure you're all familiar with the sermon by the ramp reached on God's chosen God's only chosen provided place of worship and it's going to go into the scripture and look into this now we have here we have Moses instructing the people where God says the place where I put my name that's where you worship do not worship anywhere else do not worship in your gates we just redo not worshipping your gate worship in the place where I have put my name and we will look into the scripture and we will see that that is not a geographical location like it was in the old testament but that place is available to everyone who'll come God's provided away and that place is not actually a location but it is a person and that is because God put his name and his son Jesus Christ and we'll go through the scripture and see this but so it's vital because he said do not worship and in any of your gates so you were instructed do not worship anywhere with this man's religion do not do not worship anywhere that is not of me and we know the only place provided can be the truth of God's Word because this is God in print form and we can see we you know we won't read it but if but if maybe a bit of homework you can go to first Kings chapter 12 and and there's an account there of Jeroboam and what happens is jira bombers as has given 10 10 of the 12 tribes what happens is God takes takes the kingdom from from Solomon the majority of it from his son and he gives 10 10 tribes to Jeroboam which was Solomon's enemy and two tribes were reserved for Solomon's son and what happens now is Jeroboam he he he he does not have Jerusalem the the ten tribes he has does not have Jerusalem and at that day once here that got to Jerusalem to worship because of that day that was God's provided place of worship that is where the temple was that's where the Ark of the Covenant was and God instructed Moses at the high priest once a year would go into the Holy of Holies where the Ark of the Covenant was with the blood and if the high priest was accepted that sacrifice was accepted then the sins of the people were forgiven them it was that it was that essential you know they they they had their Levites where they live they had their they would sacrifice where they lived as well but if that sacrifice wasn't accepted it was all in vain so they had to go once a year up to Jerusalem and they had to observe this time when the high priest winning with the blood and he he was afraid that if the people would go to Jerusalem then their hearts would be turned turned to his enemy because at that time Israel was divided it was civil war so he devised the plan that he would he wrecked two golden cuffs and he would put one in Bethel and one and Dan and he told the people it's too hard for you to go all the way to Jerusalem just go worship there so what happened now has he turned the people from God's provided place of worship and he made man-made places of worship and and they were turned into them and if you keep reading the book of kings and second Kings you know it's his cinder bombs sin of making the these two golden cuffs that was always remembered and it was always held against them and that I'd all just worship that man-made religion that came in there you know it causes rayul do to go down because they were not worshipping and God's provided place of worship because if they worship and gods provide a place of worship then everything God said they would would would receive forgiveness of sins living with God living among them the supernatural power to drive out every enemy the you know to actually have fellowship with God if they worship God said worship in this place they would receive that but if they worship somewhere else they would not receive that and that is why Israel came into a cold formula state where where the scribes and Pharisees were just arguing debating and learning the scripture and all these things they had no power of God with them they only had they said we have Moses if they really had Moses they would have had the god of Moses they would have had that same supernatural God but they didn't have them because all they had was a form and you know jesus said you you tithe and menton and cumin and anise and all these things but you've laid aside the weightier matters of the law judgment & mercy and faith these things you ought to have done what had happened they had laid aside the more important things yeah why because they weren't worshipping God's provided place anymore and so that's why it is vital because it's still the same today because man does not change history just repeats itself and if we can see the mistakes of the past we can avoid them today because we're just that man is just as susceptible to to to go the wrong way today as he was then because they knew the scripture they knew the scripture better than we do you know this a is a story like the scribes and Pharisees those who really really read the Old Testament apparently they could they could because of the scrolls they could wind up the scroll and they could put a pin through that Torah and they could actually tell you every letter every every jot and tittle that it would pierce through that's how well they just knew it written out now there's not a person here you pick up a Bible you roll it up you put something through it that'd be us excuse the pun a stab in the duck you wouldn't know where it goes through hey they could recite it from Genesis all the way to Malachi they could recite it perfect amazing amen so they knew the lid of it pretty good but that did not help them move but they still move from God's provided place of worship so now we will go I just want to let us go to Malachi chapter 3 we're just going to read a few scriptures and I'm just going to come down and just show you I just thought I'd tell you from the very GetGo that God's provided place of worship and this day is being in Christ that is it that is God's provided place of worship it's not a building it's not a denomination it's not a system of religion but it's being in Christ and if you're in Christ you are in God's provided place of worship so it's a very important things we just got to malachi chapter three and we'll read this verse one from I'm and Matthew are going to go back a bit because i want to show you and and i'm sure we have already gone through this but it's important to see that that that jehovah of the old testament became Jesus of the new it's not to God's not too different gods revealing themselves as the same God all the way down through the scripture and so that's why what he said in John I'm in Deuteronomy that we read applies today because if he put that on Israel then and he's the same God he'll put it on us today so Malachi 3 and verse 1 it says behold I'll send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me and the Lord whom you seek shall suddenly come to his temple even the messenger of the Covenant whom you delight and behold he shall come saith the lord of hosts but who may abide the day of his coming and who shall stand when he appeareth for he is like a refiners fire and a full of soap and so now what we have is this this messenger he says there that the angel of the Covenant will suddenly come to his temple and Malachi is telling them there that they actually delight in this one and we understand that this messenger of the Covenant was the angel of the Lord that led Israel out of Egypt into the Promised Land this was the one who appeared as a pillar of fire by night and a cloud by day and here saying now that he will send one before one before him that will prepare the way and then this very God that they believed then would suddenly come down into his temple and he would become known to them and we understand from reading from Isaiah that that there be a voice of one crying in the wilderness to prepare the way of the Lord and that one that was the voice crying in the wilderness is the same one here that is the messenger too and he prepare the way before me and we understand from the scripture that was John the Baptist he had a ministry to introduce the people to the messenger of the Covenant he was he had the ministry to introduce Jehovah God to the people and so and he looked out his commission and there came a day where there there was a man who stood among them yo John was so sure of his commission he says he's standing among you now and he would begin to tell the priests and the Pharisees that the daily sacrifices daniel said would be done away with and and he began to one day he looked out over the crowd and he saw one as his behold he comes the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world here comes the man that will do away with the daily sacrifice and he pointed out this one he says he says I'll known because the Spirit of God will descend upon him and abide upon him only John saw that supernatural manifestation but when Jesus went into the water there and he was baptized said the heavens were opened and the Spirit of God like a dub descended upon him and as a voice came out of the heaven saying behold this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased and this scripture was being fulfilled right in front of them because Jesus spoke of his body is the temple amen so that scripture was fulfilled right in front of them so that that that great pillar of fire that being that spoke to Moses out of the burning bush that one who who appeared you know he said Moses said to him I want to see you and God said to him you can't see me but just just my back parts and put him on the cleft of the rock and he passed by him and all the supernatural you know splendour on these things and Moses said I just saw the back parts of a man that one was now in a body of flesh and he came down to the body of flesh because the daily sacrifice had to be done away with because we understand from the scripture that the blood of bulls and goats could not change a man it just covers the Sun and they would go out with the same signaled sinful desire so I had to come a day where God would undo that son curse and a man and actually give them a heart of faith that one day they would stumble and fall of things that maybe were passed out from their family but then one day God would come and purge that man out and God would come and dwell in that man and they wouldn't be overcome by this sinful wish any more halloo I'm so glad for that so now we have the serg's asst says he says in John 5 and verse 43 he says I come in my father's name but you received me not and the angel Gabriel told Mary you shall call his name Jesus for he shall take it he shall save his people from their sin and in those days people didn't have surnames they just had one name behold your name is Simon you know Simon bar Jonah Simon son of Jonah he was just called Simon they only had one name and so if jesus said I come in my father's name and you receive me not that means now that the name of the Father is Jesus Amen because the very name Jesus means Jehovah Savior so now here was God's salvation being manifested in flesh and also Paul would begin to say in Ephesians 3 that the whole family in heaven on earth is called Jesus amen the believers because the believer takes on their saviors name as a as a woman takes on the husband's name when they are married so was the Bride of Christ when we are united with with our Lord Jesus we take on his name I mean that's why the whole family in heaven and earth is called Jesus so we understand that when God said there is a provided place of worship that I will I will give you access to and I will put my name in that place he's saying that in him as that provided place of worship and him as that place where you can truly worship me and spirit and truth amen are we thankful that we have access to that provided place because Cain and Abel they they both approach God and we can see all the way down through the scripture that it was blood blood had to be shared a life had to be given that man and God could have fellowship together and we see Abel there he had a revelation it was blood and he offered a lamb and that lamb was just a pre figure of the lamb to come Annie Annie sacrifice at lamb and God accepted a sacrifice amen he was at that time in God's provided place of worship because it was revealed to him the lamb had to die that he could go free and it's been all the way down that's way that's why Moses when he gave the Lord you must offer this sin offering and this is the trespass offering and this is you know all these different offerings and they were all a shadow pointing to the offering that would come which is Jesus Christ and we read from the book of Hebrews Paul is trying to get these Hebrew believers to to show them what you have now is greater in Christ than it was in the old testament the sacrifice of christ is greater it has more power in it it is more effective you know Paul would tell them that by one offering he has perfected them forever that are sanctified so they didn't you know Paul would begin to lay out he didn't have to give us blood every year like the high priest would take the blood and didn't have to offer it one more time it was done once and forever was settled and so he was trying to get these Hebrew people to be your lifted up out of there you know they came out of they came out of following the law as their fathers did but they are in that middle ground from coming out of their old religion and coming fully into Christ and that's why he would Paul where I say let us go on let us go on from what we have and in the end of the book of Hebrews he says let us go beyond the camp I mean let us go unto him beyond the camp amen so he was telling him we must go on and he said that because of one time the provider place of worship was what they did but because the lamb came when Jesus died on Calvary hey the day before that happened the lamb that was given their outer sincere heart that was an effect that blood was in effect but then when he shed his blood upon the earth that matter how many lambs the worshipers would bring it doesn't do any good because God had moves his provided place of worship and now was in the Sun and we understand that the blood of bulls and goats could only cover sin it could not truly bring man and God back into fellowship like God wanted us to be because we're sinners God cannot dwell you know we we see in the Old Testament when winner when someone came down with leprosy you read you read there in the days of Moses a leprous person could not even be within the camp where they are you know Tabernacle in the wilderness was in the middle and the tribes were situated around the outside someone with leprosy couldn't even be among the people they had to be outside of the camp and it shows how God when when sin is present how much actually separates a person from the presence of God and the blood of bulls and goats could only just cover that Senate could not actually bring man into the fellowship that Adam and Eve had before the fall that could not do it because it was animal life it was a lower kind of life that was shed we understand animals do not have souls they you know you go back however many thousands of years in a chimpanzees a chimpanzee then he still does the same things today a dog back then Ursula dog today they do exactly the same thing you know some birds will migrate up to Siberia then they'll come back down to New Zealand and they'll go back up to Siberia again it's just an endless cycle because they're governed by a law that's in them they can't learn a bit away it's just them that's what they do but a man is different but because we have a soul that's why man has always been you know studying and learning how to how to how to improve their society and improve their technology is because they have a soul on them as different kind of life so animal life could not come back on the worship her and change that worshipper so that's why God had to become as a man and when when when John pointed about as the Lamb of God he says here comes the Sun offering I mean they can take away the sin of the world and we understand that when the life because it's not if I had a vial of Jesus's blood it would be a priceless thing but it's only the chemical aspect of the blood it's the life that was in that blood which is more important because that those cells were just matter that came out of the earth and they would decay go back into the earth of olive oil because did things rot you following me if I just had evolved it but the life and that blood went when that blood cell was released sat down Calvary the life that was in him now was released onto the worshiper amen that that that life would burn out that sin nature and every man who would believe every woman that would believe and it would make them a new creature a new creation in Christ Jesus hallelujah because when Paul is saying that we are new creatures or you look at that word is as your new creation that's not the old creation patched up a believer is not a patched up you know just a model one thing new creation completely hallelujah we are new crap we've been made over I mean the old me you don't even know the old me I'm so glad you don't know that guy he's a scallywag praise the Lord amen but we are new creatures we are new creations hallelujah why because the life that was in the blood that that hang on Calvary comes into you and changes you and now because that blood is shed because without the shedding of blood Paul says there is no remission of sin there is no ability approach to God to have fellowship so now the blood has been shed and when we accept that blood by faith and the life that was in that blood comes into you it throws you into unity with God that God and man becomes one unit again just like Adam and evil one unit and the garden it makes man who serve a will that will come and makes them one that's why Paul says in the book of Ephesians great is the mystery you know speaking of of he speaks of the husband and the wife he says great as that mystery speaking of Christ and His Church that too would become one flesh amen so when the life is released into you you become one yes amen so now you are in God's provided place of worship amen hey the priests were anointed they are anointed with oil to symbolize the Holy Spirit God's / coming upon them amen is the same thing with us we're not just anointed all as a symbol but what that was pointing to the life of God coming and dwelling in the believer now we are walking because when you're sealed into that provided place of worship you cannot leave that provide a place of worship Amen because you're walking in the spirit of god amens now let's go to Romans chapter 8 we just read a couple of scriptures here hey if we know that's why it's not a denomination that's not knowing some doctrine does not have some some kind of teaching or you know God did not put his name in the Baptist gate on the methodist gate on the Catholic gate he put his name in geez is Christ and if you're in him then you can only worship God before you actually become one with him you're just believing unto a man until the day he comes and receives your faith and you know he's received your faith because he comes and lives in you how do you know you receive because you have met him amen that's how you know you received so it says here now so let's read here let's read eight and we'll read verse start from Romans 8 will reave in verse 8 it says so then they that are in the and the flesh cannot please God say that walk after the flesh cannot please God but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit and if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of crises none of us and if Christ being you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life unto righteousness pardon me but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by a spur that dwelleth in you therefore brethren we're not debtors I mean we are dead is not to the flesh to live after the flesh but if you live after the flesh you shall die but if you through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the flesh you shall live for as many as a lead of the Spirit of God they are the sons of God for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption by you cry ever father for the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then heirs is of God and joint heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him we may also be glorified together so what he's saying here now is that if you have see if Christ be in you he says your your natural man is dead and then he says if you have the spirit home the raised up Jesus I'm dead he'll also quicken that Saints real quick it'll make a life change your mortal body why is that because you are end God's provided place of worship yeah Alleluia and that's why I says do not live after the flesh he says he says if we threw the spirit mortify the deeds of the body we shall live what does that mean that doesn't mean physically you get up and say body you're dead all nature you did and you try and work yourself into it no but there's a law of faith that if you believe it will cause this flesh to come into subjection to the spirit that's within you amen that's why I say it's not about trying to stay because you know I remember I was driving to a Christian campuses not even in the message but another one and thus and one of my sister's friends driving and I and I said to them you know there's a place that God has placed his name when we must worship Him she's driving along as he turns around and looks me right in the eye she's driving like a hundred case on the road you know she's like where's you know she's also caught up where is that because people want to be able to do something where can I go what mountain cannot climb where can I go seek something in my own strength yeah but we're not called to do that we call to lay ourselves upon the altar and let him do it amen to help so it's not us that it's like Lord if I can stay in that provided place he keeps you in that provided place if you reckon yourself dead you'll stand that provide a place of worship and and we know that we have God's provided place of worship because we have the true interpretation to this because jesus said by teaching the commandments and doctors have meant to the scribes and Pharisees it says the Word of God you make the Word of God no effect so because they made their own place of worship just like Jeroboam made the calves so it doesn't have to be a big Idol like a big buddha in a place how do people craft idols they take scripture and they take things and they and they craft it all together remember god's word interprets itself you don't need to add any interpretation you just take the scripture and align up from Genesis to Revelation yeah so but then if people take scriptures they build scriptures and all these things see I could I could go to Deuteronomy and I could build an idol and say we must keep feasts and we must keep New Moon's we must keep Sabbath's and you know every mouth should be circumcised up to eight days old we should wear the things in dual you know what is that that's making an idol it's not rightly dividing the word of truth and if you do that you have your own provided place of worship but if you had the truth of the word then you have God's provided place of worship yep is that all right so now Jesus as I said Jesus and Jesus is his word now I'm just going to wrap it up a little bit now I was going to bring it all together if i Ken but Jesus isn't John 1 it says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the same was in the beginning with God and all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made as his in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shine earth and darkness and the darkness comprehended not he then he begins to speak out about John the Baptist so saying that this word that was with God and was God by this word everything was made and then Paul picks it up and it and he says in Ephesians I think it's chapter 3 that Jesus Christ made the world's it wasn't the man the man of Galilee but it was before he became flesh because we read here in Perth in John chapter 1 verse 14 and that same word became flesh and dwelt among us so that same God that led Israel into you know out of Egypt into the Promised Land became flesh and that man Jesus Christ and and he did that now because in the old testament that was God's provided place of worship bring the offering here's the priest here's the altar here's the high priest you know and they had to come that way but then David speaks of Melchizedek and he says that Jesus he didn't know him as Jesus then he said this one shall be made after the order of Melchizedek and then a male kids Aquino met Abraham after Abraham rescued lot from the Kings the purpose is going this way and then he he knew who he was because Abraham a few chapters later in Genesis chapter 18 when he saw the same one come to him but in a body of flesh he said Lord I'm ever meal with me he actually recognize that was God came down and spoke to him God came down to flesh and had a meal with him and then nothing else is mentioned now of Melchizedek until we come down to Paul there in the book of Hebrews and he says this Melchizedek it says without beginning of days without end of life without father or mother you know without the scent and all these things you know he's saying that Jesus now was made up the order of Melchizedek Annie any identifies us as Melchizedek as an eternal being yep without mother father beginning of days end of life who's that someone eternal who's eternal God yep so Paul was saying that this Jesus now was a high priest after that order as an eternal high priest so Jesus is there in the days of his flesh and and they went to the temple and then and and and his disciples now because in those days that temple was God's provide a place of worship yep and his disciples said look how goodly these stones are and that same jesus said no don't you know that not one stone will remain atop another nellis fulfilled went on the days of Titus they burnt the whole place took out all the stones to get the gold out that that that melted in between but now here's a man so beforehand there was a temple and there was a high priest it was blood three separate things yep now here comes a man who is the temple he spoke of his body's a temple Jesus Christ and him was the blood and he was the high priests I mean because he could only in the Old Testament type the high priest took the blood into the Holy of Holies and that symbolizes the people were forgiven but now he took his own blood that's why he's hit the Mary don't touch me because I having ascended yet and then afterwards he ascended he came back daddy said now touched me Thomas touched me touched the wounds and all these things failed me so now here's the high priest now he takes us he takes his blood into the presence of God and that's accepted and then we know it's accepted because of their Pentecost that same spirit came down and dwells and the people member he is the word in the beginning was the word so now here's the Word made flesh and he took his blood to the presence of God him it is a provider place of worship and then he comes back down and then Peter stands up full of that same spirit and he begins to tell the people how they get into that provided place of worship because he said this is that spoken by the Prophet Joel he because they preach this is that I'll pour my spirit out upon all flesh he begins and then they say had away because he he preaching in such a way he said you're guilty you killed your own Messiah his bloods on your head he just preached it as her as he could and so now now they say hey we're busted we're guilty hey we're condemned how could I get this off how can I get it off my conscience off my hands whatever you want to put it he says now because remember without the shedding of blood is no remission of sins yeah so how do you receive because the blood the Bloods dried on the ground it was done 50 days ago his body's not even the tumor you know he's ascended so they can't go physically and get the blood and try and apply it to themselves yeah so how do they how do they receive this blood to get the remission of sin you know how do they do it and then Peter just tell some real simple repent be baptized name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost you shall come into God's provided place of worship hallelujah and they received it in their own gods provide a place of worship amen oh it's pretty simple isn't it hallelujah but that was God's provided hey was that there was a certain channel that the people had to walk through the Old Testament they had to get a lamb had to be a certain age you know when they when they did the you know the we read about the Passover had to be a certain animal had to be without blemish they had to keep it up for a certain amount of days and then they had to kill it and they had to apply the blood they do all certain think and they said if you do these things in the death angel will pass over you there was a provided place provided channel or way to to be covered by the blood that they would be free from the wrath that would fall upon Egypt and then we read there in Deuteronomy that they shall eat unleavened bread seven days and that is showing you the unleavened read it because living and the scripture is sin and Jesus said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God so he's actually saying this unleavened bread you must keep as you must eat the word become one with the word but that would must not be living by man's ideas because of us it's living with men's ideas you've done what your Obama's done you made a golden calf and you can't go to Jerusalem anymore and receive what Jerusalem has amen hallelujah so Peter gave the instructions and those people went into God's provide a place of worship amen we have received the instructions that I know nearly eight years ago I went into God's provide a place of worship Alleluia and I've been stuck in there ever since amen i wouldn't want to leave and you can't leave because if you're sealed in not just anointed but sealed into the kingdom I mean you're stuck in God's provided place of worship because it's a person where I said it he is the word Peter gave them the word and the people that receive as many as believe will baptize yes Amen hallelujah praise the Lord queer see musicians a man we are in God's provide a place of worship thank you lose same it's not complicated as many as believed it was revealed to them they were baptized amen and they just walk in it that's right hey I'm glad aren't you thankful yeah we don't worshiping some gate that's why I say the name of this building this buildings are relevant it's not about the building it's not about the name doesn't matter what church you go does not about the church is about the people i mean and their relationship with God Alleluia and you know what I love about it is we didn't go because some people you know people make movies about finding some rare flower on the top of the Himalayas and and and curing some disease and doing all these things and they and they spend years trying to study things and you know there's a group of professors at at Canterbury University and they would look into natural products to try and cure cancer they went down they dived off or go these sea sponges and they did all these kinds of things trying to find something that can cure a sickness now we didn't go find it it found us I mean God's provide a place of worship found you allu you Amy that just

not just a church we're not just Christian people you know we're not just wear you out but with a blood bought redeem ones of God don't let the devil or ever tried twisted from you saying you that doesn't belong to you you know we can go into the scripture maybe to null do it the way to the Tree of Life all the way to God's provide a place of worship has always been guarded you read Genesis more that flaming sword of the cherubim was put there not to protect the tree of life to protect the way to the Tree of Life so it was it's being guarded because I said same chair members come all the way down through the scripture to protect the way so some people feel like security security let some people look security doesn't let other people in yeah and once upon a time that chair of them was guarding the way to keep people out but now it is actually causing driving people back into the tree of life and that tree of life is Christ you say how does that work one day God begin to tag on your heart and you begin to be influenced by an unseen realm and you couldn't what maybe couldn't put it in words but maybe I just put it in words for you yet that chair of them that guarded the way is begin to drive you in amen hallelujah hey and that's true amen there's a lot more here than you if you could just see all of heaven is for you amen we're not in this alone friends hallelujah let's
