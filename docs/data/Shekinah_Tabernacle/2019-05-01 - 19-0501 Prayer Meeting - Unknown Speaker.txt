[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] yeah I love that song I mean it's just if you got your Bibles let's go to Deuteronomy 32 I'm just going to read here Deuteronomy 32 in verse 30 I mean go from verse 30 which is really a couple of just a couple of verses here it says how should one chase a thousand and to put ten thousand to flight except their rock had sold them and the Lord had shut them up for their rock is not our rock even our enemies themselves being judges Amen I just wanted to read that dear the rock is not our rock I mean let's just bow heads in a word of Prayer thank you Lord Jesus that the battle is yours thank you Lord that you do call us to walk out upon the water father to show we have dominion over the works of the devil Lord even our own flesh Lord Jesus we are victorious Lord we thank you that we are overcomers and father's what a commit this time of Prayer into your hands Lord we thank you we serve a supernatural God

you bless our time of Prayer father we thank you we can gather this night Lord and your presence Lord just to let off the pressure we always look forward to the middle of the week Lord just where you can have a Time Lord to set ourselves aside with you and father may you just strength it out in a man Lord may you may your Holy Spirit fall on each heart here and may you do what you want to do in this service Lord may you grant it father bit those who couldn't be here tonight father be their portion laws we want to commit our lives into your hands and we thank you in Jesus Christ's name Amen I think God bless your friends you may have your seats tonight so what I want to speak about the power of unity about how he said that one will chase at the hours and and two will put thousand to flight and so there is power and unity you know one one is not as powerful as two and it says in the book of our believe it's Ecclesiastes that a three-fold cord is not easily broken I mean but one strand or even two strands can be broken easily but a three-fold could not be broken now what do I was thinking about how we have the you know the Lord said there's nothing impossible with us all things are possible to the end of belief so nothing is impossible with you right now brother Branham would speak about he would speak about in a few places he see he says when to omnipotence meet and many times your omnipotent means all-powerful and we know God is all-powerful when we can say you if I said Jesus Christ is omnipotent he's all-powerful there's nothing limited and it can do all things everyone would say Amen right but then if I said the second omnipotent that meets with the other omnipotent as you can you say the same Amen can you say the same amen amen I just want to say you know if I could just lift up what God has made us a little bit we are his workmanship and and he does a good job he does a proper job he doesn't do a half PI job he doesn't do a Kiwi job he does a real job amen so he does so if that's the case we shouldn't shrink back if Jesus himself said nothing's all things are possible to them that believe that means there's nothing limited and what you can do so I believe we shouldn't limit our faith we shouldn't put a limit we shouldn't put a full-stop er in there under that's right after our faith but we should believe that all things are possible and they are possible we know in this hour that God has poured out his spirit and its fullness in this day there is nothing impossible you amen there's absolute power on the believer amen so he says what happens when to omnipotence meet when God and man comes together to omnipotence something's got to shake whatever you say with that creative power of the omnipotence of God knowing that he's promised it and he said it in his word it creates a power that goes out yonder and brings things to pass things that is not it makes him as though they are because to omnipotence have met there he stands overs and he wonderful how many think of when Moses and God came together to omnipotence came together when Moses came to the burning bush it was promised in his word that God would deliver his people I mean to to omnipotence came together hallelujah deals power in the unity when god and manny united together there's nothing can stand before them amen and he winked under egypt an 80 year old man with a stickiness had two young uns and his wife on a donkey walk down into Egypt and he took over nothing stopped him amen he the very purpose he went to Egypt he accomplished that purpose he said well God said through him let my people go and Pharaoh had to let them go hallelujah Moses was perseverant Amen and that's what we need in this days of Buda grit but a determination I mean not just to sit back and say well what will be will be I say no I mean if God's Word says it that'll be that's how it should be I mean it should be in our hearts we are believe we are called to believe all things are possible there is no limit on a man's faith brother Bram said that if there was not a law to stop it you could speak your own private world into existence and go live on it because of God is in you the Creator is in you the one who said let there be Sun Moon the Stars is in you I mean but if there wasn't something holding back that power then it could happen but God doesn't want us to live on our own private world wouldn't it be nice though but he doesn't he hasn't called us to do that but that powers in you yeah yeah now and I'll just read now the ones sound he says now the first thing you know so I said Moses United with God did what he is called to take it all through the scripture amen author of the scripture Joshua Caleb United with God Rahab United with the promise with the token you know the you know the end of the story but she United with omnipotence I mean two of neverland's MIT and the supernatural took place you take it all the way through the scripture and he's the same God today and we're the same kind of believers today because if we were alive back then if we're alive in Moses day we would have gone all the way with Caleb and Joshua took our inheritance we had because we're real believers if we live Noah we would have been in the army time souls would have been saved yeah hallelujah all the way down through amen if you know what David you would have been one of his mighty men you would have been in the kingdom you wouldn't get anything that came against you or David hallelujah you would have been with Elisha Mount Carmel hallelujah you would have been the seventh because you're a real believer thank you hallelujah take it all the way you know you'll be with the wise men you would have been with the Shepherd's you would have been with the apostles I mean you would have been down through wherever the true believe was you would have been there yes and fulfilled what they fulfilled but now we live in another day where God still has believers and his word must be fulfilled so little old Martha came running out there this is from John 11 speaking of the resurrection of Lazarus and she said Lord oh I like that you see she titled him what he was he was her Lord if that would have been here my brother would not have died see even now whatever you ask God God will give it to you nothing uncertain about that no sir see see that's when two positives meet that's when two omnipotence meet see when one omnipotent she had she had perfect omnipotent faith in Christ and Christ was omnipotent see she had perfect infinite faith in Christ that he was the Lord and knowed whatever he asked God God would give it to him in other words she said you just speak the word that's all you have to do whatever you ask God God will give it to you oh that's omnipresent all-powerful because he just said so see all right he was all-powerful and when two powers went to omnipotent powers meet together it's a contact me hallelujah now that's that's on the positive side I solicit I was having fellowship actually father Jean and thus and thus struck me he was speaking about we are where brother Branham was was casting out evil spirits and brother Brown would see the demon power on people and he would call that one and then he'd call out another and he said look can't you see those two spirits are calling out for help and when the one called out for help when the other one tried to help it I mean it was cast out as well hallelujah so now the devil tries to unbelief tries to go to another person a mentoring to to keep hold on the person and means the demon powers combine themselves together to try and reinforce themselves that the person won't receive the promise I mean should they unite right now you know I mean but faith unites as well I mean if two demons can can can't call one to the other help me I'm being inspired help me train me this people run believe the promise help me make this person humbly that they won't accept what's being revealed I mean you have demon path and cool that felt how much more fighting how much more believers people that one to another their faith good contact I need help I'm in my family's way with all their sickness or this trouble of is my metals look whatever it may be I mean how much more when faith connects that's over here we are for a pre-meeting hallelujah I mean there's more than two here it's quite a few believers in this place hallelujah so now our faith should should unite together amen amen unbelief tries to reinforce itself how much more when believers unite together and faith amen and we we are like Martha or Mary we know he is the resurrection and the life we've seen him in this day he's alive he's present right now amen you believe it yes you believe he's present now see with two or three gathered in my name there I am in the midst so he's between you and the person next year he's between you and the person across the room from you he's praising his angels are praising his angels ascend to minister to the ears of salvation I mean so his angels are praising he's present and we're just going to say just unleash your face don't don't reason how's it going to work out God will take care of the working out God does the details we don't need to take your the details we just send forth and we just talk to him in faith amen lift our petitions into his presence and he'll take care of it amen we don't need all how's it gonna happen I don't know I'm not that's not my problem he's in the business of taking care of it not me you just gotta believe in faith it's like a little child I know it's funny you see it quite a lot but a little charges here daddy one of these girls daddy I wanna Lully I want chocolate I wanna something they don't know where it's gonna come from necessarily they're not interested they just wanna it's all they care about I want my lolly I know Jesus said if you had the faith of a little child now that faith is a revelation if you just have the revelation of what's that it's been revealed it's revealed to these three ones daddy can get it right it's real simple but that's how you got to have that kind of Revelation faith to enter the kingdom daddy has it Mommy has it I just need to go ask them amen and they'll give it to me right just the same thing with you and I we all have Revelation faith I meant the believer does not Evans elect you'll fight we do not intellectually believe that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever it's been revealed to us Espie he's made himself known that he's alive Amy and no I'm not talking about in 1965 when the Prophet was here but in 2019 the same God that was back there is here and he's revealed himself to you and I declaring himself what you hear on tape on the same God to show you that that that prophet was a genuine prophet I backed him up you believe his word I'll back you up hallelujah and he spoke the Bible Amy so backed out the mean so I want it they're not worried about do you have money can you how's it gonna should be the same thing with you and I if we're faith is a little child and and you know if they want something 99.999% the time they're not afraid to ask me it can be the most ridiculous time a night or day daddy they're not worried I want that they belonging they have a thirst they have a desire they wanted to be met so they come ask me right they don't say well how am I gonna ask this or how should i word it just ride on then you say daddy I want this can I have this say please please I know it's a very crude expression but we have to be that way cry I heard brother Bram say a baby God put a law and a baby a way of asking they cry out and they cry out and they cry out and they cry out until finally I meant the parent answers I mean we have to be the same way brother Graham said you know you can put a bail in the end the court and say now little Johnny we're advanced kind of people now you know we got the technology ring the bell do you think it's gonna ring the bell oh I think just his cry and it makes a big noise it's not a dignified it becomes a mess ever seen a little baby that's really been crying it's not an everything and greed and all kinds of things it's not worried about what it looks like it's not worried it just wants something and it will not rest until it gets what it needs and but the problem is we care too much about what other people think of us we care too much about what Oh what will that person say first mentioned a few cents now Johnny don't you care what I think you you look ridiculous and Johnny you just got I don't care I need a drink money money future I need something yes we should be the same way because because if you're a real believer and you see someone break through and really touch God you will be blessed and you'll be happy you won't criticize them you'll rejoice Jesus feet was being washed one night or one day the scribes and Pharisees were critical to the woman who did it was Jesus critical no my feet are ticklish don't do that you know you using the wrong alabaster box you know oh he he received the worship and she didn't care she passed the point of no return I've got an annoyed he's unwelcome I'm gonna make him feel welcome it's not even my house but I'm gonna make him feel welcome in this house and she broke yell the best a box he wiped his feet with tears hallelujah amen she got what she needed and she was in a critical place the people around here were critical that's what I mean how much more and will believers and we hear one heart one mind one Accord hallelujah so we should cry cry out oh but you know what makes us what makes us be silent it's the devil makes us silent you say I might not be a very noisy kind of person but you can still cry I've seen quiet people cry and cry out I've seen loud people cry and cry out me you may be in the different ends of the spectrum but you know all babies cry right all babies they don't care about anyone until they give what they need and sometimes they keep crying just to rub it in but we're not mean to do that dot God be not I mean yeah they they have a thirst and they must have admit we should be the same way I mean I don't mean to be joking but one you don't think about why should we sit sit back and Frances bet on unity oh yeah we're all believers we want to see a rapture Amen we want to see our loved ones come in what even these I love it when God answers prayer you know I'm like hallelujah hey thank you at least you answered amen so I'm just but we're here we're here to see God move so I just gonna read out some prayer requests maybe if you want to stop the streaming well the first one is so brother posses to us to give thanks and glory to God
