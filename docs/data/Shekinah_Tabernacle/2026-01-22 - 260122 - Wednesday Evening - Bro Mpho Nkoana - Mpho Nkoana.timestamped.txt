[37:00] course to encourage one another to
[37:02] motivate one another to remind one

[37:06] to keep on bringing the reflection of
[37:09] actually who you are amen and on that
[37:12] basis i just want to
[37:14] uh

[37:36] creating the atmosphere and thank you

[37:48] i think you can enjoy your seats
[37:50] while i remain here alone
[37:54] amen
[37:56] and then we are going to read in the
[37:57] book of psalm chapter one but before we
[37:59] go there the brothers can just help me
[38:02] by displaying the very first slide then
[38:05] we we're going to read in the book of
[38:07] psalm chapter one
[38:10] um
[38:11] okay but before we read i just wanna
[38:14] i just want to express thanksgiving to
[38:16] the lord and tell him that i love him
[38:18] and i appreciate him with all my heart
[38:21] and
[38:22] there's no one like him
[38:24] there's no one like him i don't know how
[38:26] to tell him the more i talk about him
[38:29] the more i think about him
[38:31] the more i realized
[38:33] that he loved me and the more i realized
[38:35] who i am the more i realized how sinful
[38:39] how muddy how dirty i was
[38:42] because the closer you get to the lord
[38:44] the brighter it gets
[38:46] and
[38:47] you seen even a little peace drop of
[38:50] death
[38:51] cannot stand in the presence of the
[38:53] living god so i just wanna
[38:55] tell you that
[38:56] you are doing the same tonight amen so
[38:59] that that little slide there that is a
[39:01] piece of salt it's a little rock a
[39:04] little stone of salt it's very salty
[39:07] that one
[39:09] is a piece of salt what is that one
[39:11] little children
[39:13] sorry my voice is already running away
[39:16] and uh that is a piece of sword and i
[39:18] want to just before we start
[39:20] maybe you can sit a little bit okay i'm
[39:22] sorry we will stand up now but let's
[39:24] just sit for a second
[39:25] sorry about that i apologize sort of
[39:28] this i'm sort of disorganized you
[39:30] forgive me
[39:31] thank you so much i just want to mention
[39:34] not to i don't want to be funny
[39:36] but that piece of soul that you see
[39:38] there
[39:40] and it's very salty
[39:43] and i love it very much because it's
[39:45] salty it's doing its job
[39:48] and
[39:49] i want you to understand that salt is
[39:52] meant to salt
[39:55] i'm thankful for the service
[39:58] the preaching of the weight on sunday
[40:01] i wish i can just sit down i told
[40:02] brother ben i said brother man
[40:05] i don't know what to tell you but i want
[40:08] to sit down on wednesday i wish you can
[40:10] just continue to preach because the word
[40:12] spoke to my heart so deeply
[40:15] no i don't know about you
[40:17] but it came to me so much so that
[40:20] you know
[40:21] crying was not enough
[40:23] i didn't know what to tell the lord how
[40:26] i thank him
[40:27] for what has gone out on sunday so i
[40:30] just want to tell brother ben that i
[40:31] appreciate you my brother and may the
[40:33] lord bless you richly and may the lord
[40:36] really
[40:36] brothers and sisters let's hold up his
[40:38] hands
[40:40] because when god calls a man he doesn't
[40:42] let them let him astray and god uses you
[40:45] to hold his hands
[40:47] look to the ministry look for the
[40:48] calling not anything else
[40:51] look to the calling because god has
[40:53] called a man among us
[40:55] to help you you'll never be able to
[40:59] the prophet says you know the pastor is
[41:01] the angel of the church he says that the
[41:04] prophet
[41:05] he's the shepherd of the church you need
[41:07] to look at it through the spiritual eyes
[41:09] amen so i really appreciate you my
[41:11] brother for just forgiving yourself
[41:13] for availing yourself for letting god
[41:16] uses you
[41:17] to benefit me
[41:19] uh how many how many appreciate brother
[41:21] ben
[41:22] so
[41:24] that little sword is brother band
[41:26] that one
[41:28] is for the bed
[41:29] [Laughter]
[41:32] so that's how much we appreciate you
[41:34] brother ben
[41:35] we appreciate jesus christ in you my
[41:37] brother
[41:38] that's how much i want to tell you
[41:40] not not to you know soul to never uplift
[41:43] itself it's just salt
[41:46] so whether you went to pour water on it
[41:48] whether you want to do what if it's if
[41:51] his salt is sold
[41:53] and that's him
[41:54] um after the lord jesus christ
[41:57] if you want to have a role model
[41:59] that's your one
[42:01] old or young
[42:03] look at the jesus christ in his life
[42:06] so i just want to tell you that i love
[42:07] you my brother and i just want to thank
[42:09] god for
[42:10] uh allowing our parts to to cross
[42:13] because it's for his purpose and for his
[42:15] glory
[42:16] so okay that part of the service is done
[42:19] i want you to i wanted to tell you to
[42:22] refresh your mind that don't look at the
[42:24] man
[42:25] look at the jesus christ in the man look
[42:27] at the character look at the operation
[42:29] of the spirit look carefully
[42:31] because one day the lord jesus said to
[42:33] them
[42:34] an adulterous generation secret after a
[42:37] sign
[42:39] but there is a sign among them they
[42:41] can't see it
[42:44] we've seen different things may god help
[42:46] us to see that sign that miracle that
[42:48] god has given us
[42:50] hallelujah
[42:51] amen we're going to read psalm chapter
[42:53] one
[42:54] please stand with respect
[42:56] sorry sister megan thank you so much for
[42:59] that testimony god bless your heart my
[43:00] sister
[43:02] that was quite
[43:03] moving for me
[43:05] um
[43:07] let's read the word of god first
[43:11] if you are there just say amen
[43:15] blessed is the man that walketh not in
[43:17] the council of the ungodly
[43:20] no standeth in the way of sinners
[43:24] nor seated in the seat of the sculpture
[43:28] blessed is the man that
[43:32] blessed that is the man that walketh i
[43:34] want you to underline that weight
[43:37] blessed is the man that worketh
[43:40] to walk
[43:42] blessed is that man who walketh and not
[43:44] in the counsel
[43:45] of the sinners
[43:47] there's two
[43:48] but his delight is in the law of the
[43:51] lord
[43:53] and in his law that he meditate
[43:56] day end
[43:58] you know i like people who participate
[44:01] when i say day and you say night
[44:05] then we are
[44:06] together to meditate
[44:09] about god's law god's word day and night
[44:13] all right
[44:14] verse 3
[44:15] and he shall be that man
[44:18] or that woman
[44:20] shall be
[44:21] like a tree planted by the rivers of
[44:24] water
[44:25] that bringeth forth his fruit
[44:29] in his season
[44:31] this one who does not work in the
[44:33] council of the of the of the sinners
[44:37] on the scornful and them
[44:39] uh
[44:40] who meditate about the word of god day
[44:42] and night
[44:44] he is like the tree that is planted by
[44:46] the rivers of the water
[44:48] that bring us fruit
[44:51] fruit
[44:53] underline that word bring it fruit those
[44:56] two ways bring it fruit you walk
[44:59] right you meditate
[45:01] right you bring it fruit are we together
[45:06] i want you to sit down but let me just
[45:08] finish that vestry
[45:10] that bringeth forth his fruit in his
[45:12] season
[45:13] his life also shall not wither
[45:17] and whatsoever he do it whatsoever who
[45:20] knows the meaning of the word whatsoever
[45:25] whatsoever he do it shall prosper
[45:29] and brother john do you wanna just bless
[45:31] pray for us and bless the word of god by
[45:33] prayer let's pray together
[45:39] yes my father my god
[45:42] yes lord jesus
[45:44] hallelujah
[45:51] yes my lord
[45:52] let us grasp it further
[45:55] thank you my god
[45:56] blessed be his holy name please enjoy
[45:58] the comfort of your sis thanks brother
[45:59] john amen we are going to talk tonight
[46:03] about somehow these classes are
[46:07] they are they are wrong
[46:10] i can't see properly i don't know for
[46:12] some of the enemies just fighting
[46:13] probably
[46:15] and uh that's what we are going to speak
[46:16] about tonight we are going to speak
[46:18] about walking alone with jesus
[46:22] walking alone with jesus hallelujah
[46:25] thank you that's what we are going to
[46:27] speak about and then we i'd like her to
[46:29] take a side that
[46:30] i always hear ministers saying there's a
[46:33] title and there's a subject so today i
[46:34] thought i can copy them
[46:38] it's not like i want to try to be that
[46:40] minister
[46:41] but i thought ah i'm sure not that dream
[46:43] is excellent you know so i thought about
[46:46] it and i thought ah maybe i can edit
[46:49] you know and have a subject line in
[46:51] other words the thought line
[46:53] right in other words the line of thought
[46:57] the line of thought is creating an
[46:59] atmosphere daily
[47:01] creating an atmosphere daily why
[47:05] inside outside everywhere
[47:08] that's what you're going to speak about
[47:10] while you are working with the lord
[47:12] while you are working alone
[47:14] because working with jesus is not a
[47:16] group thing
[47:18] working with the lord is not a mother
[47:20] mama papa brother of course it is for
[47:22] them but also on an individual basis
[47:26] that is why brother and sister so many
[47:28] have died that is why so many families
[47:31] have gone apart that is why so many
[47:34] friends have separated so many have died
[47:37] so many are alive because the word of
[47:40] god is a separator
[47:43] can i show you the word of god is a
[47:46] unifier
[47:48] at the same time because it's not a
[47:51] group work
[47:53] what does that mean what that what what
[47:55] what what that means is that we don't
[47:57] come to the lord because and my friends
[48:00] are there
[48:01] we don't come to the lord because oh my
[48:03] dad no no we even though they can
[48:06] influence us and inspire us
[48:09] which is wonderful we want that but
[48:12] there must come a point in my individual
[48:14] work
[48:15] where i experience a work with god
[48:18] because when i get there my mother my
[48:21] sister my brother my daughter my friend
[48:23] won't be there brother john to be me
[48:25] i walk alone but with
[48:28] jesus this reminds me of the same one
[48:30] brother john and this priest that we are
[48:32] alone but together
[48:35] how many remembers that same one
[48:37] alone but together so that's what we are
[48:40] going to try to drive a line of thought
[48:42] tonight
[48:44] just relax but fasten your seat belts as
[48:47] we go along
[48:48] and relax in the presence of the lord
[48:50] just follow the thought and i've got
[48:52] lots of calls that have put here from
[48:54] the prophet
[48:56] but really this was sitting on my heart
[48:59] and i didn't know how to express it and
[49:01] i said my
[49:02] it means walking
[49:04] it's not just walking
[49:07] you know when we say walking is that we
[49:10] say life is a journey am i right
[49:12] we say life is a journey
[49:15] was teasing someone not my wife
[49:18] i was teasing someone
[49:20] who said hey you know i'm i'm starting
[49:23] a journey for dieting
[49:27] but that's not my wife i'm telling you
[49:29] the truth
[49:31] i wasn't teasing my wife because if i
[49:33] tease her i'm teasing myself
[49:35] so i said oh you're starting a journey
[49:39] which means
[49:40] a journey is not only when you get in
[49:42] your car and drive which means the
[49:44] journey is not when you just walk with
[49:46] your feet
[49:47] life itself is a journey
[49:51] we took a journey from before it turned
[49:54] it from before the creation we we came
[49:56] here and we are still on a journey
[50:00] what are we doing we are walking
[50:02] we
[50:03] are
[50:05] king we jesus you know that's all
[50:09] walking every day all along the way
[50:14] whoa
[50:16] king we did
[50:19] us
[50:20] walking with jesus alone
[50:24] it says sometimes in the sunshine
[50:27] sometimes in the shadows
[50:30] walking every day all along the way
[50:35] that's what the song says
[50:37] so we are working with jesus but alone
[50:40] sometimes in the sunshine
[50:43] sometimes in the shadows
[50:44] now
[50:46] i just want to start off by giving you a
[50:47] short testimony
[50:50] of myself and another brother friend of
[50:52] mine brother wilson down in cape town
[50:55] uh
[50:57] many years ago we were going for a a
[50:59] wedding and a funeral
[51:02] it was like a holiday of a friday coming
[51:05] and then we were traveling the night the
[51:07] first day
[51:08] and a brother who used to work at the
[51:10] airport booked the flies for us
[51:12] and
[51:14] because he was working for south african
[51:16] airways he booked for us but because
[51:18] he's an employee they
[51:20] they don't charge him much
[51:23] but at the same time
[51:24] you you don't get priority even if you
[51:26] booked you sit at the back of the queue
[51:29] you may come in you may not come in you
[51:31] paid cheap isn't it people have paid
[51:34] full price so he booked for us and then
[51:36] we're on our way to johannesburg

[51:40] we were on the line
[51:41] for the flights were overbooked three

[53:07] airport

[53:10] so me and brother wilson we were
[53:12] sitting there and then they gave
[53:14] everybody everything and everyone
[53:17] really so that there's nothing they can
[53:19] do if the flight that is the last one is
[53:22] already overbooked when they say the
[53:24] flight is over booked they mean
[53:26] that even the waiter
[53:28] who do you call them the air hostesses
[53:30] they're going to be squeezed
[53:32] they may share some of the seeds with
[53:34] other people it's full it's overbooked
[53:37] that maybe they don't even tell us that
[53:38] they are sitting at the back standing
[53:41] maybe they don't tell us so me and
[53:43] brother wilson we said ah brother what
[53:44] do we do
[53:46] uh we're going to your house or my house
[53:48] so that we sleep there together tomorrow
[53:50] wake up early in the morning oh we are
[53:51] just chatting about it
[53:53] then we are sitting down and we are
[53:55] talking and we are talking about god
[53:57] and we start to talk about god and
[53:59] something happened that we started to
[54:01] talk about when brother brandon's flight
[54:04] was stopped remember
[54:07] and then the prophet's flight was
[54:08] stopped and uh
[54:11] you know he came out and then the lord
[54:13] did his work how many remembers the
[54:15] story you know the story
[54:17] so
[54:18] and then we started talking about that
[54:20] and we started talking and we were lost
[54:21] in the discussion one discussion led to
[54:23] the other to the other to the other but
[54:25] talking about god and what he has done
[54:27] for us as young men
[54:31] so
[54:32] about
[54:34] maybe
[54:35] 10 minutes before the flight could go
[54:37] you know you're supposed to go in there
[54:39] 15 minutes if i'm not wrong before they
[54:41] close the gate
[54:43] your luggage if you are checking them in
[54:45] they should have long been in
[54:47] right
[54:49] the next thing we are sitting like
[54:50] they're talking putting our feet there
[54:52] on the balcony chatting and chatting we
[54:54] see a lady coming to us running an air
[54:57] hostess type of a reception lady said
[55:00] where are those people to join us there
[55:02] where are those people to join us back i
[55:04] need two two people two
[55:07] ah
[55:08] what is this ladies thing i thought
[55:11] it's overbooked you know we didn't have
[55:12] time to think yeah we just grabbed
[55:14] little suitcases and ran to her and then
[55:17] she just showed us to the gate we ran
[55:19] through we didn't we just went inside
[55:21] the airplane 10 minutes later the
[55:23] aircraft left
[55:25] when we were already in the airplane we
[55:27] still could not believe what happened
[55:29] [Music]
[55:31] so
[55:32] why am i telling you this testimony
[55:34] i'm telling you this testimony because
[55:37] when you create an atmosphere
[55:40] when you talk about god the bible says
[55:43] he come closer
[55:46] he come closer to you so so when you
[55:49] bring him closer he come when you go one
[55:52] step towards him he come two steps
[55:54] towards you
[55:55] that's what he does you know the song
[55:57] that he if you take a step towards him
[56:00] he'll take two towards you
[56:03] ah it says and before you know you'll be
[56:05] running around with a heart full of
[56:08] happiness you know that one so that's
[56:10] what happens so
[56:12] why are the thoughts louder than your
[56:15] voice in heaven
[56:16] because when you talk
[56:18] when you are talking about something it
[56:21] has started somewhere
[56:23] in your thought
[56:24] ah you know they say someone that says
[56:27] faith is uh what does it say
[56:30] uh
[56:31] faith is
[56:32] works expressed
[56:34] who can who is the message
[56:37] what's the same one
[56:39] works is faith expressed but it reminded
[56:42] me of that but what i want to tell you
[56:43] is that
[56:44] a words
[56:45] words are thoughts expressed
[56:48] your ways are the thoughts expressed in
[56:51] other words before god could say let
[56:54] there be
[56:56] he
[56:56] thought and remember god's thoughts are
[56:59] real
[57:00] god's thoughts are not like my thoughts
[57:02] and your thoughts
[57:04] god's thoughts is eternal when he thinks
[57:06] that thought is like real
[57:09] it's more tangible than this thing is
[57:11] alive his thought that is why when he he
[57:14] thought about you
[57:16] and then you became a reality
[57:18] he thought about you and when he spoke
[57:20] you you became into existence that's why
[57:23] god's thoughts are so powerful
[57:25] but you are the bride isn't it
[57:28] you are part of him
[57:30] you are you are taken from his
[57:33] right
[57:34] so
[57:34] if you are part of him that means your
[57:36] thoughts
[57:38] a what
[57:40] they're powerful
[57:42] a believer
[57:43] of the word of god a daughter and a son
[57:46] of god a bride of god
[57:48] stores are powerful
[57:52] so
[57:52] which means that we we me and you must
[57:55] be very careful
[57:58] remember the prophet in the bible who
[58:00] was angry
[58:01] he got so angry
[58:03] the prophet until he called the best
[58:06] the best to kill the children because
[58:08] the weight of
[58:09] god inside a human being is so powerful
[58:12] it's so real it can cause great harm it
[58:15] can cause it can cause life
[58:17] that's why i'm saying to you
[58:20] why are our thoughts so loud in heaven
[58:23] not our ways our voice why
[58:26] because a thought is something that is
[58:28] so powerful a thought creates an
[58:31] atmosphere
[58:34] a thought even before you can say it
[58:37] before it can be expressed by means of a
[58:39] voice or a word it is create an
[58:42] atmosphere let me show you
[58:44] and
[58:46] you know you can just sit down by
[58:48] yourself and think and start to create
[58:50] an atmosphere
[58:52] just through your heart through the
[58:54] force and the thinking of your heart you
[58:56] can sit alone and become miserable
[59:00] and of course an atmosphere of misery
[59:04] that's how powerful a thought is
[59:07] you see now because i can't see there if
[59:09] you don't mind i'm going to read here
[59:12] because i i i
[59:14] i i will request the technicians next
[59:16] time that we must use the big big one
[59:20] no pleasure brothers no pressure
[59:22] we cannot have listen to the prophet we
[59:25] cannot have a healing service here until
[59:28] people get in the spirit of the healing
[59:30] service
[59:32] what is the healing what is the spirit
[59:34] of the healing service people go to a
[59:35] rugby game people go to a cricket game
[59:38] or a soccer game or whatever game you
[59:41] have to get in the spirit of that game
[59:44] otherwise it is not going to take place
[59:46] when you come to church
[59:49] for the service get in the spirit of the
[59:51] service
[59:54] otherwise how is the savings going to
[59:55] take place
[59:57] how is the service going to take place
[59:58] between you and god
[1:00:01] it must get in the spirit it must get in
[1:00:03] the atmosphere i took my car for the
[1:00:06] service today the moment it gets there
[1:00:08] they prep it
[1:00:11] to get it ready for service
[1:00:14] they take the book they check everything
[1:00:17] they check the things that need to be
[1:00:18] fixed
[1:00:19] and they prepare report and they service
[1:00:22] the car you come to the service me and
[1:00:24] you come here we spend time money
[1:00:28] everything that we think is important
[1:00:31] and then we don't want to get in the
[1:00:32] spirit of the healing service
[1:00:34] how is the healing going to take place
[1:00:37] excuse me
[1:00:42] now he says the prophet we cannot have a
[1:00:45] feeling of the holy schools until people
[1:00:47] get in that kind of an in a atmosphere
[1:00:52] we have to
[1:00:53] if we want the holy spirit we have to if
[1:00:55] we want to be refreshed if we want to be
[1:00:58] refilled
[1:00:59] if we want someone to get healed
[1:01:02] let's get in the spirit of what we want
[1:01:08] and the people was in the atmosphere in
[1:01:10] that day to bring a judgment upon the
[1:01:12] earth
[1:01:13] the people who never wanted to listen to
[1:01:16] god
[1:01:18] and they are in the same atmosphere
[1:01:20] today eating drinking marrying giving in
[1:01:23] marriage and all kinds of and all these
[1:01:25] kinds of things like that
[1:01:27] and the glory of god is being preached
[1:01:29] and demonstrated and the power of the
[1:01:32] holy ghost setting forth an example of
[1:01:34] the resurrection of jesus christ coming
[1:01:36] that's coming to take the church into
[1:01:38] glory just as certain as i am standing
[1:01:41] here that's right
[1:01:43] and men are ignoring it
[1:01:47] paying no attention to it walking away
[1:01:50] from it because they are in the spirit
[1:01:52] of the last day
[1:01:54] so which at the atmosphere that me and
[1:01:56] you create is not for those ones
[1:01:59] the ones that me and you must
[1:02:02] strive for or surrender for
[1:02:07] that's the one that is going to take us
[1:02:09] home are we together
[1:02:11] i like that part that i've highlighted
[1:02:13] in black day that we cannot have a
[1:02:17] healing service here
[1:02:19] in sakayana tabernacle
[1:02:21] think about
[1:02:23] uh you don't have a problem okay
[1:02:26] you've got no problem you're just
[1:02:28] praising the lord you're enjoying life
[1:02:30] but you're not in the atmosphere
[1:02:32] do you think people with you in service
[1:02:35] will get healed
[1:02:37] do you think your neighbor your brother
[1:02:39] will receive their need if you are an
[1:02:41] obstacle of creating an atmosphere that
[1:02:44] means individually and
[1:02:46] collectively we have to create an
[1:02:48] atmosphere when we come here we must
[1:02:51] shut
[1:02:53] everything aside
[1:02:54] our thoughts
[1:02:56] our problems our excitement what made me
[1:02:59] happy today
[1:03:02] okay
[1:03:07] our thoughts
[1:03:08] we know that the scripture of jeremiah
[1:03:10] 29
[1:03:12] now
[1:03:14] the great god who makes the heavens and
[1:03:16] the earth
[1:03:17] was talking to the israel the children
[1:03:19] of israel
[1:03:20] and they were in babylon in captivity
[1:03:23] just like you and me are here
[1:03:26] in this little prison
[1:03:28] but the rules and the laws and the
[1:03:29] circumstances of the prison don't
[1:03:31] control us
[1:03:32] why because we create an atmosphere in
[1:03:35] prison remember paul and salas
[1:03:38] they were in prison
[1:03:41] remember
[1:03:43] how many remember that
[1:03:44] the bible says they were bound yeah
[1:03:49] you know
[1:03:50] not bound with a little rope here and
[1:03:52] then tie you there no no no no no they
[1:03:54] bound them with stocks
[1:03:57] you know stocks
[1:03:58] is those little
[1:04:00] wood
[1:04:01] that they put on your feet and they bind
[1:04:04] you also on your hands in prison maybe
[1:04:07] three walls around
[1:04:09] with high top security
[1:04:12] the king's brigade guarding them
[1:04:15] and they still tie them like that
[1:04:17] why is the devil doing that because the
[1:04:19] devil wants to create an atmosphere
[1:04:22] for them
[1:04:23] to know that they are conquered he wants
[1:04:26] to show them psychologically
[1:04:28] psychologically thought
[1:04:30] psychologically it goes with the
[1:04:33] thinking the mind he wants to create and
[1:04:35] when you know when they took nelson
[1:04:37] mandela and them to prison
[1:04:39] when you go to south africa you must
[1:04:40] take a moment and go there i'll take you
[1:04:42] there if i go with you you go to that
[1:04:43] prison called robin island it's an
[1:04:45] island 12 kilometers from the city
[1:04:49] and you find that okay i mean you can
[1:04:52] put these people here in an island they
[1:04:53] will never run away so just build proper
[1:04:55] houses no no it's a prison they build
[1:04:59] prisons and walls and then they still
[1:05:01] put them in big
[1:05:04] steel frames
[1:05:06] individually because you must have the
[1:05:08] thinking and the mentality of being in
[1:05:11] prison
[1:05:12] but them
[1:05:13] they did only one mistake because they
[1:05:15] were fighting for political freedom paul
[1:05:17] and silas were like worse than that
[1:05:20] damn the bible says they started to sing
[1:05:23] the songs and hymns
[1:05:25] louder and louder
[1:05:28] they they realized that to fight an
[1:05:31] atmosphere of the enemy you must bring
[1:05:34] another atmosphere
[1:05:39] if you watch that movie called
[1:05:42] the ten commandments
[1:05:45] oh sorry judah ben aye
[1:05:47] you'll find another card called masala
[1:05:49] he's a shirt bad guy
[1:05:52] a roman guy obviously he's a roman
[1:05:54] because those guys
[1:05:58] they were
[1:05:59] he he said to the people that
[1:06:02] how do you fight an idea
[1:06:05] you fight it with another idea that's
[1:06:07] what he believed so i'm saying to you
[1:06:10] paul and salas realize that the
[1:06:12] atmosphere that the enemy is creating
[1:06:14] around them
[1:06:15] of defeat and being conquered can only
[1:06:18] be destroyed by creating another
[1:06:20] atmosphere and they knew that they they
[1:06:23] had been given the power to create that
[1:06:26] atmosphere
[1:06:27] so they started
[1:06:29] do you think when they started to sing
[1:06:31] they knew what the lord was going to do
[1:06:34] do you think they knew
[1:06:35] and then wait and they were encouraged
[1:06:37] that ah we know now let's see more
[1:06:39] than the prison no no they probably did
[1:06:41] not know
[1:06:42] but it is the atmosphere that they
[1:06:44] created that became so powerful
[1:06:47] that even the stocks that they were
[1:06:49] bound with
[1:06:50] even the prison walls
[1:06:53] they had to obey to that atmosphere
[1:06:56] and that atmosphere tonight
[1:06:58] it is within you
[1:07:01] it is within
[1:07:02] you
[1:07:03] say it is within me
[1:07:06] who was who was preaching and said we
[1:07:08] must stand up the other day was it the
[1:07:09] pastor
[1:07:11] who was it oprah yes
[1:07:13] i like that my brother i like it
[1:07:16] because
[1:07:17] we have to be active in the service of
[1:07:19] the lord
[1:07:20] let's create an atmosphere that will
[1:07:22] give us deliverance
[1:07:24] when we are in church
[1:07:26] let's be so uh so zealous let's be so
[1:07:29] zealous so encouraged because
[1:07:32] here we have come for life and death and
[1:07:36] you know that you have been given life
[1:07:38] already paul and salas knew that they
[1:07:40] are sons of god man that's one thing
[1:07:42] that was very clear one thing that the
[1:07:44] devil must know is that you are the son
[1:07:46] of god that must be very clear
[1:07:49] that's our point of departure
[1:07:51] that's where we move from
[1:07:53] devil
[1:07:55] is it you
[1:07:56] yes
[1:07:57] all right
[1:07:59] let's start now wherever you want to
[1:08:01] start
[1:08:02] i ben bailey i'm a son of god okay
[1:08:05] he says yes say good
[1:08:08] now let's start what do you have today
[1:08:11] what do you have david
[1:08:13] don't ask don't allow him to ask you
[1:08:15] like that you ask him like what do you
[1:08:18] have when things go like this annoys you
[1:08:21] let's start very clear i'm a son of god
[1:08:24] is that very clear to you devil
[1:08:27] it is written i'm a son of god is it
[1:08:28] clear yes he says oh good now bring it
[1:08:31] on
[1:08:33] bring it
[1:08:36] because i've got an atmosphere to
[1:08:37] overpower that don't be scared of the
[1:08:39] day don't be scared of a challenge
[1:08:41] i know it's easier said than done
[1:08:44] that's the one that's why the lord chose
[1:08:46] the foolishness of preaching to
[1:08:48] encourage you
[1:08:50] i don't i never understand why it says
[1:08:51] the foolishness of preaching i need to
[1:08:53] be educated on that but the lord chose
[1:08:56] preaching
[1:08:58] to do what to bring the word of life to
[1:09:00] the people today if i stand on the
[1:09:03] street and preach people will say
[1:09:05] please where does he come from
[1:09:07] huh oh no he comes from this side apart
[1:09:09] he lives somewhere here this guy so
[1:09:12] is he okay
[1:09:14] just by standing and preaching
[1:09:17] when i try to create that atmosphere
[1:09:20] they are bringing a counter one
[1:09:22] so we must never be scared or
[1:09:23] intimidated
[1:09:25] by the enemy
[1:09:28] jeremiah
[1:09:30] he wrote to the children of god
[1:09:32] god spoke to him
[1:09:34] and he said for i know the thoughts that
[1:09:36] i think towards you
[1:09:38] said the lord thought of peace and not
[1:09:41] of evil
[1:09:42] that's how much god thinks about you
[1:09:45] those were the children of israel and
[1:09:47] you are spiritual israel
[1:09:50] today
[1:09:51] you are spiritual israel you have been
[1:09:54] crafted you have been brought in and
[1:09:57] they were put to suffer so that me and
[1:09:59] you can come in and be the bride it's
[1:10:02] you
[1:10:03] you must believe it brother and sister
[1:10:04] you must believe that it is you and
[1:10:07] believe it for real
[1:10:08] that you are the bride of god
[1:10:10] and he chose you
[1:10:12] don't allow the atmosphere that says
[1:10:14] with my weaknesses with this with
[1:10:16] whatever no no it's not about what you
[1:10:18] have done
[1:10:19] it's not about what you may do in the
[1:10:21] future
[1:10:22] you are a son and a daughter of god and
[1:10:25] you have to believe that
[1:10:27] to believe in something it means to do
[1:10:29] it i don't know how i can express it to
[1:10:31] believe it
[1:10:35] amen
[1:10:37] when i believe i've got a family i don't
[1:10:39] i don't have to doubt that my wife loves
[1:10:41] me my children and i've got this and
[1:10:44] that no no i have those things they are
[1:10:46] mine god gave them to me i don't doubt
[1:10:49] if someone comes and say oh man
[1:10:51] your wife does not really no no no no
[1:10:54] who can remove me from there i know they
[1:10:56] are mine brain challenge is yes but i
[1:10:59] know my wife my children my family they
[1:11:02] are mine
[1:11:04] but you can bring challenges it's okay
[1:11:05] but they are
[1:11:07] mine
[1:11:08] are we together so that you need to
[1:11:10] always have a clear demarcation of
[1:11:13] point of departure with the devil
[1:11:16] hallelujah
[1:11:18] he says to them then shall you call upon
[1:11:20] me and you shall go and pray unto me and
[1:11:24] i will here can unto you i will hear you
[1:11:27] audibly and clear when you do what
[1:11:30] when you call upon the name of the lord
[1:11:32] when you pray and you shall seek me
[1:11:36] the lord is not mincing his weight
[1:11:39] not it's not saying you may seek me or
[1:11:41] you will or you you are encouraged to
[1:11:43] seek me no you shall
[1:11:46] if you read the legal books
[1:11:48] and the law and the jurisdiction
[1:11:51] documents they use that word
[1:11:55] shall
[1:11:58] because
[1:11:59] what what do you call it in english how
[1:12:00] many t-shirts are here
[1:12:03] he said
[1:12:04] what do you call it
[1:12:06] huh
[1:12:08] i can't hear you
[1:12:09] it's a will
[1:12:10] it's a will
[1:12:12] yeah
[1:12:14] you know will it gives you
[1:12:16] it gives you like a room you you will
[1:12:19] you will do it
[1:12:21] you may choose not to do it
[1:12:23] you will there's a will yes where
[1:12:25] there's a will that's the way i agree
[1:12:27] but when they say thou shall
[1:12:29] they are not asking you
[1:12:31] they are not giving you an option
[1:12:33] thou shalt love the lord your god with
[1:12:35] all your heart
[1:12:38] that's your commandment
[1:12:40] thou shalt love your enemy
[1:12:43] and give him food
[1:12:46] thou
[1:12:47] shall not take thy brother's wife those
[1:12:50] are commandments they're very clear
[1:12:53] they are not saying you will not
[1:12:55] you know we say to your children you
[1:12:56] will not yes they understand that i will
[1:12:59] not but sometimes i will and then you
[1:13:01] will hit me and all that is because it's
[1:13:03] my is based on my i will if i want to i
[1:13:06] will do it i will but if you say charles
[1:13:09] it's a strong weight
[1:13:12] they lose they use it in the legal
[1:13:13] juggle
[1:13:14] now
[1:13:15] i wanted to read for you about the
[1:13:17] thoughts that god has towards you
[1:13:20] and i wanted to tell you that you are
[1:13:22] spiritual israel and god
[1:13:25] thought
[1:13:26] about you
[1:13:28] and he is confirming to you that he says
[1:13:31] he he got he knows those thoughts
[1:13:37] about you
[1:13:38] now the question is
[1:13:40] do you know the thoughts that you think
[1:13:41] about god yourself
[1:13:45] tonight
[1:13:46] huh
[1:13:47] do i know the thoughts that i think
[1:13:49] about god constantly daily every minute
[1:13:54] do i know the thoughts that i'm thinking
[1:13:56] about my brother or my sister
[1:13:59] what thoughts do i think about my
[1:14:01] brother or my sister
[1:14:03] what are those thoughts because god says
[1:14:05] him he knows the thoughts that he thinks
[1:14:07] towards me
[1:14:10] it's beautiful
[1:14:12] to be thought by god he said to moses
[1:14:14] hey i have now remembered my promise
[1:14:18] my thoughts about my children they're in
[1:14:21] egypt i have now remembered what i say
[1:14:24] it's like god can forget no no god likes
[1:14:27] to express his thoughts
[1:14:31] and you are god's thought
[1:14:33] now
[1:14:34] i'm asking you a question what are your
[1:14:37] thoughts
[1:14:38] you
[1:14:39] about god
[1:14:40] right now
[1:14:42] as we speak
[1:14:43] if you can just pause and just
[1:14:46] jump into your active memory or active
[1:14:49] thought process what are your thoughts
[1:14:51] about god
[1:14:56] okay
[1:14:59] now
[1:15:00] the prophet taught us
[1:15:02] that we are amateur gods
[1:15:06] an amateur
[1:15:09] god a little creator you are
[1:15:13] but
[1:15:14] have you ever seen somebody who don't
[1:15:16] understand who they are
[1:15:19] or what they have
[1:15:21] you feel pity for them man
[1:15:24] you feel pity you don't know what to do
[1:15:26] for them oh my brother thank you so much
[1:15:29] god bless you
[1:15:31] see that brother loves me so much thanks
[1:15:34] for considering me
[1:15:35] don't have to look the bag is for me
[1:15:38] the big screen
[1:15:40] thank you brothers there
[1:15:42] god bless god bless your thoughts
[1:15:44] about me
[1:15:47] now
[1:15:48] and we ought to get ourselves in that
[1:15:51] kind of an atmosphere
[1:15:53] the prophet says
[1:15:55] create
[1:15:56] each
[1:15:57] each one of you is a creator
[1:16:00] but brothers and sisters let's wait here
[1:16:02] do you know what is a creator
[1:16:06] a creator
[1:16:08] the closest human being can get or the
[1:16:11] devil he can get is he calls it
[1:16:13] invention
[1:16:15] not the closest not even closest
[1:16:18] the best he can try
[1:16:20] he calls it innovation
[1:16:23] innovation he just means that he found
[1:16:25] something that he didn't know before but
[1:16:27] he has always been there somewhere
[1:16:29] because the bible says there's nothing
[1:16:30] new
[1:16:32] on the face of this earth that's what
[1:16:34] the bible says so but god is way
[1:16:37] billions and billions of light years
[1:16:39] above that he's a creator
[1:16:41] him he thinks and a thought comes to
[1:16:44] exist
[1:16:46] you see this here can you see this in
[1:16:47] front of me
[1:16:50] he created a
[1:16:53] [Laughter]
[1:16:55] you see and
[1:16:57] the bible says
[1:16:58] everything
[1:17:00] under the sun
[1:17:01] under the water
[1:17:03] in the atmosphere everywhere he created
[1:17:06] them out of his thought out of his
[1:17:08] weight he created that
[1:17:11] now what strikes me the most i pray it
[1:17:13] strikes you he says and you
[1:17:16] do you know that
[1:17:18] do you know
[1:17:21] that you are a creator
[1:17:23] i'm not trying to to bully you i'm just
[1:17:26] trying to show you and help you to
[1:17:28] realize that you are a creator
[1:17:34] no they say we shouldn't say this t
[1:17:37] too hard brother ben
[1:17:38] once i must say once a creator
[1:17:42] creator
[1:17:45] is that right
[1:17:46] now i like it to be
[1:17:48] wrapped in creator
[1:17:53] they say creator
[1:17:55] is god
[1:17:57] now you are that creator
[1:18:00] you
[1:18:02] sitting here
[1:18:03] in 113 george street
[1:18:06] stokes valley
[1:18:07] right now you are a creator
[1:18:11] of what
[1:18:12] of atmospheres
[1:18:15] now
[1:18:16] your your you're on a journey
[1:18:19] as you're on a journey you're creating
[1:18:22] you you either create a good atmosphere
[1:18:24] or a bad one but because you are a son
[1:18:27] and a daughter of god you are almost
[1:18:29] careful and cautious
[1:18:31] to make sure that the atmosphere you
[1:18:33] create
[1:18:35] is the one that your father
[1:18:37] is the one that can heal someone is the
[1:18:40] one that someone can say i want to come
[1:18:42] visit you brother john
[1:18:44] because they felt an atmosphere with you
[1:18:47] they felt healing
[1:18:49] they come and talk to you they are happy
[1:18:51] why
[1:18:54] what they call happiness in the world is
[1:18:56] not happiness
[1:18:59] a true joy of a daughter and the son of
[1:19:02] god you know when i listen to sister
[1:19:04] megan testimony i felt happiness
[1:19:07] i even stopped what i was doing and i
[1:19:09] pray
[1:19:10] i say lord
[1:19:11] what is going on with this system
[1:19:17] god bless you
[1:19:20] and
[1:19:21] each one of you is a creator
[1:19:25] did you know that
[1:19:26] each one of you people that's born again
[1:19:29] is a
[1:19:31] but that's a powerful statement we can
[1:19:33] just dwell on that statement
[1:19:35] how can i be a creator lord
[1:19:38] you have to believe that you are creator
[1:19:40] you are not boasting
[1:19:42] you are not making it up
[1:19:44] you must believe that god has taken you
[1:19:47] a humble person
[1:19:49] a person who may be
[1:19:51] already
[1:19:53] written off
[1:19:56] that you are a creator
[1:20:00] because you create atmospheres
[1:20:02] atmospheres that are so powerful that
[1:20:05] the the
[1:20:06] the binding of the devil when you think
[1:20:08] that he caught you
[1:20:10] they fall
[1:20:12] just because of the atmosphere that you
[1:20:13] create create an atmosphere for your
[1:20:16] problem
[1:20:17] don't allow it create an admin don't
[1:20:19] focus on the problem
[1:20:21] the issue is to focus on the wrong thing
[1:20:24] no no focus on the creation of the
[1:20:26] atmosphere
[1:20:29] it's even more powerful when we get
[1:20:31] together the devil knows that oh they've
[1:20:34] come now
[1:20:36] when they come to church to sing
[1:20:38] i've got a problem with these people
[1:20:42] i've got a problem because when they
[1:20:43] come to fellowship they do it for real
[1:20:46] they do it from their hearts and they
[1:20:48] you know there's one thing that the
[1:20:49] devil will never defeat
[1:20:51] is the reality of what you do genuinely
[1:20:54] because he's trying to fight it but he
[1:20:56] finds that he's just solid rock
[1:20:58] [Music]
[1:20:59] and it's so simple faith and surrender
[1:21:02] of creator of creating the atmosphere
[1:21:04] and he gets so frustrated he just go out
[1:21:07] and call more demons
[1:21:09] and he find that the lord when he went
[1:21:11] there brought more angels because the
[1:21:14] bible says he raised up a standard
[1:21:17] when the enemy goes to bring more demons
[1:21:19] he raised a bay
[1:21:22] that is why you are where you are today
[1:21:25] you are where you are you are not worth
[1:21:27] of no no you are better off
[1:21:30] you are where you are today because god
[1:21:32] wrote the standard
[1:21:34] don't look at what you have not done
[1:21:36] look at what god has done already for
[1:21:38] you
[1:21:39] that's what me and you must look at
[1:21:41] not all what i'm failing to do no no
[1:21:44] what god has already done
[1:21:47] that's what we need to look at
[1:21:49] little creators
[1:21:51] sometimes when i'm at home and and the
[1:21:53] wife is all the people is in out and out
[1:21:56] just going all the time i go in and wife
[1:21:58] standing in there whipping her eyes
[1:22:00] crying and she said bill the children
[1:22:02] has not even eaten who knows the story
[1:22:05] the prophet is trying to talk about
[1:22:06] creating the atmosphere
[1:22:10] now
[1:22:12] there's a problem
[1:22:13] with the downside
[1:22:15] of a believer stored
[1:22:18] because this person is a believer
[1:22:20] he's the son and a daughter of god
[1:22:22] the devil also knows it
[1:22:25] huh so he comes to test you with his
[1:22:28] thoughts
[1:22:29] now if you allow him
[1:22:31] because you're a son and daughter of god
[1:22:33] there's a downside there's a problem
[1:22:36] with the thoughts that you can allow
[1:22:39] simply because you are the son of god
[1:22:41] you may find that some people can say
[1:22:43] things
[1:22:44] they don't happen you say things you
[1:22:46] think things they happen
[1:22:48] be careful what you think what you say
[1:22:51] what you what what the process the
[1:22:53] thoughts that goes through you because
[1:22:55] god said i have the thought of peace for
[1:22:58] you
[1:23:00] what thoughts am i thinking
[1:23:02] if i think negative thoughts if i think
[1:23:04] ungodly thoughts if i allow them it's
[1:23:07] all right the thoughts can come
[1:23:09] because
[1:23:10] uh
[1:23:12] they agreed god and satan
[1:23:15] that the best place to go and fight this
[1:23:17] battle
[1:23:18] must be through the thought process
[1:23:22] ah why
[1:23:23] because a thought is so powerful
[1:23:27] even you the prophet taught you and me
[1:23:30] that our thoughts as we sit here they
[1:23:32] speak louder in heaven
[1:23:35] why our thoughts not our voice when i'm
[1:23:37] shouting so high
[1:23:40] a thought is so powerful it creates an
[1:23:42] atmosphere
[1:23:45] so
[1:23:46] now
[1:23:48] and oh by the way i can see that
[1:23:51] and it is the atmosphere that brings the
[1:23:54] miraculous and wonders and powers of god
[1:23:58] among the people it is the atmosphere
[1:24:01] who can tell me
[1:24:03] anything
[1:24:04] that you can think of that exists here
[1:24:06] on earth
[1:24:08] that
[1:24:10] could have not been influenced by an
[1:24:13] atmosphere
[1:24:16] anything
[1:24:18] and think about the best things what you
[1:24:20] call the best
[1:24:23] you know elon musk
[1:24:24] for him to be where he is today he got
[1:24:26] inspired
[1:24:28] right and there was an atmosphere
[1:24:32] that made him to think and to to do the
[1:24:34] things that he has done
[1:24:36] anyone
[1:24:39] there must be an atmosphere
[1:24:41] for something to come to
[1:24:42] existence right you know that even an
[1:24:46] egg the prophet taught us that you can
[1:24:48] take it and put it under a puppy a
[1:24:51] little pity puppy like what's the puppy
[1:24:54] sister jenny
[1:24:56] huh the small one
[1:24:59] you're one yeah it's not rupen
[1:25:02] oh there's another one
[1:25:05] also more fluffier
[1:25:08] if you take an egg a fertilized egg of a
[1:25:12] chicken and i put it under looping
[1:25:15] and you bind lupine warm
[1:25:18] put a little blanket on the lupine just
[1:25:20] you don't move lupine
[1:25:22] give everything there after 21 days that
[1:25:25] egg will hatch
[1:25:27] why
[1:25:28] because there is an atmosphere that
[1:25:32] suits that egg to hedge
[1:25:35] are we together
[1:25:37] so so an atmosphere is something that is
[1:25:39] so powerful
[1:25:40] but you see an atmosphere
[1:25:44] goes
[1:25:45] an atmosphere
[1:25:46] it does not just a calm
[1:25:50] there's a thought that came
[1:25:52] for an atmosphere to exist there is a
[1:25:55] fertilization there is an egg that is
[1:25:58] there
[1:25:59] right because god is god his atmosphere
[1:26:02] brings things to existence
[1:26:03] my thoughts and your thoughts brings
[1:26:06] things that yeah i can see
[1:26:09] any person can
[1:26:10] strive so hard
[1:26:12] that is why wealthy people when they
[1:26:14] want to do something
[1:26:15] they know that they must create an
[1:26:17] atmosphere
[1:26:18] they go to the stadium even the witches
[1:26:20] they get in their spirit first
[1:26:23] they know it that an atmosphere is so
[1:26:25] power you have to make someone to
[1:26:27] believe something before you can bring
[1:26:29] it to pass otherwise it's going to be
[1:26:31] hopeless
[1:26:34] right let's let's move on so we need to
[1:26:38] be
[1:26:39] and and and here the prophet says and
[1:26:41] when people get to a place they are
[1:26:43] reasoning and wandering and stewing and
[1:26:45] thinking and all tore up and don't know
[1:26:47] where they stand they do stand half of
[1:26:49] them not even scripturally thought how
[1:26:52] can we expect the atmosphere to be right
[1:26:56] that's not much talking to us but it is
[1:26:58] talking to us eh
[1:27:00] let's move on to the next one you you go
[1:27:02] around where there's arguments you get
[1:27:05] into the type of an atmosphere
[1:27:07] yes
[1:27:09] an argument also i thought i said to you
[1:27:11] think about anything
[1:27:13] you drive you must get in the atmosphere
[1:27:16] of driving otherwise you can't drive
[1:27:19] how can you drive
[1:27:23] if the church is something in the church
[1:27:25] someone who is disobedient very ugly
[1:27:28] acting in the church causing troubles
[1:27:30] you will never be able to have a revival
[1:27:33] as long as that that kind of an
[1:27:35] atmosphere is around
[1:27:37] what's the problem
[1:27:38] we have to be very careful
[1:27:40] as believers because
[1:27:43] one person you know aiken do you know a
[1:27:46] man called akem
[1:27:48] the whole family
[1:27:50] even a little baby
[1:27:52] they had to be banned
[1:27:54] because the father made a mistake
[1:27:57] he created a stealing atmosphere
[1:28:01] painted around the family
[1:28:04] and they had to die no you don't want
[1:28:06] your brother and your sister to suffer
[1:28:08] because you don't strive or pray for the
[1:28:11] right atmosphere in your heart in your
[1:28:13] mind in church we don't want that
[1:28:17] i i'm trying not to means my ways on
[1:28:19] that one because this is about people's
[1:28:22] lives we are a fellowship together
[1:28:26] we have to pray that lord not for me
[1:28:29] but for my brother
[1:28:30] for my sister
[1:28:33] for my brother my sister lord help me to
[1:28:36] be faithful help me to create the right
[1:28:39] mental thought process
[1:28:41] in my mind
[1:28:43] help me to be prayerful and be expect
[1:28:45] underexpectation when i go to church
[1:28:47] because that will paint on your children
[1:28:49] that will paint on your brother and
[1:28:51] sister
[1:28:52] a brother will get healed a brother will
[1:28:54] get delivered because you create an
[1:28:56] atmosphere amen
[1:28:59] and the opposite
[1:29:00] is unfortunately the truth
[1:29:03] you see
[1:29:07] let's talk
[1:29:08] about the
[1:29:11] the brothers from emails
[1:29:13] the brothers two emails
[1:29:14] you know
[1:29:15] they were walking
[1:29:17] on a journey to emmaus
[1:29:19] now they were working
[1:29:21] hopeless defeated
[1:29:25] but they were talking about him
[1:29:27] you know the scripture i can't read it
[1:29:28] for the sake of time you know either
[1:29:30] and they were walking and they were
[1:29:32] walking and then as they were walking
[1:29:34] they were still on the outer court i
[1:29:36] like what the pastor said on sunday man
[1:29:39] it excites me
[1:29:40] they were on the outer court they were
[1:29:42] more on the outer court on the flesh
[1:29:46] yeah we have we thought that amen
[1:29:49] that man really i really really believe
[1:29:50] that he's gonna save israel
[1:29:53] and i loved him so much i miss him
[1:29:56] they were on the flesh
[1:29:57] they were on the outer court
[1:29:59] then he came closer to them
[1:30:03] can i tell you he didn't come closer he
[1:30:06] brought them in the inner court
[1:30:09] then they thought he came closer the
[1:30:11] bible says of course i'm not
[1:30:12] interpreting the bible wrong hopefully
[1:30:15] i believe he brought them closer into
[1:30:17] the better medium called the middle one
[1:30:20] he start to talk to them
[1:30:23] ah the bible says decided to talk to
[1:30:25] them and they discuss with them and he
[1:30:27] tells them about the scriptures and
[1:30:29] about moses
[1:30:31] and the prophets he says all you fools
[1:30:34] here
[1:30:36] somewhere
[1:30:37] did you sit here are you full slow to
[1:30:40] her slow of heart to believe
[1:30:43] all that the prophets have spoken he's
[1:30:46] bringing them in a different atmosphere
[1:30:48] he's bringing them in the inner court
[1:30:51] in the inner court where they can start
[1:30:53] to say oh
[1:30:54] oh this is the spirit of the lord you
[1:30:56] know they can start to feel better but
[1:30:58] they're not there yet
[1:31:01] they are not there
[1:31:02] but their hearts are just burning
[1:31:05] what
[1:31:06] who is he
[1:31:07] where does he come from how did he know
[1:31:09] these scriptures is lopez talking to him
[1:31:11] i mean to
[1:31:12] who's the other brother
[1:31:14] lopez and who
[1:31:16] and his friend
[1:31:19] i'll be troll pass brother you'll be his
[1:31:21] friend
[1:31:22] you want to be troopers
[1:31:24] okay clopaz and his friend they were
[1:31:25] talking talking and talking and he come
[1:31:27] close because they were on the flesh he
[1:31:29] come closer
[1:31:30] then this their heart starts to burn
[1:31:34] their heart starts to have a burden
[1:31:36] yeah but he's fight men
[1:31:39] both of them they're not talking they're
[1:31:40] listening but both of them their hearts
[1:31:42] were starting to have their bedding
[1:31:45] and
[1:31:46] the bar until the bible says did not our
[1:31:48] husband later on
[1:31:50] when they were in the inner
[1:31:52] in the holy of holies they asked that
[1:31:54] question
[1:31:55] because when they were moving and
[1:31:57] walking when he talked to them and
[1:31:59] talked to them they now swim there in
[1:32:01] the inner court in the middle court they
[1:32:02] assume that they are there when he saw
[1:32:04] that they are ready now
[1:32:06] they are about to pass he make receive
[1:32:08] his passing
[1:32:10] he makes as if he's not coming in
[1:32:12] because they were already burning
[1:32:14] they said no man
[1:32:16] where are you going to sleep
[1:32:18] come in with us
[1:32:20] you see
[1:32:21] come in with us let's eat and then we'll
[1:32:23] go
[1:32:24] you see they think they're bringing him
[1:32:26] but he was it was him bringing them in
[1:32:28] the holy of holies
[1:32:31] then he come in the holy off
[1:32:37] and then they sit on the table and they
[1:32:39] start to eat
[1:32:40] wake up
[1:32:41] when they are there starting to eat
[1:32:44] the bible says their eyes were what
[1:32:50] inside the holy of holies
[1:32:53] and the bible says their eyes were open
[1:32:56] now they said ah lord is you amen
[1:33:01] and he said to them peace be unto you
[1:33:02] amen
[1:33:04] when you are there when you are in the
[1:33:05] holy of holies
[1:33:07] peace
[1:33:08] of god
[1:33:10] covers you
[1:33:12] because those are his thoughts
[1:33:14] those are his when you walk with him to
[1:33:16] my ears
[1:33:17] huh you walk there come a point where he
[1:33:20] makes as if he's passing and he he comes
[1:33:23] in with you in the holy of holies when
[1:33:25] you start to see ah it's you lord
[1:33:30] then you are in
[1:33:33] you know
[1:33:34] that is him
[1:33:36] and you know that you are in
[1:33:38] this is him still talking to them at the
[1:33:40] end he just said to them
[1:33:42] peace be with you guys bye-bye
[1:33:45] and he was gone
[1:33:47] because now they are in
[1:33:49] he does not have to tell them about the
[1:33:50] scriptures anymore
[1:33:52] he doesn't have to work with them the
[1:33:53] journey has come to an end you are silt
[1:33:56] now
[1:33:57] amen
[1:33:59] you know when you steal something
[1:34:01] have you ever bought a tin of
[1:34:04] condensed or a thinner it's sealed i
[1:34:07] don't know how they do that
[1:34:08] but both sides and but you have to take
[1:34:10] a tin or penne to open it it's sealed
[1:34:14] sometimes i even used to open it at the
[1:34:16] bottom because i don't know the top and
[1:34:17] bottom which way because it's sealed
[1:34:20] that's you you are filled
[1:34:22] until the day of your life
[1:34:24] hallelujah
[1:34:26] those brothers okay i've already told
[1:34:29] you this right jesus joined them they
[1:34:32] were on flesh level
[1:34:34] talking and all that then he talked with
[1:34:36] them
[1:34:37] spirit level
[1:34:39] he moves in with them
[1:34:42] inside
[1:34:43] then when they were in there then their
[1:34:45] eyes started to open
[1:34:47] because when you are in there even your
[1:34:49] manner does not get rotten it stays
[1:34:51] fresh
[1:34:53] when you are in there you know that hey
[1:34:56] devil i am a wife of god what are you
[1:34:59] talking about nobody tells you you are
[1:35:02] in
[1:35:03] right
[1:35:05] now
[1:35:06] i want to talk about the aspect of
[1:35:08] spending time
[1:35:10] creating this atmosphere
[1:35:12] what you spend your time on
[1:35:16] on this journey
[1:35:17] we agreed that we are working what do
[1:35:20] you spend your time on
[1:35:23] i wish i thought and brought it with me
[1:35:26] was in the christian businessman the
[1:35:28] prophet is telling them about the story
[1:35:29] here and he said what is it
[1:35:31] it's atmosphere men and women should
[1:35:34] live under that atmosphere don't get out
[1:35:37] from under some normal well-existing
[1:35:40] influence but stay under the atmosphere
[1:35:43] of their lord jesus
[1:35:45] every time
[1:35:47] that is why when i started i ask you
[1:35:50] oh i forgot to ask you i wanted to ask
[1:35:52] you
[1:35:54] out of one
[1:35:56] from one to ten
[1:35:58] how much time do you spend thinking
[1:36:00] about god a day
[1:36:03] that's a hard question eh it's an unfair
[1:36:05] question
[1:36:06] but it's actually fair
[1:36:09] i know we are busy let's put our work
[1:36:11] aside okay let's allocate our work three
[1:36:14] or four
[1:36:15] or are we allocating our week nine
[1:36:18] how much time do you and me me
[1:36:22] spend time just meditating
[1:36:25] about god the pastor taught us that hey
[1:36:28] praying is not just only when you go and
[1:36:30] kneel down and you prepare yourself no
[1:36:32] no you can pray as you're talking as
[1:36:34] you're standing there as you're working
[1:36:36] as you're going to work as you are busy
[1:36:38] working
[1:36:40] you are busy working brother ben and you
[1:36:41] hate yourself on the finger the first
[1:36:43] thing that comes to your mind is oh lord
[1:36:45] jesus
[1:36:48] help me because your atmosphere that is
[1:36:51] around you you are thinking everything
[1:36:54] mind whatever you see
[1:36:56] when you want to sin you just think
[1:36:58] about him when you want to think you
[1:37:00] think about him when you're hurt when
[1:37:02] you're angry when you're happy
[1:37:04] him
[1:37:06] huh
[1:37:07] one day we almost sang with my uncle in
[1:37:10] a little beauty
[1:37:12] parky and it was heavy raining we had to
[1:37:15] cross a big river
[1:37:17] we were he said we had to pass
[1:37:19] and that little buggy that we were
[1:37:21] driving in you know we were getting wet
[1:37:23] inside the bike up to here but he's
[1:37:26] going i just hit him what the car was
[1:37:28] going like this i just heard him say oh
[1:37:30] lord jesus save us amen
[1:37:32] who do you want to call
[1:37:35] in times like that what atmosphere do
[1:37:37] you want to create
[1:37:38] there's no time to go by a four by four
[1:37:40] that time
[1:37:42] you are in a little car you're in the
[1:37:44] middle of the river you're wait until
[1:37:45] here and you are dying it can roll
[1:37:48] anytime who are you going to call
[1:37:51] who is that closest on your tongue
[1:37:53] but now that must not only happen when
[1:37:56] we are in prison like pollen salads
[1:37:58] the bible says when we are happy
[1:38:00] when we are sad when we are everything
[1:38:03] he must be on the tips of our time
[1:38:06] right
[1:38:08] help us my father my god
[1:38:10] spending time within that atmosphere
[1:38:12] enoch
[1:38:13] you know about enoch
[1:38:15] the bible says he spent so much time
[1:38:17] with the lord until god just took it to
[1:38:20] him home
[1:38:22] he walked with god until
[1:38:24] god just raptured him
[1:38:27] he says here you know who claimed that
[1:38:29] he worked with god for 500 years
[1:38:32] and had a testimony he pleased god he
[1:38:35] had faith faith that he would see he
[1:38:38] would not see death
[1:38:40] how could god do it there wasn't even a
[1:38:43] jet plane in those days
[1:38:45] to get into off his feet but god
[1:38:47] provided a way
[1:38:49] when you think and walk with god
[1:38:52] god makes a way
[1:38:54] where they see meth not to be away
[1:38:56] he makes a way enoch
[1:38:59] abraham say
[1:39:02] abraham
[1:39:03] until god said hey let's go for a walk
[1:39:05] and he took him for a walk and he said
[1:39:07] what can i hide from him
[1:39:08] because they were in fellowship they
[1:39:10] were working together every day
[1:39:12] why didn't god say okay call saturday
[1:39:14] please
[1:39:15] angelus you can go to sodom i'll find
[1:39:17] you
[1:39:18] go do the work and come back sarah come
[1:39:19] bring her family
[1:39:21] why didn't he say bring bring bring
[1:39:23] bring sarah let's talk i wanna i cannot
[1:39:25] hide anything no this is an individual
[1:39:28] affair
[1:39:33] god called abraham as they were working
[1:39:37] and he told him
[1:39:39] what he's going to do
[1:39:41] what was the purpose for god to do that
[1:39:45] what wha
[1:39:46] why did god because god could have just
[1:39:49] went and banned
[1:39:51] sodom and gomorrah
[1:39:53] but he said himself god this man worked
[1:39:55] with me so much what can i hide from him
[1:39:59] so brother and sister there's nothing
[1:40:02] that god can hide from you
[1:40:04] he reveals everything
[1:40:06] you have every thing
[1:40:10] do you believe it
[1:40:13] let's finish off
[1:40:15] great jehovah now this is brother
[1:40:17] branham praying
[1:40:19] he says
[1:40:21] he said i was one of those who made wins
[1:40:24] to cease no no sorry this now uh i've
[1:40:27] now jumped to this to the point where
[1:40:30] the prophet now
[1:40:31] when he was at the mountain you know the
[1:40:33] story when he was at the mountain and
[1:40:35] there was a storm and there was
[1:40:36] pronouncement of the weather the
[1:40:38] weatherman has said that there's going
[1:40:40] to be a terrible weather the brothers
[1:40:42] were hunting up there remember the story
[1:40:45] and then
[1:40:46] all of a sudden as he was working
[1:40:47] himself down and the snow was falling so
[1:40:49] heavily
[1:40:51] then he just heard his voice he just had
[1:40:53] a voice saying
[1:40:55] go back through that storm
[1:40:59] you see
[1:41:00] because god wanted to walk with him
[1:41:04] this thing called work is very important
[1:41:05] brother and sister
[1:41:07] this thing called working with the lord
[1:41:10] is so important
[1:41:11] that
[1:41:12] we
[1:41:14] cannot afford not to work with him
[1:41:17] daily and working with him it means
[1:41:19] thinking about him it means praying it
[1:41:22] means reading the word it means spending
[1:41:24] time
[1:41:25] to nourish your relationship with god
[1:41:29] how else is it going to happen
[1:41:32] how else
[1:41:34] if you don't send your wife a message
[1:41:36] during the day out of the blue and the
[1:41:38] emoji of love
[1:41:40] she's just gonna say in the evening okay
[1:41:42] i love you
[1:41:43] create an atmosphere
[1:41:46] brother and sister and you aren't
[1:41:47] married when you get married
[1:41:50] create it in the meantime send the lord
[1:41:52] and emoji of love every morning
[1:41:56] send the lord a smile every morning
[1:41:58] and say lord thank you i'm awake
[1:42:01] i want to tell you something my father
[1:42:02] my god my husband i still love you
[1:42:06] thank you for waking me up because why
[1:42:10] sleeping is a natural process
[1:42:12] but waking up is grace
[1:42:15] are we together
[1:42:17] waking up is grace
[1:42:19] sleeping you can just lay your head on
[1:42:21] the pillow you're tired naturally you go
[1:42:23] to sleep too
[1:42:24] how can you say waking up is a natural
[1:42:26] process it's grace because many did not
[1:42:29] wake up
[1:42:30] many did not wake up
[1:42:33] but they slept
[1:42:36] so is grace
[1:42:37] tell him
[1:42:40] instead of sending instead of running to
[1:42:41] facebook
[1:42:43] testing when you wake up first thing
[1:42:46] you think of the word facebook
[1:42:48] why
[1:42:50] first thing when you wake up is that you
[1:42:51] are jesus
[1:42:54] testing when you wake up say my father
[1:42:56] are you there
[1:42:58] send him an emoji
[1:43:00] knee down
[1:43:01] tell him how much you love him how much
[1:43:03] you appreciate him i love so much that
[1:43:06] dream that sister naomi spoke about
[1:43:08] when she was telling me an ending was it
[1:43:10] me and you brother that you know she
[1:43:12] wanted god to show her something
[1:43:14] spending time just thinking about the
[1:43:16] technology and the things of heaven how
[1:43:19] is it going to be i wonder if there's
[1:43:20] going to be lines on lanes on that road
[1:43:23] of gold i wonder what color is going to
[1:43:25] be
[1:43:27] because you like to think about
[1:43:28] technology and the things of the world
[1:43:29] convert it to the heavenly one
[1:43:32] me when i grow up i believe that when
[1:43:34] you get to heaven the first time we're
[1:43:35] going to have coffee
[1:43:37] i believe that because my mother
[1:43:40] she says no i dreamed but i remember her
[1:43:42] telling me when i was small that we're
[1:43:44] going to have a coffee and tea with milk
[1:43:46] you know
[1:43:47] so i grew up as a small little guy
[1:43:49] knowing that when we get to heaven i'm
[1:43:52] sure the saucers are going to be
[1:43:55] you know a tea with a salsa
[1:43:58] you know in the english way with milk
[1:44:00] it's got a certain smell
[1:44:03] so when i was a little boy i had that in
[1:44:05] my image imagination about heaven
[1:44:07] so
[1:44:08] my mother was trying if she told me i
[1:44:10] don't think she told me i think i just
[1:44:12] imagined
[1:44:14] so
[1:44:16] let's create an atmosphere
[1:44:18] spend time with him i know you know this
[1:44:20] but i'm just reiterating the holy spirit
[1:44:23] is just sitting on this point because it
[1:44:25] keeps on happening and happening and he
[1:44:27] sees you
[1:44:30] and he knows that you heard the step the
[1:44:32] preaching
[1:44:34] that when you wake up don't run to your
[1:44:36] phone
[1:44:41] there's actually a study
[1:44:43] that has proven
[1:44:45] that
[1:44:47] you become so ineffective if the last
[1:44:49] thing that you see when before you sleep
[1:44:51] is your phone
[1:44:53] and you are reading on it and you god
[1:44:56] spend time snooze into your sleeping put
[1:44:59] it there on flight mode
[1:45:00] yeah
[1:45:03] because if you're in flat mode the alarm
[1:45:05] will still come
[1:45:06] yes
[1:45:07] kalam will come but put it on flight
[1:45:11] and then you wake up
[1:45:13] when you wake up
[1:45:15] you don't look oh no no how can this be
[1:45:18] your god
[1:45:19] satan's invention not even creation he
[1:45:22] invented this
[1:45:24] he was trying to copy the things that
[1:45:26] happens in our dimension because in his
[1:45:28] dimension he can only think of youtube
[1:45:32] the devil we don't deal with youtube we
[1:45:34] deal with things of seventh dimension we
[1:45:36] go through the world
[1:45:38] we create an atmosphere of loving the
[1:45:40] unlovable
[1:45:42] that's us
[1:45:43] we fight
[1:45:45] hardness and anger with love and care
[1:45:48] how can you ever see such a technology
[1:45:50] it's not a technology is actually to to
[1:45:53] understate it
[1:45:54] it's not technology it's life
[1:45:58] he's trying to make life with the
[1:45:59] technology
[1:46:00] but we are way above that
[1:46:02] sister jenny
[1:46:04] isn't it
[1:46:04] remember when i call your name i don't
[1:46:06] mean you do that
[1:46:07] please
[1:46:10] it's because i love you i just happen to
[1:46:12] to see you and call you right okay mo
[1:46:15] technology of the devil is to undermine
[1:46:18] your
[1:46:19] god-given atmosphere
[1:46:21] is to bring it down
[1:46:23] right so let's not let's put it in his
[1:46:26] place and start to think of our own
[1:46:28] technology
[1:46:29] our own creation our own create a right
[1:46:33] atmosphere you know when you take a
[1:46:34] journey you prepare how can you wake up
[1:46:37] every morning and not prepare for the
[1:46:38] road for the journey of the day
[1:46:41] set up everything ready for the day
[1:46:47] this is god telling brother branham
[1:46:49] and then he tells him he tells him he
[1:46:51] tells him he said speak to those winds
[1:46:54] and the storm
[1:46:56] it will go away
[1:46:58] as they are busy working
[1:47:01] he actually told him don't you want to
[1:47:02] stroll with me somewhere here
[1:47:05] sorry i'm just trying to finish up
[1:47:07] but he told him
[1:47:11] did you see it
[1:47:15] the previous one thank you for the quick
[1:47:17] eyes
[1:47:23] or this one
[1:47:26] no
[1:47:27] that's fine
[1:47:28] but
[1:47:29] this presentation is available
[1:47:32] because i've gone over an hour now he
[1:47:34] said don't you want to stroll with me
[1:47:37] imagine god telling you
[1:47:40] remember brother brandon in closing is
[1:47:43] is a wave shift
[1:47:44] it's a sample it's an example of how you
[1:47:47] and me are going to come up
[1:47:49] you know when you bake cakes in that
[1:47:51] oven and you bring the first pen
[1:47:54] and you say all of them i want them to
[1:47:56] come like this
[1:47:58] golden brown
[1:48:01] sugar salt everything perfect
[1:48:05] and you take them out that's the wave
[1:48:06] sheath
[1:48:08] every one of them is going to come
[1:48:09] through them because they go through the
[1:48:11] same fire the same heat the same pen the
[1:48:14] same tray everything
[1:48:16] so we have to go through what the
[1:48:18] prophet went through
[1:48:19] and now we go through it with happiness
[1:48:23] it's coming
[1:48:25] now brother and sister i want to leave
[1:48:28] it here
[1:48:29] i think from here i'm just talking about
[1:48:31] the prophet
[1:48:32] when he was uh saying the very god of
[1:48:35] creation uh
[1:48:37] in all his hands
[1:48:39] he what he's telling me and he picked me
[1:48:41] and then i picked up my gun i walked off
[1:48:44] my scope started to walk back up
[1:48:48] backward up in the mountain
[1:48:50] where the snow and heavy snow god was
[1:48:52] working with you when god works works
[1:48:54] with you don't worry just give me five
[1:48:56] more minutes please
[1:48:58] and then
[1:48:59] uh i go
[1:49:00] down the hill and something said to me
[1:49:02] why don't you stroll with me
[1:49:05] through this wilderness
[1:49:07] walk with me
[1:49:09] with a question mark god was asking amen
[1:49:13] don't you want to walk with me
[1:49:15] the same way he did with enoch they were
[1:49:18] walking every day
[1:49:20] they were walking with dave david
[1:49:22] until david says you know when i walk
[1:49:26] even if i can walk through the valley of
[1:49:27] shadow and death
[1:49:29] huh he's with me he even keep my foot
[1:49:33] when in the presence of my enemies
[1:49:36] because he walks with you
[1:49:39] i am the sheep
[1:49:40] he i don't come after him
[1:49:43] i mean i don't come before him
[1:49:47] you know their brother ed at home when
[1:49:48] we take goals and sheep
[1:49:50] we follow them
[1:49:53] that's the wrong way of being a shepherd
[1:49:56] a shepherd walks in the front
[1:49:58] and they follow
[1:50:00] that's the real
[1:50:02] history of shepherd
[1:50:04] the lord is my shepherd he called his
[1:50:07] stuff and he walked and he she follows
[1:50:09] him because he must see where's the
[1:50:10] greener pastures
[1:50:12] and i'm going there then they follow
[1:50:14] he's not saying hey come on he's just
[1:50:16] going there they follow him
[1:50:18] but our ones because they are laudician
[1:50:20] goats and cows
[1:50:24] they run there and we used to make what
[1:50:26] you call nope killis what is a nob kiri
[1:50:29] armand
[1:50:32] a stock with that with that with that we
[1:50:34] didn't make a nice stuff to bring them
[1:50:36] nice no and not kill so that when you
[1:50:38] hit it on the horn it must the account
[1:50:41] must do this and know that my shepherd
[1:50:43] says i must not go there
[1:50:44] because it's a audition kettle cow
[1:50:47] it just become wild
[1:50:49] but if it was a real shepherd of the
[1:50:52] seventh damage i mean a real animal
[1:50:54] sheep
[1:50:55] it will follow the shepherd
[1:50:59] see
[1:51:00] so
[1:51:01] that's what god was doing with the
[1:51:03] prophet
[1:51:04] telling him to create an atmosphere to
[1:51:07] tell the storm and he did
[1:51:09] for four days
[1:51:11] the weather changed even the garage man
[1:51:13] the person at the garage the philly
[1:51:15] station was telling him when he went
[1:51:16] there and that's in another spokane
[1:51:18] right now he says i went there to the
[1:51:20] feeding station enter
[1:51:22] the the petrol attendant was asking was
[1:51:24] telling me hey something strange very
[1:51:27] very strange happen he says what he says
[1:51:29] the weather they predicted bad weather
[1:51:32] and everything suddenly changed and the
[1:51:35] brother never told him that no no it was
[1:51:37] me and god
[1:51:39] he didn't tell him he just said yeah
[1:51:42] that's very strange
[1:51:43] that was that's wonderful isn't it a
[1:51:45] beautiful day isn't it
[1:51:46] he said he didn't tell him because
[1:51:49] how do you think that man will believe
[1:51:51] it i mean how do you think it will do to
[1:51:52] that man
[1:51:54] you'll explode him that please man say
[1:51:56] where do you come from
[1:51:58] you see
[1:52:00] for that man to know that we need to be
[1:52:02] an atmosphere
[1:52:03] that will make that man to understand
[1:52:05] that oh he's the prophet of god
[1:52:07] who did this when he was with god in the
[1:52:09] wilderness a few hours ago
[1:52:12] it does not make sense in the carnal
[1:52:14] sense of the way it doesn't there
[1:52:17] brother ben
[1:52:18] he's doing this oh this brother was with
[1:52:20] was with talking to god just outside
[1:52:22] here they were discussing
[1:52:24] things just before he comes in here and
[1:52:26] he stand here and tell us i was just
[1:52:28] talking to the lord wait for weight
[1:52:31] responding and
[1:52:33] you will say brother are you all right
[1:52:35] we won't believe you because we
[1:52:37] underestimate ourselves
[1:52:40] yes it shall come to pass
[1:52:43] that those things will happen
[1:52:45] that said the lord it shall come to pass
[1:52:47] because he says greater things
[1:52:53] and all the other believers paul silas
[1:52:56] peter and all
[1:52:59] you know i know i heard of the man
[1:53:00] called um
[1:53:02] the man who translated the bible into
[1:53:04] english
[1:53:06] tindale ahead of such men
[1:53:09] i feel
[1:53:10] moved
[1:53:12] because those people were our example
[1:53:15] they knew who they were
[1:53:18] by the revelation of the word of god
[1:53:20] until that the command of the king of
[1:53:22] england was not a problem
[1:53:26] he had to move to germany to go and
[1:53:27] translate the bible because he had the
[1:53:29] revelation
[1:53:30] he knew i am given an opportunity to
[1:53:34] give access to eternal life to those who
[1:53:37] need it
[1:53:38] he knew that so when i get there i'm
[1:53:41] going to sit down with tindale
[1:53:44] my brother
[1:53:45] tell me all about this thank you so much
[1:53:48] because you know what indeed they moved
[1:53:50] in from english to to spade in my
[1:53:52] language and i read it
[1:53:54] thank you tinde
[1:53:55] because we used to use king james to
[1:53:57] translate to to african vernaculars
[1:54:01] thank you so much for such people
[1:54:03] i think i'm finished i'm gonna leave it
[1:54:05] here
[1:54:07] i'm gonna leave it here
[1:54:09] i didn't read everything because i'm
[1:54:10] already one hour 60 minutes
