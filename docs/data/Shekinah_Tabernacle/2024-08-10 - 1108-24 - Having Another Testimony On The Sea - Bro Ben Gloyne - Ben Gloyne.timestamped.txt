[5:23] good
[5:26] morning how are you today good
[5:30] that's good I'm very good when we serve
[5:34] the Lord we're always
[5:36] good always good amen it's good to be
[5:39] here let's um let's just stand this
[5:42] morning we are we're going to have a
[5:44] wonderful time of
[5:47] um praise and worship and um receiving
[5:51] of the word of God into our hearts this
[5:54] morning and we're going to leave here
[5:56] changed and renewed and
[5:58] refreshed because we we serve a vibrant
[6:02] Living God that whose intentions for us
[6:05] are very good isn't it nice to know that
[6:09] you know when you can
[6:10] have when you have confidence in
[6:12] somebody when you know that their
[6:13] intention for you was good then you can
[6:15] just relax a bit more because you know
[6:16] that the their their intention for yours
[6:19] God I believe that should be our
[6:21] atmosphere amongst us because we should
[6:23] understand that every person in here
[6:25] your intention towards me is good that's
[6:28] why I never really get hitched up of
[6:30] why you can never do any harm to me cuz
[6:32] I never perceive it the wrong way
[6:34] because I always know I've just I've
[6:35] just perceived it the wrong way because
[6:36] your intention for me is good so I've
[6:38] taken things the wrong
[6:40] way isn't that right hey and and more so
[6:44] with the Lord his intention for us is
[6:46] always good Satan's a sneaky rat you
[6:49] know he you know the sneaky salesman
[6:51] where they always trying to trick you I
[6:53] can't stand those people this whole
[6:56] $4.99 thing you know
[7:00] it's out in the open they're trying to
[7:01] trick us you're trying to trick me
[7:04] almost not going to buy it because
[7:05] you're trying to trick me that it's $4
[7:08] when it's $5 come on man you know it's
[7:11] deceiving and they knowing they they we
[7:14] it's it's knowingly deceitful it's a
[7:16] ploy it's a tactic God doesn't use any
[7:19] of those tactics I'm so glad and he's
[7:21] honest you I'm so glad for truth and I'm
[7:23] so glad for a word in this day that gave
[7:25] us
[7:26] truth you know I was thinking that last
[7:28] night that that brother brandom said
[7:30] look I've got to be honest with you I'm
[7:32] going to tell you the truth you do what
[7:35] you want with it but I'm going to be
[7:36] honest with you he didn't bother telling
[7:38] us something else if the lord gave him
[7:41] something that was the truth he said I'm
[7:42] going to deliver the truth and and what
[7:45] we need is the truth because in this day
[7:47] and age there's so many lies and deceit
[7:50] and the media and all this nonsense it's
[7:52] it's all
[7:53] deceitful and you don't know what to
[7:55] believe anymore you know even what you
[7:57] see you can't believe anymore like the
[7:59] the the video the AI technology videos
[8:02] that are made are just even so-called
[8:05] news articles are not true anymore they
[8:07] it's a fake and it looks absolutely
[8:09] realistic it's hard to know what to
[8:11] believe
[8:12] anymore but I'm so glad that we can we
[8:15] have a truth that amongst all this mess
[8:17] we have a truth of the word of God that
[8:19] we can believe and and be sure this is
[8:21] the truth and the direction I'm going is
[8:23] the truth so that's the god that we come
[8:26] to this morning and to worship the God
[8:28] of all truth amen so let's just pray
[8:30] Lord we thank you Lord that we can come

[20:53] Son
[20:56] amen amen praise the Lord you may have
[20:59] your seats this morning we have two uh
[21:01] specials for you we are going to start
[21:03] off with sister
[21:25] Belinda you have the
[21:33] [Music]
[21:46] yes so this song Here is um called from
[21:48] perfect Faith to perfect love it's about
[21:51] the Book of Ruth and uh brother been
[21:54] mentioned last Sunday something about
[21:56] that and it just I don't know I just
[21:58] love The Book of Ruth it shows who we
[22:00] are and all the promises in his word are
[22:04] ours because of what God has done for us
[22:06] his great Redemption plan and it's just
[22:09] reading this morning where the Prophet
[22:10] talks about that that lady she's about
[22:12] 80 years old and um she was poor and she
[22:16] had nothing and she sold her furniture
[22:18] just to get some food and then someone
[22:21] asked her haven't you got any children
[22:22] she says yeah I got a son he's working
[22:25] over in India he's a businessman he says
[22:27] well how come he doesn't support you and
[22:29] she says well he is he's sending me
[22:31] these nice letters and these lovely
[22:33] pictures and the guy says can I have a
[22:35] look at the pictures so she had them all
[22:37] stacked in her Bible and it was money
[22:39] orders from India she had no idea what
[22:41] they were the prophet says it was
[22:43] $10,000 worth of of money and she just
[22:45] didn't realize so it's the same for us
[22:48] all the promises and the word are there
[22:50] we just have to recognize them and then
[22:52] we can use them
[22:55] [Music]

[27:03] [Music]
[27:10] [Applause]
[27:17] Perfection amen praise the Lord thank
[27:19] you sister Belinda I like the music that
[27:21] comes out of
[27:26] you amen okay so we just going to
[27:30] um do so so this one uh this this song
[27:35] it seems to be that um for the camp we
[27:39] have put the pressure on us to write and
[27:41] perform an original song each
[27:45] Camp yep come up here little Tabo um I
[27:49] want to share something just before we
[27:51] do this song because we're we're going
[27:53] to teach you this we'll play the song as
[27:55] an item and then we'll sing all together
[27:58] after that as like a congregational song
[28:00] and then we call up brother Ben after
[28:01] that
[28:05] um this may be uh a little bit
[28:09] different but um the the song came in a
[28:13] unusual sort of way and that it came
[28:15] reasonably easy for me to sort of pin it
[28:18] together could I have brother um Kubin
[28:21] can you go stand next to uh Vanessa for
[28:23] a second and stand up as well Vanessa so
[28:28] put you on this is I'm just going to put
[28:29] you on the spot for a
[28:32] bit
[28:34] usually
[28:36] songs most of the time
[28:38] I not all the time but most of the time
[28:40] you go through something and then you
[28:41] pin an experience that you've been
[28:44] through that's how that's how I've
[28:46] always done songwriting you way you sort
[28:47] of pin something that you've you go
[28:49] through some trial or some up or down
[28:51] and you sort of capture it in a in a
[28:52] tune and bring it out but the other week
[28:56] I think Ben was preaching something and
[28:58] I was just sitting on the chair over
[28:59] here and and this bit of inspiration
[29:01] came and it was
[29:02] like I don't want to pin something for
[29:05] myself but I want to pin something for
[29:06] somebody else I just want
[29:08] to have get something for somebody else
[29:12] somehow I don't know I just wanted to
[29:13] capture something in some way and I was
[29:17] sitting like this I guess like that and
[29:19] I looked over this way and that's where
[29:21] the the moodley sit over there and it
[29:24] kind of something just went and a little
[29:26] spark went off
[29:28] and
[29:29] and and then I then the song sort of
[29:32] came
[29:34] reasonably easier than what most songs
[29:36] do it sort of just every time I picked
[29:37] up the guitar it would just a more would
[29:39] come and then I'd sit in church another
[29:40] bit would come and it was it wasn't
[29:42] there wasn't any effort so I feel like
[29:44] it was I'm not going to say it is but I
[29:48] kind of feel maybe if something was
[29:49] inspired I don't know what inspiration
[29:51] is but that maybe that was it the reason
[29:53] why I've got them to stand up was
[29:54] because I I don't I I feel like it was
[29:56] maybe given to them
[29:58] to them maybe share with
[30:00] us if I could put it that
[30:02] way so is it was a we bit too
[30:06] Supernatural for my general undertaking
[30:08] of how I do things you know I usually
[30:10] fumble around so
[30:13] so I kind of yeah maybe I'm going under
[30:16] limb but I just feel like there was
[30:17] something Supernatural happened and this
[30:18] is this is your song it was it was I
[30:21] feel like it was sort of given to you
[30:23] now we all will partake of it because we
[30:27] like music's like they put it in the
[30:28] public domain we all we all we we all
[30:29] take our little bit of it you know but
[30:31] there's an inspiration behind something
[30:33] and I feel like it was sort of I just
[30:35] managed to capture it and I here is here
[30:37] and pass it over that's kind of was what
[30:40] I so this will always be so take this I
[30:42] think as from the Lord for you and and
[30:44] uh and and and take the words
[30:47] yourself there for you to speak out okay
[30:50] so so this is this is what I wanted to
[30:53] say before we do the song okay so yeah
[30:56] thank you uh let's um where's can you
[31:01] come up
[31:07] here
[31:10] okay so we just sing this through once
[31:13] and then we will get you to stand we'll
[31:15] do it after that
[31:29] [Music]

[53:12] seaside towards capernium and it was now
[53:15] dark and Jesus was not come to them and
[53:17] the Sea arose by the reason of a great
[53:19] wind that blew so when they had rode
[53:22] about 5 and 20 or 30 furlongs they saw
[53:25] Jesus walking on the and drawing nigh
[53:27] unto the ship and they were afraid but
[53:30] he saith unto them it is I Be not Afraid
[53:33] then they willingly received him into
[53:35] the ship and immediately the ship was at
[53:37] the land where they went hallelujah amen
[53:41] let's let's pray together this morning
[53:44] thank you Lord amen let's pray you know
[53:46] the spirit of the Lord comes when We

[54:07] that we just sung dear God thank you
[54:09] Father it's more than words in a nice
[54:11] tune it's reality to us Lord we know who
[54:13] we are because you've shown us who we
[54:15] are in you father we know where we stand
[54:18] because you've revealed that to us
[54:19] father you've shown us where we stand
[54:21] Lord undefiled sinless perfect under
[54:23] your blood father and we know that the
[54:25] word of the Lord is in our hands father

[54:29] father so now dear God as we approach

[55:00] glory and praise Lord in Jesus Christ's
[55:03] name amen amen God bless you friends you
[55:05] can have your seats this morning so um I
[55:08] don't know if I have much today but
[55:10] we'll just start and stop and you know
[55:11] but we I want to speak about having
[55:13] another testimony on the sea yeah
[55:15] brother bar preached a sermon called the
[55:16] testimony on the sea he preached a few
[55:18] others saying it is I be not afraid but
[55:21] he says in one place we need another
[55:22] testimony on the sea I think it's very
[55:25] important that we can can step back into
[55:27] the scripture and we can because you
[55:28] know the the uh the Journey of the
[55:30] Apostles the Journey of the Believers is
[55:32] our journey amen it was it was it was uh
[55:35] revealing our journey with the Lord and
[55:36] now you know must have been quite a must
[55:38] have been quite a uh a day you know
[55:42] we're just going to step back into that
[55:43] boat cuz it's your boat that's right
[55:45] it's your boat we're going to step into
[55:47] that boat it must have been quiet a day
[55:48] you know they the sun had begin to set
[55:50] and you know the uh incredible things
[55:52] that happened is you know they were they
[55:54] were no doubt they turning the boat
[55:55] round they getting get ready to travel
[55:57] and you know Jesus actually con strain
[55:59] them go across the other side I need to
[56:01] go up to the mountain to pray so we got
[56:02] to remember in this journey God sent us
[56:05] right and God is sending us to a
[56:07] destination that we're going to get to
[56:09] and remember this boat that we're in is
[56:11] not traveling to the other side of the
[56:12] Sea of Galilee this ship is going to
[56:15] glory amen right so so so where this
[56:18] this boat you're in I trust you're in it
[56:20] today is is actually going to transcend
[56:22] Dimensions going to go from this world
[56:24] to the next World now must have been
[56:26] incredible as I saying an incredible day
[56:28] you know they had seen the master their
[56:29] lord Jesus our lord Jesus do incredible
[56:32] things he would he would uh he would
[56:34] take a boy's lunch it says that he took
[56:36] a lad's lunch of Loaves and Fishes maybe
[56:39] that boy skipped school that day I don't
[56:41] know maybe he was walking down to school
[56:42] and he's dragging his feet saying man I
[56:44] don't want to go and some of us can
[56:46] relate to that and you know how they
[56:47] don't want to go to school and then and
[56:49] then then maybe heard the noise of a
[56:51] crowd coming from the other side of the
[56:52] hill and you know of course you know
[56:54] things spark our interest so he started
[56:55] following the the people and you know he
[56:57] you know he found himself in a multitude
[56:59] of people and there was a man like he'd
[57:01] never seen before I mean standing there
[57:03] and preaching words he'd never heard
[57:04] before and you know then there was a
[57:06] discussion came up after many sick were
[57:08] healed and God done many things that you
[57:11] know there's now a discussion between
[57:12] the Lord and his disciples we need to
[57:14] feed these people and you know the
[57:16] Disciples of course always looking at
[57:17] Natural Things are saying we don't you
[57:19] know how much money we don't have the
[57:20] money to do it how's it's ever going to
[57:21] be done and but then but then this lad
[57:23] was kind of drawn into the drawn into
[57:26] the um discussion yeah and he just
[57:29] raised up and said I've got my lunch I
[57:31] got my school lunch you know and it's
[57:33] amazing what you can give God what you
[57:35] give God God just multiplies God takes
[57:37] it far greater than you can ever fathom
[57:39] cuz he thought man I could maybe share
[57:41] this with Johnny and Jimmy and whoever
[57:43] there at school but you know he didn't
[57:44] realize God would take that lunch that
[57:46] he placed in the hands of the master and
[57:49] and and the Lord would take the bread
[57:51] and he he he'd break it off and bless it
[57:53] and then the peace would just just
[57:54] appear again he'd break it off break it
[57:56] off and break it off and break it off
[57:58] and he' take the fish and bless it and
[57:59] break it off and it was cooked fish and
[58:01] the Creator himself was creating bread
[58:04] and and and and fish for thousands of
[58:06] people amen so those things were
[58:09] incredible things they' never seen those
[58:11] kind of things been done before and as
[58:14] they would you know they would they
[58:15] would climb into the um you know the
[58:17] fishing boat of course some of the some
[58:19] of the disciples were fishermen they had
[58:22] they had been raised on the sea so they
[58:23] knew how boats worked and they knew how
[58:25] to step and just right not to capsize
[58:27] the thing but others like Matthew and
[58:28] different ones they were like a fish out
[58:30] of water in that boat so maybe they
[58:31] needed help steadying to get into the
[58:33] boat and you know but finally they all
[58:34] sit down and they begin to maybe get the
[58:36] OES out and you know there's nothing
[58:38] quite like you know I've not done much
[58:39] wrong in my life but it's satisfying
[58:41] when it works who's ever rode a boat
[58:44] before right and you get the timing
[58:46] right and it's just and you're going in
[58:47] a straight line and you know it just
[58:49] seems like a nice thing to finally you
[58:51] know get under control and get going and
[58:54] then they get out a certain distance
[58:56] maybe maybe the um you know maybe when
[58:59] you know just by the shoreline there was
[59:00] no wind and you know and then and and
[59:02] then finally they get into the breeze
[59:04] maybe they put the sail up and you know
[59:06] then they start going along and then
[59:09] maybe you know but of course their minds
[59:11] are not on the boat their minds are not
[59:13] on even where they're going their minds
[59:14] are on what they've just experienced
[59:16] behind them and they would have all sat
[59:18] down and they would have begin to speak
[59:20] about testify about what the Lord had
[59:23] just done what they had seen in their
[59:24] day yeah and you know maybe maybe John
[59:27] you know he was the youngest one among
[59:28] them maybe he was just cuz he couldn't
[59:30] help it maybe he just began to speak and
[59:32] he began to testify cuz they were all
[59:33] bubbling over they didn't get in that
[59:36] boat sad they didn't get in that boat
[59:37] disappointed they didn't get in that
[59:39] boat empty they didn't get into that
[59:41] boat unfulfilled no they saw more than
[59:44] they could ever imagine right in front
[59:45] of them they saw you think about maybe
[59:48] John would say Brothers just think about
[59:50] this for a second
[59:51] Brothers God has done nothing for 400
[59:54] years from the prophet Mal
[59:56] up to John there was 400 years of
[59:59] Silence Brethren all our all our fathers
[1:00:02] and our grandfathers and our great
[1:00:04] grandfathers had was a god of history
[1:00:06] and sure we believed them we believed
[1:00:08] our priests we believe that all that
[1:00:10] Moses did and everything and you know
[1:00:12] but but but but think about it Brothers
[1:00:14] just think about it I pray the grippers
[1:00:16] tonight today just think about it just
[1:00:18] think about it 400 years there hasn't
[1:00:20] been a scripture fulfilled there hasn't
[1:00:22] been a move of God anywhere but suddenly
[1:00:26] aren't we the most privileged people in
[1:00:27] all the world I mean we're not living in
[1:00:29] a time of Silence but it's like the B
[1:00:31] we're living in Bible days again I me
[1:00:34] it's like the scriptures just come alive
[1:00:35] and there's been such a rapid
[1:00:37] fulfillment of Prophecy in our lives and
[1:00:39] it's not somewhere across the other side
[1:00:40] of the world somewhere we're living in
[1:00:42] it hallelujah amen so no doubt he said
[1:00:45] just think of it Brethren the god that
[1:00:47] our parents talked about that taught us
[1:00:49] about the God of Moses that that that
[1:00:52] met Moses in the burning bush the god
[1:00:54] that met Joshua the god remember they're
[1:00:57] all from the Holy Land they've seen
[1:01:00] these places they didn't just hear about
[1:01:02] them they lived in those places they
[1:01:04] could have they probably would have had
[1:01:06] uh maybe tourist uh ventures of going
[1:01:08] through the historic journey of Joshua
[1:01:10] or I don't know um um Elijah or Moses
[1:01:13] whatever they could have gone and walked
[1:01:14] his path but just walking a historical
[1:01:17] path is not enough I mean that didn't
[1:01:19] satisfy their Burning uh Jewish Hearts
[1:01:22] amen they needed something real and they
[1:01:24] had something real amen amen so John
[1:01:27] maybe said just think about it Brethren
[1:01:29] the same God that met Moses in the
[1:01:30] burning bush the same God that met
[1:01:32] Joshua the same God that Abraham knew
[1:01:35] the same God that King David sung about
[1:01:38] because he knew him is no longer a
[1:01:39] historical figure to us he's no longer a
[1:01:42] person to debate about he's no longer a
[1:01:45] person to argue about did he do this
[1:01:47] didn't he do this did he do this where
[1:01:49] did he do this no he is alive amen we're
[1:01:52] walking with him he called us he's
[1:01:54] talking to us amen isn't that an
[1:01:57] incredible
[1:01:58] thing Amen to see all of the promises
[1:02:02] the Prophecies of the Messiah amen are
[1:02:04] not just close at hand we're living in
[1:02:06] them hallelujah amen then may maybe
[1:02:09] Andrew begin to speak because you know
[1:02:11] when you begin to speak about these
[1:02:12] things we always go back where he found
[1:02:14] us amen maybe Andrew begin to speak
[1:02:16] after John saying you know I was with
[1:02:18] John the Baptist you know I heard of the
[1:02:21] story of this wild man that just came
[1:02:22] out of the Wilderness eating Locust and
[1:02:24] honey and different things in a camel
[1:02:26] skin never had a bath maybe in his life
[1:02:28] and you know he began to preach the
[1:02:29] kingdom of God is at hand and to repent
[1:02:31] and you know something just drew me to
[1:02:33] his ministry and when I began to hear
[1:02:35] him it wasn't just cuz he looked
[1:02:36] different he spoke different I mean he
[1:02:38] acted different to the clergy he acted
[1:02:40] different to the to the synagogue and
[1:02:42] the priest and you know there's just
[1:02:43] something in his in his voice that
[1:02:45] gripped me yeah Hallelujah and sure the
[1:02:48] critics came along too the scribes and
[1:02:50] Pharisees and he just called them Snakes
[1:02:52] in the Grass and Generation of Vipers
[1:02:53] and there's a bit of tension going on
[1:02:55] but something in me said what he was
[1:02:57] saying was true sure it's contrary to
[1:03:00] popular opinion what everyone else says
[1:03:02] but something in me said this is Isaiah
[1:03:05] 40:3 in fulfillment this is the voice of
[1:03:08] one crying in the wilderness this is the
[1:03:11] Bible amen living
[1:03:14] again and you think about it I was kind
[1:03:16] of skep skeptical at first because my
[1:03:19] parents said don't just jump at anything
[1:03:21] you careful what you accept but it was
[1:03:24] more than an argument that I heard when
[1:03:25] I I when I saw John preaching that day
[1:03:28] it was God it was God fulfilling his
[1:03:30] word through the prophet and then there
[1:03:32] was the moment where he pointed to a man
[1:03:34] that looked like any other man among us
[1:03:36] I mean he said Behold the Lamb of God
[1:03:37] that takes away the sin of the world I
[1:03:39] mean the it was an incredible moment to
[1:03:42] be standing there and say and John was
[1:03:43] preaching for six months but then
[1:03:45] finally he wasn't just preaching about
[1:03:47] the lamb coming he says now he's here
[1:03:49] now he's here upon the earth now he's
[1:03:50] here to fulfill his promises amen and
[1:03:52] then he baptized he baptized him a amen
[1:03:56] and then and then the spirit of God
[1:03:57] descended upon him like a dove amen all
[1:03:59] those things happened it was an
[1:04:00] incredible meeting and then I began to
[1:04:03] follow this Lord
[1:04:04] Jesus hallelujah amen amen it was
[1:04:08] totally different to what we ever
[1:04:10] experienced am me then Andrew would have
[1:04:12] said you know because it's gripped me so
[1:04:15] much I had to go tell someone so I had
[1:04:17] my buddy Simon who we know is Peter you
[1:04:20] know and you know he went to go see
[1:04:23] him and you know they couldn't expl
[1:04:25] explained uh you know even even Peter
[1:04:28] was skeptical but then he began to
[1:04:30] follow the lord Jesus and then what
[1:04:31] really then then Peter no doubt would
[1:04:33] have maybe raised up or maybe just sat
[1:04:35] there because if you're a Boatman you
[1:04:36] know how to handle yourself in a boat
[1:04:37] and he said you know Brethren it was
[1:04:39] about this spot back over there you know
[1:04:41] that favorite fishing spot that I have
[1:04:43] and we always go there normally we catch
[1:04:45] fish you remember Brothers we were there
[1:04:47] all night we tried all the tricks of the
[1:04:49] trade we tried everything we could and
[1:04:52] there was not a single fish anywhere but
[1:04:55] then we heard a familiar Voice
[1:04:58] Hallelujah he said if he CAU anything
[1:05:00] and you know I was just feeling grumpy
[1:05:02] cuz you know me I'm Peter I get a bit
[1:05:03] grumpy sometimes and you know I said we
[1:05:05] haven't caught anything he says cast
[1:05:07] your net on the other side and I begin
[1:05:10] to think at first this man's not a
[1:05:11] fisherman but something of his voice
[1:05:13] carried such an authority am mean that
[1:05:15] when I threw the n on the other side and
[1:05:17] the other brothers who were there James
[1:05:19] and John said yeah we were there there
[1:05:20] was no fish around it's like when we
[1:05:22] threw the net in as soon as the net got
[1:05:24] in it's like fish were literally created
[1:05:26] in the net amen and you know they had
[1:05:28] never they had never had this kind of a
[1:05:31] kind of an experience before but Jesus
[1:05:33] looked at us and they said and and and
[1:05:35] he said I'll make you fishes of men you
[1:05:37] think this is a great thing I'm going to
[1:05:39] take you higher than even what you think
[1:05:41] about
[1:05:42] this amen you know Matthew maybe he
[1:05:45] would rock the boat cuz he's a tax
[1:05:47] collector he doesn't know how to handle
[1:05:48] boats for while he knows how to tax them
[1:05:50] he doesn't know how to sit in them amen
[1:05:52] so Matthew maybe rocks the boat because
[1:05:53] you know testimonies are infectious
[1:05:56] right it creates an atmosphere of Faith
[1:05:58] you know it creates a reality of God
[1:06:00] where what God has done becomes alive
[1:06:02] again to us so these things are
[1:06:03] important am me so Matthew maybe You'
[1:06:05] Rock the Boat he'd stand up and get
[1:06:07] enthused and maybe someone would try hey
[1:06:09] Sit down you're going to capsize the
[1:06:10] boat but he didn't care he was just
[1:06:12] enthused about it and you know he said
[1:06:14] you know I was just doing my day job you
[1:06:16] know I was just collecting taxes no one
[1:06:18] liked me fair enough amen you know no
[1:06:20] one like me many people have spoken to
[1:06:22] me before but their their voice always
[1:06:25] carried a tone of hatred or disdain at
[1:06:28] the very least but then when I heard
[1:06:30] this man speak my name amen it had a
[1:06:34] different ring to it you know what this
[1:06:35] is like right I mean I'm talking about
[1:06:36] the disciples but I trust you've had
[1:06:38] these same kind of experiences when the
[1:06:40] when the voice behind the voice of the
[1:06:42] message speaks to your life amen it
[1:06:46] carries a different ring it carries a
[1:06:47] different tone than any other voice
[1:06:49] you'd ever hear in your entire life am
[1:06:52] mean because we are not caught up with
[1:06:54] the prophet we caught up with the
[1:06:56] message that the prophet brought cuz we
[1:06:58] know the message is Jesus Christ
[1:06:59] revealed amen so that's why I say when
[1:07:01] you hear that voice behind the voice
[1:07:03] amen and he speaks to you as the same as
[1:07:06] um as as when Matthew was spoken to and
[1:07:09] Jesus called him by name and that voice
[1:07:12] was very different to him Philip would
[1:07:15] have piped up at the stage saying you
[1:07:17] know he he came looking for me the
[1:07:19] scripture says he came looking for
[1:07:20] Phillip he came looking for me I wasn't
[1:07:23] looking for him but he was looking for
[1:07:24] me and and he just said come and follow
[1:07:26] me and something in me just said I'm
[1:07:29] going to follow him he said he found me
[1:07:31] to call me amen and he didn't just call
[1:07:34] me but he called me to follow him and
[1:07:37] immediately after that I went to find my
[1:07:39] friend Nathaniel you know God's been
[1:07:41] searching for you God's been searching
[1:07:43] for you you may have been raised up in a
[1:07:45] message Church God's still searching for
[1:07:47] you if he hasn't found you yet he's here
[1:07:50] to find you I mean he's here to get your
[1:07:52] attention get your life transform you
[1:07:54] change you by the power of his blood
[1:07:56] amen so so Philip said yes as soon as as
[1:07:59] soon as the master called
[1:08:01] me I went to find my friend Nathaniel
[1:08:03] Nathaniel would have then piped up and
[1:08:05] said I was even more skeptical I you
[1:08:08] know because because Philip acted
[1:08:10] different this time yeah we had had
[1:08:12] Bible discussions before but this was a
[1:08:14] different he was he was bouncing on his
[1:08:15] toes he was like almost agitated with me
[1:08:18] come and see a man come and see him come
[1:08:21] and see him he didn't sit down like he
[1:08:22] normally did and open the scroll they
[1:08:24] said come on we're going for a walk and
[1:08:27] I got a bit annoyed at him actually cuz
[1:08:28] he's trying to push me out the door and
[1:08:29] he's all excited and you know then I
[1:08:31] then I begin to question Philip about uh
[1:08:34] you know this man and Nathaniel would
[1:08:37] have said I got even more skeptical when
[1:08:39] when Philip said he came out of Nazareth
[1:08:41] because he said can anything come out of
[1:08:43] Nazareth good you know cuz it was such a
[1:08:46] low down place but then when I came into
[1:08:49] the presence of this man he was more
[1:08:52] than a man he looked at me and said
[1:08:54] behold an Israelite without guile and
[1:08:57] then and then Nathaniel you know this
[1:08:58] this really took me back a bit and I
[1:09:00] thought how do you know me L Rabbi he
[1:09:02] says before Philip called thee when you
[1:09:04] were under the Fig Tree I saw you
[1:09:08] hallelujah amen this changed his life
[1:09:10] now what about you and I I was sitting
[1:09:12] under a tree once it wasn't a fig tree
[1:09:16] amen it was a tree of darkness and death
[1:09:18] amen but Jesus came and called me and
[1:09:20] called me out of that hallelujah thank
[1:09:23] you Lord amen now wouldn't you like to
[1:09:25] sit with them there this morning because
[1:09:28] we're in the same boat I mean you hear
[1:09:30] all their testimonies and it moves you
[1:09:32] it blesses you but then there's
[1:09:34] something that you've just got to rise
[1:09:35] up and you've got to you've got to add
[1:09:37] your add your bit cuz you know because
[1:09:40] when Nathaniel said that he came and
[1:09:41] spoke to him and found him you know I
[1:09:44] just couldn't hold my peace any longer
[1:09:45] I'm just I'm putting myself in the boat
[1:09:48] you join me the water's at the boat's
[1:09:50] good okay this Journey's worth it amen
[1:09:52] and you know I'd raise up and I'd say
[1:09:54] you know I wasn't sitting a fig tree I
[1:09:56] sitting in great Darkness just floating
[1:09:58] along with life am mean drunken partyer
[1:10:01] gamer University student just floating
[1:10:04] along in life and I tell the disciples I
[1:10:07] was in Christ Church in New Zealand when
[1:10:10] he found me maybe that scratch their
[1:10:11] heads because this part of the world you
[1:10:14] know in the oldfashioned maps i' say he
[1:10:16] be monsters or something it was just you
[1:10:17] know that time I don't think anyone was
[1:10:18] here even the M people weren here amen
[1:10:20] so they'd say did he physically how did
[1:10:22] he physically get there and I'd say well
[1:10:25] I had the Bible in the message of the
[1:10:26] hour and because God is his word amen
[1:10:29] his word coming to me is exactly the
[1:10:31] same as him physically coming and
[1:10:33] calling me by name am mean the remember
[1:10:35] the Centurion had the same kind of Faith
[1:10:37] because the Centurion called for Jesus
[1:10:39] he had a sick servant and and the
[1:10:41] Centurion you know Jesus um was going to
[1:10:44] come and pray for his servant but the
[1:10:45] Centurion said I'm not worthy you come
[1:10:47] under my roof just speak the word and my
[1:10:50] servant will be well so the Centurion
[1:10:52] have had a revelation God's word
[1:10:55] going to meet the need is exactly the
[1:10:58] same as he himself going laying his
[1:11:00] hands upon the person and them getting
[1:11:02] well amen so that's why I say Jesus came
[1:11:05] he he walked into Christ Church and
[1:11:07] found
[1:11:08] me hallelujah amen he transformed my
[1:11:12] life filled me with the you know filled
[1:11:14] my love with his uh sorry my heart with
[1:11:16] his love he changed me amen from a from
[1:11:19] a child of Darkness to a Child of the
[1:11:21] Light amen his word became personal
[1:11:23] alive to me amen and I and Brothers I've
[1:11:26] seen him fulfill his word I've seen him
[1:11:28] prove himself to be Messiah over and
[1:11:31] over and over again hallelujah amen I've
[1:11:35] seen him I've seen him change lives amen
[1:11:39] you see what you've seen him do you've
[1:11:40] seen him do incredible things now but
[1:11:42] I've seen him do the same things because
[1:11:45] he said in his word that he's the same
[1:11:46] yesterday today and forever so therefore
[1:11:48] he's exactly the same now as he was back
[1:11:51] then amen I've seen him you know I've
[1:11:54] seen him go beyond the land language
[1:11:55] barrier amen I've seen you I've stood I
[1:11:58] know I've Shar these testimonies with
[1:11:59] you but we're having testimony on the
[1:12:01] sea okay we're having testimony on the
[1:12:03] sea okay this is good to have brother
[1:12:05] said we need to have it again so let's
[1:12:06] have it again amen I've seen him I've
[1:12:09] seen him come down you know I was
[1:12:10] praying you my parents were living in
[1:12:11] Papa New Guinea and they said you know
[1:12:13] you know and I had a burden how can I
[1:12:14] share this message with people who don't
[1:12:16] even understand English and I don't
[1:12:18] understand their languages right then
[1:12:19] the Lord came down he said not by power
[1:12:21] or by might but by my spirit sayith the
[1:12:24] Lord amen so the Lord said you just go
[1:12:26] and I'll do the rest just like he said
[1:12:27] to the disciples cross the sea that's
[1:12:29] right right if God sent you he's going
[1:12:31] to look after you amen so I went over

[1:13:13] go study it in the Bible so I printed
[1:13:15] off a tracked off the internet which is

[1:13:30] that track and she said she could
[1:13:31] understand every single word and the
[1:13:33] spirit of God was so strong in her heart
[1:13:34] convicting her this is the truth right
[1:13:37] amen so I've seen that I've seen people
[1:13:39] heal from malaria all kind of different
[1:13:41] things go on Amen I was the last time I
[1:13:43] was there in 2019 you know preaching a
[1:13:46] convention there and I was preaching
[1:13:48] that this message takes us back to a
[1:13:49] true Pentecost of Acts chapter 2 amen
[1:13:51] and while I was preaching those things
[1:13:53] The Interpreter stopped interpreting for
[1:13:55] about four or five minutes cuz everyone
[1:13:56] understood in their own language I

[1:16:17] rocking this boat right now with a test
[1:16:20] you know having a testimony on the sea
[1:16:22] but I don't like to rock boats I don't
[1:16:24] like to offend people but the Lord said

[1:16:29] to trust the voice of God you can trust
[1:16:31] his voice amen you can trust his
[1:16:33] leadership and you know his leadership

[1:17:04] then we had our first prayer meeting you
[1:17:06] know and then we had Tong's
[1:17:08] interpretation there and the Lord said
[1:17:09] if you remain humble amen my word will
[1:17:11] continue to go forth and I will bring my
[1:17:14] people here and they will find rest for
[1:17:15] their souls I remember and then and then
[1:17:18] also remember see that's exciting for me
[1:17:20] I was there a lot of you weren't there
[1:17:22] but most of us were there about was it
[1:17:24] last year or or the year before amen
[1:17:26] when the Lord came and spoke the same
[1:17:28] message to us he called us to remain
[1:17:30] humble because there's people who have
[1:17:31] not found rest amen he says You must
[1:17:34] remain humble I'm calling you to
[1:17:35] humility once again amen because there's
[1:17:38] people that must find rest they must
[1:17:39] receive the true baptism of the Holy
[1:17:41] Ghost and then he said at the end of
[1:17:43] that I have not left hallelujah amen so
[1:17:48] to me Hallelujah I like that last phrase
[1:17:51] I have not left see the devil wants to
[1:17:53] get you to think oh he's left and God
[1:17:55] says I haven't left I'm the same one in
[1:17:57] the beginning as the same one right now
[1:18:00] amen the same one that called us as the
[1:18:02] same God that's
[1:18:04] present hallelujah hallelujah

[1:18:24] minut over here there's this there's the
[1:18:25] house over there where we used to live
[1:18:27] and you know we had the prayer meeting
[1:18:28] and you we were praying and the spirit
[1:18:29] of God fell down and sister Vanessa had
[1:18:31] a breakthrough cuz brother Kim wasn't
[1:18:33] saved yet Hallelujah he was coming to
[1:18:35] lunch and things that's why fellowship's
[1:18:36] important friends praise God you have
[1:18:39] those green leaves of Fellowship you

[1:18:48] then God can begin to work right I mean
[1:18:50] she was coming to lunches after church
[1:18:52] and different things but he wasn't saved
[1:18:53] yet then she had that bre through then
[1:18:55] she went home and brother kabin said
[1:18:57] you're not going to church on Sunday I'm
[1:18:58] going to pick the church to go to and so
[1:19:00] she calls me up and says yo what must I
[1:19:02] do you got the Holy Ghost now just just
[1:19:04] go with your husband be a light and then
[1:19:07] what about a month later I think brother
[1:19:09] kabin says we're going to church now
[1:19:10] they get in the car sister Vanessa is PL
[1:19:12] praying in her heart Lord where are we
[1:19:13] going comes to church hasn't left
[1:19:18] Hallelujah then he had his moment
[1:19:20] amen hallelujah our god is a redeemer
[1:19:25] hallelujah amen maybe we could talk
[1:19:27] about you know remember that you that
[1:19:29] church of Parkside Road there was holes
[1:19:30] in the ceiling it was like some some
[1:19:33] dump you know but God lived you know we
[1:19:36] don't go by the outside it's nice to
[1:19:38] have nice inside sure but you know we
[1:19:39] don't go by the church building we go by
[1:19:42] the quality of the spirit amen the
[1:19:44] quality of the word living amen so you
[1:19:46] know we were there and you know it was
[1:19:47] it was the one service or the first
[1:19:49] service where I think brother Isaac had
[1:19:51] you know they had already start church I
[1:19:53] get this text from Brother saying oh
[1:19:55] we're moving down praise God hallelujah
[1:19:59] God knew we needed you here we need you
[1:20:01] here amen I believe that amen you know
[1:20:03] so God was bringing people and then
[1:20:06] there was a one one Sunday where I think
[1:20:08] Isaac or Andy weren't at church as me
[1:20:10] and brother kin and I had this lung
[1:20:12] infection and I was on the strong
[1:20:14] antibiotics and it was for some reason
[1:20:16] decided to attack my right knee I
[1:20:17] couldn't bend my knee and and then the
[1:20:19] no de decided to come to church that day
[1:20:23] Glory Hallelujah
[1:20:25] amen if only I could take you back to
[1:20:27] those moments you think man what is
[1:20:29] attractive here I say God's attractive
[1:20:31] am the word of God calls the elect of
[1:20:33] God it may look like a total mess or
[1:20:37] whatever on the outside it's the polar
[1:20:39] opposite to maybe what the world calls
[1:20:42] to be a successful church but if the
[1:20:44] word of God is there he will gather his
[1:20:47] elect to him that's why we're here
[1:20:49] friends hallelujah we're here that the
[1:20:51] elect of God will find him amen so
[1:20:54] though so so they came to church and
[1:20:56] they're still
[1:20:57] here hallelujah maybe humanly it doesn't
[1:21:00] make sense but you're still here you're
[1:21:02] still walking with God hallelujah amen
[1:21:05] amen and you know
[1:21:07] maybe my maybe speaking of prayer
[1:21:09] meetings you know we could you know go
[1:21:10] back to remember that prayer meeting we
[1:21:12] had in here and we're all pray well in
[1:21:14] our hearts we're wondering what can we
[1:21:15] do for our young people what can we do
[1:21:17] about our children because we love our
[1:21:18] children we want them to take this word
[1:21:20] and just run yes am me to run and and

[1:21:28] generation must have its own Revival and
[1:21:31] you know we had that prayer meeting here
[1:21:32] and you know there was another tongue's
[1:21:33] interpretation and God would maybe I
[1:21:35] don't have the words quite right but you
[1:21:37] know God would say you know as as as as
[1:21:40] I was lifted up and Moses lifted up the
[1:21:42] brass serpent if you lift me up above
[1:21:44] your children then I am the cure for
[1:21:47] every snake bite amen he is the cure for
[1:21:50] every snake bite we have a b and gillad
[1:21:53] we have that healing virt amen if you
[1:21:55] lift up this word that he lives in your
[1:21:57] life above your children above your
[1:21:59] problems above your situation that
[1:22:01] doesn't matter what the bites of the
[1:22:02] enemy have come against you or against
[1:22:04] your family he is the healing power he
[1:22:07] is the Redeemer he is the restorer amen
[1:22:10] he's not just some God of maybe no he's
[1:22:12] the god that is you remember that oh my
[1:22:14] I think this boat's going to tip upside
[1:22:16] down
[1:22:17] hallelujah praise the Lord amen amen
[1:22:21] maybe we could maybe we could go back to
[1:22:22] our first Camp you remember our first
[1:22:24] camp
[1:22:25] oh my many people came cuz they want to
[1:22:27] see what are these young people doing in
[1:22:28] Wellington a lot of people just came cuz
[1:22:30] they're curious you remember that camp
[1:22:33] Hallelujah remember that camp we're in
[1:22:34] the chapel about a hundred of us we're
[1:22:35] just amazed that so many people came but
[1:22:38] one thing that really blew my mind God
[1:22:41] came there was such an atmosphere there
[1:22:45] was such an atmosphere at that camp it
[1:22:46] was electric it was like if it was gas
[1:22:48] you L A match the whole thing would have
[1:22:49] gone Kaboom it was so electric amen and
[1:22:53] people in the back of the chapel they
[1:22:54] said they heard angels singing behind
[1:22:57] them we had an angel choir singing
[1:22:59] joining in the worship amen there was a
[1:23:01] time when Christine swapped with someone
[1:23:03] on the piano the piano kept playing
[1:23:05] between them playing we had phenomenal
[1:23:07] things but the greatest thing to me that
[1:23:09] happened at that camp was when people
[1:23:11] came to that camp and they told God
[1:23:13] before that camp God if you don't prove
[1:23:15] this message to be true I'm leaving it
[1:23:18] and God got a hold of their lives and
[1:23:20] they Believers to this day amen then
[1:23:22] then also we could say the stru came
[1:23:24] about that time and brother Aran came to
[1:23:27] camp in the
[1:23:31] slippers
[1:23:33] hallelujah amen you know and then there
[1:23:36] was that service where you know
[1:23:37] everyone's rejoicing the devil tries to
[1:23:39] put a cage on sister Shantel saying this
[1:23:41] is not for you you're not one of these
[1:23:43] and then Arman talks to her and prays
[1:23:46] prays with her and then I come up later
[1:23:48] not knowing what's going on I pray the
[1:23:49] same thing he prays I mean that that
[1:23:52] cage was broken and it's still broken
[1:23:55] cuz there nothing but a
[1:23:57] lie
[1:23:59] hallelujah amen this is a good boat trip
[1:24:02] he hallelujah amen now there's many more
[1:24:05] I can go through but you got to see our
[1:24:07] God is
[1:24:09] able amen our God is able you know
[1:24:12] there's there's countless Camp
[1:24:14] testimonies we could go through cuz
[1:24:15] that's cuz God didn't stop coming at the
[1:24:17] first
[1:24:18] one he just come more as Camp has gone
[1:24:21] along we've seen greater things happen
[1:24:23] since then
[1:24:24] amen so now how about you know we could
[1:24:27] we could talk about the time where um
[1:24:30] you know uh So Christine had the dream
[1:24:32] before Gabriella was born so she's born
[1:24:34] 31st of January I can remember birthday
[1:24:37] around Christmas time Christine had a
[1:24:39] dream that she was born born still born
[1:24:42] and there's real evil presence in the
[1:24:44] room when she woke up and so she told me
[1:24:46] about this and we prayed of course
[1:24:48] against it and then that came to the day
[1:24:49] of delivery we're driving to the
[1:24:51] hospital and of course we always prayers
[1:24:52] we're driving to um you know baby's
[1:24:54] going to be born and and um you know she
[1:24:57] said you know can we pray again because
[1:24:59] so in our minds is still this dream and
[1:25:02] so we prayed against it and then she
[1:25:04] said can I pray again after that and and
[1:25:06] then she prayed and she totally forgot
[1:25:08] about the dream totally forgot about it
[1:25:11] and then um but then I didn't forget
[1:25:14] about it right so then Gabriel comes out
[1:25:17] was caught in the birth canal and all
[1:25:18] that you came out blue and lifeless push
[1:25:21] you know they pushed the emergency
[1:25:22] button and every doctor and and nurse
[1:25:24] and everything in the hospital was in
[1:25:26] the room and I literally saw them take
[1:25:28] her lifeless blue body put it on the
[1:25:30] examination uh table thing and then she
[1:25:33] started breathing and just watched pink
[1:25:34] spread through her
[1:25:35] body Hallelujah now I would stand up and
[1:25:39] testify about that because at that time
[1:25:40] the stugs were going through something
[1:25:41] with lamb he had these skin lesions
[1:25:43] which were coming out and nothing the
[1:25:45] doctors could do would could could stop
[1:25:47] it and I said when I heard that dream I
[1:25:50] refused it in the name of the Lord amen
[1:25:52] and then so they took courage from that
[1:25:54] and they said well we're going to refuse
[1:25:55] this sickness amen and they prayed
[1:25:57] against it and it left hallelujah amen
[1:25:59] that's why there's power in testimony
[1:26:01] than you Lord hallelujah and there's you
[1:26:03] know there is countless
[1:26:05] things that we could that you know maybe
[1:26:09] we'll just go aran's appearance you know
[1:26:13] remember that Aran called called God on
[1:26:16] a conference on a Saturday night after
[1:26:18] having a big argument with brother kuus
[1:26:19] I hope he doesn't mind me saying this
[1:26:22] they had a big argument because brother
[1:26:23] kuus knows the Bible he can remember you
[1:26:25] know unconverted people can Jewel with
[1:26:27] scripture too but then Arman went
[1:26:30] outside he said Lord I'm out of my depth
[1:26:32] I need your Prophet told me I can call
[1:26:33] you on a conference amen amen and then
[1:26:36] the next morning we were we were still
[1:26:38] downstairs at that time I was preaching
[1:26:40] and I I basically it's as if I was
[1:26:42] literally standing there writing down
[1:26:44] their conversation and speaking it back
[1:26:46] to them Hallelujah in order of
[1:26:48] everything thank you Lord we know that
[1:26:50] happens more than we realize amen amen i
[1:26:53] r with joke oh you've bugged our house
[1:26:55] and then he began to get paranoid
[1:26:56] thinking maybe I
[1:26:59] did the word of God is still a discerner
[1:27:01] of the thoughts and tense of the heart
[1:27:04] Amen brother Ram says if a man is fully
[1:27:05] surrendered to the word then the then
[1:27:07] the word of God can still discern
[1:27:09] through that vessel he speaks about in
[1:27:10] Christ of mystery of God revealed amen
[1:27:12] and we know those things happen all see
[1:27:13] he's not left he's not left you call God
[1:27:17] on the scene God will fight your battle
[1:27:19] he'll use the body to do it amen you're
[1:27:22] not in this alone friends we're not not
[1:27:24] rambos by ourselves we're a part of a
[1:27:26] body and God will use that body and we
[1:27:28] remember the night before they flew out

[1:27:45] corus says I'm not getting
[1:27:47] baptized and God had been dealing with
[1:27:49] him through this whole time he'd come
[1:27:51] and speak to me frustrated crying saying
[1:27:53] we God I want God to speak to me I want
[1:27:56] God to and then he get annoyed and speak
[1:27:57] to Aran saying where's this phone that

[1:28:19] I open up the scripture to Romans I
[1:28:21] begin to speak from Romans chapter 6 and
[1:28:23] as I'm reading Romans chapter six I see
[1:28:25] I see a little nearly 2-year-old girl
[1:28:28] walk up Lilia walk up see God uses the
[1:28:30] body you're not too young to be used and
[1:28:33] she begins to walk up now she's been
[1:28:35] walking around a bit and corus is trying
[1:28:37] to get her to come sit on his lap you
[1:28:39] know just to be respectful all these
[1:28:40] things but she comes up and and I don't
[1:28:42] know what she's doing but I see her
[1:28:43] stand there and she's actually looking
[1:28:45] at him and and she points at the Bible
[1:28:47] points up at the Bible that I'm reading
[1:28:49] and looks at him and then walks over
[1:28:51] picks up a little toy mask and gives it
[1:28:53] to him and then he breaks down starts
[1:28:55] crying and he says God just spoke to me
[1:28:58] through this little girl amen God told
[1:29:01] me listen obey my word take off the
[1:29:04] religious mask he got baptized that
[1:29:06] night too he came out of that he came
[1:29:09] out of that bathtub now before that he
[1:29:11] probably never raised his hands in his
[1:29:12] life he came out of that bathtub raised
[1:29:14] his hands praising God he became a new
[1:29:17] man yes
[1:29:19] hallelujah
[1:29:21] hallelujah amen hallelujah oh my this so
[1:29:24] many we could tell the Sea of Galilee is
[1:29:26] only so wide but we'll have eternity to
[1:29:29] speak about all these things maybe we
[1:29:31] should actually have a testimony meeting
[1:29:33] and we just go from one to another
[1:29:35] that'd be really nice I think you know
[1:29:36] maybe we should have that amen maybe we
[1:29:38] could talk about Co time our God's good
[1:29:42] Our God's good all the time he looks
[1:29:46] after us in every circumstance though
[1:29:48] the though the world got lock down the
[1:29:50] word of God ain't bound amen the word of
[1:29:53] God ain't bound can't be bound by any
[1:29:54] system of man or any any plan of man of
[1:29:57] course we followed the rules and all
[1:29:58] those things but you know there was
[1:30:00] times when we would have meetings over
[1:30:02] zoom and it was like we were right here
[1:30:05] God just stepped into every house and it
[1:30:07] was a it was it was wonderful now if you
[1:30:09] didn't have a good co lockdown well I'm
[1:30:11] sorry but I

[1:30:15] to log off and now you're just
[1:30:17] everyone's gone that was hard it was
[1:30:18] like such an Abrupt kind of thing but
[1:30:20] you know we would have times there we
[1:30:22] would we would have meetings and you
[1:30:23] know we you know listen to Brother John
[1:30:25] Andy preach the Youth Without Borders
[1:30:26] and he'd say the angel of the Lord wants
[1:30:28] to visit your house you can invite him
[1:30:30] you can't go to church but he can come
[1:30:32] to you amen God would come down and his
[1:30:34] anointing would fall in the house and we
[1:30:36] would we would you know um have times of
[1:30:38] prayer after we'd have meetings and you
[1:30:40] know there was one time we were praying
[1:30:41] and you the spirit of God came down we
[1:30:43] had tongu interpretation in the house
[1:30:44] and you know I was speak speaking to my
[1:30:46] daughter here Analise and God said I
[1:30:49] know what you think about when you lay
[1:30:50] your head upon the pillow at night I am
[1:30:53] calling you
[1:30:54] cuz she was wrestling at that time is
[1:30:56] God calling me or is just because it's
[1:30:58] church and people talk about baptism and
[1:31:00] all these things that's why I should get
[1:31:02] baptized or is God calling me so God
[1:31:04] came down in his infinite mercy and said
[1:31:06] I'm calling you amen amen it's not man I
[1:31:09] know what you think about see God knows
[1:31:10] what you think about at night wonder he
[1:31:13] knows what you M over he will
[1:31:17] answer if he can answer how old were you
[1:31:19] back then nine nine if he can answer a
[1:31:24] 9-year-old girl can he answer anyone
[1:31:26] else amen can he use the body to answer
[1:31:29] our questions our deep-seated worries
[1:31:32] and fears and all these things can't God
[1:31:34] do that and then we had the baptisms
[1:31:36] there and you know during those times
[1:31:38] and it was
[1:31:39] incredible wasn't it
[1:31:43] hallelujah amen we
[1:31:45] could you know and then of course I
[1:31:48] would definitely testify that every
[1:31:50] visiting Minister that's come to this
[1:31:52] place has said you are such a wonderful
[1:31:54] group of people and it's such a
[1:31:56] privilege to stand here and preach to
[1:31:58] you that's that's what they tell me
[1:32:00] there's such a liberty the fellowship is
[1:32:02] great there's such a love and a warmth
[1:32:04] there's not not just ministers that tell
[1:32:06] me this everyone tells me this that
[1:32:07] visit they are so captivated and Blown
[1:32:10] Away by the love the hospitality the
[1:32:12] openness the warmth and we just think
[1:32:15] this is
[1:32:16] normal well praise God it should be
[1:32:19] normal but we should never take it for
[1:32:22] granted right and then we could maybe
[1:32:24] we' come down the line to brother Colin
[1:32:27] hallelujah amen a week before Camp he
[1:32:29] starts talk where's oh fish is away but
[1:32:31] you he's talking to fish at work and you
[1:32:32] know he begins to testify to him not
[1:32:35] much brother Colin comes to the
[1:32:36] Wednesday service Wednesday night
[1:32:37] service before Camp right and then we
[1:32:40] have discussion out here about you and
[1:32:42] he's already listening to brother Braham
[1:32:44] how long were you a Christian for how
[1:32:45] long you've been a Christian
[1:32:48] for 30 plus years Who is younger than 30
[1:32:51] plus years here
[1:32:55] so he's been a Believer I can't put my
[1:32:56] hand up anymore not that I've hit 40 yet
[1:32:59] but I'm near there yeah but you see he's
[1:33:03] been a Believer longer than most of us
[1:33:05] have been
[1:33:06] alive right but the scripture didn't tie
[1:33:09] together hey this is all isolated
[1:33:13] scriptures then he started listening to
[1:33:15] the message he came to Camp he came to
[1:33:18] Camp he said I'm only coming for one
[1:33:19] night I thought you're right we'll see
[1:33:21] you the whole time I said it's fine you
[1:33:24] the bed's there for your wife all those
[1:33:25] things he was there the whole time he
[1:33:27] said his testimony and and I know he's
[1:33:29] told you this he said he said the
[1:33:30] meetings were great but it was The
[1:33:32] Fellowship between and the testimonies
[1:33:34] and the life he saw hallelujah
[1:33:37] hallelujah next week he still I mean he
[1:33:39] came back and he said this is my
[1:33:42] church got baptized Christmas Eve glory
[1:33:45] to God
[1:33:47] hallelujah amen
[1:33:50] hallelujah our god saves our God really
[1:33:54] saves am mean he really does set the
[1:33:56] captive free amen and you know how and
[1:33:59] then how how many more could I share we
[1:34:02] could go on for days praise God right
[1:34:05] but the reason I do this is because it's
[1:34:07] like the disciples cuz we're in the boat
[1:34:09] right but then as we're testifying and
[1:34:11] having a jubilee time on the boat
[1:34:12] talking about our lord Jesus done the
[1:34:15] sun was going down and then finally it
[1:34:18] begin to get dark and it's when the
[1:34:20] world life gets a bit dark then the
[1:34:23] devil begins to spew his poison breath
[1:34:25] upon the ocean he begins to bring his
[1:34:28] trouble because we are living in a time
[1:34:31] of strife and trouble like there's never
[1:34:33] been it'll only be worse in the Great
[1:34:35] Tribulation but we but the world is ramp
[1:34:37] it's getting worse and worse and worse
[1:34:40] right so now here we are we're on our
[1:34:41] journey remember Jesus sent us you got
[1:34:43] to remember this the god that called you
[1:34:45] will see you through right I just want
[1:34:48] to labor this point because it's very
[1:34:49] important because many people they get
[1:34:51] upset well if God's really with me
[1:34:52] trouble will never come no trouble will
[1:34:55] come in this world we we shall have
[1:34:57] tribulation Jesus said but be of good
[1:34:59] cheer I have overcome the world right
[1:35:01] just because there trouble doesn't mean
[1:35:03] we quit as I said in the beginning a
[1:35:05] quitter never wins but a winner never
[1:35:07] quits see it's not him that gets knocked
[1:35:09] down it's him that gets back up that's
[1:35:10] right amen you may get knocked down
[1:35:12] blindsided all kinds of things but just
[1:35:14] get back up say Lord I'm here I want to
[1:35:16] walk with you I want to serve you amen
[1:35:19] hallelujah because we're not here to
[1:35:20] quit we're here to win amen amen so this
[1:35:23] God that God that called them was a God
[1:35:25] that sent them and the god that sent
[1:35:27] them was going to see them through so he
[1:35:29] sent them over the sea he constrained
[1:35:31] them to go across the Bible says in
[1:35:32] Matthew 14 and then so while this time
[1:35:35] is going on the devil the devil popped
[1:35:38] his filthy head out of hell and he
[1:35:40] looked at that boat rocking along on the
[1:35:42] Sea of Galilee at this time it wasn't
[1:35:45] because of storms it was because of a
[1:35:46] jubilee going on but you see they they
[1:35:49] were on there and and he said finally
[1:35:51] I'm going to get even with them I'm I'm
[1:35:53] going to deal with these disciples I'm
[1:35:55] going to silence the power of their
[1:35:57] testimony that they're going to go on a
[1:35:59] journey now and they ain't going to be
[1:36:00] testifying of the goodness of God
[1:36:02] anymore see the devil ain't playing
[1:36:05] games he's not playing a game of tag
[1:36:07] he's not playing a game he's here to
[1:36:08] destroy Rob kill and destroy that's what
[1:36:11] he's had to do and he's very intentional
[1:36:13] in how he does it amen so so he begin to
[1:36:16] blow his poison his poison over the you
[1:36:20] poison breath over that sea he raised up
[1:36:22] brother said the devil looked over and
[1:36:24] said uhuh they've gone off on a tantrum
[1:36:26] they're just there jumping and up and
[1:36:27] down shouting having a big time you know
[1:36:30] what right now is my time I'll to sink
[1:36:32] them I'll get even with them now so he
[1:36:36] raised up over the hill and began to
[1:36:37] blow his poison breath over there upon
[1:36:40] that Sea of Galilee and then the wind
[1:36:43] begin to blow the waves begin to LEAP I
[1:36:45] mean the boat begin to rock and not
[1:36:47] because of not because of them having a
[1:36:49] jubilee but because now the the
[1:36:51] conditions of their Journey had changed
[1:36:54] it wasn't the beautiful sunset anymore
[1:36:56] on a calm sea now it was darkness and
[1:36:58] trouble had been stirred up because the
[1:37:00] devil was blowing his Winds of strife
[1:37:02] and trouble upon the sea and he began to
[1:37:05] blow things like the days of Miracles as
[1:37:07] passed now in order for something to
[1:37:10] pass it's all it was there right we
[1:37:12] could say that summer has passed right
[1:37:15] because we're no longer in summer
[1:37:16] anymore and soon we'll say but with a
[1:37:18] lot more happiness winter has passed
[1:37:22] right but it was a season but the season
[1:37:24] changes so now when when the Devil comes
[1:37:27] and Whispers that the days of Miracles
[1:37:29] are passed he's not denying that there
[1:37:31] were day of Miracles oh no he
[1:37:33] acknowledges them because he knows what
[1:37:34] it's like to be beaten and thrashed and
[1:37:36] cast out and dealt with and put in his
[1:37:38] place am mean but he says that season is
[1:37:40] no longer here you see you've advanced
[1:37:42] in your journey a bit it's no longer the
[1:37:44] Youth of the church anymore but you've
[1:37:46] become established you've become mature
[1:37:48] and you you've become set in your ways
[1:37:50] and you've got you know you're older now
[1:37:52] and God don't do those things anymore
[1:37:55] that is the biggest piece of nonsense
[1:37:58] that anyone could ever tell
[1:38:01] you amen for for for the devil to come
[1:38:04] and tell you those things yes there was
[1:38:06] a great Revival in brother bram's day
[1:38:08] but you're living in a That season has
[1:38:10] passed you see we're in a different
[1:38:12] season now we've just got to hold on to
[1:38:14] the boat until until we can get across
[1:38:16] the other side that's the Winds of
[1:38:19] strife and unbelief being blown onto the
[1:38:21] sea amen all that has done is to put
[1:38:25] unbelief in your heart to lower your
[1:38:27] expectations and lower the actually the
[1:38:30] reality that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:38:32] yesterday today and forever all those
[1:38:34] ideas of well God don't do those things
[1:38:37] anymore who
[1:38:39] said I gave you testimonies from a span
[1:38:42] of 17 years well we'll be 17 in in
[1:38:45] September that's how long I've been a
[1:38:47] Christian for 17 years September it's
[1:38:49] been awesome amen hallelujah it's been a
[1:38:53] and and and I could fill in a lot more
[1:38:55] gaps I've jumped a lot of things okay
[1:38:57] those aren't the only things that have
[1:38:58] happened in that span no way you see but
[1:39:01] but I but I I trust I proved a little
[1:39:03] bit to you he's still the Messiah his
[1:39:06] word is still true am mean he's still
[1:39:08] the son of man revealing himself he's
[1:39:10] still that same great Lord Jesus that he
[1:39:13] was in the beginning he's the same one
[1:39:15] today am amen so he'll blow that you
[1:39:18] poison upon us the days of Miracles are
[1:39:19] past God don't do that anymore you know
[1:39:21] he he'll say well you know we don't need
[1:39:23] to focus on the miraculous anymore the
[1:39:26] moving of the spirit and all we need to
[1:39:28] do is refine things that is such a bad
[1:39:33] wind that is such a bad wind because
[1:39:35] brother rown speaks more about the
[1:39:37] quickening power at the end of his
[1:39:39] ministry that he does for most of the
[1:39:41] start of it the Dynamics coming back
[1:39:43] into the church again the Dynamics of
[1:39:45] the moving of the Holy Ghost he he
[1:39:47] speaks more about that at the end of his
[1:39:49] ministry than he does at the beginning
[1:39:52] am mean because he's saying now is the
[1:39:53] rising of the sun amen we you you the
[1:39:56] the s o n has risen Christ himself is
[1:39:59] risen amen he says that the son of man
[1:40:02] Ministry is in a many membered body now
[1:40:04] amen it was revealed in Jesus um
[1:40:06] revealed in brother brown one man
[1:40:07] Ministry but now it's a bride Ministry
[1:40:09] around the world that same son of man
[1:40:11] being revealed made known that same word
[1:40:13] putting on flesh amen so if he speaks
[1:40:15] more about the quickening power at the
[1:40:17] end what is he saying now the quickening
[1:40:20] power is here amen the quickening power
[1:40:22] to m to to take this word and make it
[1:40:25] live amen that that that we don't just
[1:40:27] stand and quote and argue and fuss and
[1:40:29] no the word puts on flesh amen it's no
[1:40:32] longer an argument it's a living word
[1:40:34] amen just like the disciples before
[1:40:36] Jesus ever came it was an argument how's
[1:40:39] the Messiah going to come how's this
[1:40:40] going to happen what about this prophecy
[1:40:42] how do you see this how does rabbi so
[1:40:44] and so see this have you seen this guy's
[1:40:45] YouTube channel Rabbi so and so saying
[1:40:47] about modern events and all these things
[1:40:49] all an argument but then he but then God
[1:40:51] became flesh and improved his word so it
[1:40:55] went from an argument to a reality amen
[1:40:57] and what has this message gone from an
[1:40:59] argument to a reality amen it went from
[1:41:02] an argument in the 70s ' 80s whatever
[1:41:04] more we're living in a different season
[1:41:06] and me we've come back round again Amen
[1:41:09] to a time of Revival and renewal and
[1:41:11] restoration amen it's like hallelujah
[1:41:14] amen it's like when the you know the um
[1:41:16] arm company story you know the armac
[1:41:19] company story right in one of those
[1:41:21] times when brother R tells it the armac
[1:41:24] company boy says to says to the girl
[1:41:26] he's going to marry in a year's time I'm
[1:41:29] going to come back for you so he's
[1:41:31] basically saying when you see the season
[1:41:33] come again I'm coming to get you amen
[1:41:36] amen what happened when brother brah was
[1:41:38] here God ped a spirit out the reality of
[1:41:40] the word the word became manifested
[1:41:43] there was a love there was a Unity there
[1:41:45] was a genuine Oneness with the spirit of
[1:41:47] God right sure there was all the trouble
[1:41:49] and false you know Antichrist Spirits
[1:41:52] all these things trying to get in but
[1:41:53] the bride was solid amen right and then
[1:41:56] we came down through a it was like Moses
[1:41:58] calling Israel out of Egypt but then
[1:42:00] there was a Wilderness experience it's
[1:42:02] Church splits trouble fussing and
[1:42:04] fighting but we're not in the wilderness
[1:42:06] anymore we've come back to the same
[1:42:08] season when the prophet was here the son
[1:42:11] of man is very much alive Jesus Christ
[1:42:13] is very much alive and he's doing the
[1:42:15] same things he did that you hear on tape
[1:42:18] he's doing the same things today but not
[1:42:20] in a onean Ministry it's a bride body
[1:42:22] around the world Hallelujah so we see
[1:42:26] the season come back
[1:42:28] again what does that mean there's going
[1:42:30] to be a meeting in the air very soon
[1:42:33] hallelujah amen that's why it doesn't
[1:42:35] matter what the critics say I'm ready to
[1:42:37] leave doesn't matter what unbelief says
[1:42:40] I'm ready to leave doesn't matter what
[1:42:42] man's opinion on the website say I'm
[1:42:44] ready to leave amen they turned up too
[1:42:46] late cuz I met the god of the word amen
[1:42:48] the Lord Jesus
[1:42:50] hallelujah amen
[1:42:53] praise God so the season we live in is a
[1:42:56] season of The Miraculous we are living
[1:42:58] in a season of the mechanics and the
[1:43:00] Dynamics running together am mean we
[1:43:02] have the mechanics of the word right we
[1:43:04] have the mechanics of the word we know
[1:43:06] we know the doctrines of the word we
[1:43:08] know Church order all these things we
[1:43:09] have the mechanics right but you need
[1:43:12] the Dynamics and the mechanics to run
[1:43:15] together and when you have those running
[1:43:17] together there's an overcoming Christian
[1:43:19] am mean there's a church that's on fire
[1:43:21] for God and in spite of what but
[1:43:23] anything the devil can do against them
[1:43:25] they will come out packing the victory
[1:43:27] remember because the Bible says no
[1:43:28] weapon formed against them against thee
[1:43:31] shall prosper right so the storm that
[1:43:34] the disciples found themselves in if
[1:43:35] they only went back into Isaiah and said
[1:43:38] Brethren the storm is bad we're bailing
[1:43:41] the boat out all this Winds of strife
[1:43:43] and people maybe maybe the disciples
[1:43:44] talk about other the economic pressure
[1:43:46] and what's Rome doing what's all the
[1:43:48] trouble doing and what's the world doing
[1:43:50] the economy is going to tank and all
[1:43:51] these things going on all these things
[1:43:53] can begin to what tip our boat right
[1:43:56] wind because now these things got to be
[1:43:58] tangible things
[1:44:01] right but
[1:44:03] then but then you see if only they just
[1:44:05] went back into the scripture said
[1:44:07] Brothers Our God told us no weapon
[1:44:10] formed against us shall prosper this
[1:44:12] storm ain't going to prosper it's formed
[1:44:14] we can see it we're in it we're being
[1:44:16] tossed by it it's getting in our eyes
[1:44:18] we're getting wet we're getting we're
[1:44:19] bailing the boat out sure all these
[1:44:21] things but this ain't going to sink us
[1:44:23] we ain't going to be sunk by this

[1:45:16] mean where they stand up and they begin
[1:45:17] to rock the boat testifying of what good
[1:45:20] what what God did the other week and how

[1:45:56] desire that God would live amen amen
[1:45:59] there's the Winds of questions and
[1:46:01] questions on the word that would blow
[1:46:03] across the sea and yeath God said like
[1:46:06] the serpent said to Eve see the devil
[1:46:07] always comes with questions and those

[1:48:16] willingly received him into the boat
[1:48:18] amen it's a true sign you have the
[1:48:20] baptism of the Holy Ghost you willingly
[1:48:21] receive the word into your boat amen
[1:48:24] that is the main sign of it that you can
[1:48:25] welcome and receive the word and if you
[1:48:28] want deity in your midst what does
[1:48:29] brother say welcome and receive the word

[1:48:41] a big problem but here I am Lazarus was
[1:48:43] in a tomb 4 days he received the word
[1:48:46] because Jesus said Lazarus come forth
[1:48:48] and a part of him said here I am and he
[1:48:50] came back to life beautiful wonderful
[1:48:52] now friends think about
[1:48:54] it our great Lord Jesus got in the boat
[1:48:58] Hallelujah this changed their whole
[1:49:01] journey because in the boat was the son
[1:49:05] of David whose reign will never end and
[1:49:08] his Dominion will never end he's now in
[1:49:10] our boat amen he's going to sit on the
[1:49:12] throne in the Millennium and we're going
[1:49:14] to sit on his throne too amen the
[1:49:16] messiah's in the boat who's in your boat
[1:49:19] today who's who just stepped into your
[1:49:21] boat today I believe God's been stepping
[1:49:22] into people's boats today amen amen I
[1:49:24] believe he's been walking over strife
[1:49:25] and trouble and stepping into your boat
[1:49:28] amen who's you know
[1:49:30] the the one who The Giver of rapturing
[1:49:33] faith is in the
[1:49:35] boat amen the one who gives Revival the
[1:49:38] Revival Giver is in the boat now amen
[1:49:41] the one who has dominion over all things
[1:49:44] is in the boat hallelujah amen amen The
[1:49:47] God Who created all things stepped into
[1:49:49] the
[1:49:50] boat amen
[1:49:53] Hallelujah and now they had a different
[1:49:55] kind of
[1:49:56] Revival now they had a different kind of
[1:49:58] Revival because it wasn't just now now
[1:50:01] the sea went calm right but now they
[1:50:05] didn't go calm because a real Revival
[1:50:08] I'm just going to close with this
[1:50:09] thought a real Revival brother R said
[1:50:11] when he stood by Lake Michigan and he
[1:50:13] saw the waves and the wind churning up
[1:50:15] and down he said that Lake's having a
[1:50:18] Revival and all that wind that's blowing
[1:50:20] over the lake he said he said the same
[1:50:21] amount of water that was in the lake
[1:50:23] beforehand is in the same amount that's
[1:50:25] in afterwards but the wind blowing upon
[1:50:27] that Lake caused all the trash and all
[1:50:30] the things of man and all the rubbish
[1:50:32] and all the nonsense and all the stuff
[1:50:34] that hinders it gets it washed up on the
[1:50:37] bank amen for it to stay on the bank
[1:50:39] amen so they begin to have a Revival cuz
[1:50:41] the Revival Giver stepped into their
[1:50:43] boat and they begin to rejoice and all
[1:50:45] their unbelief and doubt and skepticism
[1:50:47] got washed out on the bank Hallelujah
[1:50:49] and that's what we need friends we need
[1:50:51] an oldfashioned
[1:50:53] sky blue sin killing St Paul's Revival
[1:50:55] with the Holy Ghost in it amen that God
[1:50:58] comes down and washes the trash out
[1:51:00] washes the skepticism out washes the
[1:51:02] doubt out washes whatever everyone else
[1:51:04] is doing let it just be washed out of
[1:51:06] you amen and let God take
[1:51:09] over I believe this is where we're
[1:51:12] living the one who gives the the one who
[1:51:15] changes the body of the Bride is in your
[1:51:17] boat amen he say am I going to make the
[1:51:20] Rapture well the Rapture giv is in the
[1:51:21] boat if he's in you he's in your boat I
[1:51:24] mean do I have enough rapturing Faith
[1:51:27] well if he's in you you have rapturing
[1:51:29] faith amen well how am I going to get
[1:51:32] through this problem well the problem
[1:51:33] solver if he's in you is going to get it
[1:51:36] remember he says I've overcome the world
[1:51:39] greater is he that's in you that's he
[1:51:40] that's in the world so greater as the
[1:51:42] one that stepped into the boat that was
[1:51:43] the one in the storm amen hallelujah
[1:51:47] hallelujah praise God I don't know how
[1:51:48] to finish this but I think I think we
[1:51:50] can we can have a we can have a genuine
[1:51:53] Boat Rock and
[1:51:55] Jubilee when you think about what God
[1:51:57] has done hallelujah and he hasn't left
[1:52:01] amen you may be in the storm of your
[1:52:03] life let them step in your boat that's
[1:52:05] just say come into my boat Lord Jesus
[1:52:07] take over Hallelujah do what you want to
[1:52:10] do amen because remember he sent you on
[1:52:12] the sea he knew the storm would come he
[1:52:16] allowed the storm to come cuz he wanted
[1:52:19] but he but why he knows all things right
[1:52:22] but but he knew it would come but he
[1:52:23] wants to step into the problem and prove
[1:52:25] himself Messiah see every every problem
[1:52:29] that comes in life God allows because he
[1:52:31] wants to prove his
[1:52:33] word I'm going through something it's
[1:52:35] another scenario God has ordained to
[1:52:38] allow that he can prove his word but
[1:52:40] what if they did not willingly let him
[1:52:42] come into the
[1:52:43] boat where would they have ended up glug
[1:52:47] glug
[1:52:49] glug we don't want to be in that
[1:52:51] condition yes because many times people
[1:52:54] are afraid of God taking over their
[1:52:56] lives they were afraid of the the one
[1:52:58] who could save them they were afraid of
[1:53:00] right so people become afraid of the
[1:53:01] Holy Ghost cuz they're they're afraid to
[1:53:04] surrender and let him take over oh what
[1:53:07] if he does what if he makes me scream or
[1:53:08] shouting tongues or whatever more he may
[1:53:10] do that he may not but what well but
[1:53:13] that means I have to surrender this
[1:53:14] thing now listen this thing whatever
[1:53:16] that thing is is lead that causes you to
[1:53:19] sink there's nothing the devil can give
[1:53:21] you that's worth holding on to right and
[1:53:24] the PE and the reason people wrestle
[1:53:26] with things is because they want to hold
[1:53:27] on to it something in them wants to hold
[1:53:29] on to it right or they feel traps they
[1:53:31] can't expose it expose the devil I ain't
[1:53:34] no one's human shield
[1:53:36] sirl I ain't a human shield here friends
[1:53:39] and neither are you right so let's not
[1:53:41] let's not be afraid of the one who can
[1:53:43] come and take over our storm oh but this
[1:53:47] and this problem this situ this how I
[1:53:48] was
[1:53:49] raised forget that stuff he's still
[1:53:52] walking on the Storm you got to invite
[1:53:53] him into your
[1:53:54] boat amen and I would do that with all
[1:53:57] my heart if I was you hallelujah

[1:54:08] Hallelujah invite him into your boat
[1:54:13] amen
[1:54:16] hallelujah I just read this this is the
[1:54:18] quote um he says here now this a
[1:54:22] testimony on the sea 1964 but what I'm
[1:54:24] afraid of you Pentecostals is ecumenical
[1:54:26] council is going to take you that's the
[1:54:28] thing it's going to form the mark of the
[1:54:29] beast you're going to go into it because
[1:54:31] you're an organization you have to get
[1:54:33] in or get out that's the thing and any
[1:54:35] good sensible spiritual person knows
[1:54:36] that he says we need another upon the
[1:54:39] sea testimony and the reason we need
[1:54:42] that is because it brings what God has
[1:54:44] done and who he is back into our back
[1:54:47] into reality because if we remember what
[1:54:49] he's done and what he who he is we won't
[1:54:51] drift off
