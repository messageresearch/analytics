[0:08] [Music]
[0:26] god bless you Saints
[0:28] welcome to the house of the Lord what a
[0:35] week a weekend maybe but I've saw
[0:39] testimony before we start
[0:43] you know in the Lord gives you a promise
[0:46] and the devil tries to steal it from you
[0:49] you got pretty much a fight on your
[0:52] hands Lee and brother Isaac preached on
[0:57] negotiation - how do we negotiate with
[1:00] the devil and and bit of a testimony and
[1:03] I thought I just felt led to share it
[1:06] with you guys we had a bit of news come
[1:11] away and was good news and halfway
[1:16] through the trial didn't basically or
[1:19] beginning of the trial the doctor says
[1:22] it's not such may be such good news you
[1:24] know like they're going I can maybe say
[1:27] if I'm allowed to share it so we found
[1:29] out that sister Chantal and I was
[1:33] expecting another little one and so what
[1:38] happened is halfway through it she got
[1:40] really bad stomach pains real real bad
[1:42] stomach pains and she wasn't feeling too
[1:44] well we had to go to the doctor and they
[1:47] were all saying oh it's gonna be a
[1:49] miscarriage maybe you and all those
[1:50] possibilities of what it could be and
[1:52] this was the Friday when we went to the
[1:54] doctor what's the fried it wasn't it and
[1:56] of course y'all stressed out because
[1:59] it's all new stuff again and I just kept
[2:04] saying if the Lord's given the child
[2:07] then the Lord will bring it to pass
[2:08] because it's from the Lord which we
[2:10] prayed it in according to his world so I
[2:13] said so I'll just state was the word of
[2:14] the Lord and I won't believe the report
[2:16] of the doctors though you still in the
[2:20] back of your mind you fight these mind
[2:21] battles what if what if and all those
[2:23] things but you still have a choice to
[2:25] choose the Word of God and the promises
[2:27] of God above anything else and there's
[2:31] so suddenly when we came in we have this
[2:33] sermon called negotiation and how much
[2:35] of that pie do you want to give away
[2:38] and thank you brother Isaac God bless
[2:40] you fall for all the the labor that you
[2:43] put into your sermons as well because
[2:45] pretty much most of them are for me and
[2:48] and I was sitting at the back and I just
[2:51] decided yes how much of this do we give
[2:53] to Satan and how much do we give to God
[2:56] if everything belongs to God
[2:58] then all just let him fight the battle
[3:00] and I'll just give everything to him
[3:01] because it's a win-win
[3:02] I can't lose if he takes away I can't
[3:05] lose if he gives I can't lose it's still
[3:07] his walk and there so the Monday we went
[3:10] back and we win for some scans and the
[3:14] doctor said everything is fine there's
[3:16] just a couple of things that should
[3:18] still heal and stuff but everything is
[3:20] fine and praise the Lord there is a
[3:22] heartbeat and everything so yeah raise
[3:26] the Lord so yeah what do you believe so
[3:29] let's just all stand up and I don't know
[3:33] brother Chris you're right okay so just
[3:40] take you you want to do a special so
[3:46] let's just open in a word of Prayer

[22:50] your face frowning than smiling so you
[22:54] use less muscles and smile it'll do you
[22:57] good
[22:57] amen Isaiah 14 and 11 we're gonna read I
[23:02] don't have a slideshow or any such thing
[23:03] but let's go from Isaiah 14 verse 11 it
[23:06] says thy pomp has brought down to the
[23:09] grave and the noise of thy vials the
[23:11] worm has spread under thee and the worms
[23:13] cover thee how thou art fallen from
[23:15] heaven o Lucifer son of the morning how
[23:17] art thou cut down to the ground which to
[23:19] this week in the nation's for thou hast
[23:21] said in thine heart I will ascend into
[23:23] heaven I shall exalt my throne above the
[23:25] stars I will sit upon the Mount of the
[23:28] congregation and the sides of the north
[23:30] I will ascend above the height of the
[23:32] clouds I will be like the Most High
[23:34] that's a lot of i wills isn't it yet
[23:37] thou shall be brought down to hell to
[23:39] the sides of the pit they that see thee
[23:41] shall narrowly look upon thee and
[23:43] consider thee can you turn me down a
[23:45] little bit saying this is as this the
[23:47] man that made the earth to tremble that
[23:49] did shake kingdoms that made the world
[23:51] as a wilderness and destroyed the cities
[23:53] thereof that opened not the house of his
[23:57] prisoners let's go to Luke chapter 18
[24:00] and we're going to read from verse 9
[24:04] down to verse 14 of Luke 18 this may
[24:10] seem rather unusual scriptures but here
[24:18] we are Luke 18 and verse 9 and he spake
[24:21] this parable unto certain which trusted
[24:24] in themselves that were righteous and
[24:26] despised others
[24:27] two men went up into the temple to pray
[24:29] one a Pharisee and the other Republican
[24:31] the Pharisee stood and prayed thus
[24:33] within himself god I think neither that
[24:36] I am NOT as other men are extortioners
[24:39] unjust adulterers or even as this
[24:40] publican I fast twice in a week I give
[24:43] tithes of all that I possess and the
[24:45] publican standing afar off would not
[24:48] lift so much as his eyes unto heaven but
[24:51] smote upon his breast saying God be
[24:53] merciful to me a sinner
[24:54] I tell you this man went down to his
[24:57] house justified rather than the other
[24:59] for everyone that exalted himself shall
[25:01] be abased and he that humbleth himself
[25:02] shall be exalted I mean this bow heads
[25:06] for a word of Prayer
[25:07] gracious Lord Jesus we truly are amazed
[25:09] that you love us law we want to thank
[25:12] you Lord your love is not like human
[25:13] love it goes beyond and gracious father
[25:16] we want to thank you we can gather on
[25:17] this cold night Lord in your house and
[25:19] Lord we just pray that you'll anoint
[25:22] your word - Lord anoint speaker and hear
[25:25] one more time and not your word - every
[25:27] one of us dear God I pray that Lord as
[25:30] you said in your word that your word
[25:31] will not return unto the void but will
[25:33] it but it will accomplish that which
[25:35] you've sent it to do so father I pray
[25:37] your word would accomplish this night
[25:39] what you've sent it to do and dear God
[25:41] we just ask father you'll just touch
[25:43] each one here Lord those who are sick
[25:45] and body those may be the troubled in
[25:47] spirit Lord I pray you would heal them
[25:48] father be at those who maybe are
[25:51] watching by the way of the internet dear
[25:52] God and I just ask father that you'd
[25:54] have preeminence Lord in our lives not
[25:57] just here in these four walls but Lord
[25:59] when the Lord when we leave this place
[26:00] may have preeminence in every life for
[26:03] your glory we want to commit the service
[26:05] into your hands we thank you in Jesus
[26:07] Christ's name Amen amen god bless your
[26:09] friends you may have your seats tonight
[26:11] so what do I want to speak I want to
[26:15] speak about self will worship now we we
[26:19] read here about about Lucifer and it's
[26:21] amazing where you know here here he was
[26:23] and in his great splendor and you know
[26:27] we would read if maybe you want to maybe
[26:33] go to the Book of Ezekiel but you know
[26:34] we were going to turn there soon but you
[26:36] see how he he had this ambition that he
[26:39] wanted to ascend
[26:41] and to heaven you know he wanted to be
[26:42] like the Most High one to exalt him yo
[26:45] whose throne above you the stars of God
[26:47] and and we understand that be but the
[26:49] end of his his plans that he'll come to
[26:52] ruin now this met these two men we read
[26:55] about here in Luke 18 now you may think
[26:58] that these are two very different type
[27:00] of scripture but I'd like to speak on
[27:02] the subject of of self-will worship and
[27:05] I want to show you that what started in
[27:08] the heart of Lucifer ends up in man and
[27:11] and the the ambition that Lucifer had
[27:15] and then his heart that eat that he had
[27:17] that finally there come to a point where
[27:19] iniquity was found in him we that that
[27:21] is born in every man whether he liked it
[27:23] or not so you know we understand from
[27:26] the scripture that sin did not start on
[27:28] upon the earth but it started in heaven
[27:30] as it says in Revelations 12 that there
[27:32] was war in heaven Michael and his angels
[27:34] fought against the Dragon and the dragon
[27:36] fought and his angels and prevailed not
[27:38] I like those words and prevailed not
[27:40] neither was their place found any more
[27:42] in heaven and the Great Dragon was cast
[27:44] out that old serpent called the devil
[27:46] and Satan which deceiveth the whole
[27:48] world he was cast out into the earth and
[27:50] his angels were cast out with them so
[27:53] soon began in heaven and we know that it
[27:55] didn't just start in any place in heaven
[27:57] but it started in the heart of Lucifer
[27:59] that's where Sun began I mean he may
[28:02] never have I don't know time I know time
[28:04] was there but you know you could say
[28:06] there came a time where he began to
[28:07] think about himself above what God made
[28:10] him to be and you know I'm so glad that
[28:13] the Word of God reveals the enemy's
[28:15] heart so we know what he's thinking we
[28:17] know what is the gender is we're not
[28:19] ignorant to his devices so you know we
[28:22] do not know how long Lucifer you know
[28:24] when he was created as the anointed
[28:26] cherub that covereth
[28:26] you know we do not know how long he
[28:28] really maintained that position that God
[28:30] made him to be we do not know how long
[28:32] he was there and he actually you know
[28:34] worship God according as God has made
[28:36] him and we do not know how long it took
[28:39] until finally iniquity was found in his
[28:41] heart we do not know these things but
[28:43] the thing we do know is that he began to
[28:46] look he has his focus went upon what God
[28:50] made him to be to himself and this is
[28:53] where Nick what he started
[28:55] when he wasn't looking at what God made
[28:58] him to be he began to look at how great
[29:00] he thought he was and this is where
[29:02] iniquity started when your eyes go off
[29:05] the Lord and go upon you you have the
[29:08] same heart Lucifer hairs amen now and
[29:15] then and then we know that there came a
[29:17] time where he began to look at himself
[29:18] and nicker he was found in his heart
[29:20] then he began to influence angels to
[29:22] leave their original estate as well of
[29:25] of you know their function of worshiping
[29:27] the Lord or whatever they are called to
[29:29] do in heaven and you know and and there
[29:32] came a time when Lucifer he did not
[29:34] begin to worship God out of a pure heart
[29:36] but he began to look how great he was
[29:39] instead of looking how great God is and
[29:41] we read here as I said turning to
[29:43] Ezekiel 28 we can read this if you want
[29:46] to follow with me this is very important
[29:48] because we will man worships their
[29:52] situation they they worship their own
[29:56] poor Me's they worship their pity
[29:58] parties and what's happened the same
[30:01] heart that was in Lucifer's and in that
[30:03] person and we don't want to get into
[30:05] that as that that state of being because
[30:08] as you take the two in the temple one
[30:11] was worshiping God out of a pure heart
[30:13] forgive me Lord I'm a sinner
[30:15] the other one was worshiping God out of
[30:17] a complex or a pain or whatever I was
[30:18] saying Lord I'm happy I'm not like this
[30:20] guy and who was received the Pharisee
[30:22] wasn't received he was a Pharisee you
[30:25] see Pharisees aren't received but a pure
[30:27] heart is received by God and we don't
[30:30] want to worship God will be believers
[30:32] based on what people have done to us
[30:33] what other people are doing that's
[30:35] irrelevant we want to worship God
[30:36] because He is God I mean in our whole
[30:39] lives don't wanna be based on some
[30:41] conflicts or pain or something from our
[30:43] past our whole lives when we based on
[30:45] here's God that's where I'm going if
[30:47] you're earning where are you going with
[30:48] this that's where I'm going
[30:49] so I'll just color in until we get to
[30:51] that point all right so zekiel 28 and 12
[30:54] son of man take up a lamentation upon
[30:56] the king of Tyrus and we know that this
[30:58] is actually speaking of the anointing
[31:00] that was upon that King and say unto Him
[31:02] thus saith the Lord God
[31:03] still thou seal us up the sum full of
[31:06] wisdom perfect and beauty thou has been
[31:09] in the garden of God every precious
[31:10] stone was like covering the sadhus the
[31:13] Topaz and the diamond the Beryl the ox
[31:15] and the Jasper the sapphire the emerald
[31:17] and the carbuncle the gold the
[31:19] workmanship of our tablets and of our
[31:21] pipes was prepared in the in the day
[31:23] that that was created
[31:24] thou art the anointed cherub that
[31:26] covereth I have set thee so that was
[31:28] upon the holy mountain of God thou has
[31:30] walked up and down in the midst of the
[31:32] stones of fire that was perfect in my
[31:34] ways from the day that that was created
[31:36] till iniquity was found in thee by the
[31:40] multitude of thy merchandise they have
[31:42] they have filled the mists of thee with
[31:44] violence and thou has sinned therefore I
[31:46] will cast thee as profane out of the
[31:49] mountain of God I will destroy thee Oh
[31:51] cover antara from the midst of the
[31:54] stones of fire thine heart was lifted up
[31:56] because of thy beauty thou has corrupted
[31:59] by wisdom by reason of our brightness
[32:01] I will kasi to the ground our lady
[32:03] before Kings that they may behold thee
[32:06] see see his heart was lifted up because
[32:09] he began to look how great he was I mean
[32:12] that's why iniquity he was perfect in
[32:14] all his ways in his ways until iniquity
[32:17] was found in him why because he began to
[32:19] look at how great he was more than how
[32:21] great God is
[32:22] amen so this is why his heart was lifted
[32:24] up it wasn't lifted up because of
[32:26] something around him because who he was
[32:28] his heart was lifted up and it's the
[32:31] same thing can happen with us because we
[32:33] know that that same nature was injected
[32:35] into the human race by the original sin
[32:37] whether we like it or not now see if we
[32:42] look at this great being his heart was
[32:45] lifted up because of his own beauty and
[32:47] because of his own beauty his heart was
[32:49] lifted up then he began to have ambition
[32:51] and sidon began with two words maybe in
[32:55] his heart I will now when you say you
[32:58] will instead of God will all thy will be
[33:00] done
[33:01] Jesus and the model prayer thy will be
[33:03] done in earth as it is in heaven
[33:06] what on earth does he really talk about
[33:07] to me thing about this earth this living
[33:10] earth may your will be expressed in this
[33:12] as it is in heaven see that was the
[33:14] model prayer that God yo yo that Jesus
[33:17] gave us disciples that we would call
[33:19] Lord your will not my
[33:21] so as soon as we say I will out of our
[33:24] own humanity
[33:26] that's Antichrist that's an antichrist
[33:28] spirit right there because anything
[33:30] that's anti god is Antichrist so if your
[33:33] will is contrary to the Word of God it
[33:35] is an antichrist will it is what it is a
[33:38] mean so that's the last thing we want is
[33:41] to have our own will but the devil wants
[33:44] you to have your own will that's why
[33:46] you've got to give your will over to God
[33:48] he that loses his life shall save it and
[33:50] he that saves his life shall lose it
[33:52] well how do you lose your life you give
[33:54] it to him you give it to the Lord
[33:55] therefore you'll save it you've got to
[33:57] give it a way to keep it or to save it
[34:01] he says I will ascend into heaven I will
[34:04] exalt my throne above the stars of God
[34:05] I'll ascend above the height of the
[34:08] clouds I'll be like the Most High what
[34:09] did he do he begin to worship his own
[34:11] will because his will was no longer
[34:14] God's will because it was now focused on
[34:17] his own ambition his own self
[34:20] you know many times we say we don't feel
[34:25] lead to do something but really we just
[34:27] don't want to step out of our comfort
[34:29] zone and we use our own comfort zone as
[34:32] an excuse they're following the Word of
[34:35] God
[34:35] I don't feel late - it's actually
[34:37] because we just comfortable in what we
[34:38] do we don't want to follow earn will man
[34:41] has followed his own will and look where
[34:43] the world is there's bombs and the
[34:46] hangers it's going to blow and it's
[34:49] going to be horrible
[34:50] we've already destroyed this world
[34:52] plastic and everything they found rubber
[34:54] you know some some plastic things that
[34:56] you know the deepest part of the ocean
[34:58] this rubbish deepest part of the ocean
[35:01] they found rubbish down there
[35:02] we've polluted this world because of
[35:04] man's idea it's man's world let's do
[35:06] this
[35:07] how's it going to work out not good and
[35:09] your own will will always end up not
[35:12] good now we can come to a spot where we
[35:19] are no longer worshipping the God out
[35:21] worshiping the Lord out of a pure heart
[35:24] or motive but we worship him out of a
[35:27] complex or hurt from other believers or
[35:30] something someone said or even pressure
[35:33] amen
[35:35] yes we can actually be worshipping our
[35:38] own pain our past or current situation
[35:41] what do you give first place in your
[35:43] life the thing you give first place is
[35:46] the thing you worship be it your job a
[35:48] hobby you know whatever it may be
[35:51] even your family you just worshiping
[35:54] that if it's first place see or a pup or
[36:00] our past or something even something
[36:02] that happened many years ago you never
[36:03] see the person again but yet that grips
[36:05] us and we worship it why cuz everything
[36:09] that happens to us now we filter through
[36:10] that event or help you know the words
[36:12] that person said or how they treated us
[36:14] and we get taken back because we're
[36:16] still holding it and what happens we're
[36:18] reacting out of something that happened
[36:19] maybe years ago I don't want to worship
[36:22] God that way and when I talk about
[36:24] worshiping God I'm talking about living
[36:25] everyday life because everyday life is
[36:27] worship it's not just here and singing
[36:29] and raising hands and whatever everyday
[36:32] life how you treat each other how you
[36:34] treat your family hey treat your brother
[36:36] and sister how you treat people in the
[36:37] world that should be a worship because
[36:39] you should be expressing to them what
[36:41] God has done for you
[36:43] now we know Satan has been studying
[36:46] humanity for 6,000 years and he knows
[36:49] how humanity works he know how the human
[36:52] spirit embody work he knows how to use
[36:54] our own human nature against us so
[36:57] remember the devil he will attack us
[36:59] with sickness in our bodies he'll attack
[37:01] us with sickness in our spirit realms
[37:04] give us mind battles try and use our
[37:05] memory against us our frictions our
[37:07] reasoning our imaginations he will we
[37:09] try and use all those things against us
[37:11] but we're going to understand just
[37:12] because he's attacking us in our body or
[37:14] in our spirit doesn't mean he can't get
[37:16] our soul I mean so we can be he can be
[37:19] bombarding us but that doesn't mean
[37:20] we're not a believer right but what
[37:22] happens is we expect that once we meet
[37:24] the Lord everything's going to be fine
[37:26] there'll be no more troubles no more but
[37:28] that's when the battle starts I mean
[37:30] that's when the devil really points us
[37:31] guns are you I mean when you meet when
[37:33] you meet God for yourself that's when
[37:35] has the guns of hell are trained amen we
[37:38] understand we're not in a picnic but
[37:40] we're being given overcoming power
[37:42] I remember just because we may be sick
[37:45] or we maybe whatever that doesn't mean
[37:46] we're not a believer but the devil will
[37:49] use those things against us you see that
[37:51] you see that you see that you just said
[37:53] no no you see him we will be tried by
[37:57] every spirit I'm just throwing some
[37:59] statements out there we will be tried by
[38:01] every spirit I didn't expect a
[38:05] hallelujah will be tried by depression
[38:07] will be tried by pressure will be tried
[38:11] by lust will be tried by jealousy will
[38:13] be tried by bitterness what we tried by
[38:16] hatred every spirit you can name it will
[38:19] come and try you whether you like it or
[38:21] not but God has confidence in the
[38:23] salvation yeah you have to have
[38:25] confidence in it - amen no brother brand
[38:28] makes a statement of why Christ speaker
[38:30] says I'm so glad that man can so
[38:32] completely serve God till he the devil
[38:35] don't know what to do with them that's
[38:36] right just obey God so completely till
[38:39] the devil said well get out of my get
[38:41] away I can't don't want to hear it no
[38:43] more you can do it so completely now
[38:46] that doesn't mean that you know a man
[38:48] can so completely serve God till the
[38:50] devil doesn't try that means that a man
[38:53] can so completely serve God til the
[38:55] devil don't know what to do them so the
[38:57] devil will try bitterness or resentment
[38:59] or lust or jealousy or money or pride or
[39:02] job or whatever more and he'll just come
[39:05] to conclusion nothing that I do works
[39:06] why because the person is so completely
[39:09] surrendered to God the devil tries all
[39:12] of us tricks and they don't work amen I
[39:16] try I trust that's our testimony I mean
[39:19] the weekend so completely serve God the
[39:20] devil just I don't know what to do with
[39:22] these people
[39:23] Allu you but in order to do that we have
[39:27] to stay surrendered and you like that
[39:30] you know you make a choice will you be
[39:32] surrendered to the Lord or will you
[39:33] surrender yourself to that complex or
[39:35] what the devil does or what that person
[39:37] did deal what it will the you know what
[39:39] are you going to yield yourself to
[39:41] you've got a choice brother BAM says the
[39:43] greatest enemy I've got as william
[39:45] branham he's the one that gets in God's
[39:47] way I'll say the greatest enemy I have
[39:48] is being glowing he's the one that gets
[39:50] in God's Way amen he's the one that gets
[39:53] lazy he's the one that gets to apply
[39:56] sometimes where he thinks he can do
[39:57] something about it and when he does that
[39:59] shoves God right out of the picture
[40:01] my Amen but when I can get rid of that
[40:05] guy I'll say this guy when I can get to
[40:07] a place where he's out of the way
[40:08] thank God can come over and do things
[40:10] that william branham knows nothing about
[40:12] or or if I can get this guy the way God
[40:15] can come and do things that being glory
[40:16] knows nothing about I want to be that
[40:18] kind of person yeah God so I'll say you
[40:21] know can I tag in have you ever seen
[40:23] wrestling they tag in and out because I
[40:25] want to tag in I want to show you some
[40:27] things gonna get yourself out of the way
[40:29] hallelujah those who don't know
[40:31] wrestling looked at me with blank faces
[40:32] right in now that's when God can use you
[40:34] it's when he can he can use any of you
[40:36] he can use anybody when we get out of
[40:39] the way but as long as we got ourselves
[40:41] in the way then we cannot he says all
[40:44] right us is that imperfect drink by
[40:45] perfect weakness so he fights you the
[40:48] devil fight you in these places you know
[40:51] the spirit realm in your body because he
[40:53] knows he can't make you an unbeliever
[40:56] amen see just because he fights you it
[40:59] doesn't mean you don't have the Holy
[41:00] Ghost brother and says heal heal heal
[41:01] heal heal fight at you but sit but it's
[41:05] up to you open the door or not amen now
[41:08] let's look at the two men in the you
[41:11] know let's just look at the two men of
[41:12] the temple the Pharisee was not
[41:14] worshiping the Lord out of a pure heart
[41:16] he was worshiping the Lord based on how
[41:20] he was compared to others so he was
[41:22] little this is like this this person's
[41:24] like this he wasn't there saying all
[41:26] jehovah god you're so wonderful thank
[41:28] you you're our God thank you you saved
[41:30] us from sin and we're not worshiping
[41:31] idols and thank you we're your people
[41:33] and I'm one of your children
[41:35] here's others persons like this and this
[41:37] person's doing this and that's the I
[41:38] don't quite like there in the church and
[41:40] you know he was examining analyzing
[41:42] everything he wasn't worshiping God
[41:44] saying you're so wonderful he was there
[41:45] saying well and better than those people
[41:47] and God doesn't accept that kind of
[41:50] worship
[41:50] I've often marvel where David or you
[41:53] would say sacrifices and offerings thou
[41:55] yo you don't want them you know you want
[41:59] people to come with a pure heart you
[42:01] don't want all these things and you're
[42:03] going through the motion God's not
[42:04] interested just going through the motion
[42:06] he wants people with a pure heart to
[42:07] worship him that way
[42:09] I mean so so the Pharisee he was but
[42:11] then you know there was a reason he
[42:13] became this way a Pharisee isn't born a
[42:16] Pharisee he doesn't just pop out of the
[42:19] room and say my mother sees this here
[42:20] and listen Lauren didn't know he's
[42:22] molded a certain way his environment and
[42:25] what molded him to become a Pharisee you
[42:29] see you know so we have to we have to be
[42:34] careful and I'll come down to the life
[42:36] within us molds us now the two men in
[42:40] the scripture here we were in the temple
[42:42] you know those that you know those that
[42:45] are like this Pharisee what do they have
[42:47] they have some kind of conflicts some
[42:49] kind of inferiority something that they
[42:51] actually worshiping God through it's not
[42:53] a pure worship
[42:54] it's worshiping through something hey
[42:58] you all follow how's everyone tonight we
[43:00] don't want to come to church and say
[43:02] well this is this way and this is this
[43:03] way this person's like this and all they
[43:05] wore that two months ago and I can't
[43:06] believe this is you know I'm not here
[43:09] I'm not here to worship based on those
[43:12] things I don't have a good service of
[43:14] brother Andy's got a red tie on or not
[43:17] you know that's not what dictates my
[43:20] worship you say that sounds ridiculous
[43:22] anything that gets in the way of God is
[43:24] ridiculous
[43:25] I mean well that person did that to me
[43:27] that's what you know compared to God
[43:29] waters it's just ridiculous throw it to
[43:31] one side who you who you're here to
[43:33] worship who you
[43:34] why are you upon the earth it's not
[43:35] because that person or that person that
[43:37] that's you now you're a believer because
[43:39] God revealed themselves to you God
[43:40] called you God loved you hallelujah amen
[43:45] in there and that's but but that's
[43:47] always the challenge you know I remember
[43:50] when Oh you know you first meet the Lord
[43:53] everything's wonderful I mean I know
[43:57] what it's like to be lost I know what
[43:59] it's like to be found I know what it's
[44:01] like to not have the Holy Ghost I know
[44:03] what it's like to receive the Holy Ghost
[44:04] I know what it's like to not know my
[44:06] sins are forgiven I don't know it's like
[44:08] to know my sins are forgiven
[44:10] hallelujah and you meet him and it's
[44:11] just glorious and the word comes up and
[44:13] he becomes real amen he is having a
[44:16] jubilee and doesn't matter what's going
[44:17] on you know and and maybe is letting
[44:21] people would say to you remember
[44:23] that happened and that happened you know
[44:24] I don't I was having a Jubilee myself
[44:27] it's just you and God in this great
[44:29] bubble and your rejoicing amen now you
[44:34] say well why isn't it like that anymore
[44:35] well what do you got your eyes on amen
[44:40] you know you know what I mean
[44:44] see self-will worship can come in the
[44:49] most subtle way this Pharisee on the
[44:52] outside look good he did everything to
[44:54] the leader he was a good Christian you
[44:56] could say a good believer outwardly but
[44:59] inwardly he was wrong we don't want to
[45:02] be like that
[45:03] he was worshiping his own will his
[45:07] worship was out of not out of love but
[45:10] it was by selfish motives the brother
[45:12] Braun would speak in the church age book
[45:14] and and he would say this is in the age
[45:16] of the Reformation and he says for one
[45:19] thing they did not oppose this is from a
[45:22] Sadducee in church age for one thing
[45:24] they did not oppose the church state
[45:26] marriage of the Nicene council but
[45:28] actually fostered that Union had me the
[45:31] defense of the gospel by the state was
[45:33] welcomed there was no word for it and
[45:36] and though we can see the wrath of God
[45:39] praising man and such events as Henry
[45:42] the eighth
[45:42] taking up for the Reformation and the
[45:44] rejection of the papal Authority it was
[45:46] a far cry from the truth truth of
[45:48] Pentecost and the protection of an
[45:51] omnipotent God
[45:52] now Henry the eighth wanted to remarry
[45:54] who knows history Henry the eighth want
[45:56] to remarry but the Pope said you can't
[45:58] so he just got offended say I'm gonna do
[46:00] it anyway and then he broke the you know
[46:03] the Church of England he broke it away
[46:05] from the papal control and made the
[46:07] Church of England so was the wrath of
[46:09] man praising God so he wasn't endorsing
[46:12] the Reformation because he wanted a
[46:13] closer walk with God he wanted the Bible
[46:15] printed and he wanted people to walk in
[46:17] truth he was worshipping God because he
[46:19] wanted to get married again it's that
[46:22] simple why did the Reformation really
[46:24] start in England there because he wanted
[46:26] to get married again
[46:27] so was the wrath of man praising God it
[46:29] wasn't out of a pure heart that's
[46:30] because he wanted to get married again
[46:33] amen
[46:35] and people can become the most devout
[46:37] believers because of something like that
[46:39] because the bigots in their bonnet
[46:41] because of something and something and
[46:43] something and it's the wrath of man
[46:45] praising God oh but we're in the Eagle
[46:47] Age brother being here we are but if
[46:49] you're on the ground you got to you'll
[46:51] be like that but if you're soaring in
[46:52] the heavenlies you're not like that you
[46:54] cannot be amen
[46:57] this is in 2nd Corinthians 10 and 12 for
[46:59] we dare not make ourselves of the number
[47:01] or compare ourselves with some that
[47:03] commend themselves but they measuring
[47:05] themselves by themselves and comparing
[47:07] themselves among themselves are not wise
[47:09] so if you compare yourself with yourself
[47:12] yeah the bride compares herself with the
[47:15] bride you're not wise we want to be wise
[47:17] I mean well who do you compete yourself
[47:19] with this amen that's why I should spend
[47:23] time listening for the message reading
[47:24] the Bible say God mold and shape me amen
[47:27] to your image amen brother bran picks up
[47:32] a scripture from Galatians where faith
[47:34] worketh by love
[47:36] amen faith does not work by the wrath of
[47:38] man or a complex or pain or pride
[47:42] whatever it is he says now the word
[47:44] plainly States if you want to put this
[47:46] down in Galatians five and six that
[47:48] faith worketh by love see faith worketh
[47:51] by love and the only way you can have
[47:52] faith is to have love first because
[47:55] after all faith is loves incentive and
[47:58] sin if that's what faith is it is an
[48:00] incentive to love now if you don't love
[48:02] you can't have faith how now how can you
[48:07] have faith in your wife if you don't
[48:09] love her that's in the Fila that's human
[48:11] love then how about the agapo to God how
[48:14] can it be if you don't love God if you
[48:16] said you love your wife and never tell
[48:18] her about it never sit down and make
[48:20] love to her express it to her kiss her
[48:21] hugger tell her she's the best cook in
[48:23] the country all the things that you know
[48:25] and how pretty she is and how much you
[48:27] love her if you don't do that she'll
[48:29] never know it that's the way if you do
[48:31] love her you express it and all the
[48:34] husband said Amen absolutely and all the
[48:39] wife said Amen that's how I express my
[48:42] love to my spouse I tell them and I
[48:44] showed and word indeed amen
[48:48] my I need to preach on love of it amen
[48:54] hallelujah
[48:56] see faith worketh by love what's your
[49:00] motivation the Pharisees motivation was
[49:02] one better than the sky if I stay better
[49:04] than this guy it means my social
[49:06] standing is better people will look at
[49:08] me better than they look at the publican
[49:10] isn't he and yo mr. Pharisee goes the
[49:13] temple all here he comes look at him
[49:14] he's already maybe you know made him
[49:16] looking mat yo made himself local
[49:18] contoured and sincere or whatever you
[49:20] know this stuff he's just a Pharisee but
[49:23] outwardly aw paste eyes look oh he's the
[49:25] model believer is he the publican was
[49:28] the model believer Amen this world is in
[49:34] chaos because man has said in his heart
[49:37] I will now external influences will make
[49:46] you a part of who you are but if you are
[49:50] totally surrenders of God and
[49:51] surrendered to his word then no matter
[49:53] what circumstances they are in life the
[49:55] life and you will be produced now humans
[49:59] you know you take you take you take
[50:02] natural life you take like flowers and
[50:04] so on the life and the seed will bring
[50:07] forth it may sure you know things will
[50:13] grow in better conditions but the same
[50:15] life will be produced you know just say
[50:17] if you take a pumpkin seed and you put
[50:19] it on one kind of soil it's not going to
[50:21] make an apple tree it's gonna be a
[50:22] pumpkin right you change it to another
[50:25] soil it's going to be a pumpkin again
[50:26] because of life within it now but the
[50:28] human being in one respect is a little
[50:30] different because we're born with a
[50:33] fallen nature and without God giving us
[50:35] a new birth where there's no longer our
[50:37] first nature living but his life has
[50:39] nature amen then the the life within us
[50:43] will mold us a certain way how our human
[50:46] that's why we have to be born again
[50:48] because our first nature is rotten amen
[50:54] the first nature that you receive
[50:56] doesn't matter how good your parents
[50:57] were how great whatever it's still
[50:59] rotten you ought to be birthed
[51:02] I mean and when you receive a new birth
[51:03] you have a different nature than what
[51:05] you once had a man it's not a patch-up
[51:07] job but the life has now being lived out
[51:10] of you it's very different to what you
[51:11] once had amen
[51:14] now let's say the environment that we
[51:17] live in can change us but it all depends
[51:23] if you're allowed to or not you're we
[51:25] all have a choice I mean we all have a
[51:28] choice and every choice in life will
[51:32] either make us better or better choose
[51:35] either stay which what you want to be a
[51:37] better person or do you want to be a
[51:38] better person
[51:39] amen I'd rather be a better not a better
[51:43] Amen it's isn't you know about Daniel
[51:46] Daniel was a man incredible men he was
[51:50] taken from Israel and to Babylon he was
[51:53] taken to a place with a strange language
[51:55] strange gods strange culture different
[51:58] kind of place in the world he was taken
[52:01] to an alien land but yet he purposed in
[52:04] himself that he would not defile himself
[52:06] with the portion of the Kings meat amen
[52:08] he it would it would say of Daniel
[52:11] Daniel 6 and 3 that this Daniel was
[52:13] preferred above the presidents and
[52:15] princes because an excellent spirit was
[52:17] in him I mean so Daniel had an excellent
[52:20] spirit Daniel purposed in his heart that
[52:22] he would serve God hallelujah so now he
[52:26] didn't he didn't um so so he purposed
[52:29] that his environment would not change
[52:31] who he really was I mean cuz he knew who
[52:34] he was in the Lord now this was more
[52:37] than just being fundamental and praying
[52:39] three times a day like Daniel having our
[52:41] quiet time but what is the motivation in
[52:44] doing so I meant as our motivation out
[52:47] of love thank you lord
[52:48] I'm redeemed I'm going to heaven that
[52:51] should create worship hallelujah all my
[52:54] sins are washed away all my guilt all my
[52:56] shame on my pain all my past that's
[52:58] washed away I don't know where it's God
[53:01] I don't care it's gone hallelujah glory
[53:05] be to God amen so you got to see what is
[53:09] your motivation and doing it now the
[53:10] devil will try and tell you there's no
[53:12] point but there's a great purpose and
[53:14] worship
[53:16] listening to the word and prayer amen
[53:18] the scripture would say you know many
[53:22] people worship their own will and this
[53:24] is not just people who are not
[53:25] Christians or even just denominational
[53:27] people but this is message people we're
[53:29] people - I mean we're not different you
[53:32] know this thing is the same right
[53:37] yeah the scripture would say that people
[53:38] would become lovers of their own selves
[53:41] they've been lovers of pleasure more
[53:43] than lovers of gods they love God but
[53:45] they love pleasures more so they love
[53:47] their own will and what pleases the
[53:49] flesh more than loving God amen now
[53:53] brother Bram says an identification he
[53:56] says and you know it's one of the
[53:57] greatest hindrances that the Church of
[53:59] God has the bootlegger the gamble of
[54:01] them people we all know which way they
[54:04] are headed and they know themselves but
[54:06] the fellow who possesses professes to be
[54:08] a Christian the woman that professes to
[54:11] be a Christian and then live something
[54:13] different that's the greatest stumbling
[54:15] block that the outside world has got
[54:17] that as their as the outside world
[54:19] anywhere it's worse than anything the
[54:21] world can produce as a person that's
[54:23] supposed to be a Christian and lives
[54:25] something else different than that lying
[54:29] stealing cheating doing things that he
[54:31] ought not to do
[54:32] that's a discredit to us testimony when
[54:35] you take people that do those things
[54:37] there and they re says our character is
[54:41] moulded and thereby the life that's in
[54:44] us so if the life of God is in you your
[54:48] character will be molded by that life
[54:51] but if your carnal nature is in there
[54:54] then your life will be your character we
[54:57] were molded by your carnal nature to
[55:00] can't live in the same house at once so
[55:02] I thought I'm dead in Christ lives Rome
[55:03] alive in Christ is not here I mean
[55:06] brother Brahim signified the spirit of
[55:07] Beethoven I'd write great symphonies if
[55:10] I had the spirit of Michelangelo in me
[55:12] I'd do great masterpieces he said my
[55:14] cleanser and I can't live in the same
[55:15] place to give either he's live or I'm
[55:17] dead or he's dead and I'm alive
[55:19] amen brother Brown would speak in the
[55:23] restoration the bride tree now forgive
[55:25] me for I just want I'm just going
[55:27] through this okay
[55:29] he would
[55:29] he would speak of the four stages of the
[55:32] Antichrist spirit eating away at the
[55:33] church and the last part of it was the
[55:36] bark being being eaten off and their
[55:39] bark we know speaks of the doctrine that
[55:41] covers up for the life to come forth now
[55:43] you can you can actually say well I
[55:47] believe right but how you treat people
[55:50] and the character you have because what
[55:52] you believe is expressed right so so
[55:56] what you saw it saw it so in other words
[55:59] if I believed that a husband should just
[56:02] be like a like a dictator and my word is
[56:05] final my family can't say anything if I
[56:08] really believe that then my life would
[56:09] show it right so that is my doctrine
[56:12] being expressed you following me
[56:15] right but I don't believe that but if I
[56:17] did that's that's what would happen amen
[56:21] so now if you take away so real doctrine
[56:24] will allow the life of God to come forth
[56:27] but because if you had you kill a tree
[56:30] you ring bark it and then the life camp
[56:32] can't grow up and it actually kills the
[56:35] tree just by cutting the bark off the
[56:37] tree so if you take real Bible doctrine
[56:41] out of a person's life brother om says
[56:44] what happens as they as they as they
[56:46] take away the bark they put a rag over a
[56:48] man-made rag to try and cover it with a
[56:50] bark is gone you can't put a rag on a
[56:52] tree that's being ringback expect the
[56:54] life to come forth and it lives it will
[56:55] die it means it's the same thing if we
[56:58] take away what we believe and replace it
[57:01] by a man-made way that's why we can't
[57:03] have a culture in this message we can't
[57:06] have a human Kiwi culture you're
[57:07] whatever culture it is others how much
[57:09] yeah this how my parents were it doesn't
[57:11] mean it's right I mean doesn't mean it
[57:14] was wrong either but doesn't mean it's
[57:15] right you got to go back say Lord how
[57:17] should it be I mean that's you know
[57:19] there's a reason why a whole generation
[57:21] is gone I mean so we don't want to we
[57:25] don't want to take doctrine that's
[57:27] man-made it's just like a rag around us
[57:29] and life can't come forth you following
[57:32] me I mean we don't want to be that way
[57:36] Peter would come to a place because of
[57:41] his
[57:41] internal nature he says Lord I'll die
[57:44] with you amen jesus said you're gonna
[57:50] forsake me he says no I'm ready to go to
[57:51] death with you that was his own pride
[57:53] those as I will there was his own
[57:55] ambition I mean his own carnal nature
[57:58] actually rejected what the word said he
[58:01] would do imagine that imagine that
[58:04] here's Peter the Lord speaking to him yo
[58:06] Jesus says to his disciples you're gonna
[58:08] forsake me this night and Peter said to
[58:11] him I won't I'm going to die with you
[58:12] and the word himself looked at him
[58:14] straight in the eye said before the
[58:16] crows three times you will and he didn't
[58:19] say forgive me Lord
[58:20] I'm wrong don't leave this happen he
[58:23] defiantly said with his heart I will not
[58:26] what was that I will that was carnal
[58:32] full of nature saying no you're wrong
[58:35] you're the Christ but you're wrong think
[58:40] about it his own carnal nature was
[58:44] actually Antichrist God knows how to get
[58:48] people on the ash heap you know what
[58:51] happened to Peter here to die to that
[58:53] amen there's an Ephesians 5 and 17
[58:57] wherefore be not unwise but
[58:59] understanding what the will of God will
[59:01] of the Lord is and be not drunk with
[59:03] wine wherein is excess but be filled
[59:05] with the spirit now this would and wise
[59:08] in the stronger that means properly
[59:11] mindless ie stupid by implication
[59:14] ignorant or especially egotistic now
[59:17] egotistic means a self-centered person
[59:19] so it says wherefore be not
[59:22] self-centered be not unwise be not
[59:25] self-centered I mean but understanding
[59:28] what the will of the Lord is you say
[59:30] well how can someone become a
[59:33] self-centered Christian because remember
[59:34] we're here for one another I'm not here
[59:37] for myself I mean no part of the body is
[59:40] for itself it's always for something
[59:42] else right so how can someone become a
[59:45] self-centered Christian because of pain
[59:47] because of hurt because of rejection
[59:49] because of complexes amen all those
[59:53] things bad experiences
[59:55] what happens is why because when you
[59:56] first meet the Lord you want everyone
[59:58] else to meet them and then you get rid
[59:59] you know then you get rejected a few
[1:00:01] hundred times and then it begins to wear
[1:00:03] you down a little bit
[1:00:05] Wow when I first met the Lord I thought
[1:00:07] now everyone's gonna believe because
[1:00:09] he's alive
[1:00:09] everyone just has to hallelujah he's
[1:00:13] alive today and then after about the
[1:00:15] 20th person up against the door on you
[1:00:17] maybe not everyone will but God has his
[1:00:20] children now what am I gonna do now am I
[1:00:24] just gonna say well I guess that's it
[1:00:25] and that's me and here we are am I gonna
[1:00:28] let that become a complex right actually
[1:00:30] just become self sin it's all about me
[1:00:31] I've got to become like the word I'm
[1:00:33] gonna become like you Jesus help me to
[1:00:34] do it it's all self-centered or am I
[1:00:37] gonna actually let the Lord overcome
[1:00:38] that I mean I still have the same heart
[1:00:41] everyone's got to believe it because
[1:00:42] he's a life hallelujah see so what
[1:00:47] happens is we people withdraw within
[1:00:49] themselves where once the Lord was there
[1:00:52] all and all from their hearts Elijah
[1:00:56] going into the wilderness while running
[1:00:58] from Jezebel is the classic example of
[1:01:00] this he was a he was a man of the
[1:01:03] wilderness you'll find people always
[1:01:06] have a default setting there's what I
[1:01:08] call about Elijah being a wilderness man
[1:01:11] that was his default setting he always
[1:01:12] liked the wilderness amen now when he
[1:01:17] ran from Jezebel he ran into the
[1:01:20] wilderness and it wasn't God telling him
[1:01:22] to go your read account God and say now
[1:01:25] flee from the hand of Jezebel and go to
[1:01:27] the mountain of God you know God didn't
[1:01:30] tell him he led himself there his own
[1:01:34] because of the own rejection he had is
[1:01:37] because his own nature led him there
[1:01:40] that's a comfort zone people can use
[1:01:43] this as a comfort zone they can use that
[1:01:45] as a comfort zone they can kick a ball
[1:01:47] around as a comfort zone they can read
[1:01:49] books they can disappear on the internet
[1:01:51] or even just press play and just sit
[1:01:56] back and let them actually control God's
[1:01:58] speaking to them amen you know but all
[1:02:03] it's just actually just a religion and
[1:02:05] it actually becomes a safety zone in a
[1:02:08] bad way because
[1:02:09] they're not effective and actually
[1:02:10] reaching out to people right reaching
[1:02:13] out to the body it's all n-word now amen
[1:02:17] you may not agree with that but people
[1:02:20] do God comes to Elijah on Mount Carmel
[1:02:26] he asked him a question what are you
[1:02:28] doing here
[1:02:28] why are you in this place what dost thou
[1:02:31] here Elijah why are you in the state
[1:02:35] why have you isolated yourself from
[1:02:37] where you mean to be he was meant to be
[1:02:39] in Israel being a prophet a mouthpiece
[1:02:41] mouthpiece to God in Israel he's not an
[1:02:43] Israel he's ran away what's happened
[1:02:46] brother bran became the same way he as I
[1:02:48] always wanted to be a trapper that was
[1:02:51] his default setting I always wanted to
[1:02:54] be a trapper I never wanted to do this
[1:02:56] but God led me and I followed him but
[1:02:59] then because the word open see you can
[1:03:01] be he was brother Brown adopted son of
[1:03:03] God the sword lands in his hand and
[1:03:05] Sabino Canyon amen the word of the Lord
[1:03:09] the sword of the king lands in his hand
[1:03:11] he's come to his adoption he can now
[1:03:13] he's be given the authority go back to
[1:03:14] Jeffersonville the seven seals gonna be
[1:03:16] open the mysteries that have been in the
[1:03:17] Bible are gonna come open to the endtime
[1:03:19] bride and you're gonna be one of the
[1:03:21] ministers it hallelujah and even
[1:03:24] seasoned most sermons he says now
[1:03:25] thousands of my friends gonna leave me
[1:03:27] because of this he knew was going to
[1:03:29] happen but when it happened it hurt and
[1:03:31] then he said well no it because of
[1:03:33] rejection he's standing in the gap who's
[1:03:35] hurt standing in the gap I trust you all
[1:03:37] have a means he says well because the
[1:03:39] reject sees is well I'm just going to go
[1:03:41] up northern British Columbia I'm just
[1:03:42] going to be a trapper I'm gonna be an
[1:03:44] Old Testament prophet if God wants me to
[1:03:45] come down now the worldís I'll stomp out
[1:03:47] the willness say thus saith the Lord
[1:03:49] then go back here was an adopted son of
[1:03:52] God because of rejection withdrew
[1:03:55] himself from the people hears me to
[1:03:57] minister to Amen he wasn't a sinner he
[1:04:01] wasn't a new Christian he was adopted in
[1:04:03] the body
[1:04:04] he was now a dispensational change had
[1:04:07] happened in the church God from church
[1:04:09] ages no the age of the son of man gone
[1:04:11] to the bride age here he was as the as
[1:04:13] the as the breach between the two that
[1:04:17] ministry and he withdrew himself because
[1:04:20] of rejection when
[1:04:22] immune amen so he asked the question why
[1:04:29] what dost thou hear and and Elijah's
[1:04:33] responses because I'm the only one I'm
[1:04:37] the only one who believes you there's no
[1:04:39] one else no one else understands what
[1:04:43] I'm going through no one else can relate
[1:04:46] to me no one else has faced the same
[1:04:48] trail hallelujah Amen why what's
[1:04:53] happened his eyes have gone off the one
[1:04:55] leading him to himself the same problem
[1:04:58] that Lucifer had but just expressed in a
[1:05:00] different way
[1:05:01] you know pride manifests in many
[1:05:02] different forms pride can range from I'm
[1:05:05] I'm awesome to poor me no one helps me
[1:05:09] no one comes to me that that's why a
[1:05:11] pity party that's pride amen because
[1:05:15] it's all look at me just in a different
[1:05:16] way

[1:09:08] what it's like to see hallelujah I know
[1:09:11] what it's like to be you know because
[1:09:13] there's a point
[1:09:14] I remember hearing the message brother
[1:09:16] been preaching on Redemption and
[1:09:17] completeness and enjoy I had no idea
[1:09:19] what there was he talks about people
[1:09:21] with back slit I wasn't even front slit
[1:09:22] I had no idea I was lost and I'm done in

[1:09:29] absolutely lost hallelujah lost as lost
[1:09:33] could be but he found me he found me
[1:09:36] when I heard that messenger say good
[1:09:38] morning or a good evening friends he
[1:09:40] began to speak about Redemption and
[1:09:41] completeness and enjoy hallelujah I
[1:09:43] realized two things or three things one
[1:09:46] I knew I didn't know him the Lord - I
[1:09:50] knew that I didn't know my sins were
[1:09:53] forgiven me and three I knew I didn't
[1:09:55] have the Holy Ghost that's a good place
[1:09:57] to be at least you know you at least you
[1:09:59] know where you are
[1:10:00] hallelujah and if you know you're in
[1:10:02] that estate God's trying to get your
[1:10:03] attention I don't want to leave you in
[1:10:05] that state hallelujah but then when I
[1:10:07] know I knew what it was like to go from
[1:10:09] lost to found I mean from senator st. I
[1:10:12] mean - guilty - sinless I mean forever
[1:10:15] from guilty to forgiving I knew what it
[1:10:17] was like hallelujah to not have the Holy
[1:10:19] Ghost and to have the Holy Ghost
[1:10:21] I knew I was like not to have the mind
[1:10:22] of Christ receiving the mind of Christ
[1:10:24] hallelujah I knew it's like when the
[1:10:26] book was sealed when the book came over
[1:10:28] Helia I knew I was like when the mighty
[1:10:31] angel was there and then he came to me
[1:10:33] hallelujah I know I remember the moment
[1:10:36] in the time I mean where where the word
[1:10:38] came open and the book came open and I
[1:10:41] wasn't listening to a sermon I was just
[1:10:42] reading the scripture I just finished
[1:10:44] talking to my darling wife she I wonder
[1:10:46] about the Seventh Seal I think God just
[1:10:47] opened scripture to me I realize he's
[1:10:50] here

[1:10:54] about horse riders to hearing about the
[1:10:55] lamb take the book hallelujah I knew
[1:10:59] what that was like hallelujah

[1:11:20] heaven that the Apostle Paul won't have
[1:11:22] a lot you won't have hallelujah you know
[1:11:25] what I mean hallelujah he'll be
[1:11:28] worshiping a certain way glory to God
[1:11:30] you know his his walk with God
[1:11:33] his revelation and then we'll comin
[1:11:36] hallelujah what age did you come from
[1:11:38] later see ya glory what happened the
[1:11:41] lamb came hallelujah holy John what John
[1:11:44] would maybe worship a certain way I saw
[1:11:46] the vision of the book of Revelation and
[1:11:48] the wake of alone hallelujah John what

[1:11:52] reality for hallelujah we have never got
[1:11:55] a worship hallelujah glory hallelujah

[1:12:03] hallelujah amen you think about how
[1:12:08] great it'll be but a brim come along

[1:12:26] he saw the world would be in he saw it
[1:12:29] we're living in it hallelujah amen glory
[1:12:34] now brother Brahim sees in the church
[1:12:37] age book I'll be nearly finished they
[1:12:40] didn't say that but I'm just saying that
[1:12:41] now the Satan knows are shortly that the
[1:12:44] original Church at Pentecost I'm glad
[1:12:45] and give me a means with that one with
[1:12:47] the power of God mark mark 16 in action
[1:12:50] is the true church that Jesus claims as
[1:12:52] his own all the houses false it has to
[1:12:55] be now remember this Christ and the true
[1:12:57] church is a continuation of the book of
[1:12:59] Acts but the book of Revelation shows
[1:13:01] how that the Antichrist spirit would
[1:13:03] come into the church and defile it make
[1:13:05] it lukewarm and formal and powerless and
[1:13:08] exposes Satan revealing his works
[1:13:11] attempted destruction of God's people
[1:13:13] and the discrediting of God's words
[1:13:15] right down to the time he is cast
[1:13:17] like a fire he fights that he cannot
[1:13:19] stand it he knows that if the people get
[1:13:22] the true revelation of the true church
[1:13:23] and what she is and what she stands for
[1:13:25] then she can do the greater work she
[1:13:28] will be an invincible army if they get a
[1:13:30] revelation of the two spirits within the
[1:13:32] framework of the Christian Church and by
[1:13:35] God's Spirit discern and withstand the
[1:13:37] Antichrist spirit Satan will be
[1:13:39] powerless before her he will be as
[1:13:41] deftly thoughted today as when Christ
[1:13:43] was stood as every effort to gain power
[1:13:45] over him and the desert yes Satan hates
[1:13:48] revelation but we love it with true
[1:13:50] revelation in our lives the gates of
[1:13:52] Hell could not prevail against us but we
[1:13:55] will prevail over them now many times we
[1:13:59] think of that Antichrist spirit is
[1:14:00] coming in the form of false doctrine
[1:14:02] wrapped up a message quotes yeah amen
[1:14:07] and while that is true the devil just
[1:14:10] does not just come in that way look at
[1:14:13] depression you know I was reading I
[1:14:16] can't remember what what message it is
[1:14:17] but brother Graham says habits of
[1:14:19] spirits habits are spirits so something
[1:14:24] becomes a habit to you you say why do I
[1:14:27] keep going back to that thing the
[1:14:28] spurred driving you look at depression
[1:14:37] its inward looking pain nursing nature
[1:14:41] what makes a person that way it was a
[1:14:44] wound or a bruise in their spirit and
[1:14:46] the devil comes in and afflicts them
[1:14:48] amen that's what depression is and you
[1:14:50] can range the pressure can be extreme a
[1:14:52] very mild or what is that inward looking
[1:14:55] this is how the Antichrist spirit comes
[1:14:57] into filing the church making it formal
[1:14:59] lukewarm and powerless not just with
[1:15:01] false doctrine wrapped up a message
[1:15:03] quotes it's more saddled The Devil's
[1:15:05] spot you know I've given one thing he's
[1:15:07] he's cunning he's clever he's not dumb
[1:15:11] amen he's clever but with the mind of
[1:15:15] Christ we can discern and withstand
[1:15:18] hallelujah see or see look inward
[1:15:23] looking people whatever the devil's got
[1:15:25] them to take their eyes off the Lord and
[1:15:27] upon themselves I mean you say well I
[1:15:29] don't know you say well you don't know
[1:15:31] what
[1:15:31] I've been through my Lord Jesus does
[1:15:33] amen he knows what it's like to be
[1:15:36] rejected he knows what to be tempted on
[1:15:38] all points here without sin he was
[1:15:40] tempted on all points sexual sin
[1:15:42] everything he took my sin up Calvary he
[1:15:47] bore my son he was you know he went to
[1:15:51] hell in my place he died a sinner when
[1:15:55] he was there between heavens and earth
[1:15:57] on the cross saying my god my god was
[1:15:58] our for sake and me he wasn't just
[1:16:00] saying some words being a robot he was
[1:16:03] crying out why have you forsaken me
[1:16:05] hallelujah a me see is that what caused
[1:16:12] the hurt no it's how the hurt has
[1:16:14] treated you take a person who's been
[1:16:17] physically wounded and that person you
[1:16:21] know you take a big wound if you
[1:16:23] physically keep ripping open a wound is
[1:16:25] it gonna get well you take someone who
[1:16:28] goes into a A&E and they try and rip
[1:16:29] tubes out of themselves and different
[1:16:31] things that person is not in their right
[1:16:32] mind in the hospital something's wrong
[1:16:35] with that person now you take that from
[1:16:37] the physical and you take it into the
[1:16:39] spiritual and people ripping IV lines
[1:16:41] out of themselves and tubes you know
[1:16:43] guys trying to patch us up and heal us
[1:16:45] and make us better but you want to rip
[1:16:46] open the wound and bring those memories
[1:16:48] back and relive it all the time and
[1:16:49] what's happening people are ripping
[1:16:51] bandages off and pulling out IV lines
[1:16:53] spiritual ones what's wrong the devil
[1:16:56] sang rip it out you don't want that you
[1:16:58] know I look at that thing oh yeah it's
[1:17:00] all you because he doesn't want you to
[1:17:02] be well sometimes the Lord heals like
[1:17:04] this sometimes it takes time because
[1:17:08] he's faith worketh patience amen
[1:17:12] see we don't want to sure we get wounded
[1:17:17] we all been wounded
[1:17:19] Amen but there's a healing balm present
[1:17:22] there is a balm in Gilead I mean there
[1:17:25] is a healing place and many times it
[1:17:27] just starts the healing process but we
[1:17:30] have to overcome brother Graham said
[1:17:33] that God doesn't just force us through a
[1:17:34] pipe and then we're overcoming you have
[1:17:37] to choose to overcome you have to make
[1:17:40] the choice I'm getting lured by you I'm
[1:17:42] gonna overcome this enemy by you I'm
[1:17:44] going to overcome my
[1:17:45] flesh hallelujah amen hallelujah see as
[1:17:52] long as you keep in your heart see this
[1:17:57] that's a healing process and you've got
[1:17:59] to overcome but as long as you keep in
[1:18:00] your heart that there was a time when
[1:18:02] nothing matter but walking with him
[1:18:03] loving him when you never noticed your
[1:18:06] kid about any fusses around you you just
[1:18:07] get caught up in him it's such a joy to
[1:18:09] walk with him amen
[1:18:11] if you stay on that spot you got to go
[1:18:13] back to when you meet him the devil
[1:18:15] always uses bad memories against you why
[1:18:18] don't you use good memories against him
[1:18:20] hallelujah even when he's yeah well he
[1:18:22] touched me once go back to that once he
[1:18:25] called me once go back to the ones He
[1:18:28] healed me once go back to the ones
[1:18:30] hallelujah you know that's the thing no
[1:18:34] trauma affects us more than just
[1:18:37] physically I had a I to great-uncle my
[1:18:41] my my parents grant my parents are my
[1:18:44] mom's parents and my mum's uncle lived
[1:18:47] next to us growing up and my great uncle
[1:18:50] uncle Ted he fought in North Africa he
[1:18:53] was at Battle of Alamein he fought all
[1:18:55] the way through Italy and I'm about to
[1:18:57] cross up and to Germany wherever but
[1:18:59] then they demobilized he fought at Monte
[1:19:02] Cassino fine you know a lot of these
[1:19:04] names don't mean anything to he fought
[1:19:05] great horrific battles and he lived till
[1:19:09] he was 90 after World War two
[1:19:13] many times he'd wake up screaming
[1:19:16] because of the trauma that he suffered
[1:19:19] in battle it was one you know a few
[1:19:23] years he was 19 years old
[1:19:25] a few of those years he was fighting in
[1:19:27] World War two and those moments affected
[1:19:30] him for the rest of his life even though
[1:19:32] he wasn't in the battlefield anymore he
[1:19:34] was in New Zealand he wasn't in North
[1:19:36] Africa or Italy where ever he was he was
[1:19:38] back in New Zealand he was a shepherd
[1:19:39] then he retired you know he wasn't on
[1:19:42] the battlefield anymore but those
[1:19:44] experiences gave him deep trauma in his
[1:19:46] life and when he went to sleep it would
[1:19:49] come back up again and that can happen
[1:19:51] many times it's never the actual
[1:19:53] incident that affects us
[1:19:55] it's the trauma that comes because of it
[1:19:59] Amen who's been there many times at the
[1:20:01] moment it doesn't seem that bad but then
[1:20:02] you go away it gets real big right
[1:20:05] what's heaven trauma comes in you don't
[1:20:07] even maybe realize you're packing it but
[1:20:08] it's there they meant now as a Christian
[1:20:12] I sadly I don't know what kind of state
[1:20:14] he was in you know when he when he
[1:20:17] passed away and I don't know if you had
[1:20:18] any kind of faith but I'll say this we
[1:20:21] don't have to live with trauma affecting
[1:20:24] us every day we do not have to live with
[1:20:27] trauma you know make us that we can't
[1:20:29] sleep at night or to fix our life there
[1:20:32] is a healing in this place Amen
[1:20:35] hallelujah whit bill I'm built exactly
[1:20:38] the same way my uncle was built my
[1:20:39] great-uncle right if I went through that
[1:20:41] I would have had the same things but
[1:20:43] there's a healing balm in Gilead right
[1:20:45] here in the Lord Jesus Christ where
[1:20:47] trauma doesn't need to affect us anymore
[1:20:51] hallelujah amen but depends you have to
[1:21:01] make a you have to make a choice will he
[1:21:05] let those things big be a garrison that
[1:21:09] the devil can use or we use it as a city
[1:21:11] of refuge for others there are six
[1:21:14] cities of refuge and the promised land
[1:21:16] the seventh is Christ right many of
[1:21:19] those places were actually enemy cities
[1:21:21] in those reliance winningly they took it
[1:21:24] and became a city of refuge but the
[1:21:25] devil put something in your spirit and
[1:21:27] the devil use it as a door and to the
[1:21:29] rescue to invade what's it an enemy
[1:21:31] garrison pull down the strongholds the
[1:21:33] scripture says so it becomes an enemy
[1:21:35] garrison right but then God can come and
[1:21:37] bring healing kick the devil out and
[1:21:39] then that same experience now you could
[1:21:42] actually use that when someone else has
[1:21:43] the same problem and you can enter into
[1:21:45] their burden and really pray I mean you
[1:21:49] know people can go through things in
[1:21:50] life and I can sympathize but if I've
[1:21:53] been in their shoes amen
[1:21:55] I can really enter into their need a
[1:21:57] mess just like you have children
[1:21:59] children come up they're sick you can
[1:22:01] enter into that prayer because you've
[1:22:03] got kids yourself right or anything else
[1:22:06] you've been through in life God can use
[1:22:07] it
[1:22:08] brother Bram said about you know Sharon
[1:22:10] Rose she's their little baby she's dying
[1:22:11] her eyes
[1:22:13] crossed over in pain and then he said
[1:22:16] hundreds of cross-eyed bate children
[1:22:18] came over the platform and not one of
[1:22:20] them left with cross-ice and he said the
[1:22:22] people never knew what cost them in
[1:22:25] order that that would happen because he
[1:22:28] saw it in his baby he now had a burden I
[1:22:30] don't want to see that ever again
[1:22:33] then cross our children come across he
[1:22:35] could enter into the burden of that
[1:22:36] child because he's seen it before and
[1:22:39] you always hear him you know when he
[1:22:41] said about the boy in Finland or or
[1:22:43] other children that it did he begin to
[1:22:44] think about his own children back home
[1:22:45] what if that was a little Billy Paul or
[1:22:47] Joseph or whoever it was he enters under
[1:22:50] that burden because he knows what it's
[1:22:51] like because he's got children what
[1:22:53] happened it became a City of Refuge God
[1:22:56] stepped on the scene brought brought
[1:22:58] mighty deliverance amen hallelujah so it
[1:23:04] depends what you want to do now he sees
[1:23:08] here in El Shaddai and I'll just close
[1:23:10] with this
[1:23:10] he says Lazarus no no I'll read this
[1:23:14] from Luke 4 actually first he sees the
[1:23:15] spirit so Jesus found in the and the
[1:23:18] scroll of Isaiah the prophecy to spread
[1:23:21] laws upon me because he's anointed me to
[1:23:23] preach the gospel to the poor he has
[1:23:25] sent me to heal the brokenhearted to
[1:23:27] preach deliverance to the captives and
[1:23:29] the recovering of sight to the blind to
[1:23:30] set at liberty them that are bruised
[1:23:32] that is all about spiritual healing
[1:23:36] brokenhearted yeah amen healing of the
[1:23:42] brokenhearted preach deliverance to the
[1:23:43] captives we know that's just not
[1:23:45] physical captivity you can be captive by
[1:23:47] a memory right recovering other sides of
[1:23:50] the blind people get clouded over with
[1:23:52] complexes looking through pain all the
[1:23:54] time they're not looking right right
[1:23:56] they're not seeing things what they are
[1:23:57] you can be healed from that blindness
[1:23:59] and set at liberty them that are bruised
[1:24:01] that anointing is here I mean that
[1:24:05] anointing is not just here on a Whizzer
[1:24:06] or Sunday that anointing should be with
[1:24:08] you hallelujah because the same God that
[1:24:13] was there as present amen to preach the
[1:24:17] acceptable year of the Lord and he
[1:24:19] closed the book he gave it again to the
[1:24:20] minister sat down and the eyes of all
[1:24:22] them were in the synagogue were faster
[1:24:24] on them if we're going to send them this
[1:24:25] day the scriptures
[1:24:27] in your ears brother have see the rest
[1:24:29] of the pod that book I prophesy was as
[1:24:31] fulfilled today but it continues on from
[1:24:33] this so if this is the case we don't
[1:24:39] need to worship her own selves Lucifer's
[1:24:43] I will doesn't have to be your will amen
[1:24:48] it's up to what you want to do he says
[1:24:51] now shadow I Lazarus died that's true he
[1:24:53] rose again he lived a normal life for
[1:24:55] many many years because the resurrection
[1:24:56] Jesus gave him and then course he died
[1:24:59] again because he will come forth in the
[1:25:01] resurrection Jesus says he had come
[1:25:03] forth in the resurrection but he has to
[1:25:04] go rest like all human thing are human
[1:25:08] beings but until that time comes let's
[1:25:10] not be cheated out of life for service
[1:25:13] for God because it's Satan's business to
[1:25:15] cheat you out of it you know God wants
[1:25:18] us to be happy
[1:25:19] God wants us to be at peace God wants us
[1:25:22] to rest amen
[1:25:24] now that doesn't mean that an addictive
[1:25:26] watch the world go by chorus but he
[1:25:27] wants us to be happy in life I mean it's
[1:25:30] not all about being all you know serious
[1:25:33] and I mean you know you can be at rest
[1:25:35] and be serious but I mean all like
[1:25:37] twisted up at analyzing things and
[1:25:39] seeing what's going on and you know
[1:25:41] discernment is not you working out life
[1:25:43] the Sermon is God coming on the scene
[1:25:45] and saying that's that that's that
[1:25:46] that's not you trying to work it out
[1:25:47] that's just human critique and it
[1:25:50] doesn't work but God wants us to be
[1:25:53] happy you mean God wants you to be happy
[1:25:55] of course he wants you to be happy oh
[1:25:57] but we're walking there more on this
[1:25:59] than the other narrow way and all these
[1:26:01] things yeah but if he's your Shepherd
[1:26:03] I've seen sheep the distressed I've seen
[1:26:07] sheep that are not stressed talking the
[1:26:09] natural now a man he used to go with my

[1:26:20] know anyway it's very windy but I know
[1:26:23] what sheep alike they just wandering
[1:26:25] along eating grass everything's fine I
[1:26:27] know what sheep alike when they're
[1:26:28] stressed God wants us to be happy he
[1:26:32] wants us every day to enjoy everyday
[1:26:34] life to enjoy our family enjoy one
[1:26:37] another amen that's
[1:26:40] he wants us to be happy not to be all
[1:26:42] stressed and worried and how's
[1:26:43] everything going to work out cast all
[1:26:45] your cares upon him because he cares for
[1:26:47] you what do you love

[1:26:53] friends you say but this happened to me
