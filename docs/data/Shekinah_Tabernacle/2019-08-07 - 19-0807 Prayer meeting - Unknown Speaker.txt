chapter 16 we're gonna read from from verse 16 of x16 X chapter 16 verse 16 that came to pass and it came to pass as we went to prayer are certain damsels to speaking about Paul and Silas as we went to prayer a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of the divination met us which brought her masters much gained by sue saying the same followed Paul and us and cried saying these men are the servants of the Most High God which show unto us the way of salvation and this thirty many days but Paul being grief turned and said to the spirit I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her and he went out the same hour and when her master saw that the hope of their gains was gone they caught Paul and Silas and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers and brought them to the magistrates saying these men being Jews do exceedingly trouble our city and teach customs which are not lawful for us to receive neither to observe being Romans and the multitude rose up together against them and the magistrates rent off their clothes and commanded to beat them and when they had laid many stripes upon them they cast him into prison charging the jailer to keep them safely who having received such a charge thrust them into the inner prison and made their feet fast in the stocks and at midnight Paul and Silas prayed and sang praises unto God and the prisoners heard them and suddenly there was a great earthquake so that the foundations of the prison were shaken and immediately notice now all the doors were opened and everyone's bands were loosed amen this bow heads in a word of Prayer gracious father thank you we can take every burden to you and prayer thank you we can see it our wings to the winds of faith thank you Lord you are the same yesterday today and forever and dear God just pray fathers we have this prayer service Lord may you come and take control Lord we are failures to begin with but Lord with you all things are possible father you're more than a conqueror Lord Lord and I just pray father you just come and take control of the service media every need hear those Lord who may be streaming in as well father's want to commit our lives into your hands may you forgive us of our sins our trespasses Lord our iniquities dear God and maybe just be all covered in your blood this night grant it father and not just tonight but Lord every day until we take a body change granted in Jesus Christ's name we ask amen amen god bless you friends you may have your seat so I want to talk about here where notice how Paul and Silas you know they they came to a point where they are in prison and many of us find ourselves in places where we don't want to be where they were once your they were having great great campaign and you know they just seen a demon cast out of a girl that was bound by it and you know the response they got wasn't exactly the one maybe they are looking for they ended up in prison and you know and and in the inner prison they're feeding stocks they're just being beaten you know and and we know that many times the world Lee yo we end up in a prison we end up in a prison of circumstance we ended up a prison in our mind with a mind battle law you know the devil just comes against us or her and humanity comes against us or something comes against us we find ourselves in a prison but notice that you know Paul and Silas they look beyond their physical circumstance and they prayed and sang praise under God and the result of us we know was the earthquake and all the doors were open and everyone's bands were loosed Oh No how powerful a believer is where we can go beyond our current state our physical state and we can begin to worship and pray and give praises to our God and it not only sets us free but it can set free everyone that's around us hallelujah brother Branham says in the sermon love he says now I want you to ask you something let's let our colors down just a minute did you ever see a person that's a good person you think they are nice but they're just something about the person you just don't like to be around them certainly you do and then you've seen people you just love to be around what is it it's that creative power that's upon the people that creates an atmosphere around them where they're at if they're full of love not make-belief but real love you can feel it you know that they're Christians they shake their hand they say you're my friend John you can feel it I mean because all of us have an atmosphere around us it can either be a very good atmosphere a very bad atmosphere everyone creates an atmosphere I mean we are miniature gods upon the earth it doesn't matter if you're saved or not saved amen but you know you know all of us create an atmosphere so it depends what kind of atmosphere you want to create and I'll say to create an atmosphere it's not turning over a new leaf it's not seven steps to become a better Christian but it's a life and you produces an atmosphere I mean so it's not something you can do in your own ability I mean but it's God's life and you will create the atmosphere or a spirit will create an atmosphere we all create an atmosphere I mean he says he says in the same sermon love he says he no different I believe in heartfelt religion I believe you can feel it that God gives you something inside of you that changes you it makes the atmosphere around you different I've tried it I know is it true that man created himself the atmosphere that he lives in and around you he's anointed with a spirit and I've seen people that you just couldn't get away from him you just loved him there's something drawing about them it's because they live in that atmosphere they live under the power of the Holy Ghost I mean so this so as yo so as I see there's a massive difference between trying to do better and crane atmosphere and really dying out and letting God coming in and creating atmosphere around you it's not mind over matter Amen brother Brahim speaks about the token he says apply it create that atmosphere around you that they'll just drop right into it see oh you are you are if you've got the token you create a spirit around you a power that when you walk people know that you're a Christian they love for you to say something to them they believe your word what you say they hold on to let's see that's it apply the token then walk with it claim your household you must do it now it's the evening time now we've been listening a long time but this is the evening time it's the applying time now the wrath will strike one of these days it might be too late then apply the token with confidence he says so he's saying here that the the token if you have the Holy Ghost there's a spirit there's a power around you I mean there's an atmosphere that is created by the life of God himself now here we have two two believers here in a prison there's other people in the prison maybe they brought before the same magistrates maybe they had the same experience in life you know they went to the same judgment hall you know there's nothing that happens to us which is common or uncommon to man the same thing has happened to us the same thing here things happen to the people in the world you know because we're all humans are the same presence I mean that anyone can end up and we can end up in as well you know the circumstance of life but it's up to you but the thing is the believer is different because the believer does not succumb amen to the prison that they're in the circumstance around but there's something in and that knows this is not my final destination I mean the Apostle Paul knew that prison was not his final destination he the angel of God came to him and said Paul you're going to be a witness to me in Rome hallelujah so when Paul was in that prison he knew this is not where that that was not his final resting place he knew he had to go to Rome hallelujah and it's the same thing with us friends yo God God met the Apostle Paul I'm in the same God that meet him on the road to Damascus was the same God that says you're gonna be a witness to be in Rome I trusted the same God that met you whenever it was as the same God that walks with you and the same God that told you you're going to take a body change you're going to go in a rapture I'm in your final destination friends is not the current state you find yourself an this is not your final resting place I mean but you have a predestinated moment I mean where your body's going to be changed hallelujah but I trust that that is more real I mean then your current prison you find yourself in hallelujah cause Paul realized nah I'm under a commission I'm going to be a witness in Rome I mean so therefore he could praise God hallelujah he could give glory Lord thank you you brought me to this place there's a reason you brought me here Lord hallelujah yeah it says that they prayed and they sing and they and they sing songs hallelujah they prayed and saying praises unto God now you know maybe maybe they saying Psalm 18 rude saying my distress I called upon the Lord and cried unto my god he heard my voice out of his temple and my cry came before him even unto his ears in the earth shook and trembled the foundations also of the hills moved and was shaken because he was wroth or maybe they were singing Psalms 104 31 the glory I'm challenged or forever the Lord shall rejoice and his works he looketh on the earth and it trembler he touches the hills and they smoke I will sing unto the Lord as long as I live I will sing praise to my god while I have my being my meditation of him shall be sweet I will be glad in the Lord hallelujah maybe they begin to sing those things I don't know but they begin to praise they begin to realize this is not their final resting place and I trust it's the same thing with you I mean that you can you know yeah there should be something anchored in your soul your current trial that urine hallelujah they are in the inner prison there their feet were in stocks they fill felt the effects of the beatings and the whippings amen that salt was very real still hallelujah but something in them said I'm not going to end up here and they begin to praise God and sing and pray unto Him and God came down and shook the place but not only loose them but loose everyone around them I mean that's why we haven't there's a power in the believer I mean to bring deliverance hallelujah that when we really worship God I mean when we enter into that channel and give them praise because I have eternal life it should give me something to be happy about I mean delivered from the jaws of the devil I mean God has revealed this message to me hallelujah I mean I'm on a rapture highway hallelujah holy isn't he good they mean so you know you know that's something to praise him for thank you for finding me seven billion whatever people on the earth and we're on the back into the world here and God finds me hallelujah isn't that wonderful power and they begin to praise and see that's why we got to recognize his power and praise I mean so it doesn't matter how you feeling when you walk in those doors you got to put that to one side you've got to put that to one side and praise You God I mean because your salvation isn't you know this salvation wasn't based on how they are feeling I mean they're their salvation wasn't based on the beatings that they had received I mean they were rejoicing because they had met God and that's what made the difference they met the God of the Bible hallelujah and they begin to rejoice amen and it didn't just lose them but it loose to all them around just imagine I mean that that any one of us could walk in these doors and we could have a revival in our seat hallelujah and maybe others maybe had the worst week they've ever had in their lives but God comes down through your worship and looses their bands as well holy and we all go free out of this place hallelujah at work there you know the others didn't have a clue who are these people talking about of Jesus who are these crazy fanatics you know but they saw the power and effect of their worship and they felt the power and effect of their worship maybe they'd been in maybe some of them been in cells many days they never heard this kind of cry out of a cell hallelujah never never felt an earthquake and all the doors and everything be loosed Amen so it's the same thing with us it's great power you carry a great power but you got to put it in action say Oh God Here I am you shed your blood upon the earth for me I am redeemed you've taken the book hallelujah hallelujah I know and whom I have believed I don't believe in a figment of my imagination but you're a true and living God and you make me make yourself real to me and Here I am my final destination is not this trough we've got to go beyond our mind metals I mean we're going to change God change my thinking many times we get stuck in a dungeon in our mind and we're just going around the same cycle of Oh your negative thoughts and negative history and negative things God's going to break that you say Lord why am I thinking this way hallelujah amen the Lord said they that keep their mind stayed on him will have perfect peace amen so if your mind is full of trouble I'll guarantee you one thing your mind is probably not stuck on the Lord but this is if your mind erste don't hum you have perfect peace hallelujah so you know why do we keep a prison in our mind when we break that cycle what do we break that cycle well you say well I wasn't there when Paul and Silas was you know there and everything was loosed a mean but the same God is present we know the same one here I mean why don't we just begin to praise them irrespective of how we are irrespective of how we're feeling irrespective of what we're going through what we may face tomorrow why not hallelujah there's a challenge I mean well I'm feeling pretty awful they felt pretty awful I'm having a bad day they had a real bad day hallelujah but God said to Paul no you have to be a witness in row so he thought no God told me to be a witness from I can't say and this prison I'm gonna get out holy just begin to praise God maybe didn't even know what was going to happen doesn't matter just think God come down use your worship to touch others hallelujah amen I'm gonna leave it there my friends that's what we can do have you ever seen someone rejoice in church it just spreads like a wildfire hallelujah and then and then those half spiritual just think man I wish I had what they were having hallelujah and then they find the bottle we passed them they begin to rejoice ain't mean white because it's white because as a power comes down through that worship and it begins to loose the bands of the people yeah hallelujah amen we've seen it happen I say Lord let's see it more I mean this go beyond because what the devil wants us to be in a dungeon he wants to keep us in an inner prison dark and gloomy and dampen rats running around in cockroaches and you know what evermore stuck in it in a prison he wants us to be like that amen and he try and put us there amen and he even may put us there but that doesn't mean we're meant to stay there what are you gonna do hallelujah he just got to go through the process maybe you know naturally think while they go before the magistrate then they get sentenced and there's the ex why did ammount of time and finally sentencing and you know whatever they didn't go through that process they begin to praise God hallelujah he interrupted the process amen amen so let's let's worship the Lord hallelujah amen now we've got a few prayer requests I'm gonna read them out so we want to pray for sister chantell's grandfather who had an operation on the 25th already and is still in hospital for physical healing as well as the Lord to uplift his spirits as at this point he that doesn't seem
