testimony just had that keep coming up on my mind so someone here's got something burning on their heart a testimony so i'm opening the floor don't be afraid if the lord's done something for you and you want to share it please sounds good morning signs i'll come forward so you don't have to go back thank you brother andy god bless you um it's actually sister londy's fault so about a year or two sister london you had that very horrible feeling come over you when you were sick you were really really sick and you still made it into church you really were sick we could see it there was no faking it and i remember sister londy coming into church and she was all red and her hands were oh you just were in a terrible state i can't even remember what was wrong but you knew she wasn't feeling very well and last night i was not feeling very well at all to be honest i was really sick i didn't feel good so this morning i woke up and the only thought that's in my head is she came she got blessed she received the healing and she moved on with god so um yeah i went back to sleep i was thinking so i said to shinto just give me five more minutes i just want to get everything together so i can get the courage to stand up because i felt really bad and we get dressed and you feel a little bit better and then satan comes and says no you're not and you go oh man and then everybody asks you are you feeling better and everything in your ghost oh and then god goes yes because it's his promise the only thought that carried me is if it worked for one christian only one if it worked for one it will work for me but sometimes we forget to look at him we always look at us so i feel much better praise the lord my headache is left hallelujah and we're going to praise the lord today so if you do feel sick or you feel tired don't look at you look at him but it takes one it takes one christian one experience with god that you see and that sits all in action so if you feel like contrary to what you have to be here today look at the one that doesn't feel that way look at the one that holds on to the promise and that's him you'll feel much better and you leave least but yeah if i go from scale one to ten i was about a three but i'm feeling about a ten right now so let's praise and worship the lord amen [Applause] as ottoman just said it only takes one and it just took him to remind me um last night i woke up in the middle of night feeling terrible as well and satan must have really been battling um and i was lying in bed feeling horrible um waking up heaps and i was just like man lord i just want to come to church tomorrow there's a youth service i just want to be here i don't want to stream and i woke up this morning feeling great so praise the lord that i can be here [Applause] amen amen hallelujah if there's anyone else amen hey man let's continue i bless your name let's stand let's prepare our hearts amen for the word we slow it down see in prisoners [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] and they were free [Music] i bless you i give you [Music] praise you are [Music] i bless your name i bless your names [Music] in your and they will in jesus [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] your god i bless your name [Music] [Applause] [Music] god [Music] just between you and him can't [Music] god [Music] [Music] hallelujah [Music] [Music] rise [Music] father you are [Music] and i will be still and all you are [Music] my soul in christ [Music] is [Music] father you are [Music] when the ocean is [Music] i [Music] i will be [Music] hallelujah as we brother isaac prepares [Music] hallelujah [Music] oh [Music] name [Music] he is [Music] [Music] he is [Applause] [Music] you will never be the same he is here [Music] oh [Music] hear him [Music] let's pray this morning heavenly father we know that you see where two or three are gathered together in your name you are in the midst lord and we recognize and we have a confidence lord that you desire to have fellowship with us lord and that you look forward to meeting us lord and when we make the effort lord to to come and desire to meet you lord it makes you feel good when we hear brother adamant that he says no i want to go and meet god amen lord that that that makes you feel constrained lord where you can't wait to for the doors to open lord to for the brethren to arrive to meet you and have fellowship lord say we believe you're here this morning lord and that you desire to have fellowship with us we thank you lord for forgiving us of every sin lord that that we could come boldly before your throne of grace father that that we could claim every redemptive blessing that you have for us this morning lord and we're we're happy in your presence lord we can feel you here so we just want to pray you will continue to bless the service bless those that are streaming bless um pastor ben and his family as they're overseas may give them a good trip may they have a good time my brother ben have a powerful time of ministry but also may they have a great time as a family lord just on the the other activities they do may just bless their trip on every part of it lord may it all be blessed and just bless us here this morning we pray and just commit the service to your hands in jesus name amen praise the lord well you're standing thank you very much musicians um while you're standing let's turn to numbers 33 verse 50. how you all feeling this morning that's good you're feeling a 10 like brother armand amen 11 out of 10. amen um numbers 33 50 says and the lord spake unto moses and the plains of moab by jordan near jericho saying speak unto the children of israel and say unto them when ye are passed over jordan into the land of canaan then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you and destroy their pictures and destroy the molten images and quite pluck down all the high places and you shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land and dwell therein for i have given you the land to possess it and you shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families and to the more you shall give the more inheritance and to the fewer you shall give the less inheritance every man's inheritance shall be in the place where his lot falleth according to the tribes of your fathers you shall inherit but if you will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you then it shall come to pass that those which ye let remain of them shall be pricks in your eyes and thorns in your sides and shall vex you in the land wherein you dwell moreover it shall come to pass that i shall do unto you as i thought to do unto them may god bless you can have your seats this morning if you remember anything that i'm going to speak to you about this morning remember these words from jordan to the sea from jordan to the sea when you go away this week when you're in a trial when you're in anything think from jordan to the sea i didn't tell hannah this but she was um they were doing a quiet singing time after a service i think about two weeks ago and hannah started singing a song real slow we are able to go up and take the country and then unusually slow way but it was really nice and then she got to that line to possess the land from jordan to the sea and if you minister or just get thoughts from the lord you know we know sometimes a little word will come and you think from jordan to the sea i like that you know it sounds it sounds like it's a certain area and it sounds like a challenge from jordan to the sea we like to have goal posts and things we can look to and think i'll go and do that i'll do this so we like to have focus you know and when i heard of the words from jordan to the sea i thought that gives me some sort of focus there's something in there to try and capture so i'm going to go pretty fast this morning is that okay okay because once again i believe i'm looking at very intelligent people put your hand up if you're intelligent everyone put your hand up hey you're all fearfully and wonderfully made you're very intelligent the way your body works you realize there's millions of things happening in your body at the moment millions your body is just doing all sorts of stuff that we can't even comprehend you're very very intelligent you're the finest creation of god once he finished everything he made man and he said it's very good he's very proud of his creation don't ever downplay yourself you're very intelligent so intelligent that god came down and died for us so great i don't want to i know god's great but you know he thinks the same of us he thinks we're actually great and he wants to come fellowship with us i know we're believers and we're not it's not going to get to our head but we can appreciate it in the spirit that it's given when david said i'm fearfully and wonderfully made he wasn't bragging he was appreciating god i'm fearfully and wonderfully made because of what you've done amen okay so here we have this piece of land in the middle east you've got iraq and iran and maybe egypt modern times what they call them different names but we have this patch of land here and abram was in a place over near iraq he was over there and god visited abram one day and he said now the lord god now the lord had said unto abraham get the out of thy country and from thy kindred and from thy father's house unto a land that i will show thee so he gets some what you would call a promise god says abram leave here and you're going to bring over to another land so there's this idea from god and over time things happen and lots um a lot was with abram and then their herdsmen started to have strife and so they decided to part ways but after they did the lord said again to abraham and the lord said unto abram after that lot was separated from him lift up now thine eyes and look from the place where thou art look northward look south look east and look west look around you for the land which thou seest to thee will i give it thee and to thy seed forever to me that sounds like a promise look around you i'm going to give all this to you that's called a promise and to thee and i see forever we like to make promises and we think we're pretty good at keeping our world we say look i'll give you this i'll give you that i'll do this you know most of the time we try and do it sometimes we can't keep our promises because situations change we're like oh no i can't keep my promise you know we've got to walk back in our word and say look i know i said i was going to give you that i can't you know this has happened that's happened but god's promises aren't like that he's planned it all out and if he says he's going to give it to him forever that means if you look at it today they should still have it amen i believe they do because god is an eternal god he doesn't just he time doesn't go by and he realizes whoops that promise i told abraham a while ago i can't really keep that anymore because i didn't realize the enemy was going to be too strong and you guys were going to get taken out and then now i can't give it to you it's an eternal promise when god makes a promise it's forever the same as it is with us we have eternal promises that are in existence forever they don't go away there forever so that's why now you have this concept or this thought who's heard of the promised land and that's based on the fact that it was given by a promise not a promise from some man that said i'll give it to you i will bequeath this land to you like we have these little um reserves you know that a wealthy family says i'll give this reserve to the the people of this town you know and they they'll go to the council and say i'll give you this plot of land you can and then but name it after me make sure you name it after me so people know i gave it you know and you know and i'll give it to you and it's the people's forever well there's probably a lot of those reserves out of that not the people's anymore you know because new governments come and change things do this do that and they don't care about that that land that was bequeathed you know but not this land this is called the promised land because it's based on an eternal promise from god and it just happened to be that little area there there was a lot of other land around this wasn't the only plot of land in the world it was just that area of land there that was where the promise was amen it wasn't over near iraq although there was nothing wrong with iraq or it wasn't further north maybe up around greece or somewhere or rome or you could go south maybe down into africa there's nothing wrong there's places it just wasn't there god just decided here that was it god just decides things and that's just the way that it is it's there you can't abraham couldn't walk around and say oh god's promised me some land i think i'll go and grab this land over here in iraq it wouldn't be the same thank you so this is the promised land now as i go through this i want to there's a purpose for this i'm talking i'm going to mainly talk about a spiritual promised land from jordan to the sea but we have to go with a spiritual from a natural promised land then a spiritual promise then i love the word of god because it all makes sense and everything has to make i like things making sense in my mind not because i want to actually understand it although i think god as a such a powerful god that everything he does is awesome it's like when you take apart something you look at it and you think well this is made really well they thought about this and they put that there because of this and this god's no different when you start to unpack it you realize well this is made very well he did this because of this and this and this he's an intelligent god okay so now we're going to talk about a spiritual promise then real quick and it shall come to pass that i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams and your young men shall see visions so now this is another promise he's trying to talk about a promise the same as he said to abram i'll give you this land go here and i'll give you this it's this is now a promise and behold i send the promise of my father upon you an eternal promise but tarry ye in the city of jerusalem until you be endured with power from on high amen so now after that the disciples were in the upper room and the power of god came down and filled them all with the holy ghost with the spirit of god filled them into overflowing and they staggered around like drunk men and drunk women and it was about nine o'clock in the morning the third hour of the day and people started saying look at these guys they've just been in the upper room getting drunk because they're staggering on the streets that's what they said these men are all drunk you're an embarrassment to society look at you you know you should be at work you should be doing whatever it was but but they were drunk with the new wine with the promise that entered into that promised land amen and that's when peter said but this is that which was spoken by the prophet joel and it shall come to pass in the last days saith god that i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh he's saying i'm in the land i'm not drunk i'm just in the promised land okay then they said he preached to them the gospel and they said to him they were pricked in their heart and the people around said what should we do to be saved well how can we get into this promised land and peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost you too can receive this promise for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are afar off even as many as the lord our god shall call so he left this promise wide open for a lot of people i'm glad he didn't say for the promises to us and just a few of you people here and then that's it we wouldn't be here today we wouldn't bother preaching this gospel if he said that but he said it's to you to your children to them that are far off last time i checked we were quite a ways from jerusalem here i believe some people call this the outermost parts of the earth invercargill is the outermost part of the earth that's why no one goes there [Laughter] now this is talking about the promise to whom god would make known are what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ and you the hope of glory because now we saw from the last scripture that the promise was the holy ghost that that was what the promise was that you've got this piece of promised land now the spiritual type of that is the holy ghost receiving the holy ghost that's what we all understand that that's what the promise is is to receive the holy ghost now i said that's why i asked the question what is the holy ghost and paul expounds it he says to whom god will make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory so that's a manifestation of the promise is when christ comes into you well the next one says and that at that day you shall know that i am in my father and ye and me and i in you now we know it's physically i don't disbelieve god but i will tell you it's probably physically impossible for for one human being to go inside another human being naturally speaking right like i couldn't jump into mikey you know it doesn't but yet this human being said i will be with you even in you you and me and i and you so so then what is that what is this thing that comes in us this this being that speaking his name was jesus so jesus is god and when he says i will be with you even in you then it's jesus that comes into us from that he's eternal from the way before time to now it's it's it's it's always says christ in you well the physical man jesus body doesn't come and dwell on us but he says i'll be with you even in you right so the holy ghost is jesus christ coming in us that's why we're baptized in his name repent me baptize the name of jesus christ okay now just i just because i wanted to explain this just so we know this is what this is what this is all about it's not some it's it's everything that god is comes into us right and god in order to for us to try and understand this god explains himself as being a water or as being the word and and just like god's intelligent design these i don't think he didn't make these things and then think oh wow i didn't realize that was like a spiritual thing i'll tell them i'll explain myself that just happened to match the spiritual thing he made a spiritual thing and then he made a natural thing to mirror the spiritual things so you could say this is what that's like so he he describes himself as water and i said this if you have a lake called jesus water has the capacity that you could take some out of the lake and i could drink it and i've got the same lake in me and yet the lake still exists there but i've got some in me and it's the same lake now if i put that back in the lake it's just gonna you couldn't tell where it was because it's all the same thing it just dissipates back in the lake so so this is when jesus says i'll be with you even in you it's just we we draw from that great fountain of god and it comes every single it's not the whole of god fits in us because god fills all time and space but it's some of it comes out and gets put into us okay that's that's what that is and that's called the earnest of our inheritance that's called the the down payment we get this little down payment and one day we're going to have the fullness of god everywhere around us and in glory but we get this all the same goes with the thought so if i think something like if jesus thinks my name is jesus that exists in his mind but when he's but if he speaks it out it becomes a word that is in existence and yet it couldn't be an ex it's not different than the thought that was in his mind even though it's now separate that's why christ when christ came out of god it's no different than god it was just an expression he understands it's no different you can't the two are all the thought and the word are the same thing just just at one point it was in his mind at another point it was spoken but you can't have one without the other see so so god's made these types to show so when christ said i will be with you it's that's god saying i will be with you that's almighty god so that's what we get right that's uh okay so now we have this thing called the promised land now you've got this other idea this other issue i suppose you would say that there was also similar land to the promised land around the promised land like like if i had the border if i was if my if the water was here who's done this like you you go to canada say all the states you know and you you're in canada you say well i'm in canada no i'm in america now i'm in canada pretty well you're the land is going to be very very similar whether you go i'm in canada if there's snow there you pretty much step in the states and you're going to be in snow it's very very similar okay or if you're in mexico in tucson you know mexico tucson it's both going to be dry desert maybe there's a cactus growing right on the border you know where you are you american or are you mexican i'm mexican so this is why you get this issue here for there shall arise false christ and false prophecy and shall show great signs and wonders and so much that it were possible they shall deceive the very elect there are there are similar land that sort of looks very similar but it's not the same it's not the promised land okay i just put this photo in because that looks kind of scary hey this is where this this is the uh uh yeah it's it's the it's where they give it addresses at the vatican you know what would you design it like to look like a snake that's just weird like this is the place where you talk about the king that supposedly that god why would you i don't think that was a coincidence that it looks like a snake and it reverses back the other way so when the pope's talking it looks like all the people being eaten by a snake this is not from god i'm pretty sure that if a holy ghost filled architect would design a building he'd probably and he wanted to make it look like an animal he'd make it look like a lamb or something or a lion you know but this is not from god right this is this is not part of the promised land this there are there are people that are plowing and doing things and that are not the land maybe look this doesn't look that similar but there is none that looks quite similar we've got a little test for you children are these lands the same no one's like you know something's easy to discern it's not hard to discern things like if you look at this thing you think wow that's a nice green field that's israel by the way and you think if someone showed you that as being the promised land the antarctica you'd say no that doesn't look the same it's different you know or here's another one quite that similar guys children no quite the opposite that is this not going to fool you it looks you know one's desert ones you know what about this one these look the same oh come on man they look the same they must look exactly the same it's not as raw that that that that one there is zealand in the netherlands sea land and then people must come here and they're like wow that looks just like zealand so they call this place new zealand [Laughter] or like people from the uk must have gone to taranaki oh this looks like plymouth we'll call this new plymouth you know you're down south they all this looks like brighton we'll call this new brighton well york this is new york you know the state is full of new caledonia new hampshire all this okay this one here it's the same uh zeeland new zealand you can see why these thought to look quite similar right so this is not part of my overall sermon i just wanted to touch on this because because it is true that within this area you can have you've got you can have a lot right near the border that's where you get all the trouble because it's very similar okay a long way away you're not going to fall for it like some thing that looks like darkness you're not going to fall for that because it's hey that's ice this is sick this is green pasture that's desert this is green these don't look the same i'm aware of that but when it gets quite close it's more tricky to discern which one is which you know which one's the land which one is new zealand it's hard to tell the way that i tell now i just want to say this you can't i'm not saying this to be controversial but you can't say oh it's just by the word because everyone has the same word essentially it's i like to call it the the revealed word so it's got to do three things it's got to line up with my my understanding of a word has to line up with all the rest of the word because if it's the same spirit the same water in people and inspiring people the word is going to match all the way through if it's the same so the first thing is the word has to the revealed word is where someone comes with the revealed word of god and speaks it and it matches with everything else and then when the next person comes along could be ten years later could be a hundred years that it could be a thousand years later it's the same like it's the same word the same spirit they speak it and it matches with everything else so that's the first one and in our time the revealed word for our time says the same thing and then if you've got the spirit in you then your heart will witness the same thing as well okay so it's all that's that's what i'm going to say is the land not because i'm probably going jumping ahead a bit but but paul had to read the same word as the pharisees did he didn't have any more scriptures than they had and yet his gospel was very different he read the same scriptures see they and it's the same today we all read the same word of god and yet it's the interpretation is very different because some is not the correct interpretation so you can't just say it's the word it's the interpretation of the word and that's the you got that's why you've got to find your revealed word for your day and you'll find it will match up with everything else that's why brother brown said well paul be judged they said yes paul will be judged he said well i'm safe then i preach the same gospel that he preached because the revealed word will always be the same okay but moving on from that this now was called in here an inheritance islam was called an inheritance okay because god gave it to potentially gave it to abraham as a promise therefore it becomes an inheritance this is my inheritance and all of his children it's now their inheritance so i like to call it family land this is family land the scripture says in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him that worketh all things after the council of his own will so now because we are the promised land as an inheritance for the children of god now so therefore it's family land for us it's it's something it's not just it's if i could explain it in the right way when you look at it closely it's not just for everyone this is an inheritance for the children of god which god chose before the foundation of the world this is your inheritance so the holy ghost is an inheritance for the children of god amen all that the father has given me will come that's who it's for it's family land there's something about that land that connects with you because it's part of you it's my family land okay this is why this says according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world he's chosen us to have this promise that we should be holy and without blame before him in love in whom ye also trusted after that you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession to the praise of his glory so it's a small portion of what we're going to get like and even in the natural you know the spiritual israel is going to own the whole world eventually they're going to be there with us the the gods chosen people of israel will be there when the earth is renovated owning the whole thing so this here is just a small portion god says well you're here and well it's like this you'll just have that little portion it's but eventually those that are that are actually the spiritual israel will end up with the whole world as ownership it's the same with us we for a small time just have this portion of the spirit of god as a promise but he's saying this is just until you end up with everything with the fullness of god everything it's just until then this is just a uh uh doubt like uh he was gonna say yeah you sort of own the whole thing but it's proof you own it you know it's like the key for something the key man i'm gonna go get my car but i've got the key yeah that's the down payment okay but this is family land right there's something that connects you with this promise more than what will connect someone that's not part of the family with the promise that's why you have all the issue in the similar land because there's a lot of people there doing a lot of stuff there they're not they're they are not promised that land that's not their inheritance that's why they can labor on just on the other side of the border there doing their thing looks very similar but it's not for them that's people this side is there is ours that's not and that's theirs and this is not that's how it works so now we then make this journey you know we we at some point in our natural walk we we something in us says we hear about this promise and something in us desires for that we might live some of us may our life may have been over here in the cold desert we might be just be living a full life of sin just you know after all sorts of no good there'll be people here that were like that some people in the middle here were not so bad kind of our life was kind of similar to what the lamb was like but not you know still was a little bit different some people maybe are brought up in the message and you know you kind of you understand already how it the whole thing how it works you're very familiar with the land but you have to have your own experience to get in and your own promise but you're very familiar with how it all works you know that's this is just how this is just what happens right there are people sitting in here that come from all different areas but you're all if you're if that's your inheritance then you're all making that journey and i put sometimes only one person comes in sometimes the family might the god will call a whole family in sometimes it might be a couple just god does it but he's he's calling people he's calling his not people he's calling his children to their inheritance from all aspects from all walks of life and they they're all making this journey so they they they all make their way there now you then they they get to the they get to this the i'm going to call this the border of the promised land and it's and this is where we hit the scripture at the start and the lord spoke unto moses on the plains of moab by jordan near jericho saying speak unto the children of israel and santa then when ye are passed over jordan into the land of canaan i'm not going to get technical but they actually had more land promise than which was the other side of jordan and a lot of other stuff okay so the land they've got now is not actually all that they were promised they will promise a lot more but for the purposes of this just to make it easier because we can look at the map and look where it is we're just going to say that this is it here but there is actually more maybe there's a type in that you know they didn't quite get everything okay but here it says they they were sitting they'd gone up and they were on the jordan and god says when you cross over then this is what's going to happen so they were about over here where i put the flag it's about where they were they're on the plains and jordan seemed to be about a marker you know like a a border so it was something significant when you cross over it all starts you're going to push on you know and that's why this song here comes and we were able to go up and take the country that's standing on the on the border to possess the land from jordan to the sea because remember that was their promise uh abraham you're going to have from here to here and it was from jordan to the sea and about and down here and up to there this is what you're going to have so they they were they arrived on this spot with a promise this whole land is ours and all the children of israel there and we get there too we get to this on the border and we say this whole we have this promise this whole land is mine okay though the giants may be their way to hinder god will surely give the victory amen okay so then they had to cross over jordan now that's why god said when you get there they were under strict commandment strict commandment when you get there start taking it take it don't sit back don't think oh they look big start figure out what's yours which was actually the whole land and start taking it so when you walk in if you ever unsure he would say if you're ever unsure whether you should take it or not just look on the map look where jordan is look where the sea is and look where you are if you're in the middle of that take it i'm not sure if i should there's a big giant here a big city i'm not sure we can take it you send the message back to home base they will say um can you tell me your coordinates they send back they say uh our coordinates are we uh crossed over jordan and then we okay yep and then what direction did you walk ah we walked west we walked about 200 kilometers west okay so you're you hit the c yet no one i haven't at the c yet take it my calculations are between jordan and the sea take it it's yours someone said oh where are you oh we started at jordan and we headed uh east about 200k should we take this you're aware hang on no no no that's not between jordan and the sea you've gone the wrong way it's not the promise out there don't go messing with that like we read this morning you know when and the word for the day i said they went out and brother brown said you know they went somewhere where they shouldn't of and then god chastise them because hey you're going the wrong way amen it's not not where you're supposed to be it's not your promise there but it's between jordan and the sea so any if you ever can if you ever wonder the word of god the promises for us are between jordan and the sea so anything in there take it and it was a strict commandment god said take it all and he said if you don't if you don't take it all it's going to get the things you leave will be trouble to you you'll be a thorn in your side they'll give you trouble the whole time and what's more if you don't take that then i'll do to you what i was going to do to them this is not optional i'm not sure thinking about it this was actually a commandment you will take this whole land you will take it and the commandment was from jordan to the sea that's why i say if you you must remember this if you forget everything just remember this from jordan to the sea if you ever feel like you're a bit weary just think hang on hang on no i'm going to take from jordan to the sea the whole lot everything okay so now we're going to do a little bit of thinking this is kind of how it works in a spiritual sense and this is a natural sense that each area of lamb represents a part of the word of god and we're going to call that the revealed word of god like the promises the things that god has that's what there's a lot of different land here you know some is hilly some are plain some are rivers there's al there are all sorts of different lands to be taken some there are some big fortresses up on hills some are on the valleys some are easy to get some are a lot harder the the the land is all the word of god represents these all sorts of different areas of land that's this is this is the way this one works now it just so happens that as in the natural so the spiritual that every every promise of god that lays in that land there will be opposition to you getting that okay that this is the way because when the children of israel turned up the land wasn't empty ready to go it was there were a lot of people there and there were a lot of people that didn't agree with what with them taking it we're talking generations of family farms man and you mean i'm gonna walk away from it just because you said it was yours according to a promise no way man we're staying and we're fighting you know get all the get the most bravest men out we're gonna fight back at these people that are gonna come in and try and take our land and we're gonna they're out to absolutely destroy us so we're going to give it everything we got one or the other are going to win and when you're in a fight if people have the same desire if it's life or death i can pretty much assure you if there's a fight between life and death you're gonna fight for your life as the saying goes so none of the with every promise in the word of god when you cross over the land you receive the holy ghost you receive the spirit of god you're in the land nothing is going to come easy for you every single word of god is going to have opposition is going to oppose you okay that's this this is the way this thing works uh it's going to say all sorts of stuff now in the natural you could see an enemy or this that guy is he one of us no it's not one of us okay is he between jordan and the c yes well then he's gone you know it was pretty straightforward stuff is that johnny no that's not johnny okay take him out you know this here is but but now we have we are in a natural a spiritual sense now so this is now the battle is in our mind okay so and we we will get things like you know i'm here and this is all quite normal you know there's this i'm too entrenched to be able to get if you've gotten rid of you cannot defeat me this this is what they said in the natural but also the spiritual that's it's thoughts it's yeah okay now this is what i i want you to understand there's some parts we benefit from possessing and some we don't okay some some things make you feel good you know you there okay this okay i've just this is important to look at like this because we have to when we're a believer we're taking the whole lot see but green we benefit some things in the word of god we benefit i want my healing that's a part of the promised land oh yes why is it so good to you because if you can't walk very well and then one day you can you it benefits you well i can walk this i'm a recipient of a good thing here right yeah amen uh great you don't let's say you have to stop doing something that maybe you've done for a long time that god says you got to stop that i've done this for a long time this is just me and you know and you can't see how it benefits you at all because you just got to stop doing something but if that's part of the word of god let's be honest some things don't benefit you you just got to stop that okay so i'll stop it then what i'm not saying you argue with god but i'm saying blue either or some things are like some people struggle some people don't they're like either or brown don't know so green right when jesus fed the five thousand you know that provision is part of the word of god god's our provider these guys were happy so happy wow look we got all this bread and we're happy we've got a full stomach you know this is easy this will take this land you know because that you benefit uh when you get like healing you know these are these are easier these are the parts of the lamb maybe we go for first oh i want that you know because it's the good stuff for us we go for the easy stuff things that benefit us if you want to make anything successful just make something in it for somebody else and people will will do it if there's something in it for them that's like the best businesses when you study them are actually something's in it like like youtube or a massive business but it's only because people get to go in there and promote themselves and other people benefit from that trademe people get to go in there and sell their own things they benefit but people make profit off that you make something that everyone benefits from themselves they're right into it for you but you try and make someone donate money to something that they get nothing back from it that's no one's falling over themselves to give their money to that that's why sometimes the kingdom of god struggles but it shouldn't uh gray we don't so this man another man came to jesus there's another piece of land uh this rich man he said you know what what do i have to do he said do all these commandments he said you've done all those he said i want more thing sell all you've got and give it to the poor and follow me because that's also a part of the word of god forsake all and follow me here's a piece of land this doesn't really benefit me i'm not really into this and he walked away sorrowful he didn't want that why because he wasn't part of the of the inheritance when uh pete when when god said to peter jesus said to peter uh forsake the nets forsake your fishing come follow me peter was like yup where were we going threw his nets away dad you're in charge whatever give it to my brother whatever i'm gone now he did have a little backslide stage where he went back once it didn't work he i'm going back fishing you know but he didn't stay fishing he maybe had it he slid back but he went no no no that's not i'm following the lord i'll take the grave spots as well as the green spots see when jesus was healing people were everyone liked him they were when he was feeding the people they were just so happy then he then he one day said unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you've got no life in you and he didn't explain it and that was about enough about i would say probably 90 of his followers thought we can't go along with this this doesn't benefit me this is making me look rather weird actually and this is i don't know if this guy's really all there there was all this pressure and they couldn't take it and it said it says that that situation it says from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him the land was never for them never their land then jesus said unto the twelve will you go will you also go away and someone peter answered answered him lord to whom shall we go thou has the words of eternal life this is part of the promise i'm not going to go anywhere else and we believe and assure that thou art christ the son of the living god he's saying i'm not going anywhere i'm taking this whole land that doesn't this grave it doesn't make any sense to me but i'm going to take it anyway now with the things of god some things we understand what the reward is like healing oh well i know that when i uncover that i'll get healed it's good for me some things you don't know why you've got to do it and you've got to just do it anyway you can't see any benefit if i get rid of that i've been like that my whole life if i get rid of that how will it benefit me it will that's faith you just take it okay this is why brother ben preached about this about the passover lamb and this is along those same lines he said god said kill the lamb and eat the whole lot and that was the type of this eat not at ross eat it eat not of it raw no sodden at all with water but roast with fire his head with his legs and with the person that's thereof who knows what the pertinence is and you should know this brother know i'm not i'm not joking with the word of god but you know if there were africans here they'd eat the pertinence first you know in this thing because it's the the heart the liver or the maori boys you know they'll be the heart the liver the kidneys they're into that first you know leave all the steaks to the other people but that's what it said don't eat it all take take the whole lot maybe these people didn't like that sort of stuff but he said when you eat the lamb take you've got to take the whole word not just you can't just take the green bits gonna take the gray bits the brown bits the blue bits take take the whole lot okay so this is why you have issue this this is why you have the borderline believer type stuff and the other churches that that this is the way it's in the land just across the border here they still do have battles and still press on but they're only interested in the green ones only interested in the good things i don't know how satan does it because the bible says satan can't cast out satan but i would suspect because you think well this stuff gets set up and it's in similar land like if i if here's the promised land here this stuff gets set up here and they do actually take land and claim things like lord i believe you're healer and the healing comes you know they god honors his word the same and god on his faith they're just claiming the wrong place so so i don't know how satan would work it but i'm sure he's not worried about collateral damage like i'm sure like you've heard of some stories where there's a medieval battle you know and the soldiers are out on the in the field fighting one army's fighting another army's fighting and and then uh maybe the other uh opposing army is starting to win so the general up here says okay let's just rain down on them with arrows and that his buddy will say ah our own guys are in there yeah well we'll get there guys as well you know so i don't mind let's kill half of our guys just to get them because we've got plenty more guys lined up here and it's going to help us win the battle they're just they're what they call collateral damage i don't know if satan works like that but i'm sure he's not worried about collateral damage you know he just sits at church apparently knows that maybe some of his own people are going to get wiped out when they get cast out because they do actually get cast out because it says he can't cast out satan can't cast out satan but he still does i don't think he cares if he gets cast you know like because he'll set this up to deceive people let's see people you talk about making a journey people get sidetracked on that journey and they get oh well this is a promise then here like some people are coming from a long way and as they're making the journey you know there's all sorts of people i'll stay here live in this land here this is good land here they say no no the promised land's there but there are a lot of people on the journey that go oh yeah this probably is it similar is it they show photos of the land yeah yeah it's very similar it's the same this is that yeah you've arrived it's promised land oh really okay well okay good and they set up camp and they're battling in the wrong place and all they and most of the time in order to make these things work you have to just make it good right that's why this is a this isn't uh um i forget the version of this it's like a um this is the scripture in timothy there's a bible version where they've just kind of expounded to make it read really long so you get an idea of what it means for the time will come when people will not tolerate sound doctrine and accurate instructions that challenges them with god's truth but wanting to have the ears tickle with something pleasing they will accumulate for themselves many teachers one after another chosen to satisfy their own desires and to support the errors they hold and you've got a lot of this happening in this day that there's a lot of things set up there just just all the good stuff you know we'll just make it all good for you and a lot of it's on human emotion you know this is this is your invitation to come to church you know to be a part of this is the promised land you know if you're sad come here we will make you happy now that is a part of the promise of god but but you can't come to church on that basis i was sad now i'm happy and i'm why do you serve god because i'm just happy being here i was sad now i'm happy that can't be your pull it's that's not the promised land that's just a portion of it that that they can claim or like if you're lonely come here you'll have friends i have no friends now i come to church you've got a bunch of friends and they shook my hand at the door and everything i felt so good warm fuzzies now come live happy ever after you should the promise of god you should be able to go to a church where the word of god is again no one shakes your hand no one does nothing they don't even write your lunch nothing and then you're there the next week because there's something there that word i heard there's something there i'm coming back when i want you to come back well i'm coming back anyway because i believe this you know like the the like the sierra the the sierra phoenician woman was it that they said she was trying to get to jesus and they pushed her away said ah lady go away you know you're just we're all busy just being a you're being a pain she said i'm going anyway and she finally got to jesus after all that trouble he said uh it's not me to take the children's bird and give it to a dog like you yeah wow you you give anyone a bit of opposition these days they're gone oh i can't believe didn't show me i'm not going back to that church why because they came in for this reason oh they were all good at the start now so-and-so didn't invite me to lunch i think they're a bit clicky i'm not going back that's what they signed up for that's why when it doesn't happen they're gone the kingdom god's people are tough you know you can kick them out don't come back no they're coming back bust the door down i'm coming in and even when jesus said it's not fit to give take the children's bread and give it to dogs she said yes lord but the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from the masters table oh this that was her attitude there are crumbs are there where are they you know we we don't it's our inheritance there's something in us that just wants it if you're financially poor come here you'll get financially rich just like now that is true god if you serve god there's a high chance if you do things correctly your wealth will probably be better than it was when you weren't serving god because god's a provider right that that's i don't think you're going to go and be poorer unless the lord calls you for a season to do something you may be but you're going to have all that you need but this has been majored on like this is so funny because you know the the borderline churches will write off anything in the old testament that's all old testament we don't go with that we're just in the new testament so if you try and bring any thing that must be abided by that's in the old testament they'll quickly write it off so you say oh basically tithing is all in the old testament i know we keep that though that one's you know quoting the scripture god's you know week after week you know the old testament only because it benefits them because that's part of the green one uh so this is like now i'm not saying these things don't aren't part of the kingdom of god because they are but this is just how this stuff uh but jesus now this is not all that it is but you know if you want to be despised and rejected and hated without a cause you're keen on that uh and forsake everything and for the benefit of this uh for the pleasure of this you've got to forsake everything else and make me king of your life then come follow me anyone want to sign up see this is how because why because it's a part of you there's a promise there it's part of i have a promise that's jesus doesn't have to do this big cell come on come on please i'll make you feel happy come on no he just keeps on walking you're like jesus i'm coming where we're going you know that because there's something in us that's how that's what a real believer that's why brother said you don't need to baby people and you don't need to he's even got too many hot house plants that are used to growing in hot houses you know greenhouses you you put these things in the sun for a day out in the elements a bit of wind comes and they get blown over because they're not used to any wind not used to any hardship that but that's not us okay that's why we go yes they came from the east and west they came from a landfill that's there's something in that promised land along the way people are going to try and make us just have this here have that they have that no no it's over here my sheep hear my voice and the stranger they will not follow we're on our way to this land and there is something in you if you have a if you're part of that land then you will take all the land because that's a part of you this is not like you won't get there and then there were people there that like oh you know and you took half i don't believe that's the attitude of someone if they've got the if it's their inheritance that's not their attitude is just an encouragement that this is just i'm just reminding you what your attitude is which is from jordan to the sea that's my attitude okay so here we go these ones now we're going to go through like some of the different things you know that we so we go if we went for some of the green ones you know oh there's healing here praise the lord there's healing you know we will probably as human beings say we will take the path of least resistance and we will go for the things that benefit us first is that what we do we've got to be honest god made us selfish for a good reason like you think if a baby like a baby is completely selfish but it's a function of life you know imagine if a baby was selfless and just no that's right you go first like it will be it will starve to death oh no i won't cry it's all right you guys are busy i know i know you're busy you can't really look after me i'll just be unselfish and you guys just go first and don't worry about me because it cannot fem for itself it's got to be selfish it's like i'm hungry man me me feed me now i don't care if you're tired i don't care if you haven't slept i don't care if there's no food find some and give it to me you know but it's a function of life god didn't make it like that babies would die suddenly you'll be odd little johnny's dead i haven't been him for four days no i knew it that's the fourth one you know god's designed humanity like that even i won't this but but even with the good land these are easy ones to take because you know you you know what the result of getting it is going to be so you're going to put a bit more of an effort to get it and but you're you're always going to get opposition to any part of the land you take like you'll hear a science says it can't happen if you're scientifically minded how's that going to happen you know how can i be healed i know that this part is broken here and that's there and that's like this and it cannot scientifically happen and that's naturally the truth but god can do anything i like to make sense of god and this makes sense to me that god has codes and he can just go you're healed right uh oh this just runs in the family it's just kind of part of you know he ready to tear you just just live with us you know you're gonna have opposition as soon as you try and claim a promise or yeah just live with it just don't worry about to live with it but you don't have to but then as with all of this there's surrounding land you know you take it you realize oh there's actually other bits of land around here that are kind of kind of you know it's not all like i can just claim my healing and everything's done and dusted sometimes you get sick it's a punishment you you've done something and you get you something happens you're like lord heal me but you've got to be honest with yourself have i done anything or do you check it all first this is not just child's play you know you can't just pretend everything's all rosy maybe it's not maybe you've done something now that's for you to decide not for you to decide oh bro you must have done something that's why your legs like that well that's not for me to decide as far as i'm concerned your leg here we pray for you but i am i've got to have confidence as long as you know you're all good then i pray for you you know because we like it like as and paul said and even brother brown talks about sometimes you can cast something off someone will use that power to take something away from them that they're supposed to have because it's something they're supposed to go through right sometimes it's just a long trial it just goes for a long time and you wonder lord i have this for 10 years but sometimes it's how you go through it that inspires other people they think look at this person they just go week after week trust in god i think i can too i can trust in god too if they can i can week after week month after month year after year sometimes it's just a thorn in your flesh this is all part of the land when we when we take it we realize oh there's little bits of land here too oh you know like paul said lord get rid of this some people say it was his eyes he couldn't see that well other people say it was different things but it was a bodily function that didn't quite work properly he said lord deliver me of this and the lord said no i'm just going to leave that there my grace is sufficient for you you've just got to have this little thing to keep you down so you don't get too carried away think you're all this you're always going to have this little almond that's just going to hold you back just a bit you know some people said it was a stutter so try to preach and it'd stutter away you know whatever it was sometimes we just have those so you this is all this joy oh i want joy you know you might be depressed i want joy you know because joy makes you feel good right you don't you don't want to be he wants to be unhappy you want to feel good but you see you try and get that you realize it's inheritance there's joy as an inheritance right that's right these things have i spoken unto you that my joy might remain in you and that your joy may be full this is an inheritance right so it's part of it it's part of the promise but when you go and try and get it you'll get this thing off that's okay to kind of be down always be always be that it's okay it's okay just it's normal you'll be happy when things get better when it gets better just because of all these things you go through while you're down when they're all sorted you'll be happy if you believe that there'll always be something going on you'll always be done see always you understand this now we understand there's a there's a level of up and down that human emotions have to go through and that's also for our protection like your emotions are there to protect you once again like the crying thing if you didn't have an emotion to feel scared or to feel uneasy in a situation then you could stay in a very bad situation and maybe even to your death because you didn't discern that you felt bad you know these emotions if you feel uncomfortable in a situation like if there's an abusive thing you you you get an emotion that you're scared but that's to tell you to act hey you're there's something could harm you you need to get out of the situation that's an emotion but if you're just scared at every little thing something pops up you're scared you're scared you're scared you're scared you know and you live in fear that's not that that's satan always tries to take it all too far you're not supposed to live like that but you do you do have a healthy balance of emotions a believer like a natural person has to have that a little bit up a little bit down there you you get a bit downhill this is tough but you as a human but so you you can't say oh i'm a down today maybe i'm not a believer there's a certain amount you have to allow for but when you notice this man this is getting me down and it's affecting my walk it's affecting everything then you need to stop that that's not part of the land my inheritance is lord i'm full of joy okay but sometimes things don't quite work out and you just um i just want to point this out because like you don't just a lot of the times when we get things we're happy but sometimes when we've got nothing to be happy for god wants to say are you still happy yeah and he might bring us through things take everything away to see okay let's just hone in on that joy you're talking about so let's take everything that makes you happy let's take that all away let's see yeah and god does that let's see if you you know you think man i didn't i thought when i come in the land and claim this ground it's just going to be full of joy and everything's going to be happy ever after well it is but there's a little bit of land next to it he's gonna you gotta get as well which is maybe can you be happy when it's all falling apart when nothing's working where is your joy where is it see you because they they've got this promise in the in the borderline but that's just you know most of the time it's just because they've got the other promise which is get heaps of money i've got money i'm happy yeah everything's going good you know i got that promotion at work i'm happy you know what about hey hey guys i just lost my job i don't know how i'm gonna survive praise the lord it's probably more of a testimony now we have promises for family this is part of the land although it's natural it's actually a part of the land we based that on this this episode in acts where paul said where the the the prison was shaken that and paul and silas got out and the jailer was scared because he he knew his life was on the line if he lets his prisoners escape he's done for and he said and he was he was going to kill himself because when he realized they were escaped it's like well i might as well kill myself now because i'll be publicly executed tomorrow anyway so um but paul preached to him and he said to paul what must i do and he said believe on the lord jesus christ and you will be saved and your house so now because we take paul's word as being the revealed word of god then then we this is where we apply that scripture to our life and say well if paul said that to him and gave him a promise i believe that was a promise from god to paul so we can claim that for ourselves we can say lord the promise is me and my house we can claim that promise this is where we we base it on this is what they call like in court they have like a precedent oh well we will judge this in this case because in that case they judged it there so this is the same case we'll judge it this way this is this is but you see you're going to have this opposition oh no they won't come in no no no no it's not really you can see they've said they're not coming in you know they're not just gonna you're not just gonna claim this then the devil just gives it all up yeah take him yeah you're right actually i didn't realize that was in there he's yours she's yours you know here you go uh you know and oftentimes it cause you know you say it's going to cause a lot of friction in your family if you keep up the stance you know look it's already causing a lot of trouble just don't worry about it just keep the peace let them do what they do and just be one big happy family you know don't don't claim this land he's not going to give up easy but there's a little bit of surrounding land we think we think we're going to walk into this land everything's just going to be easy the surrounding landers think not that i am come to see peace on earth i am not come to see peace but a sword i am come to set a man at variance against his father and the daughter against their mother and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law and a man's foes shall be those of his own household he that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me and hear that love a son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me and he that taketh not his cross and followeth after me is not worthy of me when you get to that situation where it all looks like it's bleak and you're tempted to go uh i'm either gonna this is causing too much friction i've got two options i can either give up and just allow whatever it is and say yeah look i'll just become more like you and we'll just compromise and like say your wayward son or daughter and then let's just keep the peace and yet all good i'll just start my social drinking with you more just you know or do you say look if that's going to be your stance you and i are going to be at odds all those dreams i had of us being buddy buddy and you know we're going to have good father son everybody's going to be great we're going to build this house together and do whatever that's off because i'm going this way you're going that way there's going to be friction just divided and that's it but i'm not going back that way i'm going this way if you go that way then then they will see jesus says if you come into that situation what are you going to do are you going to go a lot of people i've seen it they'll compromise you know that even the husband and wife the the wife wants to go the husband doesn't or vice versa and and then the wife or the husband will compromise just for the sake of keeping the peace but if you're going into this land you won't now that might sound harsh but this is the surrounding land you'll say no no i'm not compromising and if you don't want to come then then then where do we go from here how can two walk through unless they be agreed no that doesn't say god doesn't keep his promise because he does but sometimes you've got to go down this path to see do you do you really do you want this or not how much is it worth to you money who wants lots of money no one's going to put their hand up but the people the people that are honest do i want lots to give to the kingdom of god that's that's the only the only desire in me to make money is to give to the kingdom of god so you can push the kingdom of god forward you know but but there are promises of provision and blessing in the word of god in the land there's a promise there bring all the ties into the storehouse that maybe meet in the mind house and prove me now here with saith the lord of hosts that fall not open you the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing that there should not be enough to receive it great verse for the borderline believers yeah just claim this promise people they wave their money up you know before they put it in you know and they get it we get it because it's a promise they're just claiming it in the wrong land you know wasting time you might as well not even do this just go and be an unbelieving business person shaft everyone around and make some money that way don't bother doing this way probably make more money that way but but you see even in doing that you still get opposition to that you're still going to say well satan's going to say well that won't work if you give your money away technically you're not going to have it that you have a hundred dollars to give away 10 20 you're only going to have 80. you are going to be poor you realize that and you've got bills to pay this week you need 100. you're going to give your number 90 i'm going to work maths don't add up that's what you it's not going to be yeah you're right yeah give it because you're going to be blessed god's going to bless you he's going to find another way to pay your bills he's not going to tell you that it's a bit tight this week same as it has been for the last couple of weeks maybe last six months but when it gets better you'll be able to do it yeah that's what he's going to say right hey that's what he says he's not going to give up easy even though but the reason why we're more prone to do this is because we can see on the other the green ones mean we can see what the result will be and that'll be good so we're gonna we want it because we kind of know there's a good result okay but then there's surrounding land which is us things like this but godliness with contentment is great gain for we brought nothing into this world and in certain we can carry nothing out and having food and raiment let us be there with content got food clothes you're happy but they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare into many foolish and hurtful lust with drum men and destruction and petition for the love of money is the root of all evil which while some coveted after they have aired from the faith and passed themselves through with many sorrows people that have chased after it and let it become their god it's destroyed them but that doesn't mean you can't have a whole lot it won't destroy you you see this there's all the surrounding land that that we want spouse who wants us you know oh the there i know this is natural again but there no doubt there is a promise of a of a god-given husband or wife for you in the land you know you serve god god the scripture says who so findeth the wife findeth the good thing and obtain the favor of the lord and we know that there's a promise in there so you can lay claim on that if you want to and if you feel too you can it's in the land right but then you satan's not gonna say yeah yeah no you're right go there's a lot of good believers here you know he's maybe gonna start getting you to get someone else you know plenty of other believers outside of you know fair they're good people good girl she's a good girl she's a good girl but it'll give you trouble later on maybe uh don't wait too long they'll all be taking just a quick quick you're in your 30s now go quickly you'll be left on the shelf you know just snap up anybody you know that hey they're all being married off don't do it see yeah even though it's in the land potentially but there's other ones paul's addressed this once and he said it's actually better to remain single just stay like i am then you can just serve the lord you've got no troubles as soon as you get married you're going to have trouble in the flesh it's going to it's going to bring a whole new element into your life you can't fully serve god you've got to look after your husband and wife you've got it desires are going to be split that's okay but he just said that's the way it's going to be so overall you're better if you just stay single because then you're 100 focused guys angles on the lord you can just serve the lord everything's good stay that way but if you go the other way it's fine but you're going to have troubles there but there are times where some people just can't dwell together peacefully it just doesn't work out and and there and even in that there's a there's a there's an allowance to say if you physically can't if you just can't get along then you're better off not to be together see but even in this there are believers in this situation but but even in this god knows now do you think god didn't know when you did that when it didn't work out he knew he knew when you started he knew and it didn't work out sure if you didn't i'm confident of this that if you're a son or daughter of god that he could have stopped it if he wanted to there's a purpose for everything sometimes you know sometimes you don't but there is a purpose like in this one here then this is just me being honest when i see people that maybe it hasn't worked out and they're separated but i see them still pressing on serving the lord and coming to church they don't realize how much it inspires me i think and this is the truth i'm not making this up to make people feel good i sit back at home when i'm maybe going through a rough patch and i think if they can do it under their circumstances so can i it inspires me i look at that and i think i want to be like that i want to have that same sort of tenacity lord and i it encourages me to push on now that person doesn't those people i'm sure don't know that they influenced me but at the end of the road they will see maybe not realizing it lord i thought i just battled away and you know my husband we couldn't get along and we had to sort of separate they and then they know they can't marry someone else and it's just now i just i'll just battle the way i thought it was just my life was pretty mediocre but they one day they will see the impact that they had because it's all for a purpose it's all for a purpose now some things some things you you don't know that you i've made these gray where you don't know the outcome of what the other thing will be these are the things you sort of maybe don't want to get rid of maybe you're used to living your whole life this is probably more guys you know you just get angry yeah i told him where to go you know yeah it's your you and that's always been your reaction is anger or something and people know you oh man don't mess with him he gets angry and you quick sort it out that's how you operate right and you know no different and you just you maybe but some things in this land you don't know what the other side when you take that land you don't know what's there that's you just got to do it if the bible says stop being angry but i've always been angry this is how i've operated whenever someone messes with me i just get angry if i'm at work but and you don't know the you don't know what how it would be if you didn't but if you get told not to then this is you've got to take that word as well don't just take the stuff you can see the good result well lord i've just always done this no stop what's there if i stop that doesn't matter there could be worse thing there for you who cares i said stop so stop this is how we do you understand now i've just got these these ones here are just like these ones you know you someone always gets depressed stop oh but it's how i've always done things happen to me and i just start it really gets me down and no no you've got to defeat that thing but that's all i know what it what's there if i take it what what's what's part of the land you'll find that here will be patience i just i decided my day to stop i said lord i want to take this there's this thing there and i just want to overtake it your word says to take it now where is this from jordan to the sea yes i don't understand it but it's there it's between jordan and the sea i'm taking this one if the bible says don't do it then i'm not doing it now when you overtake it you'll find the land there's way better you know it's way way better depressed lord always get depressed all the time certain degree okay big amount deal with it somehow some way but lord what will there be if i don't that's that's my go-to it's my go-to place don't go there just don't go there like it's if it's between jordan and the sea i'm not gonna say it's easy because a battle when you're fighting to the death it's not easy i'm not up here saying just deal with it it's easy come on you know it's not like that i'm not saying this is all going to be easy what i'm saying is you all have it in you to take the whole land because you had a desire for it you all have it in you and you can do it that's what i'm saying is it going to be easy probably not you're going to have a few scars along the way probably well some things you battle with for years maybe but you all overcome you will all overcome because you desire to if you are used to sort of being the guy that's just telling all sorts of suggestions or you know guys are a bit more humorous guys will do that maybe girls are a bit more gossipy you know you just love to kind of you know when you're gossiping because some things you have to say as as fact like if i have a say say we we're doing a film you know and we've got crew and someone isn't quite working and i've got a assistant director that we've got to talk about things and i say i can't just say oh you know they're really good you know everything's good i've got to be honest and say look that person there is absolutely hopeless they cannot do their job they're causing trouble with all this and that now i'm not gossiping about them or talking about it to them behind their back although i'm talking bad about them and then they don't know what i'm saying but it's i've got a job to do i've got to tell you that this is causing trouble in our department they're causing this issue but there's no malice in me to want to bring them down i'm not like ah i'm going to run them down to here and and make you not like them it's like so there's a certain degree of honesty that even brother branham when they were driving to visit some brother i think he was telling perry green about all the things these brothers have done all the bad things you know and but he was just explaining this is what's happened because he's maybe as leadership at a church these are the situations this is what's going on and brother perry granted by the end of it he was ready to roll up his sleeves and give these boys a beating you know and and he said um they were driving along he said oh they live just over here let's go and see them we'll call and say hello so what i was going to beat them up you know but it wasn't gossip it wasn't malice there was no it just was facts it was information just like um paul said of peter oh when i went there peter did this he wrote into the scriptures peter got a bit embarrassed about this you know he didn't want the jews to see him come with me so you know this is what happened don't use that as a as a now a um free ticket to gossip because you know there's a there's a point where you can say some facts about a situation then you know when it's gone now now you've got something and it's just now oh and by the way did you also know me [Music] see and usually there are very few people to say negative things about it's usually in some sort of leadership thing when you've got to be honest about something to other people and that it concerns but like i wouldn't say say in a film crew i wouldn't go and talk to mikey or mikey that that guy over there is utterly useless honestly don't do nothing you know well i try not to anyway maybe i'll get lacked but i would because i wouldn't run them down to mikey because mikey is he doesn't it doesn't consume him okay but but god wants the in the land this is not there you know if you're always joking around saying crude stuff don't just don't say it what am i going to talk about stop saying it and you'll figure out some you maybe you'll have conversation season with grace you might have other things you can say instead there'll be something better there but sometimes you don't know what it is that's what when we talk about taking the whole end take the ones that that you don't know if there's a good result in there for you just take it anyway okay uh in your mind you know you might have just filled your mind up with all sorts of movies and music and stuff and then god says stop all that oh wow this is the most of us all right stop it all what am i going to fill my mind with you'll see take it away you'll you'll find now to be filled with something better it's going to work out better but at the time you think man this is when i sit down on a friday i do this and you know on my car driving along in the morning you know maybe take it away you maybe don't understand but just take it away god doesn't just mess around and he expects us to do things that we don't understand why that's right we don't understand where he expects us to do things where there is no good in it for us it can't just be all like oh heal me look because i can see when i'm healed i'm happy it's got it you got to take the whole lot well you've got to dress a certain way you can't just dress all this and that and you know like all the brothers here look like that if they take their shirt off you know and i've been camping with the brothers i know you know they're in the lounge you know but this will a way you portray yourself and god says there's a way you present yourself it's not that yes ah but i've always done this you know unlike got a good body if you if you've got it flaunted all that nonsense but that's not the way there's a way you do it and god says do it this way but it just can make me look a bit funny but then look funny they look funny make me look a bit unpopular make me stand out then stand out what's in it for me probably nothing but there doesn't always have to be something in it for you because that's not how this thing works sometimes there's things in it for god not you he says i want you presented that way now just clean up your act and look that way okay and you take it you're going to get opposition to doing all of this you're going to get opposition to doing it okay the way you conduct yourself you know like oh i got to have social drink stop it or you know i'm chasing after all this money or my are you is your conduct your dealings with people day-to-day stuff is it is it good is it honorable do they walk away feeling good or do you do people walk away feeling bad what's your conduct like with them you know this is all part of the land it's not just all the good stuff it's all this is all part of it like at your work how do you conduct yourself do do people are people happy to have you around are they like no i don't like having that person around they're just always negative or this or that how's your conduct you know people this is why people want to be popular god says no there's no popularity here you're probably going to be made fun of unless young people struggle with this you know because if you make a second if you because god calls you to this you know lord i want to be popular you know suddenly got to dress up this snack like this but no one's gonna like me well god will amen but this is something now all the old people shouldn't say oh but all the older people say amen because you get to a stage where you realize i'm not cool anyway you know who cares you know i think it's when you have children you you they suddenly you suddenly realize man i'm like on the out crowd now like when did we transition you should give me some warning suddenly i'm old i've got children that that are making fun of me about come on dad you know maybe did i get old you know i'm cooler than you anne you know young people battle with this one maybe more than older people it's like the way that young people dress now you know they when you get old and married you're like yeah you know it all just gets lazy you know just you put this way people walk in town in their pajamas you know but i guarantee when they were maybe if they were meeting their potential marriage partner for the first time they wouldn't roll into town in their pyjamas you know but but young people will battle with some of these things more than older people but still is a battle that everyone has to to take right and to fight this is one you know you could even get even with that guy that girl you know the the the word of god says why don't you just suffer wrong he did me wrong now it's not just oh if you and the peter said it's not just if he said if you were wrong if you did something wrong and then i came to little never set up the front bro mikey did something i did something wrong to mikey you know i walked past him and i booted his leg you know i was clearly wrong and then ben said i saw you do that to mikey you were wrong i'm like yeah sorry mikey you know but if i was wrong i can easily go oh yeah but but if i did nothing to mikey and ben said oh you did this to mikey and i said no i did nothing and he told you oh my you told me did you tell him i did something to you the bible says that even if you weren't wrong if you were completely right just still take it don't worry about it don't get even don't worry about it just take it he said why don't you rather suffer wrong or you get you get done over in some deal just take it i'll show them i'm gonna i'm gonna make this deal right i'm gonna god says why don't you just take it especially if it's brethren just take it take the loss all good and don't even tell them it's all good yeah no great deal awesome you lost everything yeah awesome i'm just pointing it out this part of the land you know you're something we're not called to get even we're called just to yeah now that that might be hard for us to take as well so everything's going to be fair down the line no it doesn't it wasn't fair with god they hated me without a cause then he came and died for us and he didn't even commit how's that fear yeah that's not fair but he did it anyway you understand i just want to point out there are things in there that we don't know but you start doing that you realize man the lord just looks after me vince is mine i'll repay says the lord i can i just don't have to worry about stuff people can walk all over me everything turns out all right for me doesn't matter you realize that's what's what's in the land they can you can get done over a million times and still come out far better off why because if you're just committed to god when you put your hands on something god can't deal with it if you just commit it to god saying that's all good and i'm happy yeah often times you come out better off you know we don't always have to get in there pride you know who no one here is proud look at what i've done but this is something you that's it's out this this whole attitude me i'm pretty good even when you're sitting down in your room by yourself you don't think this i'm pretty good no no we we're humble with the brothers there brother oh no praise the lord he really helped me when you get home you're like man i'm pretty good you know god sees that too hey but this is part of the land the lord knows i look at my life and i think lord the only decent stuff i've ever done is i've committed it to you it's all i've done decently and that's it and and i didn't even do that i'm like man this is something i didn't even you called me first so i didn't even that you put a desire me to do this even the one thing that i kind of did right you put that desire on me to do it i'm like okay well that's it then and all that all that i have everything is because of your blessing lord and it's nothing that i've done i haven't i'm not smart haven't figured things out and haven't got there's nothing lord i've just i've just given you my loaves and fish that's it and that's that's our attitude that's you know walk around like like brother branham said of that that preacher that walked up to the purple proud you know and then he tried to preach it didn't quite work out then he walked down all sort of humble walked up like this you know and walked down like that and the old sister said you know if he had walked up the way he walked down he would have walked down the way he walked up [Laughter] this is blue because this could go either way talents you know most some people have to give their talent some people aren't just like but you've but part of being in the land you've got to give what you've got to the lord have to it's not optional i don't know no you have to have to you've got to whatever you can do you've got to give that talent to the lord he wants to see a return he's very clear on that where's my return on my investment i invested that into you where is my return oh no i hit it in the ground i didn't do anything with it well then you're wrong take it from cast them out no i want to return and they people even they even say well you're a hard man he's like no i just i gave the ability to do it you could have gone dealt with it and brought some you should i wanted my talent back with interest that's in the land it's not optional you've got to do it got any talents you've got to give them to the lord uh you've got time who has spare time i shouldn't have said that because i'm going to now twist it around and then and then we're just in closing i've got about five more minutes uh okay in order to have something just for the people that don't know my theory on time where if you to have something spare you've got to know two things how much have you got and how much do you need like if uh if we needed three microphones here because we knew say we got three people speaking okay how many microphones have we got 10 how many people are speaking three so how many have got spare seven so because you know these two equations right so you look at people say well i've got some spare time today so no you don't have any spare time ever in your entire existence yeah i do no no how much time have you got i don't know no no what how much time have you got left i could drop dead now my time's up how much time have i got left i really don't know how much of it do you need all of it so how much have you got spare not a single second i allocate time i don't i don't have spare time it's all allocated now if i want to allocate time to sit down do nothing then that's where i allocate it to what are you going to do this afternoon nothing i'm allocating my time to do nothing but god has called us to a certain degree allocate your time wisely allocate it you've only got you don't know how much you've got allocate allocated certain portion you've got to balance it out you know you've got family this and that and hobbies and things but make sure you allocate it correctly balance it out and make sure i get a decent share of your time if you find something else is robbing you deal with it i need a decent share god wants a decent share he doesn't want to have par he's not we're not part-time full-time service we're called to serve god and as he sets up fellowships and groups and places and he expects each person to figure out where that is where i've put you in served there do things there whether it be this or that or that he expects that from us it's not like oh by the way if you feel like it maybe go and serve you it's not optional you have to that's part of the land oh i don't serve them everything like this see all these things you're getting it fought with you know they're not going to come easy but they're all part of the land but just in closing mark my words this land that we're in it's land flowing with milk and honey it's a good land every bit of land that you claim you realize there's something better there afterwards even if you didn't know there's always when you get rid of that thing there there's always something far better than what was there it's like man i used to get angry and i'm so happy now i don't get angry anymore i'm just so patient it's so much more enjoyable or at least the gossip now i can just speak about the lord or whatever things you might when you get rid of something that the wrong thing the the right thing is always so much better i've always liked the concept of milk and honey because it's such a good barometer of a land you know there's the there's two things that come from a land if you have a lot of honey it means you've got a lot of bees if you've got a lot of bees it means you've got a lot of fruit a lot of life everything's growing and the more fruit trees the more like you have clover from the spring you've got the grass grows has all the flowers and everything and the bees are just buzzing all over it the more of that you have the more honey you get so if god says it's flowing with honey it means there's a lot of life there there's fruit trees there's this and that this place is just the honey is just the honey is
