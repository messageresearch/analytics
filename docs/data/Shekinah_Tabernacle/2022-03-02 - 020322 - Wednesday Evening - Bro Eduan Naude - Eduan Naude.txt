and you're chiseling away and forming us molding us lord and uh here we are tonight lord a surrendered vessel so that you can speak through us lord through me through the musicians through the technicians law that's on their post of duty and so steadfast and our little congregation now the people here i have encountered them lord but i know that your prophet speaking have spoken lord and about a about a wonderful time and i can't remember if it was dwight moodley he was the only one in the crowd he was the only one sitting in the pew lord and he received lord and that was in your perfect will couldn't be any other way may it be here tonight as well jesus christ's name amen [Music] thank you musicians god bless you saints uh you may have your seats tonight i've got a small i i actually don't know what i have the lord's been throwing so many ideas at me i i think thank you brother armand that started this um uh just to have a a real focus on on a pre-service again a real uh a real time of of within his presence pray pray pray pray we've spoken it so many times that that's the one thing that's absolutely the one thing we cannot do enough and there's not enough time in the day to do that as well so i want to really focus tonight on on on praying and and i hope i've got all the prayer requests here at the bottom of my little notes um um i think the oh lord just take control i think the what i want to come tonight with is um sorry thank you lord we've been in so many times in situations where i come from a south african background and even in the third world we haven't experienced war we haven't experienced anything that except the lion that chases after us and um but it was always fight or flight it was always it was always um protection it was always run as fast as you can it was always look behind you it was always put your hand back under the seat lock the doors have something in in front of your window so that no one can come in and ironically so that we can't escape what we talked about the other day toilet truly doors or what was it called maxi doors or something within the hallway within the bedrooms and everything to protect yourself and it was always a fight or flight and through the culture and didn't matter what color you were you you had to protect you had to you had to fight we had to flight and um here we are tonight in a country that's actually peaceful and a country that's got security and and and often offer so much to us um with that in mind um when we were in in our previous country we had to identify with something with you know we we had an identity we had a hardness we had a pride we had something we had to identify with something we had an identity praise the lord and i came here i could throw all that away and i could start new with a new identity i want to read a scripture to you sister talia you can throw it up there please it's one chronicles one chronicles four and if you want to stand and read with me that will be nice i would um i'll probably read i think initially i had three verses i'll just read these two so one chronicles 4 verse 9 and 10. do you love the lord tonight one chronicles four you can put that up you've got it here we go aniabas yabis was more honorable than his brethren and his mother called him yabba saying because i bear him with sorrow and yah was called on the god of israel it's very important he called on the god of israel saying on oh that thou wouldest bless me indeed and enlarge my coast and that thine hand might be with me and that thou would has keep me from evil that it may not grieve me and god granted him that which he requested john 14 john 14 verse 12 john 14 verse 12 very familiar very very verily i say unto you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and greater works than these shall he do or she do because i go unto my father we all go unto our father may god bless the reading of his word you may be seated i've got one little scripture right at the end that we can we can throw it it will be one of the um [Music] one of the uh slides there i've got two slides there um and maybe just maybe we should just get into that i would i would um i would encourage you tonight and this is something i've i've picked up in a sermon one day or sitting here and again this is all to do with identity please look through the lens of identity where are you now i remember the last time i had this funny little title called do you look where are you looking to that could define who are you don't be you be him but there's the but when you realize who you are and now i'm talking in christ then you can be you because of him the lord gave that to me i don't know i don't even have a date i don't know when and it struck me because because because with my background denominational background and um it was always again i'm i'm talking about this fight or flight it was always a a fight who is right who's reading his bible the most who understands and interpret it the right way in the correct way and with that you wanted to you wanted to be him but you haven't identified who you are i don't know if it makes sense don't be you when when you are when you are not you don't be you but be him okay when you understand that when you are your identity is in him then realize who you are then be you okay because then you can step back and say i am who i am because of him hopefully that makes sense leave yourself behind leave everything behind nothing matters on this earth and our surroundings and our circumstances but him and if you can place him on a pedestal somewhere huge in your heart make room for him whatever you do so that you can realize then who you are and he can be he can be himself through you and as ironic and how's how how how in afrikaans we say dear macar how confusing that sounds that's when you find yourself and that's when you know that you know that you can be running for shelter you can be trying to keep away from a from a protest or some sort of silly virus doesn't matter you know who you are and we've got that song that we so so love to hear and love to sing along with this you i know who i am so maybe we can do that later on can i um i think this slide was identification says natalia yes oh can you read there oh that's good i'll read that for you and that's about four or so uh sermons ago that brother ben posted um moses had to stoop from a throne to take the word of god he forsook a throne that's right he was the head here to the throne and he forsook the pleasures of being pharaoh for he esteemed the reproach of christ greater riches than the treasures of egypt moses had had the right to the pharaoh throne he was educated in that way and i don't know how many times how regularly but i can just picture myself like brother ferdi did it so nicely when he he described our our king sitting and fishing for us it was beautiful to see and it was it was really um i thought um sincere and and and meant in a really good way and this is i think moses mother came to him and tap him on the shoulder and reminded him who he was who he is and who he needs to be for a people and for the king to be uh to be the one that would lead out of egypt now if you look in the natural way he was standing within the palace with um people around him that will that will dress him and that will you know provide to him whatever with a click of a finger his mother would come and tap him on the shoulder and say remember who you are you say well i tell you the woman will will all laugh at me the men i think i don't care what they think that's right i hope that sinks in with you tonight don't care what they think paul stooped now paul when he was sold moses stooped from a throne i got a line of wrote drove down here about three pages now let me tell you something right quick jesus stooped from heaven to reflect himself in the in the form of sinful flesh and who are you or who am i to make to make a way for us to reflect god to make a way to reflect himself in us by sanctifiers to his word for his word says that when he did so so that we could reflect his word so that we could reflect his word coming back to my little theme there of stand aside when you don't know yet who you are and let him be him let him work let him change let him uh there's a beautiful skit in one day if the lord tarries which i hope he doesn't um and and brother armand um agrees we can do a little skit um called uh god's chisel god's chisel and and the guy stands and he's chiseling away um he's representing god and and this guy said yes yeah i'm i'm ready and he sucks himself up and he motivates himself look it's still self is still here it's still i'm i'm me i want to be him but i'm i'm me and every time god gets out the chisel and he knocks ah it's so it's all maybe maybe try left try the left side any oh no no no that's that's aina that's ouch um um can i not um try my tribal racial and and they knocks and it's sore and it's ouch and he doesn't know any anywhere it's gonna hurt anywhere it's gonna hurt your character is needs to be needs to be chiseled and if you if you take a little wooden block or something you start to chisel doesn't matter which side you start there's chips that will fall away there's chips large small and one day it'll feel better the one day it won't um there's big chips and small chips that need to get off and that god's chisel is is so needed in each in our life to to be you because of him i actually don't know where i'm going with this realize who you are realize that the world around us is quite real where we um so i'm just seeing that scripture have i read everything there 244 oh that's right i wanted to end that's right sorry that was not in my notes the last one then you are identified somewhere in the scripture so if any will follow me let him deny himself let him deny his man-made creed pick up his bible pick up your you know and follow me that's right so then you are identified somewhere in the scripture sorry i had to hurry and get all my notes here in one place and i read that and i thought i cannot leave that out that is that is the crux and i left it out of my notes find yourself in the scripture find yourself where are we um i've been i've been finding myself in in numbers the blessing um i've been finding myself where where um oh me and sister lundy went for a walk who was that samuel it was one of the prophets and uh hopefully one day i'll share about that where where the lord said don't mess with the prophet don't mess with him don't reject him don't don't in in the wilding term dissim um they would they would you you he he is it he not slay but hugh hoe down however uh yeah um they will hack you basically is what the scripture says be very careful if the prophet comes over your way and he speaks something to you that is maybe not contrary to to what this guy it's uncomfortable what i'm hearing what i need to do be yourself in him let everything go let him bold let him rebuild you still have time can we um i'm gonna share that um so that's the the blessing um slide um you probably saw now that i was yeah sorry it's a bit small as well i've got a few different languages up there of number six very nice song that we that we sing um very nice song that that the world is singing singing as well denominational churches um is where you came from um i tell brother ben regularly that they are writing those songs and they don't even know they're writing it for us it's for us here to sing right now because we can identify and we've got a true identity and we can point to christ and we can say our all in all our all in all i believe the revealed open word in every tottenham um of that so i'll read it for you and i wanted to read that in in my native tongue i listen to the song and that's that's sort of the inspiration for this i listen to the to the maori to the um sort of a new zealand version of the song which a lot of churches sung together and there's one piece and right at the end where um when someone is reading um basically this as well and it and it really hit me and i said with with every nation every tribe every tongue may we may we give what we have may we may we with the identity that we have in us in christ may we be able to tell this to someone out there um and i'm thinking of and i'm thinking of russians and ukrainians may may we may we be able to pray for them and and and and proclaim this to them so i will read and as i read um you can just go to the next verses talia i don't have that little thingy at the front clicker the eraser you see the lord bless thee and keep thee in verse 25 the lord make his face shine upon me and be gracious unto thee the lord lift up his countenance be upon thee and give thee peace and this is so nice for me from israel and acts and i shall put my name upon the children of israel and i will bless them it um it yeah so sister tabu has done a little recording and hopefully we can share that with the um with a wider audience and with the church as well of the blessing and it's um it's really powerful and i think with the times that we're going through now may i say this you can only read this if you know who you are who you are don't don't read this if it's still you read this emphasis if it's him through you then you will understand and then you will you will you will i think you will receive revelation of the of the importance of why we read this why did i read yah basically obviously some prayer is he understood who he was yahweh called on the god of israel saying oh that thou would has blessed me indeed and enlarged my coast because at the front he was the honorable man more honorable than his brothers so he he knew that now that's confidence this is not cockiness that is go i want to increase my my land my coast and see this with your spiritual lens with identity that you have in christ increase my coast increase my spiritual increase the the the the what do you call it my exposure to to over the waters over the peoples uh increase my my my revelation that i can receive through your word so that i can speak and go out and say to people that do not know you that's why i read john because verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me and the works that i do greater works than than these shall ye you do me do you do everyone here those that's watching as well greater works you will do we are christ right now it's come over the pulpit so many times receive that identity know who you are we've got liz um this prayer request um yeah so may we start with i i will just start with um with with ukraine because um we've we have received some some testimonies from the and it has really spoken to me in my heart it could be because of my culture where i come from my previous identity like i mentioned now to you um but these people are it's it's it's real and on my way here on sunday um i i lay i felt flat i felt um i felt sad for the people and and and me and this is why i'm saying if if you're this guy but not yet through him um you'll you'll feel sad you'll feel sorry for people you feel you know um lord i read in your word it needs to come to fruition it it's been prophesied it will come so and that's the complicity of a christian heart is looking at at that from a excited point of view and looking that from a sad point of view but then this guy received one of the testimonies and received one of the the things and i can't remember i probably won't mention the brother's name that testified how the lord is protecting them within that time so now all of a sudden through him i identified with that people and and the lord just said and and that's why i wanted to sing tonight i was supposed to sing as well but thank you brother isaac helping me out um i love this family of god i wanted to sing that for them as well i love this family and all of a sudden it struck me last sunday when i read that testimony that's my family as well and i love them as well i can't even pronounce their names that doesn't matter because it's now that's connected to an earthly vessel but before the foundations of the earth and thank you brother ferdie we had a good chat and a and a bit of a chew on the fat after his sermon is like that representation of the of the idea that god had in his mind before the foundation of world of you he had that identity of you already we we weren't necessarily created we were already a thought that them as well they were the thought they were there with me before the foundation they and and we together loved each other so that struck me then all of a sudden now you could see me as a hypocrite then if i if i felt sad and i prayed for them and now all of a sudden it hit home that with all that mess there's still one that standing still one that's walking still one that's keeping all his his um his eggs in the heavenly basket if i can say that he is he's identified with christ he or she is sold out and they give their lives to them doesn't matter if if they are under attack doesn't matter if they sitting in peace and serenity they have found their true identity i'm sorry that if that um was all over the show um i just felt that's what the what the lord wanted to show me and i was trying to sort of relay that back to you you know i'm not not in any way a good preacher but praise the lord we are here and we still keep on walking um a couple of prayer requests i i would probably request if if i read these out and we start praying that we maybe create that atmosphere again and we can we can we can sing and we can worship um while we pray as well and i really want any everyone to sincerely pray and have have your needs in front of the king so that he can he can hear you speak that and by all means speak to the devil as well don't waste your time just tell him where he needs to go where he comes from and that he doesn't even have the keys of his own house a couple of prayer requests from brother imos and rabul papua new guinea sister sarah marum who is an old sister there is quite unwell they are also in a land dispute with the owners of the land that is right next to the church which could make it a problem for them to have church there now when i was reading this briefly this afternoon i was trying to think with every every situation and every prayer request that we receive we've got a testimony so this own little church we we had a spiritual land dispute here at one stage where the gangsters was next door and we were we were feeling unsafe i would say if we if we were in the flesh but we just said no more this is the lord's work this is what the lord's given us we've got so many testimonies of how he's real in this congregation we don't have to move they need to move no no no gangsters next door so i'll just leave it at that how many times have we read so we've got um jason's wife danae he accompanied her to um to hospital today for the test of breast cancer we've got a testimony we've got testimonies of healing in this church of people that had cancer and don't have cancer no more and we we hear that we hear that almost i would say on a weekly basis if we start listening to the churches all across the globe how many times is there people coming forward and say the lord's miraculously healed me and that's when when doctors even gave give up please make that real in your own life pray for the mashable family in south africa he was a pastor in hotel and was murdered and his house ransacked and that that that is the fight or flight that i'm that i was talking about and referring to is that that that must be in the word in the will of the lord as well and we don't know always the answers we don't know we don't know how to pray for this what do we what do we give that we have in abundance to them that's lost we know that they've they've got the overcoming power and they're sitting in a an absolutely better space than we are currently may that be real to us maybe as well so let us let us pray shall we heavenly father you've um you've been so good to us lord you've never failed us lord i've never been once seen you leave my hand and let my hand go how many times have i stopped stopped my walk law to to go a different way and where i wanted to leave your hand where i wanted to get my hand away from you just as a little one sometimes want to cross the road lord and and they want to do it themselves they want to they don't see the dangers they don't necessarily appreciate that we are doing it for safety lord how many times that uh we wanted to just rip our hand away and we wanted to walk that permissive will lord not ignor acknowledging that these these consequences to that to that road you've never failed us lord you've never failed me lord and and and the and the beauty of hindsight is is to look back and the testimony that you've given me lord the walk that i have now the liberty that i have within you lord the the identity identity lord the the the little plaque the little poster that's saying sold out god i'm sold out i believe no matter what i'm told no matter how it seems no matter what it costs i believe [Music] and if i look in it seems like it's broken i'll lay a hallelujah and if i look in it seems like it's over la la hallelujah on the altar [Music] he's a miracle working god he's a miracle he's a miracle he's a miracle working god he's a miracle he's a miracle he's a miracle working god a miracle working no matter what i see [Music] no matter what i feel no matter what i hear i believe no matter what i'm told no matter how it seems no matter what it costs i believe and if i look and it seems like it's broken i'll lay a it seems like it's over [Music] he's a miracle he's a miracle working god he's a miracle he's american he's a miracle working god he's a miracle he's a miracle he's a miracle working god a miracle working death defeating promised [Music] a miracle working breath defeating promise keeping god he's a miracle
