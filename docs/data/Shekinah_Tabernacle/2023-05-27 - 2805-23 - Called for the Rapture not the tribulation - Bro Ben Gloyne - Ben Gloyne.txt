foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign foreign [Music] foreign foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] good morning everyone how are you all doing you're Wide Awake have a good sleep sometimes we get good sleeps and we feel refreshed other days we don't get a very good sleep but we say we are refreshed anyway [Music] have a funny habit of like being tired at about six o'clock you know like last night at six o'clock I was so tired I was kind of falling asleep and then because I was very tired and then I've got an annoying habit of getting a second wind at about 11 o'clock and like three o'clock I'm still trying to go back to sleep I'm like man I thought I was tired at six o'clock but this is like seven eight nine ten eleven twelve you're talking like eight hours later and I'm still like awake but that's all right we we are here to praise the Lord this morning whether we're tired whether we're refreshed it doesn't really matter the Lord is always good you know we have these ups and downs on on life's journey but there is a place of rest that we are coming into and that's that's the that's the place that we are looking forward to so um there's a song that says in the toils of the way will seem nothing when I get to the end of the road when I get to the end of the way you know these these efforts that we make here are going to seem some are significant when we get there we're going to think man I'm so glad I made that effort the effort we made is not go even going to compare to what we get from that effort I believe so let's um let's stand this morning and just commit the service to the Lord we're in for a great time this morning I believe the Lord's gonna he's really gonna move in our service this morning we're going to have such a powerful time in the Lord we're I'm under great expectation and I believe that that you are too and yeah we're just I'm just so happy this morning I believe we're in for a great time have you noticed that and for the past while there's been such a powerful presence of God in our midst you know we just keep on drawing on the spirit of God and he keeps on he keeps on coming he he doesn't he's he's not sort of running out of energy to bless us we sometimes run out of energy but the Lord is not running out of energy or Spirit to pour out he's actually got he's got more than we could ever imagine so let's just continue to press him this morning Heavenly Father we're so grateful Lord that we can gather here Lord to just through receive of your spirit and your word again this morning Lord we know that you your words are spirit and they are life Lord so we just desire that you would Lord impart more of your spirit more of your word more of your life to us this morning Lord we don't just want this to be a club where we gather together and talk about a few things and have a chat Lord but this is a supernatural occurrence this morning where the spirit of God comes and moves and discerns hearts discerns the thoughts and intents of the Heart Lord and speaks to every life Lord heals heals people restores lives Lord uplifts encourages rebukes whatever your purpose of your word or your spirit might be towards us or we want to receive that this morning Lord say we receive You by Faith Lord that you're here in our midst already and we thank you heavenly father that

seats amen so Luke 17 20 um from wait what have I done oh my I don't maybe I shouldn't be allowed to drive Luke 17 26 and as it was in the days of Noah so shall it also be in the days of the son of man that had eat they drank their married wives were given a marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they build it so they were busy doing things amen but the same day that lot went out of Sodom at rain fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed praise God Amen we're living in this day it's a good day to be alive amen so let's just bow heads in a word of prayer this morning if you ever need you just want to raise it before the Lord you know the Lord knows our thoughts knows what we're going through he's mindful amen he hasn't forgotten one of us gracious father we love you so much Lord so thankful we can be in your presence this morning Lord as a redeemed people washed in your blood and we just want to pray Lord Lord that's our houses are we want more so we asked Lord may you just pour out more of yourself today O Lord into our lives make us more like you oh God may all the humanity and carnality and problems and things of this world just may they just go in the name of Jesus Christ and Lord may you put on flesh in our lives for your glory Lord May forgive us of our sins our wrongs Lord our trespassers cleanse us of our secret faults Lord May our whole lives just be covered in your blood Lord we plead your blood for the service Lord come and anoint speaker and hear our lord Jesus come and take control those who may be watching Lord by the way of the YouTube Lord anoint them as well father be their portion Lord touch the sick Lord and raise us up Lord into Heavenly places father in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you may have your seats uh this morning so I want to just go into this really about what kind of what are you listening to and what you're listening to is going to lead you to a place amen so here we are we have this opening scene where uh where the Lord Jesus would speak of um he would he would go back into history and he would speak of the days of lot speak of the days of Noah he'd say when you see those conditions upon the Earth that's the conditions that the Earth is going to be in when I am revealed amen and we know that we're living we don't need to stretch things out to say we're living in this day amen we're living in the days of Noah married wives given a marriage imagine divorce on every hand you know they're all troubled all those things going on there also in the days of lot those are the days of Sodom and Gomorrah we know we're living in those days amen the greatest cult you know there's a great cultural going on about who can use what bathroom all these kind of things but you know we're living in this kind of a day now I'm just gonna I'm just gonna kind of drop I'm probably gonna jump around quite a lot but that's kind of what I do but um so there's a there's a politician in the days of the French Revolution this guy Pierre I can't pronounce his last name he said citizens we have reason to fear that the revolution now he was actually uh in favor of the Revolution like Saturn will success will successively devour all of its children and finally produce despotism which is a tyranny with the calamities that accompany it now this is what he was saying he was for the revolution he got guillotined by the way in the revolution he's saying that the children of Revolution so Saturn was a was a God and and and he said that his children would would um would would basically Dethrone him and and destroy him so as soon as all of his children were born he devoured them this is what their myth says but he says that the children of Revolution will be devoured by the revolution that they came out of and this world has had a revolution it's turned down the message of Jesus Christ it's turned down the baptism of the Holy Ghost it did it in the 50s brother Bram told us this so what happening now is there's been a revolution against Christ himself so what's happening to everything that's been birthed out of this revolution is being devoured that's why this fussing this fighting there's trouble on every hand there's the left and the right and the extremes and the whatever camp that people put themselves in but they're devouring one another that's why this world is tearing itself apart but I'm so thankful that we're not called to be caught up in that amen we've heard a higher calling amen we've we've heard a message from the Throne of God to take us to the throne of God so don't get caught up in all this stuff that's going on in the world you know conspiracy theories for argument's sake it may be 100 true I'm not saying it is but even if it is it's not going to Rapture you amen all the all the covert stuff no covert stuff global warming stuff economic stuff all that stuff it's not going to Rapture one of us it's going to keep people here and it's designed to keep people here amen so you've got to be very careful about the anointing that's upon you and the message you listen to because whatever you're listening to will take you to a place that'll either take you into a Great Tribulation or it'll take you in a Rapture depends where you want to go what ticket have you got in your hand you know it's like if you want to fly to another country you buy that ticket amen because you want to go there is that right Amen to the same thing if you want to go to heaven your ticket's been bought for you by the blood of Jesus Christ but you got to go get the ticket you've got to go get the token because you want to go there if you want to go into a Great Tribulation while I say good luck to you you'll need all the luck you can get we don't need luck in this day because we've got the Holy Ghost but on that day they won't have the Holy Ghost they'll need luck to survive I remember we don't need luck we just need the anointing of the Holy Ghost to come down to a manifest his word in our lives do you know it's been you know you know this is actually Pentecost weekend hello it's been 50 days from Easter which is the day of Pentecost I'm so thankful we don't uh just have an anniversary of an event that happened about 2 000 years ago but we have a Pentecost today and aware of a living God today amen that anointed people amen moves them into a position manifests this word so don't be caught up in the all the stuff going on because what is it it's the children of Revolution being devoured by the revolution that's the religious non-religious atheist whatever more whatever camp they're devouring one another and I've never seen a single person who feeds off conspiracy theories that is bubbling that is happy that is full of full of love and peace and joy that's if you want something to steal your joy feed on that stuff it's like you're basically giving over your Victory if you want to lose all your Victory all of your joy in the Holy Ghost all of your love or your love for your family your love for people on the street your love for this world just feed on that stuff 100 of the time it'll cause people get all critical and crappy and fussy and what's happening you know because it's interesting you can tell what people eat spiritually you can tell what they've been listening to you can be tell what even what preacher they've been listening to because it'll manifest in their life but if they've been feeding off the body word of the son of man this should be be a bubbling coming forth there should be a joy there should be a thankfulness and a rejoicing I trust you not looking at me today not knowing what I'm talking about I mean I trust you know amen I know exactly what you mean Brother Band I mean I've been feeding on the word of God I've been drinking in his goodness I've been drinking from the fountain The Fountains come all over me I've been in the fountain swimming and rejoicing hallelujah praise God I trust that's what you've been doing this ain't no Pie in the Sky folks this is reality amen this world you know we were told 60 years ago at least that the world's falling apart I mean what everyone oh well this is One World Government blah blah blah blah that's old news that's all news you've just dug up an old newspaper put it in color and there it is and people say wow this is all happening it was prophesied it was happening John sword and symbol form of the Book of Revelation now we're seeing it come it's a manifestation but I just wanna I'm just going to put this in where are we you know you make an order of slides but hey it's ain't really going to happen now people are so afraid we're gonna basically we'll we're basically driving and it's a slow motion car crash you know the bride and just how everything's happening in the church and basically this is what people kind of get under this anointing of fear wow they see a corner turn or something and they just say we're going in that ditch now where you're looking is where you you know I remember when I first got on a quad bike I was yay big and the quad bike was small and I kept crashing all over the place and my dad told me some very good advice where you're looking is where you'll drive right right so I got back on that quad bike and I realized look I'm going here so I look there now I'm turning this way so I'm looking I didn't crash anymore why because where I was looking is where I drove so if you're looking at the world you're going to crash into the world Amen and the world doesn't see him no more but ye shall see me so if you're not of the world you'll see Christ in your day but if you're under the anointing of the world you won't see him no more Hallelujah I trust you under the anointing of the Holy Ghost so you see him now not just back in the 60s where brother Brown was here and the message no today he's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen so if you're caught up in the things of the world you won't see him but if you're anointed by the Holy Ghost you see him Hallelujah so now we're all scared all the World's Gonna you know the devil's gonna shut us all up and everything's gonna be you know all these things but no brother man comes down to the end of his ministry and he says and his church stands alone we stand alone with Christ do we not amen I'm talking about the church or the bride around the world Amen we stand with him she is not hooked up with nothing but she but he uh but he was identified by God being the body that God dwelt in and the church is identified by his body doing the same thing she is his body the manifested truth of his promised word for the last days and she and she stands alone stands by it that's why the devil's howling these great organizations so set up something to close her up they'll never do it amen she'll be taken up not closed up amen say everything's been set up to try and close us up they'll never do it it doesn't matter how much the devil schemes and Rants and Raves do you see it on the internet people rant and Rave about the message being false I'm sorry it caused me to meet the god of the Bible it caused me to see the promises of the Bible manifested about life it gave me the Holy Ghost change my nature Transform Me brought Jesus out of History I'm sorry you can have your arguments all you want this message is true because I've tasted and seen the Lord is good amen it's not an argument of the mind it's a New Birth by the Holy Ghost amen that's why the carnal mind can never understand then the word but the problem is everyone is presented with the Holy Ghost but if you turn it down you go into chaos if you if you receive him you'll have peace forevermore I mean you may have trouble in your life either peace in your soul and you know where you're going that's a good deal I think that's a real good deal are there any are there any strings attached no you just have Victory after Victory sure the devil's on your case but hey God gets on his case if the devil gets on your case amen because remember we serve a very big God so so they won't close us up up amen we'll be taken up she is now risen by the power of the Vindicated word promised to her amen now the bride holds that promise what's that promise he told me he would return to after me I'll believe it uh-huh yes sir to meet her headship her Redeemer her husband or King her Lord her love of her Savior and the provided me meeting place with me here he's already provided all the way to get there amen it's like I've never seen anyone be upset when they get a ticket to go around the world traveling all right what I gotta get on this planet no they're excited what am I going to see where am I going Hallelujah you know it's the same thing with the believer we should just be happy in spite of what's going on in life remember we this will never Walking with God does not take trouble away it actually brings trouble on the scene but it caused that trouble to be defeated amen so it turns into a victory and a rejoicing Hallelujah so we shouldn't be all caught up well you say well what about the mark of the beast you'll become a time when we can't buy or sell you know that's after the Rapture that's after the Rapture that comes into place so why are we so consumed by something that's going to happen when we're not here unless we're anointed to be there see that's what we're going to be very careful what we're feeding on because these are people that are being prepared for the Great Tribulation there are Christian people that will stand and give their lives in the Great Tribulation right the Bible tells us that but there is a bride that goes in the Rapture before the tribulation but the message you're feeding on will dictate where you go amen it's it's it's really that simple amen if you're feeding on the word of the hour you'll be taken it amen in the last sign of the hour which is the body change amen praise God now when he gets all the money under control sure then he'll break the Covenant with the juices Daniel said here I'm just going to read this because I want this to really sink in in the midst of the last half of the 70 weeks of Daniel then brother what will he do he'll have all the world trade and commerce impact with the world because he'll hold the wealth of the world completely during that time during that time them two prophets will rise on the scene and call that 144 000 then will take place in the mark of the beast of Revelations 13. we'll sit in because he'll he he holds all the Commerce trade everything in um of the world and what will take place in the mark of the beast will come in that no one can buy or sell except he there's the mark of the beast thank God the church will be enjoying a great three and a half years in glory won't have to go through that Hallelujah so why worry about something that you're not here to face I mean it's really that simple you think about it just say if there's other news is a great category five storm coming into Wellington but you're not here why get all troubled about what's going to happen to you if you're not here but you're not here so it can't happen to you I mean it's really I don't have more plainer I can make it but if you you know it's just like oh there was a big car crash out here on the road why stress about it if you're not there you're not on the road at the time you're actually here you're not there and it's like this oh the Beast is going to take over and there's going to be all sure he's going to do it but he does it when we go up remember remember the Holy Ghost is here holding them back that he can gather his redeemed to himself Hallelujah so why you know we can just praise God and be happy we laugh all the way to the bank as the saying goes why because God has called us not to go in a Great Tribulation but to go in the Rapture this message is a Rapture call it is the rapture call right it is not a tribulation anointing Hallelujah you see now you see if we go back to Genesis 18 as it was in the days of lot we know that Abraham was waiting on the plains of memory for the promise he was under expectation for the promised son to appear Hallelujah they were looking for Isaac he'd been waiting for 25 years but here he was I mean but Sarah's heart needed to be turned from unbelief to Faith because remember Abraham believed God but it took a while for Sarah to catch up and sometimes it takes a while for us to catch up but as long as we catch up amen if we're part of the promise we'll catch up Hallelujah but you say Lord make the word real to me amen don't make it just something in my mind or someone else's you see someone else dance and rejoice you should say Lord I want that kind of victory in my life Hallelujah so so you know he would you know Abraham was there that he saw three men come towards him and he addressed one of them as my Lord and if you continue reading down Genesis there you know it says that two of them went down to Sodom but the Lord stayed with Abraham and told him what he was going to do well because it was God in flesh and there was two angels and flesh as well God can create bodies for angels to step into if he wants to amen so you know didn't they ate food and they you know and then now it came to a point where where where where God would say where is Sarah thy wife I'm just paraphrasing this you can read it I'm sure everyone's familiar with the story you know where is Sarah thy wife and you know in the tent behind you and you know and God see is certainly according to time of life I'm going to visit you you're going to have the promised son time of life speaks of a woman not a man and Sarah laughed within herself she's in the tent behind God God came down in flesh she she laughed within herself saying how can I have a child how can I have pleasure with my Lord because my Lord is old also then the Lord said to Abraham why did Sarah laugh so God came down in flesh and discerned what Sarah was doing in the tent behind him and this was exactly the same sign that Jesus did to the woman at the well knew exactly how many husbands she had you know many places in the gospel said that she uh um he he rather the Lord knew their thoughts and would you know say behold in Israel without no goal speaking to Philip and you know Nathaniel and different ones and you see see this was this was God come down and made flesh this is what happened now they were looking for a visitation that God would turn them young again that they could have that promised son that their hearts would be turned to Faith because Sarah doubted the promise until this visitation and I'd say it'd be pretty much the same thing with you and I or the church for 2000 years has been looking for the return of the promised son but our hearts had to be turned by a prophetic message that we could receive him in the air I mean because remember that God could you know it was easy for God to turn their lives young again that's one thing but but he had to change their bodies for them to have the promised son to receive the promise and it's the same thing with you and I God can make us all 18 again or if you're not 18 make you 18. right he can do that but he he's got to change these bodies that we can meet him in the air we can change Dimensions amen so when the Lord came down and spoke to Abraham there and Sarah it was their visitation that she would receive faith that they could receive the promised son now during this time I mean two of those angels we know went down to get lot out of Sodom because Abraham was there waiting for the promise to be fulfilled but lot was caught up in the politics of Sodom it says in the Bible that righteous lot was fixed by the conversation of the sodomites and different things so he was he was troubled by what was going on inside him he was even the mayor of the city he sat in the gate which is a place of judgment amen but his witness became totally ineffective to what was going on in Sodom and Gomorrah it became so ineffective that even his sons-in-laws laughed at him when he said these angels would come to take us out this place is going to burn amen so so so he he was righteous compared to the sodomites but his he couldn't change the cycle they were going into and sadly this is the same thing today we cannot return this nation to Christ America will never return to Christ on a big scale they've turned him down we can never christianize the world again amen that age is over amen I'm sorry to say it but that age is over there's still elect ones here and there they've got to come in sure we're going to keep seeking them until the last one comes and then we can go home amen so we should have a burden for lost souls absolutely whosoever will let them come if you've got a willing Heart Lord I'm gonna come I'm not worried he doesn't care what condition you're in what you've been through what you're thinking amen just come to him and let him change your life amen but then brother Brown would pick this up and say now we're living in this day and and he would speak about you know the two angels who went down to the side of me it was quite a few times he just says they're Billy Graham and old Roberts went down but he speaks about Jack Schuller and all these great men out there these great revivalists they have to because they're because they're jerking out they're jerking out people out of Sodom so there's a great time when the prophet was here great revivalists would sweep the land but it was a message to get the nominal church out of Destruction and so he says it's not just it's not just all Roberts and Billy Graham but there are other men anointed because remember it's an anointing it's not a man it's an anointing that goes out to catch a people Amen to these ones were Anointed with the spirit here to bring the nominal church out of Destruction right and this is and so it's the same thing today there's still people on the Earth that are preaching to get people out of Destruction amen but we know Abraham's message was different to lot's message Abraham was waiting for the promised son the promised son wasn't promised a lot though lot was saved amen no but the but the promised son was promised to Abraham and it's the same thing under the true message of the hour amen the promised son the Lord Jesus Christ is promised to the bride of Christ amen he is promised to her amen and this word has come to prepare us that we can receive him in the air that's why he would say in John 14 let not your hearts be troubled you believe in God believe also in Me and My Father's House of many mansions I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I'll come again and receive you unto myself that where I am not where you are not on this Earth but where I am in that Dimension you shall be also so that's what this message is as Christ Has Come Again revealed himself again what to receive a bride to himself to carry her away I mean that's the message of the hour in a nutshell Hallelujah Andy glad he's come to carry you away I mean he has come to receive you unto yourself unto himself you say well I'm in sin I'm Richard I'm done horrible things God don't care about that his blood takes care of everything his blood takes care of every trouble mind battle complex pain hurt his blood takes care of it all Hallelujah I believe that don't you there's nothing too hard for the Lord amen praise the Lord hallelujah amen amen but when he come down to Sodom look what he did at Sodom and Sodom he referred to uh to that for this age now remember the sodomites were Gentiles notice and there come three men one day to Abraham there's always three classes of people as unbelievers make Believers and Believers we still have them today that's right unbelievers make Believers Believers sodomites lotites and abrahamites Abraham had the promise Hallelujah we have a promise we have a promise of a rapture we have a promise of dancing on streets of God we have a promise of a place that the marriage supper of the Lamb amen we have a promise he'll never leave us nor forsake us amen it got a bit difficult there with Abraham and Sarah on the planes of memory they didn't have the well-watered parts and they are but but hey they they were living under a promise and that's the main thing amen that God remember it wasn't Abraham making a promise with God it was God making a promise with Abraham and that's the big difference it's not necessarily us saying Lord I'll serve you and do all I can for youth no it's the Covenant he made with you first I mean we just do that out of reaction to what he's already done for us should I just go down to second gear Maybe this has got the hill a little bit because we're ascending I mean this morning praise a little bit you've got to realize that God made a covenant with you and I and and that's because remember we could never remember you know God with Moses and your children of Israel said if you will I will yeah it was conditional man always fails right that's why there's Wars and strife and trouble there's no agreements between nations you know there's no peace why because there's Fallen man involved but but that's why God said I'm going to make this Covenant unconditional with you Abraham I have made you the father of many nations amen and then he had no children he had no ability to do it but he said God said I have made you thus and it's very important that we confess what God has made us even if it may be contrary to the present state that we think we're in amen because there was Abraham impossible to have a child amen couldn't have it Sarah couldn't have a child but God said I've made you a father of Nations that's why I'm changing your name but he'd say no but see thing he didn't confess the condition of himself he didn't repeat back to God his confession you know that this is how I am and this is impossible no it says the Bible said and he believed God that's why it's very important that faith is preached I mean that your faith is ministered to to one another amen that where The Virtuous spotless bride of Jesus Christ that Christ died on Calvary for you and I that everything that the devil could try and hold you to this Earth with has been annihilated by the blood of Jesus Christ amen that you're more than an overcomer I mean you're built to overcome this age hallelujah we're built amen we're purpose-built to overcome this age amen God has built us amen that we will not fail we will win this war why because Christ has already one of that down Calvary amen that we're walking in Victory and it doesn't matter what you're facing you know we're actually talking about seeing God in nature driving to church this morning and you know and you know I just look at The Rim attackers you know you know I started rejoicing in my heart I think praise God there's a mountain of God holy there's a Mount Zion Hallelujah but also I thought about says in um Zechariah says you know what are you great Mountain before this is a zeruberable you'll become a plane I mean it doesn't matter how big the enemy may be in front of you it's going to become a plane I mean there's not some big obstacle you cannot across would go over but God will make it a plane that you can just walk across it as level ground Hallelujah it doesn't matter it wouldn't matter it was the whole Himalayas in front of you it can look that big you can't even see the see the summit but God will make it a plane Hallelujah because God said we will stand God said we'll be victorious God said the enemy will be under our feet that's what God Said I mean God said you're made in my image amen washed in my blood that's what God has said it's very important because that's what to confess that because that's God's confession of you you mean we're just a parrot in a way yes we are but it actually anchors in our heart we're repeating what God said about you and I don't take that in a bad way saying parapara just repeat things I don't know if they believe what they say but we believe what we say about ourselves Hallelujah amen Abraham had the promise he was the elected called out group that had separated himself you know people get offended with that kind of statement how do you say you're the called out ones well I've been called out I don't know what you're doing but this is what I'm doing I Heard a Voice one day I was drunk at Uni and making home brew and doing all kind of evil stuff but then I Heard a Voice I put on some headphones saying good morning friends and God changed my life and he called me out lord said come out of here well okay I'm coming well you know well I've been called out so but people get offended by that kind of statement but we are we are the Bible says we're elected predestination is not a yucky word it's quite a nice word actually because I've realized if God predestined me before the foundation of the world then the devil can't do anything in time to stop that predestination hi Lewis I'm just happy about that you know I trust you're happy too amen some people get offended but I just say praise God thank you Lord I'm happy about this this is a great deal I don't know why he did it for me but he did it for me so I accept it you know I don't I don't try and throw my own Humanity you know in the way and say Lord you can't do this no if he can speak the 100 billion stars into existence and let there be and all these things created and you know part the Red Sea and quench the fire and doing credit raise the dead and he can save me then you know really honestly let's just let's just put this in Balance you know you know this world has got totally no perspective you know you go down uh I was going to say a monkey hole but a rabbit hole of conspiracy stuff you know it's the enemy you're saying look at this yeah look at this monkey hole I'm going to call it a monkey hole because it's a monkey hole all that it may be all true but it's still a monkey hole because it doesn't make faith it doesn't increase your faith one bit you know you could actually someone could stand here and actually expose all the evils of the world that one raps you if you know Christ he'll wraps you the only one that can wraps you is the message of the hour which is Jesus Christ amen amen praise God where are yes I'm just I'm just enjoying myself right now you know amen we've been separated amen hallelujah from the things of the world cause he was relying upon the promise of God he was relying on the promise of God are you relying on the promise of God have you judged him faithful have you judged and faithful he's more than able to do that which he has promised to you I trust I trust you're in that condition Lord if you brought me out you're not going to leave me here amen you're going to leave me in this state maybe you may even hate your own personality but God made you that way Hallelujah I think we stop wrestling with ourselves and say Lord you built me this way you didn't make a mistake you may think you just made out of spare parts but God needed someone real out of the box you know Hallelujah praise God yeah I'm so glad God's not a cookie cutter just makes us all the same you have the same kind of personality and you got to sing the same and praise God I'm so glad I'm here to provide balance you know that's what my dad says about things but I'm here to provide balance everyone else can sing I can't sing we've got balance all right maybe we don't need balance anyway praise the Lord notice now see I'm just going to read BC see the three that went to meet Abraham look like men dust on their clothes professed they were strangers two of them went down to preached Asylum trying to find 10 people remember went down to Asylum the lukewarm Church of modern Billy Graham or so forth down inside and preaching the gospel blinding the People by the gospel that's what the Evangelist Billy Graham and Oral Roberts and many of these Great Men of God has did shook the people see it's an anointing it's not just those two there's an anointing and that anointing is still here to get a people ready to go into a Great Tribulation that's why people who are Preppers they're anointed man yeah they're inspired man we've got to get ready man we're going to survive this thing the Beast is going to come and money's gonna collapse and all these that it's all true that's right but they're anointed to go into that because that's their allotment yes but the bride of Christ that's not your destination amen you know how you can take you know you know Google Maps gives you different options right you know sometimes you know you can go this way around Lac taupo sometimes this way sometimes this way around through Hawke's Bay can be all crazy kind of ways but you'll end up at the same destination yeah and it's like the bride and the foolish version all these different ones that because remember Heaven is not a communistic state that everyone's the same it's not just the bride and there's no one else that's not how God works right but we're all going to end up in the same destination amen I'd rather just take a rapture that's me you know maybe you know I just yeah I'll take the easy way Hallelujah why is it easy why because God changes his body I go to enjoy a wedding supper but it actually has fun but you got to really actually ignore that kind of thinking because in reality it's I get to walk with my Lord and the fullness of his word and the fullness of his power and the fullness of his anointing all that he is I can know right now in this flesh I can walk with them and talk with them have a relation with them like no one else can because the foolish virgin they don't know him like we do that's right Hallelujah they don't walk with him like we do why because we're husband and wife we are married we're United amen he talks to me like he doesn't talk to them that's right Hallelujah you say well you're just putting them in that box no I'm just happy that he's become one with me this is just my experience okay just be happy for me I trust you're the same kind of boat you know man man the Lord met me he's changed my life his word is alive he's just changed me when I think there's no way I could ever be changed my desires I don't know how this could happen he just comes along and does it you're gonna say Lord just take my life and he just because I rearranged things in your heart and man it's incredible isn't it amazing that's why it's supernatural you know hell it's not a natural just a mind trying to change your mind and thinking but God changes our hearts Hallelujah now where was I going with this praise God see so notice the sign that he performed he discerned the thoughts of Sarah in the tent amen tell what she was doing turned us back to her Jesus said this would repeat in the days of the coming of the son of man we see Billy Graham we see the ready we see the fire ready to fall the church looking for a promised son here we are everything just exactly in line waiting for that hour the promised son remember the last time that Abraham saw and we who are born of the spirit of Christ Abraham's Royal seed Jesus pardon me promised that the Royal Seed of Abraham would see the same sign that their father Abraham seen before the promised son came there wasn't one more sign Abraham right away Sarah became mother and Isaac arrived the last sign was God manifested in a man's flesh so that's why brother Brown would come to the discernment lines he says now I'll turn my back like God's back was to Sarah in the tent and he began to tell people their address and their name and why they're there it was details details details saying that same sign is now repeated in this end time right to prove now what he was preaching wasn't just nice idea or something controversial or something more right-wing or fundamental than the rest no it was God coming down proving saying this is my messenger this is my word amen I am here to call you to myself not to a man but to Christ himself hallelujah amen so that's been repeated in this day and you know if someone's fully surrendered to God the word still discerns through them yes yes I mean they don't need to point someone out like a prophet say I see the pillow fire over you and this and this and this but while they're preaching or even while they're having Fellowship God can discern what's going on in someone's life and they don't even know what's going on but the person hearing it knows exactly what's been going on how many times have people been driving up the street having a conversation that comes over here or in the Sunday school or something it's just been Supernatural that way why because that say because it's an anointing right it's not just a prophet it's an anointing of Christ himself coming into the church Hallelujah that's why it's so incredible you know when we can think about you know it's been 50 days from Pentecost you know but you know we have a real Pentecost amen amen we have a real Pentecost we we have not we are we don't just have a painted fire now I've got a picture of Pentecost here we're going to show that soon but you know so we we have heard a word I just I just really want to hammer this in a little bit amen the world has been prepared for a tribulation the believer the make-believer unbeliever whatever and now I'm not talking about the bride being believed but those people are prepared for a Great Tribulation the bride of Christ is being prepared for a Rapture what are you listen what are you opening your ears to right because it'll take you one way or another because this world is falling apart you know I don't need to tell you that you can see economics is falling apart families are falling apart mental health has fallen apart peace between nations trades falling apart all these things are going on it's nothing new it was prophesied a very long time ago and now we just see it coming to manifestation so now why should we be caught up with the people who are fussing and fighting about remember we have a higher calling our calling is to find God's people whosoever will you know this may sound a bit crazy but I would be happy to have a church just even a foolish virgin because they get salvation right as long as someone gets saved I'm happy God whatever position they're called to that's between God and them right but I'd be happy whosoever will come and meet the Lord if we can if we can help someone just a little step closer to God I say praise the Lord that was well worth doing ministered to but Lord may you Minister through me to that person amen they may just have a made these give their hearts the law that's as far as they go praise God as long as they've gone that far and God can start working in their lives may they get baptized well praise God God can continue working their lives you know so we should never just say well it's either the bride or nothing we need to get that no I don't think we have that thinking in our mind I pray we don't but it's not just the Bride of no one right God has people everywhere they're called to different callings let's be a light to everyone and help everyone but if we get caught up in what the world has been caught up in well we'll be devoured as well and we don't want to be chewed up by the world see every everything is falling apart every nation's looking for someone or some system that could bring them out of it see that's to hold them together they were so corrupted they they know not they um that they couldn't hold out the way they were going they was looking for something to hold them together if that isn't the picture of our world today and this is in 1963 but I'll say today amen if it isn't a picture of our world today I don't know the world it's the picture of our world today everything is looking for a system or something to hold us together it's the picture of it today it was looking for some system or something that would keep it from falling apart as it was then so it is now again it's repeated again every movement under Heaven is looking for a Superman to rise like we want to bring well not we America Republicans want Trump back or they want yeah the the Democrats what some Superman or some Superwoman to rise they want someone to step on the scene that can fix all the problems they'll get there Superman we already have our Messiah right the bride has there Superman Hallelujah and he's not an alter ego that has a troubled past and does all these things by night no he's a resurrected Jesus Christ Hallelujah so if so if he is the king of your life if he is your anointed Messiah amen your life won't fall apart with the world amen but you see what happens is people try and actually Christians especially today they don't realize they're actually working against the plan of God Simon Peter was a very zealous man there's a picture of so this is Simon cutting cutting the guy's ear off uh malcus's ear off in the Garden of Gethsemane you know he will see but the thing is Peter didn't realize that what he was doing right there was actually trying to stop the word of God be fulfilled see there he was he was zealous he thought he was defending the word defending the Faith by taking a sword and trying to cut his ear off remember he wasn't trying to just cut his ear off he was trying to cut his head off but he's a fisherman so he wasn't too good with the sword right he wasn't trained the right way to use the sword to cut his head off so he cut his ear off and this is what many zealous Christians do is they as they try and defend Christ but they just cut off people's ears that they can't hear anymore they can't hear anymore see but see the thing is Peter didn't realize but he was actually doing an antichrist thing right here because he was trying to stop Jesus go to Calvary though it looked good he could have had a selfie there look I'm defending the faith I'm at this rally I'm doing this I'm blogging this kind of stuff but you see all he was doing was trying to stop the word being fulfilled and that's why Jesus said there in in verse 11. put up thy sword into thy sheath the cup which my father has given me shall I not drink it right so he's basically saying why put away your sword stop trying to hinder the word of God and this one but the thing is Peter didn't have the Holy Ghost here this was Peter before Calvary and and so Peter now is like many nominal Christians today caught up in the politics of the world trying to stand for the truth but they're just caught up in actually a movement that is actually fundamentally Antichrist because he was say anything against the word is Antichrist see so he was being Antichrist there he needed to go to Pentecost amen so let's not and remember there's only very few people in the world compared to the world's population and Christendom that actually have the Holy Ghost so people always side for organization and understanding that way instead of being led by the spirit of God see if Peter had the Holy Ghost here he wouldn't have done this amen amen so but you see see the thing is we've got to be very careful many Christian people so called who are preaching against the One World Government all these things they are not Holy Ghost filled because all they say is look at these look at all the scary things out there but there's no way of Escape see some people seem to think that we can somehow trick the devil and we kind of trick past them and get into a rapture you know try and try to try and sneak past him look over there devil I see what you're doing yeah I got a body change this is not it's not going to work that way you can't outsmart the devil brother Brown said you can't outsmart them the only way to overcome them is by the holy ghost in your life Hallelujah but as I said there and you see the thing is these things are put on social media and everything to try and get our attention brother EDM would speak so and you know in his day he had TV and radio right he says and this morning while I was listening a few days ago to a broadcast it seemed to wanted to tell that creation was just saying um from some ashes blowing together and some phosphate and a few chemicals of the earth and the warm sunshine create the germ of life and brought out life how ridiculous when the sunshine will kill any Gem of Life lay a germ out in the sunshine or kill it immediately and there's no such a thing but Satan was trying to punch that at me and after I had taken my little Rebecca to school this morning and on the road back I started to turn the radio on again and I thought I would get into that stuff again so I just turned it back off so you got to realize these things it's not just radio it's on every media platform on the planet well what is it trying to do is trying to steal your joy it's trying to steal your Victory it's trying to steal your overcoming power and your love for God that's what it's trying to do but it's so it could be so invasive because this world is so connected but you see instead of actually no I'm going to listen to that I'm going to counter that I'm going to write an angle I'm going to write a blog I'm going to don't get caught up in that stuff there goes your bubbling you want to degas a Christian get them to listen to this stuff right but we should be bubbling all the time joy unspeakable full of Glory I mean as I said you know a while ago I've never seen a Christian who feeds on that kind of stuff and is happy they're always discontented they get all tense and stressed and burdened for the wrong things and word and all those problems all they see is those things and they can't see the wood for the trees because they can't see the very one who came to Rapture them is walking with them the same one that gave them joy in the beginning of their walk is still with them but because they've become so fixated on all that stuff they lose their Victory see the devil doesn't care how message we say we are he doesn't care how saved we think we are he doesn't care how much we think we know the Lord as long as God isn't living through us he wants to stop the life of God that's what he's doing he's not actually interested in stopping religion or churches he wants to stop the life of God putting on flesh that's what see see brother Brown said that actually on Pentecost you know when that happened the devil didn't roll out of bed nothing but then when the when when Peter and John went to the gate beautiful and saw the leper there and said Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have I give unto thee and they raise him up he received strength and someone who was crippled by the door of the church ran and leaping and praising God that caused all the guns of hell to come out against the disciples why because what Jesus had done was now on them manifesting itself Christ was now in a multi-member body Hallelujah so he just wants to stop the Life of Christ manifesting through us well how did he stop that by pouring trying to pour all this stuff into us that we lose our joy we lose our freedom in the spirit we lose our love for God because the thing is if you if you want to help someone love the Lord if you really want to pull them out of the fire love the Lord and then that love will go to them amen Hallelujah we have so much good to talk about we that's why we have eternity to talk about it because we don't have enough time now the Lord has been so good to us amen he's been faithful and true and he will continue to be faithful and true amen he brought us out of car wrecks and trouble and hardship and sickness and disease and worry and strife and trouble and different spirits to try and lash themselves onto us he's delivered us out of them all Hallelujah and he will not stop doing that he's he's in the business of saving amen he's very dedicated in his business he's in the business of Deliverance and bringing Liberty and freedom amen if we sit there in our minds on something else we're worried about the symptoms look at the one who can deliver from the symptoms hallelujah amen but you see now God came down in human flesh in this day and revealed himself the ministry of the son of man but that Ministry is not finished amen no that Ministry is not finished none because the son of man is still being revealed amen through the people amen Luke 17 30 and that day when the son of man was revealed that is not finished many people just put that on brother Brown's Ministry no it's in the bride Ministry now I mean that same crisis now in you and I yeah Holy says the son of man back in the church again revealed in human beings Hallelujah that's you by the way you he's talking about you man you maybe not have been alive when he preached that but God knew you were coming God knew I've got a I've got a prepared vessel I've got a bunch of prepared vessels Hallelujah they may be born in different parts of the Earth but they're going to move here amen and God's good I'm going to vindicate myself through their lives to prove the power of the blood to prove the cross Works to prove I can deliver and save and not just save but keep Hallelujah not just deliver but keep them from falling Hallelujah and if they fall they'll get back up they're those kind of vessels I mean if they get discouraged amen they don't stay in their discouragement too long you may have been discouraged for years but God can break that cycle this morning I mean God is still faithful and true there's nothing too hard for him it's impossible for him to be defeated his purpose will never be defeated and his purpose that he had put you upon the Earth in this time to be an overcomer hallelujah amen you say well I've lost a lot of battles that's actually okay it's they that win the war had the victory march it's they that when the war had the victory match but you've got to remember we should have a victory march right now because Jesus conquered everything that down Calvary he conquered all sickness he conquered every Spirit he conquered hell death in the grave Satan doesn't have the keys to his own house I mean if you have the Holy Ghost now you'll seal to the day of your Redemption amen yourself to your destination you have the ticket in your hand you cannot miss the boarding call actually we're actually sitting in the plane already I don't know if you've realized it I remember we're actually in the Gods Not Just A Gospel Ship but a gospel plane if you've got the holy ghost in your life amen you are in your seat amen you gotta you know see see hey hey take her for a plane it isn't just uh if you've got this ticket no name on it sit wherever you want there's your name there's your seat number if someone gets in your seat you have a right to say hey you are in my seat there's no double bookings on This Plane by the way okay there's no double bookings I mean so if someone tries to take your place you're right say get out of my place and who is the squatter that tries to sit in our seat the devil Satan get out of my seat amen I have a seat by the right hand of Christ amen because we're joining us with him get out of my seat devil you have no right to try and think you have dominion over me I have dominion over you Hallelujah so I think we can have a victory march today our lives should be a victory march I know and whom I have believed I'm going to heaven because he said he said I'm going Hallelujah let's just be happy for a bit this morning amen when eternity is rolled in yeah where are our troubles going to be where are my battles going to be where's that devil going to be he's going to be Cinders and ashes in a lake of fire Hallelujah Hallelujah now if we have a revelation that we're there I mean we we're going to make it we have a body already in the heavens right we have we have the ticket we can't lose it that's assured who has that Assurance in their heart doesn't matter what happens in life I know I'm going because he called me to go I'm not trying to get there My Own Strength no it's not him that will for us but God chose mercy and he's shown us abundant Mercy in this day of abundant darkness and evil there's Greater Grace is always greater his love is always greater his Mercy is always greater than the darkness upon the Earth it's in this day when the world is so dark and wicked he says I'm still going to call my people out it's never going to be too hard for me I'm going to call them out because why his grace is so great in this hour hallelujah amen if this message has found you Grace has found you Hallelujah if he has found you if you've had a Pentecost crisis found you amen you say well I don't know if my experience is big enough or what's your desire when you really peel all the layers off you want to serve him do you love him do you want to walk with him that's God that's not you that's God that's not learned behavior that's God God put it there the devil can't take it out God put it there she can just Rejoice with that and take that desire say Lord I want more of you Hallelujah amen can we Rejoice this morning you don't know what I'm going through that's fine you go through it see that's what's cool you know they went through the Red Sea they went through the wilderness they didn't Caleb and Joshua went through the wilderness they went through the Jordan they went through Jericho they went through AI they went through every battle that's why you can even Rejoice man I'm going through something praise God you're going through it because you're not going to stay there you're going through it's like you when you drove you guys on the capitol you went through transmission Gully you're non-transmission girl you went through it at least I'm going through a troll that's fine but you're going through the trial see many times you think man we're in this trouble no you're going through the trial man some trials may seem long I remember being a kid in the car driving for hours man are we there yet and you know you get so like this but you went through you ended up at your destination why because there was someone driving the vehicle you're in and you've got to realize God is driving your vehicle amen because remember we don't just have the mechanics of all the all the doctrines all these things where the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost to make this thing fire and move amen so now it's my brother I said the rising of the Santa takes a spark to prove what's in the tank is gasoline Hallelujah and we have the spark of the Holy Ghost amen we have the ignition of the Holy Ghost to prove that this word Works amen and it will drive you to Healing it will drive you to Deliverance it'll drive you to the baptism of the Holy Ghost it'll drive you to joy and peace and love it'll drive you to everything the devil's taken from you it will be restored back Hallelujah Hallelujah so we can just Rejoice this morning we have a Victory Day Hallelujah why Pentecost was a Victory Day to the disciples I mean it was a Victory Day to the world because it was a dispute is he alive is he not and he proved himself alive can he dwell in humans again hey many proof that Hallelujah Amir was asking the question this is blood powerful enough to cleanse the human heart that God can dwell there in that throne room of the human soul amen and he proved it that day Hallelujah I'm sure he's proved it in your life amen because of the question Lord can you dwell on me can can I be one of your stones from your temple and he comes and fills you with his presence he proves you're one of my Stones you're part of my building Hallelujah Hallelujah so we can have a victory day today amen Hallelujah praise the Lord hallelu it's going to finish with this now I said about the anointing that was on uh the two angels went down to Sodom that anointing us here to to to prepare people for a tribulation but as the anointing was on you know God himself became flesh there spoke to Abraham and Sarah changed their bodies changed from unbelief to Faith to have the promised son so God has come down in flesh in this day through the prophet Messenger to reveal himself to turn our hearts to Faith amen that goggin dwell in Us in faith right he can walk in us and now he came brother Brown said that that I think it was in the breach message he said the seventh angel which was him was on Earth at the time of this coming when the mighty Angel would come down Hallelujah and brother Barham through his mess you said he said the church fell from Pentecost we've got to get back to Pentecost right and what is the Pentecost the indwelling of the Holy Ghost I mean to write a book of Acts that God leads individuals not just a church not just a Ministry but we're individually led by the Holy Ghost amen signs and wonders are done amen we can see a book of Acts written we could Hallelujah if we put it down on paper we would say this is this is chapter one I mean you know praise God isn't that true Hallelujah we've seen him live and he's still going to keep living yeah yeah so I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with the cloud and as rainbow uh uh and a rainbow was upon his head his face as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of Fire amen and he had in his hand a little book open and set us right foot upon the sea is left foot upon the earth now we don't have time to go into it but you read in the Book of Revelation that the Beast Powers come out of these two places right because the sea is multitudes of people's tongues and Nations right that b systems come out well it's Rome right it's the Roman Catholic church and her daughters it's a political system not just religious right but then also but then also that that Beast that looked like a Lambert speakers the dragon came out of the earth America right they are working together yes you say oh no that's terrible no but listen where are his feet one his feet were his pillars of Fire whatever the day of Pentecost you could say his feet came down his body came down right well the head chip came down but wherever his feet are in you and I right because he's the pillar of fire comes down into you and I now where do whose feet stand he stands on those two places that those Powers come out of that's why we can Rejoice we don't have to be all caught up in fear of all the devil's going to get us and we're going to be you know he's going to trap her somewhere no we won't be closed up we'll be taken up amen we do not walk into a time when we can't by ourselves that's in the Great Tribulation the bride has gone to Glory at that time it doesn't matter how much the Machinery the devil sits up doesn't matter he can just be a basically a click away and it can all be there it doesn't matter how close he is yeah he cannot do a thing until we're gone Hallelujah hey amen that makes me happy that's why I say we're not driving like some people think into a slow-moving car crash no we are Marching up into Glory amen so where is his feet were his pillars of fire where is that pillow fire today that's not just in a photograph it's in you and I amen that anointing is in you and I Hallelujah yeah amen then you know we'd already cried with the you know he cried with a loud voice of the lion Roth and when he cried seven Thunders out of their voices and when the seven Thunders had out of their voices I was about to write I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which are seven Thunders uttered and write them not and the angel which I saw um stand upon the sea upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and he swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven the things that there and are and the Earth are things that there and are and the Sea and the things that there and are that that there should be time no longer he's swearing by himself because he made all things this is Christ in Angelic form we understand that it means he's swearing by himself is that time should be no longer means there shall be no more delay Hallelujah the things that have been going on for seven Church ages since since the day of Pentecost has been a delay of the promises and the answers of God now comes a season where there's I'm going to wind it all up I'm going to wind up my Plan of Redemption I'm going to gather my bride to myself she's going to go on a Rapture the dead in Christ are going to rise and the devil in all of us schemes can't stop me the devil can't stop God he can't stop him you can look you can go through the Bible just do a study on God being undefeated Hallelujah and the scoreboard was always God wins Satan loses yes Hallelujah and and and and and if that's the what do you call it the recurring theme and we're living in Bible days it'll continue on hallelujah amen that makes me happy amen there shall be no more delay you say well I've been praying for things for such a long time when's it going to happen it's going to happen there shall be no more delay he said I'm going to wind up my plan I remember in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sell the mystery of God should be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophets and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again say go take that little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the scene upon the Earth and I went unto the angel said unto them give me the little book and he said unto me take it eat it up as you'll make thy Valley bitter bit of a mouth that shall be sweet as honey I took the little book out of the Angel's hand ate it up and as it was in my mouth sweet as honey as soon as I had eaten my belly was bitter and he said unto me down must prophesy again before many people's Nations tongues and Kings now we know John himself after the Isle of Patmos he went back to Ephesus and he passed the church there he didn't fulfill this but John was symbolic in the book as as everything else is symbolic so one man is actually a symbol of the the bride at the end time Hallelujah so and that's why we know when you when you actually partake of the word when you eat the word it's sweet in your mouth because all the promises are God how good he is the sweet but it's better in the valley because it's got to purge out the old life Hallelujah but you see now we have a commission in the same time we must prophesy again so what's already been spoken we must speak it under inspiration see it's not just us pointing back in history saying God did this here and God did this here but no we can say no that same God is alive today I mean we see him do the same things I mean we see him fulfill his word in our lives holy what is that that is prophesying again amen the bride around the world is prophesying again why because we're being restored back to a real Pentecost I mean with God himself comes and dwells Amen in his body upon the Earth Hallelujah that's why we can Rejoice this morning why because because when God came down and dwelt in in the disciples every single claim the devil had upon them was struck off amen amen because what God can only dwell truly in a person that's being purged from sin that's what the blood does takes all those desires that all those things he comes and dwells in us and God is saying this is mine this is mine just like when he died on Calvary he poured his blood upon the Earth he's saying I am claiming this Earth we're part of the Earth are we not amen then he comes down with a fiery baptism Burns Out The Devils out of our life sure in this flesh sure we're overcoming things but God is saying you are mine child you don't belong to the devil you never did you never will you were mine and I'm claiming you this way Hallelujah praise God amen now you see we're living in such an awesome time where God is pouring out his Spirit more and more Hallelujah see we're not we are not we are not here just pointing back into history amen we are here see I found it hard I wanted to find a picture where everyone's screaming and rejoicing when the Holy Ghost fell upon him because that's really what happens to someone they something happens to them amen they come out of that experience with a different life Hallelujah I don't know you know you know not all of our experiences are the same but when you come out of that time you know you're different Something's Happened To You amen and Mary was there she was staggering like a drunk woman amen Rejoice against shouting amen if Mary went to Pentecost now that same kind of thing amen we won't get to heaven with a dry-eyed confession Hallelujah amen amen we're here I'll just I'm just trying to find a I'm just going to finish with this I'll just wind up with this this quote here see many people think that the the enemy has to squeeze us enough for then the spoken word to happen and they're thinking the squeeze will put us in condition for it to happen I say the squeeze is already happening we've already been squeezed there's already a persecution against us I don't know if you've realized it but you know we're called a cult or a sect all those antichrists whatever more we're called that yeah yeah if they call Jesus Bells above how much will they call the Servants of the house right so so there is a there is a squeeze already upon us so what are we waiting for right and we've come to this point here where it used to be and this is this is a thought that came to you when I was up and up in Auckland see there was there there was you know all all these different churches that come together to rejoice and worship God and but it didn't used to be that way it didn't used to be that way there was there was always a separation and a gulf and different things but you see now it's just like with these ducks here you know this farmer had some ducks he put fences around to keep the duck separated and the Ducks maybe you know you could maybe used to be in the past you could hear the quacking of some other church somewhere or a Believer and say I think they sound like a Believer but I'm not sure I can't see them you know because things can mimic things right but then now what caused the fences to go it wasn't the Ducks pushing the fences down it wasn't the farmer who wanted to separate them pull the fences down no it was just the water being poured in I meant a flood taking place and lifted all the Ducks up so at first you know where they could just hear each other there's a bit of mistrust well I'm in this church and they're in that church and you know there was like a it's like a parliament in a way that's how it used to be but then when the water came in and lifted the Ducks up above the fence and they saw each other eye to eye they realize they know the same Jesus I do they've had the same kind of experiences I've had they've faced the same battles they believe the same word amen that we are ducks Hallelujah we don't just have a duck man we're all ducks Hallelujah but what was it doing it's bringing a Unity among the bride of Christ so but what causes us this is the rainfall and cause it to happen what does the water represent here the rain is the spirit of God he's pouring himself out more and more he's moving more and more why to take away all the Lift us up above all the fences of our past and pains and hurts and complexes mistrust misunderstandings past fighting between churches and passes away more we're lifted up all above that now we're living in a different season amen and when the water rises like this what happens now the wind begins to blow upon the pond and a swarming takes place do you know you're swarming I don't know but you've realized but your life is actually you're swarming like a bunch of ducks about to migrate Hallelujah that's why we get excited when we hear the word hallelujah's bringing the road we're going to dance and rejoice and be so happy in our hearts what's that that's a swarming amen so now now we're in condition now to take a flight Hallelujah you say well there's a cold wind blowing upon the pond and you know there's the you can see ice you know because you're the Ducks they migrate what from Southern America up to I mean you're like Louisiana up to Canada right and then when it becomes Autumn or fall in Canada they they migrate back down to Louisiana where it's warmer so the world gets colder it gets harder it gets less comfortable to be in now if you're caught up in that you'll be like a duck with a hair dryer trying to trying to blow or trying to heat up the world trying to get rid of all the frost this is what a lot of Christians are trying to do we're going to fix this world yeah we're going to do it ain't gonna work right but if you're listening to the right kind of a Drake amen the certain voice of God right then what what will happen you'll realize no I'm going to drop the hair dryer I'm going to drop the conspiracy stuff and all the stuff that keeps me Earthbound and stressed and tensed and worried I'm going to listen to the Head drag the Holy Ghost because I'm getting ready to take a flight I mean you can stand there and try and yeah I've never seen that happen but you know he will try to fix this world with man-made things we're going to man make you know you know bring the gospel to the World by a man's organization they'll never do it but the bride of Christ will go and get the elect yes and then we're going to go home Hallelujah amen so let's just float out on the goodness of God praise the Lord we're the musicians please this morning Hallelujah praise the Lord amen we'll probably pick this up another time but aren't you glad we've heard we've heard a different sound the sound of the city that John saw coming down Hallelujah hey
