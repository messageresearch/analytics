praise the lord um yeah trust you've had a blessed new year thus far amen and what i'm so thankful about the lord you know we could be singing that in a dungeon we could be singing that in solitary confinement somewhere we could be singing singing that living on the street because he's good amen irrespective of physical situation amen he's good amen let's just go to the scripture this morning we're going to go to exodus chapter 32. now we're going to we're not going to read the whole chapter but i encourage you um to to go home and read the whole chapter we're just going to jump we're going to start from verse 1 then we're going to go to verse 8 and jump down to verse 15 and just to save time we're not going to read the whole whole um whole chapter amen it's good to be a christian eh hallelujah it could be the greatest understatement ever made but amen it's pretty good i'm in exodus 32 and 1 and when the people saw that moses delayed to come down out of the mount the people gathered themselves together unto aaron and said unto him up make us gods which shall go before us as for this moses the man that brought us up brought us up out of the land of egypt we want not uh what has become of him and aaron said unto them break off the golden earrings which are in the ears of your wives of your sons and of your daughters and bring them unto me and all the people break off the golden earrings which were in the ears and brought them unto aaron and he received them at their hand and he fashioned it with a graving tool after he made it a molten calf and they said these be thy gods are israel which brought thee up out of egypt and when aaron saw it he built an altar before it and aaron made a proclamation said to tomorrow as a feast to the lord and they rose up early on the morrow and offered burnt offerings and brought peace offerings and the people sat down to eat and to drink and rose up to play and the lord said unto moses get thee down for thy people which thou bore us out of the land of egypt have corrupted themselves they have turned aside quickly out of the way which i commanded them they have made that them a molten calf and have worshipped it and have sacrificed there unto and said these be thy gods of israel which have brought thee up out of the land of egypt now we're just going to drop down to verse 15 and moses turned and went down from the mount and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand and the tables were written on both of their sides on on the one side and on on the other they were written and the tables were the work of god and the writings were the writings of god graven upon the tables and when joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted he said unto moses there is a noise of war in the camp and he said it is not the noise of them that shout for mastery neither is this voice of them that cry for being overcome but the noise of them that sing do i hear so they will they were one accord uh let's keep reading and it came to pass as soon as he came down to the camp that he saw the calf and the dancing and moses anger waxed hot and he cast the tables out of his hands and break them beneath the mount and he and he took the calf which they had made and burnt it in the fire ground it the powder and stored it upon the water and made the children of israel drink it and moses said unto aaron what did these uh what did this sorry what did this people unto thee what did this people under thee i'll get there eventually that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them and aaron said let not the anger of my lord wax hot thou knows the people that they are set on mischief and they said unto me make us gods which shall go before us for uh for as for this moses the man that brought us up out of land of egypt we what not what has become of him and i said unto them whosoever hath any gold let them break it off so they gave it me then i cast them to the fire and they there came out this calf and when moses saw the people were naked for aaron had made them naked unto their shame among their enemies then moses stood in the gate of the camp and said who is on the lord's side let him come unto me and all the sons of levi gather themselves together unto him i want to take a thought from there who's on the lord's side amen let's bow our heads in a word of prayer we just read the word gracious heavenly father we love you so much you are the greatest one lord that we could ever find lord if we had a million lifetimes we'd never find a one greater than you because you are the greatest one we love you so much we just pray lord as we read your word may you anoint it one more time anoint it to our hearts oh god may we lord this year lord jesus we want to uh be more like you dear god so may you just mold us and shape us by your word lord to make us more in your image i pray father if if you're terry and we stand here in 2023 we could look back at 2022 irrespective of what will happen this year we do not know but father it's all in your control but lord we ought to look back and say we are more like the lord we're we're we're close with you you have mulders and shaped us lord to be more like you so father have your way in our lives we just want to commit the service into your hands lord we always want to remember those who couldn't make it here today maybe they're on holiday maybe they're unwell in their bodies father i pray you'd be with them be their portion for your glory in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you may have your seats this morning um so i just want to throw this question out who's on the lord's side it's it's amazing you know when we look at now i just want to sometimes you've got to define terms and things uh before you begin because i don't want this to be some abstract idea but when i talk about who's being on the lord's side now when i say about who's on the lord's side i'm saying now who's on now the lord's side is to stand for his word right so so that's being on the lord's side it's not some abstract thing but if you stand for his word you're on the lord's side okay so now because we know he is the word in john 1 and 1 it says in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god i mean so so to be on the lord's side is to take the side of the bible of the word of the message of the hour right and we know god's word is always right right it's never been popular but real truth has never been popular so if you want to live life as a popularity contest try and live it a different way right live for truth live for the lord now it's amazing how where where where moses would be uh you know standing here um he would you know it says the lord you know it's amazing god knows what we're doing you know they had they didn't know where their god was and um but here god was having a conference with moses saying this is what the people are doing while you're away and so god knows everything that we're doing but then when moses comes down the mountain now here is the man that god has used mildly to bring them out of slavery they were once once their children were you know once their sons were being fed to the crocodiles once they were being whipped by slave masters once they had no even control over where they lived what they do they were beaten without mercy you know they were under extreme bondage they cried out to god that god would deliver them and but yet yeah and then and then god answered their prayer he sent a man called moses and god went in that man called moses and he delivered them with a mighty hand now but then they came to the place where the word would be restored or i'd rather the word would be known god's way of worship would be made known to them but they said well he's taking too long let's make our own god let's let's craft something of our own imagination that you know that we can worship and and i say that you know if i could say this with uh with no malice or any meanness in my voice you know or heart but you know this is how the church has been you know people many people know about jesus 2000 years ago and he was alive there and he was present there but you know people in fashioning their own ideas all the way down through but you know we live in a time where god's truth has been restored amen and then so so i don't know uh exactly how much the sons of levi partook of what everyone was doing but it just said everyone did it but then when the call came from moses who's on the lord's side they gathered they gathered because a voice the voice of god came into the camp amen from the gate of the camp he cried out who's on the lord's side let them come unto me and they something in them said i'll gather to you i'll gather to you moses now when i talk about moses i'm talking about the word right because the prophet in the bible represents the word of god to the people right so so there was a call came who's on the lord's side and that's amazing why didn't everyone else stand up and say yeah we're all on his side roll on his side no it's only a portion of them for whatever reason actually responded to the call and i pray that you know the this message this morning wouldn't necessarily condemn you but would make you rejoice that you'd realize who team who you know whose team you're on amen so so there they were there was a call came into the camp among the believers and the sons of levi gather themselves under him now it's amazing because every other time there's a crisis leading up to this point they all came to moses when they came to the red sea they murmured against him they came and said have you brought us out here to be slaughtered look we're at an ambush look there's the armies of the pharaoh is right behind us the waters in front of us there's hills on either side we can't outrun them they've got fast chariots we've got slow oxen and our love young ones and things here have you brought us here to die and moses just says stand still and see the salvation of god these egyptians that you see today you'll see no more forever so it's gonna so what he's saying is he is prophesying of the destruction of their enemy and they wouldn't see that enemy again and what happened the red sea parted crossed over pharaoh's army tried to follow and they died they would drown because god closed the sea but who did he do it through moses raise up your staff the water parted i never seen a man walk to a sea raise up a bit of wood and and the waters part that's incredible and then i never seen a man walk to that same sea after everyone crossed over raise up his staff and the water's closed so he prophesied you won't see these ones they're going to be dead you're going to be free and it happened and then they journeyed for three days and they were thirsty they came to a place of um uh and and the waters were bitter and they went to moses is there no water here is there no water so so they gathered to moses but in the wrong uh circumstances it was just a complaint the same word that brought them out of moses they are murmuring against it why did you bring us through these places god wants to prove our faith he wants to prove our faith as genuine amen it's not because everything's good or everyone's nice or whatever no no no god called us we follow if it's over over mountains down through valleys through bright patches doesn't matter we're going through amen so and then you know then they said now we're hungry now you can find this all through the scripture but i'm just to save time i'm just you know so they come to moses did you bring out bring us out here to die to starve but then when the call came see they all gathered hey they're thirsty they're hungry whatever they all gathered to moses and they and they didn't go to someone else for the answer they went to him right they went to him but then now when god comes an idolatry idolatry's already among the people and there's a call coming up from that same man who's on the lord's side only a few of them stood up only a few of them gathered wasn't everyone i think yeah you think it'd be yeah i'm on the lord so what are we doing here why we got the stupid calf it didn't bring us out of egypt we had to physically pack this thing you know but that's what the word the call of god because that's what's been done through the ages who's on the lord's side amen and i'll say those who are part of that call gather more than family more than church forget it we're going to go to heaven because of the blood of jesus christ because you know him personally amen amen that's the only way we're going to go and i say praise god that's the only way i'm going to go i'm glad it's not by church association i'm i'm glad it's not my family last name amen it's by are you under that blood amen if you're under that blood i mean if the life of god is in you amen you're you're on your way hallelujah amen so you know we want to be able to and and you know may god make us in such a way that we can stand true for the word you know this is a very deceptive hour we live in because in the dark ages it was either recant or be killed it was very crystal clear you had those two options a or b you can't have none of the above you've got to have you know choose and the believers gladly counted it not even you know the suffering the the small amount of suffering that go through was nothing compared to eternity hallelujah amen but in this age it's an age of compromise and floating along we don't want to float along this year could be the year jesus comes it's he's going to come one year we don't know the specific day but we know the time and season you know and and and the season's looking like it's ready right and you know so it's going to be there's going to be a last watch night just like jesus had the last passover amen there's going to be a last a last easter meetings or a last family camp there's going to be a last one right so if it is if this is the last uh first sunday of a year of a service praise god amen but there's a call has gone out who's on the lord's side i mean there's always been a call there's been a there's been a a pull from god and it goes to everyone but you've got to make your choice amen we've got to decide i'm going to go i'm going to gather amen irrespective of what everyone else is doing amen we want to we want to be on the lord's side now daniel i was i was just marveling i just think about daniel because jesus said i believe it was him he said you know you're in this world but you're not of this world yeah right so we're in this world we're in ladies here whether we like it or not here we are but we're not of ladies here we're not of this world we're not of this lukewarm condition we're not of but we're in it right we are not called to build monasteries and go live up in the somewheres far away no we're because we're called to be a living witness to be the salt of the earth i mean the word make contact the life the life within us would make contact with people salt brings out the best in the food may we bring out a cry out of people's hearts i want jesus i want salvation i want to go to heaven too amen that's why i pray my life when it makes contact with people around me that say there's something different about him and i actually want what he has hallelujah amen that should be our desire i believe you know because okay so here are now so we're in this world but we're not of this world now you think of daniel in the book of daniel it said that daniel had an excellent spirit and daniel daniel wasn't just a nameless public servant in the government he rose up to be actually deputy he was he was second under the king of the empire it wasn't just some little place in the back corner somewhere this is the world power of the day and he was second he rose up to second in command but he purposed in his heart he would not defile himself so he was very much in the world he was in the decision-making process he was you could say he was right there but when it came to anything that was contrary to his faith to his revelation he took his revelation over what the rest of the world was doing so he was on the lord's side he was on the lord's side so so here was daniel second in charge you know he was the chief among the princes the bible said and you know but yeah but then the other princes were jealous and they made that conspiracy that they're gonna you know say to the king oh king you know write a law that no one will pray to any other man or god but you for 30 days but daniel had already made up his mind i'm going gonna pray because people do what they always do right people do so daniel was a man because we're creatures of habit right he prayed three times a day he wasn't going to change because what he did but he saw the value of his prayer that was his time with god as communion with god you know if you ever want to change change your walk with god do something different if you want a closer walk with god you know we were talking to christine about new year's resolutions and she just said i want to praise him more and to me if you think about that i thought i thought that's marvelous because if you praise him more then you'll love him more and if you love him more and praise him more then you will pray more then you will read more then you'll be a more dedicated sold out christian see it's not about well i've got to do read this more and listen no no what's the whole motivation of the of the walk we are motivated by love right our whole christian walk should be motivated by divine love what was the lord jesus earthly walk what was it motivated by divine love the joy set before him was us redeemed he went to calvary full of love he was god's love manifested upon the earth so everything he did was actually motivated by divine love even even casting all the money changing and stuff out of the temple that was divine love expressed it may not look like it when you saw him but it was divine love right so our whole christian walk should not be fair i pray if you're afraid we should not be afraid meeting the lord that you thrill our souls more than anything the one who died for me i get to stand and see face to face the one who redeemed me the one who called me the one who guided me through dark places the one who wear my heart was so overwhelmed with life he led me to the rock that's higher than i he led me to the revelation i'm part of his bride i'm part of his word i'm part of him hallelujah you know so it's going to be a tremendous day well are you afraid you're going to be cast out there no because i was received here hallelujah if you've received if you've really received the baptism of the holy ghost in your soul you've been received you've been received amen and you're sealed to the day of your redemption so if you're really sealed in you can't be kicked out there hallelujah we were one of the times we're driving up to towing and we're going through the desert road we're talking about these things they're saying you know it's actually almost as good as if we're there already because we're sealed to there right and and all the rest is just victory and character development hallelujah it's character building my dad always says it's character building some things are very much character-building you know praise the lord but we need it because we want his character he's coming for a people that are all his character hallelujah so that's why all things work together for our good praise the lord amen so you know so if you're sealed to the day of your redemption it's as if you're already there in a sense because you've made it you can't be lost now that doesn't mean you get lacks no you press the battle hallelujah i was praying this morning lord may we take every divine promise this year i mean every every burden might be answered this year amen may you live more this year than ever before may you put on flesh and us more this year than ever before may we see you live more this year than ever before may this be the year of the manifestation of the sons of god in their fullness may this be the year hallelujah why not have that kind of desire i want more of jesus there's more to have let's have it all can you do that let's find out shall we why not amen so so we should have i believe that kind of burden but that but then going back to daniel daniel had an excellent spirit and when anything over stepped uh or i could say stood on what he believed he walked with god so he made a stand for the word he was on the lord's side amen the three hebrew children were the same it's amazing they were christian enough to turn up to the statue unveiling they knew what was going to happen right they weren't protesting they weren't no they just they were they were crushing enough just to turn up though they knew what was going to happen they knew you know maybe when they woke up that morning and and you know they had a little team talk before they went out there they'd say you know brothers maybe they're having breakfast together they say you know brothers you know at the end of today we're either going to be in a furnace dead we're either going to be in glory or somehow god's going to deliver us out of that furnace because you know that king what he says goes he doesn't have empty threats he says what he means hallelujah but they had prayed up they they had got the victory and when they stood there even in that whole that whole atmosphere of great pressure to bow other jews bowed they didn't bow because they were on the lord's side we want to be on the lord's side not just in word but indeed i mean and their deed was oh good king live forever sorry but we're not going to bow to your statue we'll only worship our god you're what you're commanding us to do is contrary to the word so we're going to stand with the word we're going to realize if you make a stand for god god will stand for you right god did not stand for daniel because he was back so than lukewarm no he stood for daniel because daniel had sold out given his whole life to the lord and wanted to please him with everything he said done and thought amen the same thing with the hebrew children and we know what happened they had the greatest church service ever in a furnace because the fourth man entered there and they had fellowship with the very god that they were worshiping he stepped out of history i mean they'd seen him answer by vision and by dream but now they he stepped down in reality and they had the greatest prayer meeting greatest church service they'd ever had hallelujah why because they stayed true to the word i mean they were on the lord's side now i'm already probably jumping ahead of myself but there's great benefits with being on the lord's side you know but the problem is is that many people are between two opinions elijah would would would say this to the people of israel here they had great history of god moving in power god had done things in israel that he'd never done anywhere else in any other nation amen you talk about the ministry of moses the ministry of joshua incredible things you know david killing goliath incredible things that were done these things weren't done in other nations they were done in their own nation it was their own history books when they read the bible and that god was still alive but they had forgotten him and the reason they had forgotten them is because they are between two opinions as baal goddess jehovah god because here were these people here were these prophets saying john um baal's god and they got swung because of someone's popular opinion of the day but we don't want to be swung by a popular opinion you know i believe that the that the book of acts is still alive today i believe that the bride of christ is the powerhouse of god and where the dynamics of the holy ghost has come to take over the church amen it's more than just quoting quotes but god comes and manifests the quotes in the scriptures through our lives amen that the things you read about in the book of acts the same things we should see in our own lives because brother brown said if the vine ever puts forth another branch it'll write another book of acts behind it amen i believe we're part of that number hallelujah where god is still alive upon the earth amen proving himself very much alive hallelujah that's what i believe amen i trust you jump on board with that amen we serve a real god he's not dead in 2022 he's alive today as he was when he walked in his physical form he's now in bright form upon the earth amen fulfilling every promise that he has given us he is more than able to fulfill every promise his word is always right his word is always true his word is always in season it never gets old it never gets stale it should never get common it should become richer and greater to us every day and every hour amen because this you just fall in love with jesus you'll fall in love with this word i tell you amen you just hear a song or yeah i love that song all my life he's been faithful most of my life i have not been faithful i was in darkness but yet he was still faithful hallelujah amen he brought me through many dark places he's always been faithful and he always will be faithful hallelujah amen amen now see so elijah wood would be instructed by the lord to go to ahab and he would get ahab to to to gather children of israel to mount carmel and so elijah said um he said to the people how long will you hold between two opinions if the lord be god follow him if baal then follow him and the people answered him not a word to me that's a very simple you know if jesus christ is god follow him if this message is jesus christ revealed follow it follow him if it's not forget it it's really that simple if this if this does not manifest what it says it will let's find another religion amen at this promise that i'll be with you even in you to the end of the world we should be able to see that promise who's experienced that promise the infilling of the holy ghost he said lay hands upon the sick and they shall recover who's seen that promise and my name you'll cast out devils who's seen that promise hallelujah joy and speaker will be full of glory who's seen that who's experienced that that the love of god will be abroad in your hearts by the holy ghost give it unto you who's experienced that amen who's life's been transformed hallelujah so i think we've got enough evidence in this little room to prove that the god of the scripture still lives hallelujah and it's not out of human enthusiasm this is beyond enthusiasm i mean i believe god is god is motivating a people god is anointing a people i'm talking to her a part of her right now god is actually motivating us you're going to make it i mean it may get real dark i don't know what this year will bring no one knows we go back a few years you know singing little william there over over there and yeah baby faith and you know baby lena they don't know what it's like to live pre-covered they don't know what the world was like they're now living in a new normal you know but the world has changed we never thought the you know the disciples had no idea really what would happen when jesus was dying he he told them but their world fell apart but it was a time of resurrection when the world was falling apart the resurrection was taking place so to me i think well i think the season's just right for the dead in christ to rise and our bodies to be changed hallelujah but if you're on the lord's side you'll be gathered to that amen so don't be on any other side but you see elijah he would say how long will you be be between these two opinions now these people were circumcised israelites they were jews but they had got two opinions and brother brahm says if you're between two opinions it causes spiritual amnesia you forget who you are see we need to i pray that the lord would uh anchor it into our hearts amen that we are of this we are in this world but not of this world because if we are if we realize that we are in this world but not of it we won't be caught up with whatever is trending in this world just like daniel he didn't get caught up in it the hebrew children but then so elijah would ask this question and then he would he would instruct the people now we're going to have a showdown to prove because if god's god let's serve him if baal's god let's serve him let's just make up our minds let's not toss to and fro should i be a believer should i not be a believer is the bible true is it not is the message true is it not is jesus christ the same or is he not is this the right religion or is it not let's just make up our minds let's just see yeah this is what he is saying to them and then so he told the people you are the prophets of baal they can have their bullock and their altar and they can you know they can uh set that up and they can call upon bail and then i'll sit you know sit up my altar and put the bullock at different things and you know the one who answers with fire he's god and the people just thought that's well spoken that sounds good i think that's friggin let the god who answers by fire let him be the real god hallelujah but the thing is what causes people to between to be between two opinions the reason is is they think that both options are good so they thought that baal was as good as jehovah but then jehovah's done all these miracles but baal sounds pretty good but yeah and they couldn't make up their mind because they thought both were good now unfortunately this is the same way as when people want to side with either the lord now there's only two spirits in the world you know you know there's god and there's satan there's not middle ground you know the only one who builds fences is the devil because he makes walls around denomination right he keeps people separated oh they believe different they believe this different even among the masters all these people this way you know yeah he builds fences so if you're sitting on the fence you're sitting on the devil's construction job i would get off his handiwork and i would walk with god so don't be a fan sitter but the reason people sit on the fence is they think what the devil has to offer is actually pretty good it actually has some merit in it that's why people sit on yo i'm just making them i'm not sure this person's opinion who cares you know if you have to go on the internet and say is it right for a christian to do x y and z you need to pray you need to ask god because it's not popular opinion that makes things acceptable or not it's what god has said is acceptable i will i will take him and it's not an opinion i'll take what he said above what everyone thinks because opinion will change like the wind who's ever lived in auckland no one okay i'll put my hand up there we go it's like literally four seasons in one day it could be summer time doesn't matter you wake up it's sunny then you're having morning tea it's raining and then next time it's hailing then it's windy now it's sunny again it just changes like this and that's how man's opinion is first way it's this way then by lunchtime it's like this or no we've done some research just like this no we've done some more research just back this way and you know it's like shifting sand but see that's the problem we don't want to be that way if you have a question ask the lord ask him and seek him in his word he will give you the answer if you're willing to accept it see we don't want to walk with a preconceived idea you know we should never go to prayer with your mind made up already well now i know how god will do this that's easy you pray and say yes but you've already got your mind made up no we should say lord what is your will but we never ever want to get in that place see that's why people are still pulled by the world it's because they think the devil has something to offer them which is as good as the lord that's why they get stuck can i ask a question does the devil have eternal life to give anyone does he have heaven to give does he have anything good what's the track record of his servants broken lives oh but they're super rich money it means nothing the german currency i think between the first and second world war at the bottom fell out of it so quickly that you'd literally have to have a wheelbarrow full of german marks just to buy a loaf of bread that wasn't that long ago we know unfortunately zimbabwe the same you know but currency can just fall through the you know they used to call the new zealand dollar i don't know if it still is they used to call it the japanese japanese housewives dollar because japanese housewives apparently used to trade in new zealand currency would make it go up make it go down because they'd be buying selling you know but what what what about when the market falls out i've got all these digits in a bank there's nothing behind it as brother isaac brought out there's no there's no value oh but yo my my house is worth two million dollars now next minute what what is it worth see there's nothing solid but people seem to think that you know so the devil has nothing to give you know he doesn't have eternal life oh but i get such a high no i'd rather yo drugs are just everything the devil has done as a perversion of god drugs are a perversion of being filled with the holy ghost drunkenness the same thing love he has no idea what love is the world doesn't know what real love is either amen he has no heaven to give you he has no rapture to give you he has no real lasting peace lasting joy i mean lasting satisfaction he has nothing that will give you any kind of happiness you know but the thing is people sit here and say but what will my friends think of me i know what prayer pressure is like because it took me a couple of years to get over it before i actually sold out to the lord because i was afraid i'd lose my friends but i'd rather have eternal life if they want to come with me which i pray they would have that would have been awesome too you know i wanna people think i'm cool that'll change like the weather what will my family think of me what will my friends think of me those that are willing to forsake father mother husband all those things will be given [Music] right hallelujah but you see brother brown would say this when he was looking back this is 1952 but he's looking back to when he was 12 years old he says the only thing that kept me from being saved when i was 12 is because a spirit hung over me and a devil saying wait a little longer that's the reason that you weren't saved when you came to the age of accountability a spirit you got in a crowd and that hovered over you and kept hanging over you you wanted to do right there's not a man that's got that's got his right mind but wants to do right but there is something that won't let you do right is that right amen that's the devil so you see now there's that see but but why why would that spirit stay over someone is because that person is still agreeing with that spirit see god pulls on a heart but the devil says wait a little longer now if they sit where they are and don't respond to that call they're agreeing with the devil that's been between two opinions why because there was no no it's dumb and there's no joy there's nothing to it you don't want to be like those people and you know what about your friends and you can be this he'll give you the world based on his estimation of your value he will give you either a very great kingdom or he'll give you a small kingdom like he said to jesus he he valued jesus so highly he says i'll give you every kingdom under under heaven if you bow down and worship me so he'll give you either a very small kingdom or a big one but he'll give you something but what if that person that the lord's calling ignores that voice saying wait a little longer and response to the call what happens is they're no longer agreeing with that spirit any spirit that is contrary to the word of god is not the holy spirit amen so it really boils down to what spirit are you agreeing with the one that says wait a little bit longer or reasons away the call of god that's the wrong one amen we want to we want to stay with the law i'm on the lord's side by his grace i and i want to be more on his side i want to i don't want to be in the boundary and in and out i want to be in i know and i want to be hallelujah now elijah i mean jesus said himself in in matthew 6 and 24 no man can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other you cannot serve god and mammon right so you can't have so you can't have a bit of the lord and a bit of the world you can't serve them both you know you only serve one we we want to live with the lord in such a way that you know well i'll just rephrase that completely you can have enough of god just to be miserable which is just a little bit have all of them have the joy and the peace break through the sound barrier hallelujah amen now now we know there is a story there in um in first kings 18 the prophets of baal you know they built their altar they put the sacrifice or the wood in the sacrifice and they began to call on bail they danced around they had a great religious motion and elijah knew that it wasn't going to work because he'd already seen a vision what was going to happen so he began to mock them maybe cry louder maybe sleeping or pursuing or doing something try and get his attention and they cut themselves and they did all kinds of things but there wasn't one trace of fire anywhere and then and then elijah said in first kings 18 and 30 and elijah said to all the people come near unto me hallelujah now when there's a call come unto me it's actually i want to get your attention maybe the people of israel were still kind of watching the prophets of baal dancing around and maybe when they were exhausted lying on the ground they still were keeping them in their you know corner of their eye watching what's going to happen but then elijah said come unto me oh yeah come near unto me and all the people came near unto him and he repaired the altar of the lord that was broken down why didn't he use the uh prophets of baal's altar that alt that approach was no good but the altar of the lord he had to repair this is this is a a a key aspect of the ministry of elijah is that he repairs or restores the true access of god back to god amen we've seen it in this day hallelujah as well now so when someone says come near unto me they want your attention basically saying i've got something to show you amen this is why i'm elijah called all the people he had something to show them i mean and it was more than just a religious ritual they had most of a day of that with the prophets of baal it was more than an argument or a debate but he was going to show them the god that answers by fire hallelujah that he's the same one that met moses in the burning bush and there was a cloud by day a pillar fire by night the same one that filled the temple after solomon dedicated it i mean so he repaired the altar of the lord that was broken down now he was going to show israel what happens when you sacrifice on this altar hallelujah now we know in the scripture a stone or a rock is symbolic of revelation you know as as jesus would ask the disciples who to mean say that i am or in other words what has been revealed to them and and they would say well some say you're john the baptist or elias or jeremias or one of the prophets but then he asked the people who do you say that i am and then simon peter answered thou art the christ the son of the living god and jesus answered and said unto him blessed are thou simon by jonah for flesh and blood has not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven because the whole conversation there is revelation what has been revealed to the people while they could see the scrolls and see what the old prophets did and they said well they must be he must be one of those prophets resurrected right but then simon peter had the revelation this was the christ not just a portion of god and a prophet but the fullness of the god here bodily in the son of god amen so he says bless out thou simon but jonathan flesh and blood has not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and i say unto thee that thou art peter and upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it so the rock there is not peter as as i think the catholics say amen but the rock is the revelation of who jesus christ is is the rock the church is built upon so here comes elijah and he repairs the altar of the lord amen the the prophets of baal have done their thing no fire but he repairs what has already been there that's why we've been restored back to the apostolic faith the altar or the approach for the fire to fall has been restored and what happens is god puts revelation stones in your heart as the word is going forth revelation drops into your heart hallelujah but then there comes a time where the altar is built but now there's got to be a sacrifice laid upon that altar amen and that and that sacrifice is actually you that your old life is laid upon the altar hallelujah and then the fire comes down from heaven amen and burns up your old life hallelujah that it doesn't come back no more you take anything that's been burnt who's who's who's overcooked the steak a few times it just goes into ashes you can't make it meat again it's gone the fire's burned it up oh just like the fire of god when he falls upon a soul burns up that old nature takes that kills that serpent nature out of us i mean make us a new creature in christ how the fire fell so he called it he was calling come come near unto me and to me it was more than just elijah calling this was god calling come near unto me i'm going to show you what i can do i mean i'm going to answer by fire i mean and that's what happens when the word when the word calls your attention he wants to show you personally that he's still the same hallelujah so he called them come near unto me amen he repaired the altar and then he had all the water your poured on to make it impossible and then he says now then he pray says lord may the people know that thou art god and thou has turned their hearts back again and the fire fell down consumed the whole thing and then the people saw jehovah's god they weren't halting between two opinions actually saw baal's got nothing to offer us he has nothing to offer us he's not even a real god he can't do nothing because remember baal was meant to be god of the rain the water and fire and he couldn't produce either hallelujah we don't have a false hope we have a god that really produces the goods hallelujah we have a true and living god that produces the goods amen that's why i asked the question before who's been transformed who's received the holy ghost who's been healed amid all the promises of the bible who's received them hallelujah amen so he wants to bring the fire of his holy spirit down upon us hallelujah after we've laid ourselves upon the altar amen hallelujah so that took the two opinions out amen because god proved there who was on the lord's side amen and the people gathered hallelujah just like the sons of levi when the call came they they responded to the call and the reason they responded to that call is because they were part of the call it wasn't just a nice idea to gather to moses god was calling his people who's really on my side because remember when they were coming down the mountain and joshua heard the noise joshua thought there's war going on there's mastery you know i mean you know there's fighting and moses says no no there's not a cry of masteries and there's a victory on one side and a cry of defeat no it's just singing so they're actually all in this idol worship together but then when the call of god came the sons of levi separated themselves out because they they realized we're on the lord's side and i trusted something amen when the when the message came your way we're all in idolatry in some form religious idolatry maybe people can worship their car sport some someone on the street their job their family but when that call came amen i trust something and you said i'm on the lord's side hallelujah amen just like jesus would jesus would cry in matthew 11. he says come unto me all you that labor in a heavy lady and i'll give you rest amen take my yoke upon you and learn of me for i am meek and lonely in heart and you shall find rest unto your souls so basically cried who's on the lord's side come unto me and i'll give you rest hallelujah and many have gathered we have gathered i mean i trust you can see you can say actually i'm on so if we're on the lord's side we're on the word side amen we're on the word side we stand for this word amen more than more than life itself we stand for this word hallelujah and the reason that is is because we are part of the word right the bride is part of the bridegroom the bride is part of the word so when the call came who's on the lord's side we find ourselves irrespective of our nationality whatever we were in creed whatever religion whatever doesn't matter but there's a call because there's a seed in us being responding to that call i am on the lord's side here i am lord hallelujah praise the lord amen amen now joshua no i'll go here before i go to joshua i'm going to close david david had some mighty men and they they loved david they knew he was coming into power they they did get in some sticky spots with him though and they got to a place called you know you know all their families were in zig lag they went to that they were going to go join the philistines to fight against saul but but the king of the philistines didn't want them there so they returned back to ziglag but when they were returning they saw smoke come out of the city and when they got into the ruins they found none of their loved ones were there and then these these ones these mighty men that gathered to david they they actually consented or planned we're going to stone this guy never ever get mad at the word where it leads you the very one that gathered them and the very anointing that actually made the mighty men though getting mad against lord why did you allow why david if you're really king and you really knew what was going on why on earth did you let our families be taken away by the amalekites we're going to kill yo don't get mad don't get mad at god where he leads you never ever have in your heart that that that you get mad at god god is always right he knows what we have need of amen he knows it doesn't matter how bad it may seem god knows what we need hallelujah amen amen but we know the rest of the story david encouraged himself in the lord and god told david you're going to recover all pursue and recover all and they recovered all amen but there were mighty men in that group that even the smallest desire of david because they're on david's side right the smallest desire of david was like a mighty commandment to them amen and david was was there and you know bethlehem was garrisoned and you know you know by the philistines and you know maybe he just looked and he saw his childhood home on the horizon and he just cried out oh i wish i could have a drink of that cold water of the well of bethlehem and there's three mighty men maybe they gathered around a fireplace or something they just heard it just came into their ears and they decided let's get our king a fresh drink we've got water here boys but he wants that water i mean they armed themselves they cut themselves through 15 miles of philistines amen and they got the water out of the well and they came back through 15 miles of philistines again and they gave their king a fresh drink i mean all because they're on david's side and that was a desire of his that he won that drink now we live in an hour where the pentecostal well of all the blessings of god have been walled up even even i could say if i could put it this way don't throw stones i'm not very fast but you know even within the message there's those unbelieving spirits garrisoned around the well where they want to just diminish the message down to formality and going through the motions and they won't say it but they basically said days of miracles have passed we don't need him anymore like that yes we do if we want to see the third paul manifested that's a supernatural move of god hallelujah if we want to see these bodies changed that's a supernatural move of god hallelujah and what is really you could say you'd say the change of the body is the greatest divine healing moment that has ever struck the earth and it's not just a temporary healing but it's actually a change of the atoms to that we put on immortality amen but he's still the jehovah of miracles he's still the god of miracles i mean so they cut their way through to get their king a fresh drink and the prophetess told us let us take our swords of the word let's chop through every superstition every formality every doubting spirit everything country to the word and let's get our king a fresh drink of pentecostal water a fresh worship amen that if we worship let's worship in the spirit if we sing let us sing in the spirit if we praise that it's praise in the spirit if we preach may we preach in the spirit if we play instruments maybe play in the spirit if we walk let us walk in the spirit if we talk to someone may we talk under their spirit under the anointing may every action we do be anointed by god amen so i think this 20 22 i mean let's get our king a fresh drink i mean let's give him a fish fresh worship not a formality and just taking things common i've heard this before been through this before no praise god amen you know you think there'll be a last time we can gather there'll be a last time what will cause that last time ultimately the rapture means we won't be in this building anymore we will have camp last time you'll have family altar last time you never many la i think by isaac said this can't remember but you know many times we never think it's our last time it just we just go through it then we look back and say oh that's at my last time doing whatever we should never ever take coming to church hearing the word even i'm thankful i have life in my body to praise god because the bible says shall the dead praise thee no they've gone on to their reward but i have life in my body to love him and worship him and give him praise irrespective of what's going on in my life because remember he's always good we shouldn't worship god we don't worship god based on our circumstances sure if he blesses us we thank him for it right but if we are down i mean praise him anyway he's still god he's still your savior he's still your redeemer he's still your bridegroom he's still all those things i mean your whole life falls apart he's still god amen the apostle paul was in prison with silas i said let's just have a let's have a testimony time i was going on the damascus road one day hallelujah in my heart was destruction but then a bright shining light came down from heaven i got thrown off my horse i cried out lord who are you i realize i'm seeing something that i read about in the scripture amen he said i'm jesus whom they'll persecute and my life has never been the same and silas could have given his testimony however they could have been talking about their trip reports what god had done in their lives and how great he is hallelujah and then they begin to sing all my life you have been faithful hallelujah and they're in a prison hallelujah don't look at your physical circumstances remember god does bless but a blessing doesn't you know a material blessing doesn't always mean he's pleased with you same way as being poor and death you doesn't mean he's unpleased with you right it's actually your spiritual condition that matters amen we're accepted in the beloved what because our lamb is accepted we're accepted amen because he is the perfect lamb that was offered on our behalf amen i'm accepted amen because he did that for me i can be on the lord's side hallelujah so they cut through all those philistines they got the king their king a fresh drink of water amen now joshua and and i'm going to finish with this joshua would come down to the end of his road and he would give what you could say his last sermon to the to the believers he says now therefore fear the lord remember every generation has to make its choice every generation now therefore fear the lord you know every generation must have its own revival every generation every generation must have its own revival not just the old ones the young ones amen every generation must have its own revival where god pours himself out into them and lives in a supernatural way hallelujah i believe can i say i believe this is the year why not hallelujah we can have revival again glory amen amen i want the supernatural i want to see god live more this is my own heart i'm so hungry i want to see a move i want to see him save people i want to see him people just just give their lives and get transformed and honestly young people raise up in power i mean they say yo brother ed brother had sent me a video of daniel here song leading singing i don't know what are you standing on but that was pretty awesome i thought praise god might the young ones be anointed may us old ones be anointed hallelujah we're all the same age in god anyhow amen amen i say young people have you got to burn to do something push in push amen don't think oh there's no room there's room we've got a lot of room hallelujah amen what i mean by that you've got to burn to surf song lead play you want to share share something in the sunday school you know you have a burn to do something say i've got to burn i want to do this you know praise the lord how can we add fuel to this burden that's how i feel amen oh now we're going to have a lot of no no yeah praise the lord because we get so used to oh brother ben's this and this person's this dirt and this and we get so like like strata and a rock you know just just setting our ways of layers of stuff no we're all called to raise up to our position irrespective of h hallelujah now so he would say this joshua 24 now therefore fear the lord i just get excited when i talk about what god can do hallelujah now therefore fear the lord and servant sincerity and in truth and put away the gods which your father served on the other side of the flood and in egypt and serve you the lord that's amazing he's basically saying break the cycle your fathers serve those gods on the other side of the flood they serve them in egypt but serve the lord don't don't serve the gods of your forebears forget them and what they did and you know i hope that comes out right you know but yeah what they worshipped serve the living god today amen amen and serve you the lord and have it seem evil unto you to serve the lord choose you this day whom you will serve whether it be the gods of your fathers which your fathers serve there on the other side the flood or the gods of the amorites and whose land you dwell but as for me in my house we will serve the lord amen basically i'm on the lord's side this is what i want for my family this is what i'm going to do you make up your mind what you're doing this is what i'm doing amen enoch made up his mind one day i'm i'm on the lord's side and he walked on the lord's side until eventually the lord took him off the earth and i believe that's our portion in this hour amen so just make up your mind remember the devil has nothing to give you god the lord has heaven he has he you know i was thinking the other day yeah the devil has a death he's going to die he's going to burn he has he actually has an appointment with the lake of fire it's booked on god's calendar i don't know how god has account yo if it's an x or a square or whatever but there's a day on the calendar where he's
