[10:33] [Music]

[10:42] temptations hidden snares have to
[10:47] [Music]
[10:55] [Music]
[10:58] but we'll understand
[11:03] [Music]
[11:08] [Music]
[11:13] [Music]
[11:19] [Music]
[11:30] [Music]
[11:41] will
[11:46] [Music]
[12:07] oh we've been tossed and driven round on
[12:11] the reckless season of time from the
[12:14] skies and howling tempers off succeed of
[12:17] bright sunshine in that land of perfect
[12:20] days
[12:29] [Music]
[12:33] when the morning comes
[12:35] when all the
[12:54] [Music]
[13:07] [Music]
[13:20] [Applause]
[13:21] [Music]
[13:29] [Applause]
[13:32] by
[13:33] [Music]
[13:38] we have a we have a presentation um by
[13:40] sister maggie so we can all
[13:42] be seated
[13:58] thank you um i don't know if i'm allowed
[14:01] to do this but can i ask the musicians
[14:03] to be dismissed so then you guys can
[14:05] watch too
[14:10] so as you all know um the youth went on
[14:14] a snow trip um just last
[14:17] um
[14:19] last sunday we went um and i just wanted
[14:21] to ask
[14:22] everyone that went to the snow trip
[14:23] could just stand up and
[14:25] so then everyone knows who who went
[14:29] our youngest youth just shannon isaac
[14:31] over there
[14:37] so um as you can see on the first slide
[14:39] that's um
[14:40] all of us that was there minus the
[14:43] tauranga crew that left the night before
[14:46] so we had representatives from
[14:48] wellington tauranga fielding taranaki
[14:52] and
[14:53] we've got one from auckland as well so
[14:56] it was a north island gathering
[14:59] um
[15:00] so to the far right over there is where
[15:02] our lodge is located which is the same
[15:04] place we stayed last year with the dub
[15:07] was it the dove snow trip
[15:09] um
[15:11] this one works so this is our um
[15:14] upstairs lodge
[15:16] um it comfortably
[15:18] fitted 21 of us
[15:21] and it felt a lot more full compared to
[15:23] the little kids last year but um that
[15:27] was it was good that those two that room
[15:29] there acted as our lounge kitchen games
[15:32] room and church
[15:34] so there was heaps going on um
[15:37] and we had um
[15:41] four brothers minister for us while we
[15:43] were away we had brother isaac
[15:45] brother aori from taranaki
[15:48] brother ben came all the way up on
[15:50] wednesday night and
[15:52] stayed for a bit and then left the same
[15:54] night back to wellington um
[15:57] and then we had dave
[15:58] minister for us too
[16:00] um and we as it says here we had lots of
[16:04] gospel widening worship so this works
[16:15] [Music]
[16:16] [Applause]
[16:21] um
[16:22] we also had quite a few musical talents
[16:25] spring forth that we didn't know about
[16:27] um
[16:28] the fielding duo um surprised us with
[16:31] some impromptu piano playing um as
[16:33] you'll see in this video
[16:40] [Music]
[16:48] he really came
[16:49] [Music]
[16:54] um
[16:55] then on monday the main event was um
[17:00] a snow day or a lack of it there wasn't
[17:02] that much snow the first day so only
[17:05] happy valley was open but um
[17:08] that meant that all the lessons could
[17:10] get done
[17:11] and dusted
[17:12] differences could be resolved during the
[17:14] snow war
[17:16] as you can kind of see there um
[17:18] and we could practice our jumps as
[17:20] you'll see in the next few videos
[17:24] so this is michael
[17:29] got a commentary from isaac and a few of
[17:30] them
[17:37] namski
[17:38] thank you
[17:49] um
[17:50] we then had the opportunity to go up to
[17:52] the at the gondola
[17:54] um
[17:56] so
[17:56] isaac and shannon selfishly claimed a
[17:59] gondola to themselves for obvious
[18:01] reasons um and
[18:04] we went up the top and had a
[18:06] head
[18:07] a snowball fight and
[18:09] hannah got her cheek completely like
[18:12] bruised from abe's close range firing
[18:16] but no it was really awesome
[18:19] and then we've got a few more
[18:21] videos
[18:30] nice
[18:38] nice
[18:42] um our arrival on the monday was a bit
[18:45] sleety um but that cleared up by lunch
[18:48] isaac is there showing us that real men
[18:51] don't stop for ham sandwiches they just
[18:53] keep snowboarding
[18:56] um
[18:57] then tuesday was a
[19:00] oh no sorry there's more videos
[19:02] and then it's just i think this might be
[19:04] essay
[19:12] and he's safe
[19:19] [Music]
[19:26] and then the next one is abi
[19:28] abe did not have a lesson and last year
[19:30] he did he's killing so he was doing real
[19:32] awesome on the snowboard
[19:35] [Music]
[19:43] so
[19:44] tuesday was our um sightseeing day it
[19:47] was a two-hour loop track to taranaki
[19:50] falls which left us pretty knackered um
[19:53] we just returned and i just sat down
[19:56] with a kulkum butcher and then isaac and
[19:58] ben come running up the stairs saying
[20:00] we're going to the turf to play some
[20:01] games and
[20:02] so we all trudged down to the vans and
[20:05] went down to the turf that's next to the
[20:07] chateau for some
[20:09] some games um
[20:11] which you oh and that's that's john at
[20:13] the top there
[20:15] um
[20:18] and
[20:18] then play some games i'm sorry tiana to
[20:21] do this to you but
[20:23] you kind of yell on this one
[20:43] so that's tongariro um you can just see
[20:45] in the distance it was a beautiful day
[20:47] um
[20:49] and then we go to
[20:51] wednesday wednesday was wicked it was so
[20:54] cool that's um
[20:55] up up the real that's the top of the
[20:58] mountain so if you were to look right
[21:02] you would see that your eye level with
[21:04] tongariro so you i'd never been up that
[21:07] high before um
[21:09] so as either ski at happy valley or ski
[21:12] at the top tracks which was a matter of
[21:14] go hard or go home
[21:17] the tea bars were quite new to some
[21:19] people but
[21:20] so you either conquered the tea bars or
[21:22] you were conquered by them
[21:26] my brother eddie in
[21:28] was annihilated by one of the top jumps
[21:31] and went home with a broken arm and a
[21:32] life lesson after
[21:35] land on your feet not your hands
[21:38] asaph got very comfortable with a
[21:40] boulder
[21:43] when we're nearly going off the edge of
[21:45] the mountain
[21:46] um
[21:47] and 360s were done some intentional but
[21:51] not all
[21:52] um
[21:53] overall it was a really solid day of
[21:56] skiing and snowboarding we were there
[21:58] from i think 9 30 through to 4 o'clock
[22:00] so
[22:01] it was non-stop
[22:04] this is
[22:05] um
[22:06] the lunch prep for that day it's nice to
[22:09] see the brothers in the kitchen
[22:11] um even if it looks like ben's about to
[22:14] sneeze on the sandwiches
[22:17] but
[22:21] there's pre-destinated dnase it's okay
[22:27] and it looks like john is just taste
[22:29] testing
[22:30] um
[22:33] and
[22:35] so some friendly fire
[22:40] if it works
[22:48] that's okay that was just a snowball
[22:50] bent on um
[22:52] and this is our well naomi and ben's
[22:55] efficiency in the kitchen
[23:04] and
[23:05] a note to tell the little ones not to do
[23:06] that when nothing yeah
[23:09] um
[23:10] and
[23:12] yeah so this is um our final slide so
[23:15] it's just a bit of a big thank you um
[23:18] i'll let you guys read that in your own
[23:20] time but um overall it was a real
[23:22] awesome trip and
[23:24] and i thank you all for making it happen
[23:26] and being there it was it was really
[23:28] great
[23:29] so um
[23:33] [Music]

[23:43] reject this world
[23:48] [Music]
[23:53] let us

[30:46] [Music]

[31:03] [Music]
[31:12] and make
[31:15] [Music]
[31:21] oh gracious heavenly father
[31:24] we come here lord humbly tonight father
[31:26] and ask
[31:27] make us more like you lord
[31:30] that's our heart's greatest desire lord
[31:32] is not to be some superhero lord or to
[31:35] try to be something fancy father but
[31:37] just
[31:38] someone that is walking in the image of
[31:40] the lord jesus christ lord where they
[31:42] can say on this earth there is still
[31:44] jesus christ in flesh
[31:46] lord that if these people out there
[31:48] looking for you father that they would
[31:50] see you in us
[31:51] lord so ask that you would make us more
[31:54] like you lord jesus there's nothing we
[31:56] can do or or lord we're just sheep we
[31:59] just bear will lord we just ask would
[32:01] you just come in and lord would you just
[32:03] be the one that gives us that wool lord
[32:05] jesus we cannot manufacture it not even
[32:08] if we eat the nicest of food lord can we
[32:11] push out that wool lord but i asked lord
[32:13] jesus that you will just come tonight by
[32:15] our way
[32:16] may you just have a personal meeting
[32:18] with each one of us lord that's why we
[32:20] come
[32:20] father and do not pass us by lord
[32:23] because the whole reason we come here
[32:24] lord is to draw strength father lord to
[32:27] get encouraged lord and if there is a
[32:30] need lord we asked lord that you would
[32:32] just see that need lord we know you
[32:34] already know it lord because
[32:36] predestination proves father that there
[32:38] is nothing
[32:39] nothing
[32:40] nothing on this earth that is a surprise
[32:43] to you lord
[32:44] father and we just ask you take this
[32:46] evening and may you be glorified in our
[32:49] midst father may you take speaker and
[32:51] hear our lord and may this all just be
[32:53] for your kingdom your glory we pray in
[32:56] the wonderful name of our lord jesus
[32:58] christ amen and amen
[33:02] amen
[33:03] sister talia can you put up that second
[33:05] song quickly that we had
[33:08] and verse three i just want to show
[33:10] music you can you can go and sit thank
[33:12] you very much god bless you
[33:14] just something that that
[33:16] it's so wonderful that when we
[33:19] when we come to church the lord's
[33:21] already pre-ordained everything
[33:23] everything is in cater there's nothing
[33:25] that's out of cater there's nothing
[33:26] that's out of sort i think it was the
[33:28] verse where it says um
[33:31] wonder why the test was in there
[33:34] it says lord give no not the second song
[33:36] we sang the the
[33:40] yep there we go so let's see this this
[33:42] is pretty much the whole sermon
[33:45] summed up right here temptations hidden
[33:48] snares often take us unawares and our
[33:50] hearts are made to bleed for some
[33:52] thought word and deed
[33:54] and we wonder why the test we try to do
[33:57] our best what will understand it better
[34:00] by and by amen thank you very much so
[34:02] god bless you saints you can all have
[34:04] you see oh no actually we stand we're
[34:05] going to have a scripture first sorry i
[34:07] almost got ahead of myself let's turn to
[34:09] malachi
[34:10] 4.
[34:11] i wonder who knows what the scripture is
[34:13] all about
[34:15] who knows who wants to raise the end and
[34:16] say i like when the kids malachi 4 what
[34:19] would be in malachi 4 what's very
[34:21] important
[34:23] amen brother ben you win
[34:25] me
[34:26] i'm there amen
[34:28] okay so let's read it and let's see if
[34:30] you can find yourself there
[34:32] everybody there amen it's the last book
[34:35] in the old testament so if you didn't
[34:37] know

[34:43] all the proud yea and all that do
[34:45] wickedly shall be stubble and the day
[34:48] that cometh shall burn them up say of
[34:50] the lord of host and it shall leave them
[34:52] neither root nor branch
[34:55] but unto you that fear my name shall the
[34:57] son of righteousness arise with healing
[34:59] in his wings and ye shall go forth and
[35:02] grow up as carves in the storm man we'll
[35:04] be fat and fluffy on the word amen we
[35:07] won't go hungry he says i'll give you
[35:09] all you need you'll be just as calves
[35:12] jumping around amen
[35:14] and you shall treat down the wicked for
[35:16] they shall be ashes under the souls of
[35:18] your feet in that day shall the lord do
[35:20] this save the lord of hosts
[35:22] amen that's god saying that it's not any
[35:24] one of us it's god saying it amen he
[35:28] says remember ye the law of moses my
[35:30] servant which i command unto you and
[35:32] horap
[35:33] for all israel with the statues and
[35:35] judgment behold i will send
[35:38] you amen let's say again behold i will
[35:41] send
[35:42] me
[35:43] elijah the prophet before the coming and
[35:44] the great and dreadful day of the lord
[35:47] and he shall turn my heart from the
[35:49] fathers to the children and the hearts
[35:51] from the children which is now mine back
[35:52] to the fathers least i come and smite
[35:54] the earth with a curse amen god bless
[35:57] you saints have a seat it's not going to
[35:59] be hot and heavy tonight um
[36:01] actually what happened this is the first
[36:02] time i'm preaching without notes
[36:04] because i made heaps of notes and they
[36:06] all kind of went
[36:08] all over the show and i said lord you
[36:10] know what
[36:11] i love you i'm gonna take the scripture
[36:13] that you gave me and and the thought
[36:14] that you gave me and we'll see what you
[36:16] do with that because it's not us doing
[36:18] the work so if you came to listen to me
[36:20] you're gonna be very disappointed
[36:21] because it's not me doing the work it is
[36:23] the lord jesus christ amen amen okay so
[36:27] you can only leave you disappointed
[36:30] if you didn't ask him to help you or
[36:32] bless you because
[36:33] it is the believer that touches the hymn
[36:36] of his garment it's the believer
[36:38] okay amen so my my sermon title tonight
[36:42] is
[36:44] proving his word amen
[36:47] so proving his word god proves his word
[36:52] amen that is that is where it's at
[36:54] there's no other way about it god
[36:57] proves his word no matter how you try to
[36:59] figure it out or try to make it work in
[37:01] your head if god doesn't come and prove
[37:03] it he is not god he is sovereign he is
[37:06] almighty he he's big enough to prove his
[37:08] word anytime anyplace anywhere
[37:12] so children i might ask you a couple of
[37:14] questions just to see if you're awake i
[37:16] think brother munpo does it so very
[37:18] nicely so i'm going to kind of use what
[37:20] he used the thing is i promise you guys
[37:23] you will leave here and you'll be having
[37:26] a very wonderful jubilee if you
[37:29] pull
[37:32] not when i preach it's not about me it's
[37:34] when you pull okay it's a tug of war
[37:37] satan's trying to pull the blessing away
[37:39] from you you need to pull the blessing
[37:41] towards you the only one that's going to
[37:42] work is the one that's doing the pulling
[37:44] if you stop pulling you're going to
[37:46] start losing don't lose ground tonight
[37:48] amen
[37:50] he says brother branham says this
[37:52] improving his word and this is where i
[37:53] got it from so what i did a little bit
[37:55] of background is on my birthday i went
[37:58] and i googled what did brother brandon
[38:00] preach on my birthday which was the 16th
[38:02] of august
[38:03] and he had four sermon titles but one of
[38:05] them really just jumped out i loved all
[38:07] of them one was faith that was the
[38:09] report of the africa trip and and god
[38:11] taught brother branham a real precious
[38:13] lesson in that in that whole event of
[38:15] going to south africa and i said lord
[38:18] let that never happen to me because i
[38:20] don't want to i don't want to go there
[38:22] but all sons of god shall be tried they
[38:24] come to him
[38:25] and so in proving his word it just
[38:27] jumped out because that means it's not
[38:29] me doing it
[38:31] it actually takes the pressure off the
[38:33] believer it takes it off it's not you
[38:35] doing it god will prove his word he's
[38:37] the one doing the work you are the work
[38:40] but he will do it but guess what he will
[38:42] prove his word through you
[38:45] that is the beauty of it that's where it
[38:47] all lies this is the key of why you're a
[38:49] believer unbelievers are unbelievers
[38:52] predestinated god never had him in his
[38:54] plan that is just how god works because
[38:57] when the lamb was slain before the
[38:59] foundation of the world god knew where
[39:01] you would be if you would be a believer
[39:03] and when you will be that believer
[39:04] that's god's foreknowledge so if you
[39:06] made your believer and you accept the
[39:08] word that's who you are you are a
[39:11] believer amen don't try to worry about
[39:13] the unbelievers don't try to worry about
[39:15] the ones that walk away don't worry
[39:17] about the ones that's not in the message
[39:19] or outside if just leave them this is
[39:22] for you
[39:24] very personal he gave you the ability to
[39:26] be bright it's nothing you could done he
[39:29] just said marion in you i'm going to put
[39:32] something and that's going to respond to
[39:34] my word for your hour that's it
[39:37] and it's just i placed it there because
[39:39] you know that god gives every man a
[39:41] measure of faith
[39:42] so which means faith comes from
[39:46] yeah and who who gives hearing there
[39:49] okay
[39:51] so where does faith come can you produce
[39:53] five
[39:55] no
[39:56] faith is what lord gives you
[39:59] he gives every man a measure of faith
[40:01] and how you react to the word is going
[40:03] to get you where you need to be he will
[40:05] never trial you above your your
[40:07] fireplace if you do understand it so so
[40:09] you know when you get a limit
[40:11] and you get to that limit
[40:13] you know this is the best of recalls
[40:14] i've got
[40:15] he won't go above your head he will not
[40:18] let you drown but he's definitely going
[40:20] to take you right to the edge
[40:23] okay like like as right to the edge as
[40:26] you humanly possible can go he'll take
[40:28] you there
[40:29] to prove
[40:30] him
[40:32] not to prove you
[40:34] to prove him let's always understand it
[40:37] so now when a trial happens the the the
[40:39] whole attitude of a christian is when
[40:42] something's starting to happen then you
[40:43] turn to
[40:44] him
[40:46] because you know that in that trial no
[40:48] matter what's going to happen god is
[40:49] going to prove his word through you
[40:52] as long as you stay with the word you
[40:54] will be fine
[40:56] don't walk away from the word the whole
[40:58] word not a part of the word not some
[41:00] peace not some
[41:01] the whole word do not walk away from it
[41:04] whatever you do do ever ever walk away
[41:06] from the word
[41:08] because god can only stand for you when
[41:10] you stand on east
[41:12] amen so i hope you'll get it it's very
[41:14] simple i'm not going to go very deep
[41:16] tonight i'm going to be afrikaan say
[41:18] we're just going to go here okay because
[41:21] what i think is
[41:22] everyone lives
[41:24] and we're all alive for real-life
[41:26] christians hey we we live every day for
[41:28] god we love god we we absolutely just
[41:31] want to please him with everything we do
[41:33] i see little faith all she wants to do
[41:35] is please us
[41:36] man everything she wants to do is just
[41:38] please us that's a little child they
[41:40] just want to please mommy and daddy anna
[41:41] lisa
[41:42] am i right so you you don't really like
[41:45] when your mom and dad is angry with you
[41:46] hey or when they come around the corner
[41:48] and they've got that annalise voice
[41:50] analyst what's your second name
[41:53] beatrice man if they throw that name out
[41:55] now we're in trouble because liam stein
[41:57] we thought he's just liam stein
[41:59] permanently
[42:01] but he knows when stain is added to the
[42:03] name this is now serious so no no child
[42:06] wants that and i don't want god to come
[42:08] to me and say armant arnold
[42:11] you know i don't want him to come to my
[42:12] and it's not my second name but i don't
[42:14] want god to come to me and really
[42:16] address me and and be disappointed in me
[42:19] i want to please god because there's
[42:20] something in me that really wants to
[42:22] please him i i want to please him
[42:25] but you know as much as i want to please
[42:27] him i will still fail in my in this
[42:29] human flesh
[42:30] so that's why i need him to say lord
[42:32] remove armand out the way so that you
[42:34] can come in and you can work through me
[42:37] because the moment i get out of the way
[42:38] it doesn't matter what happens you will
[42:40] prove your word
[42:42] amen so let's go there to mark mark 5
[42:45] and verse 20 22. so all your bible
[42:48] readers grab your swords we're going to
[42:50] go on a journey
[42:51] who knows what's in mark 5 22.
[42:58] okay let's not go to 22 let's just say
[43:01] mark 5
[43:02] we've got jesus walking and legion runs
[43:05] up to to jesus and he pretty much says
[43:08] falls at his feet have mercy okay so so
[43:10] here is a here is the and i'm just going
[43:12] to build something here this in mark 5.
[43:15] man a lot of things happen here and when
[43:17] i read the scripture i thought whoa man
[43:18] we serve a mighty god we really serve a
[43:21] mighty god no one could bound this guy
[43:23] they couldn't bind this guy he was off
[43:25] his rocker
[43:27] man he was all over the show comes to
[43:29] jesus and jesus cast out a thousand
[43:31] demons there you go a legion okay just
[43:33] by gone
[43:35] but then it comes to this part now it
[43:36] comes to this part and he says now after
[43:39] this event happened verse 22 oh let's go
[43:41] verse 21 and when jesus was passed over
[43:44] again to the ship to the other side
[43:46] people gathered unto him
[43:48] and and he was knight to unto the sea
[43:51] and behold there cometh one the ruler of
[43:54] a synagogue
[43:55] uh jairus by the name
[43:57] and when he saw him he fell at his feet
[44:00] now now let's see this is a this is they
[44:02] said the ruler of the just keep the
[44:04] slides up but don't don't take them down
[44:06] the ruler of a synagogue so he was a
[44:08] pastor he was a he was a preacher
[44:10] brother branham picks it up in this and
[44:11] go listen to this proving his word in 64
[44:14] 816
[44:16] he says he was a pastor of the church
[44:18] the only thing he couldn't do he loved
[44:20] jesus but he couldn't follow jesus
[44:22] because he was scared that the people
[44:24] would put him out the church
[44:26] isn't there many of us at school at work
[44:29] that can't follow jesus with our friends
[44:32] because we're scared our friends will
[44:33] put it put us out of these circles
[44:36] have you thought about it
[44:39] but you know what god's going to do
[44:41] he's going to bring you to a point where
[44:43] you have to choose
[44:45] he's going to take you to that point
[44:48] let's look what jairus happened he was
[44:49] the iris and
[44:51] he says that verse 20 uh 23 now
[44:55] he says um and behold there cometh one a
[44:58] ruler's gyrus and he says and besought
[45:00] him greatly saying my little daughter
[45:03] lieth at the point of death i pray thee
[45:05] come and lay thy hands on her and that
[45:08] she may be healed and that she shall
[45:10] live
[45:11] now now
[45:12] remember if he wasn't a believer in
[45:14] jesus christ he wouldn't have gone there
[45:17] you know so see circumstances had him at
[45:19] such a place that that he couldn't go to
[45:22] jesus he you couldn't just proclaim
[45:23] jesus but he had to have a meeting with
[45:25] jesus
[45:26] so his friends was giving him preacher
[45:28] everyone was giving him pressure but he
[45:30] hasn't really had that connection with
[45:32] jesus christ so i'm telling you if you
[45:34] can see the story in parallel with what
[45:37] happens in your own life make it
[45:38] personal put yourself in that scripture
[45:41] if your friends say there's no jesus
[45:44] christ i encourage you to meet him
[45:47] i encourage you to start seeking jesus
[45:50] because
[45:50] when it all gets hot and heavy there is
[45:52] only one
[45:54] only one that can get you out of it only
[45:56] one
[45:57] and that's jesus christ our lord and
[45:59] savior amen now what happens just after
[46:01] this and and i'll paraphrase now
[46:04] this is all going on and 24 24 says and
[46:08] jesus went to him
[46:10] oh
[46:10] wait yeah and much people
[46:12] um followed him and and turned uh and
[46:17] throned him so a lot of people and a
[46:19] certain woman with a blood issue of 12
[46:21] years now
[46:22] now this lady comes on the scene now i'm
[46:24] thinking jesus is now busy talking to
[46:27] jairus and he's having a conversation
[46:30] and this lady while he's now busy
[46:32] walking through everyone and he's going
[46:33] to jairus house to go and lay his hands
[46:35] upon his daughter now this lady comes in
[46:38] the scene
[46:39] and and this is what strikes me so now
[46:41] remember legion god shows his power
[46:44] okay
[46:45] but nobody here saw it that was that was
[46:48] between him and legion and he cast out
[46:49] those demons then here comes jairus just
[46:52] lay your hands upon my daughter she'll
[46:53] be fine so he has faith
[46:55] and now this lady comes and she goes
[46:58] beyond that
[46:59] she goes if i just touch him
[47:01] she's not saying lay your hands on me
[47:04] she's not saying you can heal me and she
[47:06] doesn't go lord come and put your hands
[47:07] on me and pray this massive praise he
[47:09] says i only want to touch his hymn of
[47:12] his garment i'll be healed
[47:14] so that's faith so everybody has a
[47:17] measure of faith so so jairus has never
[47:19] really experienced this and he's around
[47:22] there when this event happens and jesus
[47:24] stops and he turns around and he says
[47:26] who touched me
[47:27] and now remember he's now a witness he
[47:29] is there
[47:30] and he sees this event happening and now
[47:33] what happens she gets healed and he says
[47:36] you are healed and if we drop down we're
[47:38] going to go now the two verse
[47:40] um i just want to get yeah i did make a
[47:42] note of that
[47:44] just
[47:45] hold on d
[47:49] we're going to drop down the two verse
[47:56] 22 and then he says he had suffered many
[47:58] things was physicians
[48:00] and straightway the fountain of blood
[48:02] was dried up so that's verse 29 and she
[48:05] felt the body that he she was healed of
[48:08] the plague and jesus immediately knowing
[48:11] in himself that virtue has gone from him
[48:13] turned about into the priest and said
[48:16] who touched my clothes okay
[48:18] and then he said to her we drop down to
[48:20] verse 34 and then he said unto her
[48:22] daughter thy faith has made the whole go
[48:25] in peace and behold of thy plague
[48:28] amen now this has just happened now now
[48:30] jairus is standing by jesus
[48:33] and now a servant runs towards him
[48:36] and he's got ashes on his head because
[48:37] in those days when people die they throw
[48:39] ashes on the head and he and he pretty
[48:40] much comes to jesus and and brother
[48:42] branham picks it up here and this is
[48:44] where it really got real for me
[48:46] and he says no no don't don't bother the
[48:48] master
[48:49] your daughter is dead
[48:50] so if we can go the
[48:52] he says just the next verse
[48:58] um let's go i'll just tell you verse 35
[49:02] and while he yet spake they came forth
[49:04] the ruler of the synagogue house a
[49:06] certain which said thy daughter is dead
[49:09] why troubles thou the master
[49:11] and as soon as jesus heard that now now
[49:14] just think about it
[49:15] now that dad has just heard his daughter
[49:18] died
[49:20] so he had faith enough to come to jesus
[49:22] and say hey lord just just come and lay
[49:24] your hands upon him just pray for her
[49:25] and here comes the report after all this
[49:27] he just seen and they say your daughter
[49:29] died
[49:30] how would he have felt
[49:32] it would have shaken him as a dad it
[49:34] would shake you when you know your
[49:36] daughter has died
[49:38] but jesus
[49:40] he said he saith unto the ruler of the
[49:42] synagogue be not afraid only belief
[49:48] that's all he said
[49:49] there are prophets say only believe all
[49:51] things are possible
[49:53] the same god now remember god made that
[49:55] promise jesus christ said only believe
[49:59] all things are possible
[50:01] now jesus is going to have to prove his
[50:03] word in this whole scenario because he
[50:06] said only believe
[50:08] so we carry on next verse
[50:11] he says and he suffered no man to follow
[50:13] him save peter james and john and the
[50:15] brother of james so he says to them
[50:17] let's go all of you stay let's go next
[50:20] one
[50:21] he says and then he cometh into the
[50:22] house of the ruler of the synagogue and
[50:25] see as the the tumult so tumult is
[50:28] they were crying and they were wailing
[50:30] and it was all just everywhere and a big
[50:33] mess and people were sad because it's a
[50:35] child that died and they wept and they
[50:38] wailed greatly
[50:39] next verse
[50:41] he says
[50:42] and when he was come in he saith unto
[50:44] them
[50:45] why do you make this ado and weep
[50:49] so now listen
[50:51] they're weeping for this dead lady and
[50:52] jesus walks in and goes what's going on
[50:54] here why are you crying oh what's wrong
[50:56] here she's only sleeping
[50:59] she's only sleeping
[51:01] now remember i want to bring this to you
[51:03] saints cannot die
[51:06] we cannot die we can sleep if god is
[51:09] done with you and you finished your work
[51:11] here on earth and you should pass to the
[51:13] to the to the other through the veil you
[51:15] will sleep you will not die because
[51:17] you're a believer a believer cannot die
[51:26] and the scripture for it if you don't
[51:27] believe in we all know this but we've
[51:29] got multiple scriptures for that it says
[51:31] here if we go to 1 thessalonians and
[51:35] four it says from verse 14 just keep
[51:37] that scripture just there i'll go to
[51:38] thessalonians
[51:40] is four if we believe that jesus died
[51:43] and rose again and when them
[51:45] also which sleep in jesus will go bring
[51:48] will god bring with him for this we say
[51:52] unto him to you by the word of the lord
[51:55] that we which are alive and remain unto
[51:57] the coming of the lord shall not prevent
[51:59] them which are asleep
[52:03] saints don't die
[52:06] okay so so we don't need to wail
[52:09] we don't need to cry
[52:11] god has the final say if he wants to
[52:13] raise someone from the dead he'll do it
[52:15] if he wants to keep them down he'll do
[52:17] it it is god's work
[52:20] we are believers and we just say be it
[52:22] unto me according to your will that's
[52:24] what we do
[52:25] god proves his word
[52:27] next next one please say sister he says
[52:30] and they laughed and they scorned him
[52:32] loved him to scorn
[52:36] so they laugh at jesus christ mighty god
[52:39] on earth telling them that she's just
[52:40] sleeping and they are unbelievers so
[52:42] what does he do
[52:44] sends them out the room
[52:47] so if if people leave
[52:49] yes where it comes a bit personal if
[52:51] people leave if they've been sent out of
[52:53] the room who did the work
[52:56] you
[52:58] no
[52:59] if people take offense and they go
[53:01] somewhere else who did they leave who
[53:04] pushed them out you
[53:07] no it doesn't work that way no matter
[53:09] what you say if you're a believer you
[53:11] will take it back to god this is where
[53:13] it's this is where the rubber hits the
[53:14] road if you're a believer does not
[53:17] matter what happens with you does not
[53:19] matter what people say to you does not
[53:20] matter what is gossip and all those
[53:22] things you walk right through it because
[53:24] you're a believer it does not affect you
[53:27] it has nothing to do with you
[53:29] okay you don't try to fight creeds and
[53:31] dogmas and try to justify the word and
[53:33] everything you do has to be a
[53:35] justification and if it doesn't it's not
[53:37] in your revelation then you walk away
[53:39] with it you're a believer you're a sheep
[53:40] you bear will you just say bar
[53:43] but god put it in you you're just a
[53:46] believer
[53:47] so if you do take offense i encourage
[53:49] you take it back to the one that is
[53:52] offending you
[53:53] not the brother that spoke the word or
[53:55] the sister take it to the one because
[53:57] god is the one that's going to prove
[54:00] you in that fire
[54:02] there was four men in the fire okay
[54:04] three got thrown in and then the guys
[54:06] that threw them in burned right in front
[54:09] of that fireplace okay
[54:11] now here's malachi 4 for me
[54:13] so they go into the fire but they say to
[54:15] this big king a group or whatever say
[54:17] lord
[54:18] so it's fine if if if god if god wants
[54:21] to deliver what's it what was his name
[54:22] what was that king nebuchadnezzar sorry
[54:24] i smacked it
[54:26] so he goes and they say to him say oh
[54:28] great king you know live forever you
[54:30] know and i think i got it right now and
[54:33] he says if god deliver us from this
[54:35] amen
[54:37] but if god doesn't deliver us from us
[54:39] amen
[54:41] who's doing the work
[54:43] god made the promise say i can
[54:45] and i will
[54:46] but i want you just to walk into the
[54:48] fire so guess what they don't even walk
[54:50] in they got thrown in because poor hands
[54:52] and feet and everything is tied just to
[54:54] make sure they don't escape and then
[54:56] these two fall right at the front of the
[54:57] fire and they dead
[54:59] and they have a wonderful jubilee in the
[55:01] fire because god comes down and says i
[55:03] got this
[55:04] i got this okay not the three had it i
[55:07] got this have a massive jubilee nice
[55:10] fellowship and sends them out again and
[55:12] they walk over the ashes of the ones
[55:14] that threw them in
[55:16] amen it was a hot fire seven times
[55:18] harder they should have been ashes by
[55:20] that fireplace and i take it if you
[55:23] didn't burn in the fire you would have
[55:24] been in there a long time because it
[55:25] didn't affect you anyways it was you
[55:27] know so if you're in a trial for seven
[55:28] years or that's a hotter than hot trial
[55:31] and you think you can't make it that's
[55:33] that's the devil is trying to say you're
[55:34] not a believer
[55:36] we don't have a choice we're going to
[55:38] make it there's going to be a rapture
[55:40] i'm going to walk right up brother isaac
[55:42] into a body change
[55:44] what inspired him to write that song
[55:46] and who did he write the song for for me
[55:50] so when he started singing that song
[55:51] this when we sang it and i thought poor
[55:53] brother isaac he was he was like we were
[55:56] so slow and he's like come on speed it
[55:58] up and he's trying and i'm thinking but
[56:00] don't worry we got the message brother
[56:02] isaac that's all that matters no matter
[56:04] how slow we're gonna walk into heaven we
[56:06] are gonna walk into heaven okay so don't
[56:08] worry about the details just think about
[56:11] the promise amen okay but i could see i
[56:15] could see really he was really trying to
[56:17] push us only
[56:18] but we were right on time
[56:21] amen
[56:22] i love brother isaac god bless you
[56:23] brother isaac keep writing those songs
[56:26] they fool the bride so let's go back and
[56:28] he says okay so he loved him and
[56:31] then he taketh the father and the mother
[56:32] of the damsel and him that was with him
[56:35] and he entered in where the damsel was
[56:37] laying next verse
[56:39] and then he looked at the damsel i took
[56:41] the dancer by the hand and he sayeth
[56:43] unto her now i don't know how to say
[56:45] it's nice but
[56:49] which means being interpreted damsel i
[56:51] say unto thee
[56:53] arise
[56:54] okay just hold it there
[56:56] so who was proving his word yeah
[56:59] you know that jarius had that he had to
[57:01] come there and and work up his faith did
[57:04] he have to come and say you know oh god
[57:06] great god you can do it and did he have
[57:08] to do anything else but just stand there
[57:10] and say he
[57:11] [Music]
[57:16] but god said i'm taking a rapture
[57:18] there's no rapture but he said so
[57:20] you can't overcome he said so
[57:23] okay you're not a believer sorry he said
[57:26] so
[57:26] you can't you can't defeat cancer he
[57:29] said so you can't be healed he said so
[57:32] you know you're never gonna make it
[57:33] sorry he said i'm gonna make it see the
[57:35] whole thing is all the pressure goes on
[57:38] him he has to prove his word
[57:41] you cannot prove it even if you work
[57:43] yourself into the the biggest uproar you
[57:46] can and the most dancing around and
[57:48] jumping and doing everything you cannot
[57:51] do it he will only do it when you say
[57:53] lord i'll stand here on your word and i
[57:56] need you to prove it
[57:58] so the preacher is off the believer
[58:00] he said so
[58:02] amen let's go next verse and guess what
[58:04] happened and straightway the damsel
[58:06] arose and she walked
[58:09] hello
[58:10] and she was of the age of 12 years now
[58:12] remember that lady had a blood issue of
[58:15] 12 years
[58:17] god doesn't make things happen for no
[58:19] reason he loves his numbers okay he
[58:22] loves his numbers now i want to tell you
[58:23] you can take that off now i'm just going
[58:25] to i'm going to close because i said i'm
[58:26] not going to be long tonight
[58:28] the whole point is
[58:30] let off the pressure
[58:33] you cannot figure it out
[58:35] how many of us are feeding off the word
[58:37] daily
[58:38] if you want to win
[58:40] eat
[58:42] if you're not eating you'll look like
[58:44] ethiopian and you will die
[58:47] they are if you've ever gone to ethiopia
[58:50] those people don't eat they don't have
[58:52] food they look in a terrible state
[58:55] and the moment you look at them you can
[58:56] see they are in a really bad place if
[58:59] you don't eat
[59:00] you die if you're not listening to the
[59:02] message if you're not reading your bible
[59:05] if you're not praying
[59:07] god cannot come on the scene for you
[59:09] because you're actually not going and
[59:10] standing on his word because you don't
[59:12] know his word
[59:14] isn't this supposed to be a love letter
[59:17] isn't this opposed to where you find
[59:18] yourself
[59:19] you know it's is when you get to a
[59:21] situation i remember working for brother
[59:23] i um andy and brother isaac man these
[59:25] guys they just operate different they
[59:27] said no we're here in the scripture at
[59:29] this moment and i go hey because
[59:31] remember i was still a young believer
[59:33] then just came into the fellowship they
[59:34] said no god is saying this is our season
[59:37] which we are in and i'm thinking how can
[59:39] you say that like how do you see that
[59:42] but brother and it's just where he is
[59:43] you showed me this is the scripture
[59:44] we're moving on and that was that time
[59:46] where you got that massive testimony
[59:48] where they wanted to take your business
[59:50] you know and you just said no this is
[59:52] where we're standing god made these
[59:53] businesses i will stand and this is
[59:56] where we are and brother i will never
[59:57] forget it the first first bible study
[1:00:00] the thing we had is said what's your
[1:00:01] favorite scripture and i walked in i
[1:00:02] said exodus 14 14. i the lord shall
[1:00:05] fight with you you showed your peace
[1:00:06] remember that
[1:00:08] and he goes ah cool and they were going
[1:00:10] through the fight i didn't have no idea
[1:00:12] what they were going through they didn't
[1:00:13] have to tell me but they knew we were
[1:00:15] the standing on the word in time
[1:00:18] do you know that
[1:00:19] do you know that that's where you can
[1:00:21] find yourself every day
[1:00:22] the thing is you don't find yourself
[1:00:24] where you're standing and which
[1:00:26] character you could be you could be
[1:00:28] david you could be solomon you know you
[1:00:30] could be in any season you could be a
[1:00:33] mighty prophet where where you say
[1:00:35] elijah where you stand on my caramel and
[1:00:37] people are challenging and you go lord
[1:00:39] you need to answer by fire now you could
[1:00:41] be there
[1:00:42] but see even if you in that type god
[1:00:45] wants to answer by fire not you
[1:00:48] but he's going to put you in that place
[1:00:50] because he wants to let the whole world
[1:00:52] see is what i did for elijah what i did
[1:00:55] for david i can do for you and you and
[1:00:59] you and in the midst of your battles no
[1:01:01] matter if nobody has unbelief it is for
[1:01:04] you and i will prove you i will not let
[1:01:07] your words fall to the ground
[1:01:09] no matter what happens your words shall
[1:01:11] not fall to the ground
[1:01:13] as long as you stay on my word
[1:01:16] so again i'm going to close musicians
[1:01:18] can come up we're going to have a prayer
[1:01:19] meeting by the way musicians come up i
[1:01:21] just want to sing one song
[1:01:23] this does not need to be so long
[1:01:25] i want to tell you living for christ is
[1:01:28] not a big thing living for christ is
[1:01:30] your everything amen
[1:01:33] amen
[1:01:34] just see it where it is it's your
[1:01:36] everything we have no option b
[1:01:39] a believer doesn't have the only b we
[1:01:41] have is for believer okay that's the
[1:01:43] only option b we have so if option ao a
[1:01:47] fails then option b believer comes in
[1:01:50] okay so if i don't see another option
[1:01:52] then option c comes in which is christ
[1:01:55] confirming his word
[1:01:57] okay you can take that's free of the
[1:01:59] priest okay that's the lord but when
[1:02:01] your options end that's when god comes
[1:02:04] in
[1:02:04] but i'm telling you if you find yourself
[1:02:07] walking within the pages of his word
[1:02:10] then you will know where you're standing

[1:06:28] i said this was a lady in a prayer line
[1:06:30] if this should help your faith the lord
[1:06:32] just said to read it and i'm gonna read
[1:06:34] it that's the cause by a car accident in
[1:06:37] a car that you were driving
[1:06:40] four years ago and she said that's true
[1:06:43] i said your doctor is a little short
[1:06:45] fellow bald-headed and he wears glasses
[1:06:48] he said that's right
[1:06:50] he says i said he's doctoring because
[1:06:52] that the knees are broke and become
[1:06:54] tubercular
[1:06:55] and even the flesh is rotting around the
[1:06:58] bone
[1:06:59] she said that's right
[1:07:01] and she said
[1:07:02] is there a hope for me
[1:07:05] i said it depends what your approach is
[1:07:08] to the lord jesus
[1:07:09] she said can you help me
[1:07:12] i said no ma'am
[1:07:13] no one can help you now but you have to
[1:07:16] help yourself to god's provided blessing
[1:07:18] for you
[1:07:20] and she said i now believe with all my
[1:07:23] heart
[1:07:24] and i said the lord heal you sister it's
[1:07:27] thus save the lord and you are healed
[1:07:30] and she said mr branham i haven't been
[1:07:33] to kneel she said for four years while
[1:07:36] weeping standing there rubbing her hands
[1:07:39] and a great audience people weeping
[1:07:41] watching her lutherans
[1:07:43] presbyterians and she said why don't you
[1:07:46] go down i said why don't you go down at
[1:07:48] the altar on your knees now
[1:07:50] and she said let me kneel right here
[1:07:53] right where i am healed and she never
[1:07:56] moved from those steps but she was
[1:07:58] healed and she took her place and she
[1:08:01] knew that there was nothing else to
[1:08:03] guess about she said i'll kneel down and
[1:08:06] she knelt down
[1:08:08] and for the first time in four years
[1:08:11] with both knees broke
[1:08:12] and all clauses over
[1:08:15] made over her bones together that woman
[1:08:18] like a young woman knelt to her knees
[1:08:21] and the tears were streaming from her
[1:08:22] cheeks raised up her hands to god just
[1:08:25] raised them all up and said it's easy
[1:08:28] like a little girl
[1:08:30] and she tiptoed off the platform
[1:08:32] was what was that god had it were that
[1:08:36] way
[1:08:37] now he's seen doctors that's right and
[1:08:40] doctors are fine
[1:08:41] and they can do only what they can do
[1:08:44] but god had made a way
[1:08:46] that's it see
[1:08:47] after doctor has failed in his way
[1:08:50] god makes a way so much higher than our
[1:08:54] way
