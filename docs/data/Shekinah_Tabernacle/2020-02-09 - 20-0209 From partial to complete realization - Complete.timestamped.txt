[28:35] as song is called to take time with
[28:37] Jesus it's awesome
[28:40] and you know we can be bogged down with
[28:43] temporal things and all sorts but that's
[28:46] the time to take time with the Lord and

[28:51] up and he will take care of everything
[28:53] you know and then we can't be in action
[28:56] for him so this song I wrote a few years
[29:01] ago there was a French brother came over
[29:04] and he just visually just showed a seat
[29:07] and hit one of the young people sit on
[29:09] it and then he displayed himself coming
[29:11] down like the Lord you know just wanting
[29:13] to come down and take a seat with you
[29:15] and just fellowship with you and it was
[29:17] kind of the inspiration and then our
[29:20] past appreciate that time about
[29:21] occupying the land and bringing forth
[29:24] fruit and yeah that's how the whole song
[29:26] came about when the battle is raging
[29:34] and the pressure is on when all hell is
[29:39] against us and we feel we are not strong

[49:59] verse 28 I mean I trust Sunday school
[50:09] started with a hiss and a roar and then
[50:12] God bless you all
[50:13] I mean all the teachers and all all the
[50:16] young people we love our young people
[50:18] amen I mean Joshua 10 will read from
[50:22] verse 16 down to verse 28 this is after
[50:26] we know Joshua has stopped the Sun and
[50:29] the moon and they've had a great victory
[50:30] and the victory is not over he says but
[50:33] these
[50:33] five Kings fled and hid themselves in
[50:36] the cave
[50:37] Makeda that's how you say that and it
[50:40] was told Joshua saying the five kings
[50:42] have found hid in the cave of Magda and
[50:45] Joshua said roll great stones upon the
[50:47] mouth of the cave and said men buy it
[50:49] for to keep them and stay Enoch but
[50:52] pursue after your enemies and smite the
[50:54] hide most part of them suffer them not
[50:56] to enter into their cities for the Lord
[50:58] your God has delivered them into your
[50:59] hand and they came to pass when Joshua
[51:02] and the children of Israel had made an
[51:04] end of slaying them with a very great
[51:06] slaughter till they were consumed that
[51:08] the rest which remained of them entered
[51:10] into fence cities and all the people
[51:13] returned to the camp to Joshua at magda
[51:16] and peace
[51:17] none moved his tongue against any of the
[51:19] children of Israel then said Joshua
[51:22] opened the mouth of the cave and bring
[51:23] out those five kings unto me out of the
[51:26] cave
[51:26] and they did so and brought forth those
[51:28] five kings unto him out of the cave the
[51:30] king of Jerusalem the king of Hebron the
[51:33] king of jonatha king of lesha Schleicher
[51:38] and the king of egg long and it came to
[51:40] pass when they brought out those kings
[51:43] under Joshua that Joshua called for all
[51:45] the men of Israel and said unto the
[51:47] captains of the men of war which were
[51:49] with him come near put your foot upon
[51:51] the neck of these kings and they came
[51:53] near and they put their feet upon the
[51:55] necks of them and Joshua said unto them
[51:57] fear not nor be dismayed be strong and
[52:00] be of good courage for thus shall the
[52:03] Lord do to all your enemies whom you
[52:05] fight and afterwards Joshua smote them
[52:08] and slew them and hang them on the five
[52:09] trees and they were hang upon the trees
[52:11] until the evening and it came to pass at
[52:14] the time of the going down of the Sun
[52:15] that Joshua commanded and took them down
[52:17] off the trees cast him into the cave
[52:19] were and they were had been heard and
[52:21] they great stones in the caves mouths
[52:23] which remain until this very day and
[52:25] that day Joshua took Mac down smited
[52:28] with the edge of the sword and the king
[52:29] there off he athlete astroid them and
[52:31] all the souls that were therein he let
[52:33] none remaineth he did to the king of
[52:36] Magda as he did unto the king of Jericho
[52:38] I mean let's just turn to 2nd Peter
[52:41] chapter 1 and in verse 16
[52:52] taking Peter 1 and 16
[53:03] this is for we have not followed
[53:06] cunningly devised fables which ye when
[53:11] we made known unto the power and coming
[53:13] of our Lord Jesus Christ but where I
[53:17] witnesses of his majesty
[53:19] for he received from God the Father
[53:21] honor and glory when there came such a
[53:24] voice to him from the excellent glory
[53:25] this is my beloved Son in whom I am well
[53:28] pleased in this voice which came from
[53:30] heaven we heard when we were with them
[53:32] in the holy mount and we also am we have
[53:36] also do sorry we have also a more sure
[53:41] word of prophecy whereunto ye do well
[53:44] that you take heed as unto a light that
[53:46] shine a--the in a dark place until the
[53:48] day dawn and the day star arise in your
[53:51] hearts knowing this first that no
[53:53] prophecy of the scripture is of any
[53:55] private interpretation for and why is
[53:57] that because for the prophets for the
[53:59] prophecy came not in old time by the
[54:01] will of man but the holy men of God
[54:04] spake as they were moved by the Holy
[54:06] Ghost I mean may the Lord this is word
[54:08] this morning you may have your seats and
[54:10] I'd like to take if I could titled us
[54:12] this morning it may seem an odd kind of
[54:14] a title but I want to speaking going
[54:16] from partial to complete realization now
[54:19] we read here in Joshua and others just a
[54:22] bit of a background but Joshua you know
[54:24] they just fought a mighty you know you
[54:26] know a mighty battle there they had won
[54:28] a great victory but but Joshua wanted I
[54:32] believe that the king that you know that
[54:34] the captains of the men of war would
[54:36] place their feet on the neck of these
[54:39] kings that they would get a full
[54:40] realization that they have dominion over
[54:43] this land that maybe when they were
[54:45] fighting or maybe when Jericho was
[54:47] coming down they had you know begin to
[54:49] dawn on them that this was actually
[54:50] their time to take the land that they
[54:52] were actually conquering but they had to
[54:54] come a time where it wasn't just a
[54:55] partial understanding but it became a
[54:57] full complete understanding we have
[55:00] Dominion and you know so they had to so
[55:04] it had to become a reality in their
[55:06] hearts that this land was theirs and
[55:08] it's the same thing with you and I when
[55:10] we look at the Word of God and every
[55:11] promise that God has given to the bride
[55:13] in this day it has to become a reality
[55:15] it's mine
[55:16] everything Jesus Christ died for it's
[55:19] mine it's not maybe mine it's mine I'm
[55:22] ensign and I believe that we're living
[55:24] in a season where we are coming into a
[55:26] complete realization of everything Jesus
[55:28] died for for for us to receive every
[55:31] everything in the book that belongs to
[55:33] us is now in the possession of the bride
[55:36] but we need to realize this is ours now
[55:39] we read here in 2nd Peter you know
[55:41] because this is a you know we are coming
[55:43] into a you're a new day we know that
[55:46] time is blending with eternity and the
[55:49] Apostle Peter would would speak here and
[55:51] he'd say that you know we have a more
[55:54] sure word of prophecy run to you do well
[55:56] if you take heed as unto a light that
[55:59] shine a--the in a dark place until the
[56:01] day dawn and the day star rise in your
[56:03] heart so he's saying here that we have
[56:05] so we have a more sure word of prophecy
[56:07] and you will do well if you take heat to
[56:10] it so if you pay attention to it if you
[56:11] observe it if you read it if you listen
[56:13] to it and and we know on this day we
[56:15] have a more sure word of prophecy you
[56:17] know has there ever been a generation
[56:18] upon the earth where you can go and you
[56:20] can listen to God discerning the
[56:22] thoughts intents of the heart seeing the
[56:24] son of man being revealed see the
[56:25] mystery the book come open
[56:27] I mean God's own God had his photograph
[56:29] taken with a prophet of God we have
[56:31] evidence upon evidence of the reality of
[56:34] what God is fulfilling in our day I say
[56:36] no generations like this one I mean with
[56:38] a word of prophecy has been made sure
[56:40] where it's not just man standing up and
[56:42] saying well I think this is what it says
[56:44] and they can back that up by a bunch of
[56:46] learning and and scholarship and degrees
[56:48] but a man could stand in the pulpit and
[56:50] he could say this is thus saith the Lord
[56:52] he says now if I be a true servant of
[56:55] God let him come now and vindicate what
[56:57] I've said and God would come down and
[56:59] supernaturally prove what the Prophet
[57:01] was saying this was now God's Word so
[57:03] you know now that what's us now it's no
[57:05] longer man's opinion or man's idea of
[57:07] the scripture now it's God coming and
[57:09] saying this is what my word means
[57:10] hallelujah so we have a word we have a
[57:13] more sure word of prophecy in this thing
[57:15] now so he says but yo you will do well
[57:19] if you take heed to it as a light that
[57:21] shine a--the into a dark place until the
[57:23] day dawn and the day star rise in your
[57:26] heart so now he says if see we should
[57:28] take heed to this word of
[57:30] like you're waiting for the day to dawn
[57:32] now who's ever got up waiting for a
[57:35] sunrise I could maybe only do it maybe I
[57:38] remember at the year 2000 year 2000 we
[57:41] lived in Gisborne and then we lived at
[57:43] winery beach and um we we walk down to
[57:46] the lighthouse many of you have no idea
[57:48] what I'm talking about that's fine it's
[57:49] like it was the first city to see the
[57:51] Sun so we would get up and we were there
[57:53] waiting for the for the for the data
[57:55] dawn and so we're under expectation but
[57:59] we were taking heed waiting for the day
[58:01] and then we know before the Sun comes
[58:02] over the horizon you can see the sun
[58:05] rays begin to come over the horizon
[58:06] until finally the sun itself begins to
[58:09] rise up so he's saying that you should
[58:11] we need to take heat of this more sure
[58:14] word of prophecy like someone who's
[58:16] waiting for the day to dawn now when
[58:19] when the day dawns we know it's always
[58:21] darkest before dawn we know that but
[58:23] then but then as the Sun begins to rise
[58:25] but then then then the heat of the day
[58:27] begins to manifest into the light you
[58:29] know the light where you could just look
[58:31] at the look at the horizon and you can
[58:33] see the sunrise coming up it's no longer
[58:35] just rising up and actually going above
[58:37] you the Sun rises and the race hit you
[58:39] and then and then as as the day gets
[58:42] brighter and brighter and brighter you
[58:44] begin to see where you are you begin to
[58:46] see who you are I mean because in the
[58:48] darkness you can't really make out who
[58:49] you are you can't make out even where
[58:52] you're standing amen but then as as the
[58:55] day as the Sun begins to rise you begin
[58:57] to see who you are you begin to see
[58:59] where you're standing I mean so as the
[59:01] as this day is dawned as the Sun as the
[59:04] eson has risen
[59:06] I mean Anna's son raised has has has
[59:08] come upon us we begin to see who he is
[59:11] but not only that we begin to see who we
[59:14] are I mean and we begin to see where we
[59:15] are standing in Christ
[59:17] it means it's no longer guessing well I
[59:19] think I'm redeemed I think I you know I
[59:21] think I'm going in a rapture I think I'm
[59:23] gonna overcome now you begin to realize
[59:24] I am redeemed I mean the blood of lamb
[59:27] is enough hallelujah I have been
[59:29] purchased by his blood I am going in a
[59:31] rapture I mean I will overcome I have
[59:33] overcome because he already has overcome
[59:35] I mean as the Prophet would say in how
[59:38] can I overcome he says the one who over
[59:40] all things I meant a faith in you you've
[59:42] already overcome because he he overcame
[59:45] all temptation he overcame all spirits
[59:47] he overcame the culture of his day he
[59:49] overcame everything that can be named he
[59:52] conquered it that day and he rose
[59:53] triumphant if that one is in you you
[59:55] will overcome because he already has it
[59:58] means it's not a question am I going to
[1:00:00] overcome no the overcomers in you so
[1:00:03] therefore you will overcome
[1:00:04] well you can't help overcoming because
[1:00:07] he's in you to overcome I think that
[1:00:10] should make us happy amen so that means
[1:00:12] that overcome will overcome my first
[1:00:14] nature hallelujah
[1:00:17] I'll speak I'll say that on my behalf
[1:00:19] hallelujah amen I'd say you know he will
[1:00:22] overcome all things now because he's
[1:00:24] already overcome it so that's like when
[1:00:27] you're standing there waiting for the
[1:00:28] day to dawn we were standing on the
[1:00:30] beach there and I'm not trying to do any
[1:00:32] tourism for the East Coast but you know
[1:00:34] it's quite a lovely place and you know
[1:00:36] we were there on the beach I think we
[1:00:37] know who actually climbed up a bit we're
[1:00:39] on the cliffs and we were looking and it
[1:00:41] was a bit cloudy but you know when the
[1:00:42] Sun came up we really saw where we were
[1:00:44] standing and it gave us actually a full
[1:00:47] realization it wasn't just a I think
[1:00:49] it's going to happen no oh I think I'm
[1:00:51] here I know I've arrived that's the same
[1:00:53] thing with when the word has come into
[1:00:56] full manifestation now that's it it's
[1:00:59] like a light shining into a dark place
[1:01:00] we were in it this world is a very dark
[1:01:03] place but it's a very bright place at
[1:01:05] the same time I mean it depends what
[1:01:07] you're paying heed to so until the day
[1:01:09] dawn and the day star rise in your heart
[1:01:11] so we have to come to a see a a partial
[1:01:16] realization now I I was reading the
[1:01:19] church age book and brother band speaks
[1:01:21] about these things as why I'm here but a
[1:01:23] partial understanding is not complete
[1:01:26] it's just a part of it and down through
[1:01:29] the church ages there's been a partial
[1:01:31] understanding the book has already been
[1:01:33] here right the scripture has always been
[1:01:36] here but there was only a partial
[1:01:38] understanding through the church ages as
[1:01:41] as the Reformation was dawning I mean
[1:01:43] there was only a partial understanding
[1:01:45] of what grace really was there's only a
[1:01:47] partial understanding of what the blood
[1:01:49] can do because if you go into the
[1:01:51] Philadelphia age with
[1:01:53] on Wesley he he he believed very
[1:01:56] strongly and works and of course there
[1:01:58] is no faith without works is dead we
[1:02:00] understand that but they even
[1:02:02] subconsciously begin to build within
[1:02:04] themselves that it's the blood and works
[1:02:06] because they had a partial understanding
[1:02:08] of God's saving power God's transforming
[1:02:11] power but now we've come into an age of
[1:02:13] a full realization we realize that it is
[1:02:16] nothing but the blood is not Jesus plus
[1:02:18] your own good conduct no it is the blood
[1:02:21] of Jesus Christ only a means and there
[1:02:24] is power in that blood to cause you to
[1:02:26] live a holy life it's not us trying to
[1:02:28] have a method of sanctification like the
[1:02:30] Methodists did that was a partial
[1:02:31] realization but now we're living a time
[1:02:34] of complete realization where we know
[1:02:36] that there is power in the blood that
[1:02:38] causes us to live a holy life I mean
[1:02:40] cause the stoever come causes us to
[1:02:42] abstain from the things of the world
[1:02:43] it's not us trying to keep ourselves
[1:02:45] it's his keeping power in us that keeps
[1:02:48] us how lujah so brother man would say in
[1:02:52] in in the message Shalom in 1964 he says
[1:02:56] now every true Hebrew when he meets
[1:02:57] another at Shalom other words good
[1:03:01] morning god be with you God's peace be
[1:03:02] with you it's good morning how do you do
[1:03:05] it's breaking day church it's darkness
[1:03:08] upon the people but it's a good morning
[1:03:10] to the church Christ is appearing among
[1:03:12] us Shalom peace hallelujah Shalom when
[1:03:16] we see darkness settling darkness just
[1:03:18] before day we know that the morning star
[1:03:21] is hanging yonder to introduce the
[1:03:23] coming Sun that's what's when the
[1:03:26] morning stars that's when the morning
[1:03:28] star shines it's the going between it's
[1:03:32] always darkest just a few minutes before
[1:03:34] day the black out comes the moon fails
[1:03:36] to shine the darkest before day is
[1:03:38] because the light is pressing the
[1:03:40] darkness the morning star comes out into
[1:03:43] his good morning Shalom that's him among
[1:03:45] us his word being identified Shalom the
[1:03:48] great day is fixing to break when the
[1:03:50] morning breaks eternal bright and fair
[1:03:52] when it's chosen one shall gather to
[1:03:55] their home beyond the sky when the roll
[1:03:57] is called up yonder I'll be there our
[1:03:59] names are on his book will be there
[1:04:01] Shalom good morning peace be upon you
[1:04:03] the darkness
[1:04:05] operating itself from the life God's
[1:04:07] caused it the lights are doing it so
[1:04:10] he's saying that the light as it beacons
[1:04:13] of shine pushes the darkness together
[1:04:15] and we can see darkness is gathering has
[1:04:18] already gathered together I mean but
[1:04:20] it's the light that's doing it it's not
[1:04:21] the darkness doing it it's actually the
[1:04:23] light pushing itself pushing the
[1:04:25] darkness together so we we are living in
[1:04:28] it now to me this you know when he
[1:04:30] speaks about Christ is appearing among
[1:04:32] us that SCIM among us is word being
[1:04:34] manifested Shalom that's more than a
[1:04:37] your a sermon or a nice idea it's got to
[1:04:40] be a reality
[1:04:41] this is him among us this is him doing
[1:04:43] the work this is him that called me him
[1:04:45] that saved me him that's keeping me I
[1:04:47] mean it's him appearing among us now the
[1:04:50] scripture would tell us in 1st
[1:04:52] Corinthians 13 now I'm going to come
[1:04:54] back to Joshua I'm just want to laying
[1:04:55] this foundation and we'll see where we
[1:04:57] go but a first Corinthians 13 he says
[1:05:00] when I was a child this is the Apostle
[1:05:02] Paul saying I spake as a child I
[1:05:03] understood as a child I thought as a
[1:05:06] child but when I became a man I put away
[1:05:08] childish things now for now we see
[1:05:12] through a glass darkly but then face to
[1:05:14] face now I know in part but then shall I
[1:05:17] know even as I am knowing so he's saying
[1:05:21] that you know I was once a child but
[1:05:23] when I grew when I matured I put away
[1:05:26] childish things now those things weren't
[1:05:27] done away with they were just put in
[1:05:29] their right place
[1:05:30] right but then now he says for that for
[1:05:33] now we look through a glass darkly this
[1:05:35] is he there saying this is how the
[1:05:36] church is right but then face to face
[1:05:39] there's got to come a time when we see
[1:05:41] him face to face and I believe we're
[1:05:43] living in that time right for now I know
[1:05:45] in part but then shall I know even as I
[1:05:49] am knowing so he saying that the church
[1:05:51] will come to a place where where now we
[1:05:53] we that are speaking in his day saying
[1:05:57] now I have a partial realization even
[1:05:59] though he is prophesying of things of
[1:06:00] the entire man and and where the church
[1:06:02] would arrive it be saying now I know in
[1:06:05] part but then I shall know as I am
[1:06:07] knowing so there has to come a time when
[1:06:09] the bride begins to realize and no I
[1:06:11] meant know who they are as God knows her
[1:06:14] I mean that they're not just having a
[1:06:16] partial understand
[1:06:17] well maybe I'll make it maybe things
[1:06:19] will work out maybe all be okay and oh
[1:06:21] it's just bad like this happen and this
[1:06:23] is this way and you know some kind of
[1:06:25] human reasoning evolved no no we have a
[1:06:27] full realization amen of who we are in
[1:06:30] Jesus Christ that we know is we are no
[1:06:32] and now brother Brown would speak in
[1:06:34] harvest time and he'd say Amen at now
[1:06:38] I'm getting religious I feel good he
[1:06:40] says the first church that first Eve
[1:06:42] which was to be Christ's bride
[1:06:44] how many can say I'm into that she was
[1:06:46] to be Christ's bride she was born at
[1:06:48] Pentecost not at Nicaea Rome not in
[1:06:51] London England not in the United States
[1:06:53] not in Germany with Luther not in
[1:06:55] England with Wesley not in the United
[1:06:57] States with the Pentecostal so-called
[1:06:58] she was born on the day of Pentecost
[1:07:01] your spirit felt your spirit filled and
[1:07:03] word fed every word that proceedeth out
[1:07:05] of the mouth of God and how they just
[1:07:08] but they just had to take everything
[1:07:11] just word by word a real blooming plant
[1:07:13] on God's earth representing him another
[1:07:15] bride tree his word of promise reflected
[1:07:18] him in her I mean to say now that this
[1:07:21] that this bride that he's speaking about
[1:07:24] here it's the same as when Eve was taken
[1:07:26] out of Adam
[1:07:27] now when Eve was taken out of Adam and
[1:07:29] she came to herself she uh you know you
[1:07:32] know it was Adam that came to even said
[1:07:34] your bone of my bone flesh of my flesh
[1:07:36] life of my life you shall be called
[1:07:38] woman because you came out of man and
[1:07:40] it's the same thing in this day we we we
[1:07:43] are born with spiritual amnesia we don't
[1:07:46] know where we're from we don't know
[1:07:47] where we're going we think well I'm
[1:07:48] Canadian I'm American I'm an Kiwi I'm a
[1:07:51] South African I'm all River you're from
[1:07:52] you know but then God comes along and he
[1:07:56] declares to you it's not you telling
[1:07:58] yourself he comes to you and says no
[1:07:59] your bone of my bone your flesh of my
[1:08:02] flesh your word of my word your spirit
[1:08:04] of my spirit you are you shall be called
[1:08:07] the bride because you came out of me you
[1:08:09] came out of the group just as Eve the
[1:08:11] first Eve came out of Adam Amen so when
[1:08:14] Jesus was hanging on Calvary there was
[1:08:16] the blood water and spirit came out of
[1:08:17] him that was the material a meant to
[1:08:20] make the Bride of Christ holy and down
[1:08:22] through seven Church ages that bride is
[1:08:24] being built I mean so we have to come to
[1:08:26] a full realization we are part of his
[1:08:29] word we are part of
[1:08:32] I mean just as Adam could not lose Eve
[1:08:35] because Eve was a part of him so Christ
[1:08:37] could not lose you I meant you can go
[1:08:40] look into you know with Abraham and
[1:08:42] Sarah brother Brahim said when Sarah
[1:08:43] laughed within herself doubting the
[1:08:45] promise of the visitation that she would
[1:08:47] receive you know the promised son you
[1:08:49] know brother Bram says well God God
[1:08:51] killer could have killed her right there
[1:08:52] but but because she was part of the
[1:08:54] promise she couldn't kill Sarah cause of
[1:08:57] her doubt and because of where part of
[1:08:59] the promise we're part of the promise
[1:09:02] word of this now I mean God can't cut yo
[1:09:05] God can't destroy us even if we're there
[1:09:06] doubt frustration or maybe because we're
[1:09:09] part of his word hallelujah amen so you
[1:09:13] know we have to come to a come to a
[1:09:15] place of full realization I just pray
[1:09:18] see God's got anchored in our hearts I
[1:09:21] mean we're part of his word hallelujah
[1:09:24] we're not just here to you know stumble
[1:09:26] into this message religion and go you
[1:09:29] know go through this church order and
[1:09:31] and and go through the motions no no
[1:09:32] this message has called you because
[1:09:34] you're part of his word you are the
[1:09:37] manifestation of the Bible in this day
[1:09:39] earlier but the the day's got a door in
[1:09:43] our lives the lights are going to come
[1:09:45] on then you bell see where you're
[1:09:46] standing who you are what he's made you
[1:09:49] to be hallelujah amen so then so but
[1:09:54] then shall I know even as also I am
[1:09:56] known
[1:09:56] now I believe that will be in this time
[1:09:59] not over in glory I believe it'll be in
[1:10:02] this time I mean because there has to
[1:10:04] come a time where our our emotions
[1:10:06] become secondary to the Word of God that
[1:10:09] is not our spirit realm guiding us now
[1:10:11] I'm very much preaching to myself when I
[1:10:13] say this it's not our emotions dictating
[1:10:16] how we treat others and how we speak and
[1:10:18] you know it's not our it's not our
[1:10:20] spirit realm driving us but it is our
[1:10:22] soul it's a word on the inside of the
[1:10:25] inside I mean it's got to come a time
[1:10:27] when that actually has control over our
[1:10:29] spirit realm now that doesn't mean we
[1:10:31] become robots and we don't have no
[1:10:33] feelings no that's not what I'm saying
[1:10:35] what I'm saying is that that our
[1:10:36] emotions won't drive us you know people
[1:10:39] get moody because their emotions drive
[1:10:41] then now we are we will never be totally
[1:10:44] immune or
[1:10:45] be able to escape our emotional realm
[1:10:47] you take you my spirit out of me I'm
[1:10:50] dead
[1:10:50] I'm gonna be alive I believe until my
[1:10:53] body's changed so I always have that
[1:10:56] human realm in me
[1:10:57] imagination conscious of fictions
[1:10:59] reasonings of fictions and I think I
[1:11:01] said that twice and there's always when
[1:11:02] I can't remember my card go do some
[1:11:04] homework you'll see what the spirit
[1:11:06] realm consists of but you know that will
[1:11:08] always be part of you but there has to
[1:11:10] come a time when the word actually takes
[1:11:13] that spirit realm under subjection and
[1:11:15] this is not just your flesh under
[1:11:17] subjection to the Word of God but your
[1:11:18] spirit realm comes under sin you know
[1:11:20] subject to the Word of God so and I
[1:11:22] believe that that as we look into the
[1:11:25] scripture and see as God comes along you
[1:11:27] read the Bible and God says that's you
[1:11:28] whoever found that I mean I'm with
[1:11:31] Joshua round round round Jericho I saw
[1:11:34] myself there I saw myself as Rahab Holly
[1:11:37] I saw myself as Ruth or ester or David's
[1:11:40] mighty mean whoever it may be
[1:11:41] I saw myself there I saw myself as David
[1:11:43] killing Goliath hallelujah I saw myself
[1:11:46] Peter James and John a man I saw myself
[1:11:48] there what why is that is that your
[1:11:51] imagination or God's is that you Holly
[1:11:54] that's you and they so what does that do
[1:11:57] now that may give you a stability in
[1:11:59] life I mean what's happening the word is
[1:12:01] being birth in you right and because if
[1:12:03] you can see yourself as a believer but
[1:12:06] when the devil comes along and says
[1:12:07] you're not a believer is that going to
[1:12:08] shake you know cuz you got that word of
[1:12:11] stabilizing you right
[1:12:14] hallelujah so you know we shall know as
[1:12:19] we are known and this is where we're
[1:12:22] living today I believe we need to know
[1:12:24] as we are known and say Lord member
[1:12:25] brother Brahim said in the church age
[1:12:26] book Revelation is more powerful than
[1:12:30] anything it's the most important thing
[1:12:32] pray for revelation more than anything
[1:12:34] else that's what we're gonna do Lord and
[1:12:38] it doesn't matter what age we are you
[1:12:39] say Lord reveal yourself to me reveal
[1:12:42] you who I am in you that's what we
[1:12:45] should be praying for more than more
[1:12:47] than anything else in this world Lord
[1:12:49] make make who I am in you known to me
[1:12:52] because if the scripture says then I
[1:12:55] shall know even as I am known hallelujah
[1:12:58] therefore it's gonna happen so why delay
[1:13:02] it say Lord tell me about myself I wanna
[1:13:04] know who I am and you you know the Lord
[1:13:06] wants us to know who we are in him
[1:13:08] because it manifests his victory over
[1:13:10] the devil
[1:13:12] hallelujah well how does it manifest as
[1:13:15] victory when God comes you and says yo
[1:13:17] you're perfect yeah your sins are all
[1:13:19] washed away more than just a partial
[1:13:22] understanding yes I know the blood
[1:13:23] doesn't know but when he comes to you
[1:13:25] and says I've taken your guilt I've
[1:13:27] taken your shame I've taken your
[1:13:29] frustrations I've taken you know I've
[1:13:31] taken all your guilt your past I've
[1:13:33] taken everything and anything that can
[1:13:35] be held against you and I took it that
[1:13:37] day on Calvary holy and the devil cannot
[1:13:40] hold it against you no more he has no
[1:13:42] legal right against the believer to hold
[1:13:44] any such thing against against the
[1:13:46] believer get how wonderful that is when
[1:13:50] actually says you came out of me you're
[1:13:52] not you know you are one of my
[1:13:53] attributes upon the earth Allu you what
[1:13:57] does it do down they actually glorifies
[1:13:59] him it doesn't make us a bunch of
[1:14:01] stuffed shirts no it actually just makes
[1:14:03] us more humble and yelled at Lord yeah
[1:14:05] you're the Prophet sees in one place is
[1:14:07] if the bride really really knew what he
[1:14:10] did she'd be on her knees day and night
[1:14:12] crying out if we really could just you
[1:14:16] know realize the magnitude of of being
[1:14:20] you know escaping this world having an
[1:14:24] exit door hallelujah you know the plane
[1:14:27] is you're on fire you know this world is
[1:14:29] free-falling it's on fire it's going but
[1:14:31] there's an exit door howler there's a
[1:14:34] way to get out easy has come this way
[1:14:36] you're not part of the damage Oh
[1:14:38] hallelujah you're going up to the
[1:14:39] wedding so but you know the magnitude
[1:14:41] you know if that could really just
[1:14:42] anchor down in our hearts you know you
[1:14:45] will be on streets of gold there's no
[1:14:48] there's therefore no condemnation then
[1:14:50] mature in Christ let's walk after the
[1:14:51] spirit there's no condemnation you think
[1:14:53] about the magnitude of those words I'm
[1:14:55] free from the fear of tomorrow I'm free
[1:14:59] from the guilt of my past for I've
[1:15:01] traded these shackles for a glorious
[1:15:03] song I'm free praise the Lord free at
[1:15:05] last you know incredible is but it's
[1:15:07] going to become a perfect realization
[1:15:09] not just a partial one
[1:15:11] because of its partial this human
[1:15:12] understanding with it but where it comes
[1:15:13] complete there's no human understanding
[1:15:15] it's only what God tells you about it
[1:15:18] hallelujah now it says in the
[1:15:21] masterpiece message he says Christ came
[1:15:23] the masterpiece to fulfill that speaking
[1:15:25] of the Old Testament he was the
[1:15:26] masterpiece of the Old Testament right
[1:15:29] brother Brahim said when when Adam and
[1:15:31] Eve from the garden that was God's
[1:15:32] masterpiece but then son came in and
[1:15:34] marred the masterpiece but God wasn't
[1:15:36] willing to be defeated he begin to
[1:15:38] rebuild hallelujah
[1:15:40] our God will never be defeated Amen
[1:15:43] he'll never lose holler he can't lose
[1:15:45] Amen so then he begin to rebuild and he
[1:15:47] was rebuilding the man all the way down

[1:15:53] know Isaac Christ and David Christ and
[1:15:55] Solomon you see Christ through the
[1:15:56] prophets that was God rebuilding until

[1:16:00] fullness of God it boldly was in him

[1:16:05] test was in him but then he says now he

[1:20:23] you those three but go look at your job

[1:20:45] will fulfill everything that's in the
[1:20:47] New Testament
[1:20:47] another masterpieces and making remember
[1:20:51] we shall know as we are known you may
[1:20:53] you may look at yourself and say me a
[1:20:55] masterpiece I'm more like a Picasso who
[1:20:59] knows what Picasa modern art you know
[1:21:00] you know we I've been to modern art
[1:21:04] museums and they need like two
[1:21:05] paragraphs to describe a dot on a bit of
[1:21:07] canvas what this actually means you know
[1:21:10] we're not that kind of masterpiece you
[1:21:13] see the word made flesh
[1:21:16] that's the masterpiece right so so
[1:21:18] another masterpieces and making and so
[1:21:21] you've got to look at yourself and say
[1:21:23] actually I am God's masterpiece amen
[1:21:27] you say that's awful proud no no what if
[1:21:30] he's made me to be thus this is what I
[1:21:32] am I mean you know just like if animals
[1:21:35] could speak a dog would say I'm a dog
[1:21:38] what do you do I do dog things you know
[1:21:41] or a lion I'm a lion you know he doesn't
[1:21:43] need to be proud about he's just
[1:21:44] the lion he's built to be a certain way
[1:21:45] he's the top of the food chain he
[1:21:47] conducts himself a certain way hyena is
[1:21:50] a different kind of way they they they
[1:21:52] they do different kind of things as the
[1:21:53] hyenas a lion is not a hyena a hyenas
[1:21:56] not a lion we take a vulture everything
[1:21:58] has its because it's built a certain way
[1:22:00] it operates as it's built but humans are
[1:22:04] not that way humans without the birth
[1:22:06] new birth do not conduct themselves like
[1:22:10] sons and daughters of the king right but
[1:22:13] once you meet him I mean then you should
[1:22:15] operate as you're built hallelujah you
[1:22:18] understand I mean so so we are God's
[1:22:21] masterpiece
[1:22:21] well what so how we how we built then
[1:22:24] Adam and Eve had dominion over the earth
[1:22:27] right the blood of Jesus Christ has come
[1:22:30] cleans the people Satan is being
[1:22:32] dethroned and the bride is coming to her
[1:22:35] position right that means we have power
[1:22:37] to speak storms out of existence
[1:22:40] we know the master of the wind we know
[1:22:43] the maker of the rain I mean when the
[1:22:45] devil comes and troubles us in our minds
[1:22:47] we're right to cast them out I mean we
[1:22:50] have a right to where we find them kick
[1:22:51] them out but I put up with them don't
[1:22:54] just leave him there no get rid of them
[1:22:56] that's why Joshua God told Joshua wipe
[1:22:58] them all out don't leave one in there
[1:23:00] you know that's not their land that's
[1:23:02] not their inheritance drive them all out
[1:23:05] kill them all destroy them don't let
[1:23:07] them ever grow again get rid of them
[1:23:09] same thing with spirits that come
[1:23:10] against us don't entertain it don't put
[1:23:13] up with it you know you ought to think
[1:23:15] about how you even think I mean because
[1:23:17] our thought patterns will bring us into
[1:23:18] a certain atmosphere right but you've
[1:23:21] got to remember you can't stop thoughts
[1:23:23] starting but you can stop them growing
[1:23:26] right but it's up to you to be you're
[1:23:28] gonna be a good gardener and your own in
[1:23:31] your own mind me my God gave you
[1:23:33] Dominion you know I was thinking you
[1:23:34] know this we call yo this is the
[1:23:36] battlefield that God chose well God
[1:23:39] actually said no no you can fight and he
[1:23:41] devil I'll allow you now the victor in a
[1:23:46] battle that's more powerful chooses the
[1:23:49] battlefield you take you take great
[1:23:52] victories in history it was the victor
[1:23:55] that chose the battlefield you take even
[1:23:58] even the British in the hundred year war
[1:23:59] the English when they're fighting the
[1:24:01] French and there's the Battle of
[1:24:02] Agincourt and different ones they
[1:24:04] actually picked the battlefield you
[1:24:06] miracle II though well outnumbered but
[1:24:09] they set the battlefield and they they
[1:24:11] they defeated a far more well-equipped
[1:24:14] French army so God said this is the
[1:24:18] battlefield right but remember the devil
[1:24:21] only works in here but God dwells in the
[1:24:24] soul so so now the devil can't go to
[1:24:27] where goddess but now that God can go up
[1:24:30] to where the devil tries to to live I
[1:24:32] mean so now we have reinforcements
[1:24:34] constantly coming through hallelujah so
[1:24:37] now when the devil tries to put a foot
[1:24:38] on the beach amen here's the heavy
[1:24:40] artillery nuclear bombers would blow
[1:24:43] them out of the water with the word of
[1:24:44] God hallelujah amen why are you saying
[1:24:48] that no but you but it's up to you what
[1:24:50] do you allow here see people people who
[1:24:53] are depressed right they start with a
[1:24:56] dose a depressed yes I see depressed
[1:24:59] those who are depressed they have a a
[1:25:02] very bad sad outlook on life right I'm
[1:25:06] no good I'm worthless I failed again
[1:25:10] I'll never get this right and it starts
[1:25:13] a a thought pattern which creates an
[1:25:15] atmosphere right or people who are
[1:25:18] actually successful they said no I can
[1:25:20] do this
[1:25:20] I believe no hey it didn't work this
[1:25:23] time but I'm gonna try again amen
[1:25:26] oh the devil got me there but I'm gonna
[1:25:27] get him I fell over here tripping up
[1:25:30] here but I'm gonna win the Bible says
[1:25:32] I'm gonna win I'm more than a conqueror
[1:25:33] through Christ that first love me I'm
[1:25:35] gonna win probably I can do the same in
[1:25:37] God's name we're to do it he pushes my
[1:25:39] salvation I'm gonna take a rapture
[1:25:41] that's not being depressed that's
[1:25:43] actually and it's more than the power of
[1:25:45] positive thinking because of the man
[1:25:47] thinketh in his heart so is he
[1:25:49] right so if you think of yourself as
[1:25:51] being worthless and useless and dumb and
[1:25:53] stupid and you'll never met some image
[1:25:55] in the world then that doesn't build any
[1:25:57] good kind of self-confidence because I
[1:26:00] know no Lord
[1:26:01] I know who I am but what Jesus says I am
[1:26:04] I Know Who I am right so you got a watch
[1:26:09] but then thing is you can be broken now
[1:26:11] that the
[1:26:12] of thought pattern but then it'll try
[1:26:14] and come back again because I remember
[1:26:15] he said you can't stop thoughts coming
[1:26:17] but you can cut them off Amen or even
[1:26:20] not trusting someone or being jealous of
[1:26:23] someone or whatever you know being
[1:26:25] envious of what other people have that
[1:26:26] starts with the thought there we'll try
[1:26:28] and see us think this basically yes
[1:26:30] plants and watch what's happened you
[1:26:32] know that's why we've got to be in can
[1:26:34] be content with what God made us to be
[1:26:37] amen and if we knows we are knowing
[1:26:39] hallelujah I'm part of his body upon the
[1:26:42] earth I'm going in a rapture haha fear
[1:26:46] amen amen so we're a masterpiece and
[1:26:49] other masterpieces and making has it
[1:26:52] taken him four thousand years to make
[1:26:54] this masterpiece speaking of Christ now
[1:26:56] he's been nearly two thousand years
[1:26:57] making another masterpiece a bride for
[1:27:00] Christ another masterpiece
[1:27:01] hello masterpiece of God how are you and
[1:27:04] he also preached another sermon the
[1:27:06] identified masterpiece of God and well
[1:27:09] how am I the identified masterpiece God
[1:27:10] comes and says this is you he quickens
[1:27:13] this message to you he's actually
[1:27:14] identifying you are my masterpiece I
[1:27:17] remember we sure knows we're knowing if
[1:27:20] God looks down says this is my
[1:27:21] masterpiece upon the earth we need to
[1:27:23] think of ourselves Lord I'm your
[1:27:24] workmanship you have a perfect image of
[1:27:27] me in your mind and you're crafting it
[1:27:29] well you're molding me shape me sanding
[1:27:32] bits off getting the chisel and the
[1:27:33] hammer and doing all kinds of but you're
[1:27:35] working that's why we need to see the
[1:27:37] value of our everyday life and God
[1:27:39] working in our everyday life amen
[1:27:43] there's great value say well the Monday
[1:27:45] to Friday drag yeah God's working in the
[1:27:47] Monday to Friday drag
[1:27:48] you've got to look from in that Monday
[1:27:50] to Friday drag I mean when you go to
[1:27:52] school you sit there mess comes or
[1:27:55] whatever are another math lesson God's
[1:27:56] working in there math lesson or I've got
[1:27:58] to do this I do some ordering at work or
[1:28:00] do this thing you know a lot of stuff
[1:28:02] that we do at work is repetitive if it
[1:28:05] wasn't you'd have kind of a cool job
[1:28:07] maybe you know but a lot of us just just
[1:28:09] repetitive but God wants to use that
[1:28:11] every day repetitive life to train and
[1:28:14] mold and shape you but you need to look
[1:28:16] for a look from in everyday
[1:28:18] circumstances amen
[1:28:24] and so doing it he does it by his
[1:28:26] never-changing method the same way he
[1:28:28] made the masterpieces word that's the
[1:28:30] way he makes his masterpieces because it
[1:28:32] can only be a perfect masterpiece when
[1:28:35] it's the perfect word any dirt trash
[1:28:37] injections it'll break but the heaven
[1:28:40] and heavens and earth will pass away but
[1:28:41] that word will never break you remember
[1:28:43] and cutting of diamonds you have to have
[1:28:46] a perfect tool to do it worth not just
[1:28:48] any piece we'll do it I've seen tons of
[1:28:50] them of them big grinders crashed right
[1:28:53] through it
[1:28:54] and move them big tonnes over and pass
[1:28:57] that diamond right on through no it
[1:28:59] don't break the diamond it has to be cut
[1:29:01] now he's doing the same thing in his
[1:29:04] never changing method we find out a
[1:29:07] Malachi three he said I'm God and I
[1:29:09] changed not he cannot change his method
[1:29:12] amen his word comes and cuts us shapes
[1:29:14] us into his image now brother Bram says
[1:29:18] here and so this is from the latest in
[1:29:20] church age he says now he is the true
[1:29:22] witnesses from revelations chapter 3 he
[1:29:25] is the true witness now this word true
[1:29:26] is the same word we saw back here in
[1:29:29] revelations three seven and I'll come to
[1:29:31] that later you recall that it does not
[1:29:33] mean true as in contrast to false it has
[1:29:36] a richer deeper meaning by far it
[1:29:38] expresses perfect realization and
[1:29:41] contrast to partial realization now back
[1:29:44] in the Philadelphian age the coming of
[1:29:46] the Lord was drawing nigh what great
[1:29:48] love that age manifested for him it
[1:29:51] reminds me of those beautiful words in
[1:29:53] first Peter 1:8 whom having not seen you
[1:29:56] love and whom though now you see him not
[1:29:58] yet believing you rejoice with joy
[1:30:00] unspeakable and full of glory with them
[1:30:03] we with them we rejoice also we haven't
[1:30:07] seen them but we have felt them we know
[1:30:09] him now as much as our limiting senses
[1:30:11] can tell us but one day we'll be face to
[1:30:13] face for that is for this age he says he
[1:30:18] is coming at the end of this age partial
[1:30:20] realization will we make perfect
[1:30:22] realization completed realization
[1:30:24] hallelujah we've been looking through a
[1:30:26] glass darkly but soon we'll be face to
[1:30:28] face we have been we have been going
[1:30:30] from glory to glory but soon we'll be
[1:30:32] right in the glory and in his glory will
[1:30:35] shine we shall be like and Wonder
[1:30:37] they like of Jesus our Savior divine
[1:30:39] isn't that wonderful we are completing
[1:30:42] him that is true he would not lie to us
[1:30:46] about that amen
[1:30:49] but one day will be changed and the
[1:30:50] atoms will put on immortality will will
[1:30:53] all be swallowed up in life then we will
[1:30:55] realize realization just as as brother
[1:30:59] um Paul was preaching and you know when
[1:31:01] day on Wednesday about faith faith is
[1:31:04] the substance of things hoped for the
[1:31:06] evidence of things not seen so now when
[1:31:08] God gives you faith it's actually it's
[1:31:11] the evidence of things not seen so it's
[1:31:13] the proof of things you do not see
[1:31:15] evidence is proof so now when you were
[1:31:18] when we have received faith I mean a
[1:31:20] revelation from God that we're going in
[1:31:23] a rapture it is actually the proof the
[1:31:25] evidence we are going in the rapture
[1:31:26] right hallelujah with when he reveals
[1:31:30] you that you have salvation by the blood
[1:31:32] of Jesus Christ amen is proof or
[1:31:34] evidence that you have it and because
[1:31:36] faith is the substance of things hoped
[1:31:38] for the evidence of things not seen
[1:31:40] I'll listen now now so here we are
[1:31:44] living in this age where we're going
[1:31:48] from partial realization to complete
[1:31:51] realization now the Apostle Paul would
[1:31:55] speak about death being swallowed up in
[1:31:57] victory will be swallow up in life in
[1:32:00] 1st Corinthians 15 and he says in verse
[1:32:04] 50 now I say this brethren that flesh
[1:32:06] and blood cannot in here at the kingdom
[1:32:08] of God neither does corruption and here
[1:32:10] at interruption but behold I show you a
[1:32:13] mystery we shall not all sleep but we
[1:32:15] shall all be changed in a moment and the
[1:32:17] twinkling of an eye at the last Trump
[1:32:19] for the for the trumpet shall sound and
[1:32:21] the dead shall be raised incorruptible
[1:32:22] and we shall be changed for this in
[1:32:25] crafts all must for this corrupt rule
[1:32:28] rather must put on incorruption and this
[1:32:30] mortal must put on immortality so when
[1:32:34] this corruptible shall have put on
[1:32:36] incorruption and this mortal shall put
[1:32:38] on immortality then shall come to pass
[1:32:41] the saying that is written death is
[1:32:43] swallowed up in victory
[1:32:45] how this is o death where as I sting o
[1:32:48] grave where is thy victory this thing of
[1:32:50] death
[1:32:51] and the strength of sin is the law but
[1:32:54] thanks be to God who gives us the
[1:32:55] victory through through our Lord Jesus
[1:32:57] Christ therefore my beloved brethren
[1:33:00] because of this my beloved my beloved
[1:33:02] brethren be steadfast unmovable always
[1:33:05] abounding in the work of the Lord for as
[1:33:08] much as he know that your labor is not
[1:33:09] in vain in the Lord I mean so because
[1:33:13] you know you're the reason I see it
[1:33:15] therefore is because therefore be means
[1:33:18] because of this for I've just said I
[1:33:20] mean that that death death has no stress
[1:33:23] sting grave has no victory I mean but
[1:33:26] this crop dog will put on incorruption
[1:33:28] I mean death will be swallowed up in
[1:33:30] victory because of these things be
[1:33:31] steadfast be are movable amen always
[1:33:34] abounding in the work of the Lord
[1:33:35] because it's not in vain I mean now I
[1:33:39] went to go see where because as the
[1:33:41] Apostle Paul said adders as it is
[1:33:43] written death is swallowed up I mean so
[1:33:46] it shall be brought to pass the saying
[1:33:48] that is written death is swallowed up in
[1:33:49] victory so I went to see where that was
[1:33:52] from and that was from Isaiah 25 and
[1:33:54] eight he says he will swallow up death
[1:33:56] and victory and the Lord will wipe away
[1:33:59] tears from off all faces and the rebuke
[1:34:03] of his people shall he take away from
[1:34:05] off all the earth for the Lord has
[1:34:08] spoken it and it shall be sitting that
[1:34:10] day lo this is our God we have waited
[1:34:13] for him who's waiting for him to come I
[1:34:15] mean it take us away in a body change
[1:34:17] hey man who's who's waiting to meet him
[1:34:19] in the air I mean lo this is our God we
[1:34:22] have waited for him he will save us this
[1:34:24] is the Lord we have waited for him and
[1:34:26] we will be glad and rejoice in her
[1:34:29] salvation Holly you know I always
[1:34:32] thinking I might be wrong but when the
[1:34:33] dead in Christ rise you know we should
[1:34:35] really say we've been expecting you
[1:34:37] hallelujah we've been waiting for you to
[1:34:39] come amen and then any when we meet the
[1:34:41] Lord in the air say Lord we've been
[1:34:42] waiting for you
[1:34:43] hallelujah I mean so death will be
[1:34:47] swallowed up in victory now this will
[1:34:48] come I believe when we come to a
[1:34:50] complete realization that nothing can
[1:34:52] hold us here
[1:34:54] Alleluia now brother Brahim season God
[1:34:58] hiding in simplicity he says he says
[1:35:01] that's the little lady standing sorry
[1:35:03] sorry is calling someone out with a
[1:35:04] chicken
[1:35:05] like thing on something just struck her
[1:35:07] a few minutes ago and she raised her
[1:35:09] hands up that's right lady just right

[1:35:22] got to get away from that statue
[1:35:23] Pentecostal way you've really got to die
[1:35:26] you've got to really mean it you've got
[1:35:28] something you've got a partial hunger
[1:35:31] but not a real hunger see it's partial
[1:35:34] it's got to be a complete hunger it's
[1:35:36] got to be a real hunger you've got to
[1:35:37] make it genuine see we're going to have
[1:35:39] a real hunger this world is engineered
[1:35:41] that we do not hunger no more right
[1:35:44] that's the problem with this country is
[1:35:45] we have no lack we have too much right
[1:35:49] we have too much I mean we don't lack
[1:35:51] nothing a man if I lose my job I can go
[1:35:54] to winds you know this everything is the
[1:35:56] way something to support me which is a
[1:35:57] good thing I don't say it's a bad thing
[1:35:59] I'm not talking politics now but but
[1:36:01] remember we're rich increased with Goods
[1:36:03] have need of nothing that is the lady
[1:36:04] och we live in you say but I'm part of
[1:36:07] the bride but it'll still try and affect
[1:36:09] you right so we can't just let a hunger
[1:36:11] be a partial hunger we got ever real
[1:36:13] hunger Lord it's your parish I must have
[1:36:17] you must have more of your honesty you
[1:36:18] live in my family wanna see you living

[1:36:22] ability but Lord give me a real hunger
[1:36:24] for more of you amen I'll only be
[1:36:26] satisfied when my body has changed oh
[1:36:29] you know I'm not trying to work I'm not
[1:36:31] trying about to talk about working up a
[1:36:33] hunger I say don't let nothing get that
[1:36:35] hunger out of you that's what I'm saying
[1:36:38] I mean don't just let it be a partial
[1:36:39] hunger and get and get distracted by
[1:36:41] something else there Lord you've given
[1:36:44] me this hunger for a reason there's a
[1:36:46] deep calling to the deep I mean the
[1:36:47] reason he put a hunger and a hunger in
[1:36:49] your heart is because he wants to he's
[1:36:51] got Saint to fulfill that hunger yeah
[1:36:53] brother Brown says that there's actually
[1:36:55] God chooses how close people live to him
[1:36:58] it's not man's choosing it wasn't our
[1:37:01] choosing to be the Bride of Christ that
[1:37:03] was his choosing I mean so there's a
[1:37:05] predestinate place by him for his bride
[1:37:08] and the reason he gives you the Hungry's
[1:37:11] is there's a place by me like he said
[1:37:13] the Moses God would walk past him he
[1:37:16] says show me your glory
[1:37:18] Moses walked past misses the backs favor
[1:37:20] man God says but there's a place by me
[1:37:23] stand here Moses hallelujah and it's
[1:37:27] more so for the bride there's a place by
[1:37:28] him and he wants you to stand there he's
[1:37:30] paved the way for you to stand there
[1:37:32] hallelujah and we should know and if
[1:37:34] he's called you to stand in that place I
[1:37:36] say Lord remove all distractions you do
[1:37:39] it not me trying to remove it say Lord
[1:37:41] take that hunger and just magnify it in
[1:37:43] my life amen
[1:37:48] you've got to make it genuine while
[1:37:50] Peter spake these words the Holy Ghost
[1:37:51] fell on them that heard it try closing
[1:37:54] your eyes bowing your head think it over
[1:37:56] as it is there's something wrong Lord
[1:37:59] take away my unbelief now here with
[1:38:00] mortal eyes the angel the Lord whose
[1:38:02] pictures among us being taken by a
[1:38:04] scientific proof the same pillar of fire
[1:38:06] that followed the children of Israel
[1:38:08] that was Jesus when he had died buried
[1:38:11] and ascended back to God Saul on his
[1:38:13] road to Damascus was struck down by that
[1:38:15] same pillar of fire said Lord who are
[1:38:17] you says I'm Jesus jesus said I have
[1:38:19] come from God and went to God here he is
[1:38:22] today the same Jesus seen among us with
[1:38:24] our eyes caught by a camera manifested
[1:38:26] in the spirit oh brother sister what
[1:38:28] more can God do the hour of grace
[1:38:32] hallelujah now he sees us in the church
[1:38:37] age book there's a Philadelphian Anji
[1:38:39] sees now in the six age and the eyes of
[1:38:42] God time is drawing to a close he will
[1:38:45] soon be coming back soon the cry will go
[1:38:47] forth as he comes and he which is filthy
[1:38:49] let him be filthy still and he that is
[1:38:51] righteous let him be righteous still and
[1:38:53] he that is holy let him be holy still
[1:38:55] revelation 22 11 the be power verse he
[1:39:00] says I'm so glad that my holiness is not
[1:39:02] of myself I am glad that I'm in Christ
[1:39:05] now this is now a complete realization
[1:39:08] he says I'm so glad that my holiness is
[1:39:10] not of myself I am glad that I am in
[1:39:13] Christ with all his wonderful attributes
[1:39:15] of righteousness imputed yea imparted
[1:39:18] unto me blessed be God forever he says
[1:39:22] these things saith he that is true now
[1:39:24] this word true is a very wonderful word
[1:39:26] it does not mean true and just in the
[1:39:28] sense that opposite to false it
[1:39:30] expresses the perfect
[1:39:32] realization to an idea to an idea as
[1:39:34] contrasted with its partial realization
[1:39:36] for example we recall that jesus said in
[1:39:39] john 632 moses gave you not that bread
[1:39:42] from heaven but my father have giveth
[1:39:44] you the true bread from heaven john 15
[1:39:46] and 1 i am the true vine hebrews 9 24
[1:39:49] for christ is not entered into the holy
[1:39:51] place made with hands which are the
[1:39:53] figures of the true but into heaven
[1:39:55] itself now to appear in the presence of
[1:39:58] god for us first John 2 and 8 because
[1:40:02] darkness has passed and the true light
[1:40:04] now shine a--the since this word indeed
[1:40:06] expresses perfect realization as again
[1:40:09] as against the idea of partial
[1:40:11] realization as illustrated in these
[1:40:13] verses we can now understand as never
[1:40:16] before
[1:40:16] anti-type contrasted with type and
[1:40:19] substance was shadow take example now
[1:40:22] the manna from heaven God sent down
[1:40:23] angel bread from heaven for Israel but
[1:40:26] that bread did not satisfy it was only
[1:40:28] good for a day those who ate it were
[1:40:30] hungry again the next day effort was um
[1:40:33] if it was left around it became
[1:40:36] contaminated but Jesus is the true bread
[1:40:38] from heaven where if manna was just a
[1:40:40] type and if any man eats of that bread
[1:40:42] that came down from heaven he'll never
[1:40:44] hunger again he does not need to come
[1:40:46] back and eat again the moment he partook
[1:40:48] he had eternal life here indeed was
[1:40:50] reality
[1:40:51] no need any longer for a shadow no need
[1:40:54] any longer for partial salvation here is
[1:40:56] the whole of it just like Jesus isn't
[1:40:58] part of God He is God no one could deny
[1:41:01] that G that Israel had light they were
[1:41:04] the only people that had light as a
[1:41:06] nation it was as when Egypt was so dark
[1:41:09] that no one I mean that that one could
[1:41:12] feel it but in the homes of the
[1:41:14] Israelites there was light but now true
[1:41:16] light has come the light of the world as
[1:41:19] Jesus Moses and the prophets brought the
[1:41:21] light by means of the scripture relative
[1:41:23] to the Messiah
[1:41:24] thus Israel had light but now the
[1:41:26] fulfillment of the light has come and
[1:41:28] what was but glowing word was now broken
[1:41:32] forth in the brightness of God
[1:41:34] manifested among his people as the
[1:41:36] pillar of fire gave light at night and
[1:41:38] that wonderful and that was wonderful
[1:41:41] now light and life were manifested and
[1:41:44] the fullness
[1:41:45] of the Godhead bodily so so now we see
[1:41:48] there's a great contrast between the
[1:41:50] shadow and the reality I mean and now
[1:41:53] even though you know even we look into
[1:41:55] this day you know we look into the Old
[1:41:57] Testament so much but it was just a
[1:41:58] shadow but now we have the reality where
[1:42:01] where Moses could stand on the under the
[1:42:03] blood of bulls and gods and says let
[1:42:05] there be frogs and flies and and you
[1:42:08] know whatever plague it was he was a man
[1:42:10] under the blood of bulls and ghosts but
[1:42:12] what about those under the blood of
[1:42:13] Jesus Christ I mean that are anointed to
[1:42:16] speak amen that that their people will
[1:42:18] go free now there's a far greater
[1:42:20] contrast I mean between Moses position
[1:42:24] and your position I mean when Jesus
[1:42:26] would speak of John the Baptist he'd say
[1:42:28] he was the greatest prophet of the Old
[1:42:30] Testament right but but he is the least
[1:42:33] in the kingdom of God now why is that
[1:42:34] because now under the blood of bulls and
[1:42:36] goats that the church could only come to
[1:42:38] a certain position right and then and
[1:42:41] then John the Baptist was the bridge
[1:42:42] between the older than you so now those
[1:42:44] under the blood of Jesus Christ are a
[1:42:46] higher order than even the Old Testament
[1:42:49] prophets hallelujah SAR now heed they
[1:42:51] were just under the blood of bulls and
[1:42:53] goats that was the shadow but now we're
[1:42:54] in the reality form a Mesa now that was
[1:42:57] partial realization this is a partial
[1:42:59] understanding what the blood can do but
[1:43:01] now we have the full realization of what
[1:43:03] the blood can do I mean where with a
[1:43:04] blood of Jesus Christ can come upon a
[1:43:06] person and change their nature I mean
[1:43:08] that's not them living no more it's God
[1:43:10] living in human flesh again hallelujah I
[1:43:13] mean now we have now we have reality I
[1:43:16] mean we don't just talk about this
[1:43:19] you know that's why I read that quote
[1:43:20] from Shalom God is appearing among us I
[1:43:23] mean now to me that's not back in 1964
[1:43:26] that's in 2020
[1:43:28] hallelujah that God is appearing among
[1:43:30] us I mean that we are not know we're not
[1:43:32] historian saying well God lived 50 years
[1:43:34] ago 60 years ago that same God is here
[1:43:36] today I mean to do the same kind of
[1:43:39] things I'm in hallelujah now you take
[1:43:43] you take the tour on the way to Emmaus
[1:43:45] brother Han says that Luke chapter 24 is
[1:43:48] modern events are made clear by prophecy
[1:43:51] any any reads Luke 24 the tour on the
[1:43:54] way to Emmaus so you're saying that that
[1:43:55] is a prophecy of today and so here they
[1:43:59] are walk
[1:43:59] long they have a partial and partial
[1:44:02] realization when you heal as a prophet
[1:44:04] he was a great man you know yeah you
[1:44:07] know that you're there talking to the
[1:44:08] one that they're calling was a prophet
[1:44:10] and we believe he'd deliver us from you
[1:44:12] know different things they had a partial
[1:44:14] realization of who he was but now the
[1:44:17] Lord comes himself and walks with them
[1:44:19] opening the scripture to them and it's
[1:44:23] going from a partial realization to a
[1:44:25] full realization right so here they are
[1:44:29] they have a partial understanding we
[1:44:31] believe he is going to be the Messiah
[1:44:33] let's just go this shall we this got to
[1:44:35] Luke 24
[1:45:03] now let's go to let's go to verse 17
[1:45:07] although there's go from verse 16 but
[1:45:11] their eyes were Holden I so let's go
[1:45:13] above Jesus himself drew near and went
[1:45:14] with them so here now the resurrected
[1:45:17] Messiah is going with them but their
[1:45:20] eyes were Holden that they should not
[1:45:21] know him and he said unto them what
[1:45:22] manner of communications are these that
[1:45:24] you have one to another as you walk and
[1:45:26] I said so why you said why are you
[1:45:28] talking about these things and he's the
[1:45:30] one who's resurrected from the grave and
[1:45:32] one of them whose name was Clare first
[1:45:34] answering said unto Him art thou only a
[1:45:37] stranger in Jerusalem and has not known
[1:45:40] the things which are come to pass in
[1:45:42] these days and he said unto them what
[1:45:45] things he's the reason for all these
[1:45:47] events he's saying what's going on see
[1:45:49] sometimes the law can walk with us and
[1:45:51] he can actually withhold himself that we
[1:45:53] don't feel him that recognizes him but
[1:45:56] remember that on the way to Emmaus had
[1:45:59] to be in the upper room they were part
[1:46:01] of the resurrection that's the whole
[1:46:04] reason the Lord walked with them because
[1:46:06] they were part of the resurrection also
[1:46:08] right Jesus is because I live you shall
[1:46:10] live also and they once didn't respond
[1:46:12] since were made alive when the Holy
[1:46:14] Ghost came into them they were part of
[1:46:16] the word yep and it's the same thing
[1:46:18] with us right the Lord walks with us
[1:46:21] amen because we are part we are the
[1:46:25] rapture okay let's just keep reading now
[1:46:27] and one of them whose name is Clovis
[1:46:29] answering said are you I'm only a
[1:46:31] stranger in Jerusalem it has not known
[1:46:33] the things which I come to pass here in
[1:46:34] these days and he said under them what
[1:46:36] things and they said unto him concerning
[1:46:38] Jesus admit of of Nazareth which was a
[1:46:41] prophet mighty in deed and word before
[1:46:43] God and all people and how the chief
[1:46:46] priests and our rulers delivered him to
[1:46:47] be condemned to death and have crucified
[1:46:49] Him but we trusted that it had been him
[1:46:52] that should have redeemed Israel and
[1:46:53] besides all of us that today is the
[1:46:56] third day since these things were done
[1:46:58] yeah in certain woman also of our
[1:47:00] company made us astonished which were
[1:47:03] early at the sepulchre and when they
[1:47:05] found not as body they came saying that
[1:47:07] they had seen a vision of angels which
[1:47:09] said he was alive and certain of them
[1:47:11] which were with us went to the sepulchre
[1:47:13] and found it even so but they said but
[1:47:15] him they saw not
[1:47:17] so they had hopes from there to partial
[1:47:20] realization but now the Lord is working
[1:47:22] with them you're not going to stay with
[1:47:25] the partial realization I'm gonna give
[1:47:26] you a complete one this is why he went
[1:47:29] with them and he opened the word he
[1:47:30] opened the scripture to them it's the
[1:47:32] same thing with us we had a partial
[1:47:33] realization we had a partial
[1:47:35] understanding right you have a partial
[1:47:37] understanding of what the message is
[1:47:39] about and different doctrines and
[1:47:40] different things but it goes from a
[1:47:42] partial understanding to a complete
[1:47:44] complete understanding a complete
[1:47:47] realization amen
[1:47:49] so now here they go there they're
[1:47:51] walking with them he opens the word to
[1:47:54] them then finally they come you know you
[1:47:56] know you know they come into the village
[1:47:57] of Emmaus and they can you know he's
[1:47:59] about to walk on low stay with us stay
[1:48:01] with us they sit down they break bread
[1:48:03] and as the head of the table breaks the
[1:48:05] bread so he sat down to hit a table
[1:48:06] broke the bread then their eyes came
[1:48:08] open and they had a full realization a
[1:48:11] perfect realization that's the very
[1:48:12] resurrected one we're talking about us
[1:48:14] now with us and they said to him I mean
[1:48:17] they see to each other didn't our hearts
[1:48:18] burn within us as he spoke to us along
[1:48:21] the way say even under a partial
[1:48:23] realization their hearts were burning
[1:48:25] when he opened the scripture and began
[1:48:26] to identify himself all the way down
[1:48:28] through the scripture and then he did
[1:48:30] something he did before he was crucified
[1:48:32] he broke the bread and because he did
[1:48:35] something he did before he was crucified
[1:48:36] their eyes came open that's him he's
[1:48:39] alive
[1:48:39] hallelujah and it's now the same thing
[1:48:42] with us the Lord comes we are we are
[1:48:45] caught up the world's falling apart
[1:48:46] their will fell apart yeah it's amazing
[1:48:49] brother Brahim says that this is modern
[1:48:51] ovens made clear by prophecy he doesn't
[1:48:53] focus on what everyone else is doing he
[1:48:56] focuses on his walk with his bride I
[1:48:59] mean that is the main event going on
[1:49:01] don't be caught up in global politics
[1:49:03] it'll do what it will do be caught up in
[1:49:05] the revelation of the word amen focus on
[1:49:08] that because that's your portion to
[1:49:09] fulfill I mean Trump will be Trump Putin
[1:49:12] will be Putin whoever will be whoever
[1:49:14] they'll do their thing but the bride
[1:49:16] will be the bride I mean you have to be
[1:49:18] focused be caught up don't be caught up
[1:49:20] with the news amen be caught up and what
[1:49:23] God wants to do with you that's why this
[1:49:26] message became a reality it became more
[1:49:28] than a voice you heard
[1:49:29] voice behind the voice God speaking and
[1:49:32] gripped you like nothing else gripped
[1:49:34] you that's why I believe you'll hear
[1:49:35] I mean why because he's walking with
[1:49:37] this is I'm gonna give you a complete
[1:49:39] realization I'll do that you're not just
[1:49:42] a partial on this thing how's this gonna
[1:49:43] work am I really gonna make it did he
[1:49:45] really die for me or all my son am I
[1:49:47] really forgiven he's I don't know no
[1:49:49] purpose you know it's like purpose in
[1:49:52] his friend he was determined I'm not
[1:49:54] gonna leave them with this doubt what's
[1:49:56] going on what's my state of being where
[1:49:59] am i what's happening today see he
[1:50:02] doesn't want you to just be walking
[1:50:04] along life's journey saying am I really
[1:50:05] gonna make it
[1:50:06] am I really forgiven did he really take
[1:50:09] my guilt did he really take my shame am
[1:50:11] I really gonna go on a body change am I
[1:50:12] really gonna overcome he doesn't want us
[1:50:14] to have those questions he wants us to
[1:50:17] that's why he walks with you seems like
[1:50:20] I'll show you here this is who you are
[1:50:21] this is the shadow
[1:50:23] I remember the type if the shadow did it
[1:50:27] the reality will do it in a far greater
[1:50:28] measure amen
[1:50:30] and so sorry sure this is you here you
[1:50:34] Joshua you're Caleb you'll get the
[1:50:37] mountain just keep walking
[1:50:39] amen you Abraham or you're Sarah oh I
[1:50:41] doubt it one spot I'm Sarah did too but
[1:50:44] then she had her own visitation and she
[1:50:46] wasn't down to no more she judged him
[1:50:48] faithful that he was able to do that
[1:50:50] which he had promised we're gonna come
[1:50:51] to a place where we judged him faithful
[1:50:53] amen and he takes you through the
[1:50:56] scripture this is you and as you as
[1:50:58] David does you're Solomon whoever it may
[1:51:00] be and why what's happening because he's
[1:51:03] wondering get you understand and then he
[1:51:04] takes you through Peters life you're
[1:51:07] Peter glory to God Peter goes through
[1:51:11] his great humiliation he stands here one
[1:51:13] day I'll never deny you Lord I'll die
[1:51:15] with you take just saw it try it kills a
[1:51:17] girl be the big hero of the story I ends
[1:51:20] up ends up buckling under the pressure
[1:51:22] of you know you know woman because in
[1:51:25] those days woman was seeing class
[1:51:26] citizens and those Ralphs of God since
[1:51:27] these woman then I knew one of his
[1:51:29] disciples at her he back always this big
[1:51:31] man he buckles under the pressure and
[1:51:32] swears and denies and whatever more and
[1:51:34] he's honors their sheep thinking oh man
[1:51:36] I've failed and even the Lord looks at
[1:51:38] him he's walking out and he realizes
[1:51:39] what what Jesus said here do he did
[1:51:42] because was
[1:51:44] God knows how to get us down to a place
[1:51:46] but it never ever stopped Peter being
[1:51:48] Peter on the day of pentecost amen
[1:51:51] so now the Lord knows how to get us to a
[1:51:54] point and you can see yourself in Peters
[1:51:56] life because here's Peter he denied the
[1:51:58] Lord he wept bitterly when he realized
[1:52:01] what he had just done and that and in
[1:52:03] the hour when the Lord needed him the
[1:52:05] most he rejected him he denied him he
[1:52:09] cursed doing it but then went after the
[1:52:11] Lord resurrection el and no doubt who's
[1:52:14] been there Peter you know the woman come
[1:52:16] back the tomb is empty here we took the
[1:52:20] spices we didn't need the spices the
[1:52:22] stones rolled away all the guards were
[1:52:24] gone the seal was broken hallelujah we
[1:52:27] looked in there to angel there's angels
[1:52:29] in the term saying he's not here he's
[1:52:30] risen we've come back to tell you and
[1:52:33] then Mary comes in a bit later I saw him
[1:52:37] hallelujah I didn't go on the tomb but I
[1:52:39] was there I was so down and then I heard
[1:52:42] a voice from behind me saying woman why
[1:52:44] are you weeping I turn around thought he
[1:52:45] was a gardener I think he tell me we've
[1:52:47] taken him I'll carry him away and he
[1:52:49] called me by name Holly he's arisen but
[1:52:54] you're Peter he's alive what's gonna
[1:52:58] happen winner winning when I face him
[1:53:03] hallelujah and his Peter with this
[1:53:06] heaviness and then they're fishing and
[1:53:11] then they hear a call from the sea yo
[1:53:14] see sure children you godly meet and
[1:53:18] then he's like no I be fishing all night
[1:53:21] and then John actually looks and says
[1:53:23] Peter Peter it's the Lord now Peter
[1:53:27] doesn't know how he's going to be
[1:53:28] received he's failed
[1:53:29] he's bitterly utterly failed member for
[1:53:33] Jesus died they had a big dispute among
[1:53:35] themselves who's gonna be the greatest
[1:53:36] and maybe Peter cuz he you know he's the
[1:53:39] one who jumped out on the walked on the
[1:53:40] water he did although thou art the
[1:53:42] Christ son living God is always the
[1:53:43] first you know well I'll show you you
[1:53:46] know I'll be the greatest soul defend
[1:53:47] him and his great time of need you'll
[1:53:49] fell apart the Lord's on the on the
[1:53:53] seashore and he thinks to himself he
[1:53:56] doesn't know how he's going to be
[1:53:57] received
[1:53:58] but something intimacies I must get to
[1:54:00] Jesus hallelujah I must get to him he
[1:54:05] jumps and swims there hallelujah bread
[1:54:07] and fish upon the fire and the Lord
[1:54:10] looks and says Peter do you love me
[1:54:11] I love you Lord feed my sheep Lord do
[1:54:14] you love me you lord i love you feed my
[1:54:17] lambs Peter do you love me Lord you know
[1:54:20] I love you
[1:54:21] howling who's been there amen
[1:54:26] remember it doesn't stop what God has
[1:54:31] ordained you to be we fail and then we
[1:54:35] leave that then did we use that as a big
[1:54:37] question mark against us well that
[1:54:39] happened member Peter was a believer he
[1:54:42] had the revelation thou art the Christ
[1:54:43] the Son of God he wasn't a Pharisee he
[1:54:45] wasn't a make-believe like Judas he is a
[1:54:47] real believer but he fouled miserably
[1:54:49] now God wanted him to know he didn't
[1:54:54] want him to have a partial realization
[1:54:55] he wanted him to have a complete
[1:54:57] realization
[1:54:58] you've been washed in my blood you're a
[1:55:01] new creature and me I don't hold those
[1:55:03] things against you sure you did those
[1:55:05] things and it's in the scripture mention
[1:55:07] reading that mention being Peter and
[1:55:10] reading it you know you sit around you
[1:55:12] get the scroll out you know you you read
[1:55:15] that about yourself in the Bible you
[1:55:18] know if Allah has written down there be
[1:55:19] a lot of spots we wouldn't be proud
[1:55:21] about I mean we'd say please don't write
[1:55:23] that don't record that there'd be a lot
[1:55:25] of spots right but but the blood of
[1:55:28] Jesus Christ does such a cleansing work
[1:55:30] I mean it God didn't remember it no more
[1:55:32] I found it's not held against you no
[1:55:34] more he does remember in his records
[1:55:36] it's gone hallelujah
[1:55:38] and he wants you to recognize that that
[1:55:41] when you go to praise God and say I'm a
[1:55:43] believer the devil can't say oh but what
[1:55:44] about this what about with the brothers
[1:55:46] he said devil my God took care of it
[1:55:48] I've been cleans I've been sealed I
[1:55:50] being redeemed holy and not just a hope
[1:55:53] so I know so hallelujah he wants us to
[1:55:57] know that we know that we know that we
[1:55:59] know I mean when God came to know said
[1:56:02] build an ark he had such confidence
[1:56:04] we're gonna build this Ark doesn't
[1:56:06] matter what voice came against him what
[1:56:08] kind of criticism he's like no we're
[1:56:10] building this
[1:56:12] maybe your son said daddy sure this is
[1:56:14] the way this is the way God called me
[1:56:17] you have confidence God called me God
[1:56:20] called me by this message wasn't me
[1:56:22] that called me wasn't someone else God
[1:56:24] called me that's why I'm a believer and
[1:56:26] the reason he called you is because he
[1:56:28] took care of your sin your shame your
[1:56:29] first birth whatever it may be God
[1:56:31] washed it away hallelujah
[1:56:36] well I say that say Lord anchored down
[1:56:39] to my soul God took care of my past
[1:56:42] Jesus drop the charges however you want
[1:56:44] to say it it's been taken care of it's
[1:56:48] no longer a partial realization that's
[1:56:52] got to be a complete this hour fail
[1:56:55] every day just get back up get back up
[1:56:58] remember when when when Joshua lost the
[1:57:01] Battle of AI we don't think about that
[1:57:03] one but they didn't just quit and leave
[1:57:05] the land and go back to Egypt they said
[1:57:08] Lord what do we need to do what's going
[1:57:09] on God showed them they continued on it
[1:57:13] should be the same thing you've
[1:57:14] miserably failed Lord search my heart
[1:57:17] did any wicked way and me cleans me try
[1:57:19] me pick me up let's keep going now he
[1:57:23] says then I'll just finish this finish
[1:57:25] with this rather but the Jews back there
[1:57:27] in the time of Jesus did not want to
[1:57:29] accept that sacrifice perfect sacrifice
[1:57:31] the blood of bulls and goats made
[1:57:33] nothing perfect but once God's ordained
[1:57:35] method I mean it was once God's ordained
[1:57:38] method rather but now Christ having
[1:57:40] appeared in the flesh and by the
[1:57:41] shedding of his own blood has put away
[1:57:43] sin and by that offering of himself has
[1:57:47] made us perfect the Jews could not take
[1:57:49] that but what about that Philadelphia
[1:57:51] Aegeus and other ages - did they really
[1:57:54] accept this reality in Christ no sir
[1:57:57] even though the Luther brought out the
[1:57:59] truth of justification the the Romish
[1:58:02] church and its eastern counterpart the
[1:58:04] orthodox church still clung to works now
[1:58:06] works are fine but they don't save you
[1:58:08] they don't make you perfect
[1:58:10] that's Christ or parish and it there's
[1:58:12] not even Christ and works it's Christ
[1:58:15] alone this age began the years of
[1:58:17] Arminianism that does not believe that
[1:58:20] that in Christ as the reality it does
[1:58:24] not sing nothing but the
[1:58:25] for it sings nothing but the blood a my
[1:58:27] own conduct now I believe in good
[1:58:29] conduct if you are saved you'll do
[1:58:31] righteously we have already gone over
[1:58:33] that but let me tell you now salvation
[1:58:36] is not Jesus plus it as Jesus alone I'm
[1:58:38] reading from the church age book of your
[1:58:40] wandering salvation is of the Lord from
[1:58:42] start to finish it's all God let his
[1:58:44] life be in me let it be his blood that
[1:58:46] cleanses me let it be his spirit that
[1:58:48] fills me let it be his word of my heart
[1:58:50] and mouth let it be his stripes that
[1:58:52] heals me let it be Jesus and Jesus alone
[1:58:55] not by works of righteousness which I
[1:58:58] have done no sir Christ is my life amen
[1:59:00] I feel I could just go on about these
[1:59:02] truths but I'll give you one more
[1:59:03] thought it's about that wonderful hymn
[1:59:06] that a B Simpson wrote once it was a
[1:59:08] blessing now is the Lord once it was the
[1:59:11] feeling now it is his word once his gift
[1:59:14] I wanted now the giver one once I sought
[1:59:17] for healing now himself alone all in all
[1:59:20] for ever Jesus will I sing everything in
[1:59:22] Jesus and Jesus everything there isn't
[1:59:26] anything in this life satisfying as it
[1:59:28] may be as good and fine as it may be but
[1:59:31] you will find the sum total of all
[1:59:33] perfection in Christ everything fades in
[1:59:36] into insignificance besides him I'll
[1:59:42] leave it there
[1:59:43] amen god bless you friends we have the
[1:59:45] musicians please
[1:59:50] I'll get the Joshua maybe next week amen
[1:59:56] but it's gotta be let him let him
[1:59:59] establish it in your heart
[2:00:02] amen it's not maybe I'll get thee so
[2:00:05] Lord show to me the power of your
[2:00:08] salvation the reality of it there's not
[2:00:10] me wondering if I'm going to get there
[2:00:12] Lord show it to me Lord the power of at
[2:00:17] the power of his blood I mean that's Dan
[2:00:20] shall we
[2:00:23] maybe let's just sing that shall we
[2:00:28] nothing but the blood of Jesus what can
[2:00:32] make me whole again oh this thing that
[2:00:34] song you chose me he chose me
[2:00:37] I didn't choose me he chose me and if he
[2:00:39] chose me he chose me hallelujah that's
[2:00:43] very simple but you know I think we can
[2:00:45] worship the Lord amen

[2:01:02] nail-scarred
