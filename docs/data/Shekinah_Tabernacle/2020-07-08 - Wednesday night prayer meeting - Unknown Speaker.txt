the hour is gonna be ministering the Sunday so come expecting amen let some got a couple of scriptures here we'll go though first we're going to just start in mark chapter one and then we're going to go to first Corinthians chapter 9 and then our trustee of once well like to thank brother Matthew for fixing the camera pays the Lord amen amen we really really appreciate that amen first so mark 1 and verse 35 to 37 you could just turn me down a bit that would be good it says here and in the morning rising up a great while before day it and departed into a solitary place and they're prayed and Simon and they that were with them followed after him and when they had found him basically done to him all men seek for thee then we're going to go to first Corinthians chapter 9 and from verse 25 so 1st Corinthians 9 and 25 we'll start from actually verse 24 first Corinthians 9c1 they're the ones either turned off or slid or what if you call it know ye not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize so run that you may obtain in every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown but we an incorruptible I therefore so run not as uncertainly so fight I not as one that beateth the air but I keep under my body I keep under my body and bring it into subjection least that by any means when i have preached to others i myself should be a castaway amen this berries in a word of prayer lord jesus once again we have come into your house Lord to be in your presence Lord to worship you in spirit and truth and just want to ask dear God would you please come among us tonight would you meet every need Lord would you touch every life heal every sick one Lord restore the backslider save the Lost Lord encourage us along the way Lord may you grant it dear God we also ask you'd be at those who are streaming in Lord I pray you would be very real Lord wherever they are in their homes or with their father be the portion dear God and those who a second body touch them for your glory Lori SAS Lord may just bring us aunt pria Lord for this prayer service tonight Lord may you grant a dear God I pray you just anoint speaker in here one more time well we know one word from you chain can change the whole world hello that's what we're seeking after Lord if you would just come among us Lord and do what only you can do father may you grant a place for your glory forgive us all our sins in our wrongs law cleanser that cleanser hearts Lord Jesus cleanses of our secret faults Lord please grant it dear God and Jesus Christ then we ask Lord amen I mean god bless you you may have your seats tonight I I want to kind of maybe start a bit of a subject I'm just gonna hit maybe some highlights but I want to talk about it working according to the laws of God I got this from brother Berman he he mentions a few times and I'll just I'll just take one of them where where he would speak about you know these laws as an as in gravity and and you know he he says now he says it as I said God will never go outside his laws to do anything if you've got an artesian well on this hill flowing water all over the air and on and on this other hill over here you've got a crop burning up you can stand on this hill and holler o water run over there and fill my crop I water get to my crop it'll never do it but if you'll walk a work according to the laws of gravitation you can water that crop I mean if you've got here or a sinner laying here or a man that wants to be right but he can't give up drinking tank about smoking can't give up lusts and things if you'll just work according to the laws of God let the Holy Spirit come in there then he's no more his own he will stop that thing because the Holy Ghost takes him over but you've got to work according to the laws of God the rules of God I mean now how many of you here's a young man in a wheelchair some stretcher cases little water here baby heart trouble stomach troubles and everything else sitting right here you're right in a dark spot aren't you now all the screaming you do to God that isn't it electricity will light up if you'll work according to the law of electricity is that right if you had an artesian well on this side now there's another quote I'm just I just writing them all together if you had an artesian well on this side of the hill a thousand gallons of water per minute no Ron that sigh the hell another hell you've got a crop burning up needing that water well no matter how much you'd scream to water go up on that hill and water that crop it'll never do it but if you walk it if you work according to the way of gravitation and run the water over on the hill it'll water the crop is that right but you've got to work according to the law of gravitation I mean well now if God is here is here all in this building right now do you believe that he says we're all conscience wish I can't get it all in one night you see you're conscious that God is here now the only thing we can do is work according to the law of God for our healing is that right what is the law of God he is love perfect love casts out all fear love and faith is the same thing see love perfect love casts out all fear which gives faith you see Amen so you know we have to work according to the laws of God now one illustration jesus said about the four types of of ground and he says one is one is the others you're the sower so is the seed then the birds come eat it up fly away and you're the weeds come and choke it out and all these things and he speaks about the weeds being the cares of life and different things so you know what what good nothing see what happens is we come into church now I'm not saying you do what I'm about to illustrate but this is working against the laws of God who should brother Brahim say how how churches are praying for a revival working right against it see so so they're not they weren't working toward your with the law of God was the law of God Lord empty me out change my life that I don't come to you according to what I think but change my thinking to match your word that you can do what you want in my life see that is working with the laws of God but to work work against it with the parable of the sower is that is that was a good of being having a wonderful service God moving pouring his spirit out and then we go and let the kids of life choke it out or we go and do something that's actually fills us with unbelief and superstition and doubt you know you're just working against what God has tried to do in the service you see so we don't just want what you know yours the Apostle Paul would say we don't want to race run this race with uncertainty you know we don't just want to fight the air and haphazardly run around and you know we want to walk according to how God wants us to walk you know what you know what good is that you know as the scripture says one principle of the scripture says father's provoke not your children to anger least they become discouraged at least they just give up and say who cares I'm not gonna serve God I'm sick of this I'm oh yeah why because they're being pushed down all the time being being frustrated that is work but of course the fathers how it would be honestly my children love the Lord but if they treat the child the wrong way they are working against the law of God I mean so you know we're gonna there's a lot of things in the scripture that equip us I mean that if we now we know we can follow the scripture to the leader bond this God comes on the scene it won't do any good but you got to give God something to work with no brother Brahim he would say that he was meditating on the scripture of of of mark 11 maybe you want to throw that up mark 11:23 I believe it is 22 to 26 and you know when when brother Brown was out hunting and and he was thinking about how how yo Jesus would would say whosoever shall say unto this mountain mountain be thou removed and cast into the sea and shall not doubt it in his heart but shall believe that all those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore I say unto you what things soever you desire when you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them so so the Prophet was thinking about the scripture now this is this is another kind of principle if you want God to come upon the scene think about him remember the tur on the way to Emmaus and they are talking about what God was doing in their day right they were talking about the crucifixion they talked about what Jesus you know all the miracles and the healing and the salvation and Lazarus coming out of the grave and the storms being silenced and all those incredible things they were talking about what God was doing in their day they couldn't quite put it together but they're talking about him and if you want him to draw near talk about him I mean who's ever had some fellowship run a conversation you feel the atmosphere just changes you talk about the Lord why that's him drawing near I mean because what we want we pray that God would anoint our fellowship that what we took about the supernatural would take place right because we're a people of the supernatural library we need a supernatural God to do supernatural things I mean it's not a natural just serving God as a man would naturally that though that it is good that's not gonna do it we need God to come upon the sees salvation is a supernatural thing someone gives it heart to God it's a supernatural thing someone repents it's a supernatural thing right I mean hallelujah so you know we need God to come in a supernatural way so brother Branham was thinking about the scripture and then and then the Lord begin to deal with him and challenge him about well what are you out doing I'm hunting what are you hunting squirrels what do you need squirrels well say let there be a squirrel you know the story but he was thinking on the scripture and then God came to interpret that scripture to him the Prophet sees who wouldn't be wonderful for God to interpret the scripture to you you know actually prove it to you in your life how it's more than just well this is how you're just remembering it or yo yo but God comes down says I want to prove the scripture in your life I want to show you what I meant amen you know that's I would like that myself so he's thinking about these things and then the Lord came down and you know the rest of the story as he spoke and the squirrels were created exactly where he said there'd be but the principle I'm trying to get across now is that he was thinking on the scripture I mean so we're going to really think about what takes up our mental space what takes up these top two inches at all for me maybe one inch I don't know how much is there but you know you know what what takes up because remember we have the same 24 hours in a day that that anyone else has in the world right but but what is going on in here because we are a steward of this yeah we're a steward of this right this is the thing God said well he say you know this thing we've got to protect it hallelujah mean but God doesn't just push a button and now I'm a robot any-any just punches in a function I do this I go do this no no we have a free moral agency in the matter right so it's up to local who we going to give our choice to and really who you've given your choice to will really be a for a large part what goes on in here it doesn't mean the devil won't come in here and try and battle you in war but it depends what you give yourself to I mean so you know we're going to think about I trust we you know sure we have to think about our job and what we're gonna eat what we're gonna you know where we're going to live all those natural things we can't forsake them but when it comes to everything else what do we think upon because maybe you know to me we you got to give God something to work with Here I am Lord work with me Lord let through my life amen brother Brahim said in perfect faith when he's relating about the squirrels being created he sees the Great Physician who is here who said these signs shall follow them that belief if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover and if they say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but can believe if he can create squirrels who has who has no way at all or nothing there to believe that's my own faith that goes and does that my faith and what he challenged me to ask he challenged me to ask it I received his challenge and obedience to his word I asked it and it appeared God and heaven knows that's true can he also heal the sick can he lift me up with the faith pardon me this away even for people even if they can't climb up to that bracket if they can't do it he can use my faith he can lift me to that place I'm climbing for you I'm believing for you I'm speaking for you he see and and and to me that's a powerful statement but but that should be how Christians should be I'm gonna believe for my brother I'm gonna believe for my sister I'm gonna lift them up before God I'm gonna create an atmosphere I'm gonna be friendly to them I'm gonna you know be their buddy I'm gonna help them along life's journey but I'm gonna be believing for them that's how we should be shouldn't we yeah I mean it doesn't matter what lion's then we get thrown into it we should be believing I mean they're gonna come out back in the victory cuz the Lord's going to bring them through it Allu you so the Lord challenged him to take him at his word but he was thinking about that scripture amen you know the Apostle Paul would say if we can just go back to I believe it was theirs in Philippians for the end of the script into the well Philippians 4 invoice he has rejoiced in the Lord all the way and again I say rejoice let your moderation be known unto all men the Lord is at hand be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God now we know we're just going to pause it just there he says but in everything by prayer and supplication prayer is the most empowering on the earth prayer and their prayer in the heart of the believer is incredible powerful thing I mean we know that prayer amen can change Nations prayer can bring salvation prayer can bring deliverance prayer can bring healing I mean prayer can take people from darkness into light I mean prick and change someone's eternal destination hallelujah prayer is the most powerful thing I'm a prick and deliverer from demon power I'm in prayer can cast the demons away and bring the Holy Ghost on the scene maybe that's why prayer can do I mean if prayer is incredibly powerful I mean so she's been in everything by prayer and supplications they mean with Thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God now we know that our God is not an errand boy I mean he's not someone we make him do stuff he's not like one of our children says go do this pick this up do this that's not how we treat God amen he's not you know you don't just give him a to-do list only and say I've got this need this need this need Amen Jesus Christ's name Amen good boy you know but that's not always the case because we know prayer is not just - you know we know brother Brahim says that prayer can change the mind of God right you can actually intercede for someone and actually change the mind of God and God worked on their behalf but prayer first and foremost in my opinion should be not to change God's mind it should be to change our mind I mean because remember Jesus and now we just took that scripture from from Mark one but Jesus was a man of Prayer right he resorted many times two a lot of time and prayer and it's because the man part of him had to stay in fellowship head to stand communion with the God that was in on the inside of him right that's why he was a man of prayer to stay and oneness with the Father dwelling on the inside of him and now if the Son of God who was virgin born without sin had to be that way how much more sinners saved by grace how much more the redeemed ones of the earth amen so I believe that prayer first and foremost should be Lord changed my thinking to match your thinking and every single situation my brother says to have an order against me Lord change my thinking that I would think as you would think towards them that there's a sinner that's done me wrong Lord changed my thinking that I don't want to get one back at them but Lord I want to throw I want to stand in the gap for them that Lord your mercy would fall upon them it should matter how we be amen I mean so so it should be you know because your man is an incredibly selfish thing we're born with every bone of selfish mimimi III now now now you know and if not now when and I want it now and we live in this instant age but when you meet the Lord it's not my will but thy will be done remember Jesus Jesus one Calvary and Gethsemane amen he won the victory on his knees when he surrended as well over hallelujah remember his ministry started and death to self and it ended in death to self because he went to the Jordan we know that Jordan is a representation of death amen and he was baptized in the River Jordan so so it started and death and it ended and death he's our example and we all want to be like Jesus right so that means we're going to start with a real death not just a conviction not just all I did wrong but a real full death because the problem as many people get convicted they get wounded but they don't lay themselves completely on the altar and they go for a period and wrong but now they've got to die on the altar I mean a hab was a such a man I have tried to find favor with God and everything got fine he just went back to doing he did but never fully surrendered to the Word of God we don't want to be in a hab throwing out old Tantrums and so on but we've covered that so we won't go back to that one Amen see you know but we lord help us you say why are you trying to say these things we're living in a crazy time we're living in a crazy time and it's going to get crazier so we need to be balanced in a crazy time and the only way we will stay balanced in this time is if we stay one with the Lord right there's not our flesh driving us or our spirit you know the problem is the devil you're the worst thing we can do is sympathize with a spirit right if you simple sir if you sympathize with a spirit you come under its influence see see someone with you know you know some depression devil on them or some pride feeling sorry for themselves devil you start sympathizing with that it'll come on you right but eventually stand in the gap for your brother or for your system amen then you can really pray for them then you can deliver them I mean but that but was the devil do he works on emotion he works on emotion you know someone hurt you you feel offended and he takes a defense any any and he tries to breathe into the coals and make it a lot worse and makes it grow in your mind and next thing you know you're just living through a big complex instead of giving it to the Lord and being free amen but Jesus was a man of Prayer the Apostle Paul was a man of prayer brother Brown was a man of Prayer I'm not talking about time necessarily but quality you know you can be driving down the road God comes on the scene you can be in your prayer closet God comes on the scene they're all important I meant but as King David said may the words of my mouth and the meditations of my heart be acceptable in thy sight o my strength in my Redeemer amen so it can be it can be five minutes five hours whatever it is whatever you need to do but prayer is very powerful amen and if they should be a praying people of this hour should be the Bride of Christ not to put a man-made thing upon you but we should be lord give us a burden as brother and Paul preached a while ago give us a burden of Prayer I mean not a man generate a burden but a god-given burden I mean cuz the victory is won in prayer our belief I mean so and so be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving that you're a crispy made known unto God now I uh I won't get to verse 7 but you know we should always be on the lookout for lost souls we should be mission minded I mean because remember as I said on Sunday what's our purpose our purpose is to find that last one they were going home and that could be anywhere anyone any place any time could be that last one and we're going to keep that on our mind Lord where do you want me to be to find that last one shouldn't it be we should be mission mind at all we need to go to Ecuador no no they're probably next door brother Tony Emma said don't go to Nick amigo until you go next door right that could be your neighbor who knows they could be your school they could be at your job they could be anywhere but the thing is if we stay in in in fellowship with the Lord that is not us our mind our opinions but it's his mind his word living then wherever he takes us we'll be content wherever he takes us you know the Apostle Paul went through incredible things and he lists them shipwrecked beaten stoned peril you know peril on the sea pair of the land robbers all those things he would he was actually so kind of poor that that he'd write to Timothy and say when winter's coming I need my coat this is the kind of state heals in but he said and well I think we'll get to it but he says I found you know to be content and in you when you're stoned he was in the will of God when his imprison is in the will of God he's been shipwrecked is in the will of God when the snake venom is in the will of God I mean when he is when he is in trouble by false brother and whoever he's in the will of God hallelujah he didn't let those things move him why because he stayed and fell ship with the God on the inside of him when the Holy Ghost came into her may many stayed and fellowship with the God that was leading him yeah I mean remember the scripture says that the sons of God who lived by the Spirit of God it means that's us I mean so we gotta stay because remember it's either our flesh can lead us or the Spirit of God it depends who you pander to right amen because yo yeah I know I've said it before but you know we know when we're carnal we know you know you know when here in that Carter you're in carnal mode oh lord help us but he know when the law when you repent in the spirit Lord and that sweetness comes back hallelujah I mean so so he went through many things but he didn't get upset about it I don't read in the scripture knew her as a pity party where he starts to get angry at God upset Lord why did you let this happen he was in a jail with Silas and they begin to pray they'd just been beaten they're in the inner prison now the other prisons the nasty one that's the yucky one on the inside the gloomy damp thing he wasn't that one with Silas and they begin to pray oh and they begin to worship God they didn't worry about their beatings in there and their rejection and all those things they just begin to praise God and God came down in their press press service and their worship hallelujah amen because what I guess maybe they realized maybe Paul said Silas yes Paul we're here for a reason do you think we're just saying wrong Paul nope why is that we preach the truth while we're here I don't know why don't we just pray isn't he wonderful Silas oh so wonderful Paul I was blind but now I see he's my Redeemer I heard about a god but now he lives he's more than a story to me Oh Silas I was a Pharisee of the Pharisees I was up to here in religion I thought I was the greatest thing upon the earth hallelujah since Moses but then I meet him I meant the quyllur of fire Oh let's sing a song Paul Holly what should we sing I don't know I'm not gonna try but you know but it's what's on the inside comes out you know when you squeeze an orange you get orange juice right these are saying you can't get blood from a turnip because there's no blood in a turnip you can't get blood from a stone because there's no blood in the stone but what do you squeeze you'll get out I mean what the thing you squeeze you get out so when the believer comes under pressure what comes out is what's on the inside of them you know we can all have it's very easy to be a believer reps you really win your Sunday night at a convention there's no problems the devil is just far far away you're having a jubilee time it's very easy isn't it everything's fine glory Lord I'm ready now where's your calendar I'm sure it's today we're going but it's in the hard times when the pressure comes on it really shows what you're made of lord help us when you squeeze us I mean when you trice will come forth as gold amen so we should always be mission minded you know Philip he was having he was there leading a revival and God told him never go down to the desert he wasn't disappointed they snore him fussing saying but it's perfect here Lord no no he was he was a and oneness with the Lord that led him doesn't that right and he went down there and met the Ethiopian eunuch and you know the rest of story but the thing is wherever we find ourselves we should be Lord there must be a soul here there's a reason I'm in this place it's not just for me it's must be for someone else Shirley chin that should that be our our our heart we're here for a purpose to be a witness remember it's not about how successful that you gauge your walk with God remember when we're led into heaven I say well done my good and faithful servant good and faithful not good and what you thought was successful he said well I've never you know I've never done something great for God just living for him as an incredible thing I mean whatever he says this is this is your purpose you're gonna be housewife be the best one be a father be the best one being a worker be the best from whatever you are in life just be the best one whatever your purpose of life is and you say well done my good and faithful amen hallelujah amen so we should be faithful and whatever the Lord's putting our hands and whatever state we find ourselves in we should be content amen verse seven and the peace of God which passeth passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus and now notice he's saying this finally brethren remember if I put a title this I said you know working according to the laws of God so Paul is giving some instruction finally my brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are have a good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise think on these things so I think it's a good idea you're a thought starts wandering from this lobe to the next lobe to the frontal lobe and you know you should begin to think does it fit in these categories right instead of just letting your imagination wander yes right you know the devil's imaginations just been released on this age through through entertainment through social media the internet that's just his inspiration his imaginations just popped out over everywhere so we're going to really think about it now when we when we think on something is it true is it honest as a pure is it lovely is it of a good report doesn't have any virtue or does it weaken your faith if there be any praise think on those things think on these things remember got to give God's own to work with we don't want to we don't want to frustrate the grace of God by actually working against his word his will those things which he have both learned and received and heard and seen in me do and the God of peace be with you but I rejoice in the Lord greatly that now at last your care of me heaven has flourished again wherein ye were also careful but ye lacked opportunity not that I speak in respect of for I have learned in whatsoever state I am therewith to be content he sees another place to content with godliness is great gain I mean so so whatever state you're in just be content I'm living on the street big content I have all things be content the one thing I wanted just just be content I just lost it all be content right as I said about the Apostle Paul he suffered many things it wasn't God dealing with him right God allowed him to go through those things sure but it God wasn't angry at the man amen so whatever state I'm in just be content why cuz I got a home over yonder I've got something that the world can buy Jeff what Benz or whatever his name is he has his fortune when I bought know how many tens of billions of dollars but he can't buy what I have right I know both had to be a based and I know how to abound everywhere in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry both to abound and to suffer need amen so the Apostle Paul learnt these things he was just content amen we know the thorn and the flesh that the other the other mischief from Satan buffeting him he sought the Lord that he'd be delivered of that right but he never complained at all and then and then once the Lord said my grace is sufficient for the he just rejoiced right but he never complained to God if he was hungry he never complained if he was cold he never complained he just walked on with God because remember our contentment should not be in our material positions how much everyone likes us how much everything's going well our contingent should be in our salvation and the God that we have believed in amen now so that's how we should be now as I said so those from expectation and the only way I know to do is prayer prayer is the key it's the answer prayer changes things prayer is the most powerful weapon that was ever put into the control of human beings there is no atomic bomb no hydrogen bomb as powerful as prayer prayer will change the mind of God I mean if you stand in the gap say Lord be merciful to these ones you can change God's mind about someone Amen but we should we should always pray first and foremost Lord change my thinking you know the devil will give you the world if he can heal heal anoint your imagination with what you could be but don't follow that say Lord what do you want what do you have for my life whatever that may be we all have a different path to walk with him right we all have to express something different you know maybe some of us will go like jog through great suffering right some will maybe have what appears to be an easier walk but the battle will be different right but God has a predestinate path for us to take but are we willing are we surrendered to to walk it with him that's the challenge maybe but this message is not a picnic it's a battlefield as rugged brother Brandon says guys looking for rugged Christians I mean not not not not a hotbed plant but a rugged hallelujah and I believe he makes us rugged Christians he puts something in us some grit I mean that whatever the devil fires at us we can just overcome and keep walking on I believe we can make us don't you holy but the key is Lord changed my thinking that it's your thinking amen as Christ won the victory in the garden by saying not my will but thy will be done that's how we all overcome as well you say but I've got rights I've got rights to be angry I got rights to hold resentment I've got rights to do what I want to do sure but a Christian forfeits its rights if we're sheep who's ever done shearing or docking anyone how old we're Swiss with a towel tapes okay I was AIDS as age and I helped pick up lambs to be docked there actually not this once you get a hold of them not that I wasn't strong but you know but you know once you get a hold of them they stop kicking let's just give up there they are hey they see their friends this got you know doctrine but they just kind of that and they just accept work because they've given up their rights you know we don't want to have some kind of nature as a goat kicking and fussing and but at all that's going on no no you say Lord he said well I feel that way say Lord changed my nature did I get the nature of a lamb because remember as the Lord in a nature of a dove son of God a nature of a lamb and they and those two natures blended together and that's the only two natures that will blend together and that's how we want to be well how do I do that you just got to give it all over Christianity is self-denial right if any man's gonna follow me take up has let him take up us cross deny himself and follow me I mean in an age where everyone wants their rights the believer is the only one that doesn't want their rights they want the Lord to have control I mean so I'm just gonna we'll pick it up some other time Oh who wants to work according to the laws of God I don't to be like the farmer on one side with the teaching well and the crop on farm the other hill saying water go over there it's not going to do any good we're going to work according to the laws of God isn't that right I don't want to read the Bible and then forget it instantly you forget what I've read about walk off and think about something else it doesn't help me right anyway so we have we have sister Maggie scene to prayer request a little earlier I think her name is Leah everyday she's alive as a miracle we're gonna keep praying for her she's born very premature add a zero on us ever have a prayer request father James I'm in MacOS I'm in diamond absolutely anyone else boffo night man absolutely my brother stabilized in heart and he'll be just the recovery and my grandfather deteriorated a bit while she was in hospital and it's looking like you're holding there to the transitory to a home and so she just asked here I'm in the right place Luna man and then she just wants to trust him and once time they transition to I met ya by Lampe show my old mates from back in my party days right takes me the other day and he he's also funnily enough as a producer music producer he gave me sort of going he was top of the top of them what have you called it back 10 15 years ago but he also wants to help that'll sound amusing but I think it's also the Lord opening up an opportunity okay man what just film about six years ago and he was quite receptive but still held by drugs and right and you know his own instant gratification measures that he had I don't know where is that now but he wants to help because of the Lord he wants to help Christians so it could be that the music that he makes us all masters for us will be a testimony to help them yeah hey man hey bring them both hey man what's his name - Jared hey Marcus and Jared give them on the sound disc Lord save their souls amen no I mean there's a reason like you're saying there's a reason I believe I mean salvation amen okay let some Jew just sing a song shall we if that if the musicians want to come we'll just sing a song we'll just go into prayer shall we and amen I mean maybe brother Andy might have to help me let's just sing that chorus Tama to bless the Lord O my soul there from 10,000 reasons shall we then we'll go on to pray just as you feel laid there all pray together [Music] my soul [Music] [Music] the Lord O my soul I'll worship your Holy Name they should sing along [Music] oh my our worship I mean it's all pray together in Lord Jesus Lord we want to worship your Holy Name Lord thou art great Lord you
