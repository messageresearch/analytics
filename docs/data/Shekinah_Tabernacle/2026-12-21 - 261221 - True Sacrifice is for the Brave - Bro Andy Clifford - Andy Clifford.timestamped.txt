[55:10] you know god's placed it in your heart
[55:11] or you know that that's the right thing
[55:13] to do and and you're feeling pulled
[55:15] towards something by the holy spirit
[55:19] and you're willing to let go
[55:21] of all of your pride all of your
[55:23] prejudice all of your built up ambitions
[55:27] anything you're just willing to go you
[55:29] know what you're willing to let go of
[55:31] your routines
[55:33] your comforts
[55:35] oh my
[55:37] help me jesus
[55:39] are you willing are you brave this
[55:42] morning

[55:44] who's got the bravery the bravado
[55:48] to allow god
[55:50] his way
[55:52] hallelujah you know actually if you look
[55:55] at the whole big picture that's actually
[55:56] the safest place to be anyway
[55:58] [Laughter]
[56:00] oh man we can make our own comforts you
[56:02] know human beings love to be comfortable
[56:04] we like to have a nice soft seat
[56:06] i like to have it all sounding real good
[56:09] god bless the tech team you know
[56:12] we love to just have it nice
[56:14] and we like the the instruments to play
[56:16] good the singers to sing in rhythm
[56:19] or sometimes
[56:22] so amen we like that and we like
[56:24] creature comforts and we like to have
[56:26] things easy and we like to have things
[56:28] structured what some people do you know
[56:30] and and and yet are you brave enough
[56:34] to sacrifice those
[56:36] are you brave enough this morning are
[56:38] you brave enough because
[56:40] we're we as i said in the prayer that i
[56:42] didn't plan anything but you know the
[56:45] the earth is in birth pains
[56:47] and the world is coming to a place where
[56:49] a man child shall be born
[56:51] you know
[56:52] and and really that's just a symbolic
[56:55] type of christ is coming to the earth
[56:58] and so for christ to come to the earth
[57:00] and change the whole situation
[57:02] it's causing labor pains the devil ain't
[57:05] happy about it so there's all sorts of
[57:07] destructions going on and everything
[57:09] and so if you've ever been brave and you
[57:12] want to you want to actually crest these
[57:14] waves and you want to go through it it's
[57:17] going to take more bravery than you've
[57:18] ever expressed in your life
[57:21] hallelujah because each one of you has a
[57:23] divine purpose a divine calling and it's
[57:26] not always what you think it is
[57:29] but it's going to take ultimate bravery
[57:32] to for you to let go
[57:34] of the weights and sins that does so
[57:36] easily beset
[57:37] when when when we read that in hebrews
[57:40] 12 and and it says that we should cast
[57:42] down all the weights and sins that does
[57:44] so easily beset us you know those things
[57:47] are besetting us from his purpose not
[57:49] our purpose we can have a purpose and
[57:51] our purpose and our plans and it could
[57:53] be mixed in are the weights
[57:57] they are the things that say god just
[57:59] say come on are you ready
[58:01] are you ready are you brave enough this
[58:03] morning
[58:04] are you brave enough to let go of those
[58:07] things
[58:08] hallelujah
[58:11] amen
[58:12] i wasn't really going to minister on
[58:13] this but i had a dream and the dream was
[58:16] i'll tell you the dream
[58:17] and it
[58:20] oh my it was actually
[58:23] i don't know this is just how the lord
[58:24] works i guess but um
[58:27] i i had ordered this like i don't know
[58:29] what happened i don't you know how
[58:31] sometimes it just kind of comes into
[58:33] picture and so i came into the picture
[58:35] and we had this big hall rented it was
[58:37] like a city hall and we were about to
[58:39] have a convention or a camp meeting or
[58:41] something and it was going to be real
[58:43] good and then all the open brethren and
[58:46] all the pentecostals people that i knew
[58:48] that have always fought against this
[58:50] message and fought against
[58:52] not actively but just we've always had
[58:55] our debates and had our discussions
[58:57] ministerial type of
[58:59] conflict because of the doctrinal
[59:02] differences and things and they all came
[59:04] in
[59:05] and all their churches and everyone just
[59:06] came in and i was thinking oh man what
[59:09] have i got here you know what's going on
[59:11] here
[59:12] and all of a sudden this boldness just
[59:14] came over me this bravery just came over
[59:16] me and i just started standing there and
[59:18] i felt like i was just standing and i
[59:20] was calling them out
[59:22] and it was like it wasn't my bravery it
[59:24] was his his bravery
[59:26] just came upon me and you know when if
[59:28] you've ever been in a situation where
[59:30] you're in especially as a child and
[59:32] you're with your buddies or you're with
[59:34] your friends and and then the bullies
[59:37] come
[59:38] the bigger ones come and they start to
[59:40] mess with you you mess with you and you
[59:41] guys are getting a bit scared and then
[59:43] your daddy walks around the corner
[59:45] and you you all of a sudden you get
[59:46] brave and you start shouting at those
[59:48] guys
[59:50] that's what it was like that's what it
[59:52] was like it was like just and and i
[59:54] actually started calling them i said i
[59:56] challenge you all
[59:58] right now
[59:59] to a clear discussion to a debate that
[1:00:02] you can refute anything that this
[1:00:03] message
[1:00:05] i challenge you right now
[1:00:07] and they were as quiet as can be and
[1:00:09] then i woke up
[1:00:12] and i thought okay and then i was going
[1:00:15] to um
[1:00:16] you know i was going to minister on a
[1:00:18] subject called
[1:00:20] human desire
[1:00:22] will veto the holy ghost
[1:00:26] you know because as soon as you desire
[1:00:28] something the lord ain't going to lead
[1:00:30] you where he wants you because he can't
[1:00:31] because you want that
[1:00:32] and he's got this you've got to actually
[1:00:34] let your desire go
[1:00:36] you may want to do these things we all
[1:00:38] want to do things right and and and hey
[1:00:42] it could be all right it probably is all
[1:00:43] right more than likely is going to be
[1:00:45] right because you're in the mind of
[1:00:46] christ but you have to
[1:00:48] sacrifice that
[1:00:50] so that god can lead you and i was going
[1:00:51] to speak on that
[1:00:53] and then
[1:00:55] i don't know i think i was talking to
[1:00:56] bronwyn and she's like oh wow
[1:00:59] i said i had this dream
[1:01:01] and
[1:01:03] and she said oh maybe you need to preach
[1:01:04] on
[1:01:05] something about the pentecost
[1:01:07] pentecostalism maybe coming into the
[1:01:09] church or something and i was like oh
[1:01:10] there's and then we were like oh there's
[1:01:12] no real we don't that's not really you
[1:01:14] know we don't really have pentecostalism
[1:01:16] coming into the church you know like so
[1:01:18] i was like oh no it can't be it so i
[1:01:19] just pond left it and then as i was
[1:01:21] praying you know i'm praying lord show
[1:01:24] me what to what
[1:01:25] how this is you know what do you want
[1:01:27] and then that came
[1:01:30] true sacrifice
[1:01:31] because you are sacrificing your desires
[1:01:34] as for the brave
[1:01:36] amen
[1:01:38] hebrews 9 26 for then must he often have
[1:01:42] suffered since the foundation of the
[1:01:44] world but now
[1:01:46] once in the end of the world has
[1:01:48] appeared
[1:01:49] to put away sin by the sacrifice of
[1:01:53] himself
[1:01:54] you know we as we sit here today we are
[1:01:57] beneficiaries of the ultimate sacrifice
[1:02:03] god
[1:02:04] man you know you think okay you've had
[1:02:06] the best time in your life and then
[1:02:07] times it by a million and that's where
[1:02:09] god is
[1:02:10] just in splendor
[1:02:12] heaven perfect no troubles
[1:02:15] and he
[1:02:16] he decided
[1:02:18] that he well he needed now and his of
[1:02:20] his decision he would come down to the
[1:02:22] earth
[1:02:23] he would manifest himself in a baby
[1:02:27] jehovah
[1:02:28] of the old testament
[1:02:30] would make himself and
[1:02:32] and and trans you know it says that he
[1:02:34] would metamorphous
[1:02:36] he would transform himself he would be
[1:02:38] found in an image of man
[1:02:41] and he would come through the womb of a
[1:02:43] woman a virgin
[1:02:45] and a and and and and so he would go
[1:02:48] through the struggles of humanity
[1:02:50] and he would go through the struggles of
[1:02:52] temptation the struggles of shame the
[1:02:53] struggles of all of the spirits and all
[1:02:56] the darkness can you just think about
[1:02:58] that for now that god would choose to
[1:03:01] leave the splendor of heaven
[1:03:03] knowing his destiny
[1:03:05] hallelujah
[1:03:07] knowing what he would face
[1:03:09] and he let it go
[1:03:12] that is the ultimate expression of
[1:03:14] bravery hallelujah and that bravery was
[1:03:18] ignited by love
[1:03:20] that bravery was was
[1:03:22] built was buckled by love
[1:03:26] without love that brave how can the
[1:03:27] break how can bravery have its way
[1:03:30] without love
[1:03:31] amen
[1:03:33] and how can faith have its way without
[1:03:35] love
[1:03:36] and we're going to finish today on love
[1:03:38] because i believe that love
[1:03:41] is
[1:03:42] the ultimate
[1:03:44] hub
[1:03:45] of all operation
[1:03:48] of kingdom of god
[1:03:49] everything
[1:03:51] of in god's kingdom whether it's
[1:03:53] personal collective dispensational
[1:03:56] eternal all
[1:03:58] is
[1:04:00] comes from love
[1:04:01] and is held by love
[1:04:03] god's love
[1:04:05] unconditional love you see if it's
[1:04:07] unconditional it cannot change if it's
[1:04:09] unconditional it's
[1:04:11] a constant reality that cannot be
[1:04:13] diminished it never began it will never
[1:04:15] end it just is that's love
[1:04:18] and that love was expressed in a baby
[1:04:20] that was born
[1:04:22] hallelujah
[1:04:23] hallelujah god would choose
[1:04:26] in a brave act hallelujah you know and
[1:04:29] trust in the salvation to trust in that
[1:04:33] this great god who was invisible and
[1:04:35] without space and time and so big and so
[1:04:38] incomprehensible
[1:04:39] who knows what incomprehensible means
[1:04:42] you can't understand them it's too big
[1:04:45] he would become a baby
[1:04:46] a baby
[1:04:48] that's powerful that
[1:04:50] he would become a baby and he was just
[1:04:52] dependent on a woman and dependent on a
[1:04:55] surrogate father
[1:04:57] is that what you call it a stepfather
[1:04:59] you could say he was dependent on these
[1:05:01] humans
[1:05:03] to to raise him up oh my
[1:05:05] and to trust his angelic host that never
[1:05:10] fell for the devil's lives
[1:05:12] he he trusted gabriel he trusted these
[1:05:15] angels to actually watch over him
[1:05:18] because here he is in a baby form oh my
[1:05:21] hallelujah he trusted that he could go
[1:05:24] through this and he would be helped and
[1:05:25] he would be delivered and he would be
[1:05:27] raised up and he would brave all of this
[1:05:30] this is the ultimate sacrifice
[1:05:33] hallelujah
[1:05:36] 1 1 it says i beseech you i beg you
[1:05:38] therefore brethren now it's personal
[1:05:40] okay now we're going personal here i
[1:05:42] beseech you therefore brethren by the
[1:05:44] mercies of god that you
[1:05:46] you
[1:05:47] me and you us
[1:05:49] we present
[1:05:51] that you present your bodies
[1:05:53] now physical
[1:05:55] as well as spiritual
[1:05:57] a living sacrifice
[1:05:59] so you see now we're called
[1:06:02] we're called to a sacrifice
[1:06:04] but not a sacrifice where we go and kill
[1:06:07] ourself but a sacrifice where we kill
[1:06:09] our old self
[1:06:11] on the altar of god so that he can live
[1:06:15] so that his will can be done not my will
[1:06:18] not your will but his will
[1:06:21] and that sacrifice has been that that
[1:06:23] altar has been restored
[1:06:25] who believes that
[1:06:27] under the spirit and power of elijah in
[1:06:29] the last days of restoration that that
[1:06:32] the altar of approach to god would be
[1:06:34] fully restored would be built up again
[1:06:37] by vision by prophetic vision
[1:06:40] that the altar where a man or a woman
[1:06:43] can actually come fully to god no
[1:06:46] denominational additions or subtractions
[1:06:49] no you know when you end up with a man
[1:06:51] leadership when you end up with a
[1:06:53] council of men running a huge
[1:06:55] international
[1:06:56] organization you end up adding and
[1:06:59] taking because of the fashions because
[1:07:01] of what's popular because of what's
[1:07:02] unpopular
[1:07:04] man has to go oh we shouldn't maybe we
[1:07:06] don't put that in anymore but god
[1:07:08] doesn't want that god says let every
[1:07:10] stone that moses put together
[1:07:12] let every stone be untouched
[1:07:15] don't don't try and change it
[1:07:17] the 12 stones he said don't shake the
[1:07:20] stone you know this is what man wants to
[1:07:22] do and we've got to be very very you
[1:07:24] know we can say oh look out there but
[1:07:25] what about in here
[1:07:27] what about in your life
[1:07:28] are you shaping the stones
[1:07:30] you know
[1:07:31] because we can say oh i like all this
[1:07:34] but then there's a little desire in me
[1:07:36] that wants to do this you're shaping the
[1:07:38] stone
[1:07:40] because that's those stone you know
[1:07:41] those stones is our approach to god you
[1:07:43] know in the old testament they
[1:07:44] approached god and worshipped through
[1:07:46] the sacrifice of an innocent lamb or the
[1:07:48] sacrifice of an innocent cow
[1:07:50] and then then god's wrath or his that
[1:07:54] was fellowship was under the shed blood
[1:07:56] and it says without the shedding of
[1:07:57] blood was no remission of sin and so
[1:07:59] they approached god through an animal
[1:08:01] life but the animal life couldn't change
[1:08:03] them but see the altar this is where i'm
[1:08:06] getting to the altar was unjudged
[1:08:09] it was only
[1:08:10] the men put the stones there
[1:08:13] but the stone had to be exactly how god
[1:08:14] made the stone
[1:08:16] and the stones was all there and then
[1:08:18] they could sacrifice the animal and it's
[1:08:20] the same now
[1:08:22] are you changing the stone
[1:08:24] or are you leaving it
[1:08:26] are you letting god just leave it
[1:08:28] oh my so you can fall on the altar as a
[1:08:31] living sacrifice you know i'm really i'm
[1:08:34] calling this
[1:08:35] from the story of elijah on mount carmel
[1:08:37] if anyone is not aware mount carmel is
[1:08:40] where elijah challenged the prophets of
[1:08:42] baal in a time of uncertainty of israel
[1:08:44] in a time where great judgment was all
[1:08:46] over the earth a time where jezebel this
[1:08:49] woman power was controlling israel
[1:08:52] just like today we have a jezebel
[1:08:54] religion a world power dominating
[1:08:59] the trying to dominate the church trying
[1:09:02] to dominate the world
[1:09:04] a jezebel religion a world roman power
[1:09:08] trying to dominate and and here the
[1:09:11] spirit of elijah raises up and says to
[1:09:13] ahab and
[1:09:14] bring everybody to mount carmel we're
[1:09:17] gonna have a showdown
[1:09:19] amen we're gonna have a showdown and and
[1:09:21] elijah by vision saw that he had to do
[1:09:24] this and this and this and the prophets
[1:09:25] of baal could not call fire but here we
[1:09:28] have elijah and when the animal was on
[1:09:30] there he says god at your word i've done
[1:09:33] this
[1:09:34] amen there's the difference
[1:09:36] it's your word
[1:09:37] elijah was brave hallelujah elijah was
[1:09:40] willing to sacrifice his own ideas his
[1:09:43] own will his own dreams his own
[1:09:45] aspirations his own routines hallelujah
[1:09:48] amen
[1:09:49] his own routine hallelujah now if you're
[1:09:52] a routine driven person please don't
[1:09:54] feel like i'm attacking you
[1:09:56] hallelujah don't you know but you've got
[1:09:58] to be willing to sacrifice that
[1:10:00] you can have routines there's nothing
[1:10:02] wrong with order all right there's
[1:10:03] nothing wrong with it we like order we
[1:10:05] like to you know we like to do things
[1:10:08] right and do it properly and that
[1:10:09] sometimes requires habitual routineism
[1:10:12] but
[1:10:13] are you willing to let that go elijah
[1:10:15] was willing to let that go
[1:10:17] he probably wanted to do it a different
[1:10:18] way but god showed him this way and that
[1:10:21] in our day we've had a great spirit of a
[1:10:23] man anointed with the spirit of elijah
[1:10:24] to come and restore the altar so a
[1:10:27] people here we are hello
[1:10:29] right here you can fall on that altar
[1:10:31] this morning you can fall on an
[1:10:33] untouched approach to god
[1:10:36] hallelujah not crafted not rounded off
[1:10:39] so it looks real good not covered in
[1:10:41] gold like some of these big glorious
[1:10:43] altars and some of these prestigious
[1:10:45] cathedrals no
[1:10:47] just pure
[1:10:49] just pure
[1:10:51] hallelujah aren't you so glad that you
[1:10:53] can approach a pure altar this morning
[1:10:56] an approach to god
[1:10:58] hallelujah
[1:11:00] and when i talk about this that altar is
[1:11:03] repentance
[1:11:04] and baptism in the name of jesus christ
[1:11:06] that's it for the remission of sin
[1:11:09] that's the
[1:11:10] altar that repentance
[1:11:13] from your evil ways and everything in
[1:11:15] your will and all of that
[1:11:17] and to fall on
[1:11:19] the altar of the baptism in the name of
[1:11:21] jesus christ for the remission of your
[1:11:23] sins and you shall receive the gift of
[1:11:26] the holy ghost
[1:11:27] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:11:30] holy ghost and this promise peter says
[1:11:32] this is now the inauguration of the
[1:11:33] church and this is how it was all done
[1:11:35] in the book of acts and the early church
[1:11:37] until it was changed in 300 or so a.d by
[1:11:41] the roman catholic church they changed
[1:11:43] it all but and now all the churches seem
[1:11:45] to have commanded that and the pope even
[1:11:47] said that this is how they connect back
[1:11:49] to us
[1:11:50] all these
[1:11:51] churches and baptists and presbyterians
[1:11:53] and methodists and everything the pope
[1:11:55] stood up about five years ago and he
[1:11:57] said the way that they're connected back
[1:11:59] to us and and in his eyes the way that
[1:12:01] they are saved is because of the same
[1:12:03] baptism he said it's the umbilical cord
[1:12:05] that ties them back to mother rome
[1:12:08] you know that
[1:12:09] [Laughter]
[1:12:12] you can see now
[1:12:14] that's exactly why it's so important to
[1:12:18] take the true baptism
[1:12:19] that's the umbilical cord to father god
[1:12:22] hallelujah
[1:12:23] that's the altar untouched no shining of
[1:12:26] the stone just pure
[1:12:28] you know peter he says now the
[1:12:30] inauguration of the church he says this
[1:12:32] promise
[1:12:33] is unto you to the people of jerusalem
[1:12:35] in that day
[1:12:36] and to your children amen and to all
[1:12:39] those afar off even as many as the lord
[1:12:42] our god shall call
[1:12:44] amen
[1:12:46] hallelujah there you go
[1:12:49] that's uh that's christianity 101
[1:12:52] hello but it's a good foundation for the
[1:12:54] for
[1:12:55] take sacrifice
[1:12:56] because you see when you take this route
[1:12:59] when you take the way of the lord's
[1:13:00] despised
[1:13:02] few you are sacrificing popularity
[1:13:06] you are sacrificing friends
[1:13:09] you are sacrificing your prestigious
[1:13:11] stand with with groups and
[1:13:13] many many many
[1:13:15] many people over the years have walked
[1:13:18] away
[1:13:21] or they just don't want to be around you
[1:13:24] there's all these things that happen but
[1:13:25] are you brave enough to follow the call
[1:13:28] of god are you brave enough to follow
[1:13:30] his call
[1:13:31] amen
[1:13:34] hallelujah
[1:13:35] so it says here um that you may present
[1:13:38] your bodies a living sacrifice wholly
[1:13:40] acceptable unto god which is your
[1:13:42] reasonable service
[1:13:43] amen and be not conformed to this world
[1:13:46] but be transformed by the renewing of
[1:13:48] your mind that you may prove what is
[1:13:50] that good and acceptable and perfect
[1:13:52] will of god
[1:13:55] amen
[1:13:57] you know there's different
[1:13:59] modes of
[1:14:00] sacrifice
[1:14:02] when you you know right now
[1:14:05] it's we're not really conscripted to any
[1:14:08] battles
[1:14:10] maybe if you're living in the middle
[1:14:12] east you would be
[1:14:13] because there's a lot of war always
[1:14:14] going on in the middle east right so you
[1:14:17] would get conscripted
[1:14:18] you would be forced to sacrifice
[1:14:22] you're forced to a life of sacrifice do
[1:14:25] you think the damaskians the syrians and
[1:14:28] damascus
[1:14:29] do you think that they are living a
[1:14:31] comfortable life right now easy
[1:14:33] no
[1:14:34] no they're forced to a sacrifice so
[1:14:37] there is a sacrifice of war
[1:14:41] it's a physical war in the flesh
[1:14:43] you see wars begin in the spirit and
[1:14:45] then they come forth into the flesh
[1:14:47] and depending on the foundation of that
[1:14:50] society and the nature of their ethic
[1:14:52] whether it's judeo-christian jewish or
[1:14:55] whether it's buddhist islamic or hindu
[1:14:58] or whatever it may be
[1:15:00] that that will determine whether that
[1:15:01] war comes flesh or not
[1:15:04] you know
[1:15:05] because that there's reasoning and
[1:15:07] there's ability to go you know what
[1:15:09] that's actually ridiculous
[1:15:10] and if you're based on a say if you're
[1:15:12] based on a democratic judeo-christian
[1:15:16] foundation
[1:15:17] the idea of going and creating a big war
[1:15:19] in the flesh is just like the absolute
[1:15:22] last resort and you will do everything
[1:15:24] to avoid it right
[1:15:26] but then you get other foundations that
[1:15:28] will just run to it because they're
[1:15:30] called in their religion to fight
[1:15:33] you know there's just different ideas in
[1:15:34] different ways so the sacrifice that is
[1:15:38] made
[1:15:39] when the war is in the flesh now follow
[1:15:41] me the sacrifice that is made when the
[1:15:43] war comes to the flesh is physical and
[1:15:45] you have to sacrifice a lot of things
[1:15:47] you'll end up sacrificing most likely
[1:15:49] your job your business will become a gun
[1:15:52] place that makes guns or some like night
[1:15:55] vision stuff that's technical you know
[1:15:57] building all these like little testing
[1:15:59] things and stuff or whatever business
[1:16:01] you may be you sacrifice that
[1:16:03] by by force
[1:16:05] it just happens and it's all written
[1:16:06] down in the business laws and everything
[1:16:08] that if there's a war you are going to
[1:16:10] give that business up and your cars the
[1:16:12] soldiers can take everything
[1:16:14] to use for the betterment and for the
[1:16:16] you know the for the country
[1:16:18] and so there's a sacrifice that is made
[1:16:20] physically and spiritually because you
[1:16:22] will end up maybe losing loved ones and
[1:16:25] all these things because there's a war
[1:16:27] going on
[1:16:28] and you see that war because it's out in
[1:16:30] the flesh
[1:16:31] but god has called you to a discernment
[1:16:33] today
[1:16:34] there is a greater war happening that's
[1:16:36] even more ferocious than world war ii
[1:16:39] and it's already well and we know world
[1:16:41] war three is coming but world war iii
[1:16:43] has begun
[1:16:44] let me declare to you world war three is
[1:16:47] here it's in the spirit
[1:16:49] world war three is happening in the
[1:16:50] minds of all these people world war iii
[1:16:53] is happening inside you right now
[1:16:55] you know that
[1:16:57] because the end of world war three is
[1:16:58] armageddon right who knows that
[1:17:01] armageddon
[1:17:02] finishes world war three because christ
[1:17:04] comes to earth and says that's enough
[1:17:07] i'm taking over you guys have stuffed it
[1:17:09] up satan you stuffed it up get out
[1:17:12] you know that i'm just paraphrasing now
[1:17:13] that's not biblical language you stuffed
[1:17:16] it up satan
[1:17:17] go
[1:17:18] you've had six thousand years to prove
[1:17:20] that the civilization will work you
[1:17:22] failed
[1:17:23] he failed who believes he failed
[1:17:25] you know i don't think he didn't think
[1:17:27] he wanted to fail he's trying to prove
[1:17:29] that this monetary system and this
[1:17:30] economy would work but it didn't
[1:17:32] because man is evil because of the fall
[1:17:35] because of corruption
[1:17:38] so
[1:17:39] this whole thing shall be taken over
[1:17:42] and all of the corruption shall be
[1:17:44] finished amen
[1:17:46] i let i'm just going to stop there for a
[1:17:48] minute
[1:17:49] because i'm getting ahead of myself we
[1:17:50] will revisit this very soon
[1:17:53] hallelujah just just remember the
[1:17:56] sacrifice of war when it comes into the
[1:17:58] flesh
[1:18:00] then you really realize it but you need
[1:18:03] to discern right now that that same war
[1:18:05] is happening in the spirit
[1:18:07] because what will end world war three in
[1:18:09] the flesh is actually
[1:18:11] ending the devil in you
[1:18:13] spiritually speaking right now because
[1:18:15] you see human beings have been trapped
[1:18:17] into flesh and for and i'm talking about
[1:18:20] true believers right from the time when
[1:18:22] the holy ghost was poured out on the
[1:18:23] church they have always battled the
[1:18:25] flesh
[1:18:27] they've always battled the devil and
[1:18:29] their old nature ganging it up on them
[1:18:31] you know the devil knows your little
[1:18:33] complexes and things that's in your
[1:18:35] family and he knows how to scratch
[1:18:38] and he knows how to push the right
[1:18:39] button to get you to do a failure to get
[1:18:41] you to fail to get you to say the wrong
[1:18:43] thing to get you you know he works
[1:18:44] against you and you your old nature just
[1:18:46] happens to team up with the devil
[1:18:48] sometimes and get you in trouble and
[1:18:50] make you down and make you think like
[1:18:51] you don't even have the holy ghost to
[1:18:52] make you think this and that and
[1:18:54] everything else but just remember
[1:18:56] just remember world war iii
[1:18:58] is happening right now but are you
[1:19:00] willing if the people are willing out
[1:19:02] there to sacrifice
[1:19:04] if there's a big war on and they get
[1:19:06] they get patriotic and all of these boys
[1:19:09] and young men they want to go and fight
[1:19:11] for their country and they get their
[1:19:12] guns and they go
[1:19:14] and they're happy as and then they go
[1:19:16] and they get shot up
[1:19:18] and that's the end of them
[1:19:19] and they're willing
[1:19:21] who's willing who's brave enough this
[1:19:23] morning
[1:19:24] who's brave enough
[1:19:25] hallelujah to let go of your comfort to
[1:19:29] now i don't say you don't have to be
[1:19:30] comfortable man but just hear me out to
[1:19:33] let go of your routine to let go of your
[1:19:35] systems to let go of your your habits to
[1:19:38] let go
[1:19:39] of those things that make you good make
[1:19:41] you happy to let you know we want to be
[1:19:43] comforted we want to have comfort in our
[1:19:45] life and and we what we do and i've
[1:19:48] called these in here
[1:19:49] self-made
[1:19:51] comforts
[1:19:53] i think i call it that let me just go
[1:19:54] down here i made a list
[1:19:57] it's called self-secured comforts
[1:20:00] now human being wants to be comfortable
[1:20:02] we want to have cool things technologies
[1:20:05] we want to have our little thing and i
[1:20:06] like watching people build tables
[1:20:09] i love watching them build tables you
[1:20:11] know like woodwork and stuff and
[1:20:12] woodturning it's a little relaxation but
[1:20:15] i'm willing to i'm willing to let that
[1:20:16] go not that i'm going to if god says let
[1:20:19] it go i'll let it go
[1:20:21] and i'm willing to do that and he can
[1:20:23] then tell me to do it if i'm willing
[1:20:25] hallelujah but if you you you know you
[1:20:27] we get so caught up in something so
[1:20:30] caught up in a comfort that we get from
[1:20:31] you know an external source you know
[1:20:33] when you send an email and you're in an
[1:20:35] organization and it warns you that
[1:20:38] you're emailing out of your organization
[1:20:39] and it says you know be careful of this
[1:20:41] this this and this and this and it puts
[1:20:42] a higher level of security on your email
[1:20:44] that's the same thing now you
[1:20:47] when you are getting your comfort from
[1:20:49] god that you're in it's an internal
[1:20:51] affair
[1:20:52] amen there's no spam or anything that
[1:20:55] can get in no no malware hallelujah
[1:20:58] amen am i speaking today's language
[1:21:02] there's no malware
[1:21:04] it's all good but the moment you begin
[1:21:07] and i'm not saying you can't because we
[1:21:08] can it says that we should be in this
[1:21:10] world but not of this world but the
[1:21:11] moment you begin to derive your comforts
[1:21:14] from external sources all the warning
[1:21:16] stuff starts coming up
[1:21:18] be aware of spam be aware of your
[1:21:20] affections being taken out and being
[1:21:22] pawned off like rehabs
[1:21:24] you know
[1:21:26] i'm using that as a term so it doesn't
[1:21:27] sound too bad but
[1:21:29] you you pawn yourself off
[1:21:31] p-a-w in you pawn yourself off to the
[1:21:35] pawn shop
[1:21:36] all your affections oh i get my i love
[1:21:38] this i like this novel
[1:21:40] i like this romance i like this tv
[1:21:42] series and what you're doing is you're
[1:21:44] falling in love with these imaginary
[1:21:46] people
[1:21:48] you know that you're actually divvying
[1:21:49] out your heart
[1:21:51] to imaginary people
[1:21:53] when here is your family these are the
[1:21:56] people that god's called us to love he's
[1:21:58] called us to love his people he's called
[1:22:00] us to love him
[1:22:01] he's called us to love his word he's
[1:22:02] caught these are real people with real
[1:22:05] lives that are more interesting
[1:22:07] than a fantasy
[1:22:09] this is just one aspect you know
[1:22:11] one aspect
[1:22:13] but we've got to be careful because yeah
[1:22:15] especially you know and i only really
[1:22:17] caught this
[1:22:18] earlier on this year when the chosen
[1:22:21] came out
[1:22:23] and i thought man this is a powerful
[1:22:24] series because you actually become
[1:22:26] acquainted in your heart with the people
[1:22:29] and with jesus on there
[1:22:31] you're giving your heart out
[1:22:34] in a portion because now you know them
[1:22:37] and now i thought wow when when you get
[1:22:40] to know a person in a series and it's
[1:22:42] because a movie is different a movie is
[1:22:44] just this big
[1:22:45] and you're impacted and it's then it's
[1:22:47] finished but when you
[1:22:49] when you watch a series
[1:22:51] you're building a relationship with all
[1:22:53] the characters all the people you've got
[1:22:55] ones that you don't like and once oh man
[1:22:57] when i was young my mom usually used to
[1:22:58] get passionate oh this one and oh that
[1:23:01] one and all mine i just think man she's
[1:23:03] really into this
[1:23:05] you know
[1:23:06] and it's the same thing with the series
[1:23:08] you become a que you become in a
[1:23:09] relationship now
[1:23:10] with these people and i thought man when
[1:23:12] they crucified jesus in the chosen
[1:23:15] it's going to be way more impacting than
[1:23:17] any movie ever made because
[1:23:19] of the relationship that people are
[1:23:20] forming with them
[1:23:22] through that character
[1:23:24] and you just pray
[1:23:25] lord am i is this the right thing to do
[1:23:28] i like watching them i'm not saying
[1:23:29] don't watch them okay so this is
[1:23:31] something you need to be led of the holy
[1:23:32] ghost
[1:23:33] because if you're someone that can let
[1:23:34] your heart go like that
[1:23:36] you be careful
[1:23:37] now i give that illustration to show you
[1:23:40] that how our heart as a human being can
[1:23:42] be given away to something that's not
[1:23:43] even real
[1:23:44] you know these music pop stars and all
[1:23:46] that stuff and their their narrative
[1:23:49] and the think their image that they
[1:23:50] portray and you begin to infatuate with
[1:23:53] it and you begin to love that and you're
[1:23:54] like man your heart goes out to it
[1:23:58] it's an external email watch out spam
[1:24:01] malware
[1:24:02] um whatever else where
[1:24:04] all those things begin to become a
[1:24:06] reality there warning external
[1:24:09] so it's and so tread carefully
[1:24:12] because you see the enemy
[1:24:14] as a roaring lions worketh about seeking
[1:24:17] whom he may devour to try and devour you
[1:24:20] what he's not going to try and destroy
[1:24:22] you and put your boils all over you
[1:24:24] unless you really get down
[1:24:26] and do something i don't know but what
[1:24:28] he's trying to do is take your
[1:24:30] affections
[1:24:31] he's trying to take your ability to love
[1:24:33] god
[1:24:34] properly
[1:24:35] to ma your relationship with god
[1:24:38] that's what he's trying to do and it's
[1:24:39] very
[1:24:40] now i shouldn't say it's very easy
[1:24:41] because nothing can separate us from the
[1:24:43] love of god
[1:24:44] that's in your soul
[1:24:47] that's in your heart
[1:24:48] that's the very inner man the bible
[1:24:50] calls it with terminology is terminology
[1:24:52] but what the bible calls the inner man
[1:24:54] the one that's the real part of you
[1:24:57] that is inseparable to god but that's
[1:25:00] your it's the other parts of you your
[1:25:02] emotional realm your mental realm your
[1:25:04] physical realm
[1:25:06] these realms of you that are can be
[1:25:08] pulled away and your affections and your
[1:25:11] what you love and like you see when you
[1:25:12] begin to enjoy something
[1:25:14] you begin to receive it deeper into you
[1:25:17] you know when you just love something
[1:25:19] and you're just like i love this i love
[1:25:21] hearing this
[1:25:22] and it it it actually impacts you deeper
[1:25:25] than surface level
[1:25:27] so you you you allow things in deeper
[1:25:30] when you begin to enjoy it that's why
[1:25:32] we're protected when we go to the
[1:25:33] supermarket and ac dc is playing or
[1:25:36] eminem is playing or whatever they play
[1:25:38] in some shop but you've got to be there
[1:25:40] you haven't decided to put that on and
[1:25:43] you you you walk through it the demons
[1:25:45] that are on that don't come at you right
[1:25:47] they they don't they don't they're not
[1:25:49] just got a free course within you to
[1:25:51] attack you and to come inside you but if
[1:25:54] you put that on or let's say you because
[1:25:56] you you don't enjoy that thing you're
[1:25:58] not enjoying the spirits that are being
[1:25:59] expressed there so you're just protected
[1:26:02] but the moment you begin to enjoy that
[1:26:04] and you're like man i really like that
[1:26:05] you know you start dancing
[1:26:07] getting into it
[1:26:08] [Laughter]
[1:26:09] and you're just like man i really like
[1:26:10] what this guy's saying you're opening up
[1:26:12] to the spirit
[1:26:14] and this is how tv series is and and all
[1:26:17] these like fantasy novels and romance
[1:26:20] novels and all those things they they
[1:26:22] win your soul
[1:26:24] they win your spirit they win your
[1:26:25] emotions
[1:26:27] and they begin to take away your
[1:26:29] relationship with god
[1:26:30] because they they you you only have so
[1:26:32] much
[1:26:34] bandwidth i'm just speaking out today's
[1:26:37] terms i'm sure everyone knows what i
[1:26:39] mean maybe uh sister maggie might
[1:26:41] struggle with bandwidth but
[1:26:47] omar do you struggle with bandwidth
[1:26:51] okay so what that means is there's only
[1:26:53] so much that can happen at one time in a
[1:26:55] human being
[1:26:56] there's only so much affections that you
[1:26:58] can have there's only so much that you
[1:27:00] can you can you can think about at the
[1:27:02] same time right and so that's your
[1:27:04] bandwidth that's the width of your
[1:27:07] ability to
[1:27:10] do interact and be conscious
[1:27:12] in whatever realm it may be whether it's
[1:27:14] yeah so
[1:27:16] man i'm sounding like a scientist i need
[1:27:18] a helicopter on my head a helicopter hat
[1:27:20] you know
[1:27:22] mate
[1:27:23] we're right in the tech team's
[1:27:24] department now
[1:27:28] matt's laughing behind that screen
[1:27:32] oh mate okay so
[1:27:35] and when we divvy that out when we begin
[1:27:37] to give that out you make that decision
[1:27:39] we decide i'm going to give this out
[1:27:41] and you begin to lose the bound worth
[1:27:44] for the things of god
[1:27:46] and i'm saying that there will result in
[1:27:50] a lack of bravery
[1:27:52] that's going to result in an
[1:27:54] a glitch a bottleneck or a blockage
[1:27:59] for you to give yourself to god and
[1:28:01] allow god to take you into the unknown
[1:28:03] to take you beyond anything you've ever
[1:28:05] dreamed to take you beyond anything you
[1:28:07] could imagine greater than you can
[1:28:08] imagine
[1:28:09] his purpose for you is greater than you
[1:28:11] can dream
[1:28:12] because you see he built you for that he
[1:28:14] saw you before the world began and he
[1:28:16] said i'm making this person for this
[1:28:18] and he builds your dna to and all your
[1:28:21] gifts he placed in you and all the
[1:28:23] things that he gives you the talents
[1:28:24] that he places within you is exactly for
[1:28:27] that
[1:28:28] and then you become connected to it and
[1:28:31] then it becomes exactly what you are
[1:28:33] made for and you think you know when we
[1:28:34] go about our way and we go to study and
[1:28:37] we go down that route and we find it's
[1:28:39] just not really the fit but it's a job
[1:28:41] i'm going to go do it anyway because i
[1:28:42] need to make money that's just a trap
[1:28:45] you don't need to do that
[1:28:47] are you are you brave enough to say no
[1:28:51] are you brave enough to say no you know
[1:28:53] what i put that on the altar this
[1:28:55] morning

[1:33:26] from an evil conscience
[1:33:28] and our bodies washed with pure water
[1:33:32] so here is where
[1:33:34] we're talking about conscience now
[1:33:37] conscience in the king james is desire

[1:34:02] physical land he said just a little bit
[1:34:05] i'll give you one day at a time and
[1:34:06] you'll get the capacity to handle it and
[1:34:09] it's the same with your inheritance in
[1:34:11] christ just little by little
[1:34:13] but today may another one happen
[1:34:16] you know i'll just read it now because i
[1:34:18] want you i just read these things so
[1:34:19] you'd have good confidence
[1:34:21] in the blood
[1:34:23] and good confidence that there is a
[1:34:24] restored altar where fire comes
[1:34:27] hallelujah
[1:34:28] fire comes
[1:34:30] why and water
[1:34:32] water to sprinkle your conscience to
[1:34:34] cleanse your desires who wants cleanse
[1:34:37] desires
[1:34:38] to cleanse you from the desire to do
[1:34:40] those things that are taking away your
[1:34:41] affections
[1:34:45] taking away your marring your love your
[1:34:48] relationship with god
[1:34:50] oh my do you think the devil ain't going
[1:34:51] to leave us he's going to leave us alone
[1:34:52] he ain't going to leave us alone he
[1:34:54] knows the things that you like and he's
[1:34:55] going to pull you he's going to begin to
[1:34:57] try and tempt you that way pull you that
[1:34:59] way to take away your worship
[1:35:03] but i just want to speak a mandate over
[1:35:05] you
[1:35:06] hurt not the oil of mine satan
[1:35:09] hurt not the worship and the revelation
[1:35:11] let these people be stimulated by the
[1:35:13] revelation of god hallelujah
[1:35:16] that's under the third seal
[1:35:18] it's said to hurt not the oil and the
[1:35:20] wine
[1:35:21] you know what that means that means that
[1:35:23] you have liberty to worship you've got
[1:35:26] liberty to have revelation
[1:35:28] liberty to have faith
[1:35:30] if god didn't say that we would be in a
[1:35:31] very sticky situation
[1:35:33] because the devil would be able to hurt
[1:35:35] our worship
[1:35:36] but he can't
[1:35:37] but what he tries to do is tries to
[1:35:40] divvy out your affections too far
[1:35:42] until you're busy and all your your
[1:35:45] creativity
[1:35:46] all your affections just goes all over
[1:35:48] the place
[1:35:50] oh my
[1:35:51] to the point now now let me say
[1:35:53] something here
[1:35:54] when you divvy it out too far you become
[1:35:56] hot between two opinions and you become
[1:35:58] hot between 20 opinions even
[1:36:01] and you just become hot between and you
[1:36:03] become lost in an ether of unsurety
[1:36:06] and you and all of a sudden all your
[1:36:08] affections have been divvied out so much
[1:36:10] that you've got one percent here seven
[1:36:12] percent there nine percent there six
[1:36:14] percent there one percent it's all every
[1:36:16] doubt all of a sudden you've got no real
[1:36:19] like center of worship
[1:36:21] you've just divvied yourself out like
[1:36:23] harlot like rahab
[1:36:25] spiritually speaking just divvied it all
[1:36:27] out
[1:36:28] this is where we've got to be very very
[1:36:29] vigilant
[1:36:30] and very discerning the bible says judge
[1:36:33] righteous judgment
[1:36:34] judge the spirit behind the man not the
[1:36:37] man the spirit behind those people the
[1:36:39] spirit behind that show the spirit
[1:36:41] behind that book the spirit behind it
[1:36:43] may even be a good thing you might be
[1:36:45] reading an atlas
[1:36:46] but you might get that
[1:36:49] oh my maybe you you might need a
[1:36:51] helicopter hat and it was a dictionary
[1:36:55] maybe who's read a dictionary before you
[1:36:57] know i want to just learn some words
[1:36:58] today
[1:37:00] i've done that i did that when i was
[1:37:01] about 12 you know i was like man i just
[1:37:03] want to learn a new word
[1:37:07] so you know you just dipping those
[1:37:08] things out what happens
[1:37:10] all of a sudden your human emotion just
[1:37:12] becomes
[1:37:13] flat
[1:37:15] and there's a form of depression
[1:37:17] because why you got nothing to enjoy
[1:37:19] you've got to reel it all back in
[1:37:21] hallelujah
[1:37:22] there's the sacrifice there's the altar
[1:37:25] you're the sacrifice but not a dead one
[1:37:27] a living one
[1:37:29] hallelujah
[1:37:31] lori
[1:37:35] these are the things now i'm just going
[1:37:36] to read it out now these are
[1:37:38] this this is if something's coming and
[1:37:40] knocking at your door
[1:37:42] the altar is there
[1:37:44] amen
[1:37:46] the altar is there and it and it's been
[1:37:48] restored i'm not saying this is the
[1:37:50] physical altar i'm talking about the
[1:37:52] restored altar of approach to god the
[1:37:54] access to the full power of his blood
[1:37:57] hallelujah the access to the full power
[1:38:00] of his healing the full power of
[1:38:01] deliverance the full power to change you
[1:38:04] just what did it say there to sprinkle
[1:38:07] your evil conscience your evil desires
[1:38:10] and your bodies now so that's spiritual
[1:38:13] and then the physical is that our bodies
[1:38:15] will be washed with pure water
[1:38:18] let me say something here we'll get to
[1:38:19] the list i promise we've actually dealt
[1:38:21] on the list quite a bit already anyway
[1:38:23] but um
[1:38:25] you know
[1:38:27] you because we are a triune being just
[1:38:29] like god is a triune being
[1:38:32] and
[1:38:32] we are a soul a spirit and a body
[1:38:36] and or an inner man a you know i don't
[1:38:38] know innermost man in a man in a out of
[1:38:41] bed out of court or you know the three
[1:38:43] of the tabernacle the holiest of holies
[1:38:45] the holy place and the outer court so
[1:38:47] there's three parts of us
[1:38:49] one part is redeemed saved and is sealed
[1:38:53] in by the holy ghost but these two other
[1:38:55] courts are actually
[1:38:57] subject to the fall
[1:38:59] and those are the those two places there
[1:39:02] work together
[1:39:04] so when you go into a situation and it
[1:39:06] makes you happy
[1:39:09] then there is a subconscious inside you
[1:39:11] a spirit the spirit of your mind that
[1:39:13] says in the bible that's in there
[1:39:15] creating chemicals to make you feel like
[1:39:17] your body to register that you're angry
[1:39:18] or you're happy or whatever
[1:39:20] it's registering that emotion it's
[1:39:23] registering it's reacting to your
[1:39:25] environment
[1:39:26] so they work hand in hand
[1:39:29] so when you are having an emotional time
[1:39:32] and you're going through something
[1:39:34] that emotion
[1:39:35] that experience that's coming in at you
[1:39:37] and it's stimulating your senses comes
[1:39:39] into your mind your mind begins to cause
[1:39:41] hormones to go and all sorts of things
[1:39:44] you know maybe you see the one you're
[1:39:46] going to marry
[1:39:47] and all of a sudden
[1:39:49] what is that love hormone called
[1:39:51] there's a hormone that makes you feel
[1:39:54] happy
[1:39:55] i don't know what's called oxytocin is
[1:39:57] that right oxytocin so there's actually
[1:40:00] hormones that
[1:40:01] give a physical registration to a
[1:40:04] spiritual environment to a spiritual
[1:40:06] encounter so those two things work
[1:40:08] together
[1:40:10] now they work together the reason they
[1:40:11] work together is they're very entwined
[1:40:13] but let me tell you this that the
[1:40:15] atonement by his stripes we are healed
[1:40:19] amen
[1:40:20] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[1:40:22] him so just as much as there is a
[1:40:25] atonement to heal your body if you get a
[1:40:28] cancer or you get sick or you get
[1:40:30] something that's wrong with you and
[1:40:32] you're and you've got the you've got the
[1:40:34] courage to stand in christ and say he is
[1:40:38] my healer
[1:40:39] on your body what about your spirit
[1:40:42] what about your emotional realm
[1:40:44] what about the realm that actually
[1:40:46] affects your body so much because what
[1:40:48] you are you what you think you really
[1:40:50] are
[1:40:51] and if you're a negative person and you
[1:40:52] have negative thoughts all the time your
[1:40:54] body is going to be negative
[1:40:57] you know that
[1:40:58] and i'm not speaking about like the
[1:41:00] secret positive affirmation type of um
[1:41:03] psychology thing i'm talking about this
[1:41:05] is real they've just tapped into
[1:41:07] something
[1:41:08] they've tapped into humanity and they've
[1:41:10] realized in the science world and in the
[1:41:12] you know the airy fairy pie in the sky
[1:41:14] stuff
[1:41:15] they've realized that you know that
[1:41:16] doesn't mean it's not true it just means
[1:41:18] that there is a biblical foundation to
[1:41:21] actually thinking positively it says
[1:41:22] that life and death are in the power of
[1:41:24] the tongue but the words come from a
[1:41:26] thought so if you're thinking like life
[1:41:28] or death
[1:41:30] think life if you begin to get a
[1:41:32] narrative in your head that's negative
[1:41:34] you cast it down the bible says
[1:41:36] every single exalts itself against the
[1:41:38] knowledge of god
[1:41:39] cast it down
[1:41:41] cast it down
[1:41:42] discern it and say that's from the hell
[1:41:44] i don't want to have that in my mind i
[1:41:46] don't want to be a negative person
[1:41:48] i'm sick of being negative because when
[1:41:49] you're negative your spirit comes into
[1:41:51] your flesh and it all just starts to
[1:41:53] cause negative things to happen to you
[1:41:55] they say that people that are stressed
[1:41:56] all the time and angry and just
[1:41:58] contentious
[1:41:59] they always more susceptible to things
[1:42:01] like cancer and all that stuff because
[1:42:03] of then the narrative
[1:42:06] now that is fairly general
[1:42:07] it doesn't mean it's everything
[1:42:10] it just means it's more susceptible
[1:42:12] there's also genetics there's all sorts
[1:42:13] of other reason but there is a very
[1:42:16] very clear
[1:42:19] demarcation you could call him
[1:42:21] that if you uh
[1:42:23] if you've got negative chemicals running
[1:42:25] through your like if you're if you're an
[1:42:26] angry negative person and it's causing
[1:42:29] negative chemicals to go through your
[1:42:30] body we're not made to have those
[1:42:32] chemicals go through our body
[1:42:34] constantly
[1:42:36] and you know when you're constantly in
[1:42:38] something that's just negative your body
[1:42:40] actually closes down your spirit that go
[1:42:44] becomes closed
[1:42:45] and then you get depressed
[1:42:47] and then you find you've got no emotion
[1:42:48] at all depression is not sadness
[1:42:50] depression is the void of all emotion
[1:42:53] you know that people think oh depressed
[1:42:54] people are just these sad
[1:42:56] if they're sad they're in a better
[1:42:57] condition
[1:42:59] than than depression clinical depression
[1:43:01] is the void of all emotion but sadness
[1:43:04] there's nothing wrong with being sad
[1:43:06] there's nothing wrong with being you
[1:43:08] know down you can be down because that's
[1:43:10] going to draw you closer to god the
[1:43:12] purpose of all of this roller coaster of
[1:43:14] this life that we call it you know is to
[1:43:16] get us closer to god and so no matter
[1:43:18] what you're going through whether you're
[1:43:20] having an awesome time and you're on the
[1:43:21] mountain and you're rejoicing you're
[1:43:23] getting closer to god or whether you're
[1:43:25] down in the dumps and you're going
[1:43:26] through the hardest trial of your life
[1:43:28] you're getting closer to god that's the
[1:43:30] purpose so when you go through hard
[1:43:32] times and when you go through trial and
[1:43:33] you're going down and it's all just
[1:43:35] everything's against you oh my and even
[1:43:38] yourself you're just oh my you just oh
[1:43:40] you know that
[1:43:41] don't let that be an opportunity to go
[1:43:43] further down and out get closer to god
[1:43:46] hallelujah when you found yourself in a
[1:43:48] in a mild depression it's there's a
[1:43:50] purpose for it don't despise it
[1:43:54] say god why am i here and while i'm here
[1:43:55] i'm gonna look around
[1:43:57] while i'm here i'm gonna discover what's
[1:43:58] the purpose
[1:44:00] because god will never let you go into
[1:44:01] anything that you cannot handle and
[1:44:03] he'll always provide a way of escape
[1:44:06] amen who believes that
[1:44:08] hallelujah so all of this is opportunity
[1:44:11] and today there's an opportunity now as
[1:44:13] i read this list
[1:44:14] i feel like i should read it now
[1:44:16] control
[1:44:18] who's brave enough to put control on the
[1:44:20] altar
[1:44:21] who's brave enough is everyone brave
[1:44:23] enough here you don't need you don't
[1:44:24] need to raise your hand but you can
[1:44:25] because some of us love to be in control
[1:44:29] of others of ourselves of whatever it
[1:44:31] may be
[1:44:33] they love it and they can't help but
[1:44:36] there's a desire there to be in control
[1:44:38] whatever causes that is between them and
[1:44:40] the lord and it can be healed
[1:44:43] that's and what comes under that is
[1:44:44] routines and consistency and surety
[1:44:48] you know things that's always the same
[1:44:50] you just need to be in control of that
[1:44:52] thing
[1:44:54] there's the altar
[1:44:56] human rights
[1:44:58] you know
[1:45:00] god purchased us with a price
[1:45:02] his ultimate sacrifice paid for us in
[1:45:04] full
[1:45:05] you are not your own but you are bought
[1:45:07] with a price
[1:45:08] therefore as a lamb the nature of a lamb
[1:45:12] a lamb will forfeit their right
[1:45:14] to all their human rights to him
[1:45:18] people think they have their human
[1:45:19] rights and really they've already
[1:45:20] forfeited it to some
[1:45:22] ideology of the devil
[1:45:28] oops i'll leave that
[1:45:32] financial security is a big one oh my
[1:45:36] everyone likes to have financial
[1:45:37] security
[1:45:39] but are you willing this morning
[1:45:41] to lay financial security
[1:45:45] right there
[1:45:47] just put it there on that restored altar
[1:45:49] where the fire can come
[1:45:51] and consume that
[1:45:52] are you willing to let god take you into
[1:45:54] the deepest of poverty
[1:45:56] just let go of your finances now i don't
[1:45:58] mean be frivolous and go and just
[1:46:00] waste anything don't do that
[1:46:02] but are you willing to let god take that
[1:46:07] this is a big one financial security
[1:46:11] we all want to be safe
[1:46:12] to be able to pay our bills and
[1:46:15] live a nice comfortable life but
[1:46:17] actually and sometimes we can fight
[1:46:19] against the call of god to do that
[1:46:21] many many people
[1:46:23] at the judgment seat of christ i believe
[1:46:25] will have
[1:46:28] that that that there will be a big one
[1:46:31] where people have chosen their own
[1:46:33] financial security over the calling of
[1:46:36] god
[1:46:37] to be called to do a certain thing and
[1:46:40] they just can't let go of their job or
[1:46:41] they can't let go of their aspiration to
[1:46:44] be a doctor or to be a whatever
[1:46:46] professor you know and there's this
[1:46:48] thing
[1:46:49] that we just have to be willing now i'm
[1:46:50] not saying we should just go and do it
[1:46:52] and go and live in the mountains i'm
[1:46:53] saying that this is an attitude of the
[1:46:56] heart where because you see when that
[1:46:58] goes on the altar
[1:47:00] then god can lead without hindrance you
[1:47:03] won't veto the holy ghost does everyone
[1:47:05] know i think i'd explained veto one time
[1:47:06] didn't i veto
[1:47:09] override
[1:47:10] see the holy ghost can be overridden by
[1:47:13] our own will because he will not touch
[1:47:16] our free will
[1:47:18] therefore you've got to be very careful
[1:47:20] in the sense of are you willing
[1:47:24] to
[1:47:25] surrender your will
[1:47:26] are you willing to die to your own
[1:47:28] ambitions and all of these things so
[1:47:31] human rights
[1:47:32] as lambs you know the lamb nature as the
[1:47:36] holy ghost you know see the jesus was
[1:47:38] the lamb of god
[1:47:39] he depicted himself as the meekest earth
[1:47:41] animal
[1:47:43] he became the lamb of god
[1:47:45] who's forfeited his right to be a man
[1:47:48] forfeited his right to marriage
[1:47:50] forfeited his right and he had a right
[1:47:52] every right
[1:47:54] he had a right to be married he had a
[1:47:56] right as a man to live a nice life and
[1:47:58] to be a carpenter in his father's
[1:48:02] stepfather's house and he had a right to
[1:48:04] do all those and he sacrificed it
[1:48:07] sanctified himself for our sake
[1:48:11] as a lamb the meekest land animal
[1:48:14] and and at the river jordan
[1:48:17] when heaven and earth kissed as you
[1:48:19] could you want to say when the when
[1:48:22] there was a point there where john said
[1:48:23] behold the lamb of god which takes away
[1:48:25] the sin of the world
[1:48:26] and here comes this man meek and lowly
[1:48:29] look like just anybody else walking up
[1:48:33] and john dessert
[1:48:34] here is the lamb of god the meekest
[1:48:37] earth animal
[1:48:38] an animal that can be led an animal that
[1:48:41] would submit to its
[1:48:43] sharing
[1:48:43] would submit to the farmer but as soon
[1:48:46] as you pick up a lamb they just they're
[1:48:48] still
[1:48:49] they're no fighting you try and pick up
[1:48:50] a turkey
[1:48:52] you try and pick up a rooster man those
[1:48:54] things are pecking you and scratching
[1:48:55] you and
[1:48:57] but you pick up a lamb
[1:48:59] just it feels safe
[1:49:01] and this is the thing this meek
[1:49:04] and lowly
[1:49:05] just gentle
[1:49:07] he
[1:49:08] depicted the nature of the son of god as
[1:49:10] a lamb right there
[1:49:12] not always he's a lion as well
[1:49:16] amen
[1:49:17] but that's that's after now
[1:49:20] so
[1:49:21] here's this lamb
[1:49:22] and at the river jordan when heaven came
[1:49:24] down and kissed the earth
[1:49:27] because he was a human remember
[1:49:29] and here is a great event that took
[1:49:31] place where the dove the meekest
[1:49:34] flying creature
[1:49:36] the meekest animal of the sky
[1:49:39] the dove and the lamb
[1:49:41] unite
[1:49:43] and that union
[1:49:45] was a was a powerful union
[1:49:48] where the two meekest animals
[1:49:50] depicted now
[1:49:52] would come together
[1:49:54] and that lamb nature
[1:49:56] god is calling us
[1:49:58] to have a lamb nature
[1:50:01] so that we can have the dove land upon
[1:50:03] us
[1:50:05] but the thing is this flesh is a wolf
[1:50:07] nature this old nature is a wolf nature
[1:50:10] and if you let it rain if you feed it if
[1:50:12] you begin to strengthen it and bolster
[1:50:14] it up and go out there and do external
[1:50:18] emails
[1:50:19] to all that other stuff out there
[1:50:22] you what you're doing is you're building
[1:50:23] up your wolf nature
[1:50:25] and how can you have fellowship with the
[1:50:26] dove if the wolf nature is right up in
[1:50:28] the top front page of your brain and
[1:50:30] just you know you're just all busy and
[1:50:33] you know for me
[1:50:36] mate i have seriously
[1:50:39] i'm preaching to myself because you know
[1:50:41] i i'm quite busy
[1:50:43] so i'm i'm constantly interacting with
[1:50:45] different people and fast busy doing
[1:50:47] stuff and you know i've got to really
[1:50:49] fight that too you know so i'm not just
[1:50:51] preaching at i'm preaching with
[1:50:53] this is
[1:50:54] this is something that we're all got to
[1:50:56] work through
[1:50:57] is that this lamb nature you are willing
[1:51:00] to forfeit your right
[1:51:02] as a human being
[1:51:03] to everything that humans have rights to
[1:51:07] no i don't mean i'm not just talking
[1:51:08] about the geneva convention and talking
[1:51:10] about all the world rights i'll make
[1:51:12] that stuff's just corrupted as it can be
[1:51:14] but i'm talking about just the natural
[1:51:16] rudimentary rights of humanity
[1:51:18] if you are willing to forfeit that
[1:51:21] as a lamb
[1:51:23] you'll have fellowship with the dove
[1:51:25] that doesn't mean you you won't have
[1:51:27] that it's just the willingness to let go
[1:51:30] and let god
[1:51:32] completely have his way
[1:51:34] are you brave enough this morning to lay
[1:51:37] that on the altar hallelujah are you
[1:51:40] brave enough to lay financial security
[1:51:42] on the altar he's jehovah jireh amen
[1:51:46] are you willing and brave enough to lay
[1:51:50] self-secured comforts on the altar easy
[1:51:52] living
[1:51:54] chemical fixes
[1:51:56] and i'm talking about pharmaceuticals
[1:51:58] and drugs and all that stuff you know
[1:51:59] covering up trouble covering up problems
[1:52:02] all the time you're always just covering
[1:52:04] it all up you know sometimes the problem
[1:52:06] is of spirit and you've got to deal with
[1:52:07] it
[1:52:08] stop covering it all up and and and just
[1:52:11] putting all your faith in the chem in
[1:52:13] the medical world now i've got nothing
[1:52:15] against the medical world okay there's a
[1:52:17] blessing there and and i believe that
[1:52:20] god has used that and and there's
[1:52:22] definitely um strength and and all that
[1:52:25] from there but
[1:52:27] but
[1:52:28] are you willing if god calls you
[1:52:31] to trust him
[1:52:34] trust him with your depression
[1:52:35] trust him with that that spiritual
[1:52:38] trouble that you're taking drugs for
[1:52:39] trust him with with uh you know those
[1:52:42] headaches or those migraines trust him
[1:52:45] are you brave
[1:52:47] are you brave enough
[1:52:48] because you see now it's an attitude now
[1:52:50] this is the we're on a balance here
[1:52:52] and so and you
[1:52:54] you know if you're trusting that you're
[1:52:56] over here and you're not trusting the
[1:52:57] lord
[1:52:58] but he wants you to get here
[1:53:01] and when you're here then he can say
[1:53:04] he can call you
[1:53:06] to a position
[1:53:07] he can call you no no all of these
[1:53:09] things i read here
[1:53:11] come to the middle
[1:53:12] don't lean over this way or lean over
[1:53:14] that way unless god calls you
[1:53:17] he will he will never call i don't
[1:53:18] believe god will call you to lean away
[1:53:20] from him he may call you now there's
[1:53:22] different people there's people that
[1:53:24] have a gift of faith there's people that
[1:53:26] are just bulldog believing and they just
[1:53:28] say it and it happens and they pre pray
[1:53:30] and the rain stops and you watch it stop
[1:53:31] they say clouds disappear and it
[1:53:33] disappears stuff like that right
[1:53:34] powerful gifts
[1:53:36] but that doesn't mean we all got that
[1:53:38] you know
[1:53:39] and so you're going to do that he caught
[1:53:40] god's called them to that god's anointed
[1:53:43] them for that so he's pulled them over
[1:53:45] like that now if they're balanced they
[1:53:48] will not try and bring everybody there
[1:53:49] you know what i mean because you can't
[1:53:51] just pull everyone into something it's a
[1:53:53] god thing
[1:53:54] it's not a man thing it's a god thing
[1:53:56] it's a god balance what god wants from
[1:53:59] us and this is the purpose of this whole
[1:54:01] thing today is that you would be in the
[1:54:03] middle
[1:54:03] so that he can lead you he can call you
[1:54:06] to something when we go extremeness
[1:54:09] extreme down or just out of balance it's
[1:54:12] hard for the spirit of god to get
[1:54:14] attention
[1:54:15] but he wants to get your attention this
[1:54:16] morning he wants you to be brave
[1:54:19] are you brave enough because in that
[1:54:21] balance
[1:54:22] your rights your comforts your
[1:54:25] everything is all on that altar and you
[1:54:28] have had the bravery and the courage to
[1:54:30] trust them
[1:54:31] to put it there
[1:54:33] to and leave it there
[1:54:35] takes a bravery it takes a real man
[1:54:38] or a real woman
[1:54:40] not some coward
[1:54:41] not some boy but a real man
[1:54:44] a tough man
[1:54:45] you know someone that's got
[1:54:47] gumption character a man measured by his
[1:54:50] physical muscles he's mentioned by his
[1:54:52] character and his you know when god
[1:54:55] calls men he calls them to these things
[1:54:57] and you look at that and you think oh
[1:54:59] it's such a good story you put yourself
[1:55:00] there
[1:55:01] you go do what moses did you go face a
[1:55:04] government like pharaoh and egypt the
[1:55:06] whole mate
[1:55:09] you know he started off there and it's a
[1:55:11] very similar story in type to the type
[1:55:13] of of christ you know coming to the
[1:55:15] earth because here he is this man who
[1:55:18] was just meant to be pharaoh you know
[1:55:19] he's gonna be the next king of the world
[1:55:21] and he's been trained up in all the
[1:55:23] things of egypt
[1:55:24] and he was called now in his heart
[1:55:27] something was calling moses you're not
[1:55:29] this type of royalty you're a different
[1:55:31] type of royalty see moses look out that
[1:55:33] window and moses looks out the window
[1:55:35] pharaoh's looking out the window and
[1:55:36] they're both looking out the window and
[1:55:38] moses looks out the window and he sees
[1:55:40] royalty
[1:55:42] barrow looks out the window and sees a
[1:55:43] bunch of mud daubers a bunch of slaves
[1:55:46] but moses looks out the window and
[1:55:47] something within him is resonating
[1:55:49] there's royalty
[1:55:51] this is the real thing
[1:55:53] and he began to neutralize
[1:55:55] and he got to a place where he says i'm
[1:55:57] willing and you know what he got called
[1:55:59] out hallelujah 40 years later he came
[1:56:02] back amen he was willing to sacrifice
[1:56:05] he was brave
[1:56:07] he took bravery
[1:56:09] real bravery to let go of the splendor
[1:56:12] of egypt's riches and all the treasures
[1:56:14] and all the wisdom he was trained as a
[1:56:16] military man probably knew all of the
[1:56:18] ways and was trained in judaism and
[1:56:20] trained in all of the abrahamic
[1:56:22] government covenants everything
[1:56:24] trained in it all
[1:56:25] but
[1:56:26] he sacrificed it all
[1:56:29] to be
[1:56:30] you know be found
[1:56:32] as with one of the lord's despised few
[1:56:35] are you willing are you brave enough
[1:56:38] are you brave enough this morning son of
[1:56:40] god are you brave enough this morning
[1:56:42] daughter of god
[1:56:44] to come to a place where god can call
[1:56:46] you
[1:56:47] to come to a place where you can receive
[1:56:48] commission
[1:56:49] to come to a place where he can take you
[1:56:52] higher
[1:56:53] hallelujah to be in a place where you
[1:56:55] won't veto the holy ghost anymore
[1:56:58] we think we sometimes wonder why have i
[1:57:00] sat here so long and i haven't had a
[1:57:02] calling or i haven't had any direction
[1:57:04] personally but i'm watching all this

[1:58:03] self-secured comforts there's a lot of
[1:58:05] things that we do for instant
[1:58:06] gratification one of them for me and i'm
[1:58:09] going to get to it here is junk food
[1:58:11] you know or for sweets and sugars and
[1:58:13] easy stuff oh my you know you eat this
[1:58:16] thing and you immediately you're in a
[1:58:18] happy place
[1:58:19] oh my
[1:58:21] you can be having the worst day ever
[1:58:24] and then you go
[1:58:26] and you begin to eat
[1:58:28] tim tams
[1:58:29] and you suck the coffee through the tim
[1:58:30] tam you know
[1:58:32] and you chew and you just eat that and
[1:58:34] it's just like wow
[1:58:36] and all of a sudden all your woes are
[1:58:37] finished
[1:58:38] for about
[1:58:40] 30 seconds you know
[1:58:44] now that i'm not saying there's anything
[1:58:45] wrong with doing that you can do that
[1:58:48] but if that becomes your you know you
[1:58:50] that becomes your comfort source
[1:58:52] you're going to get fat man
[1:58:55] and you're going to get unhealthy
[1:58:57] because you've let that become primary
[1:58:59] hey let it be a secondary tertiary thing
[1:59:02] there's nothing wrong with god created
[1:59:04] our mouths to produce happy chemicals
[1:59:06] when we eat actually that's why i cook
[1:59:08] and i think people like my food because
[1:59:10] i kind of understand how the happy
[1:59:12] chemicals work so i start putting in
[1:59:14] stuff that makes the happy chemicals
[1:59:16] flow you know
[1:59:19] oh man that's true that's exactly what
[1:59:21] it is i mean
[1:59:23] these fast food outlets they take it to
[1:59:25] the extreme and they study it out and
[1:59:26] they make sure that there's enough of
[1:59:27] this and that and everything so that
[1:59:28] when you eat this thing it's like whoa
[1:59:30] man i'm an euphoria
[1:59:32] and you don't know why but you just like
[1:59:34] it and then you go back and you keep
[1:59:35] going back and you keep going back
[1:59:36] because there's things in there it's
[1:59:37] engineered food engineering
[1:59:39] they do it but
[1:59:41] what i'm meaning here is let that not be
[1:59:44] our primary source of comfort are you
[1:59:46] willing now here's the altar the blood
[1:59:49] is there it's speaking your freedom now
[1:59:51] it's speaking your deliverance now it's
[1:59:53] speaking exodus you know israel was
[1:59:55] called out of egypt hallelujah and these
[1:59:58] are the things of egypt these are the
[2:00:00] things of the world the garlic pots the
[2:00:02] nice food that they had israel had to be
[2:00:05] willing to sacrifice it
[2:00:07] amen moses was willing to sacrifice the
[2:00:10] good goodness sacrificed the royal
[2:00:12] spread
[2:00:14] he sacrificed the royal spread he
[2:00:16] sacrificed all that prime entertainment
[2:00:18] sacrificed it
[2:00:20] because he knew maybe he didn't know but
[2:00:22] we know
[2:00:23] that those things are trouble for his
[2:00:25] spirit
[2:00:26] trouble for his faith trouble for his
[2:00:29] affections you know if you just called
[2:00:31] in now you know um
[2:00:34] consolidate if you consolidate all of
[2:00:36] your affections back
[2:00:38] and you give them all to god man you're
[2:00:40] just going to be living in rapturing
[2:00:41] condition
[2:00:43] you're going to be living in a place
[2:00:44] with god oh my
[2:00:47] i'm telling you now like this morning
[2:00:50] like this is a practical thing now
[2:00:52] and i i save here but it doesn't mean
[2:00:54] it's there i'm just using that as an
[2:00:55] example that here
[2:00:57] is an altar
[2:00:59] and on that altar is the blood of jesus
[2:01:01] that it's restored but and i'm sorry i
[2:01:03] may oh the blood has been shed so that
[2:01:05] you can fall on that altar
[2:01:07] and and these things that i'm bringing
[2:01:09] up place it there and believe
[2:01:13] it's not rocket science it's not
[2:01:15] something complicated we don't have to
[2:01:17] crawl up the stairs of the saint peter's
[2:01:19] basilica on our knees with a rosary bead
[2:01:22] we don't have to do any religious thing
[2:01:25] as far as that is concerned physical
[2:01:27] penances and things we all we need to do
[2:01:29] is believe
[2:01:31] that there is a sacrifice that's made
[2:01:33] for us and he came and that great
[2:01:36] sacrifice he's wanting yours as well
[2:01:38] he's saying come and meet me in the
[2:01:40] sacrifice meet me at the altar
[2:01:43] hallelujah take these things that have
[2:01:45] been troubling your affections take
[2:01:47] these things that you've been leaning on
[2:01:49] for comfort and put them there and bring
[2:01:52] your balance because you might be
[2:01:53] getting comfort from it like this it
[2:01:54] might be just you just feeding on that
[2:01:56] thing and naturally you'll just get
[2:01:58] worse and worse and worse and it's
[2:02:00] saying now bring it to the altar
[2:02:02] bring it here
[2:02:03] and let me lead you to where you need to
[2:02:05] be amen
[2:02:07] so that you can come out of that thing
[2:02:10] hallelujahs it's just just as simple as
[2:02:13] you believing
[2:02:14] as i'm telling you now it's a
[2:02:16] practical lay it right there
[2:02:20] instant gratification
[2:02:23] idols pop music
[2:02:25] romance fantasy tv series
[2:02:27] and i talked about that already it just
[2:02:29] came out john 14
[2:02:31] 15 to 18 it says if you love me
[2:02:34] keep my commandments and i will pray the
[2:02:36] father
[2:02:38] and he shall give you another comforter
[2:02:40] i just want you to i want i want i want
[2:02:42] you to put your name in this
[2:02:44] because you see jesus he speaks these
[2:02:46] things not just to the people he was
[2:02:47] standing around but to you this evening
[2:02:49] this morning he's speaking that to you i
[2:02:51] will give you a comforter amen
[2:02:55] he shall give you another comforter that
[2:02:57] he may abide with you forever he will
[2:02:59] never leave you nor forsake you right
[2:03:01] even the spirit of truth whom the world
[2:03:03] cannot receive
[2:03:05] because it seeth him not neither knoweth
[2:03:07] him but you know him for he dwelleth
[2:03:09] he's talking about himself now obviously
[2:03:11] in third person and i shall be with be
[2:03:14] in you
[2:03:15] because now he goes from a third person
[2:03:16] perspective as that he shall send
[2:03:18] because it's a it's a it's a portion of
[2:03:21] the father's will so he's talking about
[2:03:23] the father's going to send the comforter
[2:03:25] and then he but he actually as he's as
[2:03:27] he's talking he actually becomes the
[2:03:30] comforter so you know he's personifying
[2:03:33] himself
[2:03:34] to say i will never leave you
[2:03:36] i will be in you to the end of the world
[2:03:39] hallelujah
[2:03:40] amen that's god
[2:03:42] he's talking to you
[2:03:45] i want to be your comfort when you're
[2:03:46] down i want to be your your your
[2:03:49] strengths when you are weak i want to be
[2:03:51] your joy when you're happy i want to
[2:03:53] rejoice with you around the sacrifice oh
[2:03:56] yeah
[2:03:57] amen
[2:03:59] glory you know see it's not just a
[2:04:01] one-way thing
[2:04:02] it's not just us having a worship you
[2:04:05] know when you really enter in and you
[2:04:06] realize what's going on and you begin to
[2:04:09] dance up man you're rejoicing and you're
[2:04:11] having a good time
[2:04:13] i believe you know god is there
[2:04:15] and he's rejoicing too because he knows
[2:04:17] that you know this is a good thing
[2:04:19] we're just about going into rapture now
[2:04:22] you know this is why i just pray that as
[2:04:24] a result of this
[2:04:26] that
[2:04:27] our um connection with god will be just
[2:04:30] a bit brighter
[2:04:32] you know if there's something marrying
[2:04:33] you now don't over condemn yourself now
[2:04:35] and go if he's read that listen every
[2:04:36] single one of them's mean
[2:04:39] because there will be a portion of all
[2:04:40] of these in all of us
[2:04:42] because we have flesh hello
[2:04:45] we've got bodies that are subject to the
[2:04:47] fall that have inherited sins from all
[2:04:49] the way back to adam
[2:04:51] can you imagine
[2:04:53] all the bodies and flesh and everything
[2:04:55] is corrupted that's why god says i will
[2:04:57] bruise the seed of the serpent i'll
[2:04:59] bruise his head all his influence all
[2:05:01] that darkness i'm going to give you
[2:05:03] power over it i'm going to raise you up
[2:05:05] so you give dominion
[2:05:06] he said to the disciples i'm going to
[2:05:07] give you power to tread on the serpents
[2:05:10] oh all that serpent nature and all that
[2:05:12] evil doctrine and darkness
[2:05:14] i'll give you power
[2:05:16] and what did he do at the calvary
[2:05:18] hallelujah the greatest sacrifice
[2:05:20] the greatest bravery a man who could
[2:05:23] feel all the pain had to feel the pain
[2:05:26] took it all for us
[2:05:27] hallelujah he broke the back of the
[2:05:30] enemy now the enemies on the ground
[2:05:32] cannot do anything other than lie
[2:05:35] i think i've said that last time
[2:05:36] remember that who remembers that i said
[2:05:38] if he's he he's just lying
[2:05:40] and if he's not lying he's lying on the
[2:05:42] ground and that's it he's lying
[2:05:43] underneath your feet
[2:05:46] mate my mouth is dry
[2:05:51] if your mouth is dry it starts foaming
[2:05:53] you know
[2:05:55] if anyone's preached they'll understand
[2:05:56] [Laughter]
[2:05:58] the front people at the front are going
[2:06:00] man
[2:06:01] brother andy
[2:06:05] oh my well we're just people you know we
[2:06:07] just have a good time amen
[2:06:09] and so he gives us power over all the
[2:06:12] darkness power
[2:06:14] and today it's power for you
[2:06:16] today it's power for you to hop out of
[2:06:18] yourself go beyond the camp today
[2:06:21] go beyond the camp of your discomforts
[2:06:23] go beyond the camp of your rights go be
[2:06:26] on the camp of your creature comforts go
[2:06:28] beyond the camp of those crutches that
[2:06:30] you've held onto all your life to give
[2:06:32] you comfort to give you peace when the
[2:06:34] peace giver is saying come to me
[2:06:38] come to me if you want my peace that i
[2:06:40] give that the world cannot give
[2:06:43] let that go
[2:06:44] so that you can have my peace
[2:06:46] it's a simple transaction
[2:06:48] but it can be very difficult
[2:06:50] because you get so used to the routine
[2:06:54] that you have where you do your thing
[2:06:56] then you do that thing and then that
[2:06:57] thing and then that thing and then you
[2:06:58] go to this and you you the the
[2:07:01] aspiration the knowledge that i'm about

[2:07:05] thing and you sit down
[2:07:07] and it's like you just feel pulled
[2:07:08] towards it because it's the way the
[2:07:10] human nature works
[2:07:13] but today are you brave enough to put it
[2:07:16] there

[2:07:35] the holy ghost upon a people that would
[2:07:37] believe to give them dominion and he
[2:07:39] said to them look i'm going to give you
[2:07:41] power to treat on the serpent i'm going
[2:07:43] to give you power over the darkness and
[2:07:45] you're going to prevail

[2:07:52] i will not leave you comfortless he says

[2:08:20] to be neutral
[2:08:22] he's waiting for you
[2:08:24] to quit the extremism
[2:08:27] to quit the humanistic
[2:08:29] um enterprise

[2:08:34] the ultra's there for you to be
[2:08:36] separated from that you know you know um
[2:08:39] it says in ezekiel 16 and god's talking
[2:08:43] to israel and he's typing them with a
[2:08:44] woman that was found in a pool of blood
[2:08:47] and left for dead but her umbilical cord
[2:08:49] was still on tied to babylon or whatever

[2:09:47] scary
[2:09:48] but you don't have to be scared
[2:09:50] you think gideon was you know he started
[2:09:52] off scared but then he had a visitation
[2:09:53] from the angel and see the angel he he
[2:09:56] he he spoke over gideon hallelujah he

[2:12:07] hallelujah
[2:12:12] the blood is speaking
[2:12:14] popularity
[2:12:17] is one of the big ones people don't want
[2:12:18] to give up their standing in society
[2:12:21] but
[2:12:22] are you brave enough
[2:12:23] do you think um
[2:12:25] you know joshua and caleb do you think
[2:12:27] they were brave enough
[2:12:29] did they have the bravado
[2:12:31] to stand against the rest of israel
[2:12:34] when they saw what god promised and
[2:12:36] faith it was registered in them that our
[2:12:38] god is faithful
[2:12:40] and even though i see the enemy so big
[2:12:42] and so strong
[2:12:43] god promised that
[2:12:45] i am not going to care what all my
[2:12:47] friends say i'm not going to care what
[2:12:49] the people at school say i'm not going
[2:12:50] to care what all even anything and all
[2:12:53] all the other pastors all the other
[2:12:54] leaders no god told me to do this god
[2:12:58] says he promised that i'm going to go
[2:13:00] regardless of popularity
[2:13:03] whether i get the people's vote or not
[2:13:05] this is where god is calling us to a
[2:13:08] place now
[2:13:09] now he's not calling you to extremism
[2:13:11] that you go you know there's people that
[2:13:12] go out there and they're just
[2:13:14] you know they're they're out on their
[2:13:16] own and they're just a rogue you know
[2:13:17] like he's not calling us to a rogue
[2:13:19] calling it's per se
[2:13:21] but it's a balance
[2:13:22] of where your
[2:13:24] desire for popularity
[2:13:26] is gone
[2:13:28] and actually you know you're already
[2:13:30] accepted in the beloved amen so you're
[2:13:33] already popular
[2:13:34] you're popular
[2:13:36] in the kingdom of god in the economy of
[2:13:38] god you're popular
[2:13:40] hallelujah you're popular in heaven
[2:13:41] there's a great cloud of witnesses who
[2:13:44] believes that we're surrounded by so
[2:13:45] great a cloud of witnesses you know they
[2:13:47] love you and you're accepted
[2:13:49] you didn't earn it you were given
[2:13:51] acceptance hallelujah you know at school
[2:13:54] and it worked and in the world you've
[2:13:56] got to do something to get accepted
[2:13:57] you've got to be something got to have
[2:13:58] something
[2:14:00] but in christ
[2:14:02] you are made accepted
[2:14:04] you're already accepted and you're
[2:14:05] already popular so you don't need to
[2:14:06] desire it you don't need to prove
[2:14:08] yourself you don't need to be something
[2:14:09] great you don't need to be something
[2:14:10] anything you already are
[2:14:13] popular hallelujah
[2:14:15] actually to try and be popular creates
[2:14:18] less popularity
[2:14:19] in the kingdom of god you know you just
[2:14:21] get yourself fixed up and you get
[2:14:22] yourself in a fix and
[2:14:24] and you know like you get complexes in
[2:14:26] your mind because this one doesn't like
[2:14:28] you because they look to you like that
[2:14:29] and everything but if you just believe
[2:14:32] and you're at peace you actually create
[2:14:34] an atmosphere that people want to be
[2:14:36] around
[2:14:37] you know you don't have to try and prove
[2:14:39] anything you just
[2:14:42] rest
[2:14:43] and all of a sudden you're in fellowship
[2:14:45] with god
[2:14:46] and then people want to be in fellowship
[2:14:47] with you all the time because you you
[2:14:49] just have an atmosphere and they know
[2:14:51] that if they come there they're going to
[2:14:52] get a word from the lord or they're
[2:14:54] going to get if they pray you know you
[2:14:56] and people have confidence in your
[2:14:57] prayers because you're not seeking after
[2:15:00] something or there's no ulterior motive
[2:15:02] it's just pure
[2:15:04] that's the kingdom of god
[2:15:06] that's the way of the king the way of
[2:15:07] the master that's our way
[2:15:10] that's why you don't have to seek after
[2:15:11] popularity and actually be willing like
[2:15:14] joshua and caleb and the face of all the
[2:15:16] other spies in the face of everything
[2:15:18] they stood up they ran their garments
[2:15:20] and said no god is surely able to give
[2:15:23] us the land and everyone else was
[2:15:25] against them and they were going to
[2:15:26] stone them and then god took over
[2:15:29] and said because you guys have
[2:15:30] unbelieved
[2:15:31] you shall not see the land but joshua
[2:15:34] and caleb will preserved them and then
[2:15:36] 40 years later they were old
[2:15:38] caleb says i'm still the same strength
[2:15:41] so the same power that kept us close
[2:15:44] all thing i believe that he was still
[2:15:46] strong
[2:15:47] same power
[2:15:49] you know it's a resurrection life
[2:15:51] you can please god
[2:15:52] by not being going with the crowd
[2:15:56] don't go with the crowd
[2:15:57] hey there's nothing wrong with rejoicing
[2:15:59] with the crowd rejoice at the crowd
[2:16:01] if you see your brother having a
[2:16:02] glorious time have a glorious time with
[2:16:03] them
[2:16:04] you might not have you're not not
[2:16:05] feeling anything but praise god they're
[2:16:07] having a good time i'm happy for them
[2:16:09] and then all of a sudden the glory comes
[2:16:11] on you too
[2:16:12] it's a chain reaction in those cases but
[2:16:15] then maybe the crowd has known nothing
[2:16:17] but you god is working on you and and
[2:16:20] you you just you know especially the
[2:16:22] children with all the pressure don't
[2:16:24] worry about what your friends think you
[2:16:26] rejoice
[2:16:27] hallelujah
[2:16:28] you rejoice if god is touching your
[2:16:31] heart young children then you rejoice
[2:16:33] don't worry about what your friends are
[2:16:34] rejoicing or not you rejoice if the
[2:16:36] girls you know they're all the girls
[2:16:38] coming up at camp and they're all there
[2:16:39] you know
[2:16:41] i trust that they were there for their
[2:16:42] individual reason
[2:16:44] they weren't following a crowd they were
[2:16:46] there sovereignly with god
[2:16:48] young girls little ten nine-year-olds
[2:16:50] crying out to god
[2:16:52] screaming out under his power
[2:16:54] at camp you know like that's that's
[2:16:56] powerful but you see
[2:16:58] maybe that hasn't happened and then one
[2:17:00] of those girls
[2:17:02] you know
[2:17:02] it was just her
[2:17:04] and god's working on her and she comes
[2:17:06] to the front
[2:17:07] she's not doing it for popularity
[2:17:09] she's doing it for her because it's god
[2:17:12] god's working on our heart and it's the
[2:17:14] same thing with us
[2:17:16] you know we really need to make sure
[2:17:18] that we're not re we're not reacting or
[2:17:20] acting upon what other people just
[2:17:21] because of other people that's not the
[2:17:23] reason the reason is we have come to a
[2:17:26] place where we're not seeking after
[2:17:27] population we're secure in ourselves we
[2:17:29] don't have to secure our place we don't
[2:17:31] have to secure our position no where
[2:17:34] the security is god
[2:17:36] here's the security detail
[2:17:38] hey man he's the bodyguard
[2:17:40] not you you don't have to secure
[2:17:42] anything you don't have to secure your
[2:17:43] finances you just had to be diligent
[2:17:46] faithful
[2:17:47] but you know now this is just coming
[2:17:50] there is
[2:17:51] out of balance diligence too
[2:17:53] where you're controlling it
[2:17:55] where you've become the law of your own
[2:17:58] diligence
[2:17:59] and you it becomes an idol and i've seen
[2:18:01] i know people
[2:18:03] not on the message not here in the
[2:18:04] church but people that i do work with
[2:18:07] and stuff and their diligence with money
[2:18:10] is an idol
[2:18:11] and it's everything and it's even more
[2:18:13] higher than their human relationships
[2:18:15] they will go it's all about well it's
[2:18:17] not but it is you know because it's all
[2:18:19] in the name of diligence so i don't want
[2:18:21] you you know we should we've got to be
[2:18:23] very balanced when it comes to diligence
[2:18:25] even
[2:18:26] don't let diligence become an idol
[2:18:28] that's higher than god and you've got to
[2:18:29] be super diligent with all the stuff and
[2:18:31] if someone else isn't then and it's not
[2:18:33] up to your level of your own
[2:18:34] humanistically created diligence and
[2:18:36] they're not and you start to condemn
[2:18:38] them because they're not like you don't
[2:18:40] that's all the way over here now in
[2:18:42] their extreme humanistic legalistic
[2:18:44] vision you've got to bring it back
[2:18:46] are you willing to lay that on the altar
[2:18:48] are you brave enough to lay your
[2:18:49] diligence on the altar
[2:18:52] hallelujah
[2:18:54] hallelujah
[2:19:00] the next one is justice are you brave
[2:19:02] enough to lay justice
[2:19:05] your reparation retribution
[2:19:08] contempt
[2:19:09] resentments
[2:19:11] self-harm you know you can resent others
[2:19:13] but
[2:19:13] generally there's people that don't
[2:19:15] resent others as well they resent
[2:19:16] themselves and they harm themselves and
[2:19:18] they do things to themselves they punish
[2:19:20] themselves
[2:19:21] don't punish yourself
[2:19:23] why are you punishing yourself
[2:19:25] mate you get we've got enough against us
[2:19:28] to punish ourselves you know we don't
[2:19:30] want to be doing that
[2:19:31] man you know it's true
[2:19:33] people they get into a ploy it's a
[2:19:35] spirit that people begin to harm
[2:19:37] themselves even you know and they find
[2:19:39] comfort in cutting their arms and
[2:19:40] cutting themselves and all these
[2:19:42] different crazy
[2:19:44] it's a it's really bad but it's actually
[2:19:46] something that they do to feel comfort
[2:19:48] that they've actually done themselves a
[2:19:51] a punishment because of how useless they
[2:19:53] think they are but really this is a
[2:19:55] place that we need to get out of that
[2:19:57] are you willing to lay
[2:20:00] self-contentment today
[2:20:03] lay it there
[2:20:04] stop getting angry at yourself stop
[2:20:06] doubting yourself stop stop you know
[2:20:08] condemning yourself for your own
[2:20:10] failures
[2:20:11] because that there is pulling you out of
[2:20:13] balance
[2:20:14] it's pulling you in a place where you
[2:20:16] high expectation of yourself and when
[2:20:17] you do fail you actually pull yourself
[2:20:19] out of fellowship with god because you
[2:20:21] get angry and you begin to swear you
[2:20:23] begin to get frustrated at the things
[2:20:25] that you're doing and you call yourself
[2:20:26] names all that sort of stuff just just
[2:20:28] lay it now you know right now the power
[2:20:30] of the blood
[2:20:31] is there to free you
[2:20:33] and maybe it's someone on here on that
[2:20:35] video there just lay it down
[2:20:38] be free from that
[2:20:40] because you see that thing there is a
[2:20:41] bondage
[2:20:44] and it's those things there are we brave
[2:20:46] enough to let that go are you brave
[2:20:48] enough to let contempt go holding
[2:20:50] grudges all those things let it go
[2:20:53] let it there and be free in the name of
[2:20:55] jesus christ hallelujah lay it down
[2:20:59] right now
[2:21:00] hallelujah amen ambitions who are you
[2:21:04] really you know we have ambitions and
[2:21:06] you see we're born in the world and
[2:21:07] we've got brothers and sisters or maybe
[2:21:09] we're the only child whatever it may be
[2:21:11] or we've got parents and they've got
[2:21:12] aspirations and they've got ideas and
[2:21:14] then we go to school and we have friends
[2:21:15] that have got ideas and then we go
[2:21:17] through some things and we think oh and
[2:21:18] you see something that strikes you and
[2:21:21] you think wow
[2:21:22] i've got to help that situation so then
[2:21:24] you tr you push and you go after that
[2:21:27] and that's your whole life's purpose
[2:21:29] it's an aspiration
[2:21:31] now
[2:21:35] who are you
[2:21:36] and this is the question
[2:21:37] is that the real you or is that the one
[2:21:41] the you that's been shaped by
[2:21:42] circumstances that's been shaped and
[2:21:45] impressed by situations over your life
[2:21:47] impressed by
[2:21:49] parents that that would push you in a
[2:21:51] certain direction or impressed by your
[2:21:53] own uh insecurity
[2:21:56] but really there's a real you the one
[2:21:57] that's waiting for you in heaven you
[2:21:59] know it says that with this body be
[2:22:01] dissolved we have one already in heaven
[2:22:03] eternal in the heavens that we will go
[2:22:05] into this body so there is a part of you
[2:22:07] that's already there somehow an eternity
[2:22:10] that you will go into now that one there
[2:22:12] i believe is the one that god saw before
[2:22:14] the foundation of the world that one
[2:22:16] that part of you that was in his mind
[2:22:18] that he thought of you
[2:22:19] that's a perfect you now he's we're in
[2:22:22] this end time we're being called to come
[2:22:24] into union with who we really are
[2:22:27] and our true self and our true nature
[2:22:29] and our true purpose
[2:22:31] come into union so are you for that to
[2:22:33] happen
[2:22:34] and i think this is very serious for
[2:22:37] that to happen are you willing to lay
[2:22:39] all of your ambitions
[2:22:42] are you brave enough who's brave
[2:22:44] brave enough
[2:22:46] you see you could there's nothing wrong
[2:22:48] with having them but just bring them
[2:22:49] back to the middle
[2:22:50] have them right in the middle
[2:22:52] if you put them over here he's not going
[2:22:54] to pull you out
[2:22:55] pull you into the middle you've got to
[2:22:57] choose
[2:22:58] he sits before you today life and death
[2:23:02] this is death because it's you
[2:23:04] it's it just isn't him but coming into
[2:23:07] here you don't throw it out
[2:23:09] don't throw anything out unless it's
[2:23:11] evil
[2:23:12] if you know it's evil then you know it's
[2:23:14] evil you get rid of it it's fine
[2:23:17] but if it's just a normal human thing or
[2:23:19] a job or whatever an aspiration of life
[2:23:21] that we have to kind of participate in
[2:23:23] right now then then bring it to the
[2:23:24] middle
[2:23:26] let god
[2:23:27] call you because when you're in the
[2:23:28] middle benny can call you to wherever he
[2:23:30] wants you to be but when we drive
[2:23:33] ourselves and we drive it into the
[2:23:34] ground and we put a stake down and you
[2:23:36] put a you put a rope around the tree and
[2:23:38] you begin to what's that thing called in
[2:23:40] the car where they went
[2:23:42] they you're winching yourself to that
[2:23:44] purpose of your own imagination
[2:23:47] it's dark
[2:23:49] can't do it you can do it but you won't
[2:23:51] get any rewards for that you see at the
[2:23:54] judgment seat of christ
[2:23:55] all
[2:23:56] that all that was his will will be
[2:23:58] everything will be tried by fire and
[2:24:01] only that which he is called to do will
[2:24:03] remain so you can serve all your life
[2:24:05] and have all the stuff that you've done
[2:24:08] and it may not even come through the
[2:24:09] fire because really it was you that did
[2:24:11] it and it might be something that would
[2:24:13] help people might be a blessing to
[2:24:15] people but it wasn't actually the plan
[2:24:16] of god so this is where it's so
[2:24:19] important are you willing to lay your
[2:24:20] ambitions there are you willing to lay
[2:24:23] your aspirations that your dreams your
[2:24:24] visions amen what people think you're

[2:24:40] enough teenagers are you brave enough to
[2:24:42] let god give you are you brave enough to
[2:24:44] let go of your own thoughts and let god
[2:24:47] show you who you really are

[2:25:05] groups entities you know these big
[2:25:07] groups that people form and all that
[2:25:09] sort of stuff
[2:25:10] it gets a spirit over it and it begins
[2:25:12] to pressure people to be a certain way
[2:25:14] and if you step outside you know like
[2:25:17] you could say israel had a matriarchal
[2:25:19] spirit
[2:25:20] because it wasn't god's spirit that was
[2:25:22] leading israel the all of them that
[2:25:25] unbelieved it was a matriarchal spirit a
[2:25:27] collective spirit of human beings
[2:25:29] together then the devil got in there and
[2:25:31] a matriarchal spirit took over and began
[2:25:33] to pull them into unbelief
[2:25:35] but are you willing like joshua and
[2:25:37] caleb to say to defy that
[2:25:40] are you willing to defy the collective
[2:25:41] spirit of shekinah tabernacle
[2:25:44] i know that sounds pretty harsh
[2:25:46] are you willing to defy and especially
[2:25:49] the children are you willing to defy the
[2:25:51] spirit of your skull
[2:25:53] and stand up and say i'm a son of god
[2:25:55] and i'm ready to stand and i'm ready to
[2:25:57] walk and i'm i'm brave
[2:26:00] i'm brave enough to lay it down and let
[2:26:02] god be in me and let god lead me are you
[2:26:06] brave enough now nationally speaking the
[2:26:08] message of new zealand are you brave
[2:26:10] enough to stand against it

[2:26:14] lots of them
[2:26:15] that have been from the past and
[2:26:17] hang-ups and disunities and all sorts of
[2:26:19] politics
[2:26:20] that's a matriarchal spirit trying to
[2:26:22] keep everyone in the wilderness but
[2:26:24] there's individuals like joshua and
[2:26:25] caleb that are ready to cross over that
[2:26:28] have crossed over that are walking in
[2:26:30] victory amen are you willing or are you
[2:26:32] just going to stay in the status quo and
[2:26:34] float around and be everybody's friend
[2:26:37] were you willing to make a stand for
[2:26:39] your convictions and have a real bravery
[2:26:42] are you brave enough because you see if
[2:26:44] you get to a place where you're neutral
[2:26:46] and god calls you you're going to need
[2:26:48] to be brave
[2:26:49] you're going to need to be brave because
[2:26:50] this guy you're going to lose popularity
[2:26:52] someone's going to speak this against
[2:26:53] you you're going to get criticized that
[2:26:55] you because anyone that amounts to
[2:26:57] hillary beans that does anything for god
[2:26:59] that has been called out to do something
[2:27:02] we'll go through critics we'll go
[2:27:03] through all of the gauntlet we'll go
[2:27:05] through the trials they come face to
[2:27:07] face with the devil because you see

[2:28:36] maybe we're just singing that first one
[2:28:38] i said
[2:28:39] [Music]
[2:28:42] that was i passed the outer court
[2:28:45] you can stand
[2:28:47] [Music]
[2:28:48] just before we sing i have to finish
[2:28:50] this
[2:28:55] there it is
[2:28:56] all your
[2:28:57] any hang-ups that you may have or any
[2:29:00] things that have been brought to your
[2:29:02] attention i believe it's already gone
[2:29:05] i believe there's been deliverance today
[2:29:07] and if you believe it it will happen
[2:29:09] hallelujah so that you can stand
[2:29:13] against all of the spirits and all the
[2:29:14] things of this world
[2:29:16] with meekness
[2:29:18] not going out there is some
[2:29:21] corrective ministry that corrects
[2:29:22] everyone that's wrong that stuff is
[2:29:24] you're wasting your time
[2:29:26] absolutely waste of time it's better to
[2:29:28] talk about the true than to expose the
[2:29:30] false all the time nothing wrong with
[2:29:32] having a bit of you know discernment
[2:29:35] but if you focus your whole life on
[2:29:38] trying to get trying to expose the devil
[2:29:40] all you're going to have is darkness
[2:29:42] because all you're doing is raising
[2:29:43] darkness and putting darkness over the
[2:29:44] people they all know all about the
[2:29:45] darkness but what about the light
[2:29:47] what about jesus what about the one who
[2:29:50] saved us what about the true sacrifice
[2:29:52] now if he was willing to sacrifice it he
[2:29:55] was brave enough to leave the splendor
[2:29:57] of heaven and come down and and
[2:29:59] sacrifice himself the true christmas
[2:30:01] story then are you willing who's willing
[2:30:04] this morning
[2:30:05] who's willing to sacrifice themselves to
[2:30:08] sacrifice all of these things so that
[2:30:10] you can walk in his calling come to
[2:30:13] neutrality come to the center come to
[2:30:16] the center of the road saints hallelujah

[2:30:20] to pray together and right there maybe
[2:30:23] you need prayer then we're going to pray
[2:30:25] together and you can lift it up before
[2:30:27] the lord in his presence and let him

[2:33:31] hallelujah
[2:33:32] let me read a quote here i just want to
[2:33:34] read this quote i believe it's very
[2:33:37] pertinent right now just as the music's
[2:33:39] playing
[2:33:40] what is the ultimate solution for this
[2:33:42] human question
[2:33:44] it's love
[2:33:47] friends
[2:33:48] i'm not no little boy no more i've seen
[2:33:51] so many attest
[2:33:52] but i've never seen nothing yet could
[2:33:54] override love
[2:33:56] it just takes everything out of the way
[2:33:58] love conquers wild animal love conquers
[2:34:01] it's the most conquering force there is
[2:34:03] because it's god what is it
[2:34:06] love conquers all things love the lord
[2:34:08] with all your heart with all your soul
[2:34:11] with all your mind with all your
[2:34:13] strengths hallelujah amen it's a big one
[2:34:16] now
[2:34:16] and faith
[2:34:18] will accompany that love
[2:34:20] it says now notice abraham had to
[2:34:22] believe god in order
[2:34:24] love god to believe him
[2:34:25] you love him
[2:34:27] and more you love him the more faith
[2:34:29] will accumulate
[2:34:31] love is the connection that permeates
[2:34:33] love is the real issue of life love
[2:34:36] projects god's reality
[2:34:38] love is our anchor
[2:34:40] love forges our point of contact to god
[2:34:43] love has stems of connective gravity
[2:34:46] love is a hub of grace love is
[2:34:49] opportunity
[2:34:50] love is our place of momentum
[2:34:52] love builds our walk love conquers all
[2:34:55] love is progress love enables us to
[2:34:57] trust
[2:34:58] love enables us to surrender hallelujah
[2:35:01] love is reason
[2:35:05] god moves in nature love conquers
[2:35:07] everything and when love is projected
[2:35:09] grace comes in to help it then it's real
[2:35:12] conquering love
[2:35:14] so all of this my brother my sister that
[2:35:17] you've heard today
[2:35:19] is all bolstered with love
[2:35:22] if you're struggling with
[2:35:24] something then right now as we pray
[2:35:28] raise your heart lift your heart up to
[2:35:30] god and say god
[2:35:32] let me love you more help me to love you
[2:35:35] more maybe you've had trouble with love
[2:35:37] in your life and you've blocked up love
[2:35:39] channels then right now the altar is
[2:35:42] here for healing
[2:35:43] that you can be healed of that love
[2:35:45] trouble
[2:35:46] so that you can really love god because
[2:35:48] if you if you struggle to love humans
[2:35:51] then that is also going to be projected
[2:35:53] in your love to god
[2:35:54] and i believe that right now
[2:35:56] love can be healed in your life right
[2:35:58] now because loving god is it all
[2:36:01] culminates it all comes and stems into
[2:36:04] love
[2:36:06] and if you struggle to give something up
[2:36:08] because you don't want to release it to
[2:36:09] god
[2:36:11] and you're holding on to it you're
[2:36:12] controlling it right now because it's
[2:36:14] giving you security
[2:36:15] then release that security to god
[2:36:18] and if you're struggling then ask god
[2:36:20] now as we pray for love to love him so
[2:36:23] that love because love works faith the
[2:36:25] bible says
[2:36:27] amen are you ready to let go
[2:36:30] hallelujah
