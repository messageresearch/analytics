[43:37] sight that Moses said I exceedingly fear
[43:40] and quake but ye are come unto Mount
[43:43] Zion and unto the city of the Living God
[43:46] the heavenly Jerusalem and to an
[43:49] innumerable company of angels to the
[43:51] General Assembly and
[43:54] which of the firstborn which are written
[43:56] in heaven and to God the judge of all
[43:58] and to the spirits of just men made
[44:00] perfect and to Jesus the mediator of the
[44:04] New Covenant and to the blood of
[44:06] sprinkling that speaketh better things
[44:09] than that of Abel I mean unless just
[44:12] turn to another scriptures go to the
[44:14] book of Job and we're going to go to job
[44:16] 3 and 25
[44:32] and Jobe says here for the thing which I
[44:41] greatly feared has come upon me and that
[44:44] which I was afraid of has come unto me
[44:46] may the lordly bless his word this
[44:49] morning you may have your seats and the
[44:50] presence of the Lord I'd like to take a
[44:54] just just take a thought from from
[44:59] Hebrews chapter 12 about how the blood
[45:02] of the Lamb
[45:03] speaks bear things than that of Abel now
[45:06] we are living in a in a tremendous time
[45:09] where the Apostle Paul said that we have
[45:11] not come to Mount Zion we've not come to
[45:13] the law where God has separated from
[45:16] from man you know they could not you
[45:18] know they see at boundaries around the
[45:19] bottom of the mountain that you know no
[45:20] one could approach it or well you know
[45:22] come near it but there was a distance
[45:25] between God and man and the Old
[45:26] Testament because of sin but you know
[45:29] now now in the yo under the blood of
[45:32] Jesus Christ yeah I'm just gonna go a
[45:34] bit slow this morning but just just just
[45:36] be it with me I'm just trying to stay on
[45:39] my feet but you know under the blood of
[45:42] Jesus Christ you know we are not come to
[45:44] a place of separation between us and God
[45:47] but you know as as it was death in the
[45:49] Old Testament for people to go into the
[45:51] Holy of Holies into the prints of God
[45:53] you know only the high priests of God
[45:55] once a year anointed dressed a certain
[45:57] way with the blood you know it was death
[46:00] for anyone else to go in but now it's
[46:02] death not to go into the prints of God
[46:04] it's just become the opposite now where
[46:06] it's death to stay away but it's life to
[46:09] go into his presence so we have come to
[46:12] eat we have come to a place where where
[46:15] the churches has you know we have not
[46:17] come to Mount Zion but we've come to the
[46:19] new jersey I mean so we have not come to
[46:22] Mount Sinai but we've come to Mount Zion
[46:24] to the city of the Living God amen and
[46:28] to and so now the let's just go to as
[46:32] well let's go to the book of Deuteronomy
[46:34] and in chapter 16 because I want to if I
[46:39] could impart something to us today I
[46:41] just want to say this that
[46:44] we are the the believer that's been
[46:48] called into his presence and not just
[46:51] not just you know the scribes and
[46:53] Pharisees were in the prints of God but
[46:54] those who have come under the blood
[46:56] they've come under the word they've met
[46:58] him they've become one with him there we
[47:00] should be the most happiest people in
[47:02] all the world all the pressures should
[47:04] be let off you know brother Brown preach
[47:06] the sermon letting off the pressure the
[47:08] name of the Lord is a strong tower the
[47:10] righteous run into and a safe that all
[47:12] the pressures of life can be let go I
[47:15] mean because we ran our haven of rest we
[47:17] don't need to worry whatever situation
[47:19] comes our way what trials we may be
[47:20] facing I mean but we are in a place of
[47:23] safety now the Lord has dictated in his
[47:26] word that there's specific places to
[47:28] worship Him and we read here in
[47:30] Deuteronomy 16 where it says in
[47:33] Deuteronomy 16 and 1 it says observe the
[47:36] law of evidence re the month of a bird
[47:39] and keep the Passover unto the Lord thy
[47:42] God from the month of Abbott the LORD
[47:45] thy God brought thee forth out of Egypt
[47:48] by night thou shalt therefore sacrifice
[47:51] the Passover and the LORD thy God of the
[47:54] flock and the herd and in the place
[47:56] which the Lord has chosen to place his
[47:58] name so notice God's plate giving a
[48:01] specific instruction here thou shall eat
[48:03] no leavened bread with it seven days
[48:05] thou shall eat unleavened bread there
[48:07] worth even the bread of affliction for
[48:10] thou camest forth out of the land of
[48:12] Egypt and hast that thou mayest remember
[48:15] the day when thou comest forth out of
[48:18] the land of Egypt all the days of thy
[48:20] life and there shall be no leavened
[48:22] bread seen with thee in all biko seven
[48:26] days neither shall there there anything
[48:29] of the flesh which they are sacrifices
[48:32] the first eight even remain all night
[48:36] until the morning
[48:36] thou mayest not sacrificed the Passover
[48:39] within any of thy gates which the Lord
[48:42] giveth thee but where he's come out he
[48:45] but he commands him that that the place
[48:47] where he puts his name that gate is
[48:50] where you should worship the Lord and
[48:52] sacrifice so God is saying as now we
[48:55] know the Old Testament as a shadow of
[48:57] the new so
[48:59] when we NEET so so here in the Old
[49:02] Testament we know God to speak of a
[49:04] geographical location but God is still
[49:07] given an instruction you just don't
[49:09] worship anywhere and in any gate that
[49:12] you have made any place you have made
[49:13] but in God's provided places where you
[49:16] should worship so where he has places
[49:18] named that's where the believer worship
[49:21] so we want to we want to find that place
[49:23] we want to worship there and because of
[49:25] it worship there then our worship is
[49:27] accepted because we ultimately we want
[49:29] to be accepted by God right Amen so we
[49:32] want to worship at a place where we are
[49:34] accepted Amen so now you know because in
[49:38] the Bible there's this worship that's
[49:39] accepted a worships rejected Cain's
[49:41] worship was rejected Abel's was accepted
[49:44] right so we want to be accepted like
[49:46] Abel was okay so now so so he's saying
[49:50] that you just can't worship God anywhere
[49:52] with a place but but it's where God has
[49:55] chosen to place his name that's where we
[49:58] worship God now we know Jesus when he
[50:01] came he says I come and my father's name
[50:03] and you received me not so the name of
[50:06] of of God is Jesus right because the
[50:10] name of Jesus means Jehovah salvation
[50:13] says the full manifestation of God
[50:15] salvation was manifested in the man
[50:18] Jesus Christ so God put his name in his
[50:21] son Jesus Christ and we know that he is
[50:24] the word right in the beginning John 1
[50:27] and 1 was the word and the Word was with
[50:29] God and the Word was God and the word
[50:31] became flesh and dwelt among us so where
[50:34] God has put his name as in his word
[50:36] right so if you're worshiping God
[50:39] according to the revelation of his word
[50:42] you're worshiping and God's providing
[50:44] place of worship in Christ if you're
[50:46] worshiping a man-made Creed you're not
[50:48] in God's provide a place of worship but
[50:50] if you are worshiping God under the
[50:53] anointed word of your day according to
[50:55] the revelation of it then you're
[50:56] worshiping God's provide a place you're
[50:58] worshiping where God has placed his name
[51:01] hallelujah they mean so now that's where
[51:05] we want to be worshiping so brother
[51:08] Branham would say he sees us in things
[51:11] that are to be
[51:12] and there shall be no leavened bread oh
[51:13] sorry how much more able he's able to
[51:16] get he's a creator now think how he's
[51:18] able to prepare us a body to live like
[51:21] his own glorious body if we want to live
[51:24] there's something in us Khalsa live and
[51:26] there are something in us that calls to
[51:29] do right then God will give somebody on
[51:31] the platform or the pulpit that will
[51:33] preach the absolute truth why it shows
[51:35] you then if you're a real child of God
[51:37] you begin to cry out God take it away
[51:39] from me circumcise me from this take
[51:42] these things away from me why it's
[51:43] needed for your heavenly home that
[51:45] you're going to where he's gone to
[51:47] prepare you've got to be a real word
[51:50] Bride of Christ amen as the bridegroom
[51:52] as the word so the bride will be the
[51:54] word I was preaching a few nights ago on
[51:56] the sacrifice in the days of atonement I
[51:58] was preaching on the only place of God
[52:01] the only church that God will ever meet
[52:03] a man and and that is he said the place
[52:05] that he put his name he said I won't
[52:08] meet them in any other place but the
[52:10] place the gate that I put my name in now
[52:12] he doesn't meet you in the method escape
[52:14] the Baptist's gate the Pentecostal gate
[52:16] or any of them but he put his name in
[52:18] his son he said I come in my father's
[52:20] name any man comes or child comes in his
[52:23] father's name I come in the name of a
[52:25] Brandon because my father was a Branham
[52:27] and you come in your name because that's
[52:30] your father's name and Jesus the son
[52:32] came in his father's name he said he put
[52:35] his name in this gate that I put my name
[52:38] and that was the sacrifice and in Jesus
[52:41] Christ is the only place you'll ever
[52:42] find fellowship and worship to God
[52:45] hallelujah so that's how vital it is now
[52:49] in order for you know we understand well
[52:52] as we read in in Hebrews chapter 12 that
[52:54] the blood of Jesus Christ speaks better
[52:58] things than that of Abel 'he's blood now
[53:01] in the book of Genesis we were and read
[53:03] it but but you read in your own Genesis
[53:05] where yo yo Genesis chapter 4 Abel
[53:09] brought her sacrifice Cain brought her
[53:12] sacrifice Cain was rejected because he
[53:15] was he was bringing the labors of his
[53:16] hands but Abel had a revelation it was
[53:19] blood in the garden so he brought a lamb
[53:21] amen and then and then Abel's sacrifice
[53:23] was accepted
[53:25] and then Cain was rejected and he and
[53:28] you know and God went and spoke Tom said
[53:30] well why don't you just do like your
[53:32] brother did and you'll be accepted
[53:33] because God gives everyone a choice
[53:35] right that you know that tries to come
[53:37] to him about God gives you about an
[53:39] opportunity but then it's up to us to
[53:41] respond to what he commands us to do if
[53:43] we'll if well humble ourselves to his
[53:44] word I mean then we we will actually
[53:47] accept what he wants to give us and so
[53:49] now and then so he was yours Carthoris
[53:51] was fallen he was angry when it talked
[53:53] with his brother Abel he killed him and
[53:55] then God comes to Cain and says the the
[53:58] voice of your the blood of your brother
[54:00] cries out to me Amen but now I okay I'm
[54:06] sorry
[54:06] Abel though he was under the blood of
[54:09] that lamb and God accepted his sacrifice
[54:11] his blood couldn't help his brother his
[54:15] blood couldn't help Cain but the blood
[54:18] of Jesus Christ
[54:19] it doesn't just cry out but it redeems
[54:22] amen he says in the token see Abel he
[54:27] was a righteous man he died he died
[54:28] innocent because he was in the way he
[54:31] was in the way standing for the real
[54:32] revelation he had he spoke it cried out
[54:35] the justice blood of Abel cried out
[54:37] against Cain but the blood of Jesus
[54:39] Christ not only cried out it redeemed it
[54:42] speaketh better things it makes you sons
[54:45] and daughters it hides you from the
[54:47] wrath of God see the blood of Abel could
[54:49] not hide Cain see but the blood of Jesus
[54:52] can Amen so all Cain come out today if
[54:55] you're a persecutor against the word and
[54:57] say days of miracles as past the thing
[54:59] is all nonsense and things it's crying
[55:01] out see the blood of Jesus Christ cries
[55:03] out but there is forgiveness in it if
[55:05] you just accept it wish we could stay a
[55:07] little while and they see the blood
[55:09] speaketh better things now we can't get
[55:12] to heaven on our own ability now this is
[55:15] probably probably a simple thought this
[55:17] morning but I just want us to appreciate
[55:19] more what we have right because if you
[55:22] really appreciate if you know is what's
[55:24] been revealed to you what you have
[55:25] you'll be resting the Christian life is
[55:28] based on rest and has finished work
[55:30] right it says in the book of Hebrews
[55:33] where there's a confirmation of an oath
[55:34] then you cease from all strife so when
[55:37] Abraham when God
[55:38] confirmed to him by Nokia's gonna give
[55:40] him the promised son then he could rest
[55:42] knowing that God will give him Isaac
[55:45] doesn't matter how long you know you
[55:47] know what but God had to do it and God
[55:51] brings us into a walk where we come to a
[55:53] point where we know it's impossible for
[55:55] it to come to pass and God wants it that
[55:58] way because of because if we think that
[56:00] we put ourselves into it and we had
[56:02] anything to do with it and our pride
[56:04] will be lifted up and who receives the
[56:05] glory not God and God will not receive
[56:08] share his glory with any person doesn't
[56:11] matter their background where they're
[56:12] from how good they think they are God
[56:14] will not share his glory with no man or
[56:16] woman right so that's why he gets us
[56:19] into places where we know it can only be
[56:21] God that we are still standing and can
[56:24] only be God we've been provided for it's
[56:26] only God that we're still walking this
[56:28] narrow way amen it's only God and this
[56:31] is why he'll be with the rapture we will
[56:33] come to recognize a ssin it was only him
[56:35] that transformed this body it was only
[56:38] him that we have faith in this day it
[56:40] was only him that we were stood the
[56:42] enemy in this hour amen and God wants us
[56:44] that way because if Abraham was the
[56:47] father of faith his children will be in
[56:49] the same manner because children take on
[56:52] the manner of the parent right so
[56:55] Abraham had a walk where it came to a
[56:58] place where it was literally absolutely
[57:00] beyond a shadow impossible they couldn't
[57:03] do it
[57:04] amen and even in God's permissive will
[57:07] gossin I don't want your permissive will
[57:09] take hey go anyway but that's not how
[57:11] it's going to be right and so if so if
[57:14] Abraham had that walk of faith so will
[57:16] the children of faith in this hour
[57:20] hallelujah amen but yes oh so that's why
[57:24] that's why we have to come to such a
[57:26] yeah and and you may may already have it
[57:29] in your soul but I won't anchor a little
[57:31] bit more it's only by being closed in
[57:34] the blood of Jesus Christ by the wedding
[57:36] garment whatever you want to call it
[57:38] it's only being his blood covering you
[57:41] that he doesn't see you no more amen and
[57:45] and and I'm going to read a quote to you
[57:47] later on but the thing is we worry about
[57:50] our humanity too
[57:51] much now I'm not giving excuse for sin
[57:54] but we look at our own own self because
[57:57] man wants to do man wants to put us
[58:00] effort in you know and in a way we
[58:03] should but in a way it's not our ability
[58:07] right grace grace and the New Testament
[58:11] is the divine influence upon the heart
[58:13] and it's reflection on the life that's
[58:15] the definition of New Testament grace so
[58:17] our ability is actually His divine
[58:20] influence upon our hearts and then the
[58:22] ability that we do is actually it just
[58:24] reflecting in our lives
[58:26] hallelujah amen so now so we have to
[58:31] come to that place where it's not us at
[58:34] all it's him and that's how you get true
[58:37] humility when you know it's him in spite
[58:40] of you he comes and lives and you can
[58:44] look back and say Lord that was you how
[58:46] I was in that situation that was you how
[58:49] I responded that person that was you
[58:51] that wasn't me that wasn't my first
[58:53] nature Lord you know I wasn't born like
[58:55] that you've changed something in me and
[58:57] that was you responding to the enemy or
[59:00] you responding to that spirit man where
[59:02] I talk about the enemy I'm not never
[59:03] talking about a person right now we do
[59:06] not fight flesh and blood this battle is
[59:09] not a flesh and blood affair that's
[59:11] against demon power spiritual wickedness
[59:12] in high places okay amen
[59:16] you know brother bramma yeah I don't
[59:18] have the quote but but okay I might get
[59:20] this wrong but I think he said to
[59:21] someone when he goes to face those three
[59:24] hunt you that Ministerial Association in
[59:27] Chicago and they're trying to trap him
[59:29] about what he believed I think he said
[59:31] to the brother who went with him now
[59:33] what's God mighty in battle and you see
[59:36] how and and and and that was recorded
[59:38] how he spoke to them he doesn't come
[59:40] across all aggressive speaks to them
[59:42] nicely you know and God took control of
[59:45] the whole situation
[59:46] he said the prophecy there was God
[59:48] mighty in battle I mean Jesus came and
[59:52] it showed it's not how man fights war is
[59:55] the wrong way how man fights is wrong
[59:58] but he showed how real man fights
[1:00:01] through humility and sweetness and being
[1:00:03] yield to
[1:00:04] the Spirit of God he conquered
[1:00:06] everything that could be conquered I
[1:00:07] mean by submitting himself to the wood
[1:00:09] allotted to him hallelujah and he's our
[1:00:12] example I mean so if he can do it we
[1:00:15] can't buy his first Amen we can
[1:00:18] absolutely do it huh that's why I'm glad
[1:00:21] you know that's not like or cannot be
[1:00:23] done it's already been done and he says
[1:00:25] children walk in my footsteps and do the
[1:00:28] same
[1:00:29] hallelujah he enables us to do so so now
[1:00:33] if we are if the blood has been applied
[1:00:36] his spirit is in you you should be the
[1:00:40] happiest person in all the world because
[1:00:43] what happens is the devil comes against
[1:00:45] us we get sick or or your mind battle
[1:00:49] comes in sometimes battles can rage for
[1:00:52] a while they meant some battles you know
[1:00:56] it medieval time between the French and
[1:00:58] English is a hundred year war it's a
[1:01:00] long time to fight right but sometimes
[1:01:03] the devil can be it can be a mom Bell
[1:01:05] but then what happens is we get sick or
[1:01:07] the devil comes and tries to attack our
[1:01:08] spirit and then what's the first thing
[1:01:10] that starts to erode away in us where am
[1:01:14] I really a believer right but the devil
[1:01:17] can brother Bram said you a person can
[1:01:20] be filled with the Holy Ghost and go
[1:01:21] insane because the Holy Ghost comes into
[1:01:25] the soul right we are sealed our souls
[1:01:27] are sealed to the day of our Redemption
[1:01:29] but then there's still the spirit realm
[1:01:31] and the body with the devil cannot get
[1:01:33] your soul he cannot get your soul he can
[1:01:37] attack you in your body or in your
[1:01:39] spirit but he can't break that seal on
[1:01:41] your soul he cannot rob that seat of
[1:01:43] election from you I mean he cannot
[1:01:45] change and he cannot alter it it's gonna
[1:01:48] stay there hallelujah we have that
[1:01:50] confidence I mean the devil cannot get
[1:01:53] your soul and that's what God is coming
[1:01:55] for hallelujah so the devil comes and he
[1:01:58] makes us sick here you're here flicks us
[1:02:00] in our minds and then we begin to walk
[1:02:02] back oh we really believe us yes we
[1:02:04] believe it I mean you got to stand there
[1:02:07] flat-footed doesn't matter what's going
[1:02:09] on in this thing hallelujah you can be
[1:02:12] turned up who's been I've been I've had
[1:02:15] a lot of moments in here I don't know
[1:02:17] which way is up or down
[1:02:18] left or right I don't even know what's
[1:02:19] going on half the time that doesn't mean
[1:02:22] I'm not a believer because eventually
[1:02:25] remember faith worketh patience I mean
[1:02:28] so so if you've got faith that will work
[1:02:30] patience that you'll know and God's
[1:02:31] timing he will deliver he will come on
[1:02:34] the battlefield he will conquer the
[1:02:35] enemy I mean so we have to just stand
[1:02:38] there saying it doesn't matter member
[1:02:40] we're not saved because we think we're
[1:02:42] safe we're saying because we believe it
[1:02:44] that's the main thing because we believe
[1:02:46] it in here that's why we're saved
[1:02:48] hallelujah
[1:02:50] you know I'm glad I'm not throwing mud
[1:02:54] on anyone but the poor Jehovah's
[1:02:56] Witnesses they believe if they forget
[1:02:57] about Jehovah they're not saved any more
[1:02:59] so if they get a yo dementia they're
[1:03:03] lost that's sad there's no rest in that
[1:03:07] kind of religion we don't have that kind
[1:03:09] of religion hallelujah
[1:03:11] cuz this thing could go but if I'm
[1:03:12] sealed here I'm going hallelujah and
[1:03:15] that's the main thing
[1:03:17] ami sorry about so if we have now we
[1:03:21] know in this day and age we can't
[1:03:24] literally get the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:03:26] because it's gone right we can't go to
[1:03:28] Jerusalem it's not preserved in here but
[1:03:30] the life that was in their blood so when
[1:03:33] Jesus died remember in the Old Testament
[1:03:35] the lamb lamb was brought by the
[1:03:37] worshiper the lamb was examined not the
[1:03:40] worshipper the worshiper wasn't even
[1:03:43] brought into account it was the lamb
[1:03:45] amen
[1:03:46] and then once the priest examined the
[1:03:48] lamb and found to be perfect then what
[1:03:50] happened then the lamb was offered and
[1:03:52] that worst record go home justified
[1:03:55] right because the lamb was accepted amen
[1:03:58] and it's the same thing with us now it's
[1:04:01] not so but then what happened was the
[1:04:04] the desire for yo that caused that
[1:04:07] worshipper to fall under sin after he
[1:04:09] gave the lamp he still had that desire
[1:04:11] because the animal life for that land
[1:04:14] will ball or whatever couldn't come and
[1:04:15] change him cuts animal life but then
[1:04:18] under but then with the blood of Jesus
[1:04:20] Christ when he died because we weren't
[1:04:22] there rival who who physically stood
[1:04:25] there on Mount Tam crucifixion and saw
[1:04:27] him die
[1:04:28] no that's 2000 years ago we were in
[1:04:31] their right
[1:04:32] but the blood was given and the life was
[1:04:35] released out of that blood and those who
[1:04:37] have truly put their accepted him as
[1:04:40] their sin sacrifice put their hands on
[1:04:42] his head accepted that he died in your
[1:04:44] place then the life that was released
[1:04:46] out of his blood comes into you right so
[1:04:49] the sin nature that you were born with
[1:04:51] is gone I mean this is not sin
[1:04:56] management this is sin eradication I
[1:04:59] mean the blood of Jesus preached Christ
[1:05:02] eradicate sin
[1:05:03] thanks away the nature of sin hallelujah
[1:05:06] that's not sin man it's not coping seven
[1:05:09] steps to cope with your sin let's know
[1:05:12] once they have to deal with it
[1:05:13] hallelujah that's how it is
[1:05:17] so so it changes us and I can say that
[1:05:23] because I've had the experience oh yeah
[1:05:27] glory to God I may not tell you well I
[1:05:31] don't want to tell you those things of
[1:05:32] God but anyway so the life comes into us
[1:05:35] the Holy Ghost was the life of God that
[1:05:37] was released out of the blood comes into
[1:05:39] you and it makes you a Christian now he
[1:05:44] says in the token 1964 the voice of the
[1:05:47] blood of abel cried out against Cain we
[1:05:49] find out Hebrews 12 24 the blood of
[1:05:51] Jesus Christ speaketh better things the
[1:05:54] blood speaks how can the chemistry speak
[1:05:56] as the life that's in the blood that
[1:05:59] does the speaking the soul that was in
[1:06:01] Cain neck I mean or enable it was the
[1:06:04] life that was in Christ that cries out
[1:06:06] bear things in any it speaks and it
[1:06:08] speaks loud it's the Holy Ghost that
[1:06:10] speaks plain it tells us that the time
[1:06:13] is here when we see it where it said
[1:06:16] that would say it and then we see it
[1:06:19] come back and identify what it said see
[1:06:21] there is nothing else left but to
[1:06:24] believe it
[1:06:25] that's right to receive it so he says
[1:06:27] it's the life that's the life of the
[1:06:30] blood comes into you how lujah and then
[1:06:34] so now he said in brother branham oh so
[1:06:37] I'll say this now so now it's our life
[1:06:39] see the blood speaks better thing so
[1:06:41] it's his life and you speaking better
[1:06:43] things I mean that's
[1:06:45] makes bitter things in your old life
[1:06:47] that's for sure
[1:06:49] amen now when God sees us when God sees
[1:06:54] a Christian covered in the blood he
[1:06:56] doesn't see the person that's us saying
[1:06:59] before we we wrestle with this guy too
[1:07:02] much but God doesn't see this guy right
[1:07:05] if you're under the blood God doesn't
[1:07:08] see you are you're following me I trust
[1:07:11] this is a bit liberating for some
[1:07:13] because we beat ourselves up a lot right
[1:07:16] we do don't we we beat ourselves down
[1:07:18] and it's just the devil taking your good
[1:07:20] intentions and beating you up with it
[1:07:22] amen
[1:07:23] but we're not called to you know but but
[1:07:26] that's not that's not our you know what
[1:07:30] do you call that's not our inheritance
[1:07:32] right we're not called to be beaten up
[1:07:34] by our own good intentions but when God
[1:07:36] sees us he doesn't see you he sees the
[1:07:39] blood of his own son now bro Abraham he
[1:07:42] has a interview with a sister Bruce now
[1:07:46] I'm just gonna read this now what hell I
[1:07:49] don't know who said it but you know
[1:07:51] someone said it this morning God and
[1:07:52] simplicity we we we make God too
[1:07:56] complicated
[1:07:57] right because the human mind needs
[1:07:59] something great but God is so great and
[1:08:03] he was shown as greatness by becoming so
[1:08:05] simple and then what happens is because
[1:08:07] God actually became so simple and we're
[1:08:10] trying to make something so great we
[1:08:13] actually stumble over what he's done and
[1:08:16] then we're trying to attain to something
[1:08:18] that we already have in many cases so we
[1:08:21] try to chase this carrot that's being
[1:08:23] dangled somewhere when actually no you
[1:08:25] already have the promise right but it's
[1:08:28] but it's always the human mind that we
[1:08:30] have not obtained right and we know that
[1:08:33] there's the fullness of adoption the
[1:08:35] change of the body but the blood of
[1:08:37] Jesus Christ makes us perfect sure we've
[1:08:39] got to mature but you look at you know
[1:08:41] you look at your when you you know the
[1:08:43] Lord Jesus spoke about the harvest you
[1:08:46] go so some wheat in the field you don't
[1:08:49] have to go tell that week every day now
[1:08:51] grow and grow and this and and and if
[1:08:55] the we could speak back you know it
[1:08:56] doesn't get up before wool but you're
[1:08:58] ever ever
[1:08:59] have a have a quick meeting before the
[1:09:01] Sun comes up now boys we've got to grow
[1:09:03] today come on you know just like sheep
[1:09:06] they don't say now okay we're gonna be
[1:09:08] in wool and we're gonna try harder they
[1:09:10] just walk around and eat grass there's a
[1:09:13] life and them that that produces wool
[1:09:16] they don't put pressure on themselves
[1:09:18] they just be sheep they walk around and
[1:09:21] eat cheap food and it produces wool
[1:09:23] right and it's the same thing with the
[1:09:26] believer if you are eating cheap food
[1:09:29] right if you're feeding on sheep food at
[1:09:32] will with the right spirit produce the
[1:09:35] fruits of the Spirit in your life that
[1:09:36] will produce a life of Christ in you
[1:09:38] amen so you know but you don't see sheep
[1:09:42] you know being all stressed okay we're
[1:09:44] going to grow this much wool in this day
[1:09:46] are we on target no we're not know that
[1:09:48] they just walk around and be sheep right
[1:09:50] and it's the same thing with us we put
[1:09:53] so much pressure on ourselves if there's
[1:09:56] a life in here right and you're not
[1:10:00] walking you're walking after the spirit
[1:10:01] or not after the flesh right it will
[1:10:04] produce itself it has to it's a life
[1:10:08] amen
[1:10:10] so now he says here I'm fixing to pray
[1:10:13] for you speak about sister Bruce I'm not
[1:10:16] worthy of that I think what would I do
[1:10:18] if Jesus Christ was sitting here I mean
[1:10:21] what would I do if Jesus Christ was
[1:10:22] sitting here and what would he do if he
[1:10:24] was sitting here he'd lay his hands upon
[1:10:26] you and with his great fancy you'd get
[1:10:28] well he says well I think well I'm a
[1:10:30] sinner I'm not him but I come to
[1:10:32] represent him but remember me being a
[1:10:35] sinner and before God I'm not a sinner
[1:10:38] neither are you
[1:10:39] we've got a blood sacrifice laying there
[1:10:42] God don't even see us he hears our voice
[1:10:45] but he sees the blood of Christ that's
[1:10:48] it see he sees the blood of his own son
[1:10:51] it's our voice Christ's blood then it's
[1:10:55] Christ that's talking through us to God
[1:10:58] so therefore we're not sinners no more
[1:11:00] we are Christian he says I believe you
[1:11:03] to be a genuine Christian woman amen and
[1:11:07] so he's saying now he says God doesn't
[1:11:09] see us
[1:11:11] we see us too much we see us God doesn't
[1:11:15] say if you're really under the blood not
[1:11:17] just not just professing it or not and
[1:11:20] in the life of God not in you and you're
[1:11:22] not just associating with it but if you
[1:11:24] really came under the word really become
[1:11:26] one with him amen
[1:11:28] then he doesn't see you you mean this
[1:11:31] guy this thing we wrestle with so much
[1:11:34] no God doesn't see you he sees the blood
[1:11:38] hallelujah does should that make you
[1:11:41] happy because we look ourselves in the
[1:11:44] mirror we get frustrated who do we get
[1:11:46] fresh we don't give well I trust you
[1:11:48] don't get frustrated with God all right
[1:11:51] we are frustrated with this guy and we
[1:11:54] beat ourselves up and sure we should be
[1:11:56] sincere we should be you know looking
[1:11:58] for your we shouldn't just like lay back
[1:11:59] and whoa if God will do it he'll do it
[1:12:01] no that's unbelief speaking because
[1:12:03] faith goes and possesses the promise
[1:12:05] right but you know we shouldn't just
[1:12:08] what are you looking at I'm looking at
[1:12:11] him
[1:12:12] now but then but then sister Bruce is
[1:12:15] but I make so many mistakes I fail so
[1:12:17] many times then brother Brown says
[1:12:18] that's why Christ had to die so that you
[1:12:21] with your mistakes wouldn't be lot of TV
[1:12:24] see he took your mistakes your desire in
[1:12:28] your heart is to serve Him who has that
[1:12:32] desire in their heart this morning that
[1:12:34] deep down the desire my heartis to serve
[1:12:36] Him see your mistakes are not a lot of
[1:12:39] to see he is your propitiation see he is
[1:12:43] your sin offering your sins are not
[1:12:45] knowing you're not a sinner before God
[1:12:47] Christ took your sins became you because
[1:12:51] your desire is to serve Him Amen sister
[1:12:55] Bruce is but I've never had an
[1:12:56] experience that I've been filled with
[1:12:58] the Holy Ghost that I could put my foot
[1:12:59] on and then brother brown replies
[1:13:01] alright now notice us ordinarily a human
[1:13:04] being is born and soon shaped in
[1:13:06] iniquity come to the world speaking lies
[1:13:08] that's the nature of a human being right
[1:13:11] that was your nature
[1:13:13] it changed once but what changed it and
[1:13:17] she says Christ and he says there it is
[1:13:20] sister see that's it
[1:13:23] seekers her desire
[1:13:24] was to serve the Lord not to serve a
[1:13:26] religion but to reserve the living word
[1:13:29] is the big difference between a religion
[1:13:32] and and and and actually being a
[1:13:34] Christian right we're not here to serve
[1:13:36] a church we're here to serve the Living
[1:13:39] Word Jesus Christ I mean this is not
[1:13:41] about this I don't you know we yeah we
[1:13:44] put a name on the front of the place
[1:13:45] because you got to have a name but
[1:13:47] doesn't mean anything really it's the
[1:13:50] word here that's that's important
[1:13:51] alright people becoming one with him
[1:13:53] right so because her heart was that she
[1:13:56] wanted to serve Him that's why he died
[1:13:58] for her that she could serve Him amen
[1:14:02] and that's and that's why he died for us
[1:14:04] that we could serve Him amen because now
[1:14:08] and and the reason that we want to sue
[1:14:10] is because his unmerited grace has been
[1:14:13] imparted to you hallelujah amen is this
[1:14:18] is enjoy a James four and six but he
[1:14:20] giveth more grace wherefore he saith God
[1:14:23] resisteth the proud but giveth grace to
[1:14:27] the humble
[1:14:28] that's why it's so important Lord I'm
[1:14:30] nothing now that doesn't mean you're a
[1:14:33] sinner when you say you're nothing you
[1:14:34] say Lord I can't do it you have to come
[1:14:36] and do it I can't live this Christian
[1:14:38] life you need to come and him and he
[1:14:41] gives you his grace imparted so that you
[1:14:43] can do it so so he has her now you had
[1:14:46] the nature of a human being born in sin
[1:14:48] shaped iniquity comes to world speaking
[1:14:50] lies you had that one time but it
[1:14:52] changed there what did it Christ and
[1:14:54] he's saying that's when you actually
[1:14:55] received the Holy Ghost when your heart
[1:14:57] was turned that all your world news
[1:14:58] actually says the Living God hallelujah
[1:15:00] but that's too simple for us sometimes
[1:15:04] we're looking for something big now we
[1:15:06] know God is not a cookie cutter so we'll
[1:15:08] have all have a different testimony but
[1:15:11] at the end of the day what should be the
[1:15:12] resolve that testimonies that I Lord
[1:15:14] your word I want to become one with your
[1:15:16] word whatever you want me to do because
[1:15:19] I love you I want to do it and return
[1:15:22] not that I will earn anything but
[1:15:25] because I want to serve me because I
[1:15:26] love you remember the whole Christian
[1:15:28] walks to be motivated by love I mean not
[1:15:31] by what you can get and not by being a
[1:15:33] man please the people will think you're
[1:15:34] something amen
[1:15:36] whoo we try to please
[1:15:39] right who's they who's the jury that
[1:15:42] gets us into heaven you know who that's
[1:15:45] the Lord you know it's not a panel of
[1:15:48] your peers and say you're worthy now he
[1:15:51] made us worthy by his blood hallelujah
[1:15:55] amen so so the Amen so we want to we
[1:16:02] need to have that point in our lives
[1:16:04] amen and that's why you see people who
[1:16:07] are really sold out they've really given
[1:16:08] their all their whole life has revolved
[1:16:11] now around their Christian walk it's not
[1:16:14] a tack on it's not something well I'll
[1:16:16] just put this in because it feels good
[1:16:17] no you're the center of your life will
[1:16:19] be him brother Brahim said about the
[1:16:22] Apostle Paul is a christ-centered life
[1:16:24] and that's why I want to have a
[1:16:26] christ-centered life not just the thing
[1:16:28] we do on a Sunday or a Wednesday or
[1:16:30] because uh you know you want other
[1:16:32] people to think with me something no at
[1:16:34] christ-centered life as everything
[1:16:35] revolves around that where we live you
[1:16:38] know you know what I mean our lifestyles
[1:16:41] you built around the word not not not
[1:16:45] the word built around our lifestyle amen
[1:16:48] you'll find it'll pay off one day I'll
[1:16:52] Lou you win these adders with change
[1:16:54] I don't yeah I probably won't say I
[1:16:56] don't know I'll probably lost words but
[1:16:58] I'll but the first thing I want to say
[1:17:00] is that was worth it and it paid off
[1:17:02] hallelujah paid the dividends that said
[1:17:04] it would hallelujah amen
[1:17:08] no he says and he says in the token he
[1:17:13] says it so now the blood of the covenant
[1:17:16] of Christ speaks better things than that
[1:17:17] of Abel see we find the blood does speak
[1:17:20] it speaks in your behalf the life that's
[1:17:24] in you speaks from the shed blood he
[1:17:26] says our brother I wish everyone could
[1:17:28] see that if we can see what it is it's
[1:17:31] the life that's in you see that the
[1:17:33] blood is identifying with with you
[1:17:36] it's the token the blood has been shed
[1:17:39] for you you're accepted and the life has
[1:17:41] come unto you you have the token that's
[1:17:44] the Holy Ghost amen that's why that's
[1:17:47] why if you're really sealed in doesn't
[1:17:50] matter what comes or goes
[1:17:52] let the devil house let Trials come let
[1:17:57] pre-tribulation time come let the world
[1:18:01] fall apart it's gonna fall apart the
[1:18:04] world is falling apart I mean even in
[1:18:07] the first world will now take knowledge
[1:18:08] you know I'll think this world is broken
[1:18:11] this world is this this country is
[1:18:14] broken amen I work in a drug testing lab
[1:18:17] drugs have destroyed this country and
[1:18:20] they will continue to destroy it the
[1:18:22] social fabric of this country's broken
[1:18:24] home life is broken every part of this
[1:18:26] country is broken and people have no
[1:18:29] answers but in the Lord we have the
[1:18:30] answer but this world has fallen apart
[1:18:34] hallelujah it has you know it's like
[1:18:37] this I won't do it but I saw a brother
[1:18:39] he took her he took a glass brother
[1:18:42] Richard do Co and he smashed it against
[1:18:44] the pulpit now it's falling apart he
[1:18:46] says the world has fallen apart like
[1:18:48] this glass turd and you think about it
[1:18:50] you can hold this much water in a in a
[1:18:52] whole glass but when it's broken all the
[1:18:55] pieces are disconnected maybe a little
[1:18:57] bit of water could be in a little bit of
[1:18:59] those pieces but it can't do what it
[1:19:00] used to do that's like this world it's
[1:19:03] broken it's all in pieces they're not
[1:19:06] connected this world has brought
[1:19:07] everything's just connected hey families
[1:19:10] are disconnected mum doesn't talk to dad
[1:19:13] dad doesn't talk to children children
[1:19:14] don't talk to each other bunch of
[1:19:15] individuals in a home what's fallen
[1:19:17] apart
[1:19:17] it's my brother Graham said about how
[1:19:19] what we should do is we should wear your
[1:19:21] the family altar should bring us
[1:19:23] together prayer should bring us together
[1:19:25] the word should bring us together that's
[1:19:28] what we should do amen I trust that's
[1:19:31] not alien birds of a feather flock
[1:19:35] together what kind of birds are we
[1:19:37] heavenly birds hallelujah maiden as
[1:19:39] image a family that prays together stays
[1:19:42] together
[1:19:44] amen because now if we have the token
[1:19:47] because at your as we you know brother
[1:19:49] Browns referring to in the Old Testament
[1:19:50] when the there was the Passover came
[1:19:53] when the Death Angel was going to strike
[1:19:54] Egypt you know the blood was a token to
[1:19:56] them that we're me when when when the
[1:19:59] angel sees the blood he'll pass over the
[1:20:01] house the death will not strike amen and
[1:20:03] we know that the token today is the holy
[1:20:05] ghost amen but if you're as saying you
[1:20:09] should you should make sure that you
[1:20:11] know him but if your heart has been
[1:20:13] turned that all you want to do is serve
[1:20:15] Him I say that's a good indication
[1:20:17] you've got it right that's a good
[1:20:20] indication because if all your affection
[1:20:21] everything you want sure we have a
[1:20:23] battle with this and we'll have a better
[1:20:25] with this until that's changed and we'll
[1:20:28] be very happy it's changed hallelujah
[1:20:31] it's not just teenagers have the battle
[1:20:33] middle-aged have the battle all the ones
[1:20:34] have the battle everyone in between has
[1:20:36] the battle because life isn't a constant
[1:20:39] change what we age we change situations
[1:20:41] change you know and the Devils try to
[1:20:44] get this try to get us off the path but
[1:20:46] that doesn't mean there's not a token on
[1:20:48] display I mean but we're going to keep
[1:20:51] this flesh as brothers eyes it was
[1:20:52] preach about the fight keep the sky
[1:20:54] subject to the Word of God
[1:20:56] amen so now so now if we have the token
[1:20:59] the Holy Ghost that means death could
[1:21:01] not strike us but we're safe hallelujah
[1:21:04] now Jobe I just want to go on to jobber
[1:21:08] because we read there from job 503 for
[1:21:11] the thing that I feared has overtaken me
[1:21:13] now brother Bram speaks very highly of
[1:21:16] Jobin as we should but I just want to
[1:21:19] point out before I go into what brother
[1:21:20] Brown speaks about him is that you see
[1:21:22] the thing that he feared happened to him
[1:21:25] so what did he fear he'd lose his
[1:21:27] children that died and everything he had
[1:21:29] would go because it happened to him but
[1:21:32] see he applied the blood he sacrificed
[1:21:35] on behalf of his family which is
[1:21:37] absolutely vital and he did but he was
[1:21:40] doing it all sake this is just me now in
[1:21:42] fellowship out of fear he was doing it
[1:21:45] out of fear he was trying to apply it he
[1:21:48] applied the blood out of fear cuz he
[1:21:50] didn't know what happened to the life
[1:21:52] hereafter right he was just you're
[1:21:55] following me so he was applying the
[1:21:57] blood he was being a believer out of
[1:22:00] fear but he was coming God's provider
[1:22:03] wasted God honored it but he was serving
[1:22:06] God out of fear because he himself did
[1:22:08] not know what happened to him when he
[1:22:10] died he didn't know where he was going
[1:22:12] he said a tree dies your comes back to
[1:22:15] life again flower nature you see death
[1:22:17] bill resurrection but
[1:22:19] and dice where does he go where does he
[1:22:21] go he didn't know he's honest it's good
[1:22:24] to be honest he didn't know and then so
[1:22:26] he was doing this out of fear but God
[1:22:29] accept it because those gods provided
[1:22:30] away so God allowed that whole trial to
[1:22:32] come upon him that now he wasn't that
[1:22:35] their God would take all the fear away
[1:22:37] isn't that a funny thing God would cause
[1:22:40] the hardest trial ever in his life to
[1:22:43] take his fear away yes and it's the same
[1:22:47] and and and I can see a few cogs turning
[1:22:50] thinking yeah that's happened to me too
[1:22:53] God allows us to go through the wringer
[1:22:55] to take fear away what's the fear of him
[1:23:01] joke was us he was afraid what's gonna
[1:23:04] happen to me he was he was standing on
[1:23:06] shifting saying because he didn't know
[1:23:07] you know he didn't know what happened in
[1:23:09] life hereafter he didn't look past the
[1:23:11] curtain of time right so he was he was
[1:23:14] worried and he applied the blood out of
[1:23:16] fear but then God allowed the trial and
[1:23:19] then after the trolly said now I know my
[1:23:22] Redeemer liveth and with these eyes I
[1:23:24] shall see him and I will stand with him
[1:23:27] amen on the earth hallelujah so then all
[1:23:31] the fear went because it went from well
[1:23:33] man dies where does he go this is now I
[1:23:34] know my redeemer lives and not just he
[1:23:37] you know but then I will stand with him
[1:23:40] on the earth I will see him with my eyes
[1:23:42] I'll see God so it took all the fear
[1:23:44] away hallelujah and God wants to take
[1:23:47] away all fear he wants he just was a so
[1:23:51] just build up confidence that we have
[1:23:53] confidence in him I mean that come what
[1:23:56] may we can just stand there say
[1:23:57] hallelujah Lord your control I'll praise
[1:24:00] you in the storm
[1:24:01] I'll give you glory in this trial
[1:24:02] hallelujah that's what he wants us to do
[1:24:08] he's applying it out of fear but yet in
[1:24:11] saying that that's he was still at least
[1:24:15] applying the blood on the behalf of his
[1:24:18] children and this is how we should be is
[1:24:21] that we should be applying the blood he
[1:24:23] said well how do you do that the faith
[1:24:25] you have for yourself you apply to them
[1:24:28] that's how you do it the same faith you
[1:24:31] have what you believe
[1:24:33] got saved whose believes in God saves
[1:24:34] there can be interactive time who
[1:24:37] believed in God saved that at work did
[1:24:40] your faith work did he change you did he
[1:24:43] transform you it wasn't someone else's
[1:24:45] God or someone else's testimony your
[1:24:47] testimony hallelujah will then use that
[1:24:49] same faith for them if it works for
[1:24:53] it'll work for them right hallelujah
[1:24:56] that's why you know little ones not well
[1:24:59] you've prayed for yourself focus on us
[1:25:02] they get healed you just apply the same
[1:25:04] faith to them don't you can you say Lord
[1:25:07] you filled this one you've done this
[1:25:09] when he hears well if you done that
[1:25:10] you'll do this you saved me you saved
[1:25:13] them Allu yeah you know that's pretty
[1:25:17] elementary it's very vital because we
[1:25:20] need to have confidence that's why we're
[1:25:22] gonna because brother Ray says apply the
[1:25:23] token and confidence not in or is it
[1:25:26] gonna work no yes it has to work it
[1:25:29] worked on me it'll work on me
[1:25:32] Allu yeah so now he sees here now God
[1:25:39] had confidence and job he fellowship
[1:25:41] with him he knew that job could I could
[1:25:44] trust him so he said alright Satan you
[1:25:46] go on he's at your hands but don't you
[1:25:49] take his life you can do anything else
[1:25:51] to him so Satan good at his office

[1:25:56] kills all the jobs children now I want
[1:25:58] you to know this a little thing Jobe had

[1:26:39] never had fellowship with Christ of a
[1:26:42] man or a woman ever has had a real
[1:26:44] divine taste of fellowship with Christ
[1:26:46] I'd rather have have it than all the
[1:26:49] vacations and things in the world
[1:26:51] there's nothing wrong with a vacation
[1:26:53] I'm gonna throw that in there okay

[1:26:57] your release because otherwise oh I'll
[1:27:00] wait for dick summer our summers gone it

[1:27:06] then if you're always looking for the
[1:27:07] next one to enjoy yourself then you it's
[1:27:09] always in the future but if you have the
[1:27:11] Lord you can have you can have greater
[1:27:13] than a nice day in the Sun hallelujah it
[1:27:16] could be it could be foggy windy raining

[1:27:45] situation he went through a lot of
[1:27:47] things oh look and he just he just with
[1:27:51] it on hey hallelujah Amy I'm glad we can
[1:27:55] do the same no um yeah sure if you want
[1:28:01] to give me a relax let me feel Christ
[1:28:03] let me talk to him a little while and my
[1:28:05] burdens roll away it's all done I'd
[1:28:07] rather talk to him than anything I know
[1:28:09] in the world have fellowship with him so
[1:28:12] God doe that job had tasted David said
[1:28:15] taste and see the Lord is good just
[1:28:17] taste after him once and see that if he
[1:28:20] isn't good it tastes like honey in the
[1:28:22] rock now the great fellowship so Satan
[1:28:24] comes down but before he comes down job
[1:28:27] said now my children is out on a party
[1:28:29] tonight I wonder if we wouldn't have
[1:28:32] more fathers and mothers like job
[1:28:34] parents said my kids are out on a party
[1:28:37] tonight they're called
[1:28:38] and some of the worldly neighbors now
[1:28:41] perhaps they might sin oh my if mother's
[1:28:44] done and and father's more of us we
[1:28:47] wouldn't have any juvenile deliquency
[1:28:49] kids wouldn't be running in the streets
[1:28:51] like they RC said now pre adventure they
[1:28:54] might sin I'm going to offer an offering
[1:28:57] for each one that if anything
[1:29:00] does happen they'll have a blood shed
[1:29:02] way to come home bye oh my I'll offer it
[1:29:06] for them so here is for John I'll offer
[1:29:09] a sacrifice God for John now if he
[1:29:12] happens to stray off the path I mean off
[1:29:14] the road down here the Holy Spirit
[1:29:16] hasn't hasn't come to lead him so if he
[1:29:19] does stray off the road Lord I'll make
[1:29:21] up him a path here oh my Mary she is
[1:29:25] down here tonight so lord if she does
[1:29:27] stray I've raised her right but if she
[1:29:30] does stray
[1:29:30] I'll make her a path in this bloodshed
[1:29:33] way back God give us some more of those
[1:29:36] old mothers at nighttime praying for
[1:29:38] their kitties like that the backbone of
[1:29:40] any nation all right I'll make them a
[1:29:42] path
[1:29:43] hallelujah if job can do it we can do it
[1:29:47] right we have to have confidence in our
[1:29:51] weapon hallelujah amen oh if we had more
[1:29:56] fathers and mothers tonight so
[1:29:58] interested in their children that would
[1:30:00] offer the shed blood of the Lamb for
[1:30:02] their child every night at the throne of
[1:30:04] grace we wouldn't have so much carrying
[1:30:06] on as we have among young folks here pre
[1:30:08] adventure they might have sinned I don't
[1:30:10] know they have but to make sure his
[1:30:13] mother's you know it's a shame today and
[1:30:15] father's how uninterested we are in our
[1:30:18] children and when I read this I just
[1:30:20] kind of pissed me in here you're showing
[1:30:22] if we're really interested in them this
[1:30:24] is what we'll be doing it's not it's not
[1:30:26] new toys new clothes new whatever new
[1:30:28] gadgets gizmos whatever more no if we're
[1:30:30] really interested in them we can't buy
[1:30:33] our kids we can't buy them you know you
[1:30:36] can't just like you know the world tries
[1:30:37] to buy other nations to be friends it
[1:30:40] doesn't work you can't buy your children
[1:30:43] amen you can't do it with with your
[1:30:46] gifts and things but if we're really
[1:30:48] interested in them this is how it will
[1:30:51] be and the little juveniles you let the
[1:30:54] kids go out just as they please running
[1:30:56] all night long and everything and come
[1:30:58] in and seem to be so unconcerned about
[1:31:00] it let your girls go out with boys that
[1:31:03] smoke and drink and do and and go to
[1:31:06] gambling and dancing like come and then
[1:31:08] you say you're Christians and such stuff
[1:31:10] as that that's not right we should take
[1:31:13] them to the
[1:31:13] Lord because the Lord doesn't just take
[1:31:16] something away and then leave a void
[1:31:19] that is legalism right because you say
[1:31:23] oh that's wrong and you ain't but you
[1:31:25] know nothing fills the void what's it
[1:31:27] gonna do it just breed resentment right
[1:31:30] but if God is there to fill that void I
[1:31:32] mean and the children taste and see that
[1:31:34] the Lord is good you know I don't know
[1:31:37] who I know who I was talking about it
[1:31:39] with but you know I never oh yeah I
[1:31:42] think it's brother Isaac I don't miss a
[1:31:44] single day of drinking I never have
[1:31:47] since the day the Lord delivered me of
[1:31:49] it right I have never ever been addicted
[1:31:52] the day from that day till now I've
[1:31:54] never had that even the smallest inkling
[1:31:56] and I used to brew the stuff all kinds
[1:31:58] of things no inkling why because I
[1:32:00] tasted another spirit I partook of
[1:32:03] another spirit hallelujah and this one
[1:32:06] is glorious and it's priesthood and it
[1:32:09] brings satisfaction I've been stayin
[1:32:11] around drunk under it
[1:32:12] Julio and I just want more and the
[1:32:15] bottle never runs empty and there's no
[1:32:18] regrets hallelujah there's no regrets
[1:32:21] whatsoever but the reason I can rejoice
[1:32:24] is because the Lord filled the void
[1:32:26] right if I just hid oh well I've got to
[1:32:29] be a good boy and I've got to stop doing
[1:32:31] this honest
[1:32:31] I wouldn't what good were they done and
[1:32:34] then what I would have started judging
[1:32:35] others who are failing but all I've done
[1:32:37] is built up a wall but they still a
[1:32:39] desire here self-control can be such a
[1:32:44] curse cuz it especially under the guise
[1:32:46] of religion all it is is just well or
[1:32:49] they do that I don't do this but
[1:32:50] secretly and he is crying out for it
[1:32:52] you know you gotta let the Lord change
[1:32:56] let the Lord do the work
[1:32:58] let the Lord deliver and then it's not a
[1:33:01] fight anymore
[1:33:02] because it's well I don't want that
[1:33:03] anymore well why it's God
[1:33:06] oh you know but that's why you got a
[1:33:11] yeah that's why I believe we've got to
[1:33:14] share the reality of God not you know
[1:33:18] that's what because people want
[1:33:19] something real they don't just want a
[1:33:22] religion the world's full of it right
[1:33:24] but the reality when God come
[1:33:28] Changez a soul when God came to you
[1:33:31] change you transformed you speaks to you
[1:33:35] walks with you
[1:33:37] heals you delivers you whatever he's
[1:33:40] done for you those things are precious
[1:33:42] and you can't work it up you can't
[1:33:45] manufacture it that's God I mean that's
[1:33:49] why it's so powerful what comes out of
[1:33:51] this mouth I mean you can speak words
[1:33:53] and heaven comes down right you can or
[1:33:57] you can speak words and hell comes up
[1:34:00] hallelujah I don't want my life to be
[1:34:03] full of this lady I see in spirit of
[1:34:05] this world right I want to live in an
[1:34:08] atmosphere and we have what we need to
[1:34:10] produce it I mean that when we walk home
[1:34:13] I mean when we step into our homes we
[1:34:16] sit around the table sitting around the
[1:34:17] couch whatever talking what happens the
[1:34:20] atmosphere begins to change God comes
[1:34:23] down
[1:34:25] hallelujah I trust you know what I'm
[1:34:27] talking about because it's the
[1:34:29] atmosphere that doesn't what kind of
[1:34:32] atmosphere do you want in your house oh
[1:34:34] but we have everything just right
[1:34:35] according to the word know what
[1:34:37] atmosphere is there we want an
[1:34:40] atmosphere of divine grace to come in
[1:34:42] and when you talk about him he always
[1:34:45] comes near when you talk about him not
[1:34:49] about maybe sure we should share confess
[1:34:52] your faults one to another track your
[1:34:54] trouble but when you talk about him
[1:34:55] who's who's gonna solve your trouble
[1:34:58] is that you talking about it necessarily
[1:35:02] maybe that's when he comes because many
[1:35:05] times he doesn't change the situation he
[1:35:08] just changes our attitude
[1:35:10] hallelujah because God you know God
[1:35:14] doesn't prove her salvation by taking
[1:35:17] the devil away oh look I redeem them
[1:35:20] hallelujah and there's nothing and you
[1:35:21] never hunt down your life there's no
[1:35:23] proof of that it's when something is
[1:35:25] tested that's when you see what it's
[1:35:27] made of
[1:35:27] I mean you can have the nicest car or
[1:35:30] whatever you want you say can do this
[1:35:32] and do this and do this and do this and
[1:35:34] it hasn't even turned on in his life
[1:35:35] well how do you know it can it's just a
[1:35:38] piece of machinery but when you see it
[1:35:40] go through its
[1:35:41] cases then you can say what what what
[1:35:43] the designer said it would do it does
[1:35:45] and it's the same thing with our Lord he
[1:35:48] said what it does right but now it's got
[1:35:53] to be tested
[1:35:54] well how does has it tested you know you
[1:35:56] put on a test suit you put on the helmet
[1:35:59] you pick up the shield and the sword the
[1:36:01] breastplate everything what do you
[1:36:03] what's happening you're gonna jump in
[1:36:04] the vehicle amen now God's going to test
[1:36:07] it and you go through trials and
[1:36:10] hardship and things because gods want to
[1:36:11] see Satan it works Satan the blood works
[1:36:16] and not only to his enemy priests
[1:36:18] actually try to tell you see did you
[1:36:20] survive that did you survive did you oh
[1:36:24] forgot just survived but overcome when
[1:36:26] the enemy came in trying to get you off
[1:36:28] the path business come in and whatever
[1:36:29] more did you overcome it father do you
[1:36:32] still have the sweetness in your life of
[1:36:34] of the Lord still rejoicing yes what's
[1:36:38] the conclusion that worked and it will
[1:36:41] work there or work here work here work
[1:36:43] here working so he wants us to have
[1:36:45] confidence I had the devil's raging he
[1:36:48] will why is the devil howling because
[1:36:52] the headship has come to the body Christ
[1:36:54] and his bride has become one that's why
[1:36:57] the devil's howling he's hitting up her
[1:36:58] schemes everything going on it's because
[1:37:00] Christ and the bride have become one and
[1:37:03] then he wants to show you it works
[1:37:06] hallelujah God wants to prove himself
[1:37:09] you say well there seems to be no light
[1:37:11] at the end of the tunnel what does his
[1:37:13] word say about it we don't I don't walk
[1:37:16] by these things Christian walk we walk
[1:37:19] by faith and not by sight faith in what

[1:38:38] purpose of the mother doing that that
[1:38:39] God would come down amen we should have
[1:38:43] we should be under expectation that when
[1:38:44] we talk to him he comes hallelujah and
[1:38:48] then when he comes everyone knows not
[1:38:50] that but the purpose members not that we
[1:38:52] would be exalted who cares about this
[1:38:56] thing
[1:38:56] who's the important one in this place
[1:38:58] him right hallelujah so that so that's
[1:39:02] the purpose of it is that God would come
[1:39:04] down Allu you and that's what we should
[1:39:08] be doing amen now I just finished so I
[1:39:14] just finished with this this is from
[1:39:16] what is the Holy Ghost he said they
[1:39:20] didn't have it in that day speaking of a
[1:39:21] circumcision under the law they just had
[1:39:23] to seal in their flesh as a token and as
[1:39:26] I am believing it was coming and they
[1:39:27] walked by the shadow of the law which
[1:39:30] they were circumcised by flesh today we
[1:39:33] don't walk by the shadow of the law we
[1:39:35] walk by the power of the Resurrection we
[1:39:38] walk by the power of the Spirit who is
[1:39:40] our true seal our true advocate our true
[1:39:43] comforter our true sign that we have
[1:39:45] been born from above peculiar odd people
[1:39:48] acting funny taking God at His Word
[1:39:50] calling everything else wrong God's Word
[1:39:53] is right oh my that's what the Holy
[1:39:55] Ghost is hallelujah now that's what we
[1:40:01] should do for instance we have a
[1:40:02] positive Tobias it's a positive token a
[1:40:04] positive token not a negative nada maybe
[1:40:08] positive a may have a possum gift of
[1:40:10] life it's a positive thing
[1:40:12] hallelujah it's real maybe a weekend
[1:40:15] rest in it we have a brother Brett yeah
[1:40:18] if you got the Holy Ghost in you the one
[1:40:21] who created the Sun Moon and stars is
[1:40:23] dwelling in huge that kind of power is
[1:40:26] in you but now he is the high priest of
[1:40:28] our profession right he will only act on
[1:40:32] your behalf when you call upon him to do
[1:40:34] so he will if you do not call upon him
[1:40:37] he can he is his hands are tied by your
[1:40:40] prayer amen so what should we do we
[1:40:43] should speak we should talk to him
[1:40:46] spent I said Lord this is my knee what
[1:40:48] are the two things that devil cuts
[1:40:50] because of the civilization we live in
[1:40:52] prayer right prayer listening and
[1:40:56] reading the word but where's our where's
[1:41:00] our lifeline prayer listening or reading
[1:41:04] to the word that's our lifeline and if
[1:41:07] we just really could fathom in our
[1:41:09] little minds the power that we have I
[1:41:11] mean the authority rather here is all
[1:41:13] the power we have the authority you got
[1:41:14] a badge of a believer just like a
[1:41:16] policeman he's got a policeman's badge
[1:41:17] the whole city's behind the policeman it
[1:41:20] could be a little bitty fellow but the
[1:41:22] whole you know police forces behind him
[1:41:24] we have the badge of believer he burns
[1:41:27] behind you heavens that God has never
[1:41:29] against us he's for us if God is for us
[1:41:32] who can be against us no not one that's
[1:41:34] for sure that's why we say well we have
[1:41:37] a positive token absolutely so we should
[1:41:40] applied in confidence that it makes the
[1:41:42] difference and any work any voices
[1:41:45] contrary to his word I would just ignore
[1:41:47] it
[1:41:47] I meant because we have a positive token
[1:41:51] hallelujah let's have the musicians
[1:41:54] please come we should apply it and fight
[1:41:57] not in fear but in faith I mean it
[1:42:02] worked for me it'll work for them
[1:42:04] hallelujah
[1:42:08] amen now my task brother Jeremy to come
[1:42:10] and help me because I still have a lot
[1:42:12] of frogs bouncing around in my throat so
[1:42:16] let's just pray let's just stand shall
[1:42:18] we and I'm going to turn the service
[1:42:20] over to - trip - brother Jeremy to lead

[1:42:32] to raise your hand to the Lord
[1:42:33] gracious father Lord we Lord us want to
[1:42:39] thank you that Lord when you see us Lord
[1:42:43] you don't see our humanity Lord you do
[1:42:46] not see our humanity that we wrestle
[1:42:48] against Lord but you see the blood of
[1:42:50] your son Lord our voice through the
[1:42:53] blood Lord we want to thank you for that
[1:42:55] father Lord and may we just walk in
[1:42:58] confidence Lord there you have
[1:43:01] everything under your control Lord may
[1:43:03] we not serve you out of fear but Lord

[1:43:08] and a strong assurance in our hearts
[1:43:09] Lord that you're more than able and we
[1:43:12] want to thank you Lord if we could just

[1:43:47] undertake in the future for us Lord and
[1:43:50] so father I just pray Lord that we would
[1:43:52] not apply the token and fear but may we
[1:43:57] apply it in faith in confidence
[1:44:00] believing and knowing that it makes a
[1:44:02] difference
[1:44:02] Lord us think of the Prophet Lord when

[1:44:08] Lord Lord and he put on an apron he
[1:44:10] tried to help his wife cook and his just
[1:44:12] praying in his heart the whole time Lord
[1:44:14] send your Holy Ghost into her heart Lord
[1:44:16] and change the atmosphere Mason
[1:44:18] you said lowdown as as he was talking to
[1:44:21] her about different things about dresses
[1:44:23] and things and Lord you change the
[1:44:25] atmosphere in his home father because he
[1:44:27] put us faith into action that way lord
[1:44:30] help us to do the same Lord that we
[1:44:32] don't have to live in a troubled with a
[1:44:34] troubled spirit Lord in a troubled
[1:44:36] stressed atmosphere but father Lord you
[1:44:39] said that perfect love casts out all
[1:44:41] fear
[1:44:41] Lord Jesus Lord and that you give us
[1:44:44] peace not as the world goes but as you
[1:44:45] give so father I pray Lord just Lord

[1:44:52] Lord that we would dwell in that Lord
[1:44:53] doesn't matter what's going on around us
[1:44:55] but father may we'll be dwelling in
[1:44:58] perfect peace knowing that you're in
[1:45:00] control of every situation
