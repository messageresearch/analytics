maybe you're not a singer you're not a preacher you're not they said that but God sees your secret chamber no problem said that what of reason why he had the goodness between his ministry is if the sister that's brain nobody sees her God sees a man so everything you are doing for the Lord you did dedication your people your stuff for the Lord you are a beauty to this generation and then so so keep keep keep on with good job tonight I believe we are still basking on the blessing of the of its emitting that Allah cannot be the same amen outsets I put my hand on the plug laundry came back man praise the Lord and thank God for the ministry here that can be finding meetings the Wednesday just of the meeting came up I could see it something in you know the the Holy Ghost like enough you could refer yourself you try to get us to get connected because once we get to that channel you will never let you leave want to leave it to me and then I can see the windows cry out go to the angel go take the book I mean so you have the tapes you have the baby with the the Bible you have the books is for you to go and not your brother your sister go and take the book it if we stripped in your mouth yeah but in the belly they do bitter and make a prophesy you know the bitterness is the tryouts Chris alone and so when you are going to the trial instead of good having a clean self pity party oh no I mean no wine is then you just speak the world like Moses cement Moses on that day amen here was there we ever see Moses was only on the duty line or doing in obedience but trouble came between the ocean between the Red Sea and behind them was he angry am your Pharaoh yeah let me to kill them as one man in one day and see if you chose the choices army together didn't know that's the great a general then the general email my team was switching one of the message that we should recognize who is in amen and then you will not be devil's football to teach you here into here to here no you say no Satan it may this is my place the word Amen Alleluia and then the world is in lockdown there's a Lord when I walk into the hospital and actually cannot smile laughs and they closed all the doors are sealed their cruises do against some that angels anything but anyway so but God is our protection remain that's what I say now the world is in lockdown but but we are we are locked in with Jesus and joy the power strength to make it through the new year no with the dull and sober burns said that we should be so on fire for God yes you should you should be going day and night nothing should be able to stop us amen and we should be so sweet and so present and so kind and so crestlake no lives and he takes every day life been like the world remembers Christ's resurrection was in a year but for the believer [Applause] Hospital blessings amen and so if that be the case he should be I was talking about thinking I was singing and one works amen he should be the prism of our life if he is the principle of the Bible and the bubbles in you then he should be the principal theme of everything that you do mine so when we were so predicted yeah the channel opens the pipeline gets on plot is we move freely he made a promise and he will come and fulfill the promise we have to make us available to him to him and we have to will increase God will look beyond our ability or inability our strength our witness is view to him and so what we are so yielded to him at all times what is ready or this the sun is shining I saw a bloom and that look at what I've said here impact on vision isn't it beautiful we can really encode your soul in price a man in such a place till you can get quiet before him and hear his voice speaking to you i am the lord the hillary hallelujah young good lord that give it its inner life I love thee I am no day before the freshman world man I put the name upon the book thou art mine yet not it's me don't be afraid I am with you so say Amen hallelujah so when we get to his presence we we will need to get in the spirit led tonight amen in the spirit of the worship and praise and fellowship amen and it's always saying and now we can be able to get on that great expectation for the supernatural yes I believe tonight and if it can happen that if you are sick you can be healed I believe that if we need the Holy Ghost you can be filled because in life my mind lies my face twice right but God does not like if I take the sword I cut off everything else and let him come then tonight can anyone hear somebody say Amen so we meet above everything else with a revelation from God yeah I mean we said now so he said to Peter I will tell in the hood would you say two men sit at the hem is it all this awesomeness true say you are this your ledger you are this or that and it won't again be disciples like tonight yeah who do you yeah hey this message is yeah Peter say that what Christ instead of living God you mind your intellectual your power of thinking did it help you that I would need that a man would talk with you turn into receive nothing he made so I believe is here tonight to give you a question right shall we shall we turn to these pictures tonight and I want to pray upon the scripture and they will sit down because I'm good at carpentry as I read the scriptures Heavenly Father we just about to open your word Lord but an 18-man that it reads alright can open the Bible and read yeah but to let me you the offer come down low and I'm not into a house of God watch also Cindy please father a meters at the point of a meet incredible pray I mean so I have tonight study if you had a mecca for school and church of the thirteen was eight to twelve and then first John 3 to the 3 and in first John 4:17 and lastly fourth graders to 9 to 10 so a little starts you may be seated maybe sit there let let's start from first Corinthians chapter 13 8 to 12 may be seated you got you got it ok alright so I read charity never fail it but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away when I was a child as big as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things verse 12 for now we seek true at that glass darkly so it was true true true a glass darkly but then face to face now I know in part but then shall I know even as also I am known please alone that was 12 says if we go back in time where pork preaches he said now we see through a glass right so Paul at that point was saying this is where we are Marama said that that this this messengers did not live long a love to this day of course you know and that's that's what it should be not enough to this day so we we a nanny said but then face to face so we we are now we are moved on from that now then to now here so things have changed so we are no longer seen in true that glass right okay and everybody said but then we will see for surface right so the dead is now hallelujah face and see what I'm trying to say is it now I know impart what they should I know even as I am known so so we have moved on so we are now in the bed with the Lord so but then so we are not you depend well then should I know he would have known so we are moving to to now now is a day so now we are knowing as as as we know as as he knows us as as we are known to know as we are known okay let us move on to first John chapter 3 verse 2 looking at my time first chargeable to 3 so it first talked about 3 verses 2 and 3 John I forgot it okay beloved now are we the sons of God not tomorrow appear what we shall be but we know we know that when he shall appear we shall see which shall be like him we shall see him as he weeks now as the church a question tonight has he appeared what happened that is the 3 February hallelujah it wasn't a believer that took the picture to make a point know who it was scientists and um and here was it in speech instructor professor Tom tone the picture right there was his face hallelujah glory to God so we have seen him I mean he has appeared and said and shall be and we shall be like him and what do you see how for we foucha same as here so we have seen as his verse 3 and every manner had this hope in him purifies himself even as he is pure first John chapter 4 verse 17 herein is faulted for just the next chapter you got it first okay I read he release all of meat that we may be that you may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world tonight as he gives praise God can you imagine that as he is so are we I think less Sunday's been back inspiration make some demonstration got a big job water and they pour a little bit in a glass that water in that glass had the same chemical composition as the one in the main in the main difficulty of this portion and get a drop of water I mean what's the difference this was a liar that comes to mollify you are not it would be you are you did this you did that now let me tell you he is permitted to do that is his job because doctors Butterfield is the mind amen that is why you showing you who you are able to draw your sword and chop me left and right and you seem wrong when you take your stem with the word what God says you are to be church members to be to be to to have with your spirit or Billy Joe's know he's beautiful songs and those of God Psalm tonight amen tonight so as he is so are we Chris alone in this world in this world we're not going to heaven yet right so I by his spirit what does this one mean and nothing hallelujah guru to blow when you see somebody boasting on his riches or treatment you only only operate on this level whether him go has by spirituals the main thing he meant for his research at all things here the ditches of God his alone so tonight my tattoo tonight is that which is perfect is come for subject now we know as we are known guessing we have Matthew funny hallelujah so when the food is prepared is a quid pro comes and reduce himself to you as an individual you'll see him clearly face to face it is then only then that you will know as you are known oh praise God hallelujah and so and so so that pretty spanner who is him the divine love and proceed weirdest tongue it will cease weirdest knowledge it will vanish where does faith it will fill all this is fulfill but when that which is prophets come he says which is love divine love amen and the Sunna say God is long I'm the one who lives in God you see him and go live see him hallelujah Chris a lot so I noted tonight that's where we are and he said and again he said that Critias puppet is the word in food so it is to put into context and what I said that means from it is come we know what we're doing we are where we are and what is what has come to us is it is the first of the world and somebody asks problem in question answer he says please explain first for internship director chambers it will lead to 212 and and the question was now that now that the puppet world is restored to the church the church and these verses fulfilled if you look at that question that's what that brought us aside the question by him or herself yes he says now that now that the world is restored so what else is who s is the word but God love I mean I mean I'm they if you read out there he said he said now I think I just went to that the entire and when the authorities has come that which is in part shall be done away with Paul said though I speak with tongues of men and angels and do I speak these things but when the authorities come now it's easier anything of it but God see actually tell you by asking question no easy no sunset is perfect yes the beginning was I'm the Commission said the word Amen hallelujah and the word was with god and the word and the word was god amen and what is to God praise the Lord how are we doing so they said in the Oval of God therefore after him the fullness we cannot point to something else it points back to him the word unbound P the Bible just like what men did last Sunday P the Bible that same before next year present Lord it says this is the complete revelation a man nothing can be added or taken from each there is a compilation all that they should offer him to come but when he came he was perfect so that which is forbid us come amen who the Lord so he said how how did he accomplish in our day so the the perfect one was made known to us when as we all know when the several super convention was open and he said in his reunion now notice but but at the opener with seven seals relation chain before word is been born into manifestation again and vindicated by the Spirit of God your full strength it was when it was when he was here on it so it was strength as it was when he was here on earth manifested in the same way doing the same things that he did when it was here own if it was a gross amen and so on he said moving on he said in the answer say that we have today Amanda by the help of God the perfect interpretation of the word with divine vindication do you see where you have resistance amazing by the grace of God we have a prophet in the pressure of the world of the work with divine vindication so why is he coming why is he here and what is he doing right now as we talk amen he's here to gather the bride amen I will say here remember in what time is it sir he says then we've got the revelation in these last days for the message of the Lord to go gather his bride no other age has it been promised in swamis in this age mark I for look something 30 days like an egg when the Son of Man is revealed what is it God very in flesh you are so and so you came from Tucson so I lost me before for your enemies this was a problem no men that was price Alleluia oh man he said this draw of John 14:12 jewel to that eight these promises are just exactly like John the Baptist and they define himself instance in Scripture and so why are we here tonight I think it was a brother Zeke were talking about you know how we all came God taught us you know in his own way if I should if we should tell our testimonies it will all be mind-blowing how God called you and Isaac's testimony amen can you imagine this the same book was near rubbish I was supposed to be thrown away hallelujah praise God who let him there yeah who made you know what's the circumstance uh he was a tree in a church where there was supposedly supernatural manifestation so it's not just from the tournament my position because Pentecostals can heal the sick raise the dead Chris a lot go do what denied the word praise the Lord he will turn them about Godhead they say forget about it you are trying to spit here I remember when we were in medical school when I got the message then I knew that I can help anybody I have to run my own race praise Allah so dust of God is you and if you are blowing this message it is not a mistake I mean God put them to be Buddhist majority we hear this word and receive it alone so and then use the history of the ego and the eaglet to tap him so he let X the eaglets the ego literally takes and then and there's somebody pitch it and put under the head or something I've done I've got hushed and here was it with a glare would be with the chickens with a new cheeks they were all you know come out picking on the ground equal to stop men to pick some edges around the goose is meant to fly in the air Amen somebody say Amen we are supposed to fly into the heavenly places and Savior and be blessed but every switch our blessing a man in your life amen there was no right to oppress you to suppress you right to make you sad I make you afraid you made he has right to try you but you got to know your right to say to take the sword of the word and chopping down by taking the promise somebody say Amen so when the motor it will give a scream scream and then the other other the chicken they went to cover oh my this is a Rondo trainer like the truth but as it is see here I see all right and they rather cover but something about his voice yeah you know sympathy in me amazing reason watching with that voice mama have known from before and say you got those egos okay you put those two wings him in the old and new Testament you'll floppy the man was too floppy job open air remain in obedience she went with her mother mmm self to his bride yes he's opened the world to her and removing hospira amnezia image where we were born for God we are sons of God we're talking here like other boys were there girls we weren't we'd already wet we do what I did but if you remember something you get settled you know along with the pierre-pierre presence and so forth amen auntie we had a voice so he's opening that word to her room has spiritual amnesia to bring her to full realization of who she is amen she we know as she's known and when she got to do full magician so we are not certainly for just intellectual yeah concept of the message yes we receive it first what our trainer our prep will press delete' where to go from here to here amen the Lord said job wouldn't trade at that day I can I say this day with the Lord you shall know that I am in the father and you in me and I in you why because as he is so we are a myth on this this alone so he said in the spoken word now what Hammond II Jesus never did anything until sin of the father or the father showed him first harmony between God and Christ John 5:19 sure with the bride here the bread which mm there he may put your name there hallelujah so with the bride and his shoes ha is weird of life he knows her he shows her and she receives it she never does it nothing can harm her not even death someone say Amen Brahm said that death cannot have a believer it will only change your place of abode from this first house that country with disease and everything to that my father's house no sorrow no pain no sickness no pressure no tear the world we're here on that the or on the Audis but death if God would did not wish to live here by BATS means yes but we do only going to check our our our decision from this dimension through the no dimension and we've said in teaser a to P instead go for death I'm just gonna first on that because the devil can use that to to frightening somebody but if you know who you are behind me do you risk Oh amen he said I want to be there when I come there a man a robe this righteousness that you will be on the other side - welcome hallelujah you don't wonder when did God Paul they're shorting this grave if you don't recount if you don't if you don't give up on this this is gonna be where you end up I can imagine let's take a trip to that day and so Paul instead of being syrup for my good for the Lord and you know maybe end up here nobody showed up and looked at the brief Oh grave where is your victory amen for this sting of sin is death and the strength of sin is the law but thank God we won victory to our know Jesus Christ amen so I'm going to read for in DC be planted the water who raised up amen we raised up again then I got a great big hallelujah he has a secret the word is the bride and the mind of Christ to know what he wants wrong with the word she does it in in his name she has toast the Lord then it is Jamie tries so the Holy Spirit waters it onto the ground and surf's is bubbles that's what we need the Holy Spirit because he is a strength of it all day the he just rented the veggies praise God hallelujah oh my so the next few slides will show us what he said the word says that we are amen yes we shall know how as we are known now I will show service of God indeed as he is so are we or death and the spirit what eyes at the scene and ears cannot hear I don't hate this pretty story we will read to us it gives it teams of God amen but God to the profit but good turn to the two to the backside of course mine wife on the new year is gone so do you look at not tonight okay let's go so I believe brain Phoebus this this point last time he says men and bread and men are women it's time that we found out who you are Amy oh god help us tonight Amy because it's not just I'm satisfied in knowing that yes this is what I want to get me here I want to be real praise God but most of the pop the Holy Ghost all right so he said men are women is stand up we found out who we are did they was trying to hide you back tell you that you add so many to throw down something can you imagine that down doubt road in you know having pity party oh why me you are not we are sons and daughters of God and being a soul and daughter you have the right to go to the angel and take the promise I mean the problem say that that is loss you repent and people said they left Christ and if you the Holy Ghost that God gives you a blank check Alleluia so you feel what you want because the bank of heaven cannot cannot run dry the deity is not in heaven it is in you this is me Alleluia so then by the word noble feeling yeah because sometimes make up any morning you feel like whoa you wouldn't feel like you're actually your back end of a church in your life so so so we don't believe filling in audio files and substance of the flesh you you see you smell it is you hear you feel and the fastest is only spirit you machen you Racine affectional causes of memory and all those things but when you have when you take the word the Spirit is super sign you so much sense and you put this these stem cells or the under control jeonhwa amen they will go run away from you amen and he said here amen since caught every upset from from human beings that they might be connected mmm Brandi could naturally in the Garden of Eden praise God amen amen to that stream that neuron dry amen hallelujah who created I really like him and I'm going to choke you but I'm going to say it's a man is so many potent praise God you don't believe that you don't believe that is asking but he is known this is the catch a man full subscribe to God in so many potent because know him the man is God in him in our day he is charity the develop in us amen hallelujah so a man frustrated or son important did not eat say okay when I met food at McClellan for the law so we are right with it now and so we are you sons of God unless of God before there was there even was a moon star or molecule praise God hallelujah you we are so sometimes of God but you are only the physical manifestation of attributes now was in God amen at the beginning for this only one form of eternal and that was you before amen you don't know nothing about it neither did you know when you when you win your first le father but you have manifested in this image in the image of God you are made and you are manifested for the glory and fellowship of God and welcome to say and therefore as sure as your gene had to be in your father before you let your birth your spiritual Jane had to be in God because you are an expression of attribute of these thoughts somebody say Amen the function of the world right no way around it that's right now you know we notice then that that life been in you God's life meeting you for the confront of the world amen so then that if you ain't God a gene the word attribute on the cuff of the beginning from the beginning then you work the same here on earth now listen to this you work with him on earth you suffer with him on earth you die with him at the cross and you rose with him again and now praise God you are sitting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus do you what familiar within the word as he fits into your soul month only by live by every word that proceedeth praise God so that's where we are we have come from Mato beans on term beans to eternal beings amen so we are not just 10 beats we're eating Arby's I believe one of the pictures terrific the Commission say that we are here getting ready for the next is the next line in S phase which is eternity so let's not be too stand flat-footed let's be on our toes and then subscribe for Jesus is here so we do not beans when the word of God leads our souls and we become sons of God with attributes the gene of God in us to be songs and also of the Father God in heaven crying Abba Father praise God okay so this slide says just that's your name in the book of life the book of life is the word of God cuz the word is God and God is only thing that's life so your name was represented in the Bible before the battle became a world war actually have a representation by priest nation part of him a tort in Elohim and he is seen in the New Gods but possible feel funny come on this F in this crash that can fail me and be tempted so God sees it it knows it all but he has already made a way whereby before I begin I'm white I'm going I'm wanting them now now there now the first of the word is come and the first or trying to form the bride into it word image amen bringing us to the adoption body change resurrection in the rapture and I see builds the servant or egg
