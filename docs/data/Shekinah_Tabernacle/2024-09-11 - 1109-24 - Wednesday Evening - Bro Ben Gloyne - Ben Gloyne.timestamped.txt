[14:48] in reminding you of all your failures
[14:53] and long forgotten
[14:57] sin you know within your heart God's
[15:01] blood has washed you wide as
[15:05] snow still in your mind the battle rages
[15:10] and threatens all you
[15:14] know but even if you're pushed Beyond
[15:19] where you feel you can

[16:48] chance now you don't have to listen to
[16:52] that voice says you're not

[27:01] and the lusts of our flesh fulfilling
[27:03] the desires of the Flesh and of the mind
[27:05] and were by Nature the children of Wrath

[28:20] God bless you friends you can have your
[28:21] seats tonight so I want to talk about
[28:24] this here as we go into prayer I want to
[28:26] talk about uh defeating the prince of
[28:29] the power of the air and that and that
[28:32] word air means
[28:34] atmosphere now we understand that the
[28:37] devil brings storms you know he's the
[28:38] one who brings hurricanes and Cyclones
[28:40] and all these things he's because uh
[28:43] when when when Adam fell from his
[28:44] position the devil took his position and
[28:47] he has dominion over nature but he also
[28:51] wants to ruin your atmosphere I mean
[28:53] he's not just content with sending
[28:54] hurricanes and Cyclones and typhoons and
[28:57] storms and whatever it may be blizzards
[28:59] and and you know floods and all those
[29:01] things but he wants to he wants to ruin
[29:03] your atmosphere he doesn't want us to
[29:05] have a good atmosphere who like no one
[29:06] likes a a bad storm I was going to say a
[29:09] good storm there's no such thing as a
[29:10] good storm no one loves a you know
[29:13] watching all of their household goods
[29:14] and their houses being blown away by a
[29:16] hurricane or being Swept Away by a
[29:18] tsunami no one enjoys that and so the
[29:21] devil wants to do that in the spiritual
[29:22] not just the natural but we have
[29:24] authority over him in the name of Jesus
[29:26] Christ now now the devil he so what he
[29:29] does is we know that uh we we are we are
[29:32] atmosphere generators right amen amen if
[29:34] you want to create a good atmosphere you
[29:36] speak good things right if you want to
[29:38] create a bad atmosphere do the opposite
[29:41] you'll create an atmosphere either way
[29:42] that's right amen nothing you do will be
[29:45] neutral am mean it will it will it will
[29:46] create a result and um the devil wants
[29:50] us to create a bad atmosphere he wants
[29:51] us to agree with him and then he will
[29:53] have his way so you know he wants us to
[29:56] have an atmosphere of being moody and
[29:58] gloomy and down and desponded and
[29:59] depressed and he puts those thoughts in
[30:02] our mind and he wants us to dwell on
[30:04] those thoughts wants us to welcome them
[30:05] and and Ponder on them and meditate upon
[30:08] them and and the more we do the gloomier
[30:10] it gets the more the Wind Blows the more
[30:12] the dark clouds seem to come down the
[30:14] fog comes and you know just seem such a
[30:16] terrible kind of a no one likes Gloom me
[30:19] are you all Sunshine people yeah praise
[30:22] God I'm me Hallelujah hello choir good
[30:25] to talk to you amen yeah preaching to
[30:28] the Cho everyone loves Sunshine right
[30:29] the devil hates Sunshine amen so he
[30:32] wants us to be gloomy down and
[30:33] despondent but we have authority by the
[30:36] by the power of God's word to cast him
[30:39] out amen and we have discernment to
[30:42] recognize it's not us that makes the
[30:44] gloomy atmosphere it's not our family
[30:47] members not our work colleagues not our
[30:48] schoolmates it's the devil causing them
[30:52] am mean but you but you have the ability
[30:54] to stop it affecting you see see the see
[30:57] it's got to stop somewhere why not with
[30:59] you amen why not be that seaw wall why
[31:01] not be that thing that you know sends
[31:03] the storm away like Jesus stood on the
[31:06] bow of the boat none of the other
[31:07] disciples did it but Jesus did himself
[31:10] proving he was the god of creation
[31:11] saying peace be still and he doesn't
[31:13] just want to speak peace to Natural
[31:15] storms he wants to speak peace to
[31:17] spiritual storms amen but the thing is
[31:21] he uses your body to do it that's right
[31:24] right he uses your body to do it so
[31:26] whose lips are we going to use he's
[31:27] going to use your lips amen you have the
[31:30] authority to do it amen amen because
[31:33] remember this is the devil's job the
[31:35] thief cometh not but to steal and to
[31:37] kill and to destroy that's what that's
[31:40] what his job is to do see anything that
[31:42] steals your joy steals your faith steals
[31:46] your hope or your expectation the Lord's
[31:48] going to do something steals your long
[31:50] range Vision that God's going to bring
[31:52] everything for his good that's the thief
[31:55] right he wants to Blind us over he wants
[31:56] to make us look at the situ situations
[31:58] look at the trouble look at all those
[31:59] things so he's stealing
[32:02] amen the Deliverance that God has for
[32:05] you and he wants to steal your Victory
[32:07] but that's not the end of the verse but
[32:09] I am come that you might have life and
[32:12] you might have it more abundantly amen
[32:14] so the Lord has come to give us Abundant
[32:16] Life the devil wants to take life but
[32:18] God wants to give us Abundant Life joy
[32:20] in the Holy Ghost amen the power of God
[32:22] on display a piece that passes all
[32:24] understanding because you realize when
[32:26] that storm was around Jesus the storm
[32:28] wasn't in Jesus right the storm can be
[32:31] all around you you can say no that's not
[32:33] that person that's not me it doesn't
[32:34] belong to me I'm not putting up with
[32:36] this thing amen amen you have the
[32:39] authority to do it because remember we
[32:41] have been see Heavenly plac in Christ
[32:45] Jesus is our position in Christ we're
[32:47] joint ear with Christ and he has a name
[32:49] above all names amen he's so lifted up
[32:52] so high he's going to look way down just
[32:54] to see Heaven he has a position far
[32:56] above all things and we're joining is
[32:58] with him right so and Heath raised us up
[33:00] together and made us sit together in
[33:02] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that
[33:04] means he's caused you to have a position
[33:05] above the devil amen that means he's
[33:07] caused you to have authority over every
[33:09] enemy absolutely and it's not you that
[33:11] gets there he's made you get there amen
[33:14] amen thank you Lord praise the Lord so
[33:17] now but see the devil wants us to have
[33:20] storms of anxiousness this is a very
[33:22] anxious age we live in everyone gets
[33:24] stressed about something why do we have
[33:27] to be stressed
[33:29] it doesn't mean the trouble goes away
[33:31] but why do we have to be worried about
[33:32] it we have one greater than the trouble
[33:35] amen like it says in Philippians rejoice
[33:36] in the Lord all way and again I say
[33:38] rejoice that's a good that's a good key
[33:40] to get rid of Gloom rejoice in the lord
[33:44] well I've got to feel like rejoicing no
[33:45] you just start rejoicing you start
[33:47] remembering his promises start
[33:48] remembering what he did for you you may
[33:50] feel as dead as a post that doesn't
[33:52] matter cuz when to go into it we don't
[33:54] walk by feelings the world is very much
[33:56] walking by feelings there a presidential
[33:58] campaign at the moment going on and it's
[33:59] all the
[34:00] vibe she's trying to win the White House
[34:03] by Vibe she's trying to get the most
[34:05] powerful position on the Earth by A vibe
[34:08] we don't live by Vibe we don't go by
[34:10] we're just vibing it see how it goes no
[34:12] we walk by faith and not by
[34:14] Vibe okay bringing in today hash not
[34:18] Vibe the Rapture is not going to be by
[34:20] Vibe okay I just don't feel the vibe
[34:23] well you forget what what is that anyway
[34:28] let's not even go there but you know we
[34:29] don't walk by that we walk by faith a
[34:32] revelation amen so so you know like Paul
[34:34] and Silas they're in a jail a jail
[34:37] especially in those days was not
[34:39] underfloor heating three meals a day
[34:42] kind of deal we have today a a bed no
[34:45] rats no mice no no you know dry sanitary
[34:50] it's that wasn't the jail they were in
[34:53] so they could have either let the
[34:54] atmosphere of the jail and the
[34:55] atmosphere of the beatings they had in
[34:57] their body body and the pain and the
[34:59] rejection they just experienced they
[35:01] could let that rule their atmosphere but
[35:03] they they chose no actually God's
[35:06] allowed Us in this dungeon why I don't
[35:09] know but we're going to praise God
[35:10] anyway and they began to testify and
[35:13] praise God and sing and it says about
[35:15] midnight you know then they sang and
[35:17] presence of God came down and broke
[35:19] broke that place open yeah why because
[35:21] they decided not to go by the vibe of
[35:23] the jail amen they went to they're
[35:25] walking by Revelation amen amen so I say
[35:28] you don't have to feel Rejoice F however
[35:31] that is feel happy to Rejoice he says
[35:34] rejoice in the lord always way and again
[35:35] I say rejoice let your moderation be
[35:37] known unto all men the Lord is at hand
[35:39] be careful and that word careful
[35:41] actually means anxious be anxious for
[35:43] nothing but in everything by prayer and
[35:45] supplication with Thanksgiving let your
[35:48] request be made known unto God so by
[35:51] prayer and supplication that's asking
[35:52] but with Thanksgiving hallelujah how
[35:55] thankful are our prayers our prayer
[35:57] should be I think incredibly thankful
[35:59] amen hallelujah thank you well you so I
[36:01] don't know how to pray start thanking
[36:03] God for what he's done for you and by
[36:05] the time you've got through half of that
[36:06] I think you'll be feeling a little bit
[36:07] happy I think you'll be rejoicing amen
[36:10] who's ever experienced that you're down
[36:11] in the dumps and then you begin to thank
[36:13] God for what he's done and then you
[36:15] start to thank for what he's done in
[36:16] your life and that Gloom has just pushed
[36:19] out the window and you're having a
[36:20] jubilee because why being thankful and
[36:23] rejoicing brings the promises alive see
[36:26] the devil wants to steal it from you but
[36:27] it brings the promises in close Lord
[36:30] amen hallelujah praise God so don't be
[36:33] anxious for it see anxiousness does not
[36:35] help
[36:37] anyone even brother Braham said you know
[36:39] if he knew he was going to get shot in
[36:40] the morning what good would do to worry
[36:42] about
[36:43] it he said that but believing faith can
[36:47] deliver worrying has not helped anyone
[36:51] amen and the peace of God so so if you
[36:54] make your request if see everything so
[36:56] don't be anxious about it
[36:58] but give it to the Lord in prayer and
[36:59] supplicate with s uh and supplication
[37:02] with Thanksgiving make your request
[37:04] known to God so don't hold it in let it
[37:06] out right if you're anxious it's all
[37:08] bouncing around in here but when you've
[37:09] given it to God it ain't bouncing in
[37:11] here anymore it's at his throne right
[37:13] and then if you do that then the peace
[37:15] of God which passes all understanding
[37:18] shall keep your heart and mind through
[37:19] Christ Jesus so if you do that then your
[37:22] emotions are going to be kept by Jesus
[37:24] Christ amen that's a good one to be the
[37:27] Upp and Downer in life right amen he
[37:30] says finally Brethren whatsoever things
[37:32] are true whatsoever things are honest
[37:33] whatsoever things are just whatsoever
[37:35] things are pure whatsoever things are
[37:37] lovely whatsoever things are of a good
[37:38] report if there be any virtue and if
[37:40] there be any praise think on these
[37:42] things that's going to get the Gloom
[37:44] away amen because remember we don't walk
[37:46] by
[37:48] feeling right the Apostle Paul would say
[37:50] that he doesn't run uncertainly but he
[37:53] runs certainly and he fights you know I
[37:56] therefore so run not as uncertainly so
[37:59] not just a stab in the dark hit and miss
[38:01] kind of a deal he's running with with uh
[38:04] determination but with purpose right and
[38:07] so he fights not as one that beateth the
[38:09] air so someone who's beating the ear is
[38:12] basically shooting the breeze just let's
[38:14] just fire a shot and see what happens no
[38:16] that's not how the Apostle Paul says he
[38:17] walks a Christian walk right he does it
[38:20] with purpose and so that one that
[38:22] beateth the ear as if you're trying to
[38:24] go by emotion amen you see a lot of
[38:27] people that try and work themselves up
[38:28] into Faith they think it takes an
[38:31] emotional St step ladder to get into
[38:33] Faith but no faith is choosing to take
[38:36] God at his word amen that's what see
[38:39] Faith starts with a choice do you choose
[38:41] to believe the promise or do you not
[38:43] right faith says I choose to believe
[38:45] that I choose to believe God is able to
[38:47] do it Lord amen that's how Faith starts
[38:50] right then of course it becomes a
[38:51] revelation but you've got to choose to
[38:53] accept it first I need a big Thunderbolt
[38:56] choose to accept it first I need the
[38:58] fire of God to move choose to accept it
[39:00] first why do you think you know God
[39:02] moves in church cuz we choose to accept
[39:04] he's the god of Revival he we choose to
[39:07] accept he's the same yesterday today and
[39:08] forever we have chosen to accept that
[39:10] he's the same God in the prophet's
[39:12] Ministry is the same today we've chosen
[39:14] to accept that right and it's become
[39:16] Faith it's become reality but first we
[39:18] had to choose to accept it hallelujah
[39:21] amen so we don't we don't work ourselves
[39:23] up into something because you're just
[39:25] beating the a there the prophet being
[39:28] here that's just that's just beating the
[39:29] air so that's fighting un uh you not
[39:32] being certain but we want to walk
[39:34] certainly that's right with purpose
[39:36] right we don't want to do stab in the
[39:38] dark hit Miss no we're not here the
[39:39] message did not come for us to try
[39:41] something and see what happens no we're
[39:43] walking because we've seen the light
[39:45] shine we see his promises are true and
[39:48] we and we've seen him perform them have
[39:50] we not yes that's why we walk this walk
[39:53] that's and we know the message reveals
[39:54] Jesus Christ in the scripture we know it
[39:57] it's a certain sound so we're not
[39:59] fighting the air right uh trust
[40:01] everyone's here today amen see we don't
[40:04] let me just read this now it's not just
[40:05] something that you kindly push yourself
[40:07] to I've noticed so much that in my
[40:09] meetings that people try and work
[40:10] themselves up into something just to
[40:12] make them believe now you can't do that
[40:15] you're just beating the air but faith is
[40:16] something that's just as calm and
[40:18] settled as it can be remember feelings
[40:21] is not Faith but faith will bring
[40:24] feelings right take the faith first and
[40:26] then whatever ever follows is fine right
[40:29] but don't say I've got to feel a certain
[40:31] way for Faith to take action right
[40:33] remember I've shared it many times with
[40:35] an with her tongue tie being a baby we
[40:37] prayed that his that the Lord would
[40:38] loose her tongue She was booked in for a
[40:40] surgery but you know we prayed for her I
[40:42] felt as dead as a post but yeah we
[40:44] prayed and just asked the Lord Lord
[40:46] before the surgeon ever cuts her tongue
[40:47] may that tongue tie be gone I think it
[40:49] was a week later Christine took her to
[40:51] the hospital for the appointment it
[40:52] wasn't just a small snpp it was a bigger
[40:54] operation she needed and you know I
[40:56] think when she took took her to the
[40:57] hospital your Christine saw blood in her
[40:59] mouth but she was a happy baby and then
[41:01] when the doctor opened her mouth to do
[41:03] the operation he said there's no tongue
[41:05] tie here her tongue had been loosed
[41:06] perfectly did I feel anything no but I
[41:09] believed it amen right and sometimes you
[41:12] feel like you're 10 million foot high
[41:13] and you could take everything you know
[41:15] you but but we don't go by feeling right
[41:18] it's like when I was in the Solomons you
[41:20] I shared that how you there's that demon
[41:21] possessed teenage girl and you know
[41:23] praying for her and I was asking Lord
[41:24] you need to do something and I felt the
[41:26] love of God com over me then that that
[41:28] she's a soul just like me so what so
[41:30] Divine love projected Sovereign Grace
[41:32] took over and she was freed and I heard
[41:34] a couple of weeks ago she's serving God
[41:36] today amen praise the Lord so you know
[41:39] but so we go by faith Hallelujah just
[41:41] choose faith it works right don't go by
[41:45] I need a feeling first no because the
[41:46] devil will whip you around by your
[41:48] feelings I need to I need a Vibe no you
[41:50] don't need a Vibe just take God at his
[41:52] word hallelujah amen see it's taking God
[41:55] at his word and having the Assurance in
[41:57] your heart that God is able to keep that
[41:59] what he has said that he would do and
[42:01] will perform everything that he said he
[42:03] would do that's what faith is amen it's
[42:06] just calm and settle as it can be God's
[42:08] able to do it amen you can do it Lord
[42:11] amen amen so so we're not trusting in
[42:14] Emotion I'm an emotional person even
[42:17] people who are resentful is an emotion
[42:20] people who are offended is an emot all
[42:21] the negative emotion still emotion right
[42:24] but so I believe in the positive emotion
[42:26] I believe in crying and shouting and
[42:28] running and all I'm all for that right
[42:31] I'm not a Methodist stachi guy or
[42:34] Anglican or you know I believe in a
[42:35] heartfelt religion it should be
[42:37] heartfelt but take Faith first and then
[42:39] everything else will
[42:41] follow amen so we're not going by
[42:43] emotion we're going by faith and then
[42:44] let Faith do what it wants amen as it
[42:46] says in Psalms 20 here uh now know that
[42:49] I the Lord saveth his
[42:51] anointed he's talking about me there
[42:54] he's talking about you are are you the
[42:55] Lord's anointed amen
[42:57] amen the bride is an anointed bride body
[42:59] amen of Jesus Christ amen now I know
[43:02] that I uh I that the Lord saveth his
[43:04] anointed he will hear him from his holy
[43:07] heaven when the uh with the saving
[43:09] strength of his right hand amen some
[43:13] sorry some trust in chariots some trust
[43:15] in horses but we will remember the name
[43:17] of the Lord Our God Amen so some trust
[43:21] in their abilities but we remember the
[43:23] name of the Lord amen amen
[43:27] because we got to realize now Faith is
[43:30] built solely upon what God has done
[43:33] amen amen amen just as Abraham in his
[43:36] great time of need he taking Isaac up
[43:38] the hill to sacrifice him you know and
[43:40] you know and um Isaac saying here's the
[43:42] wood here's the fire but where's the
[43:43] burnt offering and uh Abraham says my
[43:46] son God will provide himself a lamb see
[43:49] what are you presenting to God I think I
[43:52] heard brother Steve brison Say say this
[43:54] I think it stands repeating what are you
[43:55] presenting to God when you when you come
[43:57] in prayer we're going we're having a
[43:58] prayer meeting tonight what do you
[44:00] present to God on your behalf is it your
[44:03] conduct is it your ability is it what
[44:06] you think you are in terms of what you
[44:08] have done or are you are you presenting
[44:11] your lamb Hallelujah are you because
[44:14] remember God accepts a sacrifice it's
[44:17] got to be a perfect sacrifice and that
[44:19] sacrifice cannot be our ability as a
[44:21] Christian because even brother Bram said
[44:23] I'd hate to try and get to heaven on my
[44:25] Visions on my preaching on any Miracles
[44:28] I'm only trusting in the blood of Jesus
[44:30] Christ to get me to heaven now if a
[44:31] Vindicated prophet of God could say that
[44:33] with the most Supernatural Ministry
[44:35] that's on record I think I can say that
[44:37] too amen right so so we're not trusting
[44:40] in our ability to approach God we're
[44:43] trusting on what he has provided see the
[44:45] Lord will provide himself a lamb for a
[44:47] burnt offering amen and the Lord has
[44:49] provided himself a lamb it's a perfect
[44:52] lamb remember in the Old Testament the
[44:54] the worshipper was never examined and
[44:57] maybe if the worshipper brought his lamb
[44:58] and was trying to talk to the priest
[45:00] about all he had done all he was doing
[45:02] the priest would have told the
[45:03] worshipper you are just hindering the
[45:04] process get out of the way I got to
[45:06] examine the lamb I'm not here to
[45:08] question you there's no questioning
[45:09] booth for you get out of here amen I'm
[45:12] focusing on this lamb see the see the
[45:14] priest's Focus was on the lamb if the
[45:17] lamb was perfect the lamb first had to
[45:19] be examined and if his examine and he is
[45:21] found perfect and that lamb was offered
[45:23] on behalf of the worshipper and the
[45:25] worshipper could go away justif ifed
[45:28] because of what the lamb has done for
[45:30] him amen and it's the same thing with us
[45:33] see there will be people who come in the
[45:35] end time and it says in Matthew 7 Lord
[45:37] have we not cast out devils in your name
[45:39] have we not done many mighty things in
[45:41] your name they're trying to buy their
[45:42] way into Heaven by what God what by what
[45:45] their gift has done in their life it's
[45:48] not about what gifts have done in
[45:49] people's lives it's the life of Jesus
[45:51] Christ in the person that the word of
[45:52] God is fulfilled through them that the
[45:54] character of Christ is manifested in
[45:56] their Liv
[45:57] that's what it's got to be we don't get
[45:59] to Heaven by how gifted we
[46:01] are no it's by the Life of Christ in us
[46:04] the fruit of the spirit on display
[46:06] people should see that we are Christians
[46:08] more than our here and dress and
[46:09] whatever how it no it should be a life
[46:11] that's lived it's not our human life
[46:13] it's his life living through us that's
[46:15] what people must see not by not by any
[46:18] kind of gift we have I'm I know I'm
[46:19] looking at some very gifted people all
[46:21] of you are actually very gifted people
[46:23] whether you know it or not but we're not
[46:25] getting to Heaven by a gift we we into
[46:27] him by the blood of Jesus Christ am me
[46:29] that's why it's so important what
[46:31] happened for the father of the faith God
[46:32] will provide himself a lamb as the same
[46:34] will happen has happened for the
[46:36] children of Abraham amen the spiritual
[46:38] children of Abraham so you got to
[46:39] realize now when you go before God
[46:42] you've got to realize God accepts your
[46:45] sacrifice and that sacrifice he has
[46:47] provided for you cuz he did he knew man
[46:50] would not be able to produce a good
[46:52] enough sacrifice that's why religion and
[46:54] denomination and Christianity with man's
[46:56] ideas and ejected into it has miserably
[46:58] failed amen but when we come back to the
[47:00] word of God and the purity of that it is
[47:04] then what happens the lamb steps forth
[47:06] on our behalf that's why when you follow
[47:08] the word of God God vindicates that word
[47:11] am mean how many people have repented
[47:12] being baptized in the name of Jesus
[47:14] Christ for the remission of sin and
[47:15] receive the Holy Ghost why because
[47:18] you've come God's provided way that he
[47:21] instituted and you've got the results
[47:22] haven't come man's way it's not man's
[47:24] opinion that wasn't Peter's idea that
[47:26] was God idea yeah amen amen see so when
[47:30] we come in prayer we have a lamb that's
[47:33] been offered on our behalf so we don't
[47:35] come we don't come if we've had a good
[47:37] day we don't come if we've had a good
[47:39] week or a bad week or an average week or
[47:41] a hard week or an in between week no we
[47:45] come because God's provided a
[47:47] lamb praise God
[47:50] now brother Bram asked this question in
[47:53] the uh it's in the church H book from
[47:54] the Philadelphia and church AG do we
[47:56] really accept this reality in Christ
[47:58] that it's nothing but the blood no sir
[48:00] even through Luther brought the truth of
[48:02] justification the romanist church and
[48:04] its eastern counterpart the Orthodox
[48:06] Church still clung to works now works
[48:08] are fine but they don't save you they
[48:11] don't make you perfect it's Christ or
[48:13] perish and it's not even Christ and
[48:14] works it is Christ alone so it's not the
[48:17] lamb and what you have done amen it's
[48:20] not the lamb it's not the lamb and the
[48:21] worshipper that helps the worshipper
[48:23] it's all the lamb amen amen see don't
[48:27] make you perfect it's Christ or perish
[48:28] it's not even Christ and works it's
[48:30] Christ Alone this age began the years of
[48:32] Armenian ISM that does not believe in
[48:34] Christ as the reality it does not sing
[48:36] of nothing but the blood for it sings
[48:39] nothing but the blood and my own Good
[48:41] Conduct now I believe in Good Conduct if
[48:43] you're saved you'll do righteously we've
[48:45] already gone over that but let me tell
[48:46] you now salvation is not Jesus plus it's
[48:49] not Jesus and you am that's the Plus
[48:51] Part amen it is Jesus alone salvation is
[48:55] of the Lord from start to finish it's
[48:57] all God so when you f when he first
[49:00] calls you it's him when you give your
[49:02] life to him it's him because it's the
[49:04] goodness of God that leads us to
[49:05] repentance amen right our walk is him
[49:09] our body change will be
[49:11] him hallelujah it's all the Lord
[49:13] hallelujah hey amen from start to finish
[49:16] it's all God let his life be in me let
[49:18] it be his blood that cleanses me let it
[49:20] be his spirit that fills me let it be
[49:22] his word in my mouth my heart and mouth
[49:24] let it be his stripes that heal me Let
[49:26] It Be Jesus and Jesus alone not by works
[49:28] of righteousness which I have done no
[49:30] sir Christ is my life hallelujah amen
[49:33] prise the Lord hallelujah so we can we
[49:36] we can come before God with a full
[49:38] assurance that our lamb
[49:41] Works amen amen we've going to had
[49:43] countless testimonies proving this lamb
[49:45] works not just here but all around the
[49:48] world there's people that have accepted
[49:50] this same word the same lamb and it's
[49:52] worked like he promised it would work in
[49:54] their lives amen doesn't matter what
[49:56] people have come out of drugs and
[49:58] alcohol prostitution religion the world
[50:01] Whatever It Is God has cleansed them
[50:03] transformed them because they've
[50:04] accepted the lamb and not their own good
[50:06] works I mean they haven't accepted what
[50:08] man has done no it's only what God has
[50:10] done that they have accepted and it's
[50:12] transform their lives have' come God's
[50:14] provided way now so if we have a lamb
[50:17] that that that has been provided for us
[50:20] now we know that the that the Holy Ghost
[50:23] was in is in Jesus Christ right so when
[50:26] Jesus died on Calvary that Spirit came
[50:28] out of him amen the life of the
[50:31] sacrifice came out and then it came into
[50:34] the church and The Upper Room amen
[50:36] connecting them in their sacrifices one
[50:39] now in the Old Testament that could
[50:40] never happen because the life of a lamb
[50:42] could never come into the life of a
[50:43] human and change them to be a lamb
[50:45] nature so the nature of the Lamb could
[50:47] never come into a human because the life
[50:50] is different okay but now the life of
[50:52] Jesus Christ by the baptism of the Holy
[50:54] Ghost comes into you and I amen men and
[50:57] changes us that he changes our nature to
[50:59] be like his own nature amen so now that
[51:01] connects you and your sacrifice together
[51:04] so now when you go before God you can
[51:06] present your sacrifice on your behalf
[51:09] amen brother R would say this is is that
[51:11] when you pray amen you must present your
[51:13] token with your prayer which is the holy
[51:16] you got to realize that you the only way
[51:17] you approach God is is by the blood amen
[51:20] that's right to me this is liberating
[51:23] cuz there's nothing that I need to do to
[51:25] I'm ready now no he made me ready amen I
[51:28] gave my life to me transformed me fill
[51:30] me with his holy spirit cleanses me
[51:32] continually Chang me makes you know
[51:34] changes me what he's made me ready amen
[51:37] he's made me fit to come into His
[51:39] presence amen he's made me fit to talk
[51:41] to him hallelujah amen amen so so to me
[51:44] that takes the pressure off because this
[51:45] is not by human
[51:47] ability amen praise God you just got to
[51:50] surrender and let him do the work amen
[51:52] now he says now when we realize and
[51:54] present the token the life it took for
[51:57] the token the blood speaks for us
[51:59] remember the Covenant blood was
[52:00] recognized with the token and the word
[52:02] assures us of the promise the token is
[52:04] the sign that the purchase has been made
[52:07] for us so when you receive the Holy
[52:08] Ghost that's the assurance that you're
[52:10] bought am amen amen that's the that's
[52:13] the proof you're not your own and you're
[52:15] certainly not the Devils you're gods and
[52:18] what God buys he keeps he doesn't lose
[52:21] what he keeps I mean I mean doesn't lose
[52:22] what he buys hallelujah amen amen the
[52:26] token is a sign that the purchase is
[52:28] made for us now if you're not included
[52:30] in that well of course you'll never get
[52:31] nothing just walking through a prayer
[52:32] line walking back out walking up to the
[52:34] altar looking up walking back out oh
[52:36] brother but when the token is once
[52:37] placed in your heart and you know it's
[52:39] the resurrection of Jesus Christ in you
[52:41] something is happening there isn't
[52:43] nothing going to turn you you know where
[52:45] you belong full obedience to the whole
[52:47] word of God entitles you to the token
[52:49] and nothing else blesses he that does
[52:51] all of his Commandments that he might
[52:53] have the right to the tree of life now
[52:55] I'm just going to cut down a scare pray
[52:56] right there because people hear those
[52:58] words full obedience to the full word of
[53:00] God and tells you to the Token then they
[53:02] start putting a list in front of them
[53:04] themselves have I obeyed all these
[53:06] things right that's what people that's
[53:09] what the devil sure does have you met
[53:11] this criteria because remember he wants
[53:13] to put the onus or the pressure or the
[53:16] whatever it is upon
[53:18] you right he wants to put the focus on
[53:20] you but God never wants the focus on you
[53:22] and your ability he wants your focus to
[53:25] be on your lamb amen
[53:27] amen so now we have the C he says now
[53:29] when we pray then we must present the
[53:31] token Lord I have fully obeyed you now
[53:34] look where he's so he's quoting acts 238
[53:36] here okay I have repented of my sins I
[53:39] feel that you have forgiven me I've been
[53:41] baptized into the name of Jesus Christ
[53:42] the holy spirit is upon me now I have
[53:45] need of a certain thing for your glory
[53:46] Lord so what's he saying full obedience
[53:48] to the to the full word of God is acts
[53:52] 238 repent and and I could have brought
[53:55] out more quotes than just this one that
[53:58] he goes beyond a shadow of a doubt to
[53:59] say full obedience is not a big
[54:02] checklist of things you have to do it's
[54:05] repent turn from your sin give your life
[54:07] completely to God fully surrender let
[54:09] him take over be baptized in the name of
[54:11] Jesus Christ for the remission of sin
[54:13] and you shall receive the gift of the
[54:15] Holy Ghost which is the
[54:17] token Hallelujah who you say Lord I
[54:20] fully obeyed your word amen amen now I
[54:24] can now I can present my token with my
[54:26] pray now I've got Assurance God hears me
[54:29] because of what he has
[54:32] done amen now I need to have a certain
[54:35] thing for your glory Lord I ask it it's
[54:37] mine now then there is something that
[54:38] anchors back here few few it's yours
[54:40] it's over then it's all over it's all
[54:42] over it SLE I ask for this I ask for it
[54:45] I must have it C see I want it For Your
[54:47] Glory see well that's it then he gives
[54:49] it to you then you know it's yours
[54:52] that's the way it is our children so
[54:53] forth we apply the blood believe it that
[54:58] that's all all
[55:00] right it's that I know it's very simple
[55:02] but God is simple Hallelujah God is is
[55:05] Christ in Simplicity amen so we have
[55:08] full Assurance I wanted to speak these
[55:09] things to say we have full Assurance
[55:11] because of the token right because we're
[55:15] not coming to God based on our own
[55:17] ability we have come because of his
[55:20] ability what he has done and we present
[55:22] him B basically back to himself Lord
[55:25] You've covered me in your blood you
[55:26] don't see me anyway Lord you see your
[55:29] blood you hear my voice through the
[55:31] blood hallelujah amen and because of
[55:34] this we have full Assurance now that we
[55:37] can whatever we ask the Lord we shall
[55:40] receive if two agree on Earth concerning
[55:43] anything the Lord says he'll do it amen
[55:45] that's why we're going to have a time
[55:46] asking for prayer requests amen when you
[55:48] hear a prayer request just say Lord in
[55:50] My Heart Lord I agree with that brother
[55:52] I agree with that sister Lord may you
[55:54] may you do that for your glory Lord
[55:57] that's why there's agreement there's got
[55:58] to be agreement together amen Lord and
[56:01] then you'll see God on the scene like
[56:02] never before I'm just going to finish
[56:04] with that amen so what do you start
[56:06] doing get all the Gloom away remember
[56:09] you feel stressed anxious worried upset
[56:11] that's a storm coming in what do you do
[56:14] just it comes in one door open the
[56:16] window let it go out the window Amen Let
[56:18] it pass through amen how do you make it
[56:21] pass through start thinking on what the
[56:22] Lord has done for you start rejoicing in
[56:25] what he has done it'll change your
[56:27] thinking it'll it'll turn the sunlight
[56:29] on like Paul and Silas did amen and then
[56:32] now you got to realize when you got a
[56:34] lord in prayer it's not your ability
[56:35] that gets access it's what he has done
[56:38] for you grants you access to his throne
