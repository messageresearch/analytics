[0:00] [Music]
[0:29] Heat. Heat.
[0:32] [Music]
[2:04] God bless you saints. Welcome to the
[2:05] house of the Lord. Let's just stand this
[2:08] evening and open in a word of prayer.
[2:12] [Music]
[2:16] Lord Jesus, I just pray, Lord Jesus, and
[2:18] say thank you, Lord Jesus, that you're
[2:20] with us tonight, Lord. And Lord, I just
[2:23] want to pray that you help us, Lord, to
[2:25] relax in your presence this evening,
[2:27] Lord Jesus, as we've all come, Lord
[2:30] Jesus, expected to hear from you, Lord
[2:32] Jesus, once again, Lord. And Lord, I
[2:34] pray that this wouldn't just be a weekly
[2:36] meetup, Lord Jesus. That we've put in
[2:38] our books, Lord Jesus, as a routine,
[2:40] Lord, but that we'd come, Lord Jesus, to
[2:42] meet you, the living God, Lord Jesus.
[2:44] And that it would be more than just
[2:47] sitting in a pew, Lord Jesus, and
[2:49] listening to someone speak, Lord, but
[2:50] that it would be life coming forth, Lord
[2:53] Jesus, to us, Lord, and that we would
[2:54] receive it, Lord.
[2:57] Lord, I just pray with whoever is
[2:58] bringing the message this evening. Lord,
[2:59] I pray that you be with them and speak
[3:01] through them, Lord. Use them as a
[3:03] vessel, Lord Jesus. And Lord, those that
[3:05] couldn't make it tonight, be their
[3:06] portion, Lord. May you be with them
[3:08] wherever they are, Lord. And Lord, I
[3:10] pray you be with us tonight, Lord Jesus.
[3:12] And thank you that we could all make it,
[3:14] Lord Jesus. It's a blessing in itself
[3:15] that we could be here, Lord. And Lord, I
[3:17] just pray that we wouldn't take that for
[3:19] granted, Lord. I pray it in Jesus name.
[3:21] Amen.
[3:24] [Music]
[3:27] Yeah, let's start with chorus. Oh
[3:30] my. Oh, when the morning comes, it's
[3:35] when all the saints of God are gathered

[3:45] God. For we'll understand it better by
[3:49] and by. Oh by and
[3:51] by, by and by. Oh, when the morning
[3:57] comes, when all the saints of God are
[4:02] gathered home, we will tell the story of
[4:07] how we've
[4:08] overcome. Who will understand it better
[4:12] by?
[4:15] We are often
[4:17] destitute of the things that life
[4:20] commands want food and want shelter
[4:24] thirsty hills and barren plans. We are
[4:28] trusting in the Lord and according to
[4:32] God's word we will understand it better
[4:39] by oh by and by oh when the morning
[4:45] come when all the saints of God are
[4:50] gathered home we will tell the story of
[4:56] powerful
[4:58] or will understand it better
[5:03] by time on any hand that we cannot
[5:09] understand all the ways that God will
[5:12] lead us to that blessed promised land.
[5:16] But he guides us with his eyes and we'll
[5:20] follow till we die. Oh, will I
[5:24] understand it better by Oh, by and
[5:29] by, by and by. Oh, when the morning
[5:35] come. When all the saints of God are
[5:40] gathered home, we will tell the story of
[5:46] how God come. For we'll understand it
[5:50] better by God.
[5:54] For temptations it says often take us
[5:59] unawares and our hearts are made to
[6:02] please for some good word or de and we
[6:07] wonder why it says when we try to do our
[6:12] best but we'll understand it better

[6:59] Lord and according to his word, we will
[7:04] understand it better by. Oh, by and
[7:09] by, by and by. Oh, when the morning
[7:15] comes, when all the saints of God are
[7:20] gathered home, we will tell the story.

[8:18] overcome. Oh, we'll understand it better
[8:23] by. Oh, by and
[8:25] by, by and by.

[14:04] life, all my life, you have been
[14:12] faithful. And all my life, you have been
[14:16] so so good.
[14:21] with every breath that I am
[14:26] able. Oh, I will
[14:29] sing of the
[14:32] goodness of God. I love your voice. I
[14:36] love your

[14:45] fire, the darkest night.

[14:53] other. I've known you as a
[14:57] father. I've known you as a
[15:01] friend. And I have
[15:04] lived in the
[15:06] goodness of God. And all my
[15:12] life, all my life you have been
[15:15] faithful.

[15:20] And all my life you have been so so
[15:27] good with every breath that I am
[15:33] able. Oh, I will
[15:36] sing of the
[15:38] goodness of God. And all my
[15:43] life, all my life, you have been
[15:51] faithful. And all my life you have been
[15:55] so so good.
[16:00] With every breath that I
[16:05] amable, oh I will
[16:07] sing of the
[16:10] goodness of God and your
[16:15] goodness. Your goodness is running

[17:56] musicians. Amen. God bless you all
[17:58] tonight. Good to see everyone out here
[18:00] on this prayer service. Amen. Praise the
[18:03] Lord. Good. Yeah. Good to be in the
[18:04] house of God as always. Amen. Let's uh
[18:06] let's turn in the scripture to 1
[18:09] Corinthians
[18:10] 9 and verses
[18:12] 24- 27.
[18:19] This may be a bit of a Sunday school
[18:20] lesson, but I know it's not Sunday, but
[18:23] we're having a
[18:26] lesson. So, 1 Corinthians
[18:29] 9:24-27. Um, won't keep you too long, I
[18:32] don't think, tonight. Um, says here
[18:35] says, "Know ye not that they which run
[18:38] in a race run all, but one receiveth the
[18:43] prize, so run that ye may obtain. And
[18:46] every man that striveth for the mastery
[18:48] is tempered in all things. Now they do
[18:50] it to obtain a corruptible crown, but we
[18:53] and
[18:54] incorruptible. I therefore so run not as
[18:57] uncertainly so fight I not as one that
[19:00] beatth the air, but I keep under my
[19:03] sorry but I keep under my body and bring
[19:05] it into subjection least that by any
[19:08] means when I have preached to others I
[19:10] myself should be a cast away. Amen. May
[19:13] the Lord bless reading of his word.
[19:15] Let's just open a word of prayer um
[19:16] tonight. Amen. Let's pray together.
[19:18] Gracious Lord, we can truly look back on
[19:21] our lives and see it's your goodness,
[19:22] Lord, that's been running after us,
[19:24] Lord. Truly, all of our lives, Lord, you
[19:27] have been faithful. There's been times
[19:29] we have not been faithful, but yet you
[19:31] remain faithful. And we thank you for
[19:32] your faithfulness, Lord. I just ask as
[19:35] we've read your word, may you anoint uh
[19:37] anoint your word to our hearts, Lord.
[19:39] May you anoint speaker and hear, Lord.
[19:40] Those who are streaming, Lord, may be
[19:42] everyone's portion tonight. We need more
[19:44] of you, Lord. We've gathered here in the
[19:46] middle of the week, Lord, to uh to
[19:48] receive of you, Lord God, that you would
[19:49] increase our faith, Lord. Give us a real
[19:51] spiritual boost, Father, for the rest of
[19:53] the week. We love you, Lord. We just
[19:54] want to worship you and praise you, and
[19:56] we surrender our whole lives into your
[19:57] hands for your glory in Jesus Christ's
[19:59] name. Amen. Amen. God bless you,
[20:02] friends. You can have your seats uh
[20:03] tonight. So I want to speak about I was
[20:05] going to title this work uh works as
[20:08] faith expressed but um I really want to
[20:11] talk about you know there's always a
[20:12] question about well it's the grace of
[20:14] God that saves us and truly it's the
[20:16] grace of God that keeps us so what do we
[20:19] have to do with it? Well you get
[20:22] in you get out what you put in right so
[20:26] salvation's settled right salvation is
[20:28] of the Lord. Amen. We can't save
[20:30] ourselves. Not one of us could save the
[20:32] other. I couldn't save myself. None of
[20:34] us could. So God's grace reached down.
[20:37] Amen. Purchased our salvation, redeemed
[20:39] us and called us to his side through the
[20:42] word. But now really the question is,
[20:45] how much victory do you want in your
[20:46] life? This is really where I want to go
[20:48] because um I pray that by now all the
[20:51] fear of being lost has been driven out
[20:53] of our hearts. Right? We no longer fear
[20:56] that we're not going to make it, but we
[20:58] know we're going to make it because he's
[21:00] revealed to us that we're there, right?
[21:02] Our names on the Lamb's Book of Life. I
[21:04] trust it's been anchored in our hearts.
[21:05] Amen. And if it hasn't been, I pray God
[21:07] does that for you tonight. Amen. That
[21:09] you know you're there. Amen. Like John
[21:13] when he when you know when the lamb took
[21:14] the book, you know, and he uh you know,
[21:16] John begin to rejoice in all heaven and
[21:18] under heaven, you know, the earth,
[21:19] everything heard him praise God and
[21:21] everything. And brother Bram said,
[21:22] "Well, John must look past the curtain
[21:24] of time and said, "Old John made it."
[21:25] Amen. So he had a real jubilee. So So he
[21:28] saw that he made it. Amen. I believe
[21:29] that we have seen the same thing. God's
[21:31] given us a revelation that we are one of
[21:33] his. So now, but we don't want to run
[21:36] this race haphazardly. Amen. As as the
[21:38] apostle Paul would say this, he doesn't
[21:40] run as uncertainly. He, you know, he
[21:43] knows he knows his end destination. He
[21:45] knows where he's going to end up. And
[21:47] he's saying that we should run. So just
[21:49] said this first verse here. Know you not
[21:51] that they which run in a race run all,
[21:53] but one receiveth the prize, so run that
[21:56] you may obtain. So we're not, you know,
[21:59] I don't believe any of us are here
[22:00] tonight just for a participation award.
[22:04] You know, this world is full of particip
[22:06] participation awards, all these things,
[22:08] but we're we're running to win. Amen.
[22:10] We're we're we're running to win. Amen.
[22:12] This is not a fun run. This is a matter
[22:14] of life or death, but we want to win.
[22:17] Amen. And I believe if you know everyone
[22:20] who uh you know those who compete on the
[22:22] world stage, I don't believe they go
[22:24] just to be part of it. Amen. I believe
[22:26] they go to to to do the best they can
[22:29] but to ultimately win the prize. Now you
[22:31] think of those top three runners in the
[22:33] world because they've been you know h I
[22:35] don't know when the Olympics is. It'll
[22:37] come up when it is but you know but but
[22:39] but there's various track competitions
[22:41] leading up to the Olympics. So it's not
[22:43] every four years they meet together but
[22:44] there's different indoor championships
[22:46] outdoor in different places and you know
[22:48] people's timings are recorded they see
[22:50] their progress and you know you know
[22:52] there comes a point where it sinks into
[22:54] the runners they could win the gold that
[22:57] that that this Olympics could be their
[22:59] Olympics or maybe they won the last one
[23:01] but they're still on track to to to
[23:03] remain undefeated. So they don't they
[23:06] don't just just walk through life
[23:08] haphazardly now saying well I know I
[23:11] can. They put their faith into action
[23:14] and everyone sees their faith because
[23:16] they believe they're going to win. One
[23:18] of the biggest ways to lose in any
[23:20] competition is believe you can't win.
[23:22] Doesn't matter how good you are on
[23:23] paper, if you don't have faith in your
[23:25] own ability. Now, this is just natural
[23:26] man now, right? If they don't believe
[23:28] they can win, they won't win. But
[23:30] there's a team that has faith in
[23:31] themselves. I mean, some of the greatest
[23:33] coaches have ever been have told their
[23:35] have had told their teams, maybe it's
[23:37] halftime, maybe it's, you know, the end
[23:38] of, you know, like, you know, the buzz
[23:40] is about to go in basketball, few more
[23:42] seconds on the clock, whatever, and they
[23:44] have a huddle, you know, that that coach
[23:46] instills in them, you're going to win.
[23:48] You're champions now. Get out there and
[23:50] prove it. Amen. You can do it. He
[23:51] doesn't tell them how useless they are.
[23:52] They say, no, you can do it. Amen. And
[23:55] so, so it it it it puts a faith in them
[23:58] that they can win the game. Amen.
[24:01] friends.
[24:03] If there was ever a people who have
[24:05] faith that they've won the game,
[24:08] it's you and I. Amen. So if that is a
[24:11] revelation now, I believe our works are
[24:15] our life. Because remember, brother
[24:16] Bram, you know, brought out so well in
[24:18] works is faith expressed. He says faith
[24:20] is what God sees and your works or your
[24:24] life is what man sees. And we don't do
[24:27] works to get into heaven or even get any
[24:29] kind of reward system with God. He
[24:31] doesn't have a reward system. No. He
[24:33] purchased our salvation on Calvary. Now,
[24:35] every redemptive blessing is yours. The
[24:38] devil's going to try and stop you
[24:39] obtaining it, but it's yours. Now, if
[24:41] it's mine, I want it. Right? So, it's
[24:43] like the guy who can win the gold. If
[24:45] it's his, he wants it. You know, he's
[24:47] not just going to casually prepare. He's
[24:49] going to put everything within him into
[24:50] it cuz he knows he's going to stand on
[24:53] the podium or he's got odds he's going
[24:55] to stand there. Friends, we don't have
[24:56] odds. We have concrete 100%. You're
[24:58] going to get there. Amen. By the word of
[25:01] God.
[25:02] Praise the Lord. So now James would say
[25:05] here, he says, "Oh vain man, that faith
[25:07] without works is dead. Was not Abraham
[25:09] our father justified by works when he
[25:11] had offered Isaac his son upon the
[25:12] altar. Seth thou how faith wrought with
[25:15] his works? And by works was faith made
[25:17] perfect, and the scripture was fulfilled
[25:19] which saith Abraham believed God, and it
[25:21] was imputed unto him for righteousness,
[25:22] and he was called the friend of God."
[25:24] You see then how that by works a man is
[25:26] justified, not by faith only. Likewise
[25:29] also was not Rahab the harlot justified
[25:31] by works when she had received the
[25:33] messengers and sent them out the other
[25:35] way. For as the body without the spirit
[25:36] is dead, so faith without works is dead
[25:39] also. So your faith will be lived out of
[25:41] you. Amen. It'll be lived out of you.
[25:43] And that is the works that people see. I
[25:45] think sometimes we need a glossery term.
[25:47] What I mean by works, when I say works,
[25:49] I don't mean that you work your way into
[25:51] anything. No, you believe it and you
[25:53] receive it. Amen. And like I say quite
[25:56] often, you know, you know, uh, you know,
[25:58] everything is all the Lord. So, what can
[26:00] we do? Now, some people can take that
[26:01] and actually sit back and say, well, if
[26:03] there's nothing I can do, what's the
[26:04] point? But when you realize it's all the
[26:06] Lord, you surrender yourself to his
[26:08] word. Then you let him do it. Right?
[26:11] Then then your faith you receive goes
[26:12] into action. Now, there's a there's a
[26:14] principle in the scripture where it
[26:16] says, "Be not deceived. God is not
[26:17] mocked. For whatsoever man shall um
[26:19] seweth, that shall he also reap. For he
[26:22] that sweth to his flesh shall of the
[26:23] flesh reap corruption, but he that sweth
[26:25] to the spirit shall of the spirit reap
[26:28] life everlasting. So it's what you put
[26:30] in is what you're going to get out. Now
[26:32] we know we're we are uh the believer
[26:34] becomes actually a dual person. There's
[26:37] a natural part and there's a spiritual
[26:38] part, right? And we know which one is
[26:41] stronger, the spiritual part, right? But
[26:43] it's what you surrender yourself to is
[26:45] what's going to lead you. Amen. So, so
[26:48] what you sow to, that's what you're
[26:51] going to reap. Okay? So, now the Holy
[26:53] Ghost feeds on the word of God.
[26:56] Amen. Feeds on the word of God. This
[26:59] engine of the Holy Ghost cannot blow a
[27:02] gasket. It can't be flooded. It can't
[27:05] pop a valve. You can feed it and feed it
[27:07] and feed it with the word of God and you
[27:09] watch it come to life. Amen. So, if you
[27:11] want to see God live more in your life,
[27:14] feed the Holy Ghost within you. That's
[27:17] why it's so important when you have an
[27:18] experience in the Lord, feed that
[27:20] experience. Amen. Don't just keep it
[27:22] fresh in your mind what happened. Feed
[27:24] it on the word of God. Amen. Because we
[27:27] got to take our experiences with us.
[27:28] Amen. So maybe years ago, God touched
[27:30] your life and it was God. Feed that
[27:32] experience. Amen. Take the word and feed
[27:35] it because the Holy Ghost, brother,
[27:37] brother Bram says, doesn't feed on
[27:39] creed. It's like a I shouldn't say it,
[27:41] but I'm going to say it. It's like a
[27:43] fussy
[27:44] kid. They don't like some things. I like
[27:46] some things, right? The Holy Ghost will
[27:49] only feed on the word. He won't stand
[27:50] creeds. He won't stand dogmas or nice
[27:53] ideas. He only wants pure word of God.
[27:56] And I'm so thankful now that we have a
[27:59] pure seven seal course meal, amen, for
[28:01] the Holy Ghost within us to feed upon.
[28:04] Amen. So, if you want to see God move in
[28:06] your life and you want to see the carnal
[28:08] side of you be subject, as Paul would
[28:11] say, let the Holy Ghost rule. Well, how
[28:13] do you let him rule? Feed it. Amen.
[28:15] Amen. Don't starve them. Don't put them
[28:17] on a diet. Amen. This, you know, it's a
[28:19] time of fat diets. I think, no, I want a
[28:21] balanced fullc course meal. I want my
[28:25] carbs with some veggies with some salad
[28:29] with some meat. I want the whole deal.
[28:32] Amen. Bread on the side, butter and
[28:33] everything. I want everything. So, I
[28:35] want from Genesis 1:1 to the end of
[28:37] Revelations. I want 1947 to 1965. I want
[28:41] the whole word that's been revealed.
[28:44] Amen. I don't want to just live off, I
[28:47] don't know,
[28:50] garnish. It doesn't cut it for me. It
[28:53] doesn't cut it for the uh Holy Ghost
[28:55] either. He wants to be fed.
[28:58] Amen. So, you find yourself in a real,
[29:00] you know, carnal fussy, just start
[29:02] feeding on the word and watch him take
[29:04] over. Amen. Amen. So it's like you know
[29:08] when when when man would you know when
[29:10] man is birthed into the kingdom there
[29:12] comes these like two natures in him.
[29:14] There's the white dog and the black
[29:16] dogs. There's the Holy Ghost. There's
[29:17] the carnal side. And brother Bram would
[29:20] would would um he would speak about how
[29:23] he went to a uh Indian reservation.
[29:25] There's a chief and the chief received
[29:26] the Holy Ghost and um he would speak
[29:29] about how you so for instance Jesus made
[29:31] a statement and a promise the inside man
[29:33] says it's true. So there's always this
[29:35] battle going on. But we got to realize
[29:37] the Holy Ghost is greater than your
[29:38] flesh. Amen. Did he not bring this flesh
[29:41] into subjection when he begin to brood
[29:43] over your life? He wasn't even in you
[29:45] yet. He began to call you and brood over
[29:47] your life and moments of time he had
[29:49] come be very near and he be to draw and
[29:51] he begin to deal with you and and what
[29:53] did you do? You surrendered this to the
[29:55] word of God. You came to the altar and
[29:57] just surrendered yourself completely.
[29:59] Maybe in a like me in a library or in my
[30:01] in my flat at uni wherever you know or
[30:04] maybe at an altar at a camp you what you
[30:06] you brought this guy forward and you
[30:08] gave him you surrendered your heart
[30:10] everything to the Lord then you took him
[30:12] to the waters of
[30:13] baptism. Amen. Then you bring him to
[30:16] church. You bring him to read the Bible.
[30:18] You bring him to listen to the message.
[30:19] This guy will thank you one day when
[30:22] he's changed. Remember this guy is not
[30:24] converted. So this guy is lazy. He
[30:27] doesn't want to serve God.
[30:29] But the Holy Ghost that was even more
[30:31] dominant than this one is just brooding
[30:33] over you is now on the inside of the
[30:34] inside of you. That force is far greater
[30:37] than this guy. That's right. Amen.
[30:39] Because there's something in a believer
[30:40] when you get a bit carnal, you feel a
[30:42] bit distant, that you know that black
[30:43] dog begins to rise a bit. You just don't
[30:46] feel right. And you say, "I'm not meant
[30:48] to be like this. I do not like this."
[30:51] Amen. I don't like this. You say,
[30:53] "Lord, kill that guy. He'll be changed."
[30:57] Amen. He'll be changed. But you see,
[30:59] it's never You got to realize these two
[31:01] powers are not equal strength.
[31:05] The white one's far greater than the
[31:07] black. Amen. The Holy Ghost is far
[31:09] greater than our carnal
[31:11] nature. Amen. And we want we want the we
[31:14] want the Holy Ghost to rule, but it all
[31:16] depends which one you feed. So, I'm just
[31:17] going to go back to this. The inside man
[31:19] says that's true. The outside man
[31:21] reasons that it um that it can't be true
[31:22] to you. So you got to realize when you
[31:24] hear a promise of God, something in you
[31:26] says yes, but then reasoning comes in
[31:27] behind it, but it can't be for you.
[31:29] That's the black dog speaking. That's
[31:31] not even the real you speaking. This guy
[31:33] is not the real you. Your soul is the
[31:35] real you. Brother said that you've never
[31:37] we've never actually seen one another
[31:38] before cuz we're just in this house that
[31:41] needs a transformation. I was going to
[31:43] say renovation. It needs more than that.
[31:45] Needs more than a paint job. That's for
[31:46] sure. Some new shingles on the roof. It
[31:48] needs a hole. Needs a fire and a change.
[31:50] Amen. But you see, but Amen. But you
[31:52] just then ignore the outside man and
[31:54] accept the inside man. Amen. So ignore
[31:57] the reasoning and just take God at his
[31:59] word. That's the same thing Paul's
[32:00] speaking of. He sold under the law to
[32:02] count all sin. Every one of us is the
[32:04] same. That's the reason we have
[32:06] troubles. We do have married four or
[32:07] five times this and that and all kinds
[32:09] of sin, adulteries, everything else
[32:10] along in our lives is because of those
[32:12] things. We're carnal and that part must
[32:14] perish. But then inside we're a spirit
[32:16] man, soul inside. That's faith in God's
[32:18] word. Then we bring our outside body
[32:20] under subjection to the word by faith by
[32:23] accepting what God said. It's really
[32:25] that simple. It's not mind over matter.
[32:28] It's just by accepting what God said,
[32:30] you'll bring this guy into subjection to
[32:32] the word of God. Amen. Amen. I'm glad
[32:34] it's like that. Amen. Somebody um told
[32:37] me he had one time was converted,
[32:39] received the Holy Ghost, said to him,
[32:40] "How you getting along?" Says to this
[32:42] Indian chief now, he said, "Pretty good,
[32:43] pretty bad." He said, "Well, how um how
[32:45] do you mean pretty good and pretty um
[32:47] pretty bad and pretty good?" He said,
[32:49] "Well, since me received the Holy
[32:50] Ghost," he said, "There's been two dogs
[32:52] in me. One of them is a black dog. The
[32:53] other one's a white dog. They argue all
[32:55] the time. They growl and fight at one
[32:57] another." And said, "The white dog wants
[32:59] me to do good. The black dog wants me to
[33:01] do bad." Said, "Well, chief, which one
[33:03] of them wins the fight?" Says that that
[33:05] depends on which one chief feeds the
[33:07] most.
[33:10] Amen. The black one should be should be
[33:12] so emaciated. I want to run this race,
[33:15] man. I want to win. Amen. Because
[33:18] remember, we're just seeing what the
[33:19] best lap time we can get now. Amen. How
[33:21] many victories we can God can give us in
[33:23] our lives. I mean, how many testimonies
[33:25] how much God can prove his word. That's
[33:27] really that's really what we're running
[33:29] with now. Amen. Amen. Remember the score
[33:31] is settled on you at Calvary. I remember
[33:34] um um what was it? Um Sister Val, I
[33:36] think Christine was saying about Sister
[33:38] Val remembered Sister Val Smith, she's
[33:39] gone on to be with the Lord. But she was
[33:41] a little girl when World War II finished
[33:43] and she remembers the day when the
[33:46] announcement was victory in Europe and
[33:48] then victory in in the Pacific and
[33:51] everyone just quit work. Brother B talks
[33:53] about it. The feeling that just came
[33:55] over the whole country. It's done. It's
[33:59] settled. No more fighting. No more no
[34:02] more sending our young people to war. No
[34:05] more getting letters back killed in
[34:07] action, wounded in action, missing an
[34:09] action. No more strife. It's done.
[34:11] Everything we've been striving to
[34:13] achieve is done. And just the peace that
[34:15] settled over and the jubilation. And
[34:17] brother Ram says that's nothing compared
[34:19] to the our victory day. I mean that day
[34:21] on Calvary when the war between God and
[34:23] man was settled. Amen. That day when
[34:25] Jesus bowed head said it is finished.
[34:27] Amen. There was there was peace now
[34:29] between God and man. And oh what a
[34:30] feeling it is. Amen. To recognize
[34:33] there's no more strife between us and
[34:34] God no more. He settled that day on
[34:36] Calvary. So, we're not fighting against
[34:38] God. We're not we're not emnity with him
[34:40] at all. We're on we're on his side and
[34:43] now we're just walking or rather running
[34:45] to see all the victories we can gather.
[34:49] Amen. Don't you want to carry a lot of
[34:51] testimonies out of this world of what
[34:53] God did in your life? Not what you did,
[34:55] what God did, what the white dog did in
[34:58] your life. Amen. Praise the Lord. So, I
[35:02] think we should feed feed the white one.
[35:04] See, it depends. He Sorry. He says, he
[35:07] says, I think that's a good answer. See,
[35:08] there just depends on the waring of the
[35:09] body that's in you. It depends on which
[35:11] one you cater to, which nature you cater
[35:13] to. The carnal nature after the things
[35:14] of the world or the spiritual nature
[35:16] after the things of God, that does
[35:20] it. Amen.
[35:22] Now says in now this world is so geared
[35:26] for entertainment and fun. I'm sure this
[35:29] is not a strange uh uh thought for me to
[35:33] say that this this world is so geared
[35:35] toward you know and and I even think
[35:37] it's possibly the wrong I think I heard
[35:39] someone say this I'm not sure but you
[35:41] know we even engineer our children when
[35:44] they're young we say how was you know
[35:46] was how was school today was it
[35:49] fun you know was it fun at kindergarten
[35:52] you know was this fun did you enjoy this
[35:54] and and and it should be fun at that age
[35:56] cuz it's mostly playing right but But we
[35:58] kind of engineer our society that things
[36:01] if it's fun, it's good. If it's not fun,
[36:03] it's bad. And and I'm going to avoid the
[36:06] not fun stuff. I'm just going to do the
[36:07] fun stuff. That's just pandering to this
[36:09] guy. Cuz life is not always fun. Life is
[36:13] not always
[36:14] entertaining. Amen. If you come here for
[36:16] entertainment, you should find yourself
[36:17] somewhere else. I don't think this is
[36:19] very But you see, we don't come to
[36:21] church to be entertained. We come here
[36:23] to worship God, right? A like work is
[36:25] work. It's not always fun. It's not
[36:28] always entertaining. It's not always
[36:29] interesting, you know. But we can't we
[36:31] can't just be going just for
[36:32] entertaining things because otherwise
[36:34] we'll just be feeding the black dog.
[36:37] And that's why the apostle Paul would
[36:38] say, "If you then be risen with Christ,
[36:40] seek those things which are above, which
[36:42] Christ siteth on the right hand of God.
[36:44] Set your affection on things above, not
[36:46] on the things of the earth." Now, this
[36:49] affectionist means to exercise the mind,
[36:51] entertain or have a sentiment or
[36:53] opinion. Amen. It means to be disposed
[36:56] or intensely interested in something.
[36:59] I'm just paraphrasing this. So, what are
[37:01] your affections on? See, the devil wants
[37:03] our affections to be on the wrong thing.
[37:06] He wants our affections to be on feeding
[37:08] the black dog. But we're in a race.
[37:11] Amen. We're in a race. What if we set
[37:13] our affections, and I'm not saying you
[37:15] don't. I believe you are. But what if
[37:17] you set your affections on things above?
[37:20] What could happen? What could happen in
[37:23] our little lives in this little church
[37:25] here? Amen. If we if we allow God to to
[37:29] completely take over take over our lives
[37:31] like never before. What could happen?
[37:33] Could be an incredible thing. Brother
[37:35] Bram says in perfect strength by perfect
[37:37] weakness. I've often said the greatest
[37:38] enemy our God is William Brandom. He's
[37:40] the one that gets in God's way. He's the
[37:42] one that gets lazy. He's the one that
[37:44] gets to a place sometimes where he
[37:45] thinks he can do something about it. And
[37:47] when he does, that shoves God right out
[37:49] of the picture. But when I can get rid
[37:50] of that guy, then I get to a place where
[37:52] he is out of the way. Then God can come
[37:54] over and do things that William Brandham
[37:56] knows nothing about. That's when God can
[37:58] use you. That's when he can use any of
[38:00] you. He can use anybody. When we get
[38:02] when we get out of the way, but as long
[38:04] as we get ourselves in the way, then we
[38:06] cannot. All right? So, what does it mean
[38:08] to get yourself in the way? Well, you
[38:10] know, you just pandered to the black
[38:12] dog. That's getting in the way, right?
[38:15] But if you let the Lord live, then
[38:17] naturally you've got to get out of the
[38:18] way to let him live. Amen. Now remember,
[38:21] we're in a race. Praise the Lord.
[38:25] Amen. To now this, as we said, this
[38:28] world is a world of entertainment. Our
[38:31] affections, the devil tries to to to
[38:34] grab hold of our affections. But I say,
[38:36] if the Holy Ghost gets a hold of your
[38:38] life, your affections can't be bought.
[38:41] Amen. Your affections are set on things
[38:43] above. Your whole life has been changed
[38:45] and now all you really want to do is see
[38:47] God live in your family, at your job,
[38:50] church, wherever you are. You want to
[38:52] see him live, right? Amen. And you see,
[38:55] this is why it's so important that we
[38:57] that we separate ourselves from our
[39:00] senses of the black
[39:02] dog. Because if we walk by our sight,
[39:05] that's the black dog ruling. But we walk
[39:07] by faith and not by sight. Right? And he
[39:10] says, God is calling every seed of
[39:12] Abraham this morning. Morning. I say
[39:13] tonight to to that same kind of life.
[39:15] The great battles on now worldwide. God
[39:18] wants his children separating themselves
[39:19] from what? Taste, feel, smell, hear,
[39:21] imaginations, conscious, memories,
[39:23] reason, affections, everything. Open up
[39:24] their mind and let the word come in and
[39:27] march with the word. That's a real
[39:29] soldier. Amen. So someone who doesn't
[39:31] walk by their imagination, their
[39:32] conscious, their affections, if they're
[39:34] not of God, you know, all those things,
[39:35] but they just take God at his word. You
[39:37] say, "Do you always feel like it?" No. I
[39:41] remember bron um brother Ron Spencer
[39:43] said after he had that propane explosion
[39:45] and burnt out 80 odd% of his lungs and
[39:47] you know he was there and he uh you know
[39:49] he was just recovering from that but he
[39:51] would he would with his nose turn the
[39:53] pages of his Bible and and and he said
[39:56] did I feel like it? No. But I knew I had
[39:58] to feed the inside man. He overcame his
[40:01] own limitations of his health and his
[40:03] struggles because he knew Lord I want
[40:05] you to rule in my life. I want to feed
[40:07] the Holy Ghost in in my life because
[40:09] it's the only way of safety. Amen. It's
[40:13] our it's our only real source of
[40:14] deliverance is God himself.
[40:17] And there's a real simple key in the
[40:19] Bible. If you want faith, then faith
[40:21] cometh by hearing and hearing by the
[40:23] word of God. So if you want faith to
[40:25] come, hear the word of God and faith
[40:28] will come. This is a guaranteed this is
[40:30] a guaranteed principle. Amen. Praise the
[40:33] Lord. So you say, "Well, I feel weak in
[40:35] faith." Well, listen to the word. Listen
[40:37] to a good song. Listen to a prayer line.
[40:40] Listen to what God's done. Listen to a
[40:42] testimony. I mean, listen to the word of
[40:43] God and faith will rise. I mean, it'll
[40:46] start to actually equilibrate you the
[40:48] right way because if you feel weak in
[40:49] faith, you know, we go through times
[40:51] when we feel weak. And out of weakness,
[40:54] strength comes. Amen. Actually, God
[40:57] wants us to be weak. But don't ever pull
[41:00] yourself in a hole and say, "Pull me,
[41:01] I'm weak." No. Say, "God, in this
[41:03] moment, your strength is going to come
[41:05] out." Amen. And how do you get that to
[41:06] happen? You feed on the word of God. Let
[41:09] this message be a daily diet of yours.
[41:11] Amen. Start reading the Bible like never
[41:13] before. Not out of works now, out of
[41:15] love. What's your motivation?
[41:18] You know, it's like a marriage. You've
[41:20] got to work at it. James, keep pursuing,
[41:22] Tiana. You've got your queen, but don't
[41:24] just settle there. There's more of her
[41:26] for you to know, right? Amen. Yeah. But
[41:30] but mar you know you got to work at a
[41:32] relationship. Oh if it's works then why
[41:34] should I bother? No no no your
[41:36] motivation's wrong if you think that
[41:37] way. No if your motivation is I love her
[41:40] then then you'll put the work in. Cuz
[41:42] your motivation's love. If you love the
[41:44] Lord you'll put the work in.
[41:47] Amen. Praise the Lord. They now sorry.
[41:52] Um Amen. So but we must never get out of
[41:55] this principle here. Okay. See what's
[41:58] happened in the past of course is
[42:00] legalism has come in and it's given an
[42:03] idea that if you legally uphold the word
[42:05] then you're entitled to the benefits of
[42:07] the blessings of God but no it comes by
[42:10] hearing hearing by the word of God right
[42:13] as as the apostle Paul would say oh
[42:15] foolish Galatians who hath bewitched you
[42:17] that you should not obey the truth
[42:18] before whose eyes Jesus Christ has been
[42:21] evidently set forth crucified among you
[42:23] this only would I learn of you received
[42:25] ye the spirit by the works of the law or
[42:27] by the hearing of faith. Are you so
[42:31] foolish having begun in the spirit? Are
[42:32] you now made perfect by the flesh? I
[42:36] just want to find this here. So, so he's
[42:38] asking the question, why have you been
[42:40] derailed by thinking it's your
[42:42] adherence, your your human adherence,
[42:46] uh, you know, keeping the works of the
[42:48] law is going to, you know, bring the
[42:49] spirit upon your life. Now, what he's
[42:51] talking about here is the works of the
[42:52] law is they started to adopt the
[42:55] traditions of the Jewish religion. I
[42:57] keep the feast of Pentecost and first
[42:59] fruits and Passover and I do this and we
[43:02] keep the Sabbath and all these things.
[43:04] That's the works of the law he's talking
[43:05] about. They don't work. Amen. Just like
[43:08] brother Alistister said a week ago here,
[43:10] you know, the length of a skirt, is it
[43:12] is it more holy if it touches the
[43:14] ground? No. But people get in their mind
[43:17] it is. And I don't know how they get
[43:18] that, but it gets in there. It's got
[43:20] nothing to do with it, right? But so you
[43:23] see, we I pray we keep running this race
[43:26] certainly knowing that we received the
[43:29] spirit by the hearing of faith and that
[43:32] every step of this journey, we keep
[43:35] receiving more by the hearing of faith.
[43:38] I'm just quoting the last part of that
[43:39] yellow bit there.
[43:43] Amen. Now, I'm just going to jump around
[43:46] a bit here, but maybe we'll go here
[43:48] first. There's areas of our lives that
[43:51] we can control. Now, if you can't read
[43:54] this, I'll send it to you. Okay? There.
[43:55] So, there's areas of our life we can
[43:57] control. Remember, it's like the Song of
[43:58] Solomon says, we're like a garden. We
[44:01] are like a garden. What you plant is
[44:03] what you'll get. Amen. So now, what's in
[44:07] my control? How I treat others is in my
[44:10] control. Remember, we're running a race,
[44:12] okay? How I treat others is in my
[44:14] control. My attitude is in my control.
[44:17] We all know when we have a stink
[44:19] attitude.
[44:22] I'm grumpy. Everything's wrong. First
[44:26] world problems. Get up to here. Oh boy.
[44:30] You know, we can entertain that. And
[44:33] that's just letting the black dog run
[44:34] for a bit. Sick him, boy. Sick him.
[44:37] That's a dumb idea. He'll bite you. He
[44:39] is you, but he'll bite you anyway. You
[44:41] know, but we can control our attitude.
[44:43] We can control our words.
[44:47] Amen. If you can't, there's
[44:50] prayer. What I think about, you can
[44:52] control. Now, you can't stop a thought
[44:54] coming, but you can choose if you're
[44:56] going to entertain or if you're going to
[44:58] blow that thing away with the word,
[45:00] right? You have a choice. Amen. We can't
[45:02] stop. Like brother Ram says, like it's
[45:03] like a bird building a nest. You may not
[45:06] not be able to stop the bird flying and
[45:07] like putting twigs there, but you can
[45:09] shoot the thing that it can't keep
[45:10] building the nest. It's like a thought.
[45:12] A thought will come. It's amazing how a
[45:14] thought can we can't let thoughts derail
[45:16] us. It's like a lust thought comes in or
[45:18] just some hatred towards someone and
[45:20] people are going to think, "Am I even a
[45:21] Christian?" Yeah, you are. That's why
[45:23] you're shocked by the thought in your
[45:24] mind. Amen. But it's not your thought.
[45:26] It's the devil's thought trying to drag
[45:28] you down and try and get you out of your
[45:29] lane. But you're running a race. Amen.
[45:31] So don't don't let that monkey grow on
[45:33] your back. Just kick him off because
[45:35] Amen. You got to realize no. The word
[45:37] says very different to that thought.
[45:40] Amen. So, so we can control, Amen. our
[45:45] thoughts. Forgiving others, it's in our
[45:48] power to forgive.
[45:50] You can't make someone forgive.
[45:53] You can try and teach children to say
[45:55] sorry, but they've got to mean
[45:57] it, right? Brother understands, you
[46:00] know, say sorry. Sorry. You
[46:05] know, you know, we can't you can't make
[46:09] someone say, you know what I mean? But
[46:11] but that's in the power of the person.
[46:14] You mean but I feel still I still feel
[46:16] hurt and pain from what they did. But
[46:18] are you in a position where you feel
[46:20] sorry for that person? You want to see
[46:21] that person in heaven. That to me truly
[46:24] means you've forgiven them. Absolutely.
[46:27] Amen. How I handle temptation, it's up
[46:30] to you.
[46:33] right? You know, it's like uh yeah,
[46:37] forgiving others, my effort to grow
[46:39] spiritually, that's in your hands. Oh,
[46:41] God's doing the work. What are you
[46:43] feeding? You know, it's like some people
[46:46] think it's almost like um you know,
[46:48] someone who who who lives at home and
[46:51] they've got a full stock pantry and a
[46:52] fridge and they say, "God, put the food
[46:55] in my
[46:57] stomach. It's all there." and they and
[46:59] they waste away, but they're praying.
[47:01] They believe God's going to really going
[47:02] to feed them. But God's given them the
[47:04] ability to open the pantry, maybe maybe
[47:08] burn some water on the stove, cook
[47:09] something, put something in a toast. You
[47:11] know, God's given the ability. He's
[47:13] given us the food and he's given us the
[47:15] desire for the food. So, why not open
[47:18] the
[47:19] pantry and eat?
[47:22] Amen. The devil doesn't want you to eat,
[47:25] but I think it's time to eat. get on
[47:27] your eating pants or eating skirts and
[47:29] just start eating the ones that stretch,
[47:31] you know. Anyway, uh so so that's that's
[47:34] in my control. My obedience to God is in
[47:37] my control. He doesn't make us a robot.
[47:39] He doesn't force us to do
[47:42] anything. Well, okay. The Jesus I know
[47:45] is a gentleman. He doesn't force me to
[47:47] do anything. He presents it to me and he
[47:50] says, "Whosoever will let him come. Here
[47:52] I am. I'm on your hands, Lord. Here I
[47:54] am, Lord. Change me, Lord. Hallelujah.
[47:58] But there's things outside of our
[48:00] control. So, we can control those
[48:01] things, but the future is outside of our
[48:05] control. Doors that are closed are
[48:07] outside our control. I was going to go
[48:08] through these quickly because we're we
[48:09] got uh prayer. Um suffering and trials
[48:11] are outside our control. But I can say
[48:14] what's in our control is how we handle
[48:16] the suffering and the trials. Do we say,
[48:18] "Lord, show me yourself in the trial or
[48:20] the suffering." Or do we just go through
[48:21] this and say, "Well, it's me." Amen.
[48:23] Persecution, criticism is outside our
[48:25] control. Unanswered prayers. So, so
[48:27] God's timing because we know God does
[48:30] always answer, but in his time that's
[48:32] out, that's outside our control. If you
[48:34] want to go into the permissive will of
[48:36] God, try and make him answer a prayer in
[48:38] your life. Amen. No one wants the
[48:40] permissive will of God. Amen. Delays and
[48:42] waiting seasons are outside our control.
[48:45] People's actions are outside our
[48:46] control. The timing of God's promises
[48:48] are outside our control. Other people's
[48:50] opinions are outside our control. and
[48:52] the past is outside our control. But we
[48:56] should place all those things in the
[48:57] hands of God. Amen.
[49:00] Amen.
[49:02] Now, this is really how we should run
[49:04] this
[49:05] race. Okay? Everyone's read
[49:09] that we should run this race. Okay? He
[49:12] says, "Never fight until you have to.
[49:14] But when it's time to fight, you fight
[49:15] like you're the third monkey on the ramp
[49:17] to Noah's ark. And brother, it's
[49:18] starting to rain. Mean only two monkeys
[49:20] can get in the ark. But you got to
[49:22] realize, no, I'm ordained to get in
[49:24] there. So that other monkeyy's got to
[49:26] get out. Amen. If I was the only male
[49:28] monkey getting in the ark, but there's
[49:29] another one in front of me. I don't care
[49:30] how big he is. I don't care how hairy he
[49:32] is. He's getting out of my way cuz I'm
[49:34] getting in the ark. Praise God. That's
[49:36] how we should walk with God. I mean, we
[49:38] shouldn't just say, "Well, if it's meant
[49:39] to be, it'll be and not not." No, we
[49:41] say, "Lord, press in. Press in, Lord.
[49:44] The promise is mine, Lord." I mean, like
[49:46] David when he, you know, his son that he
[49:48] had with Bashibba was dying. Did he just
[49:50] sit back and say, "Well, God, it's in
[49:51] your hands." He knew it was ultimately,
[49:53] but he prayed and fasted and sought the
[49:55] Lord that God would maybe turn his mind
[49:57] and, you know, give life back to the
[49:59] child. But when the child died, what did
[50:01] he do? He didn't, you know, he didn't he
[50:04] didn't he didn't fuss. He just he just
[50:06] washed himself, changed his clothes,
[50:07] went to the temple, and praised
[50:09] God. But he was fighting for the life of
[50:13] that child. But when that child died, he
[50:15] said, "Well, he can't come back here,
[50:17] but one day I'll go to him." He's in
[50:20] God's hands. Hope this is okay. Amen.
[50:24] But but this is how we should walk with
[50:25] God. Enemy gets in our way. He's getting
[50:28] out of the way. Amen. That promise is
[50:31] mine. Amen. Whatever it is, it's mine.
[50:34] And I'm not quitting till it till either
[50:36] God says yes or no. And if it says no,
[50:38] I'm happy with a no cuz it's God. Amen.
[50:42] That's how you Okay. Now just I'm just
[50:44] going to finish with this. He says this
[50:46] is this is in this third seal. He says,
[50:49] "Now I don't want to scare you. I don't
[50:50] think it's that way, but I just want to
[50:51] tell you what he said." And you know it
[50:54] yourself as it was in the days of Noah
[50:55] when eight souls were saved by water.
[50:57] Eight souls are out of the world by
[50:58] saved by water. Well, you say, "Oh my,
[51:00] there's no need of me trying." That
[51:02] shows you haven't got the kind of faith
[51:04] you need. If there's just going to be
[51:06] one, I'll it'll be me. Amen. because I
[51:10] believe. See, that's the way you want to
[51:13] believe it, too. Amen. Be uh be me.
[51:16] Sure. I want to live so close to him
[51:17] that I know he's coming. He's going to
[51:19] take me when he comes. I believe it.
[51:21] That's right. So, if there's if anybody
[51:23] else misses it, I'm going to be there by
[51:25] his grace cuz he promised me that. And I
[51:29] know that I'll be there cuz he can't
[51:32] lie. That's how you run. Certainly. It's
[51:34] not a well, if I do this and this, you
[51:36] know, somehow I've got it over the next
[51:38] person. No, he's anchored in my heart.
[51:40] He's coming back for me. And he can't
[51:43] lie.
[51:45] Amen. It's not See, see this is not a
[51:48] but but this is the kind of faith we
[51:49] should have if there's one going in
[51:52] Wellington.
[51:54] I don't believe it's just one. But I
[51:56] think we should have that kind of faith.
[51:57] Lord, if it's only me, I'm walking with
[51:59] you. You promise you're going to come
[52:00] and take me away, and you can't lie. My
[52:03] life is in your hands. You've fulfilled
[52:04] your word over and over again in my
[52:06] life, Lord. So, you're going to come and
[52:07] get me. This is how we should do it. We
[52:09] shouldn't shrink back when it speaks
[52:10] about these kind of things. We should
[52:12] say, "Lord, you have promised me you're
[52:15] coming to catch me away." Amen. And I
[52:18] know my soul and life bears record. And
[52:20] I try to live daily just as he was
[52:22] coming. So, I'm going to be that one.
[52:24] You say, "Well, how do you live like
[52:25] he's coming every day?" You just get up,
[52:26] commit your life to the Lord, go to
[52:29] school, go to work, come to church, go
[52:33] do your thing, you know, just live life.
[52:37] in the Lord.
[52:40] Amen. We're not we don't live in a
[52:42] monastery somewhere as a monk and now
[52:44] I'm ready. No, no. We are ready. He's
[52:46] put our souls in condition already.
[52:48] Amen. By the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[52:50] So live life. Have plans. Have long
[52:53] term. I've got long-term plans.
[52:56] Amen. I've got plans, man. If they don't
[52:59] happen, that's fine. If they do, I'll
[53:01] I'll enjoy them. Amen. But, you know,
[53:05] just walk with God. We can't just say,
[53:07] "Oh, the rapture is going to come,
[53:08] what's the point of planning for the
[53:09] future?" Plan for the
[53:11] future. This is why we have church.
[53:13] We're planning for the future. Amen. If
[53:15] I get old and um I'm no
[53:18] more. There's got to be someone who'll
[53:20] take my place. Just like everyone else
[53:22] or the older generation, right? That's
[53:24] why we have church. We're planning for
[53:27] the future. We believe in Oh, but does
[53:30] that mean you don't believe? No, it
[53:31] could be now. That's right. Glory. It's
[53:35] in his timing. I'm fine with his timing.
[53:38] Amen. So, I'm going to be that one.
[53:40] That's just the way I want to feel. If
[53:42] there's going to be eight, I'm going to
[53:43] be one of that eight. I'm going to live.
[53:45] Um, if it's going to be 500, I'm going
[53:46] to be one of that 500. Don't know about
[53:49] the other fellow, but I want to be one
[53:50] of that 500. See, that's the way you
[53:53] want to remember. See, and if you don't
[53:54] remember it like that, then there's
[53:56] something wrong with your faith. See,
[53:57] you're not sure you're saved yet. Then
[53:59] you just just guessing at it. Don't do
[54:01] that. All right. So let him anchor in
[54:03] your heart. Lord, you saved me. Lord,
[54:05] you're coming to carry me away. Amen.
[54:08] Then then then what can you do? You run
[54:10] this Christian
[54:12] life. I'm in it to win. I'm not in it to
[54:15] be an even in the top 10. I think
[54:17] there's 10. I don't know how many lanes
[54:18] there are. I'm in it to obtain the
[54:20] prize. Amen. Like the Apostle Paul. And
[54:22] just just in closing, the Apostle Paul
[54:25] knew a crown of life was laid up for
[54:26] him. So, he wasn't running this. He
[54:29] wasn't walking this walk haphazardly,
[54:30] seeing how it was going to pan out. He
[54:32] knew the end. He knew what's going to
[54:34] happen when he crosses the finish line.
[54:36] Who's going to be there to put the crown
[54:37] on his head? Amen. I believe we're in
[54:39] the same category. Aren't you? You
[54:41] believe you'll see him one day? Amen.
[54:43] The one who's been with you all your
[54:45] life and he's transformed you. He speaks
[54:47] to you. He walks with you in the good
[54:49] times, the bad times, the hard times.
[54:51] You know, his grace is sufficient in
[54:52] every season. You'll see him one day.
[54:55] Amen. And so I think let's let's g up
[54:57] the armor and let's run this race.
[55:00] You say, "Well, you feel you can't make
[55:02] it." He'll carry you. Amen. Don't Don't
[55:06] ever think that you can't you can't make
[55:08] it. The devil tells you you can't make
[55:10] it, but he's lying. God says in his
[55:12] word, you've already made it. Amen. So,
[55:15] let's run this race with certainty.
[55:17] Let's let's feed the Holy Ghost in our
[55:19] lives. Let's sew. Let's sew to the
[55:22] spirit. Amen. Let's sew to it and see
[55:25] what God will do. Amen. Feed the feed
[55:28] the feed the machine. Praise the Lord.
[55:30] Let's have the um let's have the
[55:33] musicians, please, tonight, can we?
[55:35] Well, let's uh sing a song and then
[55:37] we'll um yeah, go through the prayer
