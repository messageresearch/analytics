TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] so [Music] so [Music] do [Music] [Music] [Music] welcome to camp god bless you all great to have everyone here really thank you for coming have this weekend with us um i just got a few announcements we've gotta go through um yeah god bless god bless you all so in in the unlikely event of a fire um we need to all go congregate out on the field um you know we have to go through the camp things every every time but yeah so um no swimming please in the pool um it may be appear to be hot but it's not actually not that hot kitchen duties so um everyone should have been assigned to a duty you'll see by the door here into the dining room there is a list of duties and under each of those jobs there's the time which you need to be there so please go find out where you are and what you're doing and and please be punctual there um to help uh yeah they'd be greatly appreciated so then also the toilets if you need to use the bathroom um during service i advise just hold on but um you know you never want to miss what the lord can do but or will do but they're directly underneath the chapel you go down the ramp here hang a sharp left and go under and that's where the toilets are um and can we ask please can there be no playing kicking balls around in the gym after service because you want to keep an atmosphere in here and i believe the lord's going to do something i believe he's going to really do something powerful this weekend i mean and then also after the evening service um children i'm sorry but the playground is going to be closed because uh last camp you know a lot of kids are playing but mums are trying to put their babies to sleep and there's a lot of noise so please know in the playground after the evening service and then also after the evening service you know there's we're going to have supper so you know don't go wander off by yourself maybe more for the young people but you know don't go become one with nature somewhere by yourself wandering off you know have fellowship in the you know here or you know in the dining hall outside you know so don't just go wandering off um you know there's plenty of places to fellowship and also if you wish to go fishing in the lake uh you need to see brother mario and you also need to get a license and all that dutch to me so you'll see brother marion he will take you fishing pending his decision yay or nay um but yeah so that's uh essentially all of all of the messages i have but i believe we're in for a good time yes so once again just see what duty you're on what time it's it's all on the board there yeah i just want to read a quote before i turn the service over to to brother isaac brother abraham says and what shall i do with jesus called christ is in 1964 so after the seals have come open he says the dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the holy ghost that we have worked in a small measure while the headstone is coming down to unite with the body but when that head and body unites together the full power of the holy ghost would raise her up just exactly even the dead that's dead in christ for hundreds of years ago will rise in the beauty of his holiness and take a flight through the skies the dynamics is the holy ghost so i believe there's a season we're in the world has fallen apart and it's going to continue to fall apart but the bride's coming into order with the word hallelujah so i believe the dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the holy ghost and personally that's why i've come for this weekend lord would do something in my life and um you know this sign here to the world is a sign of defeat but to the christian this is a sign of victory as as moses hands were lifted up it was for the rest of israel to win the battle and then samson he pushed the pillars out did the same sign and he died with his enemy and they won a great victory and then our lord jesus was lifted up between heaven and earth his hands raised like this out of self will and he conquered hal death in the grave so i think what we should do before we start these meetings or say let's start these meetings right you know we don't need to wait for sunday night for god to touch our lives and change us what about right now before the service even begins and we can dedicate our hearts to the lord and you know we can just empty ourselves out so he can fill us up amen and he can do a great work so you know shall we just stand together and let's just let's just dedicate our lives to the lord let's just surrender our lives to lord tonight and if you have a knee just want to raise your hand to the lord jesus gracious heavenly father lord as we are so thankful lord jesus that we could come here this this weekend lord i pray your bless each one who has traveled lord some have traveled great distance lord to lord to be here and lord i pray o god that you touch each life lord as lord you've seen the hands that have been raised through this building lord jesus lord we invite you on this campground and lord not just to this campground but lord where we are right now lord we invite you o god we invite you lord jesus lord we just want to pray father we want to surrender our lives into your hands lord consecrate ourselves into your service lord lord what could happen in this kind of a service lord this kind of a meeting lord where your children gather lord

headstone you have coming down you are you you are uniting yourself with a people lord i just pray dear god may you have lord liberty in these meetings lord lord may he touch each life lord jesus and lord may eternal things be done in these services father for your glory may you grant it lord we commit the whole camp into your hands we commit our lives into your hands in jesus christ's name lord

home fellowship in stokes valley i've come to learn as a song leader that there's two things that i regret doing that's um letting all the brethren say hello and shake hands and opening it up for

tumors meningitis we we've seen it and and and we can say tonight my that we we believe and we believe in miracles we believe that god is still able amen to perform brother mighty great things and and and you you being here tonight it's a miracle i think one of the greatest miracles tonight that in the midst of what's happening around us that we can still stand that's that's the grace of god that you can stand in the midst of what's happening all around so much distractions and so many things happening personally in lives of people and you know what i always say for young people to be able to stand in this hour in time it is it is really something so we want to thank god tonight for just being here and i believe that we are going to receive a blessing this weekend the different ministries that god has raised up and uh so we are just so honored to be here and blessed to be a brother ben and thank you very much for inviting us and just i would have preferred setting but yeah we are here now so we'll just uh see what we can can do tonight so we can just stand and it's good to see you brother adrian i believe you've been been trapped but but but i think you had a good time also so we can just turn to uh acts chapter 3 acts chapter 3 and we just will just see where god takes us i might have all these notes but i said to my wife tonight before i came yet the whole i said i feel so incomplete i don't know what god wants tonight but i'm just going to see where god is going to lead us so we read in acts chapter 3 and we just want to read from verse 19 repent he therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the lord and he shall send jesus christ which before was preached unto you whom the heavens must receive until the times of restitution of all things i want you to note of all things which god hath spoken by the mouth of all these holy prophets since the world begun then we we just turn to ephesians 5 which is one verse of scripture there ephesians 5 and we just verse 25 and 26 and 27 husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it by the washing of the water by the word verse 27 is really what i want to take note on that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot nor wrinkle or any such thing but it should be holy and without blemish and just the last scripture matthew chapter 17 i believe this is the hour that we are living in i believe everything has been restored now we are just awaiting the going away hallelujah so uh we just want to read matthew 17. we've been we've been looking at this uh scriptures for some weeks now some months and uh yeah it's been really just so tremendous what god has been doing in this hour and time and so we just rejoice that uh very soon amen god is gonna is going not going to he's having a people on the earth right now that will fulfill this scripture here he him the bible says and after six days jesus taketh peter james and john his brother bringing him into an high mountain apart and was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun and his raiment was white as the light and behold they appeared unto him moses and elias talking with him then answered peter and said unto jesus lord it is good for us to be here if thy world let us make the three tabernacles one for thee one for moses and one for elias and while he yet spoke behold a bright cloud overshadowed them behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved son in whom i'm well pleased to please hear him amen he's passed the test he's been proven he's the right kind of a son now god is now presenting brother branham says god is now presenting jesus christ and he's now stepping back and he says hear him amen i believe that is where we are amen church that god is one of these days again to push us forward and say yeah he him whatever he says i will honor that so can we just pray loving father we've read your word and we just ask of you tonight that you will just help us you know some of your people tonight is tired they've had a hard day lord and we are here tonight and we just want to ask of you to direct us lead us guide us that we might just say something that will encourage someone make us realize who we are where we come from where we're going to and be so thankful for this evening time light you send us a prophet lord and god to restore turn our hearts back to the faith of the pentecostal father so this evening we ask you will just bless whatever shall be said and done for your glory and honor in jesus name amen you may be seated in the presence of the lord tonight i want to like result little thought it's uh quarter to nine we'll try and get out of here as soon as we can i want to speak on a little thought tonight i will restore all things i will restore all things and i was looking at that word restitution and it means the restoring of something stolen or lost back to the proper owner we thank god for this hour and time that there is nothing else that must be restored everything has been restored malachi 4 said it himself with the restoration of the word came the restoration of the power now you tonight might say brother i don't see any power in my life to fulfill the scripture but i want to tell you some way there is someone fulfilling that scripture might not be you you might not be there yet but there are some people out there believers that is fulfilling that scripture experiencing the power of the world so i'm so grateful tonight that amen our hearts have been turned uh god sent us a prophet our hearts have been turned and we just want to just read this quickly brother branham says uh this is what malachi 4 5 and 6 says he says behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and the dreadful day of the lord and he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers lest i come and smite the earth with a curse there is absolutely no doubt that eli elijah must must return before the coming of jesus because he has a specific work to accomplish and that work is the part of malachi 4 6 that says he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers the reason that we know that this easy specific work to do at that time is because he has already accomplished the part that says he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children that's john the baptist ministry brother banham says the bible says uh he says he shall go before him luke 1 17 and he shall go before him in the spirit and power of elijah to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make really a people prepared for the lord he says in the ministry of john the hearts of the fathers were turned to the children he says we know that because jesus said so but it does not say that the hearts of the children were turned to the fathers that is yet to take place that was then still had to take place the hearts of the last day children will be turned back to the pentecostal fathers john god the fathers ready for jesus to welcome the children into his fold now this prophet upon whom the spirit of elijah falls will prepare the children to welcome back jesus christ so we thank god amen that we have received the ministry we have received the word we thank god that there were some seeds lying there in this age amen and when the word came forth brother it quick and brother branham says never quit came to quicken the dust although the dust enrapped the seed but he says he came the sun came to quicken the life and i thank god rather when we were all running the world when we were doing our thing outside there that seed was already there hallelujah it didn't come when god saved you no it was already there when we were all sitting in the pub and gambling dice and doing what we did that see it's already there you might not understand why something about the word attracted to you was because there was a life there in you i remember when i was walking brother coming from the pub and there was men preaching the gospel and i just found myself standing listening to the gospel my buddies were all telling me to come along they're drunk but there was something there that arrested me something had apprehended me i couldn't move and this went on for years but brother one day hallelujah one day praise his holy name that seed came to life and here i am since 1960 you felt like throwing in the towel sometimes of course don't look at me as if you didn't feel that way of course we're human we all felt at times when the pressure came upon us and we had to make choices we felt man this is this is this is not for me but it was something that held us something keep holding me every day i see is a reality something keep holding me so what a glorious hour we find ourselves living what a glorious brother bands is a glorious time he says sayers and and the sages were looking for a time like this but here we are god is now in his people in the person of the holy ghost and he's now veiled hallelujah hidden behind human skin brother ban says the outside look like a holy roller but he says on the inside there's god hallelujah paul put so beautiful he says that he says there's a treasure in earthen vessels and rather in this frail body of ours almighty god is living no longer the size of a white button no longer the size of your fingernail that was when he came in but now he's grown now he's big now he's mighty living in me and you and by him growing he has now pushed out the human part he has pushed out the parts brother that's giving him us so much trouble in this walk but god has been growing so now he's veiled brother hallelujah in me and you and this is the hour that he's got to be veiled there is no any more time after this this is the hour brother that brother brad at the bible say they will be on the earth a glorious church she will be without spot she will without wrinkles she will be without any blemishes and i'm looking at them you might tonight look at your failures your mistakes your faults your shortcomings but god does not look at you and me the way we and the enemy wants you to see yourself as a failure wants to see you as a brother as with these complexes that has imprisoned us for years but now we're so glad that god has opened up our understanding i want to read a little quote here i don't know maybe this quote will just set you free just said this quote set me free have you ever never read it as a private interview the brandon had with his sister bruce amen and he's having this intima and because she had a problem she was looking at herself and she saw a failures and brother bam says sister bruce don't look at yourself don't look at yourself he says i'm fixing to pray for you he says i'm i'm not worthy of that this is this is our prophet eh i'm not worthy of that i think what what would i do if jesus was sitting here now now can you imagine brother branham is sitting there since the bruce is sitting here they're having this conversation and he's telling you now what if jesus was now sitting here and you were sitting the side he says what would he do he would lay his hand upon you and with his great faith see you would get well well he says well probably says well i'm a sinner i'm not him but i come to represent him but remember me being a sinner but before god i am not a sinner neither are you he says you've got a blood sacrifice laying there god don't even see us he hears our voice but he sees the blood of jesus he sees the blood of christ that's it he sees the blood of his own son it's our voice but it's christ's blood [Music] then he says it's christ that's talking through me that's true so therefore we are not sinners no more hallelujah oh my he says we are christians and he talk looks this is the bruce and he says i believe you're a genuine christian woman then she said something that many of us often say i make so many mistakes and i failed god so many times that's what we all say but i want to encourage you and then looks at them and says that's why christ had to die because of your mistakes because of your failures he says that's the reason why christ had to die so that you with your mistakes it won't be allotted to you it won't be allotted to you man hallelujah because brother bam says when he when he when he dips it into that bleach he says that son brother goes right back to the guy that caused you to do the thing yes sir so he is all your failures your sin it's all on him but you are free he says he took your mistakes your desire in your heart is to serve him and says the bruce says yes so your desire in your heart to serve him i've seen i see very few no we don't shake our heads we open our mouths and we say praise god brother [Applause] hallelujah he says your brother he says that's why he died for you so that you could serve him your mistakes are not looked at it's not allotted to you he is your propagation he is your sin offering your sins are not known you're not the sinner before god he says christ took your sins and became you because your desire is to serve him oh my i am that's my desires brother hallelujah and many times when i fail him i says god you know my desires you know my longest and i say lord i'm so glad that you know all things about me because then you know about me you know about me hallelujah oh my says you before god you're not a sinner christ took your sins and became you and sister bruce now says but i've never had an experience that i have been fold with the holy ghost so that i can put my foot on it okay brother braham says notice this ordinarily a human being is being born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies that's the nature of the human being and sister bruce says yes that was your nature brother branham says to her but he changed once but what changed it christ there you are sister hallelujah he says you are a christian sister bruce with the failures with the mistakes with the shortcomings he says you are a christian sister bruce i have watched your life i've watched you under vision and i know you're a christian not one [Music] speck your failures your mistakes your shortcomings and brother malachi forces men not one god don't see not one speck not one spec now i'm talking to born again i'm not talking about to those that have come into the message and just gone the two stages justification sanctification haven't you taken that gone into that birth i'm not talking about i'm not talking to those because your son is still very much alive before god but he says once you have been born again when your soul has been regenerated hallelujah you see not your flesh the flesh guy can never be saved this flesh guy is a sinner he's an animal so brother we're not talking about the flesh guy we're talking about the inward man that's been regenerated that has got a new nature and that new nature is manifested in the spirit that you produce that new nature because your your soul is the spirit as the nature of your of your spirit so so god comes and he changes the inside of you brother gives you new desires gives you new longings if you still desire the world then we need to check up why the desire for the world why i must so easily swayed and persuaded and attracted why i'm being influenced from a bottom and not from the top we need to look at these things we cannot sweep it under the carpet you cannot hope for it you cannot wish for it it's got to be a reality in your life that you have been born again you've been baptized with the holy ghost brother and you are growing in the grace of our lord jesus christ so your new birth doesn't just stop no it's a constant growing and it's a constant desire for more of god doesn't matter what you go through doesn't matter what the trials you go through you say god my yearnings and my desires is after you more of you more of you i tell you tonight church that is should be every one of our desires for more of you hallelujah hallelujah oh my the problem got a little quote that i just want to finish off here probably now says talking about the church now the heavens are containing him cannot come can't come down to come and pick us up because we need everything need to be in order everything needs to be in order and brother barron now talks about the church that she was when paul came on the scene he said she was already a fallen woman okay in the resume of the church ages now she is not this message for a church first of all it's not turning our hearts it's not taking us back to pentecost but it's taking us back to pentecost plus it's taking us back to eden that's where this message has taken us back to eden like we were before the fall now brother bannon says the birth of the church was at pentecost he says as the first adam was given a bride he says fresh from the hand of god and she was undefiled for a brief span so was christ the last adam he says was given a bride she was pure and she was fresh at pentecost and she remained separate and undefiled for some time and the rest just not no man joined himself to them acts 5 13 and the lord added to the church daily such as should be saved now brother bam says how long this continued we don't know this is the church he's coming for but one day even as eve was tempted and seduced by satan so the church was contaminated by the entrance of an antichrist so what brother venom is saying when he restores this church me and you is not restoring us brother as such to pentecost but what he's saying is restoring us to a people that was before she fell before she became contaminated when these things were happening in the church no man could add himself to the church no man can just walk in and say i'm in the message it had to be god by that power that was in the church so she was a clean church she was a pure church she was a church full of love she was a church that brother brother balaam says when they heard that someone was going to die they said let us go with him and die with him that was what was in that church age before she fell and this i believe brother that we are going to have that kind of a church that's the one that's going to be on the earth when he comes that's the one brother that they will have such a love in their hearts for one another that's the kind and i can see it's happening amongst god's people brother we are starting to prefer one another we are starting now to lift up one another we are starting now by his grace brother to give off ourselves for their sakes that's the church and i'm so glad i am looking the angels one time brother bran says ask the lord why are you going back to earth what are you going to do on earth and then malachi 4 said and the lord said to him i'm going for a people and i'm thank god i'm looking at that people tonight brother and sister i'm looking at that people tonight and i thank god brother for the hour that we are living he says now recognizing your day and his message he says now the seventh angel's message is to open the mystery of the seals now we know these things okay he says calling the 11th hour gentile workers to receive the same pain that the first hour worker got he said jesus taught it he said there was some some people that went into the harvest they were hired and when they did it was early morning they received time a penny for the day and then at noon time someone else come in and went to work and then at the 11th hour that's the last hour of the day that someone come in and receive the same kind of pay that they did at the first hour of the day problems it's the last hour he says it is so perfectly how that the first hour messengers were the word with the gospel with the truth they came it in at the day of pentecost then there was a dark age that blocked them out then at the middle of the day luther and wesley and them came in then there is to be an evening time message and to receive the same thing that they did at the beginning the evening time messenger is to restore back again to bring back the same thing again not a new thing the same life the same power the same anointing brother oh this this is what being restored back praise his holy name amen i tell you tonight brother sister man that we brother bam says he if the word of god is spoken out of the lips of a human being he says and that word materializes he says what kind of a people will that be what kind of a church will that be brother hallelujah when god will honor what you say hallelujah that's why i believe tonight if you're not talking to your body you better stop talking to your body hallelujah tell your body i'm the boss you are not the boss hallelujah you see many times he just roll over you're hurting me this side says okay kick me this side by time brother and sister that we rise up man [Music] with that authority that is given us that we rise up rather hallelujah and declare to the enemy who you are now listen he's not going to take your word for it you're not going to take your word for it but you brother bam says you need to speak it just the same speak it tell the enemy i'm drawing a line in the sand this is my home this is my children this is my marriage this is my family you ain't coming here in my home yes sir you see we're so scared man hey we're so scared of the enemy instead of using our authority that god has given unto you just try it just tell the devil just call him i'm drawing a line devil i'm drawing a line and you ain't not coming not further than you ain't coming you're not crossing this bloodline but you need to know what you're talking about [Applause] you need to know him personally you see we are we are losing our children to the world we are losing our young people why because we are not bold enough to declare what the words say about you brother we have been restored back to authority to dominion to power we restored back and i want to tell you tonight church you need to start exercising yourself in what god has restored to exercise yourself you need to take god at his word hallelujah take god at his word and start exercising and telling the enemy this is as far as you come you're not coming any further you've messed up my home you've messed up my family you've messed up my marriage my children are gone but i'm rising up i'm rising up hallelujah i'm rising up and i'm taking control i've always been under your control now i'm taking back control i'm taking back authority by time that we start doing these things brother is messing up our children it's messing up our marriages as crumbling because we would allow the enemy just to do what he wants to do but i'm thank god this evening brother brother ben says there's going to be a bride and there's going to be a waiting supper amen served in the skies that is just as sure to be as god is because it is his word and we know that those that are going to make up that bride is going to be his church and they are going to appear before him without spot or wrinkle and they have the material on earth now to make themselves ready if he says if you notice he said she made herself ready and so many will say lord if you will take this evil spirit from me from drinking or gambling or lying or stealing i'll serve him but the prophet said that is up to you you've got to do something too they that overcome shall inherit all things and i just want to add there brother when he talks about they will sit with him in his throne because they've overcome as he has overcome but the prophet of god said that spot is only reserved for the queen that place he says you can pray you can fast you can scream you can repent but he says that place is only reserved for his queen how do you become his queen by becoming the word like he is the word that is who's gonna sit in his throne and brother bam says you gotta do something too they that overcome shall inherit all things they that overcome he says you have the power to do it he says the power is in the church right now to bind sickness and cast it out the power is in the church right now to take sin blind throw it under your feet [Music] it's in the church right now it's not coming the world has already been restored the power has already been restored so it's in the church brother take a hold of it i wanted to say tonight if there's anything that you get tonight out of this message rise up and take what is yours [Applause] rise up and take what is your inheritance hallelujah he says god you see god cannot push you through a little pipe pull out the other side and then say blessed is he that overcometh he says you had overcome nothing he just pushed you through but he says you have got to make you've got to make jesus your decision you will make your decision yourself i have to make a decision for myself he says in doing that we show our faith and respect to god you have to do it yourself not lord will you do this for me will you do that for me this is you rising up by the holy ghost brother bam spears he talks talks in the standing in the gap and he spoke about how the holy ghost commanded brother branham for making his own choice because thou has walked you've chosen the narrow part the hard way he says thou has walked in your own choosing now i can see that moses had to make his choice too he says thou has speak the precise and the correct way you made a correct decision and it is my way brother damn says and the holy ghost underlined my way you underline my way this is the holy ghost speaking back because of this momentous decision of making your choice you're going to serve god or you're not going to serve god you're going to walk with him or you're not going to walk with him your choice what you you choose you choose and brother and and the prophecy was and says you chose the narrow way the hard way but it's my way it's my way so hallelujah we are not brother some dumb driven beast we are not some driftwood that is going with the flow and wherever where do you live i don't know where are you going i don't know where's your home where i hang my head brother bran says that's driftwood no direction no dream no goal no ideal just drifting he says and when you become a driftwood you're drifting along stream's highway he sees them someday some sand banks down the stream and he says once you drift that's a piece of driftwood you're gonna hit that sandbank and he says and that sand bank is going to hold you because you've got no power to drive yourself out of that sandbank but it says once you've got the power of god in you and he says and the storms of life take you that you hit draftwood and hit the sandbanks he says you got power within you he said you take the same wood and put a motor to that and you see what happens there's so many of us drifting too many of us drifting got no direction we've all retired some of us are sitting in our retirement homes retired i've tried brother it's so hard you see many times you hang out with the wrong group you hang out with the wrong crowd you hang out with no witness you hang out brother with those that also tried and brother they tell you i tried i tried to live holy but it doesn't work out i i try to serve god brother you know but it doesn't work out now you hang out with those guys now what do you think is going to happen to you when you hang out with those kind of people negative no joy i i tell the church back home if you find somebody next to you that's not worshipping god find someone else get up there don't stick around there get up and go find another place and sit next to somebody that can worship sit next to somebody that's got some joy sit next to somebody brother that got some hallelujah [Applause] don't sit with them don't hang out with them before you know it you'll be like them you find them skipping and jumping when they are single and the minute they get married marry your wife you find them sitting at the back can i preach it brother andy i don't know what they become so miserable they become a sad sex because they married i sit at the back and of course and when the kids come the one who's got the pants here the other one has got the jack totally lost it malachi 4 said brother if you marry your wife and you got a wife okay let's talk about a girlfriend you got a girlfriend right and if your life doesn't become more spiritual there's something wrong with your choice something wrong with your choice man hallelujah yes brother we see we see it man we pastors we we see it where these guys man is just joy is gone maybe they were jumping in front you to attract the attention of some sister and they are foolish enough to fall for that muscles six-pack sleek day smell remember the venom oscar i was a young sister why are you marrying that guy he's got such nice small feet i'll tell you this we are we inferring we're chatting the other days this man i think there's something wrong we never prepared our young people for the world we never prepared our young people when they go out there into unis high school jobs we never prepared our young people the world for them outside there we we thought our young people is kosher holy they can they they can they can overcome the delilahs not a chance let me tell you now even with the holy ghost even though the holy ghost if you are not grounded and rooted in christ the world is going to take you so with the holy ghost in church singing song i i asked this church a question on tuesday night is the church will they find enough evidence to convict you as a christian will they find enough evidence i'm not about church church you can you'll have all the evidence that you're a christian but i'm talking church when you're out there because anybody can be a christian in church anybody can sing hallelujah praise the lord read songs brother you can do whatever you do but will the world find enough evidence to convict you that you are a christian that you are a believer that's a question you need to answer is there enough evidence about your life how you live not message cliches not saying what the message say but living even when there's nobody that recognize you as a christian even when there's nobody around you but there's something about integrity there's something about integrity that will keep you job said my mouth even when i was going through those trials this is my mouth i kept my mouth i didn't say anything that would hurt my god or my lord and i want to say tonight to you young people choose a right friends to hang out with someone that's strong as a christian that can help you but if you hang out with those guys that's weaker than you you're going to end up like them you're going to end up like them so i want to say this evening to you god has restored the power in the church power to listen you have been ordained predestined to live a holy life god has predestinated you to live a holy overcoming life why can't we live a holy overcoming life why can't we and if we surrender to him then life becomes easy as a christian god didn't mean for christian life to be such a difficult bore didn't mean that amen brother this joy this joy unspeakable hallelujah when you go through the deepest of trial god is able to keep you buoyant god is able brother don't bring my god down to your level [Applause] my god is able [Music] to lift you to keep you clean to keep you walking before him circumspectly god is able don't bring my god down to your level don't do that but let's lift him up man declare brother our god is awesome hallelujah so there's more this evening church amen just to encourage you a little bit i leave the rest to brother adrian and to this other brethren hallelujah so just to encourage you this evening brother to let you know man that you have to make a decision you cannot let somebody coerce you into it if you have made if somebody has coerced you and spoken you into it somebody's going to speak out of it hallelujah brother if someone have talked spoken you into it and that's the reason why so many are walking away from this message somebody spoke them into it hallelujah and now they walked away from truth and i want to say tonight no matter if you telling me brother i'm going to another church let me tell you the day you walk away from truth that's the day you walk away from god because if you want to walk with god you've got to walk in truth so if you walk out of truth then i want to tell you that's where you all walk with god's walk stop that's where it's separated hallelujah so when you when you then because then you're on your own you know can you imagine the remorse said to the church last week can you remember imagine the remorse if god should allow it when we stand before him and here malachi 4 walks out and stands with his group and god allowed those guys that walked away from this message and called malachi a false prophet god allow them to see your malachi force taking his place with us can you imagine the remorse can you imagine the remorse that they will have when they finally see this message was truth hallelujah so church we so thankful to god tonight that we have truth i'm so grateful to god brother that god has come my way if i tell you the story of my life eh how that god called me i was i was a pastor i was a church i had a church back in the denomination and god calls me god walked past everybody and he comes to me and he presents me a book and the name of the book was indictment i had to read that book indictment and when i read that book i threw it behind the wardrobe couldn't handle what malachi 4 was saying about what i believed and then two days down the line i moved the water take the book out because there was something working within me until finally brother god help me to accept truth and when i accept the truth i had to go to my church and tell them i've accepted truth and i'm baptized in the name of of course you know what happened they booted me out they booted me out of church but i want to say tonight to you church that when god brother bam says when god shows you the picture there is nothing else brother that you see but that picture of who malachi 4 is and what he has come to do now just for a few minutes can i just speak a little bit on galatians 4. the bible says now i say that the a as long as this child does not differ at all from a slave though he is master of all but he is under guardians and stewards unto until the time appointed by the father even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of time had come god sent forth his son born of a woman born under the law to redeem those who are under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because you are sons this didn't make you sons but because you are sons god that sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying abafa therefore you are no longer a slave but a son and if a son then an a of god through christ now at thy word he says i believe we all baptize with the holy spirit and brought into the body and then we become sons but then after suns there's a placing of sons or the adoption of sons he says a son is born in israel then after eight days he was circumcised and became an israelite but he was born of the father and then if that child was given a tutor galatians tells us that after he was raised to a certain age and he became faithful to the father's work and everything he was a very fine boy and was eligible to fall air now brother brahm says the father didn't know what he would be when he was born he might be a gangster he might be slothful in his father's business and god couldn't turn his kingdom and he sings and his work over to that boy but when he has proved to be the right boy and the tutor which in our case is the holy spirit that takes word to the father and gives a report of what we do then if we be found faithful for so long like the child was then he was taken out in a public square and a purple robe was put on him and there was a law of adoption then that boy was adopted by the same father who gave him birth and he was brought into the family and then he wasn't only a son but he was heir coheir with the father of every position he had now church we realize as i said earlier that heaven is going to release him according to acts chapter 3 heavens is containing him until everything has been restored until sonship has been restored not what i say but what i am and how i live and my behavior and my conduct because that entitles us to adoption how i behave myself how my conduct as a son brother bam says that father don't know if his son is going to be a gangster or if he's going to be a roused about so what he needs to do he needs to and that is what you've been going through the bible says brother when jesus in the book of mark chapter 1 when jesus rose out of the water and he says and the dove came and declared and says this is my beloved son in whom i'm pleased to dwell the bible says then that same holy ghost to go up and drove him into the wilderness that same gentile dove that just declared this is my beloved son the bible says the holy ghost took a whoop and drove him to prove his sonship because god cannot brother entrust that's why malachi 4 said that jesus christ in every word he had to be tried like me and you he was a man he couldn't be married he could have had a home but barbara bam said but he sanctified he did it for my sake for your sake proved by his life that he loved brother that we are able that's why the bible says he's our high priest he can be touched with our feelings because he knows what me and you are going through as we are going through our wilderness experiences right from the day that you were born again baptized with the holy ghost the holy ghost drove you into the wilderness and you have been there ever since and one of these days we're going to walk out and one of these days brother he's going to declare this is my son he's passed the test he's passed the test he's proven himself to be the right kind of son he's proven himself in all his ways that he's busy with a father's business i'm telling you tonight church might be sound like fables but i want to say how can god now some believe that when they are born again they're adopted yes the potential the seed everything is in you every apple that that tree is going to bring forth it's in that little spring and you plant it everything that that tree was gonna become was in that little spring and everything that you are gonna become was placed in you by the baptism of the holy ghost still a baby still struggling to walk falling and getting up but that seed of the potential of who god has ordained you to be was in you right then now trials come now situations arise now is the time of testing now you have to prove who you really are and that's where many fail brother brahms is in in a little quote i'm going to stop now he says many try to do john 14 12 before the reflection of christ is in them he says how he says and that's the reason so many christians ministers are lying he says on the sidewalk he says lying on the shores of life he says they are crumbled wrecks because they try to produce john 14 12 without having the reflection of jesus christ in them brother this is the hour and the time for john 14 12. the whole creation is groaning into a veil waiting for those sons to be made manifest and i'm telling you this is the most glorious time the most wonderful time when brother banham says they will be born sons true sons full sons they will speak and it will flash like lightning brother bram said she's on the border of it right now and that was i think 60 years ago so if it does on the board then where are we now where are we now are you the right kind of son or are you rushed about or are you against what is your qualifications i'm challenging you tonight as i had to challenge myself when god started dealing with my life with these things brother malachi 4 says man he says how can that box call you remember that box cart where brother bam says when they park back that box cart how the inspector comes along and now the inspector look at the box examine it to see if everything was packed tight he says because he dare not seal that box card unless everything is packed in order and i want to say god will never adopt me and you if my life and your life does not line up with a word very serious hour a very very serious time hallelujah that we are living in and we need to by the grace of god church we need to get into that spot where he will be able to proudly take me aside and visit me with an angel and says i have found him to be faithful now i give him signing power now i give him rights problem says when when someone comes and tell you brother i need a rain my crops are dying when you rise up and it's your brother i give you rain brother i curse the locusts and it must obey i tell you brother what an hour what a time that this little bride she's coming to she is not just here jumping and skipping that's all part of it but brother when she's rooted and grounded and god in you and you only oh my some quotes i want to read you but i can believe that we probably have says you are so enveloped so embodied with god so embodied with him so infused with him he says that when you speak it's deity speaking that's where we are and that's what he's waiting on for us to get in order brother ben that the heavens can release him because restitution everything has been restored back that was in eden hallelujah all of it all of it restored back and she will walk brother hallelujah tell the river move a little bit that way tell the tree uplift yourself and plant you there man this is not fables this is realities this is real this is a real man this is so real brother and sister hallelujah and i trust tonight just to encourage you amen that you might be just saying brother that is what i want i haven't come this way just to be in the message i didn't leave my church and had to separate my family and and my loved ones i didn't just come that way just to be in the message i've come i said brother bam says i've come brother to produce jesus christ once more to this world that once more this world will hear thus saith the lord or she will keep stone this world once more is going to have a shaking as the power of god is made manifest in the lives of his people malachi 4 came back with an evidence hallelujah came back with the evidence in actual fact he was the evidence that brother that is a restored people he was the first wave chief that could speak to the bull malachi forces when he faced that bull he says a voice from the inside he said i was just speaking to that bull like i'm speaking to you now but he says there was a he says i went for my gun and there was no gun he said i would have shot him and then i would have gone to pay for him but he says something happened came over me hallelujah and he says i found myself speaking i'm sorry mr buu he says i never would have done that i'm sorry mr buu i'm so sorry i trespassed on your property so sorry about that and as malachi 4 spoke brother oh my the bull had second thoughts he heard adam he heard the master of nature speaking brother says when he saw those hornets was sitting on him all over him he said he started talking to them he says i don't want you kissing me now he says go back to your way you come and he says god is my witness he says they all raised of my body and they all went back he says when he spoke to little fishy he said he said i felt believed from the heart he says i felt he says the energy he says the branch was energized by the vine he says i found something happening in me and he says and something came out says little fishy i give you back your life this is what is awaiting us this is a restored adam this brother is the manifestation of the sons and the daughters of god and this is what the devil is trying to block but he's a liar he cannot defeat the purpose of god he tried to stop he tried to bring trials and failures mistakes but listen let me tell you tonight it can't stop god's sons and daughters coming forth and declaring who they are hallelujah i'm an i'm a son of god brother i'm a daughter of god and all power is in me hallelujah deity in you not some downtrod please understand you're not some downtrodden thing that the enemy is trying to let you know you are he says you are deity you're a son of god you're a daughter of god then walk like grandson and daughter of god walk like daughters of god put your shoulders back and stop walking like the defeaters stop walking like a dab in the world on your shoulders may god bless you can we pray father we're just so thankful for these few words of just to encourage your people so much gloom and doom around us so much bad news the news the headlines is
