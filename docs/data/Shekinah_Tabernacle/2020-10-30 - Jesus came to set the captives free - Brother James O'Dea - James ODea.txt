TRANSCRIPT
========================================
i just want to say a little bit about the song before i sing it because i actually wrote the song about a year ago and i've never sung it before just so it's never worked out and i just believe that it was for this time and just going in line with what that has been preached and um the burden for the song come for the youth after hearing questions like well i don't really know if there is a god or i don't understand god and it's just a real burden that come upon my heart to write this song you know and jesus came to set the captives free and there can be small things in your life children you know what a captive is right a cat that's a prisoner and things can change you that are maybe just small things but jesus can set you free of that thing you know and god is real we see him in the resurrection you know we see the we see a seed goes down into the ground and it comes back again and you say well i don't know if god can heal me but you see a branch on a tree and the wind blows and that branch breaks and it's hanging down but it doesn't just die and fall off that branch heals itself and it and it grows with that sap around it and now that heel of that wound becomes stronger than it was before and you try to break that branch again it'll break somewhere else because you get stronger jesus came to set the captives free [Music] when it seems like everything's a mystery dark clowns build around you and your questioning remember god is revealed in simplicity just walk with him and you will see that jesus came to set the captives free my chains are loosed i now walk free he walks with me i have the victory jesus came and set this captive free so don't be down cause you had the victory christ is here living in you and me if you want to see his power then stay around me the same things he did i am manifesting cause jesus came to set the captives free my chains are loosed i now walk free he walks with me i have the victory jesus came and said this cat captive free so don't be weary with your face to the ground jesus has risen and he's here with us now so lift your eyes and you will see jesus christ is setting his bride free this is king to set the captives free my chains are loosed i now walk free he walks with me i have the victory jesus came and set this cat it free now we can walk in victory what jesus did was for you and me so tell those chains they have been broken jesus paid the cross and he gave the toll as he came to said the cat is free my chains are loosed i now walk free he walks with me i have the victory jesus came and said this captive free oh jesus came to set the captives free my chains are loosed now walk free he walks with me i have the victory jesus came to set this cat to free yes jesus came to say [Music] i see jesus christ setting his bride free amen hallelujah
