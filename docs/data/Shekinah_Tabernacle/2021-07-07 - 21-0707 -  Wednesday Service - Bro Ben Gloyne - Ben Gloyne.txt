TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] music welcome to the house of the lord i see we are dwindling in numbers it's uh winter it's cold and just a lot going on everywhere by here you can kick your shoes off and you can come and relax in the presence of our king amen that's why we're here and you mean it's good to get taught it's good to to learn something new and get shown something new and if you have any questions that the lord will answer them for you but the best thing you can do is rest in the presence of the lord amen uh just a couple of formalities before we start with this whole sickness and illness we we have a couple of prayer requests we want to first bring before we even do anything we've got sister barbara see the message just came on the church noticeboard so i don't know she went into the doctor and she's got appointment tomorrow with him and they're just requesting prayer for her looks like it could be something with the heart and we know there's only one that can heal the heart hey and that's the law amen and then we've got another one for um brother phil and sister belinda so they asking that we would pray for them so their car keys could be found and quite important if you don't have your keys so we pray with them that they can find it and then they've got holly and her husband there tonight tony and they just ask that we'll also pray for them that they would hear the word of god you know and they would just walk a bit closer to him and then sister christine is safely home after operation and she's she's getting stronger by the day so we just pray for healing there as well really important and then sister londy said thank you for the priest for of for her family her brother's back home now the stomach is better and he's got no medication for it and he would just keep on praying for him for his strengthening and getting him back on the on his feet it's pretty scary in south africa to go to the hospital these days because you don't know which one you're going to end up in and they're not all the better ones so so we'll pray for those individuals if there's any needs if there's anything you you desire of the lord this is where we bring it before him anything big small as it might even be insignificant but it could be something that locks something up open for you which always been hidden and then the lord can bring healing and restoration and so if you all maybe just stand i just want to read a scripture tonight it's just something that was on my heart and i thought it might sound like a heavy scripture but it's not and then we'll open in a word of prayer it says in 1 timothy 6 verses 10 it says for the love of money is the root of all evil which while some coveted after they have heard from the faith and pierce themselves through with many sorrows but thou o man of god o sister of god i can say flee from these things and follow after righteousness goodness faith love patience and meekness fight the good fight of faith lay hold to eternal life where unto thou art so called and has professed a good profession before many witnesses this walk is our walk regardless how we feel how we look even how people see us just hold on to the good things hold on to faith hold on to hope to love to peace keep the good things in your life there's enough bad things out there keep all the good here so it will help you to stand in this perilous times amen don't chase off the things that at the end of the day the pavement in heaven is made out of it gold can get you anywhere but god he'll get you there the bible says fear not the one that can destroy the body but can destroy the body and the soul so let's just go before that one and we just ask him to be with us tonight our gracious heavenly father lord we come before you just humbly and ask to help us one more evening lord just one more time this could be the the last evening on this earth lord this could be the first evening in our walk with you lord lord i pray that you'll just bless this evening and be with us father lord i ask that you would keep us here lord that our mind will be here stayed upon you not wander there in the world lord but that we can actually come tonight before the almighty sovereign god and say lord jesus you have preeminence lord you take control lord and this is your evening lord this is all for you lord and we just come before you and say lord we lay ourselves down we ask that you will just take this evening and do something special for us lord made leave human control lord lord i know we're just listening to a tape lord and it's the fourth seal lord but so important to know where we stand where we are lord and what is ahead of us lord and and lord as we come here tonight we ask that you would minister to us lord that you will teach us something new and and and walk with us a little bit more like you walk with those on the way to emmaus lord you see all these prayer requests in front of us lord lord we're not exempt from these things lord but we know that you're the healer lord we know that you're the conqueror lord we know that you are sovereign god and the healing only comes from you a doctor can set the bone lord but you bring the healing lord doctors give up and they say we don't know what's wrong with your son or daughter or even with you but lord that's when you start dealing lord you are amazing god and there is no end to your love and there is no end to your mercy and there is no end to your power there is no end to your glory there is no end to you lord jesus for you are just all over us lord and all around us and in us and with us and and everything as far as the eye can see and not see that's you lord lord even to see lord and has seen before lord nothing's new upon this earth everything is you the whole plan of redemption is you lord before the world even began the lamb was slain lord can people not see that you have it all in your hands all of it lord hence why we find ourselves here tonight lord jesus come and say we love you lord we just come and spend some time with you tonight lord and as you see those prayer requests sister belinda brother full lord they're looking for those keys father guide them there so they can find it lord lord it is hard not to have a vehicle and to do things lord so just help them find that lord and also as they fellowship with people lord guide the conversation lord strengthen sister christine we pray for her steve landy's brothers strengthen him as well lord jesus you see all the sickness between the children lord so many kids were sick lord and so many children were sick we ask that you'll stop that lord in the name of jesus christ so we all can get back together and just fellowship as a congregation lord add our lick of fire lord jesus there was 120 in the upper room lord we don't just want to be 20 we want to be 120 lord jesus so restore all that back please father we ask and just tonight be with us lord as we sing a couple of songs we unwind in the presence of our lord we throw all the pressure away we just come as we are we're nothing fancy we're nothing new lord you know are beginning from our end you know our frustrations you know our weaknesses our strengths the way we go to give up lord we we go to be encouraged you know us better than we know ourselves lord so please lord jesus tonight may your holy spirit be felt here among us may your very presence be here lord and may we be in that place when you ask us what would you want my child we say nothing justice lord jesus for eternity i pray that you will do that for us in the name of our lord jesus christ we pray amen amen i just want to quickly do something sorry sorry that was just i couldn't cause it ready for a sick still place very wonderful but it's like the speakers are playing one and the the piano is playing somewhere else amen so let's sing a couple of songs for the lord i think we'll start with we are gathered in the upper room there the songs we chose tonight is they all follow because i think if we sing for the lord we want to kind of have a theme when we sing and say this is what we're going to do so let's gather in the upper room and then after that we're going to sing with the ears of the father because we are he put us there and then after that we'll sing lord i come to you the power of your love because he's got amazing love power and then i stand in awe so it's four simple songs but read the words and just sing it for him don't sing it for anyone else even if you sing it as bad as i can sing and if i'm off the tune forgive me anyways [Laughter] they were gathered in the upper room all praying in his name they were baptized with the holy ghost and powerful service came now what he did for them that

too big so when you ask and god is leaning and listening to you ask big things don't ask small things ask big things you know because if you could put that faith that god could move a mountain what

i stand in all of you holy woe too all praises do i stand in all amen amen you can have your seats now the outside world will hate it but the elected seed the predestinated scene like the one for the she said sir i perceive that you're a prophet i know when messiah comes before he said i need well that's enough she didn't have terry all night and terry the next night she had it right there she was on a rope she was telling him about it i remember now in the first age was a lion age that was a line of the tribe of judah christ his own influence of life taking that age that's the first beast which means power that answered by a human voice the next age was the ox age are the dark harsh writers age see now reason this first age was a flight age was that as i've always heard people say that that first shroud of the white was of power the church went forth to conquer and we found out he was given a crown if that was it it was the church it was the church but where did he go to went to rome that's where he did he got received his crown now the second age was a was a red horse rider which was a dark age and now now the the next age was the uh the man of the of age which was the black horse rider and he was the age of the reformers see when the voices spoke now the black horse rider that was the antichrist but the one that was speaking in that age was represented as man and that's a wisdom smart shrewd see and they didn't get it see they didn't call it an amy see they just said it went forth but now when it comes forth the eagle age that's the one that god always likens his prophets to eagles he calls himself an eagle the eagle goes so high ain't nothing else can touch him not only is he up there but he's built for that position when he gets up there you see where he's at some people get up there and can't see where they're at so i don't get to get up there but if you but you let a crow try to fly with an eagle or a hawk either one he'd disintegrate he's got to be pressurized for where he goes that's the trouble today some of us don't get pressurized we explode too quick you see when we're jumping in but we've got to be pressurized when you get up there and have the keen silent eagle to see what's coming i know what to do now the eagle age reveal it now we find out that eagle age was promised in revelations 10 7 and and malachi 1 4 that would be in the last days that's right that it would be here all right notice now this fella we find out that he's riding on a pale horse pale oh my after notice after 68 million protestants as we talked from from uh smucker's uh uh glorious reform of the or the moderology of rome last night we find that up to the 1500 mark i believe it was or 18 i don't remember exactly now but it was 68 million putt to death to protest the first roman church oh no wonder he could impersonate himself in the persified uh name of and call death he sure was now god only knows how many he calls to spiritually die by his anti-bible word teaching this is the one he put 68 million to the sword and killed and probably literally billions died spiritually on his false teachings [Music] no wonder you could take the name of death see the writer the first place as an antichrist he was deaf to begin with but he's innocent man then he received a crown a triple one and when he did then he united satan united is church and state because he is over both of them man anti-christ was satan in the form of a man amen and then also saint matthew i believe it is the fourth chapter tells us that that satan took jesus our lord up and showing the kingdoms of the world all of them in a moment of time and the glory of them offered them to him and he said they were his so you see then if he can unite his state and his church together then the red horse rider could ride sure enough truly now then we find out this mystery here in his church's state the fourth stage of his ministry he's called the beast first he's called the antichrist see then he's called the false prophet and he's called the beast now we find him here be called as the beast now i want you to notice that's after the fourth horse and in this fourth horse if you'll notice all the first one was white and then the next one was red and the next one was black and the fourth one all of these other three was representing it because pale is red and and uh white and so mixed together see it is all mixed in this one horse see and there he become four or actually the three in one and is all mixed up in that one thing i want you to notice the four of them notice the off mark of four of the spiritual mathematics god is threes this is four he's in four here first antichrist white second false prophet red third biker of heavens and earth and purgatory black fourth the beast pale horse satan being kicked out of heaven if you want to read that revelations 12 and 13. satan being kicked out of heaven then in revelation 13 1 8 he is incarnate in the person of the beast [Music] his first antichrist yes it's the teaching called nickelodeon then he becomes from that to a false prophet if he's an antichrist antichrist is against anything that's against god's word is against god because the word is god the beginning was the word orders with god the word was made flesh christ and dwelt among us and now he is against the word so he be anti-christ but a spirit cannot be crowned that's reason they didn't receive a crown just a bowl with no arrows and then when he come to crowning time then he become the false prophet of his antichrist teaching yep and he gets a sword because he unites his powers together then you don't have to ask nobody he's governor of state he's governor of heaven receives a triple crown mixes up an idea called purgatory where if some of them died back then he got some money they want to pay him out he can pray him out of it because he's got the power to do so he's a biker certainly he takes the place of god on earth but he is plain as anything we find it put it on down through the bible county's numeral numbers and everything else yuri is claimed right back here in number four not number three number four see now let's turn revelation is 12. let's just read this just a little bit because we we'll have time to do it and um let's read uh revelations the 12th chapter and the 13th verse and the same hour there was a great earthquake no i got i got the wrong place the 13th and when the dragon saw that he was cast out into the earth persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child now i see he was cast out of the earth and becomes incarnate as the antichrist spirit become incarnate into a man that man changes from one thing to another from an antichrist spirit to a false prophet and then the beast comes into him just exactly like the church grows his church went from from antichrist to false prophet and in the great age to come the beast that is to rise up so the church comes the same way through justification sanctification and the baptism of the holy ghost is christ being in the people just exactly and he's got the anti-type of it over there the see the type of it rather there he is just exactly that's him it's kicked out of heaven now we find out in revelations 13 1-8 and i stood up on the sands of the sea and saw a beast rise up now here's 12 where was kicked out now watch saw a beast rise up out of the sea having seven heads and ten horns and upon his horns ten crowns and upon his head the name of blasphemy and the beast which i saw was likened to a leopard and his feet well if we just had time now we take the rest tonight right on them symbols and show bring it right straight to him again and he most already know that from other lessons where the feet of a bear and his mouth the mouth of the lion and the dragon give him his power seed and authority incarnate satan amen amen i saw one of his heads just wounded to death and on down his but go if you want to get a chance to read it on down all right let's let's read this a little bit and i saw one of his heads as it was wounded death and his deadly wound was healed and all the world wandered after the beast you just watched don't you never watch communism it's nothing but a tool playing in the hands of god to help you someday to get revenge the blood as we get tomorrow night and they worship the dragon who was the dragon satan that right the red dragon all right which gave power to the beast where you get his power and see and they worship the beast saying who is like him to the beast who's able to make war with it that was given unto him a mouse speaking great things of blasphemy and power was given to him to continue 42 months and he opened his mouth and blasphemy against god to blaspheme his name give him a title his tabernacle which is the holy spirit's dwelling place to make it a place in rome a vatican city you just go on down and then the dwell in heaven blaspheme them but saying they were intercessors and it was given unto him to make war with the saints and he did and to overcome them he did burn him to the stake fed him to the lines and kill him any way he could and power was given to him over all kinders tongues and nations it never did become that way in rome until pagan rome was converted into papal rome and the catholic power spread the world amen made the universal catholic church amen and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names were not written in the book touch not my in mine [Music] and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names were not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world if any man has an ear let him hear amen he that lead to the captivity shall go into captivity he that killed with a sword must be killed with a sword here is the patience and faith of the saints now we had him coming last night with his great sword to kill we find out that he gets killed with the sword too the sword of the word god's word shrub to a sword slays he puts him right down wait for them seven thunders under their voices to that group who really can take the word of god and hand it there it'll slice and cut them they can close the heavens they can shut this or do that whatever they want to you'll be slayed by the word that proceeds from his mouth is sharper than a two-eighth sword they could call for a hundred billion tons of flies if they wanted to whatever they say is gonna happen because it's a word of god coming from the mouth of god amen god always is his word but he always uses man to work god could qualify and flies down that egypt but he said moses that's your job i'll just tell you what to do you go do it he fully done that see he could have chosen the son to call him he could cause the moon to call it or the wind to call it but he he said moses that's he chose his man all right now we find out here that this satan after being kicked out of heaven incarnates himself in the beast and now he is a beast antichrist false prophet and now beast and given the name of death and hell followers fully satan only strong oh my god on the earth he's satan representative on the earth that he now is head of the kingdoms of the world the very same kingdoms that he offered to the lord jesus in matthew 4. satan now becomes a full king this happens later on he's false prophet now he will become beast after a while when he breaks his covenant there at the jews you don't have me all right notice now he'd be given a heart of a beast at that time and satan will incarnate itself because when the church goes up satan's cast out it's done man all this accusing is done see as long as as long as the intercessor is still on the throne satan can stand there and accuse because he is the attorney of the other side he is the opponent of christ and christ is he's standing there the opponent is standing there saying but wait adam fell yeah adam done this i conquered him i got his wife to believe a lie he said should be damned by i got it but here's the mediator standing there amen amen the kinsmen redeemer hey man stand there with a blood that can take the stylish sinner's heart and change it [Music] it's on the throne satan said but they're guilty he can say they're not that's porous was invented or manufactured to take stain take the color out of ink or any other stain they've got it it'll break it up to you it never will finally and it goes back to gases all the way back to cosmic light and the past molecules and everything else to turns back to the original predict where it comes out it's a creation head a creation had to come from a creator but all the chemicals that was manufactured and put together broke up and that's just all there is to it there's no more of it even the very the very water substance it is blends with the clorox which is ashes amen lord of god it's all clean that's what the blood of jesus christ does to the true child of god when he confesses that sin stands are justified in his mercy goodness even it's so grateful god said i can't even remember it anymore [Applause] and he's absolutely my son hallelujah clearly i say to you if you sit to this mountain be moved it don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you said you shall come to pass you can have that what you said [Music] [Applause] amen i know that's true i've seen squirrels got period on six different times that i knew nothing more that would be sitting here just as he could create squirrels as soon as he create flies or frogs or anything else god the creator right and when no mortal being but when that sin of that mortal is confessed and dropped into that clorox of the bleach of jesus christ that bleaches all sin he's purely unadulterated he that's born of god does not commit sin for he cannot change what bleach stands between him and god how can it ever get there when he breaks it up and sends it right back to the one who perverted it i feel religious i i get stimulations now if this begins to reveal notice fully satan on his throne yes sir offered it to god offered it to our lord here he is sitting here with this beasty heart in him now here is the person the beast the incarnate devil he makes his appearing here on earth under the false pretense oh my goodness under the false pretense of the true word he associates himself with the word he did just the same thing that is his type did which was judas two thousand years ago what did he do judas came in as a believer being a devil from the beginning he was born the son of perdition he pulled nothing over on jesus because he knowed him from the very beginning amen for he was the word amen all right and remember judas took the place as treasure and fell by money so does the church of this day the catholic church that we noticed last night charging for no genius charging for uh prayers and charging for everything it's almost same that they fell the same thing to the daughters of the catholic churches the protestant the whole thing's wrapped up in mine that's where judas fell and here's where he fell and there's where the protestants fall watch rides a pale horse as he appears on his ride this last ride he's on his last now now there is not an rd that will be on down this is sealed foretold of course see the church has done gone up when this happens when christ appears here on earth as ju as as this fellow appears and becomes completely completely the devil from antichrist all the way down to false prophet then into the beast the devil himself and he's riding on a pale horse colored all up mixed with all kinds of colors to make him pale and deathly but when our lord appears here on earth he'll be riding on a snow white horse and he'll be completely fully the emanuel the word of god incarnate in a man notice the antichrist is on a pale horse mixed colors a horse is a beast that represents a power his power is all mixed up why it's politics it's uh it's national powers it's uh religious powers it's demon powers it's all kinds of powers mixed together a mixed pale horse was he's got all kinds of powers but when jesus comes it's on a one solid color horse the word amen this one mixes its colors of red white black three colors in one represented in one and three powers represented in one a white horse black horse red horse and three crowns in one [Music] sure i seen the crown myself just all that close looked at it but let me get to it on counter glass so there it was big lock on it set in a case triple crown so i know it's true so there he was triple ground biker heaven purgatory and earth three powers united together see all mixed up in a color pale death spoken a whole thing political and religious and and demon powers mixed together politics he is the key of politics satanists smart sure don't try to outwin just just trust the law [Music] i've all went through before all smart educations and things like that come from the wrong side just follow through the scripture find out that's right follow cain's children see what they become they follow says children see what they want not as i'm supporting ignorance not at all but you take any person's harley of the bible very seldom and there's one named paul that was a smart man and he said he had forget everything he know no heard or no christ he said i'll never come to you with enticing words of wisdom of man but i come to you in the power of the resurrection of christ that's right the power of the holy ghost look at the others some of them didn't know right to left hand and all i look down through the age of the prophets and where they come from and so forth see what i mean see it's a smart intellectual and wisdom wisdom is exactly the very thing that takes you away from god hallelujah he had three powers on two three jewish dictions of earth heaven and purgatory he is himself a trinity that's what he's made up of and he rides in the trinity his powers in the trinity his crowns in the trinity his horse is in the trinity is that what he is a trinity a power trinity a crown of trinity a horse riding of trinity that's of offices a four again all right three stages of his ministry makes him one person satan incarnate three stages of many antichrist false prophets and beast and three hyphens see now these three types now that makes him go god makes himself known too and water blood spirit makes a christian a son of god by the word of god see and these three powers makes him a devil see all of this shares water blood and spirit which is of god and that's politics religion and demon power mixed together makes him the devil christ first coming immortal he comes three times christ is in three watch how he comes he's a four what's christ first coming he come immortal to bleed and die is that right that's his first coming the second coming is the rapture we meet him in the skies immoral his third coming he's the incarnate god uh party manual for rain on earth right 43 fourth stage of the rider watch the fourth stage of this rider is called death death means eternal separation from god that's what death means to be eternal separated from god now if we place this fellow out place if we have showed by the bible who that fellow is and we even took the heels of place and everywhere just exactly detailed right on down and now he's called by the eagle death amen that's what he calls it remember here see death is eternal separation remember saints don't die they sleep not die you heard my words and believe that all of them send me as eternal life that's right shall not come into the judgments pass from death unto life i am the resurrection life says jesus he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believe with me shall never not lazarus dead he's sleeping amen fear not the girls not dead but sleepeth they left him the scorn is that right yes amen oh man see saints don't die separation from god is there eternal death and this fellow is called death so keep away from me amen why is he an organized organizational system the first i mean we just have a quick recap if you want to turn to revelations chapter six i mean this is incredible because this is you know really what we have um looked at in the past three seals has been the past the other part yeah but this is present um we read here uh revelation six for uh verses seven and eight and uh csm and when he had opened the fourth seal i heard the voice of the fourth beast say come and see now if you read the other first three seals when one of the seals opens uh it only says one of the four beasts says come and see but the fourth one it says and i heard the voice of the fourth beast say come and see and there's a reason that why there's a the voice and it doesn't just say the beast say come and see is because that fourth beast is the is the fourth cheer around the throne which is the face of an eagle and so this eagle brings a prophetic message that's why it says the voice of the fourth be say come and see it's a subtle difference but there's a big significance in that and this is the message that we feast on this is the end time message this is the prophetic anointing that has been released on this age it was it was manifested through the prophet but now that same holy ghost anointing is now on a people so what he preaches we can see because the same anointing that is on him is on us of the holy spirit this says the voice of the fourth be say come and see and so now now notice here and i looked and i saw a pale horse and his name that he set on on him was death so this is the first time this writer is ever named and hell followed with him and power was given unto him now notice notice how he kills because if you if you take the first three seals how they kill it's now wrapped up into the four so what i'm showing is what brother brown said is all mixed the first three mix into the fourth this is it all here uh in the scripture and i looked and i beheld a a pale horse and his name that sat on him was death and hell followed with him and power was given unto him over the fourth part of the earth to kill with the sword with hunger and with death and with the beasts of the earth so the first first first horse rider the white horse rider went forth as antichrist spirit deception was that death spiritual death to kill with the sword what's that that's the red horse rider physical death right and then the third horse rider one wheat you know one measure of uh you know one measure of what we'll we'll just read it and i heard a voice in the midst of the throne saying a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny and see that hurt not the oil and the wine so that's so there's actually a physical well there's actually a spiritual control of access to the eternal life the true word of god to live by so all those things are wrapped up into the fourth seal now brother braham says him and and um if i can find the quote but but he says here that the um the beast satan is cast down when the bride goes up so what we are seeing now is all of you could say the mechanics of this coming into being and really it's here it's here you know we you know especially i mean pretty much all of us in our generation we were born when the when the world had already fallen apart we already you know we were already here and the world had fallen apart so we have never seen the contrast of the world functioning and it falling apart we've just been birthed into chaos so all of this all of the mechanics of satan making his final ride is in place all that needs to happen is the bride goes up he comes down becomes incarnate satan takes control but this doesn't happen until the bride goes up and it's very interesting how he said he said here don't worry about communism communism communism is your friend people are so panicking about china and russia and the communist experience going on brother braham says that as nebuchadnezzar was raised up to bring judgment upon israel in the old testament so the spirit of communism has risen up to bring judgment on the christ-rejecting world so it's sad that these things must be but it's result of people rejecting the holy ghost so he says it'll it's your friend so don't worry so basically what he's saying is don't worry about this world and the trouble because we can get stirred up in all kinds of trouble everywhere you can go down a rabbit hole of something conspiracies trouble on every hand but you cannot stop this being fulfilled but we've heard a voice they said come out of her my people be not partaker of her plagues and that voice had come out and then come into christ that we can go on a rapture amen so we are the most blessed people in the whole world this is the greatest time to be alive blessed are your eyes for they see that's right even if you've got an inkling you say i want to serve god you're blessed to have that desire amen and you just take that desire and say lord just take my life and make it thine and you know but all of these things are coming together we don't need to fear them because the lord is in control amen he's in control he's not panicking he's not worried about his bride he knows his blood is enough he knows that you know he is still our protector he's our defender he will not let the other righteous be forsaken amen so he's with us whether you feel it or not he's present right he's brought you to him it says in the scripture uh ii thessalonians you know uh well let's let's just read there real quick and then and then and then we'll um because we're going to go into prayer um but this is kind of trying to avoid i don't want to go off on a tangent but this is here we're in 2nd thessalonians we're in chapter two and verse one i believe if you realize who gathered you hallelujah second thessalonians and two and one now i beseech you brethren by the coming of our lord jesus christ and by our gathering together unto him so he's not physically come but his word has come he has come in the form of his word right he has to send it with a shout out but whoever gathered to him not to a church not to a man not to a prophet but to the lord jesus christ a living word and he has gathered us to himself why to take us in a rapture amen so we don't need to fear anything in this world sure it may be dark but it's never been so bright as this day this glorious day amen so um amen so i trust i trust it all makes sense you see the first three horse riders are all merged into the fourth and that brings him from antichrist spirit to a false prophet then eventually the beast incarnate right just as god went from justification to sanctification to the baptism of the holy ghost amen so as the devil's going to become incarnate and a man so christ but christ has already become encountered in a people and when we go up he comes down amen but i love it how brother brown was saying about how the accuser is still there accusing us before god day and night but the lord says no they're not guilty amen because my blood has cleansed them of all sin i can't even find it there's there's no traces of it it's all gone he says they've done it he said they didn't do it in the first place i mean they're justified so we can rejoice i was just sitting back there saying lord give me a greater revelation of the power of your blood oh yeah you know just a yo we know we've been cleansed but lord just make it just so much more real i mean to know that we're we are free of all spot all wrinkle anything the devil could hold against us it's gone hallelujah amen and if he's standing there in the heavens making a decision for you and i i mean nothing can stand before him it doesn't matter what the devil what trumped up charges he tries to bring amen the blood of jesus christ is taking care of it we have an advocate jesus christ the righteous hallelujah amen i'd just like to sing a song actually before we go to prayer um i'd like to sing that song again we're joint heirs of the father amen and and and there's another verse in there i saw it creep up and i said i'd like to sing that one too and then we're going to go to prayer a few prayer requests and yeah praise the lord we are living in a tremendous day amen just like brother graham says about before the first bomb drops the bride is gone so we don't need to worry about anything i believe that don't you amen we're in good hands amen amen shall we shall we stand [Applause] the amen we are joining is with the son we are children of the kingdom [Music] [Applause] by his blood we are born we are born of the spirit we are children of the lord here it is we are members of this body we're pa objects of his love we're partakers of his holiness we are citizens of heaven above we're partakers of his suffering can partake is all this race we shall be changed to be like him we shall see him face to face we are longing for his coming we are looking to the sky we are watching oh we are waiting we shall fly with him we shall rise we shall ring with him forever angels or shout and sing all the minion oh has been given to the family of the king we are ears of the father we are joined here with a son we are children of the kingdom we are family we are hallelujah amen all dominion has been given not shall has amen to the family of the king amen you may have your seats um we're just going to have a time of prayer um amen so we have prayer for uh brother phil and sister belinda's keys um if you keep praying for christine that her knees fully healed thank you prayerful trip up to auckland and the funeral and everything amen the lord will be with you i'll be your fortune amen and any other um also if we could pray for brother tim pruitt's wife karen pruitt she's had a stroke um so if we could remember them in prayer she's been through a lot of battles brain bleeds and but she's been super actually delivered of you know many things but you know the devil's just fighting so if we could just remember remember them in prayer that'd be real good and brother ron spencer too um does anyone else have a prayer request well amen we'll pray for david it's absolutely i'll lay a hallelujah
