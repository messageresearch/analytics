yesterday so God bless you Happy Birthday amen and yes it was it's Anisa's birthday today seven years I don't know where that went amen praise the Lord if you got your Bibles handy let's go to the Book of Judges and we're going to go to Judges 13 I'm going to read verses 1 to 5 and then we're going to go to uh 1 Corinthians 15 so Joshua Judges Ruth judges 5 and sorry Judges 13 veres 1:5 says here and the children of Israel did Evil again in the sight of the Lord and the Lord delivered them into the hand of the Philistines 40 years and there was a certain man of of zor of the family of the of the danites whose name was manoah and his wife is Baron and be not and the children and the angel of the Lord appeared unto the woman and said unto her behold now Thou Art Barren and bearest not but Thou shalt conceive and bear a son now therefore beware I pray thee and drink not uh wine nor strong drink and eat not any unclean thing for Lo Thou shalt conceive and bear a son and no razor shall come upon his head for the child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines amen let's go to 1 Corinthians chapter 15 and we're going to read from verse 50 it says here now I say and this I now sorry forgive me now this I say Brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God neither doth corruption inherit incorruption behold I show you a mystery ye shall not all sleep but ye shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead and dead shall be raised Incorruptible and they and we shall be changed for this corruptible must put on in put on incorruption and this Mortal must put on immortality so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this Mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in Victory oh death where is thy sting oh grave where is thy victory The Sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to God which has given us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ therefore my beloved Brethren be ye steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord am amen may the Lord bless the reading of his word you may have your seats this morning and i' like to I'd like to approach a subject about breaking the cycle of the ages where we're living in a season we know we're you know we're in summer now and and and you know everything in life has a cycle you know if we're here for another year we'll come back to Summer again you know there'll be Autumn then winter then spring then summer then it'll just continue on and and we know that life itself is a cycle where where we're born and then we get you know we're children then we become teenagers adults and eventually we become middleaged and elderly then we die and then you know dur that time you know you have children and they go through the same cycle and you know but we understand that there must come a time where the cycle is broken where where we read about in 1 Corinthians 15 that at the last Trump amen where mortality would be swallowed up in Victory death is swallowed up in Victory there has to come a time where the cycle is broken and I believe we are living in that season where we are living in the season where the Apostle Paul would say in the book of Ephesians where God would gather all in Christ in heaven and in Earth in Christ right so there would be the fullness of the dispensation of times he says where there's an end of all things it comes to its fullness it comes to its completion and I believe we're living in that season you know I do not believe that we are you know sure we prepare for the future so that's why I praise God when young people are raising to their position they are the Church of today not tomorrow you've got to realize you're not the Church of tomorrow you're the Church of today right but we understand that should time would T I'll be in the grave you all of us older ones will be in the grave and then you know others will be standing here but I believe that you know though we do prepare for the future I believe that we are now is the season where the cycle of death will be broken right that it won't just be people that are dead in Christ and they go to the grave but there's a people that are alive and remain and they shall be caught up together with the dead in Christ to meet the Lord on the air and I believe this is the promise of the day right so now I want to start there with with with um Samson Samson's parents because when you read the Book of Judges you can see as as and and we know we can preach from the Old Testament because the Apostle Paul would take would take the Journey of Israel from Egypt into the promised land he'd take different stories and use them as allegories or types and shadows and so we can see what happened in the Old Testament repeats in the new that's right right so now so we can look at the Book of Judges and we can see that is a cycle of Revival and death right and I know it you know many times I'm sure you've read the book and you've you know begin to scratch your head and you could say why would Israel go from revival you know they went into land under the ministry of Joshua they took the land they had great Victory you know they didn't even lose a man when they Walking with God and you know incompleteness and God fought their battles but yet then but when that generation that walked with Joshua died then they turned to worship the gods of the heathens around them and then it was just a cycle of Revival and death where God would raise up a deliverer and then they would be delivered but then they would turn and worship the idols of their neighbors again and then the cycle would continue so you know and it shows that God has no grandchildren right God only has firstborn he only has children he is not a grandfather he's a father right so every generation brother Braham says has a chance at the word has a chance at their own Revival right so I believe that we have a you know we do not sit here and look and point to 1965 and God lived back there but we can say in 2019 he's alive he's the same God he was back there as he's the present one right so we don't just we're not historians only though that builds our faith but we know he is the same yesterday today and forever right and that was brother Bam's main Battle Cry was Jesus Christ the same Hebrews 138 is the same yester today today and forever so as there is a season of you know there is a cycle in Seasons there's a cycle of life there's a cycle of Revival and death so Israel was in this constant cycle of falling in idolatry which led them to be ruled by another Nation then they cried out to God God raised up someone who delivered them there was Deliverance they had Revival but then after that judge died they fell into idolatry again and the cycle continued and you can take that same cycle and you can look into church history you see Luther came out of the Dark Ages with the just shall live by faith it was Revival the people begin to be free but then that generation cabbaged down on on putting uh you know putting God in a box they wrote up their list of beliefs put a period behind the end of the last one instead of a comma and that was it and they died and then God had to raise up someone else and there was Revival God opened more of his word to the people but then they put a period behind their beliefs again and they cabage down and died and God raised up another right and so that's why you never put a period behind what you believe always put a comma what God can add or take awayz God is always making this more alive I trust he is to you right you didn't just read the Bible once and say I understand the whole thing no you read it again it becomes more alive it becomes more Crystal Clear thank you Lord right so this cycle has continued down all the way down through the church ages as well but there has to come a time when the cycle ends Hallelujah am now we begin to see here that you know the reason that people you know the reason that Israel fell into idolatry is because they forgot who they really were they forgot the true value of being separated unto the Lord you know many times people would look at us and say you're in a prison but this is not a prison this is a strong tower this is a fortress this is a refuge I mean the word of God is not a prison it's a City of Refuge it's a Haven right it's a it's a fortress it's a strong tower hallelujah it's a place of Defense amen so it's not a prison I'm not in a present I've been more free the last 11 years than I was the first however many years before I met the Lord I'm way more free I do what I want amen hallelujah I'm totally free amen hallelujah glory to God I'm not bound by nothing I'm not sucking on the end of a be ble to be happy Hallelujah I'm not listening to a bunch of music to try and be happy bunch of Lights giving me epilepsy to try and be happy in some Club some place I'm free of those things Hallelujah I don't need worry about those things I'm free glory to God thank you Lord amen but the problem is that Israel begin to forget who they were and they lost their Vision instead of looking at the word that God gave Moses they begin to look at their neighbors that's right and then they begin to worship you know it's crazy you'd really think when they really you know they should have sat down someone brings the idol of Baal or whoever it was into the place and they you know you think they' sit down what good has this thing done to our forbears yeah well uh well let's go read the family history yeah great Granddad worshiped this and he became oppressed by the midianites maybe he'll get better the Next Generation no the Philistines what about Uncle Joe the Philistines carried him away yeah that's what about Crazy Aunt Bethy she always said the god of Jehovah is the real God what happened to her she got delivered amen what about Gideon we thought he was a fanatic burning down his father's Idol and things he delivered the people and they should have weighed up okay I think the god of Jehovah I mean the god of Israel the Lord God Jehovah is the one we should worship and they should have crushed that thing right but they begin to look at the wrong thing and that's why you should always look what do the gods of this world do for people what does it do does it give them happiness no it gives them Brokenness it gives them destruction right it gives them sin maybe yeah may be pleasurable for a season when the season comes to an end but with God the season never ends it just gets better he just gets greater he gets more wonderful Hallelujah isn't he good amen so now we you you should really think about that when the devil offers you his best you say his best is better than God's worst and God doesn't have a worst you understand his always good right so you should always wait up say now what will this give me death pain and misery it may feel good while I'm being Sor and half but I'd rather not be S on half you understand what I'm saying you know because all sin does is give you pain that's right right that's what I mean by being sorn in half oh may feel good but you just being destroyed slowly but God doesn't do that amen so now we see that the angel came to came to uh Samson's parents and they were told she was instructed to remain separated right that she would bring forth a deliverer amen am mean so there was a purpose you know God doesn't give us word just to uh restrict our lifestyle but there's spiritual principles behind it right there's spiritual principles behind it there's there's there's there's a protection of angels just like it says in 1 Corinthians 11 that the glory of the woman amen is her hair uncut hair let it grow and for this cause you so the angels have give you god- given protection right so spiritual principles behind it it's not just to look you know that's right I believe let's just let's just settle this we'll always look funny to the world Amen always always look funny fashion has gone crazy we're here they've gone I don't know where they've gone right and I think the devil just dresses people up to make them look ridiculous but if everyone's doing it it's cool cuz everyone's doing it right but not but that everyone doesn't include me right because my father is the Lord Jesus Christ I want to live for him right so we will always look funny Jesus looked funny to the scribes and Pharisees the apostles look funny right we'll always look funny yeah we just need to come to terms with this we'll always be funny so we might as well be an oddball brother preach about oddballs let's be an oddball Hallelujah glory to God so now he was so she was instructed uh that she had to had to not drink any wine have strong drink touch not an unclean thing that she would bring forth a deliverer right and this is showing now we know in the scripture that a woman in the Bible represents the church and so the church was now instructed be separated from these things do not touch the unclean thing and the reason was that a deliverer would come forth right Hallelujah and so now it is the same thing with us we must remain separated unto the Lord It's a joy to be his right many people take the oh separated to God that's a negative thing no it's a positive thing that's a glorious thing right so so she was told to live this way that a deliverer would come Hallelujah and is a same thing with you and I friends that a group of people can be separated to the word of the Lord right that the deliverer can be birth the deliverer can there can be a word can come forth that people can be delivered that shackles can be broken people can become free Hallelujah that instead of being oppressed by the enemy the enemy is driven out the enemy is cast out hallelujah amen as the Apostle Paul would say in second 2 Corinthians 6 he says and what agreement ha the temple of God with Idols for ye are the Temple of the Living God as God has said I will dwell in them and walk in them and I'll be their God and they shall be my people wherefore come out come out from among them and be ye separate sayeth the Lord and touch ye not the unclean thing and I will receive you see it's one thing to receive God but God's got to receive you God's got to receive our faith Hallelujah right and will and and will be a father unto you and you shall be my sons and daughters sayith the Lord Almighty he also says in James 4 he says submit yourselves therefore to God resist the devil and heal flee from you draw nigh to God he'll draw nigh to you cleanse ye Hearts ye Sinners and purify your hearts ye doubl minded amen so you got to take the double mindedness away and say God is a rewarder you got to believe that he is who believes that he is and he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek him so don't be doubl minded will he answer me will he not no he will you got to be determined he will answer me if I seek him with all my heart he promised if you seek me with all your heart ye shall find me not you might find me you're going to find me but you're got to seek him with all your heart Hallelujah you got to cleanse you Hearts you double minded do not be double minded can he do it can he not do it he can do it he's more than able can he deliver he delivers can he save the most impossible case absolutely he works in the impossible I mean that's the realm he works in is in the impossible case where it seems impossible that's where he steps in hallah that's where he comes down look at Joshua around Jericho it was impossible for them to take Jericho they had no battering ram had no Siege equipment they had no catapults but they're going to take the city hall it's impossible they had no boats across the Jordan they came to the Jordan in harvest season the rivers flooded I'm slowing down a bit here I just want you to you know the rivers flooded why didn't God bring them when when the river Jordan's very shallow because God is wanting to show them that it's not their ability it's his ability hallah that's where we should really come to a place where we glory in our infirmities right where we glory Lord I cannot do it you must do it I have no way of doing it you must come and do it you must change me you must mold me you must help me cuz I cannot help myself right Hallelujah so they come to the Jordan and they cannot cross because it's flooded and God says just send the priests in with the ark send the word the word will create an opening Hallelujah and they walk in became dry ground Israel marched over and then there's Jericho how are we going to do it God says God tells Joshua exactly how to do it Hallelujah and the thing is they followed the instructions of the word and they took Jericho amen you follow the word as it's written you shall receive what it said it will give just like how how the Apostle Peter said repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of soon this is the first instruction how to come into the kingdom and When God Says something he doesn't change it right so repent be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remiss and and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for it promises unto you to your children those are a far off as many as the Lord Our God shall call I mean as long as God is calling it's promise it doesn't change so I think we've got to come to a place where we just take God exactly it his word amen nothing is is anything too hard for the Lord and our answer should be no nothing is too hard hallelujah amen hallelujah why do you think uh God sent David to kill Goliath I'm going to show you the impossible what man calls impossible God says it's more than it's easy Hallelujah now Hallelujah I wanted so so so brother Braham says this in the resurrection of Jesus in 1956 he says now he says now tomorrow night the Lord willing or one night before I leave I'd like to speak on the infallibility of the word of God and if people can ever get their faith centered not upon present situations but upon what God has said about it if you can remember that no matter what comes or goes and how impossible it it seems to be yet God's word will take its place every time see in the face of every difficult nothing nothing can take its place it has preeminence because it's none other than God himself in the spoken word and it has to come to pass right so our faith should not be as he said that if we if our faith could be centered not upon present situation it's not upon the world economics not upon what our country is doing or not doing not you know not upon what the World Council church is doing or the Vatican or whatever that's not centered upon those things or what's happening in our family what our children are doing or our parents or whatever or our job situation but about or our health right or anything if our our faith is not Cent on that present situation but our faith is solely based upon what God said about it right then we can be victorious that's why we got to get rid of the double-mindedness you say well it's been a very long time Abraham waited 25 years he got the promise right so time is time is really nothing to God he's in no hurry it's us to get stressed about it but if our faith can be based upon what God has said in his word then we'll be victorious in every situation Hallelujah so now as as Gideon I mean sorry as Samson's parents were told to be separate that a deliverer would come it was because they had to come to a realization that the reason they are in the land is that they would possess the land that every generation would live in victory in the land that they would not be oppressed by by any foreign Invaders and that's why uh God you know the Angel's message was sent to them that they would that that a deliverer would come forth Hallelujah that's why the word of the Lord Has Come to Us in this generation that Christ himself he's the deliverer right no one else is the deliverer he's the deliverer that he would be birthed amen as as the Apostle Paul would say what what do you mean about Christ being born he is born in a manger but the Apostle Paul says in Galatians 4 1819 he said but it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing and not only when I am present with you my little children of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in new so he was travailing and birth until Christ would be formed will be birthed would be manifested in them amen hallelujah now the as I said we're living in a time where the where the cycle of the ages is has come to be broken but the but the main thing of what God has done in this day is that the that the bride of Christ would come to a place where she would judge him faithful in that which he has promised that's because that's the big thing God has spoken it right just like he said let there be sun moon and stars and there's sun moon and stars let there be light there's light Let There Be mountains there's mountains Let There Be oceans and fishes and trees they're here right and God doesn't change he doesn't speak forth and it happens and he speaks forth and it doesn't happen it happens right cuz the same one is speaking so if we believe that world was made by the word of God right then we can believe that by Stripes were healed then we can believe for the Salvation of our house then we can believe in a body change then we can believe in a Rapture right then we can believe that God will break generational Cycles you know we believe that God can change us change our Spirits change our makeup to match his word can we not Hallelujah we can have confidence Lord I am your workmanship I'm glad I'm on his wheel aren't you glad I'm glad I'm glad it's not me reforming myself and seven steps to become an overcomer he comes and does it he's the one who makes us the Overcomer you got to judge his word faithful Hallelujah I'm glad I'm his workmanship work on me oh Lord work on me hallelujah amen because at the end of the day you'll be able to look back at yourself and say in spite of me he changed me in spite of me he molded me Hallelujah now the church through seven Church ages has been waiting for the promised son as the Apostle Paul would would write to the Thessalonians in first Thessalonians 4 that we which are alive and remain right speaking of the coming of the Lord and and I believe when the Thessalonians received that letter they when they read the wi they would have said that's us we're going to be alive and remain and then the dead in Christ are going to rise we're going to be caught up as the living to meet the Lord in the air but they did not you know but they did not understand or know that would be 2,000 years it would be seven Church ages amen until until the we which are alive and remain would actually be here right because every generation that die in Christ they'll come forth right so we don't need to worry about them because they'll come forth sure as the bride will come forth in this day right so we can just rest at what you know whatever light they received and they walked in amen God will bring them forth hallelujah we're living in a harvest Sunshine we're not living in the winter light we're living in a harvest light the fullness of the word has come open in this day right so the sun is very much shining hallelujah hallelujah so now so there's been a so so the church has been waiting for the promise son to come and it's been like Sarah and Abraham where the promises seem to T seem to have carried but but God has never late amen right God is always on time God knows exactly he has his schedule and he always keeps it he always keeps his appointments he always keeps his schedule so though though the you say it says I think uh you know one of the Minor Prophets say though the though the vision May delay may it ter yet it will happen right so now they had to wait 25 years for the promise and it's like the church has been waiting 2,000 years for the return of the promised son or the coming of the promised son and so now but there has to come to a place where the church begins to not doubt the promise anymore but they believe the promise amen that the sun will come and it's like you know no doubt sah because we know that all of us Abraham had his visitation they were in the ear you of the chales and God spoke to him get out of this country go to another country and then God said I'm going to give you a ear you're going to have a son out of your own flesh you and S are going to have the son so he had the visitation he believed right and he was strong rejoicing knowing that it's going to happen right but sah did not have that visitation she had to have her own visitation that her doubt would turn to Faith amen because no doubt you know because when the promise isn't real to you of the scripture and someone begins to rejoice and talk to you about all the time you may be caught up in excitement initially but eventually it'll get annoying why are these people talking about a Rapture why are they talking about a body change why are they talking about Jesus Christ in flesh again you know you know and and and it gets a bit annoying eventually because like why are you so happy about this settle down we can't SLE down Abraham couldn't settle down he knew every day every day he got old the more impossible it seemed in his flesh but the more possible it was with God right so he be he kept rejoicing and every month Sarah how are you feeling nothing month number two I'm not going to do it to month number I don't know how many but you know month two how you feeling Sarah the same and eventually she get angry I still feel the same she get frustrated because anyone who tries to bring forth the promise of the word and their own strength gets frustrated they get annoyed they get angry because they know it's not man fting and someone's there rejoicing and God is changing them it's because those who are trying to do in their own strength are trying to keep it with their will doing it but you've got to give your will over and when you give your will over then God can work but unless you do you if you keep your will to yourself God can't work as he should oh Lord Jesus Hallelujah that's why you say Lord not my will but thy will be done hallelujah so she began to get a bit annoyed and finally there came a season where God came down in flesh hallelujah hallelujah where where Abraham was he was waiting for the coming of the promised son and then God came down in human flesh in Genesis Chapter 18 it says and the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of memory and he sat in the tent dooring the heat of the day and he lifted up his eyes and looked and lo three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the T door and bowed himself down toward the ground he said my Lord if now I found favor in thy sight pass not away I pray thee from thy servant and I won't read the whole thing but you see the god becomes flesh he comes and speaks to Abraham God saw God knew one of them was the Lord because he'd met him before as MDC right so so so he recognized it was God in flesh and then now they're sitting there they're having a meal Abraham and and and um you know he gets Sarah to prepare some of the meal and so God is eating food talking to Abraham and God says to Abra where is Sarah thy wife this is Sarah's visitation but Abraham's looking for it Hallelujah that's the same thing with you and I sometimes our neighbor next to us is not looking for the visitation but if we keep a spiritual atmosphere around us then God will come down and meet them right brother Abraham said that it was hot on the backside the desert The Plains of memory and and Sarah was a little bit fussy but Abraham kept a spiritual atmosphere around him because he was under expectation for God to come and meet Sarah that they'd have the promised son hallah and and I say especially God help us amen that we do not you know enter into their fussiness or we bring the fussiness right but we keep a spiritual atmosphere around us that we're not looking at current situation but looking at his promised word right so now here comes Abraham God God speaks to him where is Sarah thy wife and Abraham says she's in the tent behind you and God says to Sarah I mean God says to Abraham according to the time of life I will visit you now time of life always speaks about a woman this is Sarah's visitation and you will have the promised son now Sarah's in the tent behind behind them this is Genesis 18 and she laughs within her heart saying how can how can I have pleasure with my Lord you know we're old and stricken in age you know how can we how can we do this Abraham was what 99 Sarah was not much younger than that and so it was physically impossible for them to have the promised son but then but then God when he's speaking to Abraham he says why did Sarah laugh because God knows the thoughts of the people right and then Sarah comes out says no I no I didn't but God says yes you did but you're going to have the promised son right so this visitation caused a um Sarah to go from from doubt in the promise to Faith Hallelujah and that's why when you come down to this age where there's a prophet comes upon the Earth and he goes to Genesis 18 and he says the world's in a Sodom condition again right and people like all Roberts and and Billy Graham and he and and he actually mentions the collects of ministers they've gone down into the world to try and call lot out right but he says the preaching of the Gospel just blinds a lot of people right and then so but then he says but there was one what about Abraham's visitation what about the elect group waiting for the promised son what kind of visitation did they receive amen and then he said and he says now I'll turn my back he says now I'm just your brother I'm I'm helpless as helpless can be right I'm just your brother I'm waiting for him to come he says now the angel of Lord is here and people knew he didn't need to say it people knew the presence of God came down there are people even from New Zealand that were in those meetings one of them started the New Life Church here and he and he tried to hide behind his Pew when the angel of the Lord came down such a holy atmosphere coming to the room everyone knew the Lord was there and he says now I'll turn my back to show you where we are in the scripture history repeats itself friends history repeats before the burning of Sodom this happened before the burning of a gentile world this happened right so he says now I'll turn my back and he's trying to he's not doing he's not trying to perform but he's trying to get the people to see now this is where we are brother bradam wasn't God he's just a he's just a man we don't worship him we worship Jesus Christ The Living Word right he's our God will Bram is not our God he's just a prophet do you worship Paul no you worship Jesus Christ right when you read Paul's writings you don't worship Paul is in that wonderful Paul wrote that no we worship God but God used Paul right just like Moses do you worship Moses when you read the first five books of the Bible oh Moses how wonderful you are telling us about creation no you say Thank You Lord you you you had this written down to me or James or John the Book of Revelation do you worship John no you Worship the Lord Jesus Christ right so so people come up and the prayer line says now I'll turn my back and then and he says exactly tells exactly what happens this is where you know why you're here this is your need this is where you're from sometimes about nearly you know 15 different things about one person and they're all always right amen what's he trying to do he's trying to get the people to say now this we're back in Genesis 18 where the church has come and it's been waiting for a visitation that they can receive the promised son Hallelujah now Sarah had to be changed to actually give birth to that promised son right to actually receive that promised son we're going to meet him in the air you're following me he physically is not going to touch the Earth We're going to meet him in the air right at that coming he comes like a thief in the night we'll meet him in the air that's what first Thessalonians tells us when he puts his feet upon this Earth that's when he comes for the juice but we're in the wedding supper already right so now so here he is the L you so so we have to be changed to receive the promised son in the air right so now Sarah was changed she became a young woman again and you can see this when they go down to Guero or or the place of the Philistines and the King wanted to marry Sarah and here comes old grma coming down on her walker or whatever that that were I guess a camels a Mobility Scooter I guess I don't know but you know and yet the king looks at her he could have any woman he wants in the Kingdom but he wants Sarah and SAR is well up in age why is that because she had been changed young again she received a body change right to receive the promised son and that's what the visitation of God did to her changed her body young again that she could have Isaac right and that's what this message does now right that's why brother said now I'll turn my back to show you that that same God that changed Sarah's body is here to change your body that you receive Jesus Christ in the air Hallelujah right that's why that's why it's so significant it's not just to tickle our you know give us a religious itch but we God wants us to know where we are in time right this is a road map right but unless you know where you are you don't know how far your destination is right you can look at the map just like any place and say well I need to get there but if you don't know where you are to get there how you going to get there right and so but it takes the Lord to come and say this is where you are in scripture see you know how far you need to travel amen and that's why I thank God that we have he has come down opened his word to us that through this message that we know exactly where we are and where we're going Hallelujah so now Sarah so this visitation turned Sarah from doubt to Faith right that she came to a position as it says in Hebrews 11 And1 says through faith also Sarah herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was part past age because she judged him faithful who had promised hallelujah amen and we have to come to that same place that we judge him faithful that which is promised and now that's not just the body change we have to judge him faithful every day that his word will keep us his word will guide us he will preserve our path right that when we don't know which way to go we must judge him Faithfully if he's our Shepherd he will guide us through right he won't just leave us but he will guide us through the trial he'll guide us through the hardship because he is our Shepherd amen I trust that you know him personally the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want Hallelujah that so you must judge him faithful Hallelujah hasn't he proved himself faithful over and over and over and over again why would he stop doing that just think about why would he stop doing that no he continues CU that's just how he works now brother Bram says in the rising of the sun he says now when you get the Dynamics you have been quickened from Mortal to immortality sir it makes the whole body come subject to the word it'll make you act different look different live different it just makes you different now the Dynamics is the Holy Ghost we understand you who were once dead in sins and trespasses in darkness hath he quii what by his spirit that raised up Jesus on Easter morning from the dead and if it dwells in your mortal bodies now watch it also quickens brings to life makes it subject to the word now how can you claim to have that spirit and throw yourself away from the word you'll Quicken by something else for if it quickened your mortal body to the word sure it will so now the holy ghost that you know that's why it's so important we cannot be Christians in our own mental ability you cannot be believer just in your own mental ability doesn't matter how well you can paint the picture you can start from 1947 to 1965 Genesis to Revelation have it perfect and man's mind can put it together because it's made plain in this day but without the spirit of the Lord you will not that word will never be alive in you right though it may sound good though it may it look good but without the life of Jesus Christ in you it won't live it will never actually bring it to full it will never bring it to life and we want word to live in us now Lord now in order to be now to be quick to the word Now does not just mean to live right act right and speak right right and to dress right that's part of it that's been Quicken to the word right but then it also to be Quicken to the word means to be Quicken to the promise of the day amen and so the promise of the day we know is the body change right that with God would become the fullness of God that we'd be filled with the fullness of God right all Jesus all God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ is he poured into the church right so now the fullness of the word becomes manifested in a people amen and after that now then there's the change in the B says the Rapture but the quickening to the word means we're quickened to a body change amen you following me that's why you know I want to Anchor it into your souls if God has transformed your life and he lives in you you can look back and the person I once was I'm no longer that person because he got a hold of my life I'm a different person then if God has done that for you he doesn't leave you there you were quickened by this word because you've got a body change right you have a Rapture to go in Hallelujah that's exactly why you've been made alive in this hour is to fulfill the promise of the hour amen just like Mary Mary was there and the promise of her hours Emanuel would be born the Messiah would be Bor and she was quickened by an angel's message to manifest the promise of her day hallelujah amen King David it came a season where a king would come to the throne amen you know you know Moses spoke about kings in the book of Deuteronomy yeah God knew that they'd have Kings right but it came to the time where the promise that because even in Genesis is a scepter shall not depart out of Juda until shoh come so there would be a promise of a kingship coming through Judah there he was a little Shepherd boy anointed by a Vindicated prophet Samuel there he was and then he became the king because he was quick because the promise of that hour was a king would come and the fullness of the land would be would be possessed so he was anointed to manifest the word for his day Hallelujah that's why it's so glorious you say well how can I do that if he's in you you will live it right if the Lord is in you if his word is in you you can't help it but it'll live amen amen so now so he's not going to take us a little bit just to just to get you know just to stay here we haven't been we haven't become alive just to be just to you know I don't believe we're foolish virgin amen right I trust you look at yourself said no I have oil in my lamp and I'm burning I have oil in my lamp thank you Lord H I got the holy ghost in my vessel and a light is shining Hallelujah now I'm going to just going to segue a little bit then come back to what I just said about manifesting the promise of the day now we understand that if you know and you know if we are here to break the cycle break the cycle of the ages then God has to have a God has to have Bible families again Bible husbands Bible Wives Bible children amen that what that the unity that Adam and Eve had before the fall would be restored even in this evil World among husbands and wives amen amen I believe it if you the scripture says that husband and wives will become one flesh I believe we're one flesh amen and this is how it should be now in order for this to be now I just want to read uh let's go to um let's go to Ephesians 5 and we're going to read a little bit here and then we're going to jump around a bit but I just so Ephesians 5 and we're going to read from verse 14 he says so Ephesians 5:14 say Amen when say Amen when you are there I go um it says wherefore he saith awake thou that sleepeth and arise from the dead and Christ shall give thee light see then that you work uh you walk circumspectly not as fools but as wise Redeeming the time because the days are evil wherefore be not unwise but understanding what the will of the Lord is and be not drunk with wine wherein is excess but be ye filled with the spirit now I just want to just focus on verse 17 here be ye not unwise now this speaks to everyone here be not unwise now this word unwise it means to be mindless this is just from the strong concordance so so it means to be mindless I.E in other words stupid by implication ignorant especially egotistic practically rash or morally unbelieving foolish to be unwise now to be egotistic I mean ego uh yeah to be egotistic or egotistical it means excessively conceited or absorbed in oneself to be self-centered he's selfish egotistical and arrogant that's a and it's it's synonymous with centered selfish self-interest self-seeking self-regarding self-absorbed self-obsessed self-loving vain proud self-important that that's part of what means to be unwise when you're focused on yourself now a Christian cannot be this way right God the reason that we're a body is not for ourselves right we are here the gift everyone has a gift in this place even faith is itself is a gift right F Faith itself is is the most precious gift revelation of the word for your day amen god-given Faith as the Apostle Paul said the life I now live I live by the faith of the Son of God so it's not his own faith it's Jesus Christ faith in him amen so everyone has a gift and that gift is not for you that gift is for others huj right and so now we are here for each other so we cannot be egotistical or self-centered and and be a Christian you cannot that means you're unwise because you do not actually know the true value of what you have right but if you are wise then you will use what you have for others and you even as brother Bram said living for others is your your eternal life is living for others now so if we are not unwise as as husbands I mean if we are unwise as husbands then we then we do not look at our spouses as our Glory because it says in 1 Corinthians 11 that the woman is the glory of the man right so a husband that truly knows has a revelation of one who he is in Christ and two who is wife is she he will not push down his wife amen right but he will lift her up amen right and so anyone who speaks that you know that's why it should be youo this is relationship 101 never run down your spouse to someone else never ever ever run down your spouse husband wife wife husband to anyone else never ever do that because if you do that you actually do not actually know that she is part of you as it says in Ephesians 5 no man hateth his own flesh right but if you're pushing down your wife then you're actually actually hating yourself and you do not actually have a revelation I'm using the word actually a lot because I want you think about it for as as as Liam would say for real life for real life you actually do not know that your wife is part of you or you could take it the other way around that the husband is part of you wife right if you uh you know so do not run down do not run down your spouse and the reason that people run down their spouses one they do not know who they are in the Lord you know what happens you know you see it in the playground there's the king of the playground he's got it all sorted but then a new kid comes in they feel challenged they're not comfortable in their if they're really comfortable in their position in the playground they'll just keep playing as they always have but if they see this other kid come in and maybe Tommy's a bit better with the soccer ball or whatever more and they feel uncomfortable they they feel threaten because they're not com they don't know who they are in the play ground they'll do two things they'll either rally around Tommy or they'll try and beat up Tommy cuz he's the new kid push him down you understand they'll try to push him down so it's the same thing you know if our wives are our Glory men don't you want to show her off in the right way don't you want to be proud of her you understand you know this is my Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah am amen this is not something that's hidden in the cupboard that you're ashamed of no she's glorious look how wonderful she is amen hallelujah hallelujah because she's your glory right that's right amen and I'll just jump to this now you look at the Lord Jesus look how he pointed out job you know God's not ashamed of us our lord Jesus is not ashamed of you he's actually proud of you he's very proud hallelujah look at look at Job Satan comes up before God and and and God asked uh Satan where have you been I've been walking around upon the earth going to and fro and then God says to Satan have you considered my servant job Hallelujah and obviously Satan didn't and God tell you God tells Satan God testifies of job there is none like him in the earth he's a perfect man Hallelujah why because he was God's glory upon the Earth at that time Hallelujah so God was showing off his glory to Satan this man is perfect but I just want you to think about it job was under the blood of bulls and goats yeah so there was still a gulf a partition or a Chasm between God and job right and God said to Satan that job was my servant now friends we're not servants amen we're not God's servants we're his bride we're his wife that's why he died on Calvary to break that middle wall of partition Bridge the chasm and mean the blood puts us back on speaking terms with God again to lift us up from servanthood to sunship right that we're join Earth with Christ God can say that about a servant under the blood of bulls and goats how much more are people under the blood of his son Jesus Christ am mean that are not servants but there is bride they've been washed they've been cleansed they've been Sanctified they've been glorified Hallelujah there's no charge laid against them how much more those people he say hallelujah I trust when I said that you say does my Lord really think about me that way he does hallelujah hallelujah amen God thinks very highly of you Hallelujah but now we need that same understanding when we look at our families what's the best you know you look you you take children what's the best way to motivate them is it is it to say you're useless you're nothing you're worthless you're pathetic you know you can never do anything right is that going to bring out the best in them no they'll just put up a shield and they'll just try and survive through life but if you say you're so wonderful you know you're the best singer you do that so well thank you for helping me you know and they're like oh Mommy and Daddy think I'm cool mommy and daddy think I can do it what does that do then they're the first ones there I'll help you I'll do this you know because you're bringing out the best right and the Lord Jesus he never says you're worthless you're useless you never amount to nothing that's the devil telling you those things God says you're more than a conqueror through me I mean I've made you join ears with me I've washed away your past your sins are no longer around H they put in the of my forgetfulness under my blood and there's no fishing in that sea Hallelujah and you are the jewel in my crown Hallelujah I'm glad well that's how the Lord you if the Lord can look at us like that and we know ourselves who you know I'm looking forward to this thing being changed I don't know about you but you know there um but yet in spite of this thing and our Humanity he doesn't look at us any less Hallelujah he looked beyond my fault and saw my need amen so now so a husband that runs down his wife there is actually as I said about the analogy of the kids in the playground they're not comfortable in their position and they do not see a far off in terms of what his family needs because remember if we have received Redemption you know any believer you take a husband's especially if you've been redeemed you've been brought back to the position you should be originally right if that is in you then that will spread to your family you can't help it cuz you've been redeemed you want to see others come to be joint ears with Christ right but if you're still under the law then you'll push your family down right to do to you know in order to control it that they will do what you want to do and essentially that's actually egotistical cuz you're controlling your family you're actually self-centered you actually want to know I want to do it my way but it should be know Lord I want to do it your way amen that I would embody that your Redemption to your bride would be manifested in me to my family that they would be lifted up Hallelujah to be joint ears with Christ as you have done that for me amen so now amen so that's how we should be we should not you know and then also you've got to be careful because if you you know if we run each other down in front of others you actually kill the influence that your spouse has upon others true amen you actually you actually murder their influence that's right you know if you are running down you your if a if a husband runs down a wife in front of others then the person he is speaking to about her her influence is no longer effective because they now look at her through that right we can't be like that who wants your spouse or your family brothers sisters you want them to be effective to others right you want their testimony to be an influence am that's why you know there's the old saying if you can't think of anything good to say don't say anything at all amen so now our Lord does not run us down he testified he testified to the devil about job he testifies to the devil about you hallelujah amen so now we have come to a place where but you see the thing is now this is part of the breaking of the cycle of the ages because family has been broken for many years this is not a new thing it's been a problem you I think Brother Andy preached on it ages ago about the effect of World War 1 and two in this country how how men came back Shell Shocked you know holding you know terrifying memories in themselves and they just became you know like bits of stone wouldn't talk about it didn't know how to deal with it didn't know how to get healed from it and it broke the H uh the the father son relationships down through the down through the country and we're still affected by those things that's why we have to parent as God wants us to parent amen that's why we need relationships as God wants us to have relationships not according to culture there's always good things in culture but there's bad things in culture right so we need to take the good and then take the good from all of it which is Heavenly culture and just let that manifest itself right said now so you know we need to and and so we but we're living in a season where God is breaking Cycles Hallelujah if he broke the cycle of sin off your life he doesn't just stop there now I'm going to break the cycle of how you saw your parents parent I'm going to take all the negative out and you'll just do the positive he breaks a cycle of that right he breaks a cycle of you know father's not speaking to sons and Son's not speaking to mothers and mothers not speaking to husbands and you know he breaks all those things he say but you know you know I well you know you say well I have this kind of lineage of this Heritage my father was like this my grandfather was like this my great great great grandfather was like this it has to stop somewhere right just because they were like that does that mean you have to be like that Hallelujah but you see that's the thing if we just say well this is just how I'm going to be and that's it well no you can't look at it like that amen you say Lord I want to be I want to be like you I want to be like you to be like your word that it's not me living but it's you living Hallelujah that's why he died on Calvary to make himself in people am me that God would dwell not just in one man but in a people hallelujah amen hallelujah so now we are living at an hour all the Cycles are broken I believe we're not an unwise people I believe that we're a wise people because we have the mind of Christ amen amen now as I said that there's a promise the promise of the ages now I'm just going to finish with this the promise of the ages is the body change and the reason just like when Jesus came the first time the religious World they knew about a God that was so you know they had Traditions they knew heaven was someplace you know they knew God was real the devil was real but it was it was a mystery to them but then the Lord came he and Heaven came down into Earth and it became a living reality so it was no longer a mysterious thing like when they were wondering about you know what happens to people when they die Peter James and John got Mount Transfiguration they see Moses who died and Elijah who was raptured and they could recognize them and they were in bodies now speaking to the Lord Jesus Christ they saw that people have a dwelling place they go to amen amen and so now the reason that and then now through the church ages it was uh you know you read the book of Acts these visitations of angels many times it was not a rare thing for an angel to appear to somebody right visitations of Angels the angel of the Lord was leading his church amen you know there was the Apostle Paul and you know you know he's on the ship in the storm he comes out and he says men be of good cheer the angel of the Lord of whom I am and whom I am serve told me this night that we will not lose any life but the ship is going to get wrecked that's right so the angel Lord that was Jesus Christ in Angelic form came to him and spoke so it was nothing strange for angels to visit people but then you go from there and you go to the dark angel your Dark Ages it's a mysterious thing right and then you come into the modern era and then it's still you know are they still angels are they are they are they woman with wings or little baby cherubs with wings with bows and arrows and you know it's a wonder but then there comes down down to this age where God sends the spirit of Elijah upon the Earth and a prophet and there's visitations of angels heaven comes open again it's not a mystery anymore but it becomes a living reality amen and then is and then he goes down now I trust this should make you feel Invincible amen the reason and and we'll read it in the scripture but the reason that the Lord has quickened his word to you is because you have an eternal Dwelling Place in the heavens right we are not Believers because of a haphazard thing right to be called what you saved one day lost tomorrow or you know maybe just survive and how's it going to happen no the reason the word has anchored in your souls is because you have an eternal place in the heavens waiting for you right and that's the reason now that's the reason why the word I mean cuz cuz God sends his word to find parts of himself right all that the father has given me will come and all that come be no wayse cast out so God knows the number that's going to be there I believe in predestination I mean cuz if there's no predestination I'm not going to make it right if there's no election I'm not going to make it but if God has ordained that I will be there I've been predestinated to make it amen I'm going to make it he's going to get me there Hallelujah cuz he doesn't just because remember God God has never had a new thought right hallu he thought of you before the foundation of the world you the Bible says the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world he had a thought thoughts he doesn't change his mind he has his thoughts and then those thoughts becomes words and they're expressed upon the Earth they're spoken right so now if God thought of you that's why he said to Job where were you when the sons of God shouted for joy in the morning Stars he's trying to get job to see you're more than just on an ash Heap this is more than you're current you got to look Beyond current circumstance and look at what the word of God says about it am mean he's trying to get job to see you are with me before the foundation of the world I saw you job in my mind shouting rejoicing about Redemption Hallelujah and he's trying to get job to see it's more than this present world but he showed him and then job could say now I know my redeemer liveth and I will stand with him upon the Earth in the last days hallelujah though the skin worms destroy my flesh yet with my eyes I shall see God it became a living reality hallelujah hallelujah and and why has this why has this message come this Bible has become from a story book to a living reality that's why we can go to Genesis when go to judges go all the way down through and God shows you this is where you are this is what's going on and comes down to detail Hallelujah not just a stab in the dark find something it's there right cuz this Bible became a new book and I and it and it becomes new because you enter into a true love relationship with the author amen you can read someone else's love notes it won't mean too much to you Hallelujah right but when you fall in love with a person writing the notes then you can see what they're saying without them saying it straight out because you're in relationship Hallelujah you with me it's the same thing with the Bible you can read and say well that's nice but I don't know then you fall in love with Jesus Christ it means a whole much more cuz you see the heart of God come out hallelujah it's the same with the message when you meet the Lord Jesus it's not a Kentucky and screaming I mean it's God speaking and it's love mercy and Grace coming forth hallelujah hallelujah glory to God so now he says here the Apostle Paul says for we know that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God a house made not made with hands Eternal in the heavens for in this we Gran I'm I'm just going to read that again for we know that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved that we have a building of God a house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens now that goes from just a nice idea to a reality when God meets you right because his word be you are Quicken to his word because he wants you to have a revelation you have a house Eternal in the heavens I mean you have a place if this thing stops living you got a place to go into I mean it's not trying to get there you have one waiting Hallelujah that's why we can actually be invincible am doesn't matter what the devil does to this thing we've got a place that we're going to Hallelujah we have an eternal house waiting amen hallelujah for in this we Gran earnestly Desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from Heaven that's why we have a yearning I believe we don't have a burden for the Rapture because the world is getting worse I believe we have a burden for the Rapture cuz we want to see him don't you want to see him who died for you I mean there's more than just we feel the sweep of His Holy Spirit come down we feel his presence Among Us you you can be in the car and God comes down into the car amen you got to try and stay in the right lane as you're shouting and rejoicing or crying Hallelujah but that's just a foraste and he's and he's wanting you to he's wanting you to realize child my bride that I love Hallelujah you've got a place waiting amen amen you got a place waiting that's why we groan who groans who says Lord I want to I want to take that body change I want to see you crowned even if I'm in the back seat in the back corner I see that Crown be placed on your head I want to worship you I want to be part of that redeemed song You Hallelujah saying Worthy is the Lamb Hallelujah if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked for we that in this Tabernacle do groan being burdened not for that we would be unclosed but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life now he that has wrought us for the self same thing as God who also hath given unto us the earnest of the spirit therefore we are always confident knowing that whilst we are home in the body we are absent from the Lord for we walk by faith not by sight amen amen so because we have a house waiting we've received the earnest is a down payment of the spirit he's giv you a deposit of himself telling you hallelujah amen that you have a body waiting in the heavens amen Hallelujah now the reason this is so is because you know there's actually Time and Eternity of blending together in this day right time is actually running out amen because soon there's going to be a Rapture then there's going to be three and a half years of Great Tribulation then there's a thousand years of Millennium then time is there's actually it goes into eternity so we're running out of time this is a good thing normally we get stressed we're running out of time Hallelujah Running Out of Time hallelujah amen so now we walk by faith and not by sight am now but the reason that God is moving and you take this around the world we're in a different season amen we're in a different season and this season is that God is wanting us to come to a place where we judge him faithful he's going to take us amen we're going to go we're going to this body is going to be changed the dead in Christ are going to bump into you one day hallelujah amen and you may not recognize them but they'll sure make you recognize them Hallelujah and you'll come to realization the Rapture is on am mean this quickening presence we felt among us is going to be fully manifested in a body change Hallelujah and you've got to recognize you say well how do I obtain to this if you have the Holy Ghost you have what you need to go right this is why it's like we're laughing all the way to the bank am Hallelujah because we have all the money right let's see what we can you know you you know what I mean amen glory amen you know this is just this is just a victory LP hallelujah we're just doing a Victory lap around the you know the bride is just doing a Victory lap around the earth Hallelujah you know if we have the down payment who has the Holy Ghost who believes they have him I would say yes I do I believe it amen well then you have what you need to get there and it's as good as if you're there already right because you don't need to get something to get there you have what you need hallelujah amen so I think we should just Rejoice don't you think now brother Braham when he speaks of this Eternal Body waiting in the heavens he uses the the uh the term theophany which is uh you know which is uh yeah so he uses the term theophonic and he begins to speak about you you he says she said well jump now speaking about the mama Eagle calling the baby in the barnyard and so she's flying over and she says well jump you're an you're an eagle to begin with you're not a chicken so he made his first jump and flopped his wings didn't do too good but he got off the ground hall hallelujah am that's the way we do we accept God by Faith by the written word there is something in there it's that eternal life you are predestinated to it his Grandpa Grandma were Eagles he was an eagle all the way back Eagle don't mix with other things he's not a hybrid he's an eagle then after you recognize the very word of God was Eagle food then you left the other thing you have you have then been formed into the living image of the Living God you heard from your theophonic so you begin to real and I trust I trust it means something to you where you actually begin to realize I didn't just stumble into this thing for no reason I didn't just stumble into this thing haphazardly and oh it was just like a throw of the dice and I got you know 12 or you know you know you know I struck the big time because of luck like lot no you're predestinated to walk into this you are predestinated to hear us call in this hour you had to hear the call you're made for it just like the mother Eagle says honey you're you're an eagle to begin with just begin to flop your wings Hallelujah you're never a chicken you're an eagle to begin with amen and that begins to tell you now that you've heard from your Eternal home hallelujah amen you've heard a word from another land hallelujah amen he says if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one waiting you say is that right brother B all right let's take a couple of eagles and look at them for a few minutes there was a man named Moses everyone know that a prophet is called you know he's liken to an eagle in the Bible there's a prophet named Moses and one day God called him and wouldn't let him go over the land he died on a rock the Angels took him away and buried him there was another man an eagle didn't have to die he just walked across Jordan God sent down a chariot down his robe of Flesh he dropped and Rose and caught the Everlasting prize 800 years later about on Mount Transfiguration there stood the two men moses' body had been rotten for hundreds of years but here he was in a form till even even Peter James and John recognized him amen if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved if you're an attribute of God expressed here on the earth you've got a body waiting after you leave this world there they was standing on Mount Transfiguration in their theophany for they were prophets to whom the word came too and I'll say the word has come to you also amen right the word has come to you also and the reason the word had come to you is because you that you would know you have a body waiting in the heavens amen hallelujah thank you Jesus and that's the reason we have been made alive in this day not religious this is not a religion this is a a relationship with Jesus Christ This Is A Love Affair between him and his bride and he wants you to know your part of it and that should take away all the fear of life and what the may happen we don't need to worry about the what may happen and the ne you know the devil loves to just pour on the negative look at the negative look at the negative look at the negative you say no I'm not looking at that I'm going to look at the positive I'm look at what God's word said about me and about the situation well this may happen and this may happen brother R says that worry has no virtue he says well but what about faith well Faith May deliver you it may I'd rather believe than worry as worrying it you as I said about people worship you know Israel worshiping Idols did the idols do anything good thing for their grandparents and parents has worry done any good good for anyone then why do we worry why do we sit in that little dark room in our minds and you know worry about stuff kick it out kick it out replace it with what the word says about you oh but this may happen this may happen no and it may not happen and if it does happen God allowed it amen the devil has to get God's permission first before he does anything to you any anything so we don't need to worry we don't need to stress we God has it all in control and we can just rest in the fact I've heard from heaven I'm heard from my eternal home Hallelujah and soon and very soon this body is going to be changed right and we're going to go see the Lord in the air Hallelujah can we have the musicians please aren't you glad the cycle of the ages is going to be broken free hallelujah amen HJ Hallelujah I say happy new year let's walk into a Rapture amen hallelujah hallelujah amen amen there's going to be a meeting in the air in the sweet sweet by and by hallelujah amen aren't you glad you say well I don't believe it's going to happen you know the devil does not believe the word of God he doesn't believe it can happen and God's just proved him wrong over and over again I don't you know he said in the days of Moses I don't believe that you know Israel's going to go into the promised land god proved them wrong right you know I don't believe Jesus is going to come he came I don't believe that God is going to be in his people once again they are yeah the devil just gets proven wrong all the time that's right so I think let's just stand let's just Rejoice amen and I say if you're in a cycle have confidence that cycle will be broken right you don't have to be in a cycle and stay in that cycle but there's an offramp you can get off the road hallelujah amen let's let's sing that shall we there's going to be a meeting in the air amen I trust you love the Lord this morning he's so good isn't he amen well there's going to be a
