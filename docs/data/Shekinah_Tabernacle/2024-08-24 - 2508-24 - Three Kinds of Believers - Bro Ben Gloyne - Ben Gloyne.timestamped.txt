[32:57] South Africa
[32:58] pancreatic cancer amen we know God can
[33:00] do anything amen amen nothing's too hard
[33:02] for him this morning amen so let's just
[33:04] read here from acts 15 and verse one and
[33:06] certain men which came down from Judea
[33:09] taught the Brethren and said except ye
[33:10] be circumcised after the manner of Moses
[33:13] you cannot be saved when therefore Paul
[33:15] and Barnabas had no small dissension and
[33:17] disputation with them in other words
[33:19] they had a big long Fellowship but you
[33:21] know and they determined that Paul and
[33:23] Barnabas and certain other of them
[33:25] should go up to Jerusalem unto the
[33:26] apostles and elders about this question
[33:29] and being brought on their way by the
[33:30] church they passed through uh fence if
[33:32] that's how you say that in Samaria
[33:34] declaring the um conversion of the
[33:36] Gentiles and they caused Great Joy unto
[33:39] all the Brethren and when they were come
[33:41] to Jerusalem they were received of the
[33:43] church and of the Apostles and elders
[33:45] and they declared all things that God
[33:46] had done with them but there rose up
[33:49] certain of the sect of the Pharisees
[33:51] which believed now what kind of Faith do
[33:53] they have saying that this was needful
[33:56] that it was needful soorry to circumcise
[33:58] them and to command them to keep the law
[34:00] of Moses and the apostles and Elders
[34:02] came together for to consider of this
[34:05] matter amen Let's uh let's bow our heads

[36:00] Jesus Christ's name amen am amen God
[36:03] bless you friends you can have your
[36:04] seats this morning so I want to um I
[36:06] want to talk about this morning about
[36:08] the you know there are three kinds of
[36:10] Believers we all know that now every
[36:13] every sincere Christian believes they're
[36:15] the True Believer
[36:17] right I don't believe I'm a make
[36:19] believer I don't believe I'm a
[36:21] unbeliever I believe I'm a Believer
[36:22] right and so now but the thing is
[36:24] there's always a battle now first and
[36:26] foremost I want to say and we'll go into
[36:28] it later but you know a a True Believer
[36:30] doesn't start a True Believer they
[36:32] started as an unbeliever then they'll be
[36:34] a make believer but then they'll
[36:35] eventually become a real believer right
[36:37] so all of us through some stage of our
[36:39] Christian Life or even just our life
[36:40] upon the Earth we were unbelievers even
[36:42] if we were raised in church it didn't
[36:43] mean nothing to us we were there because
[36:45] Mom and Dad took us or family or
[36:47] whatever but there came a time when God
[36:49] began to deal with our lives then we
[36:51] became make
[36:53] Believers and then we became real
[36:55] Believers when we really met the Lord
[36:57] you see because the difference between
[36:58] the three is an unbeliever um uh they
[37:01] all love Miracles they all love the
[37:02] supernatural right they all love it
[37:04] right we know when uh brother bran
[37:06] preached three kinds of Believers he
[37:07] took his text from John chapter 6 I
[37:09] won't read that now but you know it
[37:11] speak when Jesus would stand there and
[37:13] said unless people you know unless you
[37:15] drink my flesh I mean drink my blood and
[37:16] eat my flesh you have no life in you you
[37:18] have no part in me and we know in that
[37:20] group the 70 were there the disciples
[37:22] were there there was a multitude there
[37:24] the 70 experienced a Supernatural
[37:26] Ministry Jesus sent them out they cast
[37:28] out Devils they healed the sicks they
[37:29] knew what the anointing was like of
[37:31] course the apostles knew the same and
[37:33] then by the end of that sermon there was
[37:35] only the the disciples were left but the
[37:38] but Peter was a True Believer though he
[37:40] was actually a m believer at that stage
[37:42] because he hadn't gone to Pentecost yet
[37:44] and so he would he would say you know
[37:46] because Jesus asked him are you going to
[37:48] leave too and and Peter said those
[37:50] incredible words but to where shall we
[37:53] go for we know you have you only have
[37:55] the words of eternal life but then Jesus
[37:57] would stand and say don't you know I've
[38:00] chosen you but one of you is a
[38:02] devil so the so the m so the unbelievers
[38:07] left the 70 were actually unbelievers
[38:08] they left soon as God began to reveal
[38:10] himself and speak the word they said no
[38:12] there's nothing to this and they left
[38:14] the make
[38:15] Believers especially Judas but you know
[38:18] the others they hung around but you see
[38:20] it's all about the motive and attitude
[38:22] of the person which really dictates
[38:23] where you
[38:25] are so as I said we think we're all um
[38:28] True Believers and God wants to make us
[38:30] all True Believers I'm not putting
[38:31] anyone in a box but you know it's kind
[38:33] of like the immune system of the body
[38:35] this may seem like a strange segue but
[38:37] you know the reason why people get so
[38:39] sick is because initially the immune
[38:42] system does not identify what's causing
[38:44] you to be sick yeah that's the reason
[38:46] why cancer is such a such a terrible
[38:48] disease is because it takes a long time
[38:50] for the body to realize what's really
[38:52] happening and then once it starts
[38:54] recognizing it starts fighting it but
[38:56] sadly many times it can be too late so
[38:58] so what happens is is is is the body has
[39:01] these cells so the immune system is a
[39:02] very complex thing but part of it is
[39:04] there cells in the body that have to
[39:06] identify a a virus or bacteria or
[39:09] something that's in your body once those
[39:11] things identify those things then they
[39:13] have other cells which come and kill the
[39:15] enemy yeah so it's kind of like the word
[39:17] of God the enemy can be working in a
[39:19] life he can be causing trouble he can be
[39:21] causing all kinds of Mind battles and
[39:23] struggles and sin and all kinds of
[39:25] things but unless the word comes and
[39:27] attach itself to that sin then the Holy
[39:29] Ghost then you can actually realize hey
[39:31] this is not part of me it's not meant to
[39:32] be in my system then God can come and
[39:35] kill that thing and you can be free
[39:37] right so this is why there's like an
[39:38] immune system deal going on here this
[39:41] morning so so there's always those three
[39:45] kinds of Believers now the True Believer
[39:47] when they get to that position they want
[39:49] the word of God to have preeminence in
[39:51] their lives that's all they're
[39:52] interested in that's what a True
[39:53] Believer wants a make believer does not
[39:55] want the word of God to have pre
[39:57] a make believer wants his own human
[39:59] Spirit to rise up and he said and
[40:02] whenever whenever the word is contrary
[40:04] to them they say that's just an opinion
[40:07] they'll even take quotes and things say
[40:08] that's just an opinion because it
[40:09] doesn't match where they are and
[40:11] unbeliever doesn't care about the word
[40:12] they're off somewhere else right and
[40:14] we're all here today so there we go
[40:16] we'll get rid of that category real
[40:17] quick amen so you see now so a make
[40:20] believer see this is this is to me this
[40:22] is one of the most
[40:24] astounding things in the book of Acts
[40:26] there's many different things things go
[40:27] on but brother Braham would tell us that
[40:31] we are at another Ephesians again now
[40:34] the now I've been reading through that
[40:35] church age book chapter of the Ephesian
[40:37] age and it's it's just it's just so
[40:39] powerful I just really enjoy it I
[40:40] encourage you go read that go read that
[40:43] portion of the church age book again and
[40:45] brother BR would always speak about you
[40:46] know because there was a complaint
[40:47] against that age where where they had
[40:49] left their first love now there's a
[40:51] reason they had left that first love you
[40:53] know we know ultimately sure they are
[40:55] anointed to you know uh because uh
[40:57] Ephesus means to aim at and relax so
[40:59] they aimed at the high calling in Christ
[41:01] but because the church had to eventually
[41:02] go to down into a Dark Age they would
[41:04] not obtain that but they relax and begin
[41:06] to drift but there's always a challenge
[41:08] in every age are the people really going
[41:11] to fulfill the whole word of God that's
[41:12] allotted to them or are they just going
[41:14] to aim at it and get caught up in
[41:16] something else and drift see brother
[41:18] Bram said we've come to that Ephesians
[41:20] again but there's a people in the earth
[41:22] that God is going to use to break that
[41:24] cycle because we're not going through
[41:26] church ages again there's not another
[41:27] seven church ches we have come to the
[41:29] end and God has determined he will have
[41:31] a people that that are made in His image
[41:35] amen they're exactly like him upon the
[41:37] earth I mean they're on fire for him
[41:38] they're full of zeal they love the Lord
[41:40] with all their hearts and they will not
[41:42] allow the enemy to come in and try and
[41:44] Crush their experience they'll not allow
[41:47] see the enemy will try he'll try he
[41:50] doesn't want the fire of God to fall he
[41:52] doesn't want God to fulfill his word he
[41:54] just wants us to be cold formal lukewarm
[41:56] powerless that's what the enemy wants us
[41:57] to be but God doesn't want us to be that
[41:59] way amen so but the thing is we've got
[42:02] to agree with one or two Powers amen
[42:04] either God or Satan which one do you
[42:07] want I want God by the way you in case
[42:10] you're wondering so now here were these
[42:11] here were these people now you can see
[42:13] they say the Pharisees there verse 5
[42:16] which believed what kind of Believers
[42:18] were they they were not true believers
[42:21] because if they are true believers they
[42:23] would never say they are still a sect of
[42:25] the Pharisees
[42:27] the Apostle Paul never said he was still
[42:28] a Pharisee he said he was a Pharisee of
[42:31] the Pharisees he was but he wasn't after
[42:34] God met him on the road to Damascus he
[42:36] was not that Pharisee anymore and he
[42:38] said I count that all but dung that I
[42:40] might win Christ so all of his previous
[42:42] religious training all that he was he
[42:44] says that's dung on the field I I count
[42:46] about that I don't even hold it in any
[42:48] regard of any goodness as total filth
[42:51] disgusting waste of time I'm so glad I'm
[42:53] not in that anymore but these guys they
[42:57] still are still Pharisees but yet they
[42:59] are believers but how can you be a Bel a
[43:02] True Believer and still hold on to a
[43:04] previous light of a previous age how can
[43:07] you hold on to the traditions of man and
[43:10] yet claim to be a believer you cannot
[43:12] amen because God burns out all the old
[43:14] we become a new creation in Christ we
[43:17] are not a reformed group we're not a
[43:19] patched up job we're not a people
[43:21] working through things no we become a
[43:22] new creation amen the old person's died
[43:25] and there's a new person here amen amen
[43:27] so you may live in the same house but
[43:29] you're not the old person praise God I'm
[43:31] so thankful for that aren't you amen
[43:33] amen so so so these ones were were now
[43:36] there was so there was a battle begin to
[43:38] start here in the early church where
[43:40] which which would have the preeminence
[43:42] amen would it be the fire of Pentecost
[43:45] would it be God living in the people
[43:47] would it be God dwelling in his church
[43:48] again would it be the power would it be
[43:50] the word put on flesh would it be that
[43:52] kind of a church would continue on or
[43:54] would these ones coming with the with
[43:56] the p with a dead formal religion would
[43:58] they have preeminence among the people
[44:00] well sure they their Church order might
[44:02] be right you the you know the services
[44:04] might be all be very good but the fire
[44:06] of God is left am mean so which one's
[44:09] going to have preeminence you see this
[44:10] is where the challenge is where the
[44:12] spirit of the makeb believer always
[44:14] tries to usurp the spirit of the
[44:15] believer amen like Cain and Cain and
[44:18] Abel they were both believers they both
[44:22] believed God was God Cain wasn't an
[44:24] atheist right but Abel was a true
[44:27] Believer by Revelation amen he offered
[44:29] the lamb amen but but Cain Cain was a
[44:31] make believer he did not have that
[44:33] Revelation so he brought the fruit of
[44:35] his hands you know the you know the
[44:36] ground and all these things everything
[44:37] he did and because he was a make
[44:40] believer when God came to correct them
[44:42] because God said to him just do like
[44:44] your brother did you don't even really
[44:46] need to understand what's going on just
[44:48] you saw what happened in your brother's
[44:50] life you saw my fire fall on his
[44:52] sacrifice you saw me say this is my boy
[44:55] amen I want you came to be in the same
[44:58] group do like he did but you see cuz he
[45:01] had the spirit cuz he was a make
[45:02] believer he was not willing to surrender
[45:05] his human will am mean that the word of
[45:07] God would have preeminence it was his
[45:09] opinion that ruled because his opinion
[45:11] says no My Sacrifice is good enough but
[45:14] God said it's completely wrong it was an
[45:16] excellent sacrifice it was sincere it
[45:18] was right you know it was good in that
[45:19] regard but it wasn't according to the
[45:21] word you see so the make believer of
[45:24] Cain came and killed because it a make
[45:28] believing Spirit never makes peace with
[45:30] a True Believer it cannot it cannot make
[45:32] peace there cannot be Harmony there's
[45:33] always a clash and me when the both come
[45:36] together don't don't pull back on me
[45:38] okay because you know I believe we're
[45:40] all True
[45:41] Believers but you got to be able to
[45:43] discern and withstand the Antichrist
[45:45] Spirit me because he wants to come in
[45:47] and make us formal lukewarm cold and
[45:49] Powerless he wants us to have a formal
[45:51] of godliness but deny the power thereof
[45:53] where we just say well no God can't
[45:54] really change me in an instant it's just
[45:56] too easy no God can I mean the Apostle
[45:58] Paul was changing a moment it wasn't a
[46:00] long time of season of working through
[46:02] issues no he met the God who can solve
[46:04] the issues amen he met the god that
[46:06] could change him amen and he became a
[46:08] new man on the road to Damascus amen
[46:10] Peter here we'll go into him soon but
[46:12] you know he was a make believer he
[46:14] needed a Pentecost he needed a Pentecost
[46:17] he didn't need a p party he needed a
[46:18] Pentecost amen and he got that Pentecost
[46:20] cuz he was a True Believer on the inside
[46:23] see the difference between Judas and
[46:24] Peter was Judas didn't go to p Pentecost
[46:28] he didn't go I believe if he went he
[46:29] would have got so the blood of Jesus
[46:31] Christ can forgive all things really you
[46:34] think about it what can he not
[46:36] forgive I've done too much bad I've done
[46:39] too much evil try
[46:41] God try God I thinking the other day God
[46:45] you forgave a murderer Moses you forgave
[46:48] an attempted murderer Peter is there
[46:50] anything too hard for you is anyone in a
[46:52] too hard basket that God can't reach and
[46:54] change Hallelujah but you know a song
[46:56] says come to the table come to his table
[46:59] you got to come to his table like MTH
[47:01] was was invited to come to David's table
[47:04] but he had to go under the T to sit
[47:05] there at the table amen be like everyone
[47:07] else amen so it comes that now meetings
[47:10] always create three classes of people
[47:13] the meetings produce this so Jesus
[47:16] himself produced make Believers
[47:18] unbelievers and True Believers nothing
[47:20] wrong with the word nothing wrong with
[47:22] our lord Jesus but his preaching
[47:24] produced these three kinds now before
[47:26] the word ever came their way they
[47:27] probably would have been all the same
[47:29] you would never said the Pharisees were
[47:31] make Believers You' never said the 70
[47:33] were unbelievers and Judas and you know
[47:35] that would have been all kind of but the
[47:37] word came and be to draw people to where
[47:41] they were ordained to be yeah right now
[47:45] I'm going to bring this very much into
[47:46] choice because God puts it on your lap
[47:49] because unbelief says well if I'm
[47:50] ordained I'm ordained if I'm not I'm not
[47:52] that's unbelief speaking faith says God
[47:54] you're here for me God you you can
[47:57] change me you can fix me you can
[47:59] transform me God and I'm here for my
[48:00] blessing I'm here to be changed I'm here
[48:02] to be renewed you can do the job God
[48:04] because you can do anything amen that's
[48:07] what faith says amen so Faith does not
[48:08] say well if I'm in I'm in if I'm out I'm
[48:10] out that's unbelief speaking so never
[48:13] let an unbelieving Spirit tell you that
[48:15] you can't get there because Jesus said
[48:18] all that come to me I'll no wise cast
[48:20] out amen so if you just come to him he's
[48:22] not going to say sorry he's going to say
[48:24] welcome come home I mean for you come
[48:27] home amen so so there's nothing wrong
[48:30] with jesus' Ministry but this is what it
[48:33] produced the disciples Ministry produced
[48:35] the same thing brother br's Ministry
[48:38] produced the same thing you see but
[48:40] there's always a phase now when there's
[48:43] always a phase where people are as I
[48:45] said they are unbelievers then they
[48:47] become make Believers then they become
[48:48] real Believers I say you know if you
[48:51] find yourself in a category that's not a
[48:53] real believer why have the substitute
[48:57] I don't even I you can't even I don't
[48:59] even know how you can even call it that
[49:00] but you know why have the fake or the
[49:03] not even the real when you can have the
[49:04] genuine God when you can have the Living
[49:06] God like you know brother Isa said sorry
[49:08] I just get emotional cuz he's he can
[49:10] safe hallelujah amen you know why why
[49:14] why accept anything less than a genuine
[49:17] walk with God Amen why I say take the
[49:21] real
[49:24] hallelujah amen now you see now the
[49:26] Spirit of this world hates the spirit of
[49:28] God I'm going to put this in but many
[49:30] times we think the spirit of the World
[49:31] As in out there The Atheist the agnostic
[49:35] the whatever sure that that is the
[49:37] spirit of the world too but remember the
[49:39] spirit of the world is religious it
[49:41] comes in among the Devil comes to
[49:44] church he comes to church he tries to
[49:47] cause trouble he tries to get your mind
[49:49] off everything else I mean on everything
[49:50] else but what's going on right now you
[49:53] know but God comes to church too amen
[49:56] hallelujah
[49:57] our great king comes to church as well
[49:59] but you see the spirit of this world
[50:00] hates the spirit of God I say the spirit
[50:02] of the make believer hates the spirit of
[50:04] the True Believer amen because it can't
[50:06] overcome the spirit of the Lord it tries
[50:07] to destroy the vessel in whom the spirit
[50:09] of the of Truth dwells see this is why
[50:12] so see the thing is people out there who
[50:15] are
[50:15] atheists that doesn't affect
[50:18] you someone comes along and says well 25
[50:21] billion billion years ago God made a
[50:23] slug come out of the sea and all this
[50:24] happening and you know I've study
[50:27] science so I can talk to them and say
[50:28] well how did it start in the beginning
[50:29] give me the chemical level at the
[50:30] beginning show me how it happened and
[50:33] the laws of chemistry forbid it
[50:35] happening oh but they say no we're
[50:37] talking about this no you got to start
[50:39] somewhere I've got to start in the
[50:40] beginning God said let there be
[50:42] hallelujah how it happened well I'm here
[50:44] that's fine you know he he'll show us
[50:46] the full details of it you know but the
[50:48] thing is that doesn't bother me that
[50:51] doesn't affect me it's when it's when
[50:54] religious people come along
[50:57] and they use the word of God in quotes
[50:59] to try and destroy you say well you're
[51:01] still living will they try and kill your
[51:04] influence amen because brother R said
[51:06] there's what there's more than one way
[51:07] to kill someone you can physically shoot
[51:10] them or you can murder their influence
[51:12] both is murder both is premeditated
[51:13] murder amen right so what will happen is
[51:16] spirits will come along and give give
[51:17] snide remarks and off comments and put
[51:20] put burdens and stresses and pressures
[51:21] on people to try and destroy the vessel
[51:24] in whom the spirit of Truth dwells in
[51:26] right say shake that off shake that
[51:27] nonsense off amen you should actually
[51:29] rejoice when those things happen cuz you
[51:31] realize I've got something the devil
[51:33] can't have Hallelujah I belong to God
[51:36] and God's in me and this is why why all
[51:38] this happens against me Hallelujah you
[51:41] say well the battle's too strong now God
[51:43] can fight any battle amen he can
[51:45] overcome anything he's already overcome
[51:47] hell death in the grave the Lord amen so
[51:50] there's always this battle between truth
[51:52] and error or these two Spirits they're
[51:54] always within the framework of the word
[51:58] doesn't change the word though the
[51:59] word's all good now as I said Peter was
[52:04] a make believer at first okay we're
[52:06] going to go talk about make I'm not
[52:08] worried about the unbeliever I think
[52:09] we've already talked about him let's
[52:11] move on okay so now Peter Peter is a
[52:14] make believer because the make believer
[52:15] as I said will not allow the word of God
[52:18] to have preeminence so when it comes to
[52:20] prophecy being fulfilled they will
[52:22] hinder it they'll try and stop it now
[52:26] this this section of scripture here is
[52:27] just after Jesus asked his disciples who
[52:29] do me say that I am yeah and you know we
[52:32] know the answer you know they you know
[52:33] the disciples say well some say you're
[52:35] Elias or Jeremiah or one of the prophets
[52:37] but then Jesus asked that great question
[52:39] but who do you say I am and Peter says
[52:42] Thou Art the Christ the son of the
[52:43] Living God and then so Peter begins you
[52:46] know Jesus says you bless out thou you
[52:48] know Peter you know Simon um son of
[52:50] Jonas for flesh and blood has not
[52:52] revealed this to you but my Father in
[52:53] heaven and Upon This Rock the revelation
[52:55] of who Jesus Christ is I'll build my
[52:57] church and then he says the gates of
[52:59] your the gates of the Kingdom will be
[53:00] given to you right so here's Peter he's
[53:03] got a revelation that Jesus is the
[53:05] Christ see there's one thing to know the
[53:07] message is Messiah revealed there's one
[53:10] thing to know that it's another thing to
[53:11] know that and that same word come and
[53:13] change you because the devil believes
[53:16] this message was Jesus Christ revealed
[53:19] that's not a that's not something that
[53:20] would chock him and think man I've never
[53:22] thought about that before no he knew
[53:24] what it was like to stand there meeting
[53:26] after the meeting and the angel of the
[53:28] Lord come down and those Devils be cast
[53:30] out and exposed and demon powers
[53:32] scattering for their lives service after
[53:35] service he knows what it does Amen am
[53:37] mean he knows what it does when he sees
[53:38] people become filled with the Holy Ghost
[53:41] and the Damage they begin to cause his
[53:42] kingdom he knows what that's like am
[53:44] mean if he told the truth he'd say yes
[53:46] William brandham was Malachi 4 if he
[53:49] really could tell the truth say yes this
[53:51] message is Jesus Christ revealed he
[53:53] fought it and fought it and fought it
[53:55] right and he will will still fight it
[53:57] now but you see a make believer who's in
[53:59] the message will actually try and stop
[54:00] prophecy being
[54:02] fulfilled cuz this is what the spirit of
[54:03] a make believer does because here is
[54:05] here is Peter he we we know ultimately
[54:08] he's a real believer okay just like I
[54:10] say everyone I believe God wants to make
[54:12] us all real Believers amen amen I
[54:15] believe it that's why I'm preaching
[54:16] these things God wants to make us real
[54:17] Believers amen so now here here is Peter
[54:20] and then Jesus after he speaks to his
[54:22] disciples about this then he begins to
[54:24] tell them about what he here to for will
[54:27] he's going to go to Jerusalem he's going
[54:28] to suffer many things of the elders
[54:29] Chief priest scribes he's going to be
[54:31] killed but raised up again the third day
[54:33] so he's telling them the prophecy he's
[54:35] ordained to fulfill that he is here to
[54:37] be the uh sacrificial lamb amen he's
[54:40] here to be the Lamb of God that takes
[54:41] away the sin of the world but you see
[54:43] Peter is not rejoicing in this Peter
[54:46] doesn't start rejoicing saying Thank You
[54:48] Lord my fathers were looking for you my
[54:51] Forbe were looking for you we were told
[54:53] in the synagogue that you've been
[54:54] prophesied to come from the days of uh
[54:57] the Garden of Eden and now you're here
[54:59] no he says Peter took him and began to
[55:01] rebuke him in other words he's saying
[55:04] God because he said doubt the Christ
[55:07] Messiah you're
[55:09] wrong what you're saying is not right
[55:11] it's not according to the
[55:13] word he rose his opinion above what the
[55:16] word was declaring to
[55:18] be I don't think that quotes right I
[55:21] don't think that matches that scripture
[55:22] that doesn't apply to
[55:24] me none of us special cases there's no
[55:28] sub Clause with your name in it that
[55:30] omits you from any part of the
[55:32] scripture I'm sorry but that's just how
[55:34] it is everyone thinks they're a special
[55:36] case none of us are a special case God
[55:39] is without respector of persons and to
[55:41] have respect of persons is
[55:43] sin that's why many times things happen
[55:47] in the message ranks is because the name
[55:48] of the person doing it carries weight
[55:52] and it's sinful to respect that if it's
[55:54] contrary to the word of God amen so we
[55:57] must never judge something by based on
[55:59] who says it we're got to take everything
[56:01] back to the word of God subject it back
[56:03] to the message amen take it back to the
[56:05] Bible that's what we've got to do
[56:07] doesn't matter how long they've been you
[56:09] know I was thinking about this just
[56:10] jumping back here see and they came down
[56:12] from Judea well that's one of the
[56:14] original places where the whole gospel
[56:16] went these ones must carry Authority
[56:18] they're there one of the original places
[56:20] see they're using their what they claim
[56:22] as
[56:23] originality as a as a as a um of
[56:28] authority well I've been a Believer so
[56:30] long I've done this I've been here I was
[56:33] raised here I'm from here no you got to
[56:36] take it all back to the word of God yes
[56:38] sir amen irrespective of who's saying it
[56:40] and and and I put myself in that boat
[56:42] too cuz there's no sub Clause that
[56:45] exempts me from
[56:46] anything all right thank you brother
[56:48] Colin amen so you know I'm not I'm not
[56:50] putting this this is not there this is
[56:52] all of us right amen amen so now Peter
[56:58] Peter says no this shall not be so in
[57:00] other words he's telling he's telling
[57:01] the Lord Lord you're not going to die on
[57:03] Calvary you're not going to cleanse us
[57:04] of our sins you're not going to you're
[57:06] not going to conquer hell death in the
[57:07] grave and you see Jesus identified the
[57:10] anointing on Peter he didn't say Peter
[57:12] was Satan he said the the inspiration
[57:15] upon Him is
[57:16] Satan amen he says Thou Are an offense
[57:19] unto me for th Savor us not the things
[57:22] that be of God but those that be of men
[57:24] you see and then now but then this
[57:27] didn't stop Peter trying to hinder the
[57:29] word see as an unbeliever people always
[57:30] try and hinder prophecy because when
[57:33] Peter was in The Garden of Gethsemane
[57:36] well-meaning
[57:37] sincere man but him cutting the servant
[57:41] uh high priest servants ear off he was
[57:44] trying to stop the Lord go to Calvary he
[57:47] was trying to stop prophecy in his day
[57:49] be fulfilled that's what he was trying
[57:51] to do he wasn't doing it to I mean what
[57:54] other reason would he do it for well
[57:56] we're all going down let's go down and
[57:57] you know in style no he was trying to
[57:59] stop the word fulfill what it was there
[58:02] to do that's what he was trying to do so
[58:05] it was he was a good intending make
[58:07] believer a good intending
[58:09] Christian right some some of you got
[58:12] that some of you get it
[58:13] tomorrow right a good and tending
[58:16] Christian but he's trying to stop
[58:18] prophecy be
[58:20] fulfilled as we heard on Wednesday we're
[58:23] here for missing puzzle pieces that
[58:25] really Rec calibrated be our brother man
[58:27] thank you very much I appreciate that
[58:29] we're here to find the last one the last
[58:32] one might be
[58:33] here amen maybe maybe it's overseas and
[58:36] God leads us maybe it's in Papa New
[58:38] Guinea where we help with Mission work
[58:40] or the Solomons or somewhere I don't
[58:41] know but the last one's
[58:44] somewhere right the Rapture will happen
[58:47] but it's when all of the names in the
[58:49] Lamb's Book of Life are dipped in the
[58:51] blood amen they're redeemed then the
[58:53] Rapture is going to go so so what what
[58:56] is the devil going to do he's going to
[58:59] try and Inspire us to stop the Rapture
[59:02] happening cuz God works through man all
[59:06] right I just want you to think about
[59:07] this deep why are we here well I've got
[59:10] family I've got family I got to raise
[59:11] them absolutely I've got a job all all
[59:13] those things but why are we here what's
[59:16] the purpose of our being you see I've
[59:18] got a lot of plans in life that's fine
[59:20] but where's God in those plans Where's
[59:22] God in the plans amen so we can't allow
[59:25] the enemy to to control us that actually
[59:29] the Rapture is hindered yeah amen I
[59:32] trust you're thinking deep about these
[59:34] things you say well what have I got to
[59:36] do just surrender to the word of the
[59:37] Lord let him live through your life live
[59:40] an everyday Christian Life be salti on
[59:42] you come across that's you fulfilling
[59:45] the Great Commission I thought I was
[59:47] going to Ecuador and preaching the
[59:48] gospel and all these things it can be
[59:51] but it's living an everyday Christian
[59:53] Life where people can see you may be
[59:55] having a bad day but there's something
[59:56] different about you why cuz Christ is on
[59:59] the inside
[1:00:01] amen amen so so here was this make
[1:00:04] believer trying to stop trying to stop
[1:00:07] the trying to stop the prophecy be
[1:00:09] fulfilled this is why we've got to let
[1:00:10] God live more and more because brother
[1:00:13] brah says that National Force put Israel
[1:00:17] into Israel put Israel back right and
[1:00:20] it's putting the world churches into the
[1:00:22] World Council of churches but the power
[1:00:23] of God will put the bride in Christ amen
[1:00:27] the power of God Amen so we've got to
[1:00:29] let the power of God move more than ever
[1:00:32] before we need him to move more than
[1:00:33] ever before am mean the enemy's coming
[1:00:35] like a flood say Lord You've risen a
[1:00:38] standard amen you're here but Lord I
[1:00:39] need you I need you to anoint my life to
[1:00:42] wash all the enemy out and things the
[1:00:44] devil tries to put in us through the
[1:00:45] week and be Washed by the Water of the
[1:00:47] word you know Lord I I need a touch of
[1:00:49] your spirit Lord I'm hungry for more of
[1:00:52] you oh God Amen but the hindrance of
[1:00:55] that as well we got everything just fine
[1:00:57] it's all calmed down now we're mature
[1:00:59] you
[1:01:00] know you know it's it's amazing
[1:01:03] maturity David was anointed king I don't
[1:01:07] know how old he was but maybe he's he's
[1:01:09] probably older than me I don't know but
[1:01:12] the Ark of God was coming into his City
[1:01:15] he was an adopted son of God anointed by
[1:01:18] God and he began to dance he probably
[1:01:21] danced like that maybe he never danced
[1:01:23] like that in his whole life I don't know
[1:01:25] maybe he didn't dance on that as a young
[1:01:26] person anointed by the prophet amen but
[1:01:29] he came to a place in his life where he
[1:01:31] saw the word restored in his life that
[1:01:33] which had been lost was now being
[1:01:35] restored amen and he began to dance he
[1:01:37] began to Rejoice amen it meant more to
[1:01:39] him probably then that it did in the
[1:01:41] beginning Hallelujah but he he said oh
[1:01:42] but you're a king you're too see Saul
[1:01:45] Saul's daughter looked out the window
[1:01:46] and saw him and said you are acting the
[1:01:48] wrong way you should be more mature you
[1:01:50] should be setting a good example and he
[1:01:52] was he was showing a good example amen
[1:01:55] amen because he created an atmosphere
[1:01:57] cuz it just came out of his heart how
[1:01:59] great God was and God's mercy was so
[1:02:01] rich in his life that God would allow
[1:02:03] his ark to come into His City amen that
[1:02:05] God brought it in there he began to
[1:02:07] dance he began to Rejoice hallelujah
[1:02:10] amen he set the right
[1:02:12] example amen you say well we shouldn't
[1:02:16] be like that Miriam was over 80 years
[1:02:18] old yes Miriam was over 80 years old I
[1:02:20] wish I had a tambourine but you know she
[1:02:22] was over 80 years old amen and when she
[1:02:24] saw her enemy drown am mean in the in
[1:02:27] the Red Sea she took out the tambourine
[1:02:28] she began to dance she began to rejoice
[1:02:30] and she was leading all the other
[1:02:32] sisters of Israel amen rejoicing dancing
[1:02:35] on the River Bank Hallelujah she was a
[1:02:37] real believer hallelujah amen so she did
[1:02:40] not let oh I'm too old I got this pain
[1:02:42] who cares about that God's God we should
[1:02:46] let nothing hinder us amen from
[1:02:48] worshiping Our God if we feel the desire
[1:02:51] by the Holy Spirit to dance let's dance
[1:02:54] if we feel just sit and cry cry don't
[1:02:56] hold it in let it out whatever what
[1:02:58] however it comes out let it out amen if
[1:02:59] it's God it's a it's an order hallelujah
[1:03:03] oh but things can get a bit wild and
[1:03:04] things can that's too a bit Pentecostal
[1:03:07] I used to be in a Pentecostal Church
[1:03:09] they did not even believe in raising
[1:03:11] their
[1:03:12] hands so I don't know what Pentecostal
[1:03:15] people are trying to say but I know the
[1:03:16] genuine Pentecostal of Acts chapter 2 I
[1:03:19] mean where Liberty comes into your life
[1:03:21] because God has sealed you into the
[1:03:22] kingdom with his holy ghost he's
[1:03:24] cleansed You by his blood amen he set
[1:03:26] you at Liberty amen he said you're my
[1:03:28] child amen you're here to fulfill the
[1:03:30] word you belong to me and I'm not
[1:03:32] letting you go I know that kind of a
[1:03:34] liberty Hallelujah so I think we should
[1:03:36] just rejoice in that more
[1:03:39] Hallelujah John would see the book open
[1:03:41] in the book of you know he was lifted up
[1:03:44] before the throne room he saw the lamb
[1:03:46] come forth and take the book Hallelujah
[1:03:49] everything heard him shout and praise
[1:03:51] God Amen John represents you right well
[1:03:55] my shouts not very loud what however if
[1:03:57] you're lad just praise God hey I don't
[1:04:00] know why I got off on that but you know
[1:04:01] we got to see the devil wants to take
[1:04:04] the Cry Of Joy from our lives he wants
[1:04:08] us to just to have a memory of what
[1:04:10] could be but he never thinks we can go
[1:04:11] back to that he never thinks that we can
[1:04:13] have a victory dance again he never
[1:04:15] thinks see I mean he always wants us to
[1:04:17] think that way right see so yes it was
[1:04:20] there but it's just too far away and you
[1:04:22] just can't no he's the same God he's the
[1:04:25] same one the same one that called you
[1:04:27] will keep you the same one that keeps
[1:04:28] you is leading you amen so we can
[1:04:30] Rejoice the same God oh I wish I had
[1:04:32] that Joy again you can you can have that
[1:04:35] cry of Joy again amen it's not gone
[1:04:38] forever it's not even really that far
[1:04:41] away amen amen amen but you see the make
[1:04:45] believer doesn't want that to be
[1:04:49] fulfilled he wants everything just to be
[1:04:52] controlled see Judas we know see the
[1:04:55] difference between Judas as I said and
[1:04:56] Peter well one Peter went to Peter went
[1:05:00] to Pentecost but then also Peter could
[1:05:03] be corrected by the
[1:05:05] word all
[1:05:07] right now there came a came a time when
[1:05:09] Mary was inspired by God she was a she
[1:05:13] was led to take this ointment of Spike
[1:05:15] now the very costly um perfume and
[1:05:19] anoint the feet of Jesus one place is
[1:05:21] Anointed her she anointed his head right
[1:05:24] and she anointed him for burial see the
[1:05:26] Lord allowed her to do it because the
[1:05:28] Lord knew that he was he was my bride
[1:05:31] anointing me to fulfill the next part of
[1:05:34] my word that's right amen that's why
[1:05:36] it's so important we praise God and
[1:05:37] anoint him with our praise we anoint him
[1:05:40] with our love amen we wash his feet with
[1:05:41] our tears of Thanksgiving and a genuine
[1:05:44] heartfelt love of what he's done for us
[1:05:46] why because you anoint the word for what
[1:05:48] he's going to do next amen so so um you
[1:05:52] know they were they were there and see
[1:05:55] maybe we'll go to Matthew first sorry
[1:05:56] cuz I actually got these around the
[1:05:57] wrong way see but when his disciples saw
[1:05:59] it they had indignation saying to what
[1:06:02] purpose is this waste so all them were
[1:06:04] offended Mary what are you doing what
[1:06:07] are you doing in church Mary why are you
[1:06:09] anointing the word like this why are you
[1:06:11] why are you this so much effort so much
[1:06:14] giving of your life and all this all
[1:06:15] this you know why are you doing this
[1:06:17] Mary it's such a waste they fill with
[1:06:19] ignation but you see the Lord didn't say
[1:06:22] that and they saying you know we could
[1:06:24] we could sell this give it to the poor
[1:06:26] and we can do all these kind of things
[1:06:28] but then when Jesus understood it you
[1:06:30] see he sat there and then a revelation
[1:06:33] struck him about what she was actually
[1:06:35] doing and and he said unto them why
[1:06:37] trouble ye the woman she hath wrought a
[1:06:38] good work upon me for ye have the poor
[1:06:41] always with you but me ye have not
[1:06:43] always for and that she hath poured the
[1:06:45] this ointment on my body she did it for
[1:06:47] my burial right amen and then now
[1:06:51] they're all filled with indignation but
[1:06:54] then 11 of the disciples received that
[1:06:58] correction and then John you say well
[1:07:00] where did this ignation come from it
[1:07:02] came from somewhere it came from an
[1:07:04] influence came from the influence of a
[1:07:05] make believer trying to control
[1:07:08] everything because we know the Gospel of
[1:07:11] John was under that eagle anointing
[1:07:13] prophetic anointing where where Matthew
[1:07:15] it just says they all were like this but
[1:07:18] then John is inspired to write the
[1:07:20] source of this
[1:07:22] indignation it came from Judas it spr
[1:07:25] spread on the others see make believing
[1:07:28] spirit always wants to be popular always
[1:07:30] wants to have preeminence it doesn't
[1:07:32] it's not willing just to be part of the
[1:07:34] furniture or the you know like David
[1:07:36] said I'd rather just be the doormat or
[1:07:38] or the dant of the house of God he was a
[1:07:40] real believer he says I'm happy wherever
[1:07:42] God wants me to be praise God as long as
[1:07:44] I'm part of God's economy right but it
[1:07:46] make believer isn't that way it wants to
[1:07:47] it wants to dominate it wants to take
[1:07:50] control It Wants to Rule right this is
[1:07:52] what Judas was doing and he and and he
[1:07:55] would he would tell his um he this
[1:07:57] indignation I believe came from him and
[1:08:00] then John when he was inspired to write
[1:08:02] of the same scene he said it was
[1:08:06] Judas that said why was not this
[1:08:09] ointment sold for 300 p and given to the
[1:08:12] poor but then John was also the only one
[1:08:14] who said but he was a thief so a make
[1:08:17] believer will use the vehicle of the
[1:08:19] church to get something they'll try and
[1:08:23] gain something they will always it's
[1:08:25] always for their own personal gain oh I
[1:08:28] need some fellowship we all need
[1:08:29] Fellowship oh I need some encouragement
[1:08:31] we all need encouragement right but
[1:08:34] they'll come they'll get what they want
[1:08:35] and they'll disappear for a while where
[1:08:37] have they
[1:08:37] gone you know and then a make believer
[1:08:40] will always come to a point of
[1:08:41] conviction because we all
[1:08:43] did right where there's a choice we
[1:08:45] either surrender Our Lives completely to
[1:08:47] the Lord and let him take over or we go
[1:08:50] back into the Wilderness again and you
[1:08:52] see a make believer will always I call
[1:08:54] them also a borderline believer
[1:08:56] they come up to the borderline they'll
[1:08:57] come up to Jordan they'll come up to
[1:08:59] that death to South but yet they'll
[1:09:02] never cross unless God does something
[1:09:04] they won't cross the Jordan they won't
[1:09:06] take their opportunity they won't take
[1:09:08] their time like Joshua when he when they
[1:09:10] were Crossing Jordan you know he said
[1:09:12] look uh put the ark into the river it
[1:09:15] will part the part the waters then we
[1:09:17] can cross over dry land there was an
[1:09:19] opportunity for everyone in that moment
[1:09:22] to Cross
[1:09:23] Jordan you had to walk
[1:09:26] across you know Mom and Dad could say
[1:09:28] look kids we're Crossing Jordan we're
[1:09:30] going to our inheritance the kids had to
[1:09:32] walk too Grandma had to come you you all
[1:09:35] had to say if we were let's just go back
[1:09:37] there for a second we all would have to
[1:09:39] say I'm crossing the Jordan there where
[1:09:41] God has ordained it I have a choice I'm
[1:09:44] either going to stay in the wilderness
[1:09:45] or I'm going to go here I've been in the
[1:09:47] wilderness for 40 years so I know what
[1:09:49] I'm used to this see people make
[1:09:50] Believers get used to going around the
[1:09:52] mountain again they get comfortable in
[1:09:54] this thing they're not willing to fully
[1:09:56] surrender and I believe God will give an
[1:09:58] opportunity so we don't we don't ride
[1:10:00] anyone off right but you see there is
[1:10:02] there are seasons where God deals there
[1:10:04] are seasons of repentance there's
[1:10:06] Seasons when God puts his finger on
[1:10:07] someone's life and says now's your time
[1:10:10] it's not when we chooses when he chooses
[1:10:12] there's certain seasons in life and a
[1:10:14] make believer will actually say I'm not
[1:10:17] ready no one wants to
[1:10:20] die but a Believer will say
[1:10:23] Lord I just can't stop walking forward I
[1:10:27] can't stop walking with you Lord
[1:10:30] hallelujah in spite of everything Lord
[1:10:32] I'm coming you you called me to come
[1:10:34] Lord you called me to die you called me
[1:10:35] to surrender my life Lord I'm here I'm
[1:10:38] here Lord hallelujah so a real believer
[1:10:40] will will will will cross in the season
[1:10:42] of course God gives other Seasons but
[1:10:44] take advantage of your season whatever
[1:10:48] you do amen don't don't don't B the B
[1:10:52] God away don't say now is not the time
[1:10:55] now is the day of salvation now is the
[1:10:58] time I know how many people we would
[1:10:59] know that that that if they could go
[1:11:01] back in time that' change their decision
[1:11:04] they'd say Lord yes I'm coming Lord I'm
[1:11:07] willing to lose everything to gain you
[1:11:09] lord it's not worth it to hold on to
[1:11:12] anything amen but it's worth it all to
[1:11:14] take him and say Lord take me by the
[1:11:16] heart take me by the hand Lord and Lead
[1:11:18] Me Cross Jordan into all of your
[1:11:19] blessings Lord Jesus
[1:11:22] Hallelujah there are seasons brother
[1:11:25] brah tells a story of a Deacon's
[1:11:27] daughter brother Braham was inspired to
[1:11:29] call her
[1:11:30] out she doesn't come forward doesn't
[1:11:32] give her life God's dealing with her and
[1:11:35] then brother Ram goes out the church and
[1:11:36] she says you embarrass me don't ever do
[1:11:39] that
[1:11:40] again not long after that brother Bram
[1:11:43] saw her on the street drinking doing all
[1:11:45] kinds of stuff and she said you know
[1:11:47] when you called me that was my last
[1:11:48] chance amen and he said she said my my
[1:11:52] heart is so hard and now I could see my
[1:11:55] the soul of my mother burn in hell and
[1:11:57] I'd
[1:11:58] laugh she crossed she didn't take her
[1:12:01] season she didn't take her season if she
[1:12:03] took her season but Pride see this is
[1:12:05] the problem of of religious Pride it
[1:12:08] thinks it's be you it gets offended when
[1:12:11] God says come see if God's see we should
[1:12:15] be sensitive enough to the holy ghost
[1:12:17] that no matter who God is dealing with
[1:12:20] dealing through we can say yes Lord yes
[1:12:23] Lord just like our's said God was
[1:12:26] working through a
[1:12:28] 2-year-old he took it that was his
[1:12:32] answer to prayer he was a real he's a
[1:12:34] real believer right he was a make
[1:12:36] believer for a long time sorry brother
[1:12:38] Kus but you know he became a real
[1:12:40] believer he wasn't offended by how God
[1:12:43] was working so we must never ever get
[1:12:46] offended by how God calls we got to take
[1:12:48] advantage of our season you say well I'm
[1:12:50] young I wish I met God a lot younger

[1:13:29] Glory you may run You Can't Hide You may
[1:13:34] run from the call of God you may run all
[1:13:36] of your life but don't wait for a
[1:13:38] deathbed confession when you could spend
[1:13:40] every life every moment of your life
[1:13:42] being a testimony shaking the kingdom of
[1:13:44] Hell causing a lot of damage to his
[1:13:47] minions and causing a lot of damage to
[1:13:49] what he's done and and letting God use
[1:13:51] you to bring healing and salvation and
[1:13:53] deliverance to people don't wait for a
[1:13:56] deathbed confession of a being a m
[1:13:57] believer all your life and say well I
[1:13:59] know I thought this and I was right here
[1:14:01] but you come to a point say Lord I'm

[1:14:13] Hallelujah the Lord
[1:14:16] hallelujah but you see now Judas got
[1:14:20] offended it was after that moment where
[1:14:23] where the bride Anointed The word for
[1:14:25] the next part of what's going to fulfill
[1:14:27] that he went to betray the Lord he got
[1:14:30] offended make believer got offended and
[1:14:32] he left he knew where Jesus was going to
[1:14:35] be in the garden he knew all where the
[1:14:36] disciples all those
[1:14:38] things he was a make believer he didn't
[1:14:43] go to
[1:14:44] Pentecost see it's a terrible thing to
[1:14:47] think of unbelief I was going to drop
[1:14:49] this in here your Eternal destination
[1:14:51] rests upon your faith and your action
[1:14:53] speak so loud that your words can't be
[1:14:55] heard your attitude towards the things
[1:14:56] of God see Peter's attitude part of it
[1:14:59] was right part of it was wrong we know
[1:15:01] thou the Christ they tried to hinder
[1:15:03] what God was doing you see but then he
[1:15:05] came to a point where he you know God
[1:15:08] God dealt with him until he came to a
[1:15:10] Pentecost he became a real believer now
[1:15:14] the make believer can can can seem so
[1:15:16] right cor and daythan would stand up one
[1:15:19] day against Moses I just threw a picture
[1:15:23] in there and they would say you take too
[1:15:25] much upon yourself we're all holy they
[1:15:28] were actually rising up against God's
[1:15:31] given office of Moses and then so now
[1:15:33] Moses would say well we'll see who's on
[1:15:36] whose side you get your 250 princes men
[1:15:40] every now you get your senses all these
[1:15:41] things and if God do a new you if you
[1:15:44] just die a natural death or if your life
[1:15:46] doesn't change in any way God's not on
[1:15:49] my side but if he do a new thing and the
[1:15:52] Earth opens up and swallows you you'll
[1:15:54] know who side is who's on and what
[1:15:56] happened the Earth opened up swallowed
[1:15:58] them up by the Earth and how many people
[1:16:00] let's I I know this is rough but the
[1:16:02] world opens up and swallows
[1:16:05] people make Believers rise up I've I've
[1:16:09] come across people that they've got a a
[1:16:11] spirit that wants to dominate you
[1:16:13] actually sense it the spirit of them
[1:16:15] wants to take control I've I've been in
[1:16:18] the presence of seems like sincere
[1:16:20] Believers but they want to take there's
[1:16:21] a spirit that wants to dominate and
[1:16:23] something in me says you're not going to
[1:16:24] win here boy amen that Spirit not
[1:16:27] welcome here amen but you see they they
[1:16:29] rose up and the Earth swallowed them but
[1:16:31] the thing is the people were so come
[1:16:34] under the influence of cor and
[1:16:36] Dayan that they actually said to Aaron
[1:16:40] and against Moses ye have killed the
[1:16:42] people of the
[1:16:43] Lord that's how that's how controlling
[1:16:46] and how real a make-believing spirit can
[1:16:49] be they didn't say thank you Lord you
[1:16:53] spared us that we're not SW up by the
[1:16:55] Earth thank you Lord that you brought us
[1:16:57] out from under the influence of those
[1:16:58] men who are trying to stop the program
[1:17:01] of God cuz if they had their way Joshua
[1:17:03] would not have been in Church Joshua
[1:17:05] would not have taken them over the over
[1:17:07] the Jordan I mean they wouldn't have
[1:17:08] been placing their inheritance where
[1:17:10] they would been stuck in the wilderness
[1:17:11] you see and that's what a make believing
[1:17:13] Spirit wants to keep people in the
[1:17:15] wilderness Cross Jordan meet God
[1:17:18] hallelujah walk with him but you see it
[1:17:20] was so murky in their minds they they
[1:17:23] said you have killed the people of the
[1:17:24] Lord
[1:17:26] they weren't God's people God proved
[1:17:27] whose side was who was
[1:17:29] on I don't mean that as a joke I just
[1:17:31] want you to think about it now the devil
[1:17:34] I'm just going to keep going through
[1:17:35] these things so I really want those
[1:17:36] immune cells of the Holy Ghost to attach
[1:17:38] thing and kill things we can walk in
[1:17:40] Liberty amen and we can shake off the
[1:17:42] burden of the enemy and be children of
[1:17:45] God like we're ordained to be amen you
[1:17:47] see because the devil's the ultimate
[1:17:48] make believer he's the ultimate make
[1:17:50] believer see his own selfish will caused
[1:17:54] him to become what he became he was not
[1:17:57] content with what God made him to be and
[1:17:59] then but he believes he's not an atheist
[1:18:03] like when he came to Eve he he didn't
[1:18:04] say God isn't real he said yeah ha God
[1:18:06] said and he quoted scripture against her
[1:18:10] right so but trying to get dominance now
[1:18:12] but you see a make believer does not
[1:18:15] come to God unconditionally see a real
[1:18:17] believer says you can have your way
[1:18:19] Jesus amen that's where Peter came to a
[1:18:22] point in his life because he went
[1:18:23] through all the hardships and and the
[1:18:25] humiliations and all those things that
[1:18:27] God would deal with him take the make
[1:18:29] believer out of him to that that his
[1:18:31] heart just became you can have it your
[1:18:33] way Jesus I'm not here to hinder you
[1:18:35] anymore Lord I'm sorry for getting in
[1:18:36] the way Lord amen see because that's the
[1:18:39] heart of a real believer you see but you
[1:18:41] see the Devil is a ultimate make
[1:18:44] believer and a make believer comes to
[1:18:46] God upon
[1:18:47] condition always condition so he would
[1:18:50] come to Jesus in the wilderness if thou
[1:18:52] be the Son of God turn these stones into
[1:18:54] bread what's he doing God I want you to
[1:18:57] prove yourself this
[1:18:59] way I want you to answer my prayer how I
[1:19:03] want it that's what he's saying that's
[1:19:05] what he's saying he's not saying Lord
[1:19:08] You're King you can do what you want in
[1:19:10] this moment Lord You're the creator of
[1:19:12] heavens and earth you can do what you
[1:19:13] want he says no if you're really God you
[1:19:15] got to prove it how I want you to prove
[1:19:17] it Thomas was a make believer too he did
[1:19:19] the same thing he said unless I put my
[1:19:21] hand in his side and and you know feel
[1:19:23] the nail prints and think things I won't
[1:19:25] believe it Thomas was a m believer he
[1:19:27] didn't say that way right he became a
[1:19:29] real believer but you see the devil
[1:19:31] doesn't want to become a real believer
[1:19:33] because if he became a real believer he
[1:19:35] would have to acknowledge he is
[1:19:37] wrong he ain't going to do that a make
[1:19:40] believer who's only going to be a make
[1:19:42] believer will never acknowledge they are
[1:19:45] wrong so he wanted to so he says if thou
[1:19:47] be do this you know people say well you
[1:19:50] know I'll only serve God if he does this
[1:19:52] for
[1:19:53] me imine job standing
[1:19:57] here it's say friends he's God he made
[1:20:01] you he gave you life in your body he's
[1:20:02] got a heaven to give you am mean he's
[1:20:04] died on Calvary for you he's redeemed
[1:20:06] you by his blood he made all things the
[1:20:09] only reason you have life in your body
[1:20:10] in a sound mind is because he's allowed
[1:20:13] it that's what he would say he would say
[1:20:16] you know because when when job came down
[1:20:18] to his crunch point he said though he
[1:20:20] slay me yet I'll trust him that's it
[1:20:22] that's a real believer though he slay me
[1:20:24] though my life becomes a complete train
[1:20:26] wreck I'll trust him I'm going to walk
[1:20:29] with him anyway am me that was see
[1:20:31] that's a real believer amen he say well
[1:20:34] I've got to put a fleece out because you
[1:20:36] know I need to put fleeces out you know
[1:20:38] Gideon got the
[1:20:40] Revelation that he was going to deliver
[1:20:42] Israel before he put fleeces out many
[1:20:44] people do it vice
[1:20:46] versa and this may sound a bit strong
[1:20:49] but that's kind of
[1:20:51] Witchcraft it's a bit no it's wrong see
[1:20:54] Gideon got the Revelation you're a
[1:20:56] mighty man of Valor you're going to
[1:20:57] deliver Israel the angel of the Lord
[1:20:58] came to him before this right and he
[1:21:00] says well then he but then so but then
[1:21:02] he put flees out for God to confirm what
[1:21:04] the Revelation already was not he didn't
[1:21:07] put fleeces out and then the angel came
[1:21:08] to
[1:21:09] him so we don't want to put fleeces out
[1:21:13] without there first being a revelation
[1:21:15] in your
[1:21:17] heart right we don't want to do that
[1:21:20] because this is a make believer no
[1:21:23] forget okay just imagine Gideon's
[1:21:25] putting the fleece out without the god
[1:21:26] visiting him
[1:21:27] beforehand he's he's he's making God
[1:21:30] answer his prayer based on how he wants
[1:21:32] it
[1:21:33] answered but you see Gideon had a
[1:21:35] visitation of the Angel so it's
[1:21:38] different do are we all together class
[1:21:40] amen we'll understand this right so it's
[1:21:42] nothing wrong with putting out a fleece
[1:21:43] but make sure it's a revelation in here
[1:21:45] first make sure that you know the voice
[1:21:47] of God and you know his leadership in
[1:21:49] your life amen amen hallelujah now we're
[1:21:53] running out of time so let's just let's
[1:21:55] just let's just go for a real some real
[1:21:57] Believers Hallelujah let's just go for
[1:21:59] some I love these guys hallelujah
[1:22:03] hallelujah you
[1:22:08] know
[1:22:09] hallelujah we're going to we're going to
[1:22:11] dance with them around the
[1:22:14] throne the Lord you know they would say
[1:22:17] but we were just serving God they say
[1:22:20] but your
[1:22:21] testimony Hallelujah your testimony gave
[1:22:24] me courage your testimony gave me
[1:22:27] strength amen because if you could stand
[1:22:29] in a foreign land without the baptism of
[1:22:31] the Holy Ghost without the blood of the
[1:22:33] Lord Jesus Christ without a church to go
[1:22:35] to without a preacher to preach to
[1:22:37] without an end time Messenger to preach
[1:22:39] to without the book coming open if you
[1:22:41] could stand in that condition hallelujah
[1:22:44] amen that I said I can stand amen I can
[1:22:47] stand hallelujah amen and I stood
[1:22:49] because you stood Hallelujah you stood
[1:22:52] Hallelujah so I could stand Hallelujah
[1:22:55] Hallelujah to the
[1:22:57] lamb hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:23:02] you see a make believer says well God
[1:23:03] can do it but if he doesn't I'm not
[1:23:05] quitting I'm not bowing I'm not
[1:23:07] compromising amen I'm not I'm not saying
[1:23:09] God you better do this otherwise I'm
[1:23:11] going to quit no when they walked out of
[1:23:13] Jerusalem as young people amen they said
[1:23:15] them and Daniel said we're going to
[1:23:17] serve God Amen how are we going to do it
[1:23:19] I don't know but we're going to do it
[1:23:22] how are we going to overcome lady OA I
[1:23:24] don't know well actually by the blood of
[1:23:26] the Lamb Word of Our Testimony but we're
[1:23:28] going to overcome I me what about the
[1:23:30] situation I don't know but God's going
[1:23:32] to come on the scene hallelujah
[1:23:35] hallelujah amen so they made up their
[1:23:37] minds as young people amen we're going
[1:23:39] to serve God wherever we go we're going
[1:23:41] to make a stand and come what me that's
[1:23:44] it sorry we're doing it that's a real
[1:23:47] believer Hallelujah there's no record of
[1:23:50] them feeling the anointing of God
[1:23:52] there's no record of them being filled
[1:23:53] with the Holy GH ghost like David you
[1:23:56] know the spirit of God was with him from
[1:23:57] that time on when he was anointed
[1:23:58] there's no record of that but to me a
[1:24:01] Believer shows his colors in spite of
[1:24:04] what they feel what they don't feel what
[1:24:06] they're going on the believer comes out
[1:24:08] and says I believe God and God is
[1:24:10] greater than this idol God is greater
[1:24:12] than you King Nebuchadnezzar great God
[1:24:14] is greater than this world system I find
[1:24:16] myself in and I'm not bowing to this I'm
[1:24:18] walking on Hallelujah and but they
[1:24:21] didn't even know that the fourth man was
[1:24:23] going to show up
[1:24:24] they didn't know that they said well
[1:24:26] we're not we're not
[1:24:27] bowing whatever you do Nebuchadnezzar we
[1:24:30] ain't bowing amen they were not going to
[1:24:33] bow to the image of a prophet I mean
[1:24:34] they were going to bow to a false image
[1:24:36] of the word and say no we're going to
[1:24:38] serve the true and living God we're not
[1:24:39] going to about because Nebuchadnezzar
[1:24:41] was a make
[1:24:42] believer he was a Believer but he was a
[1:24:45] make believer God dealt with him he was
[1:24:47] God's servant but he was a make believer
[1:24:49] well he put up an image that was wrong
[1:24:51] this is how the message is meant to be a
[1:24:54] dead Idol we don't serve a dead Idol
[1:24:57] amen we serve a true and living God
[1:24:58] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:25:00] and forever amen hallelujah Lord amen
[1:25:04] they got thrown in that furnace they had
[1:25:06] testimony with the one that they stood
[1:25:08] with Hallelujah God began to tell them
[1:25:10] the things that they would they would
[1:25:12] accomplish and walk with in the future
[1:25:14] amen but they were real believers they
[1:25:16] didn't say God if you save us then we're
[1:25:19] going to serve you see there their them
[1:25:22] following God was not based on what God
[1:25:24] would do for them in the future it was
[1:25:26] got nothing to do with well God if you
[1:25:28] restore this if you do this then I'm
[1:25:30] going to be a Christian no they came
[1:25:32] unconditionally they were serving God
[1:25:35] unconditionally I mean God whatever
[1:25:37] happens I'm here I'm a Believer I want
[1:25:39] to be identified as a believer I'm to be
[1:25:41] identified with your word I'm standing
[1:25:43] for your word and here I am amen
[1:25:46] hallelujah I like that amen we're going
[1:25:49] to have a jubilee with him hallelujah
[1:25:52] hallelujah amen hallelujah praise the
[1:25:57] Lord
[1:25:59] amen praise God we're going to Blind
[1:26:02] bmus was a
[1:26:05] Believer there's something about a belie
[1:26:07] see see the devil's guns are against us
[1:26:11] because he doesn't want God to live he
[1:26:13] doesn't want he doesn't mind us quoting
[1:26:15] the message he doesn't mind us quoting
[1:26:17] the Bible what he Minds is when that
[1:26:19] message and the Bible be becomes flesh
[1:26:22] that's what the devil hates amen when
[1:26:24] God puts on flesh that's when he tries
[1:26:26] to destroy the vessel that God has
[1:26:28] tabernacled in amen but you've got to
[1:26:30] realize the one who's called you church
[1:26:33] should call you I say even the prophet
[1:26:36] didn't call you no the voice behind the
[1:26:38] voice God himself called you to himself
[1:26:40] amen the Lord himself called you and
[1:26:43] commissioned you to walk this walk
[1:26:45] hallelujah amen amen so the so the world
[1:26:48] always tries to to keep the real
[1:26:50] believer still this what the make
[1:26:52] believer does tries to keep keep the
[1:26:54] real believer still but that didn't stop
[1:26:58] B there's something in the believer I'm
[1:27:00] just going to close with this thought
[1:27:01] because we feel like I just feel like
[1:27:03] we've running out of time and my May Sig
[1:27:04] Wang to something else we'll continue
[1:27:05] maybe another time the world will try
[1:27:08] and stop you a religious spirit will try
[1:27:11] and stop you don't praise God don't sing
[1:27:15] don't raise your hands don't testify
[1:27:17] don't Rejoice don't be happy keep it all
[1:27:20] to
[1:27:21] yourself that's what the world tries to
[1:27:23] do amen but it won't stop you amen it
[1:27:28] won't stop you it may try and stop you
[1:27:29] but it can't stop you amen so all all of
[1:27:32] the crowd that was around Jesus amen and
[1:27:35] they were making some of them were
[1:27:36] mocking him some were praising him some
[1:27:37] were doing all kinds of things and Jesus
[1:27:39] was on his heart was he's going to
[1:27:41] Calvary and then blind bmus heard heard
[1:27:44] the commotion outside Jericho's Gates
[1:27:47] amen and he began to ask a question what
[1:27:49] is this noise I've never heard this
[1:27:50] noise before and that's why when you
[1:27:52] come among Believers there's a different
[1:27:53] kind of a sound am mean there's a
[1:27:55] different kind of a sound it's not a
[1:27:57] mournful maybe one day you can God it's
[1:27:59] a thank you Lord I'm saved thank you
[1:28:01] Lord I'm redeemed thank you Lord you've
[1:28:02] opened your word to me thank you Lord
[1:28:04] you've called me from the open book amen
[1:28:06] there's a different kind of a sound from
[1:28:07] believer's lips am mean and and and he
[1:28:09] heard that kind of a sound he says what
[1:28:12] is this what is going on and someone
[1:28:14] said bmus Jesus of Nazareth is passing
[1:28:18] by and he had heard of this Lord Jesus
[1:28:21] and what happened is all he knew his
[1:28:23] child teachings that there was still a
[1:28:25] Jehovah God somewhere that God was still
[1:28:28] a deliverer and he realized that that
[1:28:30] same God that he heard about his mom
[1:28:32] tell him about was passing by his way
[1:28:34] and he took his moment amen he took his
[1:28:37] moment and his faith touched the master
[1:28:39] and the word says that Jesus Stood Still
[1:28:43] yeah now our lord Jesus I'm going to
[1:28:45] wrap up with this thought our lord Jesus
[1:28:47] has been walking through seven Church
[1:28:48] ages right the son of man has been
[1:28:51] walking through seven Church ages right
[1:28:53] but we we have the opportunity today to
[1:28:57] make him stand
[1:28:58] still and that that he can meet our need
[1:29:01] in our life we have an opportun see
[1:29:02] church is opportunities church is
[1:29:05] moments right so because bamas was a
[1:29:08] real believer the world telling him to
[1:29:10] be quiet because he cried out Jesus Son
[1:29:12] of you know son of David have mercy and
[1:29:14] people trying to stop his worship trying
[1:29:16] to stop his prayer trying to stop him
[1:29:18] calling on God but that didn't stop him
[1:29:21] he said well if that if they're going to
[1:29:23] try and stop me I'm just going to get a
[1:29:24] little bit louder and it was actually
[1:29:27] his faith that touched the Lord am me
[1:29:30] but his faith was manifested in his
[1:29:32] works as
[1:29:35] cry so in closing I'll just summarize
[1:29:39] this
[1:29:40] okay a real believer okay we start with
[1:29:43] the unbeliever the unbeliever say all
[1:29:46] three love the supernatural they love
[1:29:48] the blessings of God but the unbeliever
[1:29:50] when the word comes open they're gone
[1:29:53] they're not even wanting to sit around
[1:29:54] and see what is this all about does it
[1:29:56] actually marry up with the Bible or not
[1:29:58] is it actually scripture fulfilled
[1:29:59] they're not interested they're gone the
[1:30:01] make believer will hang around longer
[1:30:04] than that but they want themselves to
[1:30:06] have dominance over the word of God and
[1:30:09] they're actually waiting for a loophole
[1:30:11] something that they find is an error and
[1:30:13] they want to use that error to
[1:30:16] control that's what Judas Judas
[1:30:18] basically said I'm going to stop this
[1:30:20] whole thing I'm going to control
[1:30:22] this this guy who says he's the Messiah
[1:30:25] he's out of control he's out of hand
[1:30:27] that's why he went to betray him I'm
[1:30:29] going to stop this whole thing see he
[1:30:31] wanted to have dominance and he wasn't
[1:30:33] corrected by the word so he went and did
[1:30:36] it so the make believer will always have
[1:30:39] their own opinion above the word of God
[1:30:42] and they will dictate to God how they
[1:30:44] want God to work in their life that's
[1:30:46] how we go to Baum all kinds of ones
[1:30:48] through the Bible but the real believer
[1:30:51] comes unconditionally to God yes my Lord
[1:30:54] they are not interested I mean they're
[1:30:56] they're not there to say God if you do
[1:30:58] this then I'll serve you they have no
[1:30:59] pre-existing conditions they say God
[1:31:02] here I am here I stand Lord do what you
[1:31:05] want to do in my life change me Lord
[1:31:07] your word is right and I am wrong amen
[1:31:10] your word is true and I'm false amen
[1:31:12] your word is eternal and my opinion
[1:31:14] doesn't matter and they're willing to
[1:31:16] surrender their whole lives say Lord may
[1:31:19] your word take control of my
[1:31:21] life amen so that's the three
[1:31:24] I just asked you the question where are
[1:31:26] you in this remember God wants to make
[1:31:28] us all real Believers we start as
[1:31:30] unbelievers we then we continue as make
[1:31:33] Believers I was I was making Homebrew
[1:31:36] reading the Bible getting drunk partying
[1:31:38] listening to rock and roll and in town
[1:31:41] and clubs and all the stuff listening to
[1:31:43] the
[1:31:44] message I
[1:31:46] was I W wasn't a real believer I was a m
[1:31:49] believer because my own will was I want
[1:31:53] to keep my friend friends but I want the
[1:31:55] Lord at the same time I want to keep my
[1:31:57] circle of
[1:31:59] people so my own human world was
[1:32:01] actually take was greater than God in my
[1:32:05] life but there came a
[1:32:07] time where God said hey you got to come
[1:32:11] now you can't keep this up amen you know
[1:32:14] you're miserable you know you're not
[1:32:15] enjoying this you know you're just
[1:32:17] actually being torn in two come to me
[1:32:20] and I'll give you rest I'll change you
[1:32:22] Lord I'll change you
[1:32:24] now became a real believer Hallelujah 17
