the Lord do tonight for us yes hallelujah amen uh brother Liam if you can put up that slideshow please I just referred to my son as brother Liam because he is God bless you okay so we've got a prayer request here we've got Omar Robin that's still in our in our minds and we know she's still she's still battling on and then we want to we've got a prayer request there for please pray for my friend's child tuni as she has been having a high fever and uh we we just bring these requests before the Lord if there's anybody that has a request raise your hand up when we bow our heads and speak to the maker cuz he knows everything before you even have a tear in your eyes before you even speak that request he knows what's on your heart so let's just pray and lift these before Lord Jesus we come this evening and we just want to come and say Lord thank you thank you so much Lord for being such a good God lord for putting us on speaking terms again with you Lord Jesus and that we can come before you Lord as Easter came before The King and Lord we can say father we have a people that is in need father and we come before you to do an intercession Lord and say Lord tun is is having a fever and it's a friend Lord and and we know that Lord we take it very seriously when people ask for prayer Lord because we know that Prayer Changes Things father and as the Bride of Christ we come together tonight and say father tonight Lord may you just go to tuni Lord Jesus and touch that fever and may it leave in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ according to your will Lord because your bride has asked father for this petition and we know Lord that you are a mighty God and you are able to do it and we also ask for sister Robin's healing Lord as you can see Lord she's also fighting and she's not proclaiming to be defeated father she says Lord all these brothers and sisters will pray together for her father because more of us and there's less of the devil lord and we will just stomp you once more father in any hand that has been raised father with a request behind that hand Lord you know that Lord I remember the prayer lines where people would come before the prophet of God lord and you would already discern everything that was in their heart before they even got there father that same God Is With Us Now father and every request spoken or unspoken Lord we ask Lord to lay it at your feet and say father you just go and you win the Battle For Your Glory and your kingdom we pray in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen amen God bless you Saints let's go there to Mark 16 I'm going to start the timer cuz man always need a timer Hallelujah so the bride's commission so what triggered this thought is it's great to know that we're the bride and we always speak about ourselves as being the bride of Christ and that's fantastic but what does it mean to be the bride of Christ you know where do we go you know what do we do we you know a lot of Christians they all love God they they all love God everybody that that proclaims the name of Jesus loves God but what is the bride's commission what is what are we supposed to fulfill in this day and it's a good question because if we know this we know where we stand and we know what we need to do with our first next couple of steps am so this is not me I was jumping for joy in my house today I was going through these notes hey and I had a jubilee I was man if you ever heard me shout that was today cuz sometimes God just has to wake you up and show you who you really are now I'm not saying anything else at what brother brandham said all I'm going to say is what the scriptures and what brother brandham showed us who we are that's it there's nothing fancy to it this is actually your true identity okay and if you can realize who you are then just in that because then you have dominion over every devil I don't want to get ahead of myself but let's go let's see if this one works I might switch it on there you go Mark 16 who's there say amen amen man you guys are fast I'm not even there yet I'm inan Matthew let's try that again okay so if we go there from verse 14 and verse 14 Jesus comes to the 11 so this is after he was crucified and after he showed himself to Mary he now comes to the 11 and they they there and waiting upon him and it says afterward he appeared unto the 11 please follow in your word I didn't put the scriptures up because it's time we we read and see it for ourselves handle this word for ourselves if you don't have your Bible next time bring it after he appeared unto the 11 as they sat at meat he up braided them with their unbelief and Hardness of Heart he gave them a makulu Jimmy he was very angry when he got there he actually corrected them and he says your hearts are hard and you've got unbelief because all this time I was with you and now still now you guys down wow and you have all these fluster and all these what's going on but here Jesus comes and he just sets it an on and he goes your unbelief and who you really are and what price I paid for you to be in this position TR amen may it never be us he says the hardness of your heart because they believe not them which had seen him after he was risen not that report how many times have we spoken about that Malachi F Prophet that needs to come people don't believe it God has the same yesterday today and forever people don't believe it days of Miracles Never End people don't believe it but has has it been preached time and time and time again it's like it's like the foundation of the message but people keep seem to just skim over it and Jesus is correcting these disciples and say hey there's greater things going on and the report that you got you don't believe it and this report is about me amen and then he said to them go ye into the world and preach the gospel to every creature and he that believeth is baptized shall be saved saved amen strange that we always have a fight over baptism when Jesus Christ after the atonement was made said that is the way in that's the first step you have to make is to declare to the world who you following and whose name you taking because he says there he says he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved and he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out death that's right in whose name in my name they shall cast out devils and they shall speak with new tongues and they shall take up serpents and they shall D dread drink any deadly thing and it shall not hurt them and they shall lay their hands upon the sick and they shall recover amen amen May the word the Lord add to his word let's just bow our heads quickly Lord Jesus we have opened this word now and we love you Lord but we need the author to step right in now father and take this service and Lord may you just sinking in so deep father tonight that we know that we know that you are in control Lord and we just say Lord come come Lord and Minister unto your bride we ask in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen you may be seated hallelujah amen 34 minutes left I have to or else you know me I'll just go all night brother Andy I'm like you hey but if you knew where we came from amen and you knew where we used to dwell then we would get a chance to speak about Jesus oh boy please you know it's like it it's nervous yet exciting because you always feel the two forces right here in church connecting they're always bashing heads the one wants to keep you out of service and the one wants to draw you closer to him yeah and just which one is going to win tonight children which one is going to win tonight hallelujah amen so we know oh I just lost my place here give me a sec so I want to go to something there which I read earlier on and it and it or didn't read but I wanted to read it it's John 3:15 and um I didn't read it because I thought I wouldn't but it kind of is good for us to go there so John 3:15 now remember Jesus just told the disciples the power that they have in his name and see when we look at denominations and we look at the world they all believe the same scriptures they believe that yeah and they also believe John 3:16 yeah they do believe it God so loved the world that He Sent His only begotten son they believe it but there's something I read and it and it just hit me inside and I thought man maybe if I could just explain it to you how the Lord showed it to me so um John 3 and we'll start there from verse 15 he says and whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever liveth in him should not perish believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for God has sent his son not into the world to condemn the world but the world through him might be saved we believe it but see we don't only believe that we believe Mark 16 there has to be something come with it amen because if and and brother Ben preached it so many times and and I wonder if it kind of sinks in sometimes it says Grace if you really have received Grace it's the Divine influence upon the heart and the reflection in the life so it's no works anymore it's just you reflecting Christ and whatever he puts on you you just reflect it back because you love him so so you're not trying to work yourself up to go do works for God it's those things are dead because you're going to stand before God and say God I did all this and all this and all this and he goes you never knew me yeah but but the relationship is to between the bride and Christ is a bit more personal than just John 3:16 it's a bit more personal than just the commission to go and preach the gospel it goes further than just those two scriptures yes sir so see Christ is the Cornerstone and that Cornerstone is a foundation so I put up these for the children that's a keystone so that's an arch that they build who knows what that Keystone does it holds together it holds together thank you brother Jonah it holds it together so they build both these stones and when they came come to the last piece they put that Keystone in and then they pull whatever was holding those stones up they go and everything just tightly fits together and it doesn't fall down amen and if you look at a Cornerstone and that building's got one massive Cornerstone look at that thing wow like that's a Cornerstone those guys turn the corner okay like they turn the corner amen but see that building is built upon a foundation stone and if you look at it it says a Cornerstone is a foundation stone um that is the first stone that's set into this construction okay the other stones will be set in reference to the stone so so here we go so there's a Cornerstone that's been preached in our day by Malachi 4 amen amen not not some of it not just that bit no no all of it amen The Good The Bad and The Good the really while it's the bad is sometimes when God is dealing with you and knocking on your door and saying hey what you're busy doing is not right that's the bad amen but see you have two choices you have two choices you can submit yourself to the word of God or you can reject it so you can build yourself upon a foundation where is set and remember Jesus is that stone that the bulus rejected yeah but not just the name of Jesus and the culture of Jesus but the life of Jesus Christ within the believer Hallelujah that's the whole purpose of the Bride Christ wants to come and display himself through the bride to this world cuz they fulfilling the commission that Christ has come they do the Greater Works not bigger but more of it because he's now come and he's he set himself up the day of Pentecost and he and he put himself in 120 so the Holy Spirit came in and more of God was and more of people so more of people can go out to do greater work not greater than Jesus Christ nothing can be greater than Jesus Christ but the work we all do is great am but sometimes we get so caught up in daytoday life that we forget about what our greater work is oh yeah and we go oh it's only by grace and it's not by works and hold on if you say you love me and you don't look me in the eyes and go I love you that's fine but sometimes I need a hug sometimes I need prayer sometimes I need someone just to be there for me God with flesh on yeah the purpose for the bride is not to keep this gospel to herself amen the purpose for the bride is not to believe in miracles and not let it manifest the purpose of the Bride is not to speak in tongues and not have God have preeminence in the service and correcting people people through the gifts see the gifts are important but the giver is more important right we don't major on all those things we need Christ we need the headstone we need the Keystone to our life is Christ and if you don't submit to Christ and the word because remember and I'm way off my notes but I'll tell you this in the beginning was the and the Word was with God and and the Word was God right and this word became manifest it became flesh and it dwelt among us and we beheld the glory and that word was Jesus Christ so we can't say we Believers but we don't believe the word you can't so see the purpose for God is to do this break this seed of discrepancy reasoning you know so when people say baptism in the name of Jesus Christ discrepancy comes in when they say serpy discrepancy comes in when anything is that you say and you speak the truth that the word says people that don't want it will always bring doubt and they'll always bring a reasoning to it we don't reason it we believe it amen cuz remember you're the bride of Christ you made different yeah see and this is what you don't understand is you were made different Before Time even began God already knew who you going to be prise the Lord and at least you already knew he knew when you were going to accept him you knew the words you were going to say you know you knew the moment the time down to the second and he can't wait to have that relationship with you but we forget who we are so I want to go on yeah oh that's small but you can read it I'll read it on you Christ was manifested to destroy the works of the devil is that true can I get an amen amen amen so tell me when Jesus Christ was here on Earth did any demon have authority over him no the wind the rain no water anything nothing who was walking on top of the water yeah Jesus come on man do you not see look you think it's just a story but God had so much Dominion that he even put the prophet and said to me you speak to the storm and it will seize amen so why can't you do it can I tell you a testimony it works Amen brother Ben you spoke against the storm amen you just recently shared it with your trip the Solomon Islands one day I was working on a construction site and man it was raining the whole week and I prayed to the Lord I said Lord if it has to rain let it rain your will be done but I ask this if there's any Grace upon your side for me I cannot have another day of rain in here I cannot take another day of rain it's been cold and rainy and I've been working on the road so I might see my heart but Lord I don't care your will be done cuz that's the bride yeah amen still your will be done why am I sick your will be done why is healing taking long it will be done your will be done we still Su the will of the father before we worry about ourselves and I'm going to come to it I don't want to get ahead and we're going to finish this and then I said Lord but let it not rain in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ but I first asked them and I went to work and the guys were scorning and laughing I've told a lot of people this testimony already and I said it's not going to rain today it was raining already but I said it's not going to rain today and the guys laughed at me and the one guy said why would you say that I said because I prayed and he laughed in my face haha you prayed oh M so we went inside the building never forget this and we did saw training how to cut a straight line with a saw still couldn't cut a straight line after that but did that and then we had these roller doors and we were doing was inside the roller doors doing the the the mockup you know practice how to do the blade and all those things is a big road source and then they opened the roller doors and when we walked out from the Middle where we were not from the sides not from the East the West the north the South right in the middle where we were standing the the a hole became like this and just bigger like a donut and bigger and bigger and bigger and before I got to the truck it got bigger and bigger and after that when I got in the truck started truck did everything right the sky started opening up amen I knew I knew what just happened amen they they they said the whole week it was going to rain I knew what happened then and I knew when I asked the Lord that he could do it I just wanted him to know is it in his will yeah so he saw my heart and he saw the intent of my heart and he knew that I was his bride and for him for one second he stopped and he goes if my bride doesn't want it to rain it will not rain today that's the God we serve but we forget what Authority and what terms we have with God amen we forget that he took us out of denomination he took us out of these one verse Bibles and he actually placed us higher with him saying you have authority you can speak you can pray for the sick and they'll be healed we don't believe it because we don't see it every day that don't mean it's not your commission that's so he says here and I'm just going to take a sip of water my mouth so dry and he says Christ is Manifest to destroy the works of the devil is that right the ation says amen he says you all believe that that's why he and that's what was he the word God's word which destroys I'm just going to come back here which destroys the works of that hybrid the devil so we know in the Garden of Eden I'm just going to refresh your memories uh Joshua all you guys that was on Sunday school the Lord did it again the hybrid seed came in in the Garden of Eden and that day God promised there will be enity between me and that seed and I'm going to get that seed I'm going to bruise its head I'm going to stomp at it every day that's your commission don't forget about it your loved ones the sick ones the ones that in need that's your commission that's where God can work through you but you must be there Hallelujah he wants to but we don't make ourselves available for it come on now cuz we forget who we are we don't make ourselves available so God can work through us we get distracted Ed in a lady of see and age cuz we forgot our identity our identity is to finish the works of Christ and he says now his body and we'll finish that he says he um he was done to do that he was born to do that to destroy the works of the devil now his body is to do the same so we know he's The Headstone we know he's the head and when you look at the pyramid and I'm going to go there we'll come back there now if you look at the pyramid when God restored the church ages there's a Capstone that was off and that Capstone is love that's Jesus Christ that's coming down and it's coming on top of Brotherly Love so we know Luther uh sanctification West justification westle sanctification and then the gifts came back that's fine but we not there we went further so he took us out of this he took us out of this and he lifted us into there and and what happened is that Capstone Called Love came down and it's sitting on the BR Hallelujah and now they're won but see what we forget is because we won when the hate SE move the body moves yes sir but sometimes what we do is we think we're not one we think we're still there brotherly kindness we're not we are the most dangerous weapon upon this Earth today come on now that's right do you believe it yes see we get pushed around by every demon on this planet tries to try you because remember those demons are at war with you they're not at peace with you they know they've got a limited time all those like all the denominations and I'm going to shock you the demons also believe in Jesus Christ and they fear and tremble but we don't we don't see it like this when a demon acts out against the bride you know I walked into a golf shop the one day my wife's a witness and the moment I walked in I said hello guy that guy gave me such a look of hatred never saw him in my life not in my life and I just said hi and it looked like he wanted to rip my head off and Shantel looked at me she says did you see that I said yeah know I saw that she goes man that guy really hated you I'm like and I don't know why I don't know him from a bar of soap but I knew why yes because two Spirits collided right there amen because remember I am from God Amen so I'm not saying he's Satan but definitely something was manifesting on his face that did not like the spirit that was within me cuz I'm filled with the Holy Spirit I am sealed to the day of my Redemption but I'm the Bride In Action so that means everywhere you go every demon that goes before you you have authority you can cast out demons remember Jesus said so in my name you can do that but see with the bride it's different with the bride it gets personal because that's Christ actually doing the work through you not you doing the work it's Christ coming and doing the work you just need to surrender to the headship of Christ and this is why we come back here and he says this body will do the same because the body is the head and the body The Head and the body is together that's right if Christ is the head that was the word his body would do the same thing for he's the head is that right a church of the Worden amen so now you start reasoning or talking to people about baptisms and you talk of restoration you talk to people about how God sees a woman and God sees a man and you know he's a he and not a she he she or it or they or and you start telling them that that things like being a lesbian and gay and those things are wrong and now all of a sudden they think you're judging they do but they ask you honest question I got asked by a previous boss of me what do you think about gay people because they know there's something more about you but they want to trap you in your words he should have never asked me that question because I told him what God said about it and I stopped right there so we don't lie we don't take scriptures and hide it to to make ourselves we say the word amen if they can take it they're bride if they don't take it that's between them and God so remember they have eternal life people that love the Lord Jesus he says all that the father has given me now why shall they be cast out and all that comes to me now I so be cast out okay all that the father has given me is is mine shall come to me is mine but now what he says is all that comes to me I won't cast them out so they'll have eternal life don't get it wrong there's people out there that love the Lord just as much as you really some even more than you I'm being honest it's true we meet some people this week we wash windows for old old uh for people and and retirement just thanks Ben you reminded me of that and we met this lady wonderful lady you could the moment you walk into their house great atmosphere you know there's something more in this house godly people asked my wife really nice people and she asked me hey would you like a coffee or a or some water or biscuits or anything and I said yes straight away but why why that's it I want to show you something I'm going to I'm jumping H but I want to show you something I hope it's you yes so there's two scriptures he that receiveth you receiveth me and he that receiveth me uh receiveth him that sent me and he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall get a prophet's reward okay and he that receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward and who shall ever give to drink unto these little ones a cup of water only in the name of a disciple so hold on then I thought oh so what's the name of the disciple so I went and I said and John asked him so remember there was people that was casting out Satan and they there were other people that was praying and doing the work of God and then John goes hey saying master so these others that cast um this Devils out in thy name and that follow um not us and we forbid him because because he followed not us but Jesus said forbid him not yeah don't hinder him yeah don't don't try to now go all of a sudden oh you're not in the message so you can't do the Greater Works and hold on he's busy with God's work don't speak against it that's right let him do what he does Amen okay God wants to bring him God will bring him you cannot convince him into a being the bride he is he is who he is okay the bride's different I'm going to bring it now he says um for he there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name that can lightly speak of evil of me for he that is not against us is on our part for whatsoever shall give you whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name remember said disciples name just before but in my name this is Jesus talking because you belong to Christ so it's not just any person giving you a cup of water don't get me wrong there is still people that don't like God and will give you a cup of water and they might Reserve eternal life but that don't mean they bride see this is where it's different God called you to be bride because God wants to finish his work through you different work this work is to get the electing this word is to reach the the gospel to the elect not just to everyone but the ones that God wants us to do how many times do we pray and say Lord steer me to your El on cuz the reason we're not home yet is cuz they're still elected running around come on now but see Lady and this is a thing I I really do have passion about loves this thing look when you were watching TV in the old days we could see you were watching TV but now this is distraction 101 yeah you youth I don't say throw away your cell phones don't give me wrong I want to I want to talk to parents as well all of you this is keeping you from your commission that's right preach it that's exactly right I have no I have no gripe I use this too this is a TV in your hand there's a soccer on demand this is opinions 104 second opinions third opinions fourth opinions fif Google opinions B opinions whoever this thing ain't going to get you any further with God I can guarantee you that yeah that's right help us Lord I want to ask you something the bride's commission is to be about the father's business and brother Brandon picks it up and I think it's here notic and I want to read this to you and if you start reading it read it faster than me go for it cuz I want to drill this one home got 11 minutes going this thing does not want to turn sideways technology see I use my phone too just really badly it's not funny I'm going to win now there we go notice what Harmony Jesus is that that one yeah Jesus never did anything until he seen the father or the father showed him first Harmony to between God and Christ see John 5:19 so will the bride be and he shows her his life his word life he shows her and she receives it she can't receive it when she's busy on Twitter Instagram polygram YouTube second opinions Google whatever you have these days what platform you're watching she cannot receive it when she's busy with other things that's right see the thing here here's where the rubber hits the road your friends needs Christ you need Christ Christ needs you to fulfill the work he says and and I and and I didn't listen to The Minister's meeting but there was one thing that I did catch quickly I just I because I didn't want to be swayed by any other thing before I preach is what Brother Andy said right at the end he said he said the Lord said pray ye that the Lord will send laborers into his Vineyard guys there's not much much time left wake up that's right it's been preached and it's been preached and it's been preached I'm the more I walk in this world the more she's falling apart amen people are getting murdered left right and Center even in New Zealand that didn't happen 10 years ago if there was a casualty rate over the public holidays of 10 people New Zealand would have thrown investigation why are people dying on our roads ain't the same anymore that's right young kids die drugs is taking over wake up yeah because they're following other things they're not following the headship of Christ and let me tell you something if the spirit of rock and roll LED Elvis into an early grave with drugs what if you follow Elvis where you going to end up come on you are a follower of someone you're either going to follow Christ or you're going to follow the world that's right and whoever is swinging your opinion where they end it up is where you you're going to end up because you're keeping your eyes on him but see he says she will receive this she never doubts this she doesn't she doesn't doubt this word she clings to it with all that she has yes and when she starts clinging to this word then miracles happen around her because Jesus said these signs shall follow them that believe shall follow them not lead them follow them and Jesus will go and you'll be walking one day and all of a go sudden God just goes stop has that ever happened to you yeah and he said there's two people fighting right over there it happened to me in Oakland me and brother John we were there in Oakland people were fighting and we just stopped straight in our tracks we were putting tires on the on the car brother John looked at me and I said what do we do brother John he says now we pray this is because those people need Christ and we started praying right there fight stopped within that minute that we started praying people climb back in the car and drove on why because we were there to tear down the enemy's Kingdom amen when people start uh uh reasoning and and gossiping and being depressed and those things God stops you in his tracks because you're so led by the word of God you go hold on depression is not for you amen depression is not for you stop that in the name of Jesus Christ that's not for you am see but now because I'm so surrendered to Christ and he's telling me to stop and pray for you it's not judgment amen it's your help amen it's God throwing you a LIF like and saying I will choose whoever I choose to do my work but I want you to surrender to the word because you will not see Miracles if you are out in the world you will not see Miracles if you're busy with other people's business you must be about the father's business it's not works it's life you want to see Harper come in Reuben be about the father's business you want to see your friend come in Liam be a father's business because the thing is the moment you know where you are you know when to say what because you are an assassin when it comes to against the enemy amen they don't expect you they think you're going to come in with a no you're assassin you walk right in there and the one day Harper is having a bad day and you go just and sit next to him you go hey can I pray for you oh I don't really know what prayer is that's fine I do and I know there's one that can heal you and you start praying for him and all of a sudden a God he doesn't know gets flesh and he realizes there's more to you you little young person amen than an atomic bomb has amen and that man has a Moment of clarity in his head he says then somay someone told me of your mercy Brother Andy that's your song for me amen because of Brother Andy never took the time to speak to me a sinner I wouldn't be here God somehow had to use someone to speak to me you can reject his word as much as you like but I'm telling you now if you would give five seconds yeah 5 Seconds to our Lord Jesus Christ really open up and say Lord I want to walk with you oh yes honestly say I want to walk with you and start being who you are the bride of Christ you don't need to attain to it he'll make you that you just walk with him it's not you that can do it you just surrender am yeah here we go who knows the scripture there we go bries commission who knows the scripture Brother Andy please give me this I'll tell you now hold on Ephesians 5:22 go there right now this is it and I'll end up with this cuz I'm over time I want to tell you what's the bride's commission go to Ephesians 5 all of you amen and somebody can read faster than me can even read it if they want who knows this brother Ben you should know this one cuz you you had a couple of these already he I've heard brother Brin preach this instructions for marriage there's a such a wonderful thing this I was running around because I was thinking of all the young ones that got me married while we were getting old okay that wasn't why I was [Laughter] running oh God why do you just see this now it just dawned on me this afternoon that you don't need to try it's not about your trying you cannot do it but let's read this please all together I'll try my best English and we'll finish with this it says wives submit yourself unto your husbands now hold on I'm not trying to put you in your place this is Christ speaking to the church as well okay remember this says we are the bride of Christ yeah okay amen so that even means children listen to your mom and dads if you read between the lines he says unto your own husbands as unto the Lord for the husband is the head and the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the sa the savior of the body yeah so if you can subject yourself to Christ he can start the work in your life there we go amen isn't that true amen amen yes sir it's it's not hard you you don't need to work yourself up I don't need to preach here for half an hour for you young people to realize it if you can submit yourself to Christ yeah he can start saving your body am Hallelujah you can't put yourself in a r Rapture therefore as church is subject unto Christ so let your wives be unto the husbands in everything so as Christ and the church is subject to Christ in everything you do yeah so before you walk into uh a a classroom Lord just be with me before you meet a friend Lord just guide my words before you come to church Lord speak to me today isn't that the attitude of the Bride isn't that the commission is the commission of the Bride is not just to do the Greater Works but to subject herself to Christ fully sir in everything she does I'm going to drink this glass of water Lord bless this water because this is for me Glory HL oh come on that's how we should be amen you know not just oh bless this water and thank you we go Lord bless this water sanctify it put it in my body I don't want to put anything in this eyes this mouth that's not for your glory amen yeah including this be careful what you eat and then we go on he says husbands love your wives even even as Christ loved the church so he'll pick a pastor like brother Ben to come and preach to you and appointed time to say hey let's go on cuz there's no one with a heart like that man we are all Witnesses of that amen if if I've ever seen a Healing Ministry of the heart someone that likes Christ and loves him and his people is brother Ben amen I've never never ever come brother Ben I'm sorry but that's true I'm not sorry it's true you know I've seen I've seen you in action I've seen the burden of people I've seen when you pray for people this man is so surrendered to Christ that when you come with a burden he is right in there with you that's all of us should be like that amen now he's got a pastoral gift and that's fine but all of us should have that if I say my backas saw I need all of you to climb on that chat and say we are praying for you if I say I'm fighting uh illness all of you should pray with me for that illness Amen in sincerity I promise you you'll see what God will do with this church yes sir M there will be nothing that can stand in front of the Bride there is nothing that can stand in front of it we just need to wake up and submit ourselves keep going warm as there that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the water of the the what he's going to give you his word and it will cut and it will hurt and it will heal and it will give you overcoming power but please whatever you do take time take time in the word and let's go on cuz we're going to stop at verse 27 that um that he might present it to himself as a glorious church not having spot nor wrinkle or any any such a thing but that it should be holy and without blemish so he's going to if you subject yourself to him he's going to clean you up so that you can approach him yeah so who's doing the work the man can come up who's coming come Ben come up who's doing the work tell me Christ is doing the work within your life that's my king don't fall asleep now this is important Christ said if you can subject yourself to my word if you can subject yourself to me I will clean you I will sanctify you and I will present you to me as a holy bride a virtuous woman amen amen and Isabella almost made it to the front amen so I want to ask you you you most of the youth is now behind me wow praise the Lord for the Youth amen but I want to ask you some and what said I'm out of time wow that's good I want to ask you something how much time do you take to entertain the word of God in your life and how much time do we take to entertain everything else now now now hold on we're all busy just hear me out if you could give the day of time for Christ your your prime time I can promise you God will show you your commission yeah cuz he will lead you because because remember Jesus did nothing until the father showed him that and if you make Jesus Christ your head and you you you absolutely like Ephesians and maybe go put that out on your wall subject yourself to the word of God which is Christ Jesus you will reap what he is sowing amen because he SWS it into your life and then when you come before your friends and they in need of Christ guess what you know where you're standing God knows where you're standing and now he can use you for his glory am amen amen let us just stand there um let's go is there who who's got a song for me CU brother Annie give me a song There He Is My Everything let's sing he is my everything he is my all amen
