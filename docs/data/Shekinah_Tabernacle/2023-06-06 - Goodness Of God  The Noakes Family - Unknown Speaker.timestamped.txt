[0:10] I love you, Lord,
[0:15] for your mercy never fails me.
[0:21] All my days
[0:23] I've been held in your hands.
[0:29] From the moment that I wake up
[0:33] until I lay my head.
[0:38] Oh, I will sing
[0:40] of the goodness
[0:42] of God.

[1:16] of God.

[2:25] of God.
[2:30] Your goodness is running after. It's
[2:34] running after me.
[2:38] Your goodness is running after. It's
[2:42] running after me.
[2:45] With my life laid down, I'm surrendered
[2:48] now. I give you everything.
[2:54] Your goodness is running after. It's
[2:58] running after me.
