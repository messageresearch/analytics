[29:29] okay hello god bless you all um so the
[29:33] band have been practicing and
[29:36] um what what
[29:40] we've been working on our own songs
[29:42] because it's a bit more interesting
[29:44] than doing someone else's songs so
[29:48] um yeah each week we're practicing on
[29:50] some new
[29:51] new songs that we've written so this was
[29:54] this was one
[29:54] that actually we wrote some of it during
[29:56] the song service and then
[29:58] we've kind of worked on it and got the
[29:59] rest done you i think we tried to do it
[30:02] about two weeks ago
[30:04] a brother andy tried to do it
[30:07] didn't quite work but we've got the
[30:10] words up so what we're going to do is
[30:11] we're going to do it once and then
[30:12] we will teach it to you guys so you can
[30:15] sing the second time through and then
[30:16] we'll just carry on with the worship
[30:18] after that
[30:18] um we're going to do it twice this the
[30:23] faster
[30:24] version so let's just do the chorus once
[30:26] through like we'll just do it the same
[30:27] both times
[30:28] and during when song leaders thought
[30:30] they can do it how they want to
[30:32] and also there are words here that are
[30:34] interchangeable so the song leaders can
[30:36] whoever does it on the day can change
[30:38] the word that they want to change it to
[30:40] you'll know the song um so where's
[30:42] lataba is she
[30:44] you're singing what no no come on you
[30:46] gotta come up here
[30:47] and um debra
[31:02] so i want to try and do a fast song and
[31:04] a slow song every two weeks so next week

[31:08] going to teach you a fast one and then
[31:09] it's going to be a slow one
[31:10] fast slow so yep
[31:13] and then we want to for the song leaders
[31:15] too we want to try and keep these songs

[1:05:27] we just want to commit the reading of
[1:05:29] your word into your hands lord i pray
[1:05:30] you bless the reading of your word as
[1:05:31] we've just read your word
[1:05:33] and may take the service under your
[1:05:34] divine control lord
[1:05:36] for your glory lord mate leave human
[1:05:38] control and go into your control
[1:05:40] we ask these things in jesus christ's
[1:05:42] name amen
[1:05:44] amen god bless you friends you may have
[1:05:45] your seats this morning so i want to
[1:05:47] speak about uh
[1:05:49] it's a very simple uh subject but
[1:05:52] i want to talk about becoming a lamb and
[1:05:55] um
[1:05:55] brother braham says this and uh i just
[1:05:58] want to
[1:05:58] jump to this as as i've said i don't
[1:06:00] like slideshows because they never start
[1:06:03] you know
[1:06:06] brother bram i'm sorry i think sister
[1:06:08] julie hazeldon put this on the sisters
[1:06:10] chat then christine sent it to me i
[1:06:11] thought it was very outstanding
[1:06:13] says you brother you say brother brown
[1:06:15] what is the way back to the
[1:06:16] old-fashioned meetings
[1:06:18] just become lambs again that's all just
[1:06:21] get back to being sheep the dove hasn't
[1:06:23] gone very far he's just waiting for a
[1:06:25] chance to get back
[1:06:26] there's the road back to azusa street
[1:06:28] now we'll talk about that later but you
[1:06:30] know
[1:06:30] we shouldn't shun when people say let's
[1:06:33] i would like to have azusa street
[1:06:35] we're not going back to azusa street
[1:06:36] because god has gone on but god doesn't
[1:06:38] take away he
[1:06:39] adds right we believe in justification
[1:06:41] but even a greater way than luther
[1:06:42] preached it
[1:06:43] and then he added sanctification but we
[1:06:45] believe in sanctification a greater way
[1:06:46] than weasley
[1:06:47] taught it because wesley just thought
[1:06:50] it's a human method to being sanctified
[1:06:51] but we know the blood of jesus christ
[1:06:53] cleanses us
[1:06:54] sanctifies us and we know we have the
[1:06:56] gifts of the spirit
[1:06:57] and we have the giver of the gifts as
[1:06:59] well hallelujah so
[1:07:02] there's a road back to azusa street
[1:07:03] that's the place back back to the azusa
[1:07:05] street meetings again
[1:07:06] it should turn to a lamb nature again
[1:07:09] so what's those old-fashioned meetings
[1:07:11] where god just takes over
[1:07:13] service leaves human control goes beyond
[1:07:15] what the notes are here or what we think
[1:07:18] or whatever and god just takes over
[1:07:20] that's that's the meetings we want and
[1:07:21] to me that's why we gather is not that
[1:07:24] because church is not to be man
[1:07:25] controlling man it's god controlling man
[1:07:28] amen says god is remember i'm really i
[1:07:30] think it was jason watkins said this he
[1:07:31] said so he's the pastor of his church
[1:07:33] but he said he's now the assistant
[1:07:35] pastor of the church
[1:07:36] because the pastor is jesus christ so in
[1:07:38] reality i'm just the assistant pastor of
[1:07:40] this church i'm not the one who's
[1:07:41] leading this deal and that's the lord
[1:07:43] jesus christ who is
[1:07:44] you know in in control but you know we
[1:07:46] want to go to have those
[1:07:48] meetings again where god just just takes
[1:07:50] over
[1:07:52] hallelujah so he said the way back to
[1:07:54] that is just to become a lamb again
[1:07:56] now there's this so i'll just throw that
[1:07:58] in there and we'll go back and we'll get
[1:08:00] there again and you know here we are so
[1:08:02] um anyone who reads fast don't read too
[1:08:06] fast now
[1:08:07] so jesus now brother braham said that
[1:08:09] this was the most outstanding one of the
[1:08:10] most outstanding pieces of scripture
[1:08:13] where god and man became one now
[1:08:17] we know that jesus he was the god man
[1:08:20] but by his blood amen god cleanses us in
[1:08:23] such a way that god can now come dwell
[1:08:25] on us once again
[1:08:26] and to me it's such an incredible thing
[1:08:28] we think that god can take
[1:08:30] take people where the bible says not one
[1:08:32] man seeks after god
[1:08:34] no not one it's not even in man's heart
[1:08:36] to seek after god
[1:08:37] and you know we we come into the world
[1:08:39] you know we're born in sin shaped an
[1:08:41] iniquity come to the world speaking lies
[1:08:43] that's putting a few scriptures together
[1:08:44] just condensing it
[1:08:45] and that's how we're fashioned that's
[1:08:47] how we're upon the earth but yet god and
[1:08:49] his infinite grace and mercy
[1:08:51] will cleanse the people in such a way
[1:08:53] that he can now dwell on the inside of
[1:08:55] the inside of them and he can live his
[1:08:57] life
[1:08:57] through them and now all the way down
[1:09:00] through the scripture god has had sheep
[1:09:02] it's not just new testament it's bad
[1:09:04] it's your old testament has been cheap
[1:09:05] as well
[1:09:06] but as if god and man can stay
[1:09:08] reconciled
[1:09:09] because jesus he never had a wolf nature
[1:09:12] he always had a lamb nature
[1:09:13] he was born with that nature because he
[1:09:15] was born without sin he was tempted on
[1:09:17] all points like we are but yet without
[1:09:18] sin he didn't have a fallen nature he
[1:09:20] did not need to be redeemed
[1:09:22] amen he was always a lamb but we are
[1:09:25] born with a jewel nature
[1:09:27] we have a wolf nature that we have with
[1:09:29] our first birth
[1:09:30] it doesn't matter how kind someone can
[1:09:32] be they still need redeeming
[1:09:34] and then once we're born again we
[1:09:36] receive a lamb nature we receive god's
[1:09:38] own nature
[1:09:39] but that wolf nature unfortunately this
[1:09:41] thing is still alive
[1:09:42] otherwise it would be six feet under
[1:09:44] somewhere you know there'll be a
[1:09:46] tombstone
[1:09:47] you know and and that's why we're
[1:09:48] looking for body changes because we want
[1:09:50] these bodies to be changed
[1:09:51] harley the guy you look in the mirror
[1:09:53] every morning i want this guy to be
[1:09:55] changed
[1:09:56] that's why the world is full of
[1:09:57] self-help books and different things
[1:09:58] well
[1:09:59] the best self-help book really is is the
[1:10:01] scripture
[1:10:02] i mean will you yield to it and say lord
[1:10:04] just change my nature change my life
[1:10:06] to match yours amen as the scripture
[1:10:08] says that we would be partakers of his
[1:10:10] divine nature
[1:10:11] and to be a partaker of his divine
[1:10:13] nature is not you trying to
[1:10:14] mold yourself into it it's not us trying
[1:10:16] to push ourselves into a form and say no
[1:10:18] i'm like jesus
[1:10:19] it's us surrendering to his word and he
[1:10:22] molds and shapes us you know
[1:10:23] sometimes that process can be very
[1:10:25] frustrating but you know eventually we
[1:10:27] get there
[1:10:27] you ever seen a little baby trying to
[1:10:29] roll over or crawl or walk or talk or
[1:10:31] there's there's moments of frustration
[1:10:34] but there's a desire
[1:10:35] i want to walk i want to be big you know
[1:10:37] i want to join my siblings and run
[1:10:39] around and you know and it can be like
[1:10:41] us we can see how the lord is in the
[1:10:42] word and
[1:10:43] you know and the message and and we can
[1:10:45] get frustrated ourselves but as long as
[1:10:47] we just
[1:10:47] remember if he started a work he's going
[1:10:49] to finish that work
[1:10:50] hello and he's real determined i'm going
[1:10:52] to have a people made in my image
[1:10:54] they're not going to be
[1:10:55] just a patch up job or you know
[1:10:57] sometimes we do a job and i'll confess
[1:10:59] sometimes we think well that's good
[1:11:00] enough
[1:11:01] and someone else comes along and says
[1:11:02] that's not good enough god's not that
[1:11:04] kind of good enough kind of god
[1:11:06] he's going to do a thorough work he's
[1:11:08] going to do a thorough that no one can
[1:11:09] say no that's not good enough
[1:11:11] it's good enough hallelujah so
[1:11:15] there's this battle now to to to stay as
[1:11:18] a lamb
[1:11:19] now you remember when you know if you if
[1:11:22] you read through church history
[1:11:23] you know god moved in a powerful way at
[1:11:25] azusa street we can't take away from
[1:11:27] that that was a work of god
[1:11:28] and for years before that the whole
[1:11:30] whole city of los angeles all the
[1:11:32] christians were actually praying for
[1:11:33] revival there was actually a great
[1:11:34] hunger and a thirst
[1:11:36] to see god live god was preparing people
[1:11:38] and then and then at
[1:11:40] um at azusa studio in the house in the
[1:11:42] zeus street mission god came down in a
[1:11:43] powerful way and it spread around the
[1:11:45] world
[1:11:46] but then what happened is man become to
[1:11:48] come in because remember
[1:11:50] god i mean the devil he doesn't want us
[1:11:52] to be rejoicing
[1:11:54] he doesn't want us to have camp meetings
[1:11:55] all the time he doesn't want himself to
[1:11:57] be cast out
[1:11:58] he wants to find a toehold somewhere
[1:12:01] because if he can have a toe hold you
[1:12:02] ever seen someone climbing like free
[1:12:04] climbing a cliff
[1:12:06] they really they go they test and they
[1:12:07] try the holes and especially those
[1:12:09] people that climb up some crazy
[1:12:11] hundreds of meters up they've got no
[1:12:12] harness and it's like a wall that's like
[1:12:14] this and they're you know
[1:12:15] they're they're they're looking for a
[1:12:16] grip that's like the devil in our lives
[1:12:19] he's looking for a place he can
[1:12:20] put his feet and get leverage and climb
[1:12:22] higher and you know
[1:12:24] so he doesn't like being thrown off the
[1:12:25] cliff but we love to see him being
[1:12:27] thrown off don't we
[1:12:28] that's why we have church we like to see
[1:12:30] him just get thrown off get out of here
[1:12:32] devil you
[1:12:32] you've been evicted hallelujah but you
[1:12:34] see he always tries to make it that he
[1:12:36] can get a toehold so
[1:12:37] so azusa street started off in power
[1:12:41] but it quickly turned into a
[1:12:43] denominational move
[1:12:44] where where the power of god basically
[1:12:46] left and it just just went everywhere
[1:12:47] but it wasn't the magnitude of was
[1:12:49] what it was at the beginning and why was
[1:12:51] that because there were lambs
[1:12:54] but then the enemy came in and brought
[1:12:57] up that wolf nature
[1:12:58] and it caused division and arguments and
[1:13:00] then and then it became not
[1:13:02] let god live and let god lead us into
[1:13:04] all truth of the scripture
[1:13:06] but it was now no i'm right and you're
[1:13:08] wrong
[1:13:09] and then what happened then the power of
[1:13:10] god lifted off because god does not
[1:13:12] dwell anywhere
[1:13:14] he how could how could you know jesus he
[1:13:17] was
[1:13:17] his nature of a lamb and the nature of
[1:13:19] the dove have same kind of natures
[1:13:21] what if john said behold the wolf of god
[1:13:23] that takes away the sin of the world
[1:13:25] jesus would have got baptized there
[1:13:27] wouldn't be no spirit of god descend
[1:13:28] upon him
[1:13:29] because the dove would look at him say i
[1:13:31] can't land there
[1:13:33] we got nothing in common hallelujah
[1:13:36] but those at azusa street when when when
[1:13:39] god put his spirit out
[1:13:40] they were lambs they were yielded they
[1:13:42] were hungry they they just got
[1:13:43] rid of all their mouths and strife and
[1:13:45] trouble whatever more and god said i can
[1:13:47] dwell on those people
[1:13:49] but then the enemy came in scattered all
[1:13:51] those things and like brother bam even
[1:13:52] said and christ is a mystery god
[1:13:54] revealed you know you're one big sweet
[1:13:55] humble group now
[1:13:57] but the devil's gonna bring someone and
[1:13:58] shoot them with poison spread it through
[1:14:00] the church cause divisions
[1:14:02] you know because the devil's not going
[1:14:03] to let you stay this way and he warned
[1:14:05] them that it would happen
[1:14:07] and it happened unfortunately just like
[1:14:09] paul would say in the book of ephesians
[1:14:11] he said i've been warning you for three
[1:14:12] years with tears that after my departure
[1:14:15] some among you are going to raise up and
[1:14:16] scatter the flock
[1:14:18] see and they were sitting under paul's
[1:14:20] ministry and he was warning this is
[1:14:22] going to happen but paul didn't know who
[1:14:23] it was
[1:14:24] he said but the devil's going to try and
[1:14:25] come in and destroy
[1:14:27] and that's what he does try to destroy
[1:14:29] but now the challenge is now
[1:14:31] can we stay surrendered to the lord
[1:14:34] that the devil tries to get a toehold in
[1:14:36] our lives and he just can't do it
[1:14:38] it's like we're teflon covered you know
[1:14:39] he just tries to grab and
[1:14:41] you know have you ever seen someone
[1:14:42] covered in grease or you try and grab
[1:14:44] them and it just doesn't work and
[1:14:45] you know we should be greasy by the holy
[1:14:49] ghost talia that the devil can't get a
[1:14:51] grip
[1:14:52] that's how we want to be hallelujah
[1:14:56] if that's safe that's how you get out of
[1:14:58] church i want to be greasy hallelujah
[1:15:01] you know we know we are his body upon
[1:15:03] the earth the apostle paul would say
[1:15:05] that
[1:15:06] uh that the god of our lord jesus christ
[1:15:09] the father of glory may give unto you
[1:15:11] the spirit of wisdom and revelation and
[1:15:13] the knowledge of him
[1:15:14] the eyes of your understanding being
[1:15:16] enlightened that ye may know what is the
[1:15:18] hope of his calling
[1:15:19] and what the riches of the glory of of
[1:15:21] his inheritance in the saints
[1:15:23] and what is the exceeding greatness of
[1:15:25] his power to us would who believe
[1:15:28] according to the working of his mighty
[1:15:29] power who he wrought in christ when he
[1:15:32] raised him from the dead and set him
[1:15:34] at his own right handed in the heavenly
[1:15:36] places far above all principality and
[1:15:39] power
[1:15:39] might and dominion and every name that
[1:15:41] is named not only in this world but also
[1:15:43] in that which is to come you know i love
[1:15:46] that song you know
[1:15:47] not today i just think that quote
[1:15:48] brother says house of hell give way to
[1:15:50] the name of jesus christ
[1:15:52] hallelujah you know we know where the
[1:15:53] word of god is being manifested
[1:15:55] that is that is where the name of jesus
[1:15:57] christ is i mean so
[1:15:59] here in this place you can say you know
[1:16:01] when you come along you should be able
[1:16:03] to say the devil give way to the name of
[1:16:05] jesus christ basically give way to the
[1:16:07] spirit of god within me
[1:16:08] amen nothing can stand in his way as we
[1:16:11] just read there
[1:16:12] everything in this world next world amen
[1:16:14] it must bow to the name of jesus christ
[1:16:16] that's why we shouldn't have to put up
[1:16:17] with anything of the devil
[1:16:20] hallelujah amen and hath put all things
[1:16:23] under his feet
[1:16:24] and gave him to be the head over all
[1:16:26] things to the church
[1:16:28] which is his body the fullness of him
[1:16:30] that filleth all in all
[1:16:32] you know to me if something fills
[1:16:34] something it's full
[1:16:36] you know this bottle is not full
[1:16:39] there's a gap but if it was full it
[1:16:41] would be full and there's no room for
[1:16:42] anything else in this bottle
[1:16:44] if it's full of water so so that no oil
[1:16:47] can go on there
[1:16:48] nothing can go on there because it's
[1:16:49] full
[1:16:51] so if we're filled with the goodness of
[1:16:52] god there ain't no room for nothing else
[1:16:55] amen there's no room for gossip for
[1:16:56] malice for strife for ill feeling funny
[1:16:59] feeling towards one another
[1:17:00] you know you know contention river maybe
[1:17:03] i'm sorry i'm full
[1:17:04] the devil tries to give give you some
[1:17:06] box of rattlesnakes of gossip or hatred
[1:17:08] malice you know whatever
[1:17:09] say sorry the house is full you know you
[1:17:12] look around i know brother cabin
[1:17:13] probably has the trouble with his
[1:17:15] warehouse he looks around this place is
[1:17:16] full
[1:17:17] where is this going to go and he has to
[1:17:19] make it fit because it's stuff he
[1:17:20] ordered
[1:17:20] but when his stuff he maybe didn't order
[1:17:22] he said sorry return it to sender
[1:17:23] there's no place for it
[1:17:25] hallelujah same thing with the devil he
[1:17:26] tries to give you sickness gives you
[1:17:28] trouble
[1:17:28] gives you whatever you say i'm sorry i
[1:17:30] didn't order this and my house is full
[1:17:32] hallelujah glory
[1:17:36] now um
[1:17:39] noah here would send out two birds when
[1:17:42] you know after the flood while the
[1:17:43] waters are receding and he
[1:17:45] and he and he sends out two birds to see
[1:17:47] if there's dry land and he sends out a
[1:17:49] raven he sends out a dove now
[1:17:51] notice that he so so he seemed for the
[1:17:52] raven which went to and fro until the
[1:17:55] waters were dried up
[1:17:56] from off the earth and he sent a dove
[1:18:00] from him to see if the waters were
[1:18:01] abated from off the face of the earth
[1:18:04] so so these birds are sent out to see is
[1:18:06] there anywhere to rest
[1:18:08] is there any light you know is there
[1:18:09] anywhere where these ones can land and
[1:18:11] if they can well they will and if not
[1:18:12] they'll come back now
[1:18:14] the dove found no place for the soul of
[1:18:16] her foot
[1:18:17] and she returned unto him into the ark
[1:18:19] for the waters were in the face of the
[1:18:20] whole earth
[1:18:21] then he put forth his hand and took her
[1:18:24] and pulled her in unto him into the ark
[1:18:27] so now
[1:18:28] this raven we know it's a scavenger
[1:18:30] they're a bunch of dead stuff have you
[1:18:32] ever seen a flood
[1:18:33] after a flood you know there's you know
[1:18:35] there's silt and there's dead
[1:18:36] animals and you see like a flood go
[1:18:38] through farmland all the sheep and
[1:18:40] cows that drowned are pushed against
[1:18:41] fences and there's debris and it's just
[1:18:43] death
[1:18:44] now a raven would fly out no doubt
[1:18:46] because he's stuck in the zaki flies out
[1:18:47] and says
[1:18:48] oh boy i'm going to have a good time all
[1:18:50] the things i wanted to eat now i'm going
[1:18:52] to eat them
[1:18:52] go eat a giraffe and whatever and you
[1:18:54] know and because but the reason that he
[1:18:57] didn't have to come back to the ark is
[1:18:59] because he could be identified with that
[1:19:01] death
[1:19:02] because his nature was i'm a scavenger i
[1:19:04] can eat anything that's dead doesn't
[1:19:06] matter what it is he can just have a big
[1:19:07] time
[1:19:08] you know filling his belly because the
[1:19:11] nature of the raven
[1:19:12] was associated with dead things but the
[1:19:15] dove found no rest for the soul of her
[1:19:17] foot because the nature of the dove does
[1:19:19] not
[1:19:20] does not match with death he saw the
[1:19:23] same bloated maybe dead cattle beast the
[1:19:24] raven saw the raven said
[1:19:26] here's breakfast the dove said that's
[1:19:28] not breakfast
[1:19:29] i can't eat it i'm not built my nature
[1:19:31] does not associate with this dead animal
[1:19:33] but the ravens did so you know you know
[1:19:35] his brother umpol was
[1:19:36] preaching on wednesday to me it was
[1:19:38] tremendous about hunger
[1:19:41] and the hunger of the raven was
[1:19:42] satisfied with dead rotting things
[1:19:45] because it's hunger because it's nature
[1:19:47] manifested in a hunger
[1:19:48] so its nature was for dead things so
[1:19:50] that so that transferred to a hunger and
[1:19:52] wanted to eat dead things
[1:19:54] so so its hunger was satisfied with dead
[1:19:57] riding things but the
[1:19:58] but the nature of the dove was not of
[1:20:01] death
[1:20:02] so it couldn't associate with hunger for
[1:20:04] dead things so it couldn't eat them
[1:20:06] they could not find a place you know
[1:20:07] that that raven could rest on the dead
[1:20:09] cattle beast
[1:20:10] there's a good place to rest the dove
[1:20:11] said i can't sit i can't put my claws on
[1:20:13] that thing
[1:20:14] and i had to take his flight so dove the
[1:20:17] dove could not find
[1:20:18] rest with dead things and it couldn't
[1:20:20] eat dead things see the dove was looking
[1:20:22] for signs of life now
[1:20:23] remember he's the lamb of god that takes
[1:20:25] away the sin of the world and the spirit
[1:20:26] of god descended upon him like a dove
[1:20:29] right so here is now you can say the
[1:20:30] spirit of god going upon the earth
[1:20:32] to look for a place to rest as as he
[1:20:35] said in the book of isaiah heaven is my
[1:20:37] throne earth is my footstool but where's
[1:20:39] the place of my rest
[1:20:40] and we could say here i am lord i'm the
[1:20:42] place of your rest the soul of man is
[1:20:44] the
[1:20:45] place for god to rest so this dove was
[1:20:46] looking for a place to rest
[1:20:48] but it found no place because it was
[1:20:50] looking for signs of life now
[1:20:52] it's to me it's interesting that the
[1:20:54] dove would would find an olive
[1:20:56] leaf and pluck it off now we know no no
[1:21:00] this is just me and my mind but you know
[1:21:02] we know that we are the wild olive
[1:21:04] grafted into the tree
[1:21:05] you know just as you know israel's a
[1:21:07] natural natural olive branch was pulled
[1:21:10] out
[1:21:10] and we were grafted in so now the dove
[1:21:14] representing the holy ghost came to
[1:21:15] where the olive tree is
[1:21:17] hallelujah so now that dove so we should
[1:21:19] be an olive tree
[1:21:20] right where the spirit of god can
[1:21:22] descend and abide and find rest
[1:21:25] hallelujah i mean so
[1:21:28] so the dove found a place to rest
[1:21:30] eventually which was that olive tree a
[1:21:32] place of life
[1:21:33] but the raven already found a place
[1:21:35] which was dead things now
[1:21:36] as you know the spirit of god can only
[1:21:38] associate with life
[1:21:40] not with death not with blackness and
[1:21:42] skulls and
[1:21:44] all that dark stuff which you see out
[1:21:45] there god kind of
[1:21:47] god that is not god being identified
[1:21:50] right he says i can't you know but he
[1:21:51] only associates with life
[1:21:53] and we know life grows it has a force
[1:21:56] behind it you know actually
[1:21:57] you know it's wholesome it grows it
[1:21:58] matures it gets more and more it doesn't
[1:22:00] it doesn't decay
[1:22:01] you know death just decays and rots and
[1:22:03] gets worse but
[1:22:04] life actually increases now i said that
[1:22:07] god has always had lambs
[1:22:10] moses i i just use this example moses
[1:22:12] was to me
[1:22:14] one of the first lambs but he had to get
[1:22:16] into a condition
[1:22:18] you know harry so this is him and you
[1:22:21] know and
[1:22:21] you think what an incredible process god
[1:22:23] had to put him through
[1:22:25] to get to this spot here he is this is
[1:22:27] after mount sinai and god spoke with
[1:22:29] them they've come through the red sea
[1:22:31] all those things have happened
[1:22:32] and he says now moses was very meek
[1:22:34] above all the men which are upon
[1:22:37] the face of the earth so he so so he was
[1:22:39] a very meek man but he didn't start off
[1:22:41] this way
[1:22:42] can you imagine being raised as the
[1:22:44] prince of the house of egypt
[1:22:46] being the meekest man in all the earth
[1:22:48] no because remember pharaoh was
[1:22:49] considered a god he was the god of the
[1:22:51] egyptians manifested in human flesh
[1:22:53] he was a god to them so you think this
[1:22:56] you know the man who could potentially
[1:22:58] be the next pharaoh do you think he'd be
[1:22:59] a meek fellow
[1:23:00] here make way for moses prince of egypt
[1:23:03] and all the trumpets and he walks out
[1:23:04] carries himself like
[1:23:06] he's you know made of gold and you know
[1:23:08] that's not a meat kind of man proud and
[1:23:10] he has a personality where people look
[1:23:12] at him say this is more than a man
[1:23:14] amen but he had to come to a place after
[1:23:17] 40 years on the back side of the desert
[1:23:19] with a high tempered
[1:23:20] wife and all this trouble and different
[1:23:21] things going on god knows how to mold us
[1:23:24] you know we're we may be going through
[1:23:25] real troubles in time god's molding
[1:23:28] and god's working hallelujah you know
[1:23:30] brother brown would
[1:23:31] preach a sermon called the unchanging
[1:23:34] god coming in an unexpected way
[1:23:36] unexpected time and he says normally
[1:23:38] when trouble sets in
[1:23:40] that's when that unchanging god is going
[1:23:41] to meet you you know brother brown would
[1:23:43] say he'd go out in the woods he'd pray
[1:23:45] and you know the birds would chatter too
[1:23:47] much and the mosquitoes would bite them
[1:23:48] and different things going on
[1:23:50] and he said i know when that's happening
[1:23:51] god's about to speak
[1:23:53] hallelujah because the devil's trying to
[1:23:54] distract and all these troubles goes on
[1:23:56] and
[1:23:57] you know he's praying you're the
[1:23:58] mosquitoes land he just says fill up
[1:24:00] boys
[1:24:01] come and have your fall because i'm
[1:24:03] going to be praying hallelujah
[1:24:05] no i wouldn't recommend that necessarily
[1:24:06] but you know but but what he's saying
[1:24:08] basically is he wasn't going to allow
[1:24:10] those distractions
[1:24:12] you know i was i was sitting here last
[1:24:13] night preparing and and i
[1:24:15] i literally nodded off a couple of times
[1:24:17] just there and i and i
[1:24:18] i just i just pray i said i rebuked the
[1:24:21] spirit of
[1:24:22] tiredness i'm not going to fall asleep
[1:24:24] here and i just became wide awake again
[1:24:27] you know i'm not going to fall asleep
[1:24:29] well
[1:24:30] i'm glad anyway but you know we
[1:24:32] shouldn't you know we should expect
[1:24:34] trouble you know oh hardship's here well
[1:24:37] god's trying to get to us
[1:24:38] but the devil's trying to ward off his
[1:24:40] visitation
[1:24:41] i mean so moses after to me after he met
[1:24:45] the lord in the burning bush he became
[1:24:47] the meekest man in all the earth because
[1:24:49] because what happened was moses received
[1:24:51] the law by revelation
[1:24:53] he didn't go to a school you know god
[1:24:54] did not tell moses now moses
[1:24:57] go up to jerusalem and there's a bible
[1:24:58] school there and you're going to learn
[1:25:00] this course and you're going to get this
[1:25:01] degree and then you can go deliver the
[1:25:02] people no
[1:25:03] he met god he met the one who gave the
[1:25:05] promise to abraham he met the god that
[1:25:07] same god was come to fulfill the promise
[1:25:10] he said moses you're here to fulfill the
[1:25:12] promise i've come down
[1:25:13] i've heard the cry of my people i've
[1:25:15] come down i'm sending you to do the job
[1:25:17] so because moses had all the excuses i
[1:25:19] can't speak i can't do this i can't do
[1:25:21] that and god just got mad at him
[1:25:23] who made the mouth to speak many times
[1:25:26] we say how can i ever be the bride of
[1:25:28] christ who made the bride of christ
[1:25:30] amen who's who's the workman working on
[1:25:32] the house
[1:25:33] you know we get frustrated our humanity
[1:25:35] and our troubles we have our ups and
[1:25:37] downs and rounds abouts and
[1:25:38] trust me i have a lot of them you know
[1:25:40] you look at yourself and say lord why
[1:25:42] he said well no no don't ask why just
[1:25:44] say thank you
[1:25:45] thank you you called me hallelu thank
[1:25:47] you you called me amen
[1:25:49] hallelujah so you know moses because he
[1:25:52] received the law by revelation
[1:25:54] he became the meekest man in all the
[1:25:55] earth because remember to have a meek
[1:25:57] character like this that's part of the
[1:25:59] character of christ
[1:26:00] so when someone receives revelation
[1:26:02] you'll see the character of christ
[1:26:03] coming out of them
[1:26:05] in a greater way hallelujah that's why
[1:26:07] we should pray for revelation revelation
[1:26:09] is not just a whole bunch of learning
[1:26:10] you retain in your mind
[1:26:12] right it actually produces the character
[1:26:14] of christ in our lives
[1:26:15] you say well what about the scribes and
[1:26:17] pharisees well they were proud arrogant
[1:26:19] men because they just went to a bible
[1:26:20] school
[1:26:22] they didn't meet the god that gave the
[1:26:23] law you know hallelujah so
[1:26:25] that's why we don't want to be we should
[1:26:28] study the bible study the message but
[1:26:30] let it become a revelation
[1:26:32] it will produce a character of christ in
[1:26:34] us
[1:26:35] hallelujah so moses became a lamb
[1:26:38] now we know there were parts of his life
[1:26:40] where he stayed a lamb where god told
[1:26:42] god told him i'm going to wipe out
[1:26:44] israel i'm sick of them and i'll start
[1:26:46] with you and he stood in the gap saying
[1:26:47] lord
[1:26:48] blot my name out of the book that was
[1:26:50] being a lamb he was standing in the gap
[1:26:51] for the people
[1:26:52] he knew all their trouble he knew all
[1:26:54] their fusses he didn't say
[1:26:55] to god god they're really not that way
[1:26:57] he said just block me out lord
[1:26:59] instead of taking them that's a real
[1:27:01] lamb stand in the gap remember jesus was
[1:27:04] our lamb he's our sin barrier
[1:27:06] he stood in the gap for you and i he's
[1:27:08] our advocate today he's still standing
[1:27:10] in the gap for you or not his blood is
[1:27:11] still there for you and i hallelujah
[1:27:13] he's our intercessor he's our mediator
[1:27:15] he is working on your behalf
[1:27:17] hallelujah hallelujah so you know
[1:27:20] but then there were times where he
[1:27:22] reverted back to a wolf
[1:27:24] he got mad at the people you bunch of
[1:27:26] rebels do i have to get water out of
[1:27:28] this rock and he took the
[1:27:29] rod and he smoked the rock he's meant to
[1:27:31] speak to it why because he
[1:27:33] reverted to that wolf nature now that's
[1:27:35] just under the blood of bulls and goats
[1:27:38] under the blood of bulls and goats he
[1:27:39] could never be free of that wolf nature
[1:27:42] but under the blood of jesus christ
[1:27:44] that's why so
[1:27:45] it's so wonderful maybe there's a line
[1:27:47] of temper in your family you don't have
[1:27:49] to live with that
[1:27:50] or unforgiveness or indifference
[1:27:52] whatever you don't have to live with
[1:27:53] that kind of thing
[1:27:54] jealousy whatever it may be you don't
[1:27:56] have to live with that kind of thing
[1:27:57] because the blood can take it from you
[1:27:58] highly aware where you know the things
[1:28:00] you once did you do them no more
[1:28:02] you know just like brother braham said
[1:28:04] yeah he said he was part irish
[1:28:06] high tempered passionate and before he
[1:28:09] met the lord
[1:28:10] he wanted to kill some boys who beat him
[1:28:12] up who knows the story but the gun
[1:28:13] wouldn't
[1:28:14] go off amen and then there was that you
[1:28:16] know but then the lord
[1:28:17] saved him years later and then there was
[1:28:20] that
[1:28:21] guy who and i mean but also before he
[1:28:23] met the lord there was that
[1:28:25] man who killed one of his dogs and his
[1:28:27] dad actually stopped him because he got
[1:28:29] the same well
[1:28:30] probably the same rifle he wasn't and he
[1:28:32] was going to go after him to kill him
[1:28:34] and his dad stopped him doing it but
[1:28:36] then after he met the lord he led that
[1:28:38] same antichrist
[1:28:40] hallelujah hallelujah amen i'm glad
[1:28:44] the lord is working on me i need work
[1:28:47] you know
[1:28:48] you know some you know i joke about
[1:28:51] william having a grumpy face
[1:28:53] i said it got it from my side of the
[1:28:54] family i don't necessarily mean feel
[1:28:56] grumpy
[1:28:57] i just get this look so
[1:29:00] never judge a book by its cover you know
[1:29:04] he's having a bad day i could be having
[1:29:05] the greatest i'm just focused on
[1:29:07] something
[1:29:07] i've got to do this and do this and do
[1:29:08] this and i get that you know anyway
[1:29:10] praise the lord we'll get there one day
[1:29:13] hallelujah
[1:29:14] i'm glad we're going to be in heaven eh
[1:29:16] this thing will be you know all the all
[1:29:17] the troubles and trials will be out of
[1:29:19] the way and
[1:29:20] we'll be we'll be surrounded you know
[1:29:22] we'll surround the great king of glory's
[1:29:23] throne
[1:29:24] and hallelujah that's going to be soon
[1:29:27] amen hallelujah so moses became a lamb
[1:29:32] now joshua had to become a lamb as well
[1:29:35] amen that's the only way see he tried in
[1:29:38] his human ability thinking
[1:29:39] he was already commissioned and joshua
[1:29:41] won be strong and very courageous
[1:29:44] as i was with moses i'm going to be with
[1:29:45] you now in order for him to be with
[1:29:48] joshua as he was with moses joshua would
[1:29:50] have to get into the same condition
[1:29:51] moses was in
[1:29:53] amen that's why you see this you know
[1:29:55] there comes times in the scripture where
[1:29:56] there's a cycle of revival and death and
[1:29:58] the reason death comes after revival is
[1:30:00] the people don't stay in revival
[1:30:02] and it's to to stand revival is a
[1:30:04] condition of the heart
[1:30:06] it's not going through motions and doing
[1:30:07] the same kind of thing it's the
[1:30:08] condition of the heart will bring
[1:30:10] we'll keep a revival going on and we're
[1:30:13] living in the bride's revival the books
[1:30:14] openers and
[1:30:15] we have all things but you know this is
[1:30:17] not a time of just a three years of you
[1:30:18] know
[1:30:19] i was told you'll only have revival for
[1:30:21] three years
[1:30:23] and i just sort of my little head that
[1:30:24] may be your experience you know
[1:30:26] people try and give you their experience
[1:30:28] yeah and you know and i just say well
[1:30:30] that hasn't been my experience
[1:30:32] you know you're like yo the devil always
[1:30:34] tries to give you his experience
[1:30:36] you'll never make it well why not he
[1:30:38] can't make it
[1:30:39] you you can't forgive those people why
[1:30:41] not because he can't forgive those
[1:30:43] people
[1:30:43] you know you'll never get to heaven
[1:30:44] you're never going to rapture why
[1:30:46] because he got kicked out of heaven he
[1:30:47] can't go into rapture
[1:30:48] so he tries always to give you his
[1:30:50] experience i say devil stop trying to
[1:30:52] give you my experience
[1:30:54] i mean stop trying to give me your
[1:30:56] experience i've received the experience
[1:30:58] of the lord jesus christ
[1:30:59] holy so i'm going to walk according to
[1:31:01] that experience amen jesus went up into
[1:31:03] heaven i'm going up into heaven
[1:31:04] and then jesus conquered hell death in
[1:31:06] the grave and because he did i'm going
[1:31:08] to conquer it hallelujah
[1:31:09] so i'm going to live according to his
[1:31:11] experience you know jesus has never done
[1:31:13] anyone wrong
[1:31:14] man has done people wrong sure but the
[1:31:16] lord has never done any wrong
[1:31:18] hallelujah and we come you know i don't
[1:31:20] come to church to worship you guys
[1:31:23] i come to worship the lord jesus christ
[1:31:25] i mean so i'm going to worship according
[1:31:27] to what he has done for me and not what
[1:31:28] other people have done to me
[1:31:30] because jesus has never done me wrong
[1:31:32] he's never hurt me he's never been mean
[1:31:34] to me he's never
[1:31:35] you know tried to put a complex on me
[1:31:36] he's always tried to do me right and he
[1:31:38] always has
[1:31:40] amen isn't that true saved me when i was
[1:31:44] lost
[1:31:44] he kept me on the road i wanted to
[1:31:46] deviate he put me back on the road again
[1:31:48] i mean he corrected me when i needed
[1:31:50] correction he delivered me when i needed
[1:31:51] deliverance hallelujah heal me when i
[1:31:53] was sick aiming
[1:31:54] i mean he's done so much hasn't he so
[1:31:57] you know i think we should just worship
[1:31:58] god according to who god is
[1:32:01] hallelujah hallelujah amen the world's
[1:32:04] falling apart well should my
[1:32:05] should my walk with god fall apart no
[1:32:08] that should just get stronger
[1:32:10] hallelujah amen so joshua had to get
[1:32:14] into the same condition
[1:32:16] that moses did in order for him to
[1:32:19] continue on the ministry of moses so
[1:32:21] so here here is joshua he's walking
[1:32:23] around jericho i know you all know the
[1:32:25] story really well but no doubt he's
[1:32:26] trying to figure out how am i going to
[1:32:27] take the city
[1:32:29] and then the one who actually was there
[1:32:31] to lead the whole campaign just comes
[1:32:32] down
[1:32:33] and josh are asking me for forrester
[1:32:35] against it says no i'm not for you
[1:32:37] i'm not against you i've come to take
[1:32:39] over i remember the only way and then
[1:32:41] look what
[1:32:42] look what joshua did and joshua fell on
[1:32:45] his face on the earth
[1:32:47] hallelujah hallelujah lord shave off my
[1:32:51] own human ability
[1:32:52] shave off what i think we should do
[1:32:54] shave off my plan to take jericho
[1:32:56] i want to receive your plan to take
[1:32:58] jericho lord and not just jericho but
[1:33:00] the whole of our walk into the promised
[1:33:02] land
[1:33:02] as the same thing with you and i you
[1:33:04] know we've got a rapture to take
[1:33:06] hallelujah we've got devil to overcome
[1:33:08] we've got unbelief to cast out amen
[1:33:10] we've got we've got promises to obtain
[1:33:13] hallelujah so how's it going to be done
[1:33:15] and then the lord comes down and said
[1:33:16] lord share off my ideas
[1:33:18] i mean share all of me take all my
[1:33:20] rights everything i am
[1:33:21] hallelujah make me a lamb that you can
[1:33:22] manifest yourself through my life
[1:33:24] hallelujah isn't it incredible where god
[1:33:27] will take a people you think about we
[1:33:28] are his body
[1:33:29] amen we are a channel you think about
[1:33:31] the bride of jesus christ the believer
[1:33:33] is a channel for god to work through
[1:33:34] upon the earth
[1:33:36] highly aware you know you you read the
[1:33:38] book of acts the incredible things god
[1:33:40] did you know god could have done it
[1:33:41] himself but he sent them
[1:33:43] and he lived through them however the
[1:33:45] incredible things that they did amen
[1:33:47] raise the dead cast out devils healed
[1:33:48] the sick
[1:33:49] i mean saw visions had visitations of
[1:33:51] angels god came down upon the earth
[1:33:53] through their
[1:33:54] through those people's lives and i'll
[1:33:56] say we are the same way
[1:33:58] amen because remember this the believers
[1:34:01] around the world are writing another
[1:34:02] book of acts
[1:34:04] i mean this is not a not another book of
[1:34:06] act i mean
[1:34:07] this is not something else this is the
[1:34:08] same book of acts being rewritten
[1:34:10] where god is doing the same things
[1:34:12] hallelujah casting out devils healing
[1:34:14] the sick raising the dead the name of
[1:34:16] jesus christ is magnified
[1:34:18] people receive the holy ghost lives are
[1:34:19] changed hallelujah
[1:34:22] i mean when you read the book of acts i
[1:34:23] trust you can say i've had that
[1:34:25] experience
[1:34:26] and i've had that experience hallelujah
[1:34:28] like when the when the
[1:34:29] uh enemy brought them before a council
[1:34:31] tried to intimidate them don't preach
[1:34:33] anymore in the name of jesus christ they
[1:34:35] were beaten whatever more and you know
[1:34:37] the devil trying to put a complex on
[1:34:39] them don't witness no more
[1:34:40] don't live this life no more you stop
[1:34:43] doing what you're doing stop believing
[1:34:44] this message
[1:34:45] and then they went and had a prayer
[1:34:46] meeting and god came down and filled
[1:34:48] them shook the place
[1:34:49] and they went out with boldness
[1:34:50] hallelujah i'm sure you've had that kind
[1:34:52] of experience
[1:34:53] i mean with devil says stop believing
[1:34:55] this just do what everyone else is doing
[1:34:56] i said no i'm going to do what heaven's
[1:34:58] doing
[1:34:59] hallelujah it's worth that's a that's a
[1:35:01] good wicket to be on
[1:35:03] hallelujah so you know who said that
[1:35:05] kind of thing
[1:35:06] that's from the book of acts who's seen
[1:35:08] the devil cast out that's from the book
[1:35:10] of acts
[1:35:10] seen people be baptized named lord jesus
[1:35:12] christ that's the book of acts people's
[1:35:14] lives transform book of acts
[1:35:16] hallelujah amen because the power of god
[1:35:21] has put us forth and and we'll get to
[1:35:23] the quotes on that
[1:35:24] and the god is writing another book of
[1:35:27] acts
[1:35:28] and i love the book of acts because it's
[1:35:29] the acts of the holy ghost and the
[1:35:30] apostles
[1:35:31] it's not the acts of the apostles it's
[1:35:33] the acts of the holy ghost and the
[1:35:34] apostles
[1:35:34] and this book of acts is the axe of the
[1:35:37] holy ghost and the bride
[1:35:39] hallelujah i like that don't you amen so
[1:35:42] he fell down on his face to the earth
[1:35:44] and did worship him
[1:35:45] he says loose thy and then we're just
[1:35:47] down to verse 15. loose thy shoe from
[1:35:49] off thy foot for the place where and
[1:35:50] thou standers is holy
[1:35:52] and joshua did so that's the same
[1:35:53] commandment that moses was given
[1:35:56] amen so joshua had to become a lamb
[1:36:00] hallelujah now the lord we know
[1:36:03] jesus was a man but he's also god
[1:36:07] right he had to be he had to be fully
[1:36:09] manned because he had to be a kinsmen
[1:36:11] redeemer to become one of us
[1:36:13] to redeem us from under the curse of the
[1:36:14] law from under the power of sin
[1:36:17] right but only god could do it no man
[1:36:19] could keep the law no man could be
[1:36:20] sinless
[1:36:21] and actually be the perfect lamb no one
[1:36:23] could do it but only god becoming a man
[1:36:25] but so
[1:36:26] as a man he was led he says but jesus
[1:36:30] answered them my father worketh here
[1:36:32] unto and i work
[1:36:33] therefore the jews sought the more to
[1:36:35] kill him because he not only had broken
[1:36:37] the sabbath
[1:36:38] but also said that god was his father
[1:36:40] making himself equal with god
[1:36:42] then answered jesus said unto them
[1:36:44] verily verily i say unto you
[1:36:46] the son can do nothing of himself but
[1:36:48] what he saith the father do
[1:36:49] what things soever he doeth there also
[1:36:53] doeth the sun
[1:36:54] likewise so jesus was led by vision
[1:36:57] that's why when he went to the pool of
[1:36:58] bethesda and he saw the one man who was
[1:37:01] there for i know how long
[1:37:03] he was led by vision to that one man he
[1:37:05] stepped over cripples and different ones
[1:37:06] and he went to that one man he's led by
[1:37:08] vision
[1:37:09] hallelujah it's the same thing with you
[1:37:11] and i we see the father do
[1:37:13] then we do hallelujah
[1:37:17] amen but he had to stay remember jesus
[1:37:19] could have really been a very bitter man
[1:37:22] he had the right you know he had a
[1:37:25] he had a bad name to begin with because
[1:37:27] joseph met you know
[1:37:29] normally the firstborn looks really like
[1:37:30] the father the most
[1:37:33] everyone's got yes really
[1:37:37] isn't that right but jesus i don't
[1:37:39] believe would have looked like joseph
[1:37:41] because god was his father so you know
[1:37:44] so oh definitely mary was with a roman
[1:37:47] soldier and this is how this you know
[1:37:48] jesus came and all these things
[1:37:49] he you know he lived with that kind of
[1:37:50] black name everyone forsook him
[1:37:53] the ones he you know he came to his own
[1:37:55] his own received him not
[1:37:57] right he died of a broken heart he was a
[1:37:59] man
[1:38:00] acquainted with grief right isaiah 53 so
[1:38:03] he knew grief really well if you're
[1:38:04] acquainted with someone you
[1:38:06] build a relationship so unfortunately he
[1:38:08] built a relationship with grief
[1:38:10] he's a man of sorrow tears in agony
[1:38:13] but yet he could walk in such a way that
[1:38:15] none of those things actually hindered
[1:38:17] him
[1:38:19] to be like jesus on earth i long to be
[1:38:21] like him
[1:38:22] it didn't matter what people said about
[1:38:23] him what his enemies wanted to do
[1:38:25] he knew they wanted to kill him and they
[1:38:27] knew that he knew they would kill him
[1:38:30] amen but none of those things crippled
[1:38:34] his walk
[1:38:35] with god if i put it that way
[1:38:39] you know he cursed the fig tree he could
[1:38:41] have he could have wiped jerusalem off
[1:38:43] the map
[1:38:44] he could have done it he could have
[1:38:46] turned carefully he could just made them
[1:38:48] all disappear
[1:38:49] sent them straight to hell he could have
[1:38:50] done it but he didn't do it
[1:38:57] now jesus says i'm the good shepherd and
[1:39:00] i know my sheep and i am known
[1:39:02] and am known of mine as the father
[1:39:04] knoweth me
[1:39:05] even so i know the father and laid down
[1:39:07] my life for the sheep
[1:39:09] and other sheep i have which are not of
[1:39:10] this fold them also i must bring and
[1:39:13] they
[1:39:14] shall hear my voice and there shall be
[1:39:16] one fold and one shepherd
[1:39:18] yeah i read this i thought i'm in the
[1:39:19] bible
[1:39:21] hallelujah because i'm one of the other
[1:39:23] sheep holly had to come find me you're
[1:39:26] sure i was 2000 years down the road but
[1:39:27] there i was
[1:39:29] hallelujah bleeding in the wilderness
[1:39:30] somewhere just scrambling around he said
[1:39:32] no
[1:39:32] i've got other sheep and he was thinking
[1:39:34] of you when he was speaking these words
[1:39:36] too
[1:39:37] hallelujah hallelujah because he knew on
[1:39:40] the inside of the insider he was a
[1:39:42] sheep nature doesn't matter what your
[1:39:44] natural birth yo
[1:39:45] yo you inherited from your natural birth
[1:39:47] on the inside the inside he's a sheep
[1:39:49] nature
[1:39:50] hallelujah remember we don't come to
[1:39:52] christ because we're perfect
[1:39:54] i didn't become a you know no christian
[1:39:56] becomes a christian
[1:39:58] because they're exactly like jesus
[1:40:00] they're they're just this word being
[1:40:01] manifested and then i'll make them a
[1:40:03] christian now no it doesn't work that
[1:40:04] way
[1:40:05] we come basically you know his brother
[1:40:07] johnny de moff said
[1:40:08] a wool um yo yo sheep with a pig skin
[1:40:11] wrapped around them
[1:40:12] who remembers that you know the you know
[1:40:14] hallelujah
[1:40:15] and you know we come that way you know
[1:40:17] we come with that kind of nature but
[1:40:19] your god
[1:40:20] knows that we'd come this way and he
[1:40:22] doesn't hold us hold it against us
[1:40:24] he knows on the inside of the inside of
[1:40:26] us we have a sheep nature it's just got
[1:40:27] to come to life
[1:40:30] but a sheep must stay a sheep
[1:40:35] now this is probably very elementary but
[1:40:37] it doesn't matter
[1:40:39] what nation you go to under heaven
[1:40:43] a man marries a woman this is
[1:40:46] traditional marriage
[1:40:47] and a woman marries a man you can't i
[1:40:50] can't marry
[1:40:52] that keyboard i can't marry my
[1:40:55] i don't have a dog was just having i
[1:40:57] can't marry a dog
[1:40:58] i've got to marry the same species as me
[1:41:01] amen and it doesn't matter if just say
[1:41:03] you take i don't know what the cultures
[1:41:04] would be but you take two cultures and
[1:41:06] races upon the earth that a polar
[1:41:07] opposite and tradition and everything
[1:41:09] and outlook
[1:41:09] they can still get married right because
[1:41:12] we're all the same
[1:41:13] so like has to marry like right as i
[1:41:16] said i can't marry the synth i can't
[1:41:18] marry that plant i can't
[1:41:19] can't marry a dog i have to marry female
[1:41:23] i'll go i gotta marry a human
[1:41:25] right so now if the marriage of the lamb
[1:41:27] has come and his wife has made herself
[1:41:29] ready
[1:41:30] we're in verse seven that like has to
[1:41:32] marry like so jesus is looking
[1:41:34] he's the male lamb he's looking for a
[1:41:36] female lamb
[1:41:38] so he's looking for the same nature this
[1:41:40] is what he's looking for
[1:41:42] just like the dove coming down upon the
[1:41:43] lamb of god they had the same kind of
[1:41:45] nature
[1:41:45] he's looking for a people that have his
[1:41:47] nature
[1:41:49] hallelujah and he gives us his nature by
[1:41:51] his grace by the working of his
[1:41:53] spirit in our lives but you know so we
[1:41:56] so this is why we have to become lambs
[1:41:59] amen hallelujah i'm not saying
[1:42:03] we're not lambs right but we have to
[1:42:06] become lambs and stay lambs because the
[1:42:09] battle is not necessarily becoming a
[1:42:10] lamb the battle is staying a lamb
[1:42:13] that's the challenge of the christian
[1:42:14] walk because you know we know if you've
[1:42:16] been filled with the holy ghost
[1:42:18] you're on your way to heaven right
[1:42:20] you're sealed into the day of your
[1:42:21] redemption
[1:42:23] amen you can't be lost you can't even
[1:42:25] miss the rapture
[1:42:27] because you've been sealed in to the day
[1:42:29] of your redemption no one can break that
[1:42:30] seal the devil can't break the seal
[1:42:32] remember brother kaija at camp with the
[1:42:33] seal he said you know nothing can this
[1:42:35] one's pretty much full
[1:42:36] but you know nothing can break the seal
[1:42:39] if the seal is unbreakable
[1:42:41] so the devil can try and break that seal
[1:42:42] off your life he he can't do it
[1:42:45] so in terms of eternal security i
[1:42:48] believe in eternal security
[1:42:49] if you're eternally secure in christ
[1:42:51] you're eternally secure in christ
[1:42:53] but now the difference is now so so i
[1:42:55] trust all the fear should go out of that
[1:42:57] am i going to make it well
[1:42:58] if you're part of the word for today if
[1:43:00] the holy ghost is in you
[1:43:01] you can't miss it right you can't you
[1:43:04] have to go
[1:43:05] but the amount of victory you have in
[1:43:07] your christian walk
[1:43:09] is up to you right so the amount of
[1:43:12] victory if you want to kill every devil
[1:43:14] that comes against you
[1:43:15] or you want him to beat you up it's up
[1:43:17] to you
[1:43:19] and it's up to if you stay a lamb if you
[1:43:21] become a wolf
[1:43:23] i want all the victory i can get amen
[1:43:25] right
[1:43:26] why not hallelujah why not why not
[1:43:29] conquer everything
[1:43:30] that can be conquered you know why not
[1:43:31] take every devil that should be under
[1:43:33] our feet and put him under our feet
[1:43:35] and if he moves just stand on his head
[1:43:36] again hallelujah if
[1:43:38] unbelief comes in cast it out doubts
[1:43:40] worry strife whatever it may be
[1:43:42] just get rid of it we can by the blood i
[1:43:44] can do all things through christ jesus
[1:43:46] which strengthens me
[1:43:47] and to me that doesn't mean i'm going to
[1:43:48] win the 100 at the olympics i don't care
[1:43:50] about that i'm running a real race
[1:43:52] that race is for glory i mean so if he
[1:43:54] says we can do all things through christ
[1:43:57] i can do all things how i can overcome
[1:44:00] all things
[1:44:02] hallelujah amen by his spirit
[1:44:06] i'm glad i'm glad we serve an unlimited
[1:44:09] god
[1:44:10] you know there's not he's not a limited
[1:44:11] god he's unlimited in his ability and
[1:44:13] his power
[1:44:14] amen brother abraham says in church in
[1:44:16] its condition i'm just trying to find a
[1:44:17] screen that i can read off
[1:44:19] you couldn't love nothing that wasn't of
[1:44:21] your own nature and i was just speaking
[1:44:23] naturally i believe
[1:44:24] loving has to unite with love a husband
[1:44:27] and a wife has to love one another if
[1:44:29] they'll ever make the grade
[1:44:30] family has to love one another if they
[1:44:32] ever make the grade something
[1:44:34] to be loved you search everywhere
[1:44:36] finding a girl to be a wife that you
[1:44:38] love
[1:44:38] she searches finding a husband that she
[1:44:41] could love god searches trying to find a
[1:44:43] soul that he can love
[1:44:44] so he represented think about that god's
[1:44:47] searching for someone to love him
[1:44:51] infinite god who knows all things he's
[1:44:53] searching across the globe
[1:44:54] trying to find someone will you love me
[1:44:59] and and and i just think of my little
[1:45:01] two inches here how could you not love
[1:45:02] him
[1:45:03] how could he not give you all to this
[1:45:05] great one who just you know he's not a
[1:45:06] mean god
[1:45:07] he's not a god of we know he is a god of
[1:45:10] wrath but he's not a god of wrath
[1:45:13] i don't know him as a god of wrath i
[1:45:14] know i'm a god of mercy and grace and
[1:45:16] love and forgiveness and
[1:45:18] you know stability and that's how i know
[1:45:22] amen so you know god searches trying to
[1:45:26] find a soul that he can love so he
[1:45:27] represented himself here on earth as a
[1:45:29] gentle dove and a gentle lamb
[1:45:31] now if that lamb would be one minute
[1:45:34] ever taken on the nature of a snarling
[1:45:36] wolf
[1:45:36] that dove would have took her flight
[1:45:38] immediately she would have got
[1:45:41] away now another thing the lamb is the
[1:45:44] lamb is willing to submit its rights
[1:45:47] now god wants us to be lambs but there's
[1:45:50] so many times we don't want to submit
[1:45:52] our rights forfoot
[1:45:53] our rights so many of you say well i've
[1:45:55] got rights brother barum that's true
[1:45:58] but are you willing to fulfill your
[1:46:00] rights are you willing to give your
[1:46:01] rights that god could lead you
[1:46:04] that's what's the matter with our
[1:46:05] churches today in the great majority
[1:46:07] that the gentleness of the lamb of god
[1:46:10] we are supposed to be lambs we're
[1:46:12] supposed to be every um but
[1:46:13] we have become everything else but lambs
[1:46:16] that's the reason as soon as we get that
[1:46:18] attitude the dove of the holy spirit
[1:46:21] takes her flight
[1:46:22] and leaves what kind of rights are you
[1:46:26] talking about i'm not necessarily
[1:46:27] talking about
[1:46:27] here and dressing all those things and
[1:46:29] about you so i have a right to hold this
[1:46:31] against this person
[1:46:33] this person did me wrong this these
[1:46:35] people did me wrong i have a right to
[1:46:37] hold it against them
[1:46:38] that kind of attitude wherever
[1:46:43] if the lamb of god would have made the
[1:46:46] first snail like a wolf or done anything
[1:46:48] contrary to what the gentle dove
[1:46:50] would have permitted the dove would have
[1:46:52] took her flight
[1:46:54] she would have left in a minute and
[1:46:55] that's the reason today we're wondering
[1:46:57] what's the matter with the pentecostal
[1:46:58] church
[1:46:59] i could say what's the matter with the
[1:47:01] message church if i can bring it on home
[1:47:03] it's because we have taken on a
[1:47:04] different nature we have taken on a
[1:47:06] nature that we want our
[1:47:08] rights we're going to do what we know
[1:47:09] that's right to do
[1:47:11] and we become arrogant we become hostile
[1:47:14] we become indifferent we let temper come
[1:47:16] in we
[1:47:17] let selfishness come in that pretty much
[1:47:20] just covers everything
[1:47:22] well i'm not egg um i'm not arrogant but
[1:47:24] what about being indifferent
[1:47:25] what are being what about being hostile
[1:47:27] you know being hostile is not
[1:47:28] necessarily punching someone in the face
[1:47:30] you can have a hostile attitude towards
[1:47:32] someone and you can hold that you know
[1:47:34] things against
[1:47:35] we become indifferent and different to
[1:47:37] who
[1:47:38] to the lord we let temper come and we
[1:47:41] let selfishness
[1:47:42] come in now
[1:47:45] these these wolves are not smiling
[1:47:48] we show teeth when we smile dogs don't
[1:47:51] when they show teeth they're not smiling
[1:47:53] they're not happy these these wolves are
[1:47:55] snarling
[1:47:56] and this is where it can become where
[1:47:59] fellowship can be around something
[1:48:00] that's always negative
[1:48:02] have you heard what brother so-and-so
[1:48:03] did and sister so said this and this
[1:48:05] person oh that one you saw then why did
[1:48:07] you go see them and it's all like
[1:48:09] negative stuff and what have they got
[1:48:10] people become like wolves
[1:48:12] snarling kind of nature and all it is is
[1:48:14] to take a carcass of someone and tear
[1:48:16] them limb from limb
[1:48:19] we don't want to become this kind of
[1:48:20] people yeah but the challenge is
[1:48:22] you know not to become these kind of
[1:48:24] people because
[1:48:26] can you imagine the dove of the holy
[1:48:29] ghost resting on these guys
[1:48:32] you know you can't it just wouldn't work
[1:48:36] he wouldn't come close it's the same
[1:48:39] thing we don't want to let hostile yeah
[1:48:41] we don't want to become indifferent let
[1:48:42] temper come and let selfishness come in
[1:48:44] we don't want to become this way
[1:48:46] remember we want to see god live
[1:48:48] who wants to see jesus live that's what
[1:48:51] to me those old-fashioned meetings
[1:48:52] brother brown is talking about is when
[1:48:53] god takes supreme control of the people
[1:48:56] and god manifests himself how he wants
[1:48:58] to manifest himself
[1:48:59] i mean because you you look at if the
[1:49:01] books come open the whole contents of
[1:49:03] the book has come open then he wants to
[1:49:04] manifest to hold much
[1:49:06] not just justification not just
[1:49:08] sanctification
[1:49:09] not just the gifts of the spirit amen
[1:49:11] but the fullness of himself filling all
[1:49:13] in all
[1:49:14] hallelujah amen isn't that what he wants
[1:49:16] to do so we don't want to become like
[1:49:18] this you know
[1:49:18] it can it can start so easy just with a
[1:49:20] sideway
[1:49:21] sideways remark about someone
[1:49:24] you know these wolves now this is how a
[1:49:28] lot of
[1:49:28] i think humanity just remembers people
[1:49:31] these wolves they look like they're
[1:49:33] angry they're fussing they're fighting
[1:49:35] what if these wolves were actually
[1:49:36] actually fully domesticated
[1:49:39] and they and actually have the nicest
[1:49:42] nature that'll that a dog could ever
[1:49:43] have
[1:49:45] excuse me like i was saying like we had
[1:49:47] a labrador growing up golden labrador
[1:49:49] and you could body slam him you could
[1:49:51] push him around you could do all kinds
[1:49:52] and he just took it
[1:49:54] he never bit no one he was gentle he was
[1:49:56] kind you know
[1:49:57] but but so what if they actually had
[1:50:00] that kind of nature
[1:50:01] but the only way we remember these
[1:50:03] wolves is like this they're vicious
[1:50:05] they're biting they're angry you know
[1:50:06] and this is how a lot of people remember
[1:50:08] other people they remember like a
[1:50:09] photograph of how they once were
[1:50:12] and they think they're still the same
[1:50:14] isn't that right we don't want
[1:50:16] we don't want to remember people by how
[1:50:18] they maybe were
[1:50:19] what about how they are now and then
[1:50:22] when you meet them you got this image in
[1:50:23] your mind
[1:50:24] they're like this and they don't like me
[1:50:26] and they think this of me
[1:50:28] and they're arrogant and they're maybe a
[1:50:29] bit bit bit short with their words and
[1:50:30] you know
[1:50:31] what if they're different because
[1:50:32] remember haven't we changed
[1:50:35] we're not a static image eh you know our
[1:50:38] i trust we become more like the lord
[1:50:40] we're more like him every day we you
[1:50:42] know the word puts on flesh in a greater
[1:50:44] way and
[1:50:44] you know so we're not a static image why
[1:50:47] would why should we remember other
[1:50:48] people as a static image
[1:50:51] you know and and to me it's you know
[1:50:54] astounding where
[1:50:55] sometimes people have more faith that
[1:50:58] god can speak to someone who's a
[1:50:59] prodigal or a sinner out in the world
[1:51:01] who's not it has no fellowship with god
[1:51:03] people have more faith to pray for those
[1:51:04] kind of people than they do for
[1:51:06] believers
[1:51:07] that's right you know don't you think
[1:51:09] god would have greater ability or it
[1:51:11] would be easier for him
[1:51:12] to talk to someone who's walking with
[1:51:14] him
[1:51:16] right but some you know for some reason
[1:51:18] believers get in their mind
[1:51:20] that it's easier for god to speak to
[1:51:22] someone who has no fellowship with him
[1:51:24] who's far from god and god can deal with
[1:51:26] them easier than god can deal with
[1:51:28] believers
[1:51:31] we shouldn't have that kind of attitude
[1:51:33] you know
[1:51:34] what does it help snarling over
[1:51:36] someone's carcass
[1:51:37] what about slipping away and praying for
[1:51:39] them shouldn't that be the right answer
[1:51:42] have you heard about what this is doing
[1:51:43] what these people are doing i'm really
[1:51:45] not interested you know
[1:51:46] i always well maybe i joke to myself i
[1:51:48] say i'm not part of the grapevine it
[1:51:50] kind of stops about here
[1:51:52] i just never connect you know have you
[1:51:53] heard down the grape i know well it kind
[1:51:55] of doesn't there's a there's a gap
[1:51:57] and i don't want to build that gap i'm
[1:51:59] pretty happy just whatever's going on
[1:52:00] let it go on
[1:52:02] you know we should just just walk with
[1:52:04] the lord
[1:52:06] and if people try and bring up stuff
[1:52:08] while you i think it's a good idea
[1:52:10] saying well
[1:52:10] have you prayed for those people have
[1:52:13] you really left the you know brother
[1:52:14] braham says it
[1:52:16] one no mortal can condemn another mortal
[1:52:20] in the presence of god
[1:52:21] so when you really go into the prince of
[1:52:23] god see many times people become like
[1:52:25] this is because the lack of the spirit
[1:52:26] of god in their lives
[1:52:27] because the spirit of god makes us
[1:52:29] gentle humble meek
[1:52:30] loving makes me love everybody the
[1:52:32] old-time religion
[1:52:34] right but when people leave the spirit
[1:52:35] of god they become like this their first
[1:52:37] nature begins to rise again because
[1:52:39] they're no longer feeding the inner man
[1:52:41] amen so you know that's why it should be
[1:52:44] the question well have you slept away
[1:52:45] and prayed for them because if you're
[1:52:47] only in the prince of god
[1:52:48] how can you condemn someone maybe
[1:52:50] they've just just blatantly just
[1:52:52] murdered your character around the whole
[1:52:53] globe and you know they did and they
[1:52:55] know they did
[1:52:57] but when you get into the prince of god
[1:53:00] and you how can you condemn that person
[1:53:03] when the one who forgave you of all
[1:53:05] things you're now in his presence
[1:53:08] hallelujah see if we just stand the
[1:53:11] prince of god you think lord you're so
[1:53:13] great
[1:53:14] i want to be a lamb i don't want to be a
[1:53:16] wolf i don't want to have my
[1:53:19] indifference or whatever against anyone
[1:53:21] i just want to i want to be loving
[1:53:23] i want to be gentle i just want to turn
[1:53:24] the other cheek i don't want to yo they
[1:53:26] want to steal my
[1:53:27] coat i give them the other one you know
[1:53:29] hallelujah
[1:53:34] it says engrave not the holy spirit of
[1:53:36] god whereby you're sealed
[1:53:38] and to the day of redemption he says
[1:53:40] before this
[1:53:41] let him not steal that stole still no
[1:53:44] more but rather let him labor working
[1:53:46] with his hands the thing which is good
[1:53:48] that he may have to give it to him that
[1:53:50] needeth
[1:53:51] let no corrupt communication proceedeth
[1:53:54] out of your mouth
[1:53:55] you talk negative about someone else
[1:53:57] that's corrupt communication
[1:53:58] that's not just swear words but that
[1:54:01] which is good to the use of edifying
[1:54:04] that it may minister grace into the
[1:54:06] hearers we know grace
[1:54:08] it means a divine influence upon the
[1:54:09] heart and its reflection on the life
[1:54:11] so we want to speak things that are good
[1:54:14] use of edifying
[1:54:16] that it would actually minister the
[1:54:17] divine influence of god upon the
[1:54:19] person's hearts
[1:54:21] amen he says and grieve not the holy
[1:54:23] spirit of god where by your seal to the
[1:54:25] day of your redemption
[1:54:27] let all bitterness and wrath and anger
[1:54:29] and clamor and evil speaking be put away
[1:54:31] from you with all malice now
[1:54:32] i've seen i you know i like to just look
[1:54:35] at definitions of words
[1:54:36] and you know this word bitterness
[1:54:40] it actually means a uh um accelerate um
[1:54:43] acidity
[1:54:44] especially a poison so it talks about
[1:54:46] bitterness so
[1:54:47] talk about gossip put that away
[1:54:50] it's just a poison and wrath and anger
[1:54:54] and clamor
[1:54:55] clamors and outcries like a tumult of
[1:54:57] grief it's just a bunch of noise
[1:54:59] and evil speaking put it away from you
[1:55:01] with all malice
[1:55:03] and be kind one to another tender
[1:55:05] hearted forgiving one another even as
[1:55:07] god
[1:55:07] for christ's sake hath forgiven you
[1:55:11] so he says don't grieve the holy ghost
[1:55:13] so we can grieve him
[1:55:15] but he says but whereby your seal to the
[1:55:17] day of your redemption so
[1:55:18] just to grieve him doesn't mean you need
[1:55:19] to receive the holy ghost again
[1:55:21] but you can grieve and the brother bram
[1:55:22] says because he's like a dove who just
[1:55:24] go up into the rafters
[1:55:26] and you'll be walking on but he's
[1:55:27] waiting for you to get back into the
[1:55:29] right condition again that he can come
[1:55:30] and make his abode again as i said it
[1:55:32] doesn't change your eternal destination
[1:55:34] but it will change the victory you have
[1:55:35] in your christian walk
[1:55:37] hallelujah because remember god gives us
[1:55:39] choices
[1:55:41] amen you know we don't have to pray
[1:55:43] continuously god should i have breakfast
[1:55:45] today or should i have
[1:55:46] lunch or dinner or what should i eat you
[1:55:48] know he he allows you to make those
[1:55:49] choices
[1:55:50] and if you make the choices that you
[1:55:51] just you know live on mcdonald's that's
[1:55:53] your choice
[1:55:54] you know oh i need prayer i'm sick well
[1:55:57] why are you sick well i've been eating
[1:55:58] this well that's why you're sick
[1:56:00] it's not a supernatural thing it's just
[1:56:01] you making the wrong choice
[1:56:03] so you know god makes gives us choices
[1:56:06] but we shouldn't grieve the holy spirit
[1:56:12] he says and that's the only animal that
[1:56:13] a dove could sit on which is a lamb
[1:56:15] what if that lamb would have snorted
[1:56:17] like a wolf the gentle
[1:56:19] little dove would have taken her flight
[1:56:21] and you wonder what's the matter with
[1:56:22] the prayer meetings
[1:56:23] when you got saved you was a lamb but
[1:56:25] when you started snorting like a wolf
[1:56:27] and hating your neighbor and fussing and
[1:56:29] fighting
[1:56:29] the dove just took her flight and went
[1:56:31] away from you and now you wonder what's
[1:56:33] the matter that's what's the matter if a
[1:56:35] dove won't stay on
[1:56:37] if a dove won't stay on a goat it won't
[1:56:39] stay on a wolf
[1:56:40] fussing fighting steering ups and downs
[1:56:42] and arguing and denominational barriers
[1:56:44] the holy spirit just took her flight you
[1:56:46] say brother bram
[1:56:47] how do we get it back just come back to
[1:56:49] a lamb
[1:56:50] she's just sitting up there on the roof
[1:56:52] somewhere she'll come
[1:56:54] back right i shall come right back when
[1:56:57] you take
[1:56:58] the nature of a lamb
[1:57:01] this is what i opened up before what's
[1:57:04] the way back to the old-fashioned
[1:57:05] meetings just become lambs again
[1:57:07] just get back to being sheep the dove
[1:57:09] hasn't gone very far he's just waiting a
[1:57:11] chance
[1:57:12] uh to get back there's the road back to
[1:57:15] azusa street brother
[1:57:16] is preaching i think the 50th year
[1:57:17] anniversary of that there's a place back
[1:57:19] back to the azusa street meetings again
[1:57:21] is to return to a lamb nature again
[1:57:27] now jesus says i'm the true vine
[1:57:30] and my father is a husbandman i won't be
[1:57:32] much longer i don't think
[1:57:34] every branch that is in me beareth not
[1:57:35] fruit he taketh away in every branch
[1:57:37] that beareth fruit he purchased it
[1:57:39] that it may bring forth more fruit he
[1:57:41] says and ye are now clean through the
[1:57:42] wood try spoken unto you
[1:57:44] he says abide in me and i knew as the
[1:57:46] branch cannot bear fruit of itself
[1:57:48] except that abide in the vine
[1:57:49] no more can you except you abide in me i
[1:57:52] the vine the other branches
[1:57:53] he that abideth in me and i in him the
[1:57:55] same bringeth forth much fruit
[1:57:57] for without me ye can do nothing
[1:58:02] and he says herein is my father
[1:58:04] glorified that ye bear much fruit so
[1:58:06] that
[1:58:06] so you shall be my disciples so the
[1:58:09] father hath loved me as i have loved you
[1:58:11] continue in my love if you keep my
[1:58:13] commandments you shall abide in my love
[1:58:15] even as i have kept my father's command
[1:58:18] commandments and abide in his love
[1:58:20] these things have i spoken unto you that
[1:58:22] my joy
[1:58:23] might remain in you and that your joy
[1:58:25] might be full
[1:58:26] what's he just said you're the branches
[1:58:28] and i'm the vine and i'm gonna give you
[1:58:30] my life i'm gonna pulsate my life
[1:58:31] through and bear fruit
[1:58:32] amen that's why that's why your joy
[1:58:35] that's why our joy will be full
[1:58:37] amen now and now how will he be known
[1:58:42] how will we know him by his nature what
[1:58:45] he does his works
[1:58:47] he said i so he's not known by argument
[1:58:49] he's known by his nature by his works
[1:58:51] and he said i am the vine yeah the
[1:58:53] branches now the branch bears the fruit
[1:58:55] not the vine
[1:58:56] the vine energizes the branch and if the
[1:58:58] branch ever brings forth or the vine
[1:59:01] brings forth a branch it has grapes on
[1:59:03] it the next vine comes out or a branch
[1:59:04] out of that vine will have grapes on it
[1:59:06] if the first church that came off of
[1:59:08] that vine was a pentecostal church
[1:59:10] with all the gifts if that ever puts
[1:59:13] forth on another branch
[1:59:14] they'll write another book of acts
[1:59:16] behind it and that's what they had in
[1:59:18] the days of the apostles
[1:59:19] and the apostolic age has never ended
[1:59:22] that's in 1964 after the seals were open
[1:59:25] he says here he says the church has got
[1:59:28] so many orders and things to keep us so
[1:59:30] busy prayer meetings is left out we need
[1:59:32] to draw nigh unto god
[1:59:33] so he'll draw nigh unto us friend that's
[1:59:35] right but everything else has took the
[1:59:37] place of the prayer meeting
[1:59:39] everything else has took the place of
[1:59:41] the real spiritual worship
[1:59:43] oh maybe two or three minutes in church
[1:59:44] but i just love to lay and bathe before
[1:59:47] him
[1:59:47] don't you love that oh just lift up your
[1:59:49] hands and drink from the fountain
[1:59:51] until you can't drink no more but
[1:59:54] bubbling over in his sweetness and his
[1:59:56] and in his goodness hallelujah he just
[1:59:59] get
[1:59:59] so full of his goodness he says now i
[2:00:02] was talking so i don't really think this
[2:00:04] very well
[2:00:04] i was talking to a noted evangelist my
[2:00:06] brother t.l osborne
[2:00:08] um he said i was thinking brother braham
[2:00:11] of how
[2:00:12] that my whole objective is to save souls
[2:00:14] and to give all my time to save souls to
[2:00:16] christ
[2:00:17] i said then i happen to think what about
[2:00:20] my own love and devotion to christ
[2:00:21] christ loves him too he loves us
[2:00:24] we put a lot of time in things but god
[2:00:26] wants us to come apart and just sit down
[2:00:28] and worship him
[2:00:29] and talk with him and talk it over i
[2:00:31] love that oh that sweetness that's the
[2:00:33] greatest time of anybody's life is just
[2:00:36] sit down
[2:00:37] and meditate take everything off your
[2:00:39] mind if you would do that
[2:00:41] there wouldn't be so much nervousness
[2:00:43] around the country
[2:00:44] if we would just think on god hallelujah
[2:00:48] draw nigh unto me and i'll draw nigh
[2:00:50] unto you you ever got to that place you

[2:05:48] have an enemy or your greatest critic if
[2:05:50] you've got a critic
[2:05:51] or your best friend or your spouse you
[2:05:54] should be able to think about the love

[2:05:57] you shouldn't have any ill feeling you
[2:05:59] just name a name shouldn't be any ill
[2:06:00] feeling

[2:06:03] person it doesn't matter what they've
[2:06:04] done to me
[2:06:05] i love that person oh there should be
[2:06:08] there shouldn't be any ill feeling
[2:06:09] towards anyone

[2:06:13] to turn into snarling wolves

[2:06:19] in such a way that you love everybody
[2:06:22] absolutely amen the love of god is
[2:06:24] about now
[2:06:25] in our hearts by the holy ghost which is
[2:06:27] given unto us you can walk in that love
[2:06:30] you can be drunk on the spirit of god
[2:06:33] every day until you leave this world
[2:06:35] where everything's just good god is good
[2:06:37] all the time
[2:06:38] doesn't matter what's happening god is
[2:06:40] good oh these people hate me but god is
[2:06:42] good
[2:06:43] and because he loved me and his love's
[2:06:45] in my heart how could i not love them
[2:06:47] how can i not want the best for them how
[2:06:49] could i not want them to be in heaven
[2:06:51] with me
[2:06:52] hallelujah
[2:06:54] [Music]
[2:06:56] well i don't feel that way while i say
[2:06:58] friend you need a sharing
[2:07:01] remember real forgiveness is to
[2:07:04] surrender the right to hold that against
[2:07:06] somebody
[2:07:08] if you really forgive them you actually
[2:07:09] surrender the right to hold it against
[2:07:10] them
[2:07:11] that's real forgiveness that's just
[2:07:13] saying i forgive you brother i forgive
[2:07:14] you sister
[2:07:15] praise the lord and in reality you got a
[2:07:17] knife you know
[2:07:19] no no no well that's really what people
[2:07:21] do that's not forgiveness that's just
[2:07:23] putting up a facade
[2:07:24] we don't want to have a facade we don't
[2:07:26] want to have a church or a message face
[2:07:27] or whatever
[2:07:28] we want to be what we are in our hearts
