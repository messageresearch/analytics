[22:18] hallelujah amen if you got your Bibles
[22:21] handy let's go to I mean let's go to the
[22:28] book of Genesis Genesis chapter 28 I
[22:36] read from verse 10 now I've been reading
[22:40] through the through the Bible from the
[22:41] beginning and I mean it's been it's been
[22:44] a blessing Genesis 28 verse 10 this is
[22:54] Jacob after he flees from from Esau his
[22:57] brother after he's got the birthright
[23:01] seized and Jacob went out from Beersheba
[23:04] and went towards Haran and he lighted
[23:07] upon a certain place and tarried there
[23:09] all night because the Sun was set and he
[23:11] took up the stones of that place and put
[23:13] them for his pillows and laid down in
[23:16] that place to sleep and he dreamed and
[23:17] behold a letter was set up on the earth
[23:19] and the top of it reached to heaven and
[23:21] behold the angels of God ascending and
[23:23] descending on it and behold the Lord
[23:26] stood above it and said I am the Lord
[23:28] God of Abraham my father and and the god
[23:31] of Isaac the land were upon their last
[23:33] to thee will I give it and to thy seed
[23:35] and to thy seed shall be as the dust of
[23:39] the earth and thou shall spread abroad
[23:40] to the west and to the east and to the
[23:42] north and to the south and in thee and
[23:44] all thy and in thy seed shall all the
[23:46] families of the earth be blessed and
[23:48] behold I am with thee and will keep thee
[23:51] in all places where thou goest and will
[23:53] bring there get into this land for I
[23:55] will not leave the until I have done
[23:57] that which I have spoken to thee of amen
[24:03] licious bow heads at a word of Prayer
[24:05] gracious father we're so thankful Lord
[24:08] for your supernatural presence Lord we
[24:12] thank you that this Christianity that we
[24:15] so love
[24:16] it's not a natural religion of idols and
[24:18] stone and wood and man's ideas of man's
[24:21] theology but it's a supernatural faith
[24:23] Lord and we so glad it's been Lord that
[24:26] faith that was once delivered to the
[24:27] Saints has been restored to us father
[24:31] what a praise you Lord this night as we
[24:33] gather here Lord I pray father would be
[24:35] like Jacob here on the way to to his
[24:38] father's kindred Lord how heaven opened
[24:41] father and he saw a vision of you in a
[24:43] dream and Lord it became more than just
[24:45] a law it became something very special
[24:48] to him father Lord heaven open to him
[24:51] Lord I pray father that Lord as we have
[24:53] this time together Lord may heaven open
[24:55] father Lord we know we do not wait Lord
[24:58] we walk by faith and not by sight
[25:00] so father may you quicken our faith Lord
[25:02] increase our faith Lord to take you at
[25:05] your word and father may you be at those
[25:07] who couldn't make it tonight Lord be
[25:09] there portion you just want to commit
[25:10] the service into your hands Lord just
[25:12] Lord manifest yourself among us for your
[25:14] glory
[25:15] father we commit the service into your
[25:17] hands and we thank you in Jesus Christ's
[25:18] name Amen amen god bless you friends you
[25:22] may you may have your seats I mean it's
[25:24] great to have the Clifford's back a man
[25:27] praise the Lord trust he had a good time
[25:28] to the West amen so I'd like to if I
[25:35] could entitle this anything I want to
[25:36] talk about heaven opening and our
[25:39] walkers by faith and not by sight now we
[25:43] have Jacob here here he is just you know
[25:47] he's had to flee from everything he knew
[25:49] because in him was the he wanted the
[25:52] birthright you know his name Jacob means
[25:54] supplanter and he was willing to do
[25:57] anything he had to do to get the
[25:58] birthright he could he knew it was more
[26:01] than just a natural blessing I mean he
[26:04] knew it was more than just a natural
[26:05] blessing but there was a supernatural
[26:06] element tied into that birthright and he
[26:10] was willing to even forsake himself you
[26:12] know we won't read it but if you go read
[26:15] the previous chapter you know he dresses
[26:17] up like his brother Esau cuz Esau was
[26:19] the eldest eldest son and the birthright
[26:22] always went to the firstborn so he
[26:24] wasn't even entitled to anything but he
[26:27] knew that you know something enemy said
[26:29] I must get
[26:29] this and so he was willing to deny
[26:31] himself I meant he he knew he wasn't
[26:34] worthy he knew he wasn't even you know
[26:37] entitled to this birthright maybe like
[26:40] we may feel we're not worthy of heaven
[26:42] we're not worthy of being a believer I
[26:44] mean but we don't need to look at
[26:45] ourselves but all we need to do is deny
[26:47] ourselves amen and come amen come to the
[26:51] Lord and say Lord I want the birthright
[26:53] I want the baptism of the Holy Ghost I
[26:56] want God to come down and live in me
[26:58] they mean so so he dressed up like his
[27:00] older brother who by natural birth
[27:03] should have received it and he any and
[27:05] he comes into the presence of us of his
[27:07] brother you know of his father and his
[27:10] father Isaac was a prophet I mean God
[27:13] visited him he knew God so a prophet now
[27:16] a prophet only knows what God tells them
[27:18] just like Elijah with the Shunammite
[27:20] woman the Shunammite woman's son has
[27:22] died you know I think maybe he got
[27:24] sunstroke because he happened to feel
[27:26] this is our my head and he gets taken
[27:28] back laid on the bed and he dies and and
[27:30] so but that but the mother of that Sun
[27:33] the Shunammite woman she said I've got
[27:35] to get to the Prophet because he was the
[27:37] one who said I would have the son now I
[27:39] have the son I meant and then Surnow now
[27:42] Elisha sees the shooter might woman
[27:44] coming and he doesn't know what's going
[27:46] on he says to a servant i don't know God
[27:48] hasn't told me and then and then as soon
[27:50] as you know a woman gets a hold of that
[27:52] property holds on to him I mean I won't
[27:54] let you go
[27:56] hallelujah so so now we must be like
[28:01] Jacob Jacob just like us old of all the
[28:05] brother he he he put on his older
[28:08] brothers clothes you know he dressed
[28:10] like him he denied who he was his his
[28:13] his blood and father who God could have
[28:15] told him at any time this is actually
[28:16] Jacob even he says to him you sound like
[28:19] Jacob but you feel like Esau
[28:21] I assure you Esau he says and Jacobs
[28:23] voice I'm Esau amen so so he denied
[28:27] himself he says no I'm not I'm not the
[28:29] one who's not worthy I'm the worthy one
[28:31] he took on as you could say his older
[28:33] brothers righteousness your take on the
[28:36] Lords righteousness come to him say I am
[28:38] worthy I'm entitled to this Aliyah
[28:43] what he wanted and at anytime God could
[28:44] have said to his father this is Jacob
[28:46] but yet he came anyway he's willing to
[28:49] override his fear cast aside his fear
[28:52] cast aside his own self worth of not
[28:56] even being able to get it he didn't he
[28:59] cast down his own identity took on his
[29:02] brother's identity and got the
[29:03] birthright but Esau was a natural man he
[29:07] wasn't you know he was hungry you know I
[29:09] was thinking it you know when I read
[29:11] this yesterday
[29:12] here's Esau he comes into the camp you
[29:15] know he's so hungry he feels like he's
[29:17] gonna die
[29:17] there wasn't just you know him his
[29:20] brother and his parents in that camp it
[29:22] was a big camp he could have got food
[29:24] somewhere else right buddy but he
[29:27] esteemed it so lightly the birthright he
[29:29] says just give me some food what's the
[29:31] birthright worth me you know and he and
[29:33] he just sold it for a mess of pottage
[29:35] right he esteemed it so lightly we don't
[29:38] want to esteem God dwelling in us
[29:40] lightly I mean the promise of heaven
[29:42] lightly walking in victory lightly we
[29:44] don't want to steep those things lightly
[29:46] I mean so he sold his birthright and he
[29:49] and he couldn't get it back and then
[29:51] Jacob received the birthright
[29:52] now when Jacob received the birthright
[29:54] heaven opened to him after this he never
[29:57] had this kind of dream before until
[29:59] after he received the birthright heaven
[30:01] came open where it was more than his
[30:03] father story of you know Isaac maybe
[30:05] telling telling him when his father
[30:07] Abraham took him up the hill you know to
[30:09] sacrifice him on the altar or whatever
[30:11] more it became more than his father
[30:13] story became his testimony amen and we
[30:15] know Christianity is this an experience
[30:18] right it's not a knowledge or learning
[30:20] in this experience because the same God
[30:23] that was there in Genesis is the same
[30:25] God today I mean he's the same one we
[30:27] can meet we can they meet him we can
[30:29] meet him and that's the very reason he
[30:31] died she had his blood upon the earth
[30:33] that had reconciled us to him hallelujah
[30:37] so heaven came open to him did he think
[30:39] about this before this dream he was
[30:41] running to his father's you know family
[30:44] they're on the run and all he saw was
[30:47] natural things but then it's very
[30:50] different when you when you say yes I'm
[30:52] a believer but then when God comes down
[30:55] quick
[30:56] that faith vindicates your faith to you
[30:59] that's a very different thing because
[31:02] here comes Jacob he's he's on the run
[31:06] and then God gives him this dream and he
[31:10] says I'll give you this land you'll
[31:12] return to this place again and I will
[31:15] not leave thee until I have done that
[31:17] which I've spoken to the off there's
[31:20] what we just read in verse 15 I will not
[31:22] leave you till I've done this promise
[31:24] hallelujah and and we can we can take
[31:27] that same scripture and God is here
[31:30] present because he will not leave his
[31:32] bride until he has fulfilled everything
[31:35] he has spoken of her I mean so a
[31:38] victorious walk I will not leave thee
[31:40] until I've given you a victorious walk
[31:42] overcoming power that's why you got to
[31:45] look at the life behind the belief and
[31:47] because many people have different kind
[31:48] of belief but it's dead I mean but those
[31:50] where the life lives that's where you
[31:52] want to take notice Jesus didn't speak
[31:55] like any other man he didn't speak like
[31:58] the scribes and the learn at once he
[31:59] spoke in parables and mysteries and
[32:01] different things but God was manifested
[32:03] through that life hallelujah he says all
[32:06] not leaves in I I will not leave until I
[32:10] have done that which I've spoken to the
[32:12] earth
[32:12] I trusted that that means something to
[32:15] you I mean when you see the things you
[32:17] may be facing he didn't know what he was
[32:19] going to find it as it is at his
[32:21] relatives place he didn't know when he'd
[32:24] be you have to return and face Easter
[32:26] again he didn't know what he was going
[32:27] to find but God said I'll not leave me
[32:29] till I will do it what I've spoken to
[32:31] the earth hallelujah and you know this
[32:36] is how I walk should be amen there's
[32:39] brother brand preached a sermon wisdom
[32:41] verses verses faith he talks about the
[32:44] devil's reasoning wisdom verses faith
[32:46] the devil tries to reason yay hath God
[32:49] seed and man tries to reason but God
[32:52] just gives faith he quickens his word
[32:55] remember this is a supernatural gospel
[32:58] we serve a supernatural God and we have
[33:00] a supernatural word and there's a
[33:02] supernatural walk and we're going to a
[33:04] supernatural heaven amen this is what
[33:08] generally the supernatural religion it's
[33:10] not a natural religion I mean this this
[33:12] message is not a natural message it's a
[33:14] supernatural message this is a
[33:16] supernatural book this is a supernatural
[33:19] book and God gives us children faith to
[33:22] manifest the promise in this word
[33:24] hallelujah where where Jacob had to
[33:27] fulfill his portion of the word and now
[33:29] the bride many thousands of years later

[33:35] recognize your hair to manifest the
[33:37] promise word for the day Jesus says for
[33:40] this cause I've come into the world
[33:42] hallelujah he knew who he was
[33:44] that's why when the devil came against

[33:48] written the word says it is written
[33:51] devil comes back it is written the word
[33:53] says it's also written the reason he
[33:55] could stand upon that word is because in
[33:57] you who he was he knew he wasn't just
[33:59] from Nazareth or from Galilee or he knew
[34:01] wasn't Joseph's and Mary's son he was
[34:03] God in flesh he was the Word made
[34:05] manifest he knew he was the son of God
[34:08] that's how he could overcome right and
[34:12] God wants you and yes he's in
[34:14] Corinthians it says that that we would
[34:15] know as we are knowing right that we
[34:18] would know as God knows us amen
[34:23] that you know it's not just us stumbling
[34:25] into something you know but God in His
[34:28] great mercy
[34:29] NUI you would be knew how old you'd be
[34:32] your condition you would be and the mind
[34:35] battles you may have or whatever more he
[34:37] doesn't he wasn't worried about that in
[34:39] you and you'd steered you right as an
[34:41] unseen hand was steering you to a
[34:43] particular point in life because he
[34:45] wanted to get your attention
[34:47] Amen the woman of the world she had to
[34:49] be at the world she had to be in that
[34:51] condition because Jesus had to go by
[34:53] that way hallelujah
[34:55] you're the man in the terms he had to be
[34:57] there the maniac had to be in the terms
[35:00] in that condition hallelujah I'm glad
[35:05] I'm glad that God God for Danes our life
[35:09] he knows where we walk he knows the
[35:11] mountains we go through the valleys
[35:13] whatever it is he knows where we go
[35:16] hallelujah amen
[35:19] he knew that Mary Magdalene would have
[35:22] seven Devils in her it didn't bother him
[35:26] because he knew he had the power to get
[35:28] her out
[35:29] amen and that's why you know the devil
[35:31] he thinks he's the best warden in the
[35:33] world best best jailer Supermax security
[35:36] prison
[35:37] that's nothing to God you want to see
[35:39] the Great Escape we've escaped
[35:41] hallelujah and we're not just running
[35:44] into the trees we're running into heaven
[35:46] hallelujah oh you know we're just not
[35:48] running into the wilderness trying to
[35:49] escape the the you know the hounds of
[35:52] hell and the prison dogs and the gods or
[35:54] whatever more we're going up into glory
[35:56] hallelujah do you know where your
[35:59] destination lies I trust you dress has
[36:03] been anchored in your soul there's a
[36:06] rapture for me this body's going to be

[36:09] doesn't matter what state it may be our
[36:11] may be a tetraplegic in a wheelchair in
[36:13] a moment of twinkling of an eye all get
[36:14] out of that wheelchair hallelujah amen
[36:18] so we have to we have to have such
[36:21] confidence friends this Bible this word
[36:25] that we believe is a supernatural word
[36:28] this is a supernatural faith this is not
[36:32] a natural faith I mean we're now Jacob
[36:37] he had a visitation of heaven and that
[36:41] changed his life because before that he
[36:43] was just worrying about his brother and
[36:45] maybe where he was and I don't know how
[36:47] many days journey it is he's just caught
[36:49] up in natural things natural things but
[36:52] then heaven opened to them and then when
[36:54] heaven opens to someone that's all that
[36:56] matters because it gives me gives your
[36:58] faith where you can walk by that faith
[37:00] you don't walk by sight and what my
[37:03] candle man may say in their
[37:04] understanding I'm not walking like that
[37:06] I'm walking by faith hallelujah because
[37:09] we walk by faith and not by sight Amen
[37:13] I'm so glad we walk that kind of way so
[37:16] now you know I I was y'all be thinking
[37:20] this past week if we could just look
[37:22] past the curtain a time amen it would
[37:26] change our entire lives right where
[37:29] heaven is not way up beyond the Milky
[37:32] Way in some place
[37:33] it's present I mean where where God is
[37:37] here his angels are here the redeemed
[37:40] awaiting I mean they're waiting for us
[37:42] to take our place and take a rapture
[37:44] because without us they're not made
[37:46] perfect not made complete hallelujah if
[37:49] we can just look past the curtain of
[37:50] time I think would blow away a lot of
[37:52] cobwebs hallelujah and that's why God
[37:56] comes and he visits us any any any
[37:59] quickens his word hallelujah makes it
[38:01] alive amen he anoints you hallelujah
[38:05] what is that that's beyond the curtain
[38:07] of time reaching down that's eternity
[38:09] reaching to you trying to get you your
[38:11] Jesus was walking along he said who
[38:13] touched me there's a woman who had a
[38:15] blood a shooter if I could just touch
[38:17] the hem of government who touched me we
[38:19] need to actually flip it around and say
[38:21] who touched me right because once upon a
[38:24] time I was I was in the world I was lost
[38:27] I was undone I had to go to Anglican
[38:30] Church Presbyterian Church different
[38:32] kind of church at boarding school didn't
[38:34] do me any good but one day I heard a
[38:36] voice holy and something gripped me and
[38:39] I should have really said who touched me
[38:41] who's got a hold of my life it wasn't me
[38:44] it wasn't what I wanted to do I didn't
[38:46] want it I wanted my first kid to lose my
[38:49] friends are scared to lose whatever I
[38:51] thought I had but you anyway you know
[38:54] but something touched me what touched me
[38:57] and you've got to go back to those kind
[38:59] of moments and think who touched me who
[39:01] touched me when I heard that voice who
[39:04] touched me when the wood became open
[39:06] what touch you
[39:07] it wasn't man wasn't just your this is
[39:10] culture or something that seems a little
[39:12] bit better nicer kind of religion knows
[39:14] Almighty God I mean he is still the High
[39:18] Priestess touched by the feeling of our
[39:20] infirmities and sometimes we don't even
[39:22] know what we need
[39:24] hallelujah something touched me and made
[39:28] me whole
[39:30] amen you know the real vindication of
[39:32] the Resurrection the upper room the book
[39:36] of Acts church God came they didn't walk
[39:39] out of the book of yo you know then walk
[39:41] out of the upper room with an argument a
[39:43] polis had an argument he proved from the
[39:46] scripture that Jesus
[39:47] was the Christ there's an ex 1819 but
[39:49] then it took the Apostle Paul to
[39:51] comments and bring him in to present
[39:52] truth you know he was a devout Jew he
[39:55] was a believer but he only had this much
[39:57] he only had a natural understanding then
[39:59] the Apostle Paul's comes to him have you
[40:01] received the Holy Ghost since you
[40:02] believed
[40:03] we haven't heard about this Connor what
[40:05] are you talking about a Holy Spirit
[40:07] coming and dwelling in a people
[40:08] manifesting his word I mean through we
[40:12] haven't we haven't heard of this well
[40:13] how he baptized under John's baptism
[40:15] that was goodness day but God's moved on
[40:18] and they'll rebaptised enable Lord Jesus
[40:20] Christ they laid hands upon them and God
[40:22] filled them
[40:23] hallelujah those a vindication that's
[40:26] there was the vindication that Jesus was
[40:28] the Christ because the same life there
[40:30] was in him was down them I mean what's
[40:37] the vindication this is actually not
[40:38] man's writing as they close the author
[40:40] that wrote this book comes and lives in
[40:42] you hallelujah that's the vindication
[40:44] you want to see the proof people want to
[40:47] look at science it's all very well no
[40:49] this becomes flesh that's the real proof
[40:52] you want proof Christianity is real this
[40:54] manifest hallelujah contrary to people's
[40:57] cattle ancient country to their
[40:59] understanding contrary to what they were
[41:01] God comes and lives in me amen oh yeah
[41:06] isn't that right
[41:08] isn't that right there's a supernatural
[41:10] gospel it's not a natural gospel Paul
[41:13] said I do not come to you with man's
[41:15] wisdom right man's wisdom and
[41:18] understanding he was a Pharisee of the
[41:20] Pharisees he could have put it all
[41:22] together just real nice pieces I don't
[41:23] come to you like that
[41:24] I come to you empower and demonstration
[41:27] of the Holy Ghost because the gospel is
[41:29] not word early but power partly a powder
[41:32] overcome the devil powder cast them out
[41:35] I meant powder overcome this flesh holy
[41:38] a powder overcome that's in nature
[41:40] you're born with a man to heal the sick
[41:43] raise the dead word or maybe that is the
[41:45] gospel we have hallelujah and we've got
[41:49] to lean upon that right we've got to
[41:51] depend upon him hallelujah do you think
[41:55] his his Jacob he said it was a fearful
[41:58] place to be but now is
[42:01] Almighty Jehovah's with me it would have
[42:05] changed them it would change you well
[42:09] nuts change you the God that my father
[42:13] spoke about now my god
[42:14] I don't worship by association now I can
[42:17] really worship now I can really praise
[42:19] him cuz he's come down and said I'll do
[42:21] this for you I'll manifest my word
[42:23] through you you're the one who's going
[42:25] to fulfill the prophecy you're gonna be
[42:26] part of my me coming down into flesh
[42:29] hallelujah and now he comes and looks at
[42:32] you you know this bride is a
[42:33] supernatural bride hallelujah have you
[42:36] looked at yourself I mean you gotta say
[42:38] I'm a supernatural believer I mean I'm
[42:41] not a natural de kado believer i'm a
[42:43] supernatural believer cuz it was a
[42:45] supernatural God that got a hold of me
[42:47] hallelujah Amen and he's not a one-time
[42:52] experience kind of God constant
[42:55] fellowship I've been rejoicing to myself
[42:58] about their constant fellowship
[43:00] we're not like the high priest if I
[43:02] repeat myself to say he's getting old
[43:03] constant fellowship I'm in the high
[43:06] priest win and once a year with the
[43:08] blood and fair and tribulation if I
[43:11] don't do this just right over and
[43:12] sprinkle this on here just right if I
[43:14] don't walk just right I'm gonna die and
[43:18] we don't come in haphazardly saying
[43:20] what's up pop of God and you know we
[43:23] come in with reverence do we walk with
[43:25] reverence we should walk with reverence
[43:27] hallelujah but now it's not just once a
[43:30] year and then go out and wasn't that
[43:32] wonderful that's always don't go out of
[43:35] the curtain children don't go out he
[43:37] doesn't want you to go out and to thee
[43:39] and to the and to the inner Court of the
[43:41] outer court around to the world he wants
[43:42] you to dwell continually in his presence
[43:46] hallelujah that's what he wants that's
[43:48] why he died hallelujah amen Allu you
[43:54] Jacob
[43:56] but Jacob had to come to a place jacob
[44:00] had to be changed in a visitation but he
[44:04] had his nature had to be changed right
[44:06] and that's what has to happen many times
[44:08] like we never camp experience and then
[44:10] we leave that camp experience but you
[44:12] got to state it till you changed
[44:14] right so more than just being anointed
[44:16] one time but they said it just being an
[44:17] auntie comes and dwells in you right so
[44:20] here's Jacob and he gets his wives and
[44:22] he you know gets all you know you know
[44:24] he goes to us you know his um family's
[44:27] house father's house gets married you
[44:30] know this does everyone know Sunday
[44:32] school does everyone know your Bible you
[44:34] know the story but then he comes back he
[44:38] comes back to his inheritance but he's
[44:40] still Jacob he's still a supplanter he's
[44:43] got to be changed if he wants to dwell
[44:45] in his inheritance he can't be a
[44:47] supplanter because we're not here to
[44:48] supplant we're here to rule right we're
[44:51] not a squatter right we're not here just
[44:53] to squat you know just to other so I'm
[44:55] gonna try and get this and cheat some
[44:56] out of it no this is mine right but in
[45:00] order for that to be our nature has to
[45:01] be changed right so he had to come to a
[45:04] point where he had to let go of
[45:06] everything you think his brother's
[45:08] across the river with I can't forgive me
[45:11] if I'm not sure it was 200 or 400 men
[45:14] off the top of my head they're armed
[45:15] he's got an army the last time he saw
[45:18] this brother II his brother wanted to
[45:20] kill him when his father died he chief
[45:23] me he cheated her he cheated his brother
[45:26] and now he's coming back hasn't seen him
[45:28] for I don't know how many 14 years or
[45:30] however long it was seven years for one
[45:32] wife seven years for the other and then
[45:35] he doesn't know what's going to happen
[45:36] God gets you in a spot god knows how to
[45:40] get you to it's you and you have nothing
[45:42] to hide behind and you've got a because
[45:44] they send his wife yo-yo he tried to
[45:46] bribe his brother I'll see in livestock
[45:48] and yeah I know who that'll work because
[45:51] he's got a big army he's probably got a
[45:52] lot of livestock I said my family's I
[45:54] said my wives and children before me you
[45:58] know to uh maybe maybe he'll feel sorry
[46:01] for me we seized his own family but they
[46:04] no but then he was going to cross the
[46:06] river himself and God meet him and he
[46:10] wrestled with God
[46:11] I won't leave let you go till you bless
[46:14] me this was Jacob he needed he knew he
[46:17] needed something to dwell in the land
[46:19] right he needed a change and so he
[46:22] wrestles with God all night I'll not let
[46:25] you go till you bless me
[46:26] and then so now God touches his leg
[46:28] changes how he walks Holly it changed
[46:32] his walk upon the earth
[46:33] I don't know how uh supplanter walks I'm
[46:35] not gonna try but then after after God
[46:38] touched his leg changed his name you
[46:39] know more you're no longer Jacob I'm not
[46:42] gonna call you church anymore I'll call
[46:44] you bride hallelujah what could he touch
[46:47] anymore brother brass is the first he'll
[46:49] show you understand
[46:50] you no longer church I'm going to call
[46:52] you bride hallelujah and so he changes
[46:55] the name from Jacob to Israel prince
[46:57] with God hallelujah royalty I'm in a son
[47:01] in the kingdom hallelujah amen and
[47:05] that's and that's why you know it's so
[47:06] amazing when Elijah is on Mount Carmel
[47:08] he praise you're the God of Abraham
[47:10] Isaac and Israel didn't say Abraham
[47:14] Isaac and Jacob Abraham Isaac and Israel
[47:16] hallelujah the Prince hallelujah amen
[47:21] and so that's what he does with that
[47:23] that's what he has to do with you I
[47:24] trust he's done that Amen that he's
[47:27] changed you change your walk change how
[47:30] you walk upon they're not I'm not
[47:32] talking about a natural you can have the
[47:33] same stride or the same limp or whatever
[47:35] you have I don't know same spring not
[47:38] talking about that but it's your your
[47:40] Christian walk upon the earth he has to
[47:43] change that he's got to change your
[47:46] identity right because when you think of
[47:48] a name you think of a life you think of
[47:51] Moses what do you think about ten
[47:52] commandments Mount Sinai plagues in
[47:54] Egypt all those things think of Jesus
[47:57] you think of our Lord hanging on Calvary
[47:59] the Apostle Paul you think of missionary
[48:01] journeys you know because the life is
[48:03] identified in the name so that's why I
[48:07] had to change his name from Jacob to
[48:10] Israel right to change his life like
[48:14] Abraham to Abraham Sarah - Sarah right
[48:19] had to change their names because God so
[48:21] I'm gonna change you you're gonna live a
[48:22] new kind of life Alleluia and so he has
[48:27] to do the same thing with us and then
[48:29] finally he comes across the river
[48:31] everything's been stripped of him he
[48:33] actually has to let it go wrestles with
[48:35] God
[48:35] he's now changed then meets his brother
[48:38] as a changed man here comes the prince
[48:40] this place Allu you I mean where the
[48:44] natural carnal church has no dominion
[48:46] over him anymore he still has fellowship
[48:47] with them he saw was the carnal natural
[48:50] man Jacob or now his role as a spiritual
[48:52] man but now he has dominion he's a
[48:54] prince with God
[48:55] and his whole life was different that's
[48:58] what has to happen that angel remember
[49:01] this Jesus Christ is not a collection of
[49:04] ideas the truth is not just a collection
[49:07] of ideas the truth is a person the
[49:11] person is Jesus Christ he is I am the
[49:14] way the truth and the life he's a person
[49:17] right we have to meet him I mean that's
[49:20] why we have church that we can meet him
[49:22] I mean that's why we have a Wednesday
[49:25] because we've come through a few days we
[49:27] need a judge hallelujah and it's so
[49:30] wonderful because because a believer is
[49:33] like a genuine a genuine electric socket
[49:36] a genuine why that electricity can go
[49:40] through and we're plugged into the sauce
[49:42] amen
[49:43] we're where God says Jesus Christ the
[49:45] same yesterday today and forever amen
[49:48] I'm your father amen
[49:51] hallelujah I'm your Redeemer amen amen
[49:55] amen
[49:57] he sees his word when he when he shows
[50:00] us would you say Amen
[50:01] I'll take care of you Amen all right
[50:05] something and you should say Amen
[50:07] something not this thing oh you know
[50:09] down here yes I'm your Redeemer yes I'm
[50:12] your comforter yes I'm your guy yes I'm
[50:15] your counselor yes if any counseling
[50:18] sometimes he'll give the counsel
[50:20] hallelujah he'll guide your steps don't
[50:23] look at what you see look to him the
[50:25] devil will try and distract you he says
[50:27] look at this look at this look at this
[50:29] yeah just like a huzi or yo-yo Elijah's
[50:33] um servant comes out the morning the
[50:37] Syrians are around the city he panics
[50:39] he's looking at natural things so this
[50:41] has men with weapons natural men with
[50:44] natural weapons and he's with a
[50:46] supernatural prophet that knows a
[50:48] supernatural God that that that has done
[50:52] the same anointing that was on
[50:54] you think about Elijah comes to the King
[50:57] King Ahab king ahab because there's the
[51:00] gerardis got a trouble around the land
[51:01] try and find pasture for his for his
[51:04] animals and then Elijah meets them then
[51:07] then I have seriously you know wonder

[51:30] shouldn't be afraid we shouldn't be
[51:32] afraid of the devil's challenge don't be
[51:34] afraid of Devil's bush doesn't matter

[52:06] anyway so you know they worship and they
[52:09] and they built the altar and they
[52:10] dancing around 450 of them or 400 and
[52:13] they're and they're worshiping and and
[52:16] Elijah is not intimidated he just makes
[52:18] fun he will all maybe it'll work no he
[52:21] knows he's the god of fire I mean he's
[52:24] the he knows who it is and he says cry
[52:26] little louder maybe he's sleeping maybe
[52:28] pursuing maybe he's doing something and
[52:31] they cut themselves they get all trying
[52:33] and try and get the flesh excited cut
[52:35] themselves and dance and it does no good
[52:37] then he rebuilds the altar of the Lord
[52:40] that had fallen down so the scripture
[52:41] says he revolts the altar
[52:42] you'd have to ride altar I don't care
[52:45] about having some marble Catholic also I
[52:47] want a real altar I mean that's built
[52:50] with rocks of Revelation and he puts the
[52:52] revelation in right places the baptism
[52:54] this is the Godhead this is the way this
[52:56] had to be sanctified this overcoming
[52:58] life this is there's more faith as
[53:00] you're older this is where we're he
[53:01] rebuilds the altar
[53:02] puts down the wood takes to sacrifice
[53:06] amen you gotta become a sacrifice and
[53:09] then and then even to show that my God
[53:11] is supernatural because we've had a
[53:13] drought remember this you know they
[53:14] better drop pour water on I don't know
[53:16] where they got the water for him but
[53:17] they poured a lot of water on and it
[53:19] filled the trench roundabout and then he
[53:21] prays Lord God of Israel Abraham and
[53:25] Isaac I've done all this according to
[53:28] thy word and if the people would know
[53:30] that your God in Israel and thou has
[53:32] turned their hearts back again the fire
[53:34] fell and he wasn't surprised because he
[53:38] did it according to he saw a vision and
[53:41] the vision lived out hallelujah he
[53:45] wasn't surprised it happened
[53:46] the God who answered by fire was the
[53:49] real God and it's the same one today we
[53:52] it's not just a it is a supernatural
[53:54] fire it's the Holy Ghost and fire right
[53:57] and the God and he has answered by that
[53:59] fire right he has answered by that fire
[54:02] I mean I trust you when you read acts 2
[54:04] you can say I'm one of them that same
[54:07] God came and dwelt in me and he still
[54:09] abides in me hallelujah is not someone
[54:12] else's story I mean not just a one time
[54:14] thing all the time
[54:16] God is in me all the time hallelujah
[54:20] he's answered by fire do we know that
[54:22] that testimony I show you can say I've
[54:24] seen that God he's changed my nature
[54:26] he's birthed me into the kingdom I've
[54:28] been born again not just reformed burst
[54:31] hallelujah see a baby is a baby in a
[54:34] tummy back there it's living in that
[54:36] kind of life but that'll be birthed and
[54:38] it'll grow a whole different kind of
[54:40] life hallelujah it'll do things that
[54:42] knew nothing about in the womb that's
[54:44] like carnal man they know nothing of
[54:46] spiritual things hey you know and then
[54:48] God comes and birthed you you know it's
[54:52] the fun that you couldn't yo you can
[54:54] share testimony but if you could only
[54:56] convey the reality you say and you can
[55:00] bang the reality oh that's supernatural
[55:02] oh yeah that presence that comes down
[55:05] we've had we've had experience we had
[55:07] we've had meetings but we were yeah
[55:10] God come down and you could literally
[55:12] point with your eye he comes down and
[55:15] then he speaks and it happens how lujah
[55:19] that same God is still here I mean they
[55:22] same God sees through this and this and
[55:23] this and happens exactly that way and
[55:25] when people come in contact with that
[55:27] God it changes them he changes them I
[55:31] mean that's what we need not just to do
[55:33] better
[55:34] no be transformed Amen be birthed into
[55:37] the kingdom and you'll find a life
[55:39] that's in you living a very different
[55:41] just like you know my you know most most
[55:46] women have cravings and they want to
[55:48] protect the life that's growing right
[55:50] and and what they may be their food
[55:54] changes things they once loved they
[55:55] can't have and things they couldn't
[55:56] stand now it's all they want because
[55:59] there's a life from them dictating to
[56:00] them this is what I need right and it's
[56:03] the same thing when God comes in and
[56:05] then you begin to realize you begin to
[56:07] walk a bit different yeah I'm gonna look
[56:09] after this life I want this life to grow
[56:12] I don't want it to be stunted I don't
[56:15] want to stagnate I want it to grow fully
[56:18] growing I want to take in vitamins
[56:21] hallelujah not just not just deadly and
[56:23] if I want it to be anointed I want the
[56:26] whole buffet and the seven course seven
[56:27] sealed menu because I want a life to
[56:30] grow
[56:31] olia that's why you know we are the
[56:34] bride is actually sending the world is
[56:38] descending it's falling this world is
[56:40] falling apart that's why that's why we
[56:42] get now you know you first meet the Lord
[56:46] you start growing and then the reason
[56:49] you get more horrified at how bad the
[56:50] Woolsey is because you're going like
[56:52] this is you this is the world the
[56:53] world's going down and it's a bigger
[56:54] Gulf and you get more shocked hallelujah
[56:58] because of the life and you changing how
[57:00] you were amen yeah I'm so glad we can be
[57:05] love prisoners to Jesus Christ right we
[57:08] can be real genuine prisoners where even
[57:11] if we want to do saying something and
[57:13] you says no don't go there
[57:15] I remember being at university there was
[57:18] a
[57:19] there was so I needed to get some money
[57:20] out for a youth camp there are two ATMs
[57:22] on campus one was one was broken
[57:25] the other one was round by the pub I
[57:27] used to frequent way too often I meet
[57:30] the Lord I go to the one that's broken
[57:32] well I don't know what's broken to us on
[57:34] the other side of campus I'll use this
[57:35] one and then it wasn't working so I'll
[57:38] go to the other one I start walking to
[57:40] the other one right by the front door of
[57:41] the pub now I've been delivered of
[57:43] alcohol so I wasn't scared I wasn't
[57:45] saying help me Lord help me help me help
[57:48] me
[57:48] no if he takes the desire it's gone and
[57:51] you can't try and you know there's
[57:53] nothing in you wants it so how can you
[57:55] it's gone that's victory that's
[57:57] deliverance it's not a seven-step Steven
[58:00] 7 step program to overcome its God
[58:03] hallelujah
[58:05] and then so I start walking around there
[58:06] - whether we're the pub wasn't it and
[58:08] the and the other ATM and the voice said
[58:11] God said I do not want to go there he
[58:15] doesn't say you don't want to go they
[58:16] sees I don't want to go there yes Lord
[58:18] I'm not gonna take you there
[58:20] Olu yeah amen and he's the same God
[58:24] today we serve a personal God we serve a
[58:29] personal Living God and it's not just
[58:32] for me it's for everyone right we are
[58:34] all the same in Christ hallelujah amen
[58:39] amen
[58:42] now we have to the Bible says you know
[58:48] we have so many exceeding precious
[58:50] promises and I did say we get the devil
[58:54] tries to distract us if we take our eyes
[58:58] off the Lord and put it on carnal things
[59:01] or natural things if we put our eyes on
[59:04] those things we take our eyes off him
[59:05] and that's what the devil wants you to
[59:08] do he wants you to be distracted what
[59:10] about this and this and this look at
[59:12] this it can just be situations in life
[59:14] my help cometh from the Lord my help
[59:17] doesn't come from me right my help my
[59:21] help doesn't come from me
[59:23] this guy got himself in a lot of trouble
[59:25] and if he has his way he'll continue to
[59:29] get himself in trouble because it you
[59:31] know
[59:32] made on a sheep farm man sheep
[59:40] we are sheep hallelujah
[59:45] we are sheep and if we just decide well
[59:48] I'm gonna be a lone sheep you'll find
[59:50] yourself in someplace and you won't know
[59:52] the way back but the Lord says my sheep
[59:56] know my voice I know my sheep by name my
[1:00:01] sheep know my voice and a stranger they
[1:00:03] will not follow right and so it goes
[1:00:08] beyond so when the devil comes along
[1:00:10] with us reasoning yes a no that is not
[1:00:13] the voice of my shepherd amen
[1:00:16] do you know you know if you know
[1:00:18] someone's voice really well you know
[1:00:20] their heart behind that voice right you
[1:00:24] know their intent behind their voice and
[1:00:26] it's like the Lord he says my sheep know
[1:00:28] my voice I'm gonna close with this
[1:00:29] thought he knows my sheep know my voice
[1:00:32] is stranger they will not follow right
[1:00:35] and so they intimately know that voice
[1:00:37] and they will not follow a stranger I'm
[1:00:40] just rewording basically what does he
[1:00:41] bow wants you to you have to have
[1:00:43] confidence do you know the voice of the
[1:00:44] shepherd as the ship had come and got
[1:00:48] you as I said a while ago what touched
[1:00:50] me what touched you that was the voice
[1:00:53] of the Shepherd I mean more than just
[1:00:55] audible Jesus Jesus preached the
[1:00:58] multitudes how many of them did a grip
[1:01:01] Amen hit 5,000 then he preaches John
[1:01:04] Sexy's ended up with just the apostles
[1:01:06] and one Judas he says it's just a twelve
[1:01:09] of you one of you is a devil but Peter
[1:01:12] said to whom shall we go you have the
[1:01:13] words of eternal life it gripped them
[1:01:16] they all heard the same words but
[1:01:19] because it is one of the Sheep something
[1:01:22] in them said this is my shepherd I know
[1:01:25] his voice I'm not a smart man oh it's
[1:01:28] just a fisherman that doesn't matter I
[1:01:30] know the voice of my shepherd he says to
[1:01:32] whom shall we go thou have the words of
[1:01:34] eternal life in Jesus and say well done
[1:01:37] you pass the test he said don't you know
[1:01:40] I've chosen you one of you is a devil he
[1:01:42] didn't say which one it was at that time
[1:01:43] but they were grouped
[1:01:45] where are we gonna go we have nowhere
[1:01:47] else to go I'm following this one
[1:01:49] because he's the great Shepherd
[1:01:51] hallelujah and it has to be the same
[1:01:54] thing if God did that in the beginning
[1:01:56] of the Jin told the sensation he came
[1:02:00] down and called the Sheep he will do
[1:02:02] that at the end and I contend he has
[1:02:04] done that supernatural voices spoken in
[1:02:07] this day hallelujah amen have you heard
[1:02:12] the Shepherd's voice have you heard this
[1:02:16] vindicated manifested amen
[1:02:19] let's have the musicians please we have
[1:02:22] a supernatural God amen where they keep
[1:02:26] our eyes on him hey man
[1:02:29] he'll lead us through amen amen amen
