the wonderful name of our Lord Jesus Christ bless and for some reason I'm I'm very very nervous I don't know I thought I won't be nervous but you never really get used to Stand Here amen um if you take things seriously you never get used to stand before the people of God Amen so just to get things going and uh I want to thank the musicians and brother Marion thank you so much thanks for the wonderful gifts that the Lord has given you to to ease us into the presence of the Lord amen how many appreciation the musicians amen and then also thanks more for that song I thought mama was going to sing with you but I'm sure she didn't have time so I appreciate my wife because she brought me the clothes I came straight from work and then I asked her to bring them so when I put them on I felt so good because you know when you do things and then someone does one day do something for you you feel good yeah and then if if you ask please do this for me and it gets done that way you feel so good if you really appreciate amen so thank you H and thanks to all of you for being here tonight and uh we are going to speak on a small subject not small but just a short seron and uh I've tried to minimize it as much as I could I didn't finish the whole seron myself but we'll just take a little journey as we as we read in the Book of Luke chapter 7 um um I pray you under expectation tonight not because brother Paul but because you are prayed up and you've asked the Lord Lord come and speak to me even if it's just one word and then I'll try to to not to be dramatic so that you can understand me so that you can follow what the Lord is trying to say amen and uh uh Luke chapter 7 amen then we'll read from verse 36 then then we will sit down and continue with other verses amen um Luke 7 verse 36 it's a little bit of a long passage but please just bear with me because I need to paint a certain picture for you you all know the scripture and then it it reads that and one day I mean sorry and one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him he desired him right and he went into the Pharisees house and he sat down to meet and behold a woman in the city which was a sinner which she knew that Jesus set at meat in the phes house brought an alabaster box of ointment and stood At His Feet behind him weeping and began to wash his feet with tears and did wipe them with the hairs of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment and now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it ah he saw it he spake within himself saying this man if he were a prophet would have known who and what manner of woman this is that touches his feet that toucheth him for she is a sinner can you see already you're already seeing two personalities the one of this woman and the one that is emerging of this man who desired Jesus to come but he's already doubting that he's a prophet or not so you're starting to have question marks there put on your spiritual jackets like brother marus said am where was I verse let's go to 40 and Jesus answering said unto him I I don't know if Jesus had him with this ears this ears because the Bible says he said in himself but Jesus answering him after this man spoke inside his heart another personality you are seeing you are seeing another person again let's hear what what he said when he's answering him for what he said inside his heart said unto him Simon I have somewhat to say unto thee and he said Master say on what a contradiction you just said in your heart this man if he be a prophet he'll know this woman but no no no no master master master say on who Master amen there was a certain creditor which had two DTS and one owed 500 p p and the other 50 and when they had nothing to pay he frankly forgave them both tell me therefore which of them will love will love him most I think let's pause here pray and then sit down then then we'll start our drama amen our lord Jesus God most high we thank you tonight for your loving kindness for your mercy for your grace for your your salvation for your Redemption for your healing for your love we thank you for your thoughts about us tonight and Heavenly Father we cannot Lord think enough of what you have done at the cross of Calvary and father you died for my sins to be forgiven for me to be called a Christian and you suffered alone and you died because Lord you loved us so much that you could not leave us to go to hell father we come with thankful Hearts tonight and we come in your presence here realizing that we are unworthy we are sinners saved by your grace and I ask father God that you forgive us our iniquity forgive our errors and our mistakes we want to be honest and open with you father God that tonight we are not capable but father we only come in and enter through your grace I pray for every brother every uplifted hand every heart that you that is here father God that you'll bless them Lord that you provide for them according to the desires of their hearts Lord that you speak to them Lord according to their needs father for you we hear from the Bible that you hear people speaking in their hearts and you answer them openly my father my God how blessed are we to serve a God Like You father may you bless every brother here and every sister every visitor everyone who is listening by way of YouTube father I pray that you be with each one Lord if there's one thing that we desire tonight is that your spirit can come and Minister even if it's one word father is enough for us because that word can create 10,000 worlds father and we are so thankful to serve a god like you remove me from this from the podium Lord come and dwell and take these lips this filthy body that was born in sin and shaped in iniquity Lord and anointed and use it father God for the benefit of your bride father we commit the service into your hands tonight we want to be humble father so that you can be exalted father take preeminence now as we ask these things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ Our Lord and Savior amen we may SE and uh I'll finish off that verse um then then I'll I'll tell you what you are talking about I don't have a presentation tonight please forgive me because the enemy was so much on my case I my beautiful memory stick that I love very much on my way from town I put it in my jacket and the enemy lost it I I couldn't find it I'm sure it was when I took out my Snapper Sister Louise and then then I couldn't find it so and and the devil knows that it has got such wonderful goodies and go nuggets in there he knows because he's so jealous so he lost it but I know that my God is a restorer amen he can go get it there at the bus stop if it fell there and put it back in my closet he's able to do that amen he's capable amen do you believe that he's able to find something that you lost somewhere there and bring it to your room so that is how able that's the God we are talking about tonight let me finish this verse then I'll tell you what we are discussing or what we are talking about I want you to relax and don't fasten your seat belts all right um brother AR where was I I was going to I passed 40 already I was going now to 43 43 Simon answered and said I suppose he after saying Master say it on say on he asked me about the datas and the creditors he then someon is answering he's got Gods he's got the or deity to answer boldly Sinners are very bold and they're very proud of what they do they don't they don't they don't they don't they go straight on confidently sincerely wrong but they are making sure as brother Bram says if you are a bum be a good one be an excellent if you are a Believer make sure that you are a you you are a dedicated believer yeah right Simon answered and said I suppose that he to whom he forgave most and he said unto him thou has rightly judged and he turned to the woman and said unto said unto Simon seest thou this woman I entered into this house thou gave gavest me no water for my feet but she had washed my feet with tears and wiped them with te with the hairs of her head thou gavest me no keys but this woman see since the time I came in with in have not ceased to kiss my feet my head with oil thou didn't not anoint but this woman had anointed my feet with ointment wherefore I say unto her unto thee her sins which are many are forgiven for she loved much but to whom little is given the same loveth little did I read it correctly and he said unto her thy sins are forgiven now and they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves again within themselves who is this that forgiveth sins also and he said to the woman Al alier means again thy faith had saved thee go in peace amen so we we see a story here I want to to dramatize it a little bit and then we go home but we see a story or we see this record of this woman and this Simon the Pharisee and the Lord Jesus and we want to talk I want to talk to you about the UN the unwelcomed Jesus Christ the unwelcomed Jesus I know that you welcome him and tonight maybe if I can say something that uh you you are not so comfortable about just know that I love you I don't mean to to be rude or I don't mean to be hard on you and uh just just just forgive me and but don't throw away just take it then go home and play and Rewind and listen to it and maybe by the grace of God you can see what I was trying to show you don't don't throw it away if I'm reading from the word of the Lord okay so H because why why am I saying this you are not the ones that are not welcoming him but hey we have to be cauti from time to time be reminded we have to be made aware that there are these Spirits let's read Timothy second Timothy 3: 6 May God help us is it possible to put it there my dear sister tell thank you so much there it is 2 Timothy 3:6 sorry I I meant to say 16 forgive me 16 thank you all scripture is given by inspiration of God I just want us to agree and put this these three scriptures aside and just agree as the basis all scripture is given by is given by inspiration of God and is profitable meaning beneficial for Doctrine for reprove for correction for instruction in righteousness so I don't think that list is finished is for comforting is for encouraging you is for healing you is for saving you is for everything for you don't you sing a song He's everything to me he's everything to me so the word of God is meant for all those things to you can we set that that one aside let's read Revelation 3 verse 19 rev 3:19 when I say rev I think of my sister because her name is revelation so is the Revelation Revelation 3 verse 19 sorry my girl I'm depending on you tonight I'm not going to page a lot as many as I love huh you see this is the problem brother Ben many many and I'm sorry parents I'm I'm sorry but not really sorry I'm not apologetic in saying this many of you many of us just remember everything that I say here believe you or me believe you or not it comes here to me first the Lord speaks to me first every word that I utter to you the Lord talks back to me first I must be repenting on that right I must be I don't want to say also I'm the first one to benefit of course because the lord gave me a thought to come speak but the the key is don't think that ah he's preaching to us but what about him no it's for me too I'm number one cuz I'm standing here I'm number one right now many I wanted to say you see you see parents I've always wondered why brother Bram says uh we have a problem of children delinquency he says we've got a problem of children delinquency but I've realized that it's not much about children delinquency is the problem of Parental delinquency pause just walk with me you see many of us we miss the word correction we place it a Miss correction is not supposed to be on the two extremes it's not supposed to be too soft too spoiling oh Jimmy my boy sorry BR Jimmy oh little Jimmy Jimmy huh and you are correcting Jimmy to move away from the rail of the oncoming train Jimmy the train is going to knock you my big boy get off the rail now now okay and then you continue doing that huh is that love or so angry kick Jimmy from here to Across The Rail and even break his leg and say you don't listen you and you are angry is that love the word correction is supposed to be underpinned by this word called love yeah true genuine love you see when the Lord says he whom I love as many as I love what do I do or you don't want to say it only brother I rebuke you love me but you rebuke me yes but I have to make sure me the rebuker I've got love otherwise I must zip and zip and zip in my mind because I'm not going to properly correct my son if I'm not bringing that love inside this correction whether I'm doing it on this extreme or on this extreme so why why I'm saying many of us parents we miss it that is why we produce young children or adults who are not serious about the weight across the world you look many of the young people don't take the weight seriously because of us parents they don't have to hear you they just observe you they they don't even you don't even have to they don't even have to see your action sometimes the energy that you you a meat the life that you live the energy that because we Are Spiritual Beings you know you know you just look at David and then there's there's an energy between that's right just like when you love someone there's a chemistry amen you know a chemistry so there's also a chemistry when you do something wrong there's a chemistry it eventually create what is called an atmosphere and any spiritual being children included can detect that ah can you see what I'm saying so the problem is not that we are correcting them wrong is because we don't leave what we are trying to correct them about that's the problem and and they can't help it but they can pick it up and then it brings the fruits of adults who Foundation is skew or their their house is skew the problem it's not like children are are Scot free is that the right word no no but the problem the foundation you see Paul said I've laid a foundation and everyone who's going to be building must build on this foundation and we are supposed to be now they've come and gone and we are supposed to be on the same foundation not just with words but with our lives too that's right that's right God bless you parents you love mej um it's because he said he said it's not me who wrote that the Lord said that it's because he loves you so much imagine the owner of a flock of sheep just going to e sister na break his leg is that love on the physical part is not but the true fact of the matter is that he went through the hills and the mountains in the Snows and everywhere suffering and breaking his feet and everything to find this sheep which did not listen when he find it out of love I always say to my kids hey come let me give you a px with a smile they say a px with a smile is very painful cuz it's like you enjoying this no no I'm I I don't want to be angry I want to hit you with my love Fair okay but on brothers and sisters we are supposed to be leaders by example not only by our talk but by the energy that we we emit the the atmosphere that we create so let's go to First Peter 5 just going to take it a little bit slow tonight then we'll go fast in a in a little while first Peter my sister first Peter 5 1 Peter 5 I'll show you now why I'm saying what I was saying about parents and also about those that I love I chastise I'll show you is he there just coming let's be patient First Peter 5 I don't want to give you a wrong scripture but I think it's first Peter yeah first Peter 5 first Peter 5 I'll read it for you in the meantime if Talia you still getting it my [Music] sister first Peter 5 Verse 6 right can I read it for you you got it humble yourself therefore under the mighty hand of God that he he may exalt you in due time right casting all your care upon him for he carth for you you agree amen verse eight be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walth about seeking whom he may devour and that's the verse I want to to tell you why I was quoting re the Revelation and the other scripture because you see the devil the devil has got no somebody made a statement one time he said the Devil is a full-time Devil he's going around you where when you say the devil is going around you sometimes we just think about here on Earth he's lering around here looking no no he's going around even around your spirit around your soul where the faith of God is you a daughter and a son of God he's going around there the next thing you find him on your imagination you find him on your affection on your memory on your conscious you he's going around you he's going around you looking to devour you to devour that Faith because he knows you are a son and a daughter of God there's no question about that but he's going around you day in day out sleeping awake he's going around you he's going around you with the thoughts in the mind he's going around you looking how he can devour you whe from any angle he's got you on a dash a big screen a dashboard he analyzes you daily your weaknesses your strength your grow he's the he got the ratios of how you grow how you read your Bible how you it's got every analysis you can think about about you so that is going around you day and night but hey be of good courage because there is a confirmation he while he's seeking whom he can Devour the Bible gave a solution that hey simple seek ye first the kingdom of God stay in the presence of God at all times he cannot do anything be in the atmosphere of the Lord simple things like praying every day reading your Bible every day being in the right atmosphere of the Lord come what may come whatever THS he throws or darts they shall not Prosper any weapon that will be thrown to you cannot Prosper it will only Prosper if you open a gap you forgot the lion is going around you now let's hear about this unwelcomed Christ by this man because we know the story we even know about that woman right so let's just go a little bit and just here we find that Jesus went to this Pharisee knowing very well the behavior of this Pharisee Jesus was a prophet he knew and he was was greater than the prophet he knew that this man who is inviting him he's going to put him at a a garage is even better in the storage there the corner corner corner there he knew but one thing about Jesus Christ is that whenever you invite him he come even if you know that you're are going to embarrass and harass him and put him in a corner and do all sorts of funny monkey shenanigames and anything he knows he knows even if you're genuine and you're going to forget about him and even when you he knows when you only come to him when you need help he knows Jesus Christ knows but you know one thing about him he never says Ah no I'm tired with you when you invite him he comes because he wants to give everyone and every opportunity to come and take for free so he went knowing that he's not going to welcome him even though he invited him he still went now let's read here what the prophet says you see what the first thing that you need to know about the Pharisee is that a a farise the prophet here in this message of unwelcomed Christ he says preached in 1955 I I think there was three or four serons the one of 55091 55091 far see the first thing I want you to know what a Pharisee means a Pharisee means an actor find the Greek word of Pharisee it means somebody that's acting and the prophet says I don't like that somebody who's trying to be what he's not you see that is why h Ood is so popular in today's economy because it's full of actors they act they become imagine if your your character in in the drama you always given to be a wife how many people you would have kissed at the end of your 100 movie that you made you're kissing them in this movie you're acting because you are in Hollywood right so I just gave that example because someone said and this is may be this may be a hard one you're watching a movie of people kissing and they are not husband and wife they're Ting they are Pharisees you are watching them and they kissing what do you think happens to you I'll just leave that one there but that was not my main point a pH is an actor we have too much of that in America it's true actors pretending to be something that you are not acting like something that you are so he knew that he did not mean to invite the Lord he knew actually that he hates him he hated him but he's still in because he wanted to embarrass him he wanted to expose him he wanted to do all sorts of things to make fun of him I can see them coming after the Lord accepted I can see the preparations of the banquet I can see the estas the 6s 600s coming there and The Limousines The Cadillacs and the mays coming on the day at the veranda of the Pharisee coming Great Men of renown coming because he was a rich man yeah I can see them coming and each one gets welcomed get wiped oiled everything given every everything for a wedding because they important I mean for the banet they are important people I can see him boastfully walking around preparing for this great event to take place I can see him you know people given wine glasses what what you know from France what are the names of the ones but arm you know he was in that business before sorry not he he he was in that business not that he was drinking but he'll know he'll give me he'll give you a French name for a wine H so he was there this man and boasting around and and and the Lord also came came and then they probably used that they used the big door that door you know the was those guys at by the door and by the gate by the Vera that were muscled up there were bouncers you know a bouncer yeah those guys like you I don't even know how to do that were wearing suits and duck sasses and red ties and they had things here talking about who's coming that's right back door back door yep over talking discussing and then the Lord they welcomed him then they showed him that that room to go to that storage where he can maybe see from a far off and yet he was an invited there was a messenger a CER the prophet calls him a flank who rushed for maybe he was on the other Hill that side of Mara then from upper heart going to go and invite the Lord and he invited him and he he worked very hard to get through the disciples he persisted because the master the Pharisee Simon sent him and the Lord accepted and when the Lord arrived there he already prepared that when he come the so-called Prophet show him that sign wow okay wow and then the Lord said there before we go there let me just read a few more quotes and then we will finish quote number two from the same message oh yeah this is what I was telling you he hated him he didn't love him everything that the Pharisee does I'm sorry to be hard on the far everything that the Pharisee does you must know you must take the opposite if he says I love you you know that he doesn't love you a Pharisee because he's not himself he's acting he he's acting up on everything that he so he hated him but he say master he just short off saying my master say say it on now why would he be asking him to his dinner for guests when he hated him usually men ask one another to for dinner when they love one another but this Pharisee inviting Jesus but yet he doesn't he that this didn't look right he hates him invites him because people of different categories you know there's a word that says Bears of the same feather Christians we go together because we are beds of the same feather non-christians until when they smoke they scave you your smoke and give your brother because they they appreciate one another he doesn't mind to suck the speit of his friend because they are best of the same feather they they go together yeah they they smoke they share under normal circumstances that cannot happen it's because of the admiration for one they are BS of the now Christians children you know children I've never seen children when we all come together you know H Mo and ab running around and kicking each other only brother armandas did you ever see them playing tou touch and then also Isaac is running with them and kicking each other or brother Ben I never children plays together they identify one another you can you can do the same you can even go to the little ones Bella you can go to the young girls young boys they you you visit for the first time they find who's their who's their bed that can fly together then they play together that's normal We Men We also come together soon before you know it we are talking politics we are talking about money we are talking about opportunities and work if we are Christians we talk about the Lord amen HH before you know it the sisters are already exchanging recipes best of the same feather flock to together so what was this man looking for then because he knew that Jesus is not coming with a limosine young women they go together and they start to talk about their boyfriends young men they go together they start to talk about hey man when do you think you'll get married how how did you find that sister huh I I like it ah but brother be careful so they talk of such things young men young women they talkh musicians you see them everything I'm in that band group everything they talk is music because it's best of the same FEA professionals you'll never find a dentist talking to a optometrist saying yeah yeah yeah yes you know that eye and she says that tooth they're not BS of the same feather they're not b of the same feather what I'm trying to tell you is it was it was a what kind type of an invitation if you are watching you going to say ah what kind of invitation is this one this man inviting that man we shall see right quote next quote you don't only find it around on strees you find it in the pull pit what the spirit of phism this is a hard one for us the spirit of Pharisees you find it on the pulpit you get the fellows go in the Pulpit they get a Pulpit voice well I tell you Brethren a Pulpit voice acting Pharisees hypocrite talk like you you do on the street when when when you are at school you my brother young friend when you are with your group talk the same way as you are in church you see if you can find someone who can tell you something about someone but they're not ready to say that thing when that person comes you know they are Pharisees someone tells me yesterday he says Ah the person who talks about other people at my work I know it's the so and so he's the one who reports all of us I said to myself hey man if that guy comes here will you talk like that if you're not ready to speak that that we are saying about David telling brother col if you not ready that if David comes here you later you do that you are a phe or you are not a Pharisee but be careful of the spirit of just to say you a Pharisee is too hard is let me not put it that way I I withraw that one let me say be careful of the spirit because you have to be able to speak the same thing that you are saying that brother brother David no no no yesterday yeah he he refused to borrow me money and David comes here oh yeah here he is I was just telling my brother that you refuse to borrow me money can you see because you shouldn't be doing it with males with bad spirit with everything everything when you talk about your brother or your sister you should be something that you can say no no I meant this is what I was telling him I was not happy about you I even knew I told you you see so the spirit of far Pharisees behaves it acts all the time so um the prophet says a lot of sisters sometimes you know they like like the men they they put they put on go up to their houses hear them say this is not the sister John get over there in the corner talking to John I don't know if John is the husband or what then while she's talking like that then the phone rings hello this is Sister s so here this is's household how can I help you but she just shouted at John to sit down this is what the prophet is trying to give an example that you cannot be both sides yeah that is a spirit of that you are not welcoming Christ by doing that if you read that scripture that book of SEC Timothy H be before on top there before you go to that verse 16 if you read it you'll see all sorts of things that nowadays they are creeping into the life of a Believer those things are creeping into the life of a Believer because the devil has covered the world with iniquity is full everywhere he vomit stinking everywhere he's got no more place to put his stuff now he's going into the churches he has gone into the churches now he's coming into the life of a Believer because all the world is full of vomit and everything now he time that for the cup of iniquity to be fully full he wants to have a full full full full full coverage of his things now let's be careful that this lion going around us his iniquity let us be sealed with the spirit of the Lord our souls are sealed our Earnest expectation is already done and we are sealed and anything that happens around us it won't affect us that's right right that's what I would like us to do because this unwelcome Jesus Christ must not even be Hur Among Us how do we unwelcome him no we not going to we are not doing like what the Pharisee have done we welcome the Lord in our lives we acknowledge Him as our personal savior we get baptized for many years but our Behavior our actions Our Lives shows that ah we have put him at a corner he's in a corner in a Dusty room somewhere in this big compound only when we need we go to him May Master you know I was just thinking that you can just come and bless the food for us and open the occasion when we need him only so that is a a Pharisee spirit that we must be very careful young people elderly let's be aware and alert the Bible somewhere says Hey be wise yeah like serpents be be wise to be wise is to be alert of your environment and circumstances which you find yourself in we know we work on this world we work with unbelievers we business we do with unbelievers people who cut Corners brother Isaac we work with them so let us be wise let's pray for wisdom for God to give it to us let's pray for an an anointing every time even minute things I've seen someone even brushing their teeth they pray for that toothpaste imagine you you are so much you're not just being religious but you mean this thing that Lord we know these things have been poisoned to destroy us and you know you're the target of the devil the devil is not going to Target some people he's going to Target you Christians and your children he's what's going to do so when you pray pray hard pray for real real real and cry until you see the life of your daughter or your son changing we're going to pray and until that changes this woman that we are talking about here just to wrap up she she you know if you listen to the how the prophet dramatizes it when she heard that Jesus is there she was not invited here yeah yeah that's right she was not invited but you know what she ran home she saw an opportunity she she became wise she saw an opportunity by Revelation she saw it that Jesus is here in my Village to this man she went home quickly that's right you know she went and took all the money and everything everywhere she took all the money that she had and ran to that person there who sells all or or H perfumes and then she said to him hey do you I I what what is your most expensive yeah expensive perfume in the shop the most expensive one and because they know her and her profile that man said she's here what what do you want now today I've got no money no money no money no no no no I'm busy I'm busy today she said I want the most said she's starting again she said of evil character this one okay what okay what do you want to do with it do you have it can you show me then he said okay let me just do he went to the top drawer he said I'm going to just deal with her she thinks she can trick me he went to the top drawer those ones that don't sell every day took the most expensive one the most top top top top top he says I got her today this woman then he put it on the counter he said yeah do you think you can afford this you H you can afford this don't play games with me I know I know you and then she emptied all her money there and she took that Alabaster Box and he was shocked and she didn't wait for him to get shocked or unshocked she took it ran when she got there to the compound brother and sister she found the bouncers you know those guys who are there a c they're all over here and some the more you get closer to where the banquet is it's many of them they armed they don't joke but that woman she you know with the alabaster she I think by the time she got where Jesus was she was like finished because there were the boun house were F fighting her where's your invitation and she fought her way and that's what me and you must do amen we are supposed to be like that woman not like the Pharisee we are supposed to First go empty all the bank account and go get that Alabaster Box all out all out now she she fought her way fought her way fought her way of course the Lord was fighting for her how physically you couldn't overcome and defeat all those guys with the boxing that is a precious expensive and she arrived and she did a service to the Lord we we read about it after she did the service to the Lord and then because the story starts from Back to Front then the Pharisee was looking and waiting for this the Lord knew all about it and then the Lord was telling him that Simon this is what you're doing look at this woman you are missing an opportunity including the fanky guy The Courier that flank guy man he was yeah not so wise yeah true if it was me oh my what were you going to ask the first thing knowing that you are going to invite a prophet yeah that's right the first thing that you get there you address yours first Lord forgive the prophet says he should have said Lord forgive me for my sins amen and pour his heart amen before him because he he you see the devil the devil takes our message this message sister Lou and he use it Opposite on do you know the woman called Delilah yeah that woman was perseverant yeah she was pushy pushy and as she forced her way until sson just die man you know what on my hair was Samson perseverant enough is me and you P are we perseverant enough the Lord is going to answer you the Lord is has got everything in his hand ready but he wants a character of himself that's right to come out of you the Lord fought his way to go to the Cross he fought his way he persevered that no no no no no no no no Gabriel don't call 10,000 Angels don't don't don't don't let me die do you think that was easy he persevered so me and you must be Resolute spiritually resilient amen you look brother it's it's easy okay I can't say there but this is how easy it is was it brother Ben one of our ministers said you know when you know that the game is already one you know that your lord is the creator of the heavens and and Earth and he's got your answer you know that all what you going through is the sufferings for a season and it's is for your good because it's going to take out the character he going to take out all the goodies to suit a queen that's right and a prince and a princess of heaven so that the angels can come and say h how did you guys fight Fe how did you live in environment where you know you are you're a sinner you you fight you you overcome sin while you are in that body the angels are going to be surprised I'm sure even now they how do Lord you are so great how does those people live there look at the footprint of sin footprint wow the Angels don't want to look at it huh but you find a believer talking how the footprint talks there's something that the Angels don't even want to look at me and you are not supposed to be young people listen to me listen to me young men and women this is for your good this is for your good it's only for a season to be an adolescent is just for a season yeah the feelings you feel the behavior the dreams and everything that you have it's just for a little season and you're not going to die yeah therefore be persistent amen be pushy be uh what's the word I was looking for be resilient pray to God every day cry to him if you feel that oh now just cry just go before him and say Lord I'm going to say nothing I'm just going to cry tell the lord lord I want to cry that's right because I'm feeling not easy I want to cry and the Lord's going to those cry that crying those tears are going to be a blessing to the Lord and that's the root for your salvation and for your blessing don't give up don't give up easily and be easy come easy go no you have been bought with a great prize a great great prize I I'm going to I want I'm going to want to W wrap up this one so that we can pray the problem that we have and that enemy also uses to make us Pharisees is this thing called I I I he says that's I I I you know that's a disease this thing called I I I so many people get it I'll do it I did it I will me me AR is telling me about his situation or his work or his then I say oh it mean me brother it's time for me to end in his section and his need feel what he feels but I don't know I'm say even me my brother but he's not talking about me he came to me to tell me me can you see remember the devil is not going to come the Bible says he went to even he was subtle yeah to be subtle means you want to be undetected because if a snake comes with such a big noise it will be detected the devil come in a subtle way by the time you realize that is the devil you're gone yeah so be careful about these things and the only way to be careful and aware is to be in the presence of the Lord all the time there's no way there's no two ways about it you cannot do it that's right the only way is to follow what he said then you'll find out that without no effort without no hard work you come out right because the word of God is got a force behind it amen he called Power behind it if he says let there be light there will be light amen and it will be there because he's God Amen there's no way in which God can place his spirit inside you and he said I'm going to save you and I'm going to give you all your heart desires and then that does not come to pass no ways amen otherwise he's not God yeah there's no way if he says hey I will give you your heart's desire I'll give you a wife I'll give you a husband just know that he's coming and she's coming and because God said it that's right it's got so much power that can create he can create your wife or your husband and he will come because he said I'll give you a if he find that the whole up I don't have a husband he will make him to come right he'll cross the Seas he just find that he wants to go to New Zealand and he wants to go to Shak all right he doesn't know why meanwhile there's a girl or there's a boy God can do that amen so the only thing is for me and for you one to know it deep down in our heart to know it and to believe it and to obey it amen and then we just walk on the line no matter what the devil does because that man wanted to ridicule Jesus if we do that brother and sister we have invited him and we have welcomed him don't worry about the hardships up those things until Paul said brother Isaac oh death he he told death because you preach brother you said I mean who cares what the devil can do the the worst thing he can do is to kill this flesh and we are not afraid of dying we're not afraid of going of course we don't want to go we want to decide if it was possible when to go and when not to go but we've got all the power to say Lord 20 more years please I'm not going to I'm not going now because must be a spiritual it must be according to the spirit of the Lord Lord I'm not going Lord I want this house to be sold Mike and it must be sold for this price am I in this cleaning business sorry I'm just giving our practical examples I want so much this is the amount I want Lord because this money I want to use it for this this this this this include the Lord in there you we we must set our own salary and said I want this much I hear you you're paying all your people so much and I understand the circumstances of your company but let the Lord bless your company so that because I can I want so much this is what I want and I'm a daughter of God me for your information and you by the way you're going to be blessed in this company because you've got a daughter of God nothing about me but there's a daughter of God inside me me I'm going to make mistakes don't say ah daughter of God no no no no there's an inside me right so let's get to that point where we exercise his word as he said it not as a Pharisee who says master and and and and and so the i i issue that's what led me to say these things the i i issue let's get rid of it get out of the way where Jesus belongs in this thing I'll do I'll do I'll have no no let it be as the Lord will amen as the Lord will if the Lord is willing right yeah and you remove the eye you put him there so I'll I'll stop it here brothers and sisters what I want us to do is to use this opportunity that we have because the Pharisee lost it he suspected that this man is a prophet and he doubt he doubted yeah but it was a great opportunity for because that man agreed to come to his house amen he was supposed to give him top of the row he lost an opportunity until the Lord addressed him I can see when he started to make that wedding and just about him him and him selfish and then he the Lord told him he still did not get the Revelation so let's let let us change that seron and make it the welcom Christ in our lives amen and not only verbally we are going to be welcoming him on our day today lives in our thoughts in our actions in our Behavior knowing very well that our enemy is going around us like a roaring lion seeking to devour you knowing very well that no matter how hard it can be he who I love I rebuke and I chastise knowing very well that the cup of iniquity wants to taint you just to taint you a little bit so let certain things not even be heard Among Us let certain things let not the pastor come here and say I'm tired of people who are gossiping let's let's not get that's our food is supposed to be we when are we go we are going but the moment the Holy Spirit comes and rebuke us that like Paul says I've heard that among you there are some who are doing this you know Paul Paul spoke frankly so let let let us pass that bridge let's pass that road let that Spirit know where where it belongs that's right and let us move on into higher places in Christ Jesus so that's my encouragement that's my my my encouragement to you that we don't just come to church and have and be religious and just be good and support the community of this church no no no no no I rather I rather be home let's not just come to church let's come to church that's a good thing but let it be a secondary priority the first priority is that Jesus must find a welcomed in my heart in everything that I do in everything that I I I think about everything that I plan Lord are you approving this are you approving this in my life Lord Lord this is my Salary thank you how how can I use it Hallelujah so may the Lord bless you I I I pray that I've done more encouragement than then rebuke I I I'm not qualified to rebuke the Lord so if you just go and read the Bible you'll find him rebuking and encouraging you and loving you so me I'm just convey I'm just like this mic this mic and those speakers that's a conveyor belt so don't cut the conveyor belt so all I'm trying to say is that he loves you so much that he can take an unworthy sinner SA sa by Grace like myself to come and and remind you we are just reminding one another I'm being reminded myself that be careful of your thoughts be careful of your behavior be careful how you address your wife be careful how you address your brothers and sisters be careful of how you think about them be careful of what you say to other people about them and let us pass that stage into higher places amen and Rapture one of these days amen can you have you ever imagine how is it going to be when when we just above this roof and you realize that oh look you know the excitement is going to be funny it's going to be this body can't contain it it's going to be have you ever seen a happy little puppy have you ever seen it he doesn't know what to do it looks like the own where do you come from to give me such food so the excitement is going to be unimaginable that day you realize that oh you that's why he's going to give you a new body to be able to manage that happiness otherwise this body cannot manage it brother colen when you realize oh I'm young and you you you see a wife you don't know what to do you he's going to give you that body if you have got a relative in UK and Canada and South Africa he's going to give you that body where you'll go there in two seconds and come back quickly here and and that body is capable of doing that because it's not managed by time you just it is faster than a thought when you see all your children amen and you see all your loved ones who has gone before working there this body will go mad that's why you need a new one that's why it's going to get a new one and then you the one that can run faster than brother Armand faster cuz I can't out run him I can't outrun him so I'm going to have that one that way I can outrun him this guy out runs young people I wonder what kind of a body is going to have but anyway H we are soon about to change the cup of iniquity is full let's be careful let's welcome him let the musicians come and I pause right here and uh I think we're just going to
