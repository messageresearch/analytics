[5:25] [Music]
[5:36] so
[5:40] [Music]
[6:18] music welcome to the house of the lord
[6:23] i see we are dwindling in numbers
[6:26] it's uh winter it's cold
[6:30] and just a lot going on everywhere
[6:34] by here you can kick your shoes off
[6:38] and you can come and relax in the
[6:40] presence of our king
[6:41] amen that's why we're here and you mean
[6:45] it's good to
[6:46] get taught it's good to to
[6:49] learn something new and get shown
[6:51] something new and if you have any
[6:52] questions that the lord will answer them
[6:54] for you
[6:55] but the best thing you can do is rest in
[6:58] the presence of the lord
[7:00] amen uh just a couple of formalities
[7:03] before we start with this whole
[7:07] sickness and illness we we have a couple
[7:09] of prayer requests we want to first
[7:10] bring
[7:11] before we even do anything we've got
[7:13] sister barbara
[7:14] see the message just came on the church
[7:16] noticeboard so i don't know she
[7:19] went into the doctor and she's got
[7:22] appointment tomorrow with him
[7:24] and they're just requesting prayer for
[7:26] her looks like it could be something
[7:28] with the heart
[7:29] and we know there's only one that can
[7:31] heal the heart hey and that's the law
[7:33] amen and then we've got another one
[7:37] for um brother phil and sister belinda
[7:41] so they asking that we would pray for
[7:43] them so their car keys could be found
[7:46] and quite important if you don't have
[7:48] your keys so we
[7:49] pray with them that they can find it and
[7:51] then they've got holly and her husband
[7:53] there tonight
[7:54] tony and they just ask that we'll also
[7:56] pray for them
[7:58] that they would hear the word of god you
[8:01] know and they would just
[8:02] walk a bit closer to him and then sister
[8:05] christine is safely home after operation
[8:08] and she's
[8:09] she's getting stronger by the day so we
[8:11] just pray for healing there as well
[8:14] really important
[8:18] and then sister londy said thank you for
[8:20] the priest for
[8:21] of for her family her brother's back
[8:24] home now
[8:24] the stomach is better and he's got no
[8:27] medication for it
[8:29] and he would just keep on praying for
[8:30] him for his strengthening and getting
[8:32] him back on the
[8:33] on his feet it's pretty scary in south
[8:35] africa to go to the hospital these days
[8:37] because you don't know which one you're
[8:38] going to end up in and they're not all
[8:41] the better ones so
[8:42] so we'll pray for those individuals if
[8:44] there's any needs
[8:46] if there's anything you you desire of
[8:48] the lord this is where we bring it
[8:49] before him
[8:50] anything big small as it might even
[8:54] be insignificant but it could be
[8:55] something that locks something up
[8:57] open for you which always been hidden
[8:59] and then the lord can bring healing and
[9:01] restoration
[9:03] and so if you all maybe just stand i
[9:05] just want to read a scripture tonight
[9:08] it's just something that was on my heart
[9:09] and i thought
[9:11] it might sound like a heavy scripture
[9:13] but it's not
[9:14] and then we'll open in a word of prayer
[9:16] it says
[9:18] in 1 timothy 6 verses 10 it says for the
[9:21] love of money
[9:23] is the root of all evil which while some
[9:27] coveted after
[9:28] they have heard from the faith and
[9:31] pierce themselves through with many
[9:34] sorrows
[9:36] but thou o man of god o sister of god i
[9:39] can say
[9:40] flee from these things and follow after
[9:42] righteousness goodness
[9:44] faith love patience and meekness
[9:47] fight the good fight of faith lay hold
[9:50] to eternal life
[9:51] where unto thou art so called
[9:55] and has professed a good profession
[9:58] before many
[9:59] witnesses this walk is our walk
[10:03] regardless how we feel how we look
[10:06] even how people see us just hold on to
[10:09] the good things hold on to faith
[10:11] hold on to hope to love to peace keep
[10:14] the good things in your life there's
[10:16] enough bad things out there keep all the
[10:18] good here
[10:19] so it will help you to stand in this
[10:21] perilous times
[10:22] amen don't chase off the things that at
[10:26] the end of the day
[10:27] the pavement in heaven is made out of it
[10:32] gold can get you anywhere but god he'll
[10:34] get you there
[10:36] the bible says fear not the one that can
[10:37] destroy the body but can destroy the

[15:43] love because he's got
[15:45] amazing love power and then i stand in
[15:47] awe so it's four simple songs
[15:50] but read the words and just sing it for
[15:52] him don't sing it for anyone else

[33:54] the church
[33:54] but where did he go to went to rome
[33:59] that's where he did he got received his
[34:00] crown now the second age was a
[34:03] was a red horse rider which was a dark
[34:05] age
[34:06] and now now the the next age
[34:10] was the uh the man of the of age
[34:13] which was the black horse rider and he
[34:16] was the age
[34:17] of the reformers see when
[34:20] the voices spoke now the black horse
[34:21] rider that was the antichrist
[34:23] but the one that was speaking in that
[34:25] age was represented
[34:27] as man and that's a wisdom smart
[34:31] shrewd see and
[34:34] they didn't get it see they didn't call
[34:37] it an amy
[34:39] see they just said it went forth but now
[34:41] when it comes forth the eagle age
[34:44] that's the one that god always likens
[34:47] his prophets to
[34:48] eagles he calls himself an eagle the
[34:50] eagle goes so high
[34:52] ain't nothing else can touch him not
[34:54] only is he up there but he's built for
[34:56] that position
[34:57] when he gets up there you see where he's
[34:59] at some people get up there and can't
[35:01] see where they're at so i don't get to
[35:02] get up there
[35:03] but if you but you let a crow try to fly
[35:06] with an eagle or a hawk either one he'd
[35:07] disintegrate
[35:09] he's got to be pressurized for where he
[35:11] goes that's the trouble today
[35:13] some of us don't get pressurized we
[35:15] explode too quick you see when we're
[35:17] jumping in
[35:17] but we've got to be pressurized when you
[35:19] get up there and have
[35:21] the keen silent eagle to see what's
[35:23] coming
[35:24] i know what to do now the eagle age
[35:27] reveal it
[35:29] now we find out that eagle age was
[35:31] promised in
[35:32] revelations 10 7 and and malachi 1
[35:36] 4 that would be in the last days
[35:39] that's right that it would be here
[35:42] all right notice now
[35:46] this fella we find out that he's riding
[35:49] on a
[35:49] pale horse pale
[35:55] oh my
[35:59] after notice after 68
[36:03] million protestants as we talked from
[36:06] from uh smucker's uh uh glorious reform
[36:10] of the
[36:11] or the moderology of rome last night we
[36:14] find that
[36:15] up to the 1500 mark i believe it was or
[36:17] 18 i don't remember exactly now
[36:19] but it was 68
[36:23] million putt to death to protest
[36:27] the first roman church
[36:30] oh no wonder he could impersonate
[36:33] himself
[36:33] in the persified uh name of
[36:37] and call death he sure was
[36:40] now god only knows how many he
[36:44] calls to spiritually die by his
[36:48] anti-bible word teaching
[36:50] this is the one he put 68 million to the
[36:53] sword and killed
[36:55] and probably literally billions
[36:59] died spiritually on his false teachings
[37:01] [Music]
[37:03] no wonder you could take the name of
[37:04] death see the writer
[37:07] the first place as an antichrist he was
[37:10] deaf to begin with
[37:12] but he's innocent man then he received a
[37:15] crown a triple one
[37:17] and when he did then he united satan
[37:20] united
[37:21] is church and state because he is over
[37:23] both of them man
[37:26] anti-christ was satan
[37:29] in the form of a man amen and then
[37:32] also saint matthew
[37:36] i believe it is the fourth chapter tells
[37:38] us that that
[37:39] satan took jesus our lord up and showing
[37:42] the kingdoms of the world all of them in
[37:44] a moment of time and the glory of them
[37:46] offered them to him and he said they
[37:48] were his
[37:50] so you see then if he can unite
[37:53] his state and his church together then
[37:56] the red horse rider could ride sure
[37:58] enough
[37:59] truly now then we find out
[38:04] this mystery here in his church's state
[38:07] the fourth stage of his ministry
[38:10] he's called the beast first he's called
[38:14] the antichrist
[38:15] see then he's called the false prophet
[38:18] and he's called the beast now we find
[38:21] him here
[38:22] be called as the beast now i want you to
[38:25] notice
[38:27] that's after the fourth horse and
[38:30] in this fourth horse if you'll notice
[38:34] all the first one was white
[38:37] and then the next one was red and the
[38:40] next one was black
[38:41] and the fourth one all of these
[38:45] other three was representing it because
[38:47] pale
[38:48] is red and and uh white and
[38:51] so mixed together see it is all mixed in
[38:55] this one horse
[38:57] see and there he become four or actually
[39:00] the three in one and is all mixed up in
[39:04] that one thing
[39:06] i want you to notice the four of them
[39:08] notice the off
[39:09] mark of four of the spiritual
[39:12] mathematics
[39:14] god is threes this
[39:17] is four he's in four here first
[39:20] antichrist white second false prophet
[39:25] red third biker of heavens and earth
[39:28] and purgatory black fourth the beast
[39:32] pale horse satan being kicked out of
[39:34] heaven
[39:35] if you want to read that revelations 12
[39:38] and
[39:38] 13. satan being kicked out of heaven
[39:42] then in revelation 13 1 8 he is
[39:44] incarnate in the person
[39:46] of the beast
[39:48] [Music]
[39:49] his first antichrist yes it's the
[39:52] teaching called
[39:53] nickelodeon then he becomes from that to
[39:57] a false prophet
[39:59] if he's an antichrist antichrist is
[40:02] against
[40:03] anything that's against god's word is
[40:05] against god because the word
[40:07] is god the beginning was the word orders
[40:10] with god the word was made flesh
[40:12] christ and dwelt among us and now he is
[40:15] against the word so he be
[40:17] anti-christ but a spirit cannot be
[40:20] crowned that's reason they didn't
[40:21] receive a crown just a bowl with no
[40:22] arrows
[40:23] and then when he come to crowning time
[40:26] then he become the false
[40:28] prophet of his antichrist teaching yep
[40:31] and he gets a sword because he unites
[40:33] his powers together
[40:35] then you don't have to ask nobody he's
[40:38] governor of state
[40:39] he's governor of heaven receives a
[40:41] triple crown
[40:43] mixes up an idea called purgatory where
[40:45] if some of them died back then he got
[40:47] some money they want to pay him out
[40:48] he can pray him out of it because he's
[40:50] got the power to do so he's a biker
[40:53] certainly he takes the place of god on
[40:56] earth
[40:57] but he is plain as anything we find it
[40:59] put it on down through the bible
[41:00] county's numeral numbers and everything
[41:02] else
[41:02] yuri is claimed right back here in
[41:04] number four not number three
[41:06] number four see now let's turn
[41:08] revelation is 12. let's just read this
[41:10] just a little bit because we
[41:11] we'll have time to do it and um let's
[41:14] read uh
[41:15] revelations the 12th chapter
[41:18] and the 13th verse and the same
[41:22] hour there was a great earthquake no i
[41:25] got
[41:25] i got the wrong place the 13th and when
[41:28] the dragon saw
[41:29] that he was cast out into the earth
[41:33] persecuted the woman which brought forth
[41:36] the man
[41:37] child now i see he was cast out of the
[41:40] earth
[41:40] and becomes incarnate as the antichrist
[41:44] spirit become
[41:44] incarnate into a man that man changes
[41:47] from
[41:48] one thing to another from an antichrist
[41:50] spirit to a false prophet
[41:52] and then the beast comes into him just
[41:54] exactly like the church grows his church
[41:57] went from
[41:57] from antichrist to false prophet and in
[42:00] the great age to come
[42:01] the beast that is to rise up so the
[42:04] church comes the same way through
[42:06] justification
[42:06] sanctification and the baptism of the
[42:08] holy ghost is christ
[42:10] being in the people just exactly and
[42:13] he's got the anti-type of it over there
[42:15] the see
[42:16] the type of it rather there he is
[42:19] just exactly that's him it's kicked out
[42:22] of heaven
[42:23] now we find out in revelations 13 1-8
[42:27] and i stood up on the sands of the sea
[42:29] and saw a beast rise up now here's 12
[42:31] where was kicked out now watch
[42:34] saw a beast rise up out of the sea
[42:36] having seven heads and ten horns
[42:38] and upon his horns ten crowns and upon
[42:41] his head the name of blasphemy
[42:44] and the beast which i saw was likened to
[42:48] a leopard and his feet well if we just
[42:49] had time now we take the rest tonight
[42:51] right on them symbols and show bring it
[42:52] right straight to him again and he
[42:54] most already know that from other
[42:56] lessons where the feet of a bear
[42:59] and his mouth the mouth of the lion and
[43:01] the dragon give him his power
[43:03] seed and authority incarnate satan
[43:07] amen amen i saw one of his heads just
[43:10] wounded to death and on down his but go
[43:12] if you want to
[43:12] get a chance to read it on down all
[43:14] right let's let's read this a little bit
[43:16] and i saw one of his heads as it was
[43:17] wounded death
[43:18] and his deadly wound was healed and all
[43:21] the world wandered after the beast
[43:24] you just watched don't you never watch
[43:26] communism
[43:28] it's nothing but a tool playing in the
[43:30] hands of god
[43:31] to help you someday to get revenge the
[43:33] blood as we get tomorrow night
[43:36] and they worship the dragon who was the
[43:39] dragon
[43:40] satan that right the red dragon
[43:44] all right which gave power to the beast
[43:47] where you get his power and see and they
[43:49] worship the beast saying who is like him
[43:51] to the beast
[43:52] who's able to make war with it that was
[43:55] given unto him a mouse speaking
[43:57] great things of blasphemy and power was
[44:00] given to him
[44:01] to continue 42 months and he opened his
[44:04] mouth
[44:04] and blasphemy against god
[44:10] to blaspheme his name give him a title
[44:15] his tabernacle which is the holy
[44:17] spirit's dwelling place to make it a
[44:19] place in rome a vatican city
[44:22] you just go on down and then the dwell
[44:24] in heaven
[44:25] blaspheme them but saying they were
[44:27] intercessors
[44:30] and it was given unto him to make war
[44:32] with the saints and he did
[44:34] and to overcome them he did burn him to
[44:37] the stake fed him to the lines and kill
[44:39] him any way he could
[44:41] and power was given to him over all
[44:43] kinders tongues and nations it never did
[44:44] become that way in rome
[44:46] until pagan rome was converted into
[44:49] papal rome and the catholic power spread
[44:51] the world
[44:52] amen made the universal catholic church
[44:54] amen
[44:55] and all that dwell upon the earth shall
[44:57] worship him
[44:58] whose names were not written in the book
[45:01] touch
[45:02] not my in mine
[45:04] [Music]
[45:06] and all that dwell upon the earth shall
[45:08] worship him
[45:09] whose names were not written in the book
[45:11] of life
[45:12] of the lamb slain from the foundation of
[45:15] the world
[45:16] if any man has an ear let him hear amen
[45:19] he that lead to the captivity shall go
[45:20] into captivity
[45:21] he that killed with a sword must be
[45:23] killed with a sword here is the patience
[45:25] and faith of the saints
[45:26] now we had him coming last night with
[45:28] his great sword to kill
[45:30] we find out that he gets killed with the
[45:32] sword too the sword of the word
[45:34] god's word shrub to a sword
[45:37] slays he puts him right down wait for
[45:40] them seven thunders
[45:41] under their voices to that group who
[45:43] really can take the word of god and hand
[45:45] it there it'll slice and
[45:47] cut them they can close the heavens they
[45:49] can shut this or do that whatever they
[45:50] want to
[45:55] you'll be slayed by the word that
[45:59] proceeds from his mouth is sharper than
[46:01] a two-eighth sword
[46:02] they could call for a hundred billion
[46:04] tons of flies if they wanted to
[46:08] whatever they say is gonna happen
[46:10] because it's a word of god
[46:12] coming from the mouth of god
[46:15] amen god always is his word but he
[46:17] always uses man to work
[46:19] god could qualify and flies down that
[46:21] egypt but he said moses that's your job
[46:22] i'll just tell you what to do you go do
[46:24] it he fully
[46:26] done that see he could have chosen the
[46:28] son to call him he could cause the moon
[46:30] to call it or the wind to call it but he
[46:32] he said moses
[46:33] that's he chose his man all right now we
[46:36] find out here
[46:37] that this satan after being kicked out
[46:40] of heaven
[46:41] incarnates himself in the beast and now
[46:44] he
[46:44] is a beast antichrist
[46:47] false prophet and now beast and given
[46:51] the name of death
[46:52] and hell followers fully satan only
[46:56] strong
[46:57] oh my god on the earth he's satan
[47:00] representative on the earth that
[47:04] he now is head of
[47:07] the kingdoms of the world the very same
[47:11] kingdoms that he offered to the lord
[47:13] jesus in matthew 4.
[47:16] satan now becomes a full king
[47:20] this happens later on he's false prophet
[47:23] now
[47:24] he will become beast after a while when
[47:26] he breaks his covenant there at the jews
[47:27] you don't have me
[47:28] all right notice now he'd be given a
[47:30] heart of a beast at that time
[47:32] and satan will incarnate itself because
[47:34] when the church goes up
[47:36] satan's cast out it's done man
[47:40] all this accusing is done see as long as
[47:44] as long as the intercessor
[47:47] is still on the throne satan can stand
[47:50] there and accuse
[47:52] because he is the attorney of the other
[47:55] side
[47:56] he is the opponent of christ and christ
[47:59] is he's standing there the opponent
[48:02] is standing there saying but wait adam
[48:05] fell
[48:06] yeah adam done this i
[48:09] conquered him i got his wife to believe
[48:12] a lie he said should be damned by
[48:14] i got it but here's the mediator
[48:17] standing there amen amen the kinsmen
[48:19] redeemer
[48:20] hey man stand there with a blood that
[48:23] can
[48:24] take the stylish sinner's heart and
[48:26] change it
[48:27] [Music]
[48:30] it's on the throne satan said but
[48:33] they're
[48:34] guilty he can say they're not
[48:37] that's porous was invented or
[48:39] manufactured to take stain
[48:42] take the color out of ink or any other
[48:45] stain
[48:46] they've got it it'll break it up to you
[48:48] it never will finally and it goes back
[48:50] to gases all the way back to
[48:51] cosmic light and the past molecules and
[48:54] everything else to turns back to the
[48:56] original predict
[48:57] where it comes out it's a creation head
[48:59] a creation had to come from a creator
[49:01] but
[49:02] all the chemicals that was manufactured
[49:04] and put together broke up and that's
[49:06] just all there is to it there's no more
[49:08] of it
[49:09] even the very the very water
[49:12] substance it is blends with the clorox
[49:15] which is ashes amen
[49:18] lord of god it's all clean that's what
[49:20] the blood of jesus christ does to the
[49:22] true child of god
[49:24] when he confesses that sin stands are
[49:26] justified in his
[49:28] mercy goodness even it's so grateful god
[49:32] said i can't even remember it anymore
[49:34] [Applause]
[49:37] and he's absolutely my son hallelujah
[49:41] clearly i say to you if you sit to this
[49:43] mountain be moved it don't
[49:44] doubt in your heart but believe that
[49:46] what you said you shall come to pass you
[49:48] can have that what you said
[49:49] [Music]
[49:49] [Applause]
[49:54] amen i know that's true i've seen
[49:57] squirrels got period on six different
[50:00] times that i
[50:01] knew nothing more that would be sitting
[50:03] here
[50:04] just as he could create squirrels as
[50:06] soon as he create flies or frogs or
[50:08] anything else god the creator
[50:12] right and when no mortal being but when
[50:15] that
[50:15] sin of that mortal is confessed and
[50:18] dropped into that
[50:19] clorox of the bleach of jesus christ
[50:21] that bleaches all sin
[50:23] he's purely unadulterated
[50:28] he that's born of god does not commit
[50:30] sin for he cannot change
[50:33] what bleach stands between him and god
[50:36] how can it ever get there when he breaks
[50:38] it up and sends it right back to the one
[50:39] who perverted it
[50:43] i feel religious i i get stimulations
[50:46] now
[50:47] if this begins to reveal notice
[50:51] fully satan on his throne
[50:54] yes sir offered it to god offered it to
[50:56] our lord
[50:57] here he is sitting here with this beasty
[50:59] heart in him now
[51:01] here is the person the beast the
[51:04] incarnate
[51:05] devil he makes his appearing here on
[51:09] earth
[51:10] under the false pretense oh my goodness
[51:16] under the false pretense of the true
[51:18] word
[51:19] he associates himself with the word
[51:22] he did just the same thing that is his
[51:26] type did
[51:27] which was judas two thousand years ago
[51:31] what did he do judas came in as
[51:34] a believer being a devil from the
[51:37] beginning
[51:38] he was born the son of perdition he
[51:41] pulled nothing over on jesus because he
[51:43] knowed him from the very beginning amen
[51:46] for he was the word
[51:47] amen all right and remember judas
[51:50] took the place as treasure and
[51:54] fell by money so does the church of this
[51:58] day
[51:59] the catholic church that we noticed last
[52:01] night charging for no genius charging
[52:03] for
[52:03] uh prayers and charging for everything
[52:05] it's almost same that they fell the same
[52:07] thing to the
[52:08] daughters of the catholic churches the
[52:10] protestant the whole thing's wrapped up
[52:12] in mine
[52:14] that's where judas fell and here's where
[52:17] he fell
[52:18] and there's where the protestants fall
[52:21] watch rides a pale horse
[52:25] as he appears
[52:28] on his ride this last ride he's on his
[52:31] last now
[52:33] now there is not an rd that will be on
[52:36] down this is sealed
[52:37] foretold of course see the church has
[52:39] done gone up
[52:40] when this happens when christ appears
[52:43] here
[52:43] on earth as ju as
[52:46] as this fellow appears and becomes
[52:49] completely
[52:51] completely the devil from antichrist
[52:56] all the way down to false prophet then
[52:59] into the beast the devil himself
[53:03] and he's riding on a pale horse colored
[53:07] all up mixed with all kinds of colors
[53:08] to make him pale and deathly but when
[53:11] our lord appears here
[53:13] on earth he'll be riding on a
[53:16] snow white horse and he'll be completely
[53:20] fully the emanuel the
[53:23] word of god incarnate in a man
[53:32] notice the antichrist is on a pale horse
[53:36] mixed colors
[53:37] a horse is a beast that represents a
[53:40] power
[53:40] his power is all mixed up why it's
[53:43] politics
[53:45] it's uh it's national powers
[53:48] it's uh religious powers it's demon
[53:52] powers
[53:53] it's all kinds of powers mixed together
[53:56] a mixed pale horse was he's got all
[53:59] kinds of powers
[54:00] but when jesus comes it's on a one
[54:03] solid color horse the word
[54:08] amen
[54:12] this one mixes its colors of red white
[54:14] black
[54:15] three colors in one represented in one
[54:19] and three powers represented in one
[54:23] a white horse black horse red horse
[54:26] and three crowns in one
[54:29] [Music]
[54:30] sure i seen the crown myself
[54:34] just all that close looked at it but let
[54:36] me get to it on counter glass
[54:39] so there it was big lock on it set in a
[54:41] case triple crown
[54:43] so i know it's true so there he was
[54:47] triple ground
[54:48] biker heaven purgatory
[54:51] and earth three powers united together
[54:55] see all mixed up in a color pale
[54:58] death spoken a whole thing political
[55:01] and religious and and demon powers
[55:05] mixed together politics he is the key of
[55:08] politics
[55:09] satanists smart
[55:12] sure don't try to outwin just just trust
[55:14] the law
[55:16] [Music]
[55:18] i've all went through before all smart
[55:21] educations and things like that come
[55:23] from the wrong side
[55:26] just follow through the scripture find
[55:28] out that's right follow cain's children
[55:30] see what they become
[55:32] they follow says children see what they
[55:33] want
[55:35] not as i'm supporting ignorance not at
[55:36] all
[55:38] but you take any person's harley of the
[55:41] bible
[55:41] very seldom and there's one named paul
[55:44] that was a smart man
[55:45] and he said he had forget everything he
[55:46] know no heard or no christ
[55:48] he said i'll never come to you with
[55:50] enticing words of wisdom of man but i
[55:52] come to you in the power of the
[55:54] resurrection of christ
[55:55] that's right the power of the holy ghost
[55:58] look at the others some of them didn't
[55:59] know right to left hand and
[56:01] all i look down through the age of the
[56:03] prophets and where they come from and
[56:05] so forth see what i mean see it's a
[56:07] smart intellectual
[56:09] and wisdom wisdom is exactly the very
[56:11] thing that takes you away from god
[56:13] hallelujah he had three powers on
[56:17] two three jewish dictions of earth
[56:19] heaven and purgatory
[56:21] he is himself a trinity that's what he's
[56:24] made up of
[56:25] and he rides in the trinity his powers
[56:27] in the trinity his
[56:28] crowns in the trinity his horse is in
[56:30] the trinity
[56:32] is that what he is a trinity a power
[56:35] trinity a crown of trinity a horse
[56:38] riding of trinity that's of offices
[56:41] a four again
[56:46] all right three stages of his ministry
[56:50] makes him one person satan incarnate
[56:53] three stages of many antichrist false
[56:56] prophets and
[56:59] beast and three
[57:02] hyphens see now these three types now
[57:04] that makes him go
[57:06] god makes himself known too and water
[57:08] blood spirit
[57:10] makes a christian a son of god by the
[57:12] word of god
[57:13] see and these three powers makes him a
[57:15] devil
[57:17] see all of this shares water blood and
[57:19] spirit which is of god
[57:20] and that's politics religion and demon
[57:24] power mixed together
[57:25] makes him the devil christ first coming
[57:29] immortal he comes three times christ is
[57:32] in three
[57:33] watch how he comes he's a four what's
[57:36] christ
[57:36] first coming he come immortal to bleed
[57:39] and die is that right
[57:41] that's his first coming the second
[57:43] coming is the rapture
[57:44] we meet him in the skies immoral his
[57:47] third coming
[57:48] he's the incarnate god
[57:51] uh party manual for rain on earth
[57:55] right 43 fourth stage of the rider
[58:00] watch the fourth stage of this rider is
[58:02] called death
[58:04] death means eternal separation from god
[58:09] that's what death means to be eternal
[58:13] separated from god now if we place this
[58:15] fellow out
[58:16] place if we have showed by the bible who
[58:20] that fellow
[58:21] is and we even took the heels of place
[58:23] and everywhere just exactly detailed
[58:25] right on down
[58:26] and now he's called by the eagle
[58:30] death amen
[58:33] that's what he calls it remember here
[58:36] see death is eternal separation remember
[58:40] saints don't die they sleep
[58:44] not die you heard my words and believe
[58:46] that all of them send me as
[58:47] eternal life that's right shall not come
[58:50] into the judgments pass from death unto
[58:53] life
[58:54] i am the resurrection life says jesus he
[58:56] that believeth in me though he were dead
[58:58] yet shall he live and whosoever liveth
[59:00] and believe with me shall
[59:01] never not lazarus dead he's sleeping
[59:05] amen fear not the girls not dead but
[59:08] sleepeth they left him the scorn is that
[59:10] right
[59:11] yes amen oh man
[59:14] see saints don't die separation from god
[59:17] is there
[59:18] eternal death and this fellow is called
[59:22] death so keep away from me amen
[59:26] why is he an organized organizational
[59:28] system the first
[59:44] i mean we just have a quick recap if you
[59:46] want to turn to revelations chapter six
[59:49] i mean this is incredible because this
[59:51] is you know really what we have um
[59:53] looked at in the past three seals has
[59:55] been the past
[59:56] the other part yeah but this is present
[1:00:00] um we read here
[1:00:04] uh revelation six for uh verses seven
[1:00:07] and eight
[1:00:08] and uh csm and
[1:00:11] when he had opened the fourth seal i
[1:00:13] heard the voice of the fourth
[1:00:15] beast say come and see now if you read
[1:00:18] the other first three seals
[1:00:19] when one of the seals opens
[1:00:22] uh it only says one of the four beasts
[1:00:25] says come and see but the
[1:00:27] fourth one it says and i heard the voice
[1:00:28] of the fourth beast say come and see
[1:00:31] and there's a reason that why there's a
[1:00:33] the voice and
[1:00:34] it doesn't just say the beast say come
[1:00:36] and see is because that fourth beast is
[1:00:38] the
[1:00:39] is the fourth cheer around the throne
[1:00:40] which is the face of an eagle and so
[1:00:42] this eagle brings a prophetic message
[1:00:45] that's why it says the voice of the
[1:00:46] fourth be say come and see it's a subtle
[1:00:48] difference but there's a big
[1:00:49] significance in that
[1:00:50] and this is the message that we feast on
[1:00:53] this is the end time message this is
[1:00:54] the prophetic anointing that has been
[1:00:56] released on this age it was it was
[1:00:58] manifested through the prophet but now
[1:01:00] that same holy ghost anointing is now on
[1:01:02] a people
[1:01:03] so what he preaches we can see because
[1:01:05] the same anointing that is on him
[1:01:06] is on us of the holy spirit this says
[1:01:09] the voice of the fourth be say come and
[1:01:11] see
[1:01:11] and so now now notice here and i looked
[1:01:14] and i saw a pale horse
[1:01:16] and his name that he set on on him was
[1:01:19] death so this is the first time this
[1:01:20] writer
[1:01:21] is ever named and hell followed with him
[1:01:25] and power was given unto him now notice
[1:01:28] notice how he kills because if you if
[1:01:30] you take the first three seals how they
[1:01:32] kill
[1:01:33] it's now wrapped up into the four so
[1:01:34] what i'm showing is what brother brown
[1:01:36] said
[1:01:36] is all mixed the first three mix into
[1:01:38] the fourth this is it all here uh in the
[1:01:40] scripture
[1:01:41] and i looked and i beheld a a pale horse
[1:01:43] and his name that sat on him was death
[1:01:45] and hell followed with him and power was
[1:01:47] given unto him
[1:01:48] over the fourth part of the earth to
[1:01:50] kill with the sword
[1:01:52] with hunger and with death and with the
[1:01:55] beasts of the earth so the first
[1:01:58] first first horse rider the white horse
[1:02:00] rider
[1:02:01] went forth as antichrist spirit
[1:02:02] deception was that death
[1:02:04] spiritual death to kill with the sword
[1:02:07] what's that that's the red horse rider
[1:02:09] physical death right and then the third
[1:02:11] horse rider one wheat
[1:02:12] you know one measure of uh you know one
[1:02:14] measure of what
[1:02:16] we'll we'll just read it and i heard a
[1:02:18] voice in the midst of the throne saying
[1:02:19] a measure
[1:02:20] of wheat for a penny and three measures
[1:02:21] of barley for a penny and see that hurt
[1:02:23] not the oil and the wine so that's
[1:02:25] so there's actually a physical well
[1:02:26] there's actually a spiritual control of
[1:02:28] access to the
[1:02:29] eternal life the true word of god to
[1:02:30] live by so all those things are wrapped
[1:02:32] up into
[1:02:33] the fourth seal now brother braham says
[1:02:36] him and and um
[1:02:37] if i can find the quote but but he says
[1:02:39] here
[1:02:40] that the um the beast
[1:02:44] satan is cast down when the bride goes
[1:02:46] up
[1:02:47] so what we are seeing now is all of you
[1:02:50] could say the mechanics of this coming
[1:02:52] into being
[1:02:53] and really it's here it's here you know
[1:02:56] we you know especially i mean pretty
[1:02:58] much all of us in our generation we were
[1:03:00] born when the
[1:03:01] when the world had already fallen apart
[1:03:04] we already
[1:03:04] you know we were already here and the
[1:03:06] world had fallen apart so
[1:03:08] we have never seen the contrast of the
[1:03:09] world functioning
[1:03:11] and it falling apart we've just been
[1:03:12] birthed into chaos
[1:03:15] so all of this all of the mechanics of
[1:03:18] satan making his final ride is in place
[1:03:22] all that needs to happen is the bride
[1:03:23] goes up he comes down
[1:03:26] becomes incarnate satan takes control
[1:03:30] but this doesn't happen until the bride
[1:03:32] goes
[1:03:33] up and it's very interesting how he said
[1:03:37] he said here don't worry about communism
[1:03:41] communism communism is your friend
[1:03:45] people are so panicking about china and
[1:03:47] russia
[1:03:48] and the communist experience going on
[1:03:50] brother braham says that as
[1:03:51] nebuchadnezzar was raised up to bring
[1:03:53] judgment upon israel in the old
[1:03:55] testament
[1:03:56] so the spirit of communism has risen up
[1:03:58] to bring judgment on the
[1:03:59] christ-rejecting world
[1:04:02] so it's sad that these things must be
[1:04:05] but it's result of people rejecting the
[1:04:06] holy ghost
[1:04:09] so he says it'll it's your friend so
[1:04:11] don't worry so basically what he's
[1:04:12] saying is don't worry about this world
[1:04:15] and the trouble because we can get
[1:04:16] stirred up in all kinds of trouble
[1:04:18] everywhere
[1:04:18] you can go down a rabbit hole of
[1:04:20] something conspiracies trouble on every
[1:04:22] hand
[1:04:23] but you cannot stop this being fulfilled
[1:04:26] but we've heard a voice they said come
[1:04:29] out of her my people be not partaker of
[1:04:31] her plagues
[1:04:32] and that voice had come out and then
[1:04:34] come into christ
[1:04:35] that we can go on a rapture amen so we
[1:04:38] are the most blessed people
[1:04:39] in the whole world this is the greatest
[1:04:42] time to be alive
[1:04:44] blessed are your eyes for they see
[1:04:46] that's right even if you've got an
[1:04:48] inkling you say i want to serve god
[1:04:49] you're blessed to have that desire
[1:04:50] amen and you just take that desire and
[1:04:52] say lord just take my life and make it
[1:04:54] thine and
[1:04:55] you know but all of these things are
[1:04:57] coming together we don't need to fear
[1:04:59] them
[1:05:00] because the lord is in control
[1:05:03] amen he's in control he's not panicking
[1:05:06] he's not worried about his bride
[1:05:08] he knows his blood is enough he knows
[1:05:10] that you know he is still our protector
[1:05:12] he's our defender
[1:05:13] he will not let the other righteous be
[1:05:15] forsaken
[1:05:17] amen so he's with us whether you feel it
[1:05:20] or not he's present
[1:05:23] right he's brought you to him it says in
[1:05:25] the scripture
[1:05:26] uh ii thessalonians you know uh well
[1:05:29] let's let's just read there real quick
[1:05:31] and then and then and then we'll
[1:05:32] um because we're going to go into prayer
[1:05:35] um
[1:05:36] but this is kind of trying to avoid
[1:05:40] i don't want to go off on a tangent but
[1:05:42] this is here
[1:05:44] we're in 2nd thessalonians
[1:05:48] we're in chapter two and verse one i
[1:05:50] believe
[1:05:56] if you realize who gathered you
[1:05:59] hallelujah
[1:06:01] second thessalonians and two and one
[1:06:05] now i beseech you brethren by the coming
[1:06:08] of our lord jesus christ and by our
[1:06:09] gathering together unto
[1:06:12] him so he's not physically come
[1:06:16] but his word has come he has come in the
[1:06:17] form of his word
[1:06:19] right he has to send it with a shout out
[1:06:21] but whoever gathered to
[1:06:23] him not to a church not to a man not to
[1:06:26] a prophet
[1:06:27] but to the lord jesus christ a living
[1:06:29] word and he has gathered us to
[1:06:32] himself why to take us in a rapture
[1:06:36] amen so we don't need to fear
[1:06:40] anything in this world sure it may be
[1:06:43] dark but it's never been so bright
[1:06:46] as this day this glorious day
[1:06:49] amen so um amen so i trust i trust it
[1:06:53] all
[1:06:54] makes sense you see the first three
[1:06:55] horse riders
[1:06:57] are all merged into the fourth and that
[1:06:59] brings him from antichrist spirit to a
[1:07:02] false prophet
[1:07:03] then eventually the beast incarnate
[1:07:05] right just as god went from
[1:07:07] justification to sanctification to the
[1:07:09] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:07:11] amen so as the devil's going to become
[1:07:13] incarnate
[1:07:14] and a man so christ but christ has
[1:07:16] already become encountered in a people
[1:07:18] and when we go up he comes down
[1:07:22] amen but i love it how brother brown was
[1:07:24] saying about how the accuser is still
[1:07:26] there accusing us before god day and
[1:07:29] night but the lord says no they're not
[1:07:30] guilty
[1:07:31] amen because my blood has cleansed them
[1:07:33] of all sin i can't even find it there's
[1:07:35] there's no traces of it it's all gone he
[1:07:38] says they've done it he said they didn't
[1:07:40] do it in the first place
[1:07:41] i mean they're justified so we can
[1:07:43] rejoice i was just sitting back there
[1:07:44] saying lord give me a greater revelation
[1:07:46] of the power of your blood oh yeah
[1:07:47] you know just a yo we know we've been
[1:07:49] cleansed but lord just make it just so
[1:07:50] much more real
[1:07:51] i mean to know that we're we are free of
[1:07:53] all spot all wrinkle
[1:07:55] anything the devil could hold against us
[1:07:57] it's gone
[1:07:59] hallelujah amen and if he's standing
[1:08:01] there in the heavens making a decision
[1:08:03] for you and i
[1:08:04] i mean nothing can stand before him it
[1:08:07] doesn't matter what the devil what
[1:08:08] trumped up charges he tries to bring
[1:08:10] amen the blood of jesus christ is taking
[1:08:13] care of it we have an advocate jesus
[1:08:15] christ the righteous
[1:08:17] hallelujah amen i'd just like to sing a
[1:08:19] song actually before we go to prayer
[1:08:21] um i'd like to sing that song again
[1:08:22] we're joint heirs of the father
[1:08:25] amen and and and there's another verse
[1:08:27] in there i saw it creep up and i said
[1:08:29] i'd like to sing that one too
[1:08:31] and then we're going to go to prayer a
[1:08:33] few prayer requests and
[1:08:35] yeah praise the lord we are living in a
[1:08:37] tremendous day
[1:08:40] amen just like brother graham says about
[1:08:43] before the first bomb drops the bride is
[1:08:46] gone
[1:08:48] so we don't need to worry about anything
[1:08:51] i believe that don't you amen
[1:08:54] we're in good hands amen
[1:08:58] amen shall we shall we stand
