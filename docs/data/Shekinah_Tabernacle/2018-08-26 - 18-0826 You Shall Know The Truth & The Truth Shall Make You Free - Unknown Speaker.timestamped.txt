[48:15] let's let's turn to the Gospel of John
[48:18] let's go to eighth chapter excuse me
[48:25] amen
[48:27] so John 8 and verse we're gonna read
[48:30] from verse 30 31 let me go down to verse
[48:37] 38 then jesus said to those Jews which
[48:41] believed on him if you continue in my
[48:44] word then ye are my disciples indeed and
[48:48] you shall know the truth and the truth
[48:51] shall make you free
[48:54] I want emphasize that if you continue in
[48:56] my word there's a continuing then you
[49:00] are my disciples indeed who wants to be
[49:01] jesus disciple and then and then let's
[49:05] see the the what will happen and then
[49:08] you shall know the truth and the truth
[49:10] shall make you free and they answered
[49:12] him we be Abraham's seed were never in
[49:15] bondage to any man shall say thal you
[49:18] shall be free jesus answered them verily
[49:21] verily I say to you who so whosoever
[49:23] committeth sin is the servant of sins
[49:25] and we know ultimately is unbelief and
[49:28] the servant abideth not in the house
[49:31] ever but the son abideth ever if the son
[49:34] therefore shall make you free
[49:36] you shall
[49:37] be free indeed I know that you're
[49:41] Abraham's seed but you seek to kill me
[49:43] because my word has no place in you I
[49:45] speak that which I've seen with my
[49:47] father and you do that which you have
[49:49] seen with your father Amy may the Lord
[49:52] blesses word this morning you may have
[49:54] your seats I want to speak from I want
[49:59] to speak from the from from verse 32 my
[50:04] subject you shall know the truth and the
[50:08] truth shall make you free
[50:11] hallelujah I'm glad I'm glad that
[50:13] there's a jesus promised that you know
[50:15] if jesus promises anything it shall be
[50:17] so so it's not you might know the truth
[50:20] or you might know part of the truth but
[50:22] you shall know the truth and the and the
[50:25] manifestation of knowing truth is you
[50:27] shall be free Amen so now the truth is
[50:30] not a coping mechanism to cope with the
[50:33] devil and his devices it's not be
[50:35] something a crutch to get through life
[50:37] no we have Liberty and in the saints of
[50:40] God the Bride of Christ has full Liberty
[50:42] I mean we are not here to put up with a
[50:45] devil part time no we're here to be free
[50:48] indeed hallelujah whom the Sun has set
[50:50] free is free indeed
[50:52] and I am very convinced that the Sun the
[50:55] Word of God is present to make us free
[50:57] indeed we're not here to be stuck up
[51:00] with the devil half the time and God
[51:02] half the time now we're free maybe we're
[51:05] God's property we belong to him we don't
[51:07] belong to Satan or his devices
[51:10] hallelujah
[51:11] so we shall know the truth and the truth
[51:14] shall make us free the purpose of the
[51:17] truth is to make us free from the devil
[51:19] that's the purpose of the truth now this
[51:24] isn't verse 31 if you continue in my
[51:27] word then you are my disciples indeed
[51:29] now to continue it's a verb it means to
[51:33] stay in a given place a state relation
[51:37] or expert expectancy to abide to
[51:42] continue to dwell to endure to be
[51:45] present to remain to stand to tarry you
[51:48] to continue in his word and if you can
[51:51] when you lose worth then you are his
[51:52] disciple and you shall know the truth
[51:54] and the truth shall make you free
[51:56] hallelujah so we're going to continue in
[51:58] his word not just start and then get off
[52:00] and someone's idea because if you get
[52:02] off on someone's idea you won't be free
[52:04] if you continue in his word you shall
[52:06] know the truth and the truth shall make
[52:09] you free now the truth is not relative
[52:12] it's not relative to the day or you know
[52:15] time has changed societies change
[52:17] therefore the truth changes the truth
[52:19] doesn't change it's not relative to
[52:22] anything around us that you know man is
[52:25] still actually the same you know
[52:27] civilization may change culture may
[52:29] change but man is still the core of them
[52:32] are still the same and God does not
[52:34] change the truth is not just a
[52:38] collection of ideas that are correct
[52:40] it's not just it's more than that now
[52:45] you say well and I just want to drop
[52:49] this in here what is alive a lie is the
[52:53] truth perverted a lie can carry a lot of
[52:57] truth you take the serpent speaking to
[53:00] even the garden
[53:01] yay hath God said he preached a lot of
[53:05] truth to to Eve to the woman but it was
[53:09] a lie because it was that it was that
[53:11] little bit that he injected that caused
[53:14] death to come into the world send to
[53:15] come into the world so a lie will make
[53:19] you bound the truth will set you free
[53:22] mostly truth will bind you just like Eve
[53:27] got back she was free she was living
[53:29] eternal being there's no sickness or
[53:31] pain death nothing to hold her down but
[53:34] in the devil gave a mostly truth and the
[53:38] outcome of that statement was sin and
[53:40] was death so you going to look at what
[53:43] does it produce what does the product
[53:45] produce people bring out all kinds of
[53:48] health drinks and health medications
[53:49] thing well what does it actually produce
[53:51] people can make a lot of claims but the
[53:53] proof of the pudding is the eating their
[53:55] off and what I mean by that is what
[53:57] result you get out of it is the proof of
[53:59] it works or doesn't work I mean if it
[54:02] works it
[54:03] works hallelujah this message work for
[54:07] the kingdom I've experienced it I'm free
[54:10] and I'm still free hallelujah you got a
[54:15] look at so be that what does a lie he
[54:18] says it is the truth perverted somebody
[54:21] said it was Saturday night 9 o'clock yet
[54:23] Bill Brandon was and Jeff ins a vote
[54:25] this is correct down at Anthony's saloon
[54:28] drunk alive what was it I was in
[54:30] Jeffersonville that's true I was it was
[54:33] the righteousness perverted to a lie see
[54:35] what I mean see a lie provide it's
[54:38] something that told where I was at now
[54:42] if I see it at the church preaching
[54:43] correct that's righteousness he told the
[54:46] truth at the tavern drinking alive right
[54:50] so the there's choice given was alive
[54:53] that makes it a perverted truth yes
[54:55] perverted truth will not free of people
[54:58] amen as I said the truth is not just a
[55:02] collection of ideas that are correct
[55:04] it's beyond that the truth is actually a
[55:08] person jesus said unto him I am the way
[55:14] the truth and the life no man cometh
[55:17] unto the father but by me so it goes
[55:20] beyond the collection of ideas is this
[55:22] right is this right yes well that's
[55:23] truth now the truth is a person truth is
[55:26] God God is truth right and then and then
[55:30] John 1:14 in the Word was made flesh and
[55:32] dwelt among us and we beheld his glory
[55:35] the glory as of the only begotten of the
[55:37] Father full of grace and truth it means
[55:40] for the truth is the person so when
[55:42] Jesus said and you shall know the truth
[55:44] he's saying you shall know me and I will
[55:47] make you free hallelujah and there's no
[55:50] power greater than our God and then he
[55:52] went down to hell strip the keys of
[55:54] health in the grave of Satan a man
[55:56] ascended on high hallelujah he defeated
[55:59] he defeated death he defeated sickness
[56:02] he defeated unbelief he defeated every
[56:04] kind of devil he conquered everything he
[56:07] conquered it all
[56:08] places like people playing computer
[56:10] games he said well like luck the game
[56:12] hallelujah he clocked everything he
[56:15] completed the highest level hallelujah
[56:18] he conquered all and he's still the
[56:20] mighty Conqueror and he wants us to be
[56:23] free hallelujah truth is a person that
[56:28] person is Jesus Christ the Living Word
[56:30] more than words on print anyone can
[56:32] quote the scripture but what is it
[56:34] produced I mean he's a living God and
[56:37] I'll say this in a fee if if the truth
[56:40] is a person which is the truth became
[56:42] flesh and dwelt among us the truth heals
[56:44] I was gonna say the truth healed because
[56:47] he read the Gospels he did but it but
[56:49] he's still the present God so the truth
[56:51] heals the truth casts out Devils the
[56:54] truth went to Calvary the truth took our
[56:57] sins upon himself the truth came out of
[57:00] the tomb the truth came down there Peter
[57:02] come the truth met Paul on the road to
[57:05] Damascus hallelujah
[57:07] and the truth I pray and I trust has got
[57:10] ahold of you
[57:11] amen that he came down when we when you
[57:14] are not looking for him the truth found
[57:16] you and the truth set you free holy the
[57:19] truth reveal themselves to you I'm in
[57:21] the another servant of sin anymore your
[57:24] your love prisoners of Jesus Christ
[57:26] hallelujah I mean in the truth shall
[57:30] make you free and here in the Sun is set
[57:32] free is free indeed hallelujah we don't
[57:36] have to put up with a devil raging
[57:38] against us
[57:39] amen my battles they can come to an end
[57:42] they should come to an end demon not
[57:45] just position but oppression kick it out
[57:47] you don't have to put up with a devil
[57:49] warring against you makes me feel down
[57:51] and we're in with drunk it costs it up
[57:53] the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us
[57:56] from all these things amen I believe it
[58:01] the truth sets people free and the truth
[58:05] still sets people free yes no all the
[58:10] Bible is true yeah all the Bible is true
[58:13] but it's the truth and the season that
[58:16] is important right brother Brown gives a
[58:19] very simple illustration what would good
[58:21] Moses come
[58:22] preaching knows message let's build an
[58:25] ark well it was a different season what
[58:27] Noah did was truth the ark was true it
[58:30] was true the flood you know the rain
[58:32] came and the flood happened but now
[58:34] Moses was living a different season yes
[58:36] what good was what good was Moses to
[58:39] preach Noah's message because it was now
[58:41] a different season but still true right
[58:43] I mean what good was John the Baptist to
[58:46] preach Moses message because John the
[58:49] Baptist ministry was to turn the hearts
[58:51] of the fathers to the children to turn
[58:54] them away from the traditions of the
[58:55] Pharisees and scribes in the Old
[58:57] Testament to turn the hosta there and
[58:59] see the Living God right so what was
[59:02] good would he be to say now let's
[59:04] restore the priesthood he was in
[59:06] introducing the everlasting priesthood
[59:08] hallelujah Melchizedek himself becoming
[59:11] flesh a real high priest and you can go
[59:14] down all through so now what's good me
[59:17] standing here preaching those message to
[59:19] you it's true what could be preaching
[59:22] Moses message to you it's true but we're
[59:25] in a different season the Apostle Peter
[59:29] said this wherefore I will not be
[59:31] negligent to put you always in
[59:32] remembrance of these things that you
[59:34] know them and be established in present
[59:37] truth we need to be established and
[59:40] present truth because present truth is
[59:43] where God is manifesting himself and
[59:46] where God is manifesting himself that is
[59:48] the truth
[59:49] manifesting and if the truth is
[59:51] manifesting then he heals then he
[59:54] delivers I mean then he you know sets us
[59:57] free he forgives sins hallelujah
[1:00:00] everything that Jesus purchased on
[1:00:02] Calvary has manifested through the truth
[1:00:06] so we want to be established in present
[1:00:09] truth now the truth the truth is
[1:00:14] vindicated and when I now this is my
[1:00:17] this is the being blind dictionary
[1:00:19] definition of vindication I'll say
[1:00:21] divine vindication when God comes in and
[1:00:25] he says this is me speaking that's
[1:00:28] vindication I mean it goes beyond human
[1:00:30] argument goes beyond he should see said
[1:00:33] he did that when God comes in
[1:00:35] and you take a perfect example of Korah
[1:00:38] Dathan against Moses they rose up
[1:00:40] against Moses they said you think you're
[1:00:42] the only holy one God doesn't only speak
[1:00:44] through you and then Moses is okay what
[1:00:46] we're gonna see who's actually speaking
[1:00:49] for God and if God opens up the earth
[1:00:51] swallows you up then you'll know and
[1:00:54] then God came in it's one thing for a
[1:00:56] man to say something now for God to come
[1:00:58] in behind and back up who is actually
[1:01:01] speaking and then what happened the
[1:01:03] earth swallowed them up it was done I
[1:01:04] believe I think that as a vindication
[1:01:08] God was with Moses because God came in
[1:01:11] behind what that man said when he
[1:01:13] stomped into Pharaoh's Palace he let my
[1:01:15] people go
[1:01:16] I mean God began to vindicate to prove
[1:01:20] the Pharaoh was too proud his heart
[1:01:23] became hotter and hotter and hotter we
[1:01:25] know where he was raised up for that
[1:01:26] purpose but he feels just neutral he
[1:01:28] could essentially said well now this is
[1:01:31] actually their God doing this right I
[1:01:33] don't want to fight against this one oh
[1:01:34] my you can go if he had half a brain
[1:01:38] cell he would have said that half a
[1:01:40] spiritual brain cell but he didn't it
[1:01:43] goes beyond argument of two opposing
[1:01:44] views God comes and behind it and proves
[1:01:47] it then Jesus spake again unto them and
[1:01:51] we're in John eight again saying I am
[1:01:53] the light of the world he that followeth
[1:01:55] me shall not walk in darkness but shall
[1:01:57] have the light of Life
[1:01:59] holy I'm glad we're not walking in
[1:02:01] darkness and fear the Pharisees
[1:02:03] therefore said unto Him thou barest
[1:02:05] record of myself though recorders not
[1:02:08] true jesus answered and said unto them
[1:02:11] though I be a record of myself yet my
[1:02:13] record is true for our know whence I
[1:02:16] came and whither I go but you cannot
[1:02:18] tell whence I come and whether I go ye
[1:02:22] judge after the flesh I judge no man and
[1:02:25] yet if I judge my judgment is true for
[1:02:27] I'm not alone I am the father that sent
[1:02:30] me has also written in your law that the
[1:02:33] testimony of two men is true I am one
[1:02:35] that bears witness of myself and the
[1:02:38] father sent me birth witness of me
[1:02:40] amen well how did that how did that
[1:02:44] happen Jesus spoke something and it
[1:02:46] happened
[1:02:47] well he calmed the storm Jesus said it's
[1:02:50] not me that doeth the works as the
[1:02:51] father dwells in me he doeth the works
[1:02:53] see saying that God came in right and
[1:02:56] backed up what he was saying hallelujah
[1:03:00] and I say the sale it's just jumped down
[1:03:03] to 2018 right the Bride of Christ has a
[1:03:08] witness God backs her up
[1:03:11] it goes beyond man's discussion amount
[1:03:13] argument with God comes down produces a
[1:03:16] life and the people that's God saying
[1:03:18] this is what my Bible produces this is
[1:03:20] what my word produces amen by their
[1:03:24] fruits you shall know them by the life
[1:03:25] that is living out of them that's how
[1:03:27] you'll know what they are
[1:03:29] hallelujah and ye shall know the truth
[1:03:31] and the truth shall make you free and
[1:03:34] that will be manifested in their life
[1:03:35] because they're free hallelujah I mean
[1:03:40] that's exactly right I don't fear it's
[1:03:43] one that bears witness of me that's the
[1:03:46] father you should be able to say the
[1:03:48] same thing it's one the best witness of
[1:03:50] my life that's my father in heaven
[1:03:52] he comes in and confirms what I'm doing
[1:03:55] to be true amen
[1:03:57] you had a look at the life you're
[1:03:59] manifesting jesus said in john 5:39 I
[1:04:03] don't have this on the PowerPoint search
[1:04:05] the Scriptures for in them you think you
[1:04:07] have eternal life and they are that
[1:04:09] which testify of me
[1:04:11] the very word they are claiming to
[1:04:13] search they're testifying of who Jesus
[1:04:15] was and it's the same thing today
[1:04:18] the Scriptures testify through the
[1:04:19] brightest in this our true John 14 10
[1:04:23] see it's believeth doubt not that I'm in
[1:04:25] the father and the father and me the
[1:04:27] words that I speak unto you I speak not
[1:04:29] of myself but the father that dwelleth
[1:04:31] in me he doeth the works believe me that
[1:04:35] I'm in the father and the father in me
[1:04:36] or else believe me for the very works
[1:04:39] sake so if you can't take what the word
[1:04:41] spoken he's basically saying just look
[1:04:43] the life that's manifested and believe
[1:04:45] the works they testify of Who I am
[1:04:48] hallelujah that is truth when God comes
[1:04:52] down supernational Eve indicates his
[1:04:54] word you gotta say that's true God
[1:04:57] saying that's me right and
[1:05:00] and the lettuce in church age as as
[1:05:03] Jesus is declaring himself he says the
[1:05:07] faithful and true witness is speaking to
[1:05:10] you right Jesus himself is saying I'm
[1:05:12] the faithful and true witness so he's
[1:05:15] there he's declaring that he is faithful
[1:05:16] and true and if he is a faithful and
[1:05:20] true witness he will back up his
[1:05:21] Scripture right he will manifest why the
[1:05:24] scripture says what happened in this day
[1:05:27] now I'm going to read this from works
[1:05:29] his faith expressed but now remember
[1:05:33] keep this in mind you got to go you got
[1:05:35] to take yourself back 2,000 years ago
[1:05:37] when Jesus was there a lot of people
[1:05:39] said a lot of things about him but what
[1:05:41] was the life he was living what did that
[1:05:43] declare because that should be your
[1:05:45] argument right what life was manifesting
[1:05:48] out of his life what was he producing
[1:05:51] amen you got to take that that's the
[1:05:53] truth right that you'd say no that's
[1:05:56] true John the Baptist
[1:05:58] they called him a wild man but what life
[1:06:01] was he living he was fulfilling the
[1:06:03] scripture for his day it was true yes
[1:06:07] but if it is taking place didn't believe
[1:06:09] that it's him and that day the Son of
[1:06:11] Man will be revealed amen the Son of Man
[1:06:13] will be revealed in a body of flesh you
[1:06:16] people the church just exactly like it
[1:06:19] was before the days of Sodom right a
[1:06:21] called out group away from all them
[1:06:23] sitting out believing the promise of God
[1:06:25] glory then the works of the Holy Spirit
[1:06:27] is doomed to think by these visions
[1:06:29] never-failing promises never failing all
[1:06:31] the Apostolic Science promised in the
[1:06:33] Bible of Malachi 4 no revelations 10 7
[1:06:36] and all that's being fulfilled and
[1:06:37] proved by scientific every other way and
[1:06:40] if I haven't told you the truth these
[1:06:42] things would not happen but if I've told
[1:06:44] you the truth they bear record that I've
[1:06:46] told you the truth he's still the same
[1:06:48] yesterday today and forever and the
[1:06:50] manifestation of the Spirit is catching
[1:06:53] away a brain let that faith revelation
[1:06:55] fall into your heart this is the hour
[1:06:57] now now let us pray he says did God who
[1:07:00] was manifested in the flesh and the
[1:07:02] person of Jesus Christ that raised up
[1:07:04] from the dead on the third day according
[1:07:05] to the scriptures and it seemed it on
[1:07:07] high and sent the disciples out to
[1:07:10] disciple all the world he said these
[1:07:11] signs shall follow them that
[1:07:13] brought to the Pentecostal church of
[1:07:15] this day the restoration of the gifts
[1:07:17] may God Lord these men may be some of
[1:07:20] them prison here some of them hearing
[1:07:21] the tape around the world may they
[1:07:23] realize that this is the calling out of
[1:07:24] the bride not a Pentecostal age the
[1:07:27] Pentecostal message was to restore the
[1:07:29] gifts back to the church but this is the
[1:07:30] calling forth of the bride and other
[1:07:32] message that was to come just before
[1:07:34] Sodom was to be burned let them
[1:07:36] understand their God faith I believe
[1:07:37] this because it's revealed by your
[1:07:39] spirit through the Word of God and has
[1:07:41] been vindicated and made manifest to the
[1:07:43] whole world
[1:07:44] he always has done it he never changes
[1:07:47] his pattern seeing the Prophet could
[1:07:49] only speak if he's true what God tells
[1:07:51] him is that right that's true now do you
[1:07:53] believe him he could tell me what's the
[1:07:56] matter with this woman before I even
[1:07:58] look at her do you believe it why is she
[1:07:59] suffering with cancer that's right it's
[1:08:01] on her breast she's got to blow on her
[1:08:03] mind he's suffering with a kind of a
[1:08:05] mental condition nervous condition and
[1:08:06] complications that's right you believe
[1:08:08] that and that's true isn't it you
[1:08:11] believe now that your faith by saying
[1:08:12] that has anchored that you've got it and
[1:08:14] you're going to have it then go and the
[1:08:16] Lord Jesus will make you well Amen see

[1:12:05] howbeit when he the Spirit of Truth has
[1:12:07] come he will guide you into all truth

[1:12:14] and he will show you things to come he
[1:12:16] shall glorify me for he shall receive of
[1:12:19] mine and will show it unto you so in the
[1:12:22] spirit of truth has come a min to you

[1:12:44] guide you into all truth not just a
[1:12:46] little bit of it but it's all truth
[1:12:49] brother Graham says that by word in 1951
[1:12:53] he says and now God wouldn't let me tell
[1:12:59] you part truth and not rest of it truth
[1:13:01] he wouldn't stand for that God is all
[1:13:04] truth hallelujah now we want to walk in
[1:13:12] all truth I just want to read this here
[1:13:15] now all truth people can take phrases we
[1:13:19] say the church world speaks about being
[1:13:22] born again the evangelical by the church
[1:13:24] world and they believe in the blood
[1:13:26] those terms are true but what is what
[1:13:30] happens when people take phrases then
[1:13:32] you've got to see what does it produce
[1:13:34] right and so now let's read this Jude
[1:13:38] one and three and four beloved I give
[1:13:41] all diligence to write unto you of the
[1:13:43] common salvation it was needful for me
[1:13:45] to write unto you and exhort you that
[1:13:47] you should earnestly contend for the
[1:13:50] faith
[1:13:52] we want to contain full right we want to
[1:13:55] not against I'm just going to go this
[1:13:56] way a little bit
[1:13:57] we're not here to go against we're for
[1:13:59] the faith that was once delivered to the
[1:14:01] Saints try for the faith that delivers
[1:14:03] for the phrase that fills people at the
[1:14:05] Holy Spirit
[1:14:06] well the faith that produces the life in
[1:14:08] Jesus Christ the people for the faith
[1:14:10] that heals for the faith that guides
[1:14:12] people through darkness for the faith
[1:14:14] that comforts for the faith that's hits
[1:14:16] free when contending for that faith holy
[1:14:19] which is Bible faith I mean you'll see
[1:14:21] what you're contending for what product
[1:14:23] are we selling we got eternal life
[1:14:25] hallelujah
[1:14:27] what does eternal life do you shall know
[1:14:30] the truth of the truth shall set you
[1:14:32] free he whom the Sun is set for his
[1:14:34] friend deed Paul II and God can chop you
[1:14:37] free you don't have to be put up with
[1:14:39] the dealers not some Tiger walk let them
[1:14:40] cut the rope walk on with God leave your
[1:14:44] past behind you
[1:14:46] hallelujah well there are certain men
[1:14:49] crept in unawares who were before of old
[1:14:52] ordained to this condemnation ungodly
[1:14:54] men turning the grace of our Lord dot of
[1:14:57] our grace of our God into lasciviousness
[1:14:59] and denying the only Lord God and our
[1:15:03] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:15:04] now what did they do they turned the
[1:15:07] truth they turned it into something else
[1:15:09] right but they all seek but they said oh
[1:15:13] we all believe in grace grace is true
[1:15:16] but they made into something else which
[1:15:18] was false
[1:15:19] all right so turning the grace of our
[1:15:21] God into lasciviousness now let's just
[1:15:24] you know when I I know I've shown this
[1:15:26] to you before but I just prayed last
[1:15:29] night Lord it's us and every soul this
[1:15:31] is what grace really is it's not some
[1:15:34] fluffy idea of looking sin graciousness
[1:15:39] is gratifying this is from the Strong's
[1:15:41] Concordance
[1:15:42] of manual act abstract or concrete
[1:15:44] literal fricative or spiritual
[1:15:46] especially like they would especially
[1:15:48] especially the divine influence upon the
[1:15:52] heart and its reflection in the life
[1:15:55] that is God's grace I mean with is a
[1:15:58] divine influence
[1:16:00] the influence of God the spirit of truth
[1:16:02] comes down upon someone's hot and it
[1:16:05] influences their heart that descends you
[1:16:07] once said you cannot do once love you
[1:16:10] detest holy are the things you would
[1:16:12] never do now you love hallelujah I would
[1:16:16] never be here before I wouldn't be
[1:16:17] interested in a Sunday morning I'd be
[1:16:19] hung over someplace hallelujah I never
[1:16:21] come into a place like this and a divine
[1:16:23] influence came to my heart walk this way
[1:16:28] son go the way you walk the way of life
[1:16:32] and it's reflected in the life that's
[1:16:36] why God says with your lip stage or
[1:16:38] denied to me but their heart is far from
[1:16:39] me
[1:16:40] that's not grace upon someone that's
[1:16:42] just lip service God looks beyond lip
[1:16:44] service he looks at the faith in your
[1:16:47] life because now the life we now live we
[1:16:50] live by the faith of the Son of God
[1:16:52] right I let not faith in the Son of God
[1:16:55] but the faith we live by the faith of
[1:16:58] the son of God God's revelation comes
[1:17:01] into you and now the life you live how

[1:18:23] his mom than his dad who had a club but
[1:18:25] it wasn't as dead
[1:18:26] a three-sided club every time that woman
[1:18:29] would try and get up that man would beat
[1:18:30] her down and then should recover try and
[1:18:34] get back up again he'd take that Club
[1:18:36] beat her down again and he realized
[1:18:39] that's the devil three-sided Club
[1:18:42] Trinitarian doctrine even denying we're
[1:18:45] in there let's go back even denying the
[1:18:51] only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ

[1:19:11] God's here to lift up and I say if you
[1:19:16] may have been beaten down in your past
[1:19:17] don't be a slave to your past we should
[1:19:21] be so gripped by our future will you be
[1:19:23] so gripped I got streets of gold to
[1:19:25] dance on I live in a rapture to take
[1:19:27] that should affect us a lot more than
[1:19:30] our past
[1:19:30] I mean Caleb had a resurrection Mountain
[1:19:34] he wasn't worried about the scars of
[1:19:36] being a slave in Egypt that was done his
[1:19:39] oppressors died in the Red Sea brother
[1:19:42] Liu he is on the way he was gripped by
[1:19:43] words totally wish me gripped by this
[1:19:46] words caretakers in a rapture amen he
[1:19:49] received his inheritance he wasn't a
[1:19:52] slave to us past we should not be a
[1:19:54] slave to our pastor Peter the blood of
[1:19:56] Jesus Christ the path the life that was
[1:19:59] in that blood is in this room hey I mean
[1:20:01] I guarantee you I mean he is here he
[1:20:04] said well I but I've been this way for
[1:20:06] many years Moses was 30 years in the
[1:20:07] wilderness I mean in the desert that's a
[1:20:09] long time
[1:20:10] who's 80 heaney when he 80
[1:20:14] oh yeah worried but you know Eddie is a
[1:20:22] long time he was living 40 years the
[1:20:26] backside the desert with a desire that
[1:20:29] wasn't meat he knew he was the deliverer
[1:20:31] he sent in for that much time I think
[1:20:35] God called him on a burning bush that
[1:20:37] burning bush came God came down and his
[1:20:40] past was gone haleh he delivered there's
[1:20:45] not be a slave to our pass range be a
[1:20:47] slave to your future whatever you do
[1:20:50] they mean especially the divine
[1:20:53] influence upon the heart and its
[1:20:56] reflection in the life that's New
[1:20:57] Testament gross that's the power of the
[1:21:01] Cross to release a divine influence upon
[1:21:04] the heart of the people and it's
[1:21:06] reflected in the life amen now the
[1:21:10] graces as I see it it's a truth phrase
[1:21:13] or saying but what is produced in the
[1:21:16] life is different if this error with
[1:21:20] that now voice wondered what does this
[1:21:23] word lasciviousness it's not common
[1:21:27] Street lingo these days so I looked at
[1:21:31] it and in the Greek let say what see
[1:21:36] this an uncertain driven drivet ization
[1:21:39] but apparently meaning contentment but
[1:21:41] in a negative contentment
[1:21:43] Lyceus nurse sometimes including other
[1:21:46] vices filthy the Sevilla sness
[1:21:48] wantonness now we're just going to and
[1:21:53] so the definition of Lyceus nurse is
[1:21:57] lacking legal or moral restraint
[1:22:00] especially disregarding sexual
[1:22:02] restraints the Cistus behavior marked by
[1:22:07] disregard for strict rules of
[1:22:09] correctness this is part of this word
[1:22:11] lasciviousness right and the definition
[1:22:14] of wantem because wantem this is another
[1:22:16] word for lasciviousness one term means
[1:22:19] merciless and you who main wanton
[1:22:21] cruelty having no just foundation or
[1:22:25] provocation
[1:22:26] right being without chick or limitation
[1:22:31] and Julie lavish playfully mean or cruel
[1:22:38] hard to control undisciplined unruly
[1:22:42] it's also one given to self-indulgent
[1:22:45] flirtation or trifling used especially
[1:22:48] in the phrase to play the wantem a lewd
[1:22:51] or lascivious person a pampered personal
[1:22:54] animal pet especially a spoiled child a
[1:22:57] frolic aresome child or animal that's
[1:23:01] what this word lasciviousness is they
[1:23:03] turn the grace of God into this
[1:23:04] unchecked no just foundation no limits
[1:23:08] right hard to control undisciplined
[1:23:11] unruly so what have they turned it into
[1:23:14] basically they turn it into God is a
[1:23:16] good God you can do what you want you
[1:23:18] see a spoiled child here so let me leave
[1:23:23] me give a let me give a demonstration
[1:23:25] what a spoiled child errs Johnny go
[1:23:30] clean your room
[1:23:35] it's a spoiled child doesn't listen
[1:23:38] doesn't care not interested it's all
[1:23:41] about them that's a sport cha
[1:23:44] so why had he turned the grace of God
[1:23:46] into that they have changed a divine
[1:23:50] influence upon the heart and the
[1:23:51] reflection it's life too basically God's
[1:23:54] grace is so great I can do what I want
[1:23:55] and his word is not important well where
[1:24:00] do they get that idea from that's the
[1:24:03] old serpent preaching again Genesis 3:4
[1:24:06] and the Serpent's II don't woman ye
[1:24:08] shall not surely die so basically saying
[1:24:11] you're God's Word doesn't really have
[1:24:13] that effect it doesn't really matter
[1:24:16] what he says that serpents been
[1:24:18] preaching down through the ages amen
[1:24:22] they go people who have turned to this
[1:24:24] they don't care what the scripture says
[1:24:26] 1st Corinthians 14 37 I said it last
[1:24:28] week I want to say it again if any man
[1:24:30] think himself to be a prophet or
[1:24:31] spiritual let him acknowledge to the
[1:24:33] things that I write unto you are the
[1:24:35] commandments of the Lord that means if
[1:24:37] your spiritual or a prophet you will
[1:24:39] acknowledge that the
[1:24:40] writings of Paul are the writings of God
[1:24:41] and not his ideas his his way of leaning
[1:24:45] the Pharisee background whatever it may
[1:24:47] be it's God speaking it's God's Word
[1:24:50] hallelujah
[1:24:51] and if it is God's Word and grace is
[1:24:53] coming to you I mean then that word will
[1:24:56] become flesh in you amen hallelujah now
[1:25:03] from the from the you know Christianity
[1:25:06] is a life
[1:25:08] Christianity is a life it's not a phrase
[1:25:10] it's not something we say it's a life
[1:25:12] lived its his life in us living right
[1:25:15] it's a life that's limp so if we're free
[1:25:17] that'll be manifested in our lives won't
[1:25:20] be bound by bound by a depression
[1:25:22] oppression guilt you know our past
[1:25:25] whatever it may be
[1:25:26] we're free hallelujah now brother babe
[1:25:31] seizing the token their token today's
[1:25:33] the Holy Ghost he says listen take heed
[1:25:36] we just trample on easy think he's so
[1:25:38] loving a young fellow said the other day
[1:25:41] God loves me so well God is a good dog
[1:25:43] that is true but he's a God of anger -
[1:25:46] he's a God of judgment he's a god of
[1:25:47] Wrath we fail to get that you make him
[1:25:50] so good til you make him some old dhoti
[1:25:53] grandpa I mean he's not an old dirty
[1:25:56] grandfather he's God Almighty and it
[1:25:58] doesn't have no grandchildren he has
[1:26:00] sons and daughters of God I mean not
[1:26:02] shook hands and adopted and you must be
[1:26:04] born again
[1:26:05] and the blood applied it's the sons and
[1:26:07] daughters of God not some old soft
[1:26:09] grandfather leaders kids his
[1:26:11] grandchildren give by with anything he's
[1:26:13] not a grandfather he's a father yes sir
[1:26:16] every child must be born of him and he's
[1:26:18] a father of Correction and when he
[1:26:20] corrects he has our best interest in
[1:26:22] mind he's not cruel Brady has our best
[1:26:25] interest in mind and the problem is
[1:26:27] people do not understand God's love they
[1:26:31] think people think and Israel thought
[1:26:34] that God's love should be like a love I
[1:26:37] like parental care where a parent does
[1:26:40] not want their children to get into any
[1:26:42] trouble do you want to see your children
[1:26:44] get hurt I'm glad I didn't hear an Amen
[1:26:48] otherwise we'll have pray straight away
[1:26:52] but God is not like that you say well
[1:26:55] how's it so I'll just read this now the
[1:26:58] Lord God Almighty says I know
[1:27:00] there he is walking in the midst of his
[1:27:02] people there he is the chief Shepherd of
[1:27:04] the flock but does he hold back the
[1:27:06] persecution does he seem the tribulation
[1:27:08] no he doesn't he simply says I know your
[1:27:11] tribulation I am not at all unmindful of
[1:27:14] your suffering what a stumbling block
[1:27:16] this is to so many people like Israel
[1:27:19] they wondered if God really loves them
[1:27:22] how can God be just and loving if he
[1:27:25] stands by and watches as people suffer
[1:27:27] that is what they asked in Malachi 1 and
[1:27:30] 1 2 3 the burden of the word of the Lord
[1:27:32] to Israel by Malachi I have loved you
[1:27:35] say the Lord yet you say word has thou
[1:27:37] loved us was not Esau Jacob's brother
[1:27:40] saith the Lord yet I love Jacob and I
[1:27:43] hated Esau and laid his mountains and
[1:27:45] his heritage waste for the dragons of
[1:27:47] the wilderness you see they could not
[1:27:49] figure out God's love they thought that
[1:27:51] love meant no suffering they thought
[1:27:54] that love meant a baby with parental
[1:27:56] care and the same God and the autism is
[1:27:59] the same God in the new and Paul speaks
[1:28:01] about Jacob have I loved Esau have I
[1:28:03] hated and the new you tease me people
[1:28:05] misunderstand it right God's love is an
[1:28:08] election I've chosen you before the
[1:28:10] foundation of the world I chose you
[1:28:12] you've been a you've been predestinated
[1:28:14] and to the adoption of sons hallelujah
[1:28:17] and that's why it's so glorious brother
[1:28:19] Isaac song you chose me hallelujah how
[1:28:22] do I know he loves me because he chose
[1:28:23] me and if he chose me he's called me and
[1:28:26] his Corby's justified me if he's
[1:28:28] testified me he's already glorified me
[1:28:30] who feel a charge to God's elect that's
[1:28:32] probably justified
[1:28:35] romans 8 if you're anywhere I'm going
[1:28:37] hallelujah amen what can separate us
[1:28:40] from the love of God in Christ amen
[1:28:42] persecution tribulation sword famine
[1:28:44] whatever nothing hallelujah amen but
[1:28:51] what God sees that his love was elective
[1:28:53] the proof was love is election that no
[1:28:57] matter what happened his love was proven
[1:28:59] truly by the fact we were chosen unto
[1:29:01] salvation because God has chosen you to
[1:29:03] salvation through sanctification of the
[1:29:06] Spirit and belief of the truth he may
[1:29:09] commit you to death as he did Paul
[1:29:11] wasn't expecting your hallelujah from
[1:29:13] them he may commit you to suffering as
[1:29:16] he did joke that is his prerogative his
[1:29:19] sovereign but it is all with a purpose
[1:29:22] if he did not have a purpose then he
[1:29:24] would be the author of frustration and
[1:29:26] not of peace his purpose is that after
[1:29:29] we have suffered a while we would be
[1:29:30] made perfect established strengthened
[1:29:33] settled hallelujah I mean so after we
[1:29:37] have suffered a while we would be made
[1:29:38] perfect let's be established
[1:29:40] strengthened and settled as job said he
[1:29:43] put strength he put strength in us job
[1:29:46] 23 be in the I mean 6 in the beep oh you
[1:29:49] see he himself suffered he learned
[1:29:51] obedience by the things that he suffered
[1:29:52] he was actually made perfect by the
[1:29:54] things that he suffered Hebrews 5:8 2:9
[1:29:57] though he were a son yet learned he
[1:30:00] obedience by the things which he
[1:30:01] suffered and being made perfect he
[1:30:03] became the author of eternal salvation
[1:30:05] and to all them that obey Him in plain
[1:30:07] language the very character of Jesus was
[1:30:10] perfected by suffering and according to
[1:30:12] Paul he has left his church a measure of
[1:30:15] suffering that they too by their faith
[1:30:17] in God while suffering for him would
[1:30:20] come to a place of perfection he has our
[1:30:25] best interest in mind
[1:30:27] because he has your perfection in mind
[1:30:30] hallelujah
[1:30:31] but why did he want this James 1:2 to
[1:30:35] for my brethren count it all joy when
[1:30:36] you fall into divers temptations knowing
[1:30:39] this that the trying of your faith
[1:30:41] worketh patience but let patience have a
[1:30:43] perfect work that ye may be perfect and
[1:30:46] entire wanting nothing alleluia
[1:30:51] I'm glad for tribulation that's a funny
[1:30:54] thing to say isn't it
[1:30:55] but God God's love as he leadeth
[1:31:00] hallelujah I'm glad he chose me now
[1:31:04] jesus said oops Jesus says in John 15 I
[1:31:12] am the true vine the true vine right so
[1:31:17] if there's a true vine then there has to
[1:31:19] be a false farm but I'm going to talk
[1:31:21] about the false phone talk about the
[1:31:22] truth I am The True Vine and my father
[1:31:25] is the husbandman every branch in me
[1:31:27] that beareth NOT fruit he taketh away
[1:31:29] and every branch that beareth fruit he
[1:31:31] purges it that it may bring forth more
[1:31:34] fruit who feels like they've been
[1:31:36] perched Oh amen now ye are clean through
[1:31:41] the word which I spoken unto you abide
[1:31:44] in me and I in you as the branch cannot
[1:31:46] bear fruit of itself except it abide in
[1:31:48] the vine no more can ye no cat no more
[1:31:52] can ye except ye abide in me so the true
[1:31:57] vine will produce a true life amen
[1:32:02] the Spirit of Truth is the life of the
[1:32:05] truth as I say it's more than a
[1:32:13] collection of ideas it's a person right
[1:32:16] so the Spirit of Truth is the life of
[1:32:17] the truth the fruit produced shows what
[1:32:21] seed that was planted originally now I
[1:32:23] used to work for a lab here in
[1:32:25] Wellington they had a seed lab up in
[1:32:27] Palmerston North and people are trained
[1:32:29] to study seeds see how pure a bunch of
[1:32:33] seeds are Joe crops they so if people
[1:32:35] buy barley they won't barley they don't
[1:32:37] want to have a feel the pumpkins and
[1:32:39] have a feel the valley
[1:32:40] that they bought a kg of barley seeds or
[1:32:43] whatever they want barley
[1:32:44] now to the untrained eye a lot of seeds
[1:32:47] actually look quite similar and the best
[1:32:51] way for us to see and the simplest proof
[1:32:55] is really to plant it and see what's
[1:32:56] made because you may have two very
[1:32:59] similar looking seats but one can be a
[1:33:01] watermelon one can be a turnip I don't
[1:33:02] know you know but could be very two
[1:33:04] different kinds of life but yet it could
[1:33:06] look the same so the fruit produced
[1:33:08] shows what the seed was that was planted

[1:35:26] works of Shakespeare because I couldn't
[1:35:28] help it I'm no more myself I'm did
[1:35:31] Shakespeare and I can't live together in
[1:35:33] here Shakespeare was a poet I'm a
[1:35:35] minister we can't live together but if I
[1:35:37] am did to myself then and Shakespeare
[1:35:40] lives in me the works of Shakespeare
[1:35:41] I'll do the life of Shakespeare in me
[1:35:44] will be lived out like Shakespeare if
[1:35:46] the life of Beethoven's was in me I'd be
[1:35:48] like Beethoven right if the life of John
[1:35:51] Dillinger was in me I'd be John
[1:35:53] Dillinger that's right and if the life
[1:35:55] of Jesus Christ lives in the person they
[1:35:57] become identified with him its Christ in
[1:36:00] you not a church member not a system but
[1:36:03] a resurrected power hallelujah not a not
[1:36:06] a church system not a church man but a

[1:36:35] Christ is in you the works that was in
[1:36:37] crisis in you Christ himself as in you
[1:36:39] you're dead your life was hid in God
[1:36:41] through Christ sealed there by the Holy
[1:36:43] Ghost you're not your own he was not
[1:36:46] responsible for anybody the whole family
[1:36:48] must be brought into and the token must
[1:36:50] be displayed it had to be if it wasn't
[1:36:52] displayed then there was of none effect
[1:36:54] you could believe in it you could say
[1:36:57] yes I believe it but that didn't do it
[1:36:59] well I'll tell you what I'll do I'll put
[1:37:01] it in a bucket I'll sit it over here
[1:37:03] against the wall but really I think as
[1:37:05] long as I have it here if I have the
[1:37:07] blood
[1:37:08] over here he says no sir you can't be a
[1:37:11] secret boy about it
[1:37:12] no sir you've got to have it you've got
[1:37:15] to have it on display so it's no good
[1:37:17] just saying I believe in the Holy Ghost
[1:37:19] it's got to be in you living out I mean
[1:37:22] the life that was on Calvary that came
[1:37:24] out of the body of Jesus the blood cell
[1:37:26] was broken his life was released has to
[1:37:28] come into a people that's whatever they
[1:37:30] have Pentecost the life that was in him
[1:37:32] was released and it came into 120
[1:37:35] hallelujah and they weren't themselves
[1:37:37] anymore
[1:37:38] God was in them God was manifesting in
[1:37:40] them the life they now lived they lived
[1:37:41] by the faith of the Son of God
[1:37:43] hallelujah and it's the same thing today
[1:37:47] he was that true token shows us that he
[1:37:51] never that he ever never will fail to
[1:37:53] honor his tokens if Jesus don't come for
[1:37:55] 10,000 years
[1:37:56] you have the token he's still got to
[1:37:58] honor it no matter how many things
[1:38:00] changes whatever more he's got to honor
[1:38:02] that token he said God would all right
[1:38:05] weeks we expect us now to display his
[1:38:09] token over our god-given faith he says
[1:38:12] to every unbelieving cult in the nation
[1:38:14] in the world that believes that signs
[1:38:15] and wonders don't follow the believers
[1:38:17] and be true to this token it shows that
[1:38:19] the fear has been paid and you've been
[1:38:21] accepted for the resurrection that the
[1:38:24] token life inside of us he says that's a
[1:38:26] cutting message Bruce the truth that's
[1:38:27] what we need is truth god help us to
[1:38:30] know truth you shall know the truth of
[1:38:32] the truth shall make you free I claim
[1:38:34] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[1:38:35] today and forever
[1:38:36] I believe that God gives the Holy Ghost
[1:38:38] as a token right now just before the
[1:38:41] exodus of the bride going out of the
[1:38:43] church hallelujah and I believe the same
[1:38:45] thing I mean if the life of Shakespeare
[1:38:48] was in me I'd be sure this is more than
[1:38:49] a quote you're to think about it if the
[1:38:51] life of a Pharisee was into me I'd be a
[1:38:53] Pharisee at the life of the Spirit that
[1:38:55] were in Legion would be I'd be in the
[1:38:57] tomb right right at the life of Jesus
[1:39:00] Christ with me I do the works of Jesus
[1:39:02] Christ hallelujah it's not me living
[1:39:04] anymore attend ye shall know the truth

[1:41:02] likewise took on the same the speaking
[1:41:04] of our Lord Jesus there through death he
[1:41:06] might destroy him that had the power of
[1:41:08] death that is the devil and deliver them
[1:41:10] who through the fear of death were all
[1:41:12] their lifetime subject to bondage for
[1:41:15] verily he took not on him the nature of
[1:41:17] angels but he took on him the seed of
[1:41:20] Abraham this is why he came to destroy
[1:41:23] the works of the devil there are people
[1:41:25] who were bound by fear
[1:41:27] fear of death would be liberated
[1:41:30] hallelujah this was this was his purpose

[1:42:37] and this would and the point of this was
[1:42:40] to destroy him that had the power of
[1:42:43] death that is the devil now God isn't
[1:42:47] just wasn't just manifested in Jesus
[1:42:49] right God was manifested in 120 in the
[1:42:52] upper room all the way down through the
[1:42:54] New Testament era God was manifested God
[1:42:57] came in the flesh to destroy the works
[1:43:00] of the devil right God put his body upon
[1:43:04] the earth and he used that body to
[1:43:06] destroy the works of the devil are you

[1:43:31] says in Ephesians 2 yo you once walked
[1:43:34] according to the spirit of the world the
[1:43:36] Prince of the power of the air you once
[1:43:38] walked according to him the devil the
[1:43:40] devil was
[1:43:41] the throne of your heart once upon a
[1:43:42] time you were born that way the devil
[1:43:45] was in control of your life you're a
[1:43:47] slave to him a slave doesn't enjoy being
[1:43:49] a slave as many times
[1:43:50] well I remember from my passos you know
[1:43:52] I'm never doing that again and like a
[1:43:54] pig to its wallow dog to its moment you
[1:43:56] jump back in because he's a nature and
[1:43:59] you have a pig or a dog the thing you
[1:44:00] puked out that you know made you vomit
[1:44:02] you began to eat that thing up like why
[1:44:06] you know you see a dog do that kind of
[1:44:08] thing you think why would you do that
[1:44:10] it's because they're a scavenger they
[1:44:13] are predators but they'll eat whatever
[1:44:14] they can eat amen
[1:44:16] we had a Labrador growing up in Gisborne
[1:44:18] we were there at the beach and a man was
[1:44:21] sitting up hooks to go fishing he just
[1:44:24] he jumped up the bait he had these fish
[1:44:27] hanging over his mouth why because he's
[1:44:29] a scavenger he's looking for food
[1:44:32] you think why would you do that and then
[1:44:35] there's vomit then they eat the vomit
[1:44:36] you think well why would you do it the
[1:44:37] thing that made you sick you try and eat
[1:44:39] it again why would you do such a thing
[1:44:41] it's cuz it's part of their nature you
[1:44:43] can't help it now God doesn't reform us
[1:44:45] he doesn't patch us up and this is not
[1:44:48] seven steps to maybe overcoming maybe
[1:44:50] not it's not that it's transforming
[1:44:53] power and then where God makes us new
[1:44:55] creatures and then when you creation
[1:44:57] we're not a pet separation we're a new
[1:44:59] creation
[1:45:00] Tolu that we are new people I mean
[1:45:02] that's why Paul said the life I now Luke
[1:45:05] he never used to live that come up with
[1:45:07] life I now live I live by the faith of
[1:45:09] the Son of God he lived by the faith of
[1:45:11] us a Pharisee intellectual conception he
[1:45:13] didn't live their faith anymore he
[1:45:15] didn't live that life anymore he was new
[1:45:18] that's how it should be this is not a
[1:45:20] patch-up center I mean the church is not
[1:45:23] here just to patch you up and put you in
[1:45:24] a ward someplace this place is to heal
[1:45:27] and restore whole ouya and redeemed
[1:45:30] that's why God's furnace here to heal
[1:45:33] and to restore intervene
[1:45:35] well that's what the trenches to do hey
[1:45:37] you may have to sit in the bed for a
[1:45:38] while this thought you know this is not
[1:45:39] palliative care there's not a place of
[1:45:42] palliative care this is a place of of
[1:45:45] transformation once coming crippled and
[1:45:48] sick and near spiritually dying
[1:45:49] I mean God takes his word I mean shucks
[1:45:52] your heart to life how do I come back to
[1:45:55] yourself my hair I'm alive I nearly died
[1:45:58] how did I get here I don't know but I'm
[1:45:59] living Chucky's back to life
[1:46:07] I thank God for a mighty angel
[1:46:09] descending I thank God for coming down
[1:46:11] among us earlier you shall know the
[1:46:13] truth the truth of the pressure he's not
[1:46:16] some abstract idea he's a living beating
[1:46:18] hallelujah amen so God comes down he
[1:46:23] manifests himself in your flesh that the
[1:46:25] power of the works are destroyed the
[1:46:28] power of the devil is destroyed rather
[1:46:29] and now we're free and then now here you
[1:46:32] are he says have I've been since I
[1:46:34] sinned are you oh yeah so now you've got
[1:46:38] a job you've got a commission you've got
[1:46:40] a commission go into all the world
[1:46:43] preach the gospel you say well I'm not a
[1:46:45] preacher live it live this word that
[1:46:48] when people see you they read Peter
[1:46:50] James and John they read the Gospels
[1:46:52] they read the book of Hebrews they read
[1:46:53] the book of Revelation and then they
[1:46:55] read the book of Ruth the book of Esther
[1:46:57] polio they read all those they read the
[1:47:00] scripture they read the Psalms I see it
[1:47:02] in you hallelujah
[1:47:04] go into all the world live this word
[1:47:07] cast out the devil wherever you'll find
[1:47:09] him divine love is stronger than any
[1:47:11] work of the enemy the enemy is defeated
[1:47:16] that damned Calvary was he defeated
[1:47:19] could the grave hold our Lord could he
[1:47:22] hold him could those soldiers could the
[1:47:25] earth will seal the term up oh that's a
[1:47:27] good idea so I think it's insanity
[1:47:31] I just think of Lazarus four days in the
[1:47:34] grave Lazarus come forth and if he
[1:47:37] didn't say that Jesus and said that word
[1:47:38] Lazarus it would have been a January's
[1:47:39] erection because this is I am the
[1:47:41] resurrection and the life and then here
[1:47:43] comes Lazarus out of the tomb and then
[1:47:45] the scribes and Pharisees they say we
[1:47:47] have to kill him
[1:47:48] cause those testimonies making people
[1:47:51] believe that's insanity
[1:47:58] but that's how people are
[1:48:00] again the soldiers they seal the tomb up
[1:48:02] then they begin to you know no doubt the
[1:48:06] high priests and the Pharisees like
[1:48:08] that's the last we see of this Jesus of
[1:48:09] Nazareth that's all done how how wrong
[1:48:12] they were oh we need a center it mean to
[1:48:15] seal this thing oh yeah they'll keep
[1:48:17] them good luck devil then here the
[1:48:21] soldiers we have to stop this one coming
[1:48:24] what are our orders sir keep this body
[1:48:28] in this tomb why is here an army gonna
[1:48:30] come there's a lot of us here oh no
[1:48:33] these these disciples how are they with
[1:48:36] their swords well one one tried to kill
[1:48:37] a guy the only manage to cut his ear off
[1:48:39] what's their background fishermen tax
[1:48:43] collectors what do you mean guys with
[1:48:44] office jobs you know are they physically
[1:48:46] strong woman at the well you may find a
[1:48:50] bunch of woman sir yes sir
[1:48:53] we're gonna guard this thing God the
[1:48:57] devil can't stop God's life he's a God
[1:49:00] is unstoppable nothing can stop him and
[1:49:05] there and they're there guarding and in
[1:49:07] first day nothing you're on the lookout
[1:49:11] second day nothing did looking at the
[1:49:13] wrong thing because Angel Lord is gonna
[1:49:15] deceive they should have been looking up
[1:49:17] oh yeah and then God comes down there's
[1:49:19] your Lord the Saints they fall over like
[1:49:21] dead men the stone rolls away and then
[1:49:24] he walks out oh yeah oh yeah
[1:49:28] and now brother Bram says what a
[1:49:30] resurrection that was and but then he
[1:49:33] says well the resurrection this is where
[1:49:35] our people who once dead in trespasses
[1:49:37] and sins have come alive other that
[1:49:40] they're living people I mean it's like
[1:49:42] this world tried to put you in a tomb
[1:49:44] tomb of religion tomb of the world tomb
[1:49:47] in your mind of reason whatever ball do
[1:49:49] you think the devil could keep you there
[1:49:52] he couldn't stop Jesus he couldn't stop
[1:49:55] the disciples he couldn't stop the truth
[1:49:57] through the Dark Ages
[1:49:58] he couldn't stop the Reformation he
[1:50:01] stop though outpouring of Azusa Street
[1:50:02] he couldn't stop the messenger he won't
[1:50:05] stop the bride hallelujah

[1:50:10] hallelujah oh do you feel it all the
[1:50:13] time no I believe it and he confirmed my
[1:50:16] faith Amen it's like abraham believed
[1:50:19] he's given the sign of circumcision to
[1:50:21] prove that he believed we believe god
[1:50:24] cuts off all the excess everything
[1:50:27] that's not part of the problem let's
[1:50:28] just cut away holy he gives us a seal of
[1:50:30] the Holy Ghost
[1:50:31] I need the proof that he's received a
[1:50:33] fake just take him at his word so now
[1:50:41] here we are what is he God's Word which
[1:50:45] destroys the work well at least out from
[1:50:51] them here he says now God's taking from
[1:50:54] there holding out a bunch to make a
[1:50:55] ministry just exactly like the word
[1:50:57] there because it's got to fit with the
[1:50:59] word there's the bride take her up now
[1:51:02] Christ was manifested to destroy the
[1:51:04] works of the devil you believe that now
[1:51:06] I can't explain all this and but he says
[1:51:08] God was manifested to destroy that works
[1:51:10] of the devil amen he says what was God
[1:51:13] God's Word which destroys the works of
[1:51:15] the hybrid the devil is that right he
[1:51:17] was done to do that he was born to do
[1:51:19] that to destroy the works of the devil
[1:51:21] now his body is to do the same because
[1:51:24] the body is the head and the body
[1:51:26] together
[1:51:28] hallelujah the devil couldn't stop and
[1:51:32] then and then I'll just you know the
[1:51:38] devil cannot stop you no weapon formed
[1:51:41] against thee shall prosper you have to
[1:51:44] look you're gonna get a think about it
[1:51:46] what is stopping the Word of God
[1:51:48] manifested in my life what is stopping
[1:51:51] it it would be baptism Holy Ghost coming
[1:51:55] in whatever it may be real salvation
[1:51:57] that's all that brother cadre preaching
[1:51:59] are you saved that's more than just
[1:52:02] giving a confession
[1:52:02] have you been redeemed has his life
[1:52:05] coming to you and manifesting it out
[1:52:07] hallelujah

[1:52:10] manifesting the word it's not God
[1:52:13] there's only two spirit
[1:52:15] is the Christ and the endtime cry
[1:52:17] against this one lives produces life
[1:52:20] this one's against what is stopping you
[1:52:24] manifest me would it's the devil not God
