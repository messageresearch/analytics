[30:30] receptive vessels

[31:08] hands in the wonderful name of our Lord
[31:10] Jesus Christ and the church says amen
[31:12] please have the comfort of your seeds

[31:24] spare you know and a spare wheel is the
[31:26] will that comes when all other four
[31:28] wheels one of them has got a scored a
[31:31] slow Punjab we remove and put it on that
[31:34] one so we're just gonna have a quick uh
[31:37] the word of God is never small but we
[31:40] are just gonna have a snack tonight
[31:41] who's ready for a snake every dessert
[31:45] a dessert so we're gonna have it because
[31:49] on Sunday you had a full meal full meal
[31:53] I really enjoyed myself on Sunday and I
[31:56] heard that sermon on Sunday that it was
[31:58] a continuation of Wednesday I don't know
[32:00] if any of you caught it
[32:02] me I hate it and I went back to the tape
[32:05] to the sermon and I listened I hear the
[32:07] pastor saying oh on Sunday maybe I'll
[32:09] talk about the Rapture I said oh that's
[32:11] why
[32:12] did you get it
[32:14] maybe you missed it but uh
[32:18] let's continue I want us to today also
[32:21] to read that scripture the Thessalonians
[32:25] ye are the children of light the Bible
[32:28] reiterates this yeah
[32:31] and the children of the day you are you
[32:34] are the children of the day right
[32:36] we are not of the night
[32:40] no of Darkness
[32:42] I've always asked myself a question
[32:47] and I've always asked myself a question
[32:50] why God at the beginning when he was
[32:53] creating
[32:54] oh sorry brother Ben I said I was going
[32:57] to start with my testimony I'll reserve
[32:59] it I'll postpone it and I thought I
[33:03] would have received a footage of the of
[33:05] the of the accident so that I could show
[33:07] you pictures but I haven't but I'll I'll
[33:09] just remind me once I get it so that I
[33:12] can give God the glory and the honor but
[33:15] tonight not yet but we want to talk
[33:17] about children of the light which is you
[33:21] I've always wondered why if the if
[33:25] everything that was dark there was
[33:28] nothing there was emptiness only the
[33:30] spirit of the Lord was hovering upon the
[33:34] space
[33:35] why did God start by saying let there be
[33:38] light why didn't God say start by saying
[33:41] oh
[33:42] okay let me start let there be a
[33:44] first
[33:46] why didn't God say okay you know what
[33:48] let there be first um lent I want to
[33:52] land first
[33:54] why didn't God say okay let there be the
[33:57] mass and and all Jupiter first I want
[34:00] those planets first
[34:02] why didn't God said didn't say okay let
[34:04] there be water first
[34:06] God could have done that
[34:08] why
[34:09] so God started by saying in verse three
[34:13] let there be light
[34:17] he is the light
[34:20] you know the song Walking Dead
[34:24] so invest three he says
[34:26] let there be light
[34:28] and there was light
[34:31] and God saw the light
[34:33] the question is what is light maybe
[34:35] let's just take a short description what
[34:37] is exactly what what is light I don't
[34:40] know if this is light this thing I don't
[34:42] know if it's light of course in our
[34:44] human description this is light
[34:46] but I've got some sense to doubt that
[34:49] that is this is a true light system
[34:50] system would
[34:53] why I'm saying this is because look
[34:56] this comes as a result of
[34:59] some science and what we discovered and
[35:02] we connect the wires and we do this okay
[35:04] and we make like but what is the true
[35:07] light
[35:08] nowadays I hear about the end that when
[35:10] they transmit information they use this
[35:13] optic is it fiber fiber wires you know
[35:16] that light travels in those and can
[35:19] transfer information faster and clearer
[35:23] I was reading somewhere they say light
[35:25] is the more light you have the more
[35:29] light comes it's actually the more
[35:32] information you discover
[35:35] the more light you get is the more you
[35:37] the more clearer you see maybe maybe
[35:42] if I bring light more light I'll see
[35:45] things that I was not seeing under this
[35:47] light here
[35:48] because light is so powerful and is so
[35:52] powerful that the more light come
[35:55] you know I always like this sister
[35:57] Naomi's dream
[35:59] she said she was dreaming but I'll just
[36:01] give you a snapshot in that dream the
[36:03] angel of the Lord was coming he forgive
[36:05] me my sister if I'm not I'm paraphrasing
[36:08] if I'm not saying it correctly in that
[36:11] dream when the light of the Lord the
[36:12] angel was coming because she had a
[36:14] burden and the angel she said the closer
[36:17] that light of the of the of the Angel
[36:19] comes closer the clearer she could even
[36:22] see things that she didn't know she
[36:24] could even understand better
[36:27] he didn't need anyone to tell her
[36:29] anything she just understood the clothes
[36:32] that that light came
[36:33] to her
[36:35] the guilty as she this the more sinful
[36:38] and she said no no no
[36:40] because light is so powerful I don't
[36:42] think if this light comes you just bring
[36:45] it here close to me I'll even see him my
[36:48] sins
[36:49] this one yeah yeah that's what I'm
[36:51] saying it's not like
[36:53] but the True Light is Jesus Christ
[36:56] he is the actual True Light he's the
[37:00] light of the
[37:03] and then he says you are the children of
[37:06] the light and I agree with him
[37:08] because everything came out of the light
[37:11] ah everything when he said let there be
[37:14] light you'll see as we go along what
[37:17] happened to that thing
[37:20] someone removed
[37:22] when when he said let there be light and
[37:25] everything came from the light
[37:27] the True Light is the light when when it
[37:30] comes in your life you change yeah when
[37:33] it comes in your life you see you you
[37:35] understand things that other people
[37:37] don't understand that is Jesus Christ
[37:40] himself
[37:42] huh so this is just a maybe this just
[37:46] types the spiritual but it's not it's
[37:48] not the real light
[37:50] yeah have you ever seen a photocopier
[37:52] they know they use light to make a
[37:54] photocopy
[37:56] until they get someone to certify a true
[37:59] copy light just goes and on paper and
[38:02] burn in bed light
[38:04] they use light to do thorough operations
[38:08] you know in a surgery room they use
[38:10] light
[38:11] is so it's so Sarah
[38:13] so precise is light
[38:16] that
[38:18] when they operate you it can cut you
[38:22] know carefully and clear they use it so
[38:26] what what is like then
[38:29] um
[38:29] what is light
[38:31] so light
[38:33] I don't know how to describe it but
[38:35] you'll see as we go along you'll hear
[38:37] what the prophet says now having said
[38:40] that you are the children of the light
[38:42] are we agreeing that we are all children
[38:44] of the light in other words we are the
[38:47] light are we together
[38:49] the issue is this
[38:51] we need to come to the point of
[38:54] getting back to where we used to be from
[38:57] the beginning and that process is called
[39:00] to be born again
[39:04] because you'll see you you you were here
[39:08] right then something happens in the
[39:10] process then you are now here but you
[39:13] need to get back to where you were
[39:15] before that process is called to be born
[39:18] again
[39:20] because you you want to go back to where
[39:23] you were your original state
[39:26] okay you'll follow me now
[39:28] you'll follow me this is now what the
[39:31] prophet explains to us that at the
[39:32] beginning or even before the beginning
[39:34] there was this thing called this great
[39:36] thing not I don't want to say time that
[39:39] was before time it's called eternity you
[39:42] can think of it as a great big circle
[39:43] where there was no time there was no
[39:45] meanness or seconds
[39:47] it was just
[39:48] there
[39:51] so that's why there's no break in that
[39:53] big circle it was just on and on and on
[39:57] I can't even say on and on because on
[39:59] starts somewhere
[40:02] it was just
[40:05] a big circle you can't even say
[40:07] clockwise because clockwise is clockwise
[40:10] is that you know
[40:12] it's time that was eternity
[40:15] it was it's something that you cannot
[40:17] imagine how how really it functioned it
[40:21] was there the Bible says there was
[40:23] nothing only the spirit of God
[40:26] was sitting
[40:28] right
[40:30] but in the process
[40:32] God wanted to think
[40:34] he started to think
[40:37] and then he said okay
[40:40] there are things inside me that I need
[40:43] to bring out
[40:44] yeah when he thought in that process of
[40:48] thinking
[40:49] you came
[40:51] you came
[40:53] he thought about Andy he thought about
[40:56] sister Maggie he thought about brother
[40:58] Jimmy sister Christine's sister Jenny
[41:00] sister Naomi and if I don't call you he
[41:03] also thought about you
[41:04] thought about Jesse he thought about
[41:06] Isaac he thought about sister he thought
[41:08] about everyone
[41:10] he thought about you individually listen
[41:16] he said okay I want to be a savior you
[41:18] know the story
[41:19] then he brought this thing called
[41:22] time
[41:25] and then
[41:26] the only thing about time is that it's
[41:28] just a loop from that big thing that we
[41:31] spoke about it's just a little Loop it
[41:34] has got a start
[41:35] and it's gonna finish you know that much
[41:38] you know time has got started and finish
[41:40] even when we say come at what time we've
[41:42] got a meeting from there to there can't
[41:44] have a meeting forever there's a Time
[41:46] Time started at the beginning when God
[41:49] started and it's gonna have an end
[41:51] that's why we say time shall be no more
[41:53] there shall be no more time
[41:56] can you imagine that no more time
[41:58] whatever we think we know we know we
[42:01] think that little yellow Loop
[42:03] who is that pointer
[42:06] like I like to point in teaching so that
[42:10] now that thing called time we are
[42:13] actually us right now maybe there almost
[42:17] at the end of that Arrow just where it
[42:20] points there because it's finishing
[42:22] right we are there at the very
[42:25] right there where it touches eternity
[42:27] that's why thank you Papa time is
[42:30] blending into
[42:32] eternity we are there
[42:33] you see there
[42:35] from the start it moved and now we are
[42:39] there we are just just two minutes
[42:41] Maybe
[42:49] now
[42:50] he created that
[42:52] as as as he started this process here
[42:56] as he started he said let there be light
[42:58] right
[43:00] I'm not saying that is how the light
[43:02] appeared I just I was just looking for a
[43:04] way to describe or to convey a message
[43:07] he said that let there be light
[43:09] and then there was light
[43:13] a man called gigloo he said light came
[43:18] running 386 out of the mouth of God
[43:22] laughs
[43:24] have you ever watched that video of the
[43:26] Indescribable so fascinating
[43:28] because he practicalize it he made you
[43:31] our little little small mind because
[43:33] what happened is that
[43:36] when when we were brought into time
[43:39] we were brought to the lowest form
[43:43] we were brought to the lowest our
[43:46] grandmother
[43:47] helped the devil to bring us to the
[43:50] lowest the slowest slowest form
[43:54] imagine taking
[43:56] 48 hours to travel from here to South
[43:59] Africa
[44:00] that's too slow
[44:04] and that's why we were brought we were
[44:06] brought to just from from
[44:08] paraparaumu to here I must take one hour
[44:11] or 30 minutes
[44:14] and our cars are trying to go fast and
[44:17] our airplane
[44:18] thing but we are still
[44:22] tours cannot take it we were brought to
[44:24] the slowest now in our initial
[44:27] where we were in the mind of God in
[44:30] eternity
[44:31] things were too fast
[44:33] light travels at a very enormous I
[44:37] believe that the word of God even
[44:40] travels faster
[44:43] so
[44:44] now we God created it and then that was
[44:48] the beginning okay fine then Light Came
[44:51] and then there it is can you see it I'm
[44:54] not saying that's the one but can you
[44:55] can you can you imagine at the beginning
[44:57] when God created and there was light
[44:59] okay and then over the process of time
[45:01] we have been taught and we have seen
[45:03] this light manifesting itself for us
[45:07] weak human beings to see we who are his
[45:10] children trapped in this flesh to see
[45:13] that oh this is actually us over a
[45:17] period of time God has now showed us and
[45:20] have you ever seen any of those pictures
[45:23] have you ever seen God being
[45:25] photographed
[45:29] the prophet says that's not my picture
[45:31] yeah
[45:33] yeah I just happened to be there yeah
[45:35] it's not my it's not his picture that
[45:38] Halo there
[45:40] imagine light just came
[45:44] right
[45:46] this man here Moses this is supposed to
[45:48] be Moses he saw
[45:51] some form of
[45:52] Fire Light
[45:55] but this one was not Ben it was not
[45:57] consuming the tree
[46:00] he saw it and then and then he looked
[46:03] and then he went and he spoke to the
[46:04] light
[46:06] and the light spoke back to him
[46:08] and Paul that light came and struck him
[46:12] can you see Paul he's there can you see
[46:15] him children who can see Paul what can
[46:18] you say look that that can you see that
[46:20] light
[46:24] when he was underground and he asked
[46:27] questions who are thou Lord
[46:29] how can you say to the light
[46:32] how can you talk to the light I can't
[46:35] just talk to this thing now
[46:37] right
[46:39] now listen to what the brother Brandon
[46:41] says there
[46:42] so now the Bible teaches us that the
[46:44] logos went out of God and I might say
[46:48] all all the the god becoming his first
[46:51] body
[46:53] form when the logos went out of God
[46:56] that was the first visible
[46:59] part of God
[47:01] to us to see to be able to say oh that's
[47:04] the light oh that's air that's this
[47:05] that's this and everything came out of
[47:08] that logos now listen to this the next
[47:10] paragraph
[47:11] but then the logos that went out of him
[47:14] became a little logo Halo of light a
[47:17] little Hollow of light let's see it
[47:20] playing Yonder like a child maybe before
[47:22] the doorstep of the father and now I can
[47:26] see him he moves over there and he draws
[47:28] into his his memory he prepares a plan
[47:31] in his mind
[47:33] in his mind and a it draws a picture of
[47:37] what the world should be
[47:40] shipping
[47:42] how the world you are here as part of
[47:44] this world in flesh right he thought
[47:46] about you
[47:48] how your genes are going to be how
[47:51] you're thinking your hair straight and
[47:53] your everything and your emotions he
[47:55] planned everything to the detail to the
[47:58] Iota to the DOT
[48:00] and the planners can you is unfathomable
[48:03] isn't it
[48:04] now
[48:06] and then
[48:07] and then he says
[48:09] and then he said I'm here him I hear him
[48:12] say Let There Be can you see I hear him
[48:15] say Let There Be what
[48:18] light
[48:20] right
[48:21] and and and an atom broke Yonder and
[48:23] when he did the son came into existence
[48:26] and began to Will
[48:27] she bent for millions and millions of
[48:31] years after a while I see a clinker fly
[48:34] off of it
[48:37] what is it the first star that flew from
[48:40] the sun he watches it fall for a few
[48:43] million years and stop this is time now
[48:45] we are now we are here we are now into
[48:48] that area
[48:50] it's time now all together
[48:53] millions of years is called time
[48:59] now let's go there to the next slide
[49:01] Slide the father covered all the space
[49:03] before time the father covered
[49:05] everything right then he covered
[49:07] everything and then and then this God
[49:10] became body bodilized I like English
[49:16] it became bodilized
[49:19] down to the logos it became a body
[49:23] called logos and I can hear him say let
[49:26] there be light and then atom blah blah
[49:28] blah okay I want to jump quickly to the
[49:30] next paragraph then the logos came down
[49:32] and was made flesh
[49:34] [Music]
[49:34] um
[49:35] when did the logos come in was made
[49:37] flesh
[49:39] am I looking at the logos right now
[49:43] or let's say let me make it softer for
[49:45] you am I looking at part of the logos
[49:47] do you believe that you are part of the
[49:49] logos
[49:50] I believe I'm part of the logos
[49:53] now
[49:55] the cruel in the quality of scene that's
[49:57] that's where I took that sermon there
[49:58] now standing back there again Moses seen
[50:01] him
[50:02] who the logos
[50:04] Moses seen him and he saw the hind part
[50:07] of him
[50:09] and said looked like the back of a man
[50:11] the logos that went from God
[50:16] this is so wonderful isn't it and that
[50:18] is who
[50:20] SE children you are you I'm trying to
[50:23] explain to you
[50:24] to remind you to motivate you to refresh
[50:28] you that you are children of the life
[50:31] that's what I'm doing tonight
[50:33] I'll talk about being born again
[50:35] afterwards I'm just trying to refresh
[50:37] your memory that you are the children of
[50:40] the light in case you are starting to
[50:42] forget
[50:43] in case you just you're studying to
[50:45] doubt you are the part of what was there
[50:49] when God created when God said let there
[50:51] be light because you were in Jesus
[50:53] Christ
[50:54] and then he came and he was crucified
[50:57] and the Bible the prophet said that the
[51:00] bride was there with him
[51:03] who's the bride
[51:06] so so they need to come a point having
[51:09] said all these things and the creation
[51:12] you know because what resulted now is
[51:14] that God decided okay I'm gonna make
[51:16] this one called f he he made all those
[51:19] things that came out and everything in
[51:21] the universe and he was looking at
[51:22] measuring it as a mind look at this one
[51:24] let me reduce the speed for this one and
[51:27] then he will say ah you know and he was
[51:29] saying you like his son logos himself
[51:31] the Son of God Jesus Christ was sitting
[51:34] there like maybe a little child William
[51:36] playing with those dinosaurs of his and
[51:38] then then from there he make them talk
[51:42] he make them huh
[51:44] so that's what God that's how the
[51:46] creation was but then he came
[51:48] specifically to this one that one that
[51:49] we are looking at and then he said okay
[51:51] I'm gonna make this special one
[51:54] the planet f
[51:56] and he carefully made it and he made it
[51:59] and designed it everything put all the
[52:01] minerals and everything and then he
[52:03] created Our Father Adam and he put him
[52:05] there as we know creation today of the
[52:09] earth that's what he did there
[52:11] then time went on and on and on and on
[52:15] and here we are today
[52:17] at the end now now we want to go back
[52:22] right because time is getting finished
[52:24] when time is finished what are you gonna
[52:26] do
[52:27] because whether whether you are ready or
[52:29] not time is getting finished
[52:33] look
[52:36] you must be born again
[52:40] in order for you to not I'm talking
[52:43] about uh being born again remember the
[52:46] man called Nicodemus
[52:49] let's read about you
[52:52] Jesus answered and said unto him verily
[52:55] verily you know this word very I went
[52:57] and checked it absolutely absolutely
[53:01] I don't know about the best way to say
[53:03] Brother David
[53:04] seriously seriously
[53:07] all right
[53:09] uh what was another heavy English with
[53:12] brother
[53:13] that is stronger than absolutely
[53:15] which means
[53:17] for for sure
[53:21] I say unto you Nicodemus except a man is
[53:26] born again
[53:27] a human being
[53:30] he cannot see the kingdom of God
[53:34] one
[53:36] what does verse 4 says this one says you
[53:39] cannot see it right
[53:40] seeing to me talks about the Revelation
[53:43] the understanding huh it talks about
[53:48] seeing that you are now being called in
[53:51] the kingdom of God
[53:53] hmm
[53:54] you can't see it if you are not born
[53:56] again
[53:57] verse 4 Jesus answered and said verily
[54:00] verily I say unto you accept amen be
[54:02] born again
[54:03] of born except a man be born of water
[54:07] one
[54:08] and of the spirit
[54:11] two he cannot enter into the kingdom of
[54:14] God this is the things that you know
[54:16] brothers and sisters but it seems to me
[54:18] that many times if this is not suitable
[54:21] to you maybe to the young believers
[54:23] maybe to the youth maybe to the young
[54:24] people please just understand just be
[54:27] patient with me maybe one of them can
[54:28] catch it
[54:30] maybe we left them behind at the spot
[54:33] where they only got baptized and they
[54:35] never went there because here he says
[54:37] accept amen be born again with water and
[54:40] the spirit
[54:42] right so it means just being baptized in
[54:45] water alone is not enough
[54:49] are we together
[54:50] and there's no use to be born again in
[54:52] water if you're not going to be born by
[54:54] the spirit
[54:56] they go together
[54:58] right
[54:59] Marvel note that I say unto you must be
[55:01] born again because this is so seriously
[55:04] seriously seriously Nicole you must
[55:07] go tell them
[55:09] except you are born again with water and
[55:13] the spirit
[55:14] now many times people get born up to
[55:17] this up to the water
[55:19] some go maybe a little further and just
[55:22] just allow the touch of the spirit in
[55:24] their soul in their Spirit here just in
[55:26] the spiritual realm and you feel excess
[55:28] and energized and you feel wow I'm A
[55:30] Daughter of Zion hey I'm full of the
[55:32] spirit
[55:34] be born again
[55:37] the personal description here he said
[55:39] and you did it was it brother Ben I
[55:42] can't remember who someone did that I'll
[55:44] give you a new heart
[55:47] to give you a new heart and you know the
[55:50] Bible says out of the heart the mouth
[55:51] speakers we think using our hearts okay
[55:54] I know our minds but the bigger
[55:58] decisions that we make
[56:02] this is the real guy I don't know if
[56:04] they change a heart and they put another
[56:07] heart Dr Chris Barnard and put another
[56:09] heart
[56:11] what happened
[56:13] maybe that's not that hard that the
[56:14] Bible is talking about
[56:16] maybe it's the soul
[56:20] that's what we're talking about perhaps
[56:21] that God gives you a new heart
[56:24] in inside there it gives a new spirit
[56:26] and it will become a new person
[56:29] completely no more just on the periphery
[56:31] on the spirit and you feel oh I love my
[56:35] brothers I love yes and are you born
[56:38] again
[56:42] hmm
[56:44] what is a new bell
[56:47] to be born again is something Way Beyond
[56:50] this Natural Life
[56:52] Way Beyond just reading the Bible
[56:55] and it's true it's important to read the
[56:57] Bible why Beyond just Gathering here
[56:59] together and smiling at each other
[57:02] whether we mean it or not but the issue
[57:05] is is Way Beyond all those things
[57:07] is beyond way way
[57:11] and even applying the scriptures I
[57:13] believe that the new birth is something
[57:15] beyond that even though how well you
[57:18] might mean it
[57:19] I believe something that the new bed is
[57:23] far beyond your good intentions
[57:26] and your thoughts Minds is beyond that
[57:30] and no matter how much that we try to
[57:33] think we are right in saying a Creed or
[57:36] joining a church you will still you are
[57:39] still what you wear until you are
[57:41] actually born again of the spirit of God
[57:45] I'm not trying to to say that you are
[57:47] not born again
[57:48] I'm trying to say that
[57:50] the Pastor said we must take stock
[57:54] the Lord Jesus I hate him the Lord Jesus
[57:56] on Sunday speaking through him that help
[57:59] you let's take stock
[58:04] they ask them
[58:07] are you born again yes have you received
[58:09] the spirit since you you believed
[58:12] then they said No Heaven said oh you
[58:15] haven't
[58:16] because the process is that you must
[58:17] baptize and receive so okay tell me
[58:19] which baptism will you use did you use
[58:21] yeah let's rather start there because
[58:23] two of them it's no need for me to pray
[58:24] for the spirit now because you haven't
[58:26] received it well let's start by grade
[58:28] one yes zero how were you baptized
[58:33] okay do you believe yes how are you
[58:35] baptized uh in the baptism of John back
[58:39] to the water
[58:41] because because if they go together
[58:46] now there's some things got to happen
[58:49] and that's the new bed
[58:52] that new bed is an experience you know
[58:55] there's no University in the whole world
[58:58] or any Academia or Institute or
[59:01] professor
[59:03] who will teach you an experience
[59:06] and there's no one who can come to you
[59:09] Dave and take your experience away yeah
[59:13] hey
[59:15] so therefore
[59:16] and
[59:17] and this experience
[59:19] this experience I'm talking about it's
[59:20] not an experience where you're gonna say
[59:22] you know you know brother India I've got
[59:24] 40 years experience that's not
[59:28] well
[59:29] dude that's that's the way
[59:31] that that has got to do with my skills
[59:34] my abilities my this what what that's
[59:37] I've got an experience
[59:39] it's true
[59:40] but an experience in the Lord have you
[59:43] experienced the new birth
[59:45] since you believe
[59:47] I can hear that yes shakana started in
[59:51] 2011 and everything we are 10 years old
[59:53] now going for 12. have you been born
[59:56] again by the spirit
[1:00:01] amen
[1:00:04] now
[1:00:05] process of the new birth
[1:00:07] normal natural bed types the spiritual
[1:00:10] one
[1:00:12] all things that are natural did I hear
[1:00:14] correctly brother Ben all things
[1:00:17] all things of the natural is types of
[1:00:20] the spiritual all things
[1:00:23] that means pretty much you can take like
[1:00:26] they say here in New Zealand I'm like a
[1:00:27] kid now pretty much
[1:00:29] pretty much you can take everything that
[1:00:32] you see here
[1:00:34] physically
[1:00:36] and find something in their spiritual
[1:00:38] that types it pretty much
[1:00:41] you can do that
[1:00:43] you can actually because he says all
[1:00:46] things on the natural
[1:00:48] that is why always always
[1:00:50] said put on your spiritual jacket now
[1:00:55] ah put on your spiritual
[1:00:57] foreign
[1:01:00] I'm nothing zero you know that program
[1:01:03] called zero I don't know why they can
[1:01:06] say such a useful program of accounting
[1:01:09] and managing books Isaac they call it
[1:01:10] zero
[1:01:13] if they should have just said million
[1:01:16] to show that but
[1:01:18] don't look at
[1:01:20] what when someone is preaching here put
[1:01:22] on your spiritual jacket
[1:01:24] when you deal with your brother put on
[1:01:26] your spiritual jacket when you deal with
[1:01:28] God's children be very careful
[1:01:30] be very careful because you are dealing
[1:01:33] with the children of the light and the
[1:01:35] light can cut you if you are not careful
[1:01:38] you are dealing with a dangerous
[1:01:40] commodity nobody will sell it for you
[1:01:42] they can do nothing they can only
[1:01:44] harness and harness it and bring it in
[1:01:47] solar light but they will never finish
[1:01:49] it
[1:01:50] it is the only resource that I know
[1:01:53] that you can take one candle and light a
[1:01:57] billion other candle sister terrorism
[1:01:59] without it being affected
[1:02:02] light that's how it is gold I know it it
[1:02:06] can get finished
[1:02:07] ah nitrogen we can finish it
[1:02:11] ah fire it can bend and die or or wood
[1:02:15] amount to say wood you can bend them
[1:02:17] finish
[1:02:19] everything
[1:02:20] even air you can finish it
[1:02:23] and water all of them only light
[1:02:27] you can exhaust it
[1:02:29] natural light
[1:02:31] I can't finish it how much more about
[1:02:33] this the real light
[1:02:36] their fountain
[1:02:39] his name is Jesus
[1:02:46] and we find out if we look out here on
[1:02:50] the ground and see the tree in the air
[1:02:52] growing
[1:02:54] let's see growing
[1:02:56] struggling for life
[1:02:59] that goes to show that there is a tree
[1:03:01] somewhere that doesn't die
[1:03:03] that's this natural
[1:03:05] spiritual yes yes if this is your bodies
[1:03:09] that I'm looking at now
[1:03:12] this I'm not another body
[1:03:14] somewhere that
[1:03:16] does not need these classes
[1:03:19] you're right that's good ah it does not
[1:03:22] need
[1:03:27] should I say oxygen yeah
[1:03:32] yeah it does not needed
[1:03:34] that body sister Belinda he does not
[1:03:37] need multivitamins
[1:03:40] I've got a colleague at work who sit
[1:03:42] next to me we call her mama
[1:03:44] she's got she's got a container
[1:03:49] of Samson
[1:03:51] here take I said no no mama
[1:03:55] do you go you good now I I I want to
[1:03:59] tell her maybe if I can remember Mama
[1:04:01] you know there is a body
[1:04:02] somewhere
[1:04:04] that don't need that do you want to have
[1:04:06] that body
[1:04:08] because she's 65 and we were doing a
[1:04:10] birthday for her and she's so very nice
[1:04:14] now there is a body
[1:04:17] if this natural types is spiritual there
[1:04:20] is a body
[1:04:23] and that body is a body of the light
[1:04:24] amen I want to finish now
[1:04:29] now
[1:04:31] the approach to this bed there's an
[1:04:35] approach
[1:04:36] and and and to be to be to approach this
[1:04:39] birth you have to go through a process
[1:04:42] just like anything that lives anything
[1:04:44] that lives again
[1:04:46] you've got to die first
[1:04:48] that's the that's the process that's the
[1:04:50] point about this new bed sister
[1:04:52] honey this is the process about this
[1:04:55] birth
[1:04:56] that you must die
[1:04:59] fast
[1:05:01] wife or cousin
[1:05:05] I don't want to keep on calling others
[1:05:07] and then I I never had him calling
[1:05:09] sisters happy
[1:05:12] you must die first
[1:05:18] in order to live
[1:05:19] are we in agreement
[1:05:21] are we together brothers and sisters so
[1:05:23] that's what he says it says that that's
[1:05:26] the process
[1:05:28] it doesn't matter what you are saying
[1:05:29] what you are willing to do what you are
[1:05:32] not willing to do
[1:05:34] willing and willingness alone is not
[1:05:36] gonna help you
[1:05:37] coming here with us all day yes
[1:05:41] it's not gonna help you yeah
[1:05:43] you are a daughter of light you me and
[1:05:47] you must come to our real manifestation
[1:05:50] of who we are and we must die first this
[1:05:53] site this thing must die yes what must
[1:05:56] die
[1:06:03] now he says here
[1:06:05] you've got to Recon yourself so guilty
[1:06:07] in the presence of God
[1:06:09] until because look
[1:06:12] you were born guilty
[1:06:14] before you even started to open your
[1:06:16] little mouth
[1:06:17] you were already a guilty little baby
[1:06:23] and then you come to a point the part of
[1:06:25] that process not that you must always be
[1:06:27] sitting there feeling guilty you accept
[1:06:30] the guilt and you accept that Lord
[1:06:34] Now kill me
[1:06:42] because you are a One Creation a human
[1:06:44] being born in sexual desire here on
[1:06:47] Earth and now you are now a creation
[1:06:49] born by the spirit when you are born
[1:06:51] again your thoughts are dead your
[1:06:54] thoughts oh yes I did
[1:06:57] there's this thoughts that I don't want
[1:06:59] to die do you know them
[1:07:02] these thoughts that don't want to die
[1:07:04] there are an impediment they are an
[1:07:07] obstacle towards me reaching my fullest
[1:07:10] potential of who I am they are maybe
[1:07:12] just a few more kilometers I'll be there
[1:07:15] just a few more attempts to to surrender
[1:07:18] myself before the Lord but the thoughts
[1:07:20] man
[1:07:21] they keep on disturbing me this evil
[1:07:24] thoughts
[1:07:27] or human thoughts they don't want to die
[1:07:30] no
[1:07:31] come
[1:07:33] come to the sacrifice
[1:07:35] remember to be born again is to have
[1:07:37] that extreme laugh
[1:07:39] and know that we pass from Death unto
[1:07:42] life we have the abundance of life that
[1:07:45] and the Abundant Life is that
[1:07:47] overflowing something that God put into
[1:07:51] a human being
[1:07:53] hey
[1:07:55] my brothers and sisters this is a
[1:07:57] serious business it's not of whether I'm
[1:07:59] the one saying it or brother Ben this is
[1:08:02] a serious deal

[1:08:15] the Pastor said to us let's take stock

[1:11:02] renew you and give you the new okay they
[1:11:04] knew you
[1:11:05] but the process of dying you have got to
[1:11:08] come and lay yourself on the alt fully
[1:11:11] not just the food
[1:11:13] that's what he's saying for the new bed
[1:11:16] to be born again you must die
[1:11:19] after all everything that lives
[1:11:22] something died yeah
[1:11:24] after all so so it's a process let's
[1:11:27] click the next one thing
[1:11:31] because I'm done anyway I'm finished
[1:11:35] and I'm hoping to be on time
[1:11:39] I just want you to be short and
[1:11:41] straightforward did you hear that clip
[1:11:43] carefully
[1:11:45] do you like it
[1:11:46] do you like it
[1:11:49] I I I played it over and over and as I
[1:11:52] said Lord
[1:11:53] if I have not fully died is it my me or
[1:11:57] what Lord bend it kill it
[1:12:00] listen
[1:12:03] to that one who appreciate him brother
[1:12:06] Ben it's not about a man
[1:12:10] who write God forever and ever
[1:12:12] amen eons of time until eternity
[1:12:14] everyone will walk you know all other
[1:12:16] people walk everyone in the name of his
[1:12:18] God
[1:12:19] depression
[1:12:21] bipolar
[1:12:23] schizophrenia grudges well my parents
[1:12:26] did this to me my friends did this to me
[1:12:28] my culture did this to me you know
[1:12:30] resentment Pride Envy malice Strife
[1:12:33] whatever it may be everyone walks in the
[1:12:35] name of their God but we won't walk in
[1:12:37] those names I mean because we're not
[1:12:39] identified by that you know some people
[1:12:41] are full of Pride we're not identified
[1:12:43] with that I mean some people are envious
[1:12:46] and jealous and all those things that's
[1:12:48] the god that they worship because the
[1:12:50] thing that affects you most in your
[1:12:52] everyday life that's your God that's it
[1:12:54] it's not about coming here twice a week
[1:12:56] no who's your god from Sunday to Sunday
[1:12:59] to Sunday to Sunday WHo
[1:13:01] Hallelujah so there is a reason why the
[1:13:05] Lord say those things among us
[1:13:08] God is warning us
[1:13:10] it may not be you but it may be someone
[1:13:13] else remember we are a body
[1:13:16] the entire body must go home
[1:13:19] you don't want to be the channel of the
[1:13:21] devil waking and disturbing the bride
[1:13:24] yeah from reaching his fullest potential
[1:13:28] there is a reason why these things are
[1:13:30] mentioned Among Us search me Lord me
[1:13:34] start with me Lord
[1:13:36] if you find yourself the word of God
[1:13:38] preaching and you don't think of
[1:13:39] yourself
[1:13:41] you need to die
[1:13:46] last one final that's the final that's
[1:13:49] only brother I put you on the spot that
[1:13:52] was the best I could do
[1:13:54] to take his copyright
[1:13:57] I'm just going to make a Quantum Leap
[1:13:59] from here to the fruits of the spirit
[1:14:03] companies do a stock tank yeah I told
[1:14:05] you he's ever had to do a stock take at
[1:14:07] work
[1:14:08] you're doing everyday things you're you
[1:14:10] know your daily schedule that you've
[1:14:12] been given a either a spreadsheet or a
[1:14:14] computer a big bit of paper do a stock
[1:14:15] tank Hallelujah and you're like oh
[1:14:20] can we just open everything so it's not
[1:14:22] you know and stop but you can't do that
[1:14:24] all though anyway
[1:14:26] you have to do a stock take
[1:14:28] but a stop take is necessary
[1:14:30] because you see what inventory you're
[1:14:33] carrying not what you think you possess
[1:14:35] what you actually possess and this is
[1:14:38] very very important because we need to
[1:14:40] do a stock take once in a while
[1:14:42] we need to make inventory of our life
[1:14:45] and see what is in our warehouse
[1:14:48] our warehouse not a physical Warehouse a
[1:14:51] warehouse hey man right because you'll
[1:14:54] have something on this list you could
[1:14:56] say Amen thank you so much
[1:14:59] I know you can go home and listen to
[1:15:01] this but it's always nice to sit
[1:15:03] together on the table and eat together
[1:15:05] isn't it that's what I'm trying to do
[1:15:07] to put put on the table and we eat it
[1:15:10] together you know you even learn to eat
[1:15:12] faster
[1:15:14] you learn the techniques of grabbing the
[1:15:17] best side of the table because you know
[1:15:20] Sister Priscilla set up the table and
[1:15:22] now I'm are you positioning yourself
[1:15:24] or you go there by Sister Chantel they
[1:15:26] say big table
[1:15:28] when you get there you find there's a
[1:15:30] big table with things on top you need to
[1:15:32] position yourself
[1:15:34] because otherwise you might lose the
[1:15:38] best part
[1:15:40] so I'm just bringing this to to say
[1:15:43] brothers
[1:15:44] not to joke or or laugh or but but just
[1:15:47] to try to re-emphasize that hey there is
[1:15:50] a reason why the spirit of God brings
[1:15:53] these things among us because when you
[1:15:55] left home you prayed right and you asked
[1:15:57] God to to come
[1:15:59] in in his fullness and God came and
[1:16:01] preached and said these things
[1:16:04] so we don't want to be like a kid
[1:16:08] if you take stock take there are things
[1:16:11] that you find in there that some of them
[1:16:12] are what you call breakages
[1:16:17] some of them are things that were
[1:16:19] someone just opened a packet and steal
[1:16:21] something and go it's short you can't
[1:16:23] sell it anymore
[1:16:25] some of them have expired
[1:16:28] when it does when you do expect a real
[1:16:30] stock take
[1:16:32] and you take this is still in a good
[1:16:34] condition we are actually going to put
[1:16:35] the price up
[1:16:37] this one is an old model
[1:16:41] we are going to send it back to the
[1:16:43] supplier
[1:16:45] ah this one
[1:16:47] we're just gonna put it under the shelf
[1:16:50] for clearance
[1:16:51] it must go with the Devil
[1:16:57] it must go if they don't want it take it
[1:17:00] to where they give people things for
[1:17:01] free go
[1:17:02] I don't want this one not in my
[1:17:05] warehouse
[1:17:08] in my warehouse I want all the products
[1:17:10] that are Sharp
[1:17:11] that I have the best models for my
[1:17:14] client

[1:17:28] and wear Flash and die that's a big
[1:17:30] price man
[1:17:32] it's not a price for you young people to
[1:17:34] come here and joke and play
[1:17:37] and the thing that we are here to play
[1:17:39] you're making it very difficult for the
[1:17:41] parents
[1:17:42] a new parents you're also making it
[1:17:45] difficult for being soft
[1:17:48] I'm sorry to say that but
[1:17:51] we don't want children delinquency
[1:17:56] we also don't want parental delinquency
[1:18:01] children according to the Bible yeah
[1:18:06] because you cannot take the weight of
[1:18:09] God and that that brings a big question
[1:18:12] have you been born again yourself
[1:18:14] because let me tell you you cannot teach
[1:18:16] me how to drive if you don't know right
[1:18:19] can you
[1:18:20] I'm sorry this is
[1:18:22] I want to allow you to teach me
[1:18:26] you must show me your license
[1:18:29] and how many years of experience have
[1:18:31] you been driving then I said okay okay
[1:18:33] teach me my girl what do we do what is
[1:18:35] this again this okay because you have
[1:18:37] been driving for so long and I've Got
[1:18:40] Confidence now parents are we dead
[1:18:44] right come on
[1:18:46] because if you die you you could means
[1:18:50] you are a new person then you are able
[1:18:51] to take this young person and lead him
[1:18:57] in the process of New Birth because you
[1:19:00] have been there
[1:19:05] I'm challenging parents yeah
[1:19:07] you young people close your ears yours
[1:19:10] is coming now
[1:19:11] parents it it is our responsibility
[1:19:16] God is going to ask you a question
[1:19:19] when your daughter did this
[1:19:21] what did you do
[1:19:23] I'm checking my file of stock I don't
[1:19:26] see a record of your prayers here
[1:19:28] did I say don't come in and pray to me
[1:19:31] for your daughter
[1:19:33] when your son did this and this and you
[1:19:35] knew about it what did you do
[1:19:38] oh Lord I prayed how many times once and
[1:19:41] oh Lord help me Lord help my son
[1:19:44] and you think God is God is a serious
[1:19:46] God yeah he everything that God does
[1:19:50] he's serious
[1:19:51] yes he's a wonderful God but every God
[1:19:55] does not do certain things joking
[1:19:57] no everything that God does is serious
[1:20:00] about it and he means business
[1:20:02] everything
[1:20:04] we've got time to joke and so I'm sorry
[1:20:06] until the Bible correct us and say hey
[1:20:08] even when you talk watch your language
[1:20:11] evil communication brings what
[1:20:15] so we must not be mixed up with the
[1:20:17] world and people can confuse us it must
[1:20:19] be very clear
[1:20:22] I'm finished
[1:20:24] let us
[1:20:28] forgive me if I've heard you
[1:20:31] but the key is about being born again
[1:20:36] okay I'm finished now if it's okay can I
[1:20:39] read the second Timothy you know it if I
[1:20:42] don't read it promise me that you'll go
[1:20:44] read it at home
[1:20:46] I don't want to put you on a spot but
[1:20:49] because of time will you just go home
[1:20:52] and reread second Timothy chapter
[1:20:56] he says perilous times are going to come
[1:20:58] brothers and sisters you know what is
[1:21:00] the meaning of the word perilous
[1:21:03] evil
[1:21:05] and he says in those perilous times
[1:21:06] which is now you're going to find men
[1:21:08] who are reprobates you know what is they
[1:21:11] reprobate
[1:21:13] like a vagabond
[1:21:15] someone who a mule is you can't change a
[1:21:20] mule
[1:21:21] we are living and on a daily basis with
[1:21:23] those Spirits here
[1:21:26] that means we've got to be very careful
[1:21:28] we've got to take ourselves when it
[1:21:31] comes to our life
[1:21:33] our new birth everything must be serious
[1:21:37] that's 10 brothers and sisters
[1:21:41] may the Lord bless you
[1:21:43] are everything that I've told you
[1:21:46] I know you know it
[1:21:48] it's just a refresher to say let's go
[1:21:51] and and check because we are not cheap
[1:21:55] children we have been purchased with a
[1:21:58] higher price
[1:21:59] we have been patches with a very
[1:22:01] expensive price
[1:22:03] therefore you have to know who you are
[1:22:07] if you don't understand who you are ask
[1:22:09] God to give you the revelation of the
[1:22:12] magnitude of Who You Are
[1:22:14] so that you can know yourself and
[1:22:16] approach yourself and your lord
[1:22:18] accordingly
[1:22:21] are we together
[1:22:23] please go home and read second Timothy
[1:22:24] for me or for the Lord and said Lord
[1:22:27] when you read all those dangerous things

[1:22:31] not even in me next to me if it's in my
[1:22:34] family my friend my whoever next to me
[1:22:37] remove it I don't want to come across
[1:22:39] those spirits of reprobates read it is

[1:29:48] [Music]
[1:29:59] Hallelujah just for a second just for
[1:30:02] one quick second if it's okay my wife
[1:30:05] just want to give you a quick testimony
[1:30:06] if it's all right and then then we can
[1:30:09] close the prayer and we can go home is
[1:30:11] that acceptable so I'm not just allowing
[1:30:14] here because
[1:30:15] [Music]
[1:30:16] the mic I mean maybe we can just
[1:30:20] sit for a little bit
[1:30:22] [Music]
[1:30:34] God bless you
[1:30:38] and as I was sitting there I wasn't too
[1:30:41] sure whether I should share this
[1:30:43] testimony or not
[1:30:46] but I just kept on feeling the bed and
[1:30:49] that says maybe it can encourage someone
[1:30:52] so if we go back to 2021 May the 30th
[1:30:59] you'll remember that I was at the back
[1:31:01] there I tried picking up a baby and then
[1:31:04] somehow
[1:31:06] something happened to my back I don't
[1:31:08] know what happened I cannot explain it
[1:31:10] to this day but it took about
[1:31:13] three months for the pain to be
[1:31:15] normalized in about six months for me to
[1:31:18] get to a full healing
[1:31:21] so yesterday in the morning when I tried
[1:31:24] waking up I opened my eyes I realized
[1:31:26] that I cannot move
[1:31:30] I couldn't stand up from the bed
[1:31:33] and at that point in time my husband had
[1:31:37] an appointment with Sister Barbara early
[1:31:39] in the morning
[1:31:40] so he was gone already I'm alone in the
[1:31:43] room and
[1:31:45] there is nothing that I can do
[1:31:47] [Music]
[1:31:50] I Only Could rely on trying to remember
[1:31:53] all the techniques that I was taught
[1:31:55] when I was at the hospital as to how you
[1:31:57] can manage to roll in order to come out
[1:31:59] of bed I rolled out
[1:32:03] I stood next to the bed
[1:32:06] but it took me about an hour to manage
[1:32:08] to roll out of the bed and then I stood
[1:32:11] I cannot walk there is nothing I can do
[1:32:15] then the devil will then bring the fear
[1:32:18] then I'm thinking is this going to take
[1:32:21] three months again to get healed
[1:32:24] is this pain going to take again six to
[1:32:27] seven months for me to be
[1:32:30] normal again
[1:32:33] I could not accept it
[1:32:35] I said Lord I'm not going to allow this
[1:32:38] pain to control me
[1:32:39] [Music]
[1:32:41] don't know what she got it but there is
[1:32:44] no way I'm even going to take seat leaf
[1:32:48] [Music]
[1:32:51] I stayed in bed for some time until my
[1:32:54] husband came back from the
[1:32:56] from Starbucks clinic and then I
[1:32:58] explained to him then I asked him to
[1:33:00] pray with me then he he was already late
[1:33:03] for work I knew that while he's busy
[1:33:04] working he'll continue with
[1:33:08] with praying then I eventually managed
[1:33:10] to get out of bed I prepared myself I
[1:33:12] found the kids already busy schooling I
[1:33:15] told them if you're busy with your
[1:33:16] school can you please pray for me
[1:33:19] I'm not well at all but I decided I'm
[1:33:22] not taking sick leave I'm not going to
[1:33:24] allow this
[1:33:27] to control because if I knew I triggered
[1:33:31] it I would at least zoom on to the
[1:33:34] problem and deal with it then I went and
[1:33:36] continued working I didn't even tell my
[1:33:38] manager anything only when I was about
[1:33:40] to log off I said to her I've had this
[1:33:44] issue I'll monitor it tomorrow if
[1:33:46] there's any more problems I'll let you
[1:33:49] know but for now I'm not taking any
[1:33:51] leave I'm continuing
[1:33:53] then I kept on praying about it I was
[1:33:55] struggling I went to sleep again it was
[1:33:58] even more painful than in the morning
[1:34:00] but I told little that you're not
[1:34:02] continue playing as well I'm not going
[1:34:05] to let this control me
[1:34:08] then
[1:34:09] the last thing when I went to sleep I
[1:34:12] was busy thinking
[1:34:14] Lord you are a miracle working God
[1:34:17] I believe you can help me then I went to
[1:34:20] sleep
[1:34:21] this morning when I woke up I thought I
[1:34:24] was dreaming because there was not a
[1:34:27] single pain
[1:34:28] and then I got out of bed
[1:34:32] I tried walking I realized I can walk I
[1:34:35] walked back I realized I can walk
[1:34:38] my husband slept late because he was
[1:34:40] busy preaching but at that time I
[1:34:44] couldn't say Let Me Wait for him to wake
[1:34:45] up I said to him
[1:34:47] a miracle has happened I've been healed
[1:34:50] I can walk again
[1:34:52] and then
[1:34:53] I just couldn't hold it in me I just had
[1:34:57] to share this testimony that God is
[1:34:59] still a miracle working God just just
[1:35:02] hold on to his promises whatever you're
[1:35:05] going through
[1:35:06] he will come through for you
[1:35:10] [Applause]
[1:35:14] [Music]
[1:35:16] the devil is a liar brothers and sisters
[1:35:18] he's a liar and a father of Lies amen
[1:35:21] let's just stand we're going to pray now
[1:35:23] and then we're going to go home amen
[1:35:26] I was supposed to finish at 22. I I am
[1:35:31] failing to manage time
[1:35:33] pray for me
[1:35:37] if there's a need in your heart
[1:35:41] before God you see this you hear this
[1:35:44] song
