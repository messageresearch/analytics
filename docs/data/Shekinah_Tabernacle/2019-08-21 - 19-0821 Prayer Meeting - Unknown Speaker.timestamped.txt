[5:35] hear you softly say
[5:41] [Music]
[7:14] but I'm not something you actually I
[7:22] said some other time
[7:28] discussion amen and then so we just try
[7:35] to to see if we can move in roots and
[7:37] finish if finish is fun because never I
[7:49] thought that maybe you want hope that
[7:52] time to go in just browsin you know
[8:02] breaking someone did we say I did then
[8:54] so what to say is that this is an intro
[8:58] what what what our nation overall say
[9:00] was people afraid that the Lord can just
[9:02] you guide me it's not fair that is why I
[9:06] was asking that what what we are here
[9:08] for it for it for it for a pip was for
[9:10] admission it's also directed to me
[9:14] I wish I must do it that way that I'm
[9:17] saying ha
[9:20] he's actually meant to recap last time
[9:22] we spoke about the greatest battle ever
[9:24] fought and we spoke was that there that
[9:27] this battle started in heaven no problem
[9:36] I put a problem with you because what is
[9:39] that little girl silly things directing
[9:42] here to do this no wonder the Lord said
[9:45] if you cannot take the kingdom of God
[9:47] like this little ones yeah huh well she
[9:50] raised them did he praise God
[9:52] so he'll not be a street of the devil it
[9:56] must be the Holy Spirit directing here
[9:58] to do this right yeah so we said the
[10:02] battle started in heaven Lucifer's keep
[10:05] down here
[10:06] amen and it came to this earth and it
[10:10] landed in there no man showed normal
[10:13] slain as that greet when when you boys
[10:16] who play marbles Oh
[10:18] will will bet ten sentences ten cent for
[10:20] this group they used to be a state that
[10:26] says the winner takes all huh so in this
[10:30] battle the winner takes the winner takes
[10:33] all the winner doesn't take half if the
[10:36] Lord Jesus wins and take nd as his he
[10:39] doesn't take half of nd he takes all of
[10:43] India and then so the Lord won't take
[10:46] 1/2 of brother James half of snow he
[10:49] takes everything the way that you saw
[10:51] you from the beginning
[10:52] I'm trying to recap and I'm going the
[10:54] other way we said that an army and you
[10:57] see like this law is very innocent
[10:59] he's just innocent and if we can take
[11:02] the kingdom of God like this guy we'll
[11:05] have no problems we are guaranteed our
[11:08] seat at the marriage supper amen
[11:11] we said the army is us we are as an army
[11:16] and we have to be chained we spoke about
[11:19] the army that must be trained we spoke
[11:21] that the army must be equipped we said
[11:23] that the army must must be you know
[11:25] physically the army must be physically
[11:27] ready isn't it
[11:29] physically and mentally ready in the
[11:32] physical realm on earth that's how an
[11:35] army should be isn't it so now and we
[11:37] also said that the army should have the
[11:40] ammunition we said that the army should
[11:42] have the weapons no used to have loads
[11:45] and loads of ammunition but there's no
[11:48] way point to load it or have big guns
[11:53] machine guns in bazookas ak-47 but
[11:57] there's no ammunition so those are the
[11:59] things that a literal military army
[12:02] needs to fight the battle right and then
[12:06] we saw we said that in this battle God
[12:08] means to open up the channels remember
[12:11] that they discussion deliver that the
[12:13] the channel of H of a son and a daughter
[12:15] of God must be open in order for God to
[12:18] come and work through that channel and
[12:20] we said the battle this belt that is
[12:22] being fought in the mind and his sir is
[12:27] so
[12:29] to an extent that the devil the devil
[12:32] cannot actually does not even stick to
[12:34] the rules of war what they say the rules
[12:37] of war if you can find you look in that
[12:40] way and maybe can just finish you off
[12:43] and always he will do that that's the
[12:46] type of an enemy that we are fighting if
[12:48] he can find you and aware that you are
[12:50] doing an error just for him to be mean
[12:54] and get into hell he will do that so
[12:57] he's not going to wait for you like in
[12:59] boxing they say no no no no no he's down
[13:01] living they count no no no no there's no
[13:03] rules of who according to the devil even
[13:05] though our Lord Jesus he's a gentleman
[13:08] he tries to fight with him baby I don't
[13:11] think if devil was God you live in allow
[13:14] users to come and talk to him but our
[13:16] Savior our captain allows him to come
[13:19] and discuss about about how is the
[13:22] battleground going how is my children
[13:24] how is my son and the devil accused me
[13:28] even allows him to accuse us
[13:31] that's how dissent is but the enemies
[13:33] are complete opposites
[13:34] because he himself is the son of
[13:36] perdition the son of perdition the
[13:39] father of lies so surely we cannot
[13:42] expect anything good from him we know
[13:44] and might be alert as the army that no
[13:47] matter what we can the roots of all that
[13:49] we can stick to our enemy could be
[13:52] around the corner our enemy could read
[13:54] now be aiming at us and that means
[13:58] brothers and sisters that they we have
[14:02] to be forever ready all the time am i
[14:06] right uh-uh uh-uh you know I was so
[14:09] blessed last the three less than this
[14:12] powerful for me strong I was I was very
[14:16] blessed I was blessed because the word
[14:18] spoke to me about love but at the end
[14:20] was talking about it I thought this
[14:22] group was not high enough that shouldn't
[14:26] be able yes that's so strong for me that
[14:29] area lasted a we cannot make it without
[14:32] that love
[14:33] in fact it's not a question of making
[14:37] that place is full of love so we have to
[14:41] be that love to be there
[14:42] then came brother Isaac that we are God
[14:44] the proof is saved the Prophet says yeah
[14:47] unless of course now we have gods you
[14:50] know despite the fact that God naturally
[14:53] emit a human being to be a God of all
[14:55] the nature and they then everything to
[14:58] control despite the abilities that God
[15:00] has given us God as particularly the
[15:04] brightest made as a mature God if
[15:06] they're a child of God you are a God so
[15:09] that really blessed me so much and and
[15:11] and and my message runs it's gonna just
[15:14] run through those messages then plug the
[15:15] band just put cherry on top
[15:18] on Sunday me sometimes is difficult to
[15:24] come and preach when people like that
[15:26] come in bridge it's very difficult
[15:28] because now here just you are wobbling
[15:30] around but now I was signed to recap we
[15:34] have recap right and i've refreshed your
[15:36] mind I might have not said everything
[15:38] that we discussed seven eight minutes
[15:40] now AB recap eight minutes right now I'm
[15:43] going to proceed with my last remaining
[15:45] minutes and see where will the Lord lend
[15:47] us
[15:48] then I'll learn from you extra minutes
[15:50] you can charge me interest this one but
[15:53] now actually proceed here just bear with
[15:57] me if I repeat settled is because the
[15:58] list actually you can think the message
[16:01] repeats itself but because the message
[16:04] is one big one one big truth one big
[16:06] thing that is no you cannot talk of
[16:09] something without talking of something
[16:11] that is why a brother preaches and you
[16:13] connect something to the other message
[16:15] and a brother preaches this and you can
[16:17] because the message even the prophet you
[16:19] will think that is repeating himself no
[16:21] he is saying it as it is we emphasize
[16:24] things to try to laid it into your soul
[16:27] Amen now did this pattern that we are
[16:30] talking about is a battle between life
[16:34] and death is the battle between faith
[16:37] and doubt is there a battle between
[16:40] victory and was the opposite of victory
[16:44] now defeats the complete is a battle
[16:48] between the truth and the life is the
[16:51] battle between death and life
[16:53] now when you fight for your life when
[16:56] you are fighting for your life it's not
[16:58] a joke it's not something that you can
[17:01] do it on part-time basis it's not
[17:03] something that you can joke around and
[17:05] then just come to change something that
[17:08] you can say be a good social group
[17:10] people to fellowship with it's not
[17:13] something when you fight you for life
[17:14] when you know and you know goddess
[17:16] rebuild your eyes it's not something
[17:19] that you can just sit there in that
[17:21] wonderful bunch of people yeah you know
[17:23] they're so good
[17:24] let me just in around it's not something
[17:26] that you are cause this means you don't
[17:27] realize if you do that you are not
[17:29] realizing what is this battle about this
[17:32] that is about life and death it's about
[17:35] going to heaven or go into hell hell
[17:40] with the prophets say not even your
[17:42] worst enemies you wish that you must go
[17:45] there this is the battle that you are
[17:47] fighting now now we are going to talk
[17:49] about today just just a little bit to
[17:51] say okay fine we have seen how the
[17:53] battle is supposed to set we said we
[17:55] have understand what the battle is we
[17:57] understand who are the people that were
[17:59] over there two groups we spoke last time
[18:01] about the two spirit there's two forces
[18:03] only the first of God and the force of
[18:05] the devil there's no other force
[18:06] there's not many forces only two you are
[18:08] either this side or this side we are
[18:10] fighting we are saying in this battle
[18:12] you either kill or you are killed that's
[18:16] not the rule of this bedroom you add a
[18:18] swim or you you do drown you think right
[18:23] that is what we are fighting for this
[18:24] day and let me tell you something let me
[18:27] just make it happy just before if we
[18:29] proceed what if the wonderful thing
[18:31] about this bedroom that's an exciting
[18:33] element about this is that this battle
[18:36] you are already current deed of the
[18:38] outcome you already know the outcome
[18:42] huh I like that some not the brother
[18:44] from tinder scene he says it tiny t has
[18:48] 108 any ts1
[18:51] you know the song you know tell me tell
[18:54] me tell me too
[18:55] he's talking about time and eternity he
[18:57] says tell me my friend who's going to
[18:59] win today huh attendance is no eternity
[19:03] as one because Jesus has come eternity
[19:06] has won that's what me and you know
[19:09] today the better outcome has already
[19:12] predetermined it's already known but the
[19:16] enemy because he hasn't got the element
[19:18] of the from the Lord Jesus Christ
[19:21] which you're going to talk about now the
[19:22] ones that you keep you and me to just to
[19:26] verify you know when they say you are
[19:27] verifying they mean you are just
[19:29] bringing a paper to try to verify to the
[19:32] bank that is you is you this account is
[19:35] yours the other thing is not you account
[19:37] they're saying just come over with your
[19:39] identity to verify your account the
[19:42] other things not your account so all we
[19:44] are doing here on earth we are just here
[19:46] for a process of verification to
[19:49] manifest who we are because he saw us
[19:51] before the foundation of them and he
[19:53] fought and he defeated Lucifer and he
[19:56] kicked him down to earth he's that goal
[19:59] let's go fight down on earth you'll find
[20:02] a part of me there and I'm going to show
[20:04] you again that I would be Fiji also they
[20:06] came to the cross also repeat that even
[20:09] he went to there and he went to even he
[20:11] took the keys huh so he's got no more
[20:15] keys now I can't control so he's
[20:17] powerless another Isaac studied very
[20:19] clear and and Brad at that time I
[20:21] thought if we go out there we just meet
[20:23] the devil and just show you that you are
[20:25] a bluff lastly you bless me so much
[20:28] because what you said is the truth
[20:29] nothing else I told you not that I said
[20:32] is that there's nothing to adjust what
[20:34] you say or to amend it or to spice it
[20:39] it's just simply the truth we are God
[20:42] and if you believe what you want to do
[20:48] you will do it it will come to pass
[20:50] because the others give another
[20:52] capability I'm deviating again to his
[20:54] message because it blessed me so very
[20:57] much
[20:58] why are you saying this about what the
[21:00] Isaac's message because one of the
[21:01] biggest elements that we need the
[21:04] Prophet says God has got an atomic bomb
[21:09] the mother of all Bernstein is there in
[21:11] the USA I saw it but that one our one
[21:15] that is the baby one the one for some
[21:17] it's the baby Bob the Lord just whatever
[21:20] atomic bomb a mighty one that when you
[21:24] blow the devil is an understatement to
[21:28] say that he just that demystified is an
[21:32] understatement
[21:34] of all weapons the Prophet says it is
[21:38] called FAI th ah it's called faith but
[21:44] faith is an atomic bomb for God and went
[21:47] ahead of myself anyway I said we said
[21:51] that okay we we now understand how the
[21:53] battle must be fought we need to
[21:55] understand now what do we need in this
[21:58] battle what I've just mentioned now
[22:01] first one is that atomic bomb we need
[22:04] that atomic bomb and it comes from the
[22:06] Lord doesn't come from us God gives it
[22:08] God gives you the faith to believe him
[22:11] that is why he says no one can come unto
[22:14] me except the father calls him I always
[22:18] said to my children he said the Lord ask
[22:22] anything and you shall be given right
[22:24] isn't it Rebecca
[22:25] that's what he said right and then he
[22:27] said no I said what do you want you see
[22:31] me that we are fighting is so screwed
[22:35] to a point that he can even blame your
[22:40] realization of what you need
[22:42] does anybody get me did you catch me he
[22:46] is not dangerous that he can bear your
[22:48] understanding your realization that oh
[22:51] no no no I actually meet this let me
[22:54] show you in this way what I'm trying to
[22:55] say is I'm sitting there I'm praying
[22:59] let's say I realize that I don't have
[23:01] joy now I see I don't have joy I can I'm
[23:05] not happy I'm touching me I'm just I'm
[23:11] not if I've got Chinese happiness now
[23:14] instead of me not proceeding being
[23:18] unhappy all I need to do is to real
[23:21] that God said I can ask him happiness
[23:25] huh he said ask me anything
[23:27] he didn't say ask me those things that
[23:29] you can do is that if it ask me anything
[23:34] sometimes you realize that you are
[23:36] lacking here but you you're not asking
[23:38] God but he's not ask me anything
[23:41] even that small thing that you think
[23:43] does not matter that's more small thing
[23:47] except that you don't have it you need
[23:50] it ask him believe it using the atomic
[23:56] amen
[23:57] now we we discussed and said there are
[24:02] three seconds in that one which is faith
[24:05] or doubt situated there then we said the
[24:08] inner one the middle one where we find
[24:11] memory imagination reasoning and outer
[24:14] one you find the other five senses we
[24:16] said that the first two outer layers
[24:19] they are not the right ones to use when
[24:23] you fight this enemy because him he went
[24:27] for training God also can come because
[24:36] that's where the Spirit is what can use
[24:38] them but God specializes in just one one
[24:42] faith now the devil tries you see we are
[24:49] believers we need can I put it this way
[24:54] can I say you must believe in your face
[24:58] you must believe in faith your faith you
[25:01] must believe in your faith that it will
[25:02] work in as much as you must be with you
[25:06] put a doubt you must doubt your doubts
[25:08] you must doubt it your doubt that the
[25:12] enemy will not overcome you but the Lord
[25:14] that the Lord can help you that faith
[25:16] that we have you must believe in that
[25:18] faith let me remind you of it and door
[25:22] within a door
[25:23] who knows that message whereas the
[25:25] kisses I see a will tell you within a
[25:27] wheel so know now you know our faith
[25:34] in simple terms what I'm trying to say
[25:36] is that believing in your page you need
[25:39] to be able to exercise your pain you
[25:41] last week we had that faith without
[25:44] works huh a car without at all it's just
[25:48] as beautiful good-for-nothing it is
[25:51] worse than my 1966 Mazda 3 to 3 that is
[25:56] full of petrol can take me from yes to
[26:00] the command review Toronto but in
[26:03] Mercedes na c63 what do you call top of
[26:08] the range no Kazumi with the lastly
[26:11] shaky I'm happy there's no one with the
[26:13] Mercedes integer so it can't take me to
[26:17] and repair oh it can't take me not even
[26:20] two apart from here
[26:21] but you said a wonderful one people
[26:23] passes there's a while but it can take
[26:26] anyway but is babies or twigs where
[26:29] don't save you you cannot use gasoline
[26:32] from here today you need a car but that
[26:35] come must be full of petrol now this
[26:38] phase that we need that's another
[26:40] element of this atomic bomb right now we
[26:46] believe we hear the way comes through
[26:50] our mind we process it then we we now
[26:53] goes down to our hearts I'm not
[26:57] correcting what I said last time what
[26:59] I'm trying to say is that in as much as
[27:01] we hear from the outside let me say to
[27:04] in actual fact they really hear you we
[27:08] hear from inside ah it comes we hear
[27:12] with this physical ear by the time we
[27:15] think that we are hearing and we believe
[27:17] God has done something already that is
[27:19] going to come from the inside outside
[27:21] the preferences it comes from the inside
[27:23] where faith come the time you say no no
[27:27] no what you are telling me as ah I'm not
[27:28] hearing you I've already refused what
[27:30] you are telling me you understand what
[27:32] I'm trying to say so faith comes by
[27:34] hearing hearing the word of God now and
[27:36] God is the one who gives us the faith to
[27:38] be
[27:39] and then we add on that to our mind it
[27:42] come the problem is this that our enemy
[27:45] tries to block it before it can go down
[27:49] there you see that's where the battle is
[27:52] because he specializes in the first and
[27:54] the second ring where it is reasoning
[27:57] when there is an imagination he just
[28:00] shows you things that I impossible
[28:02] he shows much do you ever believe that
[28:05] people will you people like this people
[28:09] will be taken and go high and change we
[28:11] didn't I take a look up and I come on
[28:13] the tractor is he hasn't gone down there
[28:16] he's trying to block it right he's
[28:19] trying to block the atomic bomb of God
[28:21] using his area of speciality by
[28:24] reasoning memory huh he can even do
[28:28] miracles in those areas huh he can do
[28:31] miracles the devil but because we are
[28:34] equipped by our Heavenly Father we are
[28:36] able to detect that is where Martin
[28:39] Luther is it Martin Luther San Martin
[28:41] when that angel in the dream came how
[28:44] many remember that huh he would see that
[28:48] he's already wearing a crown how come
[28:52] what kind of these of King is this one
[28:54] who's already crown but the Bible says
[28:55] the Saints are going to crown e-even
[28:57] King of Kings so we put those eyes that
[29:00] God has given us to see that this one is
[29:04] the devil we must be able in this battle
[29:07] to be able to detect to see this one
[29:10] it's not my sister doing this thing
[29:12] that's the devil amen amen and then then
[29:15] the prophecies yeah now the battle was
[29:18] messed up with Blas ray he's busy raging
[29:22] Eve is the one who allowed it our our
[29:25] mother Eve is the one who allowed the
[29:28] better by do you watch by listening to
[29:31] the devil not even accepting yet just to
[29:35] listen so let's just have a lesson of
[29:39] learning how not to listen to the
[29:43] reasons of the dinner how not to listen
[29:45] to the devil cooking
[29:47] is that I'm saying to you learn how to
[29:49] protect your own thoughts ah let me how
[29:54] to reject your own thoughts meaning that
[29:55] in your heart we are able to sit was
[29:57] that in the inner circle is not powerful
[29:59] so powerful that it can overcome the two
[30:02] other circles which can say hey that's
[30:04] reasoning
[30:05] that's not my sort out that is a good
[30:07] store good out if you don't have what
[30:11] God has given you you are not able to do
[30:13] that so we stand God so much that he has
[30:15] given us so and we can experience teach
[30:18] our children when I was a boy I
[30:20] struggled so much to know which one is
[30:26] in the better that's exactly where he
[30:28] wanted me yeah he wants you where you
[30:31] cannot realize him but the day you
[30:35] realized the devil he supposed right so
[30:38] he does not want you to know he'll ever
[30:40] come to you and and pretend as if he is
[30:42] God now and memory thoughts it was
[30:47] suicide
[30:48] amen those are from the devil now I
[30:51] wanna do something here for you
[30:53] then and hey okay I spoke about cliches
[30:57] I spoke about memory and all those
[30:59] things and I say and he uses them and
[31:02] then so that if you listen to him like
[31:04] it deed and then that's why he sleep
[31:07] under defeat by the time you realize
[31:10] that you are you were already on his
[31:12] side you're already fighting against
[31:14] your brothers and sisters you're
[31:16] fighting against yourself
[31:18] amen so now let's let's pick you go to
[31:21] the ammunition we spoke about faith and
[31:24] you say that and in order for this
[31:27] battle to be able to be when you're in
[31:30] the battlefront you need em the Prophet
[31:32] says they make Sarah says no we don't
[31:34] need that's not used a 22 rifle let's
[31:36] let's use the atomic bomb what squad say
[31:38] what atomic bomb now faith in what in
[31:43] myself faith in what I can do today I
[31:47] can do it I can drive I can I can I can
[31:51] run I can write I can
[31:53] no no faith in God's Way
[31:56] you see that's what he says he says we
[31:58] need to hey who's got atomic bomb which
[32:00] is faith in God's Way and a to have
[32:02] faith in God's Word it does not just
[32:04] come like when they give you the pizza
[32:06] at that show Domino's know it comes by
[32:11] Yalie
[32:12] how do you hear the word of God you just
[32:15] take a book anybody can read anyone can
[32:18] take the Bible read but you need to read
[32:21] with the eyes of faith when you read
[32:24] your Bible when you read the spoken with
[32:26] you are listening in with the eyes and
[32:28] the ears of faith you are listening with
[32:30] that you know hey okay this children I
[32:33] can give that example but you know it
[32:35] happened in awhile you know I have been
[32:38] except the wipe except the husband's
[32:41] right we are accepting you know we
[32:43] accepting you listen with the es of
[32:45] attitude of saying I want to listen our
[32:48] and tracks X not okay wait before I even
[32:52] finish when someone has said before I
[32:53] even finish you already said no in your
[32:55] mind no no that's not the ears that I'm
[32:57] talking the ears and the mind of God and
[33:00] the eyes we have is the eyes of thing
[33:02] come Lord I'm all yours Sodom those look
[33:06] that's when your faith grows that's when
[33:09] you are to me one becomes more stronger
[33:11] that's when you are able to realize the
[33:14] enemy when he come when you can see that
[33:17] this is the devil
[33:18] this is then you can fight better but
[33:21] another ammunition
[33:22] laughs now brother spoke about it this
[33:25] one is just Emmaline itself the aspect
[33:28] of love because somewhere in the Bible
[33:31] this is that any dirty of that charity
[33:34] you can have all the things but you've
[33:37] got no charity the charity that I'm
[33:39] talking about in as much as our our
[33:41] worldly charity is wonderful I love our
[33:44] charity on earth so God given one but
[33:47] I'm talking about the charity for God
[33:49] who can tell me which one is that one
[33:51] which love is that one a Coppola that's
[33:55] the charity for God to love the
[33:57] unlovable
[33:58] because what is the use of life you only
[34:01] those who loves you because even the
[34:03] sinners can love those that love them
[34:05] huh our God the devil only loves do
[34:09] I wonder even if he laughs I wonder I
[34:12] doubt I doubt this doubt I doubt that he
[34:15] loves those that better on your side
[34:18] because he's taking them to help you we
[34:22] need to be able to love the unlovable to
[34:26] lab where they does not see much to be a
[34:28] lab you know that is a powerful
[34:30] ammunition but it until the Bible says
[34:33] God is love
[34:35] right ah Coppola now that love is so
[34:40] strong that me who was in sin and
[34:44] iniquity unsavable
[34:46] he loved me you Mizzou that love for one
[34:52] another you must use that love not only
[34:54] for brothers and sisters en Church who
[34:56] must use that love even for our
[34:58] neighbors use that love for people when
[35:00] I was 3 I found myself praying for the
[35:03] people on my street that God give me a
[35:05] brother nd now I think this thing's
[35:07] moving give me something to eat can
[35:13] lower and can know you through me that's
[35:15] the kind of love that that we need to
[35:17] have for God so loved the world he's not
[35:21] talking about the cosmos the planet when
[35:24] he says he loved the world it means that
[35:27] he loved the people on to save them now
[35:33] we are his wife we are part of him we
[35:36] need to be like that we the Word of God
[35:39] will bring us to full maturity to build
[35:42] a bit without us making any effort think
[35:45] about it let us quickly just backtrack
[35:47] to Abraham in closing I was thinking to
[35:51] myself
[35:52] imagine if Abraham did not use that term
[35:57] iqbal of faith just just for a foot of
[36:01] thought what could have happen do you
[36:03] think he would have got Isaac what what
[36:06] where would where would everything be
[36:08] now who whose children were we going to
[36:11] be cold because we are our hands telling
[36:13] us by faith now today me and you sitting
[36:18] Abraham never believed if Abraham never
[36:21] he
[36:22] Abraham was not that soldier that stutes
[36:23] and use that coming bomb to blow off the
[36:26] devil to believe against hope to believe
[36:30] against unbelievable things unbelievable
[36:33] we say in science who says unbelievable
[36:36] that the man of so many years can never
[36:38] tell
[36:39] head off that's how we speak so if
[36:43] that's what a lot to me boy
[36:46] plus it blows the devil to a point that
[36:50] he could say this is me and I know this
[36:56] guy how I was pushing him around in the
[36:58] world for him but he does not realize
[37:03] that I've just bitten him with an atomic
[37:05] bomb that's how we fight this bedroom
[37:08] back to life who talked about only these
[37:10] two ammunitions there's plenty of
[37:11] ammunitions plenty of them from
[37:14] suffering patients you read the book of
[37:17] Pizza he talks about them you read about
[37:19] you read in the book of Timothy there's
[37:21] a lot and loss and loss of ammunition
[37:23] but it's true that I'm talking about
[37:25] these are the most important and basic
[37:27] ones not more important than others but
[37:30] is that a very fundamental and important
[37:32] ones that me and you must make sure that
[37:35] to win these battles we need to have
[37:38] them and if you don't have them no
[37:40] crisis and then you give it to you in
[37:49] closing we've got a general at the
[37:54] beginning we said and we said the Lord
[38:00] Jesus what did I say the beginning I
[38:03] forgot but the point is this that I want
[38:05] to tell you that way I said to you that
[38:07] you already have a current it's outcome
[38:10] of the war why because he is not
[38:13] fighting the war in absentia I'm not on
[38:15] borrowed time we agree the beginners
[38:18] remember
[38:20] now there isn't why we already have an
[38:24] outcome is because he you sell his
[38:27] thought and passion of this war he is
[38:30] with you remember you he said he said to
[38:31] Joshua I will be with you don't look to
[38:34] the left or to the right
[38:35] remember and the number one Georgia was
[38:37] there just about to take over he
[38:39] appeared with the sword and he said
[38:42] unknown on the captain is alone then he
[38:44] he worshiped you remember his right
[38:46] through the Bible is there even today he
[38:48] is yeah
[38:49] he's not a captain that fights in
[38:52] absence all with me and you need to do
[38:55] is to realize who we are to realize the
[38:58] battle that we are fighting to realize
[39:00] the ammunition that we have to realize
[39:02] the machine guns that we have to take
[39:05] them and put them in full use my advice
[39:09] not one business we've got a weak
[39:13] point as believers and I said I'm
[39:15] thinking to myself with what a weak
[39:17] point as believers we think but we can
[39:19] fight this battle on a pattern basis
[39:22] when the enemy is fighting and 24 hours
[39:27] he's busy he's planning crippling
[39:31] reviewing changing the ammunition we
[39:36] want to do it business
[39:40] want to read our Bible part-time want to
[39:43] pray part-time want to want to you know
[39:46] take time that's two seats I was saying
[39:49] to my daughter
[39:49] oh and meditate about God just think
[39:54] about you you say that doesn't he save
[39:59] in the book of some faith and you
[40:02] meditate about him just one the more you
[40:06] meditate about him he comes closer it
[40:10] was you engaging with the captain you
[40:14] are engaged you in the captain you are
[40:16] talking to your husband about things you
[40:18] tell you your husband I was just
[40:21] thinking about you have you ever seen
[40:23] look after James sister Nadine and he
[40:26] says one he says no I'm just looking at
[40:28] you and I was just thinking about you
[40:31] that is how the Lord Jesus is doing to
[40:34] us is that he wants us to take time in
[40:37] our busy schedule you children today to
[40:41] think about God to meditate about the
[40:44] Bible says day and but I'm missing some
[40:50] time in your day allocate time not day
[40:53] and night do it
[40:54] I would like you to do it but because we
[40:57] want we are busy and the Prophet gave us
[41:00] the mission he said plant our potatoes
[41:01] meat was we're busy planting potatoes
[41:03] right so that in the Lottery's tomorrow

[42:10] ready yes indeed you are telling you
[42:14] because it means so much to you don't
[42:17] you ask yourself why the prophet priest
[42:19] a message concerned and then convinced
[42:24] because this means so much to you it
[42:28] means so much if only God can give us
[42:31] the realization of what he means to us
[42:33] of what he is to us of what what what
[42:37] actually has transpired for us to find
[42:39] ourselves to be where we are today we
[42:42] will realize that we will do three four
[42:45] ten times what we are doing and what is
[42:48] nice that we are not doing ourselves
[42:49] he's doing it for us he's doing it
[42:53] through us all he does just anoint you
[42:56] with his presence
[42:58] oops that the ball goes there you run
[43:01] that is why if you do things for God you
[43:04] sit down later already become your
[43:06] physical just ah you realize that only
[43:09] then you realize that you are tired but
[43:12] the Holy Spirit when is in you you don't
[43:14] even realize that you are hungry you
[43:17] don't realize it I don't know to break
[43:20] but I didn't eat today
[43:22] I was just three and I said god help me
[43:24] help me but now I'm speaking like I'll
[43:27] just finish my dinner I don't want the
[43:29] food because you want to be in the
[43:32] presence of God and if soon or later the
[43:34] presence of God takes over and you're
[43:36] just in Jubilee records in the Train
[43:39] then just let it see you laughing she

[43:53] thank you Lord Jesus if you have your
[43:55] your you are in Jubilee amen
[43:57] so now my long finish short story is
[44:00] that in every battle
[44:02] there must be progress yep this is the
[44:07] closing now closing remarks in every
[44:09] battle there must be a progress you
[44:12] don't want a child who's eating every
[44:14] day you know that little boy of mine
[44:16] name his name is Liam imagine eating me
[44:23] they eat they yeah in yeah I'm sorry to
[44:29] you as an example my boy but he's
[44:31] growing and we we see the SL going by
[44:35] there's no progress on this chart you
[44:38] will see there's a problem with a child
[44:39] you take him to the highest specialist
[44:41] in New Zealand to check the Parisian
[44:44] what's wrong with this child is
[44:46] everything is fine with you in spirit
[44:48] nicely but is not growing when we are in
[44:53] a better we need to be
[44:55] able to see that a at an immediate that
[44:58] one is eliminated out let's next then
[45:03] you can see I am not where I'm supposed
[45:04] to be but I'm not where I used to be
[45:07] that's when you are able to be able to
[45:10] say me a testimony that God have done
[45:12] this and this and gifts for me I may not
[45:15] be where I'm supposed to be but I'm not
[45:17] where I used to be
[45:18] why am I not where I used to be because
[45:21] that one out I don't like what's up
[45:24] anymore more than the way
[45:26] I don't like Facebook I don't like I
[45:29] don't like this and this and this that
[45:31] you know you used to do I don't like
[45:34] this anymore
[45:35] none of that I used to hate that brother
[45:39] but you know child you don't have such
[45:40] problems I'm just to do general that
[45:44] thing that I used to like but be oh I
[45:47] thought I'll never split with these
[45:48] separate but it's gone have you never
[45:52] one on something and you see how did it
[45:56] happen and you are surprised that's what
[46:00] I'm talking about progress in this
[46:01] bedroom you need to be able to see the
[46:03] progress that I am it and that progress
[46:06] cannot just come it come when you apply
[46:09] all this ammunition and you should you
[46:14] shoot and you eat your way you eat your
[46:17] way you meditator you need to do eat in
[46:19] English they say you must be consistent
[46:23] if in a car if he's driving
[46:26] if the petrol flow is not consistent it
[46:29] will cut we say Jenny Mike hours Jake
[46:33] uses the Christian borrowed me the
[46:34] silver because there was a problem maybe
[46:36] with an injection or the petrol car it
[46:38] was not the problem
[46:39] he's faced now it goes no cutting now
[46:43] because it's consistent we need to be
[46:45] consistent we need to fight for
[46:47] consistent but all that has a priest one
[46:49] time about fight I like you so much
[46:52] he's a fight and a fight you must you
[46:56] must keep up with the fight you must
[46:58] have that resilience and if you don't
[47:00] have that resilience what do you do you
[47:03] ask
[47:04] no problem you need something you don't
[47:08] have it you ask me realize that you want
[47:11] this and for you to get this you need
[47:13] distance anyone for this then one give
[47:16] you so that you can get this all you do
[47:19] you ask and you shall be given you don't
[47:22] have the right shoe you can walk with
[47:25] the left soooo you ask then God gives in
[47:29] you're good to see you realize that you
[47:31] can talk properly or you realize
[47:33] anything I am trying to simplify
[47:35] anything but you realize that you need
[47:39] something in order for you to get
[47:40] something you don't ask for this even
[47:42] just a set one to get this before yet
[47:44] you ask for that one that's what you
[47:46] need to do ask anything as even the Lord
[47:50] to reveal to you what you don't know
[47:52] that you must ask
[47:54] I always just know ask me what you will
[47:59] know that you must ask if you read in
[48:01] the book of Romans chapter eight from a
[48:03] subject he says the holy spirit
[48:06] intercede for us he even talk about us
[48:10] the things that we need that you don't
[48:12] know us so many things we don't know
[48:15] that we need or we can we must have and
[48:18] we don't ask for them and the enemy will
[48:22] try his level best
[48:24] so that you know that if you ask you'll
[48:27] believe it in your head so you cover it
[48:29] as much as possible so we are the
[48:31] Watchers pose them just like our errors
[48:34] our mistakes he can expose them not just
[48:38] pose you let's pose them so that you can
[48:41] confess them before you because if you
[48:44] confess when you call the name of the
[48:46] Lord he answers you
[48:48] you see that is as simple as that
[48:51] this one even my little Libya can do
[48:54] Delhi is easy this Michael let us jump
[48:58] enough may God bless solution they need
[49:03] to be a growth they need to be tangible
[49:06] progress not an imaginary one they need
[49:09] to be a progress which we say
[49:13] you know one day the Prophet the Lord
[49:16] helped him and he was just new in his
[49:20] ministry and he went to this house
[49:22] fixing the gas pipes and everything him
[49:24] and this lady who was sick
[49:27] swear to me code names about this matter
[49:31] if someone can show you with your mother
[49:34] it's a terrible thing no the Prophet
[49:38] said that day I knew that the Holy Ghost
[49:40] and that I have is real because that's
[49:44] the progress I'm talking about that you
[49:46] need to be able to look back and say ha
[49:48] I'm used to be here I'm here by the
[49:52] grace of God
[49:53] yeah I take it that means yet you're
[49:58] going some way you are eliminating the
[50:01] little attendants you are eliminating
[50:03] the we are fighting a good fight
[50:04] amen that is way out left to stop I just
[50:09] wanna I just want to talk to the Lord I
[50:14] just continued at the beginning because
[50:16] I thought with a brief description last
[50:18] time but the script the bay scripture
[50:20] for this someone that will be busy with
[50:22] tonight is the book of Ephesians you
[50:25] know about it I read it last time for
[50:27] you so I didn't read it today I thought
[50:29] we can just hit the ground running but
[50:32] the official chapter 5 and then chapter
[50:35] 6 sorry for this chain remember I read
[50:37] it past 17 I went to space 18 19 them
[50:40] and then also the book of Peter first
[50:43] Peter chapter 5 so those are our base
[50:45] clip just which we can go and enjoy and
