morning amen that same God that Parts seas and stops rivers and changes storms Into Sunshine is living inside you amen hallelujah amen hallelujah oh let's just sit down and share some testimonies amen I'm sure there's a testimony in this place there's a testimony in here don't be afraid God will bless you if you can bless somebody and us with your testimony something that the Lord has done for you in the last little while that you would like to share with the congregation come brother Morning Saints morning uh this is a a very small story but it's just how good God really is and how he helps you it's it's something absolutely to the normal human he'll just think silly but it mattered to me so I was working and uh I work on the roads and it's it's always heavy equipment that we're working with and we've got this trailer and it's got a they call it a wacker just beats the ground up and down it's just all it is it's a wacker it's whack stuff and but it's heavy it's absolutely very very heavy and the one Foreman tells me to go to the the trailer take this whack and just throw it on the truck now the trucks are pretty high and I thought oh Lord you know my my back's not feeling too strong today you know you know when when you know it's not I'm not comfortable in my body so I walk into this um trailer and I'm standing inside there and the thought comes to mind just pray about it I I'll just pray and ask him to help me because if I hurt my back I can't work if I don't work I don't get paid it's just how it is you know so I walk into the trailer now I'm standing there and most of the people that that I work with is is is not Believers so they won't understand what I'm going through but I'm standing in the trailer by the way be known to myself and I take my helmet off and I take my beanie off and I just start praying I said Lord I know I'm not going to do it but I need to get this thing on there and get to the site where I need to be just help me and as I pray someone walks into the the box guard and it's a it's absolutely a young man very nice and he walks in as I'm praying so I get startled because you know you're praying but I just hear that because the thing is a bit unstable and I just stable and I look at this guy and he goes are you all right I said yeah I was just pray cuz that's what I was doing and he goes oh okay cool I said yeah cuz I need to lift this thing up there and it's heavy and I just don't have the power to do it today you know and he goes no I'll help you and I'll lift it up and I said yeah praise the Lord he send me you and and then a half an hour later he comes to me and he says when he was a teenager he lost his religion which which was kind of very sore but it was one moment where he could open up and I said but you don't need to lose it you know cuz you never lost it in the first place you just need to find it again you know you just need to find him and that's all I had to say but see that whole situation but known to myself was for him amen you know so praise the Lord so if you need to pray if you feel you need to pray pray that's right you never know what God's doing you never know so yeah just praise the Lord amen thank you praise the [Applause] Lord for our friends that are streaming in you don't have to be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might praise God hey man I'm so bad at giving testimonies see this is what you get He Man pure not only that I'm really nervous cuz when Andy said that I was like oh I had something on my heart but man it's hard day so okay if it's going to help someone amen cuz it's help me you have to bear with me though that's why I give okay if anyone doesn't know me I actually have happy tears and if I didn't have tears my head would pop off so it's better to see tears than to see what's in my head okay well so um okay I did share it with a few people um anyway so the supernatural uh subconscious Series has been such a blessing um now Andy shared whole lot when he gave that um when he gave the series and sometimes you know you there's so much you can't really take it all in because it's man it's overwhelming but it was interesting because it opened up a door when you when you say Lord I I don't actually know what I need which I don't um but when there's stuff in your subconscious that you grow up with that happen to you um you can just say it it actually gives you a doorway a door to open and so you can say which I did Lord I'm just I'm I'm really a dumb sheep you know I go and nibble the grass and then I want the grass inside the other padic you know and I don't actually know what I need and I don't know what's happened to me in the past so I don't know how to fix it and I don't know what it is so if there is anything which you I didn't even know there was if there is anything show me and then fix it what you did so um so I'll just give a little testimony um uh one night um and this is not my character I got really jealous okay I'm not competitive Isaac just doesn't like me because I'm not competitive we'll play a game and I'll just let him win you know and it really irks him I'm not competitive I don't get angry I certainly don't get jealous and I have never gotten jealous in my entire life um and I got really jealous one night and that made me angry I got jealous over eyes and I don't get jealous over people and um and I was basing and I was just upset and I don't deal with anger because I don't get angry and I was I was just like I don't know what's going on but I'm so upset and I don't know why and um oh I kind of knew why and I was like um and I was like well I'm actually really jealous but I've never felt this emotion before and I don't know how to deal with it and um and then as time progressed um we we ended up going into prayer and in prayer I realized that um okay here we go so my grandma who was like my life when I was growing up my um my parents split up when I was about five and that's normal I would probably rather them be split up and be with what they were together anyways so there there was a broken in the home and then my grandma who was my life oh man she spoiled me rotten talk about giving me lollies when I came in dresses big hugs you know she just was my life she was my everything and um so she was there when my my parents split up and for me and everything like that well she ended up getting lung cancer and um so she died when I was about 5 years old um and then I didn't realize but at that moment as a child you to brace yourself to to protect yourself after she died I put up a wall no one could get in and it was a protective layer really and it served me well actually I I didn't actually love anybody um I didn't let anybody oh thank you I know I tell people I need to go around with the towel okay I'm going to speed this up a bit um but I I never let anybody in I never so when when I thought of my parents I thought oh well if they die you know I'll just I could carry on it won't affect me and then when I married Isaac I thought um oh you know if he died you know it won't affect me I'll just carry on and um but that night I realized the reason why I was never jealous is because I never love something so much and when I let the Lord in my heart that was easy you know I could I could he was easy to come in cuz he cleared everything out um it was um 21 and the Lord came into my heart I met him because I was considered myself an atheist but I met the Lord Jesus Christ and he was easy to let in but then to let another person come in was a little bit different and it wasn't until um about a month or two ago I think about a month sorry um that I actually let my husband in my heart um and I think you know I I loved my husband but there was always like a a barrier of protection there and um so yeah so I let him I let him in and um oh it just hasn't been the same since it's a bit hard because a thing of jealousy will come and I'm like oh I don't like this I feel like a silly little girl you know oh I don't actually enjoy it but um but it's actually made our marriage um well for me it's made it pretty amazing um yeah so I just thank the Lord because I think it's he doesn't put it on us everything at once but he just shows us little as a time and if we just open ourselves to him and say Lord I don't actually know what's going on but if you show me what I have to deal with and then he comes and fixes it for us oh it's amazing so yeah the Lord's doing amazing stuff so I'm really blessed you that was my testimony ah made it through amen praise the Lord amen amen is there anybody else like to share that must have been the Lord's leading amen amen definitely yes sometimes you get a bit nervous when you kind of feel led in you do you do it or do you not do it but you just got to be obedient you know amen hallelujah that's so good to allow the Lord in uh I got a small testimony um it's just the Lord's protection and it's actually if you if you were in if you were experiencing what I experienced you would really um understand and if you're a builder or you're in the trade you would understand a bit more but I was at this job and um I was using this saw and these saws is like this big box thing and it's got a big blade that spins really fast and if it touches you it'll cut you you know it'll mutilate you and and I'm putting this piece of Timber through the saw and the stand is not the right stand for it it doesn't actually connect to the stand properly and I'm putting it through and it's this really hard product and the sore bit into this product and and the product within one second the product was way back on the back wall was was this big heavy plank just on the back wall put a massive hole in the wall and the saw flew towards me like that and went and landed on the ground and I don't know what happened it was kind of like a flashh just a flashh and the saw was on the ground and I was just standing there and like this if most cases I should have been opened up you know dead because this was serious but the Lord protected me amen amen so we can have confidence in the fact that the Lord protects us amen always pray for his protection amen every day for you your family your friends everybody pray for protection it works amen hallelujah all right let's stand and we'll sing a couple of songs get ready for the word who's excited about the word this morning amen hallelujah oh I'm you so glad we have these testimonies God is so real hallelujah amen let's go to I would rather have Jesus

trust you feel at home amen praise the Lord all our sins are washed away amen amen um so I heard from um I I sent a message to brother Greg Alford down in Christ Church and he said they're all a bit soggy down there but everyone's fine so praise the Lord so that's good um if you got your Bibles handy let's just go to uh Matthew chapter 22 we're going to read Matthew 22:1 down to verse 10 and Jesus answered and spake unto them again by Parables and said the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto like unto a certain King which made a marriage for his son and sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding and they would not come again he sent forth other servants saying tell them which are bidden behold I have prepared my dinner my oxen and my fatlings are killed and all things are ready come unto the marriage but they made light of it and went their ways one to his farm the other to his merchandise and the remnant took uh his servants and entreated them spitefully and slew them but when the king heard thereof he was wroth and sent forth his armies uh and destroyed those murderers burned up their City then said he to his servants the wedding is ready but they which are Bitten are not worthy go ye therefore into the highways and as many as you shall find B to the marriage and so the servants went out into the highways and gathered together all as many as they found both good and bad and the wedding was furnished with guests amen let's just um let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer shall we gracious Heavenly Father Lord there's many times when we approach you we feel very insufficient but Lord we thank you we do not need to look at our own s but Lord we look at you and father just your great power and majesty and father how great you are to us Lord and we're just praying as we just open the pages of your word now we read some scripture but father we pray you just take your spirit Lord anoint your word father anoint speaker and hearer one more time Lord we just want to move ourselves out of the way that you can come in and take control of this meeting Lord we give it into your hands and father may you receive all glory honor and praise father we thank you you're the mighty one Lord Jesus you're Our Redeemer Lord You're our savior you're our Lord You're our King you're our husband and father we want to praise you this morning Lord bless those who couldn't be here today Lord be their strength and portion as well and father I pray you'd visit every heart today For Your Glory we ask in Jesus Christ Christ's name amen amen amen God bless you friends you may you may be seated I want to I want to deal with something this morning I want to speak about worthiness My Prayer by the end of this service is that everyone would have Supreme confidence that they can take any promise of God and say it belongs to me amen amen because there's always a there's always a challenge that that maybe I think maybe from our own human Frailty or the devil always tries to put it upon us are you really worthy and if we begin to look at our own s we just see our failures and our faults and you know and then we and then our faith begins to slip but if we can recognize this morning that every promise every promise has been given to us without money or price I mean everything we have need of in this Earthly Journey has been given to us amen all healing has been given salvation's been given Deliverance has been given amen a body change has been given overcoming power has been given amen perfect peace that pass us all understanding has been given joy unspeakable full of Glory has been given everything we have need of has been given amen there's been a full inheritance every remember this is this is the old it's an Old Testament and a new testament an old will and a new will am amen and we live we live in the pages of the new will amen amen so so a will has been given an inheritance has been laid up but then there Comes The Challenge now am I worthy to receive this will am I worthy to receive the contents of The Inheritance you know of the will receive my inheritance and I can say this morning by the authority of God's word we are worthy amen not because we have done anything but because what he has done amen so we should have full confidence everything in the Bible that belongs to me is mine amen and I will possess it it will become mine I will not rest until it becomes mine amen amen so we got to just knock out this whole thing I'm unworthy because he has made us worthy amen that's right Hallelujah you got to look at the promise you you go down through the Old Testament there's their failures there their sins there's their Humanity gets in the way you take Abraham you know he backslides a couple of times goes down out of the promise you know doesn't believe the promise fully and he and he takes you know he listens to Sarah takes Hagar and all those different things but yet when when God writes the commentary of his life in Romans he says he staggered not he staggered not at the promise of God but was strong in faith Hallelujah so now that that is that should be our our commentary of our life amen hallelujah and so now we need to I think I'm getting a bit large I can't wait hold on there we go I was going to feel at home Hallelujah let's just relax hallelujah amen so now we read there in the scripture well I'm going to read a quote to you this from brother brandham and he speaks he says here if I can find it now he begins to talk about praying for someone he says this the other day now now here's a here's a prophet thousands of thousands of visions and most Supernatural Ministry you'll ever find recorded in the history of man that's right Amen brother BR send the token message that Jesus did more in this ministry in this little place he did in the days of his flesh amen so the most incredible Ministry you know you just listen to one you know end of a service a prayer line or discernment you know and you can say this must be God he cannot know these things about these people and it's perfect every time Hallelujah but then so so here's but this is how he feels about himself so the other day over in a little place I was having a meeting in um in Topeka Kansas there was a boy a young preacher one of my first sponsors brother Roy sitting here remembers the place in this this great place this Minister uh got under a roof or a or a place the sidewall mashed him down beneath that the little fellow was going to die his liver was burst his spleen was knocked out of place tons fell on him I sat at breakfast talking to the wife I said wife you know if Jesus was here you know what he'd do uh I said when when he sponsored me I believe that word he was sponsoring Christ and I said that's the trick of the devil I said if Jesus was here he'd go lay his holy hands upon him that boy would get well I don't care if his liver burst bursted he would get well because Jesus would walk in there knowing exactly who he was he knowed his calling uh the scriptures was right vindicating in him that he knowed who he was and not no Shadow of Doubt he had lay his hands upon him he say son be well walk out of there and I said there isn't enough devils in hell to kill that boy then I said he would get well but I said you see honey he was Jesus the holy hands of God I said I'm a sinner I was born sexual birth my father and mother were both Sinners and I'm not uh I'm a no good nothing now he's putting himself as the category of no good nothing okay as I said incredible Ministry God stepped in he took a son redeemed son and revealed the son of man through him never seen a Ministry like it and he says I'm a no good nothing and I said you know what if the lord gave me a vision and sent me down there that would then that would be different I said I'd go down lay my hands on him he'd come out out of that bed if I if he give me a vision then I got to thinking because remember we know sometimes we we can sit back too much and say the Lord has to prompt me or show me certain things but we have the orders of the day go you into all the world and preach the gospel these signs shall follow them that believe you don't have to make them happen the life will produce them amen these signs shall follow them that believe who believes this morning that means you fit in that category Hallelujah it doesn't matter what the devil tries to say about that scripture it's ins fired I've seen it live people around the world have seen it live that's Mark 16 if you're not sure I said but then I got to thinking after all if it was the vision what was it it was the same dirty hands on him same man praying for him same dirty hands then I begin to think I am his representative then God doesn't see me that blood of that righteous one lays up there upon the altar it makes intercessions for me here is my sufficiency here is myay here's my life the only thing that would make me put my hands in him with faith is because I had faith in the vision and without the vision the same Faith would do the same thing Hallelujah so I can reckon myself nothing but reckon him my all and all he is my life he is my commissioner no denomination sent me he sent me Hallelujah I go in his name I'll lay my hands upon him walking down there and laid hands on that boy and that night he was in the meeting solid well amenallah Hallelujah it's the same thing with you and I friends we've been Mission am mean we''re been sent Hallelujah not by some church not by a group of man amen we've been sent by almighty God and mean you've been sent down into this time you are alive in this space of time for a reason not just because your parents wanted you or didn't want you or whatever more God made sure you were born here I mean in this time God made sure you wouldd hear this word there's a reason you're sitting here this morning Hallelujah not a haphazard thing God sent you here you've been commissioned Hallelujah Jeremiah had to be told before you're in your mother's womb I ordained you a prophet to the Nations Hallelujah and you got to look at yourself in the same way before you in your mother's womb I ordained you to be the bride of Christ I mean I ordained you to be Hallelujah made in my image amen hey it either is or it isn't amen and that's why I got to I got to tell you he say well that's quite a big commission if he's commissioned you he's enabled you to do it amen hallelujah amen he has made us Worthy yesen you got to knock out the well I've did this and I've did this and I've did this forget it amen doesn't matter what you do or what you what do you have done is what he has done hallelujah hallelujah cuz remember if you're trying to get on on your own good works you're going to take the good and the bad and the bad always outweighs the good amen so that's why brother B I couldn't find it but he says in one place I don't want to try and get into heaven on my Visions all the Miracles or my preaching I only want to get into heaven on the blood of Jesus Christ Hallelujah and so if the prophet of God can say that we should say that too amen don't don't look at what You' have done look at what he has doneen hallelujah hallelujah praise God amen amen now remember we read there in our opening text the king said they are unworthy the ones who are invited are unworthy to come and the reason they became unworthy is because they turned down the invitation amen but the ones he says get the good and the bad Oh Glory go into and and then there's another part this this uh Parable is told about in Luke 14: 16- 24 we won't read it today but you can go read it and there's and the and the servants go out three times and there's a call go into the and and the last one is just go into the highways and byways thank you Lord don't even go into who you think should come just go out Lord hallelujah find find the people my Feast must be full and so it's not the fact that the people had anything you going out to the highways and byways that's finding the you know the the you know the homeless people the destitute yeah I mean people who you wouldn't naturally have it a have it a fine wedding hey you'd want celebrity people at your wedding humanly thinking you want oh this person came or this person came you don't want strange Uncle Joe and this kind of we guy and this kind of part the family they'll tarnish the whole thing not in God's mind not in God's thinking he says just compel them to come and they'll come Hallelujah and the reason they're at the feast is they bidden and they accepted it amen not because they had anything good about themselves are you with me you say glory to God glory amen I've been invited Hallelujah more than invited I accepted and I'm here hallelujah I've been made in His image now I mean and the wedding isn't just to watch I mean watch someone get married you're the one that gets married you're the one gets United you understand amen down here we get United with Christ hallelujah hallelujah oh you shouldn't be so excited how could you not be excited imagine being on death row you know you're going to die the next day and the doors come open and someone comes in it says you're free amen not you just been forgiven you never did it in the first place you'd be happy Hallelujah you'd be happy amen it should be the same thing with us we should be the happiest people in all the world I trust there's a fire in your bones friend something you Hallelujah you say glory to God I've been invited and I say yes hallelujah hallelujah they were made worthy because they received the invitation right it has nothing to do with where they were before they came to the feast the only thing that matters they accepted amen it's not that oh can I go because oh but I'm this kind of person I'm I I you I I'm living on the street they'll never want me there or I did this in life and that's why I'm on the street and I made bad choices and this is where I am no that has nothing to do with it they said compel them to come amen they weren't told now go out and and ask them a few questions have you ever done this in life yes or no how about this on a scale of 1 to 10 put down how good you feel about yourself morally there's no record of those things cuz they didn't do it they just compelled they said come here's the invitation Hallelujah and it's the same thing you know Jesus laid out Parables like this cuz he wants you to understand I'm sending an invitation you just have to receive it doesn't matter how you feel about your condition hey if I got invited to some some big thing somewhere overseas that's how I'm going you know oh you going to Buckingham Palace or I know wherever you you think which is really cool I don't think the palace is could be know what I mean some big fancy thing you've got a you know some real fine Feast somewhere what do you mean I got two first class tickets I'm going here we're going to have this place and this food and we're going to go here and do I'd go he hey it's been paid for yeah there you go what about work oh now you got time off work that's all sort out you you don't need to worry oh well let's go honey should we go let's go you wouldn't be well I don't know will I fit in that bracket am I really you know you know what I mean you just receive you'd receive the invitation and you'd go how much more friends oh hallelujah thank you Lord how much more what we have now hallelujah hallelujah now let's go to Colossians chapter 1 I love the Lord we have been invited this message is the invitation amen I'm going to read this and we're just going to see where we're going to go today now 1 Corinthians chapter 1 and verse 8 uh Colossians yes Colossians sorry Colossians 1 and8 he says here who also declared unto us your love in the spirit we're just dropping halfway through what Paul's saying for this cause we also waiting for the Indian paper to settle down for this cause we also since the day we heard it do not cease to pray for you and to desire that you might be filled with the knowledge of his will and all wisdom and spiritual understanding that you might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God strengthen with all might according to his glorious power unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness giving thanks unto the Father which hath made us meat to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints and light who ha delivered us from the powers of dark power of Darkness pardon me and has translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have Redemption through his blood even the Forgiveness of sins amen so in verse 12 he has made us meat to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints and light he has made us meat not you not not you not you amen him you well I've heard this you need to probably might need to hear it again because there's a battle because we see how yo yo we look at the message we look at the word and we look at the Holiness life and we look at things and it and humanly it becomes rules and humanly it becomes well I've got to conform no he conforms you to it am mean you've got to yield yourself and good give yourself am mean and when you give yourself he'll take you and he'll mold you and he'll shape you Hallelujah so it's it's him that makes you worthy it's not you that make yourself worthy I'm probably going to repeat that many times cuz I wanted to sink down under the fifth rib on the left hand side and fill the whole cavity which is your heart by the way hallelu Hallelujah so he has made us meat now in the Old Testament okay I'll just stop here we brother Braham says in the token message full obedience to the word entitles you to the Token which is the life of God Amen which is the Holy Ghost in you I know it's all it's all kind of jargon but it's it's full obedience and then he says full obedience to the word of God is repent be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of sin and you shall receive the token you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost that is full obedience to the word because if you're fully repented your heart has been fully turned towards him and then you say Lord what would you have me do I want to live to please you and then everything else will come into place Hallelujah so now if you have and then brother Ram says if you have that token I mean you can you can put it into your house you can put it in your house amen you can claim your loved ones there's power in the life of God Amen so now but then now humanly we can shrink back and say well am I really worthy to to put that on display am I really worthy to enforce that amen and I say by the authority of God's word you are amen am mean why do you think it's come into you in the very first place I mean the life of God is not just to sitting you and be stagnant and sit still it's meant to go forth Hallelujah the first commandment given to man Adam and Eve even before they were placed into bodies they said multiply and replenish the Earth take the take the garden subdue it have dominion over the Earth expanded that's the life of God hallelujah the same thing when when God came into the 120 in the upper room wasn't just for them to stay what happened they were filled with the spirit of God they didn't stay there and say Glory Hallelujah right brother that's a good meeting they went out hallelujah hallelujah they couldn't stay in that room they went out Hallelujah the life went forth Hallelujah wants to expand wants to find other people thank you Jesus are you with me amen so it can't be contained and so now if you have that token in you you have the life of God in you it won't it can't sit still it can't sit it not you you it can't sit still amen amen it don't want to be placed where it should be placed amen we are instructed to get all the Liv out of the home yes when you apply the token so find all the unbelief find all the sin and get it out find all the anything it would be that's that displeasing to God and get it out of the home then apply the token and confidence Hallelujah so sure you got to do that part but if you've got that token on display you say well can I really place it over my children can I really place it over a loved one can I really go after them in prayer yes you can Hallelujah yes you can do it you've been commissioned to do it than Hallelujah prise God hey we've been commissioned friend we got a mighty thing eternal life must go forth amen eternal life goes from one to the other that's right amen Peter talking there on the day of Pentecost what happened eternal life went from him and 120 went to the 3,000 then he's there in cornelius's house he's preaching as he Peter spake these words eternal life fell upon them hallelujah amen it went from one to the other amen take what you have friends don't hide it under a bushel you'll set The Bushel on fire Hallelujah and then you won't be able to sit still anyway am hallelujah we're saying can I do these things yes you can you have a you have the authority you've been you've been commissioned God has called you for a purpose amen he has made you worthy Hallelujah we read in first uh first Ephesians we read in Ephesians it says and he hath made us to sit in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus so it's not you making yourself sit in Heavenly atmospheres he has made you amen he caused you to sit in a different realm Hallelujah that's why the believer gets excited about things and the unbeliever looks at them saying what are you so excited about this is just some dead religion no it's not some dead religion it's just some excitement oh no it's not just some excitement am mean this is something bubbling Hallelujah bubbling forth glory to God hallelujah you think when we're around the throne you know people say when I get over there then I'll really Let Go no let go down here show the victory of Calvary here hallelujah cuz the devil's here he's opposing you amen but you should be say Glory Hallelujah praise Him GL amen from your heart you can be quiet doesn't matter how it manifests but if your heart is bursting forth with joy you can be a quiet person that's fine amen you can be loud that's fine however however it manifest let it manifest hallelujah thank he has made us to sit in Heavenly places now in the Old Testament what was examined when The Sinner went with a sacrifice someone answer me this is now the sacrifice thank you very much the sacrifice was examined the sinner was not examined he said because he could go or she could go am I worthy to give this sacrifice well he W the the cner wasn't even Bor to wasn't even examined as soon as the priest laid hold eyes upon the the lamb or you know the Bullock or the go whereever it was the priest said okay you go over here I've got to examine this and that was examined and if that was examined the sinner was was was uh accepted am me their offering was accepted Hallelujah so the so so just say if I was in the Old Testament I did something I I bring a lamb to the priest the pressure is not on me you following me the pressure is not on me the pressure is on have I picked the right lamb is the Lamb is the Lamb going to be accepted cuz if that lamb is accepted I'm going to be accepted Hallelujah and then so the would look at the lamb and he would look at it and say it's perfect amen hallelujah GL and then now and then I placed my hand upon the head of that lamb and the priest kills that lamb and the life goes out of that lamb in my place and my sin is transferred onto that lamb Hallelujah then I can go away Justified you're following me amen amen so now it's the lamb that had to be perfect right now in the Old Testament the life of that lambing an animal could not come upon me and changed my nature so the thing that caused me to bring the offering in the first place I would leave with that same desire though I justified in the sight of God right but now our lamb I love our lamb he's a glorious lamb amen our lamb now he went there into Pilot's judgment Hall he was examined am Hallelujah he was examined and they say I find no fault in this man he is a perfect lamb Hallelujah took your sin that day up Calvary amen and so now we have a living we have a perfect lamb he didn't just die but he rose again Hallelujah he took his blood when he when he when he revealed himself to to Mary by the tomb he said don't touch me I haven't ascended up yet I haven't lifted the offering up Hallelujah then he ascends he comes back down says Thomas touched the holes in my hand and my side Hallelujah because the blood was accepted he came back down that's my land that's my land and we are made accepted in the Beloved am mean so if he's accepted I'm accepted amen hallelujah if he was accounted worthy then therefore I'm worthy hallelujah hallelujah glory to God so we don't need to worry that's right he said but what about me no don't worry about you him he was accepted now there is in the Scripture it says if you abide in me and my words abide in you ask what you will and it shall be done now the reformers took that scripture under a manage anointing and they would write many books about abiding INR CHR and how to abide in Christ and this is what you must do but here this is not even though it is good to you know and then so they will put it down to have you read enough have you prayed enough then you can ask what you will cuz you're abiding but that is not what it is actually strictly saying it's saying if my word I'm a Living Word the logos of God himself if I come and abide in you you abide in me ask what you will so if the Living God is this making sense to some people if the Living God he says if I dwell in you ask what you will and it shall be that's how you abide hallelujah amen so it's not out remember we should pray no we should this is incredible you see what God and I don't have a message book but if I had them to me it's all the same cuz the message came out of here it's incredible what we have Hallelujah this word the same God that said let there be light let there be sun moon and stars I'm going to place a Milky wave like this I did it with my word place the sun here h that everything by his word that same God came down and spoke in this generation that's right hallelujah it's incredible it's got creative power this word so I think it behooves us to really listen really read make it a daily diet Hallelujah it'll do you good that's right it'll do you real good amen so he's saying if you abide in me and my words abide in you ask what you will and it shall be if I have him abiding in me then therefore I have I can have confidence I can ask what I will and remember if my will is surrendered to his it's not my human will being asked anyway it's his will he following me but then therefore I have confidence I can ask what I will and it shall be if to agree on Earth then I'll agree in heaven and it'll be so yeah amen that's why I think we really need to start greeing agreeing with each other more than just mentally pray for so and so I agree amen I'm with you amen and you'll see things happen hallelujah amen true now Hallelujah you take Jesus Jesus's Ministry had three phases just like brother brandham jesus' Ministry there was a lot of healing there's discernment and in the word he revealed himself who he was now it says in John chapter 1 that he came to his own and his own received him not but many has received gave he the power to be to be made you know the sons of God and so there was an invitation when the son of man when Jesus was made flesh there was an invitation to come to the wedding supper and the people who should have come turned it down and the people who who were not worthy humanly not worthy they were the ones who made it in you know you take you take the woman who know she she in uh Luke chapter 7 there's a woman who had an alabaster box of ointment and there was a there was a feast going on at at a Pharisees house and all these things were arranged but it wasn't for them Jesus was invited Jesus always goes where he's invited right he always goes where he's invited if you invite him say Lord come and take my life and make it yours he'll come because he came to a Pharisees house and the Pharisee wasn't there to give him honor make him the give him the best seed and look after him the best you know he came to that place and it was custom that day that the people's feet would be washed you they'd be anointed you know with perfumes and so on and they' be given a nice robe and they' be made welcome he didn't all of that Jesus didn't receive so he wasn't even really welcome but he went anyway and so now here was here was the Pharisees uh golden opportunity they had a captive audience they had a captive audience with with God himself you think about the incredible magnitude you know only a certain amount of time there he is eternal life is in my house eternal life I can speak to eternal life will speak back to me Hallelujah but yet they made fun of him they didn't think too highly of him and there's a woman in the city she wasn't invited she wasn't invited to this Feast you know the story very well but maybe I was try to dramatize a little bit she wasn't invited but something moved with within her something moved within her I must get to where Jesus is hallelujah I must get to where Jesus is and not only did she go just you know just herself like that but she took all the money she had and she got an alabaster box of ointment a lot of money was given for that now it didn't matter how she got that money Jesus didn't care didn't matter what your old life consisted of Jesus doesn't doesn't care he doesn't care where you've where you've been what you've done what you've said it doesn't matter amen that that doesn't matter in his economy because we're all born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies amen you can be raised up in the message you can be on the street same same bracket in God's God's economy amen so she took this and she found where Jesus was Hallelujah and she took him by the feet began to be and and and broke the alabaster box anointed his feet amen you begin to be you know begin to weep wash his feet wash his feet with her tears and and the only tell she had was God's provided way and mean was her a glorious long hair and she began to wipe his feet and kiss his feet he was a now he was one you think the Pharisees outwardly that would be invited to the feast they were but they turned it down amen they turned down the invitation he was one something pulled her into that place yes amen something just pulled she didn't really maybe understand what was going on this man is more than a man I must get to his feet I must give him some kind of service I must worship Him in some way hallelujah amen and so she did that now yes and then the Pharisee began to make fun if he really was a prophet he would know M what manner of woman she was because for she is a sinner but Jesus now just let it go on and sometimes it's the same thing with us in the Lord he'll come to I trust this be remember this word this message is the invitation it is brother BR said the bridegroom call will come right through this amen the bridegroom call will come right through this message he says that's right and so there's been an invitation being sent out and you'll see jesus' Ministry parallels brother bram's Ministry parallels Jesus because it's the same Jesus Christ but not in a body of Flesh like the first time but a redeemed body a redeemed son was revealing the son of man and so now so he had three phases of his ministry there was the healings and there's the discernment then there's the word open Jesus Christ revealed himself and so now where were by the end of his ministry where were all the churches where were the ones who actually invited the first part of his ministry they turned it down that's right he says you know you talks about the Full Gospel businessman he says you know this is like an open door to me amen and also he had to live out the scripture behold I stand the door and knock because that's speaking of our age Jesus on the outside of his church and he says I've been in tucon about 3 years I've been not been invited once anywhere trying to get in wasn't the prophet trying to get Jesus trying to get in it had to become flesh cuz but they turned down the invitation that's right and then here we are amen hallelujah let's just jump to you now here we are where he says go get the lame the halt the blind go to the highways and byways get the good and the bad bring them to my supper Hallelujah and something in you says yes I will come I will go I receed an invitation I mean because his word is God for that's why there's something in you that's moving it's more than just excitement or whatever it's beyond that Hallelujah am mean I've been in I've been in Papa New Guinea people don't even stand understand English God move M am Hallelujah and they become United they're different people hallelujah why because they had an invitation they just hadn't heard it yet then the invitation went out amen hallelujah so Glory doesn't matter what you think you are forget what you think you are I mean just forget about it he's invited you I I just want to hammer it through he's made you worthy amen If he if you if you weren't called amen you have to be made worthy in order to be called and he made you worthy by the blood of Jesus Christ forget about what you remember I said many times Esther she was a Jew living in a foreign Nation she couldn't even use her Jewish name anymore she you she was called hadasa in the Hebrew language but then her name was Now esther and Mori told her when she went to the Palace do not tell them you're a Jew do not use your Jewish name you're you must be called Esther your Babylonian name she had to deny she had to deny her first birth yeah amen and she found herself she was there with you know in the Palace of the woman and then she saw hag guy there who was The Keeper of the woman and she understood this man knows the heart of the king amen hallelujah and so she didn't say what can I do I'm going to listen to this guy amen amen and so she dressed herself she behaved herself as Hagi said she should be we've received a Hagi in this day friend amen it was the ministry of brother brandham Ministry of Malachi 4 he knew the heart of God you he's standing there across the mystery of God revealed he got that message apparently by reading a having a concordance in his Bible he goes to the pulpit I'm going to tell you what was in the back parts of God's mind before the foundation of the world Hallelujah for the next three odd hours however long it is here's what's the back part of God's mind that's the part of God he hasn't even sheded himself fully think here I'm going to tell you what it is I think Hallelujah you think about that that's just not some phrase to excite you amen that's God that's a prophet saying I'm going to tell you was in the Eternal Hallelujah was hidden in God hallelujah before the foundation I'm going to tell you what it is I would listen to a god like that cuz he knows what he's talking about cuz he knows the king he says I may not know the Bible very well but I know the author real well Hallelujah Hallelujah I said well oh that's just a nice humble statement yes it is but he he actually knew the author real well and if you know the author real well you know the Bible real well Hallelujah so Esther listen to Hagi then she finds herself remember she's an orphan this this this is a this is where she came from She's an orphan she's a race of people that are second class citizens in the Empire she has to deny the name she was given at her birth and she comes in before the king and it says the king just fell in love with ether amen then here she is now she finds herself in a Palace she finds herself married to the most to the king of this Empire from India to Ethiopia here she is here you are hello amen here you are you find yourself just just what whatever life you came from whatever part of the earth you came out of and me God caused you to be here because there was an invitation amen and then circumstances change and you find yourself in this place of all places you know come out of the you know winter time I come out the front door and it's just all fog I thought my what a place I'm not saying it's good but you know and it's like can anything good come out of Nazareth Hallelujah and the Glorious one came out of Nazareth can anything good come out of this part there's nothing nice about is the gor and the Blackberry and the crime and we have Sirens we literally have Sirens go down this road every night literally ambulance and well police mostly but there's ambulances too every night and you think what are we doing in this place I'll tell you this much God God called us to this place amen you I was just looking for work and I found myself here in Wellington God allowed that to happen God Allowed no offers to to to be accepted down there in Christ Church and two to be given up here and now I'm in this place amen God's good at orchestrating things he's real good right Hallelujah so now here's so here's e now and then the decree Goes Forth hmon and his trickery there's a law goes out all the Jews Must Die 13th day of the 12th month or the other way around I can't remember exactly now here she is this is where you are she hasn't been called in before the king for 30 days and has death to go on Uninvited right now and so here we are she's like well morai get all the Jews to fast and pray 3 days I'll do the same and then I'll go in she was AF afraid to go into the presence of the one who loved her sometimes we get scared amen sometimes we get scared oh he'll he knows all about your life anyway right you must just be honest he knows what you're thinking even now he knows what you're going through don't try and put on some facade just knock it down what happens in an earthquake the first thing that falls off the building is the facade Hallelujah so just let it shake and let it fall you with me that's true and so no yes she is but she but she decides within herself no I'm the queen if I perish I perish that's right she puts the crown on that she was given something about the crown that just fitted just right it didn't fit vasty just right but it fit hurt just right and you find as you as you walk with him there's something about this word It just fits just right something in my soul is just something just just locks in and it's glorious and then she puts on a royal apparel as it would say and she goes in before the king amen if she didn't go sure as Mori said Deliverance will come from another place that's the reason she was there the reason she was there she had gone before the king and there's two things on her mind we have an enemy friends you have an enemy that fights you every day that's right he is against you that's right if he can't if he can't knock your faith in one way you know we are not under a pressure of of of uh recant or birth we're not under that pressure but we're under a pressure of the business of life we can just Cruise along go from from Monday to Monday and oh I'm chasing this and chasing this and I need this and you know it's just all kind of watered down and that's the pressure we have amen because you'll find in countries where the poorer it is it's the better quality actually the believer is amen you'll find it the poorer the less they have the more spiritual they are and I and and I look at that and brother B even says it may not be in these words but he says actually this this civilization this this easiness of life is a curse amen it's actually to have too much is actually a curse because you can just you can just float along everything can just be fine but over there in those places the third world they call upon God they see God live and all they have is him amen and that's all we should have is him now I'm not saying go live in a shack someplace you can have what you have but don't don't let that be your all in all amen let him be your all in all amen hallelujah so she goes in she's got two things on her heart the Deliverance of her people and the destruction of her enemy amen and she because she had to recognize now I am worthy to go in if he'll accept me because of the office I'm in it's not because of her personally it's the office she was in you follow me she was placed as the queen and she didn't put herself there there would have been a whole bunch of other women in the in the Palace of the woman who are scheming how can I become Queen if I do this and I do this and I'll do this I'll do this I'll pray this much I'll listen this much I'll do this much all those things are good but it was the grace of God the grace of the king fell upon her because she listened to the right channel amen amen you got to listen listen to brother brandom read this Bible I can't emphasize it enough make those things your daily Di where should I start just pick a title and go with it and just see Lord where are you leading me I don't know but just go on a journey go on a journey in his word and say Lord what I listen to mold me and shape my character amen when you know you don't just stuff it in my brain put it in my heart God put it in my soul Hallelujah it'll do you good amen don't worry about this thing who cares about this thing man's reasoning has got us to where we are in the world falling apart they reason if we do this we'll do this we can get this and look what we have oh but we can we have all this technology look at the world this world is is falling apart yes sir Hallelujah and the reason it's falling apart is because one the Brokenness of man but to a prophet stood and he declared the world is falling apart again that's right and it is and every time the world is falling apart God sends Deliverance Hallelujah and it's those that receive the invitation of that Deliverance I mean they don't fall apart with the world that's right that's right Hallelujah and so she goes in what is your request you hands out you hands out the scepter she touches the scepter what is your request and she gets what she wants to cut a long story short hmon is hung on the Gallows amen they are given the Mori and her are given the authority amen the signant ring that they would seal every law that cannot change was placed in mori's hand so now they had the ability to enforce Hallelujah to enforce upon the enemy what they could what they will amen hallelujah and is and they were made worthy to do it and here we are prayer is so powerful friend and force upon the enemy your rights I mean we have a right to take God at his word we have an open word today and you have a right to take God at his word and enforce give me my inheritance am me you're allowed to push the enemy off your land don't settle for anything less whatever you do amen hallelujah take God at his word enforce it amen we have a friends we are not here to just have a Revival and die and become formal we're here we've been placed in the promised land we're going to take the whole thing everything that God has given us we're going to have we're going to have perfect marriages we're going to have perfect family relationships we have perfect union with Jesus Christ Hallelujah that's what this is what this promises and if it's promised to me I say God give it to me Hallelujah all you have is get rid of yourself out of the way you are the biggest brother Bram said the biggest enemy I have is William brandham if I can get William Bram out of the way he said will God will do things that William Bram knows nothing about and here's a man who went past the curtain of time seven angels met him on a Mountain Seven cells came open to him the sword was placed the word was placed in his hand Hallelujah dispensation of the Gospel is given to him he says if I can just get myself out of the way God will do things willing br knows nothing about and we sit here and we say man imagine just a day walking like he walked thousands of vision sometimes he didn't he said I'm standing in he'd be standing in front of way more people than this thousands of people said I'm standing in Two Worlds he was here and then there's an eternal realm was opened up that's why he could look at people and God wrot him up this is where you were this is what happened to you when you were young and he sees it lived out in front of him he's not guessing as a vision opener that's and then you see on the Deep P the Deep film he like rubs his face where am I you got to look at it cuz he's in Two Worlds say oh isn't that incredible said if I just get myself out of the way God can do things I know nothing about amen and it's the same thing with us if we can just get ourselves out of the way amen hallelujah what could God do I do not know are you just trying to excite us no all things are possible to them that believe amen means there is nothing impossible with you that's right all things are possible to them that believe that means there's nothing impossible with you I can do all things through Jesus Christ all things amen so I would look into the inheritance now so she so now they had a signant ring they had the right to enforce whatever they did they could put it into law friends that's the Seal of the king they had in their hands they had the king seal yeah whatever you do don't just let it sit idle amen that's right don't let it sit idle that's I think I said last Sunday or whenever the devil tries to rob us of prayer so much amen if we can just get into his presence you say well he'll never leave us nor forsake us that's true but there's a time when you pray and then he takes over amen and that is where God really steps upon the scene remember God wants to use human flesh to see his word fulfilled amen amen so whatever you do you say well that's being a bit too radical making God everything no it's not too radical right Moses Moses made God everything the Apostle I'm just going to pick a whole bunch of names the Apostle Paul made God everything King David made God everything that's right amen when he wasn't backslid right amen a backslider is filled with all his ways it says in the scripture so if you find yourself getting busy with all other stuff and your and your walk with God is being neglected there's something wrong amen maybe a bit of a stinger but it's true amen amen now I'm not talking about looking after your family and going to work on those things we have to do those things but I need this Hobby and this Hobby and this Hobby and let's do this hold on you've only got 24 hours I have the same amount of time in the day that the president of United States does or whoever so they have the same time but let's use the time for him let's use the time for our families let's build memories with our children amen let's do it let's spend time let's have fellowship with them well they won't understand you just go down to the you got to think whatever age they are thoughts that's how brother said how do you help them think their age thoughts and and talk to them on that level and then bring them up to where you are hallelujah amen now I want to read this this is from I've mentioned it a few times but this is from the church age book about now but the Jews you say well but what about your works I've said before if you're motivated by love it's not works okay but he says this about how it's not okay I'll just read it but the Jews back there in the time of Jesus did not want to accept that sacrifice speaking of Jesus sacrifice the blood of bulls and goats made nothing perfect it was once God's ordained method but now Christ having a In the Flesh and by the shedding of his own blood has put away sin and by that offering of himself has made us perfect Hallelujah hello perfected ones amen how are you repeat after me I have been made perfect I made perfect by the blood of Jesus Christ by the blood of Jesus Christ amen yep hallu it's true that's what the Bible says I be made perfect well what about for the perfecting of the Saints there's a sinless Perfection and then there's a maturing yes don't worry about the don't worry about the maturing just walk with him and you'll mature just walk with himall it's like you know you take a little child just begins to walk they don't get all stressed and crying I don't know if I can you know run I can't do what they do you know I can't drive a car and I I can't you know I can't vote and I can't go to work and they're not worri they just grow get up every morning hello here we are you know and they just grow mature amen just relax amen and let him have his way you want to see the supernatural just relax that doesn't mean sit back and watch the world go by but just relax don't get all stressed you get all stressed up in your spirit and you're just fighting this thing just just relax who's in control who have you given your life to who have you yielded yourself to amen if you get all stressed God can't really work just relax yeah Lord anoint my life whatever gift is in my life just just let it you take it and manifest yourself amen whatever office I'm a husband or a your dad mom whatever Lord take that office manifest yourself through it now where was I Jews would not take that the Jews would not take that but what about the Philadelphian ages about John Wesley's age and yes the other ages too did they really accept this in real this reality in Christ so when I read this the reality did they accept the reality no sir even though Luther brought the truth of justification the romanist church and its eastern counterpart the Orthodox Church still clung to works now works are fine but they don't save you they don't make you perfect it is Christ or perish it is not even Christ and works it is Christ Alone this age began the years of Armenian ISM that does not believe in Christ as the reality okay okay it does not sing nothing but the blood for it sings nothing but the blood and my own conduct right remember I'll just read this now I believe in Good Conduct if you are saved you will do righteously we have already gone over that but let me tell you now salvation is not Jesus plus it is Jesus alone salvation is of the Lord From the Start to Finish it's all God let his life be in me let his blood let it be his blood that CLE es me let it be his spirit that fills me let it be his word in my mouth and heart let it be his stripes that heal me Let It Be Jesus and Jesus alone not by works of righteousness which I have done no sir Christ is my life amen am amen so it's you see they did not accept the P atoning power of Christ in reality and that's what we have to receive is it in reality amen yes not just up here Jesus Paid It all but down here Jesus Paid It all and all to him I owe amen but he washed me wide as snow it's got to be in reality God hallelujah that takes and now if it's if it's him if it's he's done it in reality to you then he's made me worthy amen we are his workmanship that's right amen we are his work we're not our own workmanship remember we read we love to read Ephesians chapter 2 that we're saved by grace grace alone at least any you know at least any man should boast in his works whatever more but we got to remember if we're saved by grace what is our walk by right because oh I've been saved by grace and now here we go now I've got to do this and I've got to do this is this right and am I am I saying the right things and am I doing this right and have I prayed the right way and have I listened to enough and I need to do this I and then I need to do this and and then well what's that now what's that now you're you're injecting your own works and subconsciously cuz man needs to achieve something man always you look at the religions of the world it can be you go Catholic okay I'll just take the maybe the three big ones Catholicism Islam Hinduism whatever more what do they do they do pilgrimages they go to places and they say certain amount of prayers and they if you it's all about if you do this and this and this then maybe you'll obtain what you want why cu the devil's used The Human Condition of trying his own ability to to climb up to where he fell from and he uses that he turns it into a you know turns it into a religion and just beats the people down with it then so subconsciously because we're built that way we're like we see this this has been manifested in this hour this message you see what God did through through the prophet Ministry and then he and when he speaks about now the bride of Christ she is bone of his bone life of his life F flesh of his flesh Spirit of his Spirit she is him and the rising of the sun she's made in His image then we look at that say oh how do I become this do we not humanly we say how can I I could never have tame to that and humanly you can never obame to it right but if you let him take you that's why you got to just let let go let go people get frustrated oh I can't do this and I'm sick of Let Go amen forget your frustration that's we were all frustrated once upon a time and then God says are you done yet that's right it's like a child throwing a tto you could just sit there got make a cup of coffee come back sometimes they're real determin and then you can look at them and say are you done yet yeah and then sometimes they're not done so you go have another cup of coffee go do and you come back and it's like us and God that's right he looks at us and go ah we're trying to and then he just stands there because he's Eternal he's not worried he's not in a hurry we get in a hurry he's not hurry hey looks at us say you done that's right have you given up you know and we you know we we cuz we want to I want to Lord are you done and then eventually you say Lord nothing in my arms I bring simply to th Cross I clle take me as I am mold me shap me now Hallelujah and says now I'm ready to pick you up now I'm ready to mold you and use you Hallelujah I'm glad it's that way don't you hallelujah amen so now that's why I'm so glad that this walk is a walk of love amen amen and it is his remember the the definition of Grace in the New Testament is graciousness it says especially the Divine influence upon the heart amen so it's his influence upon your heart which turned you around it's his influence upon your heart which made you fully surrender your life it's his influence upon your heart you opened open the door and he came and dwelt in you you died to yourself anden it's hisence upon your heart you say Lord I want to walk with you amen Hallelujah go look at it in the strongest concordance that's why I'm so glad Enoch Enoch walked with god what happened a Divine influence Came Upon him May he's a shadow of us so he began to walk with God then one day he just took one more step it's just like another day you think this Rapture you look at the Saints and the you know the you the resurrection they're just going about their day and here the greatest week of History brother Ram says it is the death bear Resurrection amen here they are they're down they're sad their life has gone sideways cuz they the one they believe is the Messiah he's dead the Ministries locked themselves away and the accountant of the church has hung himself things have gone bad but then during that time here's our lord Jesus Hallelujah he goes down into hell preaches to the souls in prison goes down knocks on kicks on Satan's door you know takes the keys of Hell death in the grave of him Hallelujah ascends up into Paradise Hallelujah the door comes open Abraham says here's the one that's on the plains of memory here's mzc Hallelujah you know then you all them Daniel you're the shedric M here's the Fourth Man In The Fire Hallelujah Ezekiel the wheel within the wheel here he is hallah Joshua says here's the captain of the host of the Lord I met

terrible time and here this other things of the most glorious things are going on and they and then here we are here we are we go through life remember there's an invitation being sent out here we go through life and we have our ups and downs and our you don't know which way the plane is sometimes and you know you're going around and you know and then here we are we're in the resurrection we are living in a resurrection hour hello we are living Christ has come out of History brother an preaching a sermon lifting him up out of History it's not just a nice sermon he's saying he's been lifted of History he's present among you Hallelujah and that same God back there is present here hallelujah that same God that's called calling then is calling now hallelujah hallelujah now I want to read this I wish I had the Audio I should have done that but this isn't looking to the Unseen I heard this yesterday and and and and a thought came into mind this is very important you you recognize this I know I've read this before but brother br's making an altar call and he says come on walk right down the aisles here right down to receive Jesus Keep Your Hands Up keep looking at the Unseen that little pulsation in your heart C moving right on down is he pulsating to you I am the Lord that raised up Christ from the grave I the one that sent the Holy Ghost I'm the one that gave the promise brother Bram has nothing to do with this I have he surrendered his life to me I'm using his Spirit I'm talking through his lips that's me I'm the Lord am he goes back come down so what happens God God is telling the people William brandom has nothing to do with this humanly has nothing to do with this I am the Lord speaking through the vessel you that's very important you understand that because when there's the preaching of the word this thing has nothing to do with it Hallelujah it is God drawing Hallelujah God speaking that's not crazy Peter Peter preaching on day of Pentecost was that Peter no that was the Holy Ghost in Peter I mean what Paul was on M Hill or preaching whever he was was it Paul no it was God hallelujah brother BR would stand say good morning friends to talk away that wasn't him it was God speaking Hallelujah so it's very important this is not William bram's invitation this is not my invitation amen it's God's invitation to you hallelujah hallelujah it's very important you understand that thank you Lord because when we see God you are you are calling me God the one who spoke the one who created all things that's right there's only one God his name is the Lord Jesus Christ the one who made all things has now invited you he's given you the invitation will you come and for those who have received it we should say hallelujah and if you haven't you should say Lord Jesus I receive it amen amen so now hallelujah hallelujah because he has made us worthy amen he has made us worthy amen it is not our own worthiness I'm going to wind this up a little bit but it is him amen it is him so don't ever look at you do not look at you it's not it's not you and Jesus it's him it's not your Works have I done enough now that will come into M sometimes CU we want it because we love him so much Lord we want to give it more than our all amen but you say well am I worthy to do it yes you're worthy to do it Esther was made worthy amen amen Esther was made worthy brother br about praying for that um young man who uh who sponsored his meeting he said it just be the same hands but but God doesn't see me he sees hears my voice through his blood Hallelujah and it's the same thing with us we have to take God take God at his word doesn't matter what age you are you can be five or you can be whatever I won't try and throw top age up there might get in trouble but anyway doesn't matter what age you are take God at his word well I need a I need a leading let's just let's just read Mark 16 shall we let's just close with this now now this is Mark 16's let's read from verse 15 are you enjoying living in the resurrection are having a good time here I am I'm glad I'm in this day glory to God just keep walking one day you'll find these bodies are changed just walk with them now this is the this is the standing orders this is you like so in the military you have the standing orders or whatever it's called it's just this is this is the routine what you do and then if there's a change there's the orders of the day this is the standing orders go in into all and he said go into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth and is baptized wait yes he that believeth in is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe he's not talking about just to the apostles or just to the prophet messenger he's talking to them that believe who believes remember I said before I've read it quite a few quotes when the weakest of Christians gets on their knees the kingdom of Hell shakes when the weak kissed so it doesn't matter so oh so now there's now there's only two so you say who's a Believer who's a Believer this morning is everyone a Believer so therefore you're a Christian right so it doesn't matter if you consider yourself a weak Christian or a strong Christian he says when the weakest of Christians gets on their knees and prays the kingdom of Hell shakes Devils tremble amen so doesn't matter what you think you are I'd pray amen who wants to see hell come down hallelujah hallelujah now he that believeth okay and these Sons shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them and they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover amen these shines shall follow you now you don't have to do a tick box have I fulfilled it's God's life in you lives this amen you say well I don't feel a lot of Faith take God at his word we don't live by feeling we do not walk by feeling right we know you know I am quite an emotional person but when it's all said and down I do not walk with God because of emotion I walk with him because his word says it I believe it that settles it I may not understand it I'm not worried about understanding it at this time he will show me what it means in my season that's right right so this is the standing orders of the day and so if this is the case we are made worthy to do these things now that doesn't mean you go to a snake dance and do all those things no just walk with God you mean my faith yes your faith lay hands on the sick they shall recover they'll cast out Devils speak with new tongues they'll do these things hello Believers we are called to believe all things are possible amen and we remember this is a spiritual walk this life doesn't matter if you doesn't matter about the atheist on the street it's still a spiritual world this world it's like a you know the light spectrum we see this much but the spectrum is this big it's the same thing with this natural world we see this much but it's really this big the Unseen World we should friends we be made worthy well what if he doesn't you know but it's me praying just like brother Ram said better be the same old hands and these hands know the failure is that these hands have done and they know the things that they have done but don't worry about the things they have done are they under the blood are they under the blood then take God at his word because we are his representative Hallelujah you be made worthy have full confidence am have full confidence God I can ask anything in your name if it's according to your will you'll do it amen amen let's not worry about the well what if what if what if what if well who cares about the what ifs God said so yeah you when Jesus said only believe what does that mean that doesn't mean we'll bring the wh ifs into account means only belief only do this belief right it's not only well what will this person think or what will this person say oh you how will I feel at the time no that's not only believing throw that out throw it out only believe take God at his word well I'm unworthy that's not only believing let's go to Revelations chapter 5 I'm going to read the a scripture and then we're going to then we're going to close we are worthy now I want this to go real down into the subconscious I am worthy am he has made me worthy it is his blood that makes me worthy amen he is my lamb amen all of my sin is upon Him amen hallelujah I sinless he became sin that I become his righteousness amen that's what the Bible is what Paul wrote down that's God speaking through Paul oh glory glory be to God Amen now let's read Revelations 5 and let's read well let's read from verse seven I love Redemption I love Redemption Hallelujah verse 7 down to verse 10 okay and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne so that's that's the lamb this all symbolic we know there our it's our lamb stepping forth to take back to take back Redemption take the book of redemption and when he had taken the book The Four beasts and the four and 20 adles fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps and golden vials full of odors which are the prayers of prayers of saints so they've being released in this hour and they sang a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals off for thou was slain and Hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and nation and has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the earth now there's a few Kindred Nations tongues in this room this morning amen so when so when this when when when they begin to sing this new song this is not angels singing this is God's redeemed this is his life singing Hallelujah because it comes to reality Thou Art Worthy and thou has redeemed Us by thy blood amen amen not by our conduct and your blood it's by thy blood Hallelujah that's why there's such power in the word just believe the word just say I agree with it amen just say yes Lord it'll change you amen amen Thou Art Worthy he was found worthy I'm not really going to go too far to that but he was found worthy so if he's found worthy and I'm accepted in him I'm worthy Hallelujah Glory let it let's have some musicians to come otherwise I'll I don't know I just love the Lord you say well I have you know being a being a parent I have way more battles and ups and downs and lefts and rights and

ability it's not your ability it's nothing but the blood hallelujah thank you Lord amen where say hallelujah where brother Isaac go okay he's made us worthy okay so I trust I trust that's knocked that
