that have come even the parents you know I appreciate you very much you know it's always good to be in the midst of saints of like Precious faith and doing camps are not easy it's not doing it's not easy you know you can have an inspiration to help people and sometimes the enemy anoint people that ask a bunch of questions why why this why that why this why that just want the young people to be blessed that's what it's all about Sir you know that they come in contact with the Lord yes sir you know and I believe in this Camp the only motive was to get the people closer to Christ you know so I can appreciate the inspiration of the brothers that put this together and all the people that were involved so let's just have a word of prayer and we'll get into the scripture tonight if you have a need you can acknowledge it by uplifted hand Lord Jesus father we come in your presence tonight knowing how real you are Lord and father we just submit ourselves to you you Lord father knowing that we've been in this situation before and you've always showed yourself to be Mighty and strong so we ask that the great god Jehovah would come Among Us and tear down walls that's been blocked Lord Lord break the chains loose the chains that have been binding your people Lord Lord settle the hearts that have been troubled father you be God to us Lord that's all we can ask for but let us have an expectation Lord that you'll meet our needs Lord that you would move in a in a a way that would just blow the minds of all of our carnality and just to know that you're Supernatural and everything about you is Supernatural Lord give us the faith to receive that Supernatural tonight Lord forgive us for our sins and trespasses Lord Lord and our thoughts and our ways that's not like your thoughts and your ways Lord bless this church all the young people Lord and the families Lord and Lord even the ministering brothers and all that are involved in the name of Jesus Christ we pray and we thank you Lord the church say amen amen amen hallelujah my heart is full tonight you have your Bibles let's turn to um Mark the 5th chapter Mark 5 I Pro I probably should do like Steve and put this down here cuz I probably I know I'm not GNA stay up here amen hallelujah but it's probably as good it'll be up here so it won't be in my way down there amen so praise God Mark the 5th chapter let's start reading at verse um verse 25 Mark 5 and 25 if you have it say amen amen and a certain woman which had a issue of blood 12 years and had suffered many things of many Physicians and had spent all that she had and was nothing better but rather grew worse when she had heard of Jesus came in the press behind and touched him and touch his garments for she had for for she said if I may touch but the hymn but the clothes I Shall Behold and straight way as soon as she as soon as she operated in what she believed she got the results of her faith the Bible says in verse 29 and straight way the Fountain of her blood was dried up and she felt in her body that she was healed of the plague Halle Hallelujah let's go to um 1st Samuel chapter 16 1st Samuel chapter 16 verse 14 1 Samuel 16-14 the Bible says but the spirit of the Lord departed from Saul and an evil spirit from the Lord troubled him and Saul's servant said unto him behold now an evil spirit from God troubleth thee let our Lord Now command thy servants which are before thee to seek out a man who is cunning who is a cunning player on an harp and it shall come to pass when the evil spirit from God is upon thee that he shall play with his hands and thou shalt be well amen let's go to one more scripture and you'll have your seats let's go to Ephesians the 6th chapter Ephesians 6 one verse out of here let's read um verse let's read verse 12 for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of Darkness in this of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places may the Lord a bless reading of his word you can have your seats tonight you know I believe in this Camp the Lord has been truly uh good to us amen I believe he's he's he's he's made himself real you know we we've rejoiced we've some songs we've laughed you know and I think now it's time to get a little bit more deeper with God you know my subject tonight is open doors and issues open doors and issues Hallelujah you know or if I can say issues and open doors normally when we have issues it's because a door has been opened in your life and you know one thing I've come to understand about young people you can know God's talking to you you can feel the spirit moving and you hold back because you got issues and the reason why you you feel that way because there's something that's been loosed in your life you were not born in that certain condition you know that's why I love uh brother Steve's Ministry how he talked about the innoc of a child and then moving past that innocence to where you're knowing good and evil and wickedness and sexual Temptation and all those things see you go from a place to being blameless innocent no issues you know why because no doors are open but as soon as those doors are open in your life it creates issues but I want to encourage you tonight I want to let you know that We Are Soldiers Hallelujah You Are Soldiers amen and I'm depending on you because I believe we're all on the same team Hallelujah so don't let your issues stop you from fighting for your inheritance hallelujah what we want to do tonight we want to kick the devil out of our house amen I'm not talking about the house with your home address I'm talking about this house kick the devil out of your house he doesn't belong in your house let's deal with your issues and let's close those doors because Satan is powerless unless he has an Open Door Hallelujah but before we get to marching before we get to possessing land let's have a a a a spiritual physical let's have a soul examination you know you can enlist into the army or you can Brothers you can you can try out for a rugby team or sisters you can try out for volleyball and no how and no matter how good you think you are you have to pass the physical fit test you say man I play this at home all the time I'm good I'm good they say well you got to take my test h and if you don't pass that test no matter how good you are no matter what your friends may say about you you'll never get to play Hall so you have to pass the examination amen and I'm here to say that there are some things that belong to you but you got to be spiritually fit to receive it and as long as there's a little sickness here a little sickness there I can't put you in the team H or should I say God H God can use you you'll sick the bench and you watch everybody else playing and you say man I'm just as good as they are but you sick H how many you ever had a physical nobody a y'all healthy I hope y'all can hear me good can you hear me but you know church if I can before I get into the open doors and the spirits and different things I want to deal with my Army Hallelujah I want to deal with the soldiers that are fighting this battle with me Hallelujah first of all Hallelujah I'm not fighting against you you're not fighting against me we're fighting against one enemy and that is the devil Lucifer the dragon himself and you know some people don't believe that the devil or or different things are real well let me ask you something what's making this person blow their brains out and not this person real life Spirits amen but I'm not fighting you no matter what's going on in your life I'm fighting the issues behind your life I'm fighting the devil behind you amen there is only two Spirits God and Satan and either you're surrendering your body to him which is God or you're surrendering your body to the enemy and tonight if you're like this your like this see right now amen the atmosphere can go up and down because there are two kinds of spirits present a spirit of Faith which loves God or a spirit of unbelief that doubts God God Amen but I want to say tonight greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world my God is real Hallelujah y'all got to get ready for that now Hallelujah but you know when we think about joining an army or being in an army and you get you an examination the first thing they do when they examine you they examine your mind the prophet of God said the greatest battle ever fought is in the mind and if you are not stable up here you're not stable in Christ catch it stable in Christ because real learning means nothing if God is not the absolute that's why the Bible says let this mind be in you which was also in who Christ I want my thinking to be God's thinking I want my thoughts to be God's thoughts Hallelujah I want my actions to be God's actions what's going on in your [Applause] mind Hallelujah and some of you are very confused in your mind one being you feel like a soldier and you marching and the next minute somebody talk about you and then you start having issues you start one of the greatest things the devil use amongst young people is mind battles I'm not good enough I'm not tall enough I'm not light enough I'm not dark enough just all kind of stuff playing with your mind you ever thought somebody you heard that somebody said something about you you heard that somebody said something about you and then you get to get with that person and talk to them about what you heard and they say no I ain't never said that oh that ain't never happened to y'all what happened to me or should I say you didn't hear it the way he they meant it there we go we got you now H you heard it different than how it was said and we do that all the time somebody can say well brother DS is loud and I hear that part loud and they walking out the door and they say but I love it and all I heard was them saying brother DS is loud and now I got an issue and the devil has created an Open Door well I got a complex because I didn't hear the whole [Applause] story and young people get complexes because you don't allow God to give you the whole story all you hear is what the devil is saying the devil said this the devil said that do what I do you know what I do when he's talking I say shut up devil don't receive his thoughts don't receive his mind Hallelujah because that's a Battleground you say brother what are you talking about because you see the mind is a Battleground because you can have your mind made up to do something and have one obstacle and say no I'm not going to do it Hallelujah that's why I say it's a Battleground or it could be something tough and you say no I ain't do it but you think about it we going we going to battle Hallelujah we going to battle you got to have the right mindset H you can't you can't not in my not in my Army you can't be one of them people fighting one day and then you like ah I'm scared no every day we going to battle every day we going to possess land every day we going to kick the devil out until we conquer the whole land hallelujah amen you know sometimes I be at my church Hallelujah you know I got a pastor and you know sometimes I see things that I don't like and you know I I look at it and I be thinking why is he letting them do that what's wrong with the pastor that's what's going on in my mind like he letting them do this he letting them do that I just I want a piece of it bad you know but then God had to deal with me and like brother Steve talked about the pastor evangelist but mine is a little bit more simple Hallelujah you know the difference between a pastor and evangelist they all they both have a big gun H not a 22 not a pop but a AK-47 automatic Hallelujah you don't have to reload to the clip empty amen AK-47 H and they see as a pastor the same thing I see as an evangelist is just two different gifts but the thing of it is hallelujah he's looking at what I'm looking at but there's one difference his gun has a safety mine doesn't Hallelujah I was born to shoot and shoot and shoot and shoot and shot and shot and shot and shot and shot and shot and shot and blast and blast shot and shoot blast and blast shoot and shoot hallelujah hallelujah I was born to attack amen that's my makeup my makeup is to attack tell the devil I'm coming after you I'm Bor to attack [Applause] hallu w God has people in his camp that are not afraid of the adversary that are not afraid to get in the trenches Hallelujah and say devil we know where you're coming from and I'm going be here waiting on you hallelujah hallelujah and we going to deal with the issues that you've caused in this war Hallelujah am I boasting no I just know my purpose and I'm comforable with that Hallelujah but you know the first thing they do they examine your mind make sure you are sane now when you get in there they make you crazy but they want to make sure that when you're doing that examination that your mind is in the right place they examining somebody and they talking to them and they sit there doing like you think they going to enlist that person in the Army no because their mind is someplace else hallelujah how is God ever going to use you when your mind is in the world hallelujah how is God ever going to strengthen you when your mind is someplace else Hall the Bible says amen think on these things and it says bring every other Hallelujah bring those thoughts into captivity Hallelujah bring it under subjection cast down imagination Hallelujah and you know after they deal with your mind amen if you pass that test and they say okay you know how they make sure your mind together they hold up pictures they say tell me what you see simple pictures that everybody knows about if they P up a cat and you say a bear they they they'll say let's do this again pull out another picture and this time they hold up a bear and you say a cat you say he's crazy and you know what they're saying we can't trust him with this kind of power we cannot put the the weapons of warfare in his hands because he won't be able to handle that power because the prophet of God said power without character it's satanic and there are so many people that want the power but don't have the character they want to be pastors they want to be preachers they want to be this they want to be that but does not have the spiritual character God never give you a church if you don't have the character wo we wonder why we don't see the the the gifts of the Spirit moving in our church because people do not have the spiritual character for God to show them things about somebody else's life and for them not to do something [Music] crazy you think God going to show you a dream or somebody or vision of somebody's life and you ain't got the character to pray for oh man God show me he committed adultery and you tell everybody else in the church God can't trust you with that power H amen how is God ever going to use you young people hallelujah if he can't trust you H oh my I feel so much so much of a poor wonderful my thoughts are going everywhere but let's let's just deal with this Army you know if you pass the Mind test they say okay oh he list and the next thing they do I'm going down then they check your eyes you want to make sure you got the right sight you want to make sure you looking at the right thing Hallelujah and if Hallelujah if you can't see what God see God can't use you Hallelujah you have to be able to tap into Hallelujah the vision of Christ young people hallelujah if your eyes are on Facebook all the time your eyes are on Instagram your eyes are on this movie that movie and this movie star that movie star your eyes are all in the wrong place you know what's going on the Bible says that the light of the body is the eye so if your eyes are in the wrong place you'll lose the battle if you're looking at the wrong thing you'll lose the battle why because spirits come in your body to your eyes evil spirits come through your body by what you looking at why do you think people have nightmares because of something they watched Hallelujah one time I was in a church and I was preaching about having rest and I say it's a shame you supposed to be Christians and you can't even get a good night's sleep cuz the devil tormenting you in your own bed I said because you sitting at watching some old horror picture you're watching somebody kill somebody or shoot somebody and all kind of stuff let me ask you something what's inside of you feeding on that if you like scary movies and Blasting and cutting heads off and all that stuff there's something inside of you you feeding and your inner man is very sick cuz very sick to see somebody chop somebody head off and then say I like that you are sick inividual who likes killing but the devil cuz he come to kill steal and destroy Hallelujah so the inner man tells what's really going on by the things you crave and some of us are sick because of what's going on through our eyes we don't have 2020 Vision spiritually Hallelujah you know you can look at something and it mess you up you can you can you can be thinking about that thing for days because it gets in your spirit and if it stay there too long you'll start thirsting at it you'll start hungering at then you find yourself sit you see oh my fill the spirit you see a young lady Hallelujah walking down and she's SE SE dress and you look at her too long and then you hear a voice say stop that and you turn see a got in your spirit now and then you get home sit down on your computer type up sexy dress that's how pornography star cuz you open the door you open the door you allowed yourself to fall for something and now that spirit is see one thing about the Devil he's powerless until you let him in once you see he's he's trying he's trying you he's trying to do everything just to get in and once he get in he's like and he's in there now he's like ah let me make room oh let me make room up in here I got some things I want to do in here oh yeah we going to have a party in this place wo depression I got in buddy a little bit longer you'll be in here hallah alcohol a little bit longer buddy you'll be in here one door opens a door for another door that's why I'm saying tonight deal with your issues and cut the devil [Applause] off but if you go you prepare for battle and you can't see they say I can't use you God cannot use you if you if you're not looking at the right things and like I was saying I went to a church and Hallelujah I was preaching about uhh demon powers and and and and and and Nightmares and you know like some of you spiritual people doing right now we in the message what he talking about amen amen talking about that same devil you know I started preaching about some of you adults I remember this Friday the 13th Jason and how Jason tormented people how Jason did this Jason did that Jason wore a hockey mask I'm sorry Steve I know Steve my buddy he love hockey Canadian they love hockey we talking about Jason right now Jason wor hockey mask you couldn't see his face he walked around tormenting people and he had a certain kind of music see it was something about that music that invited Spirits in certain kind of see now we on the next part we moving kind of fast the next thing that examine is your hearing oh what are you listening to am what are you hearing amen the things that come through your ears will affect your spirit Hallelujah the kind of music you listening to Hallelujah I know some of you y'all way over here but I know some of you be in your house talking about [Applause] oh why is it that our Christian children know all the worldly dances that come out why is it that our children open those doors and we at home listening to music and we in there dabbing see y'all parents don't know what I'm talking about but they do cuz you in your own little world like brother Steve was preach own little world you ain't even thinking about that they got issues and they right in your house listening to it [Music] but do you not know when you listen to that even when you dab and you open yourself up to a spirit see y'all y'all look at America y'all think oh Bo I wish I could go to America we want to do it habitation of devils and you doing this stuff and you don't even know where it come from you don't even know the the the the the principality behind it you don't know the spirit behind that dance there's always something behind a dance remember Hallelujah herodia daughter came before The King and she's like she start B rolling and dancing and the King got pleasure out of that dance but it was death behind that dance cuz he fell in love with that dance and then he said I give you whatever you want she said give me John the Baptist head so that dance was a Dance of Death right but his eyes wasn't in the right place he couldn't

parts of that examination the heart amen if you got a hole in your heart they can't use you some of you got a hole in your heart spiritually you've been broken you know maybe maybe you were maybe you were abused younger maybe you were molested let me tell you something that's not your [Music] fault stop carrying that pain stop falling to the pressure of that issue but I want you to close that door Hallelujah because as long as you're dwelling on that the devil has power over you cuz you can never go on and if it was a man you can never look at a man and expect him to love you because you've been abused by somebody that was supposed to have love you right close that door honesty forgiveness close that door Hallelujah why am I talking about this because that issue is here amen stop carrying that pain you ain't the first one that have gone through that Hallelujah but I know young ladies who've gone through that Hallelujah brought it to God and God dealt with it God took away that pain God took away that hurt and they no longer live in that world because they allowed God to deal with that issue and close that door and now they're in the army fighting Lord close those doors sometimes things like that happen when you get hurt no it's not your fault it was a demon that did that to you amen hallelujah let go of that hurt let go of that pain it's in here let it go thank you Lord Let It Go hallelujah it's not your fault am Let It Go and that's what happens people will run from God because of their fears they've been hurt they got issues they got pains so they they they'll run from God and they'll say well Lord you don't love me and Lord You're not real and all these things because of the things that happened in that life right what you have to do is deal with that issue and close that door sir cuz as long as that door is open Satan will keep walking back in right amen he'll keep stirring up that hurt H and I know we got a diversity of people but you know in the US amen y'all understand what slavery was all about you know I know a lot of Africans are here South Africans you understand what slavery was all about but this is the thing amen if you never been a part of it you can't understand it so you can't take my feelings for granted what you have to do is try to understand me if you never lived in my world you don't know what I'm [Music] battling so you can't come and tell me ah like like like the brother say I'll just deal with it go up get more strong we're not in that world anymore but you don't know the scar somebody may have you don't know the issues they may have Hallelujah but you know what I did hallelujah amen with my children I didn't teach them about black history like I didn't teach them about slavery and all that stuff because bringing up that past would only bring up those spirits and teaching them about the march at Montgomery and all the stuff and then they'll start looking at you funny and looking at other people funny that never did anything to them because I brought up some of my hurts and now my child's living through my pain and they Wen even a part of it but I involved them in something Hallelujah where a door wasn't even open and I open that [Music] door and that's what we do we involve our kids in stuff that has nothing to do with them let me tell you young people if your parents are distant or maybe they got a divorce that's not your fault stop carrying that pain cuz you feel like you're in between your mom and dad let me tell you what to do just love both of them just love both of them right don't take that pain on your shoulders I've seen kids with that issue that coming oh my parents I get a divorce I I don't know what to do you ain't supposed to do nothing it's between them and God you just pray you just keep praying and if you a Christian you show them what Godly love is all about Hallelujah believe it or not our kids are are heavy they're heavy loaded they have burdens they have issues because of Life some of you are hurting now because things that have happened in your life things that you were you were beg galed into begal means to be tricked or seduced into some of you young girls have been seduced and the young boy just use you some of you young boys have been hurt and I I'll never get married because one girl hurt your feelings amen close those doors deal with those issues hallelujah it's not normal for you to have homosexual thoughts it's not normal to have lesbian thoughts those are demon powers close those doors don't let the devil tell you you was born that way yeah you was born what you are and you look at it in the mirror you know I like to say it like this it's so just forgive me for being frank but it's so stupid they're fighting over bathroom laws in the states bathroom laws the right to go in this bathroom because they a guy woke up one morning like Oh I Feel Like a Woman I I want the right to use the women's bathroom and a woman wake up one morning oo my voice kind of my voice kind of deep I think I'm a man the power of perversion Satan's messing with their mind and he can't use your mind when it's perverted and you're trying to get in the army but let's look at it let's look at the real substance of it because they'll say you I like the show y'all know I'm an actor not a Pharisee y'all know I dramatize things but let's look at it let's look at what they really want you know you take a man who wakes up one morning and he has this battle in his mind oh I'm a woman and he's 6' n 6 with nine with a size 21 [Laughter] ft it could be but I ain't met a woman yet with a size 21 foot I'm just saying I'm just saying it could exist but I'm just saying I I ain't I ain't never hard you know 6'9 21 foot I I feel like I feel like I'm a woman I want to go in the women's bathroom so he fight for those right or she or he whatever it is fight for those rights fight for those rights because the world is telling them that liberal you can be whatever you want to be so he's fighting to be what he thinks he wants to be he's still 6' n he still got a 21 siiz foot he can't change that he can't make his foot he can't go through a foot transplant and get smaller feet he can't go to some doctor and tell a doctor cut him in half make him petite he can't do that it's an issue it's a perversion so for the for the for the sake of of just making a point let's just say he wins he wears I can go I can go in the women's bathroom and he he he he struts his stuff in there he 6' n so his hand is probably way up here so he walks in he gets in the bathroom you know and he feel like he's liberated he's won the battle you know I got rights the same rights as a woman I'm a woman in a man's body and then he goes to the stall and uses it like a man he fought to be a woman but when he got there to do the actual act he still was a man that's right so what did he really accomplish nothing stupid same thing with the women what's up man what's up what's up my name ain't Shanti no more it's Sean don't call me Shanti it's Sean I'm I'm going to go get me a fade cut all a half off get a fade and she she she wins the rights she says that you know hey hey I'm classify me as a man I'm going to men's bathroom and she feel like she won look in the mirror yeah I won and uses the bathroom like a woman so what did she accomplish nothing right nothing it's just issues and open doors right close those doors let me tell you something young girl the power perversion one time a young lady came in the prayer line she said brother de the devil is telling me I'm a lesbian I say why do you say that you ain't going to just tell me something like that and then you think you just going to walk away from it no we going to deal with it I said why you say that she says cuz every guy y'all listen to me good now I'm running out of time listen Church she comes and she says brother the devil is telling me I'm a lesbian and I said why do you say that she says because every young man that I I was interested in or or or we may started courting and it just breaks up and and he marries somebody else and and all I have is my girlfriends and they're comforting me and and they're there for me and they're this and they're that the devil is perverting something that's natural amen your sisters are there for you because they're your friends you're not supposed to fall in love with them sexually they're your friends there's nothing more to it they're your friends you're not supposed to that's Satan opening a door so I asked I said well look let me ask you a question do you want to get married she says yes I said do you want to get married to a man she says yes I said well okay close that door that Satan's trying to open and now I think she's married to a man happily married children a whole nine yards because she didn't allow the devil to keep a door open yes that's good right amen some things happen because you're not paying attention you know when in your heart amen don't follow your heart if it's not converted cuz your heart the Bible say the the the heart is wicked and deceitful who can trust it you oh he loves me he loves me I know he don't go to church with me but he loves me his in my heart is the holy ghost telling you that is your body telling you that don't trust your heart if you not converted he don't love you amen trust your heart if your heart is not converted don't trust it you'll make the wrong decision cuz your decision will be something carnal if the heart is not converted it let's deal with these issues you know put that quot up for me I'm about to close don't get nervous there was a young lady who was going to church you know she was in a good church she was in a good church you serving the lord and

pray for me first brother Brandon he says you're not a patient here are you she says yes let me tell you my story so she starts to tell him a story put it back up brother she was a good Christian girl and she said when I was a young girl brother brandom I was ready raised in a real Christian home most of you raised in a real Christian home and I started going with a boy that smoked first mistake if you're a Christian why are you dealing with an unbeliever you're opening a door that's going to create issues Hallelujah the Bible says do not be unequally y if I'm a Believer I ain't going to deal with somebody that don't believe what I believe it's going to cause issues Hallelujah first mistake boy smoked and you know there a bigger issue why she chose the boy that smoke some of the things Steve was preaching she probably had some hurts and some pains and she dropped up guard down cuz see she was raised in a Christian home but she even though she was in a Christian home she had her own hurts and pains to choose something different than what she was raised yeah everybody all right I want to deal with the issues in my Army cuz I need you I need you don't don't play psychology with me tonight don't try to fake me out tonight don't try to fake me out because I know what's going on she said and I started going with a boy that smoked and said first thing you know I was smoking evil Communications corrupt good manners amen what do you think's going to happen if you fellowshipping with an unbeliever what do you think going to happen if you start dating a boy that don't know God either you're going to convert him him or he's going to convert you but why take that chance open the door now you got issues she said and one night he spiked the coke with whiskey did that boy love her he didn't love her he had one motive he saw a good clean Christian girl yeah he was like man I got to have her I want to be the first one she was nothing but a game a challenge of lust because you love someone why you going to try to get them drugged up why you going to try to get something out of her that she can't give you in her right mind demon he spiked a coke with whiskey and that started me drinking another door Bo getting tough because she met one boy who was an unbeliever yeah all the stuff she was raised with she's losing it slowly that's right exactly cuz she may have she she she got some hurt going on by the kind of person she chose but now look at she didn't smoke but because the boy smoke now she's smoking a door open which is a demon smoking is a demon and you can get power over that demon Amen brother amen next thing Hallelujah she said he put He put some whiskey he put some coke he he spiked her coke with whiskey she said and she started drinking another demon entered into her system because of this one boy a door open she got more issues she smoking now she drinking and she said I started from that to prostitution you see what's happening she's losing her self-confidence she's losing her identity because everything she had was wrapped up in this boy and he did not love her smoking drinking and now she is prostitute but she was raised in a Christian home how did she get there doors open the devil stepped in let me tell you something the devil don't play fair he don't play he don't play fair I know a sister I know a sister who was sitting in the uh she she she left the Lord and then she came back and you know and when she came back while she was out there she cut all her hair down but God start dealing with her God start restoring her and now her hair was growing and she remember the principles of keeping her hair alone and uh she was sitting in the chair where she normally go to Beautician and and and and and and and and she told The Beautician don't cut my hair she said it real nice don't cut my hair and The Beautician says I can do it in a way where nobody you know she said that lady never said anything like that before it was a demon trying to keep that door open and she says she knew the way she said it it wasn't strong enough so she she didn't know if the lady really understood or not but she said when she was sitting in the chair such conviction came over her she knew God was standing there and then the Lord said said if you cut it if you cut it you do not get to choose your judgment see that's what we don't realize about playing with sin you don't get to choose your judgment you don't get to choose what is going to happen prime example she probably never saw herself smoking drinking and prostituting but when she left from Under the Umbrella of Christianity she opened the doors to demon powers let me say this I need [Music] you and she said I lived in the very gutters of the backside of hell she said I served four years in the Catholic institution good Shepherd's home she tried to get religious and clean it back back up and said in there I turned to I turned a new page she said I turned a new page I think
