got a poem he wants to read so as brother James hits up we'll get brother any to do his palm then after that brother David is next you know and that's who's next after that I wasn't actually going to share this but I opted out when I heard there were six items but obviously well still let me he was still merciful to me especially after stealing his song choice at the end of the service amen we're practicing now you know so the Lord I actually this came in a dream and I woke up and I wrote it down and it's and then the poem is called it's about to change amen I'm gonna not preach okay I'm just gonna tell you the poem have you ever seen a girl who's been teased all her life ever seen a little lady living in the strife of a fallen world knowing there's so much more for deep down inside she's born to be the bride all her surroundings everything that keeps her on the ground it's about to change she's about to leave this world leave everything behind she's looking everywhere because she's called to find more of her kind there's an atmosphere brewing in the ear it's kind of strange to this fallen world because it's all about to change I know of a lady she does not look like much in this world according to its pride she comes from God goes back to God she's thought of kind of strange she don't really fit in this world but it's all about to change she's about to leave this world leave everything behind she's looking everywhere because she being called to find more of a kind there's an atmosphere brewing in the air it's kind of strange to this fallen world because it's all about to change because of our Lord has named as glorious Jesus Christ coming down in perfect love to rescue me to change my life full of grace mercy never-ending praise everything my all blessed be your name for everything I see is about to change amen go play sure this song is a one that I've written and coming through this is a song that I wrote a while ago as we were I don't want to say too much but as we've been through our walk with the Lord and coming into the full revelation of this message and we realized that there was so much more whose heard an Eagle scream amen and that Eagle scream pulled you out of Egypt but that was only the start of your journey and so what I started to realize that there was this whole adoption process and one thing I wanted to say is that with this adoption you know when we've got so much power over the devil because what we found out was that we were wearing this wedding band of predestinated unmerited grace before the foundation of the world so I want to say if you're a believer you're neither where a child of the devil you were always a child of God and you're now growing and I realized that there was this process three stages to the adoption where we had to cross through the Red Sea and then we had to cross through the desert and then we come to the Jordan and beyond the Jordan there was a Canaan's land and it's ours and it's our promise for now and what I come to realize that there were message believers right from coming out of Egypt all the way to ones that had gone into the Promised Land now and a living and a bride aged and rejoicing but there's people right through there and I just had this desire in my heart to encourage those people to come into the fullness and to Kanaan's land so that was the inspiration for this song and I'm not much of a singer we were born into Egypt and bondage we had no peace at all for this Pharaoh no longer knew our Joseph all the power of our God but Jehovah has sent to us a Moses saying let my people go Satan no longer has a hold of us we are heading to the promised land we've been walking through the desert on our way to the promised land [Music] or a Moses he said that he would lead us if we will put a trust in him but the people did now trust and Moses you will have to make your choice where you will stand for jehovah is looking for the people who were looking for the promised land we are able to take the promised land Ford's yours the saith the Lord all he's promised a mighty host of angels to ban camp around them who fear his name and he said be strong I'll never leave you just put your trust in the one who lady's friend if you only just be courageous he's by your side combined for you and Joshua and Caleb who went into the land to see what they would have to fight against there were giants and Donnie's all kinds of mighty man horses and chariots walls around the land but Jehovah has said that we can take it the enemies of Israel will fall if we'll only trust him to lead us we can take the promised land but the people would not trust you hold theythey it of what would come they were looking back to Egypt fruits and water replace to lay their head and start is doubting their noses even though they gotta talk to him the hand for God and the things that he'd spoken we're able to take Canaan's land we're able to take the promised land towards you the Santa he's promised a mighty host of angels to vancamp around them who fit his name he said be strong I'll never leave you just put your trust in the one who ladies read if you only just be courageous he's by your side you find for you we must learn to trust the prophets for they have heard the will of God from the mouth the word has been spoken and we must obey their voice if we don't want to wander in the desert or perish then the shifting sands then stay connected to his message and the people heading to the promised land he has sent to us a message revealing the son of man crying come out of her my people God is given to you the promised land he has sent to us a message revealing the son of man crying come out of her my people God's given to you the promised land to take the promised land [Music] these promise to mighty host of angels to camp around [Music] we said be strong I'll never lead you put your trust in the world if you only just be courageous he's by your side fine for you he's by your side he'll fight for you amen praise with what there was a sermon in the song hey amen brother David then after that we've got brother sis Jeffrey's ancestor Levin for you whence I came

this evening gathered my god together in the mighty name of our Lord Jesus Christ father as we just summed the song moved into the chamber beef house my god this evening we acknowledge that this meeting would be a waste of time if you but we say thank you for your precious plant that says oh god where two or three are gathered together in my name there am I in the mid-south how do we thank you for the reality of your word so we know without a doubt that you are yield and we know without a doubt as you did this morning you will speak to our hearts again this evening but I might be standing here behind the sacred desk but lord I need as much speaking to as my god the believers of God Lord sitting in this sense so father we just come at this time into your wonderful hands Lord as nervous as I am I pray God and you just take the slips off plate but you just god bless you it's good brother nd to be in the house of the Lord if you have your Bibles I've just got two scriptures now I'm not a preacher like bah Freddie he's seasoned I'm still a boy preacher Rambo but I trust the Lord I mean just the same scripture that was read this morning Isaiah chapter 55 and we'll just read this 10 and 11 streeted again it says for as the rain comes down and the snow from heaven and returneth not feather but what with the earth and make it bring maketh it bring forth and but and it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing whereto i said i'm grateful for the reality of this word I've experiences whether James in my life Amen we can just turn to another Psalm chapter 63 and then we can take our seats Psalm 63 and if you have it it says O God thou art my god early will I seek thee my soul thirsteth for thee my flesh long before thee in a dry and thirsty land when know what is to see thy power and thy glory so as I have seen thee in the sanctuary because thy loving-kindness is better than life my lips shall praise thee that's what I bless the one I love I will lift up my hands in thy name my soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips when I remember thee upon my bed and made a take on thee in the night watches because thou has been my help therefore in the shadow of thy Wings will I rejoice o God thou art my god praise the name of the Lord you may be seated this evening in the presence of Almighty God is just a privilege to be here and this evening with a band thank you so much for allowing us the opportunity just to be and believe us thank you for for for allowing us to stand here and personally I don't take things like this lightly this I believe is life or death and we don't play around when it comes to the things of God so I'm just want to say thank you and you know we arrived here on Tuesday and we're leaving tomorrow but you know what this has been an awesome week Russ you know we we've gone out we've seen but of Wellington but just meeting up with the believers you know in just just sitting and having some beautiful foods man brother nd and brother Cobain and and brother Armand thank you so much you know just the food is awesome but you know what the fellowship was just so great you know I I love you know just sitting one-on-one and just just listen and you get to realize and you get to appreciate each other so much more you get to sit in New Year the testimonies all the believers in you you discover how a God has brought them from where they are today and you say Lord thank you so much because father I can identify with these testimonies and that's where I read the scripture tonight it says David says O God thou art my god so tonight I want to brag about my god these are loving reality to me personally he's done too much for me I cannot tell it all excuse me I just I get very enthused I gotta help her but he's done too much for me miss miss miss picked me from wherever I was he's picked me up from the band he's turned me around he checked me on the road toward my adoption it was my body change I love him and I don't just say it because I want you you know just to make you feel good I love my Jesus he sees an amazing chord he's a God by the island it can be touched by the feeling of your infirmities he's a God that knows when you go in through certain situations when you go in through certain trials when you go in through certain tests he's not a god that's on the outside that does not know what you going he's a god the Bible says that can be touched by the feeling of your infirmities he knows what it's like to get a headache so when you get a headache and he said Oh God help me heal me he knows what you going through he's a god that can be touched by the feeling of my infirmities and I've seen it I've experienced it I've got a quote here the deity of Jesus Christ but the blenheim talked he he talks about the blood of Jesus but he says he says because we know the Bible says God he's a spirit so he says talking about the blood he says how was it God's blood he says God has no blood how could it be because it was God's creative blood that he created in order to redeem us and came and loved in the same body that he created therefore now the Branham says God had to suffer but the Brennan says as God he couldn't suffer temptation but the Brennan says he had to suffer sexual temptation he had to suffer all kinds of temptation to be tempted by the devil in riches and power and Dominion and so forth to suffer all of that so that ye can be touched by the feeling of your infirmities so when you get tempted he knows he knows what it likes what it is like to be tempted and that is why he's a god that can come down to whatever whether it's a little child that's my god he can come and you can meet that little child at the level that let little child ease with him he can come and he can meet the minister at the level that the minister is with him he can come with a deacon with you the pasta he can meet you at your feet and you know what he's a god that loves he's a God that forgives that's my god revising I failed God so me know I was testifying to the church last week I testified and I told him couple of weeks ago something happened in my life and I felt that I had slipped and I had disappointed the Lord and I made a mistake I went to God I said lord I didn't mean that I slipped I fell but lord I want to keep up and I said lord I am sorry please forgive me and so the Slovak said the Sunday before lost I came into church and I sat in the bench and the pastor preached that powerful sermon I wanted to stand up and I wanted to raise my hand and I wanted to say Amen them to plant in my mind [Music] say Amen you remember what happened how can you how can you even raise your hand but it was a sort of few seconds and they winded that thought came to me I rebuke the devil in me as a devil you got nothing for me I'm a son of God I went to You Lord and I said I'm sorry [Applause] so I raised my head in fact I raised both hands and I was free you see because that is what the devil likes to do he likes to do that to the people of God we human rebirth the Bible says we bought flesh we make mistakes but they know the Dharma is a song it says Watson what's in it is gone the very minute you confessed so we failed God we make mistakes but God you know we gotta go team and say Lord forgive me and then he forgives and it's gone and the devil cannot bring it up before you again so when he tries when he tries to bring up that post before you and you know you can talk to the people and you say devil what sin you talking about it was gone the very minute I confessed that's what I love about this walk as a believer we walk in victory to read you another quote possessing the enemy's gates but the Branham praise of pray now Lord now our God and we are your servants we thank you for your word you know how thankful I am for the Word of God it's transformed my life he says we thank you for your word for the Holy Spirit who has blessed our hearts and now we happy we sitting here knowing that we are conquerors we already possess all the gates of the enemy it has been given to us and he says we have the master key in our hand you as you said yet tonight this evening you have with a Branham identify a master key in your head they know what a master key is this is probably a building is about many rooms and probably each room will have a different key and footing that door a master key is a key that you bring and a key that and go into every single door in this building and that can open up every single door in this building never the Brenin seized with a master key in our hand and then he identifies what this master key is he says the name of Jesus Christ shall open every date of the enemy take verse P the key of the name of Jesus and open every gate of the enemy that has you bound away from every promise so right now is your city to a mosque and maybe some of us might be sitting here and we might have boss or gates maybe gates of the pastor or certain gates that's that they'd be struggling to overcome the master key himself is yeah and the master key has given himself to you and to me he's saying Here I am use me I'm the master key I did go into that door that door that you think the enemy has not and he's sitting being Glee with Glee on his face and dangling his key in front of you you and I today brother branham identified the mosque as the name I read this quote in South Africa one time in a church and a young sister was sitting in the meeting you see these quotes that we read it's not just good black letters on white paper this quote is powerful this quotes that we read and she went home that night and the next day she was facing some situation and she told the Lord for the tears of yesterday telling me I have a must that can unlock every door every situation and she said Lord right now I want to use that master key in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and she says I used that master key for that situation and she said that door had to open even though it looked like it was locked we love the Word of God I just love this precious you know this you will somebody see that this message it's don't ever down please the value of this message this message is powerful this message is life-changing this message takes you and turns you around maybe you were walking with your back to God but this message has come your way turned you around and sit you on the right Road and a lot of times for the young people a lot of times we hear this hype sometimes that says you know Mike he says yeah we all end time red light down flesh coming of the Lord is at hand yes sir he says endtime message should meet end conditions look around look at the world that we're facing fault on every hand and time conditions this message is as powerful as it was then it's as powerful today so young people don't let me ever hear you say it's hard that this message is not powerful enough I want you to know that take the squirts put it on your phone or whatever and time message should meet endtime conditions don't forget that the enemy's going to try and his Trident with many people many people like we heard this morning has walked away because they didn't understand or maybe never had the revelation or I don't know but I want you to know tonight I don't see this evening I want you to some times you look at the situation it's powerful enough to make you walk with all the demonic forces around it's powerful enough to make you walk and not allow yourself to be defiled but the things happening around us you see I grew up in the message and I took discover after a while that this message it's not just a bunch of complicated intellectual quotes it's not just a bunch of complicated intellectual words cuz that's how I grew up sitting with with my family very intellectual sitting with my family my uncles and and the brothers and jjust man taking the message and splicing it's you splicing it year and doing that then explaining this explaining that and that's what I thought the message was the more I could quote brother Brennan the more I felt her I'm in the message but God had to come and deal with me personally anything she came to tell me she tears you have a relationship with the quotes with a letter you have a relationship with scripture you have a relationship with the picture brother branham but tears you don't have a relationship with me that's regarding to come and tell me in 1994 before that I was just walking along as a message member loving what they call a message lifestyle he'll miss his lifestyle long hair long dress brothers don't wait dude all these things the rules in the end them in the do's and the don'ts and that was my life but then Jesus came my way he turned me around and he came to tell me you have to know the quotes don't get me wrong you have to know the quotes but it's not an intellectual thing it's not about how much you know it's about who you know and thus close you and me we have to manifest the quotes that speaks about me so this morning pas fini came in he said then this is my favorite quote and he read his favorite quotes now I want to read you my favorite quote because this is a favorite quote and I see happening in my life statue of a perfect man never ate that never listened to it go listen to it statue of a perfect man 62 1014 in the morning he says and this is my favorite he says we not both organization I'm not here this morning to build an organization Christ never sent me to build organization of the next part but it's he says Christ see me do bold individuals do the statue of Jesus Christ that they might be the powerhouse and the dwelling place of the spirit by his word this is my quote so when I read it I say God sent me to build casual to the statue of Jesus Christ the casual might be the powerhouse and the dwelling place of the spirit by his words that's my and by the end do you know what I see happening in my life what did my wife sing little by little we will win every battle we see little by little he's molding tests lots of by little he's cutting off the things that doesn't belong little by little he's forming tests were all into that perfect image of Jesus Christ so this message is not a bunch of complicated intellectual Wednesday this message is showing us who the devil really is not this guy with their horns in a red tail and a pitchfork this word of God this message the revealed word is showing us who the devil and this word the devil is the devil is like a dog that the Lord says okay you want job okay you can go but pay certain conditions you can go devil is nd whatever so what did you use the devil he's like we're getting ya wasn't as beginnings further the chips the chips bargaining that you think you can just break it the devil he is powerless okay okay I know he's powerful but with God in the ship of our lives the devil he's powerless he's got nothing against you oh yeah he tries he tries things but he's like a burger in ships brother Andy I believe whether James got so inspired but the change was in Christ Church and he was listening to the sermon over there in here but the end he was preaching and behind you see the devil is like like like I like bargaining's and by the James got so inspired about a James put a song together is it resents the temple is like beginnings now we know we don't play around with it when we read in the Bible how Daniel prayed and then at the end of the day they need reinforcements but we're God in the ship of our lives the devil has got nothing on doing me so this precious message this revealed word you see the message for me it's taken this Bible and let's open it up that's what's that you know for years I used to read this Bible it was just nothing but the atom and it was just a bunch of good stories they everything lieth and all those good stories but since the Lord revealed this precious message it just took this Bible and it just opened and I started seeing myself in the Word of God because that is what this message is also doing this message is showing you who you are that you are not some downtrodden something but you are sons and daughters of the Most High God this message is revealing something powerful worth in you don't ever forget that please because that is what the enemy it rises things were the people of God but I want you to know that this message is showing you that there's something powerful with ensure the message is showing me that is more I'm more than just a happy clappy Jessica yes I get it say that yes I didn't post something and I feel it in me I feel it pulsating within me you know one day I was driving and it was this there was this evil spirit it was just the stabbing this evil spirit was just trying to keep now remember I was driving in my car in Cambridge before I go on but the David Shearer at police he said I must greet the church for the bin from Cambridge where the David Shirley is the only he's one of the brothers in Cambridge at the Lourdes just allowed us to connect so when he heard me coming here he said please greet the believers so I want to greet you from brother David Shearer I was driving in my car as I was driving I started talking I said I feel in my just change something then I heard myself it's like I was sitting in the passenger seat I was watching myself I heard words coming from my mouth speaking to this evil spirits and it was words it just just flowed it addressed that when I came out of it I just I'd I was so weak and I I took my car I turned it around and I came home and in a night I pulled up in my driveway I got that to the coin I was walking like a drunk bus and I walked into the house in my wife said hey you okay what's wrong so I'm going to go throw myself on the sofa and I said I need to rest a bit off powers vested strength came back into me but do you know what the beautiful part of the season I'm the kind of person I'm very emotional I get very but I don't allow the emotion to dictate and I want to see so the next day I watched it and no no no no demon trying to disturb me the next week I watched it nothing the next month but went on to a year two years later and that the Devils are subject to the name of Jesus when he brought the pregnancy's house of hell deep way to the name of Jesus you see the devil has brought to tremble now when I read you the quote a poor Freddy referred to this morning sorry I appreciate my father-in-law I am in fact more Doreen was my Sunday school teacher and then I grew up with parfait lien under the ministry of poverty and occasionally he rebukes me it's me it's me but you know what I appreciate that because it's helping me so I appreciate my father-in-law very much and I was the one with over the Ben some other pain I did have a more definite orders coming salaried this but random says the preaches called to preach and to love it if you can't love it then you stop preaching it but you supposed to love your sermons Tim brother branham's is all right oh how we need in Jeffersonville thousands of loved voices the Thunder of God thundering out in sweetness and holiness purity and defiled lives walking around in the earth today without a blemish yes milk that's thunder against the energy the devil don't care how loud you can holler the devil don't care how much you can jump oh how much you can do this or shouts but what hurts the devil is to see that sanctified Holy life consecrated to God say anything to him call him anything just as sweet as can be oh my brother balances that throws him away that's the thunder that shakes the devil you wanna shake the devil be a real Christian don't be a wishy-washy curser be a real Christian brother branham identifies on your Christian sweetness holiness purity and defile lives without the blemish sanctified holy life consecrated to God that's how you can shake the devil in your home that's how you shake the devil fact I told my kids this week I said we're going back now and it's gonna be some changes there's going to be some changes it's going to happen if you wanna shake the devil you shake the devil in your life you're facing situations in your home maybe the kids are behaving or certain things you go you changed in your I love but you know I it was a timing recently actually the Lord has really led me to look at the life just look at how he can learn so much and I look and this is this one incident it always just just you know this we me I think he's meters in the kitchens wife and she's all you know just stress out and the kids are all going crazy that side what I love for the been who came in Dean he could have come and seen a meter I am a prophet I'm a man of God behave yourself conduct yourself like a wife of a prophet but he didn't he went in there and he only did he went inside he put on an apron and he he went to go help in the kitchen and speaking about the dress and speaking about this and that and as he spoke about that and it's just as I was doing that around my wife started changing he didn't even go through his children and say hey Shh God you see how mom is in a stressed out state that he went to his wife change the as it changed by her just float and he says the children started quietly now that wasn't only for that's for you and for me you can change the apples you can change situations in your home just another courtier crisis the mystery of God I love the courts but for me you know it's more than a court these are things that I want to see manifest but the Branham says justified in his sight why are we justified we are his victory you as you said you are his the church is his victory we come forth in this last days this glorious gospel showing so as you love your life as a Christian you are showing his victory he died for this purpose and we are proof of his victory when we see him coming down in loving amongst the church that's his victory it shows that he couldn't keep in the grave neither can they keep us in the grave we are life is his life that's flowing and pulsating within us and I'm grateful to Almighty God to know that Calvary because of Calvary I am NOT the man I used to be thanks to Calvary because of what he did for you and what he did for me we can walk in victory I'm gonna finish it with this musicians can come it's a quote that my favorite brother-in-law in New Zealand he raided many years ago and I just couldn't get away from this now I'm gonna end up with this musician joking come it's in the message the great and mighty conqueror but since men was refused from heaven the highways was closed there was no highways but the balances but where there was no highways he come to make him brother branham's thoughts dramatizing he says oh my he says the first line around the earth was demons of doubts he says then the next line was prejudice he says the next was selfishness he says this earth was covered over with lines of deep pain sicknesses diseases him by the brand name refers to the sermon he says last night we heard him coming out of hell with the keys of death and how on his side this morning by the Benham says we taking him up they by the balances hallelujah then Dan the Baron says when he arose he was he broke every devil power that holds over man so been abandoned first early said this world was covered with demonic powers for the Branham says as he went up he broke every devil power that holds over man so if you think that there's a devil power that's trying to hold you down Jesus Christ broker every devil power [Applause] [Music] that holds over man he has seen that on high so that's my my alum I don't want to preach too long yeah he has seen that on high and gave leads to mean the gift of the Holy Spirit the mighty Conqueror he stands alone and brother Branham says between he is the blessed and mate for us for you and for me all the way through Easter so you see all he wants of us is to walk and to follow in his bloody footprints he left this and we walk he left the days and we walked the demon might be yeah the devil's might be there but we walk and as long as you walking following the bloody footprints of Jesus Christ no devil I want to let you know no devil that did these faulty hands on you because you're walking you following the bloody footprints are you walking huh and as the word goes this way you're walking you following in pizza bloody footprints so god bless you keep walking don't look for the left don't look for the right there's evil all around but you just walk and as you walk he's leaning uh-huh and where he leads I will follow some through the waters some through the flight some for
