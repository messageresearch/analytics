[19:58] blind the minds of men to stop them
[20:00] hearing the gospel and I pray Lord that
[20:03] the gospel of Jesus Christ would go
[20:05] forth in the same power that it went
[20:08] forth and Cornelius's house Lord Jesus
[20:11] when the kingdom was ministered to the
[20:14] Gentiles and and the Holy Ghost fell
[20:16] upon the people
[20:17] I asked Lord in Jesus Christ's name that
[20:20] you're the same tonight Lord and I'm
[20:23] calling on the same Jesus that Peter
[20:26] preached hallelujah the same Jesus that
[20:29] Paul preached the same Jesus that
[20:31] william branham preached I'm calling on
[20:34] that a God of the Bible to come and
[20:36] speak to us Lord and let the power of

[20:54] glorified Lord may your holy spirit have
[20:57] preeminence and every gift in every
[21:00] heart and every mind keep us tuned in
[21:02] and focused on you tonight Lord but we'd
[21:05] love to hear your word and be brought
[21:07] right into harmony with your heartbeat

[21:12] keep us there Lord and may you tune our
[21:14] thinking and calibrate us Lord to stay
[21:17] and rhythm Lord and keep in line or
[21:20] guard with the word and with the very
[21:22] the rhythm of your symphony as it beats
[21:25] out the very will of God in this hour or
[21:28] father and the midst of this perilous
[21:30] seas that are raging all around her
[21:33] father there is an anchor there is a
[21:35] stabilizer on the ship father all Lord
[21:39] may your word just become and stabilize
[21:41] father the ship of Zion that we sail
[21:45] together and as individual
[21:47] I commit these things to you I pray
[21:50] father you just take over Lord have your
[21:52] way tonight Lord I just came at these
[21:55] things into your hands and Jesus Christ
[21:57] name Amen hallelujah praise the Lord
[22:01] amen
[22:02] thank you musicians hallelujah while
[22:08] you're standing let's just turn in our
[22:09] Bibles to Ephesians chapter five I was
[22:15] going to speak sorry I once I was gonna
[22:18] sing a song and open the eyes of my
[22:20] heart Lord to see you high and lifted up
[22:23] that you know it was a different team
[22:25] pone wasn't gonna merge into the from
[22:28] that song so the praise the Lord anyway
[22:31] I'll talk about that you know that's
[22:33] what we want that's what we desire
[22:34] tonight as like Isaiah and as is-6 I
[22:38] mean you know God just caught him up and
[22:41] he saw the Lord as he is he saw the Lord
[22:44] High and lifted up a man he saw the
[22:46] worship of God he saw God in his
[22:49] position and I want to tell you tonight
[22:51] and you many have heard it and I'll just
[22:53] remind you because Peter seemed like to
[22:55] bring these things into remembrance that
[22:57] we have also been called into that
[22:59] relationship tonight you can see him
[23:03] high and lifted you can behold one that
[23:07] sitteth upon the throne they meant he
[23:09] caught up into his throne room
[23:10] hallelujah Ephesians 5:25 26 and 27
[23:16] husbands love your wives even as Christ
[23:19] also loved the church and gave himself
[23:21] for it that he might sanctify and
[23:24] cleanse it with the washing of water by
[23:26] the word that he might present it to
[23:30] himself
[23:31] so there's a is a key right there a
[23:35] mystery to be unfolded and I believe it
[23:38] has been unfolded in the statement that
[23:40] he might present it her the church to
[23:43] himself a glorious church not having
[23:47] spot or wrinkle or any such thing but
[23:50] that it should be holy and without
[23:52] blemish
[23:53] maybe the Lord is blessing to his word
[23:56] you can have your seats
[23:58] hallelujah well you see here the Lord
[24:01] has a desire in his heart here's a
[24:03] purpose in his heart
[24:05] he wants to restore the woman he wants
[24:09] to restore the woman the feminine image
[24:12] of God that says desire he wants to
[24:15] restore her and that is the joy that's
[24:18] been in his heart since before the world
[24:20] even began he's wanted to restore that
[24:23] because he knew that she would fall amen
[24:26] she and he knew that their Eve would
[24:28] fall the woman and the garden would fall
[24:31] so he needed to restore that and we
[24:33] believe now that this was coming to pass
[24:35] in the hour that we're living in
[24:37] hallelujah and it has been going on for
[24:40] the last two thousand years
[24:41] hallelujah since the gospel went forth
[24:43] and the church era started and the New
[24:46] Testament began to minister freedom amen
[24:49] and when the voice of the blood of
[24:51] Christ started to speak and cause
[24:53] freedom to come upon the people he began
[24:56] to rebuild the female image he began to
[24:59] rebuild the church amen and she's been
[25:02] through many appear Allah sees many are
[25:05] trials many of persecutions she suffered
[25:08] she's gone through at all but through it
[25:10] all God has always come out victorious
[25:12] amen and here's all he's just rebuilding
[25:15] he's rebuilding you know when you're in
[25:17] a situation that might look like it's
[25:19] completely like just gone but to God
[25:23] it's a different story
[25:24] amen God has it all in control he's the
[25:27] great Orchestrator Amen hallelujah well
[25:30] I won't get ahead of myself
[25:31] let's just go to Ephesians 32 and I just
[25:34] want to you know just uh sorry Ephesians
[25:36] 5 verse 32 and it says here this is a
[25:40] great mystery but I speak concerning
[25:41] Christ and the church amen
[25:43] so it's a great mystery it's not just a
[25:45] mystery but it's a great mystery but and
[25:48] really when you start to see these
[25:49] things you'll find the whole Bible is
[25:51] kind of centered around this very
[25:53] mystery of the man and the woman getting
[25:55] married amen and through that marriage
[25:58] would come redemption of no matter what
[26:00] state that woman was in in the story and
[26:02] it's through all of the holy prophets
[26:04] and all of the stories of the Bible
[26:06] you'll see there is an account of this
[26:09] particular thing happen
[26:10] where a woman was in trouble and she was
[26:13] completely just out of her position and
[26:16] then through marriage and through
[26:18] Redemption and a foreshadow and through
[26:21] the Old Testament stories you find a
[26:23] redemption by marriage
[26:25] hallelujah where no matter what
[26:27] condition or what state that woman was
[26:30] in she came into a perfect position in
[26:32] God's will and her life wrote the Bible
[26:36] that you read hallelujah amen and that's
[26:38] the power of God without interfering
[26:40] with their free will and all so God was
[26:43] very amazing actually more beyond
[26:45] anything we could ever imagine so you
[26:47] never need to worry about anything ever
[26:49] again don't worry about anything ever
[26:51] again if you just trust in Him who will
[26:54] not leave you amen nor forsake you amen
[26:57] no matter how tumultuously release the
[27:00] Seas you may be walking don't you take
[27:04] your eyes off him hallelujah
[27:06] you know if you take if you keep your
[27:08] eyes on him you will remain in the faith
[27:11] of the Son of God amen and you will walk
[27:14] on the water hallelujah
[27:17] you have been called to walk on water
[27:19] and that's what I want to speak on
[27:21] tonight as being called to walk on water
[27:24] we're not called to sink amen and the
[27:27] bride and this last day the church at
[27:29] the end when it's the very masterpiece
[27:33] of God's building hallelujah the very
[27:36] the very crescendo of God's symphony
[27:39] that all the stories of the prophets and
[27:41] all of the everything in the Bible
[27:43] points to the hour that you're living in
[27:46] hallelujah and by God's grace you are
[27:49] becoming the masterpiece of God's
[27:51] crescendo hallelujah amen and you just
[27:55] happened to be living in this hour and
[27:57] he made you for this hour and he made
[28:00] you and is calling you to walk on water
[28:03] amen hallelujah I won't get ahead of
[28:05] myself again but we'll just carry on
[28:06] here in an ex 3:19 it says here this is
[28:10] the way that she's restored and one view
[28:13] of it you could say annex --an 3 verse
[28:16] 19 we read repent ye therefore and be
[28:19] converted amen
[28:22] very nice and plain and simple
[28:24] hallelujah turn from your old ways your
[28:26] old thinking everything that you thought
[28:28] you were and everything you thought God
[28:30] was Amen just turn from it all and just
[28:34] just get converted come has provided
[28:36] wait hello Louie and and if you want to
[28:39] know who's provided way the Apostles did
[28:42] it Amen just so simple repent and be
[28:46] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[28:48] the remission of your sins and you shall
[28:50] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[28:52] hallelujah amen
[28:54] well repent ye therefore and be
[28:57] converted that your sins may be blotted
[28:59] out when the times of refreshing shall
[29:02] come here we see that Luke in the book
[29:06] of Acts is pointing and his narrative to
[29:08] a future event that there will be a time
[29:11] of refreshing to come from the presence
[29:13] of the Lord hallelujah you know back in
[29:17] 1947 when the angel of the Lord came to
[29:20] the Prophet on the very day of the
[29:22] inauguration of Israel and how it all
[29:24] kind of synchronized together in God's
[29:27] great plan where did the angel say he
[29:30] came from amen he came from the presence
[29:34] of the law amen
[29:36] it's very important when an angel of the
[29:39] Lord comes he's coming from the presence
[29:40] of the Lord and he has a message
[29:42] hallelujah amen if it's just a whole lot
[29:46] of miracles but no message then you can
[29:48] just forget about it because God doesn't
[29:50] do a show just to be a show when God
[29:53] sends a ministry there is always a voice
[29:56] behind that hallelujah and it's that
[29:59] voice that will bring divided division
[30:01] between light and dark it's that voice
[30:03] that will bring the new birth to its
[30:05] full extent it's that voice that will
[30:07] actually separate the sheep from the
[30:09] goats in that age it's that voice that
[30:11] will bring the new birth for the people
[30:13] that hear it hallelujah when God speaks
[30:16] amen
[30:17] but so here we have the time of
[30:19] refreshing shall come from the presence
[30:21] of the Lord and in verse 20 and he shall
[30:25] send Jesus Christ so there will come a
[30:28] time you know in the future from their
[30:30] age that they were living and there
[30:32] would be a refreshing there would be a
[30:33] rejuvenating of the church
[30:36] because obviously the church would go
[30:38] through so many trials and so much
[30:40] hardship and so much too much was the
[30:42] sea would get so rough that the ship
[30:44] would start rocking and water would come
[30:46] in and there would be all sorts of
[30:48] troubles but at the end of it God would
[30:52] restore it he would bring it back and
[30:54] how would he do it he would send Jesus
[30:56] Christ amen
[30:58] there would come a time where a mist
[31:00] where a reformers and we're teachers and
[31:02] we're pastors and all of those would not
[31:04] be enough to do the restoration work
[31:07] would not be enough to bring everything
[31:09] back together tie all the loose ends
[31:12] that the church was found herself in it
[31:14] would have to be Jesus Christ himself
[31:25] praise Allah amen I did brought it I
[31:29] brought it down because I didn't want to
[31:30] like bang into it or you know things get
[31:34] a bit active up here some prepare you
[31:40] know amen
[31:45] we'll see what happens this is more of a
[31:48] teaching but well yeah I just lift them
[31:53] in the Lord's hands so amen so so yes so
[32:00] he shall send Jesus Christ which before
[32:04] was preached right so before the sending
[32:09] of Jesus Christ himself Jesus Christ was
[32:11] preached about he was taught the
[32:14] precepts of the Bible were taught and
[32:17] everyone was teaching about Jesus Christ
[32:19] but then one day the very person will
[32:22] minister it himself and he would tie it
[32:25] all together himself now there's no
[32:28] other way and I'll get into it a bit
[32:29] later but there's no other way for that
[32:31] to happen other than through the office
[32:33] of a word prophet there's no other way
[32:36] no teacher a teacher we'll have a little
[32:38] portion they'll get inspiration and
[32:39] they'll see the Scriptures come together
[32:40] but it's not verbatim it's not that
[32:44] they're not exactly a full-time
[32:46] mouthpiece of God their subconscious and
[32:48] their conscious minds are not perfect
[32:50] we won together where God just speaks
[32:51] and they see the vision God makes a word
[32:53] prophet a word prophet to be a channel
[32:56] amen and there's two there's two main
[32:59] prompt there's a lot of different
[33:01] obviously God as a God a variety but
[33:02] I've seen you know there's two different
[33:04] types of prophet like major prophets in
[33:06] the Bible there's a major prophet that
[33:08] writes the scripture like Isaiah Ezekiel
[33:11] Moses and then is a major prophet that
[33:15] that takes the scripture and makes it
[33:17] live there and that's like Samuel so
[33:19] Samuel as far as we know did not write
[33:22] anything himself but there was a
[33:24] narration about him and he was a major
[33:26] prophet that took the very you know the
[33:29] the very few the the condition of a
[33:32] nation and and and turned it around and
[33:35] brought the vision back to a nation and
[33:37] that was that's a different type of
[33:39] prophet so you see there's two types of
[33:41] prophets in the scripture and the end
[33:44] time prophet because the Canon of
[33:45] Scripture has been completed there is no
[33:48] more scripture to be written per se
[33:50] written text so therefore there is no
[33:54] need for a prophet to come to write more
[33:56] Bible but there was need to be a prophet
[33:59] like Samuel to bring a vision of God a
[34:02] heavenly vision back so that the very
[34:05] voice of God and the presence of God and
[34:07] the approach to God could be restored so
[34:10] that all the word and all the
[34:11] interpretation of the word would come
[34:13] together so the people could have be
[34:16] anchored in the fullness of the truth
[34:18] and when you believe that watch what
[34:21] happens Alleluia Amen you'll walk on
[34:25] water amen all things hallelujah so it
[34:30] says here which before was preached unto
[34:34] you whom the heaven must receive until
[34:37] the times of restitution of all things

[34:42] reconstitution that's like putting the

[35:00] coming forth it's not just knowledge to
[35:02] you you

[35:05] you don't want it to be if you want it
[35:06] to be more than knowledge I can

[35:53] because we're in an age where we won't
[35:55] sink hallelujah you know walking on the
[35:58] water is walking in Adam's shoes before
[36:00] the fall don't you you know because when
[36:03] Adam before the fall he had dominion
[36:05] over everything he had dominion over
[36:07] nature he had dominion over the animals
[36:09] was first to see everything and so when
[36:12] you see Jesus Amen when you see Jesus
[36:15] coming he was he had Dominion and he
[36:18] showed the very Dominion to Adam lost
[36:20] that's why he was the second Adam you
[36:23] know the second Adam come to declare and
[36:25] to reveal everything that the first Adam
[36:28] lost and that second Adam his main
[36:31] purpose was though that you would also
[36:33] do the same things hallelujah and he's
[36:35] very patient he's been waiting a long
[36:37] time God's been waiting 2,000 years for
[36:40] his church to recognize what's going on
[36:42] recognize the power in his blood tonight
[36:45] you can feel that car you can have that
[36:47] power
[36:48] tonight the blood can speak to you
[36:50] hallelujah it can speak I hear the sound
[36:54] of freedom amen
[36:55] what was that song remember that song
[36:57] you know the blood still cries freedom
[37:00] hallelujah I'm so glad about that
[37:03] and the power of that blood when that
[37:05] was released on the day hallelujah when
[37:07] he hung between heaven and earth with a
[37:09] power that blood is here tonight
[37:11] hallelujah to bring you to God's River
[37:15] realization
[37:16] hallelujah and the water the restitution
[37:19] the reconstitution of your life can
[37:22] happen now because that's what is here
[37:24] to do and the most important thing we
[37:26] can find out you know once once we hear
[37:29] about Jesus and we hear about that we
[37:31] start to believe that he's real the most
[37:33] important thing we can do is give all
[37:34] diligence to make our calling and
[37:37] election sure and just lay before God
[37:39] and let him come hallelujah
[37:42] so that you can recognize and see him
[37:45] and see what he's doing in the hour you
[37:48] know when you find out what God is doing
[37:49] in the hour that you're living in now
[37:52] you can get a vision for your life
[37:53] it's not until you do that otherwise
[37:56] you're just stabbing in the dark and
[37:58] you're like any other denomination and
[38:00] you might hear things and hear preaching
[38:02] and all that stuff and it might just
[38:04] float around in your mind but when God
[38:06] makes it real to you when it's quickened
[38:09] to you the very magnitude of what's
[38:11] going on in this very moment this hour
[38:14] and what God is doing a vision has been
[38:18] restored to the h.a vision can only come
[38:21] through a prophet
[38:22] that's the only way God brings a vision
[38:25] to an ageist through a prophetic Channel
[38:27] amen and when you catch that vision when
[38:30] he reveals that to you when he quickens
[38:32] that to you now you can seek God for the
[38:35] vision for your life based on that
[38:36] vision based on the vision of the age
[38:39] the vision that's been brought down
[38:41] Israel had no vision she had no vision
[38:45] she was scattered there you know hophni
[38:48] and Phinehas had been going and doing
[38:50] all sorts of things the High Priestess I
[38:52] clocked him you know all these things
[38:54] started falling apart they've went and
[38:56] fought the Philistines and they tried to
[38:57] rally themselves up they had a good old
[38:59] Pentecostal meeting but it didn't work
[39:01] because there was no vision it was no
[39:04] revelation of the word there was no
[39:06] vision there was no channel of
[39:07] inspiration from heaven to the earth to
[39:10] manifest God's will all there was was
[39:12] just the whole lot of rallying together
[39:14] and an excitement in singing all the
[39:17] church song trying to scare the enemy
[39:20] but the enemy called their bluff and
[39:22] they were defeated until God sent a
[39:25] prophet hallelujah
[39:28] he sent a prophet named Samuel and
[39:29] through that prophetic gift the vision
[39:32] was restored back and then the people
[39:34] could rise up hallelujah amen and you
[39:37] see at the time of venice'
[39:39] the Battle of Ebenezer this is one of
[39:41] the early battles in the time of Samuel
[39:43] what happened when when the prophet's
[39:46] ministry came into its possession
[39:47] hallelujah you know see what happened in
[39:50] the Thunder came amen
[39:51] hallelujah what are you under right now
[39:53] you are under a thundering message Amen
[39:57] hallelujah
[39:58] and where there's thunder there's
[39:59] lightning and where there's lightning
[40:01] this revelation of the word there is
[40:03] quickening power you can access that
[40:06] quickening power right now and that
[40:08] power will cause you to walk on the
[40:10] water you will walk on the water you are
[40:13] walking on the water walk on the water
[40:16] amen don't look at the Seas don't look
[40:19] at the things and all the politics and
[40:21] all those things going on it is all an
[40:23] orchestrated distraction don't look at
[40:26] it keep your eyes on him hallelujah he's
[40:29] walking on the water
[40:30] remember that this is the key here he is
[40:33] walking on the water not just you a man
[40:36] he walks on the water hey man he's got
[40:38] one foot on the water amen hallelujah
[40:41] and he stand here with an open book
[40:42] calling you to come and eat amen he
[40:45] wants you to walk on the water so that
[40:48] you could eat the word with him a man
[40:49] hallelujah
[40:50] I'm getting way down to the end of the
[40:53] sermon here a man but praise the Lord
[40:55] and Olivia I want to go back now just a
[41:02] little bit let's just go right back to
[41:04] the beginning here a little bit here and
[41:06] just see how God rebuilt the man he
[41:09] rebuilt the male image he needed to you
[41:11] see when Adam and Eve God created the
[41:14] earth and he and he brooded over the
[41:16] earth and he started to create and he
[41:18] brought all of creation up and up and up
[41:20] and it got more and more more and more
[41:22] detailed and more and more and more
[41:23] closer to his image until finally after
[41:27] six days of creation now it came time to
[41:32] create his very image and he put this
[41:35] image in the garden amen he planted a
[41:38] beautiful garden on the earth and then
[41:40] he put his son
[41:41] the very image of God in there but still
[41:44] wasn't complete then he put this man
[41:47] Adam to sleep and when he put him to
[41:50] sleep
[41:50] what happened out of his side came the
[41:53] revelation of Adams feminine part but
[41:57] when she was inside him he he was whole
[41:59] he was one but it wasn't the complete
[42:02] picture because he needed that love to
[42:05] come out and the love to be reciprocated
[42:07] and that's the joy of the relationship
[42:11] that's the joy of God is that there
[42:14] would be a woman with a man love each
[42:19] other and this is this this whole
[42:22] picture is the Bible and this whole
[42:24] picture is the Song of Solomon because
[42:27] through the Song of Solomon is very hard
[42:28] to discern but there is a man in a woman
[42:30] singing to each other they're communing
[42:32] with each other are you singing to him
[42:35] is your life singing are you singing the
[42:38] tune that he is singing as there our
[42:41] response is there now I don't mean just
[42:44] clapping and up and whatever I'm talking
[42:47] about a Holy Ghost eternity response a
[42:50] response from eternity to Eternity a
[42:54] response of the Shunammite in there and
[42:57] the son of David amen hallelujah the
[43:00] salt that the the you know Solomon was a
[43:02] type of Jesus Christ a type of the
[43:04] bridegroom and the Shunammite the bride
[43:05] amen and so you see there this song they
[43:10] should be singing to each other and this
[43:11] is a joy there is a joy there is a first
[43:14] love there is a an attraction amen now
[43:18] those seas
[43:19] that we're all raging around us they're
[43:21] raging Isaac brought it out very well
[43:23] perilous times absolutely perilous times
[43:27] we are and they come and comfort they
[43:30] come and convenience they come in all
[43:32] sorts of shapes and forms that's doesn't
[43:34] necessarily mean you're going through a
[43:35] trial that makes your flesh feel bad
[43:37] it's not just that you have those but
[43:39] there's trials that are different they
[43:42] are more cunning and they come in the
[43:44] form of comfort they come in the form of
[43:45] ease they come in the form of
[43:47] distraction they come in the form of
[43:49] lust they come in the form of all these
[43:51] different spirits and these spirits are
[43:53] everywhere Ten Thousand Devils of the
[43:55] I swear to drown you keep your eyes on
[43:59] him the whole time but don't just you
[44:03] know this is not just a pretty saying
[44:04] when I say keep your eyes on him I want
[44:06] to explain that a little bit it's not
[44:08] just I'm gonna keep my eyes on Jesus as
[44:11] like a catch phrase you know it's not a
[44:12] catch phrase there are something so real
[44:14] so real about your secret place there's
[44:19] something so real about your
[44:20] relationship with him hallelujah
[44:23] and if you don't have that dynamic that
[44:27] where he speaks to you doesn't matter
[44:30] what form he speaks but you there's a
[44:32] dialogue there's a conversation in your
[44:34] life if there isn't lay hold of it grab
[44:40] hold of that with all your strength and
[44:44] all your might you just lay it all down
[44:45] surrender everything leave no stone
[44:48] unturned lay it all down and say Lord
[44:51] don't want your conversation I want my
[44:54] life to be a song I want to sing but not
[44:57] with my mouth but with my heart to you
[45:01] hello Louie when you get that and you
[45:05] can have it's your inheritance
[45:07] they hold of it hallelujah because this
[45:10] is the fairy song this is the joy this
[45:12] is the desire of God this was the joy
[45:15] that was set before our King when he
[45:18] carried the cross up that hill that day
[45:20] amen hallelujah he was thinking of you
[45:22] and not just of you as a person but of
[45:25] the relationship that he would have with
[45:27] you and the joy of the song that your
[45:29] life would sing to him that's what he
[45:32] was thinking about that was what was on
[45:34] his mind because it says for the joy
[45:36] that was set before him you are their
[45:41] joy your response to his gospel your
[45:44] response to his song your response when
[45:49] he comes walking on the water a man when
[45:52] he's coming walking on the water in the
[45:54] churches and trouble hi Louie and he
[45:56] might have found you in some
[45:57] denominational boat hallelujah and the
[46:00] Seas have been perilous in this hour and
[46:04] here comes Jesus the Son of man walking
[46:07] on the water amen
[46:09] and he's coming to get you is coming to
[46:11] take you out hallelujah he's coming to
[46:14] call you to walk in the shoes of enna
[46:19] wants you to walk into a position where
[46:22] you rise up above the judgments of this
[46:24] earth where you rise up above the
[46:26] circumstances of this earth rise up in
[46:29] the name of the Lord
[46:30] rise up tonight step out of the boat
[46:33] spit out of the boat by faith keep your
[46:36] eyes on him
[46:37] don't think about what other people are
[46:39] thinking hallelujah you just think about
[46:42] what he's thinking his thoughts towards
[46:44] your our peace and love and unexpected
[46:46] in and he's come to give you power and
[46:49] love and a sound mind hallelujah a sound
[46:53] mind amen no more tossed to and fro by
[46:57] every wind of doctrine no more
[46:59] uncertainty but a rock hallelujah
[47:01] because of a lower because of a joy when
[47:05] Jesus saw you when he was carrying that
[47:07] cross with his blood spilling on the
[47:09] earth and his organs hanging out of his
[47:11] body purchasing you what a price he
[47:14] thought of you hallelujah he thought
[47:16] very highly of that relationship Amen
[47:19] hallelujah and has been preached about
[47:21] the alabaster box so true break it don't
[47:25] hold anything back
[47:25] when you break that box it's no return
[47:28] it's no return no return hey man
[47:31] hallelujah amen
[47:34] glory to God you see now this is the
[47:37] relationship that Adam and Eve had
[47:39] before the fall and they had dominion
[47:41] over everything it was a perfect
[47:43] condition yet there was things in their
[47:45] life and circumstances that would bring
[47:47] them to the demise and that that perfect
[47:50] man and that perfect woman would fall
[47:52] and then God would sit in his heart and
[47:55] in his mind
[47:56] hallelujah that he would spin now than
[47:58] the Old Testament he would spend it
[48:00] rebuilding the image of the man and he
[48:03] did this you see because when they fell
[48:04] he promised that he would restore their
[48:07] image back he promised that he would
[48:09] crush the head of the serpent by the
[48:11] seed of the woman and the seed of the
[48:13] woman is the perfect man the image of
[48:16] Christ the image of a son of God what nm
[48:19] fell from and so you see over throughout
[48:22] the new
[48:22] Old Testament you have all these
[48:24] prophets coming with a portion of that
[48:26] character a portion of that nature of
[48:29] God that was manifested in them but just
[48:31] a portion because God was slowly
[48:33] revealing his true image and then
[48:36] finally after four thousand years he
[48:39] came on the earth himself God the
[48:41] kinsman redeemer became a man because a
[48:44] man lost it and a man a human needed to
[48:48] bring it back hallelujah it needed to be
[48:51] a man and I'm so glad for our champion
[48:53] hallelujah our champion came to bring it
[48:56] back hallelujah and he's brought it back
[48:59] and he's calling you to step out at the
[49:02] boat tonight to step out and walk on the
[49:04] water hallelujah it is possible because
[49:08] all things are possible because he's
[49:10] walking on the water amen and where the
[49:13] Spirit of the Lord comes upon my heart
[49:15] amen
[49:16] it makes me want to walk on the water
[49:17] amen that's what it is this is the this
[49:22] is the power invested a man that was
[49:26] going through his faith and he walked
[49:28] the earth and he ministered and he
[49:30] preached and he conducted himself
[49:32] because he was declaring the image of a
[49:35] true man the image of a son of God he
[49:38] took control over nature amen he had
[49:40] dominion he never went to a funeral
[49:42] hallelujah whenever people was sad he
[49:44] turned them into rejoicing amen because
[49:47] death had to flee hallelujah Amen no
[49:50] circumstance could take mastery over our
[49:52] king over our Lord because he was to
[49:54] clearing the image of a true man but
[49:56] that's not the end of the story there
[49:58] was an unexpressed part within him amen
[50:02] and this was the the part just like
[50:04] there was an unexpressed part in Adam
[50:06] and it took the father to put out him to
[50:08] sleep and open his side and bring out
[50:11] their unexpressed part for her to come
[50:14] to her position and have a love
[50:16] relationship that would respond ask the
[50:21] Lord the Lord I need that channel open
[50:25] to my life
[50:26] that the response would be the fullness
[50:30] of what you have purchased not just
[50:33] something that I've controlled up
[50:34] I've been preached then I feel excited
[50:36] so I'm gonna worship or your they's all
[50:38] good but it's more these are channels
[50:41] that the blood that which cries freedom
[50:44] he's making you free to respond like the
[50:48] shunammite responded to Solomon
[50:50] hallelujah amen and so you see here he
[50:55] had but he took he took victory over all
[50:57] that he spoke the word happened he had
[50:59] power over cooked food and he created
[51:01] food that was already cooked and they
[51:03] ate it all these things happen because
[51:05] he was declaring he had dominion and
[51:07] everything that had him lost hallelujah
[51:10] and he came and let me just read it now
[51:12] Matthew 14 verse 22 says in straightway
[51:19] Jesus constrained when you found the
[51:22] scriptures say Amen 14 verse 22
[51:28] Romans smiling at me we were just saying
[51:32] that earlier 22 and straightway Jesus
[51:37] constrained his disciples to get into a
[51:40] ship and to go before him and to the
[51:43] other side while he sent the multitudes
[51:45] away and when he had sent the multitudes
[51:47] away he went up into a mountain apart to
[51:50] pray and when the evening was come at
[51:53] evening now it's a key evening was come
[51:55] he was there alone but the ship was now
[51:58] in the midst of the sea so the church
[52:00] that called the ecclesia of God which is
[52:04] the church has called people now what
[52:07] symbolically now has been called in
[52:09] there in the shippers eye on him but
[52:10] it's getting too rough and things are
[52:12] becoming too much hallelujah and the
[52:15] heads there come a time of restitution
[52:16] there has to come a time where he
[52:19] himself would come and he would rescue
[52:21] them amen he was interceding for them up
[52:24] on a hill up in the heavenly places up
[52:27] in the heavenly realm interceding but
[52:28] they had to come a time where he himself
[52:31] would come and he would rescue them
[52:34] Alleluia what would he do he would walk
[52:36] on the water other
[52:38] and he would call them come walk on the
[52:41] water take Dominion back take your
[52:44] Dominion back the devil may have been
[52:47] hounding you
[52:48] he may be pestering your oppressing you
[52:50] trying to possess you just you just
[52:53] address him hallelujah there is power in
[52:56] the name of Jesus to destroy any devil
[52:59] cast them off you know for nine months I
[53:03] struggled with a demon of unbelief when
[53:05] I first got saved and it was treacherous
[53:07] it was horrible a mile I was in a boat
[53:10] and it was rocking and rolling and so
[53:12] horrible and it was and I believe but I
[53:15] but this dis devil it just keep telling
[53:18] me God is not real God is not real God
[53:21] is not real I didn't understand
[53:22] spiritual warfare until one day I heard
[53:25] a prophet speak a man I heard a voice
[53:27] behind the voice in it and he said that
[53:30] you just cast it down anything that
[53:33] speaks to you that is not the word as
[53:35] the devil amen and you can cast that
[53:38] down take up your sword cast it down
[53:42] Amen you used the name of Jesus Christ
[53:45] hallelujah don't use your name don't use
[53:48] some name of some man but you use the
[53:50] name of Jesus no man that is the name
[53:52] hallelujah and you will be free but you
[53:56] have to take out your sword and cut them
[53:58] hallelujah and the devil is here to
[54:01] excite and the Lord is here to expose
[54:03] the devil amen
[54:05] he is here to expose the devil because
[54:07] he see the devil will do everything he
[54:10] can to make you fear because the sooners
[54:12] your fearing and scared and all of those
[54:14] emotions and cripples faith hallelujah
[54:18] but God is here to deliver when perfect
[54:21] love comes in and perfect love is
[54:23] walking these pews right now
[54:25] perfect lovers come to sit next to you

[54:39] and vitamin hallelujah perfect love
[54:42] casts out all fear and when you when
[54:45] fear is gone you can believe Amen
[54:47] louia amen any country thought anything
[54:51] that comes to you any tumultuous sea
[54:53] that tries to raise up and cause you to
[54:55] sink in the water it's all it wants to
[54:57] do Peter he started walking now Peter
[54:59] the leader of the first church and then
[55:02] the first church age was headed other
[55:04] than this man that was given the keys to
[55:05] the kingdom amen but you see the very
[55:08] picture you see here of Peter stepping
[55:11] out coming the church the first church
[55:14] they came into that position and they
[55:16] tasted of it they tasted on that
[55:19] Dominion for a short time hallelujah but
[55:21] it wasn't their season it wasn't their
[55:24] season to eat the open book and live
[55:26] forever it wasn't their season it wasn't
[55:28] God's program for a rapture in that hour
[55:31] so you see Peter starts walking on the
[55:34] water and it's and in all the trouble
[55:36] starts and the trouble started in the
[55:38] first church very bad all little deeds
[55:41] of the Nicolaitans come in the sea
[55:42] started raging while the church was
[55:45] walking on the water starting to come
[55:46] into that position that Adam lost and
[55:49] then it got too much and they started
[55:51] looking at the circumstances and the
[55:53] church started to sink down because
[55:55] Peter was living at a time of what that
[55:58] church would do
[55:59] that church would have to go down into
[56:01] the ground and that seed would have to
[56:03] go down underground and God would have a
[56:05] witness for 900 years underground of a
[56:08] church that was hidden away that God
[56:10] would preserve a man so that one day
[56:13] after two thousand years of all through
[56:15] these trials and we don't understand
[56:17] always the trials that we're going
[56:18] through we don't understand why these
[56:21] things happen we don't understand
[56:23] sometimes we do and sometimes we don't
[56:25] sometimes God doesn't tell us you know
[56:27] why we're going through all those things
[56:29] and sometimes you know these things in
[56:31] our life they're you know they're just
[56:33] so troublesome to us and and we wonder
[56:36] why am I not being delivered of this
[56:37] thing why are these enemy stained they
[56:40] will be delivered amen you just keep
[56:43] seeking the Lord he will deliver those
[56:46] enemies and it's perfect timing
[56:47] just reach out and lay hold of your
[56:49] inheritance amen
[56:51] those the enemies have got no power over
[56:53] you they are shaking because they know
[56:56] their time is coming amen they know it's
[56:59] time
[57:00] right now in the restitution of all
[57:02] things the enemy's kingdom is shaking
[57:04] hell annoying because there is a king
[57:06] walking on the water a man he's walking
[57:09] on the water and he's calling people up
[57:11] into their positions he's calling you
[57:13] that's why I wrote that song you know he
[57:16] is calling me and to heaven through a
[57:18] mighty voice amen he's calling me to
[57:20] lean on his chest how do you lean on his
[57:23] chest you have to be caught up
[57:25] amen hallelujah he's calling us into
[57:28] that
[57:29] hallelujah we're not just called to try
[57:31] and just get by a man we're not just
[57:34] called to just fear out the season or no
[57:37] we're cool to walk on the water
[57:39] we're called to dominion over all of it
[57:41] and all these trials and things that
[57:44] ghosts are in the church went through
[57:45] every church they wouldn't have fully
[57:47] understood why why are we just all dying
[57:50] but there was an anointing there to help
[57:52] them it was an anointing they were
[57:54] anointed to sacrifice they were anointed
[57:56] as martyrs they were anointed as smart
[57:59] men in the age of man but they finally
[58:02] came a time for the Eagles a man where a
[58:05] prophet would come with eagle vision to
[58:07] see a man to see beyond and bring on the
[58:11] full mind of Christ to the people so
[58:13] that you could see it so that you could
[58:15] realize who you are
[58:17] amen but you see all these trials and
[58:20] things they're all for a purpose because
[58:22] God was going to restore all things he
[58:25] was going to bring restitution he was
[58:27] going to restore the female image he was
[58:30] going to restore his perfect woman amen
[58:34] and through all of it and as a human
[58:38] would never understand hallelujah and
[58:41] God will never understand all the way
[58:44] that God understands it all the trials
[58:46] and everything that goes on in the
[58:47] church and all the things that's
[58:49] happened over the last 2,000 years
[58:50] that's because God is rebuilding a woman
[58:54] and you see all the trials that happen
[58:56] in your life you also go through seven
[58:59] church changes in your life
[59:00] there is also seven Church ages there's
[59:03] also a process that God takes you
[59:05] through he takes you through a time of
[59:07] full everything's just so amazing and
[59:10] there's power and glory and
[59:13] the prayers are always answered and and
[59:15] then the faith rises up and then he
[59:17] takes you through a time now of death he
[59:20] takes you through a time where you have
[59:21] to die to yourself and you start failing
[59:23] and things start going wrong all the
[59:25] time because these season he's bringing
[59:27] out something in you he's bringing out a
[59:29] nature in you because it says that he we
[59:32] would be conformed to the image of a son
[59:34] that we would be molded and shaped that
[59:36] every son that cometh to God must go
[59:39] through these things so consider it not
[59:41] strange that you go through the fiery
[59:43] trials hello Louie they're all for a
[59:46] reason you go through these things for a
[59:49] reason because these things inside you
[59:51] that need to come out and they will come
[59:53] out when they need to come out and God
[59:55] will bring them out he is the campaign
[59:57] manager a man he is leading the campaign
[1:00:00] he has got it all he's got the whole
[1:00:03] view we just sometimes need a punch the
[1:00:05] screen of our life right up to see if he
[1:00:08] lets you amen and prayer the Prophet
[1:00:11] said then you know there's times in
[1:00:14] prayer where you get a Holy Ghost
[1:00:15] lifting obviously what we need what we
[1:00:18] need is a Holy Ghost lifting up that's a
[1:00:21] personal experience with a God where he
[1:00:24] lifts you up out of this flesh and out
[1:00:26] of your thoughts and you start to see
[1:00:28] things in a bigger picture hallelujah he
[1:00:31] starts to show you and you and it's not
[1:00:34] so much as information coming at you
[1:00:36] it's just a perspective and you start to
[1:00:39] see there is a divine plan never ever
[1:00:42] ever give up never give up hallelujah
[1:00:46] there is a purpose why things happen

[1:08:21] the sea they were troubled and that's
[1:08:24] quite normal you know it was a bit
[1:08:26] different from what they were used to a
[1:08:27] man it was different from their
[1:08:29] denominational thinking from their
[1:08:30] Pharisaic thinking what they had been
[1:08:32] taught all their life in their churches
[1:08:33] what the School of Theology had taught

[1:09:30] you know even the elect can be a bit
[1:09:33] troubled at first hey it might be so
[1:09:35] different but yet something in their
[1:09:38] heart is saying yes I see it something

[1:14:11] and said unto Him o thou of little faith

[1:15:48] are we in the last days as their
[1:15:51] perilous times as the seas boisterous as
[1:15:54] the world going into complete chaos
[1:15:58] homosexuality and its rampant forms
[1:16:00] become a normal thing to the point where
[1:16:03] if you don't think that way you're weird
[1:16:06] so we're considered oddballs for men

[1:16:30] despisers of those that are good
[1:16:32] traitors heady highminded lovers of
[1:16:35] pleasures more than lovers of god having
[1:16:38] a form of godliness but denying the
[1:16:40] power thereof from such turn away
[1:16:47] revelation 10 verse 1 this is the this
[1:16:51] is now this is going to describe the our
[1:16:56] visitation of our God who has come
[1:17:00] himself because Jesus Christ was sent
[1:17:03] himself at the end to come and see him
[1:17:06] all the school to come and claim
[1:17:08] everything he purchased he would come
[1:17:10] Alleluia and I read that right at the
[1:17:13] start Ephesians 5 says that he might
[1:17:17] present her to himself God the
[1:17:20] all-knowing all-powerful would come down
[1:17:23] into time again and he would walk in
[1:17:27] time hallelujah
[1:17:30] spiritually no no not the physical body
[1:17:34] not the Corporal coming I'm talking
[1:17:36] about
[1:17:36] the fullness of Christ manifested amen
[1:17:39] and spiritual form in Word form and then
[1:17:43] in the form of the angel of the Lord and
[1:17:45] they're speaking through the mouth of a
[1:17:47] redeemed son through a prophet he says
[1:17:51] you see that's how visitation that's our
[1:17:54] inheritance that he is holding
[1:17:59] revelation 10 verse 1 and I saw another
[1:18:02] mighty angel come down from heaven
[1:18:04] clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was
[1:18:06] upon his head and his face was as it
[1:18:08] were the Sun and his feet as pillars of
[1:18:11] fire aren't you so glad that when all
[1:18:13] the smoke came out of hell all over the
[1:18:15] earth and it blocked out the Sun there
[1:18:17] was a provision made for you there's a
[1:18:19] provision made for you a space shining
[1:18:22] like the Sun and he says just come and
[1:18:24] behold my face he wants to have
[1:18:26] fellowship with you he wants to restore
[1:18:28] the song in your life give everything
[1:18:30] else give it up
[1:18:32] lay it all down and if you want joy lay
[1:18:34] it down if you want peace tonight lay it
[1:18:37] down lay all the things down that you
[1:18:39] know that you can lay down hallelujah
[1:18:42] don't get all caught up that you don't
[1:18:45] know oh I don't know what to lay down I
[1:18:47] don't know this just lay what you know
[1:18:48] what's in your conscious mind surrender
[1:18:52] it if you want peace if you want joy if
[1:18:55] you want rest if you want to be sure of
[1:18:58] God be certain of God do you lay
[1:19:00] everything down until he comes on the
[1:19:03] scene of your life and you know that
[1:19:06] you've gone beyond the veil Amen you've
[1:19:09] come into a place where the glories
[1:19:10] never fail and the word never goes fail
[1:19:13] Amen hallelujah and you start to see
[1:19:16] your life start to restore back like
[1:19:19] Aaron's rod when he went in when he
[1:19:22] started walking on the waters hallelujah
[1:19:25] sorry the rod doesn't walk on the water
[1:19:27] but I'm thinking of a person now walking
[1:19:31] on the waters the multitudes tongues and
[1:19:34] Nations and all those things you know
[1:19:36] waters and the Bible was multitude
[1:19:37] tongues and nations and just that we're
[1:19:39] the Catholic Church came out and we're
[1:19:41] the Gentile empires of all that stuff
[1:19:43] you just walk over all that stuff walk
[1:19:46] over the religions walk over all this
[1:19:48] theologies and walk over everything and
[1:19:51] you just go beyond the veil lay it all
[1:19:54] down hallelujah let that altar of
[1:19:57] incense it's just before the Holy of
[1:19:59] Holies let your whole life be poured on
[1:20:02] that
[1:20:03] did everything go let it all be poured
[1:20:07] on that and a supernatural God you will
[1:20:10] walk into his presence Amen because the
[1:20:12] vales rent there's nothing to stop you
[1:20:17] nothing the Devils by he's got no power
[1:20:21] he can't stop you walking and he can't
[1:20:23] stop you escaping the unescapable world
[1:20:27] he can't stop you because there is a God
[1:20:30] the God of heaven the one who knew that
[1:20:33] this perilous sea would come and it
[1:20:35] would be gross darkness and there'll be
[1:20:37] no light left in the churches no light
[1:20:39] lifting denominations no light anywhere
[1:20:41] but in Christ alone and he himself would
[1:20:46] have to come in the end time with his
[1:20:48] face shining like this so that all the
[1:20:50] light of every age and all the theology
[1:20:54] that was true it would all come together
[1:20:56] and it would be concentrated into a
[1:20:59] message and that message would be
[1:21:01] preached to you and you would catch that
[1:21:03] and you would recognize your day and you
[1:21:05] would see there is a God of heaven whose
[1:21:08] Bible days again and has he's come to
[1:21:11] walk on the water and cause you to come
[1:21:14] into a Holy of Holies amen and you would
[1:21:17] be no man no much more than a stick
[1:21:19] shaped by man when you started out
[1:21:20] hallelujah
[1:21:22] been fashioned by man's ideas used by
[1:21:25] men whatever has been going on in your
[1:21:27] life there's nothing when you hop into
[1:21:30] their Shekinah glory it doesn't have any
[1:21:33] effect anymore
[1:21:34] all of those prison chains kids are
[1:21:36] broken by the power of his blood and
[1:21:39] they were broken at Calvary all of it's
[1:21:41] broken you are absolutely free tonight
[1:21:43] free to walk into that place you made
[1:21:47] the old dry old stick that has no
[1:21:49] resemblance of a son or a daughter right
[1:21:51] now but you can't walk you can go beyond
[1:21:54] the veil tonight you can go beyond the
[1:21:57] veil right now
[1:21:58] hallelujah right now and all the joy
[1:22:01] that you've ever wanted all the nice
[1:22:03] piece that you've ever wanted will be
[1:22:05] yours all that security your identity
[1:22:10] everything that you really want all that
[1:22:15] you'll ever need
[1:22:16] as in there just lay everything down
[1:22:18] what does it worth to you what does it
[1:22:21] worth nothing the devil's lying he's a
[1:22:25] liar and he's the father of lies
[1:22:27] it's all a bluff oh my
[1:22:30] no matter water does matter how hard it
[1:22:34] is he's caught us to walk on the water
[1:22:36] amen we're just about finished and he
[1:22:42] cried with a loud voice oh no and he had
[1:22:45] in his hand a little book open and he
[1:22:49] said in his right foot upon the earth
[1:22:50] and his left foot upon a sea and a right
[1:22:52] left foot upon the earth and cried with
[1:22:54] a loud voice as when a lion roars and
[1:22:57] when he cried seven thunders uttered
[1:22:58] their voices amen and we know that
[1:23:00] that's the voice of God that comes from
[1:23:02] heaven and speaks down into the earth
[1:23:04] and what does it do it shakes the
[1:23:06] heavens and the earth so that all that's
[1:23:08] shakable anything that's temporal in
[1:23:11] your life let it fall let it crumble let
[1:23:17] it fall away the voice is here it's here
[1:23:20] to crumble all those things away so you
[1:23:22] can walk into the Holy of Holies they
[1:23:24] may let their voice just recognize it

[1:23:30] me hear beyond the veil
[1:23:32] let me hear their voice that speaks
[1:23:34] behind the voice let me hear that
[1:23:37] because I want supernatural I want the
[1:23:40] vision in my life I want what the
[1:23:43] preachers talking about hallelujah
[1:23:46] that's all that you need and it's so
[1:23:49] simple it's not some complicated thing
[1:23:51] it's not too far away from you it's
[1:23:53] yours now take it walk into it amen and
[1:23:58] you see that rod then you think that you
[1:24:01] are that may be shaped up like a dry old
[1:24:04] stick that's been hid around or become a
[1:24:07] fruitful tree will turn back to its
[1:24:10] original form it will be root will
[1:24:13] receive restitution it will be
[1:24:15] reconstituted amen because God has sent
[1:24:19] Jesus Christ amen and the time of
[1:24:23] refreshing of all things that is
[1:24:27] everything that Adam loves all the
[1:24:29] inheritance
[1:24:30] I just rebuilt the true man and rebuilt
[1:24:32] the true woman so that they can sing a
[1:24:34] song hallelujah like deeper in Bharat
[1:24:37] they sung a song they had a victory amen
[1:24:41] like in the time of the book of
[1:24:42] Revelation we made the lamb opened at
[1:24:45] all and they just rejoiced John had the
[1:24:48] whole heaven in the whole earth and
[1:24:49] under the earth listening to the
[1:24:51] testimony that he overcame a man our God
[1:24:56] has overcome hallelujah I'll share a
[1:25:00] couple of testimonies I was up in
[1:25:03] Taranaki and you know I'm I run most of
[1:25:08] you know my past and it's not pretty
[1:25:09] so there's a lot of things that the Lord
[1:25:11] has to do in my life you know that he's
[1:25:13] been doing and is still doing - and the
[1:25:16] I'm talking subtle things that you
[1:25:18] wouldn't know until he shows you subtle
[1:25:20] things and these subtle things start to
[1:25:23] come out and then I start failing in
[1:25:26] certain areas and you know it shows
[1:25:28] itself and I pray O God and I get down
[1:25:31] and I say Lord what's going on what's
[1:25:33] happening how does this happen and where
[1:25:36] is its root closed where is it found
[1:25:39] Lord and in His mercy and his love
[1:25:42] because I am in the Shekinah because I'm
[1:25:46] in the I just you know you when you're
[1:25:48] in there
[1:25:49] he's the healer hallelujah he's the
[1:25:52] deliverer
[1:25:53] hallelujah it's not it's just a process
[1:25:56] that he takes you through and I said
[1:25:59] Lord what is this and then then I start
[1:26:03] failing more in a certain area and and I
[1:26:08] knew it's this thing this complex or
[1:26:10] this this deep like it's like a wound of
[1:26:14] some sort and so I'm up at Taranaki now
[1:26:17] and brother Craig is preaching and then
[1:26:19] after the service there's a prayer and
[1:26:20] every time a preacher calls all these
[1:26:23] people come in for prayer always search
[1:26:25] my life and I always say Lord is there
[1:26:27] anything in me that you want me to go
[1:26:29] pray for
[1:26:29] is there anything and I just wait on the
[1:26:31] Lord and if he says go I'll go and that
[1:26:34] then sometimes he says go and I still
[1:26:35] don't want to go and I'm like oh man I
[1:26:37] just I don't know that's just a battle
[1:26:39] anyway so I'm down the back of the
[1:26:42] church and I'm suddenly
[1:26:44] and I'm saying Lord what is this thing
[1:26:47] what is it and I said Lord if you tell
[1:26:51] me what this problem is where its root
[1:26:53] causes I will God for prayer and anyway
[1:26:58] I'm like praying and there's people
[1:26:59] going up for prayer and and then he just
[1:27:01] says fear of rejection Wow okay well
[1:27:07] here I am I'm going up and then I think
[1:27:11] I can't remember exactly but I kind of
[1:27:12] put her off again and then something
[1:27:14] else happened and then I went up I went
[1:27:16] out right at the end and He healed me
[1:27:18] hey man hallelujah because he's calling
[1:27:22] us to walk on water and any little thing
[1:27:25] that hinders that channel hinders that
[1:27:27] faith or hinders that expression of him
[1:27:29] he will deliver he will move he will
[1:27:32] take it all apart he will remove it so
[1:27:35] that you can be restored amen you know
[1:27:40] we have a supernatural God that's
[1:27:41] calling us to walk on water amen
[1:27:43] hallelujah I told you guys the story of
[1:27:45] Rebecca and the rain even the little
[1:27:47] ones wherever she is they're catching it
[1:27:50] they've got faith because God is calling
[1:27:53] us all to walk on the water
[1:27:54] he's calling our children Alleluia what
[1:27:57] are you teaching them hallelujah you
[1:28:00] know these things are so real and the
[1:28:02] children are catching it so Rebecca
[1:28:04] prays and you know there's forecast
[1:28:06] storms and rain Thanksgiving we've got a
[1:28:08] lot to be thankful for amen
[1:28:10] because God is restoring the spoken word
[1:28:12] back into his people hallelujah and so
[1:28:15] Rebecca prays and it starting this and
[1:28:17] it becomes sunny for three days for five
[1:28:19] days I don't know it was sunny for a
[1:28:21] long time and we played out and we've
[1:28:22] done all the things amen you see because
[1:28:24] she sees the next day man the Lord the
[1:28:29] whole city is benefiting from my prayer
[1:28:31] because we pray I prayed and God took
[1:28:33] away all the rain and now the whole
[1:28:35] region is all red all happy because I
[1:28:37] prayed and I said praise the Lord amen
[1:28:40] even the children are catching it even
[1:28:42] the children are walking on the water
[1:28:44] amen Alleluia amen
[1:28:47] just today is another testimony a really
[1:28:50] cool testimony so Rebecca got bitten by
[1:28:54] a whitetail spider must have been a
[1:28:56] pretty big one
[1:28:57] and she had the two holes in her leg she
[1:29:00] didn't feel a thing
[1:29:01] so brahmand prayed just said that
[1:29:04] there'll be no poison and there was
[1:29:05] nothing
[1:29:06] so no poison but it was a differently a
[1:29:08] whitetail spider and bigger didn't even
[1:29:10] no problem didn't even tell Ruby her at
[1:29:12] all and then so we I'm sitting out
[1:29:14] preparing on my dick and beaker comes
[1:29:18] out sits on my knee and she starts
[1:29:19] telling me about brother Branham she has
[1:29:21] a story about a whitetail spider and a
[1:29:23] bite and how he prayed and the poison
[1:29:25] was reversed and she's telling me if a
[1:29:28] some Brahmin walks out at the same time
[1:29:29] it says what did you just say
[1:29:31] and so biggest telling me the story of a
[1:29:33] whitetail spider doesn't even know she's
[1:29:35] been bitten by one brahmin knew she
[1:29:37] walks and she goes Rebecca that's
[1:29:38] significant that's very significant

[1:31:29] tired prayer that we kind of thought we
[1:31:30] may fall asleep in and it ended up
[1:31:33] turning into hours of rejoicing and
[1:31:34] singing and and and a friend of ours you
[1:31:38] know like there was words spoken in the
[1:31:42] spirit of one of the sisters getting
[1:31:44] healed of a real big issue and so you
[1:31:48] see when God comes everything changes

[1:31:59] happening in our lives

[1:32:12] came down on those words the blood still
[1:32:14] Christ freedom remember that who
[1:32:16] remembers that the blood still Christ
[1:32:17] freedom in it just there was healings
[1:32:19] taking place deep feelings because God's
[1:32:22] calling us to walk on the water he's
[1:32:24] calling us above all these things and
[1:32:26] all all he requires as your alabaster
[1:32:31] box your life can I have the musicians
[1:32:39] please
[1:32:56] Hosea 6 5 therefore have I hewed then by
[1:32:58] the prophets I have slain them by the
[1:33:01] words of my mouth and though judgments
[1:33:04] are as the light that goth forth
[1:33:06] revelation 10 7 were just I'm just
[1:33:09] speaking how this how the Lord expresses
[1:33:11] himself how he's calling you out of the
[1:33:14] ship this is how he does it but in the
[1:33:16] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[1:33:18] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[1:33:21] of God should be finished what I've
[1:33:24] spoken to you of now all the love and
[1:33:27] the relationship the union the union all
[1:33:34] of those things
[1:33:35] these were mysteries that were hidden in
[1:33:38] the scriptures they've only been
[1:33:39] revealed as Christ the mystery of God
[1:33:41] has been revealed in this hour how did
[1:33:44] he do it through the mouth of mouthpiece
[1:33:46] of God a major prophet one of the
[1:33:49] greatest ministries to ever strike the
[1:33:51] earth ever strike the earth Jesus did
[1:33:54] more miracles in his ministry and and
[1:33:56] and Jesus manifested more miracles in
[1:33:59] this endtime ministry than he did in his
[1:34:01] own ministry the greatest ministry to
[1:34:05] ever hit the earth but the greatest
[1:34:07] miracles ever recorded under any
[1:34:09] circumstance of equal nature to pour are
[1:34:12] to Joshua's stopping the eternities
[1:34:15] stopping the heavens and stopping the
[1:34:17] Moon in the Sun great things have taken
[1:34:21] place the Lord says shall a trumpet be
[1:34:23] blown in the city and the people not be
[1:34:25] afraid shall there be evil in a city and
[1:34:27] the Lord had not done it surely the Lord

[1:34:34] secret unto his servants the prophets
