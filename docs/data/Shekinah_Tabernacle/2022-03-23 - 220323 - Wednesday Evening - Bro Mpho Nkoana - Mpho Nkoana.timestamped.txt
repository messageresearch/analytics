[25:59] we are going to read
[26:02] Malachi
[26:04] is that the one
[26:06] chapter three
[26:08] verse 6.
[26:11] Malachi chapter 3
[26:13] verse 6. tonight is a prayer meeting
[26:16] so I like how brother Ed puts it
[26:19] it will just be a seminate
[26:21] tonight I'll try to make it a Sim on it
[26:24] because I didn't prepare
[26:27] a lot but it's all going to depend on
[26:29] the Lord
[26:30] how he directs you and me let's read
[26:34] that scripture
[26:35] so that we can see that
[26:37] for I am the Lord
[26:39] I change not
[26:42] therefore ye sons of Jacobs
[26:44] are not consumed
[26:47] the key the key sentence or verse that I
[26:50] would like us to focus on there is the
[26:52] one that says I change not
[26:56] for I am the Lord your God I change not
[27:00] right and the subject
[27:02] let's enjoy the comfort of our seat
[27:05] please sorry
[27:06] don't want to be like brother Dave
[27:08] okay and he forgot to tell people to sit
[27:12] down because it's not an easy thing to
[27:15] stand before the Believers and speak
[27:16] about things that can put you in big
[27:19] trouble to stand before people and talk
[27:21] you've got to be able to be sure that
[27:24] you put yourself away in a fight and not
[27:28] bring preconceived ideas and just speak
[27:31] the word and be available and then
[27:33] you'll be available I am available then
[27:37] the Lord will do the rest of the work
[27:38] amen are you coming without any
[27:40] preconceived so am I tonight Hallelujah
[27:44] so tonight we are going to speak about a
[27:46] little not little but we'll speak about
[27:48] this subject
[27:50] and changing God
[27:52] but now this unchanging God we want to
[27:54] look at him from the ankle of him
[27:57] changing my life
[27:59] into a into his divine nature
[28:03] remember God does not change we read it
[28:05] we read that God is an unchanging God
[28:09] many things change I don't know about
[28:11] you but for me sister Deb I don't want
[28:14] to depend on something that changes
[28:17] I don't know much about you but can you
[28:19] can you really depend on something that
[28:22] changes
[28:24] I I don't want to depend on or to rely
[28:27] on something that changes because
[28:28] something that changes tomorrow it will
[28:31] change sorry I'll be sipping sipping
[28:34] this medicine
[28:36] this is hot water
[28:38] lemon
[28:39] and and a baptism of honey
[28:43] I found two lovely sisters there in the
[28:45] kitchen by Sister Joe
[28:48] and they made me this concoction I just
[28:50] found them at the right time and they
[28:52] were my two nurses
[28:54] and I'm not sick I just happened to get
[28:57] some allergy and then I reacted so my
[28:59] chest is a bit misbehaving playing up so
[29:03] the Two Sisters God bless you Sister
[29:04] person line sister
[29:06] Jenny they made it they stopped
[29:07] everything they were doing
[29:09] to to look after me
[29:12] so please don't mind I hope you don't
[29:14] mind it I'll be sipping this water
[29:16] instead of brother Cuban's one but
[29:19] thanks brother and God bless you my
[29:20] precious brother right let's come back
[29:23] this God who does not change
[29:26] is something or is someone that we must
[29:30] depend upon
[29:31] why because he's an unchanging God
[29:35] the prophet says okay let's let before
[29:37] we go to the prophet let's go to uh yeah
[29:41] let's go to Second Peter
[29:45] let's go to Second Peter chapter one
[29:47] it's a bit long and today we may not
[29:50] have time to go around I know I owe the
[29:52] children I owe you I know
[29:54] but we will do it some other time eh and
[29:57] and give you a chance to read but
[29:59] tonight let's just read it to save time
[30:01] so that we can just be together and just
[30:03] enjoy this sermon it's a very long
[30:06] sermon but the prophet took so long
[30:08] preaching that message I took it from
[30:11] the stage of the perfect man
[30:13] and also the one of the unchangeable God
[30:16] those two sermons if you read them they
[30:17] are very long and it's a study the other
[30:19] one the stage of a perfect man I wanted
[30:21] to talk about the stature of a perfect
[30:24] God
[30:26] and for us to see because that's what
[30:29] was what we want to be actually he wants
[30:32] to make a stage of a perfect man in us
[30:34] because he's he's got a Stager
[30:37] he's a perfect God he's got a certain
[30:39] stage and he wants to bring us so that's
[30:41] what I wanted to talk about so we'll
[30:43] we'll touch a bit more into it into it
[30:45] tonight and let's read that second Peter
[30:47] who can see it second Peter
[30:49] Simon Peter VII
[30:52] and an apostle of Jesus Christ
[30:54] to them that have obtained like Precious
[30:57] Faith with us through righteous
[31:00] righteousness of God and our Savior
[31:02] Jesus Christ I just underline to them
[31:05] who who's them
[31:07] is you and me
[31:10] writing to you and me this gospel this
[31:14] chapter is writing to you listen to to
[31:16] what he's saying to to them who have
[31:19] obtained do you know what is to obtain
[31:22] to obtain is to get when I say you you
[31:25] have obtained a good report or you have
[31:28] obtained the ownership of this mic it
[31:31] means that this mic belongs to you you
[31:34] you got the full ownership and
[31:36] unconditional you have obtained the
[31:39] permission to own this mic from the
[31:42] Sounders they gave it to you you have
[31:45] obtained a payment no one will take it
[31:46] from you
[31:47] because you have obtained their
[31:49] ownership we can use it you can borrow
[31:51] us you can do what you want but when you
[31:54] come and take your mic
[31:56] it's yours because you got the ownership
[32:00] you have obtained the payment the
[32:02] ownership of it is yours so what is
[32:04] saying that to them that have obtained
[32:07] like Precious faith
[32:10] you have already obtained it
[32:12] you with us through the righteousness of
[32:16] God and our Savior Jesus Christ Grace
[32:19] and peace be multiplied unto you through
[32:21] the knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ
[32:23] Our Lord according to his divine power
[32:25] everything about him about him is divine
[32:30] his divine power have given
[32:34] the divine power have given unto us all
[32:38] things
[32:40] all
[32:42] a-l-l
[32:45] amen all he has given who
[32:49] let's be together talk to me he has
[32:52] given us me and you he has given us
[32:55] right what did he give us
[32:58] all things
[33:01] that pertaineth unto life
[33:04] and godliness
[33:08] man this is deep
[33:11] through the knowledge
[33:14] through the knowledge right
[33:17] sorry I should be reading from the Bible
[33:19] my slide I know it misbehaves
[33:22] okay I've got it underlined
[33:25] according to his divine power
[33:28] had given unto us all
[33:30] that pertain unto life and godliness
[33:33] through the knowledge of him that hath
[33:36] called us unto glory and virtue right
[33:40] to us he has given us all
[33:44] pertaining life and just just absorb it
[33:47] well the prophet when he reads this
[33:49] spoken word I mean this this he says let
[33:52] me pause here I want it to soak in real
[33:55] deep
[33:57] I want you to hear it well the meaning
[34:00] of this is something that you must
[34:02] understand and hear what it means it
[34:05] must so you know when you soak something
[34:08] on my on my washing machine there's a
[34:10] button you press there and it says soak
[34:14] if you press that one you must know
[34:16] you're going to wait three hours
[34:19] the moment you press that because the
[34:21] machine is going to soak that thing that
[34:23] you are washing and it's gonna wash it
[34:25] thoroughly
[34:26] so so I understand this verse to soak in
[34:30] what he say that he has given you all
[34:33] all you have been given
[34:39] Hallelujah
[34:41] now let's jump quickly to verse 4.
[34:44] whereby I give an unto us
[34:48] exceeding great
[34:51] and precious promises
[34:54] that by this
[34:55] listen to this that by this
[34:58] by this you must be partakers of the
[35:03] divine nature
[35:06] so this is heavy brothers and sisters
[35:08] this is not light this is not like when
[35:11] I say hey Andy let me take you out for
[35:13] let's go buy beggars
[35:15] this is not that this is deep
[35:18] it means you are Kings and Queens
[35:21] have you ever seen a king a king and a
[35:23] queen who hasn't realized or don't don't
[35:26] have the revelation of who they are
[35:29] they'll misuse that
[35:32] will use it in a wrong way sister known
[35:35] because they haven't received they
[35:37] haven't they are kings and queens yes
[35:39] they are born
[35:41] and they've got a title but they haven't
[35:43] realized who they are then they live
[35:45] regularly
[35:47] they do as as
[35:49] as no King will behave they behave that
[35:52] way because the heaven so you have been
[35:55] given that to be partakers a partaker is
[35:59] someone who is a participant someone who
[36:01] is part of
[36:03] of what particles of what of the divine
[36:07] nature of God remember we are we here on
[36:10] this Earth we are born in a different
[36:12] nature I forgot to to greet the people
[36:15] in video land that may the Lord bless
[36:17] them and the Holy Spirit just speak to
[36:19] them also
[36:21] and that you might be partakers of the
[36:24] divine nature having the the divine
[36:27] nature of who
[36:29] of God
[36:30] that you can be part that Divine Nation
[36:32] your nature can change and you have a
[36:34] divine nature of God we are getting
[36:36] somewhere you'll see where I'm getting
[36:38] having escaped the corruption that is in
[36:43] the world not having preparing to escape
[36:47] not going to escape having escaped
[36:50] already
[36:52] so it sounds to me Oppa that everything
[36:56] it sounds like is a done dealer
[37:00] it sounds to me that whatever happens
[37:03] doesn't matter whatever the devil can
[37:05] try to do
[37:07] is not an issue anymore because I am
[37:10] already given a a a some approval to be
[37:14] an old I've already obtained I have
[37:17] already a partaker I have already been
[37:19] given heavy I've already escaped
[37:22] you'll see as we go along
[37:25] and beside this giving all now now
[37:28] listen to this now
[37:30] we have escaped the corruption that this
[37:32] world that in this world through lust
[37:36] you see the corruption of this world
[37:37] it's got its own lustful spirits and an
[37:41] enticing Spirits they are there whoever
[37:43] you have already escaped them don't
[37:46] listen to the devil accusing you and
[37:48] blaming you have already
[37:51] escaped so don't take you know I hear
[37:54] people saying I don't take a no for an
[37:56] answer
[37:57] you know that statement brother
[37:59] When someone tells you I don't take a no
[38:05] so so what answer must I give you now if
[38:08] if the true answer is no what what must
[38:10] I tell you
[38:11] because the answer is no what am I I
[38:13] take no for an answer that's what my
[38:16] wife does with the boys
[38:19] she wants an answer but but I mean she's
[38:21] giving them an answer but only one
[38:23] answer
[38:27] so if you hear someone asking you sister
[38:30] and I say telling you something and
[38:32] telling you something and say oh am I
[38:34] right or am I right
[38:36] what do you say
[38:39] you say yes you are right isn't it
[38:41] because because he's not giving you any
[38:44] option am I right or am I right
[38:46] you are right right so so here that the
[38:50] devil must not intimidate you I want to
[38:53] awaken you to know that you are
[38:55] partakers of the divine nature and it's
[38:58] not something that you have done it's
[39:00] not something that you have qualified
[39:01] it's not something that we can credit to
[39:04] you
[39:05] is something that you must know and have
[39:08] a true revelation of his of of what is
[39:10] it then everything is behind you yes
[39:13] things will happen in your life but you
[39:16] are already a partaker of the divine
[39:19] nature of God
[39:25] and verse 5 it says and beside this
[39:27] giving all diligence now these are the
[39:30] vishus these vesus is a long sermon
[39:33] if we can start off the stage of a
[39:35] perfectness but you know them
[39:38] it says beside this giving all diligence
[39:41] add to your faith virtue and to your
[39:43] virtue knowledge and to your knowledge
[39:45] Temperance and to Temperance patience
[39:47] and to patience godliness and to
[39:49] godiness brotherly kindness and to
[39:52] brotherly kindness charity which is love
[39:54] this is a sermon but
[39:57] but package alone just this verse is a
[39:59] full two-hour sermon alone
[40:02] we will talk about this some other time
[40:04] or we'll pass it through the end to
[40:05] preach it this one is a powerful sermon
[40:09] about the stage of a perfect man but I
[40:12] want to show you something
[40:14] for for if these things be in you
[40:18] that we have just read now
[40:20] if they be in you and abound
[40:24] they make you that he shall neither be
[40:29] barren
[40:30] no unfruitful in the knowledge of the
[40:33] Lord Jesus Christ
[40:34] do you know when we say someone is
[40:36] barren
[40:38] if if a tree is Barren which means Tiana
[40:41] it cannot give us fruits
[40:44] that sea can't give us fruits my girl
[40:46] it's like that one that the Lord cursed
[40:49] he didn't have truth what's the use of
[40:51] it see if he's not giving giving us any
[40:53] fruits we must cut it we are feeding it
[40:55] with manure we is taking space in our
[40:58] yard wind tight brings their leaves and
[41:00] everything but no fruits
[41:02] why why do we have that kind of a fruit
[41:04] and we call it it's a palm tree
[41:07] this is a plum tree you must prune it in
[41:10] Spring Water it it looks beautiful
[41:14] but fruits no fruits
[41:17] where's the fruits
[41:20] the Lord's cursed it
[41:22] if you find that there's a little type
[41:24] of a branch in your life that doesn't
[41:26] want to bring fruits what must you do to
[41:29] it
[41:30] pruning
[41:32] not cut it too deep too too
[41:35] help yourself just prune it
[41:37] to the devil it goes to the fire
[41:40] springtime
[41:42] then you will see fruits and flowers
[41:44] will come ah time for pruning
[41:48] that's where we are now
[41:49] so
[41:51] if you have this virtues that I've read
[41:54] you will neither be Barren you'll be
[41:56] fruitful
[41:58] you will never be Barren nor unfaithful
[42:01] right
[42:03] unfruitful sorry with the knowledge of
[42:06] our Lord Jesus Christ but but listen to
[42:08] this man but he that lacketh these
[42:10] things
[42:13] this is very serious he that lucky these
[42:16] things
[42:17] blind
[42:18] and cannot see a far off
[42:22] do you know Isaac
[42:27] and the Bible says he he saw her from
[42:31] afar or as he was walking in going to
[42:34] meet her Elias I was bringing him and he
[42:37] saw them afar off
[42:40] so if you don't have these things you
[42:42] can't see your Isaac you can't see no
[42:44] you you only see here
[42:46] you think you can see far the devil
[42:48] deceives you that you can see far
[42:50] because of these eyes but you do not see
[42:52] Alpha not seeing a far off it means not
[42:55] seeing Beyond this flesh
[42:58] amen are we together
[43:00] tonight I'm not I'm trying not to preach
[43:02] just to go slow and teach and then we
[43:06] will finish
[43:07] I promise you
[43:10] we want to see Alpha off isn't it Josh
[43:13] we want to be able to see beyond
[43:16] the so-called enemy the so-called bully
[43:19] we want to see beyond the so-called
[43:21] economy of this world we want to see
[43:24] beyond
[43:25] are far off if you can only see this
[43:28] world up to this world
[43:31] then
[43:33] your your
[43:34] what do you call it your daily limit is
[43:37] too too small
[43:38] it must be increased do you know a daily
[43:40] limit
[43:41] how many of you know a daily limit
[43:46] sorry
[43:49] excuse me
[43:52] a daily limit and a monthly limit
[43:55] you children who don't know because I
[43:57] know if any is going to ask me
[44:00] is when you've got a bank card
[44:03] and you've got money in there the bank
[44:06] keeps your money they give you a limit
[44:08] of how much you can use or withdraw a
[44:11] day in a month your money
[44:14] imagine
[44:15] your money
[44:18] and a monthly and a daily limit
[44:21] so a child of God you you've got a card
[44:24] that has got no daily limit
[44:28] your check
[44:29] is already signed yes
[44:32] stamped
[44:34] it's only for you to write an amount
[44:38] I like that you might imagine if you
[44:40] find a husband like that
[44:42] and it is our husband we found him
[44:45] we found him we found a husband who says
[44:48] honey
[44:49] man I love I love this husband
[44:51] he says hey
[44:54] and he looks at you how are you today
[44:57] you say fine
[44:59] are you sure
[45:04] the check is already prepared it's not
[45:06] taken from the checkbook and still right
[45:08] no no he was thinking about you all the
[45:11] cross of Calvary was busy thinking about
[45:13] you suffering has been writing a check
[45:15] for you
[45:16] writing it and suffering anyway they
[45:19] were doing all sorts of things I can see
[45:21] him they take him along the Villa De la
[45:23] Rosa Road they take him there and he's
[45:25] pulling that he was thinking about
[45:29] and then busy writing a check huh and he
[45:33] came down he came down and brother
[45:35] Brendan brought him and told him about
[45:37] me this Isaac and then when he meet me
[45:40] thank you
[45:43] it gives you the check is that a 10
[45:46] to you my love the Bride of the Lord
[45:48] Jesus Christ
[45:50] to you there's a place there on the
[45:53] check is called some
[45:55] they
[45:56] said it's not one line
[45:58] it's two lies you know why it's two
[45:59] lines
[46:02] heaps of money
[46:04] so that line is the only line on the
[46:06] checkbook those who knows what the
[46:07] checkbook is that has got two lines or
[46:09] three maybe
[46:11] because there's people who are
[46:12] trillionaires
[46:14] there's people I've learned this week
[46:17] that that they say there's a a million
[46:20] that that is called what what did we
[46:22] call it
[46:23] reptilian
[46:25] huh
[46:26] what was it
[46:27] huh
[46:29] just speak louder
[46:32] you are more than sectillions you the
[46:35] more than sectillionaires the economy of
[46:37] this world the GDP of the entire world
[46:39] the economy of the entire world is not
[46:42] more than 3 trillion
[46:44] the GDP of all countries rich and poor
[46:49] together
[46:50] is not more than 5 trillion US dollars
[46:53] is less than that now you are that
[46:57] trillion
[47:00] until they just say is
[47:03] that what
[47:06] that one
[47:09] greatly gladly
[47:11] but the number is so huge you can't
[47:13] count heaven and finish it
[47:16] that's what we
[47:17] you are not counted even according to
[47:20] the value of this world
[47:22] yo the moment you think about your you
[47:25] the bride
[47:27] and you associate you with the economy
[47:29] of this world that's too cheap
[47:32] it's too cheap to compare yourself and
[47:35] what you are worth with the economy of
[47:37] this world but yet you live here and yet
[47:40] the world does not know who the Arabian
[47:43] shoulders with
[47:44] ah this is not to make you proud I'm
[47:47] just trying to conscientize you to
[47:49] realize who you
[47:51] that your economy there's no expression
[47:54] to write it
[47:56] and what you are worth
[47:58] tonight that is why it's important for
[48:01] me and for you to know who we are and to
[48:03] understand the contents of this book
[48:06] and the mean and what it means to me and
[48:10] to you and why God speak the way he
[48:13] speaks to us
[48:15] nothing will ever disturb us but I want
[48:17] us to to understand that if we don't
[48:20] have those things if we lack the Bible
[48:22] does not even say if you don't have them
[48:24] it says if you lack
[48:27] but he that lacks
[48:30] because there's people who has these
[48:32] things but they don't know God there's
[48:34] people who are who are knowledgeable man
[48:37] they know Theology and about God the
[48:40] mother even the Devil Himself he knows
[48:42] the scriptures so powerfully AMA the
[48:45] devil
[48:45] imagine devil no scriptures more than a
[48:48] Believer so there's people who are so
[48:51] humble
[48:53] so nice people you think you can just
[48:55] take them and just plug them in heaven
[48:58] they are so nice people
[49:00] but but but but but they are not these
[49:03] ones that God is talking about
[49:04] so why me
[49:07] do you realize now who you actually are
[49:09] do you realize what you are worth
[49:12] huh so now let's look at it like this
[49:15] now
[49:16] wherefore
[49:18] okay let me read that verse again but he
[49:20] that like these things is blind and
[49:22] cannot see afar off and had forgotten
[49:25] that he was passed from his old sins who
[49:29] don't want to forget Lord
[49:30] we really don't want to forget we are
[49:32] still reading Peter
[49:33] we are finishing it now
[49:35] wherefore
[49:37] the Radha Brethren give diligence to
[49:40] make your calling an election
[49:44] to make your calling and your election
[49:48] what make sure every day when you wake
[49:51] up one of your main missions is to be
[49:53] make your election sure
[49:55] to make sure that Lord today I want to
[49:57] get closer to you
[49:59] thank you Lord then the rest of the
[50:00] other programs can come afterwards but
[50:02] every day Lord make me to be aware of
[50:05] who I am today every day
[50:09] right let's leave Peter let's jump to
[50:11] this prayer that blessed me so much that
[50:13] brother Brandon prayed he said just a
[50:16] moment for prayer
[50:18] our heavenly father it is a grain a
[50:20] grand privilege listen to listen to the
[50:23] attitude of the Prophet praying to God
[50:26] he says
[50:27] our heavenly father it is a grand you
[50:30] know something that is Grand where we
[50:32] come there in our country even though I
[50:34] always give examples about South Africa
[50:39] when a young man gives another one says

[50:43] how's it say a grand
[50:45] you responded Grand meaning shop
[50:49] meaning cool I'm all right grand grand
[50:52] it means that

[50:57] this he says
[50:59] it is a grand privilege
[51:02] that we have we that we have took what
[51:06] the prophet speaks English here that we
[51:08] have to coming into
[51:10] presence into presence in this attitude

[51:23] privilege for us to be in your presence
[51:25] Lord

[51:29] and into your presence and in this
[51:32] attitude of worship
[51:35] and praise and and and know that we can
[51:39] call thee our father just the knowledge
[51:42] of knowing that we can call you our
[51:44] father you will see why I'm reading this
[51:45] prayer right you will see it just now
[51:48] and being being Bond of thy spirit
[51:53] we are thy children he's addressing God
[51:57] and with the privilege of asking that we
[52:00] will
[52:01] a privilege of asking anything that you
[52:04] will
[52:06] and
[52:07] and faith will bring it to pass
[52:11] we thank thee for this
[52:13] he's telling God we thank thee this man
[52:16] is addressing God Almighty the creator
[52:20] of heaven and earth when you address a
[52:22] king you don't just talk
[52:24] you talk with hearing yourself what you
[52:28] are saying
[52:29] when we pray we shouldn't be hasty hasty
[52:34] we shouldn't
[52:36] we must address God
[52:38] because we are addressing a king
[52:42] when you when you go to right now
[52:44] they take you there too
[52:46] let's let's leave England for today
[52:49] and they take you there too
[52:52] which countries are the key
[52:57] or let's say they take you to United
[53:00] Arab Emirates one of the Army is the
[53:03] Emirates and you go to the Sheikh the
[53:05] king of Dubai
[53:07] they say you are going to meet him or
[53:09] you go to Spain Spain there's Kings
[53:12] and you go there and you are meeting a
[53:14] king royalty
[53:16] they even train you how you're going to
[53:19] talk
[53:20] they tell you what you're going to say
[53:23] how you're going how you're going to
[53:25] walk and when the king passes what you
[53:28] are going to do
[53:29] right and and recite must you be and we
[53:32] said your wife must be sister brother
[53:34] they train you and because they say it's
[53:37] a privilege
[53:38] go and meet have a have a privilege of
[53:42] sitting with the King if you go to
[53:44] Nigeria there's Kings there is Kings
[53:47] when you go to the king you don't just
[53:49] go by yourself and walk no no there are
[53:52] processes and and the people who must go
[53:55] in there for you
[53:57] in our culture with this there's
[54:00] different levels of seniority protocol
[54:02] hey but our King has given us no
[54:05] protocol except his weight you and me
[54:08] can have full access
[54:10] to go and meet him and be addressed by
[54:13] the key
[54:14] so how should we be addressing him in
[54:17] our private space in our family prayer
[54:19] in our devotion prayer in our whatever
[54:22] our daily way of living how should we be
[54:25] addressing him we should be doing things
[54:27] that brings honor to the king
[54:30] are we together because he's the king
[54:33] that's why the prophet is addressing him
[54:34] like this he said most holy and
[54:36] righteous God
[54:40] we would ask tonight that you'd you'd
[54:42] speak to those Lord who are needy
[54:45] those that need salvation of their souls
[54:48] and for those that are sick in in a
[54:52] disparate conditions to the shut-ins
[54:55] Lord the shut-ins those are you know
[54:57] those that are in the hospitals and are

[55:04] the meeting oh thou great I am it's like
[55:07] a poem
[55:08] it's like he's giving it's like he's
[55:12] enjoying to talk to address the king
[55:14] he's telling God who he is do you think
[55:16] God can answer him
[55:19] in the middle of the of the other places
[55:21] he said oh thou Great I Am
[55:25] I just love this kind of a prayer and
[55:28] go to their bed size tonight and touch
[55:31] their sick bodies that they might be
[55:33] able to come from the hospitals to

[56:08] this
[56:09] the Lord immediately says Gabriel
[56:12] don't worry
[56:14] don't worry Gabriel
[56:15] I
[56:17] I'm going to personally answer imagine
[56:20] after you go in that royalty
[56:23] many of us let's say Shekinah have gone
[56:25] to meet King Charles
[56:28] or let's say King Charles has come to
[56:30] visit us here
[56:31] I can tell you
[56:32] if King Charles come here
[56:35] I don't know about you but I know what
[56:37] is the person that will do
[56:38] [Laughter]
[56:41] sorry sorry Mama
[56:43] but what I'm trying to say if King
[56:46] Charles can come here
[56:48] they say
[56:50] one brother Ben and brother Pedro comes
[56:52] back
[56:53] on the 25th of April
[56:56] is announced and the past and the
[56:58] deacons come and stand here and they
[57:00] announced that we are having a visit of
[57:02] King King Charles will be in New Zealand
[57:04] and on the Sunday morning he'll be
[57:06] coming to Shekinah Tabernacle
[57:09] my brother

[57:18] don't know which one which shoes my wife
[57:20] will buy me
[57:22] I don't know what dresses the sisters
[57:25] will go and buy
[57:27] and I don't know how to send the sound
[57:29] desk will look
[57:31] If Prince not Prince King Charles a man
[57:36] who is going to die
[57:38] who does not even know when he's going
[57:40] to die
[57:41] I don't know what Bella will look like
[57:42] what dress I don't
[57:44] but I can only imagine
[57:47] that it will be
[57:49] fantastic
[57:51] we can we will even change the entrance
[57:55] I don't know how to tell you but if the
[57:57] kid comes here the king from this Earth
[58:01] now
[58:03] if the king says to Gabriel Gabriel
[58:05] all the Angels wait my son my daughter
[58:08] is addressing me wait
[58:12] I'm going to meet her tonight at her
[58:14] house I'm going to go there personally
[58:15] and I'll make sure that she dreams about
[58:18] me that she's healed that she's
[58:21] protected that she's comforted as
[58:24] brother Isaac was telling me ah that
[58:26] she's healed and I reassure my daughter
[58:29] how will you feel about that
[58:34] his mind blowing hey
[58:36] yeah it's mind-blowing that the mind can
[58:37] contain it
[58:39] so I was just so blessed by this kind of
[58:41] a prayer I wanted to put it at the
[58:43] beginning after I read this but I said
[58:45] let me make it part of the same one and
[58:48] it can just encourage us how we address
[58:50] this King don't address the king
[58:52] sleeping
[58:54] hey
[58:55] and you're talking to the king it is
[58:57] better for you my brother to sleep
[58:59] and then wake up fresh and talk to the
[59:02] king
[59:04] because if King Charles come here and
[59:06] the king of Spain come here
[59:09] man
[59:10] we will do Miracles eh
[59:13] only now I'm studying my introduction
[59:19] ok

[59:22] chapter
[59:23] three
[59:25] it is a verse that come that comes after
[59:28] this verse of verse 5.
[59:30] God sounded
[59:33] angry
[59:35] he sounded upset
[59:37] you know when you address your son David
[59:39] you will see one day when you address
[59:41] your son that you love so much that you
[59:44] can die for
[59:46] and he's doing maybe something let's not
[59:48] say stupid just something
[59:50] silly or something that annoys you know
[59:54] some people can say ha
[59:56] this guy no no no no
[59:58] they don't know what is inside you what
[1:00:00] what that boy means to you
[1:00:02] they don't know
[1:00:04] but this verse that we've read that that
[1:00:06] God reminded them that I am the Lord and
[1:00:09] I change not it was before it was before
[1:00:12] this verse I mean it was it came after
[1:00:14] this verse this one says
[1:00:17] and I will come near to you to judgment
[1:00:20] and I will be swift witness against the
[1:00:22] sorcerers and you know what is a
[1:00:24] sorcerer I think your sorcerer is close
[1:00:26] to a wheelchair
[1:00:31] in in my old English Shakespeare in
[1:00:34] English we call it a suit say
[1:00:36] you know it's a suit Sayer
[1:00:38] sorceras people who do so sorry
[1:00:41] and against adulterers
[1:00:44] an evil spirit is that one and we must
[1:00:47] condemn it
[1:00:48] and against false swears and against
[1:00:51] those that oppress the hireling in his
[1:00:55] wages the Widow and the fatherless and
[1:00:57] that turn aside the stranger from his
[1:00:59] right and not
[1:01:02] man
[1:01:04] God sounds like if he come across those
[1:01:07] ones he's reminding us that hey
[1:01:11] time changes
[1:01:14] right
[1:01:15] time changes
[1:01:20] people change it
[1:01:21] changes change or changes change
[1:01:24] weather change
[1:01:28] economies change
[1:01:31] everything
[1:01:33] changed
[1:01:35] only him
[1:01:36] he doesn't change and he wants to take
[1:01:39] you and make you to be unchangeable
[1:01:43] he wants to make you like him
[1:01:46] me and you Debbie God wants to make us
[1:01:48] unchangeable
[1:01:50] he doesn't want us to be affected by
[1:01:51] weather
[1:01:52] by economy by moods by anger by money by
[1:01:57] jobs by Shoes by what what by cars but
[1:02:01] everything he doesn't want us to those
[1:02:03] things to affect us he does not even
[1:02:04] want us to be affected by brother and
[1:02:06] Paul's weakness or whatever is talking
[1:02:08] in the front he wants us to Fly Above
[1:02:11] hi
[1:02:13] that's what he wants about you and when
[1:02:16] you are there you are you are becoming
[1:02:18] like an unchanging God
[1:02:19] because nothing really touches you
[1:02:24] of this world including the Devil
[1:02:27] Himself
[1:02:29] whether he's angry excited you know
[1:02:31] those demons get excited when we curse
[1:02:33] them out
[1:02:34] when we kick them on the teeth
[1:02:37] out
[1:02:38] they get excited you know but that
[1:02:41] doesn't shake you
[1:02:44] so he is reminding them that remember
[1:02:47] everything that God has ever done
[1:02:51] to anyone
[1:02:52] he will do it again today
[1:02:55] can't means that
[1:02:58] the contact that I want to bring this I
[1:03:01] I wrote here that the prophet says um
[1:03:05] there are many things that are
[1:03:07] practically
[1:03:09] uh practically all things change that's
[1:03:11] what the prophet says time people and
[1:03:14] everything right but now even when time
[1:03:16] is normal God's still the same why oops
[1:03:20] my slide ran away is loading says
[1:03:23] loading
[1:03:24] but we can read there now why does God
[1:03:27] wants to change me and you
[1:03:30] why who can tell me
[1:03:34] because God what there's many many
[1:03:36] answers but the point that I just listed
[1:03:39] here is just it's not exhaustive right
[1:03:41] he wants me to be like him
[1:03:44] he he wants to restore me to actually
[1:03:48] how I was before because he saw me he
[1:03:51] chose me before the foundation and I was
[1:03:54] like him and I'm like him actually I'm
[1:03:57] like God you are the Bible the prophet
[1:04:00] told us that you are God
[1:04:02] you are an amateur God
[1:04:05] you are don't you believe it
[1:04:08] you are God
[1:04:09] and how does a god behave
[1:04:12] how does a boy a god a god creates a God
[1:04:15] heals when when you work for a company
[1:04:18] they must realize you must one day
[1:04:20] announce that they say listen you're the
[1:04:22] most privileged people
[1:04:25] you're the most privileged company I've
[1:04:27] ever come across
[1:04:29] they say why say because I'm working for
[1:04:31] you
[1:04:32] they say what what do you mean the young
[1:04:34] man because I'm a son of God
[1:04:37] and do you know that I your company can
[1:04:40] be prosperous or can be destroyed
[1:04:42] because I'm here
[1:04:44] they're blessed
[1:04:46] they better look after you day
[1:04:48] [Laughter]
[1:04:53] is that you are made after God's image
[1:04:57] and he who is born by God is
[1:05:01] is God
[1:05:03] that don't you know that the child of a
[1:05:06] dog
[1:05:06] is a dog
[1:05:08] the child of a an elephant is an
[1:05:11] elephant
[1:05:12] and the child of a a rhino
[1:05:15] a child of a human
[1:05:19] have you ever seen a human bearing a dog
[1:05:23] so a child of God
[1:05:28] it may not believe it but that's what
[1:05:30] you are
[1:05:31] [Laughter]
[1:05:33] now listen to this listen listen to this
[1:05:36] one
[1:05:39] um
[1:05:40] I said he wants to change us into his
[1:05:42] divine nature right today we're just
[1:05:44] gonna be sort of like teaching and we'll
[1:05:46] finish on time but I don't want you to
[1:05:48] lose me because teaching has got a
[1:05:50] problem Brother Andy teaching when you
[1:05:52] are not preaching you're just teaching
[1:05:54] and people tend to oh
[1:05:56] then they lose you along the way because
[1:05:58] you go slow you want the matter to soak
[1:06:00] in and to pause and to think about it
[1:06:03] and to process it and to identify with
[1:06:05] the teachings for that kind of a problem
[1:06:07] but I don't want you to lose me all
[1:06:09] right and I lost my slide
[1:06:13] this one
[1:06:15] let's read what the prophet says there
[1:06:16] from the stage of a perfect man
[1:06:20] that's the way
[1:06:27] when we ask for something and he doesn't
[1:06:30] give us he doesn't give it unto us that
[1:06:33] doesn't shake us a bit
[1:06:38] yeah
[1:06:39] when your wife gives you food
[1:06:42] and you find that
[1:06:43] she didn't cook it that way you actually
[1:06:46] don't like it
[1:06:48] now do you stop loving it
[1:06:51] hey
[1:06:53] Landy I don't even want to find you here
[1:06:55] huh
[1:06:56] just because you cooked that food
[1:06:58] you I mean you love it too much
[1:07:02] you love it too much
[1:07:04] even if
[1:07:06] your husband don't approve certain
[1:07:07] things
[1:07:08] Ah that's not how you judge him
[1:07:12] I'm teaching you young guys who are
[1:07:13] going to be married we are already
[1:07:14] married
[1:07:16] so we are managing it but you who are
[1:07:18] going to be married you must know
[1:07:21] are we not managing product we are doing
[1:07:24] well we are doing well very well
[1:07:27] [Laughter]
[1:07:29] but I'm also reading to us who are
[1:07:31] married
[1:07:32] that
[1:07:35] excuse me that
[1:07:38] it does not even Shake us
[1:07:40] where was I
[1:07:43] sorry
[1:07:45] then like the same things if you had
[1:07:47] another one
[1:07:49] the other one gets head too if you make
[1:07:52] the other one happy the other one gets
[1:07:54] happy too so the prophet here I think is
[1:07:56] talking about
[1:07:58] like in a relationship type of a thing
[1:08:00] have you heard about a man and a woman
[1:08:02] who becomes like they become like the
[1:08:04] same thing
[1:08:05] they become like the same thing and I've
[1:08:07] got a testimony for that I've got I've
[1:08:09] got proof
[1:08:10] I I can tell you now if Matt can sit on
[1:08:13] on the couch and start to think about
[1:08:15] coffee you may find that person Allah
[1:08:17] was thinking of making him coffee
[1:08:19] it happened to me it happens doesn't it
[1:08:22] happen sister
[1:08:23] it never happened to you it happens
[1:08:24] because they are one so
[1:08:27] if if there's many times where I sit and
[1:08:31] and I'm just thinking of something and I
[1:08:32] just see my wife coming to bring it how
[1:08:34] did she know that I'm looking for that
[1:08:37] if because you are one thing not in
[1:08:39] flesh or even in spirit
[1:08:41] and that is how Christ the Bible says
[1:08:44] before you even ask before you even ask
[1:08:48] me I will
[1:08:50] answer you I will already give you
[1:08:52] because the Lord knows we and the Lord
[1:08:55] are one we are connected
[1:08:57] can buy flowers
[1:09:04] where can I get nice flowers and her
[1:09:07] husband is already thinking about it
[1:09:09] because they are what
[1:09:11] that's us and Christ forget about all
[1:09:14] the other couples that I've mentioned
[1:09:15] think about this couple the bride
[1:09:18] in Jesus Christ
[1:09:20] our thoughts must be
[1:09:22] um
[1:09:24] brother and I'm looking for a wait
[1:09:27] ers
[1:09:29] that's the way
[1:09:32] am I
[1:09:34] if you want a way to go to Brother Andy
[1:09:36] there must be harmonious with the
[1:09:39] thoughts of God when when God when the
[1:09:43] Lord thinks this way we also think that
[1:09:45] way ah have you seen a formation of
[1:09:48] airplanes when they when they do
[1:09:49] information how they go you know I've
[1:09:53] never understood how it works I thought
[1:09:54] I'll ask brother Daniel one day Daniel a
[1:09:59] you know this information it's like
[1:10:02] those Pilots they're thinking the same
[1:10:04] thing I was told that sometimes some
[1:10:06] other airplanes don't have a pilot
[1:10:08] they're just they're just remote control
[1:10:10] but they say Harmony
[1:10:13] you know you just see them going this
[1:10:15] way when they attend they go together
[1:10:17] that's our thoughts and Christ's
[1:10:18] thoughts
[1:10:19] us is like Jimmy and and Stephanie
[1:10:24] exactly like that
[1:10:26] you see even the way they are sitting
[1:10:28] that's how us and Christ sit
[1:10:32] sorry to put you on the spot
[1:10:33] [Laughter]
[1:10:36] but it's like a young
[1:10:38] couple
[1:10:39] sitting on the marriage supper table
[1:10:43] the world has just begun
[1:10:45] our world have just started that's what
[1:10:48] is it has our real real life hasn't
[1:10:51] started
[1:10:52] when you get there my brother my sister
[1:10:55] and you are giving you a rope
[1:10:57] and and they say welcome home
[1:11:00] and they tell you your life
[1:11:03] your life has just started
[1:11:07] feel that one you want you wanna you you
[1:11:11] don't worry you'll have enough voice
[1:11:14] to cry
[1:11:16] but Reuben
[1:11:18] welcome home my son your life has just
[1:11:21] begun
[1:11:23] is over
[1:11:25] it's over it's finished done and dusted
[1:11:29] so it is worth it
[1:11:32] for us to even die for it
[1:11:36] if needs be
[1:11:38] to even die for it because death to us
[1:11:41] Paul taught us about death he said ah to
[1:11:44] live is Christ but to die it's even
[1:11:47] again
[1:11:48] didn't he teach us oppa he taught us
[1:11:52] now
[1:11:53] I was trying to show you about that
[1:11:55] Harmony
[1:11:56] they
[1:11:57] he I'm reading there he got to come
[1:12:00] believing that he's got to come
[1:12:02] believing that God is a rewarder to
[1:12:04] those that diligently seek him that's
[1:12:06] the word I wanted to emphasize
[1:12:08] right now we have to come to him in a
[1:12:13] diligent way
[1:12:15] don't ask God something and then
[1:12:18] tomorrow you for God did you really mean
[1:12:20] it
[1:12:21] the god
[1:12:23] everything that God does
[1:12:26] he's serious about it
[1:12:28] God doesn't have time when he's doing
[1:12:30] something and he says no I was just
[1:12:32] joking
[1:12:33] God has got no time for such he's a
[1:12:35] wonderful God he's a nice humorous God
[1:12:38] but he's serious
[1:12:40] he he he he he he can make you your
[1:12:44] seriousness to be serious
[1:12:46] he can make you genuinely genuine
[1:12:50] because everything that you talk to God
[1:12:53] that you talk to God about sorry
[1:12:56] I shouldn't have come to I shouldn't
[1:12:57] have come to church
[1:12:59] I should have stayed home
[1:13:01] and then brother Ed plucks me there and
[1:13:04] you see then I could pray from me
[1:13:07] but don't worry I've got no back
[1:13:10] no don't be threatened I've got no back
[1:13:12] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ no
[1:13:14] back
[1:13:15] the point is this God when he does
[1:13:18] everything he does it seriously
[1:13:21] therefore young men
[1:13:22] young woman
[1:13:24] you children
[1:13:25] young people
[1:13:28] adults everything that we do to God
[1:13:31] myself
[1:13:32] I must mean it I must be serious I must
[1:13:35] mean business with God
[1:13:37] he mustn't talk to God like he said he's
[1:13:39] a he's a thing
[1:13:41] this is our husband man
[1:13:43] and we can only understand
[1:13:46] but we can understand this relationship
[1:13:48] when it gets more revealed to us and how
[1:13:51] can it get revealed if we don't
[1:13:52] diligently ask for more revelation
[1:13:55] huh so that's what we need to do let's
[1:13:57] let's work towards finishing I might not
[1:13:59] I might not over emphasize this
[1:14:02] now literally virtues won't achieve
[1:14:06] God's change
[1:14:07] they can't our natural abilities and the
[1:14:10] way that we are born they say this boy
[1:14:12] he's this little boy he's such a nice
[1:14:14] boy even his grandfather was like that
[1:14:17] that cannot achieve nothing for David
[1:14:20] even if he's taking after his
[1:14:22] grandfather and great-grandfather
[1:14:25] and they are so kind and nice
[1:14:26] kind-hearted that cannot take him into
[1:14:29] heaven not a bit
[1:14:31] huh no no natural issues now I want to
[1:14:35] say this that there are some people who
[1:14:38] have a portion of these virtues
[1:14:39] knowledge and wisdom and patience and so
[1:14:42] forth but they don't profess to be
[1:14:45] Christians
[1:14:46] can you see that the way you need to put
[1:14:48] your jackass now spiritual jackets that
[1:14:51] the natural phenomena of those things
[1:14:54] it's not what you are talking about we
[1:14:56] are talking about the spiritual part the
[1:14:59] the fruits of the spirits of the spirit
[1:15:03] that's what we are talking about those
[1:15:05] things when they start to come they'll
[1:15:07] they'll bring and bear fruits
[1:15:10] virtue of God will bear the fruits of
[1:15:12] God faith of God will bear the fruits of
[1:15:16] the wisdom of God will bear the fruits
[1:15:19] of
[1:15:20] that's what I mean but the wisdom of my
[1:15:24] nature how I was born
[1:15:27] I'm just taking after my father about
[1:15:29] the cubas he's a hard worker and I have
[1:15:31] him to be a hard worker
[1:15:34] you slap up and he's like that and I
[1:15:36] just happen to be like that that's why
[1:15:38] that's why Arman is also told horses for
[1:15:40] the soul
[1:15:42] that cannot help you to be nice and good
[1:15:45] because you are taking after your father
[1:15:47] brother that may not help but what will
[1:15:50] help is to go beyond that one
[1:15:53] to have that natural one and the
[1:15:55] spiritual one the one of your real
[1:15:58] father that wisdom is the one that I'm
[1:16:00] talking about that we come to you Jaden
[1:16:03] and talk to you and God gives you the
[1:16:05] descendant to tell me you know this one
[1:16:08] I was praying about it because that's
[1:16:10] the gift of wisdom that God gave you and
[1:16:13] you just we say what I never thought
[1:16:15] about it that's the gift because that
[1:16:17] kind of a gift bring fruits
[1:16:20] of the spirit
[1:16:22] then we'll know that this boy has got a
[1:16:24] gift of wisdom and that's what we want
[1:16:27] to see here
[1:16:30] that our virtues
[1:16:32] our virtues that we are talking about
[1:16:34] will not just be for professing to be
[1:16:36] Christians
[1:16:38] Hallelujah
[1:16:40] are we Amen in that
[1:16:42] okay we already spoke about the sheep
[1:16:44] and the dogs
[1:16:46] that they don't they don't don't
[1:16:48] manufacture sheep they're just sheep
[1:16:51] we want to come to a point where we
[1:16:53] don't manufacture to be Christians
[1:16:56] we don't we don't work hard for you
[1:16:59] well it's just
[1:17:01] we are we are on autopilot
[1:17:03] we are just Christians we we we we just
[1:17:07] the rivers of love
[1:17:09] of Life the rivers of blessings the
[1:17:12] rivers of they just come out
[1:17:15] we will get there we are seeking towards
[1:17:17] working towards the mark of the High
[1:17:20] Calling to get their brothers and
[1:17:22] sisters and we must not forget when we
[1:17:24] talk to God to be serious about what we
[1:17:27] are asking for and to be sincere
[1:17:30] if we don't
[1:17:32] feel the level of sincerity
[1:17:34] ask God he'll give it to you
[1:17:37] and ask him sincerely he'll give it
[1:17:40] there's nothing that is difficult for
[1:17:42] him another aspect in closing is the one
[1:17:46] of the word seed
[1:17:48] you know the weight of God is a seat
[1:17:51] he says sit you know when you plant a
[1:17:54] seed and then that's it you give you
[1:17:57] some water
[1:17:59] and it says the prophet says that and it
[1:18:02] sits under the right temperature
[1:18:04] and it sits under the right conditions
[1:18:07] and the Sun the sunlight come and is
[1:18:09] under the right conditions that seat
[1:18:11] will start to grow
[1:18:13] and it will eventually bring the fruits
[1:18:16] so that's exactly how the word of God is
[1:18:19] when the word of God comes
[1:18:21] when you eat it when you read it when
[1:18:22] you listen to it listen for it to to be
[1:18:25] inside the ground of your heart
[1:18:28] so that because it is the correct seat I
[1:18:31] can tell who is the right seed so that
[1:18:33] it can grow don't just listen to it as
[1:18:35] if you are listening to a radio
[1:18:38] or to burn hair you know Ben hair
[1:18:40] watching it tomorrow what was his name
[1:18:42] you forgot
[1:18:45] huh
[1:18:46] and then you you you you must listen to
[1:18:50] someone that after 20 years that someone
[1:18:53] still resonate with you
[1:18:55] it has done an impact in your life that
[1:18:57] someone that made you repent how many
[1:19:00] can remember them
[1:19:01] there's someone that stuck with you
[1:19:04] I said I'm not pleasing life for God
[1:19:07] I was supposed just to be teaching
[1:19:09] but I just can't help it that that
[1:19:12] sermon
[1:19:13] that just blew your mind
[1:19:16] that that's someone that you had and it
[1:19:18] just it just you just can't forget it
[1:19:21] there's one someone that I never forget
[1:19:23] there's many but there's one for New
[1:19:25] Zealand that I never forget his one
[1:19:27] brother Ben was preaching about breaking
[1:19:29] the cycles of generations and I found
[1:19:32] that it was a series it was a series he
[1:19:35] was going through and I just came in the
[1:19:37] middle of that series my first or second
[1:19:39] service here man
[1:19:41] I always ask him is it possible to
[1:19:43] preach it again
[1:19:44] [Laughter]
[1:19:48] because it just got stuck with me I I
[1:19:51] just saw the Bible and what he read I
[1:19:54] think he read in the book of
[1:19:56] Deuteronomy or somewhere in the Old
[1:19:58] Testament it just it just it just did
[1:20:01] something to me
[1:20:02] that same one and I knew that it was not
[1:20:05] him
[1:20:06] it was the Lord
[1:20:08] now the way it is a seat allow it don't
[1:20:11] let the weight to fall on the ground
[1:20:13] prepare the ground
[1:20:15] so that it can sit on the right ground
[1:20:18] the seat which is the weight and it will
[1:20:22] grow it will germinate it will bring
[1:20:25] because you are creating the right
[1:20:26] temperature we are created the ground
[1:20:28] you are open-minded you are saying Lord
[1:20:31] pour in my heart your weight then he
[1:20:34] will pour and the seed will come you
[1:20:36] will be amazed ah this
[1:20:37] up I never used to do this am I able I
[1:20:40] never knew that I can lay someone's
[1:20:43] and pray for them and they get well you
[1:20:46] sisters if if the husband is not there
[1:20:48] don't don't shy away
[1:20:51] etana to lay hands on Mommy and pray for
[1:20:53] her
[1:20:54] and she gets healed because
[1:20:57] there are the fruits fruits those are
[1:20:59] the fruits that I'm talking about
[1:21:01] the gifts and just lay your mom hands in
[1:21:04] sealed
[1:21:06] and we hold on them and you will see
[1:21:08] soon enough you will be
[1:21:12] having the stature of a perfect God
[1:21:16] you'll have it you'll be you'll be like
[1:21:18] him full fully fleshed God on Earth
[1:21:22] you'll be like that
[1:21:24] lastly
[1:21:26] I want us to to read here
[1:21:29] that sometimes and I don't want this to
[1:21:32] happen to you but sometimes what
[1:21:33] prevents progress is is the guy
[1:21:37] I'm watching on the mirror
[1:21:41] problem this guy
[1:21:43] that's the one that I need to manage not
[1:21:46] my wife
[1:21:48] or my husband
[1:21:51] no no no no I must manage this guy in
[1:21:53] front of them if I can just manage the
[1:21:55] guy in front of the mirror
[1:21:57] because more often than not he is the
[1:22:01] problem
[1:22:03] and you know what he says he will tell
[1:22:05] you that
[1:22:07] he's not the problem
[1:22:10] he will show you he's quick to think to
[1:22:13] show you the problem is the next person
[1:22:16] if they didn't do that I mean I'm not
[1:22:18] hard on them no no I'm not I'm just
[1:22:20] thinking that if they didn't do they do
[1:22:22] this way
[1:22:23] I wouldn't have done this
[1:22:26] the problem is not me that's what he
[1:22:28] says this one in the in front of the
[1:22:30] mirror we are too
[1:22:35] besides you all I'm just trying I'm just
[1:22:37] trying to show you that you are wrong
[1:22:39] ah but the man in the mirror never
[1:22:42] looked at himself
[1:22:43] he never even said hey honey can you
[1:22:45] help me to look to can you just help me
[1:22:48] to to to I'm failing to do
[1:22:51] self-introspection can you just come and
[1:22:53] help me to self-introspect in this area
[1:22:55] in this area in this area I am not sure
[1:22:58] you see if you do that
[1:23:00] man
[1:23:02] you're impressing the Lord because you
[1:23:04] are already
[1:23:05] allowing the word to criticize you you
[1:23:09] are allowing you are opening yourself
[1:23:10] you are making yourself a vulnerable and
[1:23:13] that God helps those kind of people God
[1:23:15] helps people who loses themselves and he
[1:23:18] cashes them and he helps them if you
[1:23:21] lose yourself
[1:23:22] you make yourself vulnerable before God
[1:23:24] not anywhere don't misunderstand me a
[1:23:27] young girl don't make yourself
[1:23:29] vulnerable to a day
[1:23:31] no no I mean before God right
[1:23:34] Lose Yourself young man
[1:23:39] let me lose myself sorry
[1:23:42] I like calling people's names
[1:23:45] just when you go to God am I you lose
[1:23:47] yourself and then God you take over
[1:23:51] and then God you you do things that you
[1:23:54] have never ever thought that you will do
[1:23:57] you you dream dreams that are holy that
[1:24:01] are beneficial to the church you'll sing
[1:24:04] in such a way that we say ah what
[1:24:06] happened to that Organo jail
[1:24:09] because he Lo he just lose herself in
[1:24:12] the Lord and God took over her life if
[1:24:16] we lose ourselves Malachi I I want to be
[1:24:18] specific I like a personal gospel
[1:24:23] I like a gospel that is personalized so
[1:24:27] by now I'm sure you know me you don't
[1:24:28] take offense please I'm I wish it was
[1:24:32] not broadcasted but I like to be you
[1:24:35] know that we can individualize this
[1:24:37] thing and then when you are there you
[1:24:39] must say and you pradampo and preach it
[1:24:42] to me because I'm taking this for myself
[1:24:44] that the man in front of the mirror more
[1:24:48] often than not he is the problem I'm not
[1:24:51] saying is every problem but more 98 of
[1:24:55] the time if I solve him
[1:24:58] and use all of your men in the in your
[1:25:00] mirror life is we've got no problems
[1:25:03] we'll be able to worship to Fellowship
[1:25:05] to serve God fully and will be
[1:25:08] within the stature of a perfect God
[1:25:12] and we go home
[1:25:16] are we together
[1:25:19] so that's the greatest enemy our God is
[1:25:21] William Branham he says here he's the
[1:25:23] one that's got took his he gets in God's
[1:25:26] way
[1:25:28] he's the one that gets lazy
[1:25:31] he's the one that gets to a place
[1:25:33] sometimes where he thinks he can do
[1:25:34] something about it when he does that he
[1:25:37] shows God right out of the picture but
[1:25:40] when I get rid of that guy in front of
[1:25:42] the mirror
[1:25:44] when I get to the place that he's out of
[1:25:47] the way do you think God will talk
[1:25:49] through me if I don't get out of the way
[1:25:52] I just come here and I think that I know
[1:25:54] you I can tell you your problems you
[1:25:57] David I can sort you out I can help no
[1:25:59] no no no the god there's no good
[1:26:01] there's no good I must learn to to pray
[1:26:04] I can read the Bible but the moment I
[1:26:07] cannot set myself aside with my Wicked
[1:26:10] thoughts
[1:26:12] I don't even qualify to stand here I
[1:26:15] must put everything aside and said Lord
[1:26:17] I am blank
[1:26:19] I wish my eyes was closed and I didn't
[1:26:22] even see who's in church then I just
[1:26:24] preached
[1:26:27] that's that's the attitude that a
[1:26:28] minister should come
[1:26:31] and talk the word of God
[1:26:34] not with preconceived ideas amen so
[1:26:37] that's sorry that that punch was for the
[1:26:39] ministers not for you eh it was for us
[1:26:44] it's all about about it tonight I kept
[1:26:46] to my weight
[1:26:48] and that I promise you
[1:26:51] I will finish on time because it's
[1:26:53] prayer meeting tonight

[1:27:11] and just mention them if there's any
[1:27:14] and then we will pray I believe
[1:27:16] there's many sequence Among Us
[1:27:19] and then
[1:27:21] I have seen the sisters Christine's
[1:27:24] message that loins are still not well
[1:27:28] some are recovering

[1:27:35] take it and receive it the Lord has
[1:27:38] already healed you amen
