[0:00] I want you to imagine now because
[0:01] imagining is not always a bad thing it's
[0:04] good to imagine but just don't imagine
[0:06] bad things imagine good things has been
[0:08] I've been preset a few weeks ago imagine
[0:10] good things imagine God start pondering
[0:14] over how great it's going to be and and
[0:16] ponder over what you know the things
[0:19] that God's going to do in your life you
[0:22] know and as you see him dealing with
[0:23] something and imagine what it's going to
[0:25] be like when you're free from that
[0:26] complex when you're free from that
[0:28] whatever troubling you you know when
[0:31] you're free from the trial that you're
[0:32] going through imagine the fellowship as
[0:35] you become more and more like Christ as
[0:38] you grow in as Grace now let's imagine
[0:43] that you never leave the secret place
[0:47] that you never leave that place that
[0:49] Shekinah and it content and this God
[0:51] never leaves you right but what I'm
[0:55] talking about now as a place where
[0:58] you're invincible all the time there is
[1:01] nothing that will ever happen that
[1:04] whatever you say will happen now we're
[1:08] in a transitional phase so you can
[1:10] understand that it's not easy to try and
[1:12] bring these thoughts because yes we are
[1:15] you can you can be governed by your
[1:17] experiences and what you see and what
[1:19] you expend what you feel and what the
[1:22] history of of when you did this that
[1:25] happen cause and effect you can be
[1:27] governed by that or you can allow
[1:29] yourself to start imagining and start
[1:32] thinking on and start believing that we
[1:34] are actually transitioning into another
[1:36] higher realm into a realm of perfect
[1:40] faith and we will end them as God now
[1:44] deals with all the complexes and deals
[1:46] with all the fears there's little things
[1:49] in your life that you don't even know
[1:51] there that are causing you to fear about
[1:53] stuff that was sowed when you were 2
[1:55] years old when you were 6 when you were
[1:57] 4 when you were 19 whatever little
[2:02] things little tears they're all gone
[2:05] they're all on their way out all of them
[2:08] one by one because you see those are the
[2:12] things and those are the tools
[2:13] the devil uses to take you out of the
[2:15] secret place by fear fear cripples faith
[2:18] so the moment he can get you scared of
[2:21] something it cripples your faith in your
[2:23] gift can't operate any more properly
[2:25] you'll end up operating your gift and it
[2:27] might be a bit shaky it might sound good
[2:29] it might look good but it doesn't have
[2:30] the ring because you're out of that
[2:33] Shekinah buy some complex you see now
[2:36] that's why the whole series down on the
[2:38] complex is and all those thing to read
[2:41] to enlighten the processes that it's
[2:44] happening right now you know we talked
[2:45] about the title deed and how he's
[2:47] searching it right back to under all the
[2:49] things and search you back to your
[2:51] purity and your your eternal state in
[2:54] your theophany you know and we talked
[2:56] about deep things there but we've gone
[2:58] through it so that's all good hallelujah
[3:01] carry on so here we have now actually
[3:12] let me just blank net for a see that's
[3:15] the I was continuing some ninety-one
[3:17] there because basically some ninety-one
[3:20] says he that dwells in the secret place
[3:22] of musashi arrest under the shadow
[3:24] almighty and then all the way list out
[3:26] everything that happens when you do
[3:27] actually stay there and that is exactly
[3:30] perfect faith that's exactly a son
[3:33] manifested that's exactly what it is
[3:37] Alleluia but I want to talk about just
[3:40] verses just quickly now just to
[3:42] establish the store that you have in the
[3:45] world today two atmospheres
[3:47] there's many variants and derivatives of
[3:50] those two atmospheres but is too and
[3:53] prophetically speaking if we want to
[3:55] place it in Scripture you've got and
[3:58] we've heard preaching on this for years
[4:00] you've got the revelation chapter nine
[4:02] and you've got that hell coming up and
[4:04] spewing out on the earth and influencing
[4:07] and Hollywood and all that stuff and
[4:09] then you've got then God actually raised
[4:11] the standard against them a direct
[4:13] combat for that revelation chapter ten
[4:15] here comes the mighty angel down with
[4:18] his atmosphere Amen so now as a believer
[4:22] and even as the unbelievers everybody
[4:24] has a choice now what atmosphere they're
[4:26] going to allow
[4:27] to their life amen I'll just put that
[4:38] there
[4:43] and I ask you this question is before we
[4:45] go who I'm not looking at you as
[4:49] individuals I'm just looking but who
[4:52] will be your atmosphere who you've got
[4:55] to make that choice it doesn't matter
[4:57] how what age you are young people who
[5:00] will be your atmosphere there's two and
[5:05] I asked you that question because that's
[5:07] what's going to really affect you and
[5:09] and really ask yourself that constantly
[5:14] all day where does this come from
[5:18] what's the Sun doing now judge yourself
[5:22] that you be not judged walk
[5:25] circumspectly because the days are evil
[5:29] be wise in your walk and and discern
[5:34] what you're doing and what you're
[5:37] allowing into your life because
[5:40] everything carries a spirit and will
[5:44] bring an atmosphere hallelujah yep
[6:02] some 91 verse 3 says for he shall
[6:06] deliver thee from the snare of the
[6:08] hunters from every troublesome matter
[6:11] now we read over this and we think wow
[6:14] that's so nice but let's just stop a
[6:17] little minute and let's look carefully
[6:19] because this here is a vision that you
[6:22] know sometimes we don't actually
[6:24] experience and there's reasons why we
[6:27] don't experience it and its fullness and
[6:30] one is because it wasn't the age for it
[6:34] and 2 that on an actual level and a
[6:37] personal level is we come and we walk
[6:39] cuddle sometimes we get carnal we allow
[6:42] things to come into our lives that bring
[6:44] us into a carnal state and therefore we
[6:46] leaving and all the effects of being
[6:49] able to walk and remain in the secret
[6:51] place we don't actually we're not able
[6:55] to share it all of those things until
[6:57] their fulness because our mind is alive
[7:01] our will is starting to say things and
[7:02] do things and want things and the lust
[7:05] of the flesh starts coming in and we
[7:06] want to do this and we make these
[7:07] decisions and all of that because you
[7:09] see you leave that place but when you're
[7:11] in that place whose will is King his
[7:14] will remains and you were in when you're
[7:19] in that place if there is a reference
[7:21] like no other place amen who knows what
[7:25] there's like you know when you're in the
[7:26] Shekinah glory of God and and my and
[7:29] you're walking you have those days and
[7:31] it's just like wow and whatever he says
[7:33] you do you know and you'll just you'll
[7:35] deal with him now I'm telling you now
[7:37] this is a reality that we will remain in
[7:39] this place we will walk in this place we
[7:42] will talk in this place we will
[7:43] fellowship in this place completely
[7:46] we're going to come to there and we are
[7:48] coming to that and it's ours for now now
[7:51] we're transitioning we're crossing the
[7:54] sound barrier of from going into little
[7:57] faith people to perfect faith people
[7:59] this is our heritance this is the day
[8:02] this is the time this is the hour it's
[8:04] not just a pretty sermon anymore or an
[8:07] ideology or some nice thing that
[8:09] preachers say welcome to the time and
[8:12] age of perfect faith and I really feel
[8:15] anointed to say that
[8:16] that we are right here on the brink of
[8:19] where this transition is taking place
[8:21] and so you see I preached this vision
[8:23] with all my heart
[8:25] Alleluia some 91 verse 5 and we're not
[8:29] just reading all the Sun I'm just going
[8:31] to paraphrase a little bit here just a
[8:33] few verses that I select it out
[8:35] so some 91 verse 5 says thou shalt not
[8:39] be afraid for the terror by night nor
[8:43] for the arrow that flies by day so now
[8:47] you don't ever have to be afraid again
[8:50] you don't ever have to fear again
[8:53] and when you're in this place you will
[8:55] never fear because perfect love casts
[8:58] out all fear
[8:59] hallelujah so when you're in this place
[9:02] now you can just you can discern your
[9:04] own life if you're here or not if you're
[9:07] walking in the secret place and you can
[9:10] discern if you're only in the secret
[9:12] place in your prayer room and that's
[9:14] fine you know I'm sure the Lord has he's
[9:16] bringing us right ease we're growing
[9:18] we're becoming more like them and we're
[9:20] going up into the image and the ministry
[9:22] is ministering an entrance okay
[9:25] the Bible says that an entrance shall be
[9:28] ministered unto you and into the
[9:29] everlasting kingdom of our Lord and
[9:31] Savior now you can discern whether you
[9:36] are always in this place and or whether
[9:39] it's just your prayer room and sometimes
[9:40] at church and whatever we're where that
[9:43] were you just completely free and
[9:45] nothing fazes you and you can just be
[9:46] you're right there and you're there now
[9:50] you'll never be afraid you won't be
[9:54] afraid for any arrows or any warfare or
[9:56] anything
[9:57] you'll never worry you live you'll have
[9:59] a perfect faith in the Word of God a
[10:05] reference you have no lust no desire for
[10:09] certain covetousness none of that can be
[10:13] in that place and I just read that up
[10:16] again he shall deliver thee from every
[10:19] troublesome matter some 91 verse 6 nor
[10:23] of the evil thing that walks in darkness
[10:25] nor of calamity and the evil spirit at
[10:29] noonday
[10:30] some 91 verse seven a Thousand shall
[10:32] fall at thy side and ten thousand at thy
[10:35] right hand it shall not come nigh thee
[10:37] brother Branham said when the church
[10:39] recognizes who she is she will be
[10:41] invincible army which she can discern
[10:43] the Antichrist spirit and her myths and
[10:46] he can stop pulling her out of that
[10:48] atmosphere and bringing her into a
[10:52] carnal state fighting each other and
[10:54] looking at that person in that person
[10:57] all the time she'll be an invincible
[11:02] army when she can discern it and come on
[11:05] top of that and when he comes you can
[11:07] just say hey I can see what you're doing
[11:08] there get out of me you know get away
[11:10] dip now it doesn't that's just spiritual
[11:15] in the spiritual warfare but there is a
[11:17] realm that we're going into and we're
[11:19] moving into now we're physical things
[11:22] won't even affect you now that sounds a
[11:26] bit radical but it's true the Prophet
[11:29] actually brings it out very clearly and
[11:31] it's all an example in the Bible as well
[11:34] we're men like Paul could physically be
[11:40] unaffected by their physical
[11:41] surroundings by an atmosphere that they
[11:45] remained in by a by staying in that
[11:48] place with God we're not even physical
[11:50] circumstances would affect them oh go
[11:57] back
[11:59] I love this is one I've always just
[12:02] claimed for me and you know claim the
[12:06] war for me but this one really stuck out
[12:08] for me years ago this is there shall no
[12:09] evil befall thee neither shall any
[12:12] plague come nigh thy dwelling now who
[12:17] bets that says it I'm not going to argue
[12:20] the word the word says that no sickness
[12:23] no plague is going to come near your
[12:25] house right amen I'll leave it there but
[12:28] you see this is the vision this is the
[12:31] truth this is what we're coming to this
[12:34] is the reality now are you going to just
[12:37] are you going to claim that is that
[12:40] yours are you going to own that and say
[12:43] that's my now I want it that's my
[12:45] inheritance I don't have to have any
[12:47] sickness in my home
[12:48] now don't get condemned when you get
[12:50] sickness in your home because we I get
[12:51] sickness in my home too but you see I
[12:53] don't regardless of what the
[12:55] circumstances is I'm still going to hold
[12:57] to that no plague regardless of what
[13:01] happening I'm not going to let that
[13:02] deter me and make me upset and make me
[13:04] flustered no no way because if you keep
[13:09] doing that then women back to the
[13:11] subconscious again you're training the
[13:13] people downstairs to accept plagues and
[13:15] then Varian you just fighting your own
[13:18] you're fighting against yourself now but
[13:20] if you always have a what does it like a
[13:23] stalwart stance against it and who cares
[13:26] if it happens no I still claim that this
[13:29] is mine no plague and even when it's
[13:31] happening and there's a sickness in my
[13:32] home Oh cold in my own body and I hate
[13:34] it I say no place will come not my
[13:37] dwelling Satan get out of here get out
[13:39] of here this is not your place and so
[13:41] you see now on a personal level I'm
[13:44] sending messages down to the crew that
[13:46] runs the ship we never given Amen we
[13:50] always stand for the word regardless of
[13:53] circumstances nothing's going to move me
[13:55] as Paul said some 9111 for he shall give
[13:59] his angels charge over thee to keep thee
[14:01] in all thy ways amen so you're perfectly
[14:05] protected perfectly kept and perfect
[14:07] love perfect peace and perfect faith
[14:09] when you're in the secret place you can
[14:12] see now
[14:13] why the devil Dean's are very important
[14:15] to pull you out of it and make you mad
[14:18] at each other and fight each other and
[14:20] do whatever he can try and do but UCS
[14:23] here yeah we're so blessed you know
[14:25] let's keep this what we have bye
[14:28] let's keep birds endeavor to keep the
[14:30] unity of the Spirit in the bonds of
[14:32] peace conduct yourself humbly with love
[14:35] and make an extra effort with love to
[14:38] show love and to be humble about it
[14:42] amen it's very important their outward
[14:45] conduct the Bible visits that quite
[14:48] clearly you know Paul talks about with
[14:50] all ol eNOS and meekness because we're
[14:53] humans and we have annoying things about
[14:55] us that can annoy other humans on a
[14:57] human level so let's just you know and
[15:00] so there there's reasons for that we
[15:02] don't want to give the devil any ground
[15:04] to work on amen and they had a breakfast
[15:11] with about 600 ministers met together
[15:13] and they put a big German camera there
[15:16] and the Holy Ghost and that same pillar
[15:18] of fire came down and was took on the
[15:21] German camera three times that morning
[15:23] and swept through the atmosphere changed
[15:28] sorry is something missing hear that
[15:29] right that's right worst wished I'd have
[15:33] thought and brought it with me was in a
[15:36] Christian businessman this month or a
[15:38] couple months ago rather what is it
[15:40] its atmosphere men and woman should live
[15:43] under that atmosphere don't get out from
[15:46] under some normal world existing
[15:49] influence he's that sounds he's actually
[15:53] saying don't get under it
[15:55] stop getting under a worldly influence
[15:58] stop filling your mind or so much
[16:00] worldly affairs all the time because
[16:02] it's going to put give you and it's
[16:03] going to create an atmosphere as much as
[16:08] we can reason that with all sorts of
[16:10] reasons the devil gives reasons don't
[16:14] get out of that godly atmosphere staying
[16:16] it all your life remain in it it's too
[16:20] late in the day to come out of that
[16:22] atmosphere
[16:24] too late in the day you don't have to
[16:26] come out of that atmosphere anymore yes
[16:30] you're transitioning it out until you
[16:31] all your fears and stuff a gamma because
[16:34] trials and things you know you fail and
[16:35] you go through trials and so you come
[16:38] out sometimes but eventually you won't
[16:41] actually you're going to abide lujah
[16:45] eventually and I believe we're out in
[16:48] that season now as you know what God is
[16:51] doing that's why with all my heart I say
[16:53] apply the word apply what you've heard
[16:56] don't just sit and listen and enjoy the
[16:59] sermons act upon them do them let it
[17:04] become your life hallelujah let it
[17:08] become you but stay under the atmosphere
[17:11] of the Lord Jesus I'm going to listen to
[17:14] what Malachi 4 see is here I'm going to
[17:16] I with all my heart you know and it's
[17:17] not as easy as it sounds but I'm going
[17:19] to say it anyway stay under the
[17:20] atmosphere of Jesus Christ remain under
[17:23] that atmosphere abide under the shadow
[17:25] of the Almighty dwell in the secret
[17:27] place of the Most High
[17:29] because the things that we just read is
[17:30] your portion hallelujah amen what we
[17:40] need is a Holy Ghost atmosphere that's
[17:42] right an atmosphere where the power of
[17:45] gods are moving one Accord one place
[17:48] gather together under that atmosphere of
[17:51] expectant so there is an atmosphere of
[17:55] expectation when you have an expectation
[17:58] when you come in don't think it's vain
[18:01] the devil's going to pour a thought into
[18:03] you is just pain it's just going to be
[18:05] just like any other service you've just
[18:07] done this you've been through this look
[18:10] what you said to your husband or your
[18:11] wife on the way to church you just put
[18:14] that under the blood and say sorry as
[18:16] fast as you can and then you you sit
[18:18] there and you say we're going to have a
[18:19] good service today amen and you believe
[18:21] that and you have an expectation that
[18:23] expectation brother bonuses is an
[18:25] atmosphere in itself that's creating an
[18:28] atmosphere he's got the atmosphere of
[18:30] expecting God to move down and through
[18:33] signs and wonders amen who sits in here
[18:37] when the
[18:37] morning is an expects God to do signs
[18:39] and wonders Amen expected Alleluia
[18:45] expected wanted I want that you know and
[18:48] because that's where we're the more
[18:51] omnipotence comes the miraculous takes
[18:53] place amen and you'll see
[18:55] transformations conversions healings
[18:58] restorations and all of that
[19:00] hallelujah your dreams will come true
[19:02] amen hallelujah if your dreams are godly
[19:05] hallelujah what you think on and what
[19:09] you say and what you do creates an
[19:10] atmosphere Amen so he says here let's
[19:13] move ourselves up into that bracket step
[19:17] up in faith move out of these three
[19:19] dimensions up into the next one if we've
[19:22] been told to do that that means we can
[19:24] it's not a carrot front you can't
[19:27] actually get to you can attain to it
[19:29] because you already have it it's your
[19:31] inheritance and he's giving it to you
[19:33] hallelujah so I encourage you you know
[19:36] and I'm sure we're hear it many times
[19:38] have an expectation because it's
[19:41] creating an atmosphere and it's not a
[19:43] man Alleluia amen this continues on this
[19:51] is say Lord I just believe that you're
[19:54] going to pour your blessings
[19:56] I'm expecting it now all things are
[19:59] moving right in and I'm expecting to see
[20:01] the exceedingly abundantly now I'm
[20:05] expecting it and when you go you come
[20:08] down and say well I don't know about it
[20:12] well see you hurt the other person maybe
[20:16] you're affecting people now you're
[20:19] sitting what by one of them and you say
[20:21] oh Lord
[20:22] now he's meaning this in a good way just
[20:24] tear them down now you know this is
[20:27] older language you know they probably
[20:29] mean like you know just like get a hold
[20:31] of that person bless them
[20:34] amen and if it's someone that's annoying
[20:37] to you Lord bless them Oh meet them
[20:41] today hallelujah amen you know it says
[20:44] bless those that persecute you and you
[20:47] know and someone you know maybe they're
[20:48] not persecuting you but maybe there's a
[20:49] trait and their character
[20:51] knowings you just bless them pray for
[20:54] them combat the enemy because he'll be
[20:57] sitting there and he'll be firing
[20:58] thoughts into your mind in the service
[21:00] about that person to try and destroy the
[21:02] atmosphere to distract you from
[21:04] expecting God to move so instead of just
[21:06] dwelling on that as soon as the thought
[21:08] comes and the feeling comes over you
[21:10] angst about that person you start
[21:13] praying or god bless that person bless
[21:15] them pouring a spirit on them amen you
[21:18] see what happens
[21:19] they don't change the atmosphere
[21:20] hallelujah and when you go you come and
[21:23] it says and I'm expecting great things
[21:26] just tear them down I'm expecting great
[21:29] things see and that expectancy will get
[21:32] that unity among the people you see
[21:35] visit do you think the devil just leaves
[21:38] us alone when we come to church when
[21:40] we're sitting here and we're waiting for
[21:42] the service to start he's busy he's busy
[21:45] and he's trying to get the church and a
[21:47] chick stalemate spiritual stalemate
[21:50] thoughts here and thoughts here and this
[21:53] that and the other and lunch he's trying
[21:56] his best this is a warfare you're
[21:59] stepping into a battle zone now you can
[22:02] sit the old God come down today I want
[22:05] to see your glory amen
[22:07] hallelujah amen praying for this one and
[22:11] that one and the burdens on your heart
[22:12] just praying you know that's not in vain
[22:16] it'll actually you want to be distracted
[22:19] by God amen that's he's a gentleman he
[22:23] ain't going to just come and force his
[22:24] way around like the enemy does so you
[22:26] have to make a decision to be distracted
[22:28] by God you're actually taking the good
[22:32] things of God and the things of the
[22:33] world and praying an expectation for God
[22:36] to move Alleluia
[22:41] these are common inhibitors to a good
[22:44] atmosphere as fear as we've already gone
[22:47] through complaining god help me
[22:50] covetousness pride you know I'm just
[22:53] listening my troubles here I don't know
[22:55] about you but negative thoughts and
[22:57] testimony and then this one here natural
[23:00] worldly influence
[23:03] you pour stuff in that's from the this
[23:05] world and it and it creates an
[23:07] atmosphere in your life and that
[23:08] atmosphere makes you not want to read
[23:10] the Bible makes you not want to pray it
[23:12] makes you not you know you might do it
[23:14] but you don't want to do it you'll do it
[23:17] because you know it's right and you know
[23:18] it's going to help you and you want to
[23:20] get out of the condition you're in but
[23:21] you don't feel like it and the reason is
[23:23] is because this thing's going in there's
[23:25] over worldly influence now too so
[23:33] powerful your thoughts are I think I've
[23:34] actually already mentioned this way down
[23:36] in the series and it says then you take
[23:38] a man sitting here this morning that's
[23:40] not a bit sick and let him begin to get
[23:42] his heart believing he is sick they'll
[23:45] Peck him out of the building it's pretty
[23:47] severe that your thoughts can actually
[23:51] determine your physical health you as
[23:56] your faith is so be it unto you
[23:59] that's not Christian science I'm not
[24:02] meaning might never matter but you see
[24:04] the thing of it is it's the atmosphere
[24:06] that you live in this is the sort of
[24:15] quote that you that brother Kai Dre
[24:17] would probably preach but I love it it's
[24:20] so good and I'm not going to do what he
[24:22] does but you know on it just you just
[24:24] pretend it brother kai Dre's here when I
[24:26] read this okay but it's the attitude of
[24:29] the people that brings the results
[24:31] that's the reason at Pentecost they had
[24:34] to go to an upper room and pray until
[24:36] the Holy Ghost came because they got in
[24:38] one place and won a call and we just
[24:40] talked about that the expectation having
[24:43] that desire for God to move amen and
[24:46] fight the distractions away because they
[24:49] will come and they're going to try and
[24:51] keep us in a natural place in a natural
[24:53] state they will come don't don't don't
[24:57] don't be ignorant of the enemy's devices
[25:00] now yes you see that's why we've been
[25:03] told to have an expectation and to pray
[25:05] and to read the Bible because it's
[25:07] getting your mind on Christ
[25:09] Alleluia preparing for the worship and
[25:11] the word to come forth so he says here
[25:14] because they got in one place and one
[25:16] Accord
[25:17] it's the atmosphere what brings the
[25:19] results you believe that let every man
[25:23] and woman in this building this morning
[25:25] boy or girl your young children you can
[25:29] too you're not too young
[25:30] amen hallelujah get everything from
[25:34] their minds but the Lord Jesus and
[25:37] believe that he's standing present right
[25:40] now and you'll see something happening
[25:43] that will cause headlines and newspaper
[25:45] in the morning hallelujah
[25:47] that's right its atmosphere hallelujah
[25:51] amen it's quite a powerful fall that's a
[25:55] powerful thought amen
[25:57] he's not just saying that it's not just
[25:58] a pretty word this is the Prophet
[26:00] speaking and he's declaring this is what
[26:02] can happen you see do you think that in
[26:05] the Jerusalem news the day after the
[26:07] panic of the day of Pentecost there was
[26:10] probably a news headline that drunk
[26:13] people came out of an upper room Amen
[26:15] hallelujah and they told the streets
[26:17] apart and three thousand people were
[26:19] getting dunked in water
[26:21] there was probably news about it
[26:23] hallelujah amen and so the prophets now
[26:26] saying you know like you know they're so
[26:28] marvelous and we've experienced that we
[26:31] were all in one Accord and gods are
[26:32] moving and we're having a glorious time
[26:35] hallelujah and in his freedom and
[26:37] liberty in the spirit to to pray through
[26:40] four things in to see the miraculous
[26:42] take place to see people get born again
[26:44] hallelujah and if people come in this is
[26:47] what we really need and want is when
[26:50] these people come in and God comes down
[26:52] they can just go man oh my who are these
[26:56] people where did they come from
[26:58] hallelujah amen glory to God amen that
[27:04] makes me very happy to think that such a
[27:06] simple thing it's not complicated it's
[27:09] just practical stuff and we've heard
[27:10] preaching on it before but you see I
[27:12] don't know why but you know that we just
[27:14] don't do it sometimes sit there and you
[27:17] stew on things and you start planning
[27:19] out your week right God have mercy on us
[27:23] Amen Alleluia
[27:25] you see we're not doing it deliberately
[27:26] see it's not we that's really doing it
[27:28] the devil's reminding your memory
[27:30] remember a memory memory memory memory
[27:32] memory affections affections affections
[27:35] imaginations all those things he's
[27:37] firing them at you because he doesn't
[27:39] want the staff he doesn't want headlines
[27:41] in the Stokes Valley times hallelujah
[27:44] people came pouring out of the church
[27:46] amen all these people started getting
[27:48] saved Alleluia amen
[27:50] start imagining good things amen
[27:53] hallelujah glory to God isn't he
[27:58] wonderful
[28:01] Alleluia listen I'm going to say
[28:05] something look faith is unconscious amen
[28:09] you believe it now I've learned that in
[28:12] the years of travel around the world the
[28:14] meeting the peoples of all different
[28:17] walks but faith is unconscious you got
[28:21] faith and don't even know that's right
[28:24] you have faith you might not even know
[28:29] hiding down there somewhere but you've
[28:32] got it
[28:33] amen you hold that and you say I have
[28:36] faith you testify I've got faith I have
[28:40] it and you don't prophecies here you've
[28:46] got faith and don't even know it so you
[28:47] might not be able to figure it all out
[28:49] don't try and figure it out it was given
[28:52] to you it's given to you
[28:55] amen I think later on we'll talk about
[28:57] don't question it either
[28:58] never question your faith that's why I
[29:01] put there unconscious unquestionable
[29:04] faith you can that could be a sermon in
[29:07] itself unconscious unquestionable faith
[29:11] actually that would be a very good sign
[29:14] amen hallelujah but faith is unconscious
[29:18] you got faith and don't even know it
[29:19] that's right Jesus Christ no matter if
[29:23] he was in a storm and the gale is
[29:25] knocking at the boat from one side to
[29:27] the other or he was standing in a face
[29:29] admitted demons he was if he was hanging
[29:32] anywhere it never moved him he walked
[29:35] right on just as calm and quiet as could
[29:38] be why because he was the secret place
[29:41] one thing but he was in the secret place
[29:43] it was in that atmosphere he didn't let
[29:46] circumstances because he didn't have
[29:48] complexes he didn't have fears he wasn't
[29:51] scared of anything he knew who he was he
[29:54] believed to what the word said about him
[29:56] the word said I'm listen I believe it
[29:58] hey man he believed that all and
[30:03] therefore nothing could move him
[30:06] nothing could deter him from walking in
[30:09] the vision that the Lord the father had
[30:12] revealed and the word he his life was
[30:15] the scripture revealed and was walking
[30:17] in writing scripture at the same time he
[30:21] stayed in that path its simplicity stay
[30:26] there and walked with all the demons of
[30:28] Hell and everything try to change it the
[30:31] devil offered him all those things and
[30:33] all the Pharisees and all that stuff
[30:35] trying to make him angry because you can
[30:38] imagine how frustrated now there was
[30:41] times where it was actually the will of
[30:42] the father to get angry too but it had
[30:44] to be in the right place and it had to
[30:47] be according to the vision right amen
[30:51] so there is time don't get condemn
[30:53] sometimes you might have a bit of
[30:54] indignation about something so not don't
[31:00] let the Sun go down upon it because you
[31:02] don't want to sleep on an angry spirit
[31:03] you want to sleep angry because it'll
[31:05] start soaking in and make you a more of
[31:07] an angry person because it's it's you
[31:09] you this sounds a bit medical but you're
[31:11] actually when you go to sleep you're
[31:13] transcending from conscious state into
[31:15] unconscious and so if you take that
[31:17] spirit not spirit but that emotion of
[31:20] anger and frustration at something and
[31:21] you sleep on it you're actually taking
[31:24] that into your subconscious and it's
[31:25] stewing around and your dreams and you
[31:27] might end up having all sorts of dreams
[31:28] you know so there's a reason why and
[31:31] that's just me that's what I think right
[31:33] as the reason why is don't let it Sun go
[31:35] down upon it make it right or get get
[31:37] back in the right atmosphere you know
[31:39] stop being angry when you when you go to
[31:41] sleep it's not good you have a fight and
[31:45] then go to sleep that's not good make it
[31:48] right before you go to sleep amen I like
[31:53] that just as calm and quiet as
[31:56] could be why he was simply unconscious
[32:00] of fear or anything around him now he
[32:04] saw it he saw it but he had the maturity
[32:08] he knew the driving force of his life
[32:11] the centerpiece of his life the thrust
[32:13] the the dynamic the will the vision the
[32:20] other stuff that was trying to strike
[32:21] there wasn't the vision
[32:22] it wasn't what he's meant to be doing it
[32:24] wasn't the the motive and the objective
[32:28] of his actions but the father was is but
[32:34] you see now few for us right now
[32:37] if somebody has been not that right and
[32:40] they're unconscious you can yell at them
[32:43] call them names and do whatever you want
[32:44] to they ain't going to do nothing you're
[32:46] unconscious of it you know be just as
[32:49] pious as you can be because you know
[32:52] there's no reaction no consciousness to
[32:55] reason adding it or man or whatever goes
[32:57] on you see now that's one thing but to
[33:03] be awake and to have it and to be
[33:05] experiencing that and to be reasoning at
[33:08] all and all your memories and all of the
[33:09] things that's going on how will you
[33:12] react are you going to choose to be
[33:14] unconscious to those things and not let
[33:17] them affect you and sway you and move
[33:19] you and influence you that's right
[33:22] whether it was going to happen or
[33:24] whether it wasn't going to happen he
[33:25] knowed it was going to happen because
[33:27] God said so he didn't say oh have I
[33:30] prayed through wonder if I fasted long
[33:34] enough wonder if I did this he just walk
[33:37] right on unconscious amen
[33:39] that's right he believed what God said
[33:41] was truth the words must be fulfilled
[33:43] and he knowed what his life was to
[33:46] fulfill them that's right it's a vision
[33:48] had confidence with God real confidence
[33:53] with God and he knew his calling and he
[33:55] made his calling an election sure amen
[33:57] with all diligence amen he knew his
[34:00] gifting he knew what he who he was and
[34:02] you came to all of you at weight young
[34:07] people don't wait don't now
[34:10] find your purpose God will show you if
[34:13] you get serious ask and you're here to
[34:19] fulfill it and you're here to fulfill it
[34:22] to just walk unconscious of fear walk
[34:25] unconscious of criticism will come
[34:28] conscious unto the world walk as you
[34:30] walk in Christ walk with Him not paying
[34:33] any attention the right or the left hand
[34:36] just keep moving on if something comes
[34:39] up in the church what with God
[34:41] hallelujah
[34:42] if sickness strikes you what was God if
[34:45] the neighbor don't like you walk with
[34:47] God just keep on walking with God in
[34:50] that secret place hallelujah don't eat
[34:54] the circumstances that pull you down out
[34:56] of the atmosphere and make you angry and
[34:58] mad and sad and gladden whatever those
[35:00] emotions walk with God walk with God the
[35:04] whole time this is what he's want that
[35:06] he's calling us to this he's calling us
[35:09] come away with me come out of these
[35:11] worldly atmospheres now and what was me
[35:14] he's saying walk about those things
[35:17] you've been invited you've been gone
[35:20] your hearts been drawn out to him amen
[35:23] the Song of Solomon is singing to you
[35:25] saying come away my fear one walk in the
[35:29] garden with me again amen
[35:31] walk hand-in-hand with me we're going to
[35:33] walk into the millennium amen like keep
[35:38] on walking with God if sickness strikes
[35:41] you what was God if the neighbor don't
[35:43] like you and he doesn't like my neighbor
[35:45] doesn't like me for some reason I don't
[35:46] know why what would God just keep on
[35:50] walking with God Enoch one day walk like
[35:53] that you know what he done he walked all
[35:56] the way home with God hallelujah praise
[36:00] His Holy Name Amen
[36:02] these things aren't just pretty sayings
[36:04] man these are reality
[36:06] he's saying this because this is the
[36:08] vision for us you walk with God one day
[36:10] we're going to walk home amen Oh excites
[36:14] me Alleluia
[36:17] God's graces to change our thinking
[36:20] Sarah
[36:22] she had a trouble for so long
[36:26] doubting the word that did God leave her
[36:28] that way no he visited her and he did
[36:33] the discernment of spirit and he
[36:36] discerned her heart and and she doubted
[36:38] and then something changed and he
[36:41] visited her and he changed her thinking
[36:43] so that she could conceive and bring
[36:45] forth the promised son
[36:46] so God if your mind as God will change
[36:48] it God will come in and he will do
[36:51] something for you he can do that thing
[36:53] for you now he can do it for you tonight
[36:55] if you're finding than your mind that
[36:57] things are you're not believing properly
[37:00] God can come and visit you this is your
[37:03] type of visitation God can visit you now
[37:07] hallelujah
[37:08] save Oh Henner she struggled she got
[37:11] ridiculed beau pnina and her sister and
[37:14] you know 60 years she had no baby
[37:17] and it's a very reproachful thing in
[37:19] those days then I have a baby you know
[37:22] people think that you're being judged
[37:23] and all sorts of stuff you have been
[37:25] done something wrong and probably many
[37:28] people did but God was reserving time
[37:30] for Hannah but you see she got into an
[37:32] atmosphere one day hallelujah amen where
[37:35] where she met the high priest him in and
[37:38] he gave her an edict amen hallelujah
[37:40] he spoke a word over her and she
[37:42] believed it and she brought forth a life
[37:44] amen and you see for you hallelujah God
[37:49] can change your mind and he can let you
[37:51] live in an atmosphere where you can
[37:53] impart eternal life because that's
[37:55] exactly what God wants you to do see for
[37:59] you life comes by the man but through
[38:03] the war by the man Christ Jesus and
[38:07] through the church life
[38:10] Alleluia but an atmosphere where that
[38:12] life can come more hallelujah amen let
[38:17] this mind be in you which was also in
[38:18] Christ Jesus
[38:19] Alleluia let it Amen when God spoke this
[38:26] is now this is my writing so I'm just
[38:29] writers wrote this because I just
[38:30] thought of we could just say it like
[38:34] this when God spoke he believed what he
[38:36] it has faith mastered the circumstance
[38:39] of an earth without form and void he had
[38:44] he had a case on his hands he brooded
[38:46] over the earth and it was dark but he
[38:50] spoke and he believed it and he mastered
[38:54] the circumstance the circumstance was
[38:56] darkness and chaos and void and he
[39:00] mastered the circumstance he believed
[39:03] what he said
[39:04] we are God's family under his covenant
[39:08] to come back to this position in the
[39:11] season for full restoration is it too
[39:15] hard to believe that you are coming to
[39:17] this place of perfect faith where
[39:21] nothing physical audible or spiritual
[39:24] can sway or affect you not if it affect
[39:27] you in a negative way in any way is that
[39:32] too hard to believe as that as that
[39:35] impossible yes it's impossible but with
[39:39] God all things are possible
[39:41] amen and if you're in the atmosphere of
[39:43] God walking with God like Enoch then all
[39:48] these things are possible and actually
[39:50] there are inheritance and there are
[39:52] portion and there for us and we're going
[39:54] and we're moving into this this is for
[39:57] us so now as we transition we've got to
[40:01] shift our thinking now and we and we
[40:05] have to have a balance because there's
[40:07] also a balance to this and the balance
[40:11] that gets more and more harder to strike
[40:13] that balance because as you transition
[40:15] eventually we'll just say things and
[40:18] people will all know it's true and
[40:20] people will just think we're absolutely
[40:21] crazy and they probably already do now
[40:23] many people but what we believe in what
[40:25] we say now which way will you lean in
[40:29] your thinking you can reason things away
[40:31] very easily because we are not
[40:33] completely there in that full transition
[40:36] yet just because we may not be
[40:39] experiencing this in its complete stage
[40:41] yet it does not mean that we should
[40:43] explain it away we shouldn't just
[40:46] explain it away and reason to say yes
[40:47] okay I'd better go take my medicine
[40:49] right there's a bell
[40:50] to that we don't just want to tell
[40:51] people to get off their medicine of
[40:53] course because God has to tell someone
[40:55] to do things like their Amen or a
[40:57] prophet see something like that then you
[40:59] can do it but any man just come over in
[41:01] his own enthusiasm and say that then
[41:03] they're stepping on bad ground but you
[41:05] see you've got to be a balance to this
[41:06] but I'm just going to say this but this
[41:08] is a reality now we should not explain
[41:12] it away this is a vision and we master
[41:16] the circumstance of our poorly trained
[41:18] crew the subconscious you see that man
[41:21] that that's without form and void you
[41:23] know when we first become a Christian
[41:25] and there's a lot of poorly trained
[41:27] things and so God over the years and the
[41:29] songs and the testimonies and those
[41:31] preaching and the trials and the
[41:33] hardship and does all then he starts to
[41:35] brood over it so that it starts to
[41:37] become more sound and you can start
[41:40] being the real you amen hallelujah and
[41:45] training it so that it can actually
[41:47] believe hallelujah we will soon see this
[41:49] internal harmony conduit that means to
[41:54] flow the secret place of the Most High
[41:56] and the rest of Psalm 91 will manifest
[41:59] but you see what I mean by that as some
[42:02] 91 says he that dwelleth in the secret
[42:04] place of the Most High shall rest under
[42:06] the shadow of the Almighty
[42:07] and nothing shall befall you no place
[42:10] you'll come nigh thy dwelling you know
[42:12] all of those things no fear you'll never
[42:14] be afraid your identity is sure and all
[42:17] those things will be perfectly killed
[42:19] not and it will come from within you not
[42:23] just from an external miracle to help
[42:26] you but it will come from within you
[42:27] it'll it'll be your experience naturally
[42:31] spiritually and soulfully in all areas
[42:34] of your life Psalm 91 will manifest and
[42:39] the sons of God will be revealed and
[42:41] seeing and you'll experience in your sea
[42:44] uttermost completely so we should not
[42:48] explain the radical away what seems to
[42:54] be radical where we can completely trust
[42:59] and rely on God and not nothing on the
[43:02] natural
[43:03] and and and I'm preaching this rahmanir
[43:05] I'm going for to the extreme right on
[43:07] this and I'll show you later this is the
[43:13] we're still rule just say this to show
[43:15] people that there is no need of being
[43:17] scared the worst thing that people can
[43:19] put up on you is fear if you even had a
[43:22] cancer and didn't fear and believe God
[43:24] would heal you you wouldn't be into bad
[43:26] a shape God take care of that if you
[43:30] were sick whatever it is if you didn't
[43:32] fear so fear is one of the worst things
[43:35] that Satan can place upon the person now
[43:37] this week I've tried to prove by the
[43:39] scripture that the man that's born again
[43:41] of the kingdom of God has nothing to
[43:43] fear
[43:44] you're absolutely safe and secure in
[43:46] Jesus Christ
[43:49] so this overcoming atmospheres Psalm 91
[43:53] 6 this is not Psalm 91 6 but this is
[43:56] actually the promise of some ninety one
[43:58] six and you can read that later but I'm
[44:00] just going to read what happened here it
[44:01] says well one day Paul the Lord told
[44:03] Paul he had to go down and appear before
[44:05] Caesar and got shipwrecked out there and
[44:08] then I'm just cutting a bit of the story
[44:09] out and going straight to this it says
[44:11] so when they got on the shore there was
[44:13] a big storm been on there and the rain
[44:16] cold paul was picking up some sticks and
[44:19] thrown some of the fire and a big
[44:20] dangerous snake grabbed him right
[44:22] through the hand why it never scared
[44:24] Paul you see remember faith says that
[44:30] even if a snake bites you that nothing
[44:33] not even the venom of a snake can hurt
[44:37] you Paul believed that Paul was living
[44:42] in a vision Paul knew his test as his
[44:44] calling in you a god and to do he knew
[44:48] that him dying right there on an island
[44:49] was not part of his ministry not part of
[44:51] his the plan he was in that he was so in
[44:55] tune and in the secret place with God
[44:57] that he knew where he was going because
[45:00] he had angelic visitations he was he was
[45:03] he heard the voice of God he was led by
[45:05] the spirit and he knew where he was gone
[45:06] now if he wasn't in that secret place if
[45:09] he was leading carnal things come in if
[45:11] he was listening to the Roman
[45:13] entertainment of that day do you think
[45:15] he would have had NZ
[45:16] Angelica visitations you think that he
[45:18] would have heard the voice of God do you
[45:19] think he would have known the vision for
[45:21] his life no he probably would not open
[45:23] I'm just assuming that but I believe
[45:25] that he would not have heard those
[45:27] things if he had that atmosphere in his
[45:29] life but because he carried the right
[45:31] atmosphere and he lived and walked in
[45:33] that secret place he could know the
[45:34] vision for his life hallelujah and so
[45:37] when a snake came and bit him and it was
[45:39] a deadly snake he said what are you
[45:40] doing snake get off me hallelujah
[45:42] because he knew he meant that there was
[45:45] promises in the Bible to sort that out
[45:47] hallelujah so he was embodiment of some
[45:51] ninety one hallelujah he embodied some
[45:54] ninety one he dwelled on the secret
[45:56] place of the Most High and he was not
[45:58] hurt by the Beast or whatever it says in
[46:00] Psalm 91 verse six maybe what so you can
[46:05] see the balance Amen the balance they
[46:09] are knowing the vision knowing what God
[46:12] has got for you knowing that these
[46:14] things and walking in a place with God
[46:16] where those things the promises of God
[46:18] the supernatural as reality to you so
[46:22] that you don't fear because the moment
[46:24] you start getting scared and fearful
[46:26] your faith is crippled and whatever
[46:29] their thing is affecting you will come
[46:31] upon you and hurt you and now this
[46:34] brother band eventually takes it a step
[46:35] further and we'll go into it in a minute
[46:37] it's quite interesting and Paul this is
[46:40] why I never scared Paul he looked at it
[46:42] like that and so full of the Holy Ghost
[46:44] his whole inner body just charged was
[46:47] the power of God he looked at it and
[46:48] shook it off in the fire and said I've
[46:50] got to go before Caesar what are you
[46:52] bothering me about like that and went
[46:53] walking on amen it didn't bother him
[46:56] didn't scare him a bit you see Paul was
[47:00] not deterred by the physical see they're
[47:05] physical so you know we've talked about
[47:08] and it and it seems to be easier in our
[47:10] mind to not be deterred by the spiritual
[47:12] demon influences and all that stuff
[47:15] right and fight that off but the same
[47:18] face that fights that offers the same
[47:20] faith that will fight a snake bite off
[47:21] will fight anything off and will give
[47:24] you and will allow you to walk and Psalm
[47:25] 91
[47:29] some 91 verse 3 Peter walking on the
[47:33] water he was walking all right till he
[47:36] seen the waves contrary and he got
[47:37] scared jesus said why did you fear
[47:40] that's what's the matter with the Holy
[47:42] Ghost people today they've got a lot of
[47:45] afraid the devil's just trying to scare
[47:48] you out of something he's trying to put
[47:51] something off somewhere else say some of
[47:54] these days you'll be this now this is
[47:56] what I'm bringing to you tonight you
[47:59] know we we have to own it now you know
[48:02] and then as I said before don't let the
[48:05] circumstances you make you let you
[48:07] reason it away it is now even if the
[48:10] circumstances don't just become
[48:12] conscious of them be unconscious of the
[48:14] circumstances now because what's going
[48:17] to happen is as the Lord unfolds and as
[48:22] the rapture gets closer as the grace
[48:24] becomes stronger and as the Lord
[48:26] descends further and it becomes more
[48:28] fleshed out in you your testimony will
[48:31] make a big difference so your muzzle
[48:33] start it now and testify now and hold
[48:36] the ground now and stand your ground now
[48:38] don't waver as much as it feels like
[48:42] wavering and it's reasonable to waver
[48:43] don't waver cast down reasonings Allu
[48:48] you since here he's The Devil's trying
[48:51] to put something off of somewhere else
[48:55] to say some of these days you'll be this
[48:57] you are now you are now now now now now
[49:04] now now we're the sons of God now we're
[49:07] seated together in heavenly places now
[49:09] we get this we have all powers in heaven
[49:12] and the earth see now we have it not in
[49:17] the Millennium we won't need it then we
[49:20] got it now believe it receive it what
[49:23] can it never testify anything different
[49:26] never think anything different and if
[49:28] any thought ever comes or any
[49:29] inclination to speak anything else ever
[49:32] come never ever allow it cast it down
[49:36] even if the physical circumstances and
[49:39] sicknesses and things in life testify
[49:41] different reject it
[49:43] because that's not your inheritance and
[49:46] very soon my friend
[49:47] there won't be your experience if you
[49:50] stand now hold your ground now be strong
[49:53] and very courageous I think it's like I
[50:01] might not go through these but I ask you
[50:03] the question which way will you lean
[50:07] these three and the categories of my
[50:10] brain right now well what I'm talking
[50:14] about natural tendencies will you lean
[50:20] to the natural or your thoughts and
[50:23] testimony be affected completely by
[50:24] natural events
[50:25] well natural calamity cause you to doubt
[50:28] the Word of God because do you remember
[50:30] what the word said no plank no plane
[50:34] well negative natural events make you
[50:37] fear and worry about your family's
[50:39] future in your own do you turn to the
[50:42] arm of the flesh and calamity but
[50:45] because it's too serious to trust God I
[50:48] ask those Christians you know I'm not
[50:50] going to answer them but just ask him
[50:51] now here is the tendencies of little
[50:54] faith now this is put this gets a bit
[50:56] more closer to home
[50:57] will you stay where many Christians are
[51:00] and a thought I couldn't think of a word
[51:03] but frequency of little faith where you
[51:06] do believe but yet because of fear and
[51:08] reasoning you are still affected by
[51:10] natural circumstances and you
[51:13] double-minded about complete ability for
[51:16] your faith to master every circumstance
[51:18] even the natural circumstances in your
[51:20] life natural things that can happen
[51:23] mistakes and we'll talk about in brother
[51:25] will read a quote soon even the burn of
[51:28] effect on a pen now this one here really
[51:31] like you know it's pretty extreme but
[51:33] we'll just have a look at it and I'll
[51:35] leave you to decide which way you will
[51:38] lean because you know as brother branham
[51:40] friction the jury see you're the jury
[51:42] you make the decision and I'll leave it
[51:45] with you how and when does your little
[51:48] faith become perfect faith and these are
[51:51] questions to ask you because you need to
[51:53] consider that it's something you need
[51:56] in this time of transition an entire way
[52:00] of God's provision and grace is coming
[52:02] upon the church to take her out of this
[52:04] realm to bring her into rapture and
[52:06] grace and rapturing faith and it
[52:08] remember this it's none of it as your
[52:11] own works
[52:11] none of it as your own ability it's all
[52:14] the grace of God it's all the power of
[52:17] God and the power of God he comes and he
[52:20] brings the word and then the power of
[52:22] God when you mix it with faith and you
[52:24] embody and you say Lord yes that's me I
[52:28] want then I'm going to claim it and all
[52:32] those words and all the testimonies and
[52:34] all the confessions that we spoke about
[52:35] on the following the preceding serving
[52:38] it's all by faith none of it's by oh I
[52:41] just confess and it's a work that I do
[52:43] and it's going to change something
[52:44] that's faith it's faith in the power of
[52:47] God that's contained in the Word of God
[52:51] amen
[52:53] which way will you lean other answer is
[52:56] here this is the quote now you know
[52:59] that's the atmosphere you've got to get
[53:01] away from it he's talking about a
[53:02] negative atmosphere you've got to get
[53:04] away from it this is just after he
[53:06] shared about hope and I'm sorry Peter
[53:08] and she had been all flustered and the
[53:09] family had been having troubles and he
[53:11] came in there and he got by the Holy
[53:13] Spirit changed the atmosphere in the
[53:16] house and then he said here after that
[53:20] it's the atmosphere you've got to get
[53:22] away from it that Colonel flustered
[53:24] atmosphere from that old confusion we've
[53:29] got to get away from the old confusion
[53:31] that old reasoning and confusion and
[53:34] complex you know it's complicated faith
[53:38] because really in perfect faith that's
[53:41] very simple it's only the Word of God
[53:43] always and there's no reasoning there's
[53:47] no anything else and really when it
[53:50] comes to its full manifestation even our
[53:52] circumstances will be perfectly
[53:53] everything that we do everything we
[53:55] experience perfect faith all the time
[53:58] and my burden for this to close this
[54:01] series of things is that we stay in an
[54:07] atmosphere
[54:09] and the way we stand atmosphere not that
[54:12] we we can't work ourselves to stand
[54:13] there but God's dealing in our lives to
[54:16] remove fears and frustrations and
[54:18] complex and all those things so that
[54:19] nothing can affect us because we will
[54:21] walk like Enoch we will walk that way
[54:25] and we are walking that way and we're
[54:26] walking into the vision we're in the
[54:28] vision we're transitioning hallelujah so
[54:33] we need to move away from that old
[54:36] confusion I am oh I am going to beat
[54:40] your you're scared he says that well
[54:43] that's what's the matter
[54:44] you'll be frying your meat of a morning
[54:47] for breakfast and the first thing you
[54:49] know you're filled with the Holy Spirit
[54:51] now I'm going to shock you a little bit
[54:53] so you kind of say something that's very
[54:57] extreme especially in those days you
[55:00] don't mind do you all right for instance
[55:04] that meats are frying and all at once
[55:06] the grease pops out on your head now if
[55:09] you'll just shake it off and go on
[55:11] frying meat it wouldn't bother you
[55:13] what's the difference between that and a
[55:15] snake bite venom if your faith can stop
[55:20] venom from killing you which is designed
[55:25] to do then cut your faith also stop
[55:28] grease from burning you you know what I
[55:31] mean so yes it sounds extreme because
[55:34] it's not really you know you just get a
[55:36] little sore and you know that's up goes
[55:39] away but that he's trying to show you
[55:42] something here that something about an
[55:44] atmosphere when you're walking in that
[55:47] place that even a little thing like that
[55:50] doesn't have to affect you it doesn't
[55:53] have to
[55:55] as a challenge now if you now I know you
[56:00] just didn't get that just right look the
[56:02] first thing Oh where's the urgent een I
[56:06] think there must be like some sort of
[56:08] burn remedy something you see grabbed
[56:12] your hand see all it scared you to death
[56:14] that's what does it it's fear because
[56:18] fear cripples faith which way will you
[56:22] lean these are the tendencies of perfect
[56:25] faith will you start to act and think on
[56:27] the frequency of this vision to come to
[56:30] perfect faith where no natural
[56:32] circumstance can affect you whether it's
[56:34] physical or spiritual are you willing to
[56:38] take the challenges that God places
[56:40] before you where he can bring out
[56:42] perfect faith in your life now those
[56:45] might not be easy and they're not easy
[56:46] they're not you'll go through many
[56:48] things to get rid of all of the stuff in
[56:50] your life thank God amen more precious
[56:54] than gold are you willing to be
[56:56] considered strange for the sake of
[56:59] living by faith Jesus is considered a
[57:02] mystic even as disciples didn't even
[57:03] understand rather than natural vision
[57:07] accepting that we are destined to walk
[57:09] on water to master every natural law to
[57:12] where it is completely impossible to
[57:14] explain and to walk completely
[57:16] unconscious of every opposing force
[57:19] seeing the Word of God sweep through all
[57:21] natural reasoning making something out
[57:24] of nothing this is what we believe
[57:27] Saints we believe something out of
[57:30] nothing that's not possible when you
[57:33] look at it naturally but when you look
[57:35] at it through faith all things are
[57:37] possible Alleluia amen
[57:42] I read that already sweet we've guinea
[57:50] done
[57:50] [Music]
[57:53] because thou has made now this is some
[57:56] ninety one nine to sixteen and this is
[57:58] the promise now that you see some the
[58:01] first half of some ninety one as the as
[58:04] he that dwelleth and he this and he that
[58:07] basically singing out the what will
[58:12] happen right now here I believe that God
[58:15] got excited about the sermon he started
[58:17] speaking directly in first person to you
[58:20] right he says because you have made the
[58:23] Lord which is my refuge even the most
[58:25] higher thy habitation there shall no
[58:27] evil before the Sario it comes down a
[58:30] bit later neither shall any plague come
[58:31] nigh thy dwelling for he shall give his
[58:33] angels charge over thee to keep thee in
[58:36] all thy ways all thy ways not some but
[58:40] all they shall bear thee up in their
[58:42] hands lest thou dash thy foot against
[58:44] the stone thou shalt tread upon the lion
[58:46] and adder the young lion and the dragon
[58:48] shalt thou trample under feet and here
[58:51] it is sweet God speaking because he has
[58:53] set his love upon me therefore will I
[58:56] deliver him I will set him on high net
[58:59] word on high is a powerful word which
[59:02] we're going to because he has know in my
[59:04] name he shall call upon me and I will
[59:07] answer him I will be with him in trouble
[59:09] I will deliver him and honor him with
[59:11] long life will i satisfy him and show
[59:13] him my salvation humble yourselves
[59:19] therefore under the mighty hand of God
[59:20] musicians
[59:21] please come on step
[59:30] Cygnet play that song like casting cast
[59:34] all your cares on him all he carries
[59:39] let's just play that
[59:41] so God humble yourselves therefore under
[59:45] the mighty hand of God that he may exalt
[59:47] you in due time casting all your care
[59:51] upon him for he careth for you here be
[59:57] sober be vigilant because your adversary
[1:00:00] the devil as a roaring lion not a royal
[1:00:04] own but he tries to be like one walketh
[1:00:07] about seeking whom he may devour whom
[1:00:10] resist steadfast in the faith that's
[1:00:15] what I said earlier don't give up even
[1:00:18] if it's a small thing the small things
[1:00:21] count the small things count in this
[1:00:25] battle the little things and those
[1:00:28] little things really have a big effect
[1:00:30] when you're resisting the devil
[1:00:32] steadfast in the faith it may be a
[1:00:35] daunting thought to be constantly
[1:00:38] resisting him but it pays off and
[1:00:41] eventually becomes your normal default
[1:00:44] you're retraining that crew downstairs
[1:00:49] resist the devil steadfast in the faith
[1:00:53] knowing that the same afflictions are
[1:00:55] accomplished in your brethren that are
[1:00:57] in the world and this is just an
[1:01:04] exhortation
[1:01:09] for this cause I bow my knees unto the
[1:01:12] father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom
[1:01:14] the whole family in heaven and earth is
[1:01:16] named that he would grant you according
[1:01:19] to the riches of his glory to be
[1:01:21] strengthened with might by his by his
[1:01:25] spirit in the inner man that Christ may
[1:01:28] dwell in your hearts by faith that ye
[1:01:32] being rooted and grounded in love may be
[1:01:35] able to comprehend with All Saints what
[1:01:38] is the breadth and length and depth and
[1:01:41] height and to know the love of Christ
[1:01:43] which passeth knowledge that ye might be
[1:01:46] filled with all the fullness of God amen
[1:01:50] you might be filled with all the
[1:01:53] fullness of God that word filled is to
[1:01:57] make replete to cram to level up a
[1:02:02] hollow to furnish to influence to
[1:02:06] satisfy and here to execute an office
[1:02:12] bring you all that strength all that
[1:02:14] power from God to bring you because in
[1:02:18] you as an office in you as a calling as
[1:02:22] a ministry and in the right atmosphere
[1:02:26] God can the master violinist can pick it
[1:02:30] up and rustle up the boughs of the word
[1:02:32] and start striking your heart and
[1:02:35] causing music to take place and that
[1:02:40] last thing there to coincide with a
[1:02:44] prediction as you walk in that secret
[1:02:51] place your life will coincide with the
[1:02:58] predictions of the Bible amen
[1:03:02] best thing that song cast all your cares
[1:03:04] on him for akhira for you how does it is
[1:03:08] this isn't amen he is our peace amen
[1:03:12] God gave you peace so the root he gave
[1:03:16] you peace it gave it to you not the
[1:03:19] world can give it only the peace he gave
[1:03:21] you and then he said now let not your
[1:03:24] heart be afraid don't allow it
[1:03:28] you've got Dominion you've been given
[1:03:32] dominion over all fears over all those

[1:05:41] anything that pulls you out of the
[1:05:42] atmosphere something's come on your mind

[1:05:47] pulls you out why don't you raise your
