[26:03] everyone Worthy is the
[26:07] L Worthy is the
[26:10] L You Are
[26:14] Holy see it doesn't take much to create
[26:17] an atmosphere you don't always need all
[26:20] the music in the world you don't need
[26:22] instruments to
[26:24] sing sometimes when you're under the
[26:26] biggest attack the simple word worship
[26:28] song would make the devil flee right
[26:30] then amen so if you ever sit with a week
[26:34] and it's just been a rough week and a
[26:35] tough week start singing Because it
[26:38] creates such an atmosphere and God comes
[26:40] down in those moments because really
[26:43] when the worshiper worships we worship
[26:45] God in spirit and in truth amen and
[26:48] there's nothing more in spirit and Truth
[26:50] is when you by yourself and you're
[26:52] worshiping the lord it's great to have
[26:54] everyone don't forget these moments
[26:57] Little Things amen so let's open in the
[27:00] book of Ephesians and we're going to go
[27:02] there chapter
[27:03] 2:1 but I think we'll read there from
[27:06] verse number eight I just been singing
[27:08] this song the whole week and all I can
[27:10] imagine is the Lord just listening to
[27:14] the praise and worship of his Saints and
[27:16] enjoying it amen he's enjoying it you
[27:18] know because he's worthy to be worshiped
[27:20] he enjoys worship he enjoys people being
[27:23] happy and free and sometimes we just get
[27:26] too sad and bogged down hey
[27:30] but we will overcome okay so let's go
[27:33] there to verse 8 chapter 2
[27:36] ver8 for by Grace ye are saved through
[27:40] faith and that not of yourselves it is a
[27:44] gift of God so your salvation is a gift
[27:48] of
[27:49] God he gives it okay not of Works least
[27:55] any man should boast
[27:58] for you for we are his
[28:01] workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto
[28:04] good works which God hath before
[28:07] ordained what we should walk in them
[28:10] amen may the Lord just bless the reading
[28:13] of his word you can have your
[28:16] seats so tonight our my title is love
[28:21] covers a multitude of
[28:23] sin but we must understand what Sin is
[28:26] Sin is unbelief leave but sometimes
[28:30] sinning like if you think I always think
[28:32] that Old Testament man they were rough
[28:34] in those days you know they were lived
[28:36] by the sword Die By The Sword type of
[28:37] things eye for eye tooth for a tooth
[28:39] knee for a knee toe for a toe they were
[28:41] it was very that for that but but
[28:44] sometimes when you sin like like we look
[28:47] at aen and aen took this Babylonian
[28:50] garment and he and the and the bracelet
[28:52] and everything and had in his tent there
[28:53] was sin in the camp and it stopped the
[28:56] whole Commission of Joshua but but
[28:58] because he he went against the word of
[29:00] God but but sometimes sin is not that
[29:03] sometimes it's not a believer in a
[29:05] church actually doing something wrong
[29:07] sometimes it's people making a mistake
[29:10] saying something out of season you know
[29:12] maybe being unwise being like I I know
[29:15] when I preach usually all of you has got
[29:17] the Africans English uh filter on
[29:20] because I might say something in in
[29:22] English but I meant it another way on
[29:25] Africans and you all understand because
[29:27] you know the heart of the person
[29:29] speaking you know that there's no G
[29:32] within me there's no fight I have to
[29:34] pick with anyone so when I do make a
[29:36] mistake it's easy to go he just made a
[29:38] mistake I'm talking about that love I'm
[29:41] talking about there was one day I was
[29:43] song leading and and I sang and I was
[29:46] walking off and I tell this to everyone
[29:47] but it was true and and I walked all the
[29:50] way back to my seat and and a brother of
[29:53] the church he just said you sound real
[29:56] bad and I was like
[29:58] hey and I'm like okay and I walked on
[30:01] but he might have not thought it he
[30:04] might have just been in a somewhere else
[30:06] and he and he said it but how did I take
[30:09] it are we that easily
[30:12] offended that I should now all of a
[30:14] sudden put a steak in the ground and go
[30:16] I don't talk to that one anymore you
[30:18] know he's not as spiritual as he was
[30:20] because if he was spiritual and he was
[30:21] walking with God he wouldn't say such
[30:23] things see what happens when you do
[30:24] those things that's sin that's that's
[30:27] something that's just been said and it's
[30:28] it's the sin that blood covers the Lord
[30:31] he died for us on on Calvary that sin
[30:33] covers all those things those little
[30:34] mistakes knowing or unknowing it just
[30:36] covers it it's it's not even to be
[30:38] considered why are we considering
[30:40] it so so these things in a in a camp
[30:43] that we all might think is sin but can
[30:46] your Love cover that
[30:51] sin that that's my sermon in a bottle
[30:53] can can you overlook sin I'm not saying
[30:56] agree with it I'm not saying be a
[30:58] partaker but we were we were eating in
[31:01] the church here when we just started
[31:03] because the sermons was 3 hours long or
[31:05] that's how it felt for
[31:08] me brother V it wasn't
[31:11] you it was Brother Andy but we were
[31:14] eating a church okay and uh and and we
[31:18] we were always eating a church because
[31:20] what happened is Chantel and I we we so
[31:22] wanted to to enter in and get fed
[31:26] because we we didn't have food for for a
[31:28] while we were in dead churches that that
[31:30] preached religions and and doctrines and
[31:32] opinions and all those things we we just
[31:34] needed food so we didn't care what the
[31:36] kids were doing I hope you all
[31:38] understand now this is me talking to you
[31:41] as a brother this is not an official hey
[31:43] y me out service this is this is life so
[31:47] all I wanted to do is eat I needed to
[31:49] get fed my my soul was hungering for God
[31:53] I didn't care what the kids were doing
[31:54] not that I don't care about my kids I
[31:56] just wanted them to keep quiet
[31:58] and I would stuff food in their mouth in
[32:00] service just to keep them quiet no I'm
[32:02] not saying it's right just hear me out
[32:05] to keep them quiet so I could just enter
[32:07] in because my focus was I want more of
[32:10] that food so if I give them this food
[32:12] we're good while the brother and sister
[32:15] in front of the church did not think so
[32:17] so when we offered their kids food we
[32:19] got that look they were're like uh we
[32:22] maybe should have do this but before
[32:24] then we didn't care because all we
[32:26] wanted was more of God am but see their
[32:29] love did Cover a multitude of sin
[32:31] because they didn't come to us and say
[32:33] okay now brother let me tell you you
[32:34] don't eat in the sanctuary of God and
[32:37] they just left it they they stood for
[32:38] what they believed in they did not agree
[32:41] with it but they didn't come to us and
[32:43] then pick a fight about it so can Your
[32:46] Love cover a multitude of
[32:48] sin so which brings us to the next verse
[32:51] in Romans 2 and now Isaac brother Isaac
[32:54] had Romans 1:8 and he did it in man the
[32:57] amount of work you put into that sermon
[32:59] God bless you I I I was trying to
[33:03] comprehend how you did it it's it's I
[33:05] can't so God bless you may the Lord
[33:08] richly bless you for that service it it
[33:09] meant a lot to me on the 13th of this
[33:12] month I already had this scripture and I
[33:14] wanted to talk about it but when you did
[33:16] the whole book of Roman or 1 to8 I was
[33:19] like man I'm done I can't do anything
[33:20] right now you summed it up all so I'll
[33:22] talk about something different another
[33:25] angle but Romans 2
[33:28] and you all can turn there because I
[33:29] like to if you have your Bibles get your
[33:31] swords out we're
[33:33] fighting so remember tonight you can
[33:35] decide which one wins is which one pull
[33:37] harder right I always will tell you
[33:39] there's a line between you and Satan and
[33:42] the Lake of Fire right in the middle so
[33:45] if you really want to get him in the
[33:47] Lake of Fire just start pulling I
[33:49] promise you that's what you're going to
[33:51] have to do just dig in your heels
[33:53] tonight and pull a bit it says Thou Art
[33:55] inexcusable oh man whoo whoever thou art
[33:58] that
[33:59] judges he says for wherein thou judges
[34:03] another thou condemn thyself for thou
[34:06] that judges does the same thing so
[34:09] remember this is not just judging this
[34:11] is not righteous judgment this is not
[34:13] saying I'm going to stick with a word
[34:14] and not do this this is people that's
[34:16] doing the same but finding fault with
[34:19] other people doing it believe it or not
[34:22] it happens even in shakina oh yeah I'm
[34:26] just saying it happens Happ s because
[34:29] the thing we have to realize here is is
[34:31] Jesus wants us to to to and a spul
[34:35] writing but I jesus just wants us to
[34:37] love people with his love because when
[34:40] we went just back remember he gift his
[34:42] gift of Salvation is a gift from him who
[34:44] are we to take it away and it doesn't
[34:47] matter how long that Christian is going
[34:49] to get there we just have to bear with
[34:52] them pray with them and and when God
[34:54] reveals and does the work then it's a
[34:56] finished work when you try to intervene
[34:59] and and put them right back in the
[35:01] middle of the path you actually put them
[35:02] back in the in the in the ditch so we
[35:05] have to be careful when we speak about
[35:07] things and get offended about things
[35:09] because those things could actually
[35:11] cause waves real bad waves and and those
[35:14] waves take longer to heal those scars
[35:16] take longer to heal because the the
[35:18] scars that takes the longest to heal is
[35:20] the ones that your brothers and sisters
[35:21] give you I expect the world not to like
[35:24] me they don't like Jesus
[35:28] they didn't they rejected him the
[35:30] religious realm rejected him but we
[35:33] cannot reject one another we go on it
[35:36] says but we are sure that the Judgment
[35:39] of God is according to the truth against
[35:42] them which commit of such things so
[35:44] who's doing the judging here the word so
[35:48] if they don't line up with the word we
[35:50] say Lord the word should sort them out
[35:52] what is the best thing to do say Lord
[35:55] for in the beginning was the word the
[35:57] word was with with God and the Word was
[35:58] God so he's the word Lord send your word
[36:01] their way and put them back on the path
[36:03] amen that's the heart of a Christian not
[36:06] Lord let me just get my sleeves all
[36:08] right up and climb in there and just go
[36:10] you know well let the Lord do the work
[36:12] it is his work and he's able to do it
[36:15] okay and thinkest thou oh man that
[36:18] judges them and which do such things and
[36:21] does the same that thou shalt escape the
[36:23] Judgment of God so now God talks to us
[36:28] and say if you be quick with firing with
[36:30] your mouth firing with your temper
[36:33] firing with everything you have don't
[36:34] you know that that same measure you meet
[36:37] or you you you throw out you'll be met
[36:39] again it's the law of of Newton's law
[36:42] third law is for every action is the
[36:44] equal but opposite reaction so guess
[36:46] what kids I always use the example but
[36:48] this is a great example you put a soccer
[36:50] ball against here okay there's the wall
[36:54] the harder you Wallop it guess what the
[36:57] quicker it comes back so if you kick it
[37:00] soft you can catch it if you kick it
[37:03] hard it's going to knock you on the nose
[37:05] and it's going to
[37:06] bleed and I've got a big nose so it's
[37:08] going to bleed the nose the nozle okay
[37:11] so and this is for your kids to remember
[37:13] so if you look at another child and they
[37:16] don't walk exactly like you walk keep
[37:22] quiet don't spread rumors yeah don't
[37:25] don't say bad things I'm talking to the
[37:27] kids today grown-ups as well we're all
[37:30] children there's no there's God is not a
[37:33] Granddad so I hope you all feel like
[37:35] children today amen take a p La we all
[37:37] take a p La
[37:39] amen so when you talk bad about
[37:41] something what happens then is you add a
[37:43] filter to them so let's say um I love
[37:47] using Davy as an example okay so I say
[37:50] Davey is a
[37:52] bully so I come to you two and I go hey
[37:54] girls you know what what Davy is a bully
[37:57] he bullies people he's like he's right
[38:00] up and Bully and he takes your lunch
[38:02] money so now you have never ever in your
[38:05] life met Davey right you don't even know
[38:09] what's his surname okay so just believe
[38:11] you don't know Davey okay go work with
[38:14] me so what's the first thing when Davy
[38:16] stand up Davey I'm going to use the
[38:17] example Davy comes towards you and goes
[38:20] hi what do you think you oh he's going
[38:23] to bully me so now before Davey could
[38:26] even express who dve is you already got
[38:29] a falter and a veil over him that he's a
[38:31] bully so now he goes oh what are you
[38:34] having for lunch oh a see what I mean so
[38:39] so so do you want to take my lunch he
[38:41] goes no I just was curious cuz I'm
[38:42] hungry oh oh cuz now you're looking at
[38:46] Davey through the filter but see I
[38:49] spread the rumor how do you know it's
[38:51] true because I'm your friend how do you
[38:55] know it's true this man all he want
[38:57] wanted to know is he loves food and he
[38:59] just wanted to know what you're eating
[39:00] you go ah we're eating KFC sweet I love
[39:02] it awesome and there he goes thank you
[39:04] Davey I'll bully you later okay but now
[39:07] what happens is because you put a filter
[39:09] over him because you put a veil over him
[39:12] and now you spread that everybody else
[39:14] thinks he's a bully but see Davy is not
[39:16] aware of it so Davey goes now to brother
[39:19] um Colin and he goes hey brother Colin
[39:21] brother Colin goes hey what are you
[39:24] doing because now all of a sudden the
[39:26] word came to brother Colin and now that
[39:28] falter is following everywhere yeah and
[39:30] now rumors spread and the influence of
[39:33] David being a Son of God and just loves
[39:36] food and me being a liar and telling you
[39:39] that what happened now it it's kicking
[39:41] him out of his Blessing to you yeah you
[39:44] just cut him off as a blessing because
[39:47] you're now judges but you're doing the
[39:49] same thing because you took a word of a
[39:52] man over the word of God and you're now
[39:54] telling him he's a bully but you never
[39:56] went to God and say Lord
[39:58] just show me what's going on with Davy
[40:01] is he really a bully right now that's in
[40:04] the simplest of form there is now let's
[40:06] take it into the religious
[40:09] realm there's people that came to us and
[40:11] say you're in a
[40:13] cult chel was hitting it in the car
[40:16] thought I'm going to get a fox lot
[40:18] tonight before they met me before they
[40:21] made Christ in me I'm in a cult so no
[40:24] matter what's coming out of my mouth
[40:26] next I'm against women I hate them
[40:30] they're all out of line they all should
[40:32] be giving up a SL blah blah blah cuz
[40:34] that's what brother Brandon preach blah
[40:36] blah blah blah and they all have this
[40:37] preconceived idea what this message is
[40:39] all about but they haven't met the
[40:42] person of Jesus Christ which this
[40:44] message is introducing amen so now I'm
[40:46] already a veil over me so the blessing I
[40:48] could be for them is
[40:51] gone but it's in the message realm
[40:54] because brother Armand always talks
[40:56] about bad things and always fights about
[40:58] this and always against who says that
[41:00] I'm just preaching the word amen but
[41:03] some man's opinion told you that I say
[41:05] this way or brother Ben he's always just
[41:07] the liberal everything's just fine that
[41:10] is I heard
[41:11] it but what if he says I like God doing
[41:14] the work I'm here to assist this is
[41:16] healing this is a place where we heal
[41:18] but because you now put a filter over me
[41:21] you cut the blessing that God wants to
[41:23] give you through a man because God
[41:25] always worked through man he ain't going
[41:27] to change his plan he works through us
[41:31] and even you praying for someone on the
[41:33] other side of South Africa or sending
[41:34] them a text like brother eat this week
[41:36] and say bro we're praying for you you'll
[41:38] never know how much it matters but if he
[41:41] took it from oh a guy in a cult is
[41:43] praying from you blessing cut
[41:46] off is that true so shouldn't we be more
[41:50] wey of what's coming out of this yeah
[41:53] because remember this worships God and
[41:56] it can always Curse God because if you
[41:59] say a Believer is anything that God is
[42:02] making him is anything contrary to what
[42:04] God is busy doing in his life you're
[42:06] against the word you're Antichrist
[42:09] because Christ is living within him
[42:11] Christ is doing a great work within him
[42:13] and you are spreading rumors and lies so
[42:15] you cutting off Christ the blessing of
[42:18] other people you're against the word
[42:21] don't ever do that that's very dangerous
[42:23] so before we run our mouths before we do
[42:26] things like this we have to first go
[42:27] Lord I don't understand that sister I
[42:30] don't understand that brother please can
[42:32] you show me you will go much further
[42:35] with your walk amen then just stay there
[42:38] so I've got I've got a little bit of a
[42:40] example um and I'll I'll I'll I'll say
[42:44] this one here's brother brandom says
[42:46] this he says now see there is no need
[42:48] for fighting God takes care of all
[42:52] things you see don't you do it just love
[42:56] return good for Ev
[42:58] all the time am some of the time all the
[43:02] time so give the benefit of the doubt
[43:04] all the time don't have a right you sold
[43:08] out your right to get offended to get
[43:09] angry to get muggy to you sold that out
[43:12] that's gone sorry Christ is now living
[43:16] so now it goes all the time so if he
[43:18] annoys me all the time if he offends me
[43:22] all the time remember these words we
[43:24] have no reason to do it otherwise MH
[43:28] this is the prophet of God When anybody
[43:29] speaks good about you well be thankful
[43:33] if anybody speaks bad about you bless
[43:35] them anyhow sure that's right let God
[43:39] take care of the rest he is the one is
[43:41] that right he is the one so after all
[43:45] we've got to answer to him yeah so as
[43:48] long as you know that you don't have to
[43:50] take it upon you to do the work for God
[43:53] that God can use you sometimes in the
[43:55] most quietest time to speak one word
[43:57] word yeah that would break an anointing
[43:59] or a stronghold on someone that the evil
[44:02] the enemy has put on them you can just
[44:04] say one word and season that can just
[44:06] break that whole thing open and they can
[44:08] meet God but rather speak good than get
[44:13] evil because remember the way you
[44:16] measure others the way you'll be
[44:19] measured before him so if there's
[44:21] anything like that that is there going
[44:23] on clear it right now clear it with God
[44:25] get that stricken off move on we don't
[44:28] have time for these things this is
[44:30] little Shenanigans we should be way past
[44:32] this
[44:32] already so here we
[44:36] go man I'm thirsty should drink more
[44:39] water uh Deuteronomy 31 and it's verse 8
[44:42] I'll just read it for you and the Lord
[44:45] he is that he is that doeth good before
[44:50] thee he will be with thee he will not
[44:53] fail thee nor forsake thee fear not
[44:56] neither be the this made the reason I
[44:58] put this in there is God will go before
[45:01] you in everything you do amen if you let
[45:05] him the the the murmuring Israelites
[45:09] came up to a lot of resistance because
[45:11] of murmuring and forgetting what God
[45:13] just done and God was leading them all
[45:16] that 40 years through the Wilderness to
[45:18] Humble them believe it or not to get
[45:21] them humbled because he said did your
[45:23] clothes get old did your shoes we it did
[45:26] you never have food that I feed you that
[45:28] I sustain you that I take care of you
[45:30] but because you chose for the hardening
[45:33] of your heart to walk another way you
[45:35] had to walk just a little bit further
[45:37] wasn't my choosing we should have gone
[45:39] straight into the promised land
[45:40] rejoicing but because you chose the
[45:43] harder Road you just had young people I
[45:45] want you to understand because you
[45:47] choose the harder way you're going to
[45:50] have to walk further and it's going to
[45:52] hurt because every day in the wilderness
[45:55] was not a party they didn't have what we
[45:57] have a shower on tap KFC at your front
[46:00] door they didn't have the luxurious bed
[46:02] that you have they had to have 40 years
[46:05] in a desert sand blowing man have who's
[46:09] been to the beach sand gets in
[46:11] everywhere I just open the back of my
[46:13] car to fix something thank you brother
[46:15] Matt for helping me with that and when
[46:17] we asked James James how much sand was
[46:19] in the back of the car I had the ocean
[46:21] in there and it's a couple of trips and
[46:24] it's under the sand and it's everywhere
[46:25] for 40 years these these guys being in
[46:28] sand dry sand and the wind blows and
[46:31] it's and it's like oh and they R the
[46:33] eyes
[46:34] and and they look at like okay okay it's
[46:37] better oh my teeth where's the water
[46:41] Moses where's the morar where why
[46:43] where's the mortar we need some water
[46:46] huh 40
[46:47] years but you know what they did it to
[46:50] themselves yeah because God said you can
[46:52] have the promised land just walk my way
[46:55] and they're like nope we're going this
[46:57] way and God was leading them to get them
[47:00] humble but guess what they just could
[47:01] not get humble there was just two that
[47:05] just God said let's do it and they like
[47:07] Joshua Caleb commission This Is Us amen
[47:10] so Rapture is yours how's it going to
[47:12] happen it's mine I don't I don't worry
[47:14] about logistics that's for God to sort
[47:16] out I'm just going to walk and guess
[47:18] what I'm going to defy gravity I'll
[47:20] break that law like
[47:22] completely no falling out of trees here
[47:25] I'm walking up but that's what I'm
[47:27] trying to tell you is like there's so
[47:28] much more to worry about than to murmur
[47:31] backbite get offended this is little
[47:33] things this is childish things we should
[47:35] be way past this by now this shouldn't
[47:37] even come over a Pulpit shouldn't
[47:40] shouldn't so there's three and I went
[47:43] into construction mode when I was busy
[47:45] with this and this is a Believer so
[47:46] there's three types of construction that
[47:48] I know about remember this is not all
[47:50] these seaps of it so there's residential
[47:52] construction so residential construction
[47:55] means and we're going to type it with a
[47:57] believer I'm a Christian okay I want to
[48:01] meet the Lord so I'm going to go and say
[48:04] Lord I need to change I came to a place
[48:07] where I looked at my house and it's run
[48:09] down I made so many mistake my grass
[48:12] doesn't want to grow anymore my driveway
[48:14] is all broken up my ceiling Ben you'll
[48:16] know all about this my my roof struts or
[48:19] whatever they call is all sagging
[48:21] everything's just looking bad I'm worse
[48:23] for where because when I was working in
[48:26] Walking in the World walking in sin I
[48:29] did some damage to my
[48:31] house my temple I did some damage
[48:34] brother K we did some damage some of
[48:37] that damage is not easily
[48:40] reversible so depends on how much damage
[48:43] you do is how much God's work is going
[48:44] to put into your life to correct that
[48:46] damage it's a construction site every
[48:49] believer is a construction site and you
[48:52] might be in three different stages of
[48:54] your construction with God so the first
[48:56] one is residential residential affects
[48:58] your house maybe a little bit of your
[49:01] neighbors but mostly your house you know
[49:04] brother Ben comes in and he and he has a
[49:06] look at your house and he goes okay we
[49:08] need Sills here new door we need that
[49:10] little bit of ground your drainage pipes
[49:12] oh they look all right but we can get
[49:14] someone to look at that but it's mostly
[49:16] only your residential you definitely you
[49:19] do need what do we call it
[49:22] um uh what do you call that that you're
[49:25] going to put on your your house deck you
[49:28] need a nice deck you do need that so
[49:31] that's all cool so that is just
[49:33] residential so I stay here don't worry
[49:35] phones rang a million times it's just a
[49:37] phone we all hear them every day so what
[49:40] happens is residential is when God is
[49:42] actually dealing with you as a Believer
[49:44] but only you so other people might not
[49:46] even know what's going on but he's
[49:48] actually getting you to say hey this is
[49:50] the way this is which way you should
[49:51] walk and hey I want that little
[49:54] besetting sin I want that sorted out
[49:56] that that lying that that very temporal
[50:00] things you know it mostly to do with
[50:01] getting around in this SC carinal realm
[50:04] you know cuz you got the five senses
[50:06] taste see and smell and everything and
[50:08] then you got affection and reasoning and
[50:09] all those conscience and that so God's
[50:11] dealing with that he's just he just
[50:13] wants you to know that hey if you accept
[50:15] me I can help you not lie yeah that's
[50:18] residential that's easy but the second
[50:21] one is a little bit more it is they call
[50:23] it commercial so when it comes to the
[50:26] commercial SE uh sector there's more to
[50:29] play there's buildings there's highrises
[50:32] it's a deeper Foundation it's harder
[50:34] work you actually get an engineer in
[50:36] there as well you need to have the
[50:38] people that put up construction sites
[50:39] and commercial buildings it's serious
[50:42] work so that's
[50:44] strongholds that's besetting sin that's
[50:46] things that you can't get rid of it goes
[50:48] a little bit deeper you know God is
[50:50] going to have to clean out more in your
[50:52] own area it's going to hurt but see now
[50:54] I'm talking about the believer God's not
[50:56] bus he dealing with someone on a
[50:59] residential level but he's dealing with
[51:01] Davy on a commercial level very deeper
[51:04] but we don't know what's going on but it
[51:06] is affecting us right because he's
[51:08] coming to church and we know that God's
[51:10] busy dealing with this guy because he
[51:11] can see it when you do commercial
[51:14] everybody knows there's Road cones for
[51:16] Africa they just show up and they make
[51:17] babies and more babies and more babies
[51:19] and before you see there's a gazillion
[51:21] million of them on the street you know
[51:23] something's going on and there's big
[51:25] there's big uh what you call it cranes
[51:27] and these trucks coming in out you so on
[51:29] a Believer when you look at it you can
[51:31] see listen this guy's going through
[51:33] turmoil this guy's being tested man he's
[51:36] going through the
[51:37] ringer but you can see it as a Believer
[51:40] but what are we doing about
[51:42] it are we just are we those guys that
[51:45] just stand there and look at the
[51:46] construction side and go or do we go
[51:49] Lord he needs help amen I'm going to
[51:52] pray with him yeah I'm going to pray for
[51:54] him every morning I wake up I'm going to
[51:56] be on his side if he turns back guess
[51:59] what I'm going to stand next to him go
[52:00] you're all right he says I need this he
[52:02] go yep yep I I want you to eat my soup
[52:06] I'll even eat the soup oh my it's going
[52:08] to be hard but I'll do it I'll do
[52:10] whatever it takes so I can get that guy
[52:14] to get through that trial because God's
[52:16] busy working a deep work with him but
[52:18] see there might be only two or three or
[52:20] four realize that cuz it is a commercial
[52:22] site so mostly the people in that
[52:24] neighborhood are now and again someone
[52:26] pasting will know about that but then
[52:29] you get a different one then you get
[52:30] like the Civil heavy civil construction
[52:33] this is like this Marina that they the
[52:35] walkway that they're building here tiun
[52:38] or whatever walkway everybody knows
[52:41] what's going
[52:42] on this is like kids acting out this is
[52:46] like parents throwing baby Tantrums in
[52:48] church and stuff like that things that
[52:50] you can see it's boiling over God is
[52:52] busy and they and they come forward and
[52:54] they go for prayer and they so and you
[52:56] can see everybody knows what's going
[52:59] on but it's a deep work and it's a very
[53:02] personal work so we look at that
[53:05] situation and we just think man they're
[53:08] really going now through the ringer that
[53:09] brother is going through ringer but it's
[53:11] affecting the mom the dad the sister the
[53:13] nephew the cousin the far removed
[53:15] everyone else it is just a bomb the
[53:17] whole family it's just a it's heavy
[53:19] construction because God might deal with
[53:22] him but he's getting the whole family in
[53:24] on it because he wants to deal with the
[53:25] whole family as well
[53:26] right but how are we looking at it is
[53:29] just him acting out or is it God getting
[53:31] the family in such a place that he can
[53:33] work with the family you need more love
[53:35] you need more joy you need more
[53:37] Temperance you need more understanding
[53:39] you need more forgiving God's busy
[53:40] dealing with everyone in the family but
[53:42] it looks like it's just one and we all
[53:45] go
[53:46] mhm he's just acting out God's Building
[53:50] character for the mom the dad the
[53:53] brother the sister the nephew the cousin
[53:56] the the family in the church he's
[53:58] actually working with all of us and it's
[54:00] a deep construction but he wants all of
[54:02] us to get to a certain place cuz when
[54:04] you look with civil construction is
[54:06] where they actually get in and they it's
[54:08] the road layout it's the it's the um
[54:10] under the ground above the ground
[54:13] whatever is on top it's everything
[54:15] around that area is getting built and
[54:18] and you don't recognize it until they
[54:19] start building and it looks like a
[54:21] landmine just exploded it looks that
[54:23] that family is completely off the rails
[54:26] it looks like a job type of thing man
[54:28] you're sitting on an as sheep scratching
[54:30] your boils it looks horrible and we all
[54:32] standing
[54:33] [Music]
[54:34] go have you
[54:36] seen have have you heard oh and this is
[54:40] what I don't like we should pray for
[54:42] them because little Jimmy just did this
[54:44] and this and this and we should pray I
[54:46] Don't Care What Jimmy did sorry
[54:50] Jimmy all I want to know is should I
[54:52] pray for Jimmy my focus is do does he
[54:56] need up is he is should I pull my sword
[54:59] which devil goes down where where do you
[55:01] want me they go oh we should cover the
[55:04] left let's go to the left is that left
[55:05] yeah that's left okay which come the
[55:07] next on no no go to the right okay we're
[55:09] going to the right he's going this way
[55:10] let's pray against this because my focus
[55:12] is I want him there but the moment I
[55:15] start turning to Friendly Fire the enem
[55:17] is that way you Ain finding the wrong
[55:21] side you need to fight that way so
[55:24] sometimes somebody just needs to go AR
[55:26] it's that way yeah okay yeah we go again
[55:28] cuz we all want to fight but we're
[55:30] heading the wrong way you should never
[55:33] do Friendly Fire amen never when that
[55:36] thought comes in reject it straight away
[55:38] it's real bad okay I went way past what
[55:41] I wanted to
[55:42] say but we'll we'll give you homework
[55:45] Romans
[55:46] 12 and then I'll close with this because
[55:49] the the what I want you to realize is
[55:53] God sent all of us as backup
[55:56] he send us his
[55:58] backup and if one hurts we all should
[56:01] hurt if one Grieves we all should grieve
[56:04] am if one Rejoice we Rejoice with them
[56:07] even if I don't feel like rejoicing
[56:09] guess what I is rejoicing with you am
[56:12] because for me my purpose is to see you
[56:14] all in the Rapture and and let's say
[56:18] this thing that I do not like hearing at
[56:19] all never say
[56:21] this never say this not everyone in the
[56:25] church is believer
[56:28] you know brother brandom said make
[56:29] believer real believer unbeliever hold
[56:32] on let me tell you something you're all
[56:34] going to heaven and you all are my
[56:37] family amen so I don't believe anybody
[56:40] in this church anybody on this church is
[56:43] staying behind amen because if I do
[56:46] believe that it's okay for me to see you
[56:49] go through the tribulation and it's not
[56:51] amen it's okay for me to see you get the
[56:54] worst time of your life in hell
[56:57] it's not brother brandham says even if
[57:01] Stalin which killed so many Jews was
[57:04] going to go to hell he'll still pray for
[57:06] that
[57:07] Soul though he deserves it he'll still
[57:10] pray for that Soul because he doesn't
[57:12] want one to go that way so don't ever
[57:15] say some of the people in the church is
[57:17] Believers and some are make Believers
[57:19] and some are real because guess what
[57:20] then you're doubting Who's Got Your
[57:22] Flank yeah you're doubting who's got
[57:25] your back so who are you doing you're
[57:26] fighting here hit hit hit a sword comes
[57:28] you're like who's behind me who's going
[57:30] to help me your head's off you you'll
[57:33] get M you'll get injured you get wounded
[57:36] you'll you'll die on the battlefield
[57:38] you'll spiritually go
[57:40] numb yeah all I need to know is where do
[57:45] I fight who needs me which devil's head
[57:49] is coming off because we fight Devils
[57:52] strongholds principalities powers of
[57:55] Darkness
[57:56] not human beings
[57:58] amen Spirits never die they manifest and
[58:02] there might be a season on one and jump
[58:04] to another one or try to jump to another
[58:06] one as long as you can see the spirit
[58:08] operating we can cut its head
[58:10] off just send prayer their way amen okay
[58:14] so Romans 12 um and we go to verse 9 it
[58:17] says let love be without the simulation
[58:22] abore that which is evil cleave to that
[58:25] which is good be kind and affection
[58:27] affectionate one to another with
[58:29] brotherly love and honor preferring one
[58:33] another you know what true honor is true
[58:36] honor is what what you have for someone
[58:39] you push you don't put them on a ped St
[58:42] it means when you said something you do
[58:44] it when they ask you to help even if
[58:47] it's hurts and your time is not there
[58:49] and you can in your ability even if it's
[58:51] half a ability you go do
[58:53] it honor is to place someone above your
[58:57] own needs and
[58:58] wants if you want to be a great man make
[59:01] other people feel great amen if you want
[59:03] to have friends be friendly yes if you
[59:06] want to overcome treat them as a
[59:08] Overcomer it is it is is not six steps
[59:11] or seven steps to being a good Christian
[59:13] it's one step Christ see and I'll close
[59:17] this about go read the rest go read till
[59:19] Verse 18 at home that's your homework
[59:20] for tonight before you go to bed go read
[59:23] it I want to finish with one thought
[59:25] then brother Ben can come up before we
[59:26] pray if Christ would have been
[59:29] offended when they gave him the first
[59:34] stripe it was for your healing if Christ
[59:37] would have been offended when they
[59:39] ripped out his beard it was his
[59:43] chastisement all our iniquities went on
[59:46] him all our sin he
[59:49] carried every drop of blood was for us
[59:52] he stood there in the garden and Peter
[59:54] grabbed the sword and ch chopped the ear
[59:56] of him what did he say don't you think I
[59:57] can call Legions of angels right now and
[1:00:00] change this scene amen he knew who he
[1:00:02] was didn't get offended he's hanging on
[1:00:05] the cross and he says father forgives
[1:00:07] them they know what they do because I
[1:00:09] have to Blind them so that I can get a
[1:00:11] bride if he got offended he could have
[1:00:14] just easily go you know what I had
[1:00:15] enough yeah just let's finish this
[1:00:18] Hellfire and brimstone could have rained
[1:00:20] that very same day wouldn't affected him
[1:00:23] at all but he didn't
[1:00:27] you know he he went to back to his house
[1:00:29] and he's doing Miracles and he wants to
[1:00:32] go and and spread the gospel and talk to
[1:00:34] him about it and they reject him because
[1:00:36] he's a carpent and son do you not feel
[1:00:39] that he comes to his own and a very
[1:00:41] personal own brothers sisters everybody
[1:00:43] family he gives them this this love and
[1:00:46] and and they just don't believe him they
[1:00:48] reject him yeah so if your brother and
[1:00:51] sister rejects you what should you
[1:00:54] do even immediate family don't agree
[1:00:56] with you what should you do love them
[1:00:59] anyways don't don't hold resentment when
[1:01:02] he walked up to the cross and he was so
[1:01:04] he was so burdened so heavy you were on
[1:01:07] his mind am see even if you were in the
[1:01:10] darkest viess place before you met him
[1:01:14] and you totally offended him with
[1:01:16] everything that you've done he still
[1:01:18] loved
[1:01:20] you he still made an appointment to come
[1:01:22] a knock on your door the day you said
[1:01:25] Lord I'm ready
[1:01:26] he was calling you all along but you
[1:01:28] just didn't realize that he was all he's
[1:01:30] doing is every service you young people
[1:01:34] every service he's knocking on your door
[1:01:37] he's just saying I want to St with you I
[1:01:38] want to come and change your
[1:01:43] life he doesn't get offended when you go
