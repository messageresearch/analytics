[31:45] you have no right to try to cause the
[31:47] vision you have no right in this whole
[31:49] plan
[31:50] it is not yours you don't even have a
[31:52] say in it

[32:22] amen amen hallelujah church
[32:26] it is wednesday evening amen and we came
[32:29] to fellowship with god
[32:32] okay it must be emotional because he is
[32:35] an emotional god
[32:37] okay you can't tell me when jesus christ
[32:39] was walking to the cross
[32:41] that he didn't have emotion in him you
[32:43] can't tell me when god was lying on the
[32:45] cross saying it was finished there was
[32:47] no emotion in him
[32:48] he saw all of us you're not here this is
[32:51] no mistake
[32:52] so let's just set the playing field
[32:54] right if there's anything
[32:56] that is in hindering you tonight throw
[32:58] it away
[32:59] entering there's more important things
[33:02] on this earth
[33:04] more important things than our everyday
[33:06] worries
[33:07] there's more important things than
[33:09] tomorrow there is now
[33:12] it's the i am the very present god not
[33:15] the tomorrow
[33:17] sorry i get excited because i thought
[33:20] when we went through easter i thought
[33:21] man that was it you know we
[33:24] but i can't cry anymore i was standing
[33:27] here we were doing the sacrifice
[33:29] and for the first time in my life i
[33:31] could see ben
[33:32] break him i could see the lord jesus
[33:35] christ being broken for me
[33:38] i never had that before it does
[33:40] something to a grown man to see another
[33:42] man
[33:43] that was innocent die for me
[33:47] which don't even deserve it if you knew
[33:50] where i came from if you knew my
[33:52] life you would say you did not deserve
[33:55] that
[33:56] but yet yes yet he did it for us
[34:00] so let's throw everything away now let's
[34:02] do a reset
[34:03] let's have church let the revival fires
[34:06] burn
[34:07] that's why we come here not to fall
[34:10] asleep
[34:10] not to get bored but really enter in now
[34:15] i encourage you maybe it's just a simple
[34:18] thing we showed tonight but put on your
[34:20] spiritual cap
[34:21] seek god and everything that's said and
[34:24] i promise you he will reveal himself to
[34:26] you
[34:27] he's that type of god he will reveal
[34:29] himself to you
[34:31] okay he's a sovereign almighty god
[34:35] where you think least he can reveal
[34:37] himself he will reveal himself brother
[34:40] in the deepest trial when you're at your
[34:42] weakest point he can reveal himself to
[34:45] you
[34:46] on top of the mountain brother ed when
[34:48] you and your wife is there
[34:50] he can reveal himself to you everywhere
[34:53] god is is around us we just choose
[34:57] to look the other way but that don't
[35:00] make it that god's not here
[35:02] amen that's pretty much all
[35:06] amen that's what it's about come on
[35:09] church man
[35:10] that's what it's about amen
[35:14] amen thank you musicians amen hallelujah
[35:18] praise the thank our musicians
[35:20] sister god bless you brother isaac
[35:23] [Applause]
[35:25] god bless you god bless you joshi i love
[35:28] you
[35:28] god bless you brother phil i love you
[35:31] brother james
[35:33] god bless you sister elizabeth god bless
[35:35] you you guys can be seated
[35:37] amen let's give the land and lord a
[35:39] handcuff of applause
[35:41] oh no the messages you stand up
[35:44] we haven't opened a word yet we haven't
[35:46] invited him yet
[35:48] so sorry i got ahead of myself brother
[35:51] ed can you put on that
[35:53] first little
[35:56] little um quote the i love
[36:00] quotes but i don't i don't live by
[36:02] quotes i live by the word of god
[36:04] okay so i want you to remember
[36:07] everything i say here
[36:08] there is nothing new all of it comes out
[36:10] of here
[36:11] some of it comes out of the message a
[36:14] lot of it comes out of here
[36:15] but most of it comes from the cloud okay
[36:18] so when the lord
[36:19] puts a thought in your heart and it's
[36:21] been bothering you for two or three
[36:23] weeks how am i going to put it together
[36:25] then sometimes it's better just to let
[36:26] go and let god so
[36:28] i've got notes but i ain't going to
[36:30] guarantee i'll be staying on them
[36:31] tonight okay
[36:32] so if it looks like it's going this way
[36:34] it's for someone don't worry then it's
[36:35] not for you
[36:36] okay amen so let's go that first quote
[36:39] is that on
[36:42] see if i can we wait okay faith
[36:46] look at this quote faith is based on
[36:49] forgiveness
[36:51] huh that's not my sermon but i read this
[36:54] today and i thought
[36:55] man that could be something brother
[36:58] isaac could preach on one day
[37:00] he liked those one words forgiveness
[37:02] okay but that's that's not it let's see
[37:04] how this one works
[37:05] we're gonna go to amos eight
[37:14] i think that there we go amos eight amen
[37:16] so i'm gonna try to follow with two
[37:18] computers because i made a little couple
[37:19] of notes but
[37:20] i'm gonna promise not to stay on the
[37:21] notes i say to the lord lord if you take
[37:23] over
[37:24] i will do whatever you say so it says
[37:27] here in amos 8 i've got it in my bible
[37:29] as well
[37:31] this was a sword that was just lying
[37:32] there on the on the table if anybody's
[37:34] missing this sword i
[37:36] borrowing it for tonight david could
[37:38] borrow goliath sword to cut off his own
[37:40] head i can borrow this sword to just
[37:42] you know advance the fight it says there
[37:45] in amos 8 and verse 11 and we're going
[37:48] to maybe read verse 12 as well he says
[37:50] behold
[37:50] is everybody there amen he says behold
[37:54] the days come say of the lord that i
[37:56] will
[37:56] send a famine in the land not not
[38:00] a famine for bread nor a
[38:03] thirst for water but a hearing of the
[38:06] words of the lord
[38:09] and they shall wander from sea to sea
[38:11] and from north and even to the east
[38:15] they shall run to and fro to seek the
[38:18] word
[38:19] of the lord and shall not find it
[38:25] are we in that time
[38:29] have we looked around how many of you
[38:33] would quote the scripture and people
[38:34] laugh at you is that so far-fetched
[38:38] so my title tonight is the army of the
[38:40] lord jesus christ that is the
[38:43] this is the the thing that i want you to
[38:45] realize i am a
[38:46] regimental man i grew up in a family
[38:49] that that
[38:50] works with structure okay
[38:53] and i've learned that god is not always
[38:55] in structure
[38:57] he's in between the structure okay he
[39:00] sits right in where everybody
[39:02] feels a bit uncomfortable that's where
[39:04] god works if you are comfortable in this
[39:06] church i'm telling you god i'm dealing
[39:08] with you
[39:09] and then you need to go back on your
[39:10] knees and pray and say lord
[39:12] reveal to me something because i like
[39:14] these cheese too much
[39:15] i'm sitting too comfortable i'm falling
[39:18] asleep i'm missing something because if
[39:19] god is not dealing even if you're on the
[39:21] mountain
[39:22] he will still teach you stuff he'll
[39:23] still put you through trials
[39:25] but you need to remember when you get
[39:27] comfortable here
[39:28] there is major problems but we're not
[39:31] going to preach that now but i'm just
[39:33] saying
[39:33] okay so you all can have your seat and
[39:35] we're going to shoot
[39:36] and see if we can get this this enemy
[39:39] the devil
[39:40] away from us so in 2 corinthians
[39:43] 3 and this is where it comes in with the
[39:48] army of the lord jesus christ it says
[39:50] here ye
[39:51] are our epistles written in your hearts
[39:53] known and read of all men
[39:55] for so much as you manifest declared to
[39:58] be the pistol of jesus
[40:00] ministered by us written not with ink
[40:04] listen to this not just written written
[40:06] not with ink
[40:08] okay but with the spirit of the living
[40:11] god
[40:12] okay not on tables of stone as with
[40:15] moses
[40:16] didn't say with moses i added that but
[40:19] in fleshly tables of the heart
[40:23] so what he says is you have to have to
[40:25] be in this gospel to be
[40:27] to be even a warrior for christ you
[40:29] still have to have a heart
[40:31] you still have to because christ as as
[40:34] much as he walked on this earth and
[40:35] every devil he defeated under his
[40:37] his feet he still had a heart he had
[40:40] authority
[40:41] but he had a heart so let us not get
[40:44] hard and calloused let us expose this
[40:47] tonight i pray the lord come knocks at
[40:49] your door
[40:50] and just remind you that you cannot help
[40:52] anyone else even yourself
[40:54] if your heart is of stone no matter how
[40:57] much
[40:58] law you have in you no matter how much
[41:00] scriptures
[41:01] how much brother ben quotes and brother
[41:03] branham quotes in brother isaac sermons
[41:05] and brother munpo sermons
[41:07] that don't help you nothing it's about
[41:10] revelation but if you have a heart if
[41:12] you push back before you accept before
[41:14] you take anything
[41:16] if you push back you're going to find
[41:18] yourself alone
[41:20] and you're going to find yourself in the
[41:21] outskirts of a war being fought by a
[41:24] multi-member body
[41:26] and you think how did i get here now i'm
[41:28] jumping way ahead but i just want to say
[41:30] i'm not even preaching that tonight
[41:31] that's another service but it's so
[41:34] important because what satan does is he
[41:36] causes the vision he starts pushing you
[41:37] away
[41:38] he pushes you away from your helplines
[41:40] don't go to the prayer meeting
[41:42] he says don't go to this meeting don't
[41:44] go to the youth group don't go through
[41:45] that oh you don't want to be part of
[41:46] brother falls this and
[41:48] just not tonight but do you know that
[41:50] that
[41:51] separates the army and if you are a
[41:53] general
[41:54] fighting against another person what you
[41:56] want to do is you want to cause the
[41:58] vision
[41:59] you want to push them aside because it's
[42:01] easy to handle one two three
[42:03] with a big army and i'm gonna talk about
[42:06] the army of satan i want you to realize
[42:08] that this is a very very great war
[42:11] and unfortunately for us we find
[42:13] ourselves smack back in the middle of it
[42:16] and you go why me i want to tell you why
[42:20] not you
[42:21] i want to encourage you this is not a
[42:22] fight this is what the lord showed me
[42:24] because i had a pity party by myself one
[42:26] day i thought man i can't take it
[42:27] anymore
[42:28] there's always this and then that and
[42:29] then that doesn't work in the sound
[42:31] resolution
[42:31] and but at a stage god just went and and
[42:34] like he flicks you on the ear you know
[42:35] when you
[42:35] was doing something naughty like
[42:38] and he goes
[42:39] but see you're looking at it wrong your
[42:41] perspective
[42:42] is man's perspective but you're not
[42:44] seeing what i'm trying to do and why do
[42:46] i have to repeat myself to you
[42:49] can't you get it the first time see the
[42:52] people that got god's message the first
[42:54] time
[42:54] is the ones that went into the land the
[42:57] one where the message was revealed to
[42:59] them and it sunk into their hearts god
[43:01] didn't have to talk to us he only spoke
[43:02] once and i'll show it as well
[43:05] he doesn't need to talk to you twice
[43:07] needs to talk to you once
[43:08] but your attitude import that is so
[43:11] important that you have the right
[43:12] attitude
[43:13] so as i'll go i'll keep a whole couple
[43:15] of slides because i just went way
[43:16] ahead so we've got the the mighty
[43:19] campaign
[43:20] and he said unto them go ye into the
[43:23] world and preach the gospels to every
[43:24] creature that's all that's our standing
[43:26] orders brother ben
[43:28] that's it then we've got in this
[43:30] campaign of the lord
[43:32] we've got you the soldier me the soldier
[43:35] that that's a that's
[43:36] that's part two hopefully lord willing
[43:39] okay i'm going to talk about campaign
[43:41] tonight
[43:42] then we have the army of god now you see
[43:44] this guy
[43:45] he's praying for all of us he's on his
[43:48] knees
[43:49] because before you go into a battle you
[43:52] get on your knees i've seen photos
[43:54] because i've googled so many photos to
[43:56] get the right one so some of these
[43:57] photos i had to change
[43:58] just because you don't always want to
[44:00] show everything ask brother isaac it's
[44:02] real hard to get photos on the
[44:03] internet but this was the best one i
[44:06] thought hey
[44:07] you know if we're a multi-member barney
[44:09] and the rest of the army is not there
[44:10] he's praying for reinforcements
[44:12] okay so let him pray okay he's in the
[44:15] right position
[44:16] then we got this this guy this guy
[44:19] the spy in the camp i wanna i wanna
[44:22] expose that guy
[44:24] to the help of our lord jesus christ i
[44:26] wanna expose him every day in my life
[44:28] because this guy has no face he just he
[44:31] just creeps he's a slicker he just
[44:33] creeps in everywhere
[44:34] he's as sly and slick as you can get
[44:37] them man he can sell ice to an eskimo
[44:39] and make him pay for it double the price
[44:41] just remember that this guy's slick but
[44:44] this one the five star general asked
[44:47] brother ben
[44:48] can it be a seven star general because
[44:51] he had the seven stars
[44:53] come on he's five stars just don't do it
[44:56] right
[44:57] jesus christ he is the general
[45:01] and let us tell you if we can expose
[45:04] this guy
[45:06] and we can have preeminence in our life
[45:08] about the lord jesus christ
[45:10] and we just follow some basic rules
[45:13] we will have a good warfare amen because
[45:16] the battle belongs to the lord
[45:19] let us never forget it amen so and and
[45:22] the lord jesus christ is our final
[45:23] sermon because i pray
[45:25] that when we do that that you would
[45:28] actually see what the lord does in our
[45:30] life
[45:31] every day we forget it we're so used to
[45:34] miracles we forget it
[45:38] war so this is a bit of boring stuff
[45:39] i'll try to go as fast as i can through
[45:41] it but
[45:42] the reason i had it in is because you
[45:43] have to build a little bit up before we
[45:45] get to the
[45:46] the juicy bits okay so war what is war
[45:51] what good is in war but what is war so
[45:54] the definition of war
[45:56] or what i could find on it is war is an
[45:58] intense
[46:00] arm conflict no matter if it's a sword
[46:03] or a fist or words or whatever it's
[46:06] intense
[46:07] it it makes your heart pump it it has
[46:10] emotion
[46:10] in it it it it shakes you up man whoa
[46:13] if if a bomb should drop right next to
[46:15] us now it will shock all of us
[46:18] if have you ever heard a cog in a crash
[46:20] a ball and you're like oh you what went
[46:22] on and you're like
[46:23] and it shocks you because something just
[46:24] happened now war is that
[46:26] to the extreme war doesn't stop
[46:30] it doesn't stop until everybody that's
[46:33] in war either makes peace or is dead
[46:36] there's no rules there's no written
[46:38] rules and war that says that once you
[46:39] there's a gentleman's agreement an actor
[46:41] wall but i'm telling you
[46:42] if you can get a spy in the other guy's
[46:44] camp you will send them
[46:46] because you need intel to make sure that
[46:47] when you get to the next part you can
[46:49] win
[46:50] war is ugly nothing good on it
[46:53] even caleb and joshua would fought in
[46:55] the war and the things that they have
[46:57] done
[46:58] you can't tell me they went back to
[46:59] their home and to your wives and just
[47:01] hugged them and said i'm a happy man
[47:04] when you take someone's life when you
[47:06] hurt someone
[47:07] it does something to you even if it's
[47:10] under the promise of god and it looks so
[47:12] good in the scriptures be careful before
[47:14] you
[47:15] make war be careful
[47:19] it comes back and i'll prove it
[47:22] generally it's character of that it's
[47:24] militant groups but i don't care about
[47:26] that
[47:26] generally it's characterized by extreme
[47:29] violence aggression
[47:30] and destruction now you tell me what is
[47:32] the devil about
[47:33] yeah what is the devil about have you
[47:36] seen guys that's
[47:37] full filled in the world that's stuck on
[47:40] drugs
[47:41] you tell me that that's not violence you
[47:44] tell me that's not
[47:45] something acting out on persons we've
[47:47] got witnesses everywhere
[47:49] i used to be in the world drinking you
[47:52] think me acting out when i was drunk and
[47:54] stuff like that the things i've done
[47:55] was anything not to do with war there
[47:58] was something driving me to do stuff
[48:00] that my body didn't want to do because
[48:02] my body wants
[48:03] peace my body wants to live
[48:06] it wants to be a tabernacle of god but
[48:08] the war that's
[48:09] made on my body is producing something
[48:12] that i don't like and it gives you all
[48:14] these of
[48:15] emotions someone comes to him and says
[48:17] what are you doing you're like amen
[48:19] now there is aggression where does that
[48:21] come from you can't tell me i've never
[48:23] seen a guy
[48:24] hit another guy in a fight being happy
[48:26] about it and they're not being angry
[48:28] there you go boy and he eats him back
[48:31] sorry
[48:33] come on have you ever seen a fight like
[48:35] they're not play fighting i mean like
[48:36] these guys got shirts off they're going
[48:38] to punch it and he goes
[48:39] here you go come on man there must be a
[48:42] feeling about it there must be a motion
[48:44] but most emotion leads you sometimes
[48:47] astray
[48:52] so you get the intent is to kill and
[48:54] destroy that's war
[48:57] to divide and conquer is the liberal
[48:59] against the legalist
[49:01] it's the left wing and the right wing
[49:03] you need two wings to fly
[49:05] you're gonna let you know i put that in
[49:06] myself because i thought that was very
[49:08] inspired
[49:08] you need both sides you need them
[49:13] they have to be there okay it can't be
[49:15] this way
[49:16] can't be that way has to be that way but
[49:18] you need them to fly
[49:20] it's crucial it's crucial you've got the
[49:23] law
[49:25] moses is law you've got grace
[49:28] jesus is law but jesus's law don't
[49:31] overwrite moses law because it's all
[49:33] still part of the law because he said he
[49:35] came to magnify that law
[49:36] so you still need the law okay you can't
[49:39] just go grace grace and do whatever you
[49:40] like feel you like want to do
[49:42] and say grace you will be crowned
[49:46] misgrace you will not find grace
[49:51] you will be the the laughing stock of
[49:54] everyone because you think you can do
[49:56] what you want to get away with it there
[49:57] is still law
[49:59] okay but there is grace we have to find
[50:02] the middle here
[50:03] as a congregation as as people walking
[50:06] in step with the general we need to we
[50:09] need to find the balance god will help
[50:12] us but we
[50:13] need to keep an endeavor to keep the
[50:15] bonds of peace which we have
[50:18] so i'm not telling off we're going on
[50:19] i'll show you more pictures children
[50:21] there's
[50:21] lots of them i try to get as much
[50:24] pictures i can to get this
[50:26] through
[50:30] now look there this is war look very
[50:33] hard at this picture
[50:34] people die people get wounded
[50:37] yet this guy is very liberated
[50:43] what is it about so if i beat you i win
[50:47] so if you lie on the floor dead and i
[50:49] conquer 17 others of you i win
[50:51] that we really win you think a sinner
[50:54] out in the world we want to send them to
[50:56] hell
[50:57] you think brother branham when he said
[50:59] they said they didn't even know who was
[51:00] his friends or his enemy he treated
[51:02] everyone the same
[51:03] why do we want to be these guys that's
[51:05] on the charge for god
[51:07] where's the balance where's the soft
[51:09] heart
[51:12] just remember that where's the soft god
[51:14] i'm not saying if that is the enemy
[51:16] the lord will make it happen we'll get
[51:18] there
[51:19] but you must be knowing that your
[51:21] perfect will of god
[51:22] when you go forth to to attack your
[51:24] enemy you must know that it is time to
[51:26] strike
[51:27] and the only way you know when it's time
[51:29] to strike is when he says strike
[51:31] but be sure be very very sure
[51:41] this is where it all began children
[51:45] who knows this picture why do you know
[51:47] this picture
[51:48] what happened there
[51:53] michael threw lucifer out of heaven
[51:57] this dude look at his fist can everybody
[52:00] see that first
[52:02] does he look happy okay
[52:05] so here's my backing because i think
[52:07] people don't believe me and there was a
[52:09] great war in heaven michael and his
[52:10] angels fought against the dragon and the
[52:12] dragon fought against
[52:13] and his angels and prevailed not amen
[52:18] neither was their place found for them
[52:20] anymore in heaven
[52:21] so something happened in heaven
[52:25] and there was no more place found for
[52:26] these dudes and the great dragon was
[52:29] cast out that old serpent called the
[52:31] devil
[52:32] and satan which deceiveth the whole
[52:34] world
[52:37] the whole world don't you get deceived
[52:39] the whole
[52:40] that is he straight this is what he does
[52:42] this is he is the king of deception
[52:45] he is the best king of the saints he'll
[52:48] sell you everywhere give him that credit
[52:50] that's what he does
[52:50] but but when he gets exposed
[52:54] there's no deception anymore when sin
[52:57] comes to the surface even with us when
[52:59] the lord is poking at somebody say hey
[53:01] spiritual caps now something's coming
[53:03] and saying hey that emotion you have in
[53:05] you
[53:05] something that is that is creating this
[53:07] negative feeling towards someone there's
[53:09] something there i want you to expose
[53:11] that and once you expose that
[53:14] then god can deal with him because it's
[53:17] not you doing the fight
[53:19] he's the five star general or the seven
[53:21] star
[53:22] so this guy deceives the whole world and
[53:25] he was cast into the
[53:27] okay so let's throw satan out of heaven
[53:30] he ends up here garden of eden now i
[53:34] could not find a nice garden of eden
[53:36] picture leave her over
[53:37] so this is the garden of eden i just see
[53:40] because it's the full word
[53:42] and it's restored that's the garden of
[53:44] eden for me that's the only way i could
[53:45] see it
[53:46] because it wasn't an apple
[53:51] every picture has a snake and apple in
[53:53] it like for crying out loud don't you
[53:55] read your bibles
[53:58] man okay i had some notes here
[54:01] and i'm on the wrong page stop come on
[54:04] i'll just say
[54:05] apple apple apple apple we should hand
[54:08] out more apples eh
[54:12] people realize they're naked when they
[54:13] eat apples boy we're gonna have problems
[54:16] as prophet said it i'm not i'm not
[54:18] saying anything new prophet said it
[54:20] why need the word of god we
[54:23] need we speaking to myself need the word
[54:26] of god to be our training manual
[54:28] our weapon of choice okay
[54:31] if you're in doubt when you feel you're
[54:33] a bit out of your field
[54:35] take this word spend time with him i say
[54:38] with him
[54:39] because this is him in print form okay
[54:42] he'll reveal you to your heart and
[54:44] you'll reveal
[54:44] through you but you need to put
[54:46] something in to get something out
[54:48] okay god don't just do miracles all the
[54:51] time he waits for you to give
[54:52] to take a step so that he can he can
[54:54] come because remember
[54:56] this is this is a thing that god does i
[54:58] think people and and i sometimes forget
[55:00] it as well
[55:01] you have to put a foot forward so that
[55:04] god can come behind
[55:05] i'm looking for the word what is that
[55:06] word and confirm
[55:08] that he's with you the prophet said i'm
[55:11] going to pray for you now
[55:12] but i need him to come but the prophet
[55:14] had to start praying
[55:16] and he will talk to jesus and he'll
[55:18] speak to him and say lord as you healed
[55:20] this one
[55:20] and lord you healed this one and you're
[55:22] amazing god and his enemies he's here
[55:24] now
[55:25] so sometimes we just need to put the
[55:27] step forward so that lord can start
[55:29] confirming that hey
[55:31] my child i am with you okay
[55:34] but don't you think that the enemy is
[55:37] not up for the challenge
[55:39] see what we forget if i go is that the
[55:42] next one just before i jump in but this
[55:44] is really
[55:44] important this is this is
[55:48] i'm still the earth hey
[55:52] ah okay so it's one back so see
[55:56] this guy satan he was actually
[56:01] in heavenly places with christ jesus
[56:05] okay think about this you think that we
[56:08] can just
[56:08] easily step over the devil and trample
[56:11] on him because he's under our feet
[56:12] and under us be careful this man spent
[56:15] time with
[56:16] god though you are from god you are
[56:18] still a little bit blinded to a lot of
[56:20] things
[56:20] and you still going through a lot of
[56:22] training but your
[56:24] enemy has already been
[56:27] there and the whole big problem of this
[56:31] guy which i'll show next
[56:32] is he does not believe
[56:36] he's an unbeliever though he spent in
[56:39] the presence of god he was at every song
[56:42] he led most of the songs he was right
[56:44] there in heaven he experienced heaven
[56:47] yet he does not believe
[56:50] and you know what he can't
[56:54] he can't believe he knew what happened
[56:56] here
[56:57] so if this happened and the book says it
[56:59] happened and the book says it's going to
[57:01] the lake of fire you think he's all of a
[57:02] sudden going to start
[57:03] believing the book because it's his
[57:06] despise genesis reveals him and that
[57:08] and revelation says where he's going you
[57:10] think all of a sudden he's just going to
[57:12] tell everybody the bible is true guys
[57:15] come on we're not playing era this is
[57:18] war
[57:19] this is this i'm talking about the
[57:20] campaign so we're on earth
[57:22] this is where it happened but here this
[57:24] is what brother branham says
[57:26] joseph meeting his brethren so he's
[57:28] talking about the two seats in the
[57:29] garden of eden
[57:31] and he says since when when he fell
[57:35] and after the hearing after god said to
[57:37] eve
[57:38] why has thou done this since he goes
[57:40] it's the super serpent he beguiled me
[57:42] he turned to satan and he said your seed
[57:45] are going to have m i'll put enmity
[57:47] between your seed
[57:49] and the woman's seed and since that day
[57:52] see this is what i want to tell you boys
[57:53] and girls
[57:54] the war started not just in heaven
[57:57] it came down to earth and now these two
[58:00] seeds started fighting on earth and was
[58:02] kept in cain killed abel
[58:04] god raises up seth then moses destroy
[58:08] all the children in in egypt because
[58:11] there's a deliverer coming
[58:12] all the firstborns and the younger the
[58:14] two years gets killed moses has to go in
[58:16] a little bushel and be pushed down the
[58:18] river
[58:18] because he wanted to kill that seed of
[58:20] god then then
[58:22] it says here and he comes off and then
[58:23] he was looking for him and he's just
[58:25] jumping a bit because he was an abraham
[58:26] was in everyone but yeah he says he went
[58:28] to john the baptist
[58:30] so satan goes off with his head but the
[58:32] spirit move on and the spirit went into
[58:34] jesus christ with his god in flesh
[58:36] he killed him see the the war the intent
[58:39] the killing
[58:40] i want to kill i want to hurt i wanna i
[58:43] wanna
[58:44] i wanna win i i wanna remember these
[58:47] words
[58:47] i remember them it's coming back
[58:51] then he killed him on calvary but god
[58:52] raised him up again
[58:54] that's okay and then all of a sudden he
[58:56] goes away but then
[58:57] now god send this holy spirit and his
[59:00] holy spirit is now each one of us
[59:03] and do you think that he stopped with
[59:05] jesus christ
[59:08] you think you stopped then no you got
[59:10] the holy spirit he's coming after you
[59:12] mario
[59:13] karo you got the holy spirit he's coming
[59:15] after you
[59:16] because that same seed that's the same
[59:19] promise that god said i would put enmity
[59:21] that's still going to jesus christ
[59:23] throws him in the lake of fire because
[59:25] even if he gets bound for a thousand
[59:27] years
[59:28] he's going to get loosened again and
[59:29] then god's going to come back and deal
[59:31] with him and throw him in the lake of
[59:32] fire
[59:33] so even after he sees oh i'm licked
[59:36] he's still going to give it a go and he
[59:38] will be loosed for that season because
[59:40] he's still
[59:41] he's programming his kill destroy
[59:44] conquer divide kill destroy and that's
[59:46] what he's doing in every churches
[59:49] in believers in families families man
[59:54] he's a slicker but our lord is going to
[59:58] deal with him
[59:59] amen that's a promise we just have to
[1:00:03] we just have to to try to get a bit of a
[1:00:05] word in season that can give us an
[1:00:06] encouragement to say lord i'm not
[1:00:08] fighting this fight in vain
[1:00:10] i'm not standing for jesus christ in
[1:00:12] vain
[1:00:13] okay there must be something into you
[1:00:14] say this but just a little bit more lord
[1:00:17] just once more lord

[1:00:32] you're gonna have to because if you
[1:00:36] don't pick a side the side will be
[1:00:37] picked for you because the way the tree
[1:00:39] leans
[1:00:40] the way it falls so don't you think i'm
[1:00:43] preaching to do
[1:00:44] i preach to parents everyone there's a
[1:00:46] time where you gonna have to pick a side
[1:00:49] and if you don't and your court gets
[1:00:51] called and the lord says come up
[1:00:53] the way the tree leans is the way it
[1:00:55] falls
[1:00:57] and i'm not trying to do to preach hell
[1:00:59] death and brimstone
[1:01:00] the way the tree leans the way it falls

[1:01:48] faculties yes the lord can do a miracle

[1:02:21] are
[1:02:21] you have no direction you have no
[1:02:24] purpose you're just a vagabond and a
[1:02:26] stranger
[1:02:26] roaming around being led by the devil
[1:02:30] because god can't lead you because you
[1:02:32] didn't pick a side

[1:09:50] my saving grace i said lord

[1:11:15] person don't get me wrong i get very
[1:11:17] emotional take time to get to know each

[1:11:23] message brother you know when did the
[1:11:25] lord call you
[1:11:26] where did you come from brother isaac
[1:11:28] we've got your testimony online
[1:11:30] what a testimony that man has resolved
[1:11:33] amen
[1:11:34] no matter what nobody says i respect him
[1:11:36] he's got resolve because he says
[1:11:38] something and he does something
[1:11:39] no matter how he gets there that's not
[1:11:41] what he wants he's going to do it
[1:11:43] brother ben
[1:11:44] how did you meet the lord you said i was
[1:11:46] printing books when i was 20
[1:11:48] six years old 23 years old printing
[1:11:52] books making tapes that
[1:11:53] on his journey so when i see this man
[1:11:56] going to papua new guinea i say lord
[1:11:58] bless him because he's got a burden
[1:12:00] he wants to spread your word so i get
[1:12:02] behind the word
[1:12:05] get behind the marching orders i'm not
[1:12:08] out of line
[1:12:09] i don't judge i don't think wrong the
[1:12:10] moment the devil goes
[1:12:12] chase don't like you i say but i love
[1:12:14] him
[1:12:17] he hates that he thinks you're you're
[1:12:19] weird
[1:12:20] cool because i like weirdos
[1:12:23] because if you put a lot of bolts in the
[1:12:25] car you need the knots if
[1:12:27] you don't have nuts the car falls apart
[1:12:29] you need nuts
[1:12:31] so let me be a nut i like it this way
[1:12:34] okay i'm about to close sorry
[1:12:37] this is our campaign now
[1:12:41] can you guys read this i will he said
[1:12:44] and
[1:12:46] restore to you the years that the
[1:12:48] locusts have eaten that the cankerworm
[1:12:50] that the caterpillar and the palmer were
[1:12:52] and the great army which i sent among
[1:12:55] you
[1:12:56] so god's saying i kicked satan out of
[1:12:59] heaven
[1:13:00] i did it but i can restore
[1:13:03] i how many times did he say that five
[1:13:05] times like satan
[1:13:08] how many times once
[1:13:12] because god don't speak twice
[1:13:16] he spoke to to to noah he says noah
[1:13:19] bought me a boat
[1:13:20] and 120 years later noah was still
[1:13:22] building a boat
[1:13:23] only spoke once once
[1:13:28] god don't need to talk to us time and
[1:13:30] again and if you find yourself
[1:13:32] reasoning time and again over the same
[1:13:34] thing it's not god speaking
[1:13:40] that was under inspiration that's not
[1:13:43] god speaking
[1:13:45] because if you said lord you will then
[1:13:48] he will
[1:13:50] when those words come over your lips
[1:13:51] saying it will be done
[1:13:53] then it will be done god don't have to
[1:13:56] tell
[1:13:57] anybody twice he's sovereign so here
[1:14:00] comes god
[1:14:02] and he starts the plan of restoration on
[1:14:04] that cross
[1:14:06] and he takes the beating and he takes
[1:14:08] the scoffing
[1:14:09] they rip out his beard they make fun of
[1:14:12] him they mock him they laugh at him
[1:14:14] but guess what he said i will
[1:14:17] and he only said it once he was standing
[1:14:20] in front of pilate
[1:14:21] and they were making fun of him and he
[1:14:22] said nothing
[1:14:24] because he didn't need to say anything
[1:14:26] pilate asked him a question
[1:14:28] he said to him back a question he says
[1:14:29] who do you think i am
[1:14:32] he didn't entertain no devil
[1:14:37] i think i'll close with this one
[1:14:48] now i want to ask you life or death
[1:14:53] free moral agency lies with us
[1:14:57] children free moral agency means you got
[1:15:00] the choice
[1:15:03] means you can pick
[1:15:07] parents means you can choose your
[1:15:10] outcome you can have your kneeling you
[1:15:14] can't have your healing brother branham
[1:15:15] said to one lady in the prayer line
[1:15:17] today he says
[1:15:18] if you just believe that it's yours go
[1:15:20] rejoicing
[1:15:21] she still limped off the stage
[1:15:24] and everybody was quite quiet he says
[1:15:26] just remember if you can believe
[1:15:28] it is yours all of a sudden halfway down
[1:15:30] the hallway people start screaming and
[1:15:32] shouting that lady's running in the
[1:15:33] church
[1:15:34] what's that if you can believe
[1:15:38] prophet believed he did it time and time
[1:15:40] and time again it's if you
[1:15:42] can believe so here's your choice life
[1:15:46] or death it
[1:15:46] depends on the response you give is what
[1:15:49] you're gonna receive
[1:15:51] the law in the bible is you give you
[1:15:53] receive
[1:15:56] so what you give what love your neighbor
[1:15:57] as you love thyself that's the second
[1:15:59] commandment you give you receive
[1:16:01] you treat people like dirt dirt's coming
[1:16:03] your way and will bury you
[1:16:07] yeah these two thieves hang on the cross
[1:16:11] and one starts getting to his center
[1:16:14] what cena
[1:16:16] he's he's his reasoning always is his
[1:16:20] conscience
[1:16:20] he's he's starting to wake up because
[1:16:23] just before he was coughing as well
[1:16:26] he was coughing as well both thieves
[1:16:30] so now he gets to his his senses there
[1:16:32] we go
[1:16:33] and he says and indeed and we
[1:16:36] indeed justify for we receive the due
[1:16:39] reward of our deeds
[1:16:41] at least he's honest he says but this
[1:16:44] man has done
[1:16:44] nothing amiss and he said unto him
[1:16:48] unto jesus lord he recognized
[1:16:52] this was his time and he says
[1:16:56] remember me when thou comest into thy
[1:16:58] kingdom and jesus said unto him
[1:17:00] verily i said unto thee that they shall
[1:17:03] thou this day
[1:17:04] to today thou shalt be with me in
[1:17:07] paradise
[1:17:10] so look at this picture of war
[1:17:14] and this is where i close and we can go
[1:17:16] into prayer now
[1:17:17] i don't want you can pray loud if you're
[1:17:19] not you can pray in your heart
[1:17:21] i want to ask you something very
[1:17:23] personal tonight
[1:17:25] are you fighting like these guys on the
[1:17:29] outskirts
[1:17:31] there are you a one-man band fighting
[1:17:33] your way to victory
[1:17:35] or do you get stuck in with these guys
[1:17:38] because look
[1:17:39] we are shekinah we are a small little
[1:17:42] battalion like that
[1:17:44] and we all huddled together real nice
[1:17:46] and tight and you know what if i
[1:17:48] didn't put any deodorant on you're going
[1:17:49] to smell me
[1:17:53] because we're going to get real close
[1:17:56] because the
[1:17:57] closer we get the less space between us
[1:18:00] for the enemy to come in
[1:18:02] the closer we get if you find yourself
[1:18:06] always being on the outskirts when there
[1:18:08] is a church meeting in
[1:18:12] get closer fellowship
[1:18:16] talk to one another get to know one
[1:18:17] another this
[1:18:19] is not a time to go on to your own
[1:18:21] things
[1:18:22] you think it's later than you think the
[1:18:24] prophet already preached that with the
[1:18:26] fleshing red light
[1:18:30] if you find yourself as one of these
[1:18:33] guys that's called
[1:18:34] brother isaac knows it he's wrote a song
[1:18:36] and he says no man's land
[1:18:40] it's the death of mania come on
[1:18:43] good man let us not find ourselves in no
[1:18:48] man's land
[1:18:49] let us huddle up closer if your brother
[1:18:52] smells tell him next time hey you can
[1:18:54] use bruising
[1:18:55] on please because now you're saying it
[1:18:58] out of love
[1:19:00] because man stinks things okay
[1:19:03] but if he doesn't put the odor on on
[1:19:05] just get closer anyways
[1:19:07] because what your enemy don't want to be
[1:19:09] in that space
[1:19:10] if your shoulder is against his shoulder
[1:19:12] you tell me the enemy pushes his nose in
[1:19:14] there he's dead
[1:19:16] so get closer anyway there's a time
[1:19:20] where we as a church should remember
[1:19:21] this
[1:19:22] is not a game this is life or death
[1:19:26] and if little shekinah little shekinah
[1:19:29] starts becoming like these guys here and
[1:19:31] there's confusion and chaos bro
[1:19:33] we're in trouble
[1:19:36] so i ended with a positive note
