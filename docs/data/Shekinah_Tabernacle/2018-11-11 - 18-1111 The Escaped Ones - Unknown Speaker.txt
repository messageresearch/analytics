pronounce him clean and shall let the living bird loose into the open field Amen may the Lord blessed his word you may have your seats this morning I mean so I want to talk about trust the escaped ones we've escaped now it's a it's a important well the world will that we'll call it an important day in history a hundred years ago was the end of World War one which happened on the the Armistice came into effect on the eleventh hour of the eleventh day I mean yeah of the eleventh month in 1918 as a hundred years ago now out of World War one national national identities will form because of the battles you know that we'll fought you're many nations such as Canada Australia and New Zealand their national identity was formed because of World War one and the battles they fought so Gallipoli we we know in this country is a important you know they call it the birth of the Anzac of the of the New Zealand Australian identity and you know the Canadians have the Battle of Vimy Ridge in different battles as well of May and they they use those as part of the forming of a national identity where people were no longer identified just with Great Britain us as just a colony but they were actually begin to inform their own identity because of the battles now if a nation can be formed out of just natural battles that have been fought how much more the bride of Jesus Christ where our identity has been formed and fashioned because of battles and victories that have been won I mean so so can conform their identity around battles that were fought a hundred years ago how much more the kingdom of God the bride of Jesus Christ we're not a hundred years ago but 2,000 years ago the King of glory won the greatest victory conquering hell death and the grave and rose triumph hallelujah and we know we can bring that even and today the victories that we have won that through us through the bride the great victories that God has one through his bride and it forms our identity this is these are the battles we fought where the devil was cast out and and people came free and the word became open and and a people rose to their position in Christ and they become to realize they're not slaves of the devil they don't belong to him but they the Bride of Christ that they're by a new birth that identifies us as his bride as part of himself hallelujah we can rise when you say this is our identity as the Living Word of God has put on flesh in us and this is who we are right so I'm not just when I talk about well what I'm not trying to raise up some nationalism national spirit but I'm trying to say if they can fashion if this country is fashioned on those battles how much more the bride on our battle and what we have won and what he has done for us hallelujah now brother Bram sees in the in the oneness of unity 1958 and he uses this story you're in a few places but but he says in the world today my friends is wanting to see people that's United with Christ to display the genuine Spirit of Christ gallant heroes and closing I might say the world is one to see heroes they honor heroes that's good the old saying is that cowards die a million times while the hero never dies there's a story that comes to mind and I'd like to quote a few just for a few moments the story over here there's too often forgotten many of you mean my age and you woman you'll remember well in our school books and it was many years ago in Switzerland the little Swiss people had went up in the mountains build themselves some houses that had their own economics and so forth a little and they love them there wasn't a warring people they were peaceful and all at once one time coming to Switzerland a great powerful army and they were well-trained men just sitting like them Sikhs they're like a great brick wall great shields great spears well-trained war men and they come marching into Switzerland to take what the Swiss had and the and the Swiss to guard their homes kissed their wives goodbye and their children and their babies and they took old pieces of sickle blades rocks and stones great big clubs went out in the valley to meet the oncoming army and when they got gathered out there just a little bitty handful of men and all around them was a great marching army what could they do they stood hopeless helpless when looking as the other they were licked there was no way around it they were finished after a while there was a man by the name of arnold von wiggler he stepped out and said my men of Switzerland over across the mountains lies a little white home where my wife and three children wait when I kissed them goodbye this morning I'd never seen them again I know I'd never seen them again on this earth they said arnold von we're glad what do you look what are you going to do he says this they are divers whistling well they say Arnold that will do no good why did you say you'll die for Switzerland he said I take you take what you got plowshares little old stick sickles and sticks rocks and clubs you follow me you fight the best you can with what you got said what will you do he threw down a sickle the thing he was going to fight with he raised up his hands he screamed to that great great big army he looked around he saw where the thicker Spears was just everyone in uniform a number marching them right and get them against the mountain on and on that's the way the devil does marching them right into a corner he raised his hands he screen make way for liberty and the oncoming army wondered what and he started running he screamed again make way for Liberty and when he got right into that those big bunch of Spears where many pointed to catch him he grabbed his arms out like this grabbed a whole full arm arm full of spears eand and he threw them into his bosom such a display of real heroes that upset their big army and it routed them here comes the Swiss with clubs and sticks and beat the army out of their nation and they've never had a war from that time to this because one man played the part of the hero and did what was right it's never been exceeded and very seldom compared with such a heroism but oh that's such a little thing till one day many years ago when Adams children the race of this world was backed into a corner with sickness disease and sin they had been sent prophets and they killed them they had all kinds of laws and refused them and an Adam's race was backed into a corner there was one who stepped out of him and said I'm going down to earth this day to give my life he was found where the thickest and the dots was the fears of Adams race was death he grabbed death he went to Calvary he pulled it into his bosom hallelujah and he and he told his disciples empty out now go yonder wait up yonder till I send you back something to fight worth he says blessed be the name of the Lord he said the Holy Spirit said follow me cat sin and sickness to the wall men and women the greatest thing that's ever been given to the Church of God is not to hold some ecclesiastical paper in your hand but as to be filled with God's holy spirit to cut the kingdom of the devil until our chief captain comes to take over god bless you don't think I'm beside myself as true I know what I talk off men have on a woman you who believe in God you who claim to have the Spirit of God in your heart if you're sick or needing you've got the weapon there to fight that sickness worth attending you God give it to you why do you stand back like a coward why do we stand on the sidelines let's follow the captain let's follow him that went to Calvary when he went to Calvary he was wounded for our transgressions with the stripes we were healed take what he gives you and fight sickness and sin fight unbelief away tell the devil is a liar Christ said he has overcome the world greater is He that send you that he that's in the world greater as the power of Christ in you than that sickness that's in your body tonight greater is the power of Christ and that little bus hitting sin that you can't overcome let's take the Holy Spirit and fight the devil down walk out victorious hearers of the cross hallelujah amen gunfight was what you got hallelujah we're not waiting for him to come back yonder and give us something to fight with we have it we have the weapon and then we have the living anointed word for the stay it's in our possession hallelujah swishin just sit back we should press on I mean we should take the devil I mean cast them out of every part of our lives we'd have to put up with them in any unbelief has to go you fight that unbelief you fight that doubt you fight that reasoning you cast it out of your life hallelujah we don't have to put up with it I mean if a bunch of Swiss standing there for their homeland could say I'm going to go die for Switzerland hallelujah and they defeat I think as the Austrian army at the time but your farmers stood there hallelujah they said this is my land I'm not leading us invader coming how much more people we have a land we have a language being returned through the word of the Living God hallelujah the devil tries to come against you take your family away you say no I'm not going to put up with his lies put up with us deceit but with what you have and kill every enemy that comes against you hallelujah amen that's what we're going to do friends we shouldn't be we should not you know our Lord Jesus we know him as kinsman redeemer he's our kinsman he became flesh he become became one of us to fulfill the law of kinsman redeemer where if someone and a family had been had to sell themselves into slavery thereand debt or whatever it was then someone of the family could come and redeem them they could purchase their deliverance their their freedom and so our Lord Jesus became one of us he became one of us he became a man hallelujah amen and he came he paid the debt that we could not pay amen he paid it on Calvary to set us free so that's one part of the kinsman's work but there's another part of the kinsman's work where I think that we neglect as the kinsmen of India I mean we're here where a kinsman has the right to avenge you know avenge upon if someone came and say murdered one of my family then I have the right as kinsman Avenger to to deal with that enemy I have the right and and our Lord Jesus says that those who who cry out day and night before their God will he not come and avenge them speedily amen we he's our kinsman redeemer he's our kinsman Avenger I mean when we cannot defeat the devil when we cannot cast them out when we cannot overcome even our own self he comes down and undertakes for us for the Lewis I think we've got to call upon our kinsman Avenger or God cast us enemy or God restore my face or God deliver my family or God come loose hallelujah we should pee he wants to be our Avenger he wants to fight you're on Alba ha what husband here wouldn't be proud to stand up and defend their wife hallelujah that's their privilege as their honor Amen if that's just a natural man how much war out our bridegroom they're very Lord of glory hallelujah sir I mean take what you have fight with what you have you say I don't have a lot Jim guy had an ox car and he defeated full of signs David had a head of sling they didn't have through my safe win with what they had and they killed them all hallelujah fight with what you got anything in the hands of God God will meet will will meet the challenge of the enemy and defeat him with what you have hallelujah now we have escaped the stare of the enemy daresay we read about the about the living bird that was that was dipped you know so the mate was killed and then and in the living mate was was was dipped in you know the hyssop and the scallop were you on the cedar and the and and the blood of the of the mate and him was released to to to fly loose into an open field now we we know I'm sure very quickly from reading that that we realize our did make was the Lord Jesus Christ and and the bride has been dipped in his blood I mean that the living word that the life wasn't in him is now in her right and then now the bride has been flying for for seven church ages over the over the world with his life this freedom this Liberty I'm in this there's redemption this healing this restoration hallelujah and the greatest thing is now but the devil he he is the he is the Fowler that tries to catch the catch the bird with a snare right so he tries to and and this is what he wants to do he wants to design a snare that will kill its prey and we know the ultimate sneer that he made was death hallelujah I mean the ultimate steer and we're bored and it's sin that produces death and we're born and sin right we don't become sin as we were born sinners we were born lost you don't need to train a child to lie you don't need to teach them to steal or deceive it's just in them because it's for the nature already enter people right and so now so we are in that snare we're born in that snare but the Lord Jesus comes and breaks the snare of death practice near of unbelief hallelujah that our souls have escaped as a bird out of a snare amen so now we are now free we are now free the program says of the great speckled bird that we worried about well let's just read let's go to Jeremiah 12 if you want to follow me Jeremiah speaks of the speckled bird which is the one I believe we just read about he sees in Jeremiah 12 7 and just just down to 9 he says I've forsaken so I don't have this on over here I have forsaken my house I've left my heritage I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hands of her enemies my heritage is as unto a lion in the forest that cries out against me therefore have I hated it my heritage is unto me as a speckled bird the birds round a round about our against her come here cymbal all the beasts of the field come to devour so the how the brightest looked at as a speckled bird where there's the enemy has assembled around her to to to devour her now we are living in a day where we're the Bride of Christ is flying right the bride is flying this great speckled bird is flying but there's also as we just read this more than just you know just like a natural just like in nature there's not just doves this crows these Magpies there's all different kinds of animal your birds but God is looking for heavenly dove because he because he because he identified himself as a dove and a dove Mary's a dove just like a lamb you know a sheep you know a sheep Mary sheep you know like Mary like so he's looking for a group of people that are this great speckled bird there's been speckled by his blood that has life is now in her now in Revelations 18 I'm probably jumping around a bit but let's go to revelations 18 because there's a cage in this earth that that contains a lot of hateful Birds lay a bit of a foundation so so revelations 18 and one this is now after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven having great power and the earth was lightened with his glory and he cried mightily with a strong voice now we read there in verse one and after these things now in revelation 17 there's identification of of the great of Revelation which we know is the Catholic Church and her daughters it's man's religion right so now he's saying so after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven having great power and the earth was lightened with his glory and he cried mightily with a loud voice saying Babylon the Great is fallen is fallen and has become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird so you say no this is upon the earth this this this Babylon has become a cage and in this cage is every foul spirit demon spirit right habitation of devils and a every unclean and hateful bird and that word hateful Mesa detest especially to persecute so these so so this is actually and and this keep reading and for all nations have drunk of the wine of the fauna of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies and I heard another voice from heaven saying come out of her my people that ye be not partakers of her sins and that ye be receive not of her plagues for sin has reached unto heaven and God hath remembered her iniquities so now here's a call and this angel that came down and how having great power and the earth was lightened with his glory is the Ministry of Malachi for where the glory of the Lord has filled the earth because the Son of man has been revealed again in the same time and so now the voice saying this angel saying you know Babylon is fallen is fallen and we know that this world has fallen when the church started at Pentecost fully redeemed free people the snare was broken see the most deceptive snare on the earth is religion right it's a religious snare and so and so the church started off free but then the Antichrist spirit came in made it lukewarm and powerless and formal and it was sneered right and then so now and this has grown until it's the cage you very hateful that unclean you hateful unclean bird habitation of devils hold of every foul spirit and so but now there's a call saying it has fallen and it has fallen but in these another call come out of her my people and be not partaker of a pledge there's a call now come out from among them come out from her that you don't receive her plagues but you receive eternal life so there was a time when there this cage was upon all of us really I meant without the grace of God we would still be in the cage doesn't matter if you were raised in the message you you came out of the world or some church I'm in there had to come a time with her where the Fowler's snare was broken the cage was broken you heard a voice and you had to walk out you had to walk out even sitting in a without a real experience the Cabot omen God met you I trust when he became real to you we heard the voice behind the voice and it's not someone else's testimony it's not well brother brown said you know the same God he knows I mean you met the same Jesus of the Bible hallelujah so now there's a voice in you and then the bride always responds to his voice there's something inner says I must go if he's called me out here I come hallelujah there's something in me Amen so so now we cannot we are not called to be in this cage and I trust none of you are in this cage you've come out you've heard his voice you've left behind everything that's contrary to his word and you're walking with him I'm into this great speckled bird from Christ and Missha God revealed how did they speak all the bird they were both white they were pulled the head off one of the birds and drained the blood upon the other bird and the other bird was speaking with the red blood and it flopped its wings like this and the blood cried holy holy holy and it base the ground so Christ as that did mate he put his blood his blood from his life upon us carrying his blood crying holy holy unto the Lord it's an odd-looking bird sure sure udders but she is the bride as identified by him she is a independent from all others keep thee only unto keep thee only unto her as long as they both shall live keep the only to him the word no adultery not one sign of denomination not one sign of Creed now adulthood all the word and him alone I mean so now she is bathed in his so his life is in her and she is now flying over the land saying holy holy holy unto the Lord so his life is now in her and she the bride is continuing his ministry right so it's the same life so as those who have been united with him right is this great speckled bird and it's his life in her amen she is identified by him and we know that he is the word right he is the Living Word so the bride is identified by Jesus Christ Himself manifesting any and then I mean so he's identified how we trace how we speak I mean sisters with you know wearing a dress not cutting the here's your glory right you identified that is the word I mean this way you've got to put on the word poly or take your melts and strife and envy everything this country to the word take it off your and put on the whole armor of God put on his word holy it's worth it it'll protect you in the good times and in the Med this weapon works anytime anyplace anywhere hallelujah had worked in the first church at worked in Noah's day and worked in Abraham's day and worked in Moses day and worked in Elijah's day David's day Paul's day Peter James and John's day polycarp's day Iranian estate Columbus Day Luther State Wesley's day Pentecostal day and the bride ain't stayin it still works it still produces what it says it'll produce hallelujah sweet I need to polish it make it nice I mean it is nice it'll do what it's meant to do hallelujah this message is not you know we don't need some implement infomercial for this for this message trying to pretend it does some wonder thing but when people bite it's a it's a dumb product no it does what it says it goes hallelujah so now the bride is carrying his word and she becomes his word amen so now she is now walking upon this earth or you fly however you want to use it now proclaiming Liberty for all that who will receive it hallelujah yeah it's exactly like the days worth yo-yo of Abraham Lincoln in the Civil War where the Emancipation and yet sorry the proclamation of emancipation was signed in the White House and that's the that's the that's the government signing into being that on a certain time a certain day all the slaves have to go free right and and it's like anything that the government puts in place it's in time of war there has to be a war to obtain what's what has been written right so now they had to fight just like the Declaration of Independence they they those thirteen colonies signed a signed a piece of paper saying we are free of England independent nation we're a republic but they had to fight many years of bloodshed to actually that that what was written became living right they said our free birth and I had to fight for their freedom and then they were free so what they signed became manifest in the colonies he with me right so that just like this we have received a sign I meant a signed document from heaven an open book from heaven saying that the bride is a free woman I mean she is United with Christ all things belong to her I mean the word has come open to her she has received everything Adam loves Amy in the position they had in the garden of being having dominion over everything upon the earth has been restored to her right but then there has to come a time of fighting I mean that the contents of the document become manifested right so that's why it becomes a war I mean we're where our government heaven has signed it that's come upon the earth now we need to fight for it I mean you say well but Jesus does all the work was just like Israel God said I'll give you the land they received the document on Mount Sinai I mean this is the word now this is the deed to the land right that but but they weren't even in the land they weren't there they were on Mount Sinai they had to walk to the promised land they had to cross Jordan they had to take out Jericho and AI and every different inhabited the land they had to go fight for what was theirs even though God said I give it to you but he said you go fight I mean you go take possession I mean you've got to put your you got to identify yourself with the promise why you can't just give it lip service there you got to put your faith in to say this promise is mine I mean my healing is mine my redemption is mine I'm in the salvation of my family is mine hallelujah you've got a you've got to put your hand to it hallelujah and that's with a that's where the challenge can come it's very easy to sit and talk about it but when it comes a time now you've got to pick it up now you've got our be identified with this word and you've got to possess every promise that God's given you Alleluia so the dawn came finally other civil war was over and the Emancipation the proclamation of emancipation was going to come into effect and so it door Nasser day was when the law came in we're we're we're the slaves were no longer slaves and so now here were here were they they were waiting for that morning and it was when the Sun came up was when they were free and now so the strongest ones would climb up to the top of the mountain the older ones they remember they're all slaves do but but but the older ones they couldn't climb the mountain to see the Sun come up the strong ones only the strong ones could so the strong ones ran up to the top and the young and the babies and the and the mothers may be awaiting down in the valley and they're looking up and they're watching them stand on the ridge and dawn begins to break polio and then they see the Sun Sun strike those on the top of the mountain and then those that are feeling the sun rays call down to the ones down below we're free the Sun is up early the Sun is out we're free hello they are lean they were going to call that a call there you guys wonder the rhuebottom said hallelujah we're free but then they were looking at the Sun but then it's win those sunrays when the Sun went up higher then finally the ones at the bottom of the valley they weren't in darkness anymore but they found those sun rays perlu that they really felt the same sun rays those that at the top and they realized every hallelujah Oh God give me boy hallelujah is the same thing without I'm in a profit climb to the top of the pyramid the Sun as another as a dawn of another day he found the Sun rising and he proclaimed down to the bride you're free you're a free woman you're a free woman and then no doubt we heard about it see that's glorious but they win the Sun rose and there in those racetrack you but the sun rays of us were struck you and you felt the warmth you felt that as another day it's not that I heard about it I'm experiencing hallelujah hallelujah and so now the bride is flying saying we're free amen the word has come into effect amen the battles over I mean the victory has been won the documents come down from heaven hallelujah glory to God amen Jesus gave the Commission to his church go you into all the world and preach the gospel these signs shall follow them that belief and he went with them he went he said yo in my name you'll cast out Devils speak with new tongues take up servant a serpents if you drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt you you shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover and and and so then after the Lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and said on the right hand of God and they went forth and preached everywhere the Lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following so the life they were carrying confirmed with what they were talking about hallelujah and so now and this isn't John it says even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither Northam but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you I'll not leave you comfortless I'll come to you a little while the world seeth me no more but you shall see me because I live you shall live also and that day you shall know that I am in the father and ye and me and I in you he that hath my Commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I'll love him and will manifest myself to him hallelujah who's whose experience have manifesting himself to you amen because you loved his word you love his Commandments hallelujah amen glory to God amen she's saying that the world will not see me so now I think his brother Aaron McGarry said very simply that well that means that everyone who's of the world doesn't see him I mean so the world doesn't see his manifestation they don't understand his manifestation they don't see it they can see maybe a group of people and you know but they don't see the life on display just like Jesus they saw a man even probably wasn't too tall didn't look like much but they didn't see it was the Word made flesh they didn't see the Messiah because they were of the world the scribes and Pharisees they were of the world right they didn't see him so those who are of the world do not see his manifestation but those who are not of the world see him in this day those who are not of the world hand of behind the voice guys who are not of the world a united I mean what with Jesus Christ the Living Word hallelujah amen he said at the end of Matthew he says lo I'm with you always even to the end of the world amen now a dove is a special kind of bird and dove does not need to take a bath big and the reason is because a dove has has oil that it naturally excretes that keeps it clean so there's a life in it pushing out that keeps its feathers clean it doesn't need take a bath amen and it's the same thing with the Bride of Christ right we have a life in a Swede there's something that produces an oil right the oil of the Holy Ghost is enough and keeps pushing out cleansing us right keeps me there that's life saying last Sunday you got to have the strong man in the house amen if he is in your soul the enemy comes into your spirit that life will just push out push out against the enemy amen hallelujah however he's trying to get at you he'll push you out hallelujah glory to God I'm glad he's that way so now his life in us keeps us clean it keeps us clean from the world his life doesn't and it's not our own Reformation it's his transformation it's his life in you keeps you clean hallelujah I'm glad I'm out trust you're glad - hallelujah now as I see it the the so the oil keeps us clean though the anointing God's presence in us keeps us clean now 1st Corinthians 6 he says know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters neither adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves with mankind nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God but such were some of you I mean I'm no but such were some of you but ye are washed but ye are sanctified but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God now when Paul is writing this he's not saying well you know you know you were this but you're still this right he's not saying to these Corinthians well you are still this way but then you say well as the grace of God and you're still this way right let's say the thing is people what they claim to be grace is because they have no power in their walk with God right there the word that is ministered has no power to cleanse and redeem and to set free right so they have to now take a substitute well it's just all grace and keep living the way you want that's not how the gospel works there's a power in the gospel to transform the vilest darkest richest person or the most religious person it doesn't matter what state we're coming I mean there's power in this word to transform anyone who set anyone free I meant to cleanse anyone of anything I mean there is nothing too hard for the Lord nothing at all that's why we don't look at what we see we look by the eyes of faith in His Word and if his word says that thou and thy seed will be there amen this is the heritage of the Lord I say amen amen thine in thy house shall be saved amen absolutely well how do I get my house same the same faith you had for your own soul you now believe with that same faith for your family that's what you do as I say you don't have the build you know a perfect faith the bride has perfect faith because the life we live has pulse in the life I now live I live by the faith of the Son of God you don't say with faith in the Son of God but by the faith of the Son of God so the same faith Jesus had to lay down his own life and take it back up again the same faith Jesus had to go down take the keys off Satan the same faith that he had to cast all the devil's out allegiant the same faith he had to calm the storm the same faith he had to raise Lazarus out of the grave the same faith he had to subject his flesh to the Word of God for him to go to Calvary as a man hallelujah take the sins of the world on himself and come out victorious the same faith he had the bride has because he his faith is in you because he is in you why are you following me it's not your human faith the Bible says that you believe in one God you do well the devil believes also in tremble he doesn't have that kind of faith right for that that's just natural human faith but the brides the faith of the bride is the faith of Jesus Christ right and that is perfect faith he walked out upon the water he didn't sink amen he went to you know he went to dry sis house raised up his daughter hallelujah this is the kind of faith we have but our humanity can get in the way I mean that's why we're go to cast aside reasoning cast aside this person this flesh oh thank you one day because it'll be changed hallelujah you got to drag it around I mean but this humanity gets in the way just put it aside only believers word I mean so the bride has perfect faith because we're the faith of the Son of God the life I now live amen the same faith that the martyrs and the Dark Ages went to the stake with that were torn asunder were butchered terribly by the Antichrist system that same faith is in the bride today I'm in the same faith that you overcome this world with as the same faith they had Alleluia we we we take it for granted what we possess hallelujah the same faith that they could go into the Coliseum I don't know what they sing but they were rejoicing hallelujah you mean soon and very soon I'm going to see the king and more than a nice song that brother whoever wrote Oh sister EVER it's an hour reality hallelujah and these lines are just a just a travel bus to get me to where I want to go hallelujah and they rejoiced and they were thankful and they knew who they were the same faith that because you know we admire them and we should because they stood in their day that's the time-tested memorial of God how glorious but sometimes we think how can we compare but yet the same faith they have you have we need we need that every part of all you say well I'm not facing lions there's a lot of demons out there I'm not facing persecution like they did there's a lot of demons out there this whole world is actually built against you society is built against you whether your local roads being engineered against you because on one hand the devil makes soft living that we don't want to leave and on the other hand he tries to rob us of our faith amen but that's why we don't feel comfortable here because God's going to stir us up just like children of Israel you know and the proper I mean I mean in in Goshen it was the best part of Egypt and Pharaoh gave them Goshen do you think if they were not slaves now no persecution came on them do you think they'd want to leave Moses comes in they've just had a good for 400 years we're going to go to the promised land now God's you're Abraham's the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob met me there burning bush he said now go down we're gonna take you in the promised land that's a no we'll stay here what do you mean I don't want to go fight there I've got this this is good land look at my cattle look at my vineyards you everything's knives you know we're blessed here I don't want to go that's why God had to stir them up he allowed Pharaoh to race that when the deliverer came they said thank you Lord we're on our way hallelujah and that's why there that's why this world troubles us because God doesn't want us comfortable here because this is not our final resting place this is not our destination streets of gold are our destination the winning suppers our destination that's where he wants you to yearn for there I mean that we can really say I'm a pilgrim I'm a stranger I'm just wandering through this world of sin I know where I'm going though hallelujah so you say well I just don't feel comfortable I'd say thank you Lord Jesus but there's nothing in me that really identifies with this world hallelujah all identify mainly is with you and your word and I want to go who wants to go hallelujah amen glory to God amen so now he says so those that Paul said were washed and we're sanctified they really were I mean they were cleansed by you know from all those things because he said but such as 1 some of you now we know the biggest deception because the snare of death has been conquered right the snare of death has been conquered but it has to become real to you that it's been conquered when the Apostle Paul said Oh grave death where is thy sting grave where is thy victory I mean he knew he he had been taken up beyond the curtain of time right he knew where he was going a meant he had met the very God of creation the Lord Jesus Christ on the road to Damascus he knew who he wasn't him right so he wasn't afraid because he knew the sneer of death was broken he knew what was waiting for him just beyond the veil hallelujah and I trust it well it has to be the same with us we've heard a voice from heaven why we've heard a voice from the eternities we've heard the voice of godless last days and that voice has come to find other bits of eternity they'd have to go back into eternity but that's why it speaks to your soul I mean that's why it's gripped you it's because the voices come and said I'm laying claim this is part of me this is part of eternity this has no expiry date hallelujah this world of the devil has an expired name of my children have no expiry date I'll never go off the never go rancid they're never going to get moldy they're just gonna be eternally good hallelujah so now that's why that's why this message I trust has gripped your soul something in use there's been a cry hallelujah just like the chicken you're the eagle in the chicken yard I trust that means something to you I mean with her with a mother Eagle knew she laid two eggs but one was missing and she says I'll not rest until I find number two or number one whichever it was because a farmer snuck in got the egg and put it in his chicken coop and then that chicken hatches out I mean throw that Eagle Hedges out of the chicken coop and it tries to be a tries to be a chicken tries to eat the same things walk the same way tries to fit in you know kids with your kids are yo yo yo kids say terrible things to each other they just they just cut you know so imagine being a little baby eagle with the little baby chicks TT teach you all this you know you're you know just just saying cutting things you're not yellow you look funny what a funny big big nose binky well I know what everyone's look at those feet look at yo you know let's run away from eagle or they wouldn't call me girl it's right away from this guy he looks funny and they played that game and you know sees us and they every everyone wants to fit in so the Eagle little baby girl tries to fit in it doesn't know it's an eagle it thinks it's one of them but their mamas mamas flying around looking looking where is my child where is part of me I'm not satisfied with one I had to they all must return I must have the second enter so she's flying and then finally she flies over the barnyard and and pray always run when there's a predator so all the chickens start making a bunch of noise they they they run as fast as they can but then the shadow of that eagle crosses over there baby eagle on the ground and then and then so so the baby will sees this shadow of the mother Eagle fly over it and it's not frayed and look and something in it says it's something about there I don't know what it is I'm not afraid of that thing and all the others same time you're ugly one you know come in here hiding with us it's scary but it's not scared something this is no and then and then the mother looks down and and cries out cries out what are you doing down there honey hallelujah you're an eagle you're like me and then everything begins to make seats for the baby eagle oh that's why I have these big wings you know I've never used that's why I have these big claws it's like this big beak that's why this razor vision that no one else has down the banya look summer says yes how do I go in how do I get up there just begin to fluff your wings take the faith you haven't begin to play maybe up to the fencepost hallelujah maybe bit of justification up to the top of the barnyard have a Pentecostal shouting time hallelujah this is one more swoop down and catch it he begins the floppers wings flap into the air mother catches it and off they go hallelujah and that is what this message does I trust you one day you're in the barnyard I just don't fit in I remember I didn't really fit in at school I didn't really fit in at universe I tried I tried real hard I just didn't really fit in but then one day I heard a voice one day I heard the voice I made it something in me said that's what I am hallelujah I began to flap my wings may not have been too graceful to begin with but it's not how you start it's how you finish that's the main thing hallelujah glory to God I trust this happened the snare has been broken all those chickens were just being breed to be food hallelujah we're not food friends I mean we're ordained to fly in the heavenly and you've got to realize just just open your eyes and flight oh this is where I am because the devil tries to get our mind your earthbound you'll never get anywhere this is you know just realize who you are in him holy I'm glad we're flying glory to God now but then as I said in the in the beginning the nd Christ spirit came in among the church to make it to try and take the life out he said brother Bram stairs and there's from the church age book he sees here he says he knows so Satan Satan is afraid he knows that the Spirit of God is about to let the people know what of his works this is why he hates these meetings so much when names are called and diseases revealed Satan hates it now what is this it is not mine reading is not telepathy nor is that witchcraft it is a revelation by the Holy Ghost that's the only way I can know it of course the carnal mind will call it anything but the Holy Ghost let me show you another reason why Satan hates this book of Revelation of the gene of Jesus Christ in the church hello church the rich the revelation of Jesus Christ in the church I mean when he reveals himself to you right that's why he hates this he knows that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and he changes not he knows that a whole lot more than do 90% of the theologians he knows that since God is immutable in his nature then he's just as immutable in his ways the Satan knows is surely that the original church at Pentecost with the power of God mark 16 in action is the true church that Jesus claims as his own all houses false it has to be now remember this Christ in the true church as a continuation of the book of Acts hallelujah because it's the same life living through them but the book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and powerless and exposes Satan revealing his works which are the attempt destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's Word amen right down to the time he's cast into the lake of fire he fights it he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for and that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army if they can get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the Christian Church and by God's Spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist spirit Satan will be powerless before her he will be differently thoughted today as when Christ was stood as every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes sir Satan hates revelation but we love it with true revelation in our lives the gates of hell cannot pray Oh prevail against us but we will prevail over them Alleluia so if the people can get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for then she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army I mean I and I just wanted to clear to you now now we have the revelation of the true church right because the true church is part of his words while the true church is the continuation of his ministry the true churches the Word made flesh as the Apostle Paul said you are living epistles read and known of all men writes the epistles he wrote and what they preached became flesh in their lives hallelujah so that is the true church it is the Word made flesh again and people God and His people once again we are the word right when we wake up in the morning we are the word how we treat each other as is the word right you know how we how we treat each other how we dress how we you know how we walk in this world as the Word made flesh amen right so that and then what she and what she stands for what are we standing for God living in a people I mean a Ministry of reconciliation there people are reconciled to God they become one with him that's what we stand for right that the last one would come into the kingdom amen then she and that and and if we are standing for thus then the enemy cannot stand against us I mean as I fight with what you got it'll work I tell you it'll work fight with what you got because she can do the greater works we can do the greater works right and she will be in an invincible army now an invincible I mean never loses a battle but they go through battles amen they may they may fight but they'll be invincible they'll win every every fight and that's what we're cool to do we're cool to win every fight amen when every mind battle cast down reasoning conquer the yo-yo Satan is conquered hallelujah our Lord Jesus conquered a met down Calvary we fight a defeated being a meant he he's been stripped of all power right so we should just go forth and victory and don't let the devil whisper down you know in theories but he doesn't do those things anymore this is just too much pie in the sky and it's not for us it is for us amen the word is for us I mean the promise of the word Irish true is the day they were spoken right it hasn't diminished in any way hasn't gone stale it's just as potent just as powerful as the day I was spoken hallelujah now in the saddest sergej so as we know through church history you go down to the dark ages is the great snare of religion but then God began to break the snare and in the saddest church age we know that was the church age where the Reformation was was was birthed Martin Luther so I wrote as 95 theses put it on the church door there and at Birth the Reformation so in the word Sardis and the English means means the escaped one so they they begin to live out the name of each church age and even I could say this that the bride is living out now don't get me wrong I'll clarify what I mean but we live in the letter C in church age and that means people's rights if one's rising up wanting their rights you see it on the news if everyone is trying to claim their rights now if that's happening on the negative side how much more on the positive side it's not the bride rising up to claim her god-given rights is she not rising up and test saying I will not be bound although BK shall not be put in the box I'll not be silenced I mean but I will speak I will I will petition I will claim what belongs to me I'll take my land I'll take every promise that belongs to me are we not rising up to take our rights hallelujah are we not said something in a saying I will not live below my privilege I will not live in a backslidden defeated State I will live in victory I will walk in victory every day I will be on fire because of a spirit in me hallelujah so we are I'll say it this way we are living out that part of Lady hacia that name because there's the bride has rights and God is here to enforce your rights that you receive them I mean that's why I say he's the kinsman Avenger I mean he's here to to avenge - to take out the vengeance upon the enemy yes hallelujah amen so he says now Sardis now we start up means in English terms that means the escaped one the true side us was the escaped once and now and see the escaped one now we're going to start and he's going to read it says we're going to call at the age of the Reformation and it's a very fitting thing for this Reformation if we call that because the Reformation was the escaped ones the ones that came way and escaped out of it they escaped out of room and it's religion they begin the escape right but then there came a time where where where they form their own denomination so they started out as the escaped ones but then the big came and sneered again and then God raised up another group that's why there's so much so many groups raised up in the Reformation they started out right there they didn't have a full restoration of the word rights they started off but then but then they became sneered but then they had to come a time now where the Fowler's snare the devil stare is fully broken that there is a people that do not fall back into the stare of of that religious snare hallelujah and that's why now God had to send a prophet in this last stage that the whole word came open rare because Jesus Christ cannot be denominated but it kind of what what did the Lutheran's do they raised up the Josh I lived by faith God was working then they put God in a box they took a name and they denominator then they died then God raised up Wesley and many others but then finally there comes down into this last stage where it's not a Reformation but it's a restoration where our people are restored back to the original faith of the father's right and that's what the Ministry of Malachi 4 was to do I mean by the opening of the word as there are people's faith people's hearts will be turned back to the original faith of the fathers hallelujah that they are not turned to another just a way or another religion but they are restored to the faith of the gospel the faith of the world hallelujah and what a glorious Amen you say well what a Thanksgiving Holly what a Thanksgiving this is what a Thanksgiving our I mean when I trust that you have realized in your own soul my hatless word has turned my heart back to the original faith hallelu the faith of the Apostles head I mean I have received hallelujah the faith that the Apostle Paul had to God as missionary journeys when be shipwrecked and be beaten and be robbed and be in prison and be you know and and have to fight false brethren all these different things here to fight with because none of these things move me Olu you the same faith he has the bride has and that's why the enemy your hardship comes trials come false brethren come Antichrist spirits come on things war against us but none of it moves us hallelujah no it moves us because we're stead for us to the same faith he had we have hallelujah glory to God I mean the Fowler's snare has been broken in this hour the devil cannot stop the flight of the great speckled bird hallelujah and the devil cannot stop your flight hallelujah the bride is unstoppable you've got to just God is unstoppable right our God he you know he came down he spoke tomorrow Noah build an ark the world's going to be destroyed that was unstoppable they built the ark they went to a new world hallelujah he yo he came down to Moses gone to the superpower of the age take my people out of that superpower their slaves was he stopped he went in there a two-year old man with a with a shepherd stuff let my people go one spear could have stopped the whole thing Farrakhan I said guys just killed this guy you know he killed an Egyptian 40 years ago yo one spear he was unstoppable and he said to fear okay if you don't let them go more plagues are going to be poured out more plagues and week poured out until finally you have to let them go hallelujah that's the same thing with us friends if God was unstoppable back then if he was unstoppable and then he comes to Joshua take the land did he take the land did he did he conquer he conquered he was unstoppable hallelujah all down through the prophets God was unstoppable doesn't matter what the devil tried to do God's victorious and then Jesus came the word became flesh I'm going to show you I'm unstoppable hallelujah unbelief didn't stop him culture didn't stop him pressure a family didn't stop him he had family here family pressure he's in a house preaching as breather in a tract call to him my mother and my brethren or without their calling for you he didn't come to that pressured you said those that do the will of my father they are my brother of my brother right and so so the religious of the day didn't stop him unbelief didn't stop her and difference didn't stop him death didn't stop him which no witchcraft whatever at war demons first didn't stop him he just plowed through he conquered everything he conquered hell death and the grave he says I've conquered at all I'm just going to rise up on high and I'm gonna give the victory to my children and I say down through the church ages the bride was actually unstoppable because she did what she was ordained to do even to die and go down to a dark age she was ordained to do this right so they were victorious because they fulfilled the would for their age and that makes a victory hallelujah and then here we are we're in a rapture season I mean we're in a wrap your season you know will will one stop because it says the Bakura she's in the book of Revelation to hold back the four winds and so I've sealed my servants so the war stopped I mean because now was going to come a season where where Israel had to be gathered back in as a nation are they there did they stand you know look at their founding battles the weapons they had or lack thereof and then all the Arab countries around them and the weapons they had and the lack they did not have all and then what happened God stood God stood for them his numerous accounts of the of the night was at 1948 war or whatever it was you know that War of Independence with his soldiers Israeli soldiers and they're just really militia yeah you know they don't have all the training like all the others and they're there and they're trying to hold off I think the was it your day into or will some of the Arabs and they run out of bullets and they just theater said well we're just going to die and then suddenly all the Arabs they they they were going to cry out Ibrahim Ibrahim and they could all skid they run off tuck tail and run and then these Israeli so well what happened here I didn't years later one of the Arabs meets one of the Israelis and they find out they're fighting in the same place they said yeah we were there and then Abraham stood up behind you let's bring giant man stood up behind you and we got terrified and we ran away numerous things happen like that yo yo yo numerous supernatural things happen God was there because he was going to gather his natural children and when the odds were stacked against them God said no no I'm doing this saying you cannot stop what I'm doing hallelujah now if that's just the natural people hey they'll be there you understand these 144,000 they're going to come forth but if the word said now Israel will become a nation again who's going to stop it happening right and if the Bible says the bride will come to her position his wife has made herself ready she's been a rain to her was granted that she'll be arrayed in linen clean and white the righteousness of saints who's gonna stop it where he's gonna stop a a bride that's cleanse that's separate from every spirit of the world all religion any any device of man and she spotless she's pure she's virtuous she's sinless as he is sinless hallelujah hey if the scripture says that he became me that I might become him by grace right he became sin for me that I would become the very righteous of God through Christ that's what the Bible says did he become sin was he your sin offering was he your sin offering did he take you your sins upon himself and went to Calvary and your sin offering well if we do that for you then the other part of the scripture is still still true hallelujah that if he became my sin offering I become his very righteousness I'll just say something I heard brother Harold Hildebrandt's at the first convention to ever win - I'm as righteous as God is righteous I'm a sinless as God as sinless Alleluia I'm just that's what the scripture says if he became sin for me I become his very righteousness of God through Christ hallelujah that's why the Apostle Paul can say stand up and say who can make charge the gods are linked it's God that justifies I mean it's God that justifies a god that calls a god that glorifies it's God's doing so you can they charge the devil rise up and say you did this and did this and did this it's a hold on Satan go talk to the judge holy because a judge doesn't just prove people guilty they prove them innocent as well hallelujah just like the woman's caught in adultery John eight brought before Jesus and and and they say rabbi we've caught her in the very act well where's the man but the devil waist twist what's going on where's the man and then so now he's that he's that he's the lawgiver who was on Sinai is now in flesh and they brought this woman before the lawgiver and before that on yo when he gave the Beatitudes he magnified the law I've heard of all time thou shalt not commit adultery but I say unto you a man who looks upon a woman to lust after her in this heart has committed adultery already has done the same act as if he physically did it with her you have heard of all time thou shalt not kill I said to thee if any man is anger against his brother without a cause he's in danger of hellfire amen so he magnified the law so he is now the lawgiver who's just magnified the law and this woman who's been caught in the act is now brought before her hallelujah this is what the devil tries to do he's the snare of the Fowler as caught one I've caught one what are you gonna do about it now because he's a judge he's a righteous judge right but then he begins to ride in the sand he probably want to know if he's left the right hand it doesn't matter but he began to ride in the sand he doesn't even and he just says he who is without sin cast the first stone and from the oldest to the youngest are pricked and make conscious because their memory begin to go I did this I did this I did this that person doesn't know I did this and they dropped their stones they walk off and then he just sits woman whereas I in accusers and he says she says they're all gone Lord Supreme One that's what that word Lord oh god they're all gone and and he says to her neither do i condemn thee go and sin no more so he judged her righteous hallelujah and so the snare court won but then when she was brought before the judge he just said no she's free the very ones who have brought the judge had tried to bring the judgment upon her actually judgment went upon them because they were they were now convicted than their own hearts and it's the same thing friends the blood of Jesus Christ doesn't just cover our sin it washes them free but then someone has to deal someone has to take responsibility and then it traces all the way back the sins that you did even willingly once confessed the blood of Jesus Christ and and and he changes your nature where does their sin go it goes on the head of the accuser it goes on the head of the accuser hallelujah and and the devil takes your judgment your punishment rather and he goes to lake of fire with the sins that he made you do hallelujah amen that's the power of this blood what a Thanksgiving hallelujah because there's only the white great white throne judgment will all boil down it'll come down to one person one person one person one person it's Satan who did all this but just like the judgment and the garden where did it come down to finally the serpent you did this within you're going to be judged you're gonna be turned into what we call a snake you were a beast you were an animal you could reason you could speak the Bible doesn't say that God opened his mouth like Balaam's donkey he could speak he could reason he had that he had that yo intelligence the vocal cords here the anatomy to speak into reason then he has turned into a serpent hallelujah so now I'm glad the devil's gonna carry oh it's all being returned to sender you'd better return it to sender to that said mates you're born with you say Lord take it from me I don't want the same nature because it's not just to be not just to be forgiven like someone who's fallen into great debt agreed you're a man of great wealth can come and pay the debt off but if they still have that same nature that caused him to fall into debt in the first place they'll fall into debt again but if the spirit of that rich man who's good with money comes into the one who who has been forgiven oh you're of the dead then they won't fall into debt again you following me I mean it's the same thing it's not just us being forgiven you know many many claim the cross of Calvary but they don't have the resurrection I mean too many claim the blood but what makes it glorious isn't just the payment but that he rose to prove that he paid it right he had the proof now I am the resurrection and the life and he resurrected out of the tomb saying it's been paid for I didn't many people have died many were crucified he wasn't the only one crucified in that day heaven the two thieves the Romans did it all over the place many were crucified but he's the only one who came out of the grave to really prove what he did hallelujah and it's the same thing with us friends when that resurrection life comes in to us I mean than we ever proof because he rose I've risen because the same resurrection life that brought him out of the grave is now and me and a well quicken my mortal body hallelujah lujah so the devil is determined to trap the bride upon the earth but he'll never do it because we have a perfect sacrifice we have a perfect blood we have a perfect word that is cleanse us of all unrighteousness amen so we are not trapped there's nothing holding us here I trust you can just look in your life and say no jesus paid it all I'm only trusting in his blood I'm only trusting in his sacrifice I hope you know I heard brother Bram I think it's in the rising of the Sun or the Easter seal comes down to the end of that message 1965 he says I would hate to try and get too heaven on my visions I'd hate to try and get to heaven on my preaching he says I'm not trying to get to heaven on those things but I'm getting to heaven because of the blood of Jesus Christ because of his sacrifice and the life that was released on Calvary is coming to me that's what I'm holding on to hallelujah no brother Brahim says in Christ a mystery God revealed and she and she alone stands by it the living word for this day that's why the devil's howling these great organizations set up something to close her up they'll never do it right there's a religious persecution upon the right there's a squeeze early coming into place as I said before the Jews did not wake up one day one day they're free the next morn that wake up there in Auschwitz a squeeze came upon them and it took it took a period of time it got worse and worse and worse then finally they were in the truck concentration camps right and the squeeze has already come upon the earth I mean I can't go into hospital and and pray for anyone you know I can't go I can't go into prison and just go speak to them right there's a squeeze come hallelujah so we're already but you could remember the third pull the power of the spoken word which is in us right the third pull is already in operation amen owes us what so brother Bram said what was manifested temporarily will come into its fullness when the squeeze comes on but many people are looking for a great they have in their mind some we're all in camps and this is all going on the squeeze is already here the power of the spoken word is in the brave right that voice is on the bride once again just like a Pentecost the world will hear directly from God through the Bride of Christ hallelujah so he says they'll never do it so that means close her up these great organ so that's why the devil's howling these great organizations set something up to close her up they'll never do it she'll be taken up not closed up she is now risen and by the power of the vindicated word promise to her amen now a bride holds that promise Hedrick he told me he'd return after me I believe it yes yes sir to meet her hitch her redeemer her husband her king her Lord her lover her Savior in the provided meeting-place he's got a place to meet them you know the bridegroom don't leave nothing out he's got the ring the identification he's got the robe that she wears her clothing seat and she's got the provider place to meet her that's in the year everything is all perming has been all provided he's got the wedding supper already set guests already invited already chosen all the angels are standing around his servants at attention oh yeah so she won't be we won't be closed up we'll be taken up now I just finished with this comment this is from the rising of the Sun he sees us I'm sure you see what I'm talking about it was waved over the people so the life of God was waved Dave Pentecost that wave sheaf offering the life of Christ was waved over the people and it was waved at those in the upper room said I'm gonna be like you're gonna make me like this God is looking at those people say I'm gonna make you like the wave sheaf offering God himself right and then now we've come to another season where that wave sheaf amateur life of Christ has been waved over the people this word has been waved over people and God did it as a memorial saying that this life that wasn't displaying the Prophet which is Jesus Christ will be manifested in a many membered body that they will come to the same maturity depends what part of the body you are but we'll come to our maturity right so I'm see what you're talking about it was waved over the people and the first time where it come forth for the bride age for a resurrection out of dark denominationalism will be a message that the full maturity of the word has turned back again in its full power and being waved over the people by the same signs and wonders he did back there because I live you live also speaking to his wife because I live you live also what a resurrection that was and what a resurrection this is to be quickened from the dead to be made alive in Christ Jesus by God's quickening power he was waved to them the word which he was was waved back to them on the day of Pentecost the word made manifest now I say he's to be waved to get in the last day Alleluia and has happened amen so the snare of the Fowler has been broken right the snare of death has been broken that's why we don't need to fear death we know this is one waiting ronbo when you're about to go through that vow there's one waiting to catch you and carry you through hallelu the same one who walks with you will take you through that door hallelujah so the snare of yo the snare of death has been broken the snare of religion has been broken hallelujah we
