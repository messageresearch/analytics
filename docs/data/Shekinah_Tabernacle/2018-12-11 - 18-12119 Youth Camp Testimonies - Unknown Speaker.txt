rains de patata the rain came down [Music] [Music] [Music] in the house [Music] the place is coming down [Music] the place [Music] a man made the words that one okay comp list you can have heavier seats this evening I mean it was there yeah the got a master on the sound s counselor down okay we are good to go so I am testing one picked up the children what day was a um Monday night so we meet here in the and at the front here and I think I've got about an hour and a half of destiny's from tubing and autumn and they were sort of fighting to get in you know that's fun winder would start a story and in the other one that would trigger something to the other one just a year this happen is sort of shun him often it was they had a lot to say so yeah let's uh let's have a testimonial to yeah and we've got the mic already so whoever wants to I wasn't at the camp [Laughter] so I have to backtrack before Kim so you all understand what happened there Kim I've been going through a period recited attacking me and saying oh life so good you must not have the Holy Spirit's you know so no attacks everything's awesome and then after they prior to the camp probably the first week I started thinking about it's a big drive down and why don't you get into a car accident you know like who's gonna look after your kids and would you love the Lord if you were crippled or would you like the Lord if you were in a bed and just like a whole lot of thoughts about what could happen driving down and then I thought of what if me and our man post died in a car accident driving down and so always the nights at 12 o'clock I was in my room and I was writing on a piece of paper if anything had to happen to our minds and tell us to be Hooven and Liam's Tuvok and just like kind of having something in place in case this actually happened because it was the Viet why I was really scared like it was like quite a fear you know and um I didn't I don't think I took it as an attack from Satan at that time so I thought it might be the Lord's trying to prepare it making me you know prepare yourself prepare you should have things in place in it so I'm I definitely bite you we prayed for protection win with me in a run to know ask the girls to pray and I didn't tell them how nervous I actually was to drive down and at one point we were on a passing line and our Munt had overtaken a truck and it was spiced for me to go as well and so I put my foot on the accelerator and I started going and the next thing this truck just cut cut us off and thankfully the Lord just obviously helped don't know how exactly it happened but I managed to get back behind the truck again and the girls will cut freaked out but again I didn't really let them know how freaked out I actually was because you know you also know the brother Branham says when you fear stuff than it normally becomes a reality and so when we got to camp I was so thankful haha we prayed in the car and you know and I didn't think much about it and then the one night brother Andrew was actually preaching in the first thing he took me on about was not having that faith in the Lord and having the fear and so I would help I'm quite convicted about that I was like oh sorry Lord and then he kind of just opened it up because I didn't know what it was until then and so he was like oh so Satan would have woken up on Thursday morning and be like oh oh they came happening oh he didn't get it cancelled you know we were supposed to do this and this didn't happen and they did it and he's like okay no no and he called all the Imps together and he's like you were gonna go and do this and you are gonna do this and I corner me but we said appertaining he in one day he said or he sent him to behave a car accident so that I wouldn't get him and it just all came together at that point and I was so thankful that the Lord heard my prayer and didn't look at my disbelief and why my fears but hurt my priest and kept her safe and God as they despite what the enemy was trying to paint so I praise God for he's he's just awesome he's completely wonderful [Applause] god bless the church I first would like to say thank you to our Lord and our Savior Jesus Christ for just working in our lives as individuals he does things for us that we don't know we don't expect but he's there for us so praise God for what he's doing in our lives each one of us comes our own way and sometime a hard way sometimes easy way so life throws us all this hard knocks and whether we accept it or we don't accept it he's there with us so he's fighting the battle before even we can enter into the battle to make us free so yes I just want to thank the Lord for ways brought me in ways placed me in my church life in my home life with my family with my family here as well he breaks down or breaks down everything that's in front of us that we put up we put up so it breaks all those walls was a wonderful weekend started on witness day from our church after prayer meeting the enemy tried to drop us down as well so my wife and my family weren't here with me on the plane meeting on witness day vo remember everyone was tired everyone weren't sure what they were doing he was throwing darts at all different angles but I was ready for the camp so I was standing in the gap for my family we loaded the trailer it started here got home locks didn't work ran around till midnight finding the locks for the trailer locked everyone's gear all our lovely ladies ball gowns in and all that locked it up kept it safe slept for about two hours got up and I was ready to go get all my family up oh it's too early you said four o'clock well it's three o'clock now recording but we left the home at 4:30 which is all good we drove safely picked up Rebecca from fielding and we shot it through armand was behind our hour and a half so they would selli i'd like to thank our pasta our church congregation and sister Chantal my wife for making it possible for all of us to get big as a church as a youth group going together as no one left behind so when we came if we look at our past our life one was left behind one was in one weren't sure where they are but it works now as a body working together no one's left behind so we wherever we needed this we got the support pastor stepped in he made it work I said to Hennelly smile at David oh I don't want to tell you she's not coming but she smiled at David and we went hey David hey so they've cut it for everyone to go and it was so wonderful so I go to the I got to the camp which was a extremely long drive and I agree with you we got the but everything changed so I was having wonderful time of fellowship by the time brother Armand King and lots of more people were turning up we met youth from Australia Vanuatu Christchurch Auckland you know it was just wonderful you'd come together first days but no one's talking like we're finding our way but the Auckland Church I showed us something no matter who you are from no matter what your age is no matter what you know what nationality or what anything that's gonna put up a wall they showed us how the world breaks down they loved and it's received everyone with the biggest welcome I've ever seen from the pastor to the youngest they received each one of us it was the respect the love they welcomed us with open arms and then brother Armand we had the opportunity to drop off the pastor taking the services okay what's his name what's his name talk know what his name so I said David he said something else name but when we caught me we don't know they cited now to be with this pastor driving him along not knowing how young he is and how the Lord is using him and you know what we in forward to know and we got him in the car and brother are mine was like popcorn but couldn't stop talking just always so excited just to be in the presence we were so excited you know like it's like how you said when it when we came on Monday we were so excited all right and I'm trying to get a word in but our mind is there and when either one our man is trying to get a word in so we were like fighting for the time we had with him in the car okay so we left the pastor and we got so that Thursday night but I mother I had time because the families were coming install or the uterus coming in from all over so there was not much happening on the Thursday evening so we had a meal the music right so we had a meal and we went back to our cabin which was separate from all the youth so we had space away from them so we left them to do what they need to do we found ourself a spot and we got a bench and we showed out and gave us time to bond we won and I could talk to each other comfortably had no problems I can talk to other brothers here but this was special for us we spoke things that we needed to speak about we shared with each other as to what the Lord is doing where is he bringing us how is he taking us through the journeys that we're going through through the trials that we're going through and we were so excited to share those things with each other and we shared for part of quite a few hours too late that evening and then we both had to pass and go go to our rooms which was right next to each other so I could have spoken like through the door but yeah electric Autobahn sleepy was but tired and then the Friday service started Friday service okay we set up the place for Adam and I were early we were on site so we helped the Deacons there to set up tidy up do boots and pieces get everything ready so when they come in is not a rush the average church is a little bit different they very relaxed very relaxed so they'll do things in their time and I think we got a little bit order so we want everything done prior so everyone comes they comfortable but all the league stuff I put together makes this big bonfire all right so we hug them out and we we got into this service on Friday night so we're waiting for our pastor who was driving so I'll pass her left work and four or five o'clock drove from Wellington just to come and support each other the Shepherd was there to come and support his children which was fantastic to see and so unfortunately he came at a few minutes past 12:00 and we just got out of the service so we started there about 7:00 we got out of 12 all right so we were lucky the service started and I thought ah you know it's a first service we will just enter in break the ice talk to different people you know pink again pink again he opened his mouth the minister opened his mouth he readies few words from the Bible and he started he came with a loaded machine gun and he had ammunition in cases he just got in he knew exactly who needed what he was in your face to tell you what you needed if you missed out turn around you see he would this aisle to the middle aisle to the outside he went around to let everyone know the Lord is speaking to them directly I mean the Lord is using him to speak to you so he came up to you you never said anything but he came up to you so you know that he was speaking directly to you if you didn't know you're speaking directly to you let me tell you he was speaking directly to you alright how Lord is so wonderful he knew every need in the church every youth that was they came with some kind of question some burden some unanswered prayer that they thought to be prayed for before but didn't get answered he broke down every wall Friday night service turned into Sunday service with a call for a prayer line there was no prayer line called the Lord came down the devil was at the door the lights went off but that sound and the lights on the stage didn't go let's came on went off again thunder and lightning where the Lord was kicking this devil right out he had knows no place to stand we walked out the church at midnight drenched but everyone it was we needed that water to come and wash us we were on fire in the church and when we came out he just gave us a cleansing and we walked through that and we never said Oh we'll go to our room no we're going straight to the dining hall we're all excited we want to share what can he do to you what is what do you about but I'll tell you every thing that I went there for I've got an abundantly but everyone and I shared intimate things and I can tell you those intimate things were brought over there because talking to you he wasn't sitting there with us that man of God wasn't sitting with us how does he know what we were talking about we even wake up and say to brother Armand did you talk about brother 808 things like this here don't just transpire the Lord knows what we were there for and he gave us that abundantly I can tell all of you it was a youth it was a youth meeting I think I had more fun than brother Arbaaz I can clearly tell you I think I had more fun than brother Armand my voice is coming back today but if you saw me on Monday it wasn't they I was trying to talk on the on the speakerphone when we traveling in convoy I couldn't speak because that's how excited we were and if you couldn't enter in in a service like that yeah but in saying all of that with a lovely Lord that we self we need to bring that liquefier home we need to start the revival here in our church for what I've seen the Lord do in Auckland I know the Lord is doing it here but we need to stop looking at my brother at my sister at the front who's behind me who's gonna complain stop looking around enter in like we entered in in Auckland the Lord is not only in Auckland young people the Lord is not in Auckland the Lord is here it gave us a church in the valley for a reason if you want to move out from move us out from the valley you've done it long time ago you would have made a way a long time ago the job in this valley is not complete we are placed here for a reason that liquify you got me that bonfire that started there it needs a start here we're not leaving it often we brought it with us therefore is giving us the opportunity to testify to testify is to give Lord our Lord God the price for what he's done in our lives so I encourage all you young people step of faith what you got in Auckland what happened we couldn't raise our hands we couldn't sing songs loud to the Lord as a deacon in my church I was doing my Deacon duty day in Auckland and I was walking around just checking my children all my children from one side to the other they were all spread out with different youth they were sitting with different youth which was good but I was making sure that my children are entering in and I can tell you Church I can tell you every one of our children got something from those services when I've seen that I knew for myself we can let go now because the Lord has got you I'm so proud to see how children entering him pulling on that word receiving that word and chewing it and eating it up and just having fun being themselves being free having the Liberty to praise having the Liberty to worship and having the Liberty to just pull on the Lord's word and use it because if we were there and we didn't get nothing out of it then we actually lost we went all that way for no reason and I didn't see that David I saw you as well Hannah I saw you the you girls I saw each one of you my children I saw y'all as well we would be for your our pastor as I said came drove midnight to come for your so at this time I'd like to put our hands together for our church congregation but more especially our pastor you supported us Thank You publicity yeah also me I first want to say thank you to God first and the inter and also the pasta and also church and the people who drove up like without you guys wouldn't be if we wouldn't be able to go there and for me I was too scared to raise up my hand and set up the church but after being me I was just free and I was able to do all of that I gave my life thank God for coming down you know these all those services and only thing for the bin for letting us all go yeah all our parents for letting us go to and it was just great we had the freedom to put up our hand stand up yeah on Friday night um the service was some massive um Hebron was standing up everyone got the Holy Ghost if they wanted it and the lights cut off but we still praise God yeah Brandon was free and it started to bring and thunder and um after that around left and um I walked all the way to my cabin by myself but I wasn't scared like I was walking in the pitch black white wasn't skipping sin you caught rows with me and yeah [Applause] I've been listening to all these testimonies that I've been feeling I should go up but I shouldn't scared okay well I've got a testimony to share and I want to share it tonight so on the Thursday we arrives and you kind of get to know everybody you know these new people that's a bit awkward and then on the Friday you're expecting a great day it's gonna be awesome it's just one news no it wasn't that way or Friday for me I expected too much and altogether the day wasn't really as good as I expected it to be and so when the service came I wasn't expecting a lot and so you know you sit down you pull out your notebook write down the date the pasta he gives this title you write it down and then you sit down and you prepare to listen you weren't just listening you are standing up you are shouting you're screaming you're screaming as hard as you could and you couldn't hear yourself everyone else behind you and at the end of the service you kind of got tired of having this yes sit down stand up sit down amen sit down yeah so you just put down your notebook and you stood up and you just stood there so I think a lot of skinny people went down to that camp well he preached on a lot of things that I was struggling with and my main reason for going to camp was to get the Holy Ghost because I felt that I didn't have it and I really wanted it yes well I got it [Music] I was standing and I was raising my hands and it was the pasta he has gone off because he was tired he started spitting up in the first 10 minutes of preaching to us it was that it that's much he just gave it all to us and he didn't hold back which was a place in because if he'd held back I wouldn't have received what I did and then I saw Naomi up at the front and she was jumping up and down and screaming and praising the Lord so I moved between the cheers oh by the way I would have said at the back but I've been told that you could only sit between anywhere between the first and the third run so I chose the second road on the first night and I saw Naomi on the first time I say I sort of pushed the cheese aside like gave her a hug let us thought you know I'm up here I'm enjoying myself I might as well stay up here so I stayed and they started singing and then I don't know how it happened five minutes afterwards I found myself on my knees praising God and you know you kind of feel bit self-conscious after I was shaking after the first five minutes of being up there you know you look kind of that way and you keep on frankly you look that way this there's nobody there I mean you look around you everyone's behind you on the knees screaming and praising God and it's just such a blessing oh I mean well I can't remember I just I was praying yes and then I feeling came down on me and I knew that I never needed to want the Holy Ghost again because I had it and that's a bit of a thing but I ran around the church scraping because I was a it was a listen coming to me it wasn't listening for me the villian I just enjoyed it so much and I've never ever regretted it and use the power did cut out and the the Thunder and the lightning and it was just it was amazing the way that God worked it's just wonderful and yes that's my destiny [Applause] before the camp some of you may know that we had a bit of the trial it was on the Tuesday night that um we couldn't all go and I know the devil was trying to take us and our family and trying to rob us from all of us kissing on the Wednesday night wasn't able to service but I was just praying and just it was so good because we were all able to go and just be free and so grateful and yes on the way up there yes I was praying for protection just trusting the Lord and when that happened when sister Chantel was talking about how we couldn't overtake we were yes shocked in but I just could see the hand of God just watching over us nothing could stop us going to that camp and for me that um the whole camp was a recharge yeah for us it's still hard but the fire still going I mean this might be my last camp before God's given everything I needed but that Andrew was talking about family curses and breaking family cycles Oh like that that's for us you know yeah and also forgiveness as well I had a lot of things built up it was quite a struggle but it was just that love that you could have for those who keep persecuting you even though your loved ones like yeah just thank the Lord that he got every need and I'm just so happy just thinking about the camp before oh it's just screaming inside oh so happy everything and put all your prayers you and I just want to thank also brother Ben and God for letting me go to camp like it's the past oh it's pretty I just get so excited and you just come sit down amazing it's like what I just needed just feel free you just you don't care by yourself anyway just think about it god like I was just amazing like the way God came down I also loved I'm at the end of the services like you got a chance to just praise the Lord and done something [Applause] hello everyone he had a great camp with lots of new faces lots of new people people from Salman Vanuatu he is pretty cool there was always generally like a lot of stuff to do they are quite like that like you weren't sitting down doing nothing and um I think one of the most favorite things I liked better was I'm at the Friday service when I was preaching all the lights turned off and all the people that were like shy and stuff they will some like praising God and everything yeah that's great hey that's pretty cool thank you I get excited amen praise the Lord like I made a list but I'll try to go for it fast okay God is so good are you so good that seed inside you remember what he said nobody can take it away so the whole camp theme is have you received the Holy Ghost but see that seed inside you they will cannot take away it's there it's just a time where the water falls and the Sun shines on it and it starts growing so if you don't feel you have the seat remember God place today you cannot place a day God places a day it's his work and it's a finished work okay so I just wanted to say that because that's what I've gone out of thing it starts with a burden brother bean we love you okay and we love you you do what you do and we'll keep on praying for you because it's someone that stands in the gap remember what that pastor ndred save is someone that stands in the gap and as a burden for the children that gets so much done behind the scenes that they can just forget about themselves as the testimonies sin and just worship our God and exactly that brother Cuban our church members they was prayer put into this thing this didn't just happen this was preordained by God this meeting was different and if you wanted to be set free he was there but remember he did not stay at camp he did not stay at camp because that pastor didn't come introduce a car of yesterday and he's not introducing a God of tomorrow but he's introducing a a prison guard right now okay so didn't stop the brother Andy you were preaching on walking on water we were walking on water okay if I ever said I'll keep this taste of money the Friday brother Cuban says I shouldn't go in and mix him there were the kids because it is for the children and we know parents they so so we basically just took the kids thing and you know as me I always want to be part of the kids and always want to get stuck in you know and and just because that's just my gift and brother Cuban wants when he sees that we just don't do it we now have to respect him let's take em and I want to say thanks while I'm on that for brother Andrew and brother Freddy and brother Ferdie and brother steward a brother Tazewell and rather Zion they're worthy they were brothers that were just they to serve the children and they were amazing at it and I've learned so much but I don't want to take away from this testimony so I could play with the children because I I see something I don't like and and I want to go and try to help so I thought I go and try to do God a favor now cuz I'm gonna now show them that there's all the brothers and we got the young brothers and all those things and I'm just gonna go play so we do play and somebody leaves the water-bottle day and I don't see it and as I grab the ball to turn around a step on the bottle and my toe folds under the bottle and with my white going over I step on my whole foot and and my whole big toe all the way down to two a year at the breech just it's just raked I knew exactly the moment I did it I knew like when you stepped on your on your knee you know this is not good so I try to shake it off I said no it's not and I'm Lord I just think you and I keep on walking and the very next step I try to stick my foot gives in and I know it's done I've hurt myself so brother Cuban comes and he sees me limping and this is just a deacon and I want to share this because these rules God sometimes put things in order for us not to go around him and I walk and buy the cumin goes what happened with you I said I know I just hurt my foot but I'm all right he said but I told you not to go there and it's true because I wasn't supposed to be there because God wanted us to fellowship that night so that what we fellowship the Buttkicker could come over the pulpit the next day and it was perfect brother Kimmy knows God is my witness it was perfect it was like brother Andrew was sitting between me and Cuban and even chatting with so that the night they said we're going to take the workshop for next day and we're gonna make it a bit earlier and they kind of just threw me into this workshop and I found myself with brother el ray and now we're giving this workshop and I open my computer and my whole presentations gone and I'm like oh Lord you know cuz it's just gone and I thought ah well anyways I'm gonna just say it as it is and I say it is it isn't I leave at thee and I speak about worship and I speak about to worship God in spirit and truth and they brother Andrew brings it out any sermon and he says you have to worship God in spirit and truth and this is very important and by the Ellroy cause I felt a bit like I was all over the show and I walked out of the there listen and I say to brother El Rey these words I said I just think I just kind of missed it a bit ugly I'm sorry because don't you worry you just do what God tells you to do you see ya and it's all he said and he had a sermon and I want you guys to hear it and he said remember when he says God picks up a glass and he cleans the glass and sanctification and in the glass is clean and he falls it with the Holy Ghost and he puts it into all and to work but only when he falls that he can put it into work so he's speaking about this and yet comes brother and when he preaches this very thing confirmation this is the night after that the next morning so God has in mind is the reason these things happen and then he said this thing and it make really have because he being jumped out of his seat ran from the one side of the truth to me to tell me this did you hear that he was speaking of brother Arawa okay so before we wait this is my testimony solo on a really shame I wanted brother either one to drive with us I wanted to go to either one and say it I love you and I know you love the children why don't you come with and we can feel if ship they just come with anyways and and Chantal asked me why don't you just ask anyone because you know he loves it and this is the truth so help me God is my witness and I say to Chantal and so I just leave it for now that very same day that was just a company I want to go with so we only had that seat left see Andrew had to be there but see he had to be there as well because I'll tell you this story anyone stood in this church and we've got it on tape and he said I was listening to that song undefeated he says and all I hear there is he was under this feet and he is under this feet and then he said if you're the skin on the pink of the tour did you say that was it your did it so the past away the unfurls brother Anderson I'm the skin on the toe the pinky under the the lift on that scheme this is the little Eve little toe it's just but I want to tell you one thing Satan is still under my feet and it could be a tough tough buddy which is good enough I will just help and so I hurt my foot really bad and I can't stand I can't walk I can't even put it in a shoe but you know what the preaching starts I'm sitting in the che and my foot like this and that's so man and it just feels frobbie and they're all dancing and I stand up and you you like jump on the one you know but you don't you know you can't really use it but you know what I sit down and he starts preaching and my foot goes numb you know when you're getting injection from the doctor and it all goes just numb you're just my foot feels like that the moment the preaching starts and I find myself as brother can be jumping behind the and running and my foots not hurting this much now I want to ask you what is that but now it's telepathy but when I'm in the service that doesn't matter and it's not adrenaline it's not interested because it happens before I get excited not when I get excited right so there's a difference and then and then just the last thing he said this he came up the first service and he said I want to play you guys a song and he said he played the song of one of her church member they buy them late and he says table we are through yeah and I promise you that Kemp said it for us all all our youth we say devil we are through god bless you and I thank you that the Lord has done so much days much more but I would talk the whole night if I do there but I want to say brother beam we pray for you and we thank you for everything you do for us and we see it he doesn't let the devil win it's amazing what can happen when we are all in one mind one Accord hot I experienced that at the meeting it's amazing when we can all get like that how the presence of the Lord can come down me the highlight was beautiful just having such a Liberty such a freedom to raise not a hand half way not one hand up that way but both both hands screaming shouting not worried who's on the Left who's on the right falling on the knees praying to a true and living God I've never ever seen something so incredible so amazing lives have been changed completely the Holy Spirit is seen on your faces I just stand amazed at the things that the Lord has done this weekend not only did he do for the youth he remembered the parents as well it was the filling of the Holy Ghost refilling for me so wonderful he didn't forget clearance as well and also he's a personal God so what he did for me was Sunday was my University so anyway the best thing we had to services so that after the preaching I was going to I wasn't going to shake the brother's hand in God he was sitting there he was ranged he was hiring he was panting no I'll just walk past him anyway brother bin was fish give him eat him spoke to him I was on the way out I turned I said no way this man has preached Jesus Christ he's got the Holy Ghost all over him I went I I put my hand out to shake his hand god bless you and I felt an instant what's so amazing and I said lord I just receive [Applause] I mean I was gonna sing that song he didn't let the devil win what a glorious time a menace Oh beast camp I've ever been to man sorry give me my Mountain so I'm driving up your finished work is someone seen driving up get north of taupo just as bucketing down lightning like lightning I never seen in this country before now sing well the devil's been cast out I get them just before midnight enter the dining hall just see everyone's faces and like Andrew came up to me he's like man I just did stuff in church I never did before oh joy Singh it says dancing and shouting and you know and but and so many of you said to me you missed out I'm glad I mean I'm sad I missed out but I'm glad you didn't miss out you know so it was glorious yeah thrilled my soul to see see how youth dominate the front row amen standing shouting rejoicing look on their faces like this is for me not just because everyone else is doing because they're doing it because God was speaking to them of ministering to them and it was glorious such a pull such a atmosphere and yeah we love we love the Lord glorious and so I think oh yes I turn up I said to brother Ferdie brother tears I said okay so you're gonna do this every year but it was wonderful and everything the Lord for everything he did yeah it was it was glorious and yeah I just think Lord it's wonderful may God bless you all love you all appreciate you all amen praise lon [Applause] anyone else no one from the family that came in slightly late okay this is not like I've been to lots and lots and what I witnessed at this camp I have never ever in my life witnessed such like the young people were like next level I have never seen the girls even was it was it you you were like running around Elizabeth was it no it was Hannah yes I was Hannah was sitting like a few seats down from me and I was just watching her like the worship and she just randomly took off because you could feel the presence you think it wasn't a joke it wasn't like something that was planned or rehearsed like her face he was just crying streaming down I was like wow like I was worshiping - I was looking to see like you know the other people looking at the joy and the reactions it was just really incredible to see and I'm really happy that I got a chance there's so many things I could say but it's just it's a lot it's you can I don't know where to start but it was just really incredible and like brother Ben said yeah I'm looking forward to something another camp happening um next year or even yeah next year cuz this year's ended yes so next year yeah [Applause] I know it wasn't at the camp but oh and and then as a parent you know um you just know the supernatural and you know it this earth is a battleground and you want the most for your children in life is to the Lord that they give them their life over to the Lord and they get their riches in heaven you know and they they just give them so oh and just a gift of eternal life and then to hear a heinous testimony oh I was so blessed Oh what can you say you know what grace and um I was telling her um when she told me I was like oh you know make sure to write it down and um and tell people you know and and it even rekindled a fire in my own self time um you know cuz you give your testimony so often and you get you you tell people that don't necessarily want to hear so you kind of get a little bit quiet about it and um it was really neat I was hi dad pointment today and I was I'm just in prayer and stuff and and before their appointment and I had this appointment in this this guy was sitting down and you know I had to give him information and stuff out of discs and things and um and I don't know how we got on the subject but I said are you a Christian and I not to tell me he was but I felt the presence of the Lord so strongly I started crying at this office and their hates the people not like oh I'm sorry I'm so emotional I do this at church I just feel the presence of the Lord and I go you must be a Christian he goes yes I am and he had also many computer glitches all we did was testify the whole time about Lauren I was so blessed and I had another thing I was blessed about was that day you left the children and I we were so blessed we had a little devotions and it was so when you were telling me the testimony about the car traveling we prayed that the Lord would put that same angel that was trying to stop Balaam you know with the donkey that big evening angel soared and we're praying put those angels around the cars you know and we just knew the Lord was with you and protecting you and yeah and I also ever think our pastor and the pastor's wife oh I'm just so thankful to the Lord Jesus we're bringing us here and it's such an amazing amazing family of God go please well yes I just felt like testifying and my high points as well as sister Vanessa was our young people the move of the Holy Spirit I have seen outpourings of Holy Spirit before this mother first time I have witnessed things like this and when it happened in the camp I knew what was happening the way I saw the Holy Spirit move with Hannah it's not something you don't make it up because the message was going on and once you're struck by the Holy Spirit there's no stopping you know at a point you know when the fire was I could not believe it that we have the opportunity to have such an experience to know that it's not man it's not us trying to work up something it doesn't work but when the Holy Spirit descends himself yeah that's nothing you can do about it there's no invitation there's no me making anything it just moves you so I'm really really happy that you were surrender to the Lord you know you went to be meeting with prepared hearts to hear and to take in the world you didn't sit in the seat of discomfort yeah you were there to worship that was the reason why the most visited here and I encourage you to keep on holding on keep on keep the fire okay you can close it before I just after I struggled men I wanted to be there I you can feel sorry for me but that's alright that's alright the Lord knows I I was I was there was a jealousy I watched those video clips of the half a heart I didn't want to even engaged in it because I knew but now this coming through this pulpit or this microphone I've I've led and I've been through multiple games I cannot tell you how many from South Africa I've been a little boy when my dad had to go through his spiritual walk and I was going along and I did my butt and all under this thumb and didn't national wing and everything I've done my own camps and New Zealand and in South Africa done it was Rodney seal I've done it with John William Davidson I've done it with heaps you do not you do not enter into a Friday night service or what I've heard now it cannot only be emotion and I was not there but from this I know thus saith what I know it is true I know that there was a movement thank you that you brought this back for us thank you that we can rejoice in what this is what any parent would love to see if you asked me in 2007 what would I want for my children would be rock star or a rugby player or something like that for the highest accolade I just want them to be filled with the Holy Ghost all I want all I want and it came over now and you can buy boys what we talked about last night [Music] that's the Lord that's the Lord and it's trials after trials and then the Lord had to keep me busy because I had to be here and there's more testimonies to come the the the fellowship that's going on in the nerdier house is good awesome alright so they will come something from there and we serve a living God yes now you can come across it's just a real man they can cry okay so this is my this is the finish of it okay I made some more notes but I try to finish because I know we need to do the play one thing one thing that stood out and that's what they slogan was at the camp it says if it is to be it's up to me and if it is up to me it is to be so if God started that work a man is gonna finish that work and I want to encourage you youth do not leave that lick a fire they too much happen okay we have no excuse to push this battle yeah we have no excuse one thing I learned from that faster then I myself to come board is if you stand back for the devil he will take that ground but if you go straight anew his face he has to go cause when the light shine darkness has to disappear so all I'm asking you this is not a feeling this is not an emotion I want to ask what happened they just carry all right there's no way that they will can steal that because the the pastor said on the first night is a devil we are through so that means we are through yeah that doesn't mean your barrel is gonna stop that just means it is a done work and just keep walking okay so you have no excuse to stand in this juice and not raise your hand to your Lord because if you've done it there's the same Liberty hair same Liberty and its effect was what you reap you will saw when you sow you will reap so if you want a blessing in church go get your bliss no excuse okay god bless you and you know what I'm worthy you worthy I promise you we count these things that we face the monies that we can be the whole night busy with yes and I know we got to do the play but everyone in this church was they everyone was they it was special and I'll never forget and I encourage you youth if you ever can go to a youth camp or a camp a family camp don't even not go because it does give you some and look forward to it but that youth camp is still here that same God climbed in the car with us and we're still here so let's have a revival guys please everybody Oh bless you made your experience I mean just keep putting wood on the fire Amen well this is close enough we're to pray then we're going to go into the play gracious Lord you've done so much for us lord we're so thankful for your moving of your spirit Lord that you're not dead you're alive you're praising here your God we thank you Lord you're not just back it off them but you're here in the Lord here where we live in us and through us Lord father when I see what you're doing Lord the fragile sweet Lord before you take us home well we want to thank you for it Oh God yeah Lord we just pray as we as we have they practice
