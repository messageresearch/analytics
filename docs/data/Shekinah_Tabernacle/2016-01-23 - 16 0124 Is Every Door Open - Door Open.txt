today God bless you yeah please thank you amen um you got your Bibles handy we'll just go straight to the scripture it's good to see you so so we had Sunday school back last week it's good to see everyone back and the the room's full and kids doing all kinds of things it's good to see amen um I like to go to uh um we're going to filimon it's only one one one chapter in Fon I just want to take a a verse there and I want to read from uh Revelations chapter 3 and then we'll go to Romans 12 if I can even find Fon thank you so want to take this first verse here from filon 1 verse one well just take this verse says Paul now Paul repeats this a few times in his Epistles he says Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ and Timothy our brother unto filon our dearly beloved and fellow laborer and then we'll go to Revelations chapter 3 and verses 20- 22 but notice he says Paul a prisoner and he says it a few times so Revelations 3 and: 20- 22 he says behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will s with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and am sit down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches and but how did Jesus overcome he said not my will but thy will be done that's how he overcame and then we'll go to Romans chapter 12 and we're just going to read verses 1 and two and that's the um Romans chapter 12 and verses 1 and two he says I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice wholly acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God Amen let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer gracious father we know you're here this morning Lord you're here to deal with us Lord you're here to speak Lord father you're here to mold us and shape us amen father may we be yielding to your Holy Spirit Lord father may we be flexible father may I be Flex and yielding to oh God lord father we pray as your word Goes Forth may it may it rearrange us Lord how you want us rearranged father may you do what you need to do in our lives Lord we cannot do it Lord it takes you the great Holy Spirit to refine us Lord to change us and to mold us Lord and father may you bless speaker and hearer Lord May the children be settled today Lord may we have attentive ears Lord and listening Hearts oh god father may your word find and prepared ground in our hearts oh Lord to bring forth a hundredfold dear Lord and may we walk out out of your presence different to when we came in Lord permanently change we pray that's my request oh god father we pray these things in Jesus Christ's Name Lord bless your word as it goes Forth please we pray amen amen amen you may have your seats now I want to I want if I could take a title I want to speak I just want to ask you the question is every door open is every door on your life open this is where we're going to go today so is every door open now who wants who who wants a greater walk with God amen amen who wants a Revival or a greater Revival amen now everyone wants that the Christian world you know it's it's like every time a coconut there's a prophecy comes out of a Pentecostal Church charismatic church God is going to move here we're going to have a Revival there's a great Revival breaking for and they and they're always looking for those things but the thing is uh you know people people want Revival but they're not prepared to be ready for the Revival amen so so the world wants all the power but they're not willing to give up what they have to give up to receive that power of that life amen amen so they want they want to stay in the state they're in and but then they just want to add what God can give to them but it doesn't work that way we have to empty ourselves out we have to get rid of we have to open every door if we want God to live you know he can't just be welcome in your entrance or in your kitchen or in your maybe maybe just one part of your life he's going to be welcome every part of your life amen amen you can't just you can't just take him as your savior he's got to be your Lord he's got to be your king amen Paul said Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ and he was his prisoner amen amen and God you know brother BR makes a statement he says he says Paul so this is in the sermon Paul the prisoner of Jesus Christ in 63 I'd like to make the statement that God always has to take any man that will serve him truly to be his prisoner a man has to surrender every ambition he's got everything that he is e everything his life soul body will Ambitions everything else and become a complete a prisoner to Christ who is the word to serve God you might have to walk contrary to your better judgment maybe a certain organization you might think that they could lift you up and give you something great that you might flesh but what do you find yourself you find yourself defeated after a while until God can get a man that's willing to become a prisoner to them God is looking for prisoners he's always done it you might search it through the scripture a man has to be a prisoner to Christ against everything therefore you cannot be connected with anything but Christ even your father your mother your brother your sister your husband your wife anybody you're only connected with Christ and him only then God can use you until then you can't going out sometimes I speak rough to people see I'm trying to get you to cut loose you have to have a starting place like I sometimes call about women bobbing their hair wearing these clothes and holding and maintaining their Christian profession you say that's a little thing well you've got to start somewhere so begin right there in your abcc and cut loose the worldly looks anyhow and become a prisoner to Christ and then just keep on Cutting Loose everything till finally the last lines Cut Loose then you are a prisoner then you become in his grip he's got you in his grip amen amen see now we understand we're in a battle yeah and it says in 2 Corinthians 10:4 for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds in Ephesians 6 we understand it tells us that to put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil so we're in a battle and in a battle you take prisoners you take land you take buildings you take hostages you know you know you take these things in a war and it's a Warfare between God and Satan we understand that so Satan's taking prisoners and God's taking prisoners amen but Satan takes prisoners he he tricks them into trapping them and then they're bound and then they realize that they're stuck but God Only Takes willing prisoners he doesn't take anyone against their will he will never Force the Holy Ghost into you he'll never Force Christianity into you he'll never Force anything upon you until you surrender and give it to him until you're willing to open every door in your life but if you don't open every door then he can't he can't do what he wants to do that's why I was praying there I said Lord do surgery this morning amen amen and and I always when I speak these things or study these things I always apply it to me too I I said Lord whatever has to happen just I want to open every door take it off the hinges God amen amen I don't even want it there Hallelujah yes now the word prisoner in the Greek it means to be a captive as bound so someone who's bound up now a prisoner now now if you think someone who who who has to go to prison a prisoner is someone whose life is totally out of their own hands yeah they are not in control of where they live they're not in control and where they go They're not in control of what they eat they're not in control of what they wear they're not in control of the things they do all of those things are out of their control they have no say you know have you ever you know imagine a prison trying to get to the warden's office I want a change of cell I I don't like these stripes or whatever they wear I don't know I want better food sure they all would voice those things but the warden will say no you're my prisoner this is not a democracy and a you say I say we meet an agreement no you're in prison amen and the warden dictates the conditions of the prison and what they eat and what they wear and what they do and if we're a prisoner of Christ remember a prisoner someone someone who's on the run so for example if you had control of any of these things that you can choose where you go you're not a prisoner you're free to move that's right you know where you sleep and what you eat and what you do you're not a prisoner because your yourself is in control of something amen so someone who who is on the run is not a total prisoner they have to be totally you know sleep here now yes eat this now yes do this now what's happening now you're going to do this and they have they can fuss about it they can fight about it but they're still prisoners God is looking for those kind of people this is what God this is what this is what it boils down to the bride of Christ will be a prisoner every part of her life every part hallelujah what she or he wears yeah amen what they do what they say what they watch every part amen every part of your being doesn't you're not your own the scripture says you're bought with a price every part well I have a right to wear these clothes or wear these shorts or cut my hair or do whatever no you don't that's you may but if you're a prisoner you don't and if you want to be a prisoner you say not my will but thy will be done amen you you got to be willing God is looking for people that will become prisoners to him amen you have to be willing now in a war there is ground that you have to take amen there's territory that you have to drive the enemy out of and if the enemy's been so so you know if the enemy is still in a place but you say well I have the majority of control you don't have full control there's still a dispute over the territory amen the enemy has to be fully driven out of a place and you can say this belongs to me yeah and it's the same thing if you take that at a piece of ground or a building or a city you know every every building every room has to be cleaned out of enemy yeah otherwise there's still a dispute Who belongs to what now it's the same thing with you and I there's more than just one chamber to you you're more than just one room that's right amen that's why people accept them as savior but they won't make him Lord amen and they may just make him Lord over a few things you can have this part of me if that's the case you cuz you're the you're your own enemy that's right amen before God met you you were his enemy you were scripture says we were enemies of God Amen that's right so unless you're willing to surrender see a prisoner does this I have no weapon in my hand I Surrender amen but so so in order to say take this building you'd have to clear every room you'd open have to open every door now God doesn't bust down doors you have to be willing to open you have to be willing to let them come into any part of your life yes sir amen and we're going to go into some stronger things but I want you just to keep all these things in mind so you have to be willing to open every part of your life oh I want Revival are you willing to open every part if you're not willing to open every part God's not going to pour himself in amen amen now the human heart is exactly the same way as a building you know there's there's there's more than one door to the heart and Jesus has to have full access in order that that life to become a prisoner to his and the scripture says for for as he thinketh in his heart so is he the first part of that verse proverbs 237 so it's not it's not in here remember brother brah he speaks about a man has a conscious and a subconscious and it's and and he says it's like a ship so there's the man who's driving the boat who says Go full steam ahead or reverse or whatever and then that order goes down to the engine room remember in the old days they'd have a they'd have a you know acceleration wheel thing and then that would turn up PSA to go full steam ahead then the same thing would happen down the engine room full steam they say okay boys shovel the colon yeah and that's how they drive the boat but it's so ultimately it's not the man who's steering the boat who is actually in control control it's the man in the engine room because if the captain says full steam ahead but all the guys in the engine room are sleeping with their shovels there not pumping any colon the boat's not going to go anywhere it's the man in the engine room that has control so it's not the man it's not the man up here who mentally wants to be right it's this man that's right this man down here is in control in your heart I mean this part of you cuz many people verbally say I believe the message I believe the word I believe Jesus up here but it's got to sink down into here yes and when this man says I give up am amen then God has control of the boat amen amen glory we want to we all want to go on a Rapture amen we all want to be his this is this is the one thing you must be born again amen and to be born again you must be willing to open every door to to truly be birthed now he says Us in do in uh he says doors and door and 65 if you haven't listened to this go listen to it now you say is that right brother Bram sure if I invited you at my house and you come in the door and you knocked at the door and I looked outside I said yes come on in if you can help me well you do so but now when you come in now I don't want you middling around in my house um you stand right there at the door you remember our text is doors inside the door now inside the human heart there's many little doors and them little doors cover up a whole lot of things my just to let him in that isn't all of it when he comes in when I come in your house if you welcome me in the door why you'd say come in brother brand I'm so glad to see you I'd say well it's a privilege for me to come into your house oh won't you come over and sit down brother B go through our house make yourself at home oh my I'd go all over to the refrigerator get me one of these great big sandwiches about like that take off my shoes go to the bedroom lay down I just have a gastronomical jubilee see why it's because I feel welcome amen you made me welcome therefore I'd appreciate it if you made me welcome but if I went in your house and you told me you stand there at the door now don't you go to midling around I wouldn't feel too welcome would you no see you wouldn't feel welcome invited you in said now wait you yeah come in but stand right there now there is a little door when you go into the human heart we'll speak about a couple of them he says we don't have uh time to go all through these doors cuz there's lots of them see but say in the next 10 minutes let's speak of a couple of three doors now on the right side of the human heart when you walk into the door there's a little door on the right hand side and that's called in there the door of Pride oh my don't you go into entering into that door they don't they don't want the Lord in there on that door that's Pride I'm a blue blood I don't care oh yes now look see it's Pride don't you Meddle in there he can't feel welcome as long as you keep that Pride door shut he's got to humiliate you see that's what he comes in for you mean to tell me I have to go right down there and act like the rest well you don't have to that's one thing sure well I'll tell you what do you think I'll do when I go to the Business Council next time what would I do if I meet my employer tomorrow I'd have to get that Spirit on me and jump up there in the middle of my work and go to speak in tongues and it would humiliate me no stay out of there oh there you are see yeah you'll let Jesus come in you'll join the church put your name on accept Jesus as your savior but what about being your lord when he's got full sway see he can only be your lord if he's got full sway he can't have a little he can't just have you know a kingdom is not you know if this country rose up and said we're a republic well the Queen of England isn't Queen over this nation anymore amen or if there's a dispute like a civil war breaks out or something you know then then this place is disputed she's not fully Queen over the domain amen and if there's part of you that's actually say no you can't you can't rearrange this part of my life God that he not your lord yet when he's Lord he's or It All Belongs to him see you've completely surrendered to him now but that little pride oh you you mean for us woman we have to let our hair grow well that's what he said now if you read 1 Corinthians 11 it says about long hair and that word long in the Greek means select grow and it's only used twice in the Bible in that in in that verse and it says if you cut it you might as well shave it off he says and the hair is given for a covering amen so to let grow is to not to cut it that's what the scripture says so that's why he says it oh we're going to have to quit wearing manicure or or makeup stuff that's what he said well what do you think about sewing Circle wood what would they that'd call me old fashioned praise God now you may think you're going down a legalistic line but I'm going to show you no it's not I'm going to get to it because if you let him and and in this in this message you hear him he says you let him come in and do it yes amen but you have to be willing to open the door oh he oh I'm waiting for him to change me have you opened the door if you haven't if he hasn't changed you you haven't opened the door that's right it's really that Elementary yeah amen amen well just keep your pride go ahead he'll stand at the door that's all the father he can get but when you really open that door let him come in he'll clean it out of you shorts will go out of here in the garbage can and makeup will go back to the garbage can and the bar will starve to death if he's just got to cut woman's here to a real believer now I'll say oh yes it does too that's what the Bible said that's right see there's a little word there that you don't want a meddling well my pastor I don't care what your pastor said that's what the Bible said it's a shame for a woman to do so well you say you ought to teach us things brother bandam it's how to get the Holy Ghost and how to do this how you going to learn algebra if you don't learn your ABCs he's your example try to be like him and the spirit in you the spirit in you will help you to do that make your life like his yeah there's a door there I want to call another door door there's another door there just next to that door that's the door to your private life oh you don't want him messing with that now I want you to go he says now if I want to go out to a little cocktail party what is it to you what church is going to tell me what I'm going to do ahuh there you are see a tenth of my wages who's going to tell me what to do that's my own private life I make this money I have my own life I'll wear shorts if I want to that's my own American privilege I'll say New Zealand privilege whatever nationality you want to put that is true sure but if you're a lamb not a goat SE a lamb is what he's after now a lamb have you ever who's who's ever worked on a farm who's ever done docking who's ever picked up a lamb who's ever picked up a lamb now I done some docking in my life growing up help help pick up the lambs now when you pick up the lamb he struggles a little bit just a little bit but when he feels your firm hands he quits he quits fighting amen when he feels your firm hands he just you know he just doesn't kick and so they only kick a little bit if you hold them Loosely but if you hold them tight they just give up who's experienced that you understand so you've got to realize that he has you amen you've got to that's the reason people kick and they say well I don't I don't know if I can do that you got to realize that he has you amen because I believe I'm looking at lambs and Lambs only check if they if if they don't think that the person's got them but as soon as you pick them up tight they feel your I was just a boy when I did it I wasn't like that I was like 10 picking up Lambs helping them dock the Lambs but you know you've got to realize that he has you and and if you realize that he has you you won't kick amen he you know you won't kick but if you don't realize that he has you you'll keep kicking he has you amen you're engraved in the palm of a of his hands the scripture says amen he says can a woman forget her child yes maybe but I can never forget Israel and you're the spiritual Israel amen amen you got to realize that he has you there's the same just continue down the same quote a sheep has wool that's the only thing it has and it can't manufacture that wool you're not asked to manufacture the fruit of the spirit but to Bear the fruit of the spirit and as long as it's a sheep it'll bear don't have to manufacture the glands and everything's in the Sheep it'll make the wool because the inside of them has the glands and the adrenaline and the stuff that makes wool and when you're a Christian you'll cope with the word I don't care what anyone else says you don't have to work up nothing and bring down nothing pull and pump up you're a Christian you just automatically bear the fruit of the spirit see and that's the way it is see but people today they don't want you fooling with their private life only thing you do just just open up every door around and say come on in Jesus watch what happens when you see in the book you're supposed to do this you'll do it why you're a sheep to begin with but if you just want to sit keep him at the door just say see this is this is just keeping him at the door just say I've joined church I'm as good as you see I've accepted Christ or I've just added this in here I've accepted the message I've been baptized I believe brother BR is Malachi 4 maybe that's just what You' done but did you make him Lord amen did you make him Lord you have to be willing because let's go to 1 Corinthians 13 Paul was a prisoner amen he's looking for prisoners you say have you made him have you just let every door have you opened every door amen because I believe I believe God it says in Hebrews I think 13 our God is a consuming fire amen so if there's something in your life that you just can't seem to overcome open the door let that fire come in and consume it amen amen I believe I believe God is present to purge whatever needs purging you just have to open the door amen amen 1 Corinthians 13 and verse1 now these when it speaks about charity here it speaks of divine love and it's saying about this is the attributes it comes down this is the characteristics of divine love cuz every says well we love one another and we do love one another but as I said I think maybe last Sunday don't just you know well you say well we have love for each other in the church absolutely we do cuz God's present but don't just don't just put that as the as the defining thing well that means I have the Holy Ghost amen because you can just be part of I could say you could just be part of come under the anointing that's in the church and because you're under that anointing you say well I'm part of it I'll say this Israel coming out of Egypt they're under an anointing they all Miriam took the tambourine after they crossed the Red Sea they all danced and had a wonderful time and they could say well I came under the anointing therefore I'm going to go into the land but when they came to the land when they came to that judgment seat of kades barer will they take the land they said no we cannot take the land but they're all part of the church you got to think about you know you got to go beyond you got to go beyond you know I just love everyone we must if God is in here and you come under the anointing of the Holy Ghost you will love one another amen but it has to be it has to be it's more than that amen amen if the spirit in you if the spirit that wrote the Bibles in you yeah you have the fruit of the spirit you have the character of Christ you will love one another you will cry out for the Abominations done in the world and and and cry you know have a burden for lost souls you will do all those things but ultimately you got to have all of that if the life is in you it'll Express that and then you cannot deny in here cannot deny this because the Same Spirit wrote this word amen amen but some legalistic people say well you got to cope up the word but there's no evidence of the life I'm not taking one you got to take the whole thing amen amen right amen see and you say well I can't I can't I can't there's things in here I can't do yet open the door amen just let them come and do amen that's all you need to do God help First Corinthians 13 He says verse one now look at Paul here this incredible I speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not charity remember Divine love and I become as a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol and though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all Faith so that I could remove mountains and have not charity I am nothing so he's actually saying because some people say remember you got to take the whole thing some people say when the spirit of Truth has come you Alle you and guide you into all truth absolutely so some people validate their experience with God by saying I understand the word I'll show you what it means he says here without divine without the life of God in you you can understand all Mysteries y can you can hey you can just go on the internet go Lonnie Jenkin some other Bible teacher you know and you can learn their Revelation that's right and it's only learned Revelation doesn't produce any life right yeah and you can listen to the message and because people have given their lives to put it all together right amen so you can just learn what they have some of them mentally just learned it but others have it's been a revelation to their soul and their life has shown on it and so you can just learn what they've put together and say I understand amen and it becomes it just becomes another Bible school if you just learn it so he says that I know all Mysteries and in the days of the voice of the seventh angel all Mysteries should be finished y amen and we must also remember before we continue reading the word of the lord always comes as I said you got to be willing to be yoked up with the word amen you and the word have got to become one when you ask the question whose interpretation of the Bible should I yolked with the Catholic the charismatic the Pentecostal just a whole take all of them and bring them together no the word of the lord always comes to the prophet I'll do nothing until I reveal it to my servants the prophets Amos 3:7 amen so a prophet a Vindicated prophet's word becomes the interpretation of this amen that's right is that and so we have to so whatever that Prophet says this word is then you have to subject yourself to his interpretation amen oh that's just blindly following a man no it's not it's God's system all the way through Moses had the interpretation cor and Dayan raised up said you think you're the only holy man in Israel we're all holy amen we all can hear from God and and God said to Moses separate yourself and the Earth swallowed them up amen but Joshua and Caleb recognized that the words came out of that man's mouth that was God speaking to them amen and they subjected themselves to the Revelation that came out of his mouth and they took the land amen and Paul said to the Corinthian Church them that are spiritual among you let them recognize that Comm the Commandments I teach you are the Commandments of the Lord amen amen so the spiritual on had to recognize this is not Paul's idea this is this is God's idea and he's the one who placed law and Grace and wrote most of the New Testament and and the true church in that day and in this day must yield themselves to his interpretation of the word yes sir and brother Brandon because he's a true prophet of God preached the same thing Paul preached amen so you got to be you say well he's from Kentucky he says all these different things you got to recognize it's not him saying these things he says many times he says no if I've said that I can't I'd be very bold to make this challenge he says no if I a true servant of God and I've told the truth let him he says he's obligated in one place God is obligated to come and back up what I've said and then the pillar of fire comes down into the place hearts of the people have discerned all these different things God comes down confir his word over and over again amen that's a bold statement and he said it more than once in front of thousands of people if I be the true servant of God let him come and vindicate what I've just said and God Vindicated God is actually saying this is me speaking this is me speaking this is not him speaking this is me speaking so the you say all of is stuttering and all these different things no it's the Revelation contained in in the message is perfect yes amen amen it's the Revelation contained so if you have that revelation this is not him speaking it's not some new doctrine being cooked up but it's the words being open and the word comes to the prophet to reveal it to us hallelujah so then you got to say I have to yield myself whatever he says amen I'm got to yield myself to what he says y amen amen that's right they had to do it in Paul's agej they have to do it you know you had all the way through the word of the lord always comes to the prophet amen so now is that okay that's just because otherwise otherwise we're just another denomination and we have a council of opinion and academic idea and thought that's not God's program that's never been God's program and it never will be God's program especially not in this day amen amen oh what about Martin Luther and all these things they were anointed to open the word to people it was still God's Channel but then what happened Luther died they they made an organization then they make Bible schools and they just go down the the same rut that the you know the generations before them did and and you hear Brother BR he says the Pentecostals in his day he said if the first genuine ones rose up from the grave and saw that the very thing that they came out of their children and the generations after have gone back to that vomit as a dog you know turns to his vomit and a hog to its wall he says you've done exactly the same thing what they do make Bible schools and it becomes an intellectual understanding of man that is not there's no Vindication in that what has God backed up that's right because whatever God backs up you should listen to amen and this message has been over Vindicated hallelujah it's been over again and again and again amen you can hear it on tape amen Now 1 Corinthians 13 sorry we go back there he says and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor this is verse three and though I give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing so he's saying even though I do all all these religious acts and I help help my you know help feed the poor give my body as a you know I'm going to be a m for Christ you got to be careful do you have that charity or is it just some religious spirit driving you because if if you don't have that Divine love it profits me nothing now this is the attributes of this charity suffereth long and is kind charity envieth not charity vaunteth not itself is not puffed up that vth means the boast to be a bragger look at me in my religion look how great I am right amen does not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil rejoiceth not in iniquity but re Joes in the truth beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things if you've opened every door this is you amen if you've opened every door he comes in this is you now sure we fall and fail all these different things but there should be something in you amen you know I used to watch a lot of movies listen to what you know a lot of music watch a lot of TV r18 all that stuff before I met the Lord I enjoyed it yep I'll just say amen for me I did I'll be honest but then after I met God there was something came in here said that is disgusting amen and I want to have nothing to do with that and it wasn't IL legalistic thou shall not thou sh there's just something in you you know when you grow up who likes broccoli who I mean who doesn't like broccoli I do like broccoli but I'm just raising my hand okay now you think there's something in you that doesn't like the broccoli yeah it's green amen so you think there's something in you that doesn't like the broccoli I don't I remember and my daughters do the same thing when I was young I never tried the thing I said I don't like it I don't like it I remember doing that being young and they do the same thing never even tried it it's the same thing now if there's something in here that like broccoli I need broccoli and I do like broccoli there's something in here that likes broccoli amen but if there's something in here that says I can not stomach that amen I won't eat it you take that from food you take that into everything you take it you know you take it into the you know just like why don't it's not see I don't have TV not because Thou shalt not watch TV I in here is repulsed by what I see even between documentaries there's all kinds of stuff they just throw in there I mean you see you know you you see Disney Channel there's there's there's Mickey Mouse and all these different things and then in between time there's rock and roll and dancing and all this stuff to catch the children right amen so what if there's something I'm if there's something that's in here that says I don't like that and I'm a prisoner I'll say yes Lord amen that's right amen even if the flesh likes it that's why entertainment's so big cuz the flesh likes it and we're still in this flesh but if there's something in here that that this has been taken captive yeah and something in there says I don't want that anymore I say I don't want that anymore there's nothing in me that wants it I know I've shared the testimon many times about drinking but after the Lord after I opened every door and he took it out of me there was nothing in me that said there was nothing in me that wanted it anymore I didn't have to go oh no you know there's nothing in me that wanted it really amen but if I hadn't opened every door and the thing is when it comes to opening doors now the reason that people do not is they begin to reason yeah and people's reasoning always boils down to I'm not as bad as someone else amen this is how reasoning because to reason you have to have something to compare with yeah y That's why you know you look at where do we go on holiday then you begin to reason well I like this place cuz it cuz this other place doesn't have this so you go here you reason and then people don't open every doors because they reason I'm not like this person or I'm not like that person now I'm going to come to that in a little bit let's just go to actually let's go to that then we'll drop down to to something else now let's go to Second Corinthians no actually sorry before we go there let's go to Matthew chapter 7 mother just this is how it came to me so this is how it's coming out so Matthew chap 7:21 people always reason this I'm in the message they're still reasoning amen I'm the bride there's still reasoning amen so you got to and the word says what to cast down reasoning am because if you reason you say I don't need to change amen if the Lord saying hey the word says I say this because it's not you know when God speaks he doesn't say the word he says I'm saying this I want to I want to lift you higher than what you have am me I want to take full control I want you to be my love prisoner right that's it but then there comes a people Matthew chap 7 and we're 21 down to verse 23 so this is Jesus speaking he says not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven what is his will for you Lord open every door I want to open every door to you take full control of me amen amen amen that is and and if if you do that then you will be doing the father's will because you're not doing your own will there cannot be two Powers ruling at the same time it can't be your carnal nature and God ruling you one has to die for the other one to come amen amen many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many MTI I mean many wonderful works and then will I profess unto them I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity now often we take the scripture and we say well that's denomination that's false anointed ones but it has to apply to everyone and so there'll be people now and this is just like the Rich Young Ruler he begin to reason he said Lord what must I do he said good Master what must I do to have eternal life and and Jesus said you know the Commandments you know honor thy father and mother do all these things and he says I've kept these from my youth and Jesus Jesus if he was lying Jesus said you're a liar you're a hypocrite amen but Jesus didn't dispute that he actually acknowledged by not saying anything that he was telling the truth amen he was a good I'd say Christian believer he was a good message believer amen cuz he kept the word of Moses but he said this is the one thing you lack sell all you have give to the poor take up your cross and follow me now it says in one place he ranted Jesus so he actually planned the whole thing now when he comes this way then I'll be a to intercept that I'll get my chance cuz there's always people around him so so he he planned this meeting but then when Jesus began to talk to him like this what happened he be to reason because if he didn't reason he would have said of course and he would have sold all he would have taken up his cross and followed him but he began to reason he said but I can do good with what I have I can help people more if I just keep my business keep my riches you know and he begin to reason and the reason he was he he he walked away said he wasn't willing to do it is because he wasn't willing to open his heart every part of his life he had opened it a little bit cuz he was a Believer amen but when it came to his personal life his pride of what will people think of me when I give all to the poor what will my parents think of me or my you know you know my friends so he wasn't willing to open that door now to do iniquity iniquity is in the Greek it's a violation of law so so it's a or or it's to trans or it's a transgression of the law now in order to so so this is in my language to work iniquity is to know something but don't do it amen I'm just going to bring I'm I'm bring this right on home amen so if someone is a worker of iniquity Jesus comes along and he says I want all of you but then if that person begins to reason and say well I don't need to change a part of my life even though he puts his finger on it that is actually a worker of iniquity if you're not willing to give all of you amen then that is because it's the because you must open every part of your life and then he can take you as a prisoner but then if you're not willing to do that remember it's to to to know something but not to do it amen and the only way that we can really be prisoners of Christ is to give all every part of our life amen so so actually to hold part of yourself back is actually working in equity because these people because no doubt these people you you know brother Bram he you know he tell stories like people they you know God God gets a hold of them and then they you know maybe go to a church and maybe they start preaching but then they come across like the truth of the baptism but then they begin to reason and say well if I begin to teach that then they'll kick me out what is that to know something but not to do it that's a worker of iniquity and you see these people have reasoned because no doubt when the truth came their way they said but God is blessing us we see the sick being healed you know we've seen prophecy come true we've seen all these different things they said Lord Lord have we not prophesied in their name cast out Devils done many wonderful works and he didn't say no you're telling a lie he just says the from me you that work iniquity I never knew you so he didn't say they actually making it up that was genuine Miracles done the devil was genuinely cast out people genuinely healed prophecy genuine prophecy happened amen but so they begin to reason but God's blessed me I see the hand of God in my life amen I see him come on the scene when I pray but he answers my prayer amen amen so they begin to reason and then they ended up in this state amen and Paul says do not shun to declare I have not shun to declare the whole counsel of God so I cannot shun to tell you these things amen amen that you don't want to begin to reason and say well I understand the word now I have a closer walk with God now and I've got a better family now and everything's going better now don't begin to reason when he's calling you higher the reason he wants to you to open the door of every part of your life is because he wants to lift you higher than what you have am amen but then the problem is now uh let's go to 2 Corinthians chapter 10 I just want to read this let's just read the scripture together see they reason they reason with them you know that's why they ended up in that state and I I said before reasoning always it boils down to comparison yes yes and we see this now in 2 Corinthians 10 and and and and verse 12 oh I mean 1 Corinthians in sorry made that mistake last night he says this here first Corinthians I'm sorry sorry 2 Corinthians um chapter 10 and verse2 now is everyone there yeah he says for we dare not make ourselves of the number or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves but they measuring themselves by themselves and comparing themselves among themselves are not wise amen amen so if you compare yourself so for example if I compare myself with someone else I'm not wise amen amen well I'm a better believer than this brother I'm a better believer than you know my family is in better order than this family right you become you're not wise that's right Paul says You must never compare yourself with yourself amen or commend them or or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves how do you commend yourself I'm the best look what God's shown me I had such a great time the other day amen amen that is commending yourself Jesus said pray in secret that you'll be rewarded openly don't be like the Hypocrites that pray on the street corners amen many things I think you know people who really pray in secret and then they just see God's hand in in different situations they say praise God Amen and that's what Jesus said pray in secret and then you'll see it openly what happened and then he gets the glory not you yes because remember the problem you know this is why the prophet had to be Tak it off the scene 50 odd years you know you 50 years ago just say if he was still alive today and he was still preaching no doubt we all would make like it be like a pilgrimage to Jeffersonville or wherever he would be it's oh brother BR you would be so caught up in the man but Jesus never wanted us to be caught up with any man he was just the one to induce us to Christ and then we become one with Jesus Christ the word amen amen so we're not caught up in in in the man but it's the message that he brought which is Christ amen so he had to be taken off the scene that people stop raising up men to follow yeah amen right because then you begin to you know and then that's how things can happen as if we put now we should put confidence in one another and when you say brother sister pray for this you're not approaching the person you're approaching the god in the person amen and we should absolutely do that yeah you understand but then if we lift up someone out of their wrong position and say I'll just get brother son sister s to pray for this it'll all be over no you've you've actually lifted them up you understand sure there's a there's a there's a right way of do you know you know there's Ministry and different things that you know you should say pray me you but if you liftt people you if we gather around personality I'll put it this way if we gather around a personality you know of any believer that's wrong yes because we begin to compare ourselves with them that commend themselves how do they get in that position to begin with they begin to commend themselves and charity does not boast itself amen so if we compare ourselves with ourselves we're not wise amen that's right and the you Proverbs chapter 4 it says the principal thing wisdom is the principal thing therefore get wisdom and with all thy get and get understanding so so if we compare ourselves well our church is better than this church or our church I wish it was like that church or you know or I wish our music was like that music I wish our preaching was like that preacher or you know we're comparing ourselves with ourselves and we become I just say foolish amen amen we should never this is the mirror amen if I had a message book it's to me the same thing it's it's revealing Christ in here amen that is the mirror but if we compare ourselves with this then we become wise amen amen and then it says even in the scripture I don't have it actually I have the link I made some um I have uh no okay okay so to compare in the Greek it means to measure and compare which is you must study what you're comparing uh to to actually weigh it up so to compare you actually have to study you have to observe it but in second Corinthians 3 and8 he says but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord had changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord so if you are comparing yourself with him amen if you're comparing yourself with him we actually changed from glory to glory and this word change in the Greek is actually where we get the word metamorphosis from you're actually transformed amen amen but if you compare yourself with some brother or sister you are not going to be transformed amen you just having your heart well and then if you go down that road you end up like the I believe it was the um Pharisee and the Publican that went into the temple and the and the Pharisee prayed he stood and prayed and he said uh you know you know he prayed within himself down as the man thinketh in his heart I thank thee that I'm not as other men are exalters unjust adulterers even as this Publican I fast twice in a week I give tithes to all that I possess so this is remember he's he this man is actually foolish he's not wise because he's comparing himself with everyone else around him I thank you Lord I'm not like this guy and this is this is where this is where this leached if you compare yourself with yourself yeah that's right amen a proud arrogant Pharisee and look at the works I do I thank thee Lord I'm not like this other person in church I listen to three messages a week I take notes amen I come to every meeting amen I thank you I'm not like this guy I'll just put it into today's language all those things what he did all you know he says you know I fast twice in a week I give tithes of all that I possess all those things are fine amen all those things are good but what he had turned it into he was reasoning now I do these things I'm a better religious person than this guy I'm a better believer than this guy then the Publican comes in and he and he was a standing a far off he could not even lift as much of his eyes into heaven but smed his breath saying God be merciful to me a sinner wait he's opened the door amen I tell you this man went down to his house Justified rather than the other for everyone that exalteth himself shall be abased and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted amen so we're not to compare ourselves with ourselves but if you do that then you won't open every door amen but if you say Lord I'm the one you know deal with me come into every part of my life just like this Publican guy said he didn't compare himself with anything he he just knew he was wrong amen he didn't justify any of his actions now what about us amen I'm going to yeah yeah I'm going to wind this up but you can't whatever you do don't reason amen God is only going to take prisoners in a Rapture y you say well I'm predestinated he is waiting for you amen we know God is Sovereign and his will is supreme but he's a gentleman yes you know brother Bram says I think it's an I know it not he um I don't have the quotes here but you go listen to that sermon in Noth 65 he just stands up he opens the Bible he's not expecting to preach and he reads Revelations 3 about th and know not Thou blind miserable naked poor Richard and then he he in there he speaks of a story of two people who live next to each other they're both woman they're both Christian one I think one is like Methodist and one is another one and then the one who's meant to be closer to God than the other one um she notices The Other Woman begins to commit adultery with someone else and and and and have a divorce and do all these different things and she says to her husband how terrible that that woman is I see what she's doing but she was in the wrong as well because she was miserable wretched blind and didn't even know it amen but what was happening she was comparing herself with someone else and she didn't even recognize that she was actually the one undone as well amen she was reasoning and he said I think it's in that sermon he said the Rapture has not gone because the bride is not ready amen and in and in my little mind I thought the Rapture has not gone because every door is not open in every heart of the Bride amen oh we're waiting for more to come in are we right yeah we got to get ready that's right we we we don't just need to get reports from Ethiopia and different places bringing people in we have to get ready amen cuz if what if they're ready and we're not ready now you're holding up the now we're holding up the program right amen but if we're ready I believe that'll hasten Paul Peter I believe it is about hastening the coming of the Lord amen amen amen he says the bride is not ready that's why and we know that was 50 years ago many of us were not even born not even Believers sure but you got to bring it down this is 2016 we're not going to be here much longer I've heard that for years we're not going to be here much longer that's right amen but the thing that because when the bride comes into her position how does she come into her position she opens every door amen Lord rearrange my life amen do what you need to do yes to get me ready that's how she that's how she gets into her position amen because of she if if and that's what he's looking for Amen brother was a to Christ and that was an example of what the rest of the Bride would be like at the end time amen so we have to never compare yourself with someone else and never reason say but I'm at least I'm not like the person on the street or in some dark denomination don't don't compare look at this look at this and say search me oh God Amen try me today take every door I want to take the hinges off God he amen you say well I've never done anything wrong the Rich Young Ruler did one thing wrong he turned down eternal life and he ended up in Hell amen because of his reasoning well I haven't done anything wrong I'm I'm a good boy and he was a good boy you know he hadn't done anything wrong but he didn't open that door amen amen and Friends that's not our portion amen that's not our portion amen amen we're here you got to be a prisoner you say well I don't know if I can do it he's got you as I said about the lamb he's got you you just got to recognize he's got you and he doesn't have you just to throw you off the cliff at the End Amen he's got you to lift you up to take you from this world Amen and that's the only way you'll get there you won't get there by your reasoning or by or by comparing yourself or thinking I know it all or I'm a good Christian the only way is he lift you up amen amen amen and when that lamb you know you take that lamb you can cut its tail off you can do you know but it's just
