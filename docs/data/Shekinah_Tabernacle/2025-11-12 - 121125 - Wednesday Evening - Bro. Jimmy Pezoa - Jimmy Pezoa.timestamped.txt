[21:12] to give you thanks for this day, Lord.
[21:14] Thank you for all your blessings,
[21:15] Father. Thank you for this beautiful
[21:17] day. We want to ask you, Lord, to be in
[21:20] this meeting, Father.
[21:23] We want to give you thanks for
[21:25] everything what you have done in our
[21:26] lives Lord for changing us Lord. Giving
[21:30] [music] us your spirit so we can live.
[21:34] Want to ask you to be with me tonight
[21:37] Lord. Help me. Let me be a [music]
[21:40] blessing for you people. I ask you this
[21:42] Lord in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Thank
[21:46] you Mrs. Jones.
[21:50] Amen.
[21:52] How are you?
[21:54] God, God bless you, saints. Can we all
[21:56] sit together? We are like quite spread
[21:58] apart, but we are not that many tonight.
[22:00] So, can we sit just in the front row so
[22:02] I can look everyone? Hey,
[22:10] sorry for taking those attributions.
[22:14] [clears throat]
[22:18] So, um, the thought that the Lord gave
[22:21] me, he gave me the thought, I'll say
[22:24] probably like a month ago. So, I put my
[22:28] I have like a picture of me and
[22:29] Stephanie in my Bible and I put
[22:32] [clears throat] it in the book.
[22:35] So, at camp, I open my my Bible and I
[22:39] saw my face and the name of the book.
[22:41] The name of the book is Jonah. So I said
[22:43] Jonah and I saw my face. I was like
[22:45] please Lord I don't want to be Jonah.
[22:49] Not not this Jonah. This Jonah is a
[22:52] example for the youth. I mean the Jonah
[22:54] from the Bible.
[22:56] So let's read first um just the book of
[22:58] Jonah says now the word of the Lord came
[23:02] unto Jonah the son of Amiti saying arise
[23:05] go to Nineve the great city and cry
[23:07] against it for the wickedness is come up
[23:10] before me. But Jonah rose up to flee
[23:13] unto Tarses from the presence of the
[23:16] Lord and went down to Hopa or Chopa. I
[23:20] don't know how you pronounce that thing.
[23:21] Chopa and he found a ship going to
[23:24] Tashes. So he paid the fear thereof and
[23:27] went down into it to go with them unto
[23:31] Tashes from the presence of the Lord.
[23:34] You can have your seats tonight.
[23:43] So we have this prophet. Jonah was a
[23:46] prophet of God.
[23:49] But he was disobedient. The Lord told
[23:51] him to do something, but he didn't want
[23:53] to go to to Nineveh because they were
[23:58] enemies. Nineve was a capital of the
[24:01] Assyrian Empire. So they've always been
[24:05] in conflict.
[24:08] So what I think that's very like caught
[24:10] my attention was that Jonah he preferred
[24:13] to
[24:16] stop his fellowship with God then to go
[24:20] and talk to these people that were the
[24:22] enemies.
[24:26] We have the picture here.
[24:29] That's Joer Nineve where he was supposed
[24:33] to go, but he decided to go to Tarses,
[24:36] which is Spain,
[24:40] but the Lord didn't want him to go
[24:42] there. Amen.
[24:44] So, if I can put a title for today, I
[24:46] will put like, do you want to buy a
[24:48] ticket to Tarses?
[24:53] I love you all the youth here. I love
[24:55] you everyone here. You are my family.
[24:58] But I think I I really want to talk
[25:00] about this. This is a big part of my
[25:03] testimony.
[25:06] So we have here Jonah. The Jonah he was
[25:08] disobedient. He didn't want to go. He
[25:10] didn't want he preferred just to stop
[25:12] the fellowship with God. He he said I'm
[25:15] not going there. I this is it.
[25:20] So there's a couple of um verses here
[25:23] about um obedience. Jesus answered and
[25:26] said unto him, if a man love me, he will
[25:28] keep my words and my father will love
[25:31] him and we and we will come unto him and
[25:34] may go aboud with him.
[25:37] That's when you are obedient to the
[25:39] word, not just listening. When you're
[25:41] obedient. And it shall come to pass, if
[25:44] thou shalt hearken diligently unto the
[25:47] voice of the Lord thy God, to observe,
[25:49] and to do all his commandments, which I
[25:52] command thee this day, that the Lord thy
[25:55] God will set thee on high above all
[25:57] nations of the earth. That's only going
[26:01] to happen if you're obedient to him. My
[26:05] son, keep thy father's commandments and
[26:07] forsake not the law of thy mother.
[26:12] So you kids, are you obedient to your
[26:14] parents, right? When they tell you to
[26:17] unload the dishwasher or load the
[26:19] dishwasher to unfold the clothes, you
[26:22] fold the clothes, put it in the washing
[26:24] basket. Do you do those things, right?
[26:28] I expected so many events in that part.
[26:35] If we carry on with the story of Jonah
[26:38] says, "But the Lord sent out a great
[26:41] wind into the sea, and there was a
[26:44] mighty tempest in the sea, so that the
[26:47] ship was like to be broken. Then the
[26:50] mariners were afraid and cried every man
[26:53] unto his god and cast forth the
[26:58] those are we
[27:00] that were in the ship into the sea to
[27:03] lighten it off them but Jonah was gone
[27:06] down into the side of the ship and he
[27:09] lay and was fast slip.
[27:14] What an attitude e what a wrong
[27:16] attitude.
[27:19] We will see here like how
[27:22] Jonah's decision
[27:24] was involving a lot of people.
[27:28] All those Mariners sailors, it's easy
[27:30] for me to say, they they didn't have to
[27:33] do anything with it. They were just in
[27:35] the ship. But because of Jonah's um
[27:39] choice, they were all in that big
[27:41] tempest.
[27:43] So, be careful with your actions because
[27:46] they can involve a lot of people.
[27:48] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[27:51] &gt;&gt; So the ship master came to him and said
[27:54] unto him, "What man is thou, oh sleeper?
[27:58] Arise, call upon thy God. If so be that
[28:01] God will think upon us that we perish
[28:05] not."
[28:06] That that verse is just amazing because
[28:09] we have this all these men that were
[28:11] crying out for their God. So they didn't
[28:13] believe in the God of Jonah,
[28:16] but they they were trying to they were
[28:20] helping Jonah to get back to God to put
[28:24] back that relationship that he didn't
[28:26] want to.
[28:29] But Jonah, he didn't want that. And they
[28:32] said everyone to his fellow come and let
[28:35] us cast lots that we may know for whose
[28:38] cause this evil is upon us. So they cast
[28:41] lots, and the Lord fell upon Jonah. Then
[28:45] said they unto him, Tell us, we pray
[28:48] thee, for whose cause this evil is upon
[28:51] us? What is thine occupation? And when
[28:54] comest thou? What is thy country? And
[28:58] of what people are thou? And he said
[29:01] unto them, I am a Hebrew, and I fear the
[29:04] Lord, the God of heaven, which hath made
[29:06] the sea and the dry land. He didn't
[29:10] answer like with a really nice answer.
[29:12] He just said, "I'm a Hebrew and I'm a
[29:15] and this is my God."
[29:20] But he didn't fear the Lord.
[29:24] Otherwise, he would have act on God's
[29:27] word. He wouldn't like go to Nineveh. He
[29:30] didn't want to. He didn't fear the Lord.
[29:32] He was disobedient. Then were the man
[29:35] accidentally afraid and said unto him,
[29:38] Why hast thou done this? For the man
[29:42] knew that he fled from the presence of
[29:44] the Lord because he had told them. So
[29:47] now when these guys they hear that he
[29:50] was a servant of the living God, they
[29:52] were all afraid
[29:54] because I can imagine like back in the
[29:56] days when someone said like, "Oh, I'm a
[29:59] Hebrew." They all knew the Lord of the
[30:02] Hebrews. They all knew the God of the
[30:04] Hebrews, the one that split the sea. The
[30:08] mighty God. And now they were in a big
[30:10] in a big big storm.
[30:17] I I'm lost here. Where was where was I
[30:19] reading?
[30:25] Then said they unto him, "What shall we
[30:28] do unto thee that the sea may come unto
[30:31] us? For the sea ro and was temp
[30:34] tempestuous. He said unto them, "Take me
[30:37] up and cast me forth into the sea. So
[30:40] shall the sea become unto you. For I
[30:43] know that for my sake this great tempest
[30:45] is upon you."
[30:50] He could have prayed. He could have
[30:52] turned his heart to the Lord.
[30:54] But he would rather to die
[30:58] than to go and preach in Nineveh. He
[31:00] didn't want to go, man. That's like he
[31:02] didn't want to go. He just he didn't
[31:05] want to follow what God was telling him
[31:07] to do.
[31:11] Nevertheless, the man rode hard to bring
[31:13] him to bring it to the land, but they
[31:16] could not, for the sea wroth, and was
[31:19] temptation against them. Wherefore they
[31:22] cried unto the Lord, and said, We
[31:24] beseech thee, O Lord, we beseech thee.
[31:28] Let us not perish for this man's life
[31:31] and lay not upon us innocent blood. For
[31:33] thou our Lord has done as it pleasantly.
[31:38] And so they took up Jonah and cast him
[31:40] forth into the sea and the sea ceased
[31:43] from her um raging.
[31:47] So we have all these guys that they were
[31:49] involved in a situation that they didn't
[31:52] even deserve it just because one person
[31:54] was being disobedient.
[31:56] What I wanted to say here it's like
[31:59] we have to make a sure that we are doing
[32:01] what the Lord want us to do otherwise
[32:06] our whole family can be involved in a
[32:09] really bad situation just because of us.
[32:18] Then the men feared the Lord exceedingly
[32:21] and offer a sacrifice unto the Lord and
[32:23] made vows.
[32:25] Now the Lord had prepared a great fish
[32:27] to swallow up Jonah. And Jonah was in
[32:30] the belly of the fish three days and
[32:32] three nights.
[32:34] Now Jonah was in a very dark place.
[32:38] Jonah was in a place and some people
[32:41] they draw pictures and put like Jonah
[32:44] was like this really big fish and they
[32:46] he had all this room to even to light a
[32:48] fire and just to sit down. I think that
[32:50] Jonah was just very tied into this big
[32:53] fish.
[32:56] And I know that some people, scientists,
[32:58] they say that that's impossible. There's
[33:00] no fish that they can swallow a man and
[33:02] a man can survive three days. And this
[33:04] is when the message is just so cool.
[33:08] Sorry if I expressed that word, but
[33:11] it is written there that the Lord
[33:13] prepare a fish to swallow Jonah. That
[33:17] fish was prepared for that.
[33:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. I asked the AI to create a picture
[33:26] of Jonah and the whale. So that look
[33:28] very cool.
[33:32] [clears throat]
[33:34] Didn't mess around.
[33:47] So, I can say like in my own my I'm
[33:49] going to give a testimony at the end,
[33:51] but
[33:53] I've been in that place. I grew up in a
[33:56] church.
[33:59] So, I know what it feels like to grow up
[34:02] being young and
[34:04] praise the Lord and lift up your hands
[34:06] and cry and be in a meeting. But I also
[34:09] went into my teenager days
[34:13] and that's what everything fall apart
[34:15] for me.
[34:17] I've been inside of the fish, I've also
[34:19] been out of the fish.
[34:23] This is um Jonah when he's praying
[34:27] inside of the fish belly. He says, "The
[34:31] waters compass me about even to the
[34:34] soul. The deep closed me round about the
[34:38] wheat with wrap about my head. I went
[34:41] down to the bottoms of the mountains.
[34:44] The earth with her b was above from was
[34:48] above me forever. Yet hast thou brought
[34:51] me up to life from corruption. Oh Lord
[34:54] my God. When my soul fainted within me,
[34:56] I remember the Lord and my prayer came
[34:59] into came in unto thee into thy holy
[35:03] temple. They that observe laying
[35:07] vanities forsake their own mercy. But I
[35:10] will sacrifice unto thee with the voice
[35:12] of thankgiving. I will pay that that I
[35:15] have vowed salvation is of the Lord. And
[35:18] the Lord spoke unto the fish and it
[35:20] vomited out Jonah upon the dry land.
[35:25] So after being in that really dark
[35:28] place, the Lord ordained the fish to
[35:31] release him. So he was finally in
[35:35] Nineveh.
[35:40] Now, that's a name. That guy is Deon.
[35:44] That's the Lord. That's the god of the
[35:48] Assyrians, the people from Nineveh.
[35:52] Have fish, half human.
[35:55] Now look, the man the Lord creates this
[35:59] big fish to swallow Jonah. And now he go
[36:02] to the coast
[36:04] and Jonah is released. So imagine the
[36:07] people that was at the cost that they
[36:09] saw this big fish throwing up a prophet
[36:13] for them.
[36:15] Of course they all understood the
[36:18] message, right?
[36:23] But now we can see what happened to this
[36:25] guy too. 1 Samuel verse 5 says, "And the
[36:29] this is in the future. Okay. And the
[36:31] Philistians took the ark of God and
[36:33] brought it to Abenezer unto Ashtod.
[36:38] When the Philistians took the ark of
[36:39] God, they brought it unto the house of
[36:41] Dean and set it by Dean. And when they
[36:45] Ashod
[36:47] arose early on the moral, behold, Dean
[36:50] was fallen up
[36:53] his face to the earth before the ark of
[36:55] the Lord. And they took Deon and set him
[36:58] in his place again. And when they arose
[37:00] early on the morning in the moral
[37:02] morning, behold, Deon was fallen upon
[37:04] his face to the ground before the ark of
[37:07] the Lord. And the head of Dean, and both
[37:10] the palms of his hands were cut off upon
[37:13] the threshold, only the stump of Dean
[37:17] was left him.
[37:19] That's what happened to that God in the
[37:21] future. He will just destroy. Everything
[37:23] has to bow to God. Amen. Amen.
[37:28] &gt;&gt; So let's go now. Let's go back to um to
[37:30] the people in Nineveh. After Jonath
[37:33] preached, the people of Nineveh believed
[37:35] God and proclaim a fast and put up the
[37:38] sacklo from the greatest of them even to
[37:41] the least of them. Who can tell if God
[37:45] will turn and repent and turn away from
[37:47] his fierce anger that we perish not? And
[37:51] God saw their works that they turn from
[37:54] their evil way. And God repented of the
[37:57] evil and that he had said to the wool do
[38:00] upon them he did not he did it not. They
[38:05] repent and the Lord forgive them. Now
[38:11] do you think that Jonah was happy or was
[38:13] he angry after the people of God heard
[38:17] his message? That's going to be your
[38:18] homework.
[38:20] I'm going to leave it there.
[38:23] Now, this is what I I want to actually
[38:25] preach. [clears throat]
[38:27] So, when you are young, you can have
[38:30] friends
[38:32] that doesn't really matter if they're
[38:34] not Christian cuz you're just kids. You
[38:36] just want to play with the ball. You
[38:38] just want to run and I don't know hide
[38:41] and seek. You can all be friends.
[38:44] You mo most of the time the parents are
[38:48] supervising what the kids are doing.
[38:52] So there's not much as a problem if the
[38:55] kids have friends like that. The problem
[38:57] start when in the teenager years
[39:01] when everyone wants to be someone
[39:05] and you want to be someone and you want
[39:07] to impress people
[39:09] and when you want to impress the wrong
[39:12] kind of friends that you have that's the
[39:15] age that everything just start to change
[39:18] in your body. Some of you, you grow up.
[39:21] I I didn't. But some of you start to
[39:23] grow up and have another desires and
[39:26] stuff. That's when boys start to like
[39:28] girls and girls start to like boys and
[39:32] you know all this stuff.
[39:35] And if you have friends like that, even
[39:36] if you go to school, they can ask you
[39:38] like, "What do you do on the weekend?"
[39:41] Oh, but I went to church.
[39:45] Oh, no. We went to this party. This
[39:48] person got drunk and this other guy got
[39:51] punched. This is so much fun going to
[39:53] the parties.
[39:58] Now, if you
[40:00] if you're not planted, that's going to
[40:03] start pulling you. That's going to start
[40:05] pulling you. And I'm going to say this a
[40:09] couple of times. It's like,
[40:12] do you want to buy a ticket to Tash? Do
[40:16] you want to live
[40:18] the fellowship that you have with God
[40:22] so you can go and have friends? So you
[40:25] can have so you can go and impress your
[40:27] friends.
[40:29] Is that what you really want to do? I
[40:31] hope you are not.
[40:35] But I felt moved to to say the things.
[40:39] Now the world they offer you lights and
[40:42] fireworks and everything. big parties.
[40:47] So much fun.
[40:49] They're just nonsense.
[40:52] What happened the day after?
[40:55] &gt;&gt; But they don't tell you that. Then you
[40:58] can see all the edge of beers and drinks
[41:01] and stuff and they saw all these people
[41:03] just having fun. And have you actually
[41:06] seen how someone that's drunk looks
[41:08] like?
[41:12] There's nothing there. That's just an
[41:14] illusion.
[41:18] &gt;&gt; I have a quote here was listening this
[41:20] message says,
[41:23] "And do you know my little sister
[41:26] that potentially an adultery when a man
[41:28] kisses you, he has potentially committed
[41:30] adultery with you, you should never let
[41:33] him kiss you until you are married. For
[41:36] the glands, both male and female glands
[41:39] is in the lips." Do you understand? when
[41:42] the male and female glands come
[41:43] together.
[41:45] Um, let it be where they may be have
[41:49] potentially committed adultery. And you
[41:52] shouldn't let that boy kisses you until
[41:54] that veil is raised on your face and you
[41:57] are his wife. Don't do that. It
[42:00] committing adultery. It's mixing male
[42:02] and female glands.
[42:07] Some of you, you you are in an age that
[42:09] I know that it's it's hard. You start
[42:12] liking people. There nothing wrong with
[42:15] that. But if you act like that,
[42:17] that's what your prophet is saying.
[42:19] That's what the Lord put in his mouth to
[42:22] say.
[42:24] So be careful because that's going to
[42:27] bring consequences.
[42:31] That's what happened to me.
[42:34] I was in the world. I had girlfriends.
[42:37] So, my first kiss was not with my lovely
[42:40] wife.
[42:44] That's such a big bond that you can have
[42:48] with someone. And I didn't have it cuz I
[42:52] was just being silly
[42:56] in that illusion.
[43:04] Now some of
[43:07] it's just hard for me just to preach
[43:09] this way. I'm so sorry but how a very
[43:13] wise man said
[43:16] I'm just delivering the message.
[43:20] Be not deceived. God is not mocked. For
[43:23] whoever a man seweth that shall he also
[43:26] reap.
[43:28] You can come to church, but you can,
[43:31] this is for the ladies. You You can wear
[43:33] your pants when you're at the library.
[43:36] You can do all your things hiding from
[43:38] your parents, hiding from people from
[43:42] church.
[43:46] But God can see everything.
[43:49] So why are you hiding?
[43:51] God can see everything what you doing.
[43:54] When your door is closed, when no one is
[43:57] looking at you, he can see everything.
[44:00] You cannot mock him.
[44:05] Now, there's a study that says,
[44:07] but research suggests a significant
[44:09] number of adolescents stop being
[44:11] Christian with studies showing 66 to 75
[44:15] or young people leave the church after
[44:17] high school. This phenomenon phen I
[44:20] don't know how to say the word often
[44:21] called the youth exodus is most
[44:24] pronounced when young people transition
[44:27] to college.
[44:29] So this this study they're saying
[44:31] there's a lot of young people that they
[44:34] just stop being Christians
[44:36] when they're like in the in those
[44:38] teenager years because it's hard.
[44:43] But I'm here to tell you this is not
[44:46] worth it
[44:48] at all.
[44:53] You are like family to me. You I
[44:57] you have no idea how much you encourage
[45:00] me, especially the little ones, man.
[45:03] Every time that I see you here in
[45:04] church,
[45:06] &gt;&gt; man,
[45:09] please just
[45:11] don't buy that ticket to churches.
[45:15] And now I was going down the streets one
[45:17] time in Los Angeles, California, and I
[45:20] seen a very odd person acting odd. And
[45:23] he was walking down the street, not
[45:24] picking, but he was just merely like
[45:27] taking an afternoon stroll. And I went
[45:30] to the other side of the street to see
[45:31] what he was doing. Everybody was turning
[45:35] around laughing at him. Because of his
[45:37] particularity, I noticed he had a sign
[45:40] hanging on the front of him. And I
[45:43] thought I'll I'll see what everybody is
[45:45] laughing about this odd particular man.
[45:49] And so he was I noticed him as the
[45:52] people look at him they laugh at him and
[45:55] but he seems to have a different kind of
[45:57] a smile a smile of contentment.
[46:01] The other smile that the people were
[46:03] giving him was more like ridicul ridic
[46:07] [laughter]
[46:08] ridiculing him. But he seems to be
[46:11] satisfied in what he was doing.
[46:14] Well, there's a whole of a lot
[46:17] to think about. When a man is satisfied
[46:21] in what he's doing, he's right.
[46:24] Though
[46:26] he be an oddball, oddball just means
[46:29] like a weird person to somebody else. If
[46:32] he's satisfied, that's what he's doing.
[46:34] He's right. Then let him stay with it.
[46:38] And as I come close to to the little
[46:41] man, I notice on across his chairs here
[46:43] on a plague on a board was wrote, "I am
[46:46] a fool." At the bottom he had for
[46:49] Christ. I am a fool in great letters
[46:52] down at the bottom said, "For Christ."
[46:55] And everybody was laughing at her at
[46:57] this.
[46:59] And as the little man praised on down
[47:02] through the crowd of of years and
[47:05] carrying on, I turned to look what what
[47:08] was on his back. And there was a great
[47:11] big question mark on his back. And down
[47:14] at the bottom said, now whose fool are
[47:18] you?
[47:20] Lord, he had something there. You see,
[47:22] but it seemed to be satisfied that he
[47:25] could be a fool for Christ. That's what
[47:27] Paul said that he had become a fool. A
[47:31] fool for Christ.
[47:34] Now don't expect that you can be a
[47:38] Christian person and be also very
[47:42] popular
[47:44] because the world the world don't want
[47:46] Christ.
[47:48] That's not what if you in the balance.
[47:51] If you put that in the balance and if
[47:53] you're a Christian
[47:56] that's not
[47:58] you are weird if you're Christian you
[48:02] because you don't drink because you
[48:04] don't use drugs because you don't go to
[48:06] parties because you don't have a
[48:07] girlfriend until you are married. You're
[48:10] weird. Who's this guy? He might be gay.
[48:14] He's not doing the things that we all
[48:15] are doing that we are so proud of us.
[48:20] Be a fool for Christ.
[48:26] Now
[48:31] I want to just share this because it
[48:34] might be good for someone.
[48:37] Now you know that I grew up and there's
[48:39] a Pentecostal church. My parents used to
[48:42] take me four times per week. We used to
[48:45] go Thursday,
[48:47] Tuesday, Saturday, and the whole Sunday.
[48:51] That was church for me. And I remember
[48:53] being a little kid saying to my mom,
[48:55] "Can't we not be normal?"
[48:58] I used to play with my friends Saturday
[49:00] night, like evening, and now it's like
[49:03] around 6 6 7 6 7:00 and we had to go to
[49:08] church.
[49:10] But I was playing with my friends and my
[49:12] mom was like, "Come on, Jimmy. Time to
[49:14] go to church."
[49:16] Man, I didn't want to go to church.
[49:19] If you want me to be honest, I didn't
[49:21] want to go to church. I I wanted to be
[49:22] normal.
[49:26] I remember there was a TV show like
[49:28] wrestlings and stuff was all where
[49:30] Saturday at 7:00.
[49:34] I have no idea how many times I pretend
[49:37] to be sick just to be just to be able to
[49:39] see these guys and speeders fighting.
[49:43] How dumb, man.
[49:48] But also remember going to church when I
[49:50] was a little bit younger than that and
[49:52] there was this brother from church. His
[49:54] name was Francisco
[49:56] and he man he he was such a big
[49:58] influence for me. I remember I used to
[50:01] sit by him. I used to sit by the wall so
[50:04] the other kids that were not going to be
[50:06] able to see me and he used to tell me
[50:10] you just praise the Lord lift up your
[50:12] hand I'm always being emotional you you
[50:16] know me lift up my hands and cry and but
[50:19] one time he just left church I don't
[50:23] actually know what happened to him but
[50:25] that big influence good influence was
[50:28] taken away from me and I was just left
[50:30] alone there. Now,
[50:33] I didn't want to be the weird guy that
[50:36] just always crying when there's some
[50:38] songs being singing. I didn't want to be
[50:40] that guy. I'm just being honest. So, I
[50:44] just stopped.
[50:46] And from that time on, my life was just
[50:50] down and down and down and down.
[50:56] By the time that I was a teenager, you
[50:58] know, started going out with girls and
[51:00] stuff, I didn't do drugs until I was
[51:03] like 19 or something.
[51:06] But there was this separation of me and
[51:09] God.
[51:11] I always thought that I was just I've
[51:14] gone way too far. There's no God. He
[51:18] can't take me back. I'm I'm I've
[51:20] committed sin. I'm done.
[51:27] I ended up going to the uni
[51:30] and then when the things they really
[51:32] went wrong for me
[51:35] start doing drugs. I was alone living in
[51:37] another city. So my parents they were
[51:39] not there.
[51:42] Everything everything where you can
[51:43] imagine imagine I did it was just
[51:48] just destruction was just horrible.
[51:53] I remember one time I was in in the
[51:55] house of a friend and um her mom was
[51:58] kind of like
[52:01] kind of like a witch. She had this weird
[52:04] kind of
[52:07] gift that she was able to kind of like a
[52:10] fortunate teller or something. But she
[52:12] had a gift. Now there's gift among
[52:14] people. That's that's what brother
[52:16] Brennan says.
[52:18] She was looking at all of us. We were
[52:20] all drunk and high and stuff. And she
[52:23] looked at me. She she talked to
[52:25] everyone, told them everyone's life.
[52:27] Everyone was just shocked.
[52:29] She comes to me and she says,
[52:33] "Do you believe in God?"
[52:36] And I said, "Yes." And she said to me,
[52:38] "You are running away from him. And one
[52:41] day you are your life, everything where
[52:45] you have been doing here is going to be
[52:47] your testimony. and you're going to be
[52:49] preaching.
[52:51] But she didn't say it in a nice way. She
[52:53] wanted to make fun of me.
[52:56] From that that time on for all my
[52:58] friends, I was the pastor, but they used
[53:01] to make fun of me. Pastor Jimmy, where's
[53:03] Pastor Jimmy? He's just drunk over
[53:05] there. Where Pastor Jimmy? He's just
[53:07] sleeping. I don't know.
[53:10] Over there. Where's Pastor Jimmy?
[53:13] Smoking weed there in the corner. They
[53:15] used to make fun of me
[53:18] when she told me that me and a friend we
[53:21] we went to buy more drinks and I was
[53:23] shaking, man.
[53:25] I was so shocked cuz I knew
[53:30] that that was true.
[53:32] I knew that the Lord wanted me back.
[53:36] But same as Jonah,
[53:38] I was like, "No, man. I've gone too far.
[53:41] There's no way that he can take me back.
[53:44] After
[53:48] a couple of a couple of months later,
[53:50] everything just went really really
[53:52] wrong. Like the uni studies, my life, my
[53:56] friends, everything. I I thought to put
[53:59] end to my life because I was just this
[54:01] is it just going to disappear.
[54:07] But I in one moment I text my brother. I
[54:10] text Pedro. I said to him, "Pedrick, can
[54:12] you help me?
[54:14] I need to start again."
[54:17] He said to me, "Are you sure that you
[54:19] can stop drinking and being silly and
[54:22] stuff?" Cuz he was a Christian home. He
[54:25] was a Christian here in New Zealand. I
[54:28] was just doing so bad. So, he was kind
[54:30] of scared that I was going to come here
[54:32] and probably ended up in jail, you know.
[54:37] But the Lord moved him and he sent me
[54:40] the ticket and with the ticket probably
[54:43] I share this thing a couple of times but
[54:45] man just beautiful with the ticket there
[54:49] was a booklet
[54:51] wasn't that one
[54:54] was God hiding in simplicity
[54:57] when I saw that the booklet man
[55:02] I took it I said This is for me,
[55:09] but he send it for my mom.
[55:12] That booklet was not for me.
[55:17] But when I saw it,
[55:20] I was like, man, this is for me.
[55:26] From that moment, just changed my life.
[55:30] [clears throat]
[55:34] remember being on the plane and cry for
[55:36] like 13 hours, a whole flight. I was
[55:38] just
[55:40] Lord, you have
[55:43] you are giving me a new chance. I can
[55:46] start all over again.
[55:54] So if someone tells me that this is a
[55:57] lie,
[55:59] I can tell you with my life, my
[56:03] testimony, this is true.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; The message works.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; The Lord Jesus works and he's still
[56:09] working today.
[56:17] And if if you're watching meeting just
[56:21] to find mistakes,
[56:24] the biggest mistake is your attitude
[56:26] because you are trying to find mistakes.
[56:30] But these works
[56:32] &gt;&gt; have worked in my life.
[56:35] God sent a prophet. You like it or not?
[56:40] Now Psalms 139 says, "Oh Lord, thou hast
[56:45] searched me and know me. Thou knowest my
[56:48] down sitting and mine uprising. Thou
[56:51] understand my thought a far off. Thou
[56:54] comp compasses my path and my laying
[56:57] down and art acquainted with all my
[57:00] ways. And there is not a word in my
[57:03] tongue, but oh Lord, thou knowest that
[57:06] knowest it all together. For thou thou
[57:10] hast beset me behind me, and before me,
[57:12] and laid thine hand upon me. [snorts]
[57:15] Such knowledge is too wonderful for me.
[57:18] It is high, I cannot attain unto it.
[57:22] Whether shall I go from thy spirit, or
[57:25] whether shall I flee from thy presence?
[57:27] If I ascended up into heaven, thou art
[57:31] there. If I make my bed in hell, behold,
[57:34] thou art there. If I take the wings of
[57:37] the morning and dwell in the uttermost
[57:39] part of the sea, even there shall thy
[57:43] hand lead me, and thou right hand shall
[57:46] hold me.
[57:49] There's no place that you can escape
[57:51] from the presence of the Lord.
[57:55] I have this question for you.
[57:59] Are you thinking to get a ticket to Taj
[58:02] or do you already have that ticket?
[58:07] You can be sitting here
[58:10] but your soul, your mind can be so far
[58:12] away from God.
[58:17] Do you want to change? Do you want to
[58:23] I forgot the word
[58:25] trade
[58:27] the fellowship that you have with God
[58:30] for a bunch of friends?
[58:34] I used to have friends back back in
[58:36] Chile.
[58:38] How many of them with how many of them I
[58:42] am still in contact? You can ask me
[58:44] that. None.
[58:49] None.
[58:51] So all of that experience
[58:56] being in the world, being with my
[59:00] friends, my homies, being with those
[59:01] guys was for nothing. They don't even
[59:05] know me. They don't know me now. They
[59:07] don't want to know about me.
[59:10] The Lord changed my life. Deliver me.
[59:16] So all the time that I tend to impress
[59:18] people was for no reason.
[59:21] Now
[59:23] if you can get something from my life,
[59:26] just please don't go to the world cuz
[59:28] there's nothing there for you.
[59:31] There's things that you can do there and
[59:32] you are going to regret it for the rest
[59:35] of your life.
[59:38] And because of if you want to go to the
[59:40] world, God can start dealing with you.
[59:44] And by dealing with you, it can affect
[59:46] your whole family
[59:49] because he's trying to call your
[59:50] attention.
[59:53] Something I I don't know. Something can
[59:55] go wrong. Your mom can get sick.
[59:58] Something that's God just telling you
[1:00:01] something like, "Pay attention.
[1:00:04] What are you doing?
[1:00:09] Let's just have the musicians.
[1:00:15] [applause]
[1:00:20] So
[1:00:22] I wanted to pray for for the young ones.
[1:00:25] So if the young ones can come here and
[1:00:27] pretty much everyone just come here.
[1:00:28] Let's just pray one for another.
[1:00:34] The world is just a evil place and just
[1:00:37] has an very strong power pulling people.
[1:00:42] But greater is the one that is in us
[1:00:44] than the one that is in the world.
[1:00:48] Just
[1:00:50] did you sing any song?
