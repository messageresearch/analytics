in into this beautiful atmosphere and um just be with us now lead my lips Lord I step out of the way I am surrendered Lord and clay in your hands in Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen thank you very much musicians um good evening evening God bless you all yes it is a Wednesday I know sometimes people start with um it's a Wednesday it's hard it's been a rough week and blah blah blah we here you are here for a reason you want to be here no one forced you to be here I don't think I don't think anyone's forced you to be here you want to be here right we are our licks of Fire coming together and before I just jump the gun cuz I'm so ready to shoot um uh let's let's let's uh open up in uh in in our scriptures uh Talia if you can put the the scriptures up um nah we'll go to the it will easier be easier to follow um so just go to Matthew Matthew 8 if you wish Matthew 8 verse 5 vers [Music] 5-10 and then we'll also read from First Kings 17 um I do like this scripture quite a bit uh I guess because it's has been recently revealed to me sort of what the what the Lord wanted to show me there so w Kings 17 from about 7 17-24 but let's start with Matthew 8 please say Amen if you're there amen and when Jesus was entered into capernium there came unto him a centurion beseeching him and saying Lord so we all know the scripture this my servant lith at home sick with py grievously tormented and Jesus saith unto him I will come and heal him so he was ready he was willing he was able he had the time to go to him the urion answered said Lord I'm not worthy that y should come under my roof but speak the word only and my servant shall be healed so it doesn't stop here speak the word and you will be he shall be healed now I will explain why I know why I understand and where when I meet another man of authority that this will happen for I am a man under Authority having soldiers under me and I say to this man go and he goeth and another come and and he cometh and to my servant do this and he doeth it so when Jesus heard this he marveled so now deity is standing back and saying I recognize Authority in you and I can see the faith in you I like what I'm seeing and he had to say to them that followed him so you can imagine who was all in that crowd verily I say unto you have not found so great faith no not in Israel you can have your seats and then we can read the next one and this is sort of just to color in the picture First Kings 17 1 Kings 17:1 17 and it came to pass after these things so now uh this is Elijah coming to the uh the woman of um where's she zarap paath uh uh he came to her the Widow and after he she gave him food after she baked the last bread after everything came to fruition as Elijah said thus sayeth the Lord your cross of oil won't run dry your meal won't go stale it will keep on until the day rain will come back in So after this right come to pass this the son of the woman the Mistress of of the house fell sick and his sickness was so sore that there was no breath left in him and she said unto Elijah what have I to do with thee oh man of God Art Thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance and to slay my son and he said unto her give me thy son and he took him out of her bosom and carried him up into a loft where he abod and laid him upon his own bed so what Elijah is not doing here which is for me now because of this thought and I'll share it with you now I'm trying to lay a foundation here and just get myself a little bit uh I guess relaxed is he doesn't see the woman the woman's response or the woman's statement as audacious she's got the audacity to speak to a prophet of God I've just given her all this I've just saved her life and her son's life and this is now how she talks to me he doesn't do that he goes something's wrong something's off there needs to be a change that needs to come let me go hear from my Lord so he takes him and he cried unto the Lord he said oh Lord my God hast thou also brought evil upon the Widow with whom I sojourn by slaying a son and he stretched himself upon the child three times and Cried unto the Lord and said oh Lord my God I pray thee let this child's Soul come into him again and this and the Lord heard the voice of Elijah and the soul of the child came into him again and he revived and Elijah took the child and brought him down uh out of the chamber into the house and delivered him into unto his mother and Elijah said see thy son liveth and here is the kicker for me and the woman said to Elijah Now by this I know that thou art a man of God and that the word of the Lord in thy mouth is truth yeah wow so after the meal and the oil after that here with the tire where the rubber hits the road here I can see that you are a man of God and you stand by your word and your God listens to you he's not you're not praying to the ceiling I love that so a little a little bit of a segue before I jump into my thought is that uh and and it struck me so so much that I just had to sort of bring it to remembrance to you guys brother hannes was here on on uh a few Sundays ago and he said sort of and now I'm paraphrasing he's saying do do you realize each time that we gather here we are and we are part of a Revival fire we are coming together so I will quote him and then I will I will put up the scripture cuz I sorry the the quote I I had to go and search this up because it it brought a different perspective for me um obviously how how it fits so neatly into my thought for tonight because it's all about perspective and I'll show you now what I'm meaning by that but so he said so the church come together so you can read that so this is what the prophet's saying now you see we are not a divided people we are not and it was so lovely on Sunday afternoon all the languages all everyone coming together and singing and I'm just thinking man if we had um in in it language we talk about a heat map you know if we have this map of a global map of where we all from how we all come together in this little um uh in Willington um I don't want to say it's a big city little city a cool City or not a cool city um but I I guess this is sort of cernium maybe I don't know um here we all come together so we're not divided we've got to be in unity because each one of us holding a part of God and we must come together and then the pillar of fire is manifested in the wholeness in the fullness of it when his church sits together in Heavenly places now brother Hannah said here and that was so nice um sit together so the brings the pillar of fire from one uh from another place sorry sorry let me start the church come together you bring a part I bring a part everyone of us bring a small part he says the pillar of fire is present here this morning that's right Hallelujah you coming to church brings the Pillar of Fire not from another place but from your heart sitting here and combine together and worship we be we become then the people uh then again the people that can say you know that we know that the pillar of fire is here not by a picture but by looking at your brother and your sister welcome Judah you made it wow I'll I'll I'll ask the police whether you were in time sorry not picture but by looking at your brother and sister's face next to you that's how you see the pfy here that's that's amazing I'm glowing I am that God is here because they carry God okay so let's finish here each one of us holding spiritual gifts spiritual offices coming together brings that Pillar of Fire back again that is so so nice so all these leaks of fire together brings the pillar of fire I'm I'm I'm I seg Wade because I wanted to add this in here my perspective of Why We Gather here changed and and and shifted there was a little bit of a tug and a shift in my direction you know turning away to Jesus um when I when I read this so I wanted to my my thought for tonight is it's all about perspective so when you're out in the world when you sort of um uh how can I put this so yeah so when you're out in the world when you when you're not really here yet settled um in a in a in a state where you were eating the book from Genesis to Revelation if I can put it that way amen a lot of things or perspectives you would think is oh audacious and then your perspective will change as soon as you eat of this book and it's been revealed to you and you see the son of man that's that's stepping behind you pushing you towards Heavenly places and then you go ah the authority not the audacity anymore and that's that's sort of where I want to sort of um lean towards and and and making that that difference or differentiation between the two and say it's so close and the one is almost perverted of the original I don't want to start a new doctrine but but just follow me so audacity it's a courage or confidence of a kind that other people find shocking or rude unusually I like this one unusually strong and especially rude confidence in yourself now not in myself but what is in me what is in me okay so people will find sometimes us a little bit audacious and and and I'll and I'll get to this so as we read now this what was the woman and she had this bread she had this she was looking for sticks and how the prophet pref prepared his heart and how the word prepared her heart God came down and spoke to her and saying um you will you will receive a prophet you need to you need to supply him you need to give him food right and even when he came onto the scene she had a little bit of a push back and she said we're going to die this is now the last bread I I was I was about to make carrying getting all my sticks together and all and then that's it they said okay I acknowledge what you say but God rich in Mercy here's what's going to happen your meal won't go stale and your oil crust will now not empty until the day of rain comes so just look at the the first perspective of of this woman of this Widow would have been the audacity this guy coming in from a foreign land asking me for my last meal but the Lord will provide and the attitude changed because she made that meal and she gave it to him yeah and she saw that so I think as soon as and I believe as soon as Elijah spoke thus sayth the Lord something connected there was a there was identity that was met there was Authority that came and he goes he's speaking from Authority and not from audacity he's speaking from something that's behind pushing him saying this will happen amen doesn't matter what right I had so many examples I had to um one of the best ones I thought was Moses just I wanted to dramatize that brother wanted to get you on here we can just be all old you know we were walking like this just after working with Ben so we didn't have to even pretend so here here's this old man coming and just just just put yourself in that place I don't want to use the word imagine because this is not imaginative this is real put yourself in the place here's this old man coming through that gate we've we've dramatized it so many times and it's Army Legion upon Legion upon Legion and the Pharaoh is standing there and and he's like what do you want and what did the girl sing Let My People Go so imagine now well there we go imagine put yourself there Pharaoh is going you know so this there's two ways he can see this audacity he can go he's so unrealistic with this objective of his that really come on is there is there no other thing that you want to you know let let let let 10 of your people go or are we here in negotiations or you know that that whole so unrealistic so out there so rude um that he goes I'm not getting what you're saying so when you say let my people who you know or he goes this this whole rudess he goes so what gives you the right and he would probably would have gone uh do you see my soldiers do you see they armed they're very dangerous you've got maybe a stick in your hand um I can kill you at any time well could he could he so here's a man coming in Authority she's had that that little push from the from the from the back saying well go save your people always work through a prophet yes and so many times that comes over the pulpit old shamgar man sham go with the oxco just sitting there and if I can dramatize that as well I I I've always pictured him in this type of scenario where this's is open window and he just sees you know the wheat is just just harvesting thing is just that Golden Sunshine and he sees that the Blackness he sees that that 600 troops Men of War approaching now it's me and old Josh we had a good talk who say well you know if if it's three against one in terms of a fight or in terms of some confrontation that's already cowardice that's already you know you can't even see me face to face or man to man you need to bring your buddies they go here they bring 600 to a guy with a ox coat okay there's something wrong there well wrong from their angle so what's the audacity they come and approach him with 600 people and this day the scripture is fulfilled where he jumps through that window and I see him that typical slow motion wollywood scene he just jumps through that window with that Ox goat and he just goes slaying it's real though it's very real but he gets in there and that day Authority came behind him and pushed him along and gave him that little step higher defeat defeat defeat so we did talk about Elijah coming to the Widow and I wanted to explain that shamgar and then brother Isaac so I wanted to build this whole sermon around Jonathan climbing up with his armor Bearer to the Philistines to say just see the perspective from the pH phe's point of view they coming to him him he's coming to them with his armor Bearer like outnumbered completely the audacity that this this Y and his dad he didn't know so he couldn't go Oh Daddy is looking you know behind you no daddy didn't know about this no one knew about this I'm here and he how I wanted to color in the picture is bringing it into today's Times uh terms is we we going after Satan we're coming to Satan in a showdown and saying I'm coming after you amen you know so I'm asking the Lord Lord how should I how should I approach this in my work situation in my life as a husband as a brother how do I approach the situation yes Lord is do I do I move forward do I get that answer saying yes you come up come to me come in my environment okay yes Lord you've got my back and I go that's Authority so but I won't hammer on that too much cuz you took it I'll give it to you you jumped the gun but uh it is probably a good segue to come in here of uh where where even we need to be careful when when we think we have the authority but we don't so I I'll just drop it this in here and then we will go sort of into today's um scenes because I I've been looking at historical figures but I know we've got a young crowd here and we've got people that will ask what about today give me an example of today is the message real today or is it living in us today wonderful um song that we had from the nanas as well it is very much living and well um brother brandom says then we can we can go to this um if you want John John 519 John 519 I think I did save it here yeah John 5:19 then answered Jesus said unto him unto them verily verily I say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he sees the father do for what things soever he does he does uh these also doeth the son likewise for the father loveth his son and showeth him all things that himself doeth and he shall show Greater Works than these that you will be that you may Marvel so here brother B saying that exactly that verily verily absolutely absolutely I say unto you the son can do nothing but what he I see the father doing yeah so how could a man have the audacity to call himself a Divine healer when Jesus Christ here in man form didn't even claim to be a Divine healer he said I can do nothing in myself that's either the truth or it isn't the truth he said I only do as the father shows me I do nothing of my own will or nothing myself the father don't impress it on me so here I want to we we can't we can't think we are in in in Authority in an emotional state you are going to be emotional but are you in an authorative state or are you just making a claim do we do everything through our father through Jesus Christ through the one that's leading us and this is uh oh maybe I'll don't want to jump the gun there too much so let's go and this is now where I guess where the tire hits the road is where is it today brother Ed give me something for today so um I was trying to find the sermon but it was I think in our 2022 Camp brother C dick was here and he started talking about uh he had to keep his truck license and he had to do his blood checks and you know doctors all that confirm that he's in a good medical condition to obtain that truck truck license sorry license and the doctor phones him and he confirms with him he's got a condition I can't remember if it was to do with his diabetes over his blood pressure or anything like that and what does brother card says no I don't get a second opinion you know that's when you can get a second opinion not in the word and then so imagine now imagine me again the doctor on the phone saying I'm the doctor in this situation I'm calling you I'm seeing I'm seeing it here's the here's the facts he goes uh no I don't you know so man of authority comes and he says Lord not my will be done but your will be done I do not need this I do not want this I do not accept that bag of snakes that box of snakes apologies doctor but I think you might be wrong so they get the second opinion he comes into the and I'm paraphrasing he comes in back into the um Clinic they do the things plot test two days later of whenever they go you're clean he said I told you so yeah this is this is Authority okay all right all right but now brother Ed that's brother Diggs man yo how can we compete with him okay so let's bring it back home now to shik Tabernacle um there was a there was a time I've only seen my wife sayani twice very very very sick very sick this is the the first time um sister um bronin was still here the the the Andy and them were still here and she was sick that she got up the in the morning and I thought well I'm I'm sometimes insensitive in terms of how sick are you cuz I I go all quiet when I'm sick you know just leave me alone I'll get better give me a half a day you know we back we back running so I I sometimes I cannot judge how sick people are you know it like so should I leave you or should I just carry on and you'll get better cuz that's how I en Vision I would do how do I how do I approach this so what I've done in this situation I thought okay I'll I'll take the kids off your hand I'll get them ready you go see the doctor and we'll fix it and we and we can go to church on Sunday now I think also in hindsight and and and in my subconscious something must must have said if I can just get it to the hospital but now the perspective changed because it's not H hospital or Wellington hospital this is our Hospital okay how many of you seen healing started here in this place and came to fruition in this place so something said in my in in the back of my mind our little church is the hospital the gift of healing gets ministered here on a weekly basis I need to get it here I need to get it here now of course we we are human we are flesh we go let's get that opinion from the doctor let's get the meds going antibiotics and and I'm in the car and we can come and in this case she goes the doctor went to Lundy and said you Mystery Case number one for the day and that was her diagnosis she comes home she could barely walk man so now I need to get in the car and everything but we're still going to church so now here's my lovely little wife sitting and going this man this the audacity that he's got I just want to be in bed I just want to heal up I just don't and he just pressing and he just wants to go to church and the testimony testimony comes as soon as she walks in I think it was sister bronan that caught you went with you sat with you basically the whole service and you had prayer and everything and she felt that tingle that wave that warmth coming over a body instantly instantly now I'm saying is that out of authority I knew Hallelujah I knew and it can be hard sometimes how do you relay this how do you come to the right Hospital in that moment and that's physical healing right how many healing of the hearts can only take place here there's no psychic Ward or Wellington whever whatever that will help you shakina Tabernacle who the licks of fire that comes together that brings the pillar fire down that brings the authority and place it in the center of it all that's the one that can heal it that's the one that can fix everything right that's why we're here praise the Lord so she forgave me had uh she got better and she got a testimony out of it we got a testimony out of it and it was it was real it cannot be cannot be manufactured in that okay hold on brother Ed how do you change this perception and perspective then how can I change from audacity to Authority I think you already know the answer how do we get to a point of authority on the Promises in the word of our day now do we feel sometimes a little tug we feel a little shove something that's here Davy come here please so you're looking at the the the so you know sometimes the deacons they they will they will lead you to your seat and you just have this just this on your shoulder no you go you you sit there you know nothing it's gentlemanly you know but but there's some direction you know there's that little tug you know or someone goes oh just watch out for the car and you just feel that little you know the skirt just pulled watch out for the car yep it's passed you can go now all right nothing nothing in the way nothing step nothing jumping in front and just oh I saved your life um that push that shove and then internalize it now from the heart from the soul from that little button what is that push what's that pressure pushing you saying go now you know holding you back sometimes but other times it just on now go now go now your path is made the authority you're standing on the word now how do we get to that point you feel sometimes that shift and chains inside of you can't put that finger on and that's that little button do you some days get up and go and you say to yourself enough is enough I'm tired of all of this I'm taking my mountain that was that Shamar moment right Joshua and Caleb check the audacity here 12 Spies went out 10 come back and say they big as brother they as big as brother Ed yeah yeah and uh we can't take them Joshua and Caleb come and goes tree chop them chop them at the legs kick him easy easy easy yeah so there's that um hello the Lord said and promised us we'll take this and Caleb said that's my Mountain I think Caleb was the one there he's saying it's my Mountain that's it it's made up I'm I don't even have to go and reread this it's it's there I'm taking it Josh are you joining or not let's move whatever about the 10 spies do you read ever again about them so that's the that's that shove that pressure saying I cannot go back now I cannot go back now so that shove that little button inside of you that's what's growing now right that's the Holy Ghost growing in you cannot be stale and cannot sit on a Mountaintop the whole day or the whole time so in recent events in my own life um the Lord showed me so why do we have these little Mountaintop experiences we're on a high we can see a far it's lovely here let's dance and have a have a song you know it's good to have that but I think if you stop and just see what's coming I think the Lord's giving you that opportunity put on your 2020 Vision give that Eagle Vision we're on our way we we can't stop here it's a beautiful place but we're on our way there there's a there's a bit of a bit of a valley bit of a dip but we'll get there do you see beyond that dip beyond that Valley I want you there Hallelujah so enjoy the time that you're there I don't want to take anything away from you but that's where we're heading so do you know why God gives you that mountain top the Eagle Vision it's what's ahead Rejoice on the mountain Toops but don't miss the purpose of those moments okay brother Ed how do I get your this Authority that you're speaking of heal surrender get baptized marry him soak in the washing of the word yes Lord the Lord shall fight for you you shall hold your peace my presence will go with the I will give you rest the seventh day God rested how do we enter God's rest with the Holy Ghost receive the holy go be led and rest wait a minute sounds a little bit audacious that um I'm saying you need to go and rest how do i f fight for my Mountain exactly that's that Paradox that man doesn't understand and can only come through Revelation once the Revelation strikes the sea in you that button that tugs that presses that grows your identity gets quickened I am a son our daughter of the most high God creating the UN Universe with a word and expressed thought and the promise he laid upon your heart for this day with that Authority you take what is righteously yours and I just want to finish with this the whole idea of authority um and where do we where do we get our rest where does it all start in this journey but notice he only comes to
