========================================

can when I was watching the the the item that that brethren did in Auckland because I think he'd someone posted it and I was just watching it and then maybe after a few minutes of it I kind of looked at one of the people and like the choir on the least I thought it looks just like Naomi and I didn't know you were back so I took a snapshot of the screen and then zoomed in and I've I wasn't sure cuz I'm not sure she's supposed to be back so I asked Jen and I said Naomi and the fighter and at lo and behold it is I came confirms yeah yeah yeah yeah we believe the true report we we've we believe that now we see it we see the manifestation of Naomi you know that's what it's gonna be like with the Lord we we see him by faith but one day we'll see the manifestation of them in reality what a day that will be you know all of all everything you know it's a Christian and all the things although all the things and then one day to see the Lord there's a song that says and the toils of the way will seem nothing when I get to the end of the road it'll be worth it all when we see Jesus one glimpse of his dear face all sorrows fully raised I mean what a time there's gonna be I mean it's um let's stand and we'll open up in prayer what's evening and just ask the Lord to be with us Lord Jesus we just thank you Lord Heavenly Father that we can be gathered here Lord and this this place to meet with you this evening Lord Jesus and Lord at on the outset of the service Lord we we would would desire Lord that you would come and fellowship with us Lord we desire to constrain you for this evening Lord to to meet with us Lord to speak to our hearts to brood over us while your spirit Lord may the Almighty God touch every life touch every heart Lord meet every need this evening Lord you see we're tore through gathered to get on your name near you are in the midst Lord so we are under great expectation this evening Lord that you you are here with us Lord and that you will bless us this evening or may May heart and each mind just let you take full control of the service Lord forgive us of any sons we've committed Lord an end mayor may there be nothing between us and you Lord that you could speak to us this evening bliss brother James as he brings your word Lord may he be may he feel at liberty Lord just to speak what you have placed on his on his heart Lord and he could get that across and in the way that you would desire him Lord Jesus and we just some probably so that are still away this evening greased by the brother being in the different ones Lord and we just thank you so much for all that you've done for us and we just want to come at the service to your hands this evening in Jesus name Amen amen let's sing um are you washed in the blood and the soul cleansing blood of the Lamb we'll start with the verse here have you been [Music] are you being in this race this out are you are in the blood of the Lamb are you in the black in the sole pending blood of the land your gum is spotless are they why and so are you are in the blood of the land are you walking daily by the Savior's side in the blood of the Lamb do you race me moment in the sea but I washed in the blood of the land are you are in the bud Enzo painting part of the land your garments spotless are they white as snow are you washed in the blood of land when the bridegroom cometh will yours be white ger and white in the blood of the land with your soul be ready for the mansion Friday I wash in the blood listen I am wash I am one in the blood in the sole cringing blood of plan yes my garments uh spotless they are white as snow I am washed in the blood of the man lay aside the garments that a same bison MD washed in the blood of the land is a fountain flowing for the sole unclean o be washed in the blood of the Lamb I am washed I am one in the blood in the soul Benji butter blend my gamma the spotless they are and so I am washed in the blood of the lamb course again I wash I am in the bus in the zone when chooklotto play my garments uh spotless they are white as snow I am wash in the bath lamb on my time I am what I am one in the blood in the soul cleansing blood of the land my comments uh spotless they are white as snow I am washed in the blood of the land amen I felt like answering the question in the chorus after all they are you wash the beastly yes I am Amen this little light of mine I'm gonna let it shine this little light of mine I'm gonna let it go this little light of mine I'm gonna let it shine this little light of mine I'm gonna let it shine [Music] hide it under up but you'll know imma let it shine hide it under up for show no I'm gonna let it shine I did under up for show no I'm let it shine don't let Satan blow it out i'ma let it shine don't let Satan it up I'm already don't let fate and low I'm let it shine let it shine -

Anna Dean after Sunday morning service and brother Isaac was saying you know I'm just the the spear toy you know not even a proper tire but that little yellow one that little space saver and he's who were driving off around the corner and we turned down the side street and lo and behold was a car sitting there with the yellow space saver wheel on and I turned to Nadine and I said you know that's brother Isaac you know I sit on one of those little three wheeler cars you know that goes around a corner and it tips over we just we're here we're here for the Lord you know we we're here to share what he's put on our heart and I was just hearing the testimonies that have come back from the convention and walk London brother Andy sharing some of the things and the the fire that was there and I was just thinking as I was coming here you know that time brother Brennan was fishing in the river and he was fishing for that rainbow trout because his whole ministry was to catch that rainbow trout to catch that bride that there's covenant and after he's finished as fishing he comes back to his tent and is a beer and their two Cubs and the Cubs have got into his stuff and they're tearing all of burden and he sees he's seen the mother bear go running off she was scared but the little cub stayed and he was wondering why this little cub was staying in there and he got a bit closer and he could see the little cub was Anna and the honey jar and I thought man this is you know we've had some congregation that have had their hands and the honey jar and when that little bear went running back to mama the mummer and the other cub were licking all that honey off so we just want to lick some of your fire while it's still hot and learning I mean you know I believe we're living in a harvest time and if we're living in a harvest time then there has to be something to harvest is a fruit coming forth upon the earth and as you can see here in this picture of the tears among the wheat the tears can look a lot like the week you know when a big vessel comes up in the middle of a field that's ready to be harvested see it's a thistle and you know it's bad and you know I'm going to stay away from that as a thistle but sometimes the tears can be so much like the wheat that it's hard to discern between the tears and the weed but it has to come something forth the harvests and the days of truth of church age revivals our God is finished it's over this and there's no more there's no there's no more ministry there's no eighth messenger coming everything we have now is sitting here in seed form coming to fruit so what the Lord's grace will show some things that are maybe a bit deep in a bit just things our Lord have been showing me that I hope I can show forth so brother Branham talking and resume if ages where are those vast numbers that keep coming to revivals and answer opticals are not most of the nearly emotional and their approach or desirous of something physical rather than desiring that which is truly spiritual as this age not like the day which Noah entered the Ark and the door was shut but yet God tarried and judgment seven days no one was literally turned to God and those silent days so what I want to find out because brother Branham preached the message souls in prison now he was talking about these souls that are imprisoned now have no more chance to be converted and our brother Brennan saying when Noah went into the ark the door was shut and no one was literally turned to God and those silent days and what are those silent days because we know those silent days came in the seventh seal when there was silence in heaven so he sees here and the souls that are in prison now he had the seventh seal from us he wouldn't do it when the angel stood day by day telling it but then he wouldn't do it on that one said this silence and heaven no one knew that was the coming of the Lord so now he's telling you what was happening under that Silence of the seventh seal was the coming of the Lord and it's still it's still happening we're in the middle of it this is the coming of the Lord that he's talking about is this age not like the day which Noah entered the Ark and the door was shut but yet God tarried and judgment seven days no one was literally tuned to God in those silent days and he carries on and yet it is the harvest time so now he's placing it in this day in the harvest time and yet it's the harvest time then there must come upon the scene and this age those who will bring the wheat and the tears to maturity the tears are already maturing very fast under corrupt teachers who turn the people from the word but the we also must mature amen and we know that from Calvary there's been a tearing down of the bride Satan's torn down the bride with the four anointings of the full horse riders but there's been a restoration brother well Joe talked to like Joel talked about the the Parimal were in the locusts the cankerworm the caterpillar all coming down and eating that tree but yet the trees got to come back again it's gotta be restored to the original grain a little something here brother Brennan said oldest reader now it says God is going to restore the Lutheran age did not restore the church had started a Reformation the Weasley and age did not restore the Pentecostal age did not restore that God has to restore he can not deny his word this is not the resurrection of the church it's a restoration God will take the church back to Pentecost of the beginning so right what they had God is bringing back he's not raising up what they had but he's bringing this church into that condition we know justification made way for sanctification and the Insecta fication made way for the Baptist baptizing of the Holy Spirit but then when the seals were unloose the baptism of the Holy Spirit made way for the Holy Spirit himself so goddess has come and the prophets ministry right but that ministry has to be accepted because it has to be a first fruit of the offering whenever our field would come up and ripen and the grain would ripen they would bring forth the first fruit when that blade was right and would be given as an offering and it had to be accepted and brother Branham came with the ministry of restoration and opened the seals and he was accepted and now the bride is walking in that same vision he was just the firstfruits but every one of us has to come into their fullness and their grain and the head and be accepted accept this message Cain's offering was rejected and there's going to be people that do not bring the right offering in this day there's nothing in them to bring the right offering and now the tears have been bound in bundles ready to be burned because everything that's when a man dies he stays the same way he doesn't change after he dies when he dies he appears a sinner when he dies he's still a sinner when he's brought up in the general resurrection so they had that bride has to accept mercy and also the tears have to reject mercy and to her God is sending the prophet messenger with a vindicated ministry that he might be accepted by the elect they will hear him as the first church heard Paul and she will mature and the word until becoming a word bride the mighty works will be fair that are always attendant upon the pure word and faith so the maturing of the bride is going to bring back the book of Acts it's going to bring back a power in the church you know this is something more for this bride to obtain there's something more you know there's a greater works for this bride to obtain and how can the bride do a greater works than what Jesus did how can the bride do that the voices and the bride and it was a loud voice that called Lazarus from the grave and I believe it'll be a loud voice that calls the bride of all the ages back to life again when the sons of God shouted for joy you know we look at something that's going on in the heavenly realm the sons of God shouted for joy and we place it oh that was like 7,000 years ago but realistically that's an eternity the sons of God are shouting for joy now they were shouting for joy and Abraham's day there were sons of God shouting for joy on the day of Pentecost and the sons of God are still shouting for joy and I believe that the shouting for joy when we can really come to the fullness of that vision man those did Saints you can go there's a party that I've got an appointment at and I want to be there Ezekiel 37 verse 3 I'll just read it to you and he said unto me son of man can these bones live and I answered Oh Lord God thou knowest again he said unto me prophesy upon these bones and say unto them oh ye dry bones hear the word of the Lord thus saith the Lord God unto these bones behold I will cause breath to enter unto you and ye shall live this is the prophet speaking this is not God speaking to the dry bones camel itis God through a body speaking to the bones I believe this is the power that's lying within the bride and how are we going to do these greater works then of Christ you know Jesus what Jesus talk of fish any break of fish and made more fish he took a loaf of bread and he broke a loaf of bread and made more bread but a profit that was accepted he spoke squirrels into existence where there were no squirrels this bride is coming forth with a spoken word to speak things into existence you know I was just reading a quote before before we came here and brother Brennan was saying I might touch it laid over these laws that are stopping the bride right now from just speaking a new world into existence and living on it there has to be something because it has to be a manifestation of the word here to preach to the souls that are in prison but the power that is in the bracket we could just speak another word because we have that power and there's going to come a time where that can be used and its fullness this is coming into maturity and it's a squeeze that will really bring this third pole into full operation you know we have a third pole now there's many things happening under it but we have it now but as a squeeze comes on really you know when you squeeze an orange and the juice comes out of it but you know it just squeezes the best part out all the flavor or the taste or the sugar you know the squeeze is bringing the best out of the bride you know what drove the Easter to come before the King took the squeeze on her people you know the priests coming on her people and she said you know we need a pray we need to have a prayer meeting you know because God can be touched and you have to reach out and touch them but that squeeze was bringing her and we're before it was death to come into that presence beyond the veil now Easter can go into the presence and she had one thing on her mind she had the salvation of her people on her mine but also the destruction of Haman and then because she could have had up to half the kingdom right then but she didn't want a selfish motive she wanted to see her people say and she wanted to see him and defeated you know I was just thinking on my way home Moses as well you know there's been a call in Egypt that there's going to be death over the land because we're living in an age where there we're rejecting the blood token rejecting the message for this age brings death and so an Egypt when they rejected that token striking the blood on the doorpost when it was rejected at bought a spiritual death what bought a natural death there but and type at what a spiritual death and a people come out and now they're racing to the Red Sea and the armies up behind them and Moses gets to the Red Sea and what are we going to do this army is going to destroy us but now as the squeeze is coming on and pressing unto Moses the waters part before them and miracles start happening as a squeeze is coming on and Moses says let's go through the water they go through the water and in the same time that squeeze is coming on and the bride's going through and to salvation the waters closing and kill the enemy and it's a squeeze that's bringing it on the revelation of Jesus Christ now remember this Christ and the true church as a continuation of the book of Acts but the book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and powerless it exposes Satan revealing his works attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's Word that's what Haman was doing was discreet at in God's people right down to the time he has cast into the lake of fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army if they get a true revelation this is what I really wanted us focus I love this quote a son of my favorites but that's thought here if they get a true relation of the two spirits within the framework of the Christian Church and by God's Spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist spirit Satan will be powerless before her so it comes from a revelation of those two spirits that have right from the Garden of Eden the seed chapter of Genesis coming up through the Bible that's brother Branham caught up the trail of the serpent coming up the twins of two vines the whole way to have a true revelation of that and to stand against at this day and Satan will be powerless before you he will be as definitely thought of today as when Christ withstood has every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes Satan hates revelation but we love it with true revelation in our lives the gates of Hell cannot prevail against us but we will prevail over them hallelujah amen there is a true revelation to be had here it's God's seed in the Serpent's seed that's so close I remember those the tares and the wheat so close that it would deceive the very elect if possible but it's not possible hallelu we need to make this church an uncomfortable place for the tears you make you make this place uncomfortable for the tears and this church will have just power Satan doesn't like it when you shout like you did with the sons of God back with Jobe he doesn't like it when you dance like David dance he doesn't like it when you pray like Hannah prayed for revival he doesn't like it when you take your Mountain like Deborah took her Mountain he's powerless where the true Cedars there's a continuation of the book of Acts the bride now continues the ministry of Christ completing the things that he could not do in his earthly ministry because there were some things that Jesus left to be done in this day and this time Jesus sowed the seed and it has to come to maturity but the devil also sowed her seed and now there has to come someone to bring for the maturing maturing of both the weight and the tears and there's a ministry here today that's bringing forth the maturing of the week and hell is spilling over from the sixth dimension of and the fifth dimension and to this dimension through TV through sound waves through Hollywood through all this and it's bringing forth four tears as all as all the sinner and it's just manifesting on earth as this age not like the day in which Noah entered the Ark and the door was shut but yet God tarried in judgment seven days no one was literally tuned to God and those silent days and yet it as the harvest then there must come upon the scene and this age those who will bring the wheat and tears to maturity so what happens in this day what's actually taking place because something's taking place now that we have to catch a revelation of and what we see as and the Garden of Eden God had given him this title deed to the earth so Adam had the power over the earth and then when the Sun came in he lost that title deed and it went back to God the original owner and and this see this is the but this was the whole title deed to everything that Jesus had possession of and our names were in that book and then at Calvary when Jesus died he took back that book it was the book of redemption and he had the book of redemption and you were redeemed at Calvary and then you weren't redeemed when you accepted this means that you were redeemed at Calvary and Jesus had that book and it was the book of redemption he took it out of the hand of God and that book could have been opened in but Christ sealed it up in mystery and parables everything was there your name was there but it had to wait until this time because now in this age a prophets reach forth and taken the book out of the land and now the prophets opened the book and is calling the names and your names in that book and so when this has taken place now he's only calling the names that are in the book no one was literally turned to God and no and silent days because Christ he had already redeemed you but now he was coming to receive you and he you know there's people that can just not accept the message because the their name wasn't in the book sometimes I found us going through some of the things as brother Brennan's preaching towards the end of the ministry as has revelation and as understanding as growing even as he's preaching the message and he recognizes us and he recognizes that and then he puts this on us together and it's continually growing in for me the revelation coming to me it's been the same that's come back why that because what's taking place today you can't go and just read well this verse here Caesar and this is this is it and and this is the instruction and I'll take this quote and it's Caesar because it's a mystery it has to be revealed to you watch him there'll be a lot of impersonating a lot of everything else but there was really somebody was going to be saved for he the church was predestinated to be without spot or wrinkle she is going to be there and the lamb died for that purpose and then when the last name on that book was redeemed the land came forth and took the book and then he makes a statement and you can go and listen to it and he says I'm the one that did that so now he's saying it's the land because it was Christ and the Prophet that reaches out and take the takes the book and he says I'm the one that did that I'm the one that took the book and I believe as he's going through here here in this river he starts making it a bit clearer as he goes through I believe he was inspired to say that you know you were not redeemed just by the opening of this book you had to be redeemed back at Calvary but now he's coming to receive because his first coming was to redeem the bride has seeking coming is to receive the bride that's as the secret coming the rapture were in the rapture now and as third coming as certainly comes back with us bro and that's why the church today misses it because they only see two comings of the law and they mess what's taking place in the mystery and I'm glad that I heard him call my name out of that book I mean because there was a seed here and as soon as that light struck upon that see that started to grow that plant up until it and now it's just maturing and it's hid then the land came forth for what he had redeemed he come to claim what he had redeemed he already got it right here in the book taken from his hand now he's coming to receive what he had redeemed that's his work he's done he's come to receive it oh what a time has proven it the Seventh Seal proved it come back and took the book of Redemption notice it was to be the seventh angels message that it was to reveal the seventh the seven seals revelation ten seven now you find it so now he's tying this whole event and to Revelation 10 seven that he's tying this whole event and to what's taking place in this day the Lamb has come forth with an open book to receive us and the bride is coming to life one at one the bride does not all come and to life and one go that's an individual fear that you have with Christ a relationship with you head and not everyone's at the same stage and when this took place when Christ come and unsealed this book and a bride started to live upon the earth and the fullness of this vision with Christ and here Christ become on full display again and the body of his bride up until this time the word had only been on a partial display you know there were minister there were Reformation they had a part a part of this word but it wasn't the full word it was just a part and God had him he had ignorant for son and not accepting the fullness of the word like I think the Lutheran's thought the Jews were the Anti Christ right so there was an ignorant there for not accepting well not knowing the fullness of the word because they were doing things under justification that weren't may be holy and they come into sanctification and they didn't walk in the spirit you know so Christ had a the high priest would go and make an offering for the ignorance of sins but they had to come a time when Christ would come and be on full display and now it's mercy or judgment because he's provided a way of nurse he's always provided a way of mercy but to not accept that provide a place of Mercy as judgment so when the children of Israel were walking through the desert and they were getting burdened by serpents they were getting burdened because they were doing wrong but God provided a place of mercy when the startle they had to look to that serpent on the pole and if they would look to it God would spear them but if they didn't look to her if they didn't look to that sacrifice they wouldn't be safe he always makes a way of mercy and judgment but it has to be accepted this is why brother Branham preached the indictment to call the church to a trial and indict them for the seeking crucifixion of Christ because they had to had to be a time where they would come forth and ministry that would preach to the total loss that had no chance of mercy but would be guilty of the second crucifixion of Christ because it happened in Jesus ministry and brother Branham says we have exactly the same Ministry of Christ and there has to be a people upon the earth manifesting that a loss they can't be saved they don't have a seed they're to be saved and I'm going to bring forth a balance because the bride as a place of mercy that can be touched and hopefully we'll get there and I can show you that but you can't kill the ministry it lives on you can put the messenger to sleep but you can't put the message AHA right he lived on and notice when the third pull of his ministry come first was healing the sick the second was rebuking the organization's and prophesying what they had done what they were and what was coming what is what will come and what was what is and what will come that's what he done is that right but his third pole was when he preached to the Lost that couldn't be saved no more they were down there with in big painted eyes was preached to the souls and how that did not accept mercy but were eternally separated from the presence of God but yet they had to recognize that what he was because God made him death one day of his ministry climbs out the same way in the last days as it was as the father sent me so send I you that works that I do shall you also lost could never be saved they had rejected mercy that was as they're poor and do you believe that third Paul's here and then because that third Paul has come to do more than one thing it first come brother branham's of these three parts to the third Pope he said the spoken word the opening of the word and preaching to the Lost and everything that's happening in the ministry and this time is happening under one of those three things jesus said many will come to me in that day and say I have done all these things see they eat manna and the wilderness jesus said they everyone eternally separated they did that's eternally gone they perished right there in the wilderness you remember Hebrews a six chapter ones that was once made known the truth and refused to walk in it there is no more repentance for them see borderline belief when the truth is presented to a person for the last time and they refuse to receive it according to the book of Hebrews see they will there's not even anything in the world that can either save them but there's many that will come to him in that day and say haven't we done these things they have finished no repentance no redemption there is nothing left for them they are eternally separated the Bible said so looking for the fearful fire indignation which shall devour their adversary and when the truth of this gospel has been proven thoroughly vindicated and then turn around and walk from it they're finished that's all that's awful that is awful it's awful but I have to say and somebody has to say it because it's a truth laying here in the Bible and I don't want to see somebody it and have no chance of mercy I'm sure you don't turf the love of God's on you but but factors there are people that cannot accept the message but they have to hear the gospel they have to reject it they have to manifest this what they did when Satan told a lie in heaven and they rejected it and now it's just manifesting upon the earth remember the angels which kept not their first to stay but leaf there in that prison house and darkness where the world is walking today and that same prison there is no more repentance there is no repentance brother Branham had that vision of walking through JC Penney store you remember and he's seen their green eyes and he he had a vision when he was a boy of going to hell and it shocked him because he's seen what was taking place around him and he said this is how this is what I seen when I went to hell that's manifesting she I seen that there that woman walking around and how and he began to realize that the tears were coming to fruit and you know brother Branham when he was preaching I think the sixth seal sixth seal he talked us back into Matthew Matthew 24 and he showed you the first six seals right the way through Matthew chapter 24 showing that it was revealed but had an Anna mystery but it's there everything's here in the word but then brother Branham sees Betty and meted the Seventh Seal we didn't say nothing about it and we know that he was revealing it but in parables as we read at the start and to the bride he's revealing in parables so he revealed the sex in Matthew 24 and then you go over into Matthew 25 and I might get a turn there Matthew 25 because now he's going to show you the Seventh Seal and Matthew 25 the whole chapter as a sealant seal being shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened unto ten virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom and five of them were wise and five were foolish and that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps and while the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept and at midnight there was a cry mean I believe this is the midnight hour and there has been a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him it's in there what happened the Eliezer called then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps had gone out but the wise answered saying not so lest there be not enough for us in you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves and we see now that the churches are all going out and that they want revival they want the gifts they want prophecy they want all these things they're hungry but they can't obtain it they don't have the revelation they don't have the oil and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were really went and with him to the marriage and the door was shut now I don't believe that we're going to a marriage brother Brennan has already clearly said that we go to the wedding supper not the marriage the marriage is taking place now under that tent vision that brother Brennan had under the food pour 'this ministry were uniting to Christ after word came also the other virgins saying Lord Lord open to us but he answered and said verily I say unto you I know you not watch therefore for you know neither the day nor the hour when the Son of man cometh the Lambs come forth to receive his bride and then the door shut because he's now just coming for his bride coming for the names that are on the book because the you know the church was the ones that shut the door Christ was on the outside he said I'm knocking and if you open I'll come in and sup but if this nothing within you to open the door you can't receive it in Christ can't come in so they shut the door and there's a marriage taking place now uniting with the groom so the groom can finish this work throw his bride you know Christ is amazed at his bride he's not looking at the bridesmaid I mean he's not definitely not looking at the best man he's just looking at the bride cuz that's as focused as whole focus as honors bride the bride and you know the bridesmaid has no part in the honeymoon because we're going on a honeymoon soon you know brother Brennan said that when we go to this marriage supper you know this is our honeymoon right through the Millennium were on a honeymoon period and the bridesmaid has no part in that he's receiving his bride and the fullest church is trying to buy oil thinking she has been saved but she is rejected mercy and is eternally lost and guilty for the seeking crucifixion of Christ when the father said open unto us he said unto he said I know you not I know you're not so Matthew verse 14 because we're going to carry on for the kingdom of heaven as as as a man travelling into a far country who called his servants and delivered unto them his goods and unto every one he gave unto one he gave five talents to another two and to another one to every man according to his several ability and straightway took his journey so you know Christ has come to you and he's given you a portion and some people didn't you know lay there might be one brother and here's an amazing ministry in Christ that's given in this great portion and then to another brother he's given a small portion but God's all carry on reading it then they that had received the five talents went and traded with the same and made them other five talents likewise he that had received two he also gained two but he that had won went and digged in the earth and had his Lords money don't hide it under a bushel so now in this parable we see the groom comes with this book it's been vindicated among us and he's left back gifts with the bride some he's left a greater portion than others but he only requires of you what he's given you but you have to do something with what he's given you if he's given you a great portion then you need to do something with that don't hide it under a bushel because it'll be required at your hand verse 19 after a long time the Lord of those servants come and Rickon with them and so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents saying Lord thou delivers us unto me five talents behold I have gained the sight than five talents more his Lord said unto him well done thou good and faithful servant thou have been faithful over a few things I will make thee ruler over many things into thou unto the joy of the Lord he also that had received two talents came and said Lord thou delivered to me two talents behold I have gained two other talents beside them he's Lord said unto him well done good and faithful servant thou has been faithful over a few things I will make thee ruler over many things in two thou into the joy of the Lord you're only required to do what he's given to you but to every member of the bride he has given you a commission to do something to reprocess I this book to flesh out this word to love it and he is going to require of you to do that portion of the word verse 24 then he which had received one talent came and said lord I knew that thou art a hard man reaping where thou has not sown and gathering without was not straw and I was afraid and went and had thy talent in the earth lo there thou hast us that is thine as Lord answered and said unto Him thou knew I was a wicked and slothful servant thou knewest that i reap where I sowed not and gather where I am not strong there ought us to have put my money to the exchangers and then at my coming I should have received my own with the Azzurri take therefore the talent from him and give it unto him which hath ten talents but unto every one that hath shall be given and he shall have an abundance but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath and cassia the unprofitable servant into outer darkness there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth that's quite serious what the Lord's calling a ministry and the bride to do my whole drive at the moment with what the Lord has been showing me is to show the bride that she has a work to do you know you can't just stay at home and listen to tapes and be a I'm tape ministry or you know I belong to this church over an America or China or wherever it is and and and just build your own Little Kingdom at home and you've got this comfy little tent that you dwell under because you're not fulfilling the Word of God because there are people now that have no seed in them to accept this message but yet they have to this word has to be displayed before them and rejected because they can you know Jesus is a just judge and no one can be judged if they haven't heard the truth you know right verse 31 and I want you to see yourself in the sphere when the Son of man cometh and has glory and all the holy angels with him then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory because he's coming and the great white throne judgment with his glory and that's his bride the bride is the glory of Christ and now he's going to come and sit upon his throne of glory because the bride is sitting with Christ on that judgment see just as Easter was sitting on the seat with the king being able to write out the decree verse 32 and before him shall be gathered all nations and he shall separate them one from another as a shepherd divided his sheep from the goats and he shall set the sheep up on his right hand but the goats on the left then shall the King say unto them on his right hand come ye blessed of my father and here at the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world for I was hungry and he gave me me I was thirsty and you gave me drink I was a stranger and you took in naked and you clothed me I was sick and you visited me I was in prison and he came unto me then shall the righteous answer him saying Lord when saw we thee a hunger tore feed thee or thirsty and gave thee drink when saw we thee a stranger and took the end or naked and clothed thee or when saw we sick or in prison and came unto thee in the King show answer and say unto them verily I say unto you and as much as you have done it unto one of the least of my brethren ye have done it unto me so you can see that you walking in the fullness of this word upon earth you are a place that can be touched you're a mercy place but there's some important things in here too because there's a quote in the church age book that brother Brennan talks about this and he really drives us home that there's going to be people that will receive eternal life because of the way they treated the bride but then with a further study you find brother Brennan he also goes and he shows that he says you can not be both a sheep and a goat a sheep as a sheep it has a nature of a sheep and a goat as a go as a nature of a goat so just because a wicked sinner comes and does one good act to you and then carries on a life of sin he's a goat he's a goat maybe I hope it may account for him in some way but from what I can see in the word it doesn't but there are of people that love God they want to serve God they can't fully accept this word it wasn't given to them to be bribed but they loved the people that they loved Christian you know you've met those people I'm sure they love you and they want they they want to be around you they like your presence and they'll do anything they can for you but they just can't accept that word because they're a sheep has said there that the righteous it can't be a sheep and live like a goat but there is opportunity for people to reach out and touch you verse 41 then shall he say unto them on the left hand depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels for I was hungered and he gave me no meat I was thirsty and he gave me no drink I was a stranger and you took me knocking naked and you clothed me not sick and in prison and you visited me not you see the people have to reject you they have to accept this message or reject it and you say well how are people going to receive life without the blood of Christ well where as all the blood where does all the blood belong with Christ's blood it's on the body my blood does not dwell on the outside of my body the blood is and the body and Christ as Anna's bright and this bride is manifesting Christ and all the blood of crisis and the bride so they might not have redemption to be bribed brother Branham said there they're not an inheritor of anything other than life they just inherit life but you have such an opportunity to be out there among the people and been touched we can't build our own Kingdom and then shall they also answer him saying Lord when saw we thee a hungered or athirst or a stranger and naked or sick or in prison and did not minister unto thee the in shall I answer saying and fairly I say unto you in as much as you did it not to one of the least of these he did it not to me and they shall go away into everlasting punishment but the righteous and to evil and to life eternal and look now unless they how the denominational churches the so-called Bride of Christ that the leaders are treating the bride this message is under persecution has been labeled extremism they're rejecting mercy because it's the false vine that's coming up so to keep in balance with what I'm trying to show when we say no one was literally tuned to God in those silent days he's come to receive his bride the names that are written on the book but yet there as a place of mercy just not for the bride he's the bride of the ones with the names on the book but I just really say love that life be approachable you know be someone that can be talked to and if they reject you which you know Jesus said shake the dust off the sole of your foot you know and move on don't well you can argue with people but I don't believe and having debates with the devil I mean we just we have the word we have a vision and we go forth with the word so that blood when Jesus come forth with the book the blood the Christ left the mercy see when he come forth with the book but the blood of Christ is still in the body and it's still approachable skip out a few notes sorry let's go and read Matthew 7:21 because I want to bring a couple more scriptures unto this Matthew 7:21 not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name have done wonderful works and then will I profess unto them I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity there forever so here if these sayings and wine and do with them I will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock upon the true revelation not everyone that says Lord Lord will enter into the kingdom of heaven not even you know it says depart from me I don't know where they end up but these this is the church this is the church that have been prophesying in the name casting out Devils doing mighty works but they Jesus didn't even know them Luke 13 verse 23 then said one unto Him Lord are there few that be saved and he said unto them strive to enter in at the strait gate for many I say unto you will seek to enter in and shall not be able when once the master of the house has risen up and hath shut the door and began to stand without and to knock at the door saying Lord Lord open unto us and he shall answer and say unto you I know you not whence ye are then shall you begin to say we have eaten and drunken in thy presence and now has taught in our streets but he shall say I tell you I know you're not whence ER depart from me all ye workers of iniquity there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth when you shall see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets and the kingdom of God and you yourselves thrust out Christ is on the outside of this age and he's calling a bride to come out and meet him and unite with him but to the church to the seventh church age the door has been shut I just thinking upon this thought I was thinking you know the story of Rahab how did that prostitute that wasn't even it wasn't even in there and the the seed line how did she find mercy in the day of judgment it says now therefore I pray you swear unto me by the Lord since I have showed you kindness that ye will also show me kindness unto my father's house and give me a true token and dropping down a pit and the men answered her our life for your life every utter not the sour business and it shall be when the Lord hath given us the land that we will deal kindly and truly worthy she did a service and housing God's servants as they come into the land and now through that service she did when when we come into the land and there's a judgment coming we'll deal kindly and truly for their act that they did towards got a day off tomorrow don't we does that give me a bit of grace I wanted to look at the pool of Jesus ministry because there's a lot here that we can parallel because you know the bride each one of us you individually have to have a death to this flesh this flesh has to die it has to be crucified because to be remarried you can't remarry until they're old spouses did not divorce not put away God's original plan was there that must die and our flesh has to die out of our self and as Jesus was on the cross and his flesh died his spirit didn't die and has sold it and died but has just as flesh died on the cross and as they stabbed him in the side and the blood came forth and it was the bride coming forth out of her side and the first thing he does as he goes and he descends down into how to preach to the lost lost souls this is Jesus third pull of his ministry after he's died to the flesh after the bride has died to the flesh she has a third pull ministry to do he descends down to preach to the Lost and what I found interesting and this as Ernest these souls that are in prison are the ones that had rejected mercy up until Jesus day the ones that rejected Noah's message that rejected all the truth up until this point where Jesus was crucified their souls were in prison but Jesus hadn't been crucified year so he had to come and be seen by them and be and preached to them and they had already rejected the truth so they were lost but this is what the bride is having to do today there are people that are lost because they've already rejected the truth when they rejected it in heaven but now it's just manifesting and there was a gulf separated and this Old Testament and whether we're the Old Testament Saints where they were in a paradise right and there was a gulf where it said let Lazarus put forth his finger upon my tongue you know there was a gulf separating the souls and prison and this paradise and maybe I want to show it maybe another time and the dimension charts with brother Brendan breaks dimensions down into circles he says you draw a circle you draw another circle and the circle goes right around so now dimensions are going both ways so this is under the fifth dimension that this is taking place those souls are in prison and the fifth dimension and in that same dimension was the Old Testament paradise but there was a gulf that separated them now Jesus comes up from preaching to the Lost Souls than that fifth dimension and he takes those Old Testament Saints because now the Lambs been crucified and now he takes those souls up into the sixth dimension and he says the Old Testament paradise was done away was done away cuz now those Saints were in the sixth dimension he had taken them up and those dimensions continued and circles that's rather interesting so we preach to the souls that are in prison on this earth and at the same time we're also leading where the seed that's upon this earth bright that's upon this earth where re prophesying this word and seeing a bride come to life rise up we're calling a bride to come and rise up to a higher place right and then there's one more thing that was taking place in these three days that I thought was just amazing while we're preaching to the souls in prison why we're calling seed to come to life there's one more thing coming and taking place before the resurrection before this bride has resurrected this is all taking place right because Christ doesn't rise until that fair day Luke 24 verse 13 and behold two of them were that went the same day to a village called Emmaus which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs and they talked together of all the things which had happened and it came to pass that while they commune together and reasoned Jesus himself drew near and went with them but their eyes were holding that they should not know him so this was taking place in these three days before the resurrection before Jesus our sins and he said unto them what manner of communications are these that you have one to another and walk and I said and one of them whose name was Cleophus answered and said unto Him art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem and has not known the things which had come to passed and these days you know there's no need to be sad we're loving in the happiest day sons of God shouting for joy there is no reason to be sad Jesus himself has drawn near but we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel and besides all this today is the third day since these things were done then he said unto them oh fall slow of heart to believe all the prophets have spoken or not Christ to have suffered these things in it to enter into his glory and beginning at Moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them and all the Scriptures the things concerning himself and that is what Christ is doing now in the third poll and this time right now be as a manifestation being shown that the loss would reject knew see his bride rising up fruit coming forth into manifestation and Jesus Christ Himself is walking with us and he's revealing this word through every shadow and type of the Bible any city's revealing it in parables because you cannot take the Bible and read the seventh seal because it's silent and shut up but yet it's an every every type and in the Bible that's that's fully revealed and he is here but you have to walk with him and you have to let him draw near to you and show you and they drew nigh unto the village whether they win and he made as though he would have gone further but they constrained him saying abide with us for it is toward evening and the day is far spent I believe that this is the evening time and the day is far far spent and he went to tarry and to tarry with them and it came to pass as he sat with meat at meet with them and he took bread and he blessed her and he break it and he gave it to them and behold their eyes were opened and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight so though you can't see the physical manifestation of nail-pierced hands and are stabbed in the side body that's not what we're looking for we're looking for the word made manifest and as Jesus began to take the bread the meat of the word and break it and show you when you begin to eat that and you begin to see your eyes become open and now you see Christ and you say Christ is here and people say you're nuts you're crazy you have gone off the rails but they can't see him because it's a personal revelation that he comes to you and he starts to begin and reveal this book and then your eyes become open and now I read the Bible and I go well you know I don't read a story about I thought Noah I read a story about Jesus Christ you know every story I'm reading it's not just a book I'm reading about what's taking place in this day and they said one to another did not our heart burn within us while he talked with us by the way and while he opened unto us a scripture you know when you want to know why we're shouting for joy you know that's why I say I want to look that honey that you guys had an optimum and I want that here well we can have that here you know cuz my heart is burning within me from the things that he has shown me along the way and you can have the same experience of you walk with them this third full pull that's for the bride and it's knowing the mind of Christ and walking in the vision that's in this word and couple more quotes and we'll finish and look away to Jesus he says it's tightening that squeeze and then when that time comes and the priest comes to a place where you're pressed out then watch what I'm fixing to tell you in a few minutes watch the third pull then see it'll be absolutely to the total lost but it will be for the bride and the church now we are closer than it seems to be I don't know when but it's real real close I may be building a platform for somebody else to step on I may be taken before that time I don't know and that time maybe this coming week that the Holy Spirit will come and bring Christ Jesus and he may come this next week he may come yet tonight I don't know when he will come he doesn't tell us that but I do believe that Y that we are so close that I would never die with old age yet at 54 years old I'll never die with old age until he's here see you know how old brother Brennan would be today I think I worked it out of it a hundred and ten I wouldn't ever die with old age until he's here unless I'm shot or killed or something else some other way killed just old age wouldn't kill me until he's come I believe that and I want to say this I've never said it before but according to scripture according to what he said 33 years ago down on the river there in 1933 rather what he said everything has happened just exactly I may not do it but this message will introduce Jesus Christ of the world because he has to be accepted by the elect and rejected by the loss the souls that are in prison they have to reject him they have it's just a manifestation of the seed that's already in them the seed that was sown in the Garden of Eden the tears among the wheat Christ is here moving among us and he's to clearing all that scripture from revelation to generate - from Genesis to Revelation he's come here to dwell with you and molding and make you and has own image and to live in you and to take control you know and it's just yielding to him that death to the flesh you know you can't do anything to Christ until there's a death to this own carnal flesh and it's hard you know we all battle with carnal thoughts and carnal flesh and subconscious and conscience as Andy would often tell me and you know and it's true because you have to die to flesh before God can use you as musicians would come up the musician you know God has given the bride all the tools that she needs everything is here for you to raise from the dead and just before I come up and I didn't really get time to study it but I'm brother Brennan was showing how Christ died in the flesh as flesh died his spirit are send it unto heaven and a saw went down into prison so now here we stand upon the earth with our flesh slain crucified to our own will and desire our solar stuck down here in this miserable Richard place as Satan's eat and our soul is stuck here preaching to the souls in prison our spirits are send it to an open door and revelations for because we are now seated in heavenly places with Christ what our spur and brother branham said the only thing I mentioned it at the start he said but there's a law that's stopping us from speaking in our own world into existence right now there's a law there that's stopping there and I feel like you know my theophanies behind this fence and I'm so close to it that I'm trying to climb over that fence to get to my theophany but brother Branham says one day that bar will lift that law will break and the Spirit will come down and it'll meet the soul and then will rise and be an ell theophany bodies but there's a work that has to be done now and I'm so glad that I can say that I've accepted what he's done in this age and that we're walking in their vision I mean I thought maybe nursey rewrote my life would be a good song to say I'm sure
