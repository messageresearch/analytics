Chris with us God bless you amen praise the Lord welcome welcome amen well this is my last Wednesday here cuz next Wednesday we don't have a meeting then we're going to Camp then we're moving to the new church so and I won't be here on Sunday this is my last service it's been good here hasn't it the Lord's been good amen praise the Lord so on so on Sunday brother arand will be ministering and um we're going to have a bit of a testimony time if you want to give a short test not a preaching now a testimony of uh yeah so because we've been here about 11 odd years now I think CU Lilia was a baby and yeah we moved downstairs now we're here but amen things move on you know sometimes you you don't expect uh the last time but then there's a last time and there'll be a last time of last time I'm not preaching about tonight but there'll be a last time of last times one last day Hallelujah then we'll be raptured amen that's what I'm getting to amen so let's go to Exodus chapter 17 tonight and verses 14-6 amen so you never know when your last time is but hey God knows all about it amen so let's uh let's just go to Exodus 17 and: 14-6 and um we'll just read this is so this is after Joshua has fought against the amalekites we know uh Moses was commanded to raise his hands up and his hands were raised they won the battle when his hands fell down they're losing so Aaron and her held up moses' hands and they won the victory so now after after this is all done says and the Lord said unto Moses write this for a memorial in a book and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua for I uly put out the remembrance of um amalec from under heaven and Moses built an altar and called uh called the name of it Jehovah Nissi for he said because the Lord hath sworn that the Lord will have war with amch from generation to generation amen so let's bow our heads in a word of prayer amen this night you want to be remembered in prayer say Lord remember me as as as you pass by our way amen let's pray gracious Lord our hearts desires to stay in your presence Lord we want more of you my God we don't want to just rest on yesterday's experience though we are thankful for all you've done in our past but Lord we want to press on the to the mark of the high calling in Christ Lord we want more of you father we just pray as we've read your great Eternal Word Lord that once again Lord you will come the great author and anoint your word to speaker and hearer Lord have your way in our midst father those who are streaming those who are not well Lord touch their lives as well father may we be attentive may we be alert and may you have preeminence Lord and may your blood cover us forgive us all our wrongs our sins Lord make us more like You Lord For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen you can have your seats tonight so I want to just take a thought um from this how because I was I was very interested where I was reading this and and how the Lord told Moses to write this for a memorial in a book and this is actually the first time that it's ever recorded that something was written down in the Bible so so this is the first thing that that God actually tells Moses to write you know we know who wrote the first five books of the Bible but this is this is the first instance where something is written down for a memorial and it had to be rehearsed in the years of Joshua now to rehearse something is to repeat it it's to convey it it's to it's to relate it over and over again and and we know that uh uh that this what God has sworn that he will he will ultimately blot the name of the um of the amalekites um from from from he he he'll take the remembrance of um AMC from under Heaven that he's going to fight this war with the amalekites from generation to generation this this this had to be rehearsed this had to be repeated because the people had to realize that the God that was on their side was against their enemy now it's one thing you know we read the scripture in Romans chapter 8 that you know if God be for us who can be against us but if you take the flip side of that if God be against you who who can be for you right no one can be for you you can have the best everything but if God is against you you're going to lose okay now I'm not looking at those kind of people I'm looking at people who if God be for us who can be against us so now God would God would have the Lord write this down and he'd command that it would be rehearsed into the ears of Joshua now I find it interesting that it's not rehearsed into the ears of Moses but Joshua had to Joshua had to hear this and the reason is is that you know at this stage Joshua wasn't anointed to be the next leader after Moses but God and his mind knew that Joshua would take the people over into the land so so God knew that Joshua would need to know these words and it had to become very clear to him it had to be repeated to him not that it would become common but that it would become as alive and as fresh as when it first transpired amen so that's why when Peter would say he'd say in 2 Peter 1 he says for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always always in remembrance of these things though you know them and be established in the present truth yay I think it meat as long as I'm in this Tabernacle to stir you up by putting you in remembrance I mean so so Peter had the same kind of Burden I'm going to repeat some things amen I'm going to stir up your remembrance amen that these things don't become common they don't become a distant memory but they become alive and fresh just as alive and fresh as when it was first first instructed now Joshua was going to take the people into the land you know there was going to be a time of transition where where Moses would go off the scene and Joshua would become the leader of the Israelites and so we we are living in a time of transition ourselves we are moving from this building to another building we're going into a different season you know we are going to another church that's bigger because we need to make room for prodal we need to make room for God's children amen we need to make room for more it's not just us for no more amen we're not the Frozen chosen amen we're here you know to be a lighthouse that of you know that that there's room at the End Amen that people can come and meet the Lord like we all have amen but so we're living in this time of of transition but during this time of transition we got to realize that that our God that fought the enemy in the previous generation is going to fight that same enemy in the Next Generation now when we're talking about the amalekites here we know we don't fight against flesh and blood but we fight against spirit spiritual wickedness in high places we fight against demonic anointings and but so God when he was to me when he was speaking of the amalekites now he was speaking of what he was going to do to the devil and his angels that he was going to fight against him from generation to generation amen that it wasn't just going to be like in Revelations 12 that Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and his angels and he prevailed not was cast down now that's the end of it no Our God pursued his enemy upon the Earth right he's been pursuing him down through down through since the beginning of time since the war started amen he's been pursuing his enemy fighting his enemy and he's not going to stop until that enemy is in the Lake of Fire hallelujah our god is persistent amen so so the so our lord Jesus is going to blot the name of Satan from out from not just under heaven but in heaven his name is going to be no more because his life is going to be no more there's no such thing as an eternal hell it comes to an end all the devil and his angels whoever ends up there is going to cease to be then then they're not going to be in um existence no place right so God is saying that he's going to absolutely annihilate his enemy and do away with him but friends when he is no more we shall still be amen we'll be dancing on streets of gold because we're are Eternal right brother ramam says if you ever have eternal life you you always had eternal life because Eternal had no beginning and had no end you just recognized that when you received the word of your day amen that seed came to life and you realized who your papa is which is God Amen so praise the Lord so if God before us who can be against us now we know that that that our our nature was the enemy of God but then God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son right so whosoever believeth him shall not perish but have eternal life so when we were his enemy he died for us amen that his that that his life would come into us change your nature to be like his nature and that his atoning blood would cause us to become one with him and we' be in perfect Oneness with him he changes our nature to do that amen so now he so he's going to use now now I'm sorry if I'm jumping around a lot but I'm just wanting to lay a bit of a foundation because every generation God's going to fight this battle who's he going to fight it through through human beings this this this battle was Angelic Warfare then it came into to human beings right and now God is going to anoint his sons and daughters in every generation to defeat his enemy amen that's where he's going to that's where he's going to win the battle is in human beings amen just like the Lamb of God our lord Jesus what did he do he became flesh to take on human battles am mean to fight this war because when God said I'm going to fight this war from generation to Generation Well then there had to be a generation a Believers in every generation to fight and win this battle coming out packing the victory amen so this battle now it shifts As Time shifts it's still God and Satan fighting but the conditions of the a ages change right people don't change but you know we live in a different age than there was 2,000 years ago we're living in the seventh Church age we're living in a different time right but so it so the battle moves from generation to generation and God would prophesy what how the Warfare was going to be done he would anoint Isaiah and said there' be a voice of one crying in the wilderness right in Isaiah 40:3 to prepare the way of the Lord he would say in Isaiah 9 and6 For unto us a son is given unto us a child is given his name Shall be Called Mighty the Everlasting father you know the Prince of Peace right so prophesying of the Lord Jesus to come and so now but then also he would he would prophesy of an end time people that would be the final voice to the final age cuz this battle's got to end right it's not just going to continue on and time's going to go on just like us being in this building we weren't going to be here forever right and now the time has come it's it's over well you Sunday but you know what I mean like we've come to our end maybe we didn't expect it but now it's say it's like you know when you're planning for a wedding you know the wedding's coming sometimes it can see seem very far away but then the day comes and you're in the dress and you're there or you're standing you're waiting for it to come in but it's like you've been waiting so long and then finally it's like this rapid change of events and things everything comes into place and you know maybe you thought months before how's this ever going to happen where is it going to happen what's going to who's going to come and all these things and then the guests come and the your invitations go out the food is all pln everything begins all the planning sits in and then you just see it it's like where did that day go but it seemed see and it's like the Scripture it seems like it's been a very long time thousands of years sometimes scripture has been sitting there seemingly dormant brother B said it's been circling the earth waiting for its season of fulfillment remember Malachi when he prophesied in Malachi 4 behold I send you Elijah the prophet that was 400 years before John the Baptist or any what we call the New Testament era and it's been circling the earth for a long time but then when the age came right when the battlefield came to God's what God saw in his mind would come in the earth he say now is the season and there's a rapid change of things have happened as even as Daniel would say when he was wondering when you know he saw the Visions you know the symbolic uh you know the prophecy the end time and everything and he and and he asked God God when are these things going to happen and and and and God says go th Way Daniel for the book is sealed to the time of the end many shall run to and from knowledge shall increase and see if you look at technology it's like hasn't really ramped up much malachit and he did not fully obey the uh the word that God gave even saved the king alive Samuel had to kill King AAG and you know the those things that transpired and then you know it's amazing when when when God moves with a season he makes sure that if there's any failures in the previous season they're done away with because the because God doesn't want the devil to have anything to hang over your head you take the you know you take the sons of Kora for example it says in the book of numbers that they did not die with their father Kora so when K and Dayan gathered the princes of Israel and they they went to withstand Moses kora's Sons weren't with him so when the earth swallowed up Cor and day and all and everyone that gathered they didn't gather but yet they would have had a stigma attached with their name oh you're the son of Kora we all know what Kora did and there would have been even though they didn't do it there would be a stigma attached with their name now because of what their forebear did but God would God would cause it that they would not always live under that because God inspired David to gather the sons of Kora because they were going to be gathered to the temple am me to to to be anointed you know with the inspiration that God gave David he gave it th you know those songs he gave to the sons of Kor how many have read the Psalms to the sons of Kora right and then so he caused the sons of Kor to be anointed to sing those songs Under inspiration to show that the stigma of what their forbear did did not disqualify them I mean from being part of the worship of God you even look at um Esther in the Bible we know the Book of Esther you know Esther was from The Tribe of Benjamin Mor was from from Kish where Saul came from so that so that so that incomplete victory that that their forbear had God was going to say I'm going to cut that off and God would use people from that same line that same tribe am mean to stand in a foreign land a morai didn't bow he obviously purposed in his heart I'm not going to serve God incompletely I'm going to serve him completely I'm not going to do like my forbid did right and God made him that way because God wanted to cut that thing off their family line that it wouldn't be over them anymore and then Esther we know that she just said well if I perish I perish and she went in before the king we know these things but God used them to wipe that from what you know to because the because the battle came down to a Next Generation so the incomplete victory of a previous generation was not undone in the Next Generation you can see that with Martin Luther you know we're having you know uh Halloween is actually the same day that the Reformation officially started it's Reformation day so we can celebrate too if you want chocolate go for it but you know we can celebrate too because it was the day that Martin Luther took us 91 thesis and nailed it to the CH uh Church door so it's Reformation day so the devil's got nothing on it's not Halloween to me it's happy Reformation day everyone that's when the bride started to be cut loose from denomination but you see now as as they were coming out of of the Catholic Church there was a lot of things hanging on them they did not completely ES ese but God but but God was fighting a war from generation to generation bringing his bride out bringing Victory but it was not a complete Victory right but then under the message of Malachi 4 amen God has inspired his word to cut off every man-made Dogma everything that the devil can hold against the church has been struck off I mean because this is the season of complete Victory I mean this is the season where where the devil is completely under the feet of the Bride of Jesus Christ amen cuz God said he's going to fight this battle from generation to generation amen remember the the battle is not ours the battle is the Lord's amen he said but he's got to find willing vessels to fight this battle through amen that is that is you and I but you see it's so vital amen because because this is a because this Warfare continues from generation to generation amen it it is absolutely vital that every generation has its own Revival I mean every generation has the word live in their lives that it's not just saying well you know it's all very good to share brother braham's stories of what God did in his life which is important to share but that's his testimony what about our testimony what about Jesus Christ the same yesterday today forever in 20124 what about him living today that's why every generation must have its own Revival amen his own chance at the word brother Bram said because that's the only way we can win this battle is with the spirit of Revival with God living in our midst with us with a complete selling out to the word of God and letting him live amen that's the only way we can win this battle amen and God has inspired us to win this battle I me remember we're anointed to win we're not anointed to lose we're not anointed to lose we're anointed to win amen but we're living in a Time amen where I believe we're the last generation when brother Bram said that there'll be young men that will take this message to the coming of the Lord I believe we're here what about our children do we plan for them absolutely cuz I'm wrong I don't mind being wrong but so we you know we want to we want to live like it's now but then live like it's 100 years time amen we want to prepare the Next Generation because they are the Church of today amen most of the band was under 30 even on a full band time well that's the that's the what what some people say is the Church of tomorrow no it's the Church of today amen and that's what we had to prepare for right that the Next Generation amen will rise up take their position in the word of God Amen that that they will have their own Revival why do we have camp that every generation will have its own Revival why do we have church that every generation will have its own Revival amen that they will see the Living God for themselves hallelujah amen amen so these things have to be rehearsed we got to realize that if God before us who can be against us this is I know I um you I spoken before in Romans chapter 8 but you know he would say Paul would say and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are called according to his purpose for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren morover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he ified them he also glorified what shall we say what shall we then say to these things if God be us who can be against us amen so if he's already called Justified and glorified in God's mind it's already done amen so so so then the Apostle Paul now he says now what can we say to these things then if God in his mind sees a called Justified glorified bride then if God before us who can be against us see we're not called just haphazardly we're not here just haphazardly amen we are here for a purpose God called us because he knew we would receive his word amen God God released this message to the Earth but when he when he had the prophet speak it he had you on his mind that you would receive it and it would live in your life amen so if we have God for us then it doesn't matter what the devil hatches against us it will not Prosper remember no weapon formed against us shall prosper there may be a lot of spirits in this day but we don't have to fear none of them that doesn't mean we just LAX and loose and whatever more no but we're got to realize whatever comes against you will not stand amen amen hmon hmon who was an agot and am malachite he couldn't stand against isra and Mori no matter what position he was he became prime minister of the greatest Empire at that time he couldn't stand amen he had to come down so it doesn't matter what is hatched against us amen it will not stand now there's many things that have been written down in the scripture and not just in the scripture well in heaven now Jesus would send out his 70 he' send out his disciples he gave them power and authority over all unclean spirits he said go out two by two preach the gospel cast out Devils heal the sick and raise the dead they came back this is in Luke uh 10:17 and the 77 returned again with Joy saying Lord even the devils are subject unto us through thy name and he said unto them I beheld Satan as lightning fall from Heaven and brother Braham said that this was actually Satan falling from his position of power because the church was Raising in power he says behold I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you amen so nothing can hurt us praise the Lord not with understanding in this Rejoice not he's basically saying no no you're rejoicing actually in the wrong thing it's good to rejoice in those things but there's a greater thing he's basically saying now listen I want you to actually have a greater perspective than this because there'll come times when it seems like God hasn't answered prayer then what are you going to do it seems like the answer doesn't come as quickly as it has in the past then what are you going to do it seems like the more you pray the worst the situation gets and then what are you going to do see we got to look beyond what we see you say well my timeline is very different to God's absolutely we all want this but God says no I'm not always going to give you this sometimes I will but I don't love you any less if I don't give you it like this you see because if we get everything just like that we become spoiled there's no character being formed see God Is Not What what God is interested in is looking down and seeing a group of people or individuals that look exactly by in in terms of character exactly like him when he looks down he sees his own word on display he sees his own nature his character that's what he sees when he sees his bride right that's what he's interested in the Rapture is going to be God taking his character from the earth he's taking his attributes part of himself that's what the Rapture is going to be right amen so he says you know I've given you this power and this power is still here Mark 16 is the true church in action brother Bram said amen and we are I Believe by God's grace the bride is Mark 16 in action right but he says not withstanding in this Rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you but rather Rejoice because your names are written in heaven amen so there is a you know there's a greater rejoicing when we realize our names are written in heaven amen not just on a church book not that we have a church Church book with names not just cuz you're on a WhatsApp list whatever you know but no that your names are written in heaven now the reason I believe that Jesus would say this I I think Christian and I were talking about this um a while ago but the reason you know Jesus would would would say this is because what can happen is people can become arrogant they can become arrogant thinking they're like Rambo and they can do whatever they want whenever they want and and God will have to obey what they say God don't want arrogant Christians God resists the proud gives grace to the humble see you know there can you an attitude can come in among Believers the book's open to me I'm an adopted son of God now it's just me now Jesus was never like that he said the son can do nothing till the father shows him and what the father does he does likewise right he says it's not me that doeth the works but the father in me doeth the works right so he never took he never took any um credit for anything based on what he did because of what he did he said it's always the father that does it right so so we never want to let a and and even brother Brown would say in the message humble thyself he says if you want to get somewhere with God never let an arrogant Spirit ever come around don't let No Malice come no matter what anybody says if they're all wrong don't you never build up a complex against that person see you be sweet and kind remember God loved you when you're in sin and if the spirit of God is in you you love the other person when he's been wrong see just pray for him and love one another above everything love God and love one another and be humble with God and around one another and God will bless it and it's hard telling what he will do amen amen so we never want to let an arrogant Spirit come around us to think that oh I did that or I said this or I did this no that's why Jesus I believe said to them no no don't rejoice in that that the spirit's are subject un you but rather Rejoice because your names are written in heaven because you begin you know when you really begin to think about that my name was there before I ever knew it God by the blood of the Lamb would write my name on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world Amen that before I ever turned up before there was any Star molecule or anything God thought of me God thought of me he knew the age I'd be born in he knew the pressure that would come upon me he know the trouble I would go through he knew everything that would happen but yet before any of that could ever come into existence he made a way for me to overcome that problem am mean because the lamb was slammed before the foundation of the world am mean so before the devil was ever created your name was on the book amen so now if your name is on the Lamb's Book of Life because as um it's says in Revelations 13 that everyone worshiped the Beast whose names were not written in the Lamb's Book of the life slam from the foundation of the world right so so if God if God wrote your name in glory before there was anything then how yeah I know I've said these things before but rehearse these things in the years of Joshua right I'm rehearsing some things because I believe the more we realize who we are and the we're not going to shake as the world shakes we're not going to fall apart as the World falls apart right we'll have greater confidence in our God than ever before amen so there so if our names were written before there was anything how can the devil you know and it was done in eternity how can the devil ever undo what God has done how can he do it in time when God has already done it in eternity he cannot do it amen so the so Jesus is telling his disciples don't Rejoice uh you know in that but rather Rejoice that your names are written in heaven you say well Judas was among them and that is true and now I'm not going to speak on the you we know there's the Book of Life in the Lamb's Book of Life your brother says one runs into the other The Book of Life not everyone's name is on the Lamb's Book of Life but everyone's name is on the book of life and judas's name was on the book of life right and and on that book names can be rubbed out like Judas but people who are on the L book of life doesn't matter what they've done it can't be rubbed out praise God Amen so brother would say this he says he says uh speaking of the two books he'd say it's like your natural life is The Book of Life then it runs into the Lamb's Book of Life he's like he says it's like a stalk of wheat it just grows from one form to another but then the life doesn't stay when when when wheat is growing it doesn't stay in the you know it it eventually gets into the seed so that first part of the plant becomes dead right so when you're born it's just you know and then you come to an age of accountability then God starts in heaven starts recording all you've done you know it starts recording but then but your name is already on the Lamb's Book of Life but God's got to deal with your book of life because there can't be anything held against you on that day or even this day right so what happens is then there Comes A Time and God when when you receive the Lord right God gets a hold of you you confess your sins you realize you're lost then what happens the blood of Jesus Christ comes down takes your book of life and dips it in the sea of God's forgetfulness right and when he pulls it out it's all blank pages Hallelujah why because the blood has cleansed it completely amen and now what are you living you're not living your book of life anymore but you're living from the Lamb's Book of Life so your identity in who you are is the word of God that so the first part was your natural life but then when you become a Christian you live a different kind of life which is from the Lamb's Book of Life praise the Lord and then now we come down to this age John would be a representation of the Bride you know in the Book of Revelation I hope I'm not boring you tonight John John would be John would be a symbol in the book uh of a of a group of people and we know as brother says one man in a Vision represents a whole body of people and and we see uh at the end of the Lan Church age your re your Revelations 4:1 your John says now um that same voice I heard it in heaven a door was open in heaven and a voice said come up hither so John was translated up into Glory representing the bride body of Jesus Christ raptured in the end time but then now John is standing there because because there's something that happens when when the book comes open and you see yourself and John was standing there he heard the uh you the angel the you a strong angel cry out who's worthy to take the book he could see the book was in the hand of the original owner on the throne of God you know it was God you know was in God's possession and John looked around he saw no man was found worthy to take the book or even look upon it you know to loose the seals and and John began to weep much because he realized if there was no man found worthy then then the the the Plan of Redemption was stalled God could not restore if there's no man found worthy the angs were worthy but they had never been men right they never they never been men but then you know as he was crying you know all the prophets were there but they weren't worthy doesn't matter how perfect of our life they told even Joseph the only thing held against him was a lie that he told his father to tell Pharaoh that's the one Mark held against him in the whole book of Genesis he wasn't worthy because they're all born they're all born with a fallen nature but then when he was weeping one of the elders came to him and said weep not John for the lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed and he turned and he looked he saw the lamb so he saw that one that he that he that he went fishing with and he saw the one that you know that stood at lazarus's tomb said Lazarus come forth he saw that one that died on Calvary he saw that one that resurrected in a glorified form he saw him step forth and then now when John when John saw him take the book and everyone begin to Rejoice because remember in that scene is actually all the redeemed see you're in that scene you're in that scene right everyone is in that all of God's redeemed are in that scene cuz thou has redeemed us back to God by thy blood right so now John begin to rejoice and he be and it says that everything in Heaven and Earth and under the Earth heard him cry out blessings and honor and glory to the lamb amen and and why what happened because when the lamb opened the book what happened John saw his name on the book and brother Braham said old John who had been standing there a brother crying why he said everything in heaven everything in Earth everything in the sea heard me holler amen blessings honor and might and power be to him that lives forever and ever talk about a happy time when them seals broke John must have looked in past the curtain of time um and said there's John amen he is so happy everything in heaven everything heard him cry out why so there he was standing on the aisle of Patmos which was a prison Colony Island but by Revelation he looked past a curtain of time and he saw himself standing around the throne Redeemed by by the blood of the Lamb Hallelujah and that's why Jesus told the disciples in Luke no Rejoice that your name is written in heaven amen and it became so real to John by Revelation amen everything heard him cry out rejoicing to the Lord hallelujah and would not that have given him a greater stability in his life than anything else I mean do you know that when the word comes open to you God does the same thing am me when you hear the voice behind the voice you realize it's more than a prophet speaking to you amen it's it's more than just ink on paper that you're reading but it's God himself expressed amen what is that God opening his book to you revealing that your name is on his book Hallelujah so now we can Rejoice well what has this got to do with the amalekites what's got everything to do with that battle because you realize if I'm there already if I've got representation there if my theophany is already there amen there nothing in this battle can take me out nothing in this battle can take me out remember the Warfare may change because we're living in an age of lukewarmness we're living in the age of ladyo the devil see the see the worst thing we can ever come to is think we don't need any more of God well I'm comfortable I'm fine God's done a lot for me I still love him but I'm okay now what we should have a hung see that's a lukewarm Spirit trying to just keep us in a plateau that doesn't mean you don't have your salvation but where's your Victory right so so that's the most because that's how the devil's Warfare Works in this age we're comfortable we're fine we're good I'm fine I know in whom I have believed all yeah and all that's very true but he just wants us just to plateau and be comfortable right but we shouldn't be like that we should realize that's a weapon formed against us it can be the most subtle thing that'll ever come against anyone is I'm I'm okay I don't need more well you know but if we can identify that is a lukewarm Spirit trying to rob us of our joy and our Victory amen but we got to realize that thing when it comes against us it's not going to win it's not going to prosper no the victory Jesus won at Calvary is going to come into full manifestation in this age amen why because the dead in Christ are going to raise our bodies are going to be changed and we're going to be gone amen so I believe while while we're still upon this Earth let's keep saying Lord I want more of you I'm just going to finish with this thought this is this is my last comments to you in this in this building say Lord I Want More Of You Lord thank you for all you've done for me you've done so much for me Lord but I want more of you Lord I want to see your word come more alive to me Lord may you become may you more mean more to me more now than you did when you first found me Lord may I love you more may I treasure you more may I have a greater desire to see you live amen you say well how can we a total in order I just say this a total Victory I'm just going to surmise this whole thing let's completely surrender Our Lives into the hands of the Lord like never before and let him have his total way a total Victory okay cuz God says I'm going to fight against the devil from generation to generation so this battle's come into our generation so say Lord use me to finish this battle cuz there will be the last one coming somewhere we were talking we were driving um when we're driving to church you the girls asked um you we asked them I don't I don't know how the conversation started but you know they but but I asked them how long was was was Israel uh in Egypt for one of them said 400 years I think Christine said it was actually 430 years and they said well why the delay well there had to be a delay because many things had to happen because because there certain ones had to be born and also God allows a delay because there's the parable of the man who has all the wealth he gives his talents to his servants and he goes off to a far country Jesus speaks of it and then and then and then one of the servants when it re when they think oh he's he's delaying his coming they get drunk and they begin to strike their fellow servants that when the the master comes back at a time he did not expect so people going to think well God's delaying his his coming there's a purpose in it to see what's really in our hearts and also there is people that H you know that God has to delay is coming for cuz there's children of his that need to come in like you take for example you know Rahab was ordained to be married to Solomon who was the prince of Judah right General in Judah that through that that marriage eventually the you know the lineage of Jesus Christ came through them so if they left Egypt in uh at the 400 year mark and they went straight into the Promised Land land she wasn't there if they left Egypt and didn't wander for 40 years she wasn't there so there was all this delay because she had to be there and God ordained her to be there at that present time amen she she may think the Lord is delaying his coming he's actually right on time our timing is not his timing so while we're here let's run let's love the Lord let's serve him you say Lord let through me these last few however long we may be here for Lord because you said you will fight against the enemy from generation to generation till his name is totally blotted out from under Heaven amen so so to me God is telling me you're going to win I'm going to fight this battle the battle belongs to me ien let's have the musicians tonight please I want say God bless you amen amen
