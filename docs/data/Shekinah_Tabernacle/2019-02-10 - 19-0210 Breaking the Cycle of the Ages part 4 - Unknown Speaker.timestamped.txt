[55:38] Lord trust you feel at home I mean it's
[55:40] great to have a brother Chris off the
[55:41] boat to feel welcome great to have you
[55:46] here I mean let's uh let's turn to
[55:48] Leviticus chapter 25 and I've got a bit
[55:51] of a PowerPoint of it's there are we on
[55:58] so I'd like to continue oh here we are
[56:00] yeah good so let's go to Leviticus 25
[56:03] I'd like to continue on this sort of
[56:05] breaking the cycle of the ages but I
[56:08] want to go in a slightly different
[56:09] direction today so Leviticus chapter 25
[56:16] so I think I see 24 we'll read from
[56:18] verse 8 down to verse 13 and thou shalt
[56:25] number seven Sabbath's of years unto
[56:27] thee seven times seven years in the
[56:29] space of the seven Sabbath's of years
[56:31] shall be unto thee forty and nine years
[56:33] then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the
[56:36] Jubilee to sound
[56:38] on the tenth day of the seventh month
[56:40] and the Day of Atonement show you make
[56:42] the trumpet sound throughout all your
[56:44] land and you shall hallow the fiftieth
[56:46] year and proclaim Liberty throughout all
[56:49] the land unto all the inhabitants
[56:50] thereof it shall be a jubilee unto you
[56:53] and you shall return every man unto his
[56:55] possession and ye shall return every man
[56:58] under his family a jubilee shall be that
[57:03] fiftieth year be unto you ye shall not
[57:06] so neither reap that which growth of
[57:09] itself in it nor gather the grape in it
[57:11] of I why a vine undressed for it is the
[57:15] Jubilee it shall be holy unto you you
[57:17] shall eat the increase arrived out of
[57:19] the field in the year of this Jubilee
[57:22] you shall return every man under his
[57:24] position and then we're going to turn
[57:26] somewhat emphasize that every man shall
[57:28] return unto his position let's go to the
[57:31] Book of Luke and we're gonna read a
[57:34] familiar piece of scripture so I want to
[57:37] who enjoyed the service on Sunday here
[57:40] Amen praise the Lord so yes I did so
[57:44] that I thought was tremendous and and I
[57:48] was just amazed because what I want to
[57:49] speak on I want to actually when we had
[57:52] community washing I want to actually
[57:53] cancel it and and preach this and that's
[57:55] what you'll see who ties them with my
[57:56] brother Isaac brought so it's just I
[57:58] think it was wonderful have the Lord
[58:00] ties things together but anyway let's go
[58:03] to Luke 4 and verse 17 the very familiar
[58:05] piece of Scripture I trust to us here
[58:08] but this is such as Jesus when he goes
[58:10] back to Nazareth he goes to the
[58:12] synagogue in and the and the scroll has
[58:15] given to him and she said there was
[58:17] delivered unto him the book of the
[58:18] prophet Isaiah
[58:20] and when he had opened the book he found
[58:22] the place where it was written the
[58:24] Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he
[58:26] has anointed me to preach the gospel to
[58:29] the poor he has sent me to heal the
[58:31] brokenhearted to preach deliverance to
[58:33] the captives and recovering of the sites
[58:36] of the blind to set at liberty them that
[58:38] are bruised to preach the acceptable
[58:41] year of the Lord and he closed the book
[58:44] and he gave it again to the minister and
[58:46] sat down and the eyes of all them that
[58:48] were in the synagogue were fastened on
[58:50] him and he began to sound
[58:52] damn this day is the scripture fulfilled
[58:54] in your ears
[58:56] amen may the Lord bless the reading of
[58:58] his word you may have your seats this
[59:00] morning so what do I want to continue
[59:02] about breaking breaking the cycle of the
[59:05] ages where we read in Leviticus 25 that
[59:09] become a time of Jubilee where everyone
[59:11] who wasn't bondage wasn't slavery they
[59:14] would return unto his possession and and
[59:19] now I want to take this from a from a
[59:22] different angle where we're living in a
[59:25] day an hour where man by society and by
[59:29] what happens to man has become detached
[59:32] from the rest of the world and that's
[59:34] not just I'm not talking about us and
[59:37] nature I'm talking about us emotionally
[59:39] with our spirit realm with our family
[59:42] with brothers and sisters those around
[59:44] us that the devil has come in in such a
[59:46] way in this age where he wants to and
[59:49] and by society by things around us he
[59:52] has actually tried to disable the
[59:54] effectiveness of our faith because our
[59:57] souls have been redeemed right so our
[1:00:00] souls are sealed unto the day of our
[1:00:02] redemption we know where we're going if
[1:00:04] you've really met the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:00:06] I mean his word has come open to you in
[1:00:08] this hour you've really met him you know
[1:00:09] where you're going right but so the
[1:00:11] devil can't get your soul but he can he
[1:00:13] can afflict you a sickness and he can
[1:00:15] get into your spirit realm and he can
[1:00:17] eat and put complexes and bruises in
[1:00:19] there to disable your faith and it's not
[1:00:22] effective anymore so this is where I'm
[1:00:24] going okay but so when when we read that
[1:00:27] every man shall return unto his position
[1:00:29] now this is now we know that in the Old
[1:00:31] Testament it was a parcel of land you
[1:00:33] know in the promised land but our
[1:00:35] position is our position in Christ right
[1:00:37] we are seated in heavenly places in
[1:00:39] Christ Jesus we have a Dominion you know
[1:00:41] the devil is under our feet and his
[1:00:43] works but the thing is so if we're going
[1:00:45] to return to our position then then we
[1:00:47] have to be made in such a way that we
[1:00:49] could minister what's been given to us
[1:00:51] to those around us so you know part of
[1:00:54] that return to our position is that
[1:00:56] everything the devil is put unto us that
[1:00:58] is trying to our walk with God
[1:01:00] has to be done away with so so that is
[1:01:03] part of the Jubilee where we go free of
[1:01:05] we go free of complexes we go free of
[1:01:08] you know brokenness pain hurt whatever
[1:01:10] it may be we go free of it I mean it
[1:01:12] hasn't said it when the trumpet sounds
[1:01:14] and we know we're living in the Day of
[1:01:15] Atonement I met with the time it was
[1:01:17] shared 2,000 years ago the high priest
[1:01:20] has come out to reveal the blood was
[1:01:22] given on your behalf
[1:01:23] then the jubilee trumpet has sounded and
[1:01:25] now we have to return to our position
[1:01:27] we've heard the gospel trumpet we have
[1:01:29] to go free we have to return it's a law
[1:01:31] in the word you have to return to your
[1:01:33] position so this is where we have to go
[1:01:35] but the thing is we have to fight for
[1:01:38] every inch of ground I mean we can't
[1:01:40] just sit back and say well the God will
[1:01:42] do it no faith says it's mine right now
[1:01:44] faith does not say one day face here's
[1:01:46] today it's my promise today it's my
[1:01:48] inheritance today I'm going to get what
[1:01:50] I need I'm not going to wait for
[1:01:52] tomorrow today that's what faith sees
[1:01:54] amen so we we want to press it and we
[1:01:57] want to take what belongs to us now I
[1:01:59] read this in Luke chapter 4 because when
[1:02:01] the son of man Jesus Christ came the
[1:02:03] first time when he read went into the
[1:02:06] synagogue and he and yoke he didn't just
[1:02:08] read from random from the scrolls but he
[1:02:10] found in Isaiah this piece of Scripture
[1:02:12] because that was prophecy speaking of
[1:02:14] what his ministry would do when he
[1:02:16] became flesh right so now and we
[1:02:19] understand that this the speaks of our
[1:02:21] day because when you read the prophecy
[1:02:24] on Isaiah he Jesus left out the last
[1:02:28] part of the last verse I said and the
[1:02:30] day of vengeance of our God which spoke
[1:02:32] about a second coming but now but when
[1:02:34] the Son of Man comes this is going to be
[1:02:36] his ministry he's going to sit he's
[1:02:38] going to you know he's going to and so
[1:02:41] he's going to sit me he's going to heal
[1:02:44] the brokenhearted he's going to preach
[1:02:46] deliverance to the captives and the
[1:02:47] recovering it aside to the blind and is
[1:02:50] set at liberty them that are bruised now
[1:02:51] all of these things are actually
[1:02:53] speaking of in our spirit realm
[1:02:55] speaking about through our spirit realm
[1:02:57] so now I'm just gonna I'm just gonna say
[1:03:01] this here so so to be brokenhearted
[1:03:04] though I'm just going to break this down
[1:03:06] because we can we can read it and just
[1:03:08] go plum over the top of the significance
[1:03:10] of it but I want to just break it down
[1:03:12] so brokenhearted means to crush
[1:03:15] completely that is to be shattered
[1:03:17] literally or figuratively
[1:03:19] breaking pieces broken to shivers that's
[1:03:22] what to be broken hearted so someone
[1:03:25] who's been has actually been heartbroken
[1:03:27] now before a gondor's I should say we've
[1:03:30] all been affected negatively by this
[1:03:32] world by our upbringing by people around
[1:03:35] us by circumstance so we can either have
[1:03:37] a complete mental breakdown or something
[1:03:39] can just affect us just a little bit but
[1:03:41] we're all affected right so it's just
[1:03:43] like any natural disease it can be
[1:03:45] really bad or not so bad be the same
[1:03:47] disease so when I go into this please
[1:03:50] don't take it as well that's not for me
[1:03:52] this is all for us cuz the devil wants
[1:03:54] to disable our faith he doesn't want God
[1:03:56] to flow through us like he should
[1:03:58] amen so now so to be brokenhearted means
[1:04:01] to be crushed completely there's just to
[1:04:03] be shattered breaking pieces now a
[1:04:05] captive as a prisoner of war and we can
[1:04:09] become captive to a complex we can come
[1:04:12] captive to a Bruce just like naturally
[1:04:16] if I've got a big massive bruise on me I
[1:04:18] can't run I can't do the things I do if
[1:04:19] I'm healthy physically speaking you know
[1:04:22] but once I'm healed then I can do what I
[1:04:24] used to do so you know so to be a
[1:04:27] captives me means to be a prisoner of
[1:04:29] war this is from the Strong's
[1:04:30] Concordance if you're wondering now to
[1:04:32] be blind a blindness it means to opaque
[1:04:36] as a smokey that is by an LG blind
[1:04:38] physically or mentally blind so a
[1:04:41] blindness can come on us where maybe we
[1:04:43] can see 20/20 vision naturally but
[1:04:46] spiritually our eyes become clouded over
[1:04:48] so we become blinded and to be at
[1:04:51] liberty means you get your pardons these
[1:04:53] are deliverance of forgiveness a
[1:04:55] remission and bruised means to be
[1:04:58] crushed so I'm going to read the verse
[1:05:00] again with all that included in he says
[1:05:02] the Spirit of the Lord is upon me
[1:05:04] because he has anointed me to preach the
[1:05:05] gospel to the poor he has sent me to
[1:05:08] heal the brokenhearted that as those
[1:05:10] have been crushed completely that as
[1:05:11] those have been shattered right
[1:05:13] emotionally be shattered been crushed to
[1:05:16] preach deliverance to the captives those
[1:05:17] who become prisoners of war they meant
[1:05:20] and a recovering of the sites of the
[1:05:22] blinds of those who couldn't see they're
[1:05:24] physically or mentally I mean their eyes
[1:05:27] come open to see that Liberty which is a
[1:05:29] part in a deliverance of forgiveness and
[1:05:31] liberty a remission
[1:05:33] then that a Bruce those have been
[1:05:34] crushed we've all been crushed to a
[1:05:37] certain extent by by life whether we
[1:05:40] like it or not we all have been but the
[1:05:43] anointing of the Son of Man is here the
[1:05:45] son of man Jesus Christ is present as
[1:05:47] well this message brings son of the son
[1:05:49] of man here and this is the Ministry of
[1:05:51] the son of man as you set us free right
[1:05:55] that we can walk with the Lord like he
[1:05:56] wants us to walk now we have to
[1:05:59] understand there are unfortunately there
[1:06:02] are powers and complexes right there are
[1:06:05] I don't want to I'm not wanting to
[1:06:07] elevate the works of the devil but
[1:06:09] someone can be can can't can have a pain
[1:06:12] or wound in their spirit and all they
[1:06:14] see is through that their whole view is
[1:06:16] skewed by something that has happened to
[1:06:19] them and so now so someone can be heard
[1:06:22] in the past and then now that hurt their
[1:06:24] carrying and it wounds their spirit and
[1:06:26] then now how they see everyone else is
[1:06:28] because of that but the people that
[1:06:30] they're now maybe dealing with or living
[1:06:32] with they they weren't back there but
[1:06:35] they're still carrying a wound God
[1:06:37] doesn't want us to carry words he wants
[1:06:39] us to be whole and healthy and well I
[1:06:41] mean so now and this is so so this isn't
[1:06:48] a return and Jubilee brother brems sees
[1:06:52] here he sees and in this Jubilee every
[1:06:55] man that had lost his inheritance by
[1:06:57] some means if he was a free born a
[1:07:01] true-blooded israelite no matter who
[1:07:03] held the possession it had to go back to
[1:07:05] him free he didn't have to pay a thing
[1:07:08] he didn't have to do a thing but just
[1:07:11] stop what he was doing and go back to
[1:07:14] his inheritance oh my he had a right to
[1:07:16] it that was God god-given right because
[1:07:19] he by grace had it here today and it
[1:07:22] would be given to had been given to his
[1:07:25] fathers and handed down year after year
[1:07:27] no matter what had taken place if he
[1:07:30] lost it it must go free if it meant to
[1:07:33] grace sorry it meant grace is way
[1:07:37] provided for each individual to return
[1:07:39] to their rightful inheritance what a
[1:07:41] picture it gives us tonight of the
[1:07:43] church in these last days you see what
[1:07:46] man
[1:07:47] do and then you can see what God does
[1:07:49] what man does is failing and will fail
[1:07:52] has failed and always will fail but what
[1:07:56] God does is eternal must for every make
[1:07:59] nothing can ever take it away God give
[1:08:01] it it's a free gift and and by sovereign
[1:08:04] foresight saw it and placed it and
[1:08:07] there's nothing can ever move it it's
[1:08:10] there eternally and jubilee was God's
[1:08:13] manner of expressing grace to his people
[1:08:16] for restoring or bought or be bought
[1:08:19] back to their rightful position so we're
[1:08:23] in an hour where we're call to return to
[1:08:24] our rightful position how lujah now and
[1:08:28] in second Timothy Paul was writing to
[1:08:32] Paul is writing to Timothy and he's
[1:08:35] dealing a lot in the book of Timothy
[1:08:37] about Timothy's current state now
[1:08:40] Timothy is a young young minister he is
[1:08:43] told to do the work of an evangelist
[1:08:44] there is a gift there's a ministerial
[1:08:47] gift in his life and the devil has been
[1:08:50] bombarding Timothy trying to get him off
[1:08:52] the field now this when I'm speaking
[1:08:55] about this this is not just a preacher
[1:08:56] this is all of us the devil as I said
[1:08:59] wants to disable our faith amen he wants
[1:09:03] to stop us being effective for God's
[1:09:05] kingdom right but God wants you to be
[1:09:07] effective I mean for his kingdom but
[1:09:10] it's your free moral choice I mean who
[1:09:13] are you going to allow are you going to
[1:09:15] be a love prison of Jesus Christ and to
[1:09:17] overcome every circumstance of life or
[1:09:20] are you going to be a prisoner to a
[1:09:22] complex it's really your choice because
[1:09:25] God is a gentleman the devil's not a
[1:09:27] gentleman but God is a gentleman he
[1:09:30] respects if you want to stay bound he
[1:09:32] respects your choice it sounds crazy
[1:09:35] doesn't it but God respects your choice
[1:09:37] I mean animals weren't put on a free
[1:09:40] moral agency but man was and God
[1:09:42] respects the choice of man so if you
[1:09:44] want to stay bound you will stay bound
[1:09:46] it's your choice
[1:09:48] I mean God has has shaken every
[1:09:50] spiritual gift to us in this age he's
[1:09:52] come down and revealed himself as the
[1:09:54] son of man he's opened his word as
[1:09:56] fullness I mean the creative powers been
[1:09:58] manifested the full power of the Cross
[1:10:00] being manifested in the ministry brother
[1:10:02] branham in the state to show us that
[1:10:04] Jesus Christ is alive but it's your
[1:10:06] choice will you actually partake of it
[1:10:07] will you become one with the word or
[1:10:09] will you sit back with your complex it's
[1:10:12] really that you know what do you want
[1:10:14] you want to walk free or do you want to
[1:10:16] stay the thing is that but you think
[1:10:21] well this happened to me and this
[1:10:22] happened to me in life sure it did
[1:10:24] happen I'm not diminishing anything
[1:10:27] that's happened to us in life but there
[1:10:29] is a power in this room the power of the
[1:10:31] blood is present that you don't have to
[1:10:34] live in the past anymore you can't walk
[1:10:37] in newness of life if you want to right
[1:10:40] so why dwell in the past
[1:10:42] man never met man never learns from
[1:10:45] history history repeats itself because
[1:10:48] man is still man doesn't matter how well
[1:10:50] they document history you know they try
[1:10:53] to live in the past they never learn
[1:10:54] from their mistakes why live in the past
[1:10:57] walk in newness of life so then he's
[1:11:01] he's telling Timothy here when when I
[1:11:04] call to remembrance the unfeigned faith
[1:11:07] that is in thee which dwelt first in my
[1:11:10] grandmother Lois and my mother Eunice
[1:11:13] and I am persuaded as in the also
[1:11:15] wherefore I put the in remembrance that
[1:11:18] thou stir up the gift of God which is in
[1:11:21] thee by the putting on of my hands for
[1:11:23] God has not given us a spirit of fear
[1:11:25] but of power and of love and a sound
[1:11:29] mind that's what he's given us and all
[1:11:32] of us have a gift we have the gift of
[1:11:34] faith right God's God gives us faith I
[1:11:38] mean the believer doesn't look wolf by
[1:11:40] human faith the Apostle Paul said the
[1:11:42] life I now live I live by the faith in
[1:11:45] the Son of God so the life he was living
[1:11:47] by was that by the faith of Jesus Christ
[1:11:49] himself it wasn't his own faith right so
[1:11:52] when God gives us real faith it's his
[1:11:53] faith in us I mean since our he is
[1:11:56] commanding Timothy I mean to stir up the
[1:11:59] gift of God that that is within him
[1:12:01] hallelujah and that gift is ultimately
[1:12:04] faith because we all have a gift world
[1:12:06] gifted people Holly doesn't matter if we
[1:12:08] can't sing to save ourselves or we can't
[1:12:11] play nothing we can't you know but we
[1:12:13] have a gift that is a gift of faith I
[1:12:15] mean we you can come and you can sing
[1:12:17] and worship God and you can create an
[1:12:19] atmosphere that God comes down around
[1:12:21] you I mean that that God would touch
[1:12:23] those next you God would touch you
[1:12:24] hallelujah
[1:12:25] that's the gift of faith a brings God on
[1:12:27] the scene hallelujah and that's what we
[1:12:32] want to do amen so God is here to send
[1:12:37] us free of these things so we have to
[1:12:40] stir up the gift so notice notice that
[1:12:44] Paul tells Timothy you know this is the
[1:12:49] secret of her bottom overcoming there's
[1:12:51] stir up the gift of God that's how he's
[1:12:53] to overcome stir up the faith I mean so
[1:12:56] don't look at don't major on the
[1:12:58] circumstance right but focus on your
[1:13:00] faith that you have I mean you follow me
[1:13:03] that's what you've got to do now I heard
[1:13:08] brother Isaac read this one he says and
[1:13:11] when they had preached the gospel to
[1:13:13] that city and had taught many they
[1:13:16] returned again to Lystra and to Iconium
[1:13:19] and to antioch confirming the souls of
[1:13:22] the disciples and exhorting them to
[1:13:24] continue in the faith that we must
[1:13:27] through much tribulation enter into the
[1:13:30] kingdom of God
[1:13:31] see toddlers not going to be a flower
[1:13:32] beard of East but through much
[1:13:34] tribulation you will enter into the
[1:13:36] kingdom now this word tribulation means
[1:13:39] a pressure means to be afflicted and
[1:13:41] anguish burdened persecution tribulation
[1:13:44] trouble through much so through much
[1:13:46] pressure I mean through much affliction
[1:13:48] through much anguish much burdens much
[1:13:51] persecution much trouble much
[1:13:53] tribulation you will enter into the
[1:13:55] kingdom of God so now there's a there's
[1:13:59] we and we are the same through much
[1:14:02] tribulation will enter the kingdom of
[1:14:04] God but the thing is God allows the
[1:14:07] tribulation to or anguish to to come our
[1:14:10] way is because he knows his salvation is
[1:14:13] greater than anything that devil can do
[1:14:15] so doesn't matter how the devil may try
[1:14:17] and disable our faith I mean God is
[1:14:19] greater than then the work of the enemy
[1:14:22] hallelujah
[1:14:23] so now so brother
[1:14:26] season faith I'll just turn that off
[1:14:28] faith cometh by hearing you know because
[1:14:31] the thing is okay what I'm going to go
[1:14:34] to is this this there's a there's
[1:14:37] something in psychology where it speaks
[1:14:39] about emotional detachment where people
[1:14:42] become actually emotionally numb to
[1:14:45] their loved ones to people they know so
[1:14:48] they don't actually feel anything they
[1:14:50] become numb and it's a coping mechanism
[1:14:52] because of great trauma people actually
[1:14:55] become emotionally detached so they
[1:14:57] can't actually enter into someone they
[1:14:59] can't feel with any empathy to those
[1:15:01] around them they can't they don't have
[1:15:03] any feeling for the people and it's
[1:15:06] because of circumstance that it happens
[1:15:08] because of trauma and things happen to
[1:15:10] people and they withdraw within
[1:15:12] themselves and they lose their feeling
[1:15:14] for the people now I'll just read this
[1:15:18] and then I'm going to go to where
[1:15:20] brother Brown speaks about it so so
[1:15:23] faith cometh by hearing no but God
[1:15:24] doesn't want us to be numb God doesn't
[1:15:27] want us to be business like a mint but
[1:15:30] we we need to have real feeling for one
[1:15:31] another
[1:15:32] how can you bear each each other's
[1:15:34] burdens if you don't have a feeling for
[1:15:36] what they're going through you say but
[1:15:38] that's just the spiritual realm
[1:15:39] God gave us a spiritual realm when we
[1:15:42] become believers our feelings don't turn
[1:15:44] off right we don't become robots I mean
[1:15:46] but God anoints our fiction our
[1:15:48] conscious imagination reasoning memory
[1:15:50] affection he anoints those things to use
[1:15:53] them amen for his glory that's like if
[1:15:55] you like the woman of the world she
[1:15:57] remembered having a man problem she was
[1:15:59] with six Jets
[1:16:01] well she had five husbands once she was
[1:16:02] worse she wasn't married to a minister
[1:16:04] she knew what it was like to look for
[1:16:06] love in all the wrong places right but
[1:16:09] then she met the son of man at the well
[1:16:10] she met her real husband right and she
[1:16:13] left her waterpot and she ran into the
[1:16:15] city amen and she ran to those that
[1:16:18] actually rejected her she went to the
[1:16:20] well at a time when the other woman
[1:16:21] didn't go to the well why she wasn't
[1:16:23] welcome right but so she had this pain
[1:16:26] and complex now where these people have
[1:16:28] rejected me and this is how my life is
[1:16:30] gonna be and she was trying to look for
[1:16:32] love in all the wrong places and this is
[1:16:33] how she was but then she met the son of
[1:16:35] man
[1:16:36] I mean and the very ones that rejected
[1:16:38] her she ran back to television Messiah
[1:16:40] is here hallelujah
[1:16:42] and so now and so now she becomes a
[1:16:45] believer and there's nothing new Under
[1:16:47] the Sun so the things that we go through
[1:16:50] we have fought and overcome the next
[1:16:52] generation will fight and overcome right
[1:16:54] but then someone comes into the church
[1:16:56] maybe you know she's maybe be married
[1:16:58] divorce whatever you know and she can
[1:17:01] and the woman at the well could enter
[1:17:02] into her burden she could say I know
[1:17:04] what it's like to be where you are and
[1:17:07] she can share her history so God can
[1:17:09] anoint her memory of where she was and
[1:17:12] God can use that memory in that pain
[1:17:14] that she had but was healed from and she
[1:17:16] can enter into someone other sisters
[1:17:18] need and she can pray for her and she
[1:17:21] can be delivered Allu yeah but if she's
[1:17:24] just emotionally separate she said oh
[1:17:26] that person just needs to grow up and
[1:17:28] hurry up and grow in the Lord and just
[1:17:29] you know and just look at his the rules
[1:17:31] and regulations and have no feeling
[1:17:33] what's happened then the devil's
[1:17:34] disabled the woman at the well if she
[1:17:37] was that way but if she but she met the
[1:17:39] son of man so she wasn't emotionally
[1:17:41] detached right and she could enter in oh
[1:17:44] yeah that's why we're safe for many
[1:17:47] different places because there's not a
[1:17:50] case that someone can walk in these
[1:17:52] doors and and and eventually be set yeah
[1:17:54] I I was that way
[1:17:56] I lived that way I was lost I was
[1:17:59] because people come in and they say and
[1:18:02] they and they look at you and they say
[1:18:03] these people have been Saints avoids
[1:18:05] being say so as will be Saints they
[1:18:06] don't understand me they can't relate
[1:18:08] and and and really you're going to say
[1:18:10] well hold on sit down and talk to us for
[1:18:12] a little bit hallelujah and actually
[1:18:14] they'll walk out shocked I can't believe
[1:18:17] they were that way Holloway up but God
[1:18:19] transform gold sorry Ron amen hallelujah
[1:18:23] so so we don't want to and this is a
[1:18:26] very real problem especially in this
[1:18:29] country where's the stoic but at a
[1:18:32] fix-all but the stoic kind of the
[1:18:35] British stuff step up a look whatever
[1:18:38] that means you know just kind of hold it
[1:18:40] all in and be a man about it you know
[1:18:42] and and what is it
[1:18:44] societies become emotionally detached
[1:18:47] had a fix man and woman based on what
[1:18:50] has happened to you so so so brother
[1:18:53] Brahim sees here but we don't have to
[1:18:56] live that way that's why I want to read
[1:18:58] this now what could I do
[1:19:00] what could I say I say this my friend to
[1:19:03] every one of you in the name of the Lord
[1:19:05] Jesus Christ that every person in here
[1:19:07] was healed when Jesus died at Calvary
[1:19:09] it's your possession I ask you to raise
[1:19:11] your hands who was Christians your hands
[1:19:13] went up everywhere you have a legal
[1:19:15] right to everything that Jesus died for
[1:19:17] he died for he died his death there at
[1:19:21] the cross and gave his life that you
[1:19:24] might have the legal rights to every
[1:19:26] redemptive blessing he died for it's
[1:19:28] yours
[1:19:29] you're just afraid to possess it you're
[1:19:32] afraid to claim it
[1:19:33] look when God told Moses go take the

[1:22:01] why do we have to put up with it amen
[1:22:05] so why don't we get rid of it now I'll
[1:22:09] Lou you so now brother Brown would come
[1:22:12] I'm just gonna I'm just gonna read this
[1:22:15] well actually it's really a few
[1:22:16] scriptures first actually no I'll read
[1:22:19] this first because you think well you're
[1:22:20] just preaching psychology no the Prophet
[1:22:23] went through this this is cool this
[1:22:24] isn't standing in the gap I'm sure we've
[1:22:27] all heard that
[1:22:28] I'm gonna read part of the story he said
[1:22:32] now so I got up about four o'clock and
[1:22:34] got started driving Billy was sleeping
[1:22:36] we went into a place and I was thinking
[1:22:38] on my mind you know what one of these
[1:22:41] days as soon as I can get the wife up
[1:22:43] there this is northern British Columbia
[1:22:45] you know he wanted he had plans to be
[1:22:47] become a what your Old Testament prophet
[1:22:50] live up in the woods away from
[1:22:52] everything because of how people were
[1:22:54] treating him he was responding to how
[1:22:56] people were treating him here was here
[1:22:58] was the messenger to the aged he wasn't
[1:23:00] just a you know just meet the Lord the
[1:23:02] day before he was the messenger to the
[1:23:04] he'd been through a lot of hardship if I
[1:23:07] knows his life story a lot of trials and
[1:23:09] here he was and he had gotten to a place
[1:23:11] you see the devil if he can just get you
[1:23:14] to agree with him then he's got you
[1:23:17] right and and he can put a thought at it
[1:23:20] and it could look it was so good right
[1:23:23] but it'll try and take you off the path
[1:23:25] and and you know it always agrees with
[1:23:27] your flesh it always agrees with this
[1:23:30] guy so whatever you've always wanted to
[1:23:33] be brother bear boys wanted to be a
[1:23:34] trapper and a hunter so he gets this
[1:23:36] idea in his mind I'm gonna go up in
[1:23:38] northern British Columbia no one really
[1:23:40] around I'm just gonna hunt here I'm
[1:23:41] going to be a guide why cause it
[1:23:43] appended to what he really wanted to be
[1:23:44] in his human nature and it's the same
[1:23:47] thing with us the same thing can happen
[1:23:49] well you say I'm not a hunter yeah but
[1:23:51] there'll be something and the devil get
[1:23:53] it in your mind all you've always wanted
[1:23:54] to do this and this and this it'll take
[1:23:56] you away from where God wants you to be
[1:23:57] I mean so now and I'm gonna tell her I
[1:24:04] love this place so well no need of us
[1:24:07] going anywhere let's just stay here and
[1:24:09] that's back from civilization eleven
[1:24:12] hundred miles from anywhere see way in
[1:24:14] the wilderness I thought boy won't that
[1:24:16] be fine I don't have to get a haircut I
[1:24:19] don't have to dress up I'll just be a
[1:24:20] regular Mountaineer that's what I've
[1:24:22] always wanted to be see now he's
[1:24:25] pandering to what he's always wanted to
[1:24:26] be and I said I've got some guns and
[1:24:29] some people give me and I'll guide like
[1:24:31] you've never heard of I'll just love it
[1:24:33] then if the Lord tells me to go down and
[1:24:36] tell somebody something
[1:24:37] all right now and tell them and come
[1:24:39] back again I'll help bud and we'll
[1:24:41] really have a real place here I was
[1:24:44] thinking on that so he still deals till
[1:24:47] late
[1:24:48] spiritual component we're still a
[1:24:50] religious component you have the Lord
[1:24:51] calls me I'll go so I'm gonna be here
[1:24:54] and there's how the devil comes in with
[1:24:56] reasoning cuz you know the Lord oh oh
[1:24:57] yeah oh I'll still be a believer I'll
[1:24:59] still do this now but it's gonna
[1:25:01] separate you away we went into a
[1:25:04] restaurant to eat a little place in the
[1:25:06] mountain about just about 11 sorry seven
[1:25:08] o'clock I was getting real I was getting
[1:25:11] a little late so I worked Billy up we
[1:25:13] were out of gasoline so I had to get
[1:25:15] some gasoline and when
[1:25:17] this little place this little restaurant
[1:25:19] and while there a man came across the
[1:25:21] street maybe a teeny but older than I
[1:25:24] was but he looked like a man to me he
[1:25:27] had a pair of overalls overall jacket
[1:25:30] riding boots a black cat whiskers down
[1:25:32] his face like this snow-white has his
[1:25:36] hair hanging out from under back of his
[1:25:39] hat I thought that looks like a man not
[1:25:41] some soft lazy with a cigar in his mouth
[1:25:43] about that long with a little bit of
[1:25:46] shorts on or around some patio or
[1:25:48] swimming pool some pot-bellied Easterner
[1:25:50] like excuse that expression but somehow
[1:25:53] the guy looked like a man to me hard
[1:25:55] rough look like he lives with God made
[1:25:57] man to live and I was admiring him and
[1:25:59] he came into the restaurant and ordered
[1:26:01] some pancakes and there and say there's
[1:26:03] about 15-20 people he had to sneeze and
[1:26:06] you know how some people will cut ass
[1:26:08] piece a little bit pardon me but he let
[1:26:11] out a big healthy good sneeze katroo my
[1:26:16] it looked like the windows blasted when
[1:26:19] he did it nobody did say nothing no sir
[1:26:21] I said Billy there is a man after my own
[1:26:24] heart see the devil always put something
[1:26:26] in front of you that you actually want
[1:26:28] to become if you start walking down a
[1:26:31] carnal way always does it look so
[1:26:34] appealing against it seems so right but
[1:26:35] it's so wrong and why what's happening
[1:26:38] it's because it's because of a
[1:26:40] detachment you lose your feeling for the
[1:26:43] people and that's why people isolate
[1:26:45] themselves as they lose a feeling from
[1:26:47] fellowship they lose a feeling for
[1:26:49] church
[1:26:50] you know they lose a feeling even for
[1:26:52] the lost and they just withdraw
[1:26:53] themselves but it can appear so
[1:26:55] spiritual because I'm out in the woods
[1:26:57] I'm out in nature with God but there's
[1:27:00] God wants you out in nature with him
[1:27:01] nothing wrong without being out in
[1:27:03] nature right but you don't want to
[1:27:05] separate yourself and be a man of
[1:27:06] isolation or a woman of isolation for
[1:27:09] that matter and you can be isolated
[1:27:11] sitting in your pew right here you can
[1:27:13] be a total Island to yourself right here
[1:27:16] right now because you can be living you
[1:27:18] can be you could have a massive family
[1:27:20] but you can be an individual in that
[1:27:22] family because you've detached yourself
[1:27:24] because of trauma trying to protect
[1:27:26] yourself by what's around you now so
[1:27:30] he came into the restaurant and ordered
[1:27:33] some pancakes
[1:27:34] iced over at that time Billy there's a
[1:27:35] man off I'm after my own heart
[1:27:37] he said Oh daddy you don't want to be
[1:27:40] like that's what that's me in the future
[1:27:42] see I said that's me and I sit there a
[1:27:46] little bit and Billy looked up at me and
[1:27:48] kept on eating his pancakes and I was
[1:27:50] finishing mine and a few minutes
[1:27:52] somebody in a booth right right around
[1:27:56] front of us where the board's this way a
[1:27:58] back of the booth I couldn't see around
[1:28:01] a man got up that looked exactly my
[1:28:04] profile about 75 years old little buddy
[1:28:08] fellow his clothes tied on him ragged
[1:28:10] and a buddy that got up with him was was
[1:28:13] Fletcher boy exactly gray hair hanging
[1:28:17] on his face and Billy looked around said
[1:28:18] daddy that looks like you and Fletcher
[1:28:21] you can imagine how I felt and the
[1:28:23] little fellow looked like me wobbled you
[1:28:27] they had been standing over a campfire
[1:28:29] with smoke all over them faces dirty I
[1:28:31] think their breakfast together the man
[1:28:33] must have paid 20 cents maybe a cup of
[1:28:35] coffee or something
[1:28:35] my heart bounced within me and I watched
[1:28:37] and Billy said what's the matter with
[1:28:39] you
[1:28:39] I said nothing and I watched that and
[1:28:42] they went around and went out and he
[1:28:43] said daddy what's the matter with you I
[1:28:45] said nothing and he go in the car and
[1:28:47] then he said you mind driving again I
[1:28:49] said no he said I'm still sleepy so he
[1:28:52] went to sleep and I went speeding down
[1:28:54] the road about 55 miles an hour in the
[1:28:57] truck over the mountain coming on
[1:28:59] towards the border coming home to
[1:29:00] Arizona and I was coming now into Utah
[1:29:03] and as I got there coming down from the
[1:29:06] mountains about 20 miles an hour
[1:29:08] just as you heard of it as I told you
[1:29:10] about the morning about the squirrels
[1:29:12] and all these things was somebody went
[1:29:14] to talking with me a voice just the same
[1:29:16] as you as you hear mine I know it sounds
[1:29:19] neurotically
[1:29:21] but as I've got through expressing have
[1:29:24] I ever told you anything but what was
[1:29:25] right a voice got to talking I was
[1:29:28] talking to him it said carry out your
[1:29:30] plans and you'll be like that I said
[1:29:34] lord I don't want to be like that
[1:29:35] said your wife will go to she won't live
[1:29:39] up there in them hills like that and
[1:29:41] you'll become a bum just a
[1:29:44] you dreamed it just as your dreams show
[1:29:47] you would I said I don't want to be that
[1:29:49] I don't want to live like that I want to
[1:29:52] do something different but I was told
[1:29:54] that and he and you called me to be a
[1:29:57] prophet and I want to live in the
[1:29:58] wilderness like a prophet but I was
[1:30:01] using my own my own excuse so I could
[1:30:05] hunt my own good amen
[1:30:08] and he said but that's what the prophets
[1:30:11] of the Old Testament you've been called
[1:30:13] to a much higher office than that he
[1:30:15] said you've got more gifts besides that
[1:30:17] you was called to pray for the sick and
[1:30:18] to preach the gospel and an episodic
[1:30:21] form and you know of greater things many
[1:30:23] great gifts he said why do you wait for
[1:30:25] me to move you every time you move where
[1:30:28] is your reward being I seen and then
[1:30:31] said do you remember he told me do you
[1:30:33] remember what brother Robeson I mean
[1:30:36] yeah told you in your dream in his dream
[1:30:39] or vision that you have done like Moses
[1:30:41] you forgot the feeling of your people
[1:30:44] you forgot the call that I called you to
[1:30:48] I let the sick lay I want the Lord to
[1:30:51] tell me where to go not to go that's
[1:30:53] wrong I built myself a complex because
[1:30:56] the people didn't hear my message and
[1:30:59] God forbid that I'll try to compare the
[1:31:02] life of now like Moses that's exactly
[1:31:05] what Moses did the people wouldn't
[1:31:06] listen to him when he came to deliver
[1:31:08] them so he just left him alone and went
[1:31:10] into the wilderness so God turned him
[1:31:12] around and he had long forgot the
[1:31:15] suffering people he said well I'm not a
[1:31:20] minister I'm not a messenger to an age
[1:31:22] but the thing is what did what did the
[1:31:25] Lord put his finger on the reason he was
[1:31:27] going that way is because he forgot the
[1:31:29] feeling of the people's amen and it's
[1:31:33] the same thing with us if we forget the
[1:31:35] feeling if we lose feeling for one
[1:31:37] another then we can be here in a church
[1:31:41] but you can be an individual as opposed
[1:31:43] to being part of a body amen and that
[1:31:46] will eventually member his mind started
[1:31:48] going and he then he wanted to say well
[1:31:50] this is how I'm gonna be and he had all
[1:31:52] laid out in his mind I'm gonna be up in
[1:31:54] the wilderness this is how it's gonna be
[1:31:55] but God even told her if you go that way
[1:31:57] you'll end
[1:31:58] like those two men you saw but brother
[1:32:01] Brown never envisage that he would end
[1:32:03] up that way he he had a wonderful
[1:32:06] picture in his mind he's going to be a
[1:32:07] hunter and a guide up on the wilderness
[1:32:09] his family's still going to be there if
[1:32:10] God calls him your guide of the world
[1:32:12] has said I say the Lord preach do
[1:32:13] whatever and go back but the devil only
[1:32:16] paints us a good picture the devil
[1:32:19] anoints our affection and he never looks
[1:32:22] at the negative that will happen
[1:32:25] are you following me because he paints a
[1:32:27] picture you can do this you can do this
[1:32:29] and where does it ultimately it leads
[1:32:31] you out from being part of the body of
[1:32:33] Christ and I want to talk about these
[1:32:34] four walls any part where the believers
[1:32:36] are God God has called us to be part of
[1:32:39] a fellowship right I believe we should
[1:32:41] all have a home fellowship right we
[1:32:43] should have a place where we're we're
[1:32:45] part of the body and God places us in
[1:32:47] that body wherever it is as the
[1:32:49] scripture says to forsake not the
[1:32:50] assembling of ourselves together for as
[1:32:52] much as you see the time approaching and
[1:32:54] we see the time is here hallelujah I'm
[1:32:56] glad the time is here so because the
[1:32:59] thing is we are not here for ourselves
[1:33:01] right the Christian life like our Lord
[1:33:04] Jesus did he come upon the earth for
[1:33:07] himself he came from glory for you right
[1:33:10] he died for your sins he took your place
[1:33:13] took your sins upon himself went to hell
[1:33:15] on your behalf see you don't need to go
[1:33:17] and then ascended on high victorious he
[1:33:20] lived for others and we're to be like
[1:33:22] Jesus he said this is very elementary
[1:33:25] this is very vital right so so we're not
[1:33:28] here I'm not here for myself you're not
[1:33:31] here for yourself we're here for one
[1:33:33] another we need one another I mean the
[1:33:36] body has to work in unity you know as as
[1:33:38] David says in the Psalms blessed as the
[1:33:41] unity among brethren it's like the
[1:33:43] anointing all that goes on you know off
[1:33:45] off Aaron's beard
[1:33:46] what so what he's saying is now Aaron
[1:33:48] had to be anointed to go into the Holy
[1:33:50] of Holies to serve in the high priests
[1:33:52] office and he's saying that when is
[1:33:54] unity among brethren that the body can
[1:33:56] function as it's meant to function
[1:33:59] hallelujah amen and that's how we should
[1:34:02] be and I believe we have unity but we
[1:34:05] should contently brotherly love continue
[1:34:06] I mean we should fight for what we have
[1:34:09] and we shouldn't just settle back where
[1:34:11] we should fight for more
[1:34:12] hallelujah why get comfortable we're not
[1:34:15] called to get comfortable I'll be
[1:34:16] comfortable in the Millennium and then
[1:34:18] and then when he turned he rolls on
[1:34:19] that's where I'm gonna rest let's press
[1:34:22] the battle while we're here why not why
[1:34:24] not amen so he forgot the feeling of the
[1:34:27] people because they were they the people
[1:34:30] didn't hear his message so because of
[1:34:33] how people were responding to the
[1:34:35] ministry then it made him hard and he
[1:34:38] lost the feeling of the people we're not
[1:34:42] to be like that season proverbs 18:14
[1:34:45] the spirit of a man will serve sustain
[1:34:48] his affinity but a wounded spirit who
[1:34:52] can beer and and this is I've got it
[1:34:59] here a wounded spirit errs as same as a
[1:35:02] broken spirit and a wounded spirit who
[1:35:05] can beer beer means lift up made me so
[1:35:09] we are we are not immune from this so
[1:35:13] you know people can have wounded spirits
[1:35:16] you can be wounded amen but the thing is
[1:35:20] now what are you gonna do with the wood
[1:35:21] are you gonna nurse it are you gonna get
[1:35:24] healed
[1:35:24] I think healings a lot better than
[1:35:26] nursing a word amen people who get badly
[1:35:30] wounded they rush to A&E or they call an
[1:35:32] ambulance they want to get fixed
[1:35:34] hallelujah it's the same this is the
[1:35:36] house of deliverance a man proverbs 1819
[1:35:40] a brother offended as harder to be one
[1:35:42] than a strong city and then contentions
[1:35:45] are like the bars of a castle
[1:35:47] I mean someone who's offended well the
[1:35:49] happens they put up a wall
[1:35:51] and he's saying it it's harder to to to
[1:35:55] win that person then conquer a city
[1:35:57] that's walled a strong city
[1:36:00] I mean why what's happening because
[1:36:02] people are hurt and they put up a wall
[1:36:06] Matthew 24:12 and because of iniquity
[1:36:10] and because iniquity shall abound the
[1:36:12] love of many shall wax cold so because
[1:36:15] an iniquity is abounded in this age me
[1:36:18] too to know the truth and not do it
[1:36:21] iniquity has abounded in this age but
[1:36:23] because iniquity is abounding the love
[1:36:25] of
[1:36:26] I shall wax cold so it's the iniquity it
[1:36:28] will affect people and their love will
[1:36:31] wax cold because of what they see you
[1:36:34] following me this is what Jesus is
[1:36:36] saying in the end time this is what's
[1:36:37] going to happen right but we're not
[1:36:39] we're not called to let the iniquity of
[1:36:42] the world disable our faith because
[1:36:44] brother amp says either your faith will
[1:36:46] paralyze the world or the world will
[1:36:49] paralyze your faith
[1:36:50] it depends what you're going to do about
[1:36:52] it I would rather let my faith paralyze
[1:36:55] the world holy that's why we have
[1:36:57] god-given free is that the world is
[1:36:59] under our feet the devil's under our
[1:37:01] feet that we have dominion over
[1:37:02] everything hallelujah amen hallelujah
[1:37:08] likewise he husbands I'm just going to
[1:37:10] drop through a few of these but likewise
[1:37:12] he husband's dwell with them according
[1:37:14] to knowledge your wives giving honor
[1:37:16] unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel
[1:37:19] and as being heirs together of the grace
[1:37:21] of life that your prayers be not
[1:37:23] hindered now to dwell with them
[1:37:26] according to knowledge is to understand
[1:37:28] their emotional state you following me
[1:37:31] amen it's not just a working
[1:37:33] relationship it's not just now your wife
[1:37:35] I'm husband this is how we do things no
[1:37:37] you've got to dwell with them according
[1:37:39] to knowledge right you've got to know
[1:37:41] you actually have to enter into their
[1:37:43] burdens and knees like they do the same
[1:37:45] with you you should be emotionally
[1:37:47] connected to your spouse wholly you
[1:37:50] shouldn't be separated that's wrong
[1:37:52] that's not becoming one flesh amen
[1:37:55] but the thing is now that's the
[1:37:57] challenge is to maintain the connection
[1:38:00] that's why many marriages fail well what
[1:38:03] is it's based on selfish love self-worth
[1:38:07] not real love but number two is because
[1:38:09] there's a there's a separation between
[1:38:12] the two before they actually physically
[1:38:14] separate there's a emotional separation
[1:38:16] why because they put up walls it's you
[1:38:19] know we are going to hurt one another
[1:38:22] amen
[1:38:24] I will disappoint you all right and you
[1:38:27] may disappoint me from Dondon because
[1:38:30] we're human right we are aren't we yeah
[1:38:33] I meant we're human we're people we're
[1:38:35] still we're redeemed people but we're
[1:38:37] people right so we will do
[1:38:39] Oh point one another it's inevitable you
[1:38:43] can't we can't help it
[1:38:44] we're all brother ham says that we still
[1:38:47] have the sticky nature this is first
[1:38:49] nature that we still have even though we
[1:38:51] have rapturing faith in our souls even
[1:38:53] though we are are an overcomer in here
[1:38:55] this faith sorry this flesh will
[1:38:57] disappoint us and it will disappoint
[1:38:59] yourself too
[1:39:00] amen the thing is now that doesn't mean
[1:39:03] we just put up walls and we you know
[1:39:04] separate ourselves we're not a bunch of
[1:39:07] individuals I mean we are the ransomed
[1:39:10] redeemed body of Christ by one spirit
[1:39:13] we're baptized into one body hallelujah
[1:39:17] so we have to always remember that Amen
[1:39:22] so and just like how I don't think I
[1:39:24] have it on here but but the Apostle Paul
[1:39:26] says in the book of Hebrews do not let a
[1:39:28] root of bitterness ether in where many
[1:39:31] are defiled why because life will make
[1:39:34] us either bitter every experience in
[1:39:38] life will make you better or bitter but
[1:39:41] it's your choice will you give it to the
[1:39:43] Lord and it will become bitter or will
[1:39:46] your life be bitter because of your
[1:39:49] experience
[1:39:50] it's your choice right just how just how
[1:39:52] you know in the Old Testament there were
[1:39:54] six cities of refuge where a man could
[1:39:57] run and a woman can run in right before
[1:39:59] the case was heard as a refuge the
[1:40:01] seventh is always Christ right so Christ
[1:40:04] is our refuge where is Christ today he's
[1:40:07] in his people program says deity is not
[1:40:09] inhibited sinew it's not just in heaven
[1:40:12] deity God as the Holy Ghost in you
[1:40:14] that's Jesus Christ in spirit form he's
[1:40:17] in you right so that means the city of
[1:40:19] refuge is in you right now if the City
[1:40:22] of Refuge is in you but the doors are
[1:40:25] closed because you can't enter into
[1:40:27] someone's need how can people get
[1:40:29] deliverance how can people get healing
[1:40:31] how can people get salvation right if
[1:40:33] the if the gate shut but if the gates
[1:40:36] open and you can enter into their need
[1:40:38] then a people can get refuge just say
[1:40:40] about the woman at the well she
[1:40:41] would have been a great city of refuge
[1:40:43] from any who who were walking the same
[1:40:46] footsteps that she had already walked
[1:40:48] right that's like all of us that's why
[1:40:50] we all have a different testimony we can
[1:40:52] be a City of Refuge
[1:40:53] if you want to be amen
[1:40:58] I don't want people to run into this
[1:41:00] place or come in contact with me and
[1:41:02] open their hearts and be disappointed
[1:41:04] right I want them to find what they are
[1:41:09] seeking which is the Lord it's not a gun
[1:41:12] to say Amen so it's those so we want to
[1:41:19] we don't want to be emotionally detached
[1:41:21] in this age that's fine now emotional
[1:41:32] detachment is as is defined as this and
[1:41:35] and then we'll I'll close emotional
[1:41:38] detachment can be a positive behavior
[1:41:40] because it allows a person to react
[1:41:42] calmly to highly emotional circumstances
[1:41:45] right so you can be too emotionally
[1:41:47] taxing everything's just emotion emotion
[1:41:48] emotion but it can be a good thing
[1:41:50] because you can actually look at things
[1:41:51] analytically without emotion getting
[1:41:53] involved so on one hand it's a good
[1:41:55] thing but emotional detachment and this
[1:41:57] sense is a decision to avoid too
[1:42:01] emotional detachment in this sense is a
[1:42:05] decision to avoid engaging emotional
[1:42:08] connections rather than an ability or
[1:42:11] difficulty in doing so this when you
[1:42:13] look at something without bringing
[1:42:14] emotions involved right but so so so
[1:42:20] typically for personal social or other
[1:42:22] reasons in this case since it can allow
[1:42:25] people to maintain boundaries mental
[1:42:29] integrity and avoid undesired impacts
[1:42:31] buyer upon others related to emotional
[1:42:34] demands such as deliberate mental
[1:42:37] attitude which avoids engaging the
[1:42:38] emotions of others but emotional
[1:42:41] detachment can also be emotional numbing
[1:42:44] or emotional blunting a dissociation
[1:42:49] depersonalization or in its chronic form
[1:42:52] a depersonalization disorder this type
[1:42:57] of emotional numbing or blending is a
[1:42:58] disconnection from emotion that is
[1:43:01] frequently used as a coping survival
[1:43:04] skill during traumatic
[1:43:06] childhood events such as abuse or severe
[1:43:10] neglect over time and with much use this
[1:43:15] can become second nature when dealing
[1:43:17] with day-to-day stresses now we have all
[1:43:23] been neglected to a degree in our
[1:43:26] childhood
[1:43:27] remember our childhoods weren't perfect
[1:43:30] you could even you have believing
[1:43:32] parents there's still something that
[1:43:34] wasn't quite perfect with its childhood
[1:43:35] amen and now I'm a parent I can say we
[1:43:39] do try our best right we really do and
[1:43:43] we can think we're doing everything well
[1:43:45] but in reality we're probably not
[1:43:46] because we're trying our best right and
[1:43:49] that's why it takes the lot to come and
[1:43:50] really be the parent through you that's
[1:43:52] the only way you can do it but the thing
[1:43:54] is now if someone if someone so to be
[1:43:57] neglected as a child that doesn't mean
[1:44:00] you just seen out on the street you
[1:44:01] gotta fend for yourself but you can be
[1:44:03] neglected emotionally that your parents
[1:44:06] do not emotionally connect with you you
[1:44:09] follow yep because that's why it's so
[1:44:12] important to have an emotional bond with
[1:44:14] your children I mean because their
[1:44:16] emotional needs are met by the parents
[1:44:18] until they get married in their
[1:44:20] emotional needs are met by this spouse
[1:44:22] amen so now so so it can be if there is
[1:44:26] severe emotional neglect then a person
[1:44:29] then a child will become emotionally
[1:44:32] detached because they don't know how to
[1:44:34] use their feelings in in relationship
[1:44:38] it's only a working relationship if
[1:44:41] there's no feelings right we don't want
[1:44:44] a working relationship with our family
[1:44:47] or with each other
[1:44:48] there should be an emotional attachment
[1:44:51] right we're all brothers and sisters in
[1:44:53] Christ right we all lit loved each other
[1:44:55] in the Lord right so this should be an
[1:44:57] emotional attachment between us and of
[1:45:01] course there should be an emotional
[1:45:03] attachment between husband and wife
[1:45:04] between parents and children it has to
[1:45:08] be that way but then the thing is then
[1:45:10] if we have been and we've all been you
[1:45:13] know our all of our upbringings have not
[1:45:16] been perfect then we will all to aid
[1:45:20] greevey emotionally detached some of us
[1:45:23] maybe or not some of us may be extremely
[1:45:25] are because of what has happened in our
[1:45:27] lives but we don't and it's a coping
[1:45:30] survival skill which which becomes
[1:45:33] embedded in us so people keep up a wall
[1:45:36] they're emotionally detached why is that
[1:45:38] it's a survival mode that they have
[1:45:40] become used to operating it and maybe
[1:45:42] they don't even realize it but we're not
[1:45:46] called to be that way right emotional
[1:45:49] detachment may allow acts of extreme
[1:45:52] cruelty such as torture and abuse
[1:45:54] support supported by the by the decision
[1:45:58] to not connect infant emphatically with
[1:46:02] the person concerned social ostracism
[1:46:06] such as shunning and parental alienation
[1:46:10] other examples where decisions to shut
[1:46:14] out a person creates a psychological
[1:46:16] trauma for the shunned party amen and
[1:46:22] that's why you know that's a thing in
[1:46:25] our Western world children and parents
[1:46:29] the family unit has been broken and the
[1:46:33] parents are doing their own thing
[1:46:34] brother Brown spoke about it even in the
[1:46:36] 50s and 60s Jimmy's out with his hot rod
[1:46:38] Mama's doing this daddy's doing this and
[1:46:40] the family's all broken so it's a bunch
[1:46:42] of individuals in a house it's not a
[1:46:44] family anymore and what does that create
[1:46:47] it creates parental alienation where the
[1:46:51] parent is alienated from their children
[1:46:53] yet they grew up in the same house yet
[1:46:54] they're in the same house amen and so
[1:46:57] what does that produce it produces in
[1:46:59] the child emotionally detached child you
[1:47:05] know we're not called to be a bunch of
[1:47:06] individuals in a house we're called to
[1:47:09] be a family
[1:47:10] I remember we bear one another's burdens
[1:47:12] we can open our you know our family
[1:47:15] should be in such a way where we should
[1:47:16] have total Liberty to open up all of our
[1:47:19] heart
[1:47:19] amen to our parents those children here
[1:47:22] or to our spouses those who America we
[1:47:24] should there should be total Liberty in
[1:47:26] our relationships to share whatever's on
[1:47:28] our heart right to really enter into one
[1:47:31] another's burden you know I say to the
[1:47:33] girl sometimes
[1:47:34] on the same tape you know when is a
[1:47:37] disagreement I think we're all on the
[1:47:38] same team
[1:47:39] yeah we're not fighting against each
[1:47:40] other all on the same team you know and
[1:47:43] we're all on the same team I mean it's
[1:47:45] not team dad and team mom and who's
[1:47:47] gonna vote you know we're all on the
[1:47:49] same team amen so this can happen now so
[1:47:54] but emotional detachment because what
[1:47:56] happens is how we are how we are raised
[1:47:59] and especially how al our dad relates to
[1:48:03] us as a child then subconsciously we
[1:48:06] will relate to God in the same way we
[1:48:09] will relate to God this way so if our
[1:48:10] father is overbearing and very de
[1:48:12] monitored and very you know very strict
[1:48:15] in that way we think God is a God of
[1:48:17] rules and very strict and we don't see
[1:48:19] his grace and his love we only see your
[1:48:22] a lineup or your shape up or ship out we
[1:48:25] only see that because that's how our
[1:48:26] Father was but then if our father is
[1:48:28] real you know wide and loose and she'll
[1:48:30] be writing whatever and distant and not
[1:48:32] there we think God's there way we think
[1:48:34] God doesn't care because it's become
[1:48:37] imprinted upon us how are we doing
[1:48:40] everyone yeah this is true whether we
[1:48:43] like it or not this is how we were late
[1:48:45] to God and it takes God to come and
[1:48:47] reveal himself
[1:48:48] there's nothing brother and you haven't
[1:48:49] listened to it but brother and on
[1:48:50] Wednesdays if we should pray that God's
[1:48:52] will is done yeah so we should pray that
[1:48:56] because prayer brother M says as it
[1:48:58] shouldn't be us it should be us asking
[1:49:01] God to change our will to match his will
[1:49:03] right so when the Lord reveals himself
[1:49:06] to us we can't look through a pre
[1:49:08] understood filter we say God hears your
[1:49:11] word reveal yourself to me through your
[1:49:13] word reveal yourself to me through the
[1:49:14] message I mean that I could actually
[1:49:16] have a relationship with you amen
[1:49:20] that's how these to be we say Lord yeah
[1:49:22] because we all have a preconceived idea
[1:49:23] of God before he reveals himself we'll
[1:49:26] have a idea
[1:49:28] we don't want I don't want to worship
[1:49:30] God based on my idea that's called an
[1:49:32] idol that's an idle people Cavs idols of
[1:49:36] Jesus there's many today but I don't
[1:49:38] want to worship God by an idol of an
[1:49:40] hour you know an idea I want to worship
[1:49:42] Him according to all of his work
[1:49:44] amen hallelujah
[1:49:48] so now so we can be emotionally detached
[1:49:52] from God and what happens is that we do
[1:49:56] things we we worship God because we know
[1:49:58] it is right only brother am says I
[1:50:03] believe in a heartfelt sky-blue sink
[1:50:05] killing religion
[1:50:06] hallelujah amen and and I say Amy I
[1:50:10] believe in a heartfelt sky-blue sink
[1:50:13] killing religion a many you know you
[1:50:15] know brother Brandon tells the story you
[1:50:17] know of you know I think you know
[1:50:20] there's a slave or saying in a slave
[1:50:21] owner and the slave meets the Lord and
[1:50:24] he said or to his boss where he says
[1:50:25] I've got half our religion you know and
[1:50:28] the bosses I don't believe in such a
[1:50:29] thing he said well I do
[1:50:30] you just haven't experienced it yet a
[1:50:32] man I believe in a heartfelt religion
[1:50:35] you see brother Branham and deep called
[1:50:37] the deep in front of thousands of people
[1:50:38] he just talks the Lord he finishes
[1:50:40] praying he wiped his eye says here oh
[1:50:42] sorry I just start crying like a baby
[1:50:44] when I talked to him he wasn't a shame
[1:50:47] and he was a man's man - hallelujah
[1:50:49] hey he wasn't a week but you know but he
[1:50:55] believed in a heartfelt religion and so
[1:50:58] we can't be emotionally detached from
[1:51:02] God because if we are emotionally
[1:51:04] detached to our family to our spouse we
[1:51:06] will be to him whether we like it or not
[1:51:09] and we'll only worship God because we
[1:51:11] know it's right as opposed to actually
[1:51:14] loving him believing him from our hearts
[1:51:17] we don't want to be like they're doing
[1:51:19] that's why the spirit of Lord is here to
[1:51:21] sit at liberty them that are bruised
[1:51:23] I mean to recover the side of the blind
[1:51:26] they meant to heal them you know I mean
[1:51:29] that's why it's here
[1:51:30] so I'm gonna I'm gonna leave it with
[1:51:33] that but I'm gonna invite you
[1:51:36] ask you a question don't let this world
[1:51:39] numb you and this is now now brother
[1:51:42] Isaac city preacher experience this was
[1:51:44] my experience this last year I became
[1:51:46] emotionally detached and it became a
[1:51:49] coping mechanism of how I lived because
[1:51:52] it's like because you because you
[1:51:53] retreat you know you get hurt
[1:51:55] misunderstands you just retreat
[1:51:57] and you say well and then you start
[1:51:59] coping and all could look maybe fine on
[1:52:02] the outside everything can be peachy
[1:52:04] appear to be but you've built a fortress
[1:52:06] and you built a bunker and there you are
[1:52:08] and you're and you're on the defense God
[1:52:12] can use someone on added in a bunker
[1:52:14] we're not called to build a bunker
[1:52:16] I don't it was a live underground we're
[1:52:19] not moles right there's a cynic
[1:52:22] hallelujah maybe it would but but that's
[1:52:25] what happens because pain comes in or
[1:52:27] misunderstanding comes in and we don't
[1:52:30] know how to deal with it many times so
[1:52:32] we just sit with it and then we build
[1:52:35] and and now we want to cope well how do
[1:52:37] we cope we we withdraw we're not call to
[1:52:40] withdraw this rivers of living water
[1:52:43] should flow amen went on a bunker right
[1:52:46] so so that's how I was so I'm sorry I've
[1:52:49] I've experienced what I'm talking about
[1:52:50] maybe no to a massive degree but this is
[1:52:52] this was still me but there comes a
[1:52:55] point where you say lord I don't want to
[1:52:57] be like this anymore because you start
[1:52:59] walking down a path we get but begin to
[1:53:02] get ideas well I can move here and I'll
[1:53:06] just make this Little Kingdom this
[1:53:08] little because you think of this little
[1:53:09] paradise and normally if you're kind
[1:53:11] what you think well how can you be alone
[1:53:13] with your family somewhere place
[1:53:14] somewhere you've always wanted to live
[1:53:16] because you just because you're planning
[1:53:18] in your mind a a world that you can
[1:53:21] actually have control of that nothing
[1:53:23] can hurt you in that world amen but
[1:53:26] that's why when the children of Israel
[1:53:28] came out of Egypt they crossed the Red
[1:53:31] Sea they walked for three days they
[1:53:33] found water it was bitter they came to a
[1:53:35] bit of a bitter experience and then
[1:53:38] Moses God told Moses to cut down a
[1:53:41] certain tree and put it in the water and
[1:53:44] the water became sweet so the experience
[1:53:47] became sweet and brother ham says is a
[1:53:50] cross that's been cut down there's a
[1:53:52] cross and if you mix any experiences
[1:53:55] with the cross I mean it will go from a
[1:53:57] bitter experience to a sweet one
[1:54:00] that's the secret when we really give it
[1:54:02] to him and let him do it because there
[1:54:05] is a power in this room I'm fully
[1:54:07] convinced there is the power of the
[1:54:10] crosses present that any bitter
[1:54:12] experience does not have to stay that
[1:54:15] way you have to mix your experience with
[1:54:18] the cross you have to take it to him and
[1:54:21] say Lord make it sweet and I will
[1:54:25] guarantee you the waters are sweet again

[1:54:39] come forward we don't have to be
[1:54:42] detached from this world or from each
[1:54:44] other or from our families we're not
[1:54:48] called to be isolated in our life you
[1:54:52] could be the most extroverted person
[1:54:54] that has ever been but you can be alone
[1:54:56] you can because it can just be a front
[1:54:59] we're not called to be like that you can
[1:55:01] be the most bubbly you be the life of
[1:55:03] the party but you can be withdrawn and
[1:55:04] emotionally detached you don't have to
[1:55:07] be that way if you don't want to you
[1:55:10] could be free if you so desire amens
[1:55:14] let's bow our heads in a word of Prayer
