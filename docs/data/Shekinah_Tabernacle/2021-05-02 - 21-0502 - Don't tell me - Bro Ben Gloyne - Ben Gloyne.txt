god god bless you everyone everyone here in person and everyone in the stream i trust we all brought our lick of fire ready to lift the lord up in this sanctuary amen and just before we start um i'd ask if we can just stand and just read a song amen a familiar psalm psalms 23 and i believe this is god's perfect will for us i mean let's put ourselves into the scripture [Music] it says the lord is my shepherd i shall not want he maketh me to lie down in green pastures and he leadeth me beside the still waters and he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the path of righteousness for his name's sake and yet though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art with me my rod and my staff may comfort me and that prepares a table before me in the presence of mind enemies thou anointed my head with oil and my cup run it over so whatever you might be going through this morning you could be in the fire this morning but have no fear because the lord is right there with you it says surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and i will dwell in the house of the lord forever and ever amen this is what god has spoken for us this morning so it doesn't matter what the devil is trying to tell you or what he has for you and that's now irrelevant because jehovah god has the final say and this is what he said amen and before we pray let's sing a song blessed be the lord god almighty gives you and this morning as we sing our songs of praise and worship let's enter into the spirit and let's set aside everything everything else we have going on today and however you you want to express your love to god feel free to do it if you feel like lifting your voice go right go right on the head if you want to praise god in the dance and

you like to come forward amen bless you we'll try and keep this brief because i can carry on a little bit so cut it right down but there's lots of details um i've been staying for a week with naomi and she lives near newlands and newlands is where i gave my heart to the lord when i was 9 years old and way back then the hills that are now covered in houses were covered in gorse and bush and when i was a child the children in the street and i used to run over those hills and there's a trig station at the top behind new newlands where you can look out across the harbour it's amazing view if you want to look there anyway so it's a very high point and it meant a lot to me because that's where we used to go and play as children so i just would naomi was at work i just drove up there and um i we got out of the car and and now there's just a tiny track from the road to the top of the trig like about three minutes walk so it was a beautiful day and i got out and i came to the park where the track starts and there's like a black bar that goes across the track like this to stop cars driving up and there's a little space where you can walk just before i got to the black bar i looked down there was a beautiful red admiral butterfly and it was just before the black bar and it was open just in front of me its wings were open it was sunning itself in the sun but as i walked up to it my shadow overshadowed it and it flew over that bar and into the sun again in front of the bar and i stopped and i had a look at it and its wings one of its wings was kind of um disfigured a little bit from flying into bushes or whatever it might have done and i thought oh but it was just like lord thank you for letting me see that and then i didn't think a lot more and i carried on walking up the track the track got narrower and narrower and literally it was like this narrow and quite steep and i had to kind of go carefully and i slipped a few times going actually up to the trig when i got to the top of the trunk station it was absolutely lovely you could see up buttoni the the hill going up to wainwa mate you could see into wellington all the harbour and it just was very nostalgic because it was my childhood days i sat down there on the rock and a butterfly came and landed in front of me about a meter away right in front of where i was sitting and this butterfly was perfect it had no dishevelment on the wings or anything and it was open right in front of me like that sunning itself and i thought oh lord there another one that's so beautiful thank you for letting me see that next minute another butterfly came from somewhere i don't know whether it was the first one or another one of the same butterflies we'd be admiral redhead more and they joined together and they did a dance going up into the blue sky together under the beautiful blue sky and once again i thought oh lord that's so beautiful thank you for letting me see that then after i'd been sitting there for a while they disappeared and another butterfly or whether it was the same one i don't know came along about a metre in front of me again this time it had its wings closed like this and it was facing south like facing wellington city way and once again it was clean and perfect and just beautiful it wasn't until a couple of days later i think i was in church on wednesday night or something was like suddenly i could see my life in that whole walk that whole journey it was like before the black bar i was disheveled and everything and the black overshadowed me which was where i was in newlands which was behind me and then i gave my heart to the lord and i leapt over that bar but i was still i was um a worldly christian you could say back then and it the journey of life got the track got narrower and narrower and i stumbled and i don't know what part i'm up to on that journey now but it was like when i got to the top that butterfly was perfect perfection and when you sing that song walk seven steps to perfection i thought that fits in my testimony maybe lord you want to share and share that with the saints that might encourage you and then it was like the bridegroom came and up into glory together into that blue sky i have no idea what the meaning of the butterfly coming back down and facing south as maybe the lord will reveal that i don't know but i just wanted to share it because who knows it might help you somewhere in your life to see the little tiny things that the lord can speak to us through praise god amen hallelujah we thank god for that testimony you know when we're in the spirit the lord shows us things you know in nature in way and we appreciate that god bless you my sister god bless you for your walk amen amen shall we stand and sing some worship songs hallelujah let's sing i must tell jesus keep see amen hallelujah let's sing this song prayerfully if you have a prayer in your heart amen just bring it to the surface and just lift it up to him as we sing the song amen i must tell jesus [Music] love my trials i cannot bear these burdens of lord in my distress he kindly will help me he ever loved and cares for his all i must tell jesus i must tell

[Music] rich grace [Music] [Music] is as thou hast died for me my love [Music] and changeless amen praise the lord thank you musicians i mean thank you for the pd god bless you all this morning um we're going to go straight to the scripture just a couple of announcements one um brother already is invited all the youth up to taranaki have a queen's birthday so if you're wanting to go please let us know so we can give them numbers and also everyone hopefully should have received their donation receipt if you haven't please come see us and we'll make sure you get it amen we're just going to go to luke 16 this morning i really appreciate your undivided attention today luke 16 and we're going to read from verse 13 and then we're going to go to romans chapter 9. luke 16 and 13. it says no servant can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he'll hold to the one and despise the other you cannot serve god and mammon and the pharisees also who were covetous heard all these things and they derided him and he saith unto them ye are they which justify yourselves before men but god knoweth your hearts for that which is highly esteemed among men is abominable as abomination sorry in the sight of god let's go to romans chapter nine i'm going to read the last i believe three three verses here if i have it right in my my notes can you turn me down and it feels like i'm booming in a cave somewhere uh romans nine and thirty what shall we say then that the gentiles which followed not after righteousness have attained to righteousness even the righteousness which is of faith but israel which followed after the law of righteousness hath not attained to the law of righteousness wherefore because they sought it not by faith but as it were by the works of the law for they stumbled at that stumbling stone it is written behold i lay in zion a stumbling stone a rock of offense and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed amen let's bow our heads into word of prayer this morning lord jesus we come before you this morning with thanksgiving in our hearts also a real godly fear lord i just want to pray dear god that may we be attentive to your spirit lord may you lord just help us not to be distracted by anything i pray that you'll touch our lives this morning lord we don't take for granted that we can gather under your lord and your presence lord so i pray dear god may you just anoint speaker and hear her one more time lord i also pray that all those watching today lord if they're sick and body lord we think of by the honest lord sister barbaro god may touch their lives touch their bodies and heal them father for your glory and lord anyone else lord i pray you'd be with them and dear god i pray you'll take the service under your control not our will not my will but thy will be done amen may you grant it father in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you you may have your seats this morning pray god help me just now i'd like to speak about a subject and my title is don't tell me now this may seem very odd but we read there in luke chapter 16 where you know what a scene that was to me this shakes me to the core here was the very fountain of life eternal life was standing in flesh and he was addressing a people that should have received him he was talking to a people that were looking for him to come but when he came they rejected him they turned him down and they didn't just turn them down they crucified him they called him beelzebub they the very one who even gave them life in their bodies not just eternal life but physical life gave them breath gave them life gave them a choice was standing right in front of them you think about how powerful it was you know before the lord became flesh you know it was all right for them to have schools of thought of what god was like in his attitude and his heart and what he thought and you know movements and religions and then bible schools but really when he became flesh all that should have been done away with it should have been closed up shop they should have thrown away the books thrown away their teachings and you know because the very god that gave the word was standing there he was talking to them and his heart is always come unto me heather heavy laden and i'll give you rest take my yoke upon you and lea and lord of me for i am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest for your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light that was his cry that's his cry now his cry hasn't changed come unto me don't forsake your religion and your nonsense and your humanity and what you think come unto me and i'll give you rest there he was what a scene you have you ever put yourself in that kindness imagine standing there here's the fountain of eternal life not just a prophet not just a religious man not just a rabbi to call them those things as the most discredit ever you put upon him was god and flesh and every school of thought opinion well i think god's like this and i think he's like this and he likes this and this and this that should have been done away with and it was it should be the same thing exactly in this day where god has revealed himself again and all schools of thought debate theology should have been thrown out to one side because god himself revealed who he is today but you see this word it says they derided him that word deride means to turn up the nose to snare it to scoff at so basically they said you can't tell me you don't try and tell us what we should believe you see the problem is people build a belief system and they worship that belief system and they think that's god and they think that's going to take them to heaven and they think it's going to give them eternal life and it didn't give them eternal life they rejected the giver of eternal life and they went to hell that was see people think by coming to a church you'll go to heaven they worship god through a church you don't worship god through a church you worship god through the word you don't worship him through what we think the word is you worship what he has revealed [Applause] and so that's what people think sincere people now when i talk about religious systems i'm not against any person and don't put this beyond the four walls of the message either don't pitch this we're not a bunch of farmers loading hey have you pitch walk to people you miss the whole point and so people build a religious idea and they basically describe some pharisees they had their religious idea they basically said no what we believe is god and you're not and they rejected him what you hold on to will take you either two places depending what it is it will take you to heaven or it will take you to hell what do you hold on to i trust i have everyone's attention right now and i pray you just let's just i don't want to stand here today but this is where we are read there and luke if i can just go back there no servant can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold on to the one and despise the other you cannot serve god and mammon so we're going to hold on to something and you can only hold on to one thing you can't have feet in both camps you can't have your idea and god's word you can't have both of them you can only have one and the thing you identify with the most is what you hold on to brother branham when hit when when he saw the vision of the seven angels came coming to him he was there and he says and serves us the time of the insert because i want to show you history's repeated itself this is not 2 000 years ago this is right now in 2021. then i said lord jesus if it did not mean it mean that and it means that you'll go you've got something for me to do it'll be revealed to me later then send your power because he thought maybe that was the end of his life that blast he thought no man can survive that he says but but if it's for something something for me to do later send your power just now it says and it almost took me from the room i found myself somewhere over in a corner i could hear my wife somewhere trying to shake a door the door in the bedroom was locked and i had a bible open and it was reading i don't know what it was in i believe romans the ninth chapter the last verse behold i land zion a cornerstone a stumbling stone a precious cornerstone and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed now if you go into your bible which i trust you had it open and you read it now i have a scofield bible just out of because i've got used to where everything is but you open that there how does it go to just one verse it all looks the same god directed him to that verse so god's god's declaring that there has been 2 000 years of theology man's opinion just like before jesus came the first time but then now there's going to be a stone and it's him who whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed so it's a person it's not a doctrine it's not just a school of thought it's a person himself the word says now he's going to be revealed so and i went over to the window and was about 10 o'clock in the day your bed and i raised up my hands i said lord god i don't understand this is a strange day to me and i'm beside myself almost i said lord what does that mean let me read it again if it be you now this sounds juvenile i took up the bible opened it up and there it was again at the same place paul telling the jews that they tried to tell the romans that the jews tried to accept it by works but it was by faith that we believe it so they but if you think about it they did they had a faith they said we believe moses we believe our prophets but their faith but they tried to they they they built a whole religion around doing man-made things now i'll say this the liberal and the legal all in the same boat because they try and justify their own selves in their own state by what they do the liberals say well i'm saved by grace i can do what i want no grace is a divine influence upon the hardness reflection in the life if you really found grace there'll be a reflection of it in your life the fruits of the spirit the life of god the word of god will be manifested through you that's how you know you found grace right and it's not by our own humanity that we keep the word of god people have tried it for centuries and has abusively failed so they tried to find faith or they tried to become righteous but why by what they did and by doing what they did they rejected the one who wanted to give them eternal life i hope this is kind of making a bit of sense so they rejected the word the word was there to give them eternal life but they they they derided him they put up their nose at him they rejected him saying my system is god you're not you say well this was 2 000 years ago this is denomination this is not denomination but this is message where people will take quotes and they'll put them together and put them together and they think then they have god and they just have a form of religion they have no power they have no reality they have no life but they've got an argument the pharisees had a good argument but that's all they had they didn't have the life of god so when with the opening of the seals it was the lord himself coming into the church and to some he's a stumbling stone because they stumble because they justify themselves saying but i'm a good christian and they stumble the pharisees thought they were good too they were esteemed highly in front of other men oh look at them look at how they keep the law and they do all these things oh they're so devout people and wow look at how they dress all the tithing they give and all the outward things they do and and jesus said you're a bunch of sepulchers dead man bones that's all you were but outwardly they were highly esteemed by men but jesus says was highly esteemed by men god calls it abomination it's a filthy stinking thing he detests though it may look very good on the outside it's an abomination because people's motives look at me i'm the best believer there is and they crush others around them that's what the scribes and pharisees did now it says in psalms 106 and they serve their idols which were a snare unto them they s yea they sacrificed their sons and daughters unto devils they shed innocent blood even the blood of their sons and of their daughters whom they sacrificed unto the idols of canaan and the land was polluted with blood thus they were defiled with their own works and they went a whoring with their own inventions so they invented a belief system and it caused innocent people to die they built their an invention is something because you need to invent something to to to improve your life but they invented a a religion to appease their own guilty conscience so now they had this way of worshiping god whatever it was you know they thought well this is but they would defile with their own works how are we today what we hold on to will take us one or two places they went to whoring after their own inventions it was to appease their own conscience they shed innocent blood and you can kill someone's character and that's murder the prophet tells us it's not stabbing someone in the back with a knife but by killing someone's character as a murder that's shedding innocent blood you must be very careful how we talk about one another be very careful how we talk about people even in the world how do you know there's not a predestinated seed and you're throwing them into the dirt and throwing it or a brother or sister at least people are trying but you throw them in the dirt that's murder that's killing someone we're not here to kill each other we're here to kill the devil cast him out of this place that we don't hold on to him and his filth but we hold on to the word of god [Music] but the problem is it comes very close you see the rich young ruler he lacked one thing he was a very good message believer he knew conduct daughter doctrine and knew all the quotes he knew how to dress he knew how to act he knew how all those things went together but he lacked one thing jesus says one thing you lack and he had a choice and he decided to hold on to that thing that lacked because he wasn't willing to sell all he had give to the poor take up his cross and follow the lord he wanted to keep his identity that everyone thought he was a good rich young ruler and we all know where he ended up it's not i'm just proverbs 21 and 2. this is from the amplified bible every man's way is right in his own eyes but the lord weighs and examines the hearts of the people and their motives so everyone is right in their own eyes i think i'm right today i'll be honest well the scripture says that i think i'm right if i was wrong i'd do something else but it's the lord that examines the heart the lord looks beyond the veneer he looks down into the soul and he said it's either full of light or full of darkness there's only two things you know this message is not something we just grow into you don't just fit into a mold and you become a believer you're birthed by the seed of god the word and crypto you really do meet them brother brahm says after the seals open everyone must have an experience of the baptism of the holy ghost and it's an essential thing that we must receive the prophet tells us he says in enticing spirits see people hold on to their religion instead of holding on to the word and it can be a message quote religion the world is full of it in some places i'm not looking at anyone particularly when i say that but we're not meant to hold on to quotes and that's going to take us in a rapture you meet the one who sent the quotes which is the lord jesus christ himself they rejected the lord basically they said we don't tell us how to live don't tell me what to believe my religion is god and not you that's what the scribes and pharisees are basically saying he was the word that healed the sick raise the dead cast out devil set the captives free but they held on to their own religious systems instead of forsaking them and letting and then letting him hold them brothers has an enticing spirit now today so many people are listening he says now this is sunday school i love it look so many people are listening to enticing spirits instead of taking the word of god spirits they're in the world they're demons they go out into places and get amongst men and ministers they get amongst church members they get amongst good people they cause them to come into a illusion and they say things and do things and teach things and practice things that's contrary to the word of god today ministers of their congregation allowing their people to play cards in the churches many of them that's not all together catholic that's a lot of protestant does that what their what they tried to do is substitutionary something they tried to adopt some new plan they tried to adopt education to take place of the holy ghost you'll never be able to do it no matter how well your man is educated i think it's a good thing for me to be educated but if he hasn't got the holy ghost with that his education will do no good education will never take place to the leadership of the holy spirit amen so it says it causes them to go into an illusion what kind of illusion well i belong to church i'm a good person i pay my tithes i'm a loyal member i've been here for years you know i've you know i've i've given myself to this you know and and then also we can just bring into the ranks of the message which is really what i'm talking to today they say well i'm okay because i believe the message people justify well we believe the whole mess is therefore we've got the holy ghost therefore we're going into rapture brother braham says in the token don't come just this far say i believe the message you obey the messenger come into christ you say well i believe every word brother branham that's good but that's just being able to read take the message shake it into your heart they must have the token the very life that was in christ be in you when i see that i'll pass over you so it's all people say well i believe the whole message therefore i'm a believer no that's just being able to read the prophecies but they come under an illusion by seeing a mental agreement with the word they think they've got it but they're holding on to a religion that's been formed instead of meeting the god that brought thy broad eternal life that is eternal life himself and becoming one with him is this all right do we all understand where i'm coming the apostle paul asked the question have you received the holy ghost since you believed that's a very good question we should ask ourselves and don't throw it off by well what experience is big enough what's happened in your life has changed you amen people justify not fully surrendering to god because they feel the results they see in their lives validates them and then god overlooks their iniquity which is not a living according to the word they think but i do this therefore god will overlook this part of my life that's not how it works there is no easy step there's no side step into something well look i do this i'm a christian i read this i post these things on instagram i do this no no we got to line up with the word and i'm not just talking about dress code i'm talking about our attitude towards others if we've got to attempt to find a buzzer and just want to kill everyone across our path there's something wrong with us that's a demon power that's motivating someone's life we should have love for one another brother abraham says and humble thyself this is after the seals opened if if that matters to anyone now surely after all these years on the field and around the world and seeing different people i ought to know a little bit about the gate to internet and if you want to get somewhere with god who wants to get somewhere with god never let an arrogant spirit ever come around you don't let no malice come in no matter what anybody does if they are wrong don't you ever build a complex against that person we're not here to build complexes we're not here to build walls one ahead of build up defenses and forget it i want to get somewhere with god what's an arrogant spirit well i'm better than that person well at least i'm not like that person becomes an arrogance of pride look at what i am i don't care what i am who's he he's the important one amen you be sweet and kind remember god loves you when you're in sin and if the spirit of god is in you you love the other person when he is in wrong see just pray for them and love one another amen hallelujah that's how we should be we're all human by the way hallelujah amen so the stumbling stone has come again in this end time people stumble when the word is manifested it's very easy just to talk about the message talk about church but when god comes down and manifests that word people stumble at it people stumble at divine love people believe and stumble at it so-called believers they stumble at it because they say how can this be and this is not right now that's just pentecostal whatever they try and shove it off on something else just like the pharisees did they weren't willing they were holding on to what they crafted of the word we're not here to build idols people take certain scriptures and doctrines and if something steps on their toes they puff up and they just basically have a heart attack nearly you know what happens among believers is many times things become allowed in lives and then that thing that's allowed they run rampant with it you can take and you know for example and this is not against your own who's a hunter but people become hunters and fishermen just because the prophet was if you do those things i'm not speaking against him but you know people run rampant with it and it becomes their little thing they do and that's all they they forsake all and they do those things and if you speak against it say don't don't touch my little thing or christian movies or anything in the world any little pet thing hello everyone you're understanding what i'm saying and you know you know it's like they have this little this little treasure because they're allowed it i'm allowed this and instead of letting the lord uh what do you call it moderate it we should be so sensitive to god if we get into something too much god should say that's too much you need to you need to actually forsake that thing what about your family what about yourself what about me that's how we should be shouldn't it you know if we because we're people we get enthused about things and god made us a certain way we're not robots but if we get caught up in saying too much we should be sensitive to the lord to say and lord you say hold on you really need to cut back on that but some people don't have that relationship and they get this one little thing and it just becomes their whole life but yet they come to church they listen to the message of somehow they pay their tithes whatever but they have their little thing and if you stand on that thing won't be unto you for speaking against my little thing that's holding on to the wrong thing jesus says in matthew 21 jesus saith unto them did you not never read in the scriptures the stone which the builders rejected the same as become the head of the corner this is the lord's doing it is marvelous in our eyes therefore i say unto you the kingdom of god shall be taken from you and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof so jesus saying basically because you can't accept me who is the word the kingdom of god is being taken from you given to another who'll bring forth the fruits thereof and whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken that that stone is the word of god but on whomsoever it shall fall it will grind him to powder i don't want to become powder i'd rather fall on the wood and be broken take my life lord mold it shape it anything any any country think of me just lord take it from me i don't want it lord and when the chief priests and pharisees had heard his parable they perceived that he spake of them but when they sought to lay hands on him they fed the multitude because they took him for a prophet we can't justify ourselves in what we do at all our christian walk should not be our own justification of ourselves but i'm a good person that doesn't matter we can't think well god will overlook this little thing in my life that i hold on to and i'll get to heaven he says he speaks a parable in luke 18 and he says and he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous and despised others then he went to the parable of the two in the temple once the public and the other ones the whoever and he thinks he's so awesome he's praising god he's not like the publican and the republicans can't even look up he just looks down says lord forgive me be merciful upon me a sinner and that man we're not justified but the other one didn't go out justified so we can't trust in our own ability amen remember when it comes to salvation we're not in partnership with god it's him it's his work our walk is not us and him either it's him amen it's not us living brother brahm says if beethoven was in me i do the works of bite home and he says i and beethoven can't live in the same house one of us has to be dead for the other to live same thing with jesus christ if jesus christ is in me then the works of jesus christ i'll do because it's no longer me living but it's jesus christ the word living in me amen this isn't a this is an age of people being offended social media has has just allowed people to become a lot more offended and everyone's offended at something doesn't matter if it's the environment or whatever's going whatever's trending i'm not going to list anything but whatever people get offended and when jesus came the first time people were offended he even would save john the baptist blessed us he whosoever shall not be offended in me saying john don't be offended you ended up in prison and then he would speak about the parable of the sower and then there'll be a certain class of ground when they receive the word it falls into stony places the same as that that here at the word and anon with joy receives it yet hath not rooted himself but dureth for a while and then when tribulation or persecution arises because of the word by and by he's offended what does he get offended at the word the thing that's sown in his life he gets offended at and people get offended because it stands on your toes the word should stand on our toes shouldn't it hey it should actually be challenged it should be the the lord wants to challenge us how are you doing with me not in a bullying way but but we need to meet you this is such a such an affair you know people get offended don't tell me how to i need to change if god tells you you need to change i'd listen to him real good if god says you've got to lay aside something i'd say yes lord it's worth it missing heaven is not worth it for anything now i'm going to read the stream i want to i just want to weave this into this and i've been avoiding this for a very long time but here we are long time as and not just this morning so i'll read this first actually this is from a rejected king and when you die remember it doesn't change your spirit it only changes your dwelling place and whatever type of spirit you got in you that's the place it will go to and sin can never enter into heaven you say well i confess mine every night we got a prayer book and when we go to church we confess all our sins and turn right back around and do them again turn right back around the next day god forgive me for drinking forgive me for committing adultery forgive me for lying forgive me for stealing turn right back and do the same thing forgive me for getting drunk last week i don't mean to drink that much turn right back around and drink it again well that's not that shows that something hasn't changed inside you're trying to paint the outside kind of whitewash it but what it needs to be done is put it in the blood of jesus christ and wash white instead of white washed what is white wash just paint the outside washed white as the inside gets changed that's what the world needs today so now nine years ago about nine years ago when analysts was five months old christine had a series of five dreams over one night and i can read this because i'll say personally not because she's my wife but i can see when the lord has used her it's come to pass so it's trustworthy so i'm just going to read it but now remember remember what we're talking about what are you holding on to you can't tell me so the pharisees held on to something a religious spirit and it took them somewhere took them to hell so what we hold on to even though it may seem good will take us one or two places so when annelise was a baby about five months old i had a series of five different dreams over the course of a night because i was getting up to her quite a lot and if anyone remembers her back in those days she was if she slept an hour a day that was that was good each one was so clear so vivid and when i would put her back down and go back to sleep i would dream the next sequence of that each dream was so clear nothing was at all mixed up nothing was like a dream like a normal dream was very clear who's had spiritual dreams before they're very different to normal dreams i trust we all understand these things so the first ones the first one started and it was like an old movie to start with it's like a book was opened and how it started was like a story the book came open and then coming out of the pages came like a film and how it started was there's this christian family and there's this young girl who i think her name was betsy or something like that was in this family and it was during quite poor time so i think it was like in the great depression or something like that they're quite poor so but they're also very devout christian people and they had a cow that wasn't giving in any milk so she went and prayed for the cow and that cow started to give milk again and it gave so much milk until they fed their family and their neighbors in their little community and it was bursting so much they're able to swap things for the milk so that just showed she was from a very religious family that had a genuine faith a really lovely christian family i was just showing that to show it wasn't their their religion wasn't a cultural thing it was a genuine thing and that's and and that's how she grew up and then the next dream she was a lot older probably in her 50s and she had gotten married and she has this woman sort of like a 90s or 80s hairstyle uh yet you know so so she's quite a worldly kind of looking woman but yet she is a very pious everyone considered her to be a pious wonderful woman a great christian she was as lovely as you could be there was something she knew god but there was something in her life that god put his finger on and she didn't want to give that up and she didn't give it to him and she knew it and i got the assumption it was the message that she came across in the dream though i don't know for sure but i got that feeling she but she didn't go with that what the lord was showing her but no one else ever thought anything of it because no one else knew it but her everyone thought she was the most amazing christian woman and she was praised so much and in the church she was just as amazing person yet she had short hair wearing makeup she was that kind of christian now that so that's the first two dreams the third dream i'm going to admit because it relates to someone we know now in the fourth dream she was now an old lady in the hospital and remember christine used to be a minder in the hospital so minding elderly and people who need to be minded in the hospital so i was minding her or something like that and she was there and she was so scared because she said that the devil was coming to get her and she was in terror but from my side i knew nothing about her past i prayed for her and i asked the lord for mercy for her and then the room went peaceful and quiet and then after a little while suddenly she let out a scream and the devil came to get her and she died and then i woke up because annelise was crying so i just went and and and looked after analysts and i just cried to the lord said lord do my prayers not actually count do they not do anything because i pray for people in the hospital a lot i pray for people a lot do they not get saved as in there's no point praying for people then i remember asking the lord about this and i fell back into sleep and the lord said to me it does make a difference it does matter she was shown another opportunity for mercy she was shown that time in her life when she didn't accept the truth or the lord and chose her religion instead and she had the choice before her that's when the room went peaceful and quiet she had the choice so that prayer interceded for her and that devil actually was cast off her and then she had an opportunity now to accept mercy she's on death's door here she has an opportunity to accept mercy she had a choice before her to say that her own religion was a filthy rags she didn't have anything to denounce herself and take the lord and realize she was nobody but was all him but she would have to denounce all her piety all of her wonderful religion all her life and make it count as but dung that was nothing and then this voice said to me she wasn't able to do that and then it showed me her now listen to this this this look this listen and then it showed me her holding on to this demon spirit and it went suddenly dove down into hell going down down down into a pit and she was holding on and this voice said to me at any time she could have let go but that was that religious spirit she was holding onto she couldn't let it go she identified herself so strongly with it that even in death she couldn't leave it she held on and she didn't and and it and it didn't pull her down she held on to it and it took her down and i just woke up i cried so much i felt so shaken by this dream it still shakes me even now to think it was so real as they say at any moment she could have let go of her religion what what was that when and what is that when you die anyway but she couldn't let go of all her works in her life her religion her spirituality this woman had a choice but she held on to what she thought she was she esteemed her own religious works and what she believed above receipt letting go of it and actually holding on to the lord the dream said she see the spirit didn't take her there she held onto it right so she didn't get dragged down to hell she held onto that spirit and it took her down we don't want to end up in this condition you say well i believe the message you're not exempt we can form our own little message identity and i believe this doctrine and this doctrine and this doctrine i see that the apostle paul said if even though i know all mysteries and give my body to be burned and give all i am to the poor yet without charity i have nothing that tells me you can know all mysteries amen well i have a clear understanding you can know all mysteries you can give your whole life to help others well eternal life is living for others sometimes people just live for others but it's under their own motivation look at my religious self you can give your body to be burned you give your life you can give everything you can know all mysteries you can have faith to move mountains look at the results i get but yet not know him and yet at the end you'll be a failure and you'll go to hell by your own choice as opposed to letting go of that and holding on to the lord because even the prophet said i don't want to he said he said i don't want to try and get to heaven on my visions or on my preaching or any miracles he said i don't want to try and get i'd be foolish to try and get to heaven on those things all i want to get to heaven is the blood of the lord the blood of the lamb and what he has done for you and i that's all he wanted to get to heaven on that's all he wanted and it should be the same thing with you and i we have nothing to boast in to be offended it means to have displeasure it means to stumble it means to see in another what i disapprove of and what hinders me from acknowledging his authority you know you know what people do they let their problems and their complexes define them and they become their identity the ten spies that went into the land their identity came and and it was all the problems in the land that stopped them from actually crossing jordan all those things are there their giants their cities are too big there's this problem in my life and this problem is going on and this problem's here all they saw was problems and their whole life was was was their identity was wrapped up in those things but caleb and joshua weren't looking at those things they knew there was a resurrection over that river they knew there was an inheritance over that river so they weren't their identity wasn't the problems in the land and the problems in the church and the problems going on around they didn't care about those things they said and this word is a resurrection give me my mountain they didn't care about nothing else they didn't worry about problems and complex you know some complex is a god allowed brother branham had a complex against ungodly woman he had to be fashioned a certain way to be like elijah he loved real godly sisters that was god allowed if i can put it that way and we sit there and try and look at all the problems in our life and this and this and this just walk with god i'm not identified by this thing i'm not identified by my human spirit and my personality and whatever complexes i'm i have and problems and things and i'm not identified by those things i'm identified by this word i wish there could just be a curtain around me all the time and just change my voice so you can't even see me standing here i'm not identify i'm my identity is not preaching my identity is not my identity's in him but if we try and hold on to our own abilities in our own and our own religion that we're fashioned god says that's abomination in shalom 1964. it seems like that gross darkness is settled upon the people till they think the only thing there is to do is go to church and be a pretty good person put your name on the book and some little mysterious thing god will twist the key when you die and change that spirit in you to him you're mistaken when you're when you die that spirit that's on you that's the way you'll be forever remember the pharisees the sadducees and so forth was very religious people jesus says in matthew 7 i think i'll just close with this because he said here not everyone that said unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven that's the word of god many will say to me in that day lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and then i will proceed profess unto them i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity so i can stand here i can be a no i'm just gonna i'm just gonna talk about me i can stand here i can preach under inspiration mysteries can be opened up the word can come forth demon powers can be cast out supernatural healings take place many wonderful works could be done but if i don't know him depart from me he said and what is this pentecostal what is this religious world done in this day they major on their works either supernatural or natural that woman in that dream held onto her own religious ways and she thought god will overlook what i have turned down because of all i do and she was mistaken do you know what happens when there's the preaching of the word goes forth demons actually push back for you to receive the lord so there's actually a space of peace like her in her hospital bed where we can actually decide to hold on to a religious spirit or let go and cling to the lord and receive his holy ghost there's those things let's i don't i don't know what to say anymore can we hear the musicians please you do don't justify yourself by your christian walk and think god will overlook your your iniquities you refuse to forgive someone for what they've done to you god won't forgive you god is not a respecter of persons we don't have any special status because you're you you say well i believe the message i was raised in the message that don't count nothing you're just a very privileged individual that you don't have to be scarred by the world and then come into the truth but don't justify yourself by some message idol if i can put it that way forgive me if that sounds a bit tramping on something sacred some religious idol let's stand i want to sing rock of ages clear for me let me hide myself in thee [Music] amen let's all prayerfully sing the song rock sorry what rock of ages clear for me let me hide myself in thee let the water and the blood from thy wounded side which flowed thee of sin the double cure

[Music] when i saw [Music] me [Music] in that dream that woman held on to that spirit which is her identity that religious spirit and their dove down down down down into a pit if you hold on to your own religion that will happen if you hold on to him you got to know you have the holy ghost you got to know that you've just laid it all on the altar i can't tell you that but there should be a moment in your life where i met god it's not because i was raised in it not because people thought i've played the part we can all play the part but that life when the word becomes it's more than just well i understand doctrine but when is life comes in when that happens then you'll know you're not holding on to some religious spirit but he's you're holding on to him and when you leave this mortal coil which if the lord will tarry we shall we won't dive down but it'll go up i want to go up [Music] when i saw two worlds unknown see the online judgment throne rock of ages clear for me let me hide myself with me [Music] i know there's another verse but we're just gonna pray make your heart an altar this is a sobering time i've i i've been running from this sermon for a long time but here we are do you think it's it's not a happy thing to preach these things but make your heart an altar let's all pray together gracious lord almighty jesus oh lord jesus we don't want to be like the pharisees turn up our nose at you to ride you o god lord the very fountain of life lord you are standing there in front of them calling him to come unto you to let go of that religious demon power and come unto you and receive eternal life and lord your cry that cry is still going forth even now come unto me all ye that labor in the heavy laden i'll give you rest stop laboring in your own ability to be a believer come unto me i'll give you rest for your soul i'll give you a real rest hallelujah lord i pray for each man woman and child whoever hear my voice hear this lord i pray you to graft it on

be a cleft for us today lord that we wouldn't hold on to some so justify ourselves and well i'm okay when we're not okay oh lord i pray lord we'd let go of our identity lord the rich young ruler
