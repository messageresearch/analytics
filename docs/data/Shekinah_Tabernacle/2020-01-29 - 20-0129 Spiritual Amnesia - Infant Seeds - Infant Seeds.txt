want to hear your thoughts and father we just pray you'd be with us and we just commit the service to you in Jesus name Amen hallelujah Thank You musicians the Lord's been working with me since last year over this thought and rather being asked of our one of the preach and I like it when I can say yes I've got something you know sometimes he had asked to preach like a kind of hit of stop praying what what I'm gonna say that the Lord's been working and so I've got a lot of mail to deliver and you know every now and again you check your mail and you go down there and you see what something they're like oh you know sweet that's Kristin's car that's probably guess the outro in it like that now but sometimes you know there's bills or something you know - ministry of justice a ticket or something that's unpaid and it's like man I don't want to open that letter I'm just going to stick it back in the box but you've got to deal with it later as well or that can come back so I just want to deliver what I've got on my heart and I just pray that you'll see that it's not me as the law this it's trying to get this thought across so I got a lot of hay on the fork and I promise I'll be em I'll try I know it's Wednesday but I'll try and be shorter than Andy so we can turn a few got my slide show up peace First Samuel 15 verse 1 that's on the border if you want to read it there First Samuel 15 1 Samuel also said unto the unto Saul the Lord sent me to anoint me to be king over as people over Israel now therefore hearken now unto the voice of the words of the Lord thus saith the Lord of hosts I remember that which I'm elected to Israel now I'm gonna be taking a lot of spiritual from the natural and what I read tonight so a malika's the flesh right a malika's as something that we've got to deal with and he's saying I remember which I'm elected to Israel how he laid and wait for him and the way when he came up from Egypt now go and smite a Malik and utterly destroy all that they have and spare them not that both slay man and woman infant suckling ox and sheep and camel and s so the Lord add his blessings to the word and you can take your seats I've got quite a few scriptures to start so Ezra we're on their journey out of Egypt and heading to the promised land but aim a liquid Wade laid and wait while they were on this journey he had laid him wait just to try and get into the camp just to try and get some things into them and he's so cunning he just slips them but God doesn't forget God's going to deal with Emily their enemy must be slayed every part of our flesh man must be brought into subjection to this word and you can't speak anything we've got to be diligent search out everything nothing nothing can be left there we read from Ezekiel 9 verse 1 I've just been studying on this today and it's going to be hard not to go off on a tangent he cried also in mine ears with a loud voice saying cause then that have charged over the city to draw near even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand and behold six men came from the way of the high gate which life toward the north every man a slaughtering weapon in his hand and one man among them was clothed in white linen weather writers inkhorn by her side and they went and and stood beside the brazen altar so this now is typing into these these last vials that are going to be poured out at judgments that are going to be poured out at the end time and one of these these men have come up with these slaughtering weapons to slay and there's one here there's clothes of white linen with a writer's inkhorn it's a holy spirit and the glory of God if Ezra was gone up from the cherub whereupon he was to the threshold of the house and he called to the man clothed with linen which had the writers inkhorn by his side and the Lord said unto him go through the midst of the city go through the midst of the city through the midst of Jerusalem and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and cry for the abominations that are done and the nuts thereof and to the others he said in mine hearing go ye after him through the city and smite let not your eyes spare neither have you petty slay utterly old and young both maids and little children and woman but come not near any man upon whom as the NARC and begin at my sanctuary then they began at the ancient men which were before the house their seeds that get into our life and the same you know it's funny that these angels are going to come and pour up the last seven plagues on the earth and at the same time God is sending those same destroying angels to destroy the Amalekites that have got into our own lives because we can't take an Amalekite into the promised land so we've got to deal with them and I'm going to put it in the mouth of a third witness and Joshua 6:17 and the city shall be accursed even it and all that are there unto the Lord only Rahab the harlot shall live she and all that are with her in her house because she had the messengers that was seen I see seven Rahab's I see you know that except that the messengers into a house that's just don't want to tangents and yeah and anyways keep yourself from the accursed thing let list you make yourselves a curse when you take up the occurs things and make the camp of Israel a curse and trouble it see when you take of an accursed thing of the world it actually comes in and it changes an atmosphere with you and it and it actually hex an effect on the whole camp so that's why it's so important that we pull together as one body that's why it's so important we talk and we fellowship and and sometimes you don't even have to be direct if something that's coming it just comes out just why your fellowshipping joshua and has had an arm and it's army they had a promise that they were going to take this promised land right but they crossed over jordan and we've we've crossed over jordan and you're on your on your journey in your promised land but there were squatters in the land right there's a Malick's in your land that had got to be dealt with so the people shouted when the priests blew with trumpets I just I like all the shouting and popping a trumpet so just that seems to go hand in hand and it came to pass when the people heard with the sound of a trumpet and the people shouted with a great shout that the wall fell down flat so that the people went up into the city every man straight before him and they took the city and this power and your voices are believer and you can shout to your enemy you can shout to a Malik and you can command them and those walls can be broken down but you have to speak to your enemy you have to know who it is that speaking because it's not you that's speaking to your enemy and they utterly destroyed all that was in the city both men and woman young and old sheep the nest with the edge of office order now I like it that their enemy is slain with the edge of the sword because there's only one way to slay here in in the end that's to bring it into subjection to the word so the Lord's just been working with me on this thought of of infant seeds seeds when they're just young just young and the reason that we sometimes miss these little seats and they get in us because we can get amnesia and Satan was very cunning in his own thoughts and how he could get into the bride you know that rich rag and it went after the went after the manchild it thought of it could deal and it could deal with the child if it can use the seed it's the easiest time to to get something in and he can get something into you easy if he comes after the seed he went after Jesus when he was a child because that was the most vulnerable time to get him but you can't defeat the plant God but we can take a lesson from that and we can go as seed while it's small while it's in this infant stage and then but we have to recognize what's actually taking place in our generation what's actually taking place and then he said what what's happened because when you lose sight of that you get amnesia because you forget the purpose of why we're here in questions and answers now what let me give you a little twister here just a minute I would say how many has the Holy Ghost all of you raise up your hand I'd say all right I'll see if you have the Bible said that they that had the Holy Ghost saw it and cried day and night for the abominations done in the city now how many hand would go up how many of you can't rest at night so full of joy the power of God and so sad for the people that's lost that night day and night you weep and cry for the abominations you won't see who would be in that city how many is that's in the church that's what the Bible said the holy spoke holy spirit evidence was now you know that I I believe that you can sigh and cry and your heart it might not be so much outwardly seen but as you go through the city you're just crying and you're upset and you can't stand the things that are around you but may we never get so so cold that we that we're not touched by the Sun he told the ceiling angel a zq9 that's right he said take go through the city set a mark upon those who saw him cry for the abominations dead in the city the rest of them let the destroying angel destroy them no matter how much members there was how many things they've done seed put a man with an ink corn Rider and a man with an ink worn rider dressed in white which represented the holy spirit come forth and put a mark upon all of them that cider cried for the abominations done in the city now you say and watch what he said they're also slay utter utterly little children old woman babies kill them all little children yes when Joshua entered the land of Canaan he said don't you let one of them live that's a cute little baby a little of malachite or am i right killer you remember he'll grow up to be an Amalekite he'll pollute the camp and when those little things come back like that disagreeing with the Word of God get rid of that thing I don't care what denomination it belongs to you say well they're good I don't care how good of people they are if they're contrary to that word get the thing out of you it's a growing little Amalekite looks cute looks innocent it looks like it's alright but you don't have anything to do with it you stay away from it well brother Brennan might go down here because well I don't you just remember any Amalekite anything that denies the words stay away from it have nothing to do with it a little how many believes that that's the truth sure it is see stay away from it stay away from it there's something rising up stay away from it if there's any question in your mind whether this is right wrong stay away from it now I want to go back to my thought my title of spiritual amnesia and we're going to go to a loss and this is what brother Brennan top for a scripture but I'm trying to merge three things together here with all this hey that's on the fork I'm trying to merge together the problem the cause and the remedy so we can overcome and not grow an Amalekite so Amos 3 verse 1 here this word that the Lord has spoken against you O children of Israel against the whole family which I brought up out of the land of Egypt saying he's speaking to you that have come up out of the land of Egypt you only have I known of all the families of the earth therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities can two walk together except they be agreed well a lion roar in the forest when he hath no prey well a young lion cry out of his den if he have taken nothing can a bird fall on a snare upon the earth where there is no gen for him shall one take up a snare from the earth and have taken nothing at all shall a trumpet be blown in the city and the people not be afraid shall there be evil in the city and the LORD hath not done it surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealed his secret unto his servants the prophets the lion hath wrought who will not fear the Lord God hath spoken who can not but prophesy now I want to speak a bit about Amos and then come back and just look at this text a bit more but you know brother Brennan tells a bit of history will drama rises Amos because we don't know a lot about him in the Bible and I think we can parallel a lot of what I'm also seeing into this day and age maybe he was even seeing this day when he wrote this prophecy and as an Amos appeared in Israel in a time when when it was in great prosperity that they had possession of the land and all things were good and you know the churches were big I'm sure that it was a time when everybody was settled and not worried and not didn't have any fear didn't have any fear of the enemy and I bet this Amos he just sort of appeared from nowhere you know he doesn't have any fellowship cards he doesn't have any association to any church he nobody even knew who Amos was and I was thinking you know like just because Israel was in this time of prosperity and god bless Israel when they were what when they were when they were doing right god bless Israel but just because they were being blessed that didn't mean that they were doing all things good to be blessed for a time and that fall again and to the true believer I see a blessing it it's not monetary I mean I don't need a monetary blessing of up to be in the will of the Lord following the will of the Lord I'd rather my blessings come and seeing the power of God display seeing the power of God works so amos wasn't fooled by any of the riches in the city as he went through Jerusalem you know he was a country man he was a herdsmen and he seemed to just appear out of nowhere he didn't have this great family name is it to be FIRREA was a lot like brother Brennan it seems to be just the pattern that God uses as prophets you know they won't see how could any good thing either come out of Kentucky I mean Nazareth you know that's just God's pattern it's the way he does things the wise men at that age wouldn't even consider one that come from such a place then as quick as these prophets showed up they disappear and they quickly forgotten it was from Cain seed that came forth the first civilization there Enoch built but ceased seed were herdsmen they weren't they weren't part of this the city life wasn't part of God's seed there was something about the city that should make the seed of God's eye and crying you for the wickedness that's done there and you know I'm not trying to preach shall I go move out to the country but you know like I enjoy the open space I love the country I come into the city all right man I just I don't want to be here something just inside me I just oh I just makes me uncomfortable and nervous in my own skin so as Amos was coming through the city it wasn't the attractions that we're catching as a tension you know I can imagine say if Amos flow into Wellington today and there's many beautiful things you know I wonder if he went out over to peripera Beach beautiful beach and I wonder if he just looked over the top of those half maybe two dozen half-naked woman and just come then what a beautiful beach see out to Kathy Island what a beautiful beach so it wasn't aimless he was looking and going how can how can these people bet do this how have we gone so far away from the Word of God he didn't actually notice any of that beauty all he seen was the Sun done in the city there was no beauty that could they could calm his grieving heart because he was carrying the word of the Lord he had a message for the people amen I imagine he was a bit of an oddball you know he probably looked like a bum amongst us fashion city looked a bit old-fashioned and he had nowhere to preach had no pulpit no one would accept them into their pulpit to preach no fellowship card but he had a message he had thus saith the Lord to get across to the people so I wonder how he would be received today if he come but thus saith the Lord would anybody have a time to hear him but anybody receive what he had to say I find that not many people would believe what he had to say there might be a small group I'd be a small group here that would they would hear what Amos had to say he had preached the word for sure and it would be the original seed now I wondered what if Amos was to start a prayer line and start the what have he come into this church and he started a prayer line and he started to discern your thoughts oh my because that's where Satan plants as unfit seeds right that's the battleground and that's where he plants these little thoughts just little seeds and I just wonder you know like thinking back on brother Brennan's discernment line he'd be there and he have a prayer line and as he started to discern the people's thoughts as they come up the prayer line other ones behind would start leaving the prayer lines start getting out because they had something a little Amalekite a little seed there they might go to church be good people right but they just didn't want to deal with that Amalekite you have to be prepared to deal there's nothing wrong with having a wrong seed there if you're willing to deal with it God puts his finger on any go Lord I've got to deal with that I hope no one in here would get out of the prayer line why did Israel keep backsliding and letting in worldly ism the reason is as time went on they forgot they forgot what God had done for them they had forgot the battles that they had fought they forgot the men that had died died in the fight they had forgotten the martyrs they forgot that amnesia and the more time that went on since those battles the more they forget it's easy to forget I was thinking the other day what about that mass shooting that happened down in Christchurch whoever hears about that now it's never on the news the only thing I ever hear about on the news is guns are bad we need a banner what about the guy that did it what about the people that died all we hear about his gun see we live in such a corrupt world such a corrupt world it's easy to forget and the general public doesn't even think twice of it I haven't heard a single person say anything to me about it for months so when we leave this church and to me I would say when you come off that street and you come across that footpath you look up that's the most beautiful sight there is in the city it's the most beautiful places in the city there is nothing in this city that should attract your attention more than coming to this place anything else out there is just vanity it's just vain okay maybe some of your homes are beautiful but churches you all come together and it's just beautiful all together you know but when I go out of this building I don't see beauty out there I don't see anything of this world that's going to hold me here because I've caught a glimpse of my heavenly home and there's nothing that's going to hold me here spiritual amnesia and of his voice would be here tonight and Birmingham I would claim the same thing to the churches the very God you claim to have served will destroy you someday I'm not speaking to this audience here these tapes go around the world now remember that is true then he found out when he come into the city oh all this stuff I wonder he must have felt to look and see the decay of the people of God to whom he was seen I wonder brother branham's really just talking about how he feels I wonder how he would receive from now I wonder if if he would come and I wonder would we cooperate with him what we given our best would we give him our attention would we repent and be told us that we should go back to the word of the Lord and do what the way the Lord said so I wonder what our sisters would do about their Bob here what they would if they would lately here grow out again if Amos come on he would preach it I'm telling you that because it's the word of the Lord some get out on the street there and mow the yard out in the yard when men he found them in that day with a bad case of a disease spirit have I know Anna preached on a Wednesday night I'm not going to write anything until Monday facts and information and because people seem to have lost the memories of what's taking place they turn their back on the facts and we even see people that have had great experiences even our friends that have had great experiences with the Lord and they forget those experiences that they've had and that causes amnesia and you you can't lose your salvation that you lose your identity you start to live below your privileges because you don't realize who you are you forget and I where we're in a battle and we must fight don't lose your identity while everybody else is rejoicing and shouting and singing the praises of God and you just feel so down and robbed it because you've lost your identity other causes I found this interesting other causes include head and brain injuries and I thought isn't that just true because this is where the battleground is so it's a head injury that causes you to lose your memories and when Satan comes in and that little battleground and plant seeds and it causes you to get amnesia be sober as a devil walketh around as a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour you know this there's so many things we just let little Amalekites come in we need to be so ready to fight this enemy you can you can become you know these little seeds when they grow up they grow into that full malachite so for the sake of a little little wine for my stomach's sake it seems like it's okay you know it seems innocent like it's not hurting anyone I'm not getting drunk it's just a little innocent seed but you've got to look at when that seed grows up and it just when it's a little sprout it looks just like the wheat right it just looks the same but what our kids because they've got a drinking problem but you sowed the seed as a baby got to be so careful what Amalekites we let into our life may be so innocent to us but it's so damaging for someone else and brother branham speaks of three other things that will cause spiritual amnesia and it's preaching a different doctrine than what brother ben's preaching and you start to question well is this right well that's right I don't know all I'm just going to leave the message because I don't know what's right you've got to know who you're following and you've got to have trust in what you believe don't get between two opinions that will pull you away now there is a place when you get this amnesia you might get like Nebuchadnezzar who was exalted himself one time and godly didn't think he was an animal and he left out in the wilderness and eat grass like an ox and as his grow down his body like eagle feathers and he had become the heart of a beast in them see that was M neva because he had forgotten that he was king he had forgotten that he was a human being and he thought he was an animal so he acted like an animal because he forgot he was a human being that's so easy today and we forget sometimes what the Christian Church is we act like the world that shows that we've got spiritual amnesia because that you don't act like a Christian you act like the world you receive the heart of the world and it causes this I want to be a Christian I'm going to be you know trying to stay the other when I first I was an atheist before I got converted I hated the idea of Christianity and when the Lord showed me and numbers and pet I didn't know I didn't I had no idea what the gospel was I had no idea but I just see that there's a God I'm gonna serve them so if you're gonna be a Christian be a real Christian don't be a lukewarm it's just fear and it has no virtue to it all it has no strength you crush them walk at all I'm gonna skip details because I'm a ripple through the message and it's Satan getting in with a little seed and at that time that seed looks innocent just a little doctrine but as it begins to grow that seed grows into a tree and the tree doesn't look like the word so we've got to watch they're shocked and because of that shock now it's cause people when they see little things like tombs like bride age and all these other things that come up because of shock because of a false doctrine now they're scared shocks caused them to have amnesia amnesia and rather been took my story again on Sunday morning when he talked about those French soldiers they come back from it was moving him the guard was just following him to see what he would do and my son and the amnesia broke and left them now maybe there's been someone you know that's had shock in their life that's called systemic injury in their life then they've got amnesia and now you can bring them back by bringing them back to the word and just fellowshipping and going through the scriptures I kind of thought like those two that were on the road from the males and they were sad they were said the Christ had just risen from the dead and they were said they had the worst amnesia ever but look what Jesus did he started a fellowship Oh false life harder you know it's so easily forgotten the promises and as he fellowship then it were what about this and what about this and the amnesia broke and they recognized that it was Jesus Christ among them sometimes we need a instead of casting people off all the leaders don't see the message maybe we just need to get past our own thoughts and hurts and just fellowship a little bit just fellowship talk about the word let the amnesia break amen you could be the one that draws near to that person so this is my foundation my foundation I want to point out what brother Branham is showing us as the thrust of this message in M Niva you know up until 1963 s preaching sermons man age sermons he's trying to help you along the road grow as a Christian but after 9:00 after 1963 he says ministry changes and he keeps saying like what the Lord did remember sunset mountain remember this remember this remember the visions and he's pointing back he's looking back to something that's taken place I read from the unveiling of God now my subject this morning I trust that God will revealed us and each time the few who would take the tapes and listen I hope and trust that you have had a spiritual understanding of what God has been trying to get over to the church without saying it right out see it's a thing sometime we have to say things in such a way that it might thin down and might bring some to go out some to leave and some to ponder over but it's done that's done purposely it must be done that way then it must be that some would say you mean God would purposely do a thing like that he certainly did and he does you this way you can so often someone will text me and they'll say oh do you know where brother Branham see this I can't find it anywhere in the message and it's like brother Brennan so often you cannot find a direct quote for what God has revealed to you because God is revealing this message to you personally but things are said that you might catch it but it's not revealed to the public and you can't find a direct quote in your searching search right now it's in there but God's revealed it to you but you can't find it it's hidden from the public so just coming back to his scripture that he took for amnesia he said well a lion draw in the forest when he hath no prey the Lions not going to give us victory raw if he has no prey he rules because his quarters pray well the young lion cry out of his Dean of the taken nothing no he's not he said he's taken nothing can a bird fall upon us near we're no gina's from do you understand what what the prophets saying here nothing's not done for no purpose is a purpose why these things are done shall one take up a snare of the earth and having taken nothing at all now this prophecy he's picking up from Amos he's relating it into his own his own ministry shall a trumpet be blown in the city and the people not be afraid shall there be evil in the city and the LORD hath not done it surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealeth secrets unto the prophets the lion hath roared who will not fear the Lord God hath spoken who can but prophesy now I just want to bring this back into Revelation 5 and just pick it up here and I saw and the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof has the book been open has the seals been open amen and no man in heaven nor on earth neither under earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and I wit much because no man was found worthy to open the book and to read the book neither to look thereon then who opened the book wasn't brother Brennan that was opening the book no man was worthy and one of the elders saith unto me weep not behold the Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof so he's saying there in the name of the lion hath roared who will not fear that the Lord God has spoken who can but prophesy the Lord God has spoken who shall not fear yet we can walk around in this world and act as if we have no fear of God on us and and not take seriously the things that are taking place right now it has never been an event since Jesus Christ rose from the dead like what's happened in your generation and yet it just walked day-to-day life and not even think twice about the sin that's around us we have to be so on guard of leading their Amalekite come into our life amen brother Branham would point up to that cloud and he would say that's our judge up there you know but as the seals unveiled we begin to swing a minister an evangelist gets up in the pulpit and he's tearing stripes a few hands shouting preaching like I don't preach and he's but I'm hoping that you don't because some people say Manny was just preaching at me I hope you don't see a lion I hope you see a lamb as it was being slain because he's he's loves you and has ministry is to help pull you from that condition and pull you up into your promise you've got to see the land and if the Word of God came to us then God came to us you cannot separate God in His Word something change from was what it was all the way through the church ages and marriage takes place here now so the bride had been wearing a veil for 2,000 years when we got married I don't know how they do it now because traditions just seemed to get worse and worse and worse but when we got married my wife wore a veil over her face and as she come up she was veiled and she couldn't see through that veil clearly she could see in the Eze looking through maybe like a glass darkly but she couldn't see me clearly and the bride's been walking 2000 years with that veil over her face and then when Christ come in 63 and he unveiled the word he took that veil off her face because when the marriage takes place I took the veil off her face and now she sees me as face to face and that's what's happened in this generation the unveiling of God when this veil has took off the word the traditions has taken off the word as Jesus once said when you see me you see the father see God and his word as one now you understand when the word is manifested what does it see jesus said search the Scriptures you think you have you believe God believe also in me if I do not the works of my father then don't believe me but if I do the works I and my father are one when you see me you have seen the father and when you see the word manifest you see the father God because the word is the father the word is God and the word may mean efest as God Himself taking his own word and manifesting it among believers now nothing can make it love but believers just believers and then another one there if one would come today like that that would be rejected just the same they had a bad case of it and so we have today the spiritual signs and the preaching of an ordained Messenger of God never stirred them any more the woman could laugh right in their face and say I don't have to go and hear such stuff as that if that hasn't repeated again what is it spiritual amnesia exactly that forgotten that God and his word is the same he cannot change it I mean they had amnesia now the profits gone brother branham's gone but the word never left the word come to us and the word stayed the profit had to go because he had to decrease just as when Jesus came the profit had to decrease so the word could increase Jesus was the word and the word is here to increase and by coming into you you make it live and you start to manifest the word and the word is on display to this world but when you begin to mess what God's doing you get to come into this place of amnesia because you don't take what's taking place serious enough because of you knew what was taking place it would be so serious and nothing else mattered nothing else matters God's here with me and he's manifesting and he's judging this world he's about to pour out all these vials of plagues and judgments and because we forget it's like we let things come in that we should never let come into our life and I just wonder you know if every now and again we ourselves don't get struck with a better debt amnesia and I'm talking about myself too I'm preaching to myself this message I just wonder you know we a little bit of YouTube here a little bit of YouTube there these things and then you notice I was talking to a friend about this you know because this is what happens to me I start watching something and I'm like man I've got to get there I'll start watching a guitar video like now I got to get that guitar but it's just a seed it's just an analogy and if you do the same with the word then the word becomes more and more real and you do the same with the word teach train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it now I believe that this scripture can also fit in to a believer we know it doesn't matter how old you are when you come in you're just a babe now there's gotta be something poured into that life while he's young it's a trip to Train and so that he grows up in the right way just that whether you're kids as well naturally but you're so vulnerable in that early stage of life and so I want to relay it better the conversation I had and it doesn't matter who said it the after the conversation the Lord started showing me how it related in a spiritual sense so one of my friends is it's quite hard on his kids you know go swimming that wear pants you know the message says we're parents or that we're parents and he's separate the boys swimming from the guilty he's quite hard line on them and so my friend says well you know and I always actually thought the same way too until maybe recently when as kids grow up they'll resent that because that was forced upon them and the Lord started dealing with me and saying you know what that's true but there's something that changes that and because I know my friend really well and I know how much time he pours into the life of those kids that no one else sees and so those kids now have a respect for him and a love for him because he's every night and the word showing them so that it's not just a law to them they actually know why they're doing it and he spends that time now they're not going to do it because it's law they do it be out of respect for father because they love that and they want to please dad and I think it's the same in our own Christian walk the Lord was saying you know what that's the same for a believer when dad's got your heart he doesn't have to force law down your throat because you want to do it because you want to please dad what is dead like and dad taught me this I love dad so much I'm gonna stay with us and that's what we should be like we have to have a relationship with God amen as Paul said you know all things are lawful for me that not all things are expedient because some things are a seed that will grow into a big ugly tree I can do it and the Lord won't condemn me if I'm got the seed of God in my heart I'm saved but it's not going to be good for my Christian walk it's not gonna be good for those around me we need to cast out those sprouts kill the young he'll our Young Amalekites I just want to give a few examples of how Satan has perverted and started tearing apart civilization in a short space of time because I don't know if you've noticed but in a short space of time you go you take back 17 years and you see what Satan has done in this ages just shocking and we should be so concerned about it we should be we shouldn't just accept that as the normal we should we should be we should be protecting our young we should be protecting the weaker ones on the Lord because when we entertain something we're actually entertaining the Spirit that's behind that thing and we're invite we're creating an atmosphere so I want to just give a couple of things for examples and I'm not condemning anybody if they do any of these things or anything I'm just using these four examples because this is what the Lord's laid on my heart to show and then I'm going to put it in your court and then you can consider whether the seed of what either you do is an Amalekite or not right so you see where I'm going you you test yourself so for an example kids like to sing these songs and clapping dances and all stuff and so one thing that caught my attention is that Ryan ringa roses pocket full of posies a tishoo a tishoo we all fall down ashes and the water ashes and the sea we all jump up with a 1-2-3 really fun for the kids right really fun but what's what's the spirit behind that behind that right because it goes back to the Great Plague and II and England and 1665 called Black Death it was a horrible plague and it killed quarter of London's population the Roses referred to the rash that would break forth and the body and the posies would refer to the flowers that they used to carry to stop the smell of the infection and then the following thing was a ritesh ooh and death we all fall down because it was no cure for the black death plague i had no medicine they died and so many people died ashes in the water ashes into the sea they had to just cremate bodies and get rid of the ashes was a horrible thing now what's the spirit behind that song what's that what are we entertaining with it see then I come into this church here and there's all these young and I see father Abraham had many sons many sons had father Abraham I am one of them and you are - Iceman yeah you know what's the spirit behind it hallelujah the kids rejoicing you're teaching them in the way you want to grow up see there's a spirit behind both of those things and the first one might not be wrong on the natural the kid doesn't understand what it's singing right it doesn't know but it's a little of Malachi that looks innocent but when it grows into the tree what is their black death look like it's ugly another example as cartoons and children's movies all right and I didn't even know what's out there these days but Satan only has to plant a seed through that now you look at a kid it's funny how you can give a kid this tablet and he'll take that and you'll like it a mini bus and you can go away and do something you come back and they'll be like this and then you can come back 24 hours later it'll be like this because that's just a direct channel from from hell straight into your child's eyes so you've got to be so careful what's coming through that channel has like back when I was a bit younger a long time ago and we had things called SpongeBob and SquarePants seemed like such a little innocent little cartoon I never even considered it now when I go back and look at it I see that through that whole movie was Masonic symbolism everywhere just preparing people for all this horrible evil that's only come on the earth when the bride leaves and they just really accept it because it's already being programmed into them when the little of Malachi grows up this is why it's so important not to forget where we're at and not get amnesia the seriousness of the day and then you look at these video games when they first started out and they're a Tetris block game blocks go together you know so innocent just a little little it was such a cute little baby you know and then it went into snakes and ladders and we should have started to get a bit worried when a snake came on the game we didn't and then it turned into Sonic the Hedgehog you know and I was just progressing a little bit is still quite innocent but then it starts turning into this they're going ugly monster right it starts turning into these first-person shooter games where now the person has the gun and you're playing remember this the screen that's captivated their attention now you've got the gun and you're going around Oh something has transitioned and this Amalekites starting to grow up a little bit and it's starting to look real ugly now I would hate to know where games are now but when I left the world there was a game called Grand Theft Auto and it was such a horrible game that it would send you out on a mission and the city in Los Angeles and it would tell you to go and do the most greatest violent crime against a woman and that's accepted by the world that's okay what are that what's been injected what are the but it just started off as just a little Amalekite just a little seed so cute so innocent could it grow up so I know I'm running out of time and I just want to give one more one more example because it's won this one the Lord's laid on my heart for years and I've never really shared so when I was growing up we lived out in the country a mum and dad wouldn't let us sudden sight and play computer games we did have a PlayStation but we very rarely played it on a rainy day and we certainly weren't allowed to play what we see played today but we had this natural human instinct in us and that's his brother giant Brian Jones says our eyes are in our front and means were a predator we're a hunter we don't have eyes on the side of our head we're not a bunny hugger we eat meat so this natural instinct and me as a child with this hunting instinct and so we would go around and we would see what we've ins we can make to go and hunt the birds and hunt the rabbits we'd go and cut down the neighbors gum tree and take a stick out at the top of it and leave the tree lying on the ground and make our bow and arrow and mum and dad taught us to respect those weapons are dangerous you've got to be careful as we got older you know I think maybe seven dad bought us a slug gun and now we start a target shooting and he would see that targets and we'd line these targets up shoot the target says great fun but dad taught us that you should never point a gun at each at anybody whether it's a toy whether it's loaded unloaded you don't point a gun at someone that's dangerous so we had other toys in the house like those little spring-loaded things that shoots a little sucky dart and Adam we'd go and we'd shoot targets in the house and shoot sometimes light bulbs became targets but there drummed it into us if I shot it at my sister you'd never point a gun at someone it's dangerous it's a weapon and never point a gun at someone so as I grew up we had this respect for firearms and we got bigger firearms on the farm I think when I was 10 I got a 22 and dad would let me go out on I shouldn't say that I used to sneak the 22 out of the gun safe and go and shoot rabbits on the farm and but we had respect but you see now how perverted the world has come that Satan wants to plant seeds and the children with weapons what's the seed what comes what's what does the tree grow into now you go into the warehouse and they've got all the rows of games and the rose got some games and you get to this row and on this side it's completely filled with gang games and this side it's completely filled with it's like the biggest toy oil in the shop and the kids are all fighting each other and it's so innocent as really is innocent but it's just it's planting a little of malachite and that seed has to grow up into a tree we have to be so careful what we entertain in our life because you're sowing into the child's life when it's young and it's just like that lovely malachite seed you have to consider what it's going to grow into but because of any Jie when we get so blase as to say about what's going on and we forget the seriousness of the hour that that we're living in kids have got a plate but we can choose what we sow into their life because now we're living in an age where we see mass murders everywhere kids are walking into school with a machine yeah bubble bubble churches getting blown up because the kids have just had it drummed into them first-person shooter games shooting in the house of shooting each other it's just Satan is just perverting he's just prover ting we've got to be so careful what we entertain don't get amnesia in the state come back to the word take a reality check amen take a reality check in here because everything we do right now and this time should be according to this because what's the other option you either love for God or or you're going to be partaker of the place and I don't want to be a partaker of those breaks lord help us so if you can't do something in the name of Jesus Christ then don't do it I just want to finish with a quote spiritual amnesia how can you be a Christian and deny the word you can't do it God is the word if the word is in you you and the word are the same all the word is you are amen what part of of what we've just been talking about as part of word all the word is you are or should be Amen if I'm living in this generation what this portion of the word has promised for this generation I've got to be that if I'm going to be a Christian I've got to be identified with all that the Bible preachers and stands for hallelujah gonna call me a Holy Roller anyhow I feel pretty religious right now yes sir amen I've got to be identified with everything that the Bible claims and give it claims and if I haven't been stricken with this modern-day spiritual amnesia I will be and can be identified with us and then I just pray I pray sincerely that you can be identified with this and you can consider the hour that we love them consider the seriousness of what's taking place because the world doesn't see what you see even even the churches that really sincerely worship God they don't see what you see they're lucky if they've even been invited to the wedding let alone still wearing a veil you're a lucky you're a blessed chosen people let's make the most of what God has given to us I mean let's just stand and some musicians come and and we'll just pray and maybe we'll sing you chose me because I just am so thankful that God chose me and a brother and he's got a few songs on his heart let's pray dear Heavenly Father Lord it's as such a serious our Lord that we've entered into for two thousand years Lord it's just that something has just changed father and lord I just pray Lord for this congregation or this body of ours law that we would just search ourselves Lord and utterly slay Lord any seed of discrepancy Lord that would be in us or that we would listen leave nothing unturned Lord but father I just pray Lord that we could just be your people Lord that we could find our identity in you Lord Jesus all that your word as Lord may we be that further and all that your words not Lord let us cast out let us deal to a molecular be let's deal to the flesh Lord and Lord we just pray that those slaughtering angels Lord would just come into our own life whether it be through trials and through the famines Lord through plagues Lord that just come in and just just draw us closer to you Lord through persecution Lord through a squeeze father whatever it takes Lord just come in and slaughter those Anila kites in our life Lord just come in Lord Jesus and just cleaners Lord and give us a fleshly heart Lord to receive your word I pray father I pray Lord when the people look into your word and see these things Lord that they wouldn't see a lion Lord but that's here lamb is that have been slayed for them Lord Jesus to take their place Lord father I just thank you Lord Jesus I thank you that you've chosen us Lord I thank you Lord that you've just journeyed with us Lord that you've shown us the things that we've had to deal with and Lord I just think thank you so much you've chosen me Lord we just give you the praise Lord and pray Lord that you just let the people take the words home and consider what's been said Lord and father let's see my heart to Lord and love and sincerity for them Lord Jesus hallelujah we thank you in Jesus name Amen can you bring the song [Music] nail-scarred

Lord but only your grace would lift them need you Lord Oh father I pray Lord that you would come tonight in such a way and renew a godly conscience within us Lord I pray Lord that Lord there is no one

depend on you and father Oh Lord I pray Lord Jesus there tonight Lord that none of us would push aside the word that has been spoken the seriousness of the hour that we're in Lord and father of their

poisoning spirits Oh father I pray that tonight Lord would be a night of change Oh God oh and Jesus name I give up these things to you all and if there's anybody in here it has felt conviction in their heart and then you know that the Lord has dealt with you tonight the altar is open for you to renew your conscience to be calibrated back to fear God again because the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom the fear of God there's sensitivity so those little things those little Amalekites would convict you again the elders open [Music] and just remember the altar is yo ha there is mercy here for the deepest hardest things that you think is impossible there is mercy here tonight the blood hasn't lost its power the blood still speaks freedom that's proclaiming Liberty to the captives and restoration to the blind it's proclaiming our godly conscience and every heart of the bride for the sensitivity to be regained so that your heart can be broken for the things that is going on in this place the things is going on in that world but it's still full of joy because it's the Holy Ghost that is leading you there is a seriousness of this hour [Music] and it's very easy to forget that but tonight you and I have an opportunity to be renewed in our mind the spirit of our mind to be renewed so the option is yours for God search the huts search our hearts Lord father see if there be any wicked way in us tonight Lord anything that would be displeasing to you father we want to lad at your altar Lord you sent a prophet in this our Lord you restored our approach to you Father you rebuilt the altar again and Lord we want to lay on that altar tonight we want to lay as a living sacrifice Lord Oh God if there's anything Lord Lord in our lives father I pray you'd come and wash it away in the name of Jesus Christ it may Lord Jesus this opportunity not be passed by or passed up for some reasoning but lord I pray that no one would leave this building with a seared conscience Oh God how hard it is Lord Jesus to regain a godly conscience once we've said it but lord I believe father that you here tonight Lord to heal to bind up the bridge to restore human emotions take Lord put our affections back on things above and not to get our joy from the things below not to get our joy from the tree of knowledge of good and evil but Lord Jesus you have given us a fountain oh oh I pray Lord Jesus that you would speak to every heart Lord take these words may Lord Jesus we're become sensitive to you again that we've become sensitive to and recognize the enormity

darkness sets in for so long that our eyes are just and Lord Jesus father window with someone preaches the light of God is too bright and it just goes past as long we can't see the wood from the tree sometimes father because we've learned to live in the dark because the darkness has become common it's become easy as become a comfort but Lord we don't want that as our comfort us Lord we want to be Lord we want the Holy Ghost is our comforter tonight Oh God we want to throw everything else off so that you can be our only comfort laws and the things that you've given us can comfort us not what
