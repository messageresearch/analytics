[1:02:27] we're going to read just the first six
[1:02:28] verses of deuteronomy 29 here and then
[1:02:32] i mean so it says here
[1:02:41] these are the words of the covenant
[1:02:43] which the lord commanded moses to make
[1:02:46] with the children of israel in the land
[1:02:47] of moab beside the covenant which he
[1:02:50] made with him in horeb and moses called
[1:02:52] unto all israel and said unto them ye
[1:02:54] have seen
[1:02:56] all that the lord did before your eyes
[1:02:58] in the land of egypt under pharaoh and
[1:03:00] unto all his servants and unto all his
[1:03:02] land
[1:03:03] the great temptations which thine eyes
[1:03:05] have seen
[1:03:06] the signs and those great miracles
[1:03:10] yet
[1:03:11] the lord hath not given you a heart to
[1:03:13] perceive
[1:03:14] and eyes to see
[1:03:16] and ears to hear
[1:03:18] unto
[1:03:19] this day

[1:04:42] praise in jesus christ's name amen amen
[1:04:45] god bless you you may have your seats
[1:04:47] this morning um
[1:04:49] so that's quite a so i want to
[1:04:52] look at this scripture here uh it's you
[1:04:55] think it's quite an incredible statement
[1:04:58] where moses has has you know if you see
[1:05:01] where they're standing there um they had
[1:05:04] been 40 years
[1:05:05] in the wilderness
[1:05:06] they had been in egypt they saw the
[1:05:08] plagues they saw the red sea open they
[1:05:10] saw incredible things happen but yet
[1:05:13] moses is telling the children of israel
[1:05:15] you saw them but you didn't see them
[1:05:18] you you know you saw what god did but
[1:05:20] you didn't actually have eyes to see
[1:05:22] until this day so they didn't have an
[1:05:24] understanding of really what was going
[1:05:25] on until that present moment
[1:05:28] to me that's incredible where someone
[1:05:30] can be in the miracle they can be in the
[1:05:32] deliverance oh you know the younger
[1:05:34] generation they walked through the red
[1:05:36] sea they saw the plagues they heard the
[1:05:38] cry of the egyptians when the you know
[1:05:40] the death angel came in the past
[1:05:42] overnight but they were safe under the
[1:05:43] blood they they saw you know god come
[1:05:47] down on mount sinai and incredible
[1:05:48] things happen but yet the lord told told
[1:05:52] them you haven't understood until now
[1:05:55] and this is being played out uh in this
[1:05:58] day now i just want to read a bit from
[1:06:00] hebrews 3 because
[1:06:02] we need to understand uh that the that
[1:06:05] the journey that israel took from egypt
[1:06:08] into the promised land uh is a shadow of
[1:06:10] the christian journey
[1:06:12] so the old testament is not just
[1:06:13] something that's tacked on the bible is
[1:06:15] history or something it's actually it's
[1:06:17] jesus christ revealed in the whole
[1:06:18] scripture
[1:06:19] and so when when we look in deuteronomy
[1:06:21] here in 29 this is not some abstract
[1:06:24] thing but it's actually god uh showed
[1:06:26] this in a shadow actually patenting our
[1:06:28] day
[1:06:30] so here we are we're going to read uh
[1:06:31] quite a bit here hebrews 3 from seven
[1:06:34] down to
[1:06:35] um
[1:06:36] four and and eleven i trust you don't
[1:06:38] mind this reading but i just wanna lay
[1:06:39] this foundation to to show um
[1:06:42] you know the apostle paul will be
[1:06:43] inspired by god to pick up this journey
[1:06:46] and and he would he would land as a as
[1:06:48] as a type of the of the christian
[1:06:50] journey
[1:06:51] he says wherefore
[1:06:53] uh as the holy ghost saith today if
[1:06:55] you'll hear his voice
[1:06:57] harden not your hearts as in the
[1:06:58] provocation in the days of temptation in
[1:07:01] the wilderness when your fathers tempted
[1:07:03] me prove me and saw my works forty years
[1:07:06] wherefore i was grieved with that
[1:07:07] generation and said they do all they
[1:07:09] earn their heart and they have not known
[1:07:12] my ways so i swear in my wrath they
[1:07:15] shall not enter into my wrist now you
[1:07:17] think about that verse
[1:07:19] 10 they have not known my ways but they
[1:07:22] were in his ways they saw his ways they
[1:07:24] saw his mighty hand they saw him doing
[1:07:26] credible things but they did not know
[1:07:28] his ways
[1:07:29] um so now
[1:07:31] now verse 12 take heed brethren
[1:07:34] least there be any of you an evil heart
[1:07:36] of unbelief and departing from the
[1:07:37] living god but exhort one another daily
[1:07:40] while it is called today least any of
[1:07:42] you be hardened through the
[1:07:43] deceitfulness of sin for we are made
[1:07:45] partakers of christ if we hold the
[1:07:48] beginning of our confidence steadfast
[1:07:50] until the end
[1:07:51] while it is said today if you'll hear
[1:07:53] his voice heart or not your heart is in
[1:07:55] the provocation for some when i heard
[1:07:58] did provoke howbeit not all that came
[1:08:00] out of egypt by moses but with whom was
[1:08:02] he grieved forty years was it not with
[1:08:04] them that had sinned whose carcasses
[1:08:06] fell in the wilderness and to whom swear
[1:08:09] he that they should not enter into his
[1:08:10] rest but to them that believe not so we
[1:08:13] see they could not enter in because of
[1:08:16] unbelief
[1:08:18] let us therefore fear at least a promise
[1:08:20] being made of us entering into his rest
[1:08:22] any of you should seem to come short of
[1:08:25] it
[1:08:25] for unto us was the gospel preached as
[1:08:27] well as unto them but the word preached
[1:08:30] did not profit them not being mixed with
[1:08:32] faith in them that heard it for we which
[1:08:34] have believed to enter into rest as he
[1:08:37] said as i've sworn in my wrath if they
[1:08:39] shall enter into my rest though the
[1:08:41] works were finished from the foundation
[1:08:43] of the world for he spake in a certain
[1:08:45] place of the seventh day on this wise
[1:08:47] and god did and god did rest the seventh
[1:08:50] day from all his works and in this place
[1:08:52] again they shall enter into my rest
[1:08:54] seeing therefore it remaineth that some
[1:08:56] must enter therein and they to whom it
[1:08:59] was first preached into not in because
[1:09:00] of unbelief again he limiteth a certain
[1:09:03] day saying in david today after so long
[1:09:06] a time as it has said today if you will
[1:09:08] hear his voice heart and not your hearts
[1:09:11] for if jesus had given them rest then he
[1:09:13] would not have have spoken of another
[1:09:15] day there remaineth therefore a rest to
[1:09:18] the people of god for he that entereth
[1:09:20] into his rest he also has ceased from
[1:09:22] his own works as god did from his let us
[1:09:26] labor therefore to enter into that rest
[1:09:29] lest any man
[1:09:30] fall after the same example of unbelief
[1:09:34] so the apostle paul is taking the
[1:09:36] journey of israel from egypt into the
[1:09:38] promised land and paralleling it with
[1:09:40] the christian journey now this rest that
[1:09:43] we talk about here is entering into the
[1:09:44] baptism of the holy ghost it is not
[1:09:46] keeping a day as it was in the old
[1:09:48] testament that was a shadow as the
[1:09:50] apostle paul would say in colossians let
[1:09:52] no man have respect for you of your new
[1:09:54] moons or sabbaths or feasts they are but
[1:09:56] a shadow but the fullness of christ
[1:09:59] right so so the rest even jesus would
[1:10:01] stand he'd say all you that labor come
[1:10:03] unto me and i'll give you rest i'll give
[1:10:05] you a true rest so not just keeping a
[1:10:07] human you're not just keeping a day but
[1:10:09] an eternal rest and we know that that
[1:10:11] rest is when you really receive the holy
[1:10:13] ghost you have you have entered into
[1:10:15] god's rest where it's no longer you
[1:10:17] trying to be the be the christian you're
[1:10:19] trying to do the works but it's him and
[1:10:21] you being the christian
[1:10:23] because that's why he says there where
[1:10:25] on the seventh day uh god rested he
[1:10:28] entered he sees from his own works
[1:10:30] so so this is verse 10 here um chapter
[1:10:33] four and and they that he that entereth
[1:10:35] into his rest he hath also ceased from
[1:10:37] his own works as god did from his
[1:10:39] because when you really meet god it's no
[1:10:41] longer you living
[1:10:42] the apostle paul said it's no longer i
[1:10:44] that liveth but christ that liveth in me
[1:10:46] so the apostle paul from experience is
[1:10:48] saying i have entered into that rest
[1:10:50] and and that is that is the absolute
[1:10:52] must of a christian jesus did not just
[1:10:55] um he did not just him he said you must
[1:10:58] be born again you must enter into this
[1:11:00] rest
[1:11:01] amen but you see now the so so what has
[1:11:04] happened in these last 50 odd years
[1:11:07] has as
[1:11:09] as israel went from egypt into the
[1:11:11] promised land so as the bride of christ
[1:11:13] made the same journey now there's been a
[1:11:16] lot of people who have who have started
[1:11:18] the journey
[1:11:19] um but
[1:11:20] it's those that finish the journey that
[1:11:21] really matter
[1:11:23] now
[1:11:24] you
[1:11:24] know they started out they were called
[1:11:27] out of egypt at an exodus
[1:11:30] and they came out in that exodus but
[1:11:32] there came a season where all of them
[1:11:34] actually could enter in the land because
[1:11:36] of faith
[1:11:37] you know the apostle paul would say here
[1:11:39] they could not enter him because of
[1:11:41] unbelief so they had to believe that
[1:11:42] generation that you know caleb and
[1:11:44] joshua's generation they had to believe
[1:11:47] that they could go enter into the land
[1:11:49] but they did not they they gave an evil
[1:11:51] report those other spies and they said
[1:11:53] we cannot go in but caleb and joshua
[1:11:55] they had a real faith the land is ours
[1:11:58] let's go get it we're not meant to be
[1:12:00] stuck in this wilderness here even even
[1:12:02] god would say in deuteronomy if i can
[1:12:05] find the scripture he says that when you
[1:12:07] go into the land you'll fulfill he um
[1:12:10] yeah my notes i don't know why i even
[1:12:11] have pages he says deuteronomy 4 and 12
[1:12:14] and the lord spake unto you out of the
[1:12:16] midst of the fire you heard the voice of
[1:12:18] the words but saw no multitude you only
[1:12:21] heard a voice and he declared unto you
[1:12:23] as covenant which he commanded you to
[1:12:25] perform even ten commandments and he
[1:12:26] wrote them upon two tables of stone and
[1:12:29] the lord commanded me at that time to
[1:12:31] teach you statutes and judgments that
[1:12:33] you might do them in the land whether
[1:12:35] you go over to possess it so so the word
[1:12:37] that came on mount sinai wasn't for the
[1:12:39] wilderness it was for the promised land
[1:12:41] right and it's the same thing with the
[1:12:43] with this word we have received it's not
[1:12:45] for us to be outside of christ and try
[1:12:48] and fulfill the word the word is for
[1:12:50] when you're in christ amen that is the
[1:12:52] that is the fundamental of a christian
[1:12:54] life is when you enter into that rest
[1:12:56] and god makes his word live in our lives
[1:12:59] amen so so there but so there was a
[1:13:01] season where when they came out of came
[1:13:04] out of egypt only a few of that
[1:13:06] generation really had faith they could
[1:13:08] go and take the land
[1:13:09] but they had church in the wilderness
[1:13:11] they had the mechanics there of church
[1:13:12] order how the priesthood sacrificed they
[1:13:14] had the tabernacle in the wilderness
[1:13:16] they had church and everything
[1:13:18] but only a few of that generation
[1:13:21] had faith that we're going to go take
[1:13:22] the land now when i talk about this i'm
[1:13:24] not talking about an age thing
[1:13:25] necessarily
[1:13:26] though it is on a dispensational level
[1:13:28] it's also on a personal level because
[1:13:30] i've known a few caleb and joshuas
[1:13:33] hallelujah 90 year old real warriors of
[1:13:36] the faith that believe and have actually
[1:13:38] gone and possessed a promise why they're
[1:13:40] not stuck up in legalism church fights
[1:13:42] and different things but they've pressed
[1:13:43] on and gotten every promise for them
[1:13:45] amen but now we're living in a caesar
[1:13:47] where it's not just a few have crossed
[1:13:49] jordan into the promised land really
[1:13:50] gone and received the holy ghost seeing
[1:13:52] the power of god manifested in their
[1:13:53] lives now it's a whole generation going
[1:13:55] in
[1:13:56] it means it's not just a few like it was
[1:13:58] caleb and joshua it's the whole group
[1:14:00] amen we know it's an individual walk
[1:14:02] though so we've got to keep that uh in
[1:14:04] mind but you see that moses was saying
[1:14:07] that you haven't been given eyes to see
[1:14:09] how to perceive ears to hear until this
[1:14:11] day though they had they had heard the
[1:14:13] word they had been sitting in church for
[1:14:15] 40 years they had been you know hearing
[1:14:17] all the doctrine hearing all the deep
[1:14:18] mysteries and things but they only given
[1:14:20] a heart to perceive at this season
[1:14:23] we're not going to cross it and take the
[1:14:24] fullness of the inheritance
[1:14:26] amen so this is this is the hour in
[1:14:28] which we live amen
[1:14:30] praise god
[1:14:31] amen nothing against those who who who
[1:14:33] have gone on in the faith i mean they
[1:14:35] had their portion but now we're living
[1:14:37] in a different season
[1:14:39] amen where there's a people that will go
[1:14:41] in and and actually possess every divine
[1:14:44] promise of god
[1:14:46] amen so the ministry of moses and joshua
[1:14:48] and israel's journey has repeated again
[1:14:50] in this end time
[1:14:52] amen not just on an individual level but
[1:14:54] on an age level where the believers have
[1:14:56] come out of egypt which types the world
[1:14:58] under the ministry of the prophet amen
[1:15:00] but have gone actually into possessed
[1:15:02] the promised land amen which we know our
[1:15:05] promised land is not the millennium
[1:15:07] right the promised land doesn't type the
[1:15:08] millennium because i mean there's war in
[1:15:10] the promised land there's killing you
[1:15:12] know when you read the story of the book
[1:15:14] of joshua who's read the book of joshua
[1:15:15] now i'm not talking now i know where i
[1:15:17] am i'm not i'm not isaac on jacob slater
[1:15:19] right now right you see that in the
[1:15:21] promised land this wars is fighting this
[1:15:23] bloodshed but in the millennium there's
[1:15:24] peace
[1:15:25] right so when we when we talk about the
[1:15:27] you know our promised land it's right
[1:15:29] now it's every divine promise in the
[1:15:31] holy ghost every divine promise in the
[1:15:33] word that we have we have been ordained
[1:15:35] to go and possess it not just talk about
[1:15:37] the promises but actually lay hold upon
[1:15:39] it
[1:15:40] amen become one with the promise
[1:15:43] amen so brother braham says in the
[1:15:45] message adoption he says now there's
[1:15:47] where the believer comes first he he
[1:15:50] comes first to a recognition that he's a
[1:15:51] sinner then he's separated by the waters
[1:15:54] the washing of the water by the blood or
[1:15:56] the washing of the water by the word
[1:15:57] rather believing on the lord jesus
[1:15:59] christ then being justified by faith
[1:16:01] pardon me he becomes a partaker and a
[1:16:04] peace with god through christ baptized
[1:16:06] in the name of jesus christ to admit him
[1:16:08] into the journey you get it into the
[1:16:10] journey then he comes a sojourner a
[1:16:12] pilgrim he's on his journey to what a
[1:16:14] promise that god made right so we start
[1:16:17] the journey we repent be baptized name
[1:16:19] the lord jesus christ for the remission
[1:16:21] of sin and the promises you shall
[1:16:22] receive the gift of the holy ghost you
[1:16:24] start your journey like pilgrim's
[1:16:25] progress but that's not the end of the
[1:16:27] journey we don't just want to start we
[1:16:28] want to finish
[1:16:30] who wants to finish
[1:16:32] amen so so we start the journey but we
[1:16:34] don't stay there right we keep pressing
[1:16:36] on
[1:16:38] he says israel had not yet received a
[1:16:39] promise but they are on their journey
[1:16:42] um
[1:16:43] he says he says please do understand
[1:16:45] that's where
[1:16:46] uh you nazaring pilgrim holiness and so
[1:16:48] forth fell because israel when they come
[1:16:50] to the spot of kadesh barnia when the
[1:16:52] spies went over and said the land is
[1:16:54] great but some of them come back and
[1:16:55] said we can't take it because the cities
[1:16:57] are walled up and so forth but joshua
[1:16:59] and caleb stood out and said we can take
[1:17:02] it
[1:17:02] amen we're more than able to take it
[1:17:04] because
[1:17:05] they but because of their already signed
[1:17:07] up documents and statements they
[1:17:08] believed in two works of grace
[1:17:10] justification sanctification they could
[1:17:12] not move any further and listen the
[1:17:13] whole generation perished in the
[1:17:15] wilderness but two that went over into
[1:17:17] the promised land and brought back the
[1:17:18] evidence that was a goodly land and we
[1:17:21] are more than able to take it because it
[1:17:22] was god's promise then instead of the
[1:17:24] people going on receiving the holy
[1:17:26] spirit speaking with tongues receiving
[1:17:28] the power of god the baptism of the holy
[1:17:30] ghost signs wonders miracles they felt
[1:17:32] that it would break down their
[1:17:33] traditions of doctrine and that's what
[1:17:35] happened to it perished in the land
[1:17:36] that's right but the believers the caleb
[1:17:38] and joshua outfit was going on to the
[1:17:40] promise they moved on over into the land
[1:17:43] they took the land they settled down in
[1:17:44] the land as a possession and we never
[1:17:47] stop at justification or sanctification
[1:17:50] let's go on to the baptism of the holy
[1:17:52] spirit let's not stop at believing on
[1:17:53] the lord jesus being baptized let's not
[1:17:56] stop because he cleaned us up from a
[1:17:57] life of sin but now we press into a
[1:18:00] position to a promise of the baptism of
[1:18:02] the holy ghost for peace to see the day
[1:18:04] of pentecost for the promises unto you
[1:18:06] and to your children and them that are
[1:18:08] far off even as many as the lord our god
[1:18:10] shall call that means we don't just want
[1:18:12] to stop at believing hey we have to
[1:18:14] believe we've got to receive him as our
[1:18:16] personal savior but the life that was in
[1:18:18] his blood must come into us change our
[1:18:21] lives amen and not just wash us from a
[1:18:23] life of sin but actually fill us that he
[1:18:25] now lives through our lives
[1:18:27] amen in the old testament the life that
[1:18:29] was in the bull or the goat or the lamb
[1:18:31] that the worshiper brought forth
[1:18:34] that could never change the believer's
[1:18:36] heart
[1:18:36] so so if he had done a sin i know he
[1:18:39] stole or whatever he did and that caused
[1:18:41] him to bring the lamb amen after that
[1:18:43] sacrifice was was offered on his behalf
[1:18:46] he could go away justified thanking god
[1:18:49] that that animal actually
[1:18:50] actually stood in his place and the
[1:18:52] wrath he should have received was poured
[1:18:54] out upon his sacrifice but it could
[1:18:56] never change his heart
[1:18:57] so so what caused him to fall and sin in
[1:19:00] the first place he still had that desire
[1:19:02] in him when he went away
[1:19:03] though he was justified friends we don't
[1:19:05] want to come to that place we want to go
[1:19:06] beyond that where the lord changes our
[1:19:09] heart i mean that
[1:19:11] that the bondage of sin doesn't keep us
[1:19:13] bound but now we're free because god has
[1:19:14] delivered us amen that we go back to it
[1:19:17] no more
[1:19:18] amen that's why we've got to press on
[1:19:20] not just leaving leaving the world under
[1:19:22] the blood not just going through the
[1:19:24] wilderness in a legalistic uh way and we
[1:19:27] and this is where we're really where
[1:19:28] we're going to go but we've got to cross
[1:19:31] jordan into the baptism of the holy
[1:19:32] ghost now
[1:19:35] we know that it takes the dynamic power
[1:19:38] of god
[1:19:39] to make the church move
[1:19:41] right it's more than just putting the
[1:19:43] machinery together
[1:19:45] you know you can get i don't know what
[1:19:46] the newest hypercar is in the world but
[1:19:48] you could have one of those and it could
[1:19:50] be the specs you could have all the
[1:19:52] specs of it it could be proven what it
[1:19:53] does but if it doesn't have anything to
[1:19:55] ignite the fuel if it doesn't have that
[1:19:57] spark plug that fire i mean to make it
[1:20:00] go down the road it might as well just
[1:20:01] be like some little matchbox toy on the
[1:20:03] shelf because it doesn't do what it says
[1:20:05] it can do i mean but we want to just not
[1:20:07] say what the word can do we want to see
[1:20:09] it live in our lives amen with the power
[1:20:11] of the fire the holy ghost firing the
[1:20:13] word to make it live
[1:20:14] amen that's what we want
[1:20:17] mean because it's not the mechanics that
[1:20:19] runs the automobile it's the dynamics
[1:20:21] that runs it
[1:20:22] amen and the mechanics don't run the
[1:20:24] church that's the dynamics this is from
[1:20:26] looking under jesus 1964 it's the
[1:20:28] dynamics the holy ghost that gets into
[1:20:31] this word it's not a seminary that
[1:20:32] teaches you all the theology and greek
[1:20:34] interpretations there's a dynamics of
[1:20:36] the holy ghost in there to set that
[1:20:38] afire and to bring it to pass and make
[1:20:41] it live just exactly what that promised
[1:20:43] word is for this hour not the mechanics
[1:20:45] the dynamics it takes the mechanics and
[1:20:47] the dynamics the word and the spirit
[1:20:49] they are the one that gives life amen so
[1:20:52] we need the dynamic power of the holy
[1:20:54] ghost in our lives to make this world
[1:20:55] live
[1:20:57] amen but the problem is people have
[1:20:59] cabbage down on ideas against the moving
[1:21:01] of the spirit
[1:21:03] and they form denominational rings
[1:21:05] around ideas you know the biggest
[1:21:07] problem you can ever do you have a list
[1:21:09] of beliefs and put a full stop at the
[1:21:10] end
[1:21:11] we want to put a comma
[1:21:13] right because none of us have a perfect
[1:21:15] understanding
[1:21:16] of of the lord
[1:21:18] hey i'll be honest i don't
[1:21:20] you know the more you think you know the
[1:21:22] less the more you realize you don't know
[1:21:24] i probably get that mixed up but you
[1:21:25] know because you realize you think oh i
[1:21:27] think i know the lord now and you do but
[1:21:28] he's got more of himself to reveal and
[1:21:31] then he's got more then he's got more
[1:21:32] than he's got more and you realize oh
[1:21:34] lord
[1:21:35] just keep pouring it in i want to know
[1:21:36] you more
[1:21:38] right but we never want to put a full
[1:21:39] stop after our after what we believe
[1:21:43] because essentially that is what a
[1:21:45] denominational idea is a full stop
[1:21:48] and we don't want to have a full stop
[1:21:50] you know brother bam says i'd rather
[1:21:52] have the right spirit and the wrong
[1:21:54] doctrine than the right doctrine in the
[1:21:56] wrong spirit because if you have the
[1:21:57] right spirit
[1:21:59] and the wrong doctrine the lord because
[1:22:00] you have the right spirit you're
[1:22:01] teachable and the lord can lead you and
[1:22:03] guide you into all truth but if you have
[1:22:05] the right spirit in the wrong doctrine
[1:22:07] no one can tell you nothing
[1:22:08] and god can't tell you nothing either so
[1:22:10] we don't want to fall into that bracket
[1:22:12] we want to be teachable to the lord
[1:22:13] because remember the law is an
[1:22:14] individual he's an individual god he
[1:22:16] wants to lead us personally guide us
[1:22:18] into all truth you know i might only
[1:22:20] know the cover
[1:22:22] remember this is this is the lord jesus
[1:22:23] christ in print form i might only know
[1:22:25] the cover or maybe the first page
[1:22:29] but there's more of truth that the
[1:22:30] lord's got to guide me through
[1:22:33] right so i'm going to say lord keep
[1:22:35] guiding me into all truth
[1:22:37] i want to know i want to know you better
[1:22:38] i want to understand you bit i want a
[1:22:40] closer walk with thee
[1:22:42] amen granted jesus is my plea
[1:22:45] amen so we don't want to ever
[1:22:48] you know but people will say but but the
[1:22:50] prophet said this message will never
[1:22:52] denominate on an age level it won't but
[1:22:54] an individual absolutely it will
[1:22:57] and it has because people
[1:22:59] uh draw boundaries
[1:23:02] and they say unless you see it my way
[1:23:04] you're not seeing it at all and you're
[1:23:05] not part of anything and that's us for
[1:23:07] no more what is that it's the same as
[1:23:09] the church in the wilderness what did
[1:23:12] the church in the wilderness israel
[1:23:14] there in the wilderness what did they
[1:23:15] experience church splits
[1:23:18] right people wanting to go back into the
[1:23:20] world
[1:23:21] amen they you know they experienced
[1:23:23] corey and dathan raising up and they
[1:23:24] said to moses you think you're the only
[1:23:26] holy one in the in the bunch you know
[1:23:29] and moses said well you know god will
[1:23:31] god will prove who's whose side is
[1:23:33] suicide you know and and he said you
[1:23:35] know if god does a new thing and swallow
[1:23:37] you up you know i mean the earth swallow
[1:23:39] you up you'll see whose side is on
[1:23:40] whosoth and the earth the world
[1:23:42] swallowed up core and dathan we've seen
[1:23:44] that happen
[1:23:45] right people come against the word you
[1:23:47] know they say this is not this is how
[1:23:49] things should be and the world swallows
[1:23:51] them up
[1:23:52] you know we've seen church splits we've
[1:23:53] seen people want to go back into the
[1:23:55] world you've seen people like balaam
[1:23:57] come and and and he caused israel and
[1:24:00] and moab to bind together for israel to
[1:24:02] worship idols we've seen all that
[1:24:04] but that's in the wilderness
[1:24:06] god was still there god was still
[1:24:08] looking after his children guiding them
[1:24:10] through the power of god was there but
[1:24:11] you know that's far different than being
[1:24:13] in the promised land actually possessing
[1:24:15] their inheritance
[1:24:16] amen and so there's a big difference
[1:24:18] between being in the wilderness
[1:24:20] and being in the promised land though
[1:24:22] both in the wilderness and the promised
[1:24:23] land they had the same priesthood they
[1:24:25] had the same word they had the same
[1:24:26] tabernacle they had all those same
[1:24:28] things but one was in the inheritance
[1:24:30] one was not
[1:24:33] so we've seen down through since the
[1:24:34] prophet's been here church splits
[1:24:36] fighting people raise up with partial
[1:24:39] truth form denominational fences around
[1:24:41] things with full stops and all its
[1:24:43] causes fighting and division
[1:24:46] just like in the wilderness
[1:24:47] people fussing at conditions trouble all
[1:24:50] those things but there has to come a
[1:24:52] time when the church crossed the bride
[1:24:54] crosses into the promised land now i'm
[1:24:56] not saying we're about to i believe
[1:24:57] we're already in
[1:24:59] right we've got to have an understanding
[1:25:00] where we have been and where we are
[1:25:03] amen because we got to realize the world
[1:25:05] is falling apart for a reason
[1:25:07] right the world is not yo there's always
[1:25:10] a new normal
[1:25:11] i wish i had a dollar for every time
[1:25:12] people say new normal i'd be a rich guy
[1:25:15] you know but the world is ordained to
[1:25:16] fall apart it's been prophesied to fall
[1:25:18] apart but the thing is god is doing it
[1:25:20] because we're coming into a different
[1:25:22] season also
[1:25:23] amen of the of the catching away of the
[1:25:25] bride but before that catching away
[1:25:28] there's going to be a people on the
[1:25:29] earth that will possess every promise i
[1:25:31] mean irrespective of their mind battles
[1:25:33] their their whatever going on their
[1:25:35] peculiarities of of humanity there'll be
[1:25:38] a people possessing every divine promise
[1:25:41] amen so you know brother brahm says here
[1:25:44] he says he says now
[1:25:46] when we stop on one evidence of speaking
[1:25:48] in tongues being the holy ghost which is
[1:25:50] all right that's true that's the
[1:25:51] evidence of the holy ghost but just look
[1:25:52] at the other things that goes in there
[1:25:54] but as soon as we did we have to
[1:25:56] denominate ourselves to keep the others
[1:25:58] out build a fence around our coconut
[1:26:00] tree that nobody else can gleam off it
[1:26:02] but us that's the reason the rest of us
[1:26:04] don't get anywhere
[1:26:06] it's our own selfish ideas instead of
[1:26:08] letting the holy ghost lead us all out
[1:26:10] and we've waited for 40 years and
[1:26:12] nothing's happened we're still you're
[1:26:14] still staying in the same place the same
[1:26:16] old thing they went around the same
[1:26:17] mountain for 40 years
[1:26:19] the lord actually said you've come past
[1:26:21] this mountain long enough but they went
[1:26:23] round and around the same old thing
[1:26:26] you know i believe this you don't
[1:26:27] believe this this is me you're wrong i'm
[1:26:29] in i'm out this is happening and winds
[1:26:31] of doctrine coming through trouble about
[1:26:33] the same old thing
[1:26:35] going in and out but that season has
[1:26:37] come to an end
[1:26:39] that season's come to an end
[1:26:42] amen
[1:26:43] now
[1:26:45] we find out they made a fatal mistake
[1:26:48] and they raised up a bunch of fighters
[1:26:50] and that's what we have a big bunch of
[1:26:51] fighters you say bless god i'm
[1:26:53] assemblies you're the oneness we won't
[1:26:55] have anything to do with you your old
[1:26:57] church of god we got it the church of
[1:26:58] god bless god we're the ones who got it
[1:27:01] we got the prophesied name the one that
[1:27:02] says we've got it because we're baptized
[1:27:04] right hallelujah you bunch of fighters
[1:27:06] god just let you sit right out there
[1:27:08] till you die that's exactly right the
[1:27:10] bible said they stayed there till the
[1:27:11] old fighters died out amen that's
[1:27:13] exactly right he let them stay right
[1:27:15] there till all the old fighters died out
[1:27:17] the bible said so those fighters
[1:27:19] fighting over their organization
[1:27:21] boundaries and don't you have no
[1:27:22] fellowship with that group that buzzard
[1:27:24] roost and this so and so as long as
[1:27:26] you've got that in your head
[1:27:28] you'll just sit right there on the
[1:27:29] mountain and starve to death i don't
[1:27:31] want to be in that category did you ever
[1:27:33] think of those people done for 40 years
[1:27:35] not even 40 days away from the promised
[1:27:37] land and god kept them there 40 years
[1:27:40] and that
[1:27:41] and that's what it was a long time ago
[1:27:44] but the same thing has happened today
[1:27:45] you know people you know people drew
[1:27:47] fences around the seventh hills openers
[1:27:50] or or it's closed don't talk to those
[1:27:52] group they're not seeing it they're the
[1:27:53] fullest virgin we're the wise virgin
[1:27:54] stay away from them you know then people
[1:27:56] drew fences around the gifts not needing
[1:27:58] to be operated in the church no more
[1:28:01] i believe the gift should be in the
[1:28:02] church i don't believe in taking twink
[1:28:04] and whiting out the word
[1:28:07] why you know why why why rob ourselves
[1:28:09] from the power of god
[1:28:11] i mean people drew themselves around you
[1:28:14] know the thunders or the perugia
[1:28:15] different specialty doctrines have risen
[1:28:17] up that point just to a man instead of
[1:28:18] the word of god you know that no one
[1:28:20] should preach anymore the ministry
[1:28:22] should just be playing tapes they put a
[1:28:23] full stop behind it and you know what's
[1:28:25] that people building fences
[1:28:27] i've got my coconut tree don't let
[1:28:29] anyone else
[1:28:30] have anything off it
[1:28:32] and what's happened is people get stuck
[1:28:34] in that kind of condition
[1:28:36] but those days have come to an end
[1:28:38] i mean we're not living in that kind of
[1:28:40] day we're living in a day where every
[1:28:41] divine promise
[1:28:43] amen is ours to take the land is good
[1:28:46] amen as sweet as honey hallelujah the
[1:28:48] grapes are great amen all the blessings
[1:28:50] are tremendous amen there's an
[1:28:52] inheritance in us for in the word of god
[1:28:55] not just to sit in the wilderness you
[1:28:57] know brother chris says he doesn't like
[1:28:59] sand and you know i wouldn't like to be
[1:29:00] in a desert either
[1:29:02] you know
[1:29:03] i'm not saying you are but yeah who
[1:29:04] likes sand
[1:29:05] i'm not a dip maybe i'm used to new
[1:29:07] zealand i like green and you know lush
[1:29:09] things and you know maybe sand on the
[1:29:11] beaches all right but just there i
[1:29:13] wouldn't want to live and just look
[1:29:14] around and see sand all day
[1:29:16] we're living in a different place see
[1:29:18] they put a full stop behind us but you
[1:29:20] see god brought them to a stage just
[1:29:22] like israel says now you've been given a
[1:29:24] heart to perceive
[1:29:26] so now you can look beyond all these
[1:29:28] fusses and fights and and ring fencing
[1:29:30] and don't talk to this group in this
[1:29:32] group it's more than that
[1:29:34] it's now we're going to cross the land
[1:29:35] let's put aside all those things you
[1:29:37] know i could be a denomination in myself
[1:29:40] let's put a full stop i could be let's i
[1:29:42] mean let's be honest people people do
[1:29:44] that it's not just a church or a
[1:29:45] movement or no you can be a denomination
[1:29:47] in yourself
[1:29:49] you know this is what the message is
[1:29:50] full stop no no comma and whatever god
[1:29:52] will add or take away i'm happy with
[1:29:54] that
[1:29:55] as long as he's leading i mean so
[1:29:58] you know we never ever want to
[1:30:01] see because the fruit of this is
[1:30:03] the power of god isn't there to save
[1:30:05] souls
[1:30:06] the power of god is not there that we
[1:30:07] grow in our christian walk
[1:30:09] yes you know the power of god does not
[1:30:11] cause us to grow
[1:30:13] in the lord jesus
[1:30:15] we want to grow amen we want to see the
[1:30:18] power of god save souls i mean we want
[1:30:20] to see the manifestation of the gifts of
[1:30:22] the spirit people say oh we don't need
[1:30:24] that no more we need it
[1:30:26] we need god to manifest himself not just
[1:30:28] in preaching not just in wisdom i mean
[1:30:29] but in discernment tongues prophecy
[1:30:32] speaking in tongues whatever it is i
[1:30:33] mean discernment amen helps whatever it
[1:30:36] is i want to see all of god manifested i
[1:30:38] don't just want an arm i don't just want
[1:30:40] to i want the whole body
[1:30:43] amen so we must never put a full stop
[1:30:45] after what we believe
[1:30:49] amen
[1:30:50] you know people would put a fence around
[1:30:52] oh the mystery of the baptism of holy
[1:30:54] ghost without sensation but that's not
[1:30:56] the whole quote
[1:30:57] but the person of christ performing in
[1:30:59] you the same works that he did i mean so
[1:31:02] he cast out devils that work should be
[1:31:04] in you amen he healed the sick that work
[1:31:07] should be in you he raised the dead that
[1:31:09] work should be in you amen he he leap
[1:31:12] for joy and rejoice that work should be
[1:31:14] in you he was led by the spirit of god
[1:31:17] that work she definitely should be in
[1:31:18] you amen he surrendered himself to the
[1:31:21] father's will that work should be in you
[1:31:23] and i am amen well are you saying we
[1:31:25] should go to a graveyard try and raise
[1:31:27] the dead and no no as the lord brings it
[1:31:29] across your path
[1:31:31] amen the lord will anoint you no and i
[1:31:33] believe it will happen
[1:31:35] just like healing or anything amen
[1:31:37] but you know so we don't want to just
[1:31:39] put a full stop behind anything we want
[1:31:40] to keep growing
[1:31:42] amen because we know the baptism of the
[1:31:44] holy ghost is a definite experience
[1:31:47] where you can look back and something
[1:31:48] happened in your life you're now now a
[1:31:50] different person
[1:31:51] amen so
[1:31:53] the apostle paul would say in hebrews 3
[1:31:55] or 4 we read there they couldn't enter
[1:31:57] into the promised land because of
[1:31:58] unbelief
[1:32:00] so they had to believe themselves they
[1:32:01] had to come a faith into their hearts
[1:32:03] amen and i believe that we have come to
[1:32:06] that place where there's now a faith in
[1:32:08] our hearts god is more than able
[1:32:11] i mean we're not interested in in in
[1:32:13] church brands fussing fighting what do
[1:32:15] they believe we believe different trying
[1:32:17] to find points of difference we're not
[1:32:19] interested in that because because if
[1:32:21] we're honest if we sat down long enough
[1:32:23] one-on-one we'll have an in we'll have a
[1:32:25] point of difference
[1:32:27] you get you can you can split it down to
[1:32:29] very fine things oh no they believe
[1:32:31] different than me
[1:32:32] of course because we're all maturing
[1:32:34] we're all growing
[1:32:35] right the lord reveals something to you
[1:32:38] but he may not reveal it to me until
[1:32:40] later
[1:32:41] that doesn't mean you're wrong doesn't
[1:32:42] mean i'm right doesn't mean you're right
[1:32:43] doesn't mean i'm wrong
[1:32:44] right god reveals his word sovereignly
[1:32:46] to us as we walk with him
[1:32:49] amen so
[1:32:51] the wilderness as i said is it it's it's
[1:32:53] symbolic
[1:32:55] of the time when a believer is
[1:32:57] sanctified from the world but it's also
[1:33:00] the legalistic time in a believer's walk
[1:33:03] and i believe well i pray when we talk
[1:33:06] about this you say thank god i'm not
[1:33:07] that guy anymore
[1:33:09] because we have all had this walk
[1:33:11] i mean i mean this time in our walk
[1:33:13] which is a legalistic time
[1:33:15] now
[1:33:16] that's where people try and please the
[1:33:18] lord in their own strength they try and
[1:33:20] bring everything they've got to the
[1:33:21] table say lord you're obligated to me
[1:33:23] because i've done such and such but we
[1:33:25] know that you know
[1:33:27] serving god or actually trying to get
[1:33:29] the blessings of god is not like a a
[1:33:31] reward card from a cafe
[1:33:34] you know i've done such and such god so
[1:33:36] therefore you're obligated to heal me
[1:33:38] well i've done such and such and such
[1:33:39] i've prayed this long god listened to
[1:33:40] this much gone to church this myself or
[1:33:42] you've got to save my loved ones it
[1:33:44] doesn't work that way it's not a reward
[1:33:46] system
[1:33:47] right it's god's sovereign grace
[1:33:50] amen so now
[1:33:52] you know so in the wilderness as i said
[1:33:55] i mean there's a big difference between
[1:33:56] being in the wilderness and being in the
[1:33:58] promised land
[1:34:00] though it can look similar as i said
[1:34:02] because they had the same tabernacle
[1:34:03] they had the same worship they had the
[1:34:04] same word they were the same people but
[1:34:06] the conditions were very different
[1:34:09] now
[1:34:11] there's a massive difference between a
[1:34:13] person who's really crossed jordan
[1:34:15] entered into rest really met the lord
[1:34:17] and those who have not now as i said in
[1:34:19] the beginning the true rest is receiving
[1:34:21] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:34:23] amen and it's not just being anointed by
[1:34:26] the holy ghost but the holy ghost
[1:34:28] himself continually dwelling in you
[1:34:31] see it's easy see it's and it's not
[1:34:33] shown by how a person acts in church in
[1:34:35] the presence of god hey when god comes
[1:34:37] down a powerful way we can all raise our
[1:34:38] hands and shout and scream and give him
[1:34:40] praise
[1:34:41] right but that's not proven in that
[1:34:43] moment if you have the holy ghost or not
[1:34:45] it's proven in your everyday life
[1:34:48] right it's how we are
[1:34:50] how our character is how we treat one
[1:34:52] another the things we do afterwards
[1:34:54] that's the proof of the pudding
[1:34:57] amen it's the it's who you are
[1:34:59] afterwards that counts
[1:35:01] it's not who you are hey we can have
[1:35:03] camp and we always have an awesome camp
[1:35:04] don't we yeah like that sunday night at
[1:35:06] camp i thought well we're going in a
[1:35:07] rapture now you know such an incredible
[1:35:09] powerful anointing there it's easy to
[1:35:11] praise god and be a christian in that
[1:35:13] kind of atmosphere at camp you have no
[1:35:15] struggles you've got no temptation
[1:35:16] there's no trouble there it's just like
[1:35:17] heaven on earth but that doesn't prove
[1:35:19] what you are it's when you we go out
[1:35:21] into the world go back to everyday life
[1:35:23] go back to school go back to our job
[1:35:24] whatever it is that really proves what
[1:35:27] we are
[1:35:28] it's the afterwards that counts
[1:35:30] i mean so this younger generation had to
[1:35:33] cross the jordan and go into the
[1:35:35] promised land and so they had to leave
[1:35:37] legalism and go into the baptism of the
[1:35:40] holy ghost that god would really
[1:35:41] manifest the word in their lives see
[1:35:44] legalism
[1:35:45] to me it's a pulling or pushing people
[1:35:47] down
[1:35:48] there's no grace in it because if grace
[1:35:50] has truly been imparted grace can be
[1:35:52] extended
[1:35:53] right so the so forgiveness has been has
[1:35:56] been imparted it can be extended
[1:35:58] right but great but legalism always
[1:36:00] tries to pull or push someone down you
[1:36:02] know the tall poppy syndrome of new
[1:36:04] zealand is such a curse
[1:36:07] and and and and it weeds into legalistic
[1:36:09] believers so good and even liberal ones
[1:36:12] too
[1:36:13] where someone a gift starts to manifest
[1:36:15] in someone's life and because it's not
[1:36:17] them
[1:36:18] yeah you know they want to cut that
[1:36:20] person down
[1:36:21] i say let everything bloom
[1:36:24] let it bloom hallelujah let everyone
[1:36:26] come to their full position in christ
[1:36:28] let every gift have its way if it's
[1:36:30] singing musicians
[1:36:32] prayer warriors deacons whatever it is
[1:36:34] helps government sunday school teachers
[1:36:36] just let it come to its floor let it let
[1:36:38] it mature and grow to its full extent
[1:36:41] you know i don't want a bunch of stunted
[1:36:43] kind of you know a garden i want to grow
[1:36:45] fully right
[1:36:46] you know you're never happy when you go
[1:36:48] out to your strawberry plant and you got
[1:36:49] these little withered strawberries and
[1:36:51] you know you want to grow in its
[1:36:52] fullness you want to help that plant
[1:36:54] grow because you want to have the fruit
[1:36:56] right it should be the same thing with
[1:36:57] you and i we want to see the fruit of
[1:36:59] god manifested
[1:37:01] amen so
[1:37:02] it's a it's a pulling or pushing you
[1:37:04] know it's criticism
[1:37:07] some people say i'm just being
[1:37:08] discerning now often people are just
[1:37:09] critical
[1:37:10] because discernment doesn't just show
[1:37:12] the problem that shows the solution to
[1:37:14] the problem
[1:37:15] hallelujah and that's the thing but to
[1:37:16] be critical it's easy i mean i've given
[1:37:18] you probably so much material right now
[1:37:20] to criticize me
[1:37:22] and that's why just me walking here
[1:37:24] you know so it's not being we want to be
[1:37:27] discerning
[1:37:29] that the lord gives us and you say well
[1:37:30] i don't have the answer pray
[1:37:32] amen prayer is the greatest prayer
[1:37:35] changes things
[1:37:36] prayer changes things more than we
[1:37:38] realize people say oh i've got to go
[1:37:39] sort that out no
[1:37:40] has had the lord has the lord shown you
[1:37:42] how to sort it out
[1:37:44] and is it is it is it if it's summarized
[1:37:46] then i'm going to deal with this person
[1:37:47] i'm going to put them in their place
[1:37:48] that's not the lord sorting it out
[1:37:51] right judgmental attitudes that's
[1:37:53] legalistic
[1:37:55] we don't ever want to have a judgmental
[1:37:56] attitude
[1:37:58] condescending looks and comments
[1:38:00] that's legalistic because remember legal
[1:38:02] is like the pharisees they want and the
[1:38:04] well you know they wanted to look
[1:38:06] because they you know they dressed in
[1:38:07] all the great robes they outwardly
[1:38:09] publicly they prayed so prayed so nice
[1:38:11] and did things they wanted to look the
[1:38:13] best
[1:38:14] and that's a legalistic attitude
[1:38:17] you know judging by appearance and not
[1:38:19] by righteous judgment
[1:38:21] jesus said don't judge by their parents
[1:38:22] but judge righteous judgment you've got
[1:38:24] to look beyond what you see with your
[1:38:26] eyes
[1:38:27] i mean so those kind of things
[1:38:30] those kind of things is a legalistic way
[1:38:33] where people think because they they
[1:38:35] they adhere to certain parts of the word
[1:38:37] then therefore they have a right that
[1:38:39] you know they've arrived
[1:38:41] but if the lord comes into your life
[1:38:43] it's not you trying to appear to the
[1:38:45] word it's the lord adhering to the word
[1:38:47] in you
[1:38:49] right
[1:38:50] you know it's if you surrender to him he
[1:38:52] changes you
[1:38:54] he's the christian in you
[1:38:56] do you no i hope that's not a vague
[1:38:58] thing you know it may be once upon a
[1:39:00] time when in your legalistic stage you
[1:39:01] had to keep yourself from things
[1:39:04] right because you know but when the when
[1:39:05] you really enter into rest you can be
[1:39:08] around that same thing but it doesn't
[1:39:09] bother you no more
[1:39:11] well it's happened it's not you trying
[1:39:12] to keep yourself from it as i've said
[1:39:14] you know i used to you know make home
[1:39:17] brew i used to drink a lot and stuff but
[1:39:19] you know when the lord took that desire
[1:39:20] out of my life i could live in a brewery
[1:39:22] and i'd be the most sober man in the
[1:39:23] world because there's nothing in me that
[1:39:25] wants it anymore and it wasn't and it
[1:39:27] wasn't me being told thou shall not thou
[1:39:29] shall not i was just like lord whatever
[1:39:31] is because i knew i didn't have the holy
[1:39:33] ghost at that stage i said lord
[1:39:34] whatever's contrary to your word and me
[1:39:36] take it from me so you can come and
[1:39:38] dwell on me and then so the lord said
[1:39:39] okay i'll rearrange what i want because
[1:39:41] i want to dwell on you
[1:39:43] amen so we don't want to have a
[1:39:45] judgmental attitude condescending looks
[1:39:47] and comments you know we should never
[1:39:49] ever want to be just the ambulance at
[1:39:51] the bottom of the cliff
[1:39:53] that is a legalistic attitude you know
[1:39:56] where where where you want to push the
[1:39:58] person off the cliff because you're
[1:39:59] annoyed at them
[1:40:00] and you're actually silently happy that
[1:40:02] they fall but now you're going to come
[1:40:04] along and pray for them and help them
[1:40:05] with the bottom of the cliff
[1:40:06] we never want to get to that that that
[1:40:08] is a legalistic attitude where we're
[1:40:10] actually people get happy when other
[1:40:12] people fall
[1:40:14] that's crazy
[1:40:15] that's crazy because remember whatever
[1:40:17] you give out you'll receive
[1:40:19] i mean like the book of proverbs i think
[1:40:20] says are they that dig a hole or a ditch
[1:40:22] they'll fall into it
[1:40:23] i mean so we don't want to be the
[1:40:26] ambulance at the bottom of the cliff for
[1:40:27] anyone i mean we want to be at the top
[1:40:29] of the cliff we're going to be abseiling
[1:40:31] down if they go down the cliff we're
[1:40:32] going to go with them not in sin but we
[1:40:34] want to be there to try and bring them
[1:40:35] back up again
[1:40:37] amen that's what we want to do so but as
[1:40:39] i said grace can only be extended when
[1:40:41] it's been truly received
[1:40:43] if it has not been ex if it has not been
[1:40:46] ext received it cannot be extended
[1:40:49] right so but criticism can be freely
[1:40:52] given
[1:40:54] you know
[1:40:56] if someone is climbing if someone
[1:40:58] started their walk they may have just
[1:41:00] stumbled in here and they've started i
[1:41:01] want to be a christian yeah we don't
[1:41:02] want to push someone down
[1:41:04] you know if someone is you know you're
[1:41:06] climbing up jacob's ladder you know
[1:41:08] because it's from earth to glory
[1:41:10] brother braham says we climb up that
[1:41:12] ladder it was hooked on christ the
[1:41:13] others in heaven and we're going up the
[1:41:15] highway going up the ladder into glory
[1:41:17] right if someone is climbing up under
[1:41:20] you
[1:41:21] a legalistic person will try and put
[1:41:22] their foot on their head and push them
[1:41:24] back down
[1:41:25] because they're doing wrong things down
[1:41:26] there but no someone who really knows
[1:41:28] the lord will reach down and say come up
[1:41:30] the ears better up here
[1:41:32] come up where i am and don't just come
[1:41:34] where i am let me help you push you up a
[1:41:36] bit more
[1:41:37] hallelujah that's how we should be that
[1:41:39] should be our attitude
[1:41:41] [Music]
[1:41:43] amen
[1:41:44] see
[1:41:45] the same the same journey is actually um
[1:41:48] shown in the book of ruth
[1:41:51] where
[1:41:52] where ruth starts where she decides to
[1:41:54] follow her her mother-in-law naomi back
[1:41:56] to the promised land
[1:41:57] but then she comes into a stage where
[1:41:59] she's got to work in the field trying to
[1:42:01] find you know little bits of grain just
[1:42:04] to just to survive there's four stages
[1:42:06] of her journey ruth deciding
[1:42:09] ruth working
[1:42:10] then ruth resting at the threshing floor
[1:42:13] and then ruth being rewarded
[1:42:15] but the legalistic one of ruth working
[1:42:17] in the field
[1:42:19] that can be a bit where i can say in an
[1:42:21] age level a lot of the church has been
[1:42:23] stuck there
[1:42:26] but we have come to it but you but the
[1:42:27] thing is so she had to do work she
[1:42:29] became a legalist she was working in the
[1:42:32] field we know the field is is the word
[1:42:34] of god
[1:42:35] right and she was just trying to get a
[1:42:37] few handfuls because the gl you know she
[1:42:39] was just gleaning in the field and she's
[1:42:41] just trying to pick up a few promises to
[1:42:43] take it back to her mother-in-law just
[1:42:45] for them to survive on
[1:42:47] and that's someone who is who is just in
[1:42:49] a legalistic framework they haven't
[1:42:51] entered into rest yet there's only maybe
[1:42:53] one or two promises that they just pick
[1:42:54] up and they're holding but
[1:42:57] you know we are told to stay in the
[1:42:58] field which is the word of god
[1:43:00] right but the thing is
[1:43:02] the thing is once she married boaz
[1:43:05] she was she wasn't just living off a few
[1:43:08] grains that had fallen on the field she
[1:43:09] was living on the whole field because
[1:43:11] that field was now hers
[1:43:13] right it was now her possession because
[1:43:15] it was her husband's possession so it's
[1:43:18] like someone who hasn't entered into
[1:43:19] rest yet they are clutching a few
[1:43:21] promises trying to survive amen but
[1:43:24] those who truly enter into rest are
[1:43:26] living off the whole field amen amen
[1:43:28] that whole field is their possession the
[1:43:30] whole word of god is there are you all
[1:43:32] following me right so maybe maybe the
[1:43:34] only promises they have is well god sent
[1:43:35] a prophet long hair long skirts long
[1:43:38] faces
[1:43:39] you know that's you know and they're
[1:43:41] just living off this and if no one
[1:43:43] listens to you no one tally's up to what
[1:43:45] they think they're they're not even in
[1:43:46] the field but once you once you actually
[1:43:49] get married to boaz the lord jesus
[1:43:51] christ the whole field falls into your
[1:43:53] possession and now you're living off
[1:43:55] genesis to revelation amen you've got
[1:43:57] the joy of the lord you've got
[1:43:58] everything that he has is now in your
[1:44:00] possession hallelujah so she wasn't she
[1:44:03] didn't have to go out in the field and
[1:44:04] just try and hold on to a few promises
[1:44:06] every promise was in her was at her
[1:44:08] fingertips
[1:44:10] hallelujah
[1:44:12] amen so she had now access to the whole
[1:44:14] harvest
[1:44:15] once she married the lord of the harvest
[1:44:18] amen
[1:44:20] hallelujah but you see now
[1:44:24] when when when israel came to
[1:44:27] uh when israel came to the river jordan
[1:44:29] under joshua
[1:44:31] the priests would take the ark and they
[1:44:33] walked into the jordan and at that time
[1:44:35] of year was it was the jordan was
[1:44:37] flooding but the but the priest carried
[1:44:39] the ark into the jordan and the and the
[1:44:42] river parted
[1:44:43] right and it was like dry ground
[1:44:45] now
[1:44:46] everyone knew where to cross
[1:44:49] but they had to cross
[1:44:50] right they had to physically cross now
[1:44:53] jordan we know represents a death to
[1:44:56] self
[1:44:57] in order to cross over into the promised
[1:44:58] land you've got to die out to
[1:45:00] everything of your life good and bad
[1:45:04] ugly and different whatever it is you
[1:45:05] got to fully die out you got to open
[1:45:07] yeah just like brother ram said you know
[1:45:09] there's there's many parts of your heart
[1:45:11] you've got to open it up
[1:45:13] private life
[1:45:15] what you believe selfishness pride
[1:45:17] whatever it may be every part of your
[1:45:19] life you've got to open it and say lord
[1:45:21] take all of me
[1:45:22] you know and and that's a true death to
[1:45:24] self when you're willing to let him be
[1:45:26] lord over every aspect of your life
[1:45:29] so they saw where the where the where
[1:45:31] the priests had you know were standing
[1:45:33] they saw where to cross but they had to
[1:45:35] cross
[1:45:36] now
[1:45:37] to cross you've got to pray pray through
[1:45:39] and die out because we've seen we've
[1:45:40] seen the word part the jordan haven't we
[1:45:43] amen we're you know we've had a prophet
[1:45:45] come in this day the ark is being placed
[1:45:47] there in the river jordan there's now a
[1:45:49] way to go through a death to self into
[1:45:51] the promised land right repent be
[1:45:53] baptized name the lord jesus christ you
[1:45:54] shall receive the gift of the holy ghost
[1:45:57] amen so now they had to cross
[1:46:00] and once they crossed they were living
[1:46:03] they were living off the the corn and
[1:46:06] everything of the land they weren't
[1:46:07] living off the manor anymore
[1:46:09] so they were feeding so so they are now
[1:46:11] living off the evidence of the land
[1:46:14] right brother bam says improving his
[1:46:15] word don't you see in shadow stop here
[1:46:17] for a minute in the last days there's
[1:46:19] got to be a place prepared for the word
[1:46:20] to be made manifest we're now living by
[1:46:22] the evidence of the new land amen the
[1:46:25] son of man so now the land we know is
[1:46:28] the holy ghost which is the lord jesus
[1:46:29] christ
[1:46:30] so now the believer that crosses over
[1:46:33] jordan is now living off i mean the word
[1:46:36] himself
[1:46:37] where it's no longer living in the
[1:46:38] wilderness and criticism splits in
[1:46:40] trouble and fussing and fighting and
[1:46:42] inward looking and you know because all
[1:46:44] most of the trials they had in the
[1:46:46] wilderness was inward-looking
[1:46:48] core and dathan raised up inward looking
[1:46:50] you know they were yo we don't have
[1:46:52] water we don't have this there's all
[1:46:53] trouble that was within most of it
[1:46:55] i mean but then once the people actually
[1:46:57] rose up on faith they said we can take
[1:46:59] the land their enemies were without
[1:47:01] and they went and possessed possess
[1:47:03] their land so if you're always looking
[1:47:05] at inward trouble you've got to cross
[1:47:07] jordan
[1:47:08] right because because our purpose should
[1:47:10] be every divine promise i want it
[1:47:13] right healing is wonderful i want more i
[1:47:16] want salvation for my family i mean i
[1:47:18] want to be positively placed in in my
[1:47:20] inheritance amen i want i want all that
[1:47:23] god has i want a peace that passes
[1:47:24] understanding it's all in the land a joy
[1:47:26] unspeakable full of glory in the land i
[1:47:29] mean speaking of speaking in tongues is
[1:47:31] in the land interpretations in the land
[1:47:33] prophecy is in the land the sermons and
[1:47:35] the land aiming gifts of knowledge are
[1:47:37] in the land healing the raptures in the
[1:47:39] land
[1:47:40] amen the dead in christ rising that's
[1:47:42] all in the land and we want all those
[1:47:43] things to live you know but the problem
[1:47:45] is with a legalistic idea is people
[1:47:47] aren't willing to let god have his way
[1:47:50] and that's been the biggest problem see
[1:47:52] people always have used an excuse of
[1:47:54] what pentecost has made with the gifts
[1:47:56] and swung the other way because they
[1:47:58] don't want that in their church but
[1:47:59] that's an excuse to me because really
[1:48:02] what it is that's just a scarecrow but
[1:48:04] people are afraid to let go and let god
[1:48:06] have his way they're actually afraid to
[1:48:09] surrender and let the holy ghost move
[1:48:11] through them and do what he wants to do
[1:48:14] amen but we should never
[1:48:16] get in that position i may stay there's
[1:48:18] a bit of a stinger but you know if
[1:48:20] you're not in the land that's how you'll
[1:48:22] be you want to control
[1:48:24] you can have the church order everything
[1:48:26] right but if you're in the wilderness
[1:48:28] you want control
[1:48:30] and i'll show this because you know
[1:48:32] there is there is um a couple of tribes
[1:48:34] that did not cross jordan
[1:48:37] and and it's here in numbers 32 um
[1:48:41] there's the children of reuben the
[1:48:43] children of gad and half the tribe of
[1:48:45] manasseh they did not go over jordan to
[1:48:48] actually dwell in the promised land
[1:48:50] and the reason they did this is because
[1:48:52] they had very much cattle and the land
[1:48:54] that they were now in had
[1:48:56] was perfect for cattle so they wanted to
[1:48:58] take what they had in the wilderness
[1:49:00] with them into the promised land that's
[1:49:02] a mistake
[1:49:03] we can't take our old life with us
[1:49:06] we can't bring it in it's got we've got
[1:49:07] to die out to the whole thing
[1:49:09] and then the and then the um
[1:49:12] elders of these tribes they went and
[1:49:13] spoke to moses
[1:49:15] and said and said we want to stay here
[1:49:18] because it's a land for cattle and we
[1:49:19] have cattle
[1:49:20] now moses moses was upset with them
[1:49:24] because he said that this is what your
[1:49:27] fathers did
[1:49:28] when i sat there from kadesh bania to
[1:49:30] see the land so he's actually
[1:49:32] identifying the spirit that was in their
[1:49:34] forebears that caused them not to cross
[1:49:36] the land was now manifesting through the
[1:49:38] younger generation and that's why they
[1:49:41] did not actually want to go into the
[1:49:43] promised land he says numbers 32 and 8
[1:49:46] you don't have to put it up but you can
[1:49:47] read numbers 32 to see this whole story
[1:49:48] but at the same time we won't read it he
[1:49:50] said thus did your fathers when i sit
[1:49:52] there from katy spania to see the land
[1:49:55] and he says the numbers 32 14 and behold
[1:49:57] you are risen up in your father's dead
[1:49:59] an increase of sinful men to to augment
[1:50:02] yet the fierce anger of the lord towards
[1:50:05] israel
[1:50:06] so moses was identifying a spirit that
[1:50:09] was in the previous generation was still
[1:50:11] because the problem is
[1:50:12] people die spirits don't die
[1:50:15] and we don't want to just inherit what
[1:50:17] our forebears have done hey there's a
[1:50:18] lot of good what they've done nothing do
[1:50:20] we understand what spin gets their
[1:50:21] previous generation know do we
[1:50:22] understand this i'm not putting them
[1:50:24] anywhere but i'm just saying we're in a
[1:50:25] different season but we don't want to
[1:50:27] continue on in the wilderness we want to
[1:50:29] go over the river jordan into the
[1:50:32] promised land so now
[1:50:34] the lord was
[1:50:35] moses was identifying that the same
[1:50:38] spirit and the spies that said we can't
[1:50:40] take the land that spirit of unbelief
[1:50:42] was now in these tribes and that's why
[1:50:43] they want to stay on the wrong side of
[1:50:45] jordan now
[1:50:47] it's amazing when you come down however
[1:50:49] many
[1:50:50] hundreds of years after this fact
[1:50:53] and jesus was crossing
[1:50:55] the sea of galilee
[1:50:57] he went from the western side to the
[1:51:00] eastern side
[1:51:01] and there was a man there that we call
[1:51:04] legion
[1:51:05] who was full of devils
[1:51:07] and and and he lived in the tombs and he
[1:51:10] cut himself crying out he was he was he
[1:51:12] was possessed by demons legions of
[1:51:15] demons
[1:51:16] and there were hog raises in the in the
[1:51:18] land there that were that were believers
[1:51:23] but then what happened is when jesus
[1:51:24] crossed the sea because he knew there
[1:51:26] was one soul crying out in that place
[1:51:28] for deliverance
[1:51:29] and if there's one soul crying out for
[1:51:31] deliverance jesus will cross the world
[1:51:33] amen to to find that one soul and he
[1:51:36] won't leave them bound he'll loose them
[1:51:38] amen because if there's a cry in here
[1:51:40] there's there's one to answer that cry
[1:51:43] and so now jesus cross crossed the sea
[1:51:45] and then this maniac came out of the
[1:51:47] tombs and then so jesus would speak to
[1:51:50] him and he commanded the devils to come
[1:51:52] out
[1:51:53] and then the devil said well can we go
[1:51:55] into those that herd of swine because
[1:51:57] the devils want to you know god has to
[1:51:58] work through people and the devil will
[1:52:00] work through anything right he's got to
[1:52:02] have a host too too to inhabit and then
[1:52:05] so the lord consented to these to these
[1:52:08] to these devils to go into these pigs
[1:52:11] right and so the devils went into the
[1:52:13] pigs and the pigs wouldn't drown
[1:52:14] themselves in the sea
[1:52:16] and then now the farmers of these pigs
[1:52:18] saw this whole thing go on so they saw
[1:52:21] legion be delivered then they saw their
[1:52:23] pigs run down and drown themselves and
[1:52:25] they ran back into the city saying this
[1:52:27] is what's going on and then they came
[1:52:29] back out and they saw legion who they
[1:52:31] had known used to be naked in the tombs
[1:52:33] cutting himself attacking people bound
[1:52:35] with chains he would break them and all
[1:52:37] those things he saw this they saw this
[1:52:39] man
[1:52:40] clothed sitting in the feet of jesus in
[1:52:42] his right mind
[1:52:44] no you would think that would cause them
[1:52:46] to rejoice and you would think that they
[1:52:49] would that would cause them to say jesus
[1:52:51] can you just stay here
[1:52:54] we won't let you go stay here we've got
[1:52:55] more sick we've got more troubles here
[1:52:57] you know you've you've healed this one
[1:52:59] he was an impossible case we all gave
[1:53:01] him up we had to kick him out of the
[1:53:03] church trouble he was too much we
[1:53:04] couldn't help him we didn't have what we
[1:53:06] needed to help him and joe he was a good
[1:53:08] man once upon a time but we just
[1:53:10] couldn't you know we had to he just it
[1:53:12] was too much trouble but now you've set
[1:53:14] him free so please stay here because
[1:53:16] we've got cases that aren't as bad as
[1:53:18] this
[1:53:19] but that wasn't there that wasn't their
[1:53:21] attitude they actually asked jesus
[1:53:23] please leave
[1:53:25] please leave
[1:53:28] what was what was the problem they
[1:53:30] valued their hogs
[1:53:32] at a greater value
[1:53:34] than the lord delivering someone
[1:53:36] they would rather have kept their
[1:53:38] economic system and how their church ran
[1:53:40] are you with me i mean you know they'd
[1:53:42] rather have someone in their church
[1:53:44] demon possessed and bound in trouble
[1:53:46] then jesus come in and change the whole
[1:53:48] picture and the reason they didn't want
[1:53:50] it is because it was outside of their
[1:53:52] control
[1:53:54] as i said you go into the promised land
[1:53:57] your life is no longer under your
[1:53:58] control
[1:54:00] and if you're in the wilderness i'll say
[1:54:02] people in the wilderness want to keep
[1:54:03] control of the holy ghost
[1:54:05] and the bible says quench not the spirit
[1:54:07] so we can't quench the spirit
[1:54:09] right and because of church order and
[1:54:11] trying to keep things
[1:54:13] you know how they think it should be
[1:54:15] people quench the spirit away from god
[1:54:17] actually working in the church now i'm
[1:54:18] not talking about how i'm talking about
[1:54:19] on age level right but we've gone past
[1:54:21] that
[1:54:23] amen so
[1:54:26] i would never so to me that's one of the
[1:54:28] hallmarks of someone who has not crossed
[1:54:29] jordan because remember um
[1:54:32] ghidara that place where that man was if
[1:54:35] i said it right is on the east side
[1:54:38] of jordan it's on the wrong side of
[1:54:40] jordan
[1:54:41] right it's not in the promised land it's
[1:54:42] in the wilderness and to me that's a
[1:54:44] hallmark of someone who's not across
[1:54:46] jordan as they're just like those hog
[1:54:48] races they're happy with the status quo
[1:54:51] of of people being in church hurting
[1:54:53] tormented and they're not happy when the
[1:54:55] law comes in and answers the bitter cry
[1:54:56] of someone for deliverance
[1:54:58] because that person's down there and i'm
[1:55:01] up here
[1:55:02] and they want to keep that person down
[1:55:03] there because i'm better than them
[1:55:06] god help us may we never ever get to
[1:55:08] that place where would rather leave
[1:55:11] someone in their pain
[1:55:13] amen than actually see them
[1:55:16] delivered but i'm persuaded we're living
[1:55:19] in a different season
[1:55:21] i'm persuaded we are not like
[1:55:23] we are not like those hog raisers there
[1:55:26] i'm persuaded that we are like
[1:55:28] the samaritans where when the woman at
[1:55:30] the well came running into them come see
[1:55:32] a man who's told me all i've ever did
[1:55:34] this is not the messiah
[1:55:35] and then they begin to believe on him
[1:55:38] not because of what jesus said but
[1:55:39] because of what he has said to to them
[1:55:42] amen i believe we are we are those kind
[1:55:44] of people where we don't just want to
[1:55:46] keep a status quo but we want to see god
[1:55:48] live
[1:55:49] i mean we don't want to see people just
[1:55:51] push down oh that's a teenager there's a
[1:55:52] young person oh that's an old bob yeah
[1:55:54] they're just stuck in their ways we
[1:55:55] don't want to have that attitude towards
[1:55:57] anyone i mean but we want to have such a
[1:55:59] such a burden
[1:56:01] lord jesus is more of the promised land
[1:56:02] for me and i believe there's more of the
[1:56:04] promised land for them hallelujah and
[1:56:06] let's take our swords amen let's possess
[1:56:09] every promise let's see god live like
[1:56:11] never before amen that's how he should
[1:56:13] i'll say if you've been around the
[1:56:15] mountain
[1:56:16] you've been around it long enough turn
[1:56:18] northward as the word says cross jordan
[1:56:22] amen and live off the goodness of the
[1:56:24] land the baptism of the holy ghost amen
[1:56:26] because every promise of god is in that
[1:56:29] land
[1:56:30] every promise
[1:56:32] and every promise of god we have fallen
[1:56:34] here to because we're joint is with

[1:56:44] and if you're in the land there's more
[1:56:45] to possess

[1:56:53] called just a coast we're called to grow

[1:57:10] jesus said be perfect as my father in
[1:57:12] heaven is perfect
[1:57:13] well the only way we can become perfect
[1:57:15] is because he gave a perfect sacrifice
[1:57:17] to make us perfect

[1:57:22] but i just want to say friends we are
[1:57:24] living in a different season we're not
