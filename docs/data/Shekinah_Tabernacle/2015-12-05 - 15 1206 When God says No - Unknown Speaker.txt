========================================

foreign thank you everyone welcome to the house of God um let's um let's just start this morning by inviting the Lord to be here and to ensure that we um that something is achieved because we we many people meet a lot of times in groups all over the world all the time but meeting with the Lord is very different and and that's really what we want to be doing this morning is meeting with the Lord and to have him change us and mold us and make us encourage us strengthen us and that we could become more like him so let's just um come up this time of worship to the Lord this morning and the word and everything that would happen here Heavenly Father we're happy once again that we can come into your house and that that we've dedicated this place set it at the side for you and we meet here at the certain time lord just for our human Logistics it all works to meet here at this time Lord but we've put all these mechanics in to have everything ready and to to do it all a certain way Lord but the the main thing Lord is that you would come in our midst Lord and bring the Dynamics bring the the life to this whole operation Lord if we if we just meet without you lord it's all in vain Lord we we know the scripture Lord that even if we labor Lord if you're not involved in it then then we we labor and vain those of us that build Lord but we desire that you would come here this morning and amidst the Lord that you would fill this place fill our hearts Lord May our minds be a tentative to you this morning may our thoughts be upon you Lord as we've got this another wonderful opportunity to meet with you and to be with Brethren of the same Faith as as um the Bible calls it light precious faith or to maybe look through us with our spiritual lives this morning Lord look through the eyes of faith Lord and not look at natural things but look at spiritual things this morning that you could work in our spiritual life Lord too and encourage us and regardless revelation Lord and just to strengthen and encourage us we know each one here we're all going through different Journeys upon our walk and and we all need different things Lord but we've seen that you're hand and you work in in such a way Lord that you can achieve a whole lot of different things in one service and and cater for each person and Lord May our expectation be that Lord that that that we wouldn't come here and desire what we think we want but we would lay ourselves on your altar Lord and say Lord whatever you want for us this morning that's what that's what we want Lord even though we may not know what it is so I just want to commit the service to your hands bless those that couldn't make it this morning blessed brother Andy as he's ministering and um Stratford this morning Lord may you anoint him and Inspire him May the Saints there have a good time and you Lord may you may you meet with them in a powerful way Lord of May forgive us of every sin we've committed Lord that Wicked and we're so thankful for your the sacrifice of Calvary that was made for us we're so grateful Lord for the the ways that you've that you have accommodated for fallen man Lord even even a simple thing like sleep Lord we can lay down and sleep and wake up and have another day Lord I believe you ordain that because you knew that the way that man is Lord we we just our minds aren't very good and we just struggle away Lord but you've given us this opportunity to sleep and wake and to serve you again and the same in our spiritual life Lord You've granted us forgiveness and we're so grateful we want to lay hold upon eternal life this morning Lord that your spirit could we could last let every weight that easily besets us Lord and just just um just dwell in the heavenlies this morning so just commit the service to you we thank you for your grace and mercy towards us pray your blessed Sunday school and bless each each one here this morning we just commit ourselves to you in Jesus name amen amen amen I was thinking about sleeping that's such an awesome thing to to the human being imagine if we didn't sleep imagine if we our minds just kept on going and going and going and didn't have a chance to stop shut down and wake back up again it's such an awesome thing that God's God's given us sleep and and to have a peaceful sleep is so good I don't know why I'm talking about it but I just was thinking about it that it that it has to be of God you know that that he's made the mind that we can sleep and we can wake up and we can carry on and if we sort of just switch off you know there's no sleep in hell they don't get peace yeah there's no sleep but to be able to rest and have peace that's of God he's the Prince of Peace amen I didn't get much sleep I'm not talking about it now let's stand this thing this morning uh number one two five I will enter his gates with Thanksgiving in my heart be thankful for all that he's done for us I'll enter his course with praise when we stop and think about it the Lord's done so much for us so much amen sometimes he just builds and builds and we we just can Overlook what he's doing but he's doing Mighty things in our lives and in our midst amen I will enter please related is baby glasses let's do that one again let's speed up but it was a bit too slow do it faster foreign thank you glasses I mean I feel my way every night do this one

don't know what he's laying in there just the seeds so yeah I know we we're certainly happy to be here this morning we're certainly glad to be in the house of the Lord it's certainly a happy place you know for a for a saint for a Son of God for the daughter of God there's no other place for us so this morning I've just been so so blessed this week you know and um uh sometimes um you know I was standing then I thought ah you know I I I the Holy Spirit has been sort of just pressing on your heart and um and then I said no I'm not going to do it I'm not going to do it and last week I was um testifying to a brother um and his wife and I was just telling them that um uh over the years I've learned that um sometimes God has a work for you it's sometimes very small and if you don't do what it tells you to do there's a price you sometimes pay for it you know so I was standing there and I and the Holy Spirit just kept on tagging at my heart it give the test that when you give the testimony and you know so I trust it will just be a blessing to you this morning um somehow you know the Lord is just uh really blessed us while we were in New Zealand time so it's it's it's it's it's just wonderful I just I just um before the the pastor comes up you know um if you can open your Bibles for me in the Book of Revelations 18 and it's just so wonderful you know it's just um just thinking about how to load is by his grace and mercy and where he has brought me from just the trophy of his grace just a trophy of his Mercy you know and um just seeing the the hour that we at the lateness of the hour the solemnness of the hour and some time back I actually went on to a site and I read a portion of it one morning here and there was a problem with my computer and I didn't get the full part of it and I just read a proportion of it one morning of brother Branham in the Ramada Inn and so on and during the time you know just carrying on with life and just you know dedicating yourself and um uh I was just wondering I was just thinking you know that um Jesus speaks of of fasting and praying um and brother Branham himself speaks of fasting and praying and there was a there was a time there was a season that um in the message of the hour that people felt that since since we are all predestinated it is fine you don't don't don't don't spiritualize things if if the sister had an experience and she's very happy and I'm she's telling us uh she's just spiritualizing that experience you know the Brotherhood and experience he had something so something bad happened and then something somebody learned from it or somebody somebody comes in the and they repent and um or somebody has an experience that for us singly is negative and then the person comes and say oh no no you know now I'm you know through this I'm drawn closer to God and we people sometimes would say yeah you're just spiritualizing you experience you you should have stayed with God all the time and um the the pastor where I served where we served back in South Africa a few years back um they lost their daughter and um uh yeah she was very young and during the week people were just encouraging them I think it's 10 years since he's passed on and she was a real blessing she's a very soft voice very nice person very nice humble character and it was quite surprised that God would take her at that young and tender age that she had I mean I think her youngest boy was just two years old and it was like a shock 444 for people that how could God take her you know and it was like mysterious I would just see she ended up in hospital and um just through a particular medicine and I think the disease that she contracted or the sickness was Steven Johnson disease and it's amazing how God works that you you wonder why these things happen in your life why certain things happen in your life so you might be sitting there and you're wondering why a thing happened and then you you may say that I'm not going to spiritualize this thing I'm not going to make too much of it it's just something natural and and then I was just wondering about why Jesus would say that don't let people know when you're fasting and when you are praying Jesus himself the Bible says he learned obedience by the things that he suffered brother Branham comes along born under the polar of fire under a slight having an angel guiding him through his life and then you would say that I I would I would pray and and fast for for this one and people who come to brother Branham with problems and brother Brennan would go and he would fast for days for that person's merits to be saved or that person to be healed and I was wondering well I'm in the message of the hour I'm elected I'm going to heaven and you know it's amazing that that if Jesus had to sanctify himself if if Jesus had to sanctify and inset aside brother brainer made to do it and I was wondering why why why you know and in the week when I saw all the encouragement to the the brother that has lost his wife which was the the pastor's son-in-law and also all the encouragement to eat to her brother obviously now I'll pass the Sun um and somehow I was I was reading my new ministry and I was really just enjoying the sermon and and then somehow I ended up where they going where the sermon is actually finished and they singing and they're praying let us pray and so so normally when you come to that side brother the brainer must finish preaching them because he's praying in his altar call or whatever and I I hear the book and I was rejoicing and I made my notes like normal and one morning I'm sitting in the train I think it is in the week and because sometimes I read quite a lot of different spoken words at the same time and I went back to this one and I found this lost portion in the last page that's after everything is done so it goes like this I just want to read it to you that you might know that Sovereign Grace reigns with God now he's done everything already he's done he's done the fitted service is finished he's done everything it's gone through everything so the song the praying now he says I want to go back I I just can't yell from placing something else in did you know those two boys that humans children that were saved God knew that before the foundation of the world and their names were actually put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world the Bible says that and it only had to work to this minute so obviously you know we're talking of society right a spoken word because you know those that read will read the sermon my new ministry will know we'll see what brother random did in there did you know God knew now now he's saying God knew that those two boys would be saved before the foundation of the world but it only had to work to this minute you know God knew that we would be standing here 10 million years before the world was ever founded you know he knew we'd be staying here this morning the Infinity of God knowed every fly every net every time they would bear the eyes and how much Tallow they would produce if before the world was ever formed God knew it now you say well if he knows it then why are you preaching so this is Brother Branham asking the question that's God it's part of God's program preaching is his program when he looked upon the apostles he looked upon the Harvest he said the Harvest is arrived in the laborers are few pray the Lord of harvest that he will send laborers into his Harvest how many remember that well why would they have to pray to the Lord of harvest to send laborers into the Harvest if the Lord of harvest was standing there knowing it would be done why was it so arranged now listen to this this is what brother Branham is saying so I actually quoted this very quote that I'm reading now also in the week to somebody else a sister it was in fact the very people that say the message with me how I came in the message of the hour they were in the message they followed the message and it was their parents basically I I'm I met I met him when he was in in I think it's a year four or five year in New Zealand but it's back in South Africa we call it standard senatory or it's our year it's our grade five in South Africa and I would go into this brother's house I'll be I actually became friends with with the boy at school and this is the sister little years later once he got married so I'd go to the house and I saw for the very first time the pillar of fire in their house and I quoted this very next quote to her because he's now divorced from her husband things happen in life things happen that's quite bad in life later on with her life and now she was saying something and and I didn't know what to say when I saw how the people were trying to encourage her and I quoted this now listen to this God has so arranged it that this program cannot move without you and I and as long as we're not doing what God leads us to do we are paralyzing his program but when the church moves by the anointing of the Holy Ghost then we are in God's will doing his program oh as soon as I return from California the Lord willing sonar is telling them you know God needs you and I his program cannot run without you and I and then the next spot brother Branham has this urgency this was Priest November 15 1959. so brother Branham says I'm going now to California and you know what happened in California or also Revelation 18 just now when he preached that Series in California but he says as soon as I'm coming back look at the urgency on brother Branham when I come back the Lord willing what the Branham Tabernacle needs is a Revival now it's night he's been preaching for so many years when I come back then amen they need a Revival in the filling of the Holy Ghost now that's the great need of the Tabernacle some of the finest people in the world come here but what they need is the baptism of the Holy Ghost I feel it I can tell it as soon as we return back the Lord willing we're going to have a Revival for that very purpose that the members of the Tabernacle were people he says here were seeking the Holy Ghost might come in receive instruction in everything else pray meetings in here to receive the holy ghost that the thirds might get back into the will of God and move on with the program of God as it moves on so so so brother Branham did not take it for granted that there's going to be the elected that oh that one will be elected brother Branham sincerely would preach and pray and and preach and talk to people on the streets because he realized he is part of the program of God and God needs his program cannot run without he says here can his program cannot move without you and I and I say to the sister that God needs you to be a light in darkness we are all in the light he doesn't need us here here we can Rejoice but he actually needs me somewhere in a dark place where there's sinners in whatever he needs you somewhere with his darkness and and I I just realized but by God's grace and mercy you know what God has given us what God has given us is given us actually the best and and understanding here is a trophy of his gracious brother Branham says in the Hebrew series speaking of rosella sees a product of Grace you know we are all just a product of God's grace and this morning you know I'm really happy just just pray for me and my family you know the daughter is about ill this morning and just while I'm closing with this um in the in the Revelation series chapter 18. I just want to read this you know just um we yesterday I had such a lot of plans yesterday and somehow the wife and I we sat down and we started um this this um site that I was on where I only found the one part and I managed to get my computer fixed in and yesterday morning I think it was around about five I went on and I was doing some stuff and then next thing I found the whole the home of the of the of the of the link actually I could get onto the whole link and it was about um a man called Zoe Joe brand I don't know if you've ever heard of inzo brand in 1937 he was 17 years old and he had a dream and he dreamed about the destruction of Los Angeles and he gave a very detailed account pages and Pages full and they put it in in a book earthquakes earthquakes by prophecy and they put it in a book and in this pretty book they actually dedicated one full chapter to brother Branham as well and how brother Brandon made it it was just so striking so we we sat down at the table yesterday and we just had such a blessing so all my work was done because when we were done uh you know the anointing came down yesterday morning and we were fell asleep in the wife and iron and sitting and then it was four in the afternoon my Saturday was gone but I believe it was just so good list so you know we were just talking and my wife said she just had such a blessing this week she said she was listening to the sermon and the anointing dropped down and I know my wife she's not a emotional person and my wife was sharing a testimony with me and whilst he was setting a testimony even yesterday my wife started crying and she said the anointing just dropped down realizing the likeness of the hour you know and it's amazing if one sees the lateness of the hour if one sees where we are at um uh the earthquakes that's happening and the you know the things happening currently in Los Angeles um it's it's it's it's it's it's it's amazing that that by God's grace and mercy we are still here and I was just reading last night Jesus said that accept he saw it in the days no flesh will be saved so so um it's really just for us it's the message Believers my wife was saying see see the anointing drop down when she when she echoed to God she's just so glad that that she's a part of the message of the hour she said then the anointing dropped down and I said to her I don't know if it was the same time but I was at work and I was just setting myself aside and you know you normally don't say these things but then you just sanctify yourself you just fast and you pray and you just you know and I said to I don't know if it was the same time but I'm sitting in front of my computer and working and I was listening to the seals while I'm working had my earphones on and I looked through the window and an anointing just pressed on me to go and pray and there's a little sick room that we have and I went in and I went to go pray and I'm also exactly the same thing I just went to say to the Lord thank you for sending me the message because upon the world destruction upon the world it's waiting the the judgments and the and the fire in the brimstone of God is hanging and we are family members we have loved ones that we have we are family of ours that we have that that we say Lord I can't save them you are the only one that can go and save them so so so and that is the earnestness and and the sincerity with which I think brother Branham then approach this so I just want to to read out of those Revelations 18 you know um verse 1 and after these things I saw another Angel come down from heaven having great power and the Earth was enlightened with his glory and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying Babylon the great is Fallen and it's become the habitation of devils and the hold of every false spirit in a cage of every unclean and hateful bird I'll just drop to 8 8 therefore sell her plagues come in one day death and mourning and famine and sea shall be utterly burned with fire for strong is the Lord God who judged her and the kings of the earth who have committed fornication he says here and delivered deliciously would a shall bewail her and lament for her when they shall see the smoke of a burning standing afar off for the fear of hurt torment saying Allah's Allah that great City Babylon that might that Mighty City for in one hour is thy judgment come verse 16 and saying Allah's Allah that great city that was clothed in fine linen and purple in scarlet and decked with gold and precious stones in poles for in one hour so great reads us he says here is come to note verse 19 and the cast dust of their heads and cried weeping and wailing those are those that saw the destruction of the city and they threw the dust on their faces on their heads weeping and wailing saying Allah's alas that great City wherein were made rich and all the had Subs in the sea by reason of a costliness for in one hour EC made desolate and while brother Perry green was sitting privately with brother Branham and that was after brother Branham preached about in this various places that brother Brandon preached about the destruction of Los Angeles and um let me read the next part because it refers to Los Angeles so this great City Babylon it says here verse 8 for will be utterly burnt with fire so the next one verse 20 Rejoice over her thou heaven and ye Holy Apostles and Prophets for God had Avenged you on her and a mighty Angel took up and a mighty Angel took up a stone like a great Millstone and cast it into the sea saying that's what violence saw that great City Babylon be thrown down and shall be found no more at all so while he was reading this so when he was speaking of Revelations 8 18 8-10 while he was reading when he finished when he came to verse 8 utterly burned with fire and in one hour is a Destruction come he says brother Branham just stopped while he was reading brother Ben and just interjected and brother Branham says it's Atomic power that will fall it's an atomic bomb that will fall on that City and the second part of it verse 20 to 21 refers to another Babylon Two Babylons the first Babylon which is which is the one that will be destroyed by fire is Rome and brother Branham says in the second coming of Christ he he says I see that Russell has caught the the the the the it's already really the the the muscle is there already and it's got his name written on USA in Rome and um when brother Branham had a Visions in 1933 when he related the visits for the very first time he had a conjugation to stand up in the church and he had a congregation to repeat a number of times what's Russell what's Russell the King of the North what's Russell what's Russell the king of the Lord and he had a congregation repeating there the whole time and um he interjected there and he said one hour that's Atomic power where the Vatican City will just be destroyed the second Babylon is the one where a millstone and you have read we have all read it when brother Branham came and he threw up in the and brother Reno had to take up the stone the angel said to him pick up a stone and he threw it in the air and he dropped and that caused a whirlwind and it turned to the brother and he said you see you have to do something for things to happen you have to do something for things to happen so if if if if if you want to have somebody saved you have to do something if you want to have healing you have to do something uh no matter what it is fast pray say Lord whatever but you have to do something you had to pick up the stone to get Revelations 20 18 20 together one is a Vatican that will be destroyed the other one is is that City Los Angeles and and and and brothers and sisters just my prayer this morning just an encouragement um you know that it's a it's a very late hour it's a very late time for us you know um uh I I'm just so glad that um you know God has kept me for all these years and when I read the account of the dream and it's it's quite funny when he when he saved the dream they went to go do research on it and to find out if these things can actually happen and the way it describes the dream it's the it's the account in which brother Branham speaks of this role you know and it gives the dream in very detailed account what will happen a lady Hawking with a little child in the road and in this dream he's thinking he can touch to tell her the destruction is coming he's trying to touch somebody he realizes he's he's actually he says destruction is coming he says and the people were caring and he was talking of Indus dream night he saw the men in the street wearing earrings and they had beard and stuff like that and and he said when he he said when he woke up because it was in a few days that the Dream came to him every time or more he said it will never happen people will never wear earrings 1937. he said in this dream if you really account it will never happen and he said then he saw how the like the woman in the city was dressed immorally dressed and the reason of brother Branham I think it's the third or fourth vision of fifth one of their first year and then it went and then what Branham says when they went for that vote after they went and they protested the first person they were all modestly dressed long skirts neat and they protested for the human vote and he says the vision sold him when they came back after winning the vote he said their dresses became sorted and so the Angels told him how they went and it went up and then they started becoming Immortal after they won that vote so so you know it's it's amazing weekend just thank the Lord for for sending us a profit I'm really just so happy um apologies that I'm taking up such a lot of time um you know I'm really just so happy that that God has sent us a prophet um you know it's it's it's it's it's most probably worth more than anything you can have it's more than money you can lose your arm you can lose your eye you can lose your leg you can lose whatever you have you know um you can lose whatever and and and and and and but this is worth much more than gold that you know it's amazing that brother Branham at another place that I was reading that brother Branham says when he went to the Vatican he says there's not enough money in the world to buy that City and God comes with an atomic bomb and destroys it in one hour that means my house my car my gold my what's my whatever I have it's nothing brother Branham never attached any value to it you know brother Brandon I told my wife well he pulls testimony when they came in they asked brother Paul what was outstanding of brother Branham what was outstanding of your dad he said dad was a poor man he was a poor man he turned out Millions he prayed for monarching kings and they wanted to pay him and he turned it down and one place brother Billy Paul said dad came to preach and he kept his arm on the hand and he just kept praying preaching like this because there was a hole in the jacket he preached always in borrowed clothing clothing that people gave him that I said to my wife this was the prophet of God the one they created in heaven and earth so so I then I realized you know that he knew because this world he says when the angel told him turn look look again when he looked he saw America burned up that's great place that everybody wants to be American with the cars and stuff he said when he looked again the angel in the seven Vision when the angel said to him look and he turned and he saw America's desolate it's burning so you know the only thing that we have is actually the message of the hour it's worth more than anything the the it's worth more than our jobs it's worth more than our houses it's worth more than anything so you know by God's creation by God's mercy um you know it's it's been it's really a blessing to be here this morning and I translate we will just um ansonize the word this morning our hearts will be will be so so in in you know in tune with with the pastor's preaching that we will lay ever aside every weight I think the brother said it earlier lay aside every weight that so easily besets us let us not make time yesterday I was cleaning the garage I was just throwing away this digest and stuff because I used to it I said I don't have time now anymore for any other reading this they're always too late so just pray that God would make me more dedicated to the word you know set aside every way that's so easy to be set us um you know and yeah it's been a blessing to you know just to realize what God has done for us seeing the hour the lateness that we are in so I'll be taking my seat I trust that you've been blessed this morning seeing this just anxanize the word just appreciate a little bit and as brother Branham said in that quote it's all part of the program of God the negative things happening it's because God needs you and me so that we can do something so that we can go and pray for that person that's sick there's a problem that comes in our house before the foundation of the world 10 million years President says before the world was formed he knew about this thing he knew that those boys would be saved you know you knew about your problem but we have to dedicate ourselves so I think that's just all that the lord has laid on my heart this morning just to say what is third this morning that the likeness of the hour pray for me as we will continue to pray for you amen thank you brother praise the Lord um let's just um thing number 72 In Christ Alone My Hope Is found as um brother Ben comes up this morning this morning surprise surprise foreign since versus life foreign I never blocked me from his name amen Hallelujah I trust that's your testimony this morning amen hallelujah well it's good to see everyone out this morning amen thank you musicians praise the Lord amen what a day to be alive Hallelujah wouldn't trade it for nothing amen let's just go to uh if you've got your Bibles handy amen Hallelujah amen everyone's happy this morning amen let's go Luke chapter 22 and I'd like to read a couple of verses from there and then um and then we're going to go to job chapter one and um it's gonna see how this goes today so Luke chapter 22 verses 31 and 32. and the Lord said Simon Simon behold Satan has desired to have you that he may um sift you he may sift you as wheat but I have prayed for thee but I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not and when thou art converted strengthen thy brethren now I've got a job chapter one notice notice uh Satan's desire and then notice God's desire in that scripture then we'll go now it's very familiar portion of scripture to everyone here but we'll just read verses six down to 12. and says and there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord and Satan came also among them and the Lord said unto Satan whence cometh thou then Satan answered the Lord and said from going to and fro in the earth and walking up and down in it and the Lord said unto Satan thou hast thou considered my servant job that there is none like him in the earth a perfect and an upright man he that feareth God and askureth Evil then Satan answered the Lord and said Duff and said doth job fear God for naught Hast not Thou made a hedge about him and about his house and about all that he hath on every site thou has blessed the work of his hands and his substance is increased in the land but put forth thine hand now and touch all that he hath and he and he will curse thee to thy face and the Lord said unto Satan behold all that he hath is in thy power only upon himself for not for thine hand so Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord amen let's just bow here's a word of prayer father We Want to Thank You Lord that no power of Hell or scheme of man can pluck us out of your hand father I want to thank you that we are the apple of your eye Lord that you Delight in US Lord that you are father we are the purchase of your blood Lord by your grace and Lord you are Lord we are the ones that you've been looking for father we might as well

Jesus Christ's name amen amen you may have your seats now I wanna uh I want to entitle this if I can give it entail I say When God says no and sometimes when you think that people say well God say no to you but I want to say he know he says no to Satan now so when God when God and and Satan were having that conversation about job uh in a manner of words God said to Satan I don't believe you can do it in other words I don't believe you and brother Bram says us and then Jesus came and called he says and all things are possible to them that believe that's his word but impossibilities are made manifest when God has took it as word yes sir when God's took it as word The Impossibles are made manifest When God says it will be then you take the word and watch what the impossibilities happen it certainly will but notice even in all that she said even now Lord whatever you ask God God will do it so he's talking about when when when Jesus is going to uh lazarus's tomb speaking to Mary and Martha but she knew I mean so she knew that if she could just get the word to come from him that's all she needed to do is get that word yes it was her darkest hour and Jesus came along and called oh what a thing they saw a resurrection let's look at some more when Dark Hours come there was a man one night one time named job one of the oldest prophets in the bible he was a great man he loved the Lord he had done all he knowed how to do and Satan desired to sift him and he said to God one day yeah God said to him rather Where Have You Been Satan oh walking to and fro up and down on the earth he said have you considered my servant job there's no come on the earth he's a perfect man oh he said you give him everything do everything for him and certainly he's a great man but let me have him one time I'll change the tune I'll make him curse you to your face he said you can't do it that's his confidence in a Believer that's his confidence see you have confidence in God but God has to have confidence in you why he's infinite he's Eternal he knows the end from the beginning he knows Satan couldn't do it for he is the word he knowed what job would do now remember job he broke him out and Boyles killed his children took everything he had his health was gone even his comforters came and they couldn't do nothing but just accuse him of being a secret Sinner and old job got into such a place until he got so distressed you have to get in distress first you have to get to a time when you're at the end of the road job got into the end of the robe when he said curse be the day that I was born May the Sun not even shine and the moon not Shine by night May the name never be called and in that distressed and Jesus came along he looked down and said I see a flower die you know um it rise again in Spring if a tree blows down it comes up again through the scent of water he's seen all the botany life living again but he said a man lay it down gives up the ghost where is he he knowed he was an old man he said his sons shall come to mourn over him and he perceive it not oh that thou would hide me in their grave keep me in the secret place till thy wrath be passed a point me a time instead of time uh and he went along talking like that so Satan Satan was Desiring to sift job now Peter we understand as as Jesus was speaking there he said he said the Satan has desire to sift thee now the act of sifting maybe if we can have those slides and I'm I'm going to jump to and Fry just as the Lord leads but can we put those slides up and there's a picture because I want to show you yeah yeah put put put slide three up now this is this is what is called sifting sifting weight where the grain is separated from the chaff and this is part of the sifting process so sifting is to remove things you don't want you just want the pure grain and there's some ways to do it you know there's many ways you either sift it through a machine or these these women here are beating the uh beating the wheat against these drums to loosen up the uh pieces they don't want and then this guy is sifting it through a sieve so he's decided to sift in other words he's desired to remove you from from from the congregation of the Believers he says I had to take you away and throw you on the rubber sheep of life this is what Satan this is what God is you know Satan is telling you know Jesus is saying Satan has desired to sift him so in other words you're not going to be in the upper room you're not going to have the keys Jesus already given him the keys but now Satan's saying you're not going to use those keys I'm not going to allow you to unlock the Kingdom of Heaven to anyone this is what Satan was saying that Satan is desire to system that he could not do what God had ordained him to do but Jesus said but I have prayed thee I mean I have prayed for thee that when you know when this happens that thy faith failed not now we have to in life you know I just want to maybe just go over something from last week can we go to the first first slide now this now now I want you to remember Zion and I'm going to show you in the scripture I just mentioned it last week I just thought to just just repeat this bit because Zion is the bride and maybe let's just read that quickly let's go to the second second slide this is in Psalms 132 13 to 16. I just took one example for the Lord has chosen Zion he has desired it for his habitation this is my rest forever here will I dwell for I have desired it I will abundantly bless her provision I'll satisfy her poor with bread I'll also clothe her priest with salvation and her Saint shall shout aloud for Joy so Zion is not just a physical location but God is saying Zion is the bride Zion is his place of habitation and we know the human soul is where God dwells so he's saying that this is where I'm going to dwell and see I have desired he has designed it for his habitation remember Satan has desired to sift thee I mean so so there's so there's two there's only two powers on the earth there's not three or four or a whole congregation you know a whole group of array there's Satan's kingdom and there's God's kingdom that's the only two and one has a desire and the other has a desire and it's whoever you allow who you yield to their desire will be met in your life who you yield yourself to now let's go up to let's go up to the first can we go up now notice notice this is what God has this is what God has done for us remember when he's talking about Zion here because and and then we'll come down to next I'll show you he says thus saith the Lord the Redeemer of Israel and His Holy One to him whom he has despised to him whom the nation of Horus to a servant of rulers King shall arise a sea in her eyes princes also shall worship because of the Lord that is faithful and the Holy One of Israel and he shall choose thee thus saith the Lord in an acceptable time have I heard thee who's has he answered your prayers except for all time uh I've heard the and on the day of salvation have I helped thee think about it and I will preserve thee and keep thee for a covenant of the people to establish the Earth to to cause to inherit the desolate heritages that thou mayest say to the prisoners go forth to them that are in darkness show yourselves they shall feed in the ways and their passes shall be like in all high places they shall not hunger nor thirst neither shall the heat nor the son Smite them for he hath had mercy on them shall lead them even by the Springs of water shall he guide them he shall lead them to Springs of Living Water and I will make a mountain I'll make all my mountains away and my highway shall be exalted behold these shall come from afar and low these from the North or from the west and from the uh land of of of sinum uh seeing our Heavens be joyful o Earth Break Forth into singing o Mountains for the Lord has comforted his people and will have mercy upon his afflicted he's speaking of you in this in this whole chapter he's speaking of you but notice notice Zion's reply she doesn't say Zion does not say here yes Lord I have been fed I have been clothed I've been comforted I've been set free this is not her confession at this time her confession is but Zion said the Lord hath forsaken me and my God hath forgotten me okay can a woman forget a cycling child that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb yeah they may forget yet will I not forget thee behold I've Graven thee upon the palms of my hands thy walls are continually before me so God is saying something but then the bride in this in this particular sense is saying something very very completely different and the reason the only reason that Zion would say this is because she is not believing what God has done for her but she has accepted the devil's lie because the devil will say thou has been forsaken amen and thy Lord has forgotten me or is he only is it only me that he tells that to amen the Lord you know the Devil comes along and he says God doesn't love you he doesn't care for you he's not interested in you this is what God this is what the Devil comes along and says and if we're not careful we'll accept his life because you'll say look at what's happening in your life if God really loved you and he cared for you why did he allow these hardships why did he allow this sickness why did he allow just these it seems like you're just in a desert and you begin to reason it out and it appears so true but friends God's love is not like human love and we're going to go into that God's love is not like human love amen so she's saying that she is forsaken but now there comes a time where the bride does not speak this way anymore but she begins to confess what he has said because we understand in Revelations chapter 12 that there's war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and and forwarded his angels and the dragon and his angels didn't Prevail and that and that battle that was in heaven now kicked out of heaven and now they're upon the Earth and that same battle is now warring in human beings but then there comes a point where it said and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives unto the death this is not this verse is not for Angels because no blood was shed for Angels Angel blood was shed for fallen man amen so there's a people upon the Earth that overcame the dragon and overcame Satan and all of his all of his workings by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony what is what is a testimony a testimony is speaking things that happen to you amen and it's also confessing what he has said about you amen Our Testimony is not only God God has has delivered me but you begin to speak the same things that God has spoken amen that is that is what we must do you want to overcome him I mean God has God has you know there's overcoming we must overcome you know we can just sit there like a bunch of Spectators and and say yes the Lord can do all things he can do all things but he has to work through human flesh his victory must be manifest in his people amen over every you know over everything and you see every generation there's Giants that must be killed amen David killed David killed Goliath and then and then that you know Goliath have brothers and there was also Sons there was like four other Giants that the Next Generation killed you go read in there the next Generation killed these Giants so there's Giants and brother Bram says the first sermon he preaches after he's commissioned by the angel to take the gift of healing to the world as he preaches about David he says there's a big giant of unbelief in the land and he says I've got a job I said I'm gonna go kill that thing and he killed it I mean in Revival fires were lit on every Hill people saw that God was real again but that was in that generation there's Giants that must be killed in this generation amen because we've seen remember it wasn't you know it wasn't brother Brown the man it was the office he was in and God came to that office and revealed himself through that Prophet so we have seen one coming into Power which is Jesus Christ amen we've gathered to him go go read the story those those Gentile Warriors they knew he was coming into power and that same anointing that was on David Fell upon them and that's why they could do great exploits amen friends I trust you see one's coming into Power one's coming one is stepping he's not that many steps from coming upon the throne in the millennium amen and if we can see we know he's coming into Power draw your sword amen don't don't let any difference beat you down don't let tiredness beat you down don't let well you know just just busyness of life I mean unbelief whatever it is draw your weapon polio sword hallelujah we're not called just to sit and be all stoic and sit around and you know we believe that you know there should be a better a life and an expression doesn't matter if you're very emotional or very quiet it should be a life lived I'm in a Burning Flame is still a Burning Flame it doesn't matter if it's quietly burning or some big some big thing as long as it's burning there and something in your heart says I want to serve God holy I know he's coming into power Hallelujah amen friends the Zeal of his house should eat us up and it doesn't matter how it's manifested as long as it's in there so I've come to do thy will O Lord amen it's written in the contents of a book that I've come to do that I will Hallelujah so that's being fanatical I don't think so people how much money did people spend to go to the World Cup thousands and thousands of dollars and they didn't blink an eye they were excited about it they didn't care what they had there I must be at that final amen and they're excited about it they're enthused about it and they're still living off the memory amen and we have an eternal thing I mean we have the Eternal thing and then we've seen the lamb step forth and take the book how long you've seen we've seen the Redeemer come you say well have you seen him come he's become real to you amen when God came and put his hand upon your life he's laying Hold This one belongs to me this one belongs to me holly I've redeemed them for myself they are mine Hallelujah so we should you know this is the Eternal part well I don't feel all that excited you know just Shake It Off amen just sing whatever you got to do break through holy oh we shouldn't do it in the flesh just just enjoy him just enjoy him you should I trust when you come or when you open your Bible listen to a message it should be a real burden in your soul I don't want to leave this way the same amen when I pray God changed my mind changed me I want to I don't want to just talk to the ceiling remember he hears every prayer so we don't go off on how anointed we may feel I felt As Dead As opposed and prayed for things and God's just done it Faith goes beyond feelings but don't just get all the other devil he you know he loves to say well you're tired you're and and then he says well because you're tired because it shows you're not interested hey man he usually he just used it all again you are you just you don't really love the Lord because look if you really loved him you would act a certain way amen and he uses your own personality against you friends just tell him to shut up you mean about Zion sheep it was actually quoting the devil's word here the Lord has forsaken me and my Lord has forgotten me all these verses we read before this it didn't sound like a forsaken woman did it no she's the apple you're the apple of his eye Hallelujah now I want to talk about if I may have just wanted to put that in there but I want to talk about God's elective love because we think see Zion she had a confession the Lord has forsaken me and my Lord has forgotten me because our love is different to God's love it's it's vastly different because we we think well we love our children so we try to protect them and we feed them and we clothe them and we you know we don't want them to be heard in any way physically or emotionally but God's love you may say this is quite different but God's love is not like that God's love is not like that now this is from can we can we can we jump next one yeah here it's from the church age book now I just want to read this it says from the Samoan Church age now the Lord Almighty says I know there he is walking in the midst of his people there he is the chief Shepherd of the flock but does he hold back the persecution does he stem the tribulation no he does not he simply says I know your tribulation I am not unmindful of your suffering what a stumbling block that says to so many people amen because this is not how human people think this is not how you know this is not what we think like Israel they wonder if God really loves them how can God be just and loving if he stands by and watches as people suffer that is what they asked in Malachi 1 verses one to three the burden of the word O Lord to Israel by Malachi I have loved you saith the Lord yet you say run has thou loved us was not Esau Jacob's brother saith the Lord yet I love Jacob and I hated Esau and laid his mountains and his Heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness now whenever this and then we're gonna go we're gonna go into Romans and read the scripture where where Paul expounds upon it whenever people's mind when you read the scripture before they are even born Jacob have I love but he so have I hated man automatically thinks that's not fair depends what side of the fence you put yourself on amen I say I say that is fair God is Sovereign in his choosing it's not a democracy remember God God has orchestrated salvation in such a way it takes any part of it takes away anything you can do amen remember he put something in you to respond to his word in the beginning and faith is a revelation has to be revealed to you you can't give yourself a revelation it takes God to come down sure you should read the word you got to give you got to give God something to work with absolutely but it takes God to Anchor it from here down into here it takes God sovereignly to Quicken something amen so faith is a revelation you cannot and you see that in uh you know Jesus said to Peter Upon This Rock the revelation of who I am I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it so Faith yeah because some people you know a lot of people they say if you do this step and do this step and do this step you have eternal life not necessarily you have to follow God has a provided way auntie in at the Straight Gate s-t-r-a-i-t that's a water a water gate entry and be baptized name of Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of sin so there's a way you must walk but if it's just a mechanical way amen without God quickening it then that's as far as a lot of people go remember human human understanding there's a massive Chasm between our understanding and divine revelation they're totally poles apart amen amen but you have to give something for God to work with you say I'm just going to sit here by myself you know there's a cartoon I think I saw on Facebook uh you know yo there's a cartoon guys praying Lord I wanna I Wanna Know Your Will and there's a big hand through the cloud saying here it is with a Bible in its hand here's my will you know and some people just expect they'll just sit in a room somewhere in a big thunder lightning time will happen God has sent his word amen God sent he sent his final voice to the to the Earth he sent Malachi for hey man he sent these things so we can hear those things and then something else says that's true and it confirms with what we hear you say well I'm just I just need God to I need to God to show me read it it's in here amen so God you know but it has to be Revelation is sovereign election is sovereign amen now I trust after this service don't just cabbage down and say oh well I'm predestinated everything will be fine you know to me when I was when I was reading into this I'll say thank God amen that God has chosen me and the reason I'm loved is because I'm elected it's not on self-worth or what I do or how good I think I am you know you take you take Jacob you take Esau no one would have picked Jacob Jacob means supplanter no one would have put Jacob as as receiving the birthright for for one he was born seconds that canceled him out completely you know he was a little mama's boy he sat down and he was with her in the tent and and Isaac loved he saw more than Jacob heals a prophet who loved the wrong one more I mean because he was the good church member he did what his daddy wanted him to do he went hunting and got him Venison and did all these things he appeared to be the real believer but deep down no no one would have picked Jacob no one would have picked the woman at the well think of Rahab no one would have picked Rahab for now a lineage of Kings is going to come to Israel and I'm going to use this woman no one would have picked Ruth think of it no one would have booked these people but God elected them to that position and because God you know God elected them therefore he loved them no one would have no one would have picked them you just think you go back into that day no one would have picked these people not you would not have picked them I guarantee if we had a vote who do you think will marry Solomon you know he's you know remember he was royalty in the house of you know Jude he's a general in the Army if we had a poll in the church there just let's just go back there let's have a you know a poll who thinks that who's gonna marry salmon you would have picked some Royal Israelite woman you would never have picked up a prostitute who's a gentile you never would have picked it amen no I I could be honest you would never have picked yourself you never would have picked yourself you're no doubt many of us when we were growing up people would say I just need to pray for that boy there's no way he's ever going to amount to anything when it comes to the Lord but God Made You amen he elected you because there's something in you that when the word came your way you said I want it I want you God Hallelujah something and you said that's me Jacob wanted the birthright above everything and he is willing to even deny himself you mean how did he deny himself he put it you know put he he made himself appear like his brother he denied himself I'm not Jacob he denied himself and he received the birthright Hello friends you're going to deny yourself Hallelujah but he wanted he wanted the birthright and he cheated everyone out of everything till finally God gave him a nature change amen that that really resembled the birthright that he had received Hallelujah no one would have picked me Hallelujah this is why God's election is so beautiful Hallelujah that's meant now sorry where am I here you could you see they could not figure out God's love see remember the Devil comes along the first thing he says is God doesn't care he doesn't love you mother just say I'll just say and the church said amen I mean that's the first thing he does you see they could not figure out God's love they thought that love meant no suffering that's what and that people still think that people think if you really love then people won't suffer Hallelujah they thought that love meant a baby with parental care but God said his love was elected love his love was elected love the proof of his love is election no matter what happened his love was proven truly by the fact they were chosen unto salvation because God has chosen you to Salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth he may commit you to death where we are you've gone to the second one uh he may commit you to death as as he did Paul he may commit you to suffering as a good job that is his prerogative he is Sovereign but it is all with a purpose if he did not have a purpose then he would be the author of frustration and not of Peace his purpose is that after we have suffered a while we shall be made perfect be established strengthened and settled amen repeat after me I'm gonna be I'll be made perfect I've been established I've been strengthened I've been settled Hallelujah as as job said he put strength in US job 23 6 you see her see himself suffered he learned obedience by things he suffered he was actually made perfect by the things that he suffered amen so he's saying God's love um hold on with that one God's love is so different how do you know I'm loved because I've been called I mean how do I know I've been elected because I've been called and not just called as in a big call but something in you says that's me and so therefore I've been chosen just remember the service whatever you do doesn't matter what what what storms may come you know what battles may and you may think why is my life always like this God has it for a purpose and if there was no purpose he'd be the author of frustration and not of Peace you remember this and so how do you know because you know the devil says God doesn't really love you because he's trying to put this hole he knows what human love is and he's perverted it to the eighth degree but he comes along to you says God does not love you and I can say I'm sorry Satan I've heard this the bright I so moved last night when I thought about the bridegroom call will come right through this brother Brown says the bridegroom call will come right through this and it is exactly what happened amen that God sent a voice upon the Earth to call an elected an elected lady I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them amen that God has called me I'm not just trying to preach you happy friends I'm trying to try to Anchor it in your soul if God has called you you're elected and if you're elected you're loved by God and you're never out of his care Hallelujah never out of his care hey man just think about it Hallelujah now it's meant now let's go to the next one this is the lady sitting Church age it's as many as I love I rebuke and Chase and be jealous therefore and repent uh so Revelation 3 19. this is the same message that John had as he cried out and that religious Wilderness of Pharisees Sadia season Heathen repent there was no other course then there is no other course now there is no other way to get back to God then and there is no other way now it is repent change your mind turn around repent for why will you die let us examine the first phrase as many as I love and the Greek the emphasis is upon the personal pronoun I he does not say as many would feel he should say as many as love me no sir we must never try to make Jesus the object of human love in this verse no it is the many that are the loved ones of God hello Hallelujah it is his love and question not ours remember if he if we disbelief oh I probably can't even find it but he says he says he remaineth faithful for he cannot deny himself the scripture tells us he cannot deny himself you say well what does that mean he cannot deny himself Eve was part of Adam Eve came out of Adam and before the fall she was called Adam she didn't even have a name because they were you saw two bodies upon the Earth but but Adam knew this is part of me this is not a different person this is a part of me and so Adam could not deny himself so he couldn't let Eve be burned as she deserved to be burned but he took the fall apart himself because he did not he could not deny part of himself he couldn't lose a part of himself he had a lot more Roots but he had no more feminist part of himself I mean he had because of love because he didn't want to lose a pot imagine imagine being married 60 odd years and you lose your spouse that's why so many you know it doesn't matter if the husband or the wife goes first nine times out of ten the next one goes very quickly because there's part of because they realize there's part of me missing this world could never be the same because I've lost a part of me and then they got to be where wherever they are and Adam was not willing he he knew he could not lose Eve and that's why God remaineth Faithful now that's just the shadow what about the reality amen that's why he remaineth faithful because he cannot deny himself he cannot deny you amen he cannot deny his bride because she's part of him Hallelujah now even his purpose sorry uh it is the many that are the loved ones of God it is his love and question not ours so once again we find ourselves glorying in his salvation I say hallelujah his purpose and his plan and we are confirmed even more strongly in the truth of the doctrine of the sovereignty of God even as it says in Romans 9 13 and we'll go and read it soon Jacob have I loved uh does it now uh does it now obtain that since he loved me only the many is he therefore in the state of complacency awaiting the love of those who are not drawn line to him by no means is this over he declared it also in Romans 9 13. he saw have I loved I'm sorry Esau have I hated and in verse 11 the spirit boldly calls out for the children not being born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not not of works but of him that calleth this love is elective love it is his love for his elect and his love for them is apart from Human Merit Holly that's why I put that in bonus it's apart from Human Merit for it says that the purpose of God stands an election which is exactly the opposite to works or any man or anything that man has in himself Hallelujah because before the children were born he had already said Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated and he now says to his own as many as I love I rebuke and chasten to rebuke us to approve to approve is to expose with a view of Correction Jason does not mean to punish it means to discipline because the subject's amendment is in mind Hallelujah see God God knows God knows what we that must go through but remember the whole underpinning thing doesn't matter if all gives way I trusted his anger in your soul I've been elected I've been called therefore I am loved Jesus loves me this I know and and will say it at the end for the Bible tells me so the Bible tells me I'm elected before the foundation of the world I was I was chosen Hallelujah hey man so we see here friends it's not just our human Merit and maybe I've probably said this many times I trust maybe it just sinks in our human Merit has nothing to do with salvation our our intelligence where we're born what race we are how good we are how rich we are how poor we are it has nothing to do how much you think you know of this it means nothing you actually have nothing zero you can bring to the table you have nothing you can bring to the table well that you say well that really leaves me in Dire Straits you know well no to me it puts the responsibility onto him amen you say then you go say Lord I can't do it you must save me God you must have lived me from this problem you must set me free because he's waiting for you to call out to him Hallelujah I can't overcome this of course you can't overcome it amen without the spirit of God operating in your life you can never overcome anything Hallelujah and that's why God is so good I mean because we can just depend upon him and that's why now when brother Brahms is about applying the token to your family he says you believed for yourself apply that same Faith to them probably that's why I say God call my children call the young people I mean call the open you know to me young people it's not an age thing some Churches put the young people down I lift them up I'm proud of our young people amen their their brothers and sisters like we're brothers and sisters amen God is for you young people God is for you old people how do you know I'm called this something drawing me from in here Amen in spite of what I want in spite of what I wanted to do something in here was stronger than my own desire Hallelujah surrender to that pool just surrender to the pool friends Hallelujah that's all you need to do God will God has already taken care of everything Holy says walk he says walk before me and be thou perfect that's why he gave a perfect sacrifice to make a perfect people that you can be perfect Hallelujah that's what he's done oh I can't live the word of course you can't live this message no one can live the message all it makes is long hair long dresses long faces amen but if you surrender to God he comes and lives a message out of you Hallelujah and he lives his word out of you friends that's all we need that's all we need Hallelujah hey man oh I want to see Jesus in me Just Surrender every day say Lord hey we're failures he knew remember that quota you're from the last book of life I believe it was he says God doesn't operate his business in a haphazard way God operates his business perfect so if he say if he's called you who's been called must say yes God I've been called if you've been called he's not going to lose you the next day he's not you cannot frustrate you can grieve the Holy Ghost but he's not going to unsave you no names can be taken off the Lamb's Book no names can be the book of life is a different part of the book but the Lamb's Book of Life is God's elected group and and our names have been put how do you know your name that's why that's why I put it down to and there's a deep calling that goes beyond how happy you feel how saved you feel how lost you feel how whatever you feel about God if there's something in here says I want more of Jesus that means your name's on the book that means your name's written in heaven on the Lamb's Book of Life Hallelujah the Deep calling to the Deep Satan can remember don't let Satan try you to confess like Zion said I'm destitute my God's forsaken me because the devil tries he he tries it he tries it all the time you've had a hard week you're tired look at all this you know pause it all down on you don't confess what he said I'd say Satan they overcame him by they overcame you I overcame you by the blood of the lamb and the word of my testimony I believe what my husband has said about me Hallelujah I just confess his word confess it till you believe it amen confess it to you believe it friends we're called to believe all things are possible I'd rather I'd rather die in faith and never see the Promise fulfilled then say no God can't do it God can do it we've had such a we have such a record I mean if you took this all the way down to now we've had such a record of God living and God calling people and God delivering God answering prayer Hallelujah you know the word of God I was thinking about this brother Armand was sharing with me you young people who are here was it last Saturday he was talking about Parables too wasn't he he's talking about parables yeah last thing he's talking about parables he didn't speak to me what he this is not okay he never spoke to me what he spoke to you and then I stand up here not on my notes and we're going to talk about parables what is that God operating on both ends amen just just okay who has had God you've been talking to someone and then Sunday or wherever you let's do a service and God has just confirmed or spoken put your hands up young people have a look have a look and God does it more than once because Elisha knew what the king of Syria was thinking in his bed chamber it was a spirit of God in him that knew those things and that same God is present here and I'm not just talking about this building the bride around the world Hallelujah because our God is a dissolver of doubts like like Daniel said it's all part of God operating amen he never said a single thing to me about parables Hallelujah but that's God and why would he do that because God is trying to get your attention that he loves you that God is interested in you see Satan says he doesn't care God doesn't care he does care take the opposite of what the devil tells you how do you know the devil speaking he's trying just see where it leads you does it lead you closer to God or away from God if it's away from God that's the devil if it's closer to the closer to the Lord that is God speaking Hallelujah now we want to go to let's go to Romans chapter nine I want to read this let's read this together Hallelujah God's love is elective Hallelujah I'm happy friends Hallelujah Hallelujah I'm glad he chose me I didn't Jesus said you have not chosen me I have chosen you that's what he said I've chosen you and then remember Satan has desired to sift you he's desired to sift you amen but Jesus remember Jesus prayed Jesus prayed for you amen he said he actually praise you go read it in John he says he says father that you would not take them from the world but keep them in this world amen and he prayed that that you would be as he and the father are one so you and the father would be he prayed for you oh no one's ever prayed for me Jesus prayed for you Hallelujah who else would you want to pray for you he must go to the top Hallelujah amen and he's already done it that remember that is God's remember what is God's desire for my life that you would become one with him as the father and him are one that perfect union that is his desire and that not you'd be taken from the world but you'd be kept in this world that is remember Satan has desired to sift you but Jesus desire is very different Hallelujah Hallelujah Romans chapter 9. and verse 10 we're just going to read what he quoted in the church age book oh down to verse 18 and not only this but when Rebecca also had conceived by one even by Our Father Isaac for the children being not yet born neither having any good or evil I mean never neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth Hallelujah and it will set unto her the Elder Shall Serve the younger and it is written Jacob have I loved but he saw have I hated what shall we say then is there unrighteousness with God should we say that is not fear basically God forbid for he saith the Moses I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy and I'll have compassion on whom I will have compassion so then it is not him that willeth or him that runeth but God but of God that shows Mercy that's that's the important thing has God showed Mercy to you as God showed Mercy that's all that matters Hallelujah for the scripture saith unto Pharaoh even for the same purpose have I raised thee up that I might show my power in thee and that my name might be declared throughout all the Earth therefore hath he had mercy on whom he will have mercy and whom he will and whom he will he hardeneth it's up to God amen you say well that's not fair I say it is fear because it's not a democracy it's not a God is Sovereign he says I've picked this one and I've chosen this one and I've rejected this one not on their Merit but before they even born God made the choice you're just living out God's choice you're living out God's choice you say well I I chose him that he chose you first remember in order there to be a deep in here there must be a deep calling first there's a deep there before there's a deep in here so he's showing that God's election he says I will have so to have mercy is that not love to have compassion is that not love so God's saying I will have compassion and mercy on whom I will and I can say I'm just a recipient of that mercy and that compassion Hallelujah so it doesn't matter you know God just looks down and this is not remember I said it's not on a person's ability or anything they could do but God just looks down and he says I'm going to bless them that's it that's what God has declared there's certain people I'm just going to bless them and that's it I'm just I'm just gonna bless them now many times we think of blessings as a material thing but no that is not that do not use that as your measuring stick remember the devil says look your your finances are ruin and this is all going wrong and he's Jehovah Jireh why isn't he providing for you oh he doesn't care that's why no no no no no no no no no no no don't go down that road remember Satan if he can if he can get you to think that God doesn't love you that's normally the biggest thing does God love me does he care I'm telling you absolutely he loves you and he cares I mean because if we if we measure God's uh you know because we want to be pleasing to him don't we we want to play Above All Things Our Father in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in other words have your way in Me O God I want to be I want everything I do I want to be pleasing unto you not to try and earn anything but because you love him so then we think now because out of our sincerity if things go wrong the devil says well you don't really please him and that's why this is happening oh no but this is so don't let that become a measuring stick don't measure God being pleased with you so many times okay so there's just me so many times we think of being blessed as in material things don't use that as your measuring stick and don't measure God being pleased with you uh because everything is going well in life either God being placed as a respective members remember I said he just I'm just going to bless this one I've Loved Jacob I've hated Esau that's it before they even born so he just looks at the people and says I'm just going to bless those people that's it nothing can reverse my blessing but we see that you know if we look you know let's just go to Psalms chapter 37. because sometimes we can look at look at the world around us and we can be envious of what others have amen I'll just yep because especially being a father and a husband you want to give the best to your family amen you want them to have nice things you want them to be comfortable and then you can if if we're not careful we can become envious of what others have but remember when I said when God said I'm just going to bless I'm not talking about material things I'm talking about a real blessing or wouldn't it be yeah sure a blessing can come in a material thing but I'm talking about a real blessing so we've got a Psalms 37 and verse 34. he says this here he says wait on the Lord and keep his way and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land when the wicked are cut off thou shall see it I have seen the wicked in great power and spreading himself like a Green Bay tree yet he passed away and lo he was not Yaya sought him but he could not be found but the transgressions are sorry he could not be found Mark the perfect man and uphold the upright for the end of that manner's peace but the transgressors shall be destroyed together the end of the wicked shall be cut off but the salvation of the righteous is of the Lord he is their strength in the time of trouble and the Lord shall help them and deliver them he shall deliver them from the wicked and save them because they trust in him so David said I saw the wicked like a big you know oh what a great big house they have and a great career and everything's going so well but then he saw yet they passed away they were nothing amen so he's saying don't look at hell don't look at how people prosper sure God is in prosperity too but don't look at that I'm talking about a real blessing God's real he says that he's just gonna bless and that blessing really isn't spiritual things amen that blessing is not in material things it's in spiritual things where you can know you can know where you come from and who you are to me that's a real blessing it just adds stability upon your life you say I know who my father is I know where I came from and I know where I'm going and all and all this life is is just character building Hallelujah but he has an end result in mind and that's his desire Amen to see me come into my maturity my perfection Hallelujah so just walk with God you know you just think you just think of what of what we you know you know the message we have this this Bible is not a sealed book anymore I mean we know we know what God is doing we know what he has done we know where we are in the word we're not stumbling around in darkness we don't have to go and look at conspiracy theories and get caught up in numbers and blood moons and all those things and you know look at what people call the Illuminati and all this mumbo jumbo you know we don't have to we've had us uh thus saith the Lord on the word amen so we know where we are this whole world is scared the world is scared amen we're not scared the world is a troubled place but we have peace amen the world is a confused place but we have a clear mind I'm in this world is falling but we're ascending we know where we are now to me that's a blessing because a lost person the first thing they want to know is we're there and how they get out amen and this world is lost and they have big forums and they had the big climate change thing in France and they're gonna we're gonna do this and we're gonna fix this this is how we're gonna have peace and you're no doubt we're Syria and all these things there's diplomatic communication going across the globe and they're trying to fix it but they don't know how to get out they don't have a way out they don't have the way out friends and God just says here's the way out Hallelujah you know that would uh it says in John 14 I go to prepare a place for you that word prepare actually means to make a way Hallelujah so we're blessed amen we're blessed people I I know I don't need to tell you that but we're a blessed people that we know where we're going and we know where we're from and that God is our father he said well I never knew my dad growing up God is your father oh we have a relationship with your real dad Hallelujah you know we see let's go to Numbers Chapter 23. remember if God has called you I don't care how quiet members are still Small Voice brother Brown says in one place that funny feeling you feel come over you that's God calling you I mean so it's so simple I need a big Heavens open all these things no just sometimes something on you says you know you're wrong what is that that's God calling Hallelujah all the grace of God Holly I know and whom I have believed Hallelujah numbers 23. now here we have a numbers 22-25 is a story of of Israel going and and they want to pass through Moab to go into the promised land and the king of mob will not let them pass and he tries to get the you know he tries to he knows he can't defeat them in battle so he gets another Prophet Balaam to try and curse them that's what he tries to do and this Prophet remember prophets the word of the Lord comes to the prophet doesn't matter if he's a true vessel or a false vessel and it says so I'm only taking one instance and let's just read this in numbers 23 16-21 and so he tries to get it to to curse them three times takes him to three different places and all the and the Lord met Balaam and put a word in his mouth and said go unto balak which is the king of Moab and say thus and when he had come to him behold he stood by his burnt offering and the princes of mob with him and balak said unto him what hath the Lord spoken remember they're they're believing in the same God what has the Lord spoken and he took up his Parable and said rise up Bala can hear hearken unto me thou zone of of of zapor God is not a man that he should lie neither the son of man that he should repent hath he said and shall he not do it or have he spoken and it's and he shall not make it good behold I have received commandment to bless and he has blessed and I cannot reverse it he hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob neither have he seen perverseness in Israel the Lord his God is with him and The Shard of a king is among them Hallelujah this is what this is what God saw me because what a prophet says is not what he thinks it's what God is declaring and so he's actually saying this is how I see Israel I have blessed them and I cannot reverse my blessing amen I have you know you know I have blessed them and I cannot reverse my blessing he says I do not behold iniquity and Jacob Emma God sees everything he was a people that had you know because of one part uh a Bellic system I mean I mean I mean sister Balaam come around this side of Israel and I'll show you its back parts so I'll show you the worst part of the camp I'll show you the worst Believers among them surely when you see all the all the all the Badness and you know all the all the sin they do surely you'll curse them when you see that because God is a righteous God I mean God judges sin he's not a doubting Granddad he's a father that corrects us children deals with sin surely surely because you know the Lord like this because this is how God is you know when you see them in this way then you'll then God will be mad because you'll be Looking Through The Eyes of that prophet and he'll curse them but then God says no I cannot curse what I've blessed I cannot curse that which I have elected I cannot curse that which I have you know blessed and I cannot reverse my blessing if I have blessed they are blessed and I and not only that but I see no iniquity in her I see no sick yeah I see no iniquity in Jacob now we are the spiritual Israel amen so when the devil speaks to God about you remember the accuser of the Brethren will be cast down and he's falling even now as the bride goes up he comes down remember and so Satan Satan comes before God and accuses you like he did about job you see what they did the other day you see how they did that they even premeditated it and they did this and they did this wrong and look at them over here look at what they've done and God says to him I see no iniquity in her Hallelujah I see what I have blessed because he because Satan would say you must curse remember Satan has made the world in this way because he knows God must pour judgment upon it because if he if he judged soda and Gomorrah for what they did he must also burn this world with fire amen so he knows he knows that if he gets man into a certain State like this then God must judge it so that's why Satan comes to God and says look at look at these people that claim to be the bride of Christ and they claim to follow this message and they claim to know you in the power of your resurrection and the likeness of your sufferings and look at these things that they fail every day they fail amen and we do but then when God looks at you he says what I have blessed you're blessed I could literally say thus saith the Lord the bride is blessed and I cannot reverse my blessing amen what I have blessed that woman I have blessed you shall be blessed and I cannot reverse it I see no iniquity in her earlier because they have because remember with Moses they had the smitten Rock they had the manner in the wilderness they had the brass serpent amen they had the attributes of God among them Divine Healing amen provision for their Journey you know their their shoes you read in Deuteronomy their shoes didn't get old they're closed didn't get old 40 years God gave them strength because they walked out of Egypt under the blood of the Lamb holy they took the communion and gave them strength to walk 40 years Hallelujah God equipped them Moab didn't have those things they had the same sacrifice the same approach they didn't have the same results Glory Amen to God if you're blessed you're blessed that's it in the story it doesn't matter remember God's love is not like parental care he'll allow you to go all through all kinds of things and he'll allow you to maybe go through terrible things but remember that does not mean God does not love you because you've been elected you've been called that's it you say well many have called them few are chosen how do you know you're chosen because when you called to him something happened to you you can look back in your life and say once I was this but no I'm not that anymore something has happened amen amen I'm not just talking about maybe the way he dresses change some your Nature's changed the way you look at things is different what has happened that's God's doing Hallelujah Glory amen there's no temptation taking you but such as is common to man but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you're able but will with Temptations also make your way of Escape that you may be able to bear it Hallelujah amen he says this now you say well he say I'm just I'm just kidding by I've had a desert of a of a year or a decade or whatever it is I have this for you this is an Isaiah 42 behold my servant whom I uphold might elect and whom my soul delighteth I have put my spirit upon him and he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles he shall not cry nor lift up nor causes voice to be heard in the street a bruise read shall he not break and the smoking Flacks shall he not quench he shall bring forth judgment unto truth he shall not fail nor be discouraged till he has set judgment in the earth and the Isles shall wait for his law so he's saying a smoking Flex is not going to quench it he said I don't even know if there's a fire burning in my soul anymore he won't quench that fire amen he shall not you say well I I don't he said I'm so dry I feel like I'm I'm you know Antarctica is the driest place in the world whether you believe it or not you said I I feel like that I'm all frozen over you won't quench what's in you amen he will not quench it Hallelujah and he knows what you're able to bear you know it doesn't matter if the whole world falls apart walk with God has ordained remember he has confidence in you God has you say well I don't know if I can do this God has confidence you're not a coach you know I remember being young playing hockey and all these things a coach analyzes the players and their performance and and and their best position in the team and they can see things in the player more than even the player can see it in themselves because the coaches Analyze That player and so they say no you go play a wing or you go play send a half or you know you know whatever position the coach places you in that position because he knows you have the qualities to play that position you say well I don't really have confidence I can do it God has confidence in you amen God has confidence in you he had if he had confidence in Joe he sure has confidence in you amen now this is doesn't testimonies this is a 1950 this is this is a prayer line I just you know sometimes sometimes we love to put up a wall sometimes we like to think everything's peachy because because in some ways we shouldn't confess the devil's Works sure we should confess the word but if we if we lean too far that way the devil can literally Force us into a corner I mean and then we become cut off from the rest of the body of Christ because we want to put up a good a good uh everything's fine I'm a Believer praise the Lord here I am I'm bride friends this isn't James to confess your faults one to another not your sins you confess into God but confess your faults because if we pray for one another I'm not talking about finding out Prince to gossip that's wrong but if there's a if you have a need you say well I'm battling certain and you can put confidence in certain people in the church say pray for me amen they pray you pray God comes upon the scene there's power and prayer if white will chase a thousand two ten thousand how much more remember that's just a shadow what about the reality oh there's two hundred thousand thousand demons loosed in this age there's more someone do the math and see how many we can chase someone do the math Hallelujah amen he says us here this is a testimony 1915 forgive me I didn't put it up our heavenly father we thank thee for thy mercy now no it's just in a prayer line and bless that young man Lord and make his life fruitful keep them Powers away from him Lord may he may he go into outer Darkness speak about the devil Bound in the name of Jesus Christ amen never in all my Ministry have I seen that before now he's speaking to I think someone else you don't sleep too often though for one thing another thing you've got cancer isn't that right now and believe with all your heart he says I have a little girl at home and I know she's praying the way you are too so it's a little girl I'll do everything I can to um to ask him she's our heavenly father you see the teardrops coming out of these little pale chicks rolling down what can she do Lord she's helpless without you she'll be a wreck after a while Satan's desire to sift her but we're praying now Hallelujah oh Father be merciful to the little lady strengthen her faith just now to rule out that demon power father sure as I'm here and your servant I believe you'll heal her now you can't fail you're the Lord Jesus Satan leave the girl in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ come out of her you know what's happened to you don't you you're healed possible lady and I want you to work for the Lord you want to do his work now you go you're going to believe me if you take my word now and do as I tell you God will do just what I say um say he will do here I want you to go from the building when you leave tonight just so happy I want you to be smiling and go tell everybody the Lord healed me and if you feel just Satan say no you're not say now Satan you might as well go away because a man that could tell me what has been in my life has told me that I will be well and I'm well now so you get away with me see and be just as happy as you can be forget and when you go out you watch the difference in your reading that's that that was healed to give it to you see and the nervousness has gone from you you feel quiet don't you no more gloomy feeling and it's gonna stay if you could if it could make you feel good right here bring the presence of the Lord to you here just believe that what I told you it'll stay with you now that's the reason I'm doing that honey because you're mixed up and you're just at the time of life of a little girl as your mother near the uh in the building I thought so I could feel her out there I thought mother you know what I'm speaking about don't you it's just her little age right now is what's doing that amen and don't you you know fly right or just just stay right on and be happy and rejoicing and everything's gonna be all right for you you believe that say amen God bless you Sister see I read that because Satan remember Satan was this is a little girl Satan was Desiring to sift her but he said but we're praying now hey man the same God friends that was there as present I believe with all my heart that same God you know you say a big trial comes in your life Satan is Desiring to sift you I mean to separate you out from Walking with God but Jesus but I've prayed hallelujah it's the same thing even today that's why I was so blessed when I read this is but we're praying now in other words if Satan Satan desired to destroy he said you'd be a wreck after a while she'll be a wreck after a while so if she kept going down that road she'll become a wreck Satan wants to wreck Our Lives friends we have an enemy it's not a imagination he's a real devil and there's a real you know there's real powers of Darkness but if there's real power seduct hey we see on the street we see Darkness man don't we we see Darkness manifested you say how dark is this world how terrible everything's gone pear-shaped if that is so on the negative how much more God is present Amen to strengthen his children in this time of trouble Hallelujah Satan has desired to sift her but we're praying now that's why it's so powerful don't don't don't put on a false impression sure wish we should confess what the word says they say you you go to a brother or sister you say I need prayer I really need prayer for something why because Satan it doesn't matter how young how old Satan desires to sift us amen just turn us into some commodity for his kingdom don't don't just sit there do something about it amen do something about it because God's that is not God's desire I was thinking Satan he wants to destroy relationships he wants to destroy families there's a certain point where God says no you can't do it amen he comes you know you you see him working I'm gonna destroy that one I'm gonna destroy you and God says no you can't do that Satan I want to cause these people to end up in divorce God says no you just think on the day of judgment it's not just men being judged there it's angels will be judged as well and those demon spirits will come up before the Lord and the Lord will say you try to destroy a family of my bride hallelujah what a fearful and and they know they've got it coming they know they've got it coming but what a fearful thing amen I say you know Satan's defeated being he has no right you think well this is just how life is it's a new season we just have to ride it out not necessarily not necessarily friends don't live below your privilege amen if there's something especially between you know this world is engineered to divorce the whole world this is what this world the whole world is engineered to break up husbands and wives and Families this this whole society we live in is engineered for that one goal destroy everything just make everything a wasteland there comes a point where God says no you cannot destroy this family Satan you cannot destroy this relationship you cannot destroy this family relationship Hallelujah Hallelujah hey man we should live up we should accept what God has for us if anything can remember if anything comes into the family it's all haphazard just realize it's not the person doing it that's the devil doing it I mean we wrestled not against flesh and blood but against demon Pals remember that Hallelujah things are going funny it's not them the enemy is never your brother or sister or your spouse or your child the enemy is never them the enemy is the devil even if they are believing Satan's lie they are not the enemy so whatever you do never turn your guns on them turn your guns on the devil Hallelujah and pray and seek the Lord's face you know if there's a crisis you see in the book of Acts Peter was going to get killed they didn't haphazardly say well if he's elected to die he's alive whatever this is his time he's he's lived out his portion of the word because he opened the door on the you know day of Pentecost all these things they had a prayer meeting they had a brother bound and they were not willing they were not willing to leave that brother bound they are not willing to let that brother die and they prayed and they prayed and God answered the prayer amen friends now call you friends we have the same faith that they have and we have a greater portion of Faith because the word's been open to us like it wasn't to them that's why there's times where we should have at this particular need you say well whatever you do I think I said it you know I had during the week I was walking down the stairs at work and the devil will challenge me on this but something anchored in my heart my three girls are the Lords it wasn't I hope so something Anchored In My Heart they belong to him Hallelujah you pray until because if God has revealed that to you nothing will move it amen because there's always a doubt you know the devil loves to come in maybe your kids are praying that way because they're not gods this is it this is how the devil Works he says maybe they're just not elected you throw that out you reject that in the name of Jesus Christ whatever you do oh my spouse or extended family of a burden for maybe they're just not called you reject that do not even give a second on that thought he said God they're part of my inheritance they must come Hallelujah Moses said will not leave one hoof behind so you probably seek God about it remember when you use your faith that you had for yourself use it for your family whatever you do and don't let this world make you callous and indifferent well I gave them a chance was it God's timing was it God's chance I heard I heard a uh um yeah I heard in a sermon yesterday there's in a prayer line I wish I found it a man comes before brother Branham and he had a tract in his hand that he wrote and he and it was called I is God real and said I blasphemed God basically this man wrote it he actually totally rejected totally rejected the Lord younger and he wrote a tract about distributed it he came before The Prophet it was all in the recording and brother Barracks he said you actually love him but you know the devil's Twisted you around all these things and he prayed for him that he would he would receive his salvation I can guarantee if I was standing there I'll be honest I think this man has crossed the line I mean this man has crossed remember that is God's doing if someone's crossed the line or not amen and that man received what he needed there do not turn your back on your family or your friends you say they want nothing to do with this Jesus I love Paul didn't want anything to do with it either amen he wanted nothing to do with it at all and look what happened to him he said well there's no more Messengers they're still bride to be called amen so we should pray we should come together if there's a great need we should have times of prayer but what if he doesn't answer what if he does give him something to work with him oh well that's just human ambition no it's not if they did it in the book of Acts they didn't just say well that was just predestinated to happen it's finished they prayed David when when remember when he had the first child with Bathsheba and the child was sick he was on his face praying he didn't just say well this is just a judgment of God and just he was on his face praying but then when he found out the child died he washed himself he went into the house of God and he gave him praise amen friends we should that is that that is a bright attribute I know I'm being long but but that is the bride on display amen you might you must be able to see yourself in those kind of stories where they where they interceded for someone if there's life in the body There's Hope Hallelujah well they're on the other side of the world that's irrelevant I think yeah I think I've shared it before woman comes for brother Ron Spencer a few
