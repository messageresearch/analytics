everyone hey it's great to have omar and alma alma here god bless you amen great to have you welcome amen if you've got the scriptures handy we're just going to go to the gospel of mark in the 10th chapter amen is everyone there verse we're going to read from verse 17 just a very familiar piece of scripture to everyone and when he was gone forth into the way this is jesus there came one running and kneeled to him and asked him good master what shall i do that i may inherit eternal life and jesus said unto him why call us thou me good there is none good but one that is god thou knowest the commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness defraud not honor thy father and mother and he answered and said unto him master all these have i observed from my youth then jesus beholding him loved him and said unto him one thing thou lackest go thy way sell whatsoever thou has and give to the poor that thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come take up the cross and follow me and he was sad at that saying and went away grieved for he had great possessions amen let's just let's pray together lord jesus lord we wanna thank you for your word thank you lord that there's parts of your word which are full of rejoicing and there's parts of your word which cut very close to the bone lord that are very uh i don't know how to describe it but lord i just pray as we uh would come to remember your death burial resurrection lord we'd take of the lord's supper dear god and footwashing lord i just pray there'd be such an atmosphere here of your presence law dear god we do not desire to go through a ritual lord just because it's been quite some time since we have partaken but lord we want to come with real sincerity lord and real thanksgiving lord i just pray you'll just speak to our hearts lord amen lord we just ask these things in your wonderful name and name the lord jesus christ lord may you just anoint speaker one more time and hear her lord we just want to just surrender the service and ourselves into your hands in jesus christ's name we ask amen amen god bless you you may you may have your seats this uh tonight so i'd like to uh to speak about the rich young ruler tonight you know brother branham he would dramatize when israel would come out of uh come out of egypt and the first passover was a very serious event it was a very uh it was done in great haste you know it was a a time of rejoicing because this was the last night they'd spend in egypt that house they were in they weren't going to stay there no more but yet even in that great time of rejoicing there was there was death in the land it was a very serious night a very sobering night because they would have realized that the only thing between them and that death angel was the blood that was the only thing it wasn't because their israelites wasn't because they were good it wasn't because they were smart or didn't matter what part of his role they were in if uh one of the princes or one of the least the only thing between them and the death angel was the blood and there would have been great rejoicing when death didn't strike their house they heard a great cry through egypt but that cry wasn't from their house it was from the other's house that decided not to apply the blood but brother branham tells us that you know there came a time when taking the lamb to the priest on behalf of the family or yourself because of sin it started off as a very sincere thing but it became a family tradition somehow as it was passed down from father to son and you know mother to daughter and to the next generations it just became something they did as opposed to with great thanksgiving to jehovah god and great reverence and respect and love that he had provided a way though it was just an animal life that was given they could be so thankful that their sins were not attributed to them anymore but the blood had taken care of their sin but it became a family tradition maybe of something of pomp and pride as the greatest of the um greatest of the families would take their perfect lamb or their perfect bullock and maybe parade it through the streets and it'd be a big fan fair kind of thing and the sincerity of the event was gone but we must never ever ever ever ever let that happen this must never even even just to you just think about we can read the word of god we can hear a vindicated voice in this day of darkness and confusion that god said to the earth we can hear it and he and god put it in our language you following me most of us english is our first language and even if english is not our first language most has been translated into a language we can understand and god caused it to come our way we weren't looking for him doesn't matter how what we think we were we weren't looking but he found us because there was a blood that had to cover you and i and god was searching till we were covered amen and we must say we must never ever take these things for granted i believe you know even as i said just to read his word to hear the message what an incredible blessing one incredible thing that this world is groping in gross darkness this is a rise and shine for thy light has come and the glory of the lord has risen upon thee it's not a natural glory it's not an earthly glory it's the glory of heaven of almighty god has risen upon thee and this rich this this young rich man you know we watch the play that cloverdale did about this and something sometimes things just anchor in your spirit and you know and he was a good boy he kept all the commandments he was an outstanding member of his community he wasn't like he wasn't like the woman at the well he wasn't like legion he wasn't like any of those kind of people no doubt we would all probably want him as a neighbor and he would help us and he would be good to us and he would you know he would you know he would be known as as as a great young man and many of us no doubt would actually want our boys to be like this because he observed all these commandments from his youth so he wasn't just you know he was serious about his his walk with god he was sarah you know he was a he was a good young man good morals good character but it goes to show that we can have the best character we can have you know brother brown said a man can be good can pay his tithes help his neighbor do everything but yet without a new birth is still outside the kingdom of god that's how serious it is so this this young man as we call him the rich young ruler if he said if he was lying when he said to jesus that he had observed all these things from his youth jesus would have told him that he was lying but jesus actually acknowledged you have done this what you have just said you have done and it even says that jesus beheld him and loved him so really you know many people say well jesus loves me that is true but it's your response to his love that matters it's your response back to god your attitude towards him is the thing that's important and so here he was but there was one thing he lacked one thing it wasn't a big obvious thing it wasn't a big glaring thing one thing he lacked one thing here he came to the one who could give him eternal life his priest couldn't give him to him the rabbi couldn't give it to him the the synagogue couldn't give to him the high priest couldn't give it to him he came and he found this man and he realized that this one could give me eternal life he says what must i do and jesus says you're lacking one thing we never want to lack one thing one thing we don't never want to lack and he he had to be willing to give up his identity what he thought about himself in order to receive eternal life he identified himself in his riches you know in his in his you know in his money in his wealth and there was a lot of pressure no doubt because his dad would have been his parents would have been real proud of him they would have they would have basically put him on a pedestal look at our son our son's not like your son our son's better than your son and so there was a pressure on him to to stay in this kind of a mold but he knew that that mole didn't help him it couldn't meet the satisfaction it couldn't satisfy the longing that he had and he it's amazing because he came to the source of eternal life he was speaking wouldn't that be wouldn't you love that kind of an audience to talk to god in the flesh yes talk to him i don't know what i don't know what i'd say i'd be like the one with the well probably just pour it out but he came to the right one he didn't ask for someone's opinion he went to the source but jesus says this is the thing you are lacking but he wasn't willing to give up what he thought about himself he wasn't willing to surrender himself to what the lord wanted him to do you know it's so easy to hold on to pride it's so easy to hold on to this idea about ourselves you know brother brown would tell the story of a i heard brother donnie reagan say this and and one you know things just stick with you someone put it on youtubers little clip but brother brown tells the story of a little boy he'd never seen a mirror before he goes to his relative's house i can't remember what relative it is he sees a he sees a full door sized mirror and he walks in front of it and he thinks there's another boy he doesn't think it's him he's never seen himself and then he begins to move and the boy moves he moves the boy moves he does this the boy does this he says mama it's me it's a reflection and the thing is we want our reflection to match this right we as as the prophet will tell us we want our experience to match god's bible right we want our walk our life to match god's bible not try and not try and make the bible match our life but we want to match the bible and so he saw an image of himself and he found out he was lining up because he was making that image but the problem is people they make an image of what they think a christian should be it may be preached them for years they may have formed it in their own mind but they make an image of what a christian really is but it comes down to those last moments of life when the mental faculties begin to go and people begin to realize am i matched up with the image of the word brother brown would tell another story and it was more than a story it really happened of a lady who turned down now i just want to put it this way there's a line we can cross there's two lines we can cross one is you can never receive mercy again the other one is you can never receive judgment again there's two lines you cross one or the other are you following me tonight so he he'd tell a story of a of a of a of a lady she turned down really meeting the lord jesus and but she was religious she was a sunday school teacher in a big denomination and she was on death's door and the sunday school were all in the hospital room she was going to die and they were going to watch the angels come down and take her to heaven and the pastor was strolling up and down the hallway smoking cigarettes all stressed out and as she was dying but me that her mental faculties began to leave her her reasoning began to leave her and her true state came to her forefront because she for years had reasoned i'm okay i'm okay i go to church i'm a sunday school teacher i believe in jesus i'm okay but then when the reasoning begin to leave she didn't accept god's provided way it's very simple repent be baptized in the lord jesus christ and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost make sure you get the holy ghost don't start the first two get all the way through right but so but she tried to bypass that and she began to reason i'm all right but then when she was dying all the reasoning left her and she realized i'm lost and she better cry out with anguish i'm lost go get that other girl or go get that preacher and get tell the copy i've lost and then the then the her pastor came in she said you deceiver of men i'm lost and the pastor said to the nurse give her a hypo to calm her down and that's her state she died in because in her mind there was an image of christianity that she had that she held that she was looking at her whole life it was the wrong image it was the incorrect one and then when her reasonings begin to fall the real image of who she was flashed before her come on that's right we don't want to have the wrong you say but i'm in the message you can still have the wrong image of christianity in your mind we must know him amen we never want to be in that state this young man was a good man brother brown is the only one that i know of that would tie this young man to the rich man in luke chapter 16 where jesus would begin to speak of a certain he says there was a certain man and in the scripture when he says there's a certain man it really happened in my opinion so this rich this rich young ruler wasn't willing to surrender himself he had to keep hold of what he what he thought he was but then of course it didn't satisfy his heart so the only thing he knew was to build and gain more money and do the do that kind of thing but there came a time in his life where his riches meant nothing he thought finally my soul can rest who knows the story he said so so why is he saying his sulking rest he says finally i found satisfaction for that hunger in my soul but then when he thought he had found rest his soul was required of him and so what he thought he was you know what what is really going to matter at the end of the day is he there when when when this heart stops beating when this stop my last breath leaves my body should i die there's a doorway called death that we all must walk through is he there to catch me or is he not going to catch me those are the two options he'll either catch me and carry me through or i'm gonna fall and this rich man died and he lost everything why are you talking about these things we're about to take the lord's supper we don't want this to be a family tradition we can hide behind singing behind music even behind preaching we can hide behind so many things but what's really on the inside of the inside of us we can reason a lot of things we can explain even our own stayed away no doubt the root general explained it away to himself tried to find peace i'm okay i'm a good person i can use this money to help the church i can do this and this and whatever more you know i'll have greater influence in my community if i keep my riches it didn't help him no doubt even at his death or maybe it is burial many would have gathered many would have gathered and they would have stood up and maybe gave great speeches of of the things this man did but where he was where he found himself he was alone this is why this is not joining a church this message is not joining a church it's not writing your name on a book it's not becoming a group of people this is not what christianity really is it's meeting the lord it's walking with him this is what this this message came that we would walk with jesus and that's not a catchphrase that's a reality he found himself alone and he was in torment and no one could help him in that place loneliness is of hell we don't have to be alone in this life he's our guide he's our companion you feel lonely in this life that's satan but there's another man called lazarus he is a poor man but he he found himself in abraham's bosom to me i believe he would have heard jesus and he didn't have a lot of reasoning to try and hide behind he said well i'm a poor man what else do i have and that's to me a man of great wisdom who can who can recognize what is this life this life means nothing really it's not even real it's a vapor there won't be that many years gone by we won't be here maybe it'll just be our children of the lord should terry or our grandchildren that'll be it we'll be gone and then where will we be then so see it's not what we can do this man this rich man said what can i do to inherit eternal life it's not what you can do it's what you surrender to the woman at the well wasn't given a bunch of have you been keeping these that's right she just said we know where messiah cometh the prostitute with the alabaster box she didn't she wasn't asked have you been keeping the law have you been a good little girl no she just gave her all [Music] now i want to say there's a line as i said there's a line between mercy and judgment and this rich man crossed the line between mercy and judgment what does that mean he crossed the line that he couldn't receive mercy anymore didn't matter how long he lived on the earth everything good he did he crossed the line he turned down mercy for the last time you say well this isn't very happy this is sobering but i want to maybe finish with this there's a line between judgment and mercy and there is a people upon the earth that cannot cross from mercy into judgment but you have to be in it's not just on your journey well you know god's working with me i'm on my journey don't just be on the journey get in those who had to run to the city of refuge they won't say well just enjoy the journey and i'm enjoying the journey to ram off gilead or wherever no they didn't care about the journey but when they saw the gates they'd just well that was a nice hill at all god's dealing with me hearing all this they just wanted in the city hallelujah and when they were in then they could let off the pressure say i'm safe i'm safe i'm safe what kind of journey were you on i don't care i got here this is what i was interested in amen as the same thing with you and i forget the journey people all about it you know enjoy the moment experience the journey live the journey whatever forget the journey just get in amen it's the destination that matters because once you cross into the city of refuge i wouldn't want to leave you imagine there was a avenger of blood on my trail because of some accident you know didn't mean to do and he could have he had the legal right to kill me and i get into that city and now i'm safe do you think i'm going to walk out those gates no way there was one that did his name was abner david said he died like a full we don't want to fall into that category but those who are sealed into the kingdom they have crossed the line they can't be judged john 5. verily verily i say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation that's the judgment that is passed from death into life they've passed they can't come to the judgment this scripture is a bride scripture not those who are just on their journey israel was on a journey but the older generation didn't make the journey because of because of unbelief this may be seem very elementary tonight but if you've really been given faith which is a revelation no no but god's anchored his word in your heart and he's changed your life he's changed your life to me this is you he that believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from death unto life we don't want to take this casually what a tremendous thing i'm just i'm really just going to leave it like that but i just want you to think about it because this is an examination time am i in the faith do i really know him have i made everything right i need to make right do i hold anything against anyone have i forgiven them you know has everything been put right or am i just doing this because mum and dad do and this one does as a tradition we don't want to be rich young this message will produce some rich young rulers but you don't have to stay that way are you following me we don't want to just be good church people we want to know him let's just let's just stand tonight shall we if anyone wants to be remembered in prayer let's just bow heads all together shall we if you all want to be remembered in prayer tonight from what's been said i just want to raise your hand to the lord lord jesus you see the hands that are raised lord i put both of mine up lord lord jesus that's one thing we don't want to hear one thing they'll lack us lord like the rich young ruler he wasn't willing to give up that thing he lacked lord he wasn't willing but lord i pray o god that should we hear that those words now lord you're not a god of confusion that we have to try and work things out lord you are a still small voice lord you speak to our hearts you prick our conscience lord you show us things that if we haven't given them to you or haven't made things right lord you bring it to our hearts oh god lord i don't know the hearts of the people but you know our hearts oh god lord i just pray oh lord if there's anyone here that lacketh one thing lord may they get rid of that one thing lord may they give it to you in this moment lord dear god may they not hold on to it and reason your way but lord may they just give it to you lord jesus i just want to pray lord for your mercy lord we know that there is a line between mercy and judgment where a person can cross that line and mercy is no more available for them but lord there's and i pray dear god that may no one be tipping across that line even now or skirting around it or near it lord but father i pray lord as there is another line that that that we can cross which is a line between judgment and mercy where we can be sealed into your kingdom by your holy spirit lord where you can come and dwell on us lord it takes a life given it takes a full surrender lord jesus a real repentance lord but it takes you to do that lord it's the goodness your goodness that leadeth to repentance my god it's your goodness it leads to a full surrender so dear god i just pray for each one here lord if there's anyone here lord jesus no doubt by the number that's in the room and the ages we have lord no doubt there's some lord that are on their journey but lord may they not continue on the journey lord isn't just walking and you're dealing but lord may they just meet you o lord may they come to their destination oh god and be sealed into the kingdom by your holy spirit lord jesus lord may you grant it may move on every heart lord and dear god all of us lord hear who have been sealed in lord that city of refuge has been our habitation maybe for a few years maybe for many years but lord may we appreciate it more tonight lord lord to be hid our souls hidden away in you o god lord sealed into the day of our redemption by your holy ghost seal lord jesus i just pray lord you just take these things lord minister to everyone's hearts oh god lord as we have a time as we're gonna partake of the lord's supper lord have a time of foot washing now lord i just pray lord may it be a real thanksgiving in our hearts lord may we not take it unworthily lord jesus lord may i just pray oh god may it be like the first ever for the shadow of this which is the passover feast lord in egypt may there be such a thanksgiving in our hearts lord that you have risen out of history lord to take us from this world lord jesus to take us lord not like in those days from from from egypt into the promised land but lord you've come to take us oh god lord jesus from this world into glory and dear god i just want to thank you lord jesus lord i just pray dear god may you may bless the service now for your glory lord in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you friends you may have your seats we're just going to go to first corinthians 11 now we're just going to read the scripture so we're going to go to verse 23 of first corinthians 11. he says for i have received of the lord that which also i deliver unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do add me in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had sup saying this cup is the new testament in my blood this do ye as offers you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that drinketh sorry he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the lord's body for this cause many are weakened sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when ye come together to eat carry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that ye come not together unto condemnation and the rest will i sit in order when i come amen so as brother braham said this is a showdown time is everything right with the lord has everything been made fine so we're going to just pray for the bread and the wine we know that these are not the literal blood blood and body of our lord jesus it's just element representation of them brother queben are you going to you're going to come forward or brother which one of you could you just come forward brother eden we'll pray for these and and then we're just going to pray and then when you as you feel to there's no hurry come forward you may receive the lord's supper amen so they should still stand once again sorry for a certain stand bliss'll stand delicious bowel heads their lord jesus lord what a price that you paid for our sin amen what a price might go off the lord you lord you did it lord jesus lord we didn't force you to do it but lord because love constrained you my god love for adam's fallen race lord jesus that you'd redeem us back to yourself lord lord you're mad more than any man but lord yet it was a joy set before you lord which was us redeemed around your throne so lord we thank you we can have this evening lord in remembrance of your death lord what a price you paid my god so lord we just want her close our eyes and bow our heads in thanksgiving and lord i just pray father may you bless this bread oh god lord as your body was mad more than any man o lord we thank you lord jesus that your body was given for us oh god lord and also this wine oh god which represents your blood lord jesus what a blood that you had the blood of god what a what a purchasing price you paid or there couldn't be any other price you ever paid in creation lord but you yourself became a man and shed your blood upon the earth for us lord so we want to thank you for that my god thank you that you poured your life out for us oh lord that we could receive life eternal so lord i just pray for each one here lord jesus i just want to ask lord if there's any sin in our lives lord may you forgive us lord any ought or ill feeling against anyone may we make it right lord lord jesus lord there's any any habits or things that are not pleasing to you lord our lives lord may you examine our spirits lord our lives lord there's anything in us oh god that's not pleasing unto you lord
