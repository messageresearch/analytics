[27:34] saints you can have your seat we have
[27:37] sister megan
[27:39] for a testimony and a song
[28:00] that's okay
[28:04] [Music]
[28:15] our brother um
[28:16] preaching he's not here tonight is he
[28:18] this morning
[28:19] oh brother our minds was getting excited
[28:21] and going off his notes and um
[28:24] oh it's okay thank you i'm plugged in uh
[28:26] it's just it's gonna hurt i appreciate
[28:32] [Music]
[28:35] about coming to church and he said we
[28:37] should be asking god what god wants of
[28:39] us and i was i was really feeling it so
[28:41] i closed my eyes for a moment and said
[28:42] oh god what do you want from me um and i
[28:45] uh
[28:46] i was sitting there in the divine energy
[28:48] for about five seconds and i think i was
[28:49] actually feeling confident to feel
[28:51] something uncomfortable like and i think
[28:53] if i heard something uncomfortable i
[28:54] might have really listened to it like if
[28:55] i had a it's very important to wear a
[28:57] skirt and not just on sundays i think i
[29:00] might have actually done it
[29:01] um but instead the uh the feeling that i
[29:04] had immediately after that was
[29:06] maddie groves
[29:07] uh with some emotional content i'm going
[29:09] to translate as maddie graves is going
[29:11] to be epic at megros is the name of the
[29:13] song i was working on at the time that i
[29:15] was getting ready to record the next day
[29:17] and i was actually feeling really
[29:18] doubtful about whether that was a good
[29:19] song or not
[29:21] um
[29:22] and so that was just it was just two
[29:23] words but i did a lot of unpacking of
[29:24] those two words and i think in a broader
[29:26] sense i'm going to translate that as
[29:28] saying uh your works are acceptable
[29:30] um and even like if i go if i go
[29:32] extending beyond that a little bit i
[29:34] could say yeah your clothes are
[29:35] acceptable
[29:36] um
[29:38] just uh just just do that frog music
[29:40] project so um
[29:41] after all that i'm definitely not going
[29:42] to sing maddie groves because
[29:44] it is epic it was epic i went down and
[29:46] recorded it it was miraculous but it's
[29:48] not a church so i'm not going to do it
[29:49] today
[29:50] i'm just going to play um a couple of
[29:52] little fin tunes um because i'm um
[29:56] i'm learning to feel the divine energy
[29:57] through my violin around here and maybe
[30:00] a little less doubtful but my works are
[30:02] acceptable
[30:03] so it's just a little tune called sleep
[30:04] russell which is a place known in
[30:06] ireland and uh
[30:14] [Music]

[55:28] amen may the lord bless his word you may
[55:30] have your seats this morning i want to
[55:32] take a opposite title you know we've
[55:34] been talking about the oh it's great to
[55:35] have vicky here as well god bless you
[55:37] great to have you here uh yes i won't
[55:40] ask the question that i'll ask after i
[55:42] normally say that but we'll see him one
[55:43] day praise the lord give our love and
[55:45] regards to paul please amen thank you um
[55:48] so i want to take so i've been taking
[55:49] these last few sundays about the devil's
[55:51] mental health crisis but i want to take
[55:53] the opposite now of the peace of god and
[55:54] the bride
[55:55] i mean because we live in a troubled
[55:57] world but the trouble shouldn't be in us
[55:59] amen that now we know that there'll be
[56:01] uh you know to have the peace of god
[56:03] does not mean we are void of trouble
[56:05] right we're always we are living in a
[56:07] time of trouble and so there may even be
[56:10] trouble in our minds but in our hearts i
[56:12] trust is a peace that passes all
[56:14] understanding amen because we live in an
[56:17] hour where god has given as brother
[56:19] brahm would preach a couple of sermons
[56:20] shalom and he wasn't just saying
[56:22] something to say it but he was making a
[56:23] declaration of the peace of god is now
[56:25] upon the bride of christ gross darkness
[56:27] covers the people but the light of god
[56:29] has risen upon thee and his glory is
[56:31] seen upon me so we live in an amazing
[56:33] hour where there's trouble in the world
[56:35] but we can walk around in perfect peace
[56:37] now brother brown
[56:38] makes a statement very familiar quote
[56:40] one of my favorites from um
[56:42] i think it's from the message uh he
[56:44] swore by himself he said jesus christ no
[56:46] matter if he was in a storm and the gale
[56:48] was knocking and the boat from one side
[56:51] to the other or he was standing in a
[56:52] face a mess of demons if he was hanging
[56:55] anywhere it never moved him he walked
[56:57] right on just as calm as quiet he as he
[56:59] could be why
[57:01] he was simply unconscious of fear or
[57:03] anything around him that's right whether
[57:05] it was going to happen or whether it
[57:07] wasn't going to happen he knowed it was
[57:08] going to happen because god said so he
[57:11] didn't say oh have i prayed through i
[57:13] wonder if i fasted long enough i wonder
[57:15] if i did this he just walked right on
[57:17] unconscious that's right he believed
[57:19] that god said what god said was truth
[57:21] the word must be fulfilled and he know
[57:24] that his life was to fulfill them that's
[57:27] right and you're here to fulfill it too
[57:29] just walk unconscious of fear walk
[57:32] unconscious of criticism walk
[57:34] unconscious unto the world walk as you
[57:36] walk in christ walk with him not paying
[57:38] any tension the right or left hand just
[57:40] keep
[57:41] moving on if something comes up in the
[57:44] church walk with god hallelujah if
[57:46] sickness strikes you walk with god amen
[57:49] if your neighbor don't like you walk
[57:51] with god just keep walking on with god
[57:53] enoch one day walk like that you know
[57:55] what he done
[57:57] amen he walked all the way home with god
[57:59] just got so far up the road he didn't
[58:01] want to come back anymore amen
[58:05] walk with god the doctor says you're
[58:06] gonna die walk with god yeah the doctor
[58:09] says well walk with god just walk with
[58:11] god that's all for god has promised you
[58:13] i'll never leave you nor forsake you
[58:15] i'll be with you to the end of the world
[58:17] he took an oath and by that covenant
[58:18] that he give you that he would confirm
[58:20] it just walk with god then you'll have
[58:23] your ups and downs
[58:25] don't worry
[58:26] you've got to go through briar patches
[58:28] over sharp rocks over bluffs down over
[58:30] the hillsides up through the mountains
[58:32] over waters but walk with god yes sir
[58:35] there's so many hills to climb upward
[58:37] you've heard the old song but how little
[58:39] it'll seem when we get to the end of the
[58:41] way my my just look at there all that's
[58:44] been look back at your footprints it
[58:46] won't be very much amen so if sickness
[58:51] strikes you don't worship your sickness
[58:52] just walk with god
[58:54] it doesn't mean you won't have any
[58:55] sickness but just walk with god don't
[58:58] worship your trouble don't let the
[58:59] trouble be the main thing in your mind i
[59:01] mean just walk with god see some people
[59:03] you know we have a hard week we come to
[59:05] god i mean come to church we sit here
[59:07] like a piece of stone because of what
[59:09] the week's done to us but god's never
[59:10] done that to us god's always been good
[59:13] just fair loving kind understanding and
[59:16] i don't come to church to worship my
[59:18] problems i come to here to worship god
[59:20] right so i'm not going to let my
[59:22] problems dictate to me how i'm going to
[59:24] worship god and walk with him no i'm
[59:25] just going to walk with god
[59:27] i mean so it didn't matter what jesus
[59:29] was facing he walked unconscious of it
[59:31] it didn't mean he put blinkers on and
[59:33] ignored it he just walked with god i
[59:35] mean because he knew he was here to
[59:36] fulfill the word right and we're here to
[59:38] fulfill it too and brother braham says
[59:40] that nothing can take you from the earth
[59:42] until god's purpose has been fulfilled
[59:44] in your life it doesn't matter how close
[59:46] you get to death whatever happens
[59:48] nothing can take you until your purpose
[59:50] is fulfilled
[59:52] i mean so that should give us such a
[59:53] peace
[59:54] i mean it doesn't matter what we are
[59:56] facing in this life right now amen i
[59:58] believe we're going to pack out the
[1:00:00] victory i mean we're going to walk
[1:00:01] through it amen because god has not
[1:00:03] finished with us and if he has finished
[1:00:05] with us praise the lord
[1:00:07] i get to go to be with him amen amen so
[1:00:10] you can't lose one of my favorite quotes
[1:00:12] brother brother brown says you can't
[1:00:13] lose being a christian you just can't
[1:00:15] lose right you win either way amen amen
[1:00:18] so
[1:00:19] praise the lord so we can we can rejoice
[1:00:22] excuse me
[1:00:23] that we have a peace that passes
[1:00:25] understanding now i said the peace of
[1:00:27] god that he has given to us is not
[1:00:29] making us void of trouble or hardships
[1:00:32] or problems so he doesn't give us a
[1:00:33] peace where there's no trouble
[1:00:35] right because some people think you're
[1:00:36] gonna live up in the bush and there's
[1:00:38] nothing around you but tranquility and
[1:00:40] then you've got peace no no you can be
[1:00:42] living in this rat race of this world
[1:00:44] and have a perfect peace
[1:00:46] and and that's the kind of peace god
[1:00:48] gives us
[1:00:49] amen we'll get into that more now jesus
[1:00:51] it says that he would he would be you
[1:00:53] know isaiah would prophesy of him coming
[1:00:56] and he'd say in isaiah 53 and 3 he is
[1:00:58] despised and rejected of men a man of
[1:01:01] sorrows and acquainted with grief and we
[1:01:03] hit us at where our faces from he was
[1:01:05] despised and we esteemed him not surely
[1:01:08] he hath borne out griefs he has carried
[1:01:10] our sorrows yet we did esteem him
[1:01:12] stricken smitten of god and afflicted so
[1:01:15] he was a man of sorrows and acquainted
[1:01:17] with grief he knew grief but he wasn't
[1:01:18] he didn't he didn't have a spirit of
[1:01:20] depression upon him he wasn't a
[1:01:22] depressed person
[1:01:24] right though he is a pardon me a man of
[1:01:26] sorrows acquainted with grief that did
[1:01:27] not stop him fulfilling the word of god
[1:01:29] in his life he did not have a depressed
[1:01:31] heavy spirit
[1:01:32] though he was a man of sorrow and
[1:01:33] acquainted with grief why because he
[1:01:35] walked with god
[1:01:36] amen so we shouldn't let things in life
[1:01:39] drag us down
[1:01:40] but we should walk with god you know the
[1:01:42] peace the peace that passed all
[1:01:44] understanding
[1:01:45] that the lord will give us now i think
[1:01:47] um if we can go to john
[1:01:49] now i don't know why i put page numbers
[1:01:51] on these notes what's the point i kind
[1:01:53] of jump everywhere but if we go to john
[1:01:55] 14.
[1:01:57] now i don't know if i'll be very long
[1:01:58] this morning but some you know some
[1:02:00] letters you get in the mail aren't very
[1:02:02] long but i just want you to really have
[1:02:04] a real i i trust it would anchor in your
[1:02:07] heart
[1:02:08] it's not us pushing pulling trying to
[1:02:09] get it's god's going to carry us through
[1:02:12] right it's not whether we hold on it's
[1:02:13] whether he holds on right and he's going
[1:02:15] to hold on because his grip is the most
[1:02:17] powerful grip in the world right so we
[1:02:19] don't need to be all flusterated in life
[1:02:22] we need to look unto the lord because
[1:02:24] our help comes from him now we read

[1:03:02] um we could go into this but see this oh
[1:03:04] no so let's go back there right this is
[1:03:06] the song that'll be sung in the land of
[1:03:08] judah i'll say this is the song that
[1:03:09] should be sung in the land of the bride
[1:03:12] we have a strong city salvation will
[1:03:14] guide a point for walls and bulwarks
[1:03:16] that's defenses so he's going to make
[1:03:18] salvation at our defense see the enemy
[1:03:20] comes against you said no no i'm saved
[1:03:22] god god save me i've come based on the
[1:03:24] requirements of his word i've come god's
[1:03:26] provided away amen by receiving the
[1:03:28] blood of jesus christ repenting giving
[1:03:30] my whole life being baptized in his name
[1:03:32] i've received the holy ghost i fulfill
[1:03:34] brother abraham says that that that that
[1:03:37] a um
[1:03:38] full obedience to the full word of god
[1:03:40] entitles you to the token now and then
[1:03:42] he says that that full obedience is acts
[1:03:44] 2 of repentance being baptized remission
[1:03:46] of sin and you shall receive the token
[1:03:48] amen that's full obedience to the full
[1:03:49] word of god right so who's done that has
[1:03:52] anyone gone through that right so now we
[1:03:53] have salvation as our defense right so
[1:03:56] if we're saved we can't be lost if
[1:03:57] you're really saved you can't be lost
[1:03:59] i mean let you be a defense no the lord
[1:04:01] is my helper he's my strength he's my
[1:04:03] shield what can the enemy do against me
[1:04:05] what can man do against me if god is on
[1:04:07] my side amen and we know that anything
[1:04:09] that happens and
[1:04:11] for to us is for our good all things
[1:04:13] work together for good those that love
[1:04:15] god are called according to his purpose
[1:04:16] romans 8 28 and i trust that should be a
[1:04:19] foundational strict scripture of our
[1:04:21] life that this is whatever you're going
[1:04:22] through right now we could go from here
[1:04:25] to the back and there'd be everyone's
[1:04:26] going through all different things but
[1:04:28] if you if you love the lord and are
[1:04:30] called according to his purpose it's
[1:04:31] working for your good you may not
[1:04:33] understand the current why there but
[1:04:35] it's working for your good why because i
[1:04:37] trust it's driving you closer to the
[1:04:38] lord and as you yield yourself to the
[1:04:41] word you yield yourself to him and makes
[1:04:42] a character who makes his character form
[1:04:44] a new more so it's working for your good
[1:04:47] right because the people he's going to
[1:04:49] rapture off the earth is the people he
[1:04:51] sees himself and he sees his own
[1:04:52] character of nature he sees his word
[1:04:53] manifested amen let's go to the next
[1:04:55] verse there amen open ye
[1:04:58] open you the gates of the righteous
[1:05:00] nation which keepeth the truth may enter
[1:05:02] in
[1:05:03] now we know that truly in this hour
[1:05:06] the only way you keep the truth is if
[1:05:08] the truth is in you and the truth is a
[1:05:10] person it's not a bunch of collection of
[1:05:12] arguments and ideas no i am the way the
[1:05:14] truth and the life of the lord jesus
[1:05:16] said so if the truth is in you you'll
[1:05:17] keep the truth you can't help it amen
[1:05:20] praise the lord let's go to the next
[1:05:21] verse who's enjoying the bible i am i
[1:05:23] mean that will keep him in perfect peace
[1:05:25] whose mind has stayed on thee and what's
[1:05:27] the qualifier because he trusteth in me
[1:05:30] rise is not just a mental strength
[1:05:32] saying i'm going to keep my mind on the
[1:05:33] lord i'm going to no no because he
[1:05:35] trusteth in thee that's why his mind has
[1:05:37] stayed upon him
[1:05:38] right that's why he's kept in perfect
[1:05:40] peace because there's a full trust
[1:05:42] god has got this god is in control we
[1:05:45] can rest if this is all you get out of
[1:05:47] this service i mean you could just take
[1:05:48] this to the rapture right because god
[1:05:50] god has got your life amen right he had
[1:05:53] it before you met him and you'll have it
[1:05:54] now as you walk with him and he'll take
[1:05:56] you all the way
[1:05:58] praise the lord so that's why he gives
[1:06:00] perfect peace because our minds are
[1:06:02] stayed on him because we trust in him
[1:06:04] amen if he's revealed himself to you you
[1:06:06] can trust him
[1:06:07] he did not reveal himself to you for you
[1:06:10] know he didn't do that to push you down
[1:06:12] in a hole somewhere saying you're no
[1:06:14] good nothing no he reveals himself to
[1:06:16] his people to lift them up
[1:06:18] liberate them from the bondage of sin
[1:06:20] and death and unbelief in all the
[1:06:21] devil's devices
[1:06:23] i mean that they can act because what
[1:06:24] does he want to do he's always wanted a
[1:06:26] relationship
[1:06:27] he's wanted a love relationship with the
[1:06:29] people that's what he's always desired
[1:06:31] from the beginning
[1:06:32] down through so so he reveals himself to
[1:06:34] you because he wants a relationship with
[1:06:36] you
[1:06:37] it's not just one way traffic of him
[1:06:38] doing all the talking or you doing all
[1:06:40] the talking no no it's a it's a
[1:06:41] communion communion is he talks to you
[1:06:44] you talk back that's my lord you have a
[1:06:45] relationship amen and so so he allows us
[1:06:48] to go through things in life because he
[1:06:50] wants to build a trust he trusts his own
[1:06:53] word
[1:06:53] he has full confidence in his salvation
[1:06:56] right but he needs you to have that same
[1:06:58] confidence how do you get that
[1:06:59] confidence by going through things that
[1:07:01] he builds he proves his word in every
[1:07:03] trial
[1:07:05] hallelujah
[1:07:06] amen you take moses going you know
[1:07:08] taking the children of
[1:07:09] israel out of egypt to the promised land
[1:07:11] what happened through that whole journey
[1:07:12] god proved himself
[1:07:14] over and over again they were stuck in
[1:07:16] bondage he liberated them from egypt
[1:07:18] they came to the red sea he opened the
[1:07:19] red sea they were thirsty he gave them
[1:07:21] water they were hungry gave them food
[1:07:23] you know they the enemies came against
[1:07:25] them said moses lift up your hand you'll
[1:07:26] win the battle yeah they came to came to
[1:07:28] the jordan he opened the jordan came you
[1:07:30] know came to jericho he tore jericho
[1:07:32] down you know went through conquered the
[1:07:34] land god proved himself over and over
[1:07:36] again that he went through the judges
[1:07:38] and the people of israel forgot him yeah
[1:07:40] god would come to gideon different ones
[1:07:42] reveal himself deliver them and then say
[1:07:44] hey god's true he's faithful
[1:07:47] amen and it's the same thing with us
[1:07:49] we're lost in sin bondage of all kinds
[1:07:51] of crazy stuff god liberates us hey
[1:07:53] god's a savior we can trust him you get
[1:07:55] sick he heals you oh god's a healer
[1:07:57] he builds trust and love in your life
[1:07:59] for him
[1:08:01] amen
[1:08:03] and what does that do that allows our
[1:08:05] mind to be stayed upon him and it builds
[1:08:07] a perfect peace in your life
[1:08:10] if he pulled me out of one thing he's
[1:08:11] gonna pull me out of another right if he
[1:08:13] healed me here i believe he healed me
[1:08:14] there he he met my needs there he'll
[1:08:16] meet my need here what he's the same god
[1:08:18] amen
[1:08:20] hallelujah
[1:08:21] and it's not something we earn it's just
[1:08:22] something he does because he wants to
[1:08:25] praise the lord
[1:08:27] so remember it's not a reward scheme you
[1:08:29] know like a coffee card you get the
[1:08:31] tenth one free kind of thing it's not
[1:08:33] well i've done this enough lords
[1:08:34] therefore i get a miracle here no it's
[1:08:36] not how it works it's god's sovereign
[1:08:38] grace is i'm going to put myself into
[1:08:39] your life i'm going to prove my word in
[1:08:41] your life over and over again hallelujah
[1:08:45] amen now
[1:08:48] yes so
[1:08:49] we're in john now are we yes we are all
[1:08:52] right now
[1:08:55] john 14. i hope that's really what i was
[1:08:57] going to here we are john 14 26 yes
[1:09:00] thank you very much i'm glad we have a
[1:09:02] listening audience right here
[1:09:04] john 14 and 26
[1:09:07] he says about the comforter which is the
[1:09:09] holy ghost whom the father will send in
[1:09:11] my name he will teach you all things and
[1:09:14] bring all things to your remembrance
[1:09:15] whatsoever i have said unto you
[1:09:17] amen so when the holy ghost comes into
[1:09:19] your life he brings the word to your
[1:09:20] remembrance
[1:09:22] right he's the inside teacher we need
[1:09:23] the inside teacher
[1:09:25] i mean peace i leave with you my peace i
[1:09:27] give unto you not as the world giveth
[1:09:29] give i unto you let not your hearts be
[1:09:31] troubled neither let it be afraid so he
[1:09:34] says the peace i'm giving you is a
[1:09:36] different one to the peace in the world
[1:09:38] now peace in the world is based on
[1:09:40] circumstance
[1:09:42] it's on you know people i've never seen
[1:09:44] people stressed if they're doing well
[1:09:46] materially
[1:09:48] i've never seen someone anxious and
[1:09:50] nervous and stressed because their bank
[1:09:51] account's got a whole bunch of money in
[1:09:53] it you know their mortgage is paid off
[1:09:55] they've got no debts
[1:09:57] who's seen that i know it sounds
[1:09:58] ridiculous but who's ever seen someone
[1:10:00] no it's normally a financial crisis
[1:10:02] brings a stress
[1:10:03] but there's peace people now this is the
[1:10:05] world's peace right
[1:10:07] if everything's provided for people have
[1:10:08] peace or people have peace because
[1:10:11] there's no trouble in their life
[1:10:12] they're going through a good patch
[1:10:14] there's no worries like people are
[1:10:15] normally relaxed on holiday
[1:10:18] why because all the cares of life and
[1:10:19] their job and stuff they just kind of
[1:10:21] you know put it to one side they're
[1:10:22] going on holiday they're all of their
[1:10:24] responsibilities kind of are not as
[1:10:26] heavy on them anymore right
[1:10:28] right but you see so the world thinks
[1:10:30] that's the kind of peace well that's the
[1:10:32] kind of peace the world gives
[1:10:34] right so things are going well there's
[1:10:35] no sickness there's no worry in the
[1:10:36] family no no job stress nothing that's
[1:10:39] that's kind of the world's peace but the
[1:10:41] lord says no i'm going to give you a
[1:10:42] different peace
[1:10:43] and this piece is actually far greater
[1:10:45] remember the lord gives far greater
[1:10:47] anything the devil gives is just a cheap
[1:10:49] copy and a perversion of what god has
[1:10:52] and the and the reality of what the lord
[1:10:54] has is far greater than the perversion
[1:10:56] like i remember i was brother andy was
[1:10:57] there too you were at a camp and i was i
[1:10:59] was literally i felt drunk on the spirit
[1:11:01] of god
[1:11:02] and it was awesome but there was none of
[1:11:04] the perversion of the wickedness that i
[1:11:06] know was like to be drunk in the world
[1:11:08] this was the same kind of drunk feeling
[1:11:09] but none of the perverse sin with it
[1:11:12] yeah right and so i just realized man
[1:11:14] being drunk on the spirit's way better
[1:11:15] amen than this cheap copy that the devil
[1:11:18] tries to pull down people's throats
[1:11:20] that's right that means it's not like
[1:11:21] the lord takes away things and you know
[1:11:23] then there's nothing to it no no god has
[1:11:25] far greater
[1:11:26] amen but you need to taste and see that
[1:11:28] the lord is good amen amen and you'll
[1:11:30] see his
[1:11:31] you're being addicted to the spirit of
[1:11:33] god it's the greatest addiction you can
[1:11:35] ever have
[1:11:36] i mean you never wake up in the morning
[1:11:37] and say man i can't believe i did that
[1:11:39] it's like praise the lord i want more
[1:11:41] there's no regret there's no man oh why
[1:11:43] why'd that happen you know no there's no
[1:11:45] shame hallelujah
[1:11:47] hallelujah so the peace he gives is far
[1:11:50] greater
[1:11:51] amen see brother brahm says unto whom
[1:11:54] shall we go he says true peace
[1:11:57] true peace is where you know by
[1:11:59] revelation that your sins are all taken
[1:12:01] away
[1:12:02] you'll pass from death unto life and if
[1:12:04] this breath is your is the last one in
[1:12:06] your body so this is actually me you've
[1:12:08] got an eternal body waiting in the
[1:12:10] heavens already that you'll step into
[1:12:11] that's true peace
[1:12:13] right true peace is knowing that
[1:12:15] amen and then brother says he is the
[1:12:17] only eternal happiness and joy and peace
[1:12:19] what more could i say he's the only
[1:12:22] eternal joy eternal happiness eternal
[1:12:24] peace my peace i give unto you not as a
[1:12:26] world give i unto you let your hearts
[1:12:28] not be troubled he is the only peace and
[1:12:31] the only happiness oh you might laugh
[1:12:33] like a loon
[1:12:34] you might go into some hysterics over
[1:12:36] some movie start cracking a joke or
[1:12:38] something but what is it it's only
[1:12:40] making a noise that soon wears off and a
[1:12:42] few minutes will all be gone but when a
[1:12:44] man has come to a place where he has
[1:12:47] found
[1:12:49] about me that the joy there is in the
[1:12:51] knowing that his sins are forgiven that
[1:12:53] he is dead and his life is hidden god
[1:12:56] through christ sealed by the holy ghost
[1:12:58] it's joy unspeakable and full of glory
[1:13:01] and the power of the eternal god knowing
[1:13:03] that you're resting securely in his love
[1:13:05] and grace
[1:13:06] that's a real peace
[1:13:08] it's not based on circumstance it's not
[1:13:10] based on bank accounts or money or
[1:13:12] whatever no no because all those things
[1:13:14] wear off a joke wears off comedy wears
[1:13:17] off but a lasting piece i mean he said
[1:13:19] this is the kind of piece i'll give you
[1:13:21] it's an eternal peace amen it's an
[1:13:24] eternal joy it doesn't wear out it
[1:13:26] doesn't get old
[1:13:27] hallelujah
[1:13:29] amen this is this is the piece he says
[1:13:31] again into the key of the door he says
[1:13:33] key to the door he says there's only one
[1:13:35] daughter peace yeah he says my peace i
[1:13:37] give unto you he's there he's the only
[1:13:39] one daughter genuine peace you might
[1:13:41] think you've got peace you might
[1:13:43] accumulate enough money to buy your
[1:13:45] house you might accumulate enough money
[1:13:46] to get your children's clothes have food
[1:13:49] to eat but you might have accumula you
[1:13:51] might have accumulated enough popularity
[1:13:54] to be popular among people but when you
[1:13:56] slip off your shoes at night and get
[1:13:58] ready to lay down there's only one thing
[1:14:00] that can give you peace that is if you
[1:14:02] know that you're dying that night
[1:14:04] there's only one piece and that is jesus
[1:14:06] is the peace he is our beast it's like
[1:14:09] when brother bosworth was passing away
[1:14:11] and you know he was in his final moments
[1:14:13] you know and and brother brown asked him
[1:14:15] when's the greatest time of your life
[1:14:17] now a lot of people in the world would
[1:14:18] think well in my 20s or my prime of my
[1:14:20] youth but he said right now is the
[1:14:22] actually the greatest time that's going
[1:14:24] to happen to me because he says the one
[1:14:25] i've loved for all these years is going
[1:14:27] to walk through the door and take me
[1:14:28] home
[1:14:30] hello going to take me to glory he was
[1:14:31] looking for the lord to take him he said
[1:14:33] that was the greatest moment of his
[1:14:34] existence was that moment why because he
[1:14:37] had a peace that passes all
[1:14:39] understanding i mean greater than his
[1:14:42] being up in age and pains and hurts and
[1:14:43] whatever more but he was looking for
[1:14:45] that's why a christian's always looking
[1:14:47] forward we're not here to look in the
[1:14:49] rearview mirror and say well i wish i
[1:14:50] was back in 10 20 years no i want to
[1:14:52] live right now this is the greatest
[1:14:54] moment of my life is right now
[1:14:57] hallelujah because why because i'm
[1:14:58] closer now than i ever have been to the
[1:15:00] coming of the lord i mean the one that
[1:15:02] i've loved for these years i'm looking
[1:15:04] to carry me home amen hallelujah
[1:15:08] amen praise the lord amen that's a real
[1:15:10] peace that passes understanding now
[1:15:14] hello yeah i i i hope you agree with me
[1:15:16] on that one
[1:15:18] hallelujah
[1:15:19] amen because this life is just a vapor
[1:15:22] soon it will be gone and where will we
[1:15:24] be well we're going to be on streets of
[1:15:25] gold
[1:15:26] come join me it's going to be awesome
[1:15:28] hallelujah it's going to be awesome
[1:15:31] amen
[1:15:32] now
[1:15:34] we've got to have a trust
[1:15:36] that god is able to keep his word he
[1:15:38] wants you to know that he doesn't just
[1:15:40] want to be in here he wants to be
[1:15:41] anchored in his in your heart that this
[1:15:43] word
[1:15:44] and if i had the message it's the same
[1:15:46] right because the message reveals christ
[1:15:48] in the scripture
[1:15:49] right now she can't differentiate
[1:15:51] between the two but you see now but god
[1:15:53] keeps his word if god is given a promise
[1:15:56] he has never backed up on any single
[1:15:58] promise there's never been a time in
[1:16:00] history where the conditions have got
[1:16:02] too hard for his word to be fulfilled
[1:16:04] right never in the never in the history
[1:16:06] of man when god will bring a promise and
[1:16:08] the devil kind of guesses well i guess
[1:16:10] it's about now just like you know he
[1:16:12] could see that israel was in egypt 400
[1:16:14] about you know it was coming to the time
[1:16:16] the 400 years and the delivery was going
[1:16:18] to come so he inspired pharaoh to throw
[1:16:20] all the boy babies in the nile to kill
[1:16:22] them all you know to try and stop the
[1:16:24] deliverer coming it didn't get too hard
[1:16:26] god didn't say actually thus saith the
[1:16:28] lord the conditions have changed and i
[1:16:30] guess this can't happen no it went on
[1:16:32] all the same amen it went on all the
[1:16:34] same moses was born he was hit by his
[1:16:36] parents he was actually raised in
[1:16:38] pharaoh's house raised up there just to
[1:16:40] tear it down hallelujah you know it's
[1:16:42] amazing the enemy sheltered the
[1:16:44] deliverer that was going to destroy his
[1:16:45] kingdom
[1:16:46] hallelujah amen and here we are in this
[1:16:49] day this world sheltering us but we're
[1:16:50] going to tear it down amen hallelujah
[1:16:52] we're going to go into a rapture then
[1:16:53] there's going to be a great tribulation
[1:16:55] amen but you know so so there was no
[1:16:57] never a time in history where things got
[1:16:59] too hard
[1:17:00] for god to fulfill his word he has never
[1:17:02] ever backed up on a promise
[1:17:04] and because he is able to keep his
[1:17:06] promise it may look impossible to man
[1:17:08] but nothing's impossible to god god is
[1:17:10] the perfect orchestrator he will get his
[1:17:13] word fulfilled right on time but he but
[1:17:15] he wants you to know that right he
[1:17:17] doesn't he knows that but he wants you
[1:17:19] to know that he wants you to be deadly
[1:17:21] sure god you're a man of your word you
[1:17:23] cannot lie you cannot back up you
[1:17:25] couldn't you know he never says well oh
[1:17:27] sorry i was just embellishing that
[1:17:29] know what he says he means and what he
[1:17:31] means he does
[1:17:32] amen so i trust and that's how we can
[1:17:35] entrust in him we say lord you're a man
[1:17:36] of your god of your word and you've
[1:17:39] never backed up on your word amen
[1:17:41] hello you know jesus went to calvary
[1:17:43] with
[1:17:44] one scripture that he'd come out of the
[1:17:46] grave
[1:17:47] one scripture in isaiah where he says
[1:17:49] i'll not suffer my holy one to see
[1:17:51] corruption neither will i leave his soul
[1:17:53] in hell
[1:17:54] that was the one prophecy he went to
[1:17:56] calvary where there was a revelation in
[1:17:58] his heart
[1:17:59] he knew he couldn't stay there in the
[1:18:00] grave he was coming out amen hallelujah
[1:18:03] so by one promise
[1:18:05] amen the resurrection took place
[1:18:08] but he knew that that was going to be
[1:18:10] fulfilled brother ramsay is here he says
[1:18:13] he knew that he must be crucified he
[1:18:15] knew he must suffer the innocent for the
[1:18:17] guilty he knew that he would raise from
[1:18:19] the grave on the third day
[1:18:22] pardon me he knew that there wasn't no
[1:18:24] powers that could hold them in the grave
[1:18:25] because the word of god said i'll not
[1:18:27] suffer my holy one to seek corruption
[1:18:29] neither will i leave her soul in hell
[1:18:31] and there was no powers that could break
[1:18:33] that prophecy his word shall be true and
[1:18:36] they will be fulfilled in their seasons
[1:18:38] and he had confidence that what the
[1:18:40] father had said the father was able to
[1:18:42] keep his word amen so he knew there was
[1:18:45] no powers that could break that prophecy
[1:18:47] so there's no powers that can break the
[1:18:48] prophecy of a rapture it's going to
[1:18:50] happen doesn't matter what the devil
[1:18:52] puts on the puts on the world amen no
[1:18:54] there's a people that are going to be
[1:18:55] translated from this world to the next
[1:18:57] world amen so you know god's going to
[1:18:59] have a bride in this day nothing's going
[1:19:01] to stop it
[1:19:02] nothing can stop that prophecy being
[1:19:03] fulfilled
[1:19:04] hallelujah but we as i said we need to
[1:19:07] have that revelation
[1:19:09] god is going to see us through
[1:19:11] now
[1:19:13] jesus uh in in john 10 he was going to
[1:19:16] be stoned because he said he was god
[1:19:19] right so in john 10 34 jesus answered
[1:19:21] them says this is not written in your
[1:19:23] law i said ye are gods
[1:19:25] if i called them gods it's amazing how
[1:19:27] he said i said
[1:19:29] i thought that was interesting when i
[1:19:30] was reading it last night
[1:19:32] is it not written in your law i said
[1:19:34] yeah gods so basically saying i said in
[1:19:37] the law
[1:19:38] yeah gods
[1:19:40] if he called them gods unto whom the
[1:19:42] word of god came and the scripture
[1:19:44] cannot be broken
[1:19:46] amen so so now
[1:19:48] i just want to take that last part of
[1:19:49] that verse and the scripture cannot be
[1:19:51] broken now
[1:19:52] broken has quite a few meanings
[1:19:55] and part of it means to a null or to
[1:19:57] subvert to do away with
[1:19:59] to deprive of authority whether to uh
[1:20:02] whether by precept or act to declare
[1:20:05] unlawful to loose
[1:20:07] that which is compacted or built
[1:20:08] together to break up demolish destroy
[1:20:11] um you know metaphorically to overthrow
[1:20:14] or to do away with
[1:20:16] now
[1:20:17] the lord said scripture cannot be broken
[1:20:19] but it doesn't mean the devil tries
[1:20:20] doesn't try to break it
[1:20:23] right so now the devil will try and
[1:20:24] break the scripture
[1:20:26] in terms of he'll try and annul it so
[1:20:28] basically say no there's nothing to it
[1:20:30] to subvert it to do away with it to the
[1:20:33] private of authority so basically he
[1:20:35] just dilutes it down that was just man's
[1:20:36] words and that was just paul paul wrote
[1:20:38] that or moses wrote that or james wrote
[1:20:41] that or yeah paul wrote there to god you
[1:20:42] know you know there's a lot of you know
[1:20:44] there's a whole movement within
[1:20:45] christianity which basically says throw
[1:20:47] out the writings of paul right
[1:20:49] because it was just him and he was a
[1:20:50] pharisee just complicated things and all
[1:20:52] the but if you take away his writings
[1:20:54] you take away the rapture
[1:20:56] because he wrote of a moment a twinkling
[1:20:58] of an eye will all be changed but
[1:21:00] there's many things that you know even
[1:21:01] even peter said that the writings of
[1:21:03] paul are hard to understand
[1:21:07] as but and he said as the unlearner do
[1:21:09] they wrestle with that and the rest of
[1:21:10] the scripture
[1:21:11] so peter had a revelation sure maybe
[1:21:14] what appears to be complicated to some
[1:21:16] but he put it on par with the rest of
[1:21:18] the scripture
[1:21:19] yeah you know so i'll just go with
[1:21:20] brother peter and say amen amen and i've
[1:21:22] seen god fulfill what was written
[1:21:24] through paul but we know it true a true
[1:21:27] believer knows that the bible is god's
[1:21:29] inspired word amen right so its
[1:21:31] authority is above all things amen amen
[1:21:34] but the devil try and make it so it's
[1:21:36] man's opinion it's been translated too
[1:21:38] many times all that kind of stuff but if
[1:21:41] god is a god of his word don't you think
[1:21:43] he can keep his word
[1:21:44] he can still give us a pure word that
[1:21:46] will produce what it promised to produce
[1:21:48] in 2022. i mean he'll try and declare it
[1:21:51] unlawful he'll try and break it up to
[1:21:53] demolish it
[1:21:54] but that is just you know but that's not
[1:21:57] just in society or in public opinion
[1:21:59] that's in your mind
[1:22:01] he'll try and do that see the devil will
[1:22:03] try and reason
[1:22:04] the scripture away trying to undermine
[1:22:06] its power and authority but we need to
[1:22:09] look into the scripture and see what did
[1:22:11] what what power and authority did jesus
[1:22:13] give the scripture
[1:22:14] now he would he would speak in in luke
[1:22:17] chapter 16 i don't have it in my notes
[1:22:18] we wouldn't read it but the same time
[1:22:20] and he'd tell the story of a certain
[1:22:22] rich man and the bigger lazarus
[1:22:25] now he said that they both died
[1:22:28] and the rich man found himself in hell
[1:22:30] and torment
[1:22:31] and lazarus was in paradise which was
[1:22:34] called abraham's bosom now i like it how
[1:22:37] it actually says maybe maybe actually i
[1:22:39] just want to put this verse up because i
[1:22:40] want you to see it um we're going to go
[1:22:42] to luke 16. i wasn't going to read this
[1:22:44] but i just like this one bit because
[1:22:46] this just really shows
[1:22:48] you know should should our you know the
[1:22:50] devil can't snatch us after we die
[1:22:52] we are safe and secure to our
[1:22:54] destination
[1:22:56] i mean so let's go to luke now now when
[1:22:58] jesus said a certain rich man he wasn't
[1:23:00] just making up a story he's saying this
[1:23:01] actually happened
[1:23:03] right and we know brother graham ties us
[1:23:05] to the rich young ruler
[1:23:07] um who because it was rich as he wasn't
[1:23:10] willing to sell all take up his cross
[1:23:11] and follow the lord now we are going to
[1:23:13] x i mean sorry luke and luke 16 and to
[1:23:16] the end of the
[1:23:18] um
[1:23:20] to the end of the
[1:23:24] yes let's go luke 16 and 22 i just want
[1:23:27] that one verse
[1:23:28] so it came to pass the bigger died and
[1:23:30] was carried by the angels into abraham's
[1:23:32] bosom so i like that so in other words
[1:23:36] lazarus
[1:23:37] had had an angelic escort to his
[1:23:40] destination
[1:23:41] hallelujah so from this world to the
[1:23:43] next world i don't know how it works
[1:23:45] exactly but from this world to the next
[1:23:46] world there were god's angels saying i'm
[1:23:48] gonna carry this one amen i'm gonna
[1:23:51] carry this soul to his final destination
[1:23:53] hallelujah said don't you think now god
[1:23:55] will see us through amen not just in
[1:23:57] this world because you know we don't we
[1:23:59] have never we've felt
[1:24:01] influence upon our lives when the holy
[1:24:03] ghost comes down that's heaven reaching
[1:24:05] down brother and says it's like your
[1:24:07] theophany bumping into you telling you
[1:24:09] when you're wrong and things will come
[1:24:10] at time it won't just be a bump it'll be
[1:24:12] it'll be a full impact it will merge one
[1:24:14] to the other will be gone hallelujah
[1:24:17] that's why it's so important that the
[1:24:18] spirit of god moves but you see we felt
[1:24:20] the effect of there but we've never been
[1:24:22] there so now there's a question how
[1:24:23] we're gonna get there well i just read
[1:24:25] these angels are gonna carry me
[1:24:28] hallelujah so i've got an angelic escort
[1:24:30] see in this world we've got an angelic
[1:24:32] escort god's angels are here to minister
[1:24:34] to the ears of salvation to actually
[1:24:36] protect us watch over us they walk with
[1:24:38] us the holy ghost god himself is within
[1:24:41] us he says the angel of the lord and
[1:24:43] camps about those that fear him and
[1:24:44] that's even many people say that's the
[1:24:46] angels of the lord now that's true but
[1:24:48] it's the angel of the lord god himself
[1:24:51] and angelic foreman camps around you
[1:24:53] amen
[1:24:54] you have the best security detail in
[1:24:56] existence the fbi whatever they've got
[1:24:59] nothing on this they're sas they've got
[1:25:01] nothing on what you've got
[1:25:03] that's around you 24 7. that's right
[1:25:05] hallelujah and and if this like if this
[1:25:07] day is my last day upon the earth you
[1:25:10] say where is he gone i'll say well
[1:25:12] angels have taken me home
[1:25:14] hallelujah
[1:25:15] so do you trust it
[1:25:17] do you trust him
[1:25:19] amen should give you perfect peace god's
[1:25:21] got this whole thing
[1:25:23] it's all wrapped up
[1:25:26] now
[1:25:28] where were we oh yes yes we were um so
[1:25:30] yeah thank you you can take that down
[1:25:32] but you see now um the rich man he
[1:25:35] appeals to abraham says you know send
[1:25:37] lazarus with a bit of water on his
[1:25:39] finger then he can dip it in my tanks
[1:25:40] and be tormented and abraham says no
[1:25:42] there's a gold fix between you can't
[1:25:44] come here he can't go to you hallelujah
[1:25:46] have you saved you're saved right i
[1:25:48] always take the good side of these
[1:25:49] things amen if you're under the blood
[1:25:51] you're under the blood
[1:25:53] amen but then but then he says well send
[1:25:55] lazarus to my brethren because you know
[1:25:57] i've got five brothers all however many
[1:25:58] it is he says i don't want them to go
[1:26:00] here but then abraham said no they have
[1:26:03] the law and the prophets that's enough
[1:26:06] so basically he is saying that that the
[1:26:08] word they have in their house has the
[1:26:11] power within it has the authority within
[1:26:13] it to take them that they don't have to
[1:26:15] go to where you've gone they can go to
[1:26:17] glory amen that's that's the power
[1:26:20] that jesus put on the word that they had
[1:26:22] received now that was just the old
[1:26:24] testament law how about the new
[1:26:25] testament how about the full revelation
[1:26:27] of jesus christ amen hallelujah
[1:26:30] amen so the word has power within it if
[1:26:33] it's received into a heart of faith it
[1:26:35] will change you from lost or found
[1:26:37] it will change you from sinner to saint
[1:26:39] it will change you from unbeliever to
[1:26:40] believer
[1:26:42] hallelujah it will change you amen from
[1:26:44] from one of doubt and flusterations to a
[1:26:46] heart of faith
[1:26:48] where you actually have a piece of god
[1:26:49] that passes all understanding
[1:26:52] hallelujah
[1:26:54] amen
[1:26:56] hallelujah so i like that we have an
[1:26:58] angelic escort i just wanted to put that
[1:27:00] in because i enjoyed that last night
[1:27:02] hallelujah amen now
[1:27:05] amen so we should we should think the
[1:27:07] same this word that we've received
[1:27:10] amen if it's received in a heart of
[1:27:11] faith jesus would say in john 5 and 24
[1:27:15] fairly fairly i say unto you he that
[1:27:17] heareth my word
[1:27:18] and believeth on him that sent me
[1:27:20] has everlasting life and shall not come
[1:27:23] into condemnation but is passed from
[1:27:26] death unto life so someone who and that
[1:27:28] word hereth means an understanding it's
[1:27:30] been revealed so it's not just hearing
[1:27:32] as in here many people have heard the
[1:27:34] word but it hasn't changed their lives
[1:27:35] but those that god opens their heart
[1:27:38] that it becomes a revelation
[1:27:40] right what happens they actually and and
[1:27:43] so god gives them faith then they
[1:27:45] actually have everlasting life now
[1:27:47] what we don't receive eternal life there
[1:27:49] we receive it here right so we're
[1:27:51] actually walking around if you're a real
[1:27:53] believer with the holy ghost you
[1:27:54] actually have eternal life in you
[1:27:57] possession right now
[1:27:59] it says and shall not come into the co
[1:28:01] into condemnation that with congress is
[1:28:03] is the judgment
[1:28:05] so they shall not go to the right throne
[1:28:07] judgment they cannot go there
[1:28:09] hallelujah this is so simple but don't
[1:28:11] let it pass over your head because
[1:28:13] you're the devil remember salvation is
[1:28:15] our as our walls and our bullworks it's
[1:28:17] our it's our defense
[1:28:18] the devil says there's no way you're
[1:28:20] going it says no it's too late devil you
[1:28:22] turned up too late to tell me this
[1:28:23] because i've already met the lord so it
[1:28:25] says here they have everlasting life and
[1:28:27] shall not come into condemnation but is
[1:28:30] passed from death unto life they have
[1:28:32] right now
[1:28:33] and to me this is a bright scripture
[1:28:35] this is not just a
[1:28:36] say a sinner's prayer you've done it no
[1:28:37] it's when the lord reveals himself to
[1:28:39] you
[1:28:40] and you actually get a real faith not a
[1:28:42] human faith but god's faith god reveals
[1:28:44] the word to you it becomes a living
[1:28:46] reality it changes you because a
[1:28:48] revelation changes a person
[1:28:50] moses was a defeated 80 year old
[1:28:52] shepherd on the backside of the desert
[1:28:53] but when god spoke to him in the burning
[1:28:54] bush it became a revelation and he went
[1:28:57] down to egypt the same place he reigned
[1:28:58] from and conquered the whole place to
[1:29:00] deliver the people of israel why because
[1:29:01] it became a revelation amen amen amen
[1:29:05] that's right hallelujah
[1:29:07] amen so when it's revealed to us
[1:29:09] actually i have passed from death unto
[1:29:11] life
[1:29:12] amen i've already done that yeah
[1:29:14] hallelujah
[1:29:15] amen shouldn't that give you a peace
[1:29:16] that passes all understanding when you
[1:29:18] think upon those things
[1:29:21] amen
[1:29:23] praise the lord i like that very much
[1:29:25] amen so i can't go to the white throne
[1:29:27] judgment because i i
[1:29:29] i won't go to the condemnation
[1:29:31] we just let off the pressure
[1:29:34] amen just enjoy the lord amen just enjoy
[1:29:37] being a christian just love him worship
[1:29:39] him give him glory don't be all tangled
[1:29:41] see see i heard an um convincing concern
[1:29:43] brother ram said you know man makes
[1:29:45] god complicated right but god makes it
[1:29:48] simple
[1:29:49] so let's not let the devil make it
[1:29:51] complicated in our minds no god's simple
[1:29:54] he rather he brings it so it is simple
[1:29:57] you know so and i thank the lord that
[1:30:00] means i can understand
[1:30:01] you know but god makes it so simple that
[1:30:03] actually no you
[1:30:05] you can't miss it because he doesn't
[1:30:06] want you to miss it but he wants you to
[1:30:08] rest in his salvation
[1:30:11] hallelujah he wants you to rest in it he
[1:30:13] wants you to have confidence in him
[1:30:16] amen so when they so when the word now
[1:30:18] as i said about the word it's not just
[1:30:20] the written word of god right we know
[1:30:22] that the bible's infallible doesn't
[1:30:23] matter what people have done to it it's
[1:30:25] infallible right but then also the
[1:30:27] spoken word in this day when you hear
[1:30:29] the voice behind the voice
[1:30:31] it illuminates the scripture and
[1:30:34] illumina it actually turns the light on
[1:30:36] and you begin to see hey i'm not just
[1:30:38] here following a religion this is not a
[1:30:40] religion if you want religion there's a
[1:30:42] door go find it somewhere else no we're
[1:30:44] here to have a true relationship with
[1:30:46] the lord jesus christ that's what
[1:30:48] christianity is when you meet him he
[1:30:50] talks to you you talk back to him you
[1:30:52] walk with him you form a relationship
[1:30:54] and it's a love affair it's not a fear
[1:30:56] your god wants to take away all fear
[1:30:58] all doubt all worry it should be so far
[1:31:01] from our mind am i gonna make it no that
[1:31:04] should be so far away amen god wants you
[1:31:06] to know you've already made it amen
[1:31:09] amen if you have the holy ghost now you
[1:31:11] may think it's a bit strong but if you
[1:31:12] really have the holy ghost if he's
[1:31:14] really sealed you into the kingdom
[1:31:16] you've already made it
[1:31:19] that scripture of john 5 has already
[1:31:20] been fulfilled in your life
[1:31:22] you've already made it what about my ups
[1:31:24] and downs you have your ups and downs
[1:31:26] what about my hard days you have your
[1:31:28] hard days what about trials you have
[1:31:29] your trials
[1:31:30] right you have all these troubles what
[1:31:32] about my sin all these things if you
[1:31:33] confess your sin
[1:31:35] he is faithful and just to forgive you
[1:31:38] that's how powerful i believe that's a
[1:31:40] powerful scripture hallelujah
[1:31:44] amen you confess it lord i'm wrong i did
[1:31:46] this forgive me lord he's faithful and
[1:31:48] just his side of it as well i've got to
[1:31:50] forgive you
[1:31:51] right if it's from a heart of faith
[1:31:53] a genuine sincere heart a real
[1:31:55] repentance he has to forgive you because
[1:31:57] he says he's faithful and just
[1:31:59] do forgive amen he doesn't leave it in
[1:32:01] the cupboard when he gets grumpy you did
[1:32:03] this five million years ago you did this
[1:32:05] the other day no no no it's in the sea
[1:32:07] of his forgetfulness he doesn't remember
[1:32:08] it
[1:32:10] amen
[1:32:12] so when the word has really revealed it
[1:32:14] to you nothing can throw you from it
[1:32:17] amen as you give me a pic remember i'm
[1:32:20] when we have a piece of past
[1:32:21] understanding i'm sure i've already said
[1:32:22] it doesn't mean we'll be we won't have
[1:32:24] any mind battles yeah right we'll have
[1:32:26] mind battles
[1:32:27] right we're not walking in some nirvana
[1:32:29] state where there's no trouble in here
[1:32:31] no there will be trouble but there's a
[1:32:33] piece in here
[1:32:34] that passes understanding okay so just
[1:32:36] because you may be going through a mind
[1:32:38] battle that doesn't mean you're not a
[1:32:39] believer
[1:32:40] right just because sickness you know
[1:32:41] some people think well i've got enough
[1:32:43] faith that'll keep sickness away from
[1:32:44] you like a bug spray or something no it
[1:32:46] doesn't work that way
[1:32:48] actually when you go through a trial
[1:32:49] it's because god has found you
[1:32:51] faith has found favor you found favor in
[1:32:53] the sight of god the prophet says that's
[1:32:55] why you go through a trial
[1:32:58] my lord praise the lord so i i know i
[1:33:00] hope you're not thinking i hope i never
[1:33:02] find favor with you guys
[1:33:04] no we want to find favor but it's
[1:33:06] because he has made you accept it in his
[1:33:07] presence
[1:33:08] amen it's not anything we earn
[1:33:11] amen
[1:33:12] amen and god keeps his word amen that's
[1:33:15] the word of god where i rest not whether
[1:33:17] i jumped whether i shouted whether i
[1:33:19] spoke with tongues whether i had oil in
[1:33:21] my hands whether i preached or what i'd
[1:33:22] done i'm resting on that promise satan
[1:33:24] can beat me around the stump on my
[1:33:26] feelings but he count on the word amen
[1:33:29] because it's thus saith the lord that's
[1:33:30] where jesus defeated the devil right
[1:33:32] there says it's written man shall not
[1:33:34] live by bread alone stay with the word
[1:33:36] amen amen
[1:33:39] hey it's true hey he can beat us all day
[1:33:40] long with our feelings
[1:33:42] that's right i know i've had a lot of
[1:33:44] experiences there
[1:33:45] but you gotta walk no don't walk with
[1:33:47] your feelings walk with god
[1:33:49] right you feel down don't walk with it
[1:33:50] down walk with god god is an upper he's
[1:33:52] not a downer god is a stabilizer right
[1:33:55] so walk with god
[1:33:57] amen amen hallelujah see now the devil
[1:34:00] will try and undermine the word at every
[1:34:02] hand now when he tries to undermine the
[1:34:04] word he's trying to undermine god in
[1:34:06] your life that's right so when i say the
[1:34:07] word i mean in god i'm meaning jesus
[1:34:09] right because he is his word
[1:34:11] so now he says in the book of uh says
[1:34:13] brother brahm in the church facebook he
[1:34:14] says now remember this christ and the
[1:34:16] true church is a continuation of the
[1:34:18] book of acts
[1:34:20] but the book of revelation
[1:34:23] the book of revelation
[1:34:25] shows that how the antichrist spirit
[1:34:26] will come into the church and defile it
[1:34:28] making it lukewarm formal and powerless
[1:34:30] it exposes satan and and that exposing
[1:34:32] of satan reveals his works which is the
[1:34:35] attempted destruction of god's people
[1:34:37] and the discrediting of god's word
[1:34:40] right down to the time he's cast a lake
[1:34:42] of fire he fights that he cannot stand
[1:34:44] it he knows if the people get the true
[1:34:46] revelation of the true church and what
[1:34:48] she is and what she stands for that she
[1:34:50] can do the greater work she will be an
[1:34:52] invincible army if they get a true
[1:34:55] revelation of the two spirits within the
[1:34:56] framework of the christian church and by
[1:34:59] god's spirit discern and withstand the
[1:35:01] antichrist spirit satan will be
[1:35:03] powerless before her he will be
[1:35:05] definitely he'll be definitely thwalted
[1:35:07] today as when christ withstood his every
[1:35:09] effort to gain power over him in the
[1:35:10] desert
[1:35:12] yes satan hates revelation but we love
[1:35:14] it amen with true revelation in our
[1:35:15] lives the gates of hell cannot prevail
[1:35:17] against us but we will prevail over them
[1:35:20] now i just want to break that down
[1:35:22] if if the true church gets the true
[1:35:25] revelation
[1:35:26] of what she is what she stands for and
[1:35:28] she can do the greater work she'll be
[1:35:30] the invincible army so i just want to
[1:35:31] break that down and then and then and
[1:35:33] then we're going to wrap up so the true
[1:35:35] revelation of the true church what is
[1:35:36] the true church it's the body of christ
[1:35:38] upon the earth
[1:35:40] right but by one spirit we're baptized
[1:35:42] into one body so the true church is his
[1:35:45] body upon the earth
[1:35:46] right we are his hands we are his feet
[1:35:49] we are his eyes we're his mouth i meant
[1:35:51] that if you're part of that body
[1:35:54] hallelujah if you have the holy ghost
[1:35:56] you're part of the body of christ it's
[1:35:58] around the world it's not just in these
[1:36:00] four walls thank the lord amen amen so
[1:36:03] so if you get the true revelation
[1:36:04] actually i am part of him
[1:36:06] i'm boners bone flesh was full flesh
[1:36:08] life is life i am part of him just as a
[1:36:11] husband and wife are one so christ and
[1:36:13] his bride are one
[1:36:14] hallelujah
[1:36:16] amen now now if you're his body it
[1:36:18] doesn't matter what part of the body you
[1:36:20] are you are still above the devil
[1:36:23] amen he isn't convinced and concerned he
[1:36:24] says but god don't have any little bitty
[1:36:27] children or great big children they're
[1:36:29] all children to him that's exactly right
[1:36:31] and your rightly position is sitting
[1:36:33] right in heavenly places in christ jesus
[1:36:35] with every power he said brother brown
[1:36:37] i'm the least in the church i'm just a
[1:36:38] little bitty fellow but remember
[1:36:40] when he ascended on high see you're
[1:36:42] raised with him you're the body and
[1:36:45] you're with christ right now seated in
[1:36:47] heavenly places he says if you're the
[1:36:48] skin on the bottom of the feet every
[1:36:51] devil is underneath you
[1:36:53] hallelujah why because
[1:36:54] the foot is on the head of the devil she
[1:36:56] can be the skin on the little toe you're
[1:36:58] still above the devil he's still under
[1:37:00] you
[1:37:01] hallelujah that's exactly right the
[1:37:02] church where the head is the body is
[1:37:05] with it hallelujah so if he's been
[1:37:07] resident heavenly places far above all
[1:37:09] principality power demon with powers in
[1:37:11] high places
[1:37:13] you're there too amen
[1:37:15] yeah walking upon the earth
[1:37:17] amen and if we are bare
[1:37:19] and if we are buried died buried in
[1:37:21] christ then we are raised with him in
[1:37:22] this resurrection set in heavenly places
[1:37:24] in christ jesus with every fire of hell
[1:37:26] under us amen no matter how little you
[1:37:29] are every devil's under you amen i trust
[1:37:31] we got a revelation of the true church
[1:37:33] right amen we every devil is under you
[1:37:37] now
[1:37:38] not one day no the blood puts them under
[1:37:40] you now
[1:37:42] glory to god
[1:37:44] amen our great conqueror has conquered
[1:37:46] every sin everything every sickness even
[1:37:48] death itself that's right we are more
[1:37:49] than conquerors in him one thing we are
[1:37:51] seated with him and his throne amen
[1:37:53] that's it it's all there all right jesus
[1:37:56] hallelujah now what she stands for i'm
[1:37:58] just going to break this down what she
[1:38:00] stands for she stands for the truth amen
[1:38:03] she stands for purity she stands for
[1:38:05] holiness she stands for deliverance she
[1:38:08] stands for liberty she stands for the
[1:38:10] power of god she stands for love joy
[1:38:13] peace long suffering for faith she
[1:38:14] stands for the pure underfiled word amen
[1:38:17] right she stands for the moving of the
[1:38:18] holy ghost she stands for him having had
[1:38:21] ship over her that's what she stands for
[1:38:23] amen she does not stand
[1:38:25] for just living by an argument
[1:38:28] amen if you have just an argument that's
[1:38:30] why you're a christian like a bunch of
[1:38:32] facts have been put together in your
[1:38:33] heart that's why you're a christian
[1:38:34] someone can argue away from it
[1:38:36] but if it's revealed to you
[1:38:39] it doesn't matter how good the argument
[1:38:40] is it won't stand
[1:38:42] remember a testimony is never subject to
[1:38:45] an argument
[1:38:46] right
[1:38:48] a testimony can never be overcome by an
[1:38:50] argument
[1:38:51] because a testimony is an experience of
[1:38:52] the true and living god an argument is
[1:38:54] just some reasoning but reasoning can
[1:38:56] never stand against a true testimony
[1:38:59] that's why it's so important you must be
[1:39:00] born again right if you have that true
[1:39:02] experience then all the arguing of all
[1:39:04] the atheists in the world can't shake
[1:39:06] you amen from walking with the lord
[1:39:09] being a christian
[1:39:10] amen she stands for the reality of the
[1:39:13] resurrection of jesus christ
[1:39:15] now that she can do the greater work
[1:39:17] shall i probably unpack this a bit more
[1:39:18] later but we're just going to go this
[1:39:19] bit here she can do the greater works
[1:39:21] now that greater works is imparting
[1:39:23] eternal life
[1:39:25] says on that day on calvary now notice
[1:39:27] the greater works was to have the power
[1:39:29] in the church not only to heal the sick
[1:39:31] by prayer to cast out devils by prayer
[1:39:34] but to impart eternal life to believers
[1:39:37] i think it's important two believers the
[1:39:39] holy ghost was coming and given into the
[1:39:41] hands of the church to impart life oh
[1:39:43] that's what calvary meant it took stoop
[1:39:46] the greater men and women and lifted
[1:39:48] them into a place to be sons and
[1:39:49] daughters of god to heal the sick and to
[1:39:52] impart eternal life by giving the holy
[1:39:54] ghost to obedient believers is what it
[1:39:56] means right men who wants unbelievers to
[1:39:58] be made believers and impart spiritual
[1:40:01] eternal life how much greater is it to
[1:40:03] say this sick woman lying here i can
[1:40:06] pray a prayer of faith and shall be
[1:40:07] healed that's a great thing
[1:40:09] but that and but that's what he was
[1:40:10] doing then but said greater than this
[1:40:13] shall you do i'm going to give you power
[1:40:15] not only to raise him up for a while but
[1:40:17] give me eternal life which will be
[1:40:20] eternal forever blind poor wretched
[1:40:22] people how do you miss that don't you
[1:40:24] see what the greatest thing is that's
[1:40:26] the greatest thing that could ever
[1:40:28] happen was to impart eternal life to
[1:40:30] people what is eternal life the life
[1:40:32] that he lived the life that was in him
[1:40:33] imparted to others can a man do that he
[1:40:35] says the son of god can
[1:40:38] now we look into the scripture how this
[1:40:40] works hallelujah
[1:40:42] peter would go to cornelius's house
[1:40:44] eternal life's going to be imparted amen
[1:40:47] amen and he would preach on the
[1:40:48] resurrection preach on the lord jesus
[1:40:50] take away all the sin preaching what god
[1:40:51] was doing in their present day and those
[1:40:53] in cornelius's house believed because
[1:40:56] peter was a fulfillment of a vision of
[1:40:58] visitation that cornelius had and so
[1:41:00] they were under expectation when peter
[1:41:02] walked into what he was preaching they
[1:41:04] believed that while yet peter spake
[1:41:05] these words the holy ghost fell upon
[1:41:07] them amen amen so what happened eternal
[1:41:09] life was imparted
[1:41:11] it's not some magical trick no it's when
[1:41:13] someone believes what you're saying if
[1:41:15] god is inspiring you to speak now this
[1:41:17] is not just a preacher this could be
[1:41:18] anyone
[1:41:19] but you're having fellowship with
[1:41:20] someone and god's speaking through you
[1:41:22] they believe it the holy ghost can fall
[1:41:24] upon them
[1:41:25] amen we can pray with people that they
[1:41:28] anyone can pray i believe a believer
[1:41:29] filled with the holy ghost can pray with
[1:41:31] someone until they receive the holy
[1:41:32] ghost
[1:41:34] isn't that empowered imparting eternal
[1:41:36] life
[1:41:38] hallelujah
[1:41:39] amen
[1:41:41] praise the lord
[1:41:43] now
[1:41:44] i'm just going to read one more
[1:41:47] hallelujah
[1:41:48] praise the lord now
[1:41:51] the whole christian experience i'm just
[1:41:53] going to sum it up with this the whole
[1:41:54] christian walk is based upon rest
[1:41:56] it's based upon rest when you really
[1:41:58] receive the holy ghost you enter into
[1:42:00] rest you cease from your own works it's
[1:42:02] not you trying to please the lord if god
[1:42:04] comes into you and he fulfills his word
[1:42:06] in your life so it's not what you can
[1:42:08] push and pull and shove and do no no
[1:42:09] it's him leading you
[1:42:11] amen and that what does that do that
[1:42:14] creates such a faith and a trust
[1:42:17] hallelujah now you can just rest now
[1:42:19] that rest does not mean you get lacks
[1:42:22] no that rest is actually it seems
[1:42:24] contradictory in a way you're resting
[1:42:25] but you're pushing amen because you want
[1:42:27] to press the battle because you see god
[1:42:29] live you want him to live in other
[1:42:30] people's lives right but you're resting
[1:42:32] it's not your own human ability it's
[1:42:34] what he does now
[1:42:36] that matters see so like brother braham
[1:42:38] says that the when you receive the token
[1:42:40] the holy ghost he says
[1:42:44] he says now the life that i now live he
[1:42:46] lived a different life from one from
[1:42:47] from once he did is not me but christ
[1:42:49] liveth in me there is the identified
[1:42:52] token that god required
[1:42:54] so we're identified with our sacrifice
[1:42:56] when the life of our lord jesus comes
[1:42:58] into us we're identified with our
[1:42:59] sacrifice
[1:43:00] right the life of our savior and us the
[1:43:02] holy ghost oh what a positive token
[1:43:04] there cannot be any more token oh if you
[1:43:06] could only catch the thought of it if i
[1:43:08] had power this morning with words to
[1:43:10] express and place into your soul not in
[1:43:13] your ears but your soul that you could
[1:43:14] see the guarantee of it and i wish i
[1:43:16] could actually do that you could see the
[1:43:18] guarantee that you've really passed from
[1:43:20] death to life have you really got the
[1:43:21] holy ghost you already made it he said
[1:43:24] it would make you feel so relaxed
[1:43:28] not lex but relaxed
[1:43:30] why can you relax because the blood's
[1:43:31] been applied doesn't matter what the
[1:43:33] devil does on the outside he can rage
[1:43:35] all he wants i'm safe and secure i know
[1:43:38] where i'm going
[1:43:40] amen and what does that give you that
[1:43:42] gives you a peace that passes all
[1:43:44] understanding though you may be in the
[1:43:47] biggest trial of your life biggest
[1:43:48] hardship whatever more there's a peace
[1:43:50] in your heart that reigns
[1:43:52] amen and you can rest in his word
[1:43:54] because he's more than able to perform
[1:43:56] it and you can just walk on praising god
[1:43:59] amen not worshiping your trouble
[1:44:02] worshiping the law
[1:44:04] praising him giving him glory i mean
[1:44:06] having full confidence he's more than
[1:44:08] able to perform that which he has
[1:44:10] promised i'm just going to leave it
[1:44:11] there because i think we'll we'll pick
[1:44:13] this up in august maybe

[1:44:32] life now just just just put mute on the
[1:44:34] devil's conversation amen because he's
[1:44:37] in your ear going but this and this and
